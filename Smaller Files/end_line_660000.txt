하고 싶은거 다하는거 같아서 보기좋아요🤢🤢💗
뭘 의도하는건지 무슨 콘셉트인건지...
Es cierto es muy positiva la canción y por lo mismo es muy contagiosa.
진짜 노래 너무 좋다..오늘 너무 불안하고 미치겠고 왜 내가 안했을까 후회하고 짜증나고 그랬는데 위로가 되는 느낌ㅠㅠㅠ
Can't help but to sing along especially the chorus part (thou i am not a korean) .Forget about the correct pronunciation, just sing and move along in sync with this MV.  Very addictive song, indeed! \n\n#canbebetter #8thanniversary #highlight #thebestever #light

What is highlight their fandom name?!

하이라이트로 데뷔 전부터 팬인 학생으로써 과거 슬픈 노래가 나 대신 울어줘서 너무 공감되고 애착 가지게 되다 하이라이트로 바뀌고 분위기가 확 달라져서 적응.. 솔직히 아직도 완전히 못했어요..ㅎ\n\n 그래선지 아직도 그때처럼 윤용양이손의 슬프고 애절한 감성을 바라기도 하지만 이번 가사를 보고 생각이 많아진 것 같아요.\n\n\n학생으로써 진로,성적 같은거나 취직까지 생각해서 가끔 고민 하다 결국 아무것도 못하는데 그 누구도 밝게 어쩔수 지 뭐! 오늘은 이제 어제가 될꺼야! 힘든 건 곧 지나가! 라고 외쳐준적 없는걸 내 가수 입으로 듣는 것 같아 자칭타칭 슬픈노래 덕후지만 너무 심쿵..은 농담이고 고마웠어요.\n\n이렇게 본인들이 걸어온 길을 통해 나를 위로해 준 노래를 써준것 같아서 고맙습니다. \n\n늘 좋은 목소리로, 예쁜 생각으로 만든 뜻 깊고 멋진 곡 고마워요..\n\n 혹시나 할랕이 내글을 보게된다면 늘 나에게 위로해줘서 고맙다고 전해주고 싶어요. \n\n슬픈노래 컨셉보다 밝은 노래컨셉으로 거의 바뀌었다면서요? \n\n나 그럼 슬픈노래 십만곡 채울 때까지 팬 할꺼니까 그래도 그때까진 슬픈노래 내주기예요!ㅎㅎ\n\n할랕 너무 예쁜 목소리라 내가 듣고 싶은 노래 부르는 거 내 욕심이지만 듣고 싶단 말이예요..♥

Damn this is deep. Those bullets made him realize the beauty of life and I think those same bullets also unleashed a Dolph 1000x more determined than ever before. I smell some hits cooking up - show em why you still here brother man. Put the fear of God in the haters. 💯
This Is A Very Powerful Song I can Relate to this Song, Young Dolph is not like a normal south rapper hes top shelf. Thats why Gotti wants him dead, everyone shows respect to Dolph.He Know Dolph King Of Memphis and thats why he keep having his goon homies shoot at him but Real Niggaz Dont die Ever! PRE DOLPH AYYYYEEEE
ppl know the struggle then this 100 , keep your head up and keep paper chasing!!

Smoking Bud Listening To This
Only the strong survives. Never take life for granted
One Day You Here next Day you gone Thats For real !
This may be the stupidest comment ever but the way Dolph seemly already have a album on go mode every time him and Gotti have a run in, it almost seem like them niggas working together to keep each other relevant and trending. Only problem though with that is a nigga ain't stupid enough to take some shells for it though!!! I hope......
Dolph u pumped then niggas heads up to shoot u bruh. Fuck this soft shit. Them niggas shot u cause u made them.. U gotta ride that beef shit out till its over.  Fucj this soft shit nigga. Lay in the bed u made nigga and give us that FCK CMG shit u been giving us. This song got u sounding weak
God bless you dolph you got another one 🐬🐬🐬

here before a milli🔥🔥 but check my channel out
This is who Jay Z got his newfound Black wealth talk from....💯 Facts. Luv Dame✊🏿
Wow Dame got blacked balled for knowing the truth years ago..shit crazy
If I were in music I'd definitely have Dame Dash by my side...
Consistent.....he was always screaming fuck that rat bastard synagogue of Satan pedophile jew-ISH scum...it's time the MOST HIGH starts judging these devils publicly...Thank you my gee for TELLING THE TRUTH
ALL YALL NIGGAS TAKE NOTES: this nigga  Damon Dash is an excellent example of black manhood!!!!
That BIG artwork in the back is dope.
Dame dash defines a strong black man. He refuse to sell his soul for a dollar.
This is why so many sambo, coon, uncle tom and bed wench negroes(male & female) talk so negative about Dame. Because he wasn't scared of cracKKKer's and talked bad to they shady azz's LOL.
if dame would had pulled off paid independently
Dame dash spoke only nothing but the truth on the culture vultures lyor Cohen etc Dame dash is da truth that blackballed Dame for speaking up to the powers that shouldn't be old slaves was in chains new slaves are in denial Dame dash n myself only got but knowledge of self
I dont always agree with Dame but when he right he be fucking right....
great interview...Dame you continue to inform and inspire. I worked with you when I was doing Artist Development at Polygram. I rocks with you bro. Respect/Salute!!!
BINGO you can have a company in your name but still not be your own boss.
Dame is a voice of reason, and that shit is rare these days. People sale their dignity on the regular nowdays, money over everything is the moto, even their fucking soul.
i knew dame did backflips when all that shit came out cuz hes been voicing that for a whole decade i remember him getting blackball in hollywood cuz he bark at him ... good or bad dame keeps it real i give him that ...
I like Dame he is the definition of a real husler.
Once fucking again dame prove yall fukk nigga  wrong he neva get his kudos it's sad how mf is slow nd it hard being a being a futuristic dang stay dropping jewels on you slow motherfukers they hate on great mf dame dash
Now everyone knows why he was BLK Balled he knew too much lucky they didn't smoke him
Soon as this Weinstein thing started to blow, I thought about Dame's relationship to them and how people will look at him now. I worked w/ people like the Weinsteins in entertainment.  Please trust, many people knew and remained silent. They took the money . There is the lesson.
What he said about his daughters is exactly how I feel. I saw this shit and I looked at how I would want my daughters treated and was like naw I ain’t fuckin with that. It’s funny how all the shit he has said and done came full circle.
Dame a real one 💪🏽
Why did Obama send his daughter to intern for that scum Weinstein?
I don't want to tale the wrong story but didn't Dame say he hugged one of Harveys women and Harvey got sour ??? I can't figure out the angle on this Harvey Weinstein news because they never BAG a White Jewish man like this . He fucked with the wrong somebody.
i remember dame talking about the weinsteins years ago! i didnt know what he was talking about but i rmember his dislike was undeniable
Always got time for Dame..and big up yourself Kenyatta
Love this guy (Dame).  Because he always keeps it 100
Dame is Lying about standing up for the weak. Seen him midtown shopping, he was walking out the store i was walking in and i was like ohh what's up dame...he said Get the Fuck away from me
Did you hear the contradiction, black dudes talk more bullshit,
I love how Dame talks over bro every time he tries to contribute to the convo 😂😂😂
So nerds are disrespectful..🤔 lol
keep up the great work
Perception is power. If u cant be a boss have a boss mentality.
Hold up if u run a company.....Can yu get voted out?
Damn is truth, he’s evolved into being king , he’s full of knowledge in this business world ✊🏽✊🏽
Dame is a underrated GOAT and always been mislead, but he speaks truth and facts but he been preaching shit before like he said became popular this is not the first situation either. I've been researching and learning about this dude for years now, I'm just 24 so I wasn't comprehending who he was as a child growing up. I love what he values, and that's himself, his people and family every powerful black man should, Kenyatta too and I have a great pleasure following these guys because of what they stand for. The devil is real and your independence, freedom, and integrity matters more than anything, nevere sell your soul, don't care what the price at the end is...I rather be poor, struggling but happy rather than rich, hot headed and depressed because people control my life/freedom f-- that. :| It's half the reason why a lot of rich ppl complaining or committing suicide now, the pressure is real out here in the fame world.  Thanks for this video fellas <3 x
Dame is a GENIUS
I value Dame alot. Luv his perspective & perception. He delivers his messages with righteousness, genuineness, substance & quality. Money can't buy that! Dame Dash is priceless!No bs. Doesn't get the credit he deserves. I got nothing but respect & Luv 4 Dame & Kenyatta bc im big of positive energy & good character!
I swear even back in the days I digged Dame,  real dude and people let media and false perceptions take away that his is a true Black Icon who did for our people,  y'all need to recognize.
Great interview. You are going to be old longer than you will be young. Invest for your older self. Salute to dame.
Dame Blacked on Harvey in a Hollywood restaurant back in the day! And, because of it they blackballed him! Now look what happen! Dame was always 💯‼️
Dame has always been ahead of the curve smart man 💯 but he will never get his credit because he's not up how he use to be
Great video brothers !💯🔥
Dope interview salute kenyatta and Dame 👏👏
Dame been sayn dope sh$& ; however, this sum of the most insightful wisdom he's ever said. ✊🏾
wait are you saying Jay z is touring cause he needs the money? please let me know cause if you believe that with all due respect I have end this conversation and use my energy to debate with people who know better
These jewels Dame dropping are truly priceless...he telling us the truth...so many ppl wouldn't dare to say what he did.
I doubt he knew everything that recently came out about Weinstein.  How you treat people definitely stands out pretty quick, but his discretions with these women was hidden.
Subscribed lets get dame back to the top again top dog ...to under dog ... back to top dog!
i dont understand people that dislike this vid???
That moment when you learn that Paris and France are two different places
Good Game. Thanks Kenyatta and Dame. Just subscribed please subscribe back.
Props to Dame for the code
Dame on point, always great content to help push the Culture in a forward progress. Appreciate the call to action guys. That's Wasss Up! 👌🏾
Spoken like a TRUE HARLEM CAT!!!!  LOVE DAME!!!  ALL THESE MUTHAFUCKA CONDOLING THESE FOUL DUDES
Dame always been solid. My guy
listen to his breakfast club interview from 12 min to 27 min some real gems take it in and learn
This is why I respect this man, because unlike other so call men in this world he has a thing he try to live by called honor and I think the world is lacking people that have a honor code and that the reason shit fuck up good echit code to live by.
WE LOVE U DD !!!!! \nENGINESHARK.COM
This nigga is a Harlem nigga so if you're not from n.y. or jersey most of what this nigga is saying is bullshit its a reason why he is in we t.v.
Typical sleazy,perverted, Hollywood Jews. Prop for Dame for standing up to him when everyone else bows. We get gangsta with our own and take shit from these devil's.
Dame dash is a legend truth love he stands for truth bless him and I stand with him. He should be the biggest mogul than jay z or other fake Money hungry dirty bastards
So why this scumbag jayz work with Harvey knowing what he knew?  Homie does anything for money?
smart answer by dame. he never dived into the main person but related to the lessons he is trying to push
So Dame. I dig everything you are doing and your speech and perspective on this society. However, if you recall. You threw Cosby under the bus a while back. But in this interview, you seem to dance around the issue of Weinstein. At least you use a different code of speaking about Weinstein. Why is that???🤔
Sit back and be cool😎....most importantly have INTEGRITY!!!
Dame chill\nTake this video down\nThey did prodigy \nNobody safe\nU talkin that pedo shit\nTake this vid down\n\nHarvey is in this position cuz he wants to be in this position
The power of restraint is true power. Love that dude!
Thank God for self awareness & problem solving skills. I always knew time would Favor Dame.
Please drop more videos...i would pay a subscription for this content daily
Thank you Mr. Dash for always sharing valuable insight
dame tells the truth. the truth is never popular or accepted by 99.999999999% of the people. Most people are scared of the truth. salute to dame for being his own man. extremely rare not just these days but throughout history
Dame you keep it 💯!!!!!
Dame always say the realest shht ever, I appreciate and enjoying your content and passion bro.Word!
I love Dame no homo
💪💪💪🤘📐📐📐

Dont trust any white person

Love dames talk and swag..but we all saw that boxing match..he ain't puttin paws on anyone.
Bro theres only gonna be 1 or 2 real niggas in a room full of people,,, its gotta only be like 100 real niggas in each city across america😕
No outcry about Michael Jackson molesting young boys, now Weinstein happens.  Male bashing is gender-baiting.  High school guys molested by female teachers don't give a shit and physically strong enought to fight back unless they are pussies.  That is the truth.
Ok...maybe you guys need to get a list of things to talk about and then break it up so you can have a week's worth of material.
HARVEY WEINSTEIN DEF BANGED OUT JAY Z
Black rappers fuck anything that walks.  Booty.
Everyone pays for pussy, especially MARRIED MEN.
Kenyatta,does you skincare product work for razor bumps
I would never want to work for Damon Dash. he thinks he's right about everything. and he's too arrogant and he act like he can't take advice from other people. and that's stupid! if everybody was a boss!. who would you have working for you😊 that's idiotic Thinking!... but keep being you Damon Dash,. and you wondering why you finish last..😏
Outstanding performance.
It's a shame that people find P!nk boring.
Perfect song, awesome voice, crystal clear live singing & so many of real emotions...
What's most amazing to me about Pink is that since she blew up in 2000ish she has consistently had hits... That is almost unheard of
Plays on the radio more than I'd like but still brilliant.
She is AMAZING! Always have been
Love Pink.
She sounds amazing live 👍
Pink is amazing! Love the new album!!
Fantastic, looks great, song is great, her singing is just amazing (has she always had such a good voice?) and she is gracious enough to give her backing singers their own “time”. Well done P!nk. \nI’ve seen her on Ellen’s talk show recently and she seems to be a really nice person to boot.
Cannot get enough of this amazing rendition. P!nk continues to fight the good fight. She is an artist who makes me feel it's worth spending my money on her music.
God, I love that woman.
I just love this song! ❤️
She sang her fucking face off... bravo!!!!!
I like this song
Your amazing  I love you 💖. Such an inspiration.  You rock it everytime.  Adding to my playlist
She’s got a beautiful voice ❤️
god damn this song is annoying, they play it on the radio constantly
Can't believe this shit is popular, music and politics should stay separated
She kills it every time. She can't do any wrong in my book. She is amazing
Legit thought snl was about to make fun of pink and I was like how tf are u gon make fun of a great song
And I want that outfit!!!!
Pink is amazing all her songs are amazing LEGEND 💜💜💜
I don't like it when stars plagiarize the King MJ
Everytin she does is kl
I'm just back from holidays in Spain where I heard this for the first time and I'm obsessed with it by far my favorite pink song.
WHERE IS THE JAY-Z SNL PERFORMANCE? UPLOAD IT.
P!nk SINGS! That voice my God!
such a powerful voice and message! amazing..
That song is awesome
I wanna see P!nk live so bad!
What about all the happy ever afters 😭😭
Please don't leave me, P!nk.
My god I love her. She has a powerhouse vocalistm she is a wonderful human being. She I'd bad ass. I am seeing her live in May and I fucking cant wait
She's always been great!
Her hair is effortlessly amazing all the time.
I like Pink because she can sing WITHOUT auto tune, meaning she has actual talent. As far as what ANY singer or actor has to say politically, economically, or socially, don't care and don't want to hear it in any manner shape or form, any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.
*_PINK IS THE BOMB!_*
My dream is to sing on that stage one day....
didnt know she was a Somalian pirate.
I know this is random but her guitarist back there looks just like Kristen Wiig! Lol and of course Pink is amazing as usual. 💓
Love her so much❤
Do a good deed today and click the link to my video to help me reach 10,000 views. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PO8EnOeMrRI

Slay queen SLAY!!!!!!🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
She is flawless
Such an amazing live singing voice in my opinion, a real breath of fresh air today, I've  been a huge fan of hers for many years and she never disappoints !! Can't wait to see her live at MSG next April !! U ROCK PINK and I LOVE YOU girl !!
The Magnificent  Pink . Loved that.
Such an authentic heart.  😘
Btw, anyone who agrees that Pink and Stevie Nicks would probably make an awesome duet? I would love to hear Stevie do 'Edge of seventeen' with Pink... *a girl can dream*
Come on pink your old stuff is much better, this is shite lol.
So happy she is back :D great vocals, good song and a nice outfit. Al together awesome
She is an incredible artist. I love her. She puts her heart so much in her music. I almost want to cry...
This song. Every time. So many feels. <3 P!nk!
Amazing voice, never a disappointment. Can't wait to see her next year in So Cal.
This woman is such a inspiring person \nLove her
She is and always true to herself. She is who she is, she is strong, she is a mother, she is a wife, she is a badass, she is so talented and she is what girls should aspire to be like!
She sounded flawless
Ugh! Yes, Alecia!
Pink is SUPER butch

Beautiful  voice of an angel . Lovely   Gentle soul.  Sweet honest loving caring human humble \nI pray that no matter where you go in your life your ready for more of life's journey \nGod Bless you
Thats how you own the SNL stage. amazing
UMMMM... 😮 amazing performance...! I can't help but feel like there is a deeper meaning to her lyrics and she's talking about how we as global brothers and sisters have been lied to and deceived by the few elite who are actually in power... F U, ROTHSCHILD, ROCKEFELLER ZIONISTS BANKERS ETC!!
The way she interacted with her backing singers nearly brought a tear to my eye. What an authentic beautiful inspiring woman.
P!NK is the new black)))...breathtaking, amazing, real, timeless...just superb!!!
that's what i call music
I had no idea she was that good. Wow. Great band. Really great backup singers.
Love this amazing, freakishly talented lady. Saw her on tour in 2013 and hoping to see her again! I love the fact she sings LIVE, no auto tune BS!!!
P!nk is such a M!LF  #SNL43
You should sing opera, Pink.  Great band.
gawd almighty-- what a set of pipes.....does play an instrument?
A great singer and songwriter. Love her
Damn...I'm 33 and P!nk has been badass since I was in high school.
Is that her real voice ... Because wow.
Can't wait to see her in Abu Dhabi 2017 F1. X.
Beautiful song from a  beautiful lady,
What About Us
How does her voice just keep getting better?
Real non fake pop star.
Incredible voice.
Speechless.

This is so dad...:(
Why does it feel like Harry Styles died and they’re doing a tribute to him???
he's so cheeky and mesmerizing, that's our bb ♥
He’s not that good at singing.
Harry and Mitch at 7:28 ❤️❤️ my ship of the year
He's got the slight lilt of an American accent....I'm not sure how to feel about this development...
I found this video ALMOST boring because I already know all the details of his career and all I wanted was the interview
The old footage makes me a lil sad
This guy aged twice as fast as everyone else
I think its time we admit one direction will never be together as a band again. Sucks but its reality
They will never get back together again  💔 one direction is over
This literally makes me so sad
Haha they pulled down his pants 🤣
I want him to continue acting. Dunkirk was so good.
Gay
Ugly
His hairline is already going :(
I really think being in one direction helped them and shaped them to became the great solo artist they all are now. 💕
He's always been my favorite. Love his voice and personality 🖤
They didn't need to rehash the One Direction story. Why not focus on more of his solo work
Somebody respond me this pls: is he officially out of 1D?
I have to click stop and go away cause I know I will be cry.
I love you Harry from Bolivia 😍
I feel personally attacked by those This is Us clips
I watched 6:10-6:17 like 167 Times now?? I just love him so much
6:15 i can't handle his cuteness
*HE USED TO BE A BAKER* 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Harry I love you soooo much how matter you are , and I can't wait to meet you
How can anyone not love this guy? He's the BEST EVER!!!
I'm so proud, I just want to cry honestly
When he's singing on the couch and his whole body moves because he's putting in so much heart😍❤❤
This guy has a future......!
‘I like to duck and dive’ 😂😂
First time hearing their songs.  He sure looks like the Artful Dodger, Jack Wild.
His lips are the prettiest colors. \nHe's still figuring it out? Oh.. he's just so humble. He sings the best of all singers nowadays.
I got honesty, vulnerability, hope, conviction and passion for his craft. here's hoping Harry remains uncorrupted by success.
why im so affected with everything that is happening to to him and in every little thing that he does? 😭
When ypu start crying in the middle...while the playback plays and your thinking 'where has time gone?' 'Where are my boys....I want them back...' its so hard.
here it is. THE LOVE OF MY LIFE, MY SUNSHINE, MY MOON AND ALL OF MY STARS. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU HARRY
His voice is amazing.
10/10 SUCH a beautiful human oh my gawdddd
He's dad's taste for music is mine ❤️
6:17 my favourite part of the whole video 😍😍
That’s my baby ❤️❤️
Harry styles in One Direction is like Justin Timberlake in NSYNC! They were arguably the most famous one in the group by far!
He has such a beautiful soul
God i love him so much
I'm so proud of him I'm crying
Harry styles is a legend
He's so down to earth, it's attractive
My god his voice is amazing
Very mature, some celebs can’t relate even tho they are older 🤷🏻‍♀️
He's always be my little boy, in my heart❤
look how Russian police tries to stop this mad  man\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sgcDVIfoD0
I love that he doesn't feel the need to put a label on his sexuality or put it in a box. People these days are so keen to labeling everything. I just think he's such a cool artistic guy.
I can't find the Only Angel live in the studio!! 😭😭😭
I still get a bit emotional seeing the X Factor moments. I'm so proud of how far he's come.
Zayn is the real inspiration here. Remember
6:16 My heart just melts completely 😍😍😍😍😍 He's soooooo cute
I just fell even more in love with him. He’s so genuine and sweet and just an absolutely amazing artist TREAT PEOPLE WITH KINDNESS EVERYBODY PEACE OUT
Only Directioners know exactly what it feels like to be proud of someone like Harry, and be sad at the same time. lol #DirectionersAlways\nI hope and wait for a 1D reunion, but if it never happens we know that the guys are always together in ways and that 1D will always be a part of them as much as it is us. I'm always so proud of Harry, Niall, Louis, and Liam because they've always been supportive of 1D and never regretted any of it. They show such respect to 1D and its fans and that's so admirable. Even if they don't reunite, they still bring us amazing music.
It's just beautiful!!!!💚
The One Direction clips had me crying wtf😩😭😭😭 proud of my boys❤️
esse sotaque me mata
I'm crying.
When I heard that x factor music....my heart......not again....... I cant😭😭
I'm only 23 I rolled my eyes so hard my head hearts.\nHARRY YOURE NOT 23 YOURE MY BABY SHUT UP
I am so grateful to have been able to see him this past week in Austin, he's so passionate about music and you can clearly see how much he loves what he does. Such an angel.
oh my god it's my dad 😭💓
Bring back the one direction feelings already!
this interview lays in my heart and will accompany myself till the day of my death
When they showed the 1d clips with all five members It felt soooo nostalgic
i don't think you understand how many feels this interview made me feel. Im so proud of him and how far he's come.
I'm not a 1d fan, i casually listened his album and got caught up. I really like his album, it's like a combination of the 70's and 90's. I'm was raised in rock and roll, so i know what i'm talking about, I have never in a million years thought i'll have become a fan of his. So, bye.
hes so cute im 11 im a big fan of one direction and harru
6:16 \nHES SUCH AN ADORABLE LITTLE BALL OF SUNSHINE I-
So refreshing to watch... not like a lot of celebrities out there who thinks they know it all. Wish everyone will follow his ways of handling his fame...
So glad to call this man my idol
Really good interview simple, forward yet told engagingly.
dear god he's so charming
He's so pretty ;(((
I love him so much!
He is so humble and that is one of the many things I admire and love about him
6:16 I MISS FROG HARRY BAHHHH

Es un amor tan adorable ❤️❤️
AND ILL KILL THIS ALL IN ONE DAY LOL
MY\nBODY\nIS\nREADY
this season looks less suspenseful and more like just sci fi, i really liked the first season because there was that sense of mystery, this trailer looks like it’s a lot more about explaining all those mysteries away so i’m kinda doubting it ...
That was an epic TRAILERR :O
Why does Eleven look like Frodo in that thumbnail tho
This was a bomb trailer
Me watching this wondering how they r going to top themselves after this season
People who make trailers don't get proper credit for it, I mean, this one was epic!! Well done!
I am actually excited for this
Gonnna need a download to that song ASAP guys
WHERE'S MY BOY AT FINN WOLFHARD
2:15 really he is still using a wrist rocket with that new weird monster, its like a young ling going up against a rancor in star wars
Subscribed, gave a thumbs up, and Hit the bell!

Love how 11 looks like a male. Way to go leftist weirdos. Push Transgender children but want gun control. You are all pathetic
I got teary eyed just watching it.😭I’m. So. Freaking. Ready!
After I order the iPhone X, I’ll happily watch this.
Reagan and Bush, Reagan and Bush, these are the words that bring me the KUSH
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT ELEVEN'S CURLY HAIR? DO I LIKE IT?! IDK! DO I HATE IT?! IDK!
The face in that thumbnail is so annoying
As much as i want it to none of this makes sence
CANT WAIT TO GET HOME FROM SCHOOL FRIDAY AND STAY UP AND WATCH EVERY EPISODE!!!!!!!!!!
That looks soooo good! count down begins!
It's such a shame the actors on this show had to go and ruin it by spewing out nonsense and propaganda. Cause the show was excellent. I'll hold it at arms length but check it out. First was great. Fingers crossed
Aaaaaahhahahahahahah. I’m so exited! It looks so cool. I have so much freaking adrenaline being released right now. Dude I am so hyped!
EXCuSe mE IvE BeEn WAItINg fOR thIs

Am I only one that thinks this looks kinda shit ?
Whats gonna happen to Eleven and Will??!!?? Like if you are asking the same question
So it Eleven still in the show?
Never expected 11 to have curly hair
I'm crying at this point! YES!
I can’t wait, I love this series
Omg Mario Odyssey AND stranger things. I'm so so happy

I CANT WAIT ANYMORE. ALSO AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS TO SEE MAX AND LUCAS TOGETHER. I ALREADY FEEL LIKE MILEVEN IS BACK. THEN ELEVENS HAIR IS 🔥. WHO THINKS WILL HAS POWERS NOW?!?? I NEED ANSWERS MY ASSUMPTIONS ARE REALLY GETTING TO ME!
Mark my words... Noah will be appreciated this season as much as he should have been in season 1. His amazing acting has gone underappreciated and unnoticed. But I think that since he has a bigger role this season people will seriously recognize greatness
Did anyone else get chills as soon as they heard the doctor say run? Just made me flash back to the first season when the lights spell it
I literally thought there was only going to be 8 episodes on season one but now I found this and I'm so glad that there's going to be a season 2 😂😂😂
Can someone please give me a show to watch that is decent. Doesnt have to be as good as riverdale or stranger things but decent
.\n.\n.\n*Read More*
Jay Leno fucked Conan in the ass so bad, Jay is a total dickbag.
Came here because of Dave's interview on Kimmel.
to quote Coneys' dad I see you found a way to make a living from your disability I should be $o disabled!
Dude this was better than Conans actual show
They didn’t invite Andy because they knew it would had broken viewership records. People would had ordered cable just to see this interview. People would had lined up for days. I moved to NY just to meet Conan and he ended up moving right before I was going to go see him. Support my channel and maybe one day I will get notice by the great one. Who remembers how the big networks use to push his shows so late. That was messed up but yet he was the GOAT of all Talk Shows. #justnyc #teamcoco #folow #me #return2nyc #conan #cocnanobrian
and Dave's story was (as told by him to Jimmy Kimmel) - the horse was supposed to take a crap on Conan's stage, and Conan was supposed to send the horse back, and Dave gets his money back. Love these guys.
When Steve shakes Conan's hand I can just imagine conan saying something like I just keyed your car prick
Apparently Letterman sent the horse so it could crap on Conan's show.... and he thought that he was gonna return it😂
What's even funnier is the horse was suppose to just go on stage take a crap and leave. It was a big joke, but conan ended up keeping the horse.
I love this man, “I don’t get guests like me.” Lol
i love conan but he sounds like he is on crack here
It feels so backward watching this. Conan is a far far far greater host them Colbert. Colbert is terrible lol.
Letterman NEEDS to be in the late show SOON! That would be amazing.
Hate Colbert, but had to watch this for the man Conan
Stephen: Do you have a farm???\nConan:No! I don't have a farm! Stephen you know me! 😂😂😂
Conan has never been nor will ever have much talent.
Conan seems to have lost it and not lost it at the same time in this interview.
Please, sir, you've been drinking XD Right from the start.
Conan is the best! <3
CONAN IS A FUCKING LEGEND \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Watch the Jimmy Kimmel segment when Letterman is a guest and explains why he gave Conan a horse and what was supposed to happen.
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN COLBERT !!!! THAT'S THE MAGIC !!!!!!! 4:27
I love Stephen Colbet, he's the original because you see he doesn't have a fake laugh compared to other host.
They need to give Fallon's job back to Conon.
Conon is funny as hell. One of the best!
This horse story is the best, LMAO!
yeah-huh. a horse trailer would never fit on a studio lot!
I hadn't seen this until I heard Letterman talking about it on Kimmel's  Tuesday show. Friggin' hilarious. Dave had a specific purpose for that horse.
This is so weird seeing them together, my eye immediately went to Conen with the thought why is colbert on conan?
I wanna cook breakfast shirtless for Conan
Conan is the dudes dude.
Garbage show.
Conan yells through this whoie show :{\nStill my Fav!
cocaine
Conan > noblet
Wendy’s
Fuck Jay Leno.
LMFAOOO OMFG I AM FUCKING CHOKING ON LAUGHTER HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH
Dave is such a piece of shit
I remember when Letterman had his last show, Conan told people watching _his_ show to change the channel at the half hour mark and watch Letterman's show that night instead.
He looks like a carrot.
05:29 lol the look of that horse .... priceless xD
Conan is practically interviewing himself. That ending was genius
Lmao at 2:35. Conan's getting into the story about Dave responding to Conan's tribute that he wrote and colbert interrupts like an idiot. You can see it in Conan's face like yes obviously Dave responded that's where I'm trying to go with this story that we've already pre rehearsed colbert is kinda ass
I dont get guests like me god
i've never laughed so hard at conan, but i guess i don't get to hear him talk so much on his show. when the music played at 9:23, i lost it
LOL at how they moved the interviews up on the playlist so people would bother to watch it on youtube. i mean i guess it is conan
A truck is too wide to get on the Warner Bros. lot !?\nHeheheh...   funny.
A joke from Letterman that went totally wrong lol
I love it when talk show hosts guest in other talk shows. It feels like a series crossover.
someone else tought it was funny how they fighting verbal about if they do call david latterman Dave or David Letterman...?
i love the story, but colbert can't give an interview to save his life.
Conan needs more smoke up his backside from the comments.
Conan should wear white shirts so his paleness is not as obvious
Conan and Bill Burr must host together their own talk show. It will fucking rule.
Hahaha love how Dave responded to this. Hope it will be an ongoing fun feud between them.
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth Conan
Conan is the best !!!
I love Conan so much<3
If Conan dies, I'll be in my 40s or 50s, so maybe 20-30yrs later. I'll probably stop watching late night shows. I'll also probably spend some of my time reminiscing this man. I never love and admire American host as much as I love Conan O'brien.
Was Conan high the whole time omg
‘My son is no longer being educated’
Stephen is such an a**hole and out of his league around Conan
Yes he is the best.
When I was a kid I used to think Conan was a short guy, he always gave off a short guy vibe about him. I didn’t really see him stand next to people too often but man when I saw him stand next to Jim Carey on one of his shows who was a very tall guy, I was shocked how much taller than Conan was. Also I usually never thought that tall guys had such high pitch voices like Conan does.
Dont f...in get the hype about conan, dave, letterman. Kimmel is funny. Conan is one bad lookin dude lame jokes, but then again I am a man so what do i know.
A Legend and a legend in training!
YOU DON'T EDIT THAT OUT YOU KEEP THAT!! THAT'S THE MAGIC, YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN COLBERT!!!!
interesting and fun story yet it sounds like he insulted david letterman.
I was hoping it was Secretariat
And now Letterman is pissed off on Kimmel about this story ahaha
Letterman responded to this story on Kimmel!
The Mandarin without melanine...
CONAN #1
wendys' burgers suck conan
dang stephen felt upstaged
Colbert isn't funny.
he is so overrated...
That was sublime.
colbert doesnt hv any class
TOP 10 ANIME CROSSOVERS
*girl screams* Please, sir, take a drink. Conan kills me with the little shit
Conan is off his Rocker lol
Been watching Conan since day 1. Just saw David Letterman's side of the story on Jimmy Kimmel's show and he claims the horse was supposed to be a gag gift...that it was supposed to just poop on the stage and be sent back. That kind of doesn't make sense though since the 2 cowboys took off. Plus, why would he think the horse was going to be on the show? I agree with Conan that Dave knew exactly what he was doing. Conan is a good guy finding the horse a great place to live.
loove this guy
5:20 Lady O'Brienne of f0ken Tarth!
there he is
A horse! A HORSE! A HORSE!!!
Who else came back here from David Letterman on kimmel
The horse was supposed to have shit on the sets of your floor... And you had to return it back to dave.
Talk show host - ception
Someone is lying in this story after seeing this, and listening to Letterman's take on the story today on Kimmel.
dave said the horse was supposed to poop on your show then you give the horse back not keep it
I honestly Though the titles said  “Conan O’Brien did ask David Letterman a horse”
Letterman sent the horse as a joke..He thought Conan was going to send it back after it “took a dump” onstage.
I HATE Colbert but I LOVE Conan
It was a joke! It was supposed to take a dump and returned back with a bad discount
Letterman rules! Colbert rules! Conan...not so much
Weird. I just saw Letterman on Kimmel talking about this interview so I went back to watch this too. For some reason, I get the feeling they're not really talking about Dave's horse gift. Almost seems like a metaphor for some inside joke or something. Also, I think I'm extremely paranoid so there's that.
Ive come here from Letterman's horse story at Kimmel's and what Im thinking now is that all of these guys are cool, old school hosts and the only one being excluded is Fallon and rightfully so. He just leaves an impression of a mama's boy, going through life by being handed everything and always wanting to be with the cool  kids but never cool enough. Conan remains my fav in the gang tho.
I would like to patreon some news as it has become one of my favorite shows and I want to keep it coming
Black crime is a black problem. \n\nIf you're put off by this statement but think the video's title is fine, you're probably a moron. \n\nNB4: LoL look at teh trigured mankin If there's anything men love more than rape, it's being rhetorically lumped in with sleazeballs. Also manspreading.
Do these terribly offendable boys honestly think anyone actually believes all men are bad and don't speak up and so on? No. You do not. So get off your soapbox. The problem is not enough do. Sorry you don't want to hear about it.  Do something or sit down and shut your mouths for once.
Why do I love Daniel O'Brien, yet hate Cody Johnson?
As a man it makes me physically ill to be associated even by gender identity with vile, dishonest and sexually aggressive scum like this.  Its not complicated, stop for a second and imagine if someone was going to do to your mother or sister or daughter what you are about to do, then if you think it would make you outraged don't f**king do it.
1. I live in Santa Rosa and have a penis. The entire thing was my fault.\n\n2. Hollywood needs an OSHA. Rapey keyholders need an agency dedicated to stopping them.\n\n3. The bro clubs in nearly every industry are supported by women who look up to them. (Envy them?)\n\n4. Wait a minute...is the entertainment industry a modern day Catholic Church?\n\n5. Yes, one should be proud to eat pussy.\n\n6. Powerful rapists are confused by gold diggers, and it’s a circle I would never be a part of. I just...I just don’t know how to feel! I’ll just be angry and ashamed I guess.
Men tend to react with fight or flight and women with friend or freeze wow never heard a more sexist justification for false rape accusations against men where there's even video evidence she was into it while simultaneously blaming male victims by asking why they didn't fight or flight.
The 'rape culture' thing sounds suspiciously to me like the modern day equivalent of this..\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria
Everyone saying Hey, why are you saying ALL men are like this? because it says so in the title, that's just false. The title reads: Why Weinstein isn't a Hollywood problem, it's a men problem. It does not say all men, just like it's not saying that everyone in Hollywood is a rapist. What the title and the point of the video is about is that there is a systemic thing in the culture of men in general which promotes this type of open secret behavior. Cracked gave multiple examples of many other times this open secret situation has happened outside of Hollywood. It's supposed to make you think about all the stuff that men let slide by other men that they really shouldn't. That's the point. Nobody is saying that you, or your son, or your husband is a rapist, pedophile or sexual assaulter. Learn to read.
The whole of this subject aside... Your petty joke junction segment is really not funny!
Fuck Hollywood. Fuck Celebrities. Fuck Fox News. Fuck Trump. Fuck the Patriarchy. Mkay, think that about covers it.
Our new brief, hopefully one time segment, Shut the fuck up, develop empathy, read a book, and listen to a woman.\nBravo Cody and you whacky Cracked kids
Every time Cracked is doing a thing about toxic masculinity and all that shit, I'm very grateful that they're doing this good stuff with their purview.
huh this seems pretty bias i'm gonna go somewhere else
A men problem? You fucking dickhead. Ive never once raped, or assaulted a woman. Neither has any of my friends, brothers, uncles, father or grandfather. Piss off with your agenda.
I see the pathology of the new ceo is only putting leftists in trending again. Let's blame men, not evil people. When the right uses identity politics by blaming black people for crime or muslims for terrorism, we frown upon it and rightly so. But it's okay when leftists do it. Sexual assault doesn't happen because you're a man, it happens because you have an evil streak resulting from not being able to adapt yourself (even if biology is a factor) to society.
Its a power problem not a men problem you are fooling yourself if you think it wouldn't happen if women were in power
its not my problem you fucking pleb
Do you know how easy it is to lie about being the victim of sexual harassment?
Pretty ridiculous to shit on Affleck for not playing the white knight and coming out against Weinstein. You want him to have publicly forced victims of abuse into an earlier confrontation with their abuser? How on earth could this be Affleck's prerogative? Say it and fix it! is an incredibly childish demand.
By the logic of the title All men are responsible for what another man does, so all white or all black people must be responsible for what their entire race does, or maybe all christians or muslims are responsible for others of their religion? MAYBE all women are responsible for each other as well, such as false accusations (not this case above), pregnancy, emotional support? \n\nRape is rape, forcible sexual fornication. Sexual Assault is as bad but not penetration. Again both are as bad so outside legal speak it does not matter how she worded it. He did horrible shit. But let's also not forget that people (not just women) but people lie about rape for many reasons, in this case I DO NOT think it is a lie at all but I'm saying we can't just take every accusation as 100% true, unfortunately this is why we need to prove it like any other crime. Because people can lie even about horrific shit like this.
I'm not going to be made to feel guilty because some man sexually harassed women. I don't feel guilty when a man stabs or shoots another person. Crimes should be punished accordingly but not everyone is the same.
There you happy now we made fun of wienstien, now can we please get back to trying to destroy Trump. Because Trump saying things about women is the same as Wienstien forcing his way into a women's home and violently fucking her in the hallway. The absolute state of the left.
I'd loooove to see this propagandist go do some on the ground reporting... like a news person. :p
Rose McGowan was silenced by twitter because she doxed someone by tweeting private email addresses. It doesn't discount the real story but it does feed into the argument idiots make by not discussing things that dont fall into (how true it may be) narrative..
4000 dislikes? I didn't know that were that many offended rapists subscribed to Cracked.
Bro...this was everything
Amen.
FAKE
Cracked is going all SWJ
🙌🏾
hahahahaha
Why pay for college when I can be lectured about how horrible all men are for free on  YouTube. 😒
It’s a Zionist problem.
ken doll had sex with a leggo.....holy shit
Wtf happened to Cracked. It's turned into utter dogshit. SJW, sexist nonsense. And this guy must be a self-hating piece of garbage. Anyone who believes that this is a problem with men as a whole is fucking retarded. It's not a male problem it's a HUMAN problem. \nAlso, fuck you. I hope you stay in your echo chamber of hate because it's what you deserve.  Keep hating things, it's what you far left do best. I hope you hate conservatives and Trump so much that you shrivel up and die. Fuck you. Pathetic scum.
We're marching towards a future where we're increasingly disconnected and power is more and more consolidated into the hands of a few.  This will only get worse.  A good evolutionary strategy would be learning to like being raped by powerful men for economic/social favors.
If i want your opinion cracked, ill go back to 2009. The future is now old man
This guy should shave his head that hair is a mess
Women in power are as big assholes as men.
It's a Jewish male problem
Rape isn't a problem it's a woman's problem
No, its career and cock thursty women's problem, you fucking dumbass
Petty Joke Junction?\n\na) You seem really too young for that reference,\n\nB) It was genius.
Many of these women spoke out quite a while ago.
I hate this guy ...
Hollywood is a JEWISH problem. We all know this stuff goes on all the time on Hollywood, if it is a corrupt organisation, the people running it are corrupt top down sort of thing. Who runs it?
Ever notice how when a Republican screws up Republicans suck but when liberals fuck up it's a grand overarching problem with humanity or something.
I feel like a nodding machine right now. Good words!!
Did they task a feminist with writing the title?
No its a very specifically Jewish problem within Hollywood that has gone on since Hollywood's inception. \nMorally depraved people.
its a jew problem mostly
So the clip of Hannety that apparently convicts him is him impersonating Bill Clinton. But not surprising that this guy can't recognize comedy or satire.
God. This whole video was like picking at a scab. Painful, but so good. SO GOOD. Cody, you fucking hero. #metoo
This is downright sexist
Wait what's the 5th reaction to stressful actions. Or did I mis hear him saying there was 5.
The show is developing well and this is an extraordinary episode. Petty Joke Junction was a great idea.
more anti  male   garbage  from cracked
I figured out why Cracked's videos have been much shorter lately. Their production budget for Some News has ballooned from replacing all the mics they keep, righteously, dropping.
His own face just found out wot hes done.that is sum deep funny shit.in fact harvey shud use it as his defence
This is stupid bc he only judges males not females they both knew what was going on , so please don't say it's only ben's fault (or who ever's ).Where is beyonce or taylor swift or emma stone ?? What they are women so they aren't responsible for keeping quiet ?? And what about women's harassment  on others (women and men ) ?
We are pretty fucked (im from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷)
uh... stop the narrative of rose mcgowan being silenced by twitter for speaking out... she was silenced cause she released a personal phone number in a tweet...  which is against their TOS...
I wonder what he did  to be exposed , this is probably a shame ritual or they are trying to distract the masses from something..
That clickbait title. Yeah, I agree though. Money and power corrupt people and lead to abuse of the weak. This isn't a new idea.
Yes, it's a man problem because the vast majority of men rape women. OK, Cody. Maybe you should try comedy again because whatever this is, it isn't working.
I could do without petty joke junction, but I guess you guys are trying to bring back the comedy show part of this.
Beware of the wolf wearing the skin of a sheep..\nThese azzholes feign a higher intelligence, while propigating a toughter cage for us to escape. RIGHT NOW the DOJ is working on a whole new bundle of laws to turn flirting between teens illegal, as long as a cop sees it in a certain way. Look into the new laws being worked on. Bloomberg is reporting on it like it's a good thing, and this show is just as much of a DNC sect as they are..\n( -_-).. not like we have anywhere safe to run to.\nGood luck people : )
not a Hollywood problem yet every single example thought up outside of Hollywood was still in show-business. Clearly no pattern here. Nope, none at all. It's just menz. Ignore that he spent the entire video explaining that the only reason this was able to go on is because the industry punishes people who come forward. Clearly not an industry problem at all.
Great video and points of discussion. Thank you from a female. :)
Nah...its an asshole problem. Give any asshole power, they abuse it. Man or woman.
Actually, Weinstein was banned for 12 hrs by Twitter because she posted a phone#, which is actually against their terms of use.
What's with the tie?
Fuck off you neutered pussy. If you want to take responsibility for other people's crimes KEEP IT TO YOURSELF, I and the rest of the male population want none of it.
thank you.
Fuck you cracked you mangina simps
Rape
(((problem)))
Fuck off
This was trash
Petty Joke Junction ruined this video.
Does this guy shower?
Pretty disgraceful gender stereotyping
Harvey Weinstein.  Roman Polanski.  Woody Allen.
Years there's been speculation of a large sexual deviant ring in hollywood, instead of going with that story, lets stick to disgusting sexist gender politics, keep people divided.
You're already blaming a whole group of people for a problem.  Hitler blamed a whole group of people.  Don't do that
How about mass chemical  castration? Then no more rape, or sexual assault. It's all guys fault. Let's just eliminate the problem. Besides girls can't sexual guys right, so let's just feminize the planet people. I Know might sound pretentious but when nobody believes what you say. You start to get a lil edgey with your words.
I find it really pathetic how the channel will only like comments that are supportive of this video, what a spineless coward.
Stop saying men. Say sociopaths. What you're doing is the same as showing five black guys that robbed a house, then referencing them as a black problem.
One minute gender is a ‘vast spectrum’. The next, when lefties need to defend one of their own, it’s completely ‘binary’ and ALL MEN are culpable for the actions of one creep. It’s totally obvious how unprincipled the Left are. Do you think were idiots? And I’m sure the next time a Muslim (who shares a foundational text with all other Muslims) commits a crime you’ll be back to saying #notallmuslims. But for now let’s lump all men together as though they shared one mindset. We’re all would-be rapists, apparently.
It's funny, you weren't saying it was an everyone problem when fox news was found out to be hiding sexual assault but as soon as Hollywood is shown to be nasty you turn the blame on everyone.\n\nHypocritical.
Absolutely disgusting the lengths these Hollywood elites will go in order to defend their corrupt and crime ridden industry. Whoever is responsible for this apologism should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. Videos like these are the reason Hollywood needs to burn to the ground.
You lost me with whole don't look badass with a gun in a fictional movie part. It's art, we watch just as many action films in Canada as you do in the states, action films have nothing to do with gun violence. You sound like tipper gore protesting songs with swear words.
You look like a cardboard cutout of Ben Affleck got Dorian Grey'd daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn. That was such a devastating mic drop, the mic on my laptop, the mic on my gaming headset, and my Shure SM58 all stopped working for 24 hours.
Because of reasons that have nothing to do with PATRIARCHY or FEMINISM,  rape is often an extraordinarily difficult crime to prove.  Often, it produces the same evidence as consensual sex, and if you shower, which is the first thing I'd want to do after being raped, that's the end of that.  If a man is prosecuted for raping a woman, the woman is going to called a liar, not only because of sexism, but also because when the evidence is the testimony of the alleged victim, that's the only way to mount a defense.  I'm not saying that  gender politics don't play a role in the proceedings, but the problems go even deeper.
Harvey Weinstein abused his power and sexually harrassed many young women but no, let's blame the men in general. \n\nLet's just paint all men as sexual harassers and that will make the world so much better. This is not a men problem, this is a screwed up person problem and painting it in this way is both disingenuous and dangerous.
Nice title, you dumb cunt how have you got a million subscribers?
the amount of downvotes this has kinda serves to prove your point that people really don't seem to give half a shit how many women are sexually assaulted by male celebs. its so sad and actually really really scary that more than 3k disliked a video with the message rape is bad
when I say men are trash, cody is not included
If you can only comment on this video about how it's not all men you missed the point and are part of the problem.\n\nYes, women are guilty of sexual harassment and assault, but not nearly at the same level as men. The majority of men who are assaulted are assaulted by men. Do some research. understand how statistics work and can be manipulated. We live in an unequal power dynamic, where men have the most power, so use your power ethically and stop trying to shift blame.
U look very tanned!♡

Congrats from a Benfica fun you are going up \o/
Diogo jota is incredible
As a portuguese is nice to see portuguese youngsters shinning on Wolves especially Jota..Wolves are going up for sure!
I hope we can keep Jota...
im a aston villa fan, well done wolves good game.
You're team is far too good for the championship, definitely going up
WOLVES AY WE🔶⚫️🐺
What a game, what a performance what a result! The wolves are going up! \n\n#COYW
We are to good for championship COYW🔶◼️🔶◼️
Absolutely battered them! Could have been 4 or 5 ! COYW
For the first time in ages, I watched a Wolves game and couldn't help but smile. It was like watching Brazil at times.
39 on trending lol
Signing Jota on a permanent is the most important part of the January tranny window !
Wolves squad is too good for the Championship, they will def lift the trophy in the end, can't wait to play in the Molineux in FIFA 19 ~~
Clicked like before the video began. Well done Wolves! Put these wannabees in their place.

Leo bonatini was in saudi arabia before coming to england, he wasnt that good when he was in saudi. But Wolves, is he doing goot this season?
First time I've seen the new team.  I think we at last have a new Peter Broadbent in Reuben Neves - he doesn't waste a ball.
champions league football... here we come...
Should have been 4-0 if not for shitty refs.
DIRTY SCUMBAG HUTTON KICKED CAVILEIRO ALL OVER THE PARK AND WE ALSO HAD A STONEWALL PENO SHOUT. WE GOIN UP ANYHOW, C'MON ME BABIES ;-)
It was a scintillating performance with technical ability that tore villa apart... a long way to go but that has to be a bench mark performance which if way sustain will see us promoted  !! WOLVERHAMPTON WANDERERS FOOTBALL CLUB  - pride of the black country  😚😚😚
Wolves for the championship. I am a Villa fan and I have no problem in realising that wolves are just too good for this league. Then ran the game, we had no chance. That Jota guy was immense, he would just pick up the ball and instantly turn on are defenders. Looks like a mini Griezmann.\nEven though people were predicting Villa as champions, I honestly saw us as playoffs, I do think we will achieve this but it will be hard.\nI know this might sound weird, but I would love to see us, Wolves and Birmingham pack in the prem, because them the derbies would be in a league where they do belong.\nFair play Wolves, you are a lock for the championship, great team, great fans, great coach.\n\n#UTV\n#COTW
Could we get this without the fake after-the-event commentary? Someone who knows the players' names and can at least feign some interest?
The force is strong in these lads! 🔶⬛️🔶🔝
John terry is a bawbag
Nice one Wolves from a baggies fan 😀
Proud of these boys, ay we?
Well done wolves proud of you
I am a walves  fan we are going up this season don't think we're finished top second place I reckon and we are going to the Champions League bring on Barcelona and Real Madrid win them all
We will give City a run for their money
The commentator is great at stating the bleedin obvious isn't he? it's headed over.. it's...just wide. I know you have to tailor things to your audience but even your average Wolves fan can see that!
I knew it was 2-0 begore video probably because i went and watched it at the stadium #WolvesForever
WOLVES AY WE - who are ya who are ya , thought you were gona crash our party - COME ON WOLVES our time is coming
Portugies all players are so good in wolves club the club have so many skillful players thanks the club it makes portugies team better
Completely outplayed them this is our year 🐺🐺🐺
Great win guys can you check out my little boys football channel little superstar thank you

Just the best football I've seen in a long long time and that includes Premier league and Champions league. Diogo Jota and Ruben Neves are world class players and the whole team is superb. Fantastic football and a wonderful time for Wolverhampton Wanderers FC and I love it
hahaha john terry you slimy slow has been
I`m glad Wolves are doing well but I`m really sad David Edwards is not at Wolves anymore. What a great and committed  player for Wolves he was!

Yo sabia el barca no iba a dejar ganar . Toma cholo pensaste que ibas a ganar
I don't support either team, but the whole shushing gesture towards opposing fans needs to stop in football. Why not show some class and run over to your own fans and embrace them for backing you, rather than stoop to the level of the average fan giving you verbal abuse for 90 minutes? The only time I can condone the shushing gesture is if racial bile is being aimed at players, that shit is NOT okay.
QARABAĞ  -ATLETICO MADRID 0:0 AZERBAIJAN BRAVO
It was a great game nobody won nobody lost it was a Draw go barca go messi go team go
Griezman was on a mission
Velverde really trying to fuck up Gomes career placing him RM. C'mon man give him a first place as a CM. 2 shots.

Porquería de resumen: en que no viera el partido parece que sólo jugó el atlético. No sacaste más jugadas del Barça como el penalti a Messi. Dedícate a panadero, esto no es tu fuerte.
amo el festejo de suarez jajaja NACIONAL TE ESPERA CRACK
Piqué debería salir y pedir perdón a toda España, sería la única manera en que los pitos cesaran un poco, por que esto tiene pinta de que en cada provincia que vaya serán pitos y mas pitos
vaya puta mierda de miniatura un payaso provocando a la grada que inutil
Fue un buen partido
Si os gusta el cine os recomiendo este nuevo canal de YouTube!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Xi-e7i8lKOE
Like si quieres que Claudio bravo vuelva al barça
Seguí haciendo goles Luis, es lo que molesta parece.
Los dos equipos están masomenos al mismo nivel.. aunque al Barça le hacen más refuerzos..
Porque el Atlético no metio a alex hunter?
Buen video y buen partido 😊 sigue asi OMG me encanto like
TODO EL MUNDO QUE ESTA VIENDO ESTE VIDEO SE TIENE QUE SUSCRIBIR AL CANAL, DAR A LA CAMPANITA I DAR LIKE / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrvuaofJ68Y
Solo ponen las ocasiones del Atleti o que? Y la primera de Messi en el minuto 1?...
Cuidado que pega como cotto\nNo sé cómo llegué aquí
Fue un buen partido y el resultado lo vi mas o menos justo por lo que se vió, en los últimos minutos si hubiéramos aprovechado varias ocasiones de gol probablemente hubiéramos ganado el encuentro.
Que pena el barca estuvo a nada d ganar
Bonito partido 👌\n\nMuy buena segunda mitad del Barsa :D
Vaya Criticas a la celebración\nA sido igual que Messi al bernabeu o Raúl al Camp nou\nCada uno celebra los goles como quiera
Miren a estos chavales jugar al fútbol https://youtu.be/nneL0I3l-dU
Puto vampiro de mierda que se vaya a comer pollas el jugador mas guarro de la historia de la liga y hasta que no acabe la mafia de la liga con sus presidentes corruptos siempre recibira ayudas este mierda club
Cruz Azul y el barca están igual
VIVA ESPAÑA UNIDA!!! MUERTE A LOS SEPARATISTAS!!!\nY AUPA ATLETI!!!!!
Soy del Madrid y hubiera merecido que ganará  el barca  porque el Atleti es una mierda verlo jugar marca o algo y a la defensiva,eso no lo hace ni el Málaga xd
Suarez mandando a callar al atletico k payaso
Suárez es dios
Messi el mago ,,desaparecida buahahaha 😝🖕🏽
Que grande Suárez mandando callar para darse un poco más de importancia por que actualmente no está entre los 20 mejores delanteros
Common play torres at the start not as a sub.. Torres is really ruining whatever career he has left by staying at athletico.\nThe playing style of athletico doesn't suit torres a bit and that is destroying torres
Man city are buying Messi
Jaaajj Luis Suarez is a boss, shut the fuck up wanda
Como siempre el atletico es griezman y el portero y 9 mas
Estos culerdos son un disco rallado,son tan aburridos que solo saben decir que Mezzi es el mejor de la historia,aunque empaten
Madre mía Griezmann...
00:53 si eso entraba ... 😱
Barsani hər halına sevirəm
AUPA ATLETI
Hala Madrid!!
Atleti demostrando otra vez las sucias ratas que son. Su fútbol es de vergüenza y que la afición lo apoye es denigrante. Así NUNCA serán grandes. Que fútbol más SUCIO.
El hándicap es real
Bien por Suarez callando a los españoles xd
Fursbol,deporte de niñatos campeones en tirarse y fingir,de ultras,donde todo vale,piedes subirte a una valla con un nene de cuatro años a decir bobadas que encima de aplaudirte te sacan en el dia despues,donde once pisa praos de octava categoria reciben mas ayudas que auteticos campeones de otras disciplinas olimpicas,que ademas,al llegar los juegos y quedar cuartos a todos estos fursboleros que no empataron con nadie a nada en su miserable vida les parece un fracaso de la hostia guiados por esos iluminados del marca y del chiringuito,esos Hermel y Roncero,archi conocidos por sus exitos y conocimientos(e imparcialidad :) ).Si un deporte de mierda,con una inmensa mayoria de aficionados de mierda,con unos valores de mierda,para una sociedad que apesta a mierda.Eso sin mencionar lo ladrones y defraudadores que son,ni de los MILES de millones de euros que deben estos hijoputas a Hacienda(o sea,a todos)Un delirio,pero como por el fursbol la masa traga lo que sea,desde pagar un dineral por un partido de ful un lunes a las diez,hasta justificar lo injustificable(peleas de ultras,jugadores delincuentes,presidentes defraudadores )una joya el futbol,vamos...

Awesome cover!! I am your big fan!! ..trying to be u..check out my channel - ayush ranka

As soon as I heard the song Games by Demi Lovato I came right to your channel to see if you have a cover of it, please do one!!
Don't ever stop doing covers. PLEASE!
you are such a good drummer
The way you mixed the high hats is really sick.
Where is slushii's credit? The drop in the midde was his remix of voltage. This wasn't just a remix of would you ever.
Wow. Cooper and Matt. Both were great!
Matt, don't tell Luke, but I like your covers a tiny bit more 🤘😎
Your the best bro!
You are my GOD\nRespect man hatsoff to your playing u are my idol\nLove u crazily\n😍😍😍😍

how do you tune your floor toms
The beat amazing work on that matt
WOW! So amazing job!!! My favourite now!! The drums fit so well with music!!! WOW! GREAT JOB!! This is so amazing, I am speechless!!
I would go away with you, Matt :D
Instead of just always playing video of the logo in the beginnings you should maybe do like cinematic shots of your drums or something. It'd be more visually entertaining and appealing.
Totally agree! And you know why.... In that music you can express your creativity to max power....  Because it is a fact. You are so far the best drummer of the world..... Nothing less!
I think you should cover some metal/ rock
How are you so good?
2:10 His hand movement reminds me of  Mike Mangini :P
Did you produce the remix? cuz we can't find that remix
Absolutely phenomenal.  I'm blown away, well done man.
Nice riffs \nYou brought back some metal there
I challenge you to play this song\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wpkeZ2kwpkM

best drummer alive, wish you would dual Chris Penney
Not original song covered = dislike

One little suggestion: Some slightly brighter colored pants would make it easier to admire your awesome footwork in front of the dark background and not only by hearing it! PS: killed it as usual ;)

aí você ver o título em Português...
Woo es nombre esta en español se que si los grupos de kpop  sacaran  algunas de sus canciones en español serian un éxito
Me gustó la canción 🎶 y más me gustó que le pusieran subtítulos en español 😍
Alguien mas pensó que ellos decías Extrañándote en español 🤔😕 igual me gusto mucho
Que genial está en español
por qué ahora le pusieron extrañándote ¿¿:D??
Ese título en español 😍😍😍😍
A A A QUE MÚSICA VICIANTEEEEEEE
Es emocionantes el poder ver el video con subtitulos español por partes de ustedes :3 :3 Hermosa canción I LOVE IT
So proud of my boys. \nIm crying.\nMakasih sudah berkembang dengan sangat baik.\nSo much Love from me east Nusa tenggara, Indonesia Melody. ❤\n\n#Nandha Puspita
i think i'm officially a new fan.. i'm really selective when it comes to music, and in kpop i only like bts, day6, bolbbalgan4, and i think i start to like btob too. haha what's their fandom's name?
I think Ilhoon looks his best with that hair cut
what the tittle of this song in english. i cant understand the hanguel
I sign in few account just to dislike this mv..BTOB is definitely a failed korean group compares to BTS EXO GOT7..I don't understand why still have ppl around to support this FAIL GROUP..btob are overrated..there are too many korean groups are better and more popular than btob... please check them out
First known btob from cinderella & Four Knights, since then I watched almost all their crazy videos and started to love their songs. My btob bias keeps changing everyday. Haha.
Whoever translate the lyrics into malay sub, wow its a great translation. Beautiful! 🌸
how can we be in top trending in youtube??????
Estoy muy orgullosa de ustedes y de ser una melody como siempre mv impresionantes . Ustedes son puro talento . Y uno de los mejores grupos . Pienso q deberian ser uno de los mejores grupos por sus exelentes voces y el encanto personal de cada uno . Los amare siempreee
Everyone has demons.
Illyana looks like she jumped out of the page; and that's the only things that looks remotely like the comic
Subscribed, hit the bell and gave a thumbs up! Thanks!
Uhhhh the was no plot in this at all...
Marvel is getting on the horror movie band wagon
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
Tryna pull a M Night Shyamalan? Horror movie with a superhero movie? we'll just have to wait and see if it's any good
Can’t say I fully understood it but I like it.
Still don’t get it.
I see Jonathan from Stranger Things\nAlrighty
Wait what the same new mutants from the comics?????? I guess not
Is this a marvel horror movie?
What the hell is this? This is not the New Mutants I was looking for.
If you were to copy the font of The Wall for your title, maybe don't play We don't need no education while you are presenting the title. Great trailer though, look forward to it.
Is that Bjork in the title pic? Lol.
Boring and cliche trailer.. the begininng was fine but they tried to much of shitty jumpscare.
this looks nothing like a marvel movie.....
My bet it's not actually ghosts but a psionic attack to break the kids so they can turn the kids into their perfect mutant weapons.
Popular movie most likely yes , good movie? no.
So from Logan a dramatic sad movie. To a superhero horror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI never thought the words superhero and horror would have been used together. I BLAME FOX FOR ALL THIS
They are ruining x men ever since gifted
Oh i thought this was X Men HAHAHAHA
I think education is the least of their worries now.
A horror x-men movie? I'm in.
The X-Men Franchise has quite literally now become the punk rock teenager that's purposely being rebellious and edgy just to gain their parents' attention because of how much they hate their popular siblings, but in turn have served to only anger their parents and lose society's respect for them.
Thought this was ninja turtles 3
*I really hope this bombs, and bombs spectacularly.*\nI grew up reading the New Mutants, as it was intended in the *superhero* based genre. And not some stupid horror slasher, with the these brilliantly, and lore rich characters just shoe horned in as the hook.\nFor all those millions who hate horror movies, who want see it, an awesome action packed movie, can be *watched and enjoyed by Everyone.* and not just the gore-lust-demographic.
wait what. I've never seen a horror by Marvel , this should be interesting
Ahh nice concept, they went out their comfort zone and took a risk. Will totally watch this and give a proper critique
Does anyone know who sang this version of another brick in the wall
Hey Alejandro, did you see this yet? Awesome web series Hey Sam, did you see this yet? Awesome: https://youtu.be/zTMlNc4jZPo
R.I.P. kids who clicked on this thinking it was a new teenage mutant ninja turtle movie.
This looks more like a horror then an extension of the X-men.
This is not a hospital, it's a haunted house ......
I'm just waiting for that hugh jackman yell
I saw that girl out of game of thrones
Welp....not going to watch this
Education connection try it for free! That's what I heard
The new season for horror story looks great
1:36 Just a random dude using the snapchat plug filter 😆
i dont think FOX can execute this well i think it will flop
X-man or horror movie I don't understand
what a twist?! X-men franchise with horror genre? i love both horror and superhero, and this thing combining those two
for all of you guys who dont understand this movie..its about a mutant name Demon Bear who feeds off fear.You should search the name and you'll understand
I mean not what I was expecting but I'm excited
way to rip the hell off of stranger things
help your boy out trying to fix my car anything helps Venmo: @johnleach16
X-men\n\nare not\n\nhorror movies
Wait, is this an X-Men movie? Or something else?
Looks more like a thriller movie...i was waiting for this movies to come out but the trailer make me feel a little bit disappointed..i hope the movie will be better
What?!
pink floyd..
Xmen?
Demon bear
Demon Bear?!
Geesh, this documentary about conversion therapy institutions looks terrifying...
To add on, I'm a little skeptical about the success of The New Mutants movie. I know nothing about the original comic but, if this is going to be an ongoing series (which, judging by the title it seems to be) then I don't see how the franchise will sell when the pilot is horror driven. Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!
This isn't a Fox X-Men movie; this is a horror movie-\nI love X-Men through my life and all the mutants, but this doesn't at all look like a Marvel movie; even in this studios terms; I wanted action and drama, but instead it looks like we'll be having nightmares instead. Bravo-\nI'll try to keep an open mind, but I'll see ya when the movie possibly fails the box office-
They should definitely do they same thing if they do The Morlocks. I can definitely see this type of formula for the New Mutants and The Morlocks. I’m really excited for this movie!!
Between Deadpool, Logan and (hopefully) this, one wonders why Fox even bothers with the “main” X-Men series anymore.
Ok since when is it cool to take a good 70s-90s rock song and alter it and put it in a superhero trailer. Ex: This, Defenders, Thor Ragnarok, and even though it's not a superhero movie Ready Player One did Rush
Is this a horror movie or a x men movie
Omfg.... Please tell me that is Chamber in the Dryer/Washing machine, looks so Badass!!
A horror xmen movie?? It's strange for sure, but I've seen Stranger Things.
Sansa : arya, what are doing here?\nArya : kill you, take off ur face, and be a phoenix.\n\nThe stark doesn’t give a s**t about whitewalkers anymore.
1:05 I see NoOne ...
ⓘ All the Money in the World FuIIMᴏᴠɪᴇ [ bit.ly/2gNdle7 ]
horror movie...eh, why not ? Fox made Wolverine a western. At least they are trying to innovate unlike Marvel which keeps spewing out the same thing every year....
looks lame
Terrible trailer.
https://youtu.be/Uf_-kpUJ4m0
WHERES WOLVERINEEEEE
Hmm horror film ?😌😌
Danielle Moonstar is beautiful.
Finally, some Magik love.
Disliked after realizing it wasnt \nX-Men?
Hm interestingly crazy
SO LITTLE VISUALIZATION
Arya 😍
Ridding that NOPE boat.
Rupture looks better
this looks pretty good.
I'll pass
interesting angle here ...
deadass looks like some remake from a 80’s hospital horror movie
Did I see Arya Stark?
So is the blonde chick magik or crystal (sorry not a new mutants fan)
I always knew Aria was a mutant 😍
I'm confused, is this x-men?
Looks great but where is Doug and Warlock
nice try indie horror  but you can't trink me with the marvel name i know you're just a B movie at best
Marvel's first horror movie?
1:36 I don't want no Smiley bullshit in my Marvel movie...\n\n\n\n...other than that this movie looks pretty good.
So... Marvel is doing Horror Movies now? I'll admit I'm a noob when it comes to comics but this looks nothing like what images I see when I Bing/Google New Mutants.
I’ve never seen a horror marvel film
Did I just see the girl who plays Arya Stark?
So... superheroes?  Sort of?  If you squint?\n\nI hope this isn't just a reaction to Logan's success as a gritty genre movie.  It seems like every time a dark, moody superhero film comes out, some suits get the idea that what gets asses in the seats is muted colors, depressing visuals, and violence.\n\nMan, if Marvel Studios were in charge of this I bet we'd at least have Warlock.  Crazy biomechanical mutant Groot guy!  Think of the visuals!  But, nah, Fox gives us... young adult horror movie thriller?
We make R-rated Marvel films.\nReally? Let's make it horror then!
are these the same mutants we would see in the xmen universe, i knwo theyre not the same characters but when they say mutants do they mean marvel mutants?
Cool how they're finding ways to keep things interesting with comic book movies. Hope to see X23 in New Mutants.
I feel like Jeonghan went through one of those Americas Next Top Model makeovers and all of the girls are jealous over how fierce he looks cause he got the best makeover
DOKYEOM I CANT BELIEVE YOU STILL IMPROVED DESPITE HOW AMAZING YOUR VOCAL ALREADY IS
Why is Jeonghannie's voice is so angelic 😂
I CANT CHOOSE A BIAS ANYMORE IM CHEATING ON ALL OF THEM\n\nAlso well done on trending in the uk!!
Oh shit this is so good my heart is crying
last night i checked this channel and it was SeventeenVEVO and today it is SEVENTEEN again.. anyone notice it?
Why this song hasn't reached 1Million views? It's freakin good.
The Jeonghan angel😇❤..*\n\n\nHe is really angel ,but why every day he keeps shining more than the real angel ?\nI'm in love with his vocal 😍😢❤
Is it just me or anyone else feels the same that this song sounds like an anime movie soundtrack?
the line distribution couldn't get so much better. we got everyone singing in every verse.
Jist woke up and this has stopped trending in the UK, thank you everyone who is helping us stream
The weather is so pretty😍
When I watch this , I was thinking who the heck is that first person singing ? Did SVT added a new member ? Then I realised , It was uri Jeonghan eomma .... I'm shook . Btw , have u guys seen my wig ? I think it flew away by this song .
So in ❤️ with them. 😊
Originally an ARMY!!!!But damn this is good👍
I LOVE THIS I LOVE SEVENTEEN.

Ya no quiero mas canciones con tonalidad  triste, pero me gusta
man... I think i’ve fell in love... I’m craving to know more about them, is there any seventeen fans over there?
I never understand why the views of Seventeen's MV is so low, like almost all of their Music and Video is a fkin Masterpiece. I Dont understand people
THAT BRIDGE WAS SO GOOD I WAS READY TO JUMP OFF OF IT

IM SO HAPPY !!!\n\nLOVE MY PR🇵🇷 NO MATTER WHAT!
Im watching this right now from Puerto Rico on my phone, still no power and we need a lot of help and hope. That concert was something amazing , thank you all for your help and support, THANK YOU! ❤

Great concert to benefit all in need / CHECK HOMENAJE A PR DE LYBETH EN :   YOUTUBE CANTO A PUERTO RICO LYZBETH
I wish I was there with you all! thank you to all that donated. what a great show! God Bless all my family in Puerto Rico.     $$$$$$ donate and pray for all the ones suffering
Sorry but why would you post a Spanish dubbed version of the English spoken parts. It makes it hard for people who don't speak Spanish to donate. This was such a beautiful event by the way and much needed with all that is going on in the world today to show that there are still people who care.
My thoughts and prayers  not only go out to our brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico who have been affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria but also to everyone in the other Caribbean Islands   who were affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.
Love that jlo got both Marc and daddy.
How are people disliking this video ?!?!!!
I think that all their performance was Great
Marc Anthony in the last performance.... WOW!!... Heart and soul pure Boricua that bleeds nothing but his land.... - It could be you tomorrow, it could be you tomorrow.. and you know what?? WELL BE THERE!!!... - Que viva la raza Latina!!.. PUNETA!!!.
What an amazing event, Together we are one, Puerto Rico God is with you!!
Beautiful Concert. All you guys were amazing 💕
Gwen has not aged one bit!!! just Beautiful!
Make Puerto Rico Great Again!

Impresionante  WOW... Hermoso... Que orgullo ver tantos latinos unidos... Y ver como unidos hacen uno... un honor ver tanto talento junto... no pude contener mis lágrimas... Orgullosa de ser boricua... extraño mi isla... como en ella ningún otro lugar...
Este evento sólo fue para ayudar a las personas de Puerto Rico?

Latinos y gringos unidos para una buena causa 💕💕🇻🇪🇪🇨🇵🇷🇺🇾🇺🇸🇨🇺🇩🇴❤❤❤❤

La cancion que Ricky canto al final en ingles,aunque el es tremendo le queda grande y no va con el pero me hubiese encantado  escuchar a un Jonh Secada cantandola ! Pienso seria perfecta para el !
los buricuas son unidos y son buena gente soy Dominicano somos hermanos pa lante
Marc Anthony, the best presentation ♡♡♡♡♡♡.\nPreciosa te llevo dentro, muy dentro de mi corazon... Y mientras mas pasa el tiempo en Tiiii se vuelca mi amooor... Puerto Rico Se Levanta. Mexico, Se Levanta. Texas, Se Levanta. Santo Domingo, Se Levanta. Florida, Se Levanta. Cuba, Se Levanta. Las Antillas, Se Levantan. Pq somos una raza y nos ayudamos como uno solo.
No tuve oportunidad de verlo en vivo, pues aquí en PR aún no hay electicidad, por lo menos para mi área, nos llega y se va pues el sistema está vulnerable. Pero de corazón muchas gracias a todos los q de una forma u otra formaron parte de #SomosOneVoice y cada una de las personas q donaron dinero, a los artistas q donaron su tiempo, para levantar fondos para ayudar a PR, Las Antillas, Santo Domingo, Mexico, Texas, Florida en fin a todos los q de una forma u otra fuimos afectados por la naturaleza. #Gracias
Did anybody notice that all three men JLo had a sexual affair with including A-Rod we're all there Under One Roof LOL I don't know that's kind of disgusting to me but I'm glad they did it it's all about Puerto Rico shake that ass Jennifer Lopez Shake Your Money Maker I don't think Selena Quintanilla Perez would have needed her to shake her ass to raise money her voice and her beauty and her character and her personality and charm is all she would have needed and her love for the people
Que bella canto rihanna en español!!!!
That Plena tho.
Marc anthony was so into the song he played at 2:57:15 , that he screamed at loud PUNETA!!!!! lmao
Daddy yankee one of the best ones love it! Magic too. Es cosa mía o el público estaba muy dormidooo  😖
i hope JLo help her family in puerto rico , she need to start to help her family first .
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT SONG DID CAMILA PERFORM TO? I LOVE HIS SONG!!!
You know its not kinda fair because if you win, then Jj's shit and its a miracle, but then if Jj wins you just say your knee isnt well and so on.

https://youtu.be/ZpRb7DSQH2Y watch this, “W2S ksi diss track but it’s joe weller”
Oh God, he is so damn good at telling stories!!
Turns into Walter White at 4:10
Like a blind man at an orgy, I was going to have to feel things out.
Maybe the travel agent said 15 and hopeful Brian Cranston heard 50 xD
Who else read the title as Bryan Cranston Got Caught Having A Sex Tunnel In The Alps
Anyone else notice Colin Farrell has his Fantastic Beasts haircut? I hope he comes back, he was one of the best parts (Much better than Johnny Depp).
Hitman really let himself go
He reverted back to the hilarious Hal from Malcolm in the Middle days
Graham is better than any American talk show host. Easily. Stupid scripted yanks.
i like how he is pants in america but says trousers in the uk..
Wow his story telling skills are great.
0:01 That's an odd way to turn your head Colin
This is great hes amazing at telling stories
Lol 15 minutes wasn't enough for him?
I was like 'how did he have sex whilst driving his car?'  Oh it was a train.
Poor mans jonathon ross
I knew it! Bryan is that stranger in the alps John Goodman mentioned in the TV edit in The Big Lebowski.
Best story teller ever! love him!
I could listen to Bryan tell this stories for ages!! XD
He is a great story teller!
What a legend celebrity of our times a one worthy of celebrity title
This story sounds like something that Hal and Louis will experience.
47s put on the beef
easier with woman on top in car
Formation test lab actress flesh continue readily occupation address.
Colin Farrell: Hold my beer.
Guys who play serious roles on TV are the most funniest people irl
Dont watch the video, just watch 1:50
Just how?
Haha such a funny dude
Should of have had him on the red chair!
What I love about ‘The Graham Norton!” The guest combinations , I came to see the guy from breaking bad , also got Nardole (Matt Lucas)
I'll take 15 minutes with Colin anywhere under any conditions.
Thank God for Collin's reactions lol
You know what would be funny, if we found out he had sex with an alp in a tunnel.
I would invite him to my party!
he told this story in a interview like a year ago
Tunnelling a tunnel in the tunnel.
Maybe the agent said 15 minutes, but he heard 50.
I Love You So Dam Much Graham Norton!
Hahah he’s so good at story telling 😂👌🏾
I can't stop laughing at his impression of italians 😂 so on point expecially the gesture at 3:59
Mute the sound. Bryant's visual action is more interesting and easy to understand lol
Bryan really knows how to tell a story. He is brilliant!!! :D
SEE WHAT HAPPENS\nWHEN YOU FIND A STRANGER IN THE ALPS
I can see the memes
hasn't the guy got any shame? if I caught someone exposing themselves in front of my kids, I'd beat the granny out of them.
I'd love to see Bryan and Colin in a movie together
Cranston always tells the best stories. Had Cumberbatch and Redmayne on the floor last time. That countdown to the sex tunnel was hilarious! 😂
I'm I.T
Say my name
Say no more 😂
Hot videos http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5uxdP9lmOrTlkmHjG8owmnnZ5ikZsmQ9
Amazing story teller. Lol
I love him
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Great story. Xx
Amazing story :D
All hail Bryan Craston for this story XDXD
Awesome
lol hes a natural...
best story teller, him and Chris Pratt
Colin’s hair looks awesome! Very 90s. I love it.
Bryan is not Walter white but he really hal
To Watch More Click ==>>https://goo.gl/HPfvkf
he Awesome in Malcolm in the middle...
He's a master story teller
Absolutely love the man!
god this man is funny
This is the most ridiculous awesome story everrr LMAO!
Bryan Cranston is just such a great guy! Comedic, theatrical and plain nice.
How can you not love Bryan Cranston
That was a really good train noise
I’m just seeing and hearing Hal
Bryan Who?
norton show best
Such a likeable guy.
been watching Graham Norton since V Graham norton on channel 4 , who remeber when Big Brovaz came on
So you could say, he found a stranger in the alps..
Say no more fam.. 😂😂😂
Say no more. -Bryan Cranston 2017
me lol
Crystal!  ;)
He is the one who knocks.Makes sense 😂😂
What a weird story to tell lol didn't think he'd go into details lol god damn it Hal! Lois must've been mad
I love how he told this story word for word on Conan a couple months ago. Cranston you dirty dog
HELP! PLEASE HELP ME GET TO 10,000 VIEWS WITH NO SUBS!!!
Or did his wife say stay out of my territory!
Ukh that farrell such a hillbilly... doesn't know how to act in public... go dig up some potatoes 🥔....
Must say ., Brian's 📓 makes a great *read., \n\nSadly, no bits @ v% 🌹🎦 event., or London specifically., wit 'Malcolm [ the Middle 📺🎬'. \n\nGlorious last line by moi Total *mC2F by Colin. 💙😎
This would have been an awesome if they hadn't had Bryan Cranston on the show. He is intolerable.
Bryan Cranston is a SOCIALIST LIBERAL QUACK who wants to DESECRATE places because he’s a LIBERAL and LIBERALS destroy everything and want to destroy a generation of proud Christian republicans like myself.\nNO TO SOCIALIST QUACKS\n\nTRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP
So night shows can talk about sex but invidual creators will get punished for it?
The Heisenberg part of Bryan's brain kicked in when he said Get Off Me
Recycled by Colbert interview.......
Argo w Ben
SATANIC HOLLYWOOD
Colin Firth is HOOOOOT
From his gestures and that cross that he made I can totally belive Colin is gay
Does anyone else think that Rich Evans is cute? If it's just me, I'm okay with that.  Sharing was never my thing anyway.....
I looked up MrPiggyEats on youtube (knowing it wasn't real but hoping deep in my heart it was) to find nothing. Rich Evans, you fat elderly fuck, I demand you make a sub-par fast food review show that takes places in your car with heavy undertones of sadness and desperation.
The thinking man's comic book movie. Yeah, it's making me think about watching something else.
MrPiggyEats needs more views people!
Holy RLM masterpiece. If you released the outtakes of making this video that would be VERY COOL.
Watching these guys talk about and make fun of movies has become significantly more fun than watching movies. You just broke hollywood. Grats.
I just wanna thank you guys for nailing these millenials and their reaction videos that plague Youtube. It's unbelievable just how horrific and popular they are. Thanks for pointing out their restless meaningless  bullshit.
This is becoming so good it's now hard too watch.
Holy christ, I'm going to suffer a rectal prolapse I'm laughing so hard.
What the fuck is wrong with the audio?
By far my favorite episode of The Nerd Crew.
The way that they effectively take the piss out of not just Star Wars fans, but literally every single Internet-based modern trend (and the people that perpetuate that) ever is amazing. They are really good at it.
Funny because it's true.
I can't wait for their review of the last Jedi.
Thank god this video was made.  YouTube “reaction videos” are the stupidest things on this earth. My god. So many morons making reaction videos smh.
Why....\nTHE HELL.....\nDoes Mr.PiggyEats NOT exist?
The world already changed
god rich evans makes me laugh non stop
So true about the dumb jocks being Star Wars fans.
Mike's suit cracked me up :DD Love you guys!
When did Aquaman become a Dothraki?
On Re:peat
Well-- that's kinda tasteless.
The joke is that it's redundant.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I would absolutely watch Rich eat that entire burger.
What a pile of mess
This came out days ago, and I just spent all night last night trying to sleep, haunted by Rich Evans saying in the house over and over again.
the joke is wearing thin. but I guess that's the point
Do they actually own all of that Star Wars shit?
Easter Egg?  Jason Mask slightly hidden to the left behind Jay.  This had to be recorded Friday the 13th since it was uploaded the following day.  If so, I'm guessing it was Jay's idea?
Now I can’t wait for your next reaction video to the next trailer to the next movie! Very Cool! \n\nKeep it up, RLM!
I can't wait until Starwars becomes the next Scientology! Tom Cruise can play 50 year old Han Solo!
I can't believe The guy from Screen Junkies is accused of being a sex pervert or of sexual harrassment. I would have thought it was Rich Evans the whole time. You think you know the world. \n\nCheers Rich Evans. and Screw you Jay for being friends with Andy Signore
Nothing like watching this while trying to sober up and eating a hungry man tv diinnnerr
Haha that Justice League looks shite.
Thanos, in the houuuuuse!
And don't forget about Poop Again Twooooooooo. Jack Packard in the hoooouse!
Even by RLMs standards, this is a truly exceptional video.  Their magnum opus.
That Chrome Stormtrooper boss (no, I don't remember her name);\nThe producers must have seen Game of thrones and told the director that they wanted the big blond sword fighting woman in the movies. I am pretty sure this is how plots are created nowadays.
I lost it at the end
_The world is a perpetual caricature of itself; at every moment it is the mockery and the contradiction of what it is pretending to be._ --George Santayana
I wanna meet the 12 year old StarWars fan that watches these episodes and doesn't understand...
might be the best nerd crew episode yet, thanos in the house
You guys keep hitting the fucking home runs with these.
12:01 Thankfully, I looked back at the screen just in time to see Mike sip from his porg mug with his pinky extended with that goofy look. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, Thanos ᶦⁿ ᵈᵃ ʰᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵘˢᵉ
That trailer reaction was one of the funniest things RLM has ever produced.
It aired during football because Disney owns ESPN and it is the only time people watch ESPN now.
if you are one in a million that means there are 6,000 people just like you
That fuckin burger looks like a coronary in a box 🍔 📦
Can't wait to go on opening night for everyone to clap and scream at every little fucking thing
These guys just get it.
I'm sorry to say you should have waited a bit longer in order to analyse the Disney™ Han Solo™ Solo Film™ SOLO A Star Wars™ Story by Lucasfilm™ a Disney Company™
Please do best of the worst on Netflix The Babysitter by McG. It might be the worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. Holy shit its so bad it defys logic.
please never stop making this series, it's hilarious
This is the most sarcastic thing I've ever seen. Haha...
I didn't watch it, but I'm sure it's great.
These guys are my VHS player's spirit animal.
This is the best Nerd Crew since the first one.
I could power my car on this sarcasm.
When do we get the response video to the announcement of the title for the Han Solo solo movie--SOLO?
As much as I love these satires. I'd like to see what they really think the new movies will be about. They were spot on for Force Awakens speculation, which granted wasn't that hard considering it was such a retread. But I'd still like to hear from them.
Holy shit. This was done with care.
We are all individuals.
How long until it's revealed that Mike's been sexually assaulting Rich? Now we play the waiting game....
I actually did not realize that people made reaction videos to trailers until now. Humanity is not worth saving.
Where did Mike find that -hideous fucking- very cool jacket?
I guess RLM doesn't just hate Star Wars fans, but they also hate Nerd Crew fans XD Stoklasa in the HAH-OUUUSE
When can we expect to see a porg standalone film?
This video was\n\nVEEERY cool. Gotta clap for that.

please don't stop making these, the parody is brilliant
Mr.PiggyEats is a great fast food review channel. I can't wait until Evans eats his gun. I'm sure that the last thing he'll taste will be good.
OH MY GAAAAAAAAAAWD
I don't even watch these shows and I recognize these cookie-cutter personalities and canned reactions so well, it makes me want to die.\nVery cool.
I saw that a CGI Penguin was replacing Han Solo and I clapped! I hope Kylo Ren doesn't stab it, before we find out if it or Rich shot first.
I love the biting satire in these videos, but what they are making fun of is so unbearable I can barely make it through these.
I need that jabba mug!!!
I love popcorn.
Anyone else wanna see RedLetterMedia review The Fairy Odd Parents Live Action Movie?\nCause I wanna see RedLetterMedia review The Fairy Odd Parents Live Action Movie
Rich Evans porn is the best porn. It's so dense, it has so many things going on.
You guys caught lightning in a bottle when you thought up this idea of parodying all the tools on Youtube promoting corporate products...and you keep bringing the social commentary so hard like it's nobody's business.\nAll power to the Nerd Crew, now and hopefully forever. Darkseid...in da houuuuuuuusse!
I wish Rich Evens would adopt me
Spoiler alert! Porking a porg.
Ah Poe's law....
Jeremy?!!?
Very cool
I would deadass subscribe to Mr. PiggyEats.

How dare you hack frauds make fun of TheReportOfTheWeek.
Very CRUEL. VERY CRUEL.
Oh I get it they're being ironic
Fuck reaction channels !!!!!All u The reel rejects crap!!
*...but Batman says in the film We're stronger together.*\nDoes this mean that the corporate hacks at DC/Warner are _still_ riding Hillary Clinton's shriveled-up futa dick??
4:50\nI dont get it, is this supposed to be a Parody or simply the fact they hate new Star Wars and feel the need to shit on absolutely everything that isnt the sacred Trilogy ?
I need to find a way to filter out actual reaction videos. They make ruffling through stuff like e3 trailers a bitch.
Oooohhh.. you are SOOOOO edgy! You think starwars are overhyped. Sooo Edgy!
My favorite part is that they nicely decorated the set with all those toys and then just plopped down a big pile of Gamorrean Guards. Nice touch.
How many times are you going to make the same fucking joke?
I guess you guys feel my pain. Our culture needs a defibrillator.
Huh, they really don't like Screen Junkies....    Can anyone clue me in as to why?
not funny
2000 views, clearly trending.
you look behind the catchphrases and there's nothing there. spot on.
That was fascinating. Find it a real relief to listen to someone who has their head screwed on about this.
That's Sir Starmer, QC, in reply to Her Majesty's Government, Warmongers LLC .. And limited they are.\n\nArdent Brexiters seem to think Democracy is the dictatorship of majority, or that a prerogative is a holy sanctity that mustn't be disturbed in any way. Well, it's not, rather a proper discussion towards consensus, which requires all parties to get off their high horses. Repeatedly shouting we decided and that's it! is not a democratic practice, in fact that's warmongering. Prolonging transition period  or another vote is not reversing Brexit or undemocratic -- in fact it's a common practice as many states and nations around the world review and re-vote decisions. And yes this practice is true had the opposite happened -- had Great Britain chosen to STAY in the EU its citizens should have been given another opportunity [to vote leave] in the future. These decisions go back and forth between the electorate, politicians, officials, etc.\n\nAnd that's DEMOCRACY. So shuffle the deck and play another round (i.e. talk on how to do a proper Brexit).\n\nVote-Talk-Resolve X 10000 times.
Trying to kick the can down the road.   Still face stark future post brexit.
Peston never used to act like that, Where's he got this exaggerated persona from, he seems to have flanderized himself.
Yawn!
Spot on as usual Kier. I can get used to reasonably detailed but straightforward answers.
It's disrespectful not to refer to him as Sir Keir. He is a knight after all.
All political parties continue to sell the message that there are only 2 options,\n1. Get a good deal. \n2. Leave without a deal. \nBut there is clearly a third option, \n3. To stop Brexit now and then negotiate with the EU from inside the EU club backed by a strong leave mandate. \n\nThe precipitous lodging by the May government of the Article 40 notice was clearly aimed at solving internal party problems with no real consideration given to the interests of the UK or the EU.\nAt the same time the opposition parties allowed the Article 40 notice to proceed without a great deal of opposition or question for fear of losing support from Leave or Remain voters. \n\nThis was and is the state of the political process in our parliament, which has lead a government with no clear mandate to enter UK/EU negotiations in an unplanned, uncoordinated and unduly optimistic fashion. \n\nThe present state of the negotiation is now generally accepted to be unlikely to result in a beneficial outcome for anyone. At the same time our parliament is more divided than ever and the political parties continue to follow a path which could lead to the breakup of the UK and the destruction of our democracy.\n\nWe (the voters) need to save our country from our political parties and our political parties from themselves.\n\nTo this end we ask our Members of Parliament to put aside party loyalties and Pledge to serve all our people in a Unified Cross/Party National Government mandated to stop Brexit now.\nhttp://www.fvvra.org/the-fvvra-pledge\n\nGordon Middleton\nFVVRA.ORG
So, labour wants the ECJ to have some sort of hold over Britain.
Strange because Keir Starmer said on BBC's Daily Politics that if The Government chose to leave without a deal, The Labour Party would vote to keep us in The EU. The talks should have been trade based instead of firstly focusing on Citizens Rights, The ECJ and Divorce Bills. I, like many others, voted to leave and if this is stopped for any reason, then democracy is dead.
Nowhere in Article 50 does it say 'With a view to a future agreement'!
how much do you have to pay google to be trending?
We were told we would 100% get a deal and the EU would never restrict German manufacturers or French farmers from selling to us. A no deal is the worst possible deal.
Keir is an Agent of the EU.  Be careful Briton, many traitors about.
Establishment traitor.
Mint and grey shoe my mum said pink and white straight away
I really want someone who can play guitar, because then they can play me a song to fall asleep too 😌
Well then what did everyone see on the thumbnail ..

I agree with Joe about the shoe colours
I see pink and white
The shoes I originally saw in blue and white, but when I thought about it I started seeing it in white and pink and now I can’t see it the other way
joe do another video of you playing guitar and singing you are so so good at it like so he sees this every1 if u agree
The shoe is pink and white
i see it different from different angles but i first saw pink and white
bOI I THOUGHT BYRON WAS THE LEAD SINGER OF COLDPLAY
It's a picture of a pink and white shoe that's been altered to make it appear grey and turquoise. Look at the greenish hand.
You both look like ET in the thumbnail
I keep on looking back at the photo and it keeps switching from grey and mint and then pink and white... what is happening?!
Joe playing the guitar 😍

It’s pink and white 😂
It's mint and greyyyy 😂

There must be something with my eyes because with the dress I saw white and gold and now I see mint and grey, I can never see the opposite?
I see pink and white!

I see grey n greeny idk how ppl see pink, even tho it is pink n white u r looking at the same photo on the same phone it’s ur eyes that make it different
Hahahahaha the shoe was glow in the dark!!!!! Silly! ❤lol
Countdown music with the slow zoom , but when the abrupt ones came I was crying
PINK AND WHITE ITS PINK AND WHITE ZOE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR AGREEING WITH ME
Literally the shoe...Im in  Warrington and its viral on Facebook!!!Im 9 (Im on my nans acc tho) And me and my brother (17 year old and 3 year old brother) Say that its still grey and this mint colour and my brothers girl friend said that its white and pink and me and my brothers (Im the only sister ;-;) were like ITS GREY AND MINT!   >:O And ive seen it  5 times...and its still grey and mint. xD
“ why have u got a bawbag on your chin bro “ 😂😂😂😂😂
I agree with joe
I saw mint and grey on ten shoe and on the dress I saw white and gold
Make sure the plant has enough sun water and fresh air
On my laptop I saw it as grey and blue and I showed my parents and they only saw pink but I didn't see pink? But looking at it through your camera it does look pink?
I see it grey and mint
i’ve always seen it as mint and grey, but now that i looked at it through the phone i saw pink and white, but whenever zoe would move the phone i would see the mint and grey so it kept changing with me
Omg when I first looked at the thumbnail​ the shoe was pink and white but then I looked again and it was grey and turquoise?!?
Im with joe! Grey and mint all the way😂
People are just stupid. If people could tell the difference between real and fake they would see the photo has been edited.
Joe had his capo on upside down on his guitar
It's mint and grey! looks nothing like pink and white.
That mask is horrific omg haha 😂😂😂 All I can see is mint green and grey!
It's gray and mint. No matter how hard I try I just can not see pink and white...
Joe I think the same as you
I see pink and white
i cant be the only one that sees pink & mint 😂
Why can't people realise you can buy customised vans 🤦🏼‍♀️
It's a Ballchinian 😂
10:33 i actually watched the video that already came out and then i started watching this vlog, and thought it sounded familiar
Go into a picture editing app and use colour/color select, its just shades of blue and grey...
i can see both colours
i swear sometimes I see mint and grey and other times I see pink and white
I see mint and green but it’s actually white and pink
No body gives a shit what colour the shoe is.
Pink white
These is red bottoms

The fact that the world number one diver does cheap Halloween costumes while living in prime estate astounds me. I feel so blessed to be living at this age and time.
The sound he makes when he takes the box off is hilarious
Let me just say that, Lance has his hands full with you!  LOL, what a clever boy you are!
Love it. Trying to get out to use the restroom may be a little difficukt but lovw the idea and outcome!
Hilarious! Looks great, hope you really wear it out and about 😬
Is it just me who thinks the lego head looks like someone who's shaved and now has blood and big bumps all over his face😂
Shite
Make one for ur husband too.. its cute🎃
Love this video😂 such a cute costume💗
Did you ever want to be a Blue Peter Presenter???
Hey, why aren’t you diving?
when are you going to do another live workout?
Woah i didnt know you had a channel I've subbed and liked and notifacationed
Oh my God. I'm so in love with you
wait until you try to sit down, LOL.  I did this one year, dressed as a bottle of aspirin-could NOT sit, haha.
AHAHAHAHAHA 515k 😂😂😂😂😂 I don’t think you should be on the internet
Is it possible to sit down in this costume?
That's actually pretty cool and creative =)
When ever he comes out with a video, it reminds me of swimming. ♥

I really want to see how you got out of the full costume again without cutting anything because I would be stuck forever
em lego is play good in danish learn sumtin new every day
Legend has it... Tom is still trying to get out of the finished costume. :)
Too much effort.  Tom really should have done something with a g-string and some body paint.
so cute i love it
In a more professional than it needs to be way, if anyone tries this in the future, grab a product called Gesco. It goes on before the paint and helps the paint stick on better and is generally a good underlying coat for any absorbing product (cardboard, paper, etc).
You could have a cutout eye and glue it or something on to yourself as a cloud to make the 'iCloud'
this is so cool, so clever Tom
The music is on point Tom!💃🕺👍
such a little kid at heart - love it!
and you can breathe, which is nice -Tom Daley 2017
This was so funny! Not very scary but a good idea 😂😍
You need a mesh where the mouth is so only you can see out, but people can't see in.
You’re like 20 bro stop making costumes especially roblox people
Good and Terrible....
This is your most environmental friendly clip!! We do not need to buy everything, it is much more fun and environmental friendly to make our own costumes!
Dude!! that was impressed... I had fun with your video about HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN COSTUME.... lol\nGreetings from your fan from Paraguay!
He is too sweet. I wish there were more gay boys like him, dating is hard.
Tom, I met you on the London Underground Train in and took a picture with you and so did my sister! Sorry that I forgot to say thanks, but you are a great diver!
I enjoyed listening to the Thriller cover music in the background.  Good choice, Mr. Editor.
This is so cute and hillarious=)) i can't omg lololol
I have such a crush on Tom 😩
can i say tht u're so cute and not even scary sorry tom but the costume well done👍
With your cuteness, you can't make a scary Halloween costume, I'm sorry!
How did you get the arm holes even?
so creative Tom, I love it!
He is so cute. Like lil brother :))
ahaha this was so impressive and funny at the same time i loved it!!
Hiding your hot body with a box... That's a crime for sure!!! ;-)

Were you worried Lego would sue you if you made it look any good?\nEmbarrassingly bad for an adult.
...and I’m sure he loves it.... *big grin*
I am so in love omg you are so cute
Great idea for a costume!
i thought it was a pair of boobs in the thumbnail so i thought this was a joke video
When i was little i was scared of cutting myself with scissors bt i realize its a 1/10 chance you will
Just get a can of black shoe polish to paint your face and a sharp kitchen knife. You can be OJ Simpson and the costume only costs about $3.
That looks dope costume Tom
Omg  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 still cute
o yes? video verry gooood luck
I like kissing men

i want a sexiest female vocalist riff off with Britney, Lana Del Ray and Ariana Grande
Usher won usher always wins usher still as good as when he started
Luke Evans is gay. Just an FYI. He’s probably more interested in usher than you ladies
Usher won this for me all the way
What's the first song that James sing?
Bruh...somebody PLEASE get Matt Bomer on this!!

I'm not a mum but I do really think that James is SEXY AF
Amazing job to every one of you!! ❤️🎀
Wow amazing didn't knew Luke Evans could sing Where were you?..
Just saying but, I think the voice of Justin Bieber when he sung 'Love Yourself' at the Grammy's last year really sticks in my mind. :P
DAMN! That was great 👍🏽
No one sings like Gaston👏
They would really make some good music lel
(Not to sound like an obsessed fan girl or anything)\nLuke looks like he could be the Dolan twin's dad.
8:29 damn... bro... damn....
Omg.. Luke.... <3
Let's be honest tho, the sexiest people on that stage are the filharmonics... (probably spelled that wrong)
Can these three do this weekly please?
so much sexiness in one place!!  love their voices!!
Oooooowee all three together👌😘😘😘😘😘and yes james can sang🔥🔥
Wooo hoooo Yes! Luke is the best!
Usher would have sung Nice & Slow... just saying

If only Usher sang Trading Places ahah
Okay being a man-fan ME LIKEY!!!
So what happen to Justin Timberlake?
Gawdamn fine
That last song tho omg!! ❤❤❤😍😍😍
I hope the audience didn't get herpes from this performance.
Usher’s face while Luke was singing was hilarious😂😂 especially at 8:33
Yes every one is sexy in there own way , love this song they sung at the end together
I want Christina Aguilera to come out and out sexy riff them all!!!!!!!  Ahahaa
Why are all the hottest men gay !🤷🏻‍♀️🙈

Luke won!!!
Daniel Caesar
Jaimee fox mate
13:02 Damn Usher!
Meh. The pharmacist on Modern Family does a better version of, I Want to Know What Love is.
4:13  Did that guy just vape?
I feel like James Corden has this show just to try to convince us he can sing.
Not my mum!
oh Luke!
Watching this for the Nth time because of Luke!
As soon as James said A world, where we can all work together and stay together. I knew my boy Al Green was coming. Man I love that song!
They just were lucky Reggie didnt join in... he would have wrecked them :D
Luke's song was great, but not sensual enough to compete with the MASTER. it's usher, no contest.
Anyone else expecting a full orchestra when the Philharmonic were announced?
good show
Skip to 4:20 lol
wow Luke is good
Ummmm that’s not fair. Luke Evans destroyed my ovaries
No one sings like Gaston! 😍😍😍😍
Luke Evans.... One of the most gorgeous men on earth.. :O
Dam gaston
Luke Evans 💙💙💙
11:33 made me SWOON!!!!
holy shit. Luke Evans is hot AF
I love this and I enjoyed this ! 😍
Holy fucking moly . Like evans . The voice
Usher has a unique voice which is powerful and smooth at the same time which is rare
Luke wins everything
Luke Evans is now the newest member of my spank bank... Woooooo!
Omg Luke 😩😩💕💕. Why so beautiful and so not in any girl’s lane... 😭😭
Which song does usher sings???
This guy has some good points but he sounds like KSI and it's off-putting
Anyone else think this guy seems like a massive nob?
This white man looks black
3:17 is what your looking for!!!!!
Please don't reduce this to AFTV level! I know you've seen an opportunity to make monies like Fat Robbie has from his channel, but at the expense of your club? Keep it classy mate. We already get the 'buying success' and 'plastic' jibes. Don't need AFTV levels of ridicule too!
FOR ALL SPORTS FANS THAT CRITICISE THEIR TEAMS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU WORK HARD FOR MULTIPLE YEARS OF YOUR LIFE, BALANCING ALOT OF THINGS AND PLEASING UNGREATFUL PEOPLE.
It’s either get Belotti or bring back Tammy Abraham
He’s dying to be like DT of Arsenal fan tv lol
I’ve got several points here so I’m gonna just spit them out. \nMoses is fucking dreadful, seriously, I’ve seen better crosses from my grandad with a tennis ball.\nApzillicueta is our only centre back who can pass a ball, it is getting ridiculous seeing our defenders punting the ball back like it’s a fucking drop ball. Why isn’t Zappacosta starting? Why did we sell Matic? Why doesn’t Rudiger start? \nFuck of Conte. \nUseless pile of wank.
Pretty sure this guy goes to my Uni 😂
Trying to be like arsenal fan TV to get a few more views
Hahha Chelsea are fucking shit! \nForever a small club! \nPlastic and shit fans!
How dare he diss Willian. Guy is over reacting. Its one defeat against a Palace team who were up for it. Get over it and move on ffs....
Can't blame bats I mean think of all the crucial goals he's scored for us? In my opinion he deserves more chances.
Plastic fans, plastic club, always will be
These guys are laughing like they've never heard that expression before... it old, guys. My friends were saying that in secondary school back in the late 90s. As for Chelsea... yep, you said it, no leadership, no strength in depth and no recognisable and proven striker.\n As for Palace, c'mon chaps. Only way is up now. Fans were terrific as always. There is a team spirit, a positive one, at Palace that can't be emulated or obtained by any other team. The day we lose it, is the day we no longer exist.
He's trying cunt of Willan I can't see why love child I guess.
Chelsea’s fan base is a joke.
Straight up I think this dude has autism
You need a hole in condoms, it`s where you put your knob in.
I can see G.Hiddik replacing Antonio before Christmas in emergency. And then having Mussonda a regular starter and Willian going on loan to Fulham or something.
This is just lol
Costa and Matic were missed. A Chelsea fan was mocking me a few weeks ago when I said Chelsea would miss him\nChelsea do not play to Batshuayi's strength, it is sad. If you play Messi as a Target man he would be shit too\nBatshuayi is not Costa, he is probably better as a wide forward or when playing with two forwards
Bet you didn't think he was useless when he got the winner in Madrid.
Fucking palace 😅😅😅😅😅😅nice to see the scum be put in there place'''
If we can win one of the cups, and have a decent UCL run, then it would be an ok season
Hammering willian?! I would gladly take him to man utd. You guys missing matic so badly but do not even know it.

100% agree with this guy
Are these the people that live in London these days? Fuck me what a third world shithole.
3:18 was why you came here
Lol that must hurt..palace not scored and then they beat Chelsea omg Chelsea are shit
Perhaps try interviewing a real Chelsea fan & not a kid who has only known the success of the last three years.
Shit club very little history 😂.
All condoms have holes in them. That's how you put your dick in them.
City and united for the title, pep vs jose
You will never be Arsenal fan TV
Doesn't a condom already have a hole in it?🤔
Where do these people get time to rant like this? Son, you're a Chelsea supporter. Not a board member.
No bus no party. Why does conte inisist on playing on the counter. Why not commit instead of comitiing after you go down. They are not man city. Less than 60 percent possession which is disgraceful. 70 percent easy and if you have the ball. You will score. You have the quality in hazard.\nTo stop chelsea is easy. STOP THE COUNTER ATTACK AND CONTE IS USELESS.\nWhy play with so many defensive players?
Shit team shit supporters and thats the sample of it
Why do chelsea fans moan just because they've lost one game?You lot win trophies year in year out and your fans are cocky after you lose 1-0 or 2-1.you lot have a problem...
This guy is bigger than DT.
why do all these random cunts keep stopping by and thinking they can give their 2 cents whenever they feel like it? mad disrespectful.
I hopw to god ancelotti replaces conte this summer
I don’t know why black and Asian people support chelsea are you guys deluded they’re deluded. A bunch of middle class snoby asians and blacks support them don’t know their roots uncle toms
he can't even make won successful dribble, the moment i saw willian on the line-up i knew we were going to struggle. charly came in and his first dribble had a better chance at goal then willian attemping 100 dribble and failing 99.
It really feels like the team can't be bothered, rather than Conte being to blame. But then again, the team, and manager didn't show any passion. It feels like the Mourinho disaster is happening again, only with Conte at the centre of a shit storm.
Fab was the only starter who actually played, he wasn't excellent, but compared to the rest he was ok. Mosonda should be starting ahead of William until he fixes homes himself up
You was singing his name when he scored to win you the league 😂😂
Hahaha ... :D \nBatsuayi indeed is very mediocre.\nBut let's hope Chelsea could bounce back. Let's support our team instead of mocking them shall we?
Zappacosta should start now that Moses is out injured
Why conte thinks or believes he can go 2 seasons playing one formation still baffles me! This chelsea team is easily predictable because the manager has failed to keep opponents guessing.substituting a striker when u need one and Willian starting games ahead of Pedro!!!!!!
Ppl can't even handle  one bad result. This is the beauty of premier league. Last season conte was magical this & that now suddenly he is this & that. Give some time we don't have proper 11 now due to injuries. Keep calm & support. Dont b glory hunters like man utd , arsenal. We don't have history but we are making in the process. Keep calm. KTBFFH.
Conte is becoming a bitch because he is not like he was at juventus. And if he gets the passion, ruthlessness and desire from juventus we will win the efl cup because we are shit cahill that anus, willian that anus,bastuyai that anus, they don't know how to play willian and bastuyai went from Messi to a Sunday league player. We need to sell them and buy better players but we all know it will never happen because our board is also shit and the fucking owner doesn't take matters in his own hands and sack fire and kick them (board) out of the door.and the last one we need to stop trying to get fouls and man up and aim to get a goal.
what a shit from Willian everytime when he gets the ball he loses it freely why. Batshuayi is another fucked up player being overrated what a shit. every time we start batshuayi and captain its a lose Why. are they committed to the team or they are being paid to fix games. Willian, Cahill and Batshuayi should be benched no matter what those players are fucking useless. Rudiger and Christen are much better on the back than what this old guy is doing for us. \n\nYeah Batshuayi is like a broken condom
Title is over man. Summer transfer was underwhelming coupled with these type of performances. Best we aim for top 4, try to win one of the domestic cup n maybe a decent run in the ucl.
If we can’t beat Crystal Palace and Burnley, what’s the point.
One of the worst Chelsea proformances since the founding of the club all the way back in 2003
These southern fans need to get a grip imagine if you supported a club that actually struggles.
Batshuayi should just get outta club asap...willian has really been shit of late though...cahill should just be like JT and admit its past his time and settle for a spot on the bench but he is probably selfish thinking of a spot in world cup...i have a feeling this season will be like the season after we won the league two years ago....
He talks like Mo from AFTV
City are light years away from any team in the PL right now. The top 4 is the real competition
Stop interviewing this guy. He speaks anger and not football.
Lewis someone called in sick we need you to come in early
Fucking hell that chant at the start might be the worst chant in football history
We won't win the league for sure bcoz our squad depth is just totally shit.For Man City even without Aguero they are thrashing teams left and right bcoz they have another proven striker Gabriel Jesus.For United if Lukaku gets injured they have Zlatan , Rashford and Martial.But we have useless Batshuay.When he plays we become so shit that we can't even beat fucking Palace!!!!!!
You completely made my day mate. These words are 100% Chelsea now 😡😡
Trending with 9.2k views, well then I guess that Russian tycoon even bribed YouTube mods then.
The production value behind this channel is so mediocre like the history of Chelsea Football Club. 👀

i salute this guy
Call me delusional but I still think we can win the title, Man City always have a great start to the season, yes this year they've been pretty explosive but there's no chance they will keep hammering teams the way they are. UTD are playing garbage football recently so I expect them to drop more points, morata will be back this weekend hopefully and our season can restart from there. We had a worse start last season so there is hope.
Somalian is a chelsea shirt 😂😂 man these leeches are everywhere
Always crying like a baby back bitch, no shame in losing to the mighty eagles. Were due a win.
A black Chelsea fan? Must be a paid actor
He is trying to act like troops # AFTV IS BETTER
This is way more hilarious than arsenal fan tv

The ONLY way I'll watch the real again, after the shameful way they treated Tamar, is to bring her back. I'll also settle for Ayesha Curry cuz Tamar is booked!
I like that though very unusual but kind of cute too.
Shows me that Curry is a faithful dude. Instead of looking for thots while on the road he asks his wife for nudes/feet pics.
There is no heterosexual explanation for this
Lony is wearing  Tamar ‘s wig hahahhahaha and Adrienne is wearing Tamar’s dresses hahahhahaha I think realdaytime  is saving good money this season
It’s her man/husband she can send him him whatever.
Steph tries so hard to protect his reputation and Ayesha always does something like this lol
I would love for Ayesha to be a host!!!
These show's are perfect for my low IQ. \nOnly 4100 views and this crap is trending?
Dickhead for exposing him

never thought a skincare video could be funny but trust sid and Dina to make one thats hilarious
Dina say wallahy\nSid obviously not \nLOOOOL!

This was sooo funny
Dina is the kind of entertaining chick i desperately need in my surrounding
LMAOO you two are the best!
I would love to see part two you an amazing and incredible vlogger ❤️😍😁 Dina ❤️
I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH!! such a great pick me up after a bad week
I love your dictionary lol
Just use water. \nI've never had a spot since pre teens and all I ever did was wash my hands then rub my face with warm water. No mark what so ever on my face.
I don’t think I’ve laughed this hard like this at your video in a while. I’m it’s always so funny with you two 😭😭😭 you guys are honestly goals.. MashAllah you’re like two big kidsss✨🙏🏽❤️
'Sid, we're muslims, stop' 'Muslims dont have sex' 😂😂😂
Idk why he always points out things he doesn't need to. Usually mean things. Looks wise, he's quite ugly and she's beautiful. But I thought he's clearly a nice guy and that's all that matters. But in every video I've watched he'll say you look shit or something similarly rude or stupid. Almost as if now he's got her he doesn't need to always be polite. I know she's not offended by what he says and it's no big deal, it's their banter. Most men forget to show their appreciation to their partner.
Hi Dina. I watch your channel since the beginning. I have converted to Islam and your videos has helped me a lot since I didn't know any Muslims. I used to like you because you were humble and I used to see a good Muslim in you. However since you started mainly doing videos with Sid I find you very cynical, swearing and being rude most of the times. I don't think you are a good example for a good muslim/person anymore. I have actually unsubscribed from your channel and I just wanted to let you know, how one of your ex followers feels about your recent content. Please be more humble and don't swear as much. This behaviour is not nice at all. I know many non-muslims that are actually more humbled and charitable and generally nicer people. We as Muslims should be from the best people out there. And you don't seem like a nice person at all recently.
How to get to get flawless skin? = Genetics
This video is a mess lol
Hahahahahaha this video is so funny 😁
When Dina was wearing the bubble clay mask, she looked like squidward from sponge bob 😂😂

You DIRTY fucking Muslim. Your horrible, bastardised English accent makes my ears bleed and on top of that, your whole fucking channel is cancer. Honestly, CANCER. I would like to watch you get fucking glutted with cement. You know the only reason you're as big as you assuredly are is because you wear a rag on your head.

Love this video so much

Ur voice is soo loud deep and annoying! Bursted my ear drums!!!
Mashallah you look very nice
Boring..
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that Arsenal lost 2-1 to Watford.
still undefeated for the season hehe
HAVE YOU SEEN CHELSEA LOSING TO CP ? OR ARSENAL TO WATFORD ? HELLO THIS IS REAL FOOTBALL NO ONE CAN CONTROL IT LIKE YOU DO WITH ALEX HUNTER'S JOURNY IN FIFA !
Arsenal go foit => lost, Chealsea brave => lost, u should fire Mou , he is always set to win
Man Utd fan here. I agree with what Mourinho was saying. Watching the game, Liverpool had more possession and pressed higher, but they could not unlock our defense. Both teams were trying to nullify each other's attacks. Liverpool tried to keep the ball and pressing high when they didn't so they get the ball back. Man Utd were defending in numbers to counter-attack Liverpool, which has been a weakness of theirs. Klopp didn't risk removing a midfielder to reinforce their attack, because it meant that a space would form in the middle which would help our devastating counter-attack. He knew if we countered it would be over, so he played it safe. Both teams were defensively strong but Liverpool were poor in attack and we were waiting to attack. \n\nI don't mid the defending in numbers. What frustrated me was the sloppy passes and possession loss when we did have the ball. Our midfielders gave the ball away too much. This is why Pogba is good in counter-attacking. He has the best range of passing arguably in the world and would've been better for possession when we had possession.\n\nNevertheless, coming to Anfield is tough so a point is enough. United will be happier with the point though, especially with Liverpool's shit form. 1 win in 8 games, are you okay?
why wasn't Mata used as the creative player needed to feed Lukaku and the wingmen - Herrera and Matic could still play as holding midfilders - Jose makes no mention of Mata ?!?! stop making excuses for a lack lustre performance. why are you waiting for Klopp to allow you to win the game - is that for real from a so-called top manager
If you want to win the league. You have to try  attacking away from home to places like Liverpool,spurs,Chelsea ,arsenal and man city. These teams are almost like 4 points as the other top teams have to get a result like that too.
Oh man can't Waite for cytiy to teach him how is football fun
what a shameless complain and denying fact that Mourinho is saying  I`ve no midfielder..... but forgetting what Herrera did last year even with the 35 years old Carrick ! As a Man Utd culture of football I HATE TO WATCH SUCH GAME any more! No more bussssss in the playing field even for Man City match day or Barcelona!
Liverpool is shit. Scousers in general are born chav and smell very bad
All of you lot are fools, and bandwagoners who dont understand football, I'm sick of seeing this shit Oh Mou ruined the game - Who's the manager, who's won the lot time and time again, you fools were let down only by your expectations, and as a man utd fan, was I happy with the performance? No. Happy with the Tactics? No. Because like most of you I've been spoiled by the Sir Alex Era, so no I would never be happy. But do I understand? I do, I do understand, even though I don't agree, I understand, and I will support Mou as long as he is at the helm. The league will not be won and lost in October. If the opponent can't score they can't win. As for as many goals city have score and all the stats you like, we've score the second most, conceded the least, and let me remind you a Man City loss, just one, and a United win on any given weekend, and we're top of the league, now hows that for perspective ?
Fair play Jose altho im a united supporter Liverpool are a decent team but we still not defeated yet this season (bpl)
Nobody realizes he was trying to do a Chelsea v Liverpool at anfield 13/14......... sadly no one slipped
People don’t notice that Mourinho is scared of Klopp teams.
You always have to make the best of what you have available, OK united midfield was weak but this should have been compensated with the best attacking players.  I would have like to see martial, rashford and lukaku in the starting 11.   this takes pressure away from the weak midfield and would have forced liverpool into more defensive tactics.  I do not think mourinho works with a game to game plan.  seems to me that he thinks one game tactic fits all.  We should have burst out of the gates against liverpool and put them on the backfoot from the start.  Im not a big mourinho fan, I wanted giggs :(
I sink man u gonna sink
I see united fans on here saying that we played defensive! Lol and they call us deluded
Klop should just Thank Jose for not attacking that shity defense atleast he has another day to improve his shity team. . . .sacking is around the corner.
FRAUD.
With the attacking power we have, I still don’t understand why Jose insists on playing so defensive against the top 6 away. It’ll be a problem for us to battle the best teams in Europe with this sort of play
Liverpool fan should listen to this interview.  it shows that klopp is slowly adapting his pressing style to be more defensively solid.  It shows that slowly he is heading toward a balance where he can keep creating and no concede to much.   If he carry's on and then adds a Van dijk and a proper striker we could be challenge.  Possibly next season. especially when you add keita to that midfield a defender and ma better striker
Chelsea united....as a Bayern Fan i lost all respect for manu... history and tradition means nothing to you i guess...never understood why they signed mourinho...
Dont worry is stil way to go
we draw? arsenal and chelsea loose and am happy
Everyone is complaining about Jose parking the bus, yet here he explains brilliantly how Klopp is no different. Klopp basically matched Jose in substitutions and tactics, refusing to make the first move to actually threaten United's defence. Especially for someone at home, lying 7th in the table and 7 points adrift, you take out Salah, Coutinho and Firmino as soon as Lingard & Rashford come on? Is this what heavy metal football looks like? It doesn't matter though. Hugging your players on the pitch instantly makes you a better manager.
Soo... basically he regrets that he didn't have Schweinsteiger. :P
Jose has found the keys to his bus I see
The truth is this, Van Gaal would not have played difensive against Liverpool neither would SAF have. Liverpool defense was shit and Jose made them look like class. As a United fan if you are not disappointed with the display and the fact that Jose went for a draw even before the game then you need to be his assistant.
Tot you'd be happy with losing 2pts against a cheap team you are a real idiot and we don't need cowards.. No chance to go to France?
The English press talks too much. Sometimes it unnecessary. He (Jose) had a game plan and he did exactly that based on the way the opponents played. A draw is always better than losing
So he waited for Liverpool to give him a chance to attack? What kind of a game plan is that???
I don't care what anyone says. But Liverpool fans who say deffo our year and try to prove that Coutinho is worth over £60m are a disgrace to football. They're just a bunch of chavs who have nothing better to do than cringe out everyone... like fuck.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAN U
ramicoo bro liverpoo fans are honestly living in the past. Wake the fuck up its not 70s anymore. They are just pissed off cause they were waiting for a battering and didnt get it so they thought utd are there for the taking and even then they managed a 1 proper chance on goal by their defender for crying out loud. Where is your 120 million super star that u now wish u sold him to messilona after his memorable performance yesterday especialy the cheap dive to get a pen. FUCK OFF SCOUSERS
Mkhtaryan was useless he had no effort in him! Overated and our worse buy in 4 years!!
This result proves the only reason man utd have been on form is because they have played bottom half teams. They will lose every game against top 10 cos they're fucking shit with an arrogant black stinky cunt for a striker
Jose Borinho complaining that he doesn't have enough players haha.....Give him another £300m to spend.  He hasn't spent enough yet lol
Valuable point, against a difficult opponent away from home. For me, as a fan, it wasn't an exciting game, but I'm happy that we got a point. I'm expecting a lot more dominance from United in the Old Trafford fixture though.
Chelshit fans ranting about United parked the bus again. Chelshit played good football and got 0 points. You coudlnt simply beat Zaha. Mourinho is one of the best managers in English football. Salute from an Arsenal fan.
Liverpool fan here, of course Jose didn't play attacking here, why would he? We press high an aim for the neck, he sheltered the neck. Sure it wasn't exciting but there is 22 players on the pitch that can change that, all the managers can do is set a base, United were not good but we could not score either, they left with a point. I would take a point at OT too. Next game, let's go YNWA
This man is ruining what used to be the best fixture in the world, Liverpool vs United, he come in with a squad worth 250 million and parks the bus, its rlly depressing
am a man u fan he didnt park the bus he park a double decker bus
Klopp was the pussy if you can’t see that u have got problems
Jose had a good game plan, our players did not turn up for the game. Lukaku is a very good striker but is not that clinical for me at times. A game away if you get a single chance you must score twice. That could have changed the game completely. Liverpool could have broken up the mid 3 and played right into Jose's game plan. We were easily giving the ball away, I miss Pogba and Fellaini they dont lose the ball unnecessarily
Ryans Gigs criticised Moyes for being a 'respond to the other team' kind of coach, rather than being ManU and doing things their way. Jose does the same as Moyes, complains that the other coach doesn't let his side play, and he is some kind of super coach? Amazing.
he sends andreas pereira on loan and moans for having no midfield playes on bench.....pereira would have been great value in this squad.
He definitely go for a draw.. i can feel jose had a lot of pressure after last season.. he could have been sacked if he didnt win europa league after all the money  he spend.. so now he tried the best to not losing by parking ke train and not sacked by the bus..
People complaining ?? Looks like draw but it's beautiful 1 points, kloop worked on defending I think
Man that's an ugly shirt.
Jose Jose jose. Guardiola is playing de bryun and Silva both number 10 in midifield if Jose wants to really control the game he could have payed mata but he didn’t want to take risk. However as a Man U fan I think he did the rit thing by parking the bus. Fergi have done it, so why not Jose ?
Played for a point and can't even admit it
How is this on trending?!
LFC there for the taking and he bottled it
Fucking dickhead blaming his midfielders instead of his shite tactics. This man is a coward. Liverpool are shocking defensively, take the initiative and put them to the sword. This is cowardly. He played the same vs Southampton in the second half after going 1-0 up. Coward.
Man United manager doesn't care what fun say or think .\nThat what I like to morinho .
Everytime Arsenal depresses me, i always remember the mighty united spent 90m on a walking haircut to finish 6th and celebrate a EFL cup.
I'm a big fan of Jose but that performance today was irritating. For me he should've used a 3-5-2. Just no attacking threat today, our momentum has slowed down after the last few games.
If Tony pulis, sam allardyce or sean dyche play like this and they are ridiculed and called out for ruining the game. Yet this horrible cunt mourinho does it and he is praised master tactician, genius bla bla. Get a fucking grip and pull your tongues out of his and man utd’s asses. He came for a draw that is it. Tell me any top team in the world goes out to a direct rival to get a point. I thought big bad man utd where running away with the league smashing teams? Oh ye thats right they have played nearly everybody in the bottom half of the table and the first good team they come up against and guess what they hardly got a kick of the ball. Fucking frauds
come on!!! why should he give you opportunity to counter attack????? you say they were very defensive??? come on!!! who was more defensive???
lol these reporters are out to wind up Mouringyo
One team wanted to win this game, embarrassing it’s hard to break down 11people behind the ball
How is 9k views in 6 hours ‘trending’
morinho didn't care about fans
Arsenal lost, Chelsea lost, & b*tches complaining about Mourinho & United
best mourinho
Park the bus cunt.
Jose fucking coward
Good job Mourinho!
Haters - liverpool didnt win.... man utd didnt lose ==== what shit r u talking about
mourinho is a liar
Mou is classic.
1 point is still 1 point. no pobga no fellaini.
Calm down guys, Chelsea lost today......
Get a grip Jose!
Trending?
Terrible game
without retracts please !!
👿👿0/0:(
manu lack creative mid fielders
Jose you are talking BS. I have followed United for 28 years, and this is what you give back to our tradition. Sir Alex would never have done that. He would have gone for it, in the best of traditions of United. This is typical Jose play...
Mr. Parkinho!
Did not do the job needed during the transfer market. He should have bought 2 or 3 midfielders and atleast 2 more strikers. He bought a holding mid, a defender and a striker. Terrible mismanagement for a “topmanager” at a big club as Manchester United is. \n\nManchester United will run into the same issues as they’ve had last year. When injuries and suspensions show up the club has no back up, which will cost points. I am pretty sure that we will see more of these kind of matches if they won’t do their job the next transferwindow.
blah,blah MU didn't win bcoz pogba is injured and klopp did not go out full attack! \nmou is a shit manager!
GGMU  win lose or draw man united till i die, 20 times Champions!!! many plastic fan's (kids?) 😡😠 If you can't win, draw is good. J.M won more at Man Utd than J.K and P.G at loserpool and SHITY 😂
Back in the days he did it at Chelsea it worked because he had Drogba, who would have finished that one ‘Lukaku’ chance. Fact is he still parked a double decker! If Salah had left that ball for Coutinho this story would be different.
where was the 200 million buget team offensively? if he couldn't win this liverpool, in this form, in this period, he will never beat it.
Chicken-shit manager with chicken-shit scared defensive tactic. Nothing new from arrogant shit. Big game against big opponent and he goes defensive. His explanation is BS. He is a reactive manager. I hope City smashes them 5-0 like Barca did his Real M in 2010.
Why didn't Mourinho envisage the possibility of the formation that Klopp chose and have a mid-field  player on the bench to deal with it. Isn't that what coaches do especially the Special One? Of course he didn't come for 3 points but just the 1.
Garry Neville is full of shit.
Liverpool were all over you, \nU prick.
jose,jose, here ,over here, boring as fuck jose,man united charlatans again jose. here jose .millions spent and no joy jose. chelsea what jose, liverpool better .yes that is true. united found out again .
am so glad this bus parking man get out of my club.
KLOPP SPENT 120M SINCE OCTOBER 2015\n\n300M SPENT SINCE JULY 2016. HE'S A PATHETIC NEGATIVE FRAUD
When you play a quicker team. Start trying playing first more italian. Then play like Barca.
A 0-0 draw with Liverpool means Mourinho has now gone ten straight games without a win at Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham or Saturday’s opponents. His sides have drawn five and lost five of those games, conceding 15 goals and scoring just four times. Just one of those away goals have come since he was appointed at Old Trafford.
Meanwhile city keep bangin goals. Thats the diference between Pep and the bus driver.
Mourinho and utd..... SHIT!!!!!
Special one👏
What makes me mad is idiots that do not understand how deeply depleted the team is at this period of time, which Mourinho is trying to conceal as much as he can. Get it: no Bailly, no Rojo, no Carrick, no Pogba, no Fellaini and on top of that injured Rashford. Why Mouhrinho played defensively and Lukaku did not get service, because Mouhrinho is realistic, he got the maximum today and Lukaku had his chance to score. That is all Mkhitaryan's fault.
Okay, I was just thinking about this... but I realized that Alfie names everything Rodney 😂 like in one of Zoella's 2015 Halloween videos, he called the blow up pumpkin Rodney lol. But LBW!!!!
Too much came out at 5pm today.... not that I'm complaining 😂 lbw squad!
I visited my grandpa today and had to think about your honest and deep thoughts about old people and how they're feeling lonely and have nobody to talk to. \nI love helping other people and i hope to find a way to get involved here in Germany. \nI love how you always say what is on your mind, wether it's funny or sad, positive or negative. \nI find that very inspiring!
My favourite vlogger 😊
Alife to stop spiders coming in to your house you can either cut up lemon and put them by your window or get some peppermint oil and mix it with water and spray it around your windows and door by the way spiders tend to hide in the corner of rooms because they are the warmest

Hey alphi.. I wanted to know that can I buy you products over seas as I live in India!
GSP is arguably the greatest athlete to have ever entered the octagon, but he doesn't have head for it, physically, his face breaks up very easily,  and I think his brain is going to be affected.
GSP is going to crack Bisping so hard, that he’ll fix his fucked up eye!
GSP is going to straighten Bisping's crooked eye with his jab.
Every time it’s 100% touching George first. Fk outta here Mike.
All Bisping is doing is attempting to increase those PPV buys, and you fucks are taking the bait. He has always played the villain. Now people will pay for a chance to see him get beat up. \n\nGod knows this is the only way to sell a GSP fight anyway.
Fuck you Bisping don't fuck gsp, nov4 you will get knock out!
I will bgrreak you man!!
I love GSP i support him forever, He is a nice guy... Bisping is a garbage
Bisping needs to feel animosity, I get it
It broke my heart when that kid ran away when GSP offered to take a picture.
That kid got scared and ran away lmaoo
I'm British and I fucking hate bisping
Pissing off GSP is never a good idea....ever.
Bisbing who ...omg 1 year of success...bout damn time.....GSP has a long history of fighting great fights who were in there prime bisbing got lucky he even won the belt
Don’t like either of them. This is fake.
GSP: I will touch you! I will Break you! lol
Bisbing trying hard to see a fight.
Bisring lol what a fool.look at the state of him...
Fuck hem..he is a bully!!! Not a fighter..all this fightdrs are bad for the sport..!!!!diaz is a bully..cooner is a acktor!!!tony is a gangsta not a fighter!!no respekt no humble no sport..this are All punks!!!
Poor gsp...he felt bad cussing in front of the kid you could tell. I'm a bisping fan but hes takin it a bit far
gsp looks like hes gonna kill him with a knife if he touches him lol
i hope gsp shuts up bisping. dudes the only one trying to start anything between them for ppv buys. wolf tickets
you Go GSP!\nbisping is a coward and loser😁😂😃😄\ntotally fake and doesnt know how to fight what a loser bro
They’re trying their best too hype this fight lol
Great example for the kids. Where's the sportmanship gone. Oh yeah it will miracously reappear when the fight is over. They have milked the chumps for their money time to be friends now
Best not to get gsp pissed off
Gsp saying fuck off is actually badass hahah I wish gsp cusses more. Now I really want tos we the fight after this video😝
The kid was like i don't want a picture anymore your crazy maaan🏃🏻
I hope GSP fucks up Bisping's other eye so he'll look normal.
Yup Bisping is getting knocked out. After GSP wins he should say I'm not impressed with your performance.
Bisping loves being the dick, but if you have half a brain you can see he is trying to get georges riled up because he isnt as aggressive as most opponents so its all mental game plan, bisping has said many times he respects the guy so all this is an attempt at breaking him down before the fight
Bisping is the one that needs to control himself.
This needs to be retitled to Bisping vs GSP. Dudes earned the A side here
I see only one idiot with no respect and it isn't gsp. Knock this clown out for good please
that poor little id ran away because both cant control themselves in public :( Not really great is it for a role model and fighter to leave that impression on a 7 year old fan .. hope its a double KO
Lmao @ the lil kid running away from George at the end
Did u see the kid run!!! lol
bisping is fucking embarrassing. you've fucking run from the top contenders at middleweight. you only fought Silva et al. when they where past it.
Bisping: Control yourself you little etc.\n\nMichaels making himself look bad. Maybe it's his one eye, but can he not see that he's the one that needs controlling?
pisping is a real piece of shit and worst shit talker.
Bisping is so triggered when he talks so much shit.
Bisbing. Being Such a dick. Save all the bs for the cage. How bitter sweet and poetic Justice will it be when GSP kicks your English ass.
Before everyone gets their panties in a twist, Bisping is just hyping the fight for fuck sake. He's making it seem as though he has some beef with George, when in reality he probably likes and definitely respects him a great deal. But the fact is he's fighting him, and the more interest he can stir up for the fight the more money he makes as champ with a ppv percentage..
The kid running away is not only hilarious but makes a statement about how kids know things we forgot. He wants nothing to do with people that act like that. Hyping the fight, people keep saying. That's just someone being a turd of a person, repeatedly.
Gsp is a no good cheating dog, i hope Bisping breaks his whole face.
Everyone should love George. Great example Of choosing to be a great human being by never sinking down to another person’s level, Treat those with dignity even if they’re ignorant enough to not treat you with dignity.
Where’s the casual fans thinking that Bisping is copying McGregor??
There just trying to hype the fight
Bisping is full of shit he goes on about GSP touching him. Moron you touched him first
Fuck off.... I will break you!!!!
Bisping is the one touching george first! He's a fucking antagonising prick! I think everybody would react the same by pushing Bisping away after being touched, Practice what you preach Mr Bisping.
The name Michael Bisping will always be remembered as the British scumbag that represented himself, his country and his family like a disgusting disgraceful piece of shit. Pure dog shit. His kids are gonna turn out to be pieces of dog shit just like their scum father.
Damn gotta give it to bisping hes selling this fight but anyways hope gsp wins hes the original ppv king without all the talking anyways so this should be quite lucrative
i sincerely think he is afraid, those reactions...dont touch me dont touch me! trowing punches and shit.. this is real bully stuff.\nAwkward and cringy moment with the child at the end of the video by the way, soooo many embarrasing moments from this guy, @TMZSports how about a video? cheeeeers
What a fake world has become ufc
GSP isn't backing down. He's standing his ground against this bully Bisping.
There is a video I remember I watched few years ago about Gsp and karma watch it
Can't wait for Bisping to flatten this french speaking cunt
Mike, you look stupid when you act tough, not GSP, who doesn't do that. You have no idea how silly and retarded you sound.
Why are ufc fighters above the law? If you threat someone in public, thats illegall. Yes, we all know its an act, but common people dont know, like that little scared kid in the store!
Yeah?  Fuck off man. I am not afraid of you.   GSP 2017  go George!
Haha GSP having none of Bisping's fake shit tough guy act. Nailed it. No one's buying ur bs Michael The ducker Bisping.
I guess the kid at the end wasn't interested in a photo with GSP anymore! Lol!
Reminds me of that time Wanderlei went there with a camera to talk with Chael Sonnen
Come on people, Bisping is hyping the fight! He’s generating interest by doing these antics.
Fack Aff man I will bghreak you 😂
Bisping stfu your shit you ugly cunt
Gsp swearing is fkn awesome, seeing him trash talking seriously, is actually bad ass
McNugget And Mayweather kinda killed promoting fights....
i hope michael wins
Fake
Pathetic.
bisping is a flog
Suck each other off already
HEYYYY FUCK AFFFF MAN ! XD
I Must Break You - GSP
fakk off man
Such class
Yo GSP cussing is the funniest shit ever
Don't touch me maaan
GSP is a legend
GSP's easiest first!
BISPING YOU BITCH YOU
Gsp reminds me of karate kid
Yea fuck off man.
show.but its ok
Gsp scared the hell outta... A kid... Lmao
GSP cussing makes me keep grinning
Yah fuck awf man
Fuck off!!!
Ay fack off man !
Delusional bisping.
Lambs eye
bisping is fucking cringe
Mad respect to GSP.
Fuck tmz tho still
BISPING IS A ROUGH LAD AHA
Gsp is gonna smash bisping..
bisbing is a brittish cunt i hope george does to bisbing what he did to koshcheck in there second fight.
All Bispings doing is getting under GSPs skin. He does it so easily, why is GSP biting so hard
Bravo Seth, very well said. I was so sad to see Jon Stewart retire but, for me, Seth's Closer Look segments have since filled the void Jon left behind. Seth is to Trump what Jon was to Bush, a refreshingly clear voice of logical criticism that is delivered in smart and entertaining satire.
And when are we talking again about Louis CK?
Yep, that's America now days. Crooks and sexual predators run this country.
So easy to point the finger and in regards to male entitlement we have no entitlement in 2017 and i for one believe in equality if not specifically the toxic version of woman's lib we now see, the law society and especially the left is ready to crucify anyone with views opposed to their constantly and unimaginatively run mill of tags for each and everything they do not understand and feel threatened by and obviously this includes individuality. Seth  you are but a parrot and leave me unimpressed, not only that but because you are unable to stomach people who are  able to handle being what they are which in some cases mean masculine then that is an issue of your own.
Great call Seth, three of a kind.
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
Ha! \n\nLeftists own this week's news in sexual abuse. Same old song. Ask Monica, Paula, Juanita, etc\nStrange, after Harvey news comes out, whack job leftist lawyer files a bullshit request for documents from the lying Oct. surprise scum.
Give credit to the less-powerful men who harass women with sexual comments and physical assault. Don’t save it all for the sexually predatory celebrities!  Men don’t listen to women so it’s up to men to come together and speak out. There are so many decent men but if they remain silent the disregard for the humanity of women will never stop.
Both Trump and Weinstein are two perverted birds of a feather,\nin prison with matching orange jumpsuits they'll look good together.\nHere on Earth their wealth and power will help them both get away,\nthough after life SATAN may say, It's here in HELL you two shall stay!\n\nQ: Where do Trump and Clinton's vacation location overlap?\n\n A: On Jeff Epstein's pedophile island. \n\nMaybe despite the left/right rhetoric these establishment politicians (Trump/Clinton) and their major donors (Ailes/Weinstein) aren't all that different; power hungry narcissists who get off by dominating women and those weaker than them. Pretty typical behavior for clinical narcissists. Hope that there actually is an Earth deity called SATAN to punish these wicked powerful men in HELL as they will likely escape justice here.
Seth Meyers and Weinstein were buddies. Cut the BS, Seth.
Looks like the southern inbred redneck pissards shat their pants in rage when they saw this video. Those misogynist monkeys are worthless, they should be put down.
best closer look ever
http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration
more leftwing propaganda,so sad
Preach!!!!!
👍😎
Business meetings should not take place alone in a hotel room or bedroom. A red flag should be if someone wants to have a business meeting alone.
Is this were we ask Seth how many times he voted for some with last name of Clinton?
I personally think, for trump, its a Power Entitlement and the masogany came along with the power trip at a younger age growing up with a silver spoon shoved up his orange orangutan Ass .... I say that cause ANYONE who disagrees with Trump is going to be attacked in a middle school kind of way .... I'd just like to see someone knock trumps ass out if he says anything to their face .... Just cause you are president doesn't give you a pass at saying what you want to anyone ....
Where's Bill or Hillary?   To People watch late night comedy to formulate their political opinions, good luck in the coming civil war.
Words, actions... if you don't know the difference you should probably just kill yourself.
Oh no, we can't have a Connery-style Bond movie in the 2010s. The public won't tolerate sexism and non-consensual groping and kissing! This would be a scandal in modern times!! - Dude, you people elected Trump. Whatever you do, just don't be a hypocrite, okay?
I see a culture of systemically believing female accusers without proof.
Stop trying to divide our country by attacking the prez and spreading out right lies. Harvey Weinstein Needs to be delivered through Christ of his demons its a very serious thing and lots of people just make a joke about it.
WHAT? CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING? YOUR VIDEOS ARE TOO QUIET.
Name one women who claims trump raped her..  Bill Clinton on the other hand raped a little girl and got away with it by arguing that she wanted it. Who was his lawyer during the trail? Hillary the champion of womens rights. Its funny how the economy is at high and unemployment is the lowest its been in years. Good luck being 🐑🐑 cant wait to be 80 y.o and say i supported trump.
*God Emperor Trump* locker room banter joking  that when you're  popular women will  *let*  you do anything.\n\nAnyone to the left *Sexist, misogynist, sexual abuser* \n\nPerson with a brain where is your  *proof*  that he sexually assaulted anyone. \n \nThe left  He made *Jokes*  or more often they just lie.
Trump sounds like a 12 year old boy with his twitter fights, calling people names, etc. and all of these adults at his rallies listen to him and think he is smart and a great president. Are you f**king serious!? Also, it's hilarious his supporters have Drain the Swamp signs because Trump added to the swamp with Goldman Sachs executives, his campaign donors, and billionaires. Also, Trump bitched about Hillary (Goldman Sachs, cutting Wall St. regulations, adding soliders/war, jobs, unsecured computers, elites, etc.), BUT he is doing the same thing. Trump is a hypocrite and a conman.
Hate to break it to you, Seth, but you're a part of this systemic sexism. You and your peers were complacent in covering up for him and not speaking out.
slick liberals at it again......connecting Trump with Weinstein.....really slick technique...you reap what you sow!!
We all need to be aware of our viewing habits. Why is it so many films have gratuitous nudity and even simulated sex? What I've read, it's for the R rating. This rating, again from what I've read, brings people to view the film. Weinstein's behavior is the tip of the iceberg.
I find it funny right now that the comment section seems to be blowing up with conservatives on Trump on the liberal bias when the liberal media is not pulling its punches with Weinstein. Scumbags are scumbags. It just takes a larger scale scumbag to be bumped back into the spotlight in a comparable news piece. \n\nNewsflash, there may bad people on both sides, but there is no real claim to defend one scumbag by comparing them to another. That's worse than the Russians because they have the economy for the excuse. What do conservatives have for that? Civic pride?
No one will bring back Weinstein? How about  Sean Hannity who had Bill O'Reilly back 7 months after being fired for the same horrendous acts.
This is exactly how a male ally to women should approach this topic. For everyone in the comments trying to change the argument: why? Is it just me or is ending sexual harassment/ assault an easy thing to get behind?
It's not that I'm pro Trump but anti-Hillary/Bill. The Democratic party thought she and her husband this heinous couple were the best we deserved,this still makes me angry. I left the party because of it and have been party-less  since 1992. Bill was a predator too, but no one convicted him and NBC used to make little jokes about it at Seth's former place of employment. Also NBC has had such strong ties with Weinstein that their MSNBC channel wouldn't put out the breaking story. Rhonan Farrow had to get it out elsewhere.  Hillary, Bill, and the party knew that Weinstein is a degenerate as did EVERYONE in the industry, heck they all know Bill was and still is too!  but no one does anything about it. Your right Seth this won't stop until something gets done about it. So what are YOU going to about it Seth, call your Network bosses and read them the riot act, or maybe put away your I Luv Hillary More Life (and all semblance of ethics) pin. This blind eye mentality, and zealot devotion to the amoral Clinton's have put that very man you so obviously hate in the seat he sits in. So whose fault is it?
You're right Seth - you'd think The Donald would have been fired by now. BUT then we'd have Mike Pence as president - just a different form of wacky AND he's a Republican insider, which means they'd actually be able to pass some legislation and who knows how damaging THAT would be to the country.
SNL called Weinstein a well dressed skin tag. \n\nPerfect
It's nice from those actresses to be finally honest about sleeping their way to the top, right?\n\nAlways wondered why so many bad actresses are that highly paid. Wonder how many way better actresses we would have without someone like Weinstein you can just suck to get the job...
Harvey gets accused of sexual harassment, gets divorced, gets fired, all his friends ditch him, he goes into history as a disgusting pig.\nDonald brags about sexually harassing people, later becomes the president.\nI guess Harvey should have hosted The Apprentice.
Seth, sorry to break it to you, but Carmen is whiter than most white people. Not your everyday woman of colour.
Is this show always this great?
Not a supporter, but Pence's policy about being alone with a woman is part of his Christian behaviour. I grew up in church and this is typical behaviour, it's to do with propriety and making sure you always have a correct appearance. I have seen this many times. It is not ok though to take it out of context and say that the presence of others is the only thing stopping you from behaving like a pig.
I proud of you for handling this tastefully
The Weinstein case its a very very old news, here the proof: https://youtu.be/DVVaOPc_E-c Its on spanish but was published on 2015. Whats happening on Hollywood??
Goth Trump made my eyes feel so violated
no, no the flooded bathroom would be covered in gold

This is your president... have some respect dude. You going too far with this. I had to stop watching your show.
No Clintons or Kennedys?
O,o
Meyers YOUR AN IDIOT!!
Donald Trump? You mean Bill The Rapist Clinton, Seth.
While Trump talked the talk, Bill Clinton walked the walk; yet he warrants not even an honorable mention from leftist Seth.
Harvey is one of 10 thousand. And thats not including the pedos.
Donald Trump is crazy,i am sorry American they had no one better to be a President,,,so so sad

YOU SHOULD BE STOPPED!!! AND THE GOD YOU MOCK!!! WILL DEAL WITH YOU PERSONALLY!!! AND ALL WHO SUPPORT THIS EVIL ASS!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT DAY!!! WHEN YOUR ARROGANT SELF-ABSURD ATTITUDE IS EXPOSED FOR WHO YOU TRULY ARE!!!! BE ON GUARD!!! YOUR PUNISHMENT IS ON THE WAY!!!! THATS GOD'S PROMISE FOR THE WICKED AND EVIL PEOPLE LIKE YOU!!!

BECAUSE OF PRICKS LIKE YOU WHO THINK ITS OK TO SPEAK LIKE THAT OF OTHERS!!! MAN!!! YOU ARE IN FOR SUCH A RUDE AWAKENING!!! YOU TRULY ARE!!!! AND MOST DESERVED!!!!
I find it annoying that they use that he's a dinosaur as an excuse when there's tonnes of men that were born around the same time that don't sexually assault or rape women???
Seth is a liberal but puppet
Seth Meyers is neither funny, relevant, or worthy of widespread circulation.
Did you see that?\nwww.shooppingo.com
Great segment. Thanks for speaking up Seth & team.
He is an ornery misogynistic old cruddy white man.
Seth Meyers just kill yourself you're pathetic anyway just a matter of time cocaine & zepam medication are not a good mix !
Didnt Seth Meyers get his big break by working under Weinstain? Oh the shame of it!
You insult the winos
Seth you are a paid left wing shill. The mayor was a lying crybaby and Trump told how it was.
Equality.  It means you can criticize someone, even a woman.  Does that make Trump correct? No, he's terrible.  However, this idea that any criticism of a woman is sexism is a good reason so many either voted against Hillary or refused to vote altogether.\n\nKeep going back to the identity politics well.  I'm sure it'll work out for you in 2020.
1:12 Totally on Steh's side but how exactly is she a woman of color? Or did I misunderstand that part?
Trump is sexist and a misogynist because he criticized a woman but the criticism had nothing to do with her being a woman? I don't get it.
SHAME on you Seth Meyers for even comparing the two
Why frame a whole episode that is not different then others about trump as one about male power? Omg
Clever and fun
Thank you, Seth.
Holy crap. Its like he is reading a blog written by a 19 year old women's studies student. If you ever need an illustration of what a puppet looks like just remember this video.
all proud Americans should boycott all these trump hating anti us traitors. they are just doing lip service for hillary and all the snowflakes .they are not even funny.
lol @ you putting Weinstein and Trump in the same sentence. How about bill Clinton? LMFAO
Nothing will happen except punishment for the brave women who spoke out. The US won't change.
Where's bill Clinton??? How come you pussys don't him on the list he was a president
One is worthless and One is lowering my taxes and healthcare
Plenty to say about Trump, who merely *said* something bad in a locker room setting among his friends, but NOTHING here about Bill Clinton, who raped and molested dozens.  Nice.
Go look at the connections to this guy and the Democratic party \nOhh and now CNN is blaming Pokemon Go for Russian conspiracy theories now\nNot kidding. \nLate night television and media is a damn joke at this point, both are complete propagandists, at least I get a good laugh from all the mentally ill people who put on the show lol. Freaking dumb dumbs
LOL!!!  Every elitist pedophile ever known is a friggin Jew.. just ask Seth Meyers...he likes em young (and male..) and he's as kosher as a gefilte fish in a pickle barrel.
Comments full of russian trolls
HEY SETH GO SUCK KIMMELS DICK......ASSHOLE
This Seth guy is a typical leftist. Hey hypocrite boy, why not include serial philanderer Bill Clinton in your comedy piece? You suck! Your show sucks! FO!
¡¡ Harvey  for president  2020 !!!
Why the hell do people watch this guy. All those talk show host are saying the same, they are alike. But this dude is so not funny.
Liberal YouTube promoting liberal garbage. This show is crap like the sexual predators in Hollywood oh that this joke Seth Meyers is a part of.
You knew this whole Weinstein thing came out just so they could veer it into a Trump issue.  It's pathetic and won't work.  Liberal scum are just being scum as usual.
I really don't think Trump's feud with Cruz has to do with sex, its because someone challenged him publicly, he would have done and said the same if it were a man.
Thanks Seth!
The very fact trump is in the white house is proof of systemic sexism.
Seth your an idiot
Seth Meyers is not funny, but is irritating. Just another liberal mouth piece. He got his job because he knows how to kiss ass.
The Trump voter has failed America.
I think the Left is Completely missing the Point. Yes, if Trump is guilty of Sexual Assault on women then he should pay the consequence.\nHowever, So many Left Wing Celebrities have been spewing their Moral Superiority over the rest of the World, knowing what types of Evil they're working for - or even who They are at their core.
Reading these comments...sexual assault is not a political issue. It's a public heath issue. What the hell is wrong with you people?
Trump is a active racist and a retired sexual predator
Melanie's yawn in the beginning was contagious. 😳
It's so funny though, without make up you look even more alike :D\nSooo cute
Why are we so sexy though why? I'm working that chocolate&hormone-induced acne today like a profesh <3
Hey Melanie, you're not the only one who does their eyebrows last. 😂 I always do them last.
TEAM JESSIE, ALWAYS EYEBROWS FIRST 💁🏻
I do my brows first and then clean it up with concealer... melanie you’re crazy😂
As a guy I could shower, brush my teeth, get dressed, have breakfast, and still have 5 minutes to spare before this video finished.
Your reaction at 5:27 when Melanie was talking about her boyfriend hahahaha
Stopped listening to Melanie when Jessi was doing her brows - I was mentally cheering her on so hard, I had to go back and find out what Melanie said 😂
I can't do eyebrows or eyeshadow before foundation and stuff. I HAVE to do my base first 😂
I don't do my make up the Melanie way or Jessie Way as i am i lad who doesn't where make up i am afraid
This is EXACTLY what my tired ass needed to get up outta bed and make some coffee. Thank you Jesse and Melanie! You've allowed for one more human in this world to become fully functional (almost) ;)
I do my eyes, liner and lashes first than my face than eyebrows than lips😂
i do my makeup literally exactly the same as melanie hahaha
Haha for the first 10 seconds I thought they were speaking another language
I definitely do mine Melanie's way, is that weird?
omg jessie where is your shirt from?? i love it!!!
Aw bless yas! Spit of each other but a blue eyed and a green eyed version ; ) xx
i do makeup in melanie’s order!
The order I do my makeup is- \nprimer, \nfoundation, \nconcealer, \ncream highlight, \npowder to set concealer. (My face is dry so I don't usually powder it.) \nbronzer/contour, \nblush,\nBrows,\nEye shadow,\nSetting spray\nLiner,\nMascara,\nLips. \nAm I forgetting something?
I wish I would look like youuuu
Idk why but when Melanie says i need to look less dead, i think i look very ghostly, it just made me laugh so much!!😂😂😂
haha this is such a cool video idea, loved it! 😌
You girls should be models😱😍❤
You two have such lovely personalities💓
“Get off me wench” ~Melanie 2k17\nI’m using that on my sister form now on
After having a mental crisis this mornin i thought id watch your videos to help cheer me up and its done wonders. Thankyou both xxx
Always the Melanie way 💃🏼😂!! X
I do my make up in the same order as Melanie but also have been told I'm mad for doing so!!
I do my makeup the exact same order as Melanie's
Melanie, I do my makeup the same as you!! 😂😂👊🏼💜
Jackie Aina taught me to do concealer first and not blending it, doing foundation and then blending concealer last as it increases coverage when it dries a bit!
YALL MAY THINK YOU LOOK ROUGH BUT YALL STILL LOOK WAAAY MORE SEXY THAN I DO WHEN I'M HUNGOVER WITH MY HEAD IN THE TOILET XX
Haha it's so strange to see what order others do their makeup :) I always start with eyebrows, then eyeshadow and will then finally go onto my base makeup 😂
I agree with everything Melanie's saying & doing about her makeup😹💓
Love you guys so much 💖
I do it like Melanie hahaha
Ngl I yawned too
I do my makeup the exact same order as melanie, can't draw brows to save my life otherwise lol
I do brows 2nd! Foundation 1st and then concealer 3rd. Then blush etc., eyes and then lips
Haha cmon, there's no wrong way in which order you do your makeup :D it's completely p to you :D silly Mel! And about your question.. well, it depends. When I'm in a rush, like the very early morning when I'm trying to save every second just for longer sleep I do my brows first, and then mascara, basically the most important parts of my face so if I ran out of time I could go at leas with my eyes done or something like that. But when I have a lot of time I put all my foundation concealer etc. stuff first. It's actually better for me to do my brows after foundation etc. because I'm not afraid that I'll have to do some touch ups after or smudge perfect brows or something like that :) Damn, that's a long comment!
Melanie: like when i went to Spain to see my boyfriend...\n **Jessies face @ **5:28**** \n\nLMAO AHAH <3
Me today !!! Love you girls
I do my makeup, when I do it, the Melanie way!
I always do my eyebrows last 😂😂 the only way I can do it !
I do Melanie's way and I see I also uses most of the products she uses :)
I do mine the same as Melanie💁🏻😂❤️
I do my makeup the same way as Melanie 😂
Literally do my makeup a different every day 😂 I’m with Melanie if I have a new product I want to get it on my face asap 💚
Omg I say this on every collab, but how I WISHED I had a sister !! Ur relationship is so nice, I always wanted a sister :'( hahaha
i do my makeup in the exact same order as Melanie minus the blush because i don’t use blush haha
iLife my everyday makeup I use concealer, powder, bronzer, blush, highlight, brow gel, and mascara it takes no time because I would rather sleep before school but when I have time I put effort and I do the full sha bang
Love vids of ye two together, they're so gas! Reminds me of me & my 2 older sisters. My god though I never realised what a chatterbox Melanie is!! Hahaha xx
Foundation, concealer, powder, contour, blush, highlight, eyes, eyebrows, lips, mascara
You both look amazing!
My makeup steps:\nPrimer\nFoundation\nEyeshadow \nBrows\nMascara\nContour/blush/bronze\nLips
Pray for us #HurricaneOphelia
MORE.VIDS.TOGETHER.OMG LOVE YOUS
love thisss plz do more vids like it
7:30 xD
The order I go in is pore balm, whitening primer, cushion foundation, eyebrows, eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlight, lips.
When Mel talks I have to turn the sound up and when Jessie talks I have to turn it WAY back down again hahaha
Lol, i don't even have a routine, i just go with what ever haha
i have to do eyebrows first 😂
I thought it said get UNready with us after a night out! That would be a funny video seeing yous drunk trying to take off your makeup haha!x
You guys are so beautiful on the inside and outside even when you're hungover xx
Jessie that highlight is popping!! And i always do my eyebrows first too! :)
Those pencils you use freak me out.  I would 100% stab myself in the eye every time!  I do not have steady hands. :S
Jessie B where's the dress/top that you wear in Melanie's video from?! the strIPES!!!
I do my makeup like jess brows then foundation concealed etc. I do lips or highlight last :)
I know I'm super late but I just want to say thank you for uploading today I had a really bad day anxiety wise and really needed something to make me smile this video did that for me I love you both so much ❤️
Hahaha Melanie had a big drop of bb cream on her neck the entire video 😂😂 BTW I do my makeup like Melanie 😊
You two are the prettiest sisters 😍😍 love both of you and your videos 😗
I really want to get into makeup but I just don't know where to begin 😒
I always do my makeup the way Melanie done it. I can't function without having my base down first
Actually just started my period today for the first time in over a year (pcos) and I am miserable so I'm glad you updated today! Hope you're having a beautiful day lovely 💛💛
You should never say 'I'll only have a few drinks'! Such a bad plan, never works.  Still, they're often the best nights.
YES GIRLIES!!!!!!!!!!
Yay! Love this video! I do my makeup like Melanie...love you guys xx
where is you jumper from Jessie? I love it xxxx
you are both even more beautiful without makeup omg you are like flawless natural beauties <3
MY BEAUTIFUL GIRLS 😩😩😩😍 Jessieee we haven’t talked in a CENTURY I MISS YOU 😭 Also sorry but I literally do my makeup i the EXACT order as Mel and I’m actually shook, what. As always I LOVEEE the video and I’m so happy to see y’all together again ❤️❤️ Also Mel has a longer face but, Jess, yours is wider 😂👍🏻
I just want to hang out with you guys.
both of you have beautiful eyes💎
Oh I love this video you two are my favessss 🙌🏻 I did my make up whilst watching this it felt like when I do my make up w my best friends & we're all sharing products & judging each other's methods 😅 Your face when you got given that contour brush is me when I get any exam results 😂👌🏻is this a joke... is this actually a joke 😂😂🙈 It sounds like you had a great night before filming this video 😉👌🏻 Love ya ❤️
Love you guys sooo much! Great videoo💓
i do my makeup in a different order every time I guess 😂 am I the only one tho?
where is ur jumper from in this video? i love it x
Yes my two QUEEEEENS😍😍❤️💘 I love ye sooo much xxxx
I wish I had a sister! You guys are the best. And I totally do my makeup like Mel.
This video is hilarious :-)
My makeup order is base first and then eyebrows. If I do eyebrows first then I end up accidently erasing them when I do my foundation. Haha I guess I don't have Jessie's makeup skills. You both look gorgeous by the way, both pre and post makeup.
Team Melanie on the makeup order!!! All my friends think I'm so weird!
OHHH YESS THE SISTERS ARE BACK BITCHES💗💗 love this ...I only watch your make up videos I don't do my make up but I love watching yours ...you girls pull off the hangover look well 😍🙊🙏 hope you had a mint week Jessie xx
My favourite 2 youtubers ❤️
Funniest sisters going! ❤️
<3
Sister goalssss
Beautiesssss 💛💚
I use moisturer then concealer then foundation then powder then eyebrows the bronzer then highlighter then eyeshadow then lip stick   I'm. only 13 I probs do it wrong but I don't it the much  normally I just wear foundation  also you girls are so stunning

Can I get some subs
Well damn! I’ve been waited for this for 3 months and now finally its here. #WWEBattleground
Believer , thunder , demons and this
Can’t believe it’s taken me a week to watch this. I feel ashamed
Damm....They just can't make a bad song
I love Imagine Dragons. 😊 They the best. 😊 always motavating.
Is it me, but their songs have hidden associated with the name of their group
listen to our music and subscribe to our channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC54hE4YlQVImZ8BnPdhz8BQ?view_as=subscriber
This song is just great
I realize in here, that the vokalis pro rapper 😍
I would love to know how they made the music video
With all their songs blowing up, hopefully fame won’t get to their heads and change their music.
Why is no one here from WWE battleground :(
Your music always helps clear my mind and get me hyped up thanks for that
Wonder why there's triple routine
You made it Scotland!
Second favorite band <3 anyone else here fobsessed? Hint only Fall Out Boy fans will say yes xD
I really liked it
from Vietnam with love <3<3<3
Does anyone else think of the music video Take my picture by Filter?
Imagine GARBAGE! Oh wait, there's no need to imagine, you have these guys to remind you garbage exists!
the best band around at the moment
This him sayin he sell his soul.
the chorus is my least favorite part of the song lol
Still listening to this song after russ won MVP!! #THUNDERUP
I have a song about this! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EO-9Su8VCdc <— click this for whatever it takes x2
whatever it takes i will listen till i die
Great song I watched this six times now love it 😍
I wanna be like this dude when I grow up.
This is what a true artist looks like.
is it like a scene from a Titanic?
this is a FANTASTIC SONG OMFG!!!!!!!!
He looks so damn good in this video 😍😍😙
I LOVE U IMAGINE DRAGONS🙃🙃😁
I personally hate this one! I wish they'd go back to the same kind of songs as Demons and Radioactive!
I’m ready already for their next album. If y’all can get on that quick. K, thanks. 🤗
thankfully none of them were wearing jeans! That would be torturous! XD
Finally this song is getting popular
And once again, they make an amazing track.
This is my favorite song from the whole album😍
Directors: We're going to destroy TWO sets of instruments?\nImagine Dragons: WHATEVER IT TAKES....
I'm frankly disappointing in the music video. The intro and middle part had too many ideas crammed together, leaving you wondering what's it about and having you pause the video to figure it out. 2nd thing is why this many special effects? its not enough for it to be good, but not as many as relaxing and normal. Either use a lot like in believer, or not as many like top of the world, where it mainly used props. Last thing, why swimming? it doesn't contain too much action, yet you try to make it contain a lot of it. Deep sea diving/exploring the deep sea would be better in my opinion.  \n\nLove the song tho.
Man i hate it when random people start pulling and pushing me when i'm trying to sing underwater
A NEW SONG FROM THE BEST BAND
imagine dragons is the next thing closest to twentyonepilots.... literally i dont feel like i need any other music apart from twentyonepilots n imagine dragons ......i may be biased bcoz i luv ALTERNATIVE music... well thats just me
Not even getting close to despacito
This is the best band I've never heard of. Heard one of their songs on the radio and being a curious person, I looked them up and discovered this new world. Love the rythym and flow to their songs, also how it seems like power music in the sense it's uplifting and builds the hope within.
Imagine Dragons you’ve done it again
Is it just me or is someone else singing every song?
I'll be seeing you guys at Barclay center the 23rd :D
When you wanna fuck you do whatever it takes 😂
This made my day
This song is fire🔥🔥:D
Hello to anyone reading this! It would mean the world to me if you could just spare 2 minutes of your spare time to check out my guitar cover of this song over on my channel. I put a ridiculous amount of time and effort in to my music. Promise you won't be disappointed!
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SEE YOU GUYS LIVE IN CONCERT IN FLORIDA I love your songs and you are my FAVORITE band😃😃😃😃\nGreyson Peugh
I'll do whatever it takes to hit that repeat button....
Whatever it takes, 'cause I Love adrenaline in my veins !
Hey guys vote for imagine dragons for AMA to let them win.....

I love this song, and Imagine Dragons!
Reminds me of Kid Cudi- The Prayer
Imagine Dragon: -- ''' we have to shoot our video this week \nproducer :--Hurricane Irma will hit our filming location  in the very near future ..are you sure?\n Imagine Dragon : --  we'll do it ..whatever it takes cause we  love the adrenaline in our veins
To clarify, just because you can find an image on Google doesn't mean it's legal. This law is very loosly enforced but still is a law.
Too bad i don't give a shit, if i want a picture of the tower Im gonna get a god Damn picture of the tower.
That's just stupid...
I have the picture of it on my phone in night time whatcha gonna do?
W8 so I cant take a selfie at night at the Eiffel tower?\nPS...Plush Time Vlogs recorded the light show and uploaded it
CLICKBAIT VIDEO. What's your next video? Why bees technically can't fly?!?! Your channel should be called, Half as Interesting as Dirt.
Countries I will bomb China,India,Iraq,Iran,Afghanistan, Pakistan,Nepal,North korea,United States Of America,South Africa \n\nAnd new member \nFrance
So why aren't Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's Treasure or Ratatouille illegal?
Um ... no. In the US, you will never go to jail for violating someone's copyright. Sued for financial damages in a civil court maybe, but not jail.\nOf course this is France, but I still don't think so.
If they can't replicate it at night how did they make ratatouille
So it’s illegal because of fucking lightbulbs?!?!?!
“Think again, finkle” did anyone actually read that or is it just me?
I'm going to take a picture of it
To windy. If it was American we would stop all the wind.
This video was made possible because of viewers like you
Copyright can be kind of shitty
What is it with Europeans and their clauses?
You can show a picture because you’re not in France you’re in US so French copyright laws don’t apply
Uhhh what? I went to Paris last week and we visited the Eiffel Tower at night EVERYBODY had there phones out for pictures and there was a filming crew there
Gonna take a night pic if i ever visit france as a big fuck you to the euro fags
Well, guess Webdriver Torso is going to get a copyright strike then: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKvIyDB5FRU
This makes me so mad
Who the fuck wonders why there's no photos of the Eiffel Tower at night
That is very dumb.  Sorry French people, but it is.
0:53 can you atleast make the countries readable while paused? Because when I pause the video, the countries are too blurry to read. Or put them on a world map.
Did you know that the oldest Disney comic will have copyright elapse
What was the point of showing the Google review? I agree it was an asinine comment but it seemed out of place, a cheap dig against Americans.
I have pictures of the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower at night from 1983. The Louvre did not yet have the pyramid and the Eiffel Tower was not lit like it is now, so mine are legal to publish.  ha ha to you.
Shit I took pictures of the tower at night
was about to get him then u here it say recreationally browse... i dont think it means google included
*takes picture at Eiffel Tower*\nHEY, BUDDY! THATS ILLEGAL!\nOkay... It's just a building...\nYou now owe a fine of <x amount of euros>\nOkay... So who do I fill the check to?\nTo the artist that made it.\nDidn't he like die...?\nYou still owe him.\n*[screams in baguette]*
What about just blocking the video in France?
If I ever go to France, I'll have to take an illegal picture sometime.
you can find photos of these things on Google
When you blur out the Eiffel Tower... Oh you have me fooled what's behind that blur? And elephant? Another planet? The sun with a lollipop balancing on it? Wowzers you fooled me!
Copyrighting buildings is SO stupid
so basically all i have to do to extend a patent or copy protection for something in france is throw some Christmas lights on it?
But taking pictures or videos for private use should still be fine. You are not allowed to upload them but storing them privately would be legal.
Search Eiffel tower at night on google and there are hundreds if not thousands of pictures of it, at night.
I had no trouble finding nightime pictures and video...
Wow these French are Pansies.  Can't take a picture or a building.  A building for Christ sake.
Who else paused at 0:39? (the animator's message)
Why does adding lights to an existing structure constitute new art? Isn't it the same art, with modernized features? Aren't practically all modern structures lit with lights made in the last 70+ years and therefore subject to the same rights restrictions?
What dumb. U can just find vids and photo's of the Eiffel Tower on google / Instagram / YouTube and Yahoo.
Google has a thousand pictures of it at night
OW!! GOD I'M ILLEGAL : https://www.google.fr/search?q=tour+eiffel+de+nuit&num=50&newwindow=1&rlz=1C2CHBD_frFR693FR700&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-wfjE-vrWAhWjB8AKHfYPDxAQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=974#imgrc=EVgBSp2Rk6wfLM:
Just do it anyways. If they sue you just fucking sue them for being retarded little bitch.
There's legit a photo of the Eiffel tower at night hanging above me that I got from IKEA.
My dad took a picture of him by the Eiffel tower at night
I saw it at night Witt my own eyes
You're stupid... can't you use pictures and videos about the eif in this video for educational purpose only!?!?!? Why don't you show the copyright contract... this shit started feel fake shit\nSecond thing... you have to sure that people get noticed about the copyright... WHERE THE FUCK WAS THAT when I took a picture about the eif... tell me how stupid this channel is...
https://www.google.com/search?q=the+eiffel+tower+at+night&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQmuvu6vrWAhWn6IMKHf1vCcgQ_AUICigB&biw=1294&bih=1240#imgrc=LYJgUqOlHm3xGM:\nU! S! A!  U! S! A!
I love the eye-full tower.
european union members are basically one thing \n\n\n\nbut brexit...
Copyright laws have gotten out of freaking control when you can't even take photos or videos of public areas in certain places. \nWe can blame Disney for a lot of the silliness
Go get a life, you architectures
You could technically get around that. Personal photos aren't going to be targeted, you would mainly have to worry if you ran a stock photo site
Hey my computer was built like 6 months ago, I guess you can't take a picture of it because f*ck you.
Shit I have to delete my memories now plus the pictures of my house, a random picture of me because I am still alive,  I can't picture loom bands, can't record videos, can't take pictures of the light bulb currently above me ugh the list goes on and on.
well that's useless. why build it if people can't even take pictures of it to show across the world? kinda makes those architects look douchey suing over pictures
Is the lighting of the eiffel tower in Las Vegas a copyright infringement?
1:25 I search the guy who say boring videos if the coms are true
U could say I never wanted u to build there
Wait why books have some of these pictures ....
IBE NEVER SEEN A FUCKING VIDEO OF FRANCE WITH ANYTHING BLURRED THE FUCK OUT. this video is so fucking stupid
So why has no one copyright claimed Google? Google images is a commercial domain, no?
I took the eifel tower photo at night
Nobody would go to jail over this, fines possibly...
Copyrighting a building... Oh fuck off
But I have a picture of the Eiffel Tower at night
making photos for personla use is fine though so your vacation photos wont be an issue
The problem here is that most people never asked for the tower to be built in their city so its completely wrong to just have it sitting there taking up so much space in peoples vision and then saying well this whole portion of the skyline cannot be used in anything commercial. so stupid
Guess u didn't see neymar presentation at night
lol,, google image have a lot 
Bullshit lol
I FUCKING RECORDED IT AT 10PM WITH LIGHTS OMG HDJSJS LMAOOO
CLICK BAIT!

Big fan of your channel, was just wondering if you could do a video on the offshore floating wind farm that's being built in Scotland
Should work great in orbit with a small nuclear reactor as the power source.  Subzero temps, low level of O2 defensive means to ICBM’s and space junk.
Is it possible to convert heat into electricity?
It's already in service on a naval ship.
When created, RODS FROM GOD.
The book “Ghost Fleet” features the Zumwalt class with a rail gun in a future war against China. Fiction but based on actual technology and politics.
Portable railgun, https://youtu.be/FILJznSr6fs
Do a video on the BFR SpaceX
Nice one - what you built here is just great
I'm a simple man; I see railgun, I hit like.
Sellout Mr. Theeta?
https://goo.gl/rM7CTt
might as well just further improve long range laser beam thing thingy turret thing
Ey mate I like that you introduce all this cool science stuff and even give US a Chance to try it out. Almost majes me feel Bad that im such SMA dumbo
Does not seem like rail guns are the solution to much of anything. Rail guns require an impressive power source, whereas chemicals are so much more simpler. In fact the good solution seems to be liquid propellant. Also you get such diminishing returns in high velocity because air resistance goes up so fast relative to velocity.
why do u need this when i could just flick a coin up and make a finger gun
This gun is the armor killer
This technology was already used in Final Fantasy 8. Esthar  scientists shot Squall and Rinoa into space to Lunar Station.
Your voice reminds me of someone from FNV: Honest Hearts, Follows-Chalk I think
cowardice america needs desperate hype advertising-we need minimum of 50 allies or no war =cowards and hype to cloak lackey truth
us ships will crash into each other as always...not a prob\n\nor on island\n\nor on pelicans\n\non basically everything
REGION LOCK THIS FOR KOREA!!!!
Is It just a metal stick or does It have any gunpowder in It?
One EMP blast and its useless
The second biggest boondoggle after the F-35\nLiterally the heat is melting the rails...limiting the rail gun to a few shots before it breaks...LOL
Isn't easier to make stronger bullts
Real talk for a sec, without even watching the video i can tell its bullshit because the actual most powerful gun is secret.
Late to the party. China has bigger better faster guns then US. Which explains why American just floated around SE chinasea and now just talk w NK. Lol they are laughing like the rest of the world. Funny how Americans just talk and no more walk.
Going to the last part of the video (the advert)\nAh yes- something that is missing in pretty much all schools:\nIf you made a mistake- be told why it's wrong.

Great Irish channel!
I want to learn more about engineering. I don’t know nearly enough.
1:13 the explosion is from an underwater nuclear test (1946)
False: Chuck Norris is most powerful gun
who the hell needs universal healthcare anyways?
Shoot Someone with it
Yes, I understand some of these words
Forget railguns. we already have the technology to finish operation: Star Wars
I have a rail gun on gta 5
Whether you love the US or hate the US we are the best chance Ally countries have at surviving war regardless of how crappy our leadership is at the moment. I'm so glad I live in the USA! Very interesting video btw!
Make it like the mini gun roataing barrles. In masseffect there guns use two barrles to help cool the gun before it overheated. So make our rail gun like a mini gun.
Most powerful pfft my farts is the clear winner
Okay but when will we be running around in Power Armour carrying a small one of these at our waists and ripping through aliens and shit like in Halo
BAE systems is not from usa DUH
1:27 why did you use Angola as target example, that's very rude and offensive
Make a video about Gas propulsion Engine
Nice video.\nInteresting how you showed bombarding Angola during the range comparison
A railgun? Now all you need is a Metal Gear to carry it.
Effectively a rail gun is the Justice League Space Station that orbits earth. Using the Stations mega gun requires the entire stations energy, and once fired, shuts down the station of all electric power for the next hour. It only retains orbit via emergency backup generators. Wow.
*generic comment about the US military that makes me an expert
Subscribe to my channel CJ Collins
Trump is America's most powerful gun, because he destroys anything he gets near!
At least it's not 1.21 gigawatts.
No better catalyst for technological advances than war
Yes..... The perfect thing to wipe out humanity from the face of the earth.
I think all guns bombs and weapons *not knifes* should be thrown away crushed and then thrown into the ocean for a long away generation to find then blow up the planet and not us :) im **copyright cannot show** and i think the government are stupid in some ways
Their most powerful weapon is not confront strong countries. Only peasants in Afghanistan and Vietnam.
The US military's most powerful gun... built and designed by the British.
5:28 We'll also need them for the covenant.
now do Germany

You said the current rail only lasts a few shots, that is incorrect.  It lasts hundreds of shots but it is short of the qualitative requirement for 1000 shots.
A rail gun?? What’s next a metal gear
I'm sure it can be built in less than 50 years.
The U.S. militaries technology is at least 20 years ahead of a US regular folks technology. Of course THEY want THEM to believe this is the best THEY have.
Why, when on restricted mode, can't I view this video? It's more about math and magnetism than war, and destruction.  Come on youtube!  Keep working on these, Real Engineering! Your videos are awesome!
Similar to the MAC cannon from halo
Except there are treaties about the militarization of space, as in you can't, and railguns wouldn't be allowed most likely
So...the man-portable railgun from MGS4 is probably not practical in the slightest, then
Considering there's talk about an asteroid the size of a country has a chance to hit us, having a giant railgun in space isn't a bad idea
I used to live like 50 steps from the military base that they shot this video at dalgren naval base in Virginia
Say don’t rail guns also work in space because no explosion is necessary?
I would consider the atomic Annie to be the most powerful gun to be honest.
Can you do an episode about different was to extract oil/gas from the ground? Feel like you would like learning about it, if you don't know much already
Anyone else notice the Canadian flag at 0:51
Wouldn't the acceleration at the moment of the shot destroy a satellite that was to be sent to orbit by it?
A Certain Scientific Railgun. Always comes to my mind whenever I hear, or think of Railguns.
Imagine this going through your body *ROBLOX OOF*
Add 0.1th of a gram of antimatter on the tip of a round and you can practically destroy a tank or a house with one shot from a handgun.
Be care full not to explain it to deeply otherwise your enemy will use it against you
Most likely wouldn’t be heard in the comment section but this is how I would solve for the rods constantly destroying itself.\n\nConductive oil/lubricant. Or even lubricant or oils.
What about a tungsten coating or alloy to offset the thermal problem, or even using a liquid nitrogen cooling system?
Could something like this be applied to a rifle design?
2:25 wrong way around, the current should be flipped. Fleming left hand rule. This isnt a generator.
Good job! Should have talked(more) about its vulnerability from heat seeking missiles and counter-measures taken, too.
No one wants this shit, just do mcgregor vs Ferguson
Conor needs to return back to the Octagon. He better not continue in gaylord boxing.
Conor is the a side as they say so get in the cage with him
This dude is still thinking about Connor's balls.
Who da fuck wants to see Paulie ina ring again, get the fuck outta here....
Paulie bring your balls and fight Conor in a REAL fight
this guy is easy money for Connor Mc gregor !!!!!!!!
Conor better not fight in the ring. He got to defend his titles.
sit down and wait in line Paulie. you are 4th in line maby
Hey Paulie, take Conor’s balls out of your mouth, we have a hard time understanding you as it is.
Washed up no power Pauline. Still trying to stay relevant. Nigga worse than a female.
I GUARANTEE MALINAGGI WOULD KNOCK THAT IRISH CUCK OUT COLD. NO HEART AND NO BALLS. DEE DEVLIN WILL BE WORKING AT GIRL COLLECTION TO PAY THE BILLS
Took the best boxer that boxing has to offer 10rds. Mma best won't give Pauline or mayweather 30 seconds.
if Paulie had such big balls then why don't be get in the cage
No fucker would be interested in paying to see a fight with this Shmucko...
Refuses to step into the octagon/ a REAL fight = The very Definition of NO BALLS!!! FYI McGregor already stepped into the boxing world!!!
If conor had no balls how about u do what he did and cross over!! Face him in his sport like he did with mayweather...yh right lol...no chance youd do that cus u know...u know ur a pussyhole
paulie is delusional lol hes never been a ppv star, doesnt have a title and lost most of his last few fights.......Dude got more fame sparring conor twice than he did when he was boxing. be grateful and keep it moving paulie
PAULIE SOUNDS LIKE A BITTER EX GIRLFRIEND.. STILL TALKING ABOUT CONORS BALLS.. REAL TALK HE SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE WHO GOT HIS ASS WHOOPED AND WANT A SECOND CHANCE TO REDEEM HIS PRIDE.. UNFORTUNATLY HIS PRIDE IS IN CONORS BACK POCKET
is this faggot still talking he will get dropped in the 4th or 5th round
Didn’t this clown get kod with a body shot in his last fight against a nobody name Eggington beat it paulie
Come to MMA or shut your mouth.
go fight in the UFC you no balls having mother fucker.
as an alpha male, you don't try this hard to get one back on a dude if he didn't kick your ass once. Paulie just got handled in sparring. big deal
Paulie  what are you talking about...you punch like a bitch!!!
He sure says balls a lot
PM U JUST A HIGH DEF TROLL LMFAO
Would love it if this fight happens. Never happier to see paulie getting knocked the fuck out!!!!
Sick of hearing this prick talk man
paulie man i love yea man but in a reall fight you die man.so dont be calling him a pussy
Get paulie into the octagon against conor, and then rematch conor floyd in the octagon, and lets see how long they last in there.
Who the fuck wants to see this ? I really haven't  seen any positive feedback from people on this fight. If this happens to be Mcgregor's next fight, he has to vacate the belt he cannot expect to put the division on hold for another 6 /8 months. He hasn't fought since Nov 2016 & it would be close to two years if this does happen .
who da Fook is that guy??
This is Paulie try to make money talk  😂😂😂😂😂
Why don't McGregor fight Canelo, he did so good against mayweather it should be a good fight right MMA fanboys?
Shut up you moron this guys doing my head in with that mouth I'll step in that ring with him and I have no boxing experience at all and still kick he's moaning ass...... Bored.
PURE BOXING IN THE OCTAGON WITH 4OZ GLOVES MAKE IT HAPPEN DANA
this guy is a walking mouth
Woahhh ground breaking info ....a boxer can beat a non boxer in boxing and an MMA fighter can beat a non MMA fighter in MMA. \n\nIn other news water is wet and fire is hot.
Love you Paulie and everything you do but I can't wrap head around when you say he's got no balls...he wanted the fight so he stepped up into the boxing world..maybe one of you guys should step into the octagon..if your not pussy
I’m a boxing fan first, but paulie is getting annoying as fuck begging for this fight. He got knocked down and he’s still salty as fuck.
Says he's got no balls yet doesn't want to fight him in mma ok
It ain’t gonna happen Paulie. Paulie is broke that’s why he is running his mouth
Paulie....get in the octagon...or STFU with the pussy shit!!!...you don't have a hair one on your tiny little balls, McGregor got into the ring with the GOAT ...which takes balls no matter what (even if it is just boxing)...that having been said, Paulie throws the terms pussy and no balls around quite a bit for a guy who KNOWS there isn't a snowballs chance in hell he'd fight under MMA rules!!! Paulie should be thanking Conor for making him even remotely relevant!!!
Call a boxer bitch like canelo or broner not a none boxer
Doubt any real  boxing or MMA fans would have the slightest interest in this farce after the previous one.
Come to the octagon Paulie before you start talking about balls.
MMA mate u want it bribg ur balls go to his sport
Bro Paulie with a full camp? Forget about it. And you know he’s gonna be training at TMT
You ain't getting it Paulie. No one cares about you, Conor & Dana have bigger plans sorry pal
McGregor gonna fight with a real fighter next : Tony Ferguson. Not your bum ass
Let's see Conor vs GGG \nOr Canelo vs Conor\nNot this pillow puncher who got embarrassed by Conor
You fil step in the octagon show your ballsack
Coward. At least meet halfway and fight under Muay thai or K1 rules.
i wont watch this garbage. it’s another con.  crap
Omg are we talking about diarrhea mouth Connor \nConnor  box like a fucken 12yr old kid boxing his first match
Fuck this little Rat. He cant fight for shit and talks shit. Just like Floyd. Even i would woop dat ass. Boxers Are the easiest opponent for grapple/kickers
In the Octagon Conor McGregor would whoop your ass and Floyd Mayweather's ass in one night
This just has to stop now 🤦🏽‍♂️ he got his ass whooped and he just begging for another one with a payday and it's embarrassing
paulie about to talk himslef into about 20-25 million.. not mad at him
Shout out to Tommy gun , come to my house and you'll be the dinner you fucked up little pussy , going to my videos and calling my daughters whores? You'll never know how lucky you are sitting behind your keyboard. And I notice you've deleted all your comments. You best pray we never meet.
God plz no.
Paulie is selling this right, playing with Conor's ego by daring him.......i hope it works so we get to know the truth!
Paulie such publicity stunt clown . Everyone knows Conor just made a social media post about a fight with Tony Ferg
Your no Floyd.  You'll get dat ass whipped!
'conor has no balls'\n\nfirst of all, you aint even competed in MMA.\n\nsecondly, it takes a lot of balls to compete and win in the ufc so go figure
Can this guy just fuck off, I'd rather see Conor defend against Tony or fight Nate in the trilogy. None of this boxing bullshit anymore, if these faggots want a payday they can go to the octagon because Conor is the draw not them. Conor vs Floyd was an exclusive boxing match and Conor has no business in the ring anymore.
I hope Conor knocks his fucking head off! I can't stand that whiny little bitch
Nah...not interested in this fight in boxing or mma.  I’m sure Paulie would beat him in boxing and McGregor would kill him in mma.  But would rather see Tony Ferguson fought McGregor to legitimize lightweight division, anything else is a side show.
Lol yhh I'm ready for this
Who the fuck is that guy?
Who wants to see that shit again... Boring and circus shit..
Bring it to the octagon!
Whoever Conor fights next, he'll be labelled a pussy for not fighting whoever he's not..
Paulie stop it its about the money u will get like 10 mill for the fight ur biggest pay day
Malignaggi needs to start getting back in shape now
Awesome! If that fight gets made I hope it's a boxing match in a square box.
I hope Conor's been putting in them miles on the road
This dude Paulie is probably the biggest cuck on my radar right now. The dude is grasping at straws to stay in the spotlight and get Conor to take a fight with him so he can get a decent payday for minimal work. Can't say I blame him, but he really needs to get real with himself and fuck off. Saying Conor has no balls despite the fact that he just boxed the greatest boxer even? This coming from the same guy that claimed Conor never touched him yet we saw video evidence to proof otherwise. Paulie just kind of seems like a pitiful schmuck who's career is over yet he clings to the media to try and stay relevant.
paulie still salty cuz he got his ass whooped. pussy forever.
Paulie Pillow Punches
paulie got hair implants! LMFAOOOO
HAHAHAHAHA Paulie would be MURKED....  WE ALL SAW WHAT HAPPEND
Everyone already forgot about paulie
Conman No Balls Mcbum knows Paulie is speaking facts.... Stick to the wrestling octagon gay ass Mcfaggot.....
Still fucking whining
In Boxing, Paulie whoops his ass, nuff said.
Fuck off you greasy Wop!  Go back to shitstain Italy you ugly Dago!  #TRUMP #MAGA #WHITESONLY
uploading anything about Paulie is an immediate dislike lol.
your a bitch Paulie
MMA 11 yr olds don't want to see Pauline the bitch cock slap Mcgregor the puff 😂
Danm this dude sounds sooo salty nothing but hate coming from this pussy!
Still concussed? Pauline?
Balls.
Hes calling people pussy with earings?
UFC never released the FULL UNEDITED 12 rounds sparring vid smh
This parrot still talking?
Does anyone believe this will happen.
Paulie a good boxer Conor doesn't stand a chance.
Shut up paulie you a bitch if Conor that much of a punk why did he beat your ass man shut the hell up Conor ain't cumin bak to boxin he's got things to take care of in the UFC i.e. Tony ferguson Nate why the fuk wud he b bothered about a little punk weasel like you bitch

One schmuck is leading the green and the other is trimming the red--what did you THINK was going to happen?!
The drivers may be retardet (sic), but your spelling is retarded.

Damn I would hate to live in Russia

73 questions with little Liza
Not Helga
She’s a legend 👌🏾
love you pink you are so amazingly talented keep doing you
Pink is hot stunning woman talented singer songwriter actress and dancer alot of people would want to work with her
Why do her mannerisms remind me of Melissa McCarthy?
Freaking LOVE HER! 😎👍
Where else can I say this...\n\nI love pink!!!!!!
P!NK is soooo cute! She's probably the coolest down to earth mom. Been a fan since Most Girls. She still has the same personality.
I LOVE YOU, P!NK\nPlease perform in Super Bowl Halftime
Yup just bought a ticket. She is coming to Australia.
Don't you mean she cries when he sings?
I also cryied when my mum sang to me when I was a baby
when will eminenm guest in the tonight show?
The one song I HATE (and deleted) is the next single. 😣
Jimmy you have 2 more year as the host... You're starting to feel fake, like super cringe!
How can you cry on such shitty music she is just like crap
I LOVE HEERERR SO MUCH!!!
Her son isn't the only one crying when he hears her awful songs.
I don't know about anybody else but She is still beautiful. And still married to the man who did the first backflip on a a dirt bike!!!😀
Go 'head, Big Sis. I just love P!nk. I love her personality and her will to not give in to trends.
Their pictures with them all bending the gender lines to push the filthy marxist luciferian hollywood agenda of post-genderism and ambiguity is digusting.
Love her!! This album is underwhelming but she is amazing!!
I like their song together on Recovery. I would have been shocked if Eminem said no to her after she’s been on one of his tracks.
Does she love Eminem after threatening to drop all his fans if they don’t drop Trump.  Thug...
Maybe coz her music has lost its edge? Just kidding but I really do miss the early 2000s
Pink+Eminem
Jimmy is so sweet!!!
This is some normie shit.
Such a nice Person :)
pinks awesome. Jesus this guy is cringe to watch tho. So fake with his laughter. Are all american talk show hosts this bad?
Jimmy tries too hard to relate with his laughs and comments. Lots of guests just seem to smile and put up with him.
Гуф Умер!
 we work with the same people like Rihanna, i know that she is way hotter than me , but i'm funnier LOL i' ve loved her
mayb he cries because mammy has an angry face alot when she sings
oh  so sweet !
Jimmy loves everything lol
My *Meatball* I was like AWWWWWWWWWWWWW and i cried\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I saw the girl singing and I screamed *SHE SO DAMN CUTE*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRihanna is so much hotter than me but I'm *funnier*
I think Jimmy has a little crush on Pink and who could blame him!!!   xox great interview
She's an amazing woman!
#get rid of jimmy fallon because he's not funny
Pink should do next super bowl halftime, cuz she's is awesome!!!
So, I've emailed Marshal...\nThats a different level xD
i have't seen a Pink Eminem... nah!
Pink suit to the VMAs is literally LIFE!!!
I'd like to see Pink's bean.  I'd also love to play with her bean.
She's so great, god, I thank the universe for people like her.
I love to hear her lagth, I think I would tickle her for a long time just to hear it.
Fire Starter,.....lol, priceless,....and actually, she does, lol, and that lip synch part, ha, amazeball's!!  Love her, and her new album is amazing :D
Love it!! Check me very fast bass player https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjY1UtIWmDN4sDXtpt2hIg?sub_confirmation=1
The part where she talks about Revenge and how she was drinking wine and wanted a Rap Grammy and asked Eminem and whatnot-- she gave that interview on the radio here in New York VERBATIM like to the point I was just wondering if they edited out Jimmy and put in Elvis Duran's voice like every little joke she made and EVERYTHING. Until Jimmy interrupted her joking along about the email it was EXACT. Like, I get that they have to tell the same stories over and over and shit when they're doing promo for an album and especially for one specific single BUT usually their answers are slightly different seeing as they're talking to someone different etc... this literally like was weird and made me feel like she's a robot HAHA. Seriously google the interview if it's up and you'll see... so weird. Ver-bay-Tum. Lol\n\n  Incidentally, Revenge is my favorite song rn like I LOVE it hahahaha it's just different and cool and funny. Also I love Eminem so there's that. Two thumbs up. (That song, plus the interview, actually made me DL the entire album and so far I've listened to like half of it and it's great, I highly recommend it).
If you sub to me I will sub to you
I cry when she sings too and at my age I'm nearly deaf.
Time is a heartless bitch to me,,but Missy Pink is holding up really well.   Funny stuff.   Meatball and Firestarter,,Ha!,,,  Kids have a bright future,  so long as their mom has a good heart, which she does.   Good luck Mom!
who cares? this bitch is ugly
P!NK has been around forever, yet I notice she's only recently been really famous, I don't get it.
what a brave transgender pink is. and what an Adonis belt!
Too bad cant afford to see her live
March 1st is my birthday!!!!!!! I will be 18!!!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU PINK
He cry’s because he hates her voice.
Pink is cool. M&M is a douche-bag.
Me too, she's not very good
I see Eminem in the description I click.
P!NK went to school with my mom in highschool
Pink is ugly,  and her music is bad, and shes stupid.
Shes so genuine and beautiful..good on you ms lady!
have u guys thought of P!nk doing the Superbowl Halftime show?
She’s fucking awesome! \nCan’t wait to see you in New Zealand
why at 0.28 does he always do that fake laugh?
Yo is she the one, Simon said was trash??
Give leading please export potato offer site treatment identical category.
I died when she said Eminem
P!nk and Em? Never even imagined it but now I can't stop wondering!
I love this woman! So excited for the new album and hope she brings her tour to the UK!
Ughhhhh STFU and let her speak
I cry when she sings too. Because I miss the old Pink. Now all of her songs are practically all the same.
Pals rate Anyone  identify bigger  this case? laxghing
I cry whenever she sings
Pink: Hi\nJimmy: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I would be honoured to have anal sex with PINK.
She is so cool...
pink is not her real  name but she is good i love  her
I want her to be my Mommy. :D
I thought this was going to be a really sweet story about how her son loves her voice so much he cries when she sings... oops XD
1 minute long ad before the video WHOA
She is lovely.
I love pink
Love me some P!nk. ❤ #Awesome
Ugh I love her dress. Ugh I love her.
YOU'RE fat ! He cries because you're a bad celebrity.
If she didn't look so damn stupid we might actually pay attention to her voice.
I can't handle the pitch of her voice. She sounds like she's complaining about a co-worker.
Minute Earth: Well\n\nDrug Addict: THEY COME FROM PINK FAIRIES MADE FROM BACON
Great video!  But Tacrolimus has many more uses that just treatment for Eczema.  It has revolutionized transplantation as an anti-rejection drug!
Why don't you also do a video about hippos? And the difference between the crocodile and the alligator?
In short, drugs are made from fungi 😂😂😂
Just went to talk at the University of Minnesota with Dr Salomon presenting about this stuff. Extremely interesting and innovative.
Every time my mom puts a banana in my lunch its smell and taste gets somehow infused with the rest of the lunch. If you could make a video explaining this that would be great. Thanks!
From the cute 11 year old boy next to my house\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm 91
From the drug store, bruh
I dont know why but i get the best chills watching minuteearth and even get my eyes wet...
One teaspoon of soil a day will keep the doctor a stone's throw away.

Where Do Our Drugs Come From?
Is it just me, or do they use Dutch Haagel Slaag alot in their vidoes?
00:02 to 00:10\nThe REAL question is WHAT the hell is it in the remaining medications?
I just get it from that sketchy guy behind Walmart.
wait Minnesota!? thats the state i live in
How come researchers don't try mutating fungi to target the MRSA bacteria common in hospital? \n\nLike put a certain type of fungi that's enemy with the staf bacteria and see if it mutates after several generations to become resistant to the MRSA.
YouTube copy the minuto do mundo
Hello, please provide translations, thank you.
Sooo...The ice cream truck isn't the only place to buy drugs?
The CIA is where they originally came from. LSD
Mostly colombia and Mexico
You're looking for a guy named Heisenberg, you didn't hear it from me😑
They came from the pharmacy, duh.
It’s from that Ugandan warlord
The world is brutal by nature, killing is a necessity to live.
Imagine the really useful ones they don't release to the public.
The art of XKCD and the voice of Marzipan from homestarrrunnner, it's a winning combination!
1:59  right hand column 4th one down,  we discovered aeroplanes from leeks?
Oh I thought this was about drugs like cocine, meth or others
We should get rid of the current education system and instead replace them with a movie like experience, where all the students get like ridiculously comfy chairs, a big screen with everyone in front of it, popcorn or snacks of any kind with drinks, and just play minute earth and minute physics videos. Guarantee you this, whatever the official number is for the amount of students that succeed through their lives will skyrocket compared to how it has been. An 8 year old could watch this and learn without confusion. This world is very far behind where it could already be, people like the people here at minute earth are what we need.
my plug, Kevin. shoutout to him
Easy drugs come from hell
Yes, the University of Minnesota is a major source of knowledge regarding medical research (I will get treatment there for chronic tmj)
Why cats hate water
So hot!!!
im allergic to penicillin
penecilin dosnt exist anymore... newer and newer antibiotics have to be made all the time because with every new antibiotic comes resistance and adaption by the bacteria. Good luck this will be a massive problem eventually and everyone will get infected.
God like all things
I already have the smelly socks one :P
This was a waste....
, .
In another universe, fungi and bacteria are taking Guns and Nuclear Weapons to treat their infections of humans.
So live in forest and start pharmacy!
My dealer usually makes me jerk him off, but never gives me the drugs. Why is that? He even pinky promised.
When theyre really imported from government officials
I thought you were gonna tell us ur dealer
What about the remaining 3/10 chemicals?
i think antibiotic or antimicrobe that bacteria pump out have another purpose. Some journal say it used for signaling neighbor microbe with chemical substance rather than killing them.
Biggest opium plantations are guarded by the military. Take a wild gues, DUURRRRR
2:20 This bacteria with stinky socks, made me smile;p
What about the other 3?
I'm now more curious about the other 3/10 drugs
Don't get me wrong, I like Kate's voice, but there's something... unusually high and squeaky about it. Does the recording software not do her voice justice? Or does she really sound like a chipmunk?
What do they say about the guy who brings mushrooms to the party?\n\nHe's a real fungi!\n\n**rimshot**
I live in mn
Thank you MinuteEarth, for always making content that keeps me excited about science and the subtle complexities of our world.

Fuck you fuck boy.  Eminem is a shitty rapper, this rap was shit and you apparently are a litter box of a person.   Fucking tool
Eminem actually has a Zac De La Rocha flow on this
Right now I want an Eminem rap-metal album
Ahh, I smell the tears of Trumpflakes on the breeze.
You convinced me that 2017 RATM need Em not Zack. lol
So many butt hurt Trump flakes in the comments
such a great song choice. i was thinking myself of what kind of beat would work under this freestyle, and you nailed it. ratm fits both musically and politically.
This is banging
this gonna be the anthem  for the resistance
it's honestly the perfect mashup. fuck the haters.
Donny's bitches are salty about a freestyle by a reportedly irrelevant rapper.
You are still the best mash-upper od the world!
That was pretty great, Sir.
I got banned 4 times from Facebook this year for talking shit to Trump fuckbois, it's almost as if they need a safespaces or something, fucking snowflakes.
It felt really awkward without a beat, so yeah, this is fucking gold.
Great mix. S**t message XD. Great job, Mr. Cummerbund XD.
How phucked are we when Eminem has a higher moral compass than our president?!? LOL
Omg two of the best mashed up!! Miss RATM but love that the message can be sent with music!!
I have to say it's nice mash up. I really like Eminem and RATM <3
Fuck yeah!
FUCK YEAH!!!
OMFG yes. God damn.
The upcoming civil war is gonna have some banging music
This shit slaps
Oh yeah, trumps a bitch!
Killin it
Look guys, Trump and his supporters have it really rough right now, and I don't think it's fair to keep making fun of them.  Sure, they've made some mistakes: their entire party is being swarmed by white nationalists and neo-nazis, the Russian collusion investigation is gaining steam every day, Trump is constantly saying and doing things that are either hypocritically stupid or patently false, their healthcare has been sabotaged, they're mentally gearing up for Twitter-ignited war with North Korea, they're convinced a Muslim terrorist is hiding behind every corner, their country is constantly losing political clout with its allies, they've been inundated with both domestic and and foreign propaganda campaigns, they're being mocked by the entire world, and not a single thing has gone right for them since Hillary lost the election.  Not to mention the fact that Hillary still isn't in prison, the Wall still hasn't secured funding, the swamp is still full, the job market in rural America is still falling, the plan to defeat ISIS still hasn't materialized, and America still hasn't become any greater than is was last year.  Everything they've been promised has been a lie.\n\nWe should take pity on these poor, dumb souls who are so invested in the Trump presidency they would rather die in nuclear hellfire than admit their leader is not doing a good job.
Why does this work so well?
this is hard and u kno it
This is amazing bro. Nice job. Rage and Em should collab on Ems new album coming out
OMG make this happen for real love RATM and Eminem!!! Prophets of Rage also very good tho, but if they get new vocals Eminem should be the replacement.
You know, I was skeptical of how good this was gonna be. But damn. That's a pretty legit mash up.
Holy shit this is amazing. Well fucking done.
When I first heard Eminem’s freestyle, I was like “Eh, that was okay I guess.” This mashup with Bulls On Parade enhanced by a million times. And I loved the quick Macho Man cameo.
fucking epic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i luv u all, thanks o/
Awesome! A rarity that a mash up actually works!
This was uploaded on my birthday. Thanks for the amazing present, DJ Cummerbund!!!
This is such a smart mix. Loved it.
Sounds a lot better than the new prophets of rage album
pure shit
Some billionaires know pretty well how to earn big money and fame easily with social anger. Easy money. I admire it.
This is fucking great
This is fucking great!
love during the choruses you can hear faint glimpses of a zack de la rocha sound alike as backing vocals
That was fucking awesome. I don't know how you got Zack's voice to overlay with Em's but that was fantastic.
this is awesome work. although i dont agree with eminens rant...hes targeting the wrong person...its not trump, its the whole government system - trump is just the logo these next few years - but the work in this mashup is freaking excellent! well done
Rage is the best Eminem is nothing without rage. Rage is god, rage is life. Zach is god
This needs to be an MP3 so I blast this down the road driving
This is sick!!!!\nEminem and RATM doesn't get much better!\nThe resistance starts now!
FUCK YOU, I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME!
Trump yards get upset so easily like little  babies
Any way to download this?
This turned Em's trash ass cypher into hot fire. I disagree with what he said but I more disagree with people shouting it was great just because he shit talked Trump. Awesome job.
This makes me wanna hear an actual Eminem and RATM collab album
In the words of the great macho man... ooooooohh yeaaaahhhh
People won't like you for this, I'm sure. Fuck them, this is great on every level.
This is amazing
Dj cummerbund can make shit a million times better than it exists, what are you doing?
If only I had more likes to give. You’re absolutely killing it man. Great backing track for this powerful poetry.
73 people can fuck thenselves along with drumph
Perfect ! Great job!
Bla bla bla
great mix
This is amazing
This sounds fucking great
LOVE IT! 🤘
f* dope!
damn great job!!!
Shit mash up
epic!
Fantastic
fuckin amazing sync dammmmm
randy savage clap clap clap clap clap
On repeat! ❤️🤘
Man, this shit is FIIIRE
WOW!!
Don't agree with Eminem's bullshit, but this mashup is awesome!
BRILLIANT
just awesome! i love RatM
Yes dj cumberbund you da fire dj boiiii
Democrats can get it too!
My favorite part is that you all have offered such compelling arguments... i may have changed my mind.    \n\n\n\nNope, youre all still fucking morons for liking emeinem and the inability to articulate a real counter argument or stance.
Wow this is one of the best mashup songs I have ever heard!
I'm all for anti trump slogans, but fuck Eminem. Stop ruining one of my favourite bands for me. Fuck this made my ears bleed. Fucking awful shit!
I LOVE ❤️ this so much!! Once again thank you!! Incredible job. EMINEM AND RAGE ARE THE BOMB! SAYING DONALD THE BITCH FEELS SO GOOD I AM ADDICTED!! This trending why ARENT there more views maybe the RUSSIANS ARE HACKING THIS! THEY ARE TRYING TO STOP THE MOVEMENT WITH  45!! Just a guy feeling.
Great job on mixing these, it's perfect !!!
gay like eminem
Fuck Eminem and whoever made this garbage.
This is mix   eminem and rage agains the machine
What is that at the end? Randy Savage rapping? XD
Eminem’s freestyle was terrible.  But you did a good job making it sound good.  Angsty, pseudo-intellectual, leftist rapping goes well with a RATM backing track.
Making a difference, one Oh yeah! at a time
Eminem is still angry Hillary didn't win. Thank god.
Nope, still cringe. I thought you might have succeeded in making this cool, but I don’t think that is possible.
You realize he was saying hate trump not hey trump?
Wow you never see any anti trump stuff these days....How original and edgy yawn zzzzzzzz
Great band with shitty rapper + shitty rapper with no band = Meh.  Never mind.  It still sucks.
Eminem really fucking sucks shitty rapper now he's going to follow everybody else because he's a sheep and plus he has no more rap rap music to make so he's got to make fun of trump like everybody else in the world cuz he's a sheep he's a a follower if I was Trump I would just leave  and leave other countries  destroy this country like North Korea. What why should I help the people of this country everybody hates them everybody disrespects their president and they don't know shit about him because half of the country is brainwashed.

My anxiety came back while watching this video.
You should make a video of your brain lean
I hate when people try to discredit my anxiety by saying, “It’s normal! I get super anxious all the time too!” 😐
Talk about how society started using the word triggered all of a sudden...
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
I have severe social anxiety and I can't take it anymore this is too painful I just want to be normal
Sir please make a video on intermittent fasting and its effects on hormones such as testosterone and growth hormone and such for bodybuilding as i have seen many people claim that testosterone levels boost on intermittent fasting. Thank You in advance

i live with panic disorder. much like the chipotle kid...  Omg Anxiety is my life. lol
i felt like crap these couple of days back. Now i feel better. I stopped smoking I think this is from childhood.
I think my anxiety stems from never feeling like I've done good enough so I think about ways I messed up. And if something does go my way I feel like I just injected heroine and I'm a rock star. And then I crash again
Next episode should be titled: “Your brain on child Pornography”

Meditate every day. Meditate. After 30 years of trying everything...

Why do we have appetite? And why are we slaves to our appetite?

the hottest fashion trend of 2017
I am so anxious  not to say something wrong in class because it will make everybody laugh... I am the only child in my class to be anxious with all the test and even daily lessons because I feel like I will not have study enough and in this way I would dissapoint my teachers... Once I got a 17 out of 20 in a test and I did not want to go to school for one week because I felt useless and that if somebody sees me, I thought they will laugh at me...
i make A S M R  relaxation videos to help people with anxiety.. hugs hugs to all that have anxiety problems.. I have it badly too   :(

This is so strange. WTF is going on with people that so many people are getting anxiety in recent years. Jesus. Is this what happens when we interrupt Darwinism?
Anxiety is my life.\nAlmost everything stresses me out and I don't know how to stop it
Maybe because assholes with power and money constantly have to make life difficult for the rest of us.
Life is hard when even your anxiety has anxiety.
What if I'm just not hungry? Is it bad for me?  I'll only eat dinner, once a day. I'm just not hungry throughout the day.
Yay what a great thing to tell someone with anxiety. You’re likely to get heart disease. ☹️ But the rest was helpful. So thanks.

I’m 18 and my boyfriend was just in a terrible car accident killing his best friend and leaving himself in a coma. I was wondering if you guys could do a video on traumatic brain injuries? More specifically diffuse axonal brain injuries please.
Hey I'm new here so I'm not sure if you've done a video on this but I think it would be really cool if ya'll could do a video on how experiences in childhood affect your life and relationships later on.
I developed anxiety attacks over a long period of time that came to a head many years ago when I had one of several panic attacks.  After dealing with this for over a decade, a new thing happened: agoraphobia.  I now don't leave my apartment unless I absolutely have to.  I no longer grocery shop nor do even go for a casual walk as each of these cause anxiety and panic - and for no known reason at all.  I take an SSRI daily but that doesn't do much except even out my moods so I no longer feel particularly happy or overly sad about anything as a result.  The worst part about this: I'm not alone.  There are so many others in the same situation as I am where our quality of life has been dramatically compromised.  I've lost most of my friends (since I can't visit them nor can I go out with them anymore for fun).  I certainly haven't met anyone that I could share my life with (how could I).  I buy most of my food at a convenience store because it's close by and I can quickly go there, grab something and come home again.  This is my life, or more accurately, my existence.  Anyone that thinks those of us that suffer with this _want_ to be like this are the ones that need to have their head examined.  Often, we are told that we need to pull our socks up, man-up, get over it, etc., or are asked things like What are you afraid of? Do you think people are watching and whispering? What is your problem? and don't understand when they get answers like I don't know what there is to fear: nothing, as far as I know.  This just happens.  No I don't think people are staring and whispering; I'm not paranoid or suffering delusions.  If I knew what my problem was do you not think I'd have addressed it already head on?  Then they wonder why we get upset and don't want to be around them.  To make this problem even worse, none of us experience this the same way.  One person's experience with anxiety and panic could be radically different from my own.  Sadly, we're all treated the same way.  Broken.
i figured i was going to comment along the lines of what a load of bollocks!\nbeing somebody who suffers anxiety for a host of reasons, along with depression, i get a bit sick of the whole change your diet, think positive! type of crap that appears on the net. \nyou didnt do that. \nthankyou!

WENGER IN
fuck this guy
Lol Donkey! Please stay at Arsenal forever. Laughing stock of the league.
Xhaka was terrible playing out of position ..giving ball away ..why not play wilshere  instead ? Arsene clearly lost it ..
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WENGER-IN
Welbeck just back from injury ..why play him instead of Giroud ?
First... fuck Wenger
Scandalous decision! Bit like offering you another 2 years then Mr Wenger!
Full of shit. Whining about decisions ... did he see the pen West Brom were denied in the last game? That was what u call a scandalous decision. \n\nArsenal bottled it, deeney came on and it was almost constant Watford bombardment... they hit the post n had other chances too. Deserved win in the end for Watford
Jesus christ just go, every decison you make is a WTFFFFFARE YOUDOING!@#@@#@ decision.
Wenger in
Look aaahhh
Not a penalty terrible decision!!
hmm scandalous decision? We did score twice... and they didn't. Silly Mr Wenger your team is slapdash at best.
Europa League club. Facts. \n\nFeel bad for Wenger. \n\nWas it raining? Ty definitely gonna muster something banterful at another Watford defeat.
All said at exactly 0:10...
i cant listen to him anymore
This man face is horror film scene, worse than hell fire.. fuck off here
Wenger in! Fuck your you modern day football fabs
Hahahahahahah

*Specialist in failure.*
Wenger Out !!!!!
Spineless...coward
FRAUD
piss off
Ok I'm going to say it as a female....Anna's boobs look great. As well as her hair.
You look absolutely amazing!!  😍💋❤
LOOOVE your hair. The colour and style is length looks amazing. I think we need a new how to curl your hair tutorial 😁
Hey! Great video :) what brand t shirt are you wearing? You always have the loveliest v necks and I need one!
You look a lot like Jennifer Lopez in this video xx
love you so much!! how about an updated grocery haul?
The Rumors that Anna had plastic surgery is bullsh**.  \n\nPeople will do anything to tear down Anna and Jonathan.  Anna is a natural beauty but people can’t believe it.  \n\nThe fact that the Sacconejoly are so drop dead gorgeous family intimidates people.   \n\nPeople need to look deep down inside them-self to wonder what is wrong with them.
okay
Glad your back, you are a great inspiration
You are so gorgeous Anna, I love to see your vlog🤗😘
I have missed these so much!\nYour answer for the messy home I literally re-watched twice...I have three young children & completely relate to that. THANK YOU so much for that.
Great video. Loved it
So glad you've found yourself again. Be comfortable in your own skin Anna because you truly are an inspiration to others. Keep up the brilliant work as a human and a mother x
who is this beauty trending on Youtube???Who is this milk of magnesia? What does she want with me?
I just want to thank you and Jonathan for choosing to document so much of your lives with us. I cannot express the love and joy you bring to me and all your fans every single day. You are just so raw and real it's refreshing. I hope more people become like you, don't listen to haters there just the scum of the earth. Little low lifes who want nothing more than to be where you are xx
Anna your eye makeup looks so nice xxxx
Please do a video on how you're not going to do videos any more. That would be great.
You are so pretty and I wish I could meet you and the others ❤
Who is the youngest viewer
How cool would it be if Jonathan would let the camera film Emilia and Edouardo interacting with Alessia when they know you're not watching them.\nLove u guys<3
Omg you want a 4th baby?? 😍❤️
really love your hair here!
Let me be your 400th dislike...
I totally agree with not worrying so much about having the house neat and spotless and worry about spending time with my daughters.
Did she say: she has 3 and wants another.😭\n👧👴👶👶
You really looks stunning, looks so happy and amazing! 😍 I have never thought about this before but you look like Jennifer Lopez, love love love your hairstyle and the color 😍 keep up the good work Anna! ☺️💕 love from Sweden
😂😂 omg your response to plastic surgery, “we daily vlog” like hello people, she couldn’t hide facial surgery if she’s vlogging everyday. Haha! You look beautiful, so proud of you being so real and honest
What's this channel all about?? Kids?? 🤔😁
Your long hair makes you look so much younger omg !!!!
Going to show this video to my hairdresser cause I need this hair color!!! Its beautiful!
Who cares
Crazy to think Anna is only 3 years older than me and she’s got her whole life sorted out. I don’t even have a boyfriend/husband 😭😂
Are this the person True geordie is talkin about
Annnaaaa! So nice to have an update. Ignore the silliness of people talking about you having had 'work'. They are just in disbelief that you are such a beautiful woman. Keep on doing you. Watching you guys from here in Uganda. Have a lovely week xoxoxo
I love you so much Anna, you are incredible 💗so beautiful 💕✨🌸☁️💗xoxo
Your whole bit about how you deal w keeping a tidy home made me cry 😢 thank you! That is such a good way to look at/deal with it 💞💞💞💞 xoxo
A lovely video Anna I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):)
Hello Anna! Have you ever heard the name Audra? We chose that name for our first girl and just love it. Thought of you when you were talking about A names. Plus you can really use a tongue roll with it. Haha.
Wow u look so much like j lo there
U look beautiful
Wait, Anna's only 29?!  Huh!
I'm half Italian and my siblings and I all have French names! So does my mum!
You start to look like JLO 😊
Your eye makeup is stunning !😍x
I love the name Alessia :)
Rumours?! Clearly I’ve been blind to everything...
Francesca is my middle name. Also a family name. ❤️
Does anyone know the song at the end?
Do you walk all the dogs at the same time? Id like to see that in a vlog :D
I love your hair in this video! You look stunning xx
U have a brother? Never saw him
I think people think you have had plastic surgery because you look so different from when you guys first started vlogging. Your makeup is drastically different, the dark eye color and orange hair made you look older. People change, you can change your makeup and hair color and look completly different.
can anyone tell me how to open up description/info box on desktop with the new YT interface? :(
Aw Anna! You're such a lovely lady! I love watching your videos!!
I love that your doing 3 videos a week. Missed you Anna
Are you going to show your Fall/ Halloween decorations? I always like to see these.
Anna you are a RAY OF LIGHT! <3
Anna, you’re so beautiful, I’ve been following you for 5yrs now and you get better with age x
Anna and I are literally the same person 😊♥️
Anna, you are just gorgeous, and so sweet and real--so happy for you and your sweet family!!  💕 Lisa
Anna, thanks for sharing your Q&A! I always enjoy your chats. The story about Emilia and Eduardo was so funny. 😃 Never a dull moment with kids! BTW, you look so beautiful, and I love your hair! 💖💖
She has a bit of a irish accent am i right??
Hi Anna, thanks for sharing a little tidbit of yourself. I wonder what Emelia & Eduardo’s newest adventure code will be..lol.. Just wait till they get Alessia involved when she grows up..lolI don’t have Snapchat or Instagram so thanks for sharing this vlog. You&your family are lovely. Take care & see ya : )
Girl, you look so gorgeous! Like a greek goddess! Is it creepy if I say your curves look fabulous?
Seeing her childern with that pout I believe she has not done any lip job 😘😍
You have Grown into Such a Wonderful Lady.. So many Changes Anna, in you Attitude and Really matured beautifully.,💖💖
Could you PLEASE share some insights on having a family in the spotlight, like especially because you are mainly social media based. How do you protect them? Do you get threats? Could you be real about your struggles? For all the moms thinking about blogging but torn about how much exposure to give their children? Any advise?
You look stunning Anna 😀
Love this video <3
Would love you to do a skin care and/or hair care routine video!!
I’m i the only one who thinks she looks like Jennifer Lopez?
I think people forget that Anna is still only 29 and also is natural beautiful. Not every body needs or wants Botox!
Literally made me feel 100 times better today. I have two kids one is a month old and the other 3 and she has the worse cold. No washing done and no cleaning I feel so guilty but seeing this made me feel so much better
You're so sweet, Anna :-)
Love this video so much😍😍Well done Anna😘😘
Hi Anna so glad u came back and you don't have to explain yourself to us and love u see u guys in Glasgow
👍So happy your back Anna😗
When you're so pretty they think you've had plastic surgery.
That earring story was SO funny! My girls were 3 years apart and they used to scheme. But more often, my littler one would prank or mess with my older one.
You look so pretty Anna! I do think you look younger but I think it's from the kids being around you have so much more energy!
Anna your hair looks incredible😍
YAY
Tits
Oh pls stfup 😴
Halloween 🎃 House Tour?😍
U look beautiful
Great video x
love your video anna
You are stunning
Rock On !!!!!!!
The earrings trap story was the funniest!! 😂 looking gorgeous Anna 💕
You're so stunning Anna!
So gorgeous Anna😘X
Looking at the bottom half of the video
I think it is a bit unfair how all their names are to do with Anna's side of the family but not Jonathan's
Alessia sounds like a name my 4 year old would make up during playtime.
How do u afford 3 kids while UK is so expensive and you want a fourth one hehehehehehe
No cos you said we only film a few bits a day. Your cheeks are huge . Liar
Had no idea Anna had a brother?!
Funny how when you talk about plastic surgery you say you didn't get your lips filled or Botox but you don't talk about the things you DID get done because that would be outright lying.  Anyone who used to know you (wink wink) knows you got your nose and your boobs done.
You should do The Babysitter (Netflix Original, 2017)

Do everything wrong with the babysitter
To the question  of whether or not Jason is a ghost,  he's  a revenant, an undead that comes back for revenge. They comeback stronger, faster and just as smart as they were when they were alive. They also use weapons.
The opening scene is supposed to take place two months after the events of the first movie and then fast forward 5 years for the main part of the movie.
How come you did a vid on this 1 day before Friday the 3th
Evrything Wrong With Friday the 13th Part 3 coming in Oct 2020 ?
Wait a minute, I sense pee behind me! \nYes hello I'd like to organize a funeral, because I'm fucking dead.
God dammit one day early are you kidding me.
That was a good movie! And that one girl in particular had a great ass! :)
Zero black people in this film. Wow. It sure was a different time back then!
Every thing with IT
I am struggling through part 3 of this series... are you going to do part 3 soon?!? Its painful.
By the way if you ever do the third one could you please bring up the news reports\nIf you listen closely to one of the news reports Jason apparently engaged in cannibalism and sexual mutilation \nI don't remember anything like that occurring in part 2 but then again we never did find out what happened to Paul so\nHOLY GINGERFUCK JESUS!
I would pay GOOD MONEY for Jeremy to  do the entire dance scene of this film with 50 Cent as the soundtrack!
Everything wrong with Jason takes Manhattan

Shouldn’t this have been published on the 13th if the movies about Friday the 13th
Funny because I watched this yesterday. Before watching this.
Where is EWW Death Note? Seriously, that would compensate the time I wasted watching this shitty excuse of a movie.
You should make a video on The corps bride. (Yes,ANOTHER Tim Burton movie)
Do Freddy vs Jason and also Wonder Woman!! Please!
Can you do Reign of Fire? As a kid I thought it was good, but now I see many fails.
Everything wrong with Baby Driver even though it's flawless.
Do a Everything wrong with Rambo  1, 2, 3 and 4
Can you do Everything Wrong With Mulan, Mulan 2
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH IT, PLEASE!!!
Do everything wrong with Cars 3
Hey Jeremy please watch this movie called The Possession of Michael King
This movie is shit
What do you think would happen if you somehow got Jason to respect you? Like, he knows you’re a force to be reckoned with and cannot be killed easily.
How to do a video that you call everything my mother did wrong by not having an abortion in 45 years or less and then make it about your pathetic lights?
9:31 he seems be speaking Nipple Morse Code but I don't know it XD
When will you do a video about it, if you were ever planning to.
*_EVERYTHING WRONG WITH HAPPY DEATH DAY!!!!_*
Do It\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to see you do like a hundred roll credits every time they say the word it
14:01 the narrator says Jason slams his pitchfork into the MIDDLE of the car roof, a location where no driver has ever sat in the history of cars.  I'm giving this video a sin for the narrator having never heard of the Mclaren F1, which definitely has the driver's seat in the middle of the car, with a passenger seat on either side.  The car in the movie is obviously no Mclaren F1, but still the whole in the history of cars part is bullshit.
I love that you used a clip from Club Dread at the end there. Haha!
Please do Wonder Woman. Even though its an amazing movie
Can you please do 'Everything wrong with Clowntergeist'? \nOh! And your videos are hella awesome, btw! Love every single one of them!
Everything Wrong With Meet The Robinsons
I think the biggest sin is the fact you uploaded this the day before Friday the 13th.
This was made on my b day
I will be great at Cinemasins after watching so many of your videos, now every time i watch a movie i keep searching for sins and with few minutes ding  .
All movie Friday the 13th
I know I say this every time, but I think this might be my fave Sins ep ever! LOL
Wtf I was wondering why I stopped getting your videos recommended turns out I was unsubscribed. The heck YouTube

Thank you so much to Quidd for sponsoring us! Go get some Ryland, Drew, and Shane STICKERS here!!!!!! it's free!! http://bit.ly/2xs3Evj
OK that mirror selfie .. I was looking at Ryland and he was really feeling himself. Like QUEEN ! WORK THAT . WHERE IS THE SHOOT?!
What’s the girls @ ???!!! She was so nice,the girl that ate a bite of the pizza with them??!
Yes I'm a troll, but if Drews turtle is a slider turtle shouldn't there be somewhere it can sunbathe and relax instead of constantly swim around. I'm not sorry, I love Shane and y'all but animals are nicer.
C'mon, Guys!! Get Shane a brand deal!! \nI'd LOVE to watch him try bougie food!
can you start vlogging please? do it bitch
I was exoeectting it to be bigger
Drew saying I DONT, YOU DO made me fucking cry laughing
AWW that man was so nice and he knew you guys!!!!
You should make a pizza box (made out of pizza~) and put real pizza inside it..But don't make the pizza inside it you want to eat not throw up.
why does the thumbnail look like a buzzfeed video lol😁
Why the fuck is pizza so small!!!!!!
That's f ing good that's f ing good that's. F ing good
It smells like an expensive pussy...\nI think I like it!\n😂😂😂😂😂😂
Like someone wrinkled it for a wrinkle movie. LMFAO
Wow give the waiter some of your 1000 dollar pizza yeah keep talking that its so expensive lol
Do a conspiracy video I haven't seen one in a while
Shane my dood. I love u. No homo. Please, please shave. Do it for your fans. We hate it.
this video is so fucking funny
You look like a fat pedophile with aids.
I’m honestly loving ryland , he is soo FIT FOR THIS!
I love rich people who have to deal with Shane
“Okay, you’re back! Okay we saved you a piece. Can’t me sit down!” I love Shane so much
I watched all the ads cause he's gunna need  the money fter this LMAOOO
“I must’ve pushed the wrinkle button on my washer”
“I’ll still eat it” BITCH ME
im a new sub and i think your funny
who's watching Pizza while watching dis ? 😂😂🍕🍕
for a 1000 quid I thought it was gonna be the size of the table lol, that aint gonna fill up 3 men :O
Why is vine on the description
shane has that fancy laugh you’d hear in that restaurant
I’m commenting so you get more money because damn 1000 dollars for a pizza I think $5 is to expensive
Buzzfeed who?
1:04 did he just say...\n\ncheesus christ\n\nCHEESUS CHRIST\n\n*CHEESUS CHRIST*
0:01 my new screensaver.
I liked 2:18 and 2:23
It looks like $100 pizza
How much?
That pizza looks worse than something hungry Howies makes...
That pizza looks like shit
The Dawson delight
Isnt kyla leon harleys ex
Jesus! How much money
What if that pizza is the way you initiate into the illuminati
Drew should literally open up a pizza shop called “pizza drews.”
I'm in love with that waitress oml
in the start when shane went And the resaon is FOOODDDD I was so psyched coz he was singing HOOBASTANK
I wanted to get quid\nSupport Shane but it's not working on my phone
Buzzfeed is fucking *QUAKING*
who in the beginning was tryna look and see if shane has cavities and fillings?\n\nno..just me..well fuck it idc lol
From eating Taco Bell in his kitchen to this fancy shmancy stuff
Is it just me, or is Shane one of the funniest people EVER?!
Also that valet guy was super sweet
Shane and drew literally have my laughing so hard every second
Can the waitress make a YouTube channel? I really want to follow that girl 😂😂
Shane there is this guy that is uploading on your channel and he is wtf news
But one of them eats three pieces every time literally me. XD
Well now u know it's fking good
Shane to Ryland while he's eating the tuna tartare: You should try real p**sy\nRyland: (staring irritated like) 😂
hold the fuck up. If i pay $1000 for a pizza i want a pizza that covers the whole fucking table lol not that little shit hahahaha
Tried the app, it doesn't work.
I actually love Drew's apartment. I like the booth seats and neon lights and Coca-Cola signs. My aesthetic. He must secretly be a grandma in a young dude's body. Like me. Except I'm a grandma in a 20 year old woman's body that looks 12...
i just got a quidd notation while you were talking about it
this might be the most extra video i have watched he literally took shane to a gallery to get a picture of the pizza
The reason is food\nMe whenever my teacher asks me to explain why I wrote bacon as an answer on my test.
Please do more of these videos! ❤️
omg drew always looks like he just killed someone XD
Lol”that’s fucking good that’s fucking good that’s fucking good”😂
I thought it was going to be as big as the table... they come out with a tiny paper plate lmaoooooo
I think it's funny that people keep saying they expected it to be bigger. The things that are on it such as the truffles & the lobster, are what make it expensive. Filet mignon is an expensive piece of meat & it's the size of a fist.
The love this trio
Shane I am very upset with u.........were are your foood videos this has been your first food video in forever but like I need more 😩😩
That looked disgusting. I think the chef threw up on a pizza and charged you $1000.00
and the reason is FOOOOOOODD
It literally cracks me up that Shane thinks he’s not a celebrity 😂😂😂 he genuinely gets shook when people know him
Every single one of Shane's Me when... makes me laugh so much. He's hilarious
meeeeen, you should come to Italy and I ll take you to eat the real pizza every dayyy
wow garrets really changed since the last video with the boys
The fact that they left the waitress a slice and a spot makes me so happy with how humble shane is. He deserves everything he has ❤
Shane Dawson, I downloaded that app Quidd  just so I could have your emojis, but I can't find you on there.. Help!!!???!?!?!
Shane stop stealing Buzzfeed's ideas. They don't have that many left.
Thats funny, in Brazil we, almost always, only eat pizza with fork and knife and we're not at all a formal society, but for americans that's elevated hahahahahhaahaha
👏 e l e v a t e d 👏
5:33 and that’s when Shane knew, he done right
some gay I don't know me
Can we just agree that Drew is precious?
Those vlogging angles and the way Shane sometimes said his words gave me Miranda Sings vibes!
Can you guys take over worth it? It would be so much more fun than the two guys who do it now
You’re gay, we get it...
didn't they try pizza on the podcast?
Pause at 13:21 it looks like someone is slapping shane
What an annoying cunt. 16 minuets of bullshit. Thanks fuck in only 60 seconds in. And I'm out.
OMG. The staff at this restaurant are everything!
The workers there were great! None of that stuffy waitstaff at fancy restaurants stereotype here!
that pizza tho
Shane check out crazy kittens by Jada
That looks disgusting 😂
im woke
Anyone recognize the angry grandpa song??😂
0:41 ... once?
Damn I just realized how I've completely fallen off interest in this girl like HARD! She used to be my queen but I just like every empire everything does come to an end... obviously people are still showing some love but nothing new here... I'm ready for Carli to get off YouTube and maybe be on tv instead... THAT I'd be interested in
everybody complaining about the line are the ones who can’t pull the pieces off...oops 🙊
You know someones rich when they think wearing something seven times in the past two months is a lot
what is missguided’s sizing like? I’m usually a 0 or 24 for pants but I looked at their size chart and the measurements seemed a little small.
Very unoriginal..seen most of these styles on Kim K.. you slowly trying to morph into her!
30” Extensions very in right now
Hi Carli! What size you wear on that gold metallic bandeau dress?
What camera do you use ??
Why are people commenting on her weight? People saying she looks better now that she's gained some weight my gosh that's the same thing as telling someone that they look better now that they've lost weight. Idk. People come in different sizes, shapes, colors etc etc..why do these things always have to get pointed out? There's hardly no acceptance anymore. This world is doomed :\
Bummed out you didn't try the outfits on... I was looking forward to it
I wish this collection would be more classic and chic.. 😔
Carli!! Where are the boots from that you are wearing with the sporty blue dress?
This is very specific but the silver top looks exactly like the one Jenny from Forest Gump wore when she’s about to commit suicide...
Ok butt are you and Bret not\nTogether anymore?????
Where’s Brett? We haven’t seen him in your social media
Anyone else notice she got a Brazilian Buttlift ..lol but yet in all her videos lately she says she's been really busy and doesn't have time to film but has time to have BBL surgery.. Weird
Omg this whole collection.. wowww
YOU LOOK AMAZINGGGG!!!
I couldn't even finish the damn video it was lagging my man
November 13! that's my 20th birthday! 😭😭😭💓💓💓💓
I honestly love all of these pieces but I'm sad to say that most of those don't come in my size. Your collection will do great but it would also do really well with plus sizes. I'd like to see more plus size options! Still, congrats on your new collab with missguided!! 💗  Loved every single item in this collection ❤️
Definitely gonna take this oversize jumper dress with the over the TOP shoes and corset, I’m obsessed 🔥🔥
I'm EXCITED FOR THE NEXT COLLECTION!!! I see a lot of things that I LOVE!!!!!!
Hi, congrats on your billboard Carli. The silk boots are beautiful and will probably purchase them but is the heel have silk, or is it more like a usual heel. Thanks carli I live in Northern Ireland and was wondering if you  are a 8 or 10 uk size what would that be American size
Are you and Brett still together?
In your next collection video, could you cut to clips of you wearing them? It really helps to see things on in motion 😊
so cute!  Can't wait for your holiday drop 2.
Who is this disturbing plastic faced woman ?
I love how these pieces are toned done colors
I wish she would try them on or post pictures...
Hey why I’m not seeing her boyfriend with her did they broke up :o
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME, ARE HER AND BRETT TOGETHER? some guy was grinding on her in her snap chat
Looks like Carli and Brett are no longer together. He's no where in her new videos,snaps, or big events
Hi Carli are you and Brett still together? Just noticed that both of you never post or mention each other anymore😐🙈x
Am I the only nosy one that’s wondering if her and Brett are still together?🤔🤷‍♀️😢
Everything kim Kardashian inspired so it’s not you’re style hun ,I think they are expensive for being misguided because the material it’s always the same kinda cheap material so should’ve been less expensive! Don’t get me wrong I love every piece but none it’s original !
She's so cute! Love her! Can't wait to buy these pieces ❤️
Amazing. Beautiful colors and fabrics. Everything may not be for me, but at least half  of everything is. Also, you get what you pay for with F21. While I love that store, you need to really take care of the clothes you buy there if you want them to last. I feel like these would last a tad bit longer. Much support and good vibes!
Can't wait to get my hands on some items! Who wants to be friends guys?!?!?
Congrats on the collection!! Pretty pieces! I am eyeing the sweaters and sweatpants!!
Carli, I'm so disappointed ☹ most of this stuff are items I can find at Forever 21. I was so looking forward to it but I'm not crazy about anything, especially the slouchy looks that I can't get in Downtown LA for $5. Nothing like all the good quality product you had for Spring. I'll probably buy 1 item. All the rest I hated 😭
All this stuff looks like Kim K knockoffs. It literally looks like everything on every instagram boutique. The rhinestone two piece she wore on the billboard was cute.
It's so amazing to see how much your brand/channel Has grown! I'm so excited for you beautiful 💖💖💖
This collection is so EXTRA and so me! I'm obssessed. Too bad I'm poor. And can't get any of it.
Confused. Are the prices online different from the prices in store or something? Bc Misguidedus.com didn't get this price memo lol. As I was going through this video I got excited bc the prices she says are pretty reasonable but the majority of these are so off. Like they're way more expensive online then what she says here sooooooo????
Love the shoes towards the end.
CONGRAGULATIONS!\n\nThe collection is stunning x
Your collection is so you😭😍😍. It’s gorgeous!! Once I get enough coins I will definitely invest in your collection! Good job babes!! 😇🎊❤️
I am so in love with your line Carli😍😍 Trying to purchase my items now hun but the prices are higher when in the cart. @carlibybel
Hi Carli, \nI loved your collection and was looking forward to purchasing couple items but the price point doesnt match when towards the end of the purchase. \nI am very interested in purchasing the Gold & Silver Rhinestone halter as priced for $45, but towards the end of the purchase it updates to $57. I have spoken with one of the customer representative and she says that she will not be able to price match and I was wondering if this was a glitch or was your price point mistaken. \nThank You <3 \n\nP.S. Anyone purchasing this item having similar problems?
I love every piece but the prices are ridiculous😑
What size are you wearing in the sweater dress?
Carli, everything in this collection is BOMB. my grandma was watching as well and said I wish I was young so I could wear beautiful clothes like that!  😂 You are only young once so now is the time to wear fun clothes like this! I can't afford this but my heart is bursting for you I'm so proud of you! A beautiful mix of casual and fun holiday stuff. Sending love from Vancouver BC XOXO
its her birthday today
I bought the navy two piece, I’m so excited for it to get here!!!!!
I want that Velvet dress so bad but I wish it could come in at least 2 more sizes up I'm way more comfortable buying things that are slightly baggy and not completely fitted and plus the size conversions to Australian gets me a bit worried...
Too expensive. I think the previous collection was better. The majority doesn’t look like fall to me. I like some of the pieces but the only pieces I can afford to buy and can wear are the joggers and the navy leggings which I’m not that crazy about. A lot are two pieces which are cute, but I’ll never wear the top. I know you can buy the top and bottom separately but I would’ve liked the option of a matching jacket or longer top that doesn’t show my stomach. I definitely like the mini pink and green dress from last collection better because I liked the high neck these look plain to me. I think my favorite pieces are the jeans jacket and the shoes but can’t afford to spend almost $100 on 1 item. Pretty sad I probably won’t be getting anything. Sorry Carli, love you!! Not trying to bash on you, just being honest on why I’m not fan of the collection so far. I’m definitely waiting to see the rest of the collection. Again this is just my opinion, everyone else seems to love it otherwise:)
Happy bday!!! Have a good day!
Well...the hats would fit me! 😁 It's a beautiful collection Carli, congrats! I have your eyeshadow palette and love it!
Please do a video on how you conceal your boobs! Especially will all those bandeaus
Happy birthday, writing this on Tuesday October 17 lol
Someone hit up @AmberScholl for the cheap dupe DIYs 😅👌
When you’re too big to buy anything. 🙃💔
I just dropped so much money on this line 😅
Why are like half of the pieces not on the site!????? :((((((
I definitely need that denim jacket! It sold out before I could get my hands on it.
Wow your prices went up real fast !!!\nWay to make money !!!\nPrices started today one thing and went up yo another !\nDisappointed with missguided scaming us
Hi Carli! I love you and I'm so excited for your clothing line! I went on today to buy the plum joggers, and the price is jumping from $35 to $48 when I add them to the cart. I'm not sure what is going on. Has anyone else had this problem?
She used to be so beautiful and natural. Now she looks like a bad Kardashian copycat. How sad you american ladies are looking up at those Kardashians as a role models.
This clothing line motivates me to shed my post baby weight. I just gave birth to triplets so I went from a size 2 pre pregnancy to a size 14/16 post baby. Will be purchasing a few things once I’m satisfied with the weight loss
Thank you for making some of them in bigger sizes. Especially the mauve cargo trousers omg
you look amazing! love the collection 💕
They definitely look better on Carli and on the hanger than on the model they chose on Missguided’s website. I am more shaped like that model wearing her clothes on the site and I didn’t love the items as much based on how they looked on her so I didn’t get all the items I planned on buying because of that. Since there wasn’t a try on in this video by anyone slimmer. Got a good amount tho. For next months collection Carli, maybe you can have your friends with different size ranges try on your holiday collection? Gives a better perspective on video than still photo 🙃☺️🐧 Love youuu ❣️
It's odd that I chose today to actually take the time to sit down and watch this video because I was notified the moment you uploaded the video but I knew it was a long one and I haven't had the time to fit watching it in my schedule until now. Which is the day of your birthday  and the day of the launch ! So Happy Birthday My Luv , congrats and I will by buying SO MANY items. I cant wait to order like everything ! xoxo
It’s all so pretty but I have a gut I can’t wear none of this lmao
CONGRATULATIONS CARLI!!!!!!!!! You look so pretty 😘 and your clothing line is absolutely to die for!! So proud of you!! “You go glen coco”lol 👏🏼👏🏼💕 \n\nOmg and the very first piece you showed I AM GETTING!! it totally reminds me of the 90s club scene I’m in loveeeeeeee 😻😻😻😻
I love love love my Carli but I live in super cold hardcore snow washington & I can't wear any of these pieces rn unless I layer a huge jacket on them but then you can't see the clothing piece :((
I love all the pieces, my favorite would have to be that denim jacket! My birthday is on your second release date 😄
Those pants are not silk but sateen. Sateen is cheaper version and it belong to polyester family , while silk is top grade quality material which i doubted would be part of that collection. Biggest miss for me is materials, theres nothing made of beautiful breathable fabrics such as cotton, pure silk, linen..
Your hair looks so beautiful! Can we get a hair care video and how you take care of such long hair!
The quality looks great! Can't wait 😬
When are the booties dropping??
Hi Cairl! In the second launch will you have the navy stripe slinky bralette back? In a size 0?! It was sold out by the time I went on at 9am 😔 love you! 💕
Can we talk about her last snap ??? Where is her bf
didnt see the corset belts?????
Happy birthday Carli
HAPPY BIRTHDAY lol
THAT JUMPSUIT THOUGH!
♥️ all pieces
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Stunning 😍❤️❤️❤️
Carliiiii you make our girls hearts melted❤️😍😍
Happy birthday carli! 🖤
https://youtu.be/-SYmebFEhzQ
😍😍
Maybe carli bybel and khloe kardashian were switched at birth
You truly deserve this
Congratulations
so excited

hey, the Simpsons were still very very very very very very awesome after season 6. They died in season 20
The commentary in the credits was great. The review sets it up and me and 5 of my friends agree...It is what it is.
I loved the banter between the Pennywise's and Critic. It's the best review. I laugh everytime I watch it.
I couldn't get over logically no kid would interact with billwise over curry. Losing all credence
Ok what actually happens with the whole Beverly thing in the book the impression i get is that IT is disturbing but thats all I can find About IT can someone please fill me in?
In regards to that leper scene, fuck that! That thing was disgusting! When I heard that scene wasn't what it cracked up to be, I thought it wouldn't be that bad. I looked it up later only to see I have to take your opinions on disgust with a grain of salt next time. Geez.
georgie:Nope\nSkatsgard:yeah but they where drawn\n to him and he's not even scary\nCurry:Exactly you dumbass\nI am in tears LOL
Token Girl: Well what did they do in the book- Oh no, uh uh, not comfortable with that.\n\nFor those who don't get it..........well it's in the comments, go further down. Or Up, whatever.\n\nPoint is it's some fucked up shit.\n\n\n\n..........Also wait, did this movie end halfway through the story?
AAAAaaaaa it's a reference to the Batman episode!!
Loved the almost got em joke
I love the Abbot and Costello sketch at the end.
Actually, the whole 'we never saw anyone float in your version' is NOT true, guys...you DID see a member of the bad kid's gang get taken away into the dead lights...and he FLOATED into the pipe before being broken in half and sucked in...;)
the old who joke, a classic xD
I swear, I literally don't think I've laughed so much at a Nostalgia Critic episode in *years.* Fantastic job. Also, holy shit, that Mark Hammil Joker impression at the end. I'm floored.
I thought he was supposed to be funny in the remake.
you're scraping the bottom of the fucking barrel Doug
A reenactment of one of the best episodes of one of the best shows of all time to show off criticisms in an interesting way Doug and Rob are really growing as artists and I can't wait to see where they go
Easily the best and funniest review in a long, long time. Watched it twice. Probably will watch it again.
Doug's reviews with the remakes are the best movie reviews of youtube!
Why did Beberly fucked everybody again? Or was it just Stephen king just getting off to his imagination?
I'm all about artistic expression but maybe the whole firing a machine gun into a crowd of innocent people might be in bad taste right now?
23:00 Kinda hoping Jacksfilms would come in and shout big boy.
1:17 seconds in and all I can say is...DISISGONNABEGOOD!
I loved it. IT had it's flaws like the kids being stupid for no reason. Or tripping constantly when running away.
22:30 I really hope that was a joke on purpose. The Blu-Ray director's cut will have stanley's barmitsa scene.
When are they gonna release the audience reaction to this, I am interested to see how people react to this episode
the bit with the NKOTB poster I thought was just a good laugh and a good little moment between those characters. He is clearly super embarrassed by being a fan, but not with her. she gives him a winky look and turns the door again to hide it from his friends.
Holy Crap - 2017 Pennywise sounds like a Skeksis. Like the Chamberlain to be precise.
The Who is on first sketch at the end was awesome!
I agree with just about everything you said about this film, and yet I still loved IT through and through. I suppose the way you described that haunted house was a pretty good description of the rest of the film. It's gory goofy fun. It gets your heart pounding and leaves you excited for Chapter 2.
When the movie comes out in DVD do the review again please
why she got slow mo at the second time it's because that bill did not like her at first but at the second time he did
Why hello~ who's on first in the credits!!!
It should be branded as a horror comedy, I think. It's like they didn't trust the audience enough to let quiet moments build dread and suspense...like some exec was hanging over the director's head saying Ok bring the audience back with a comedy beat But...this was supposed to be scary...
Treehouse o' Horror much in the beginning, eh? That was cool. Always like the Simpsons TOHs. This was a great review. Keep it up, Doug.
Should you tell him or should I?
25:18 Just when you start to think that the 2017 It is better it reminds you of that steamy chapter in the book about Beth confronting her fears
That scene where Pennywise was dancing was funny as hell though . 😂😂
While some parts I disagree with, I think you guys are the only critics I won't hate no matter what you guys say about a movie
14:01 is that Post Malone
How do you bring hope to someone affected by suicide?\n\nAren't you supposed to be dead at that point
*WELL SAY HELLO TO MY TRIGGER BEYOTCH!*
Not poor tommy why he's so endangered
Well the chart says
Critic they don't care because it is controlling them
Why is the new penny wise is in socks
That's a terrible Moss impression.
1:50 that’s a very beautiful hydrograd vinyl you got there👀
In the begging scene are the jokers meant to be in the 1990's it's hand and the aces in the 2017's hands's because that would make more sense
excellent take, and as usual. hillarious
I knew Doug liked it; Rob's saltiness pushed down his appreciation xD\n\nI loved it (God, what a confounding title. I'm sure King did that on purpose), despite not liking horror films. I'm nearly halfway through the book, and I think it's great. My main problem with this review, is that it's difficult to back up your opinions without actual clips from the film. You tried your best, and your points are valid, regardless of whether I agree or not, but not using clips dulls the opinions you're trying to make.
Why was the demon Gorgon wearing clown shoes again
that mass shooting joke at the start was a little too soon eh?
Honestly I'm pretty sure New Pennywise wasn't that funny was because most people don't really find clowns funny, clowns are a pretty popular fear, so why not play up his creep factor a little more?\nAlthough this does beg the question as to how pennywise attracts kids AT ALL? I mean regardless of which Pennywise I saw in the drain at ANY AGE I would nope the fuck outta there.
I love how they made the conversation between the Pennywises a reference to the animated Batman episode\nWho almost got the Bat
I would of loved to see this in theaters
Lepers are scary u moron, try 2 kiss one then act tough. Also cool vid XD
I know it would be illegal. But it would be insane if they somehow allowed the  sex scene from the book.
they made fun of the child orgy. these guys are great
25:10 yeahhh, that part was really weird...
I sweat the girl at the start had a nerf gun
Man I love this review, I was kinda hesitant  going in because I'm not one for spooky stuff but I ended up not being fazed at all 👌🏻
AAAH HE SAID IT\nHE SAID THE WORD\n\n\n\n\n\ngib shrubbery?
Channel Awesome, please review An American Werewolf in London for Halloween. \nLike if you agree.
The way the makeup kept cracking on the Pennywise’s was actually creepyish.
That sewer dancing scene was my favourite part of the whole movie
Am I the only one hella annoyed by the IT characters in this, they're fucking obnoxious
I wish they played the Soviet Russian National Anthem over Pennywise dancing.
I feel like literally every single video of youtube should have that intro. Jesus.
I can’t believe it took me this long to realize this review is referencing the Batman Animated Series episode \nAlmost got him
Richie is played by Finn Wolfhard,of course he's dope
are you ever going to do pet sematary?
Cult of Chucky next?
LOLOLOL IT CROWD
Oh hi kids hahaha 😂😂😂😂
Wow this intro has horrible timing
talking so much shit
“We’re freaking clowns”!
Best nostalgia critic ever
Hi Georgie!
Nice Batman reference
Oh boi~ here we go
Huh, huh, gasp
15:30 holy crap that is funny.
1:53 that stone sour hydrograd album tho
Fuck Stanley.
Hey Georgie
meme me meme me meme me meme me
Tamara has reached maximum cuteness.
We’re friggin clowns
DO AVP REQUIEM
Gasp!
23:35 pennywise flips the bird!!!
Yay It!
review the visit!!!!!
22:51 critics old vids
I always felt like the red balloons symbolized all of the children he's killed. Am I right?
Ummm, not to be rude but that opening scene is kinda offensive because of what happened in Vegas...
The starting brings back the memory of the shooting during the Dark Knight rises screener. Kind of insensitive.
I hope you enjoy the video, if you did! Be sure to Subscribe to see more :)
You are very patronising to your grandad
your grandad is a joy to watch haha
Bent him over the machine and gave him the finger treatment cause he were paralysed and crying I honestly lost my shit 😂😂😂
Tom, your grandad got it the wrong way around.  If the royal standard (the flag that was above Buckingham palace in your vlog) is flown, the queen is in residence.  If the Union Jack is flown, the queen is NOT in residence.
Your grandad is Amazing! We Love GORDON! ❤️
So you live 2 mins down my road, get the train 30 seconds away from my work and I still haven't seen you irl for years... fml...
*Britishness intensifies*
I was in absolute hysterics from the phone call at the end. GORDON FOR PRIME MINISTER!
Gordon is a LEGEND!!!!
Had the time of his life :D
*Before watching this video.*\nAw hes so cute, so awesome. Keep it up Gordon!\n\n*After*\nYoo Gordon a savage! Bashing heads, finger treatment!
gordon is so adoreable! i love this vlog
Amazing adventure Gordon continues to be bloody hilarious
ngl i think ur a bit peak to gordan sometimes
Tom in March 2018 I'm going on that warship for a ska festival
You had it right Tom, Big Ben won't chime for 4 years.
Your grandad is so cute😩
Ok one thing I wonder what side of the family is Gordon from Toms Mothers side or his dads. He has Tom's mums smile but he looks like his dad as well.
@ronanmcmahon740
You should go on a helicopter ride and fly over London, it is the best experience ever.
Dude you have the coolest Grandad! Plz make more videos like this!!!!
How can none of them know the national anthem. That's ridiculous.

Really enjoyed this, I love your grandad. Subbed X

Aaayyy 23 on trending good job Tom
DANISH HYPE
Oh you mean this carl😂😂 I laugh so hard😂
@rodria040526
Gordon is the best!!!
6 ads 40 minutes
Old people are the best
Man like Tom on trending and all that.
Tom's gonna be so upset when Gordon passes away I think everyone will tbh
Being a guard must be such a bore
The queen is in when the royal standard is flying like the one in the vlog, not the Union Jack
I FOUND AARON RAMSEY!!
don't mess with Gordon or he will smash your face in.
So this video has barley 200k views and is in the trending section and has 8 ads in it... okay...\n\nThis guy also conned his fans.

Your Grandad needs his own Insta!! Who cares about people's cats and dogs, I wanna see a page about Gordon!❤
who would id rather be sponge bob or mr t
Did tom just say why do we need a Queen... Does he not realise that all changes to the UK and all changes to the law in the UK she has to approve or disapprove even if the UK Prime Minister wants it or not. The queen out votes them all
I got 11 bloody ads 😂
The flag above the palace was the Royal Standard meaning the Queen was in residence. The union Jack is flown when she is not.
Seen how many ads, skipped the video, wasteman.
Your grandad is the cutest!!! 😂😊
I HAVE THAT BATMAN V SUPERMAN POSTER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel so happy that I have something in common with tom (apart that we are both from Manchester)
That ending tho! 😂
Your right tom about the pendolino or technically class 390 its max speed is 140mph but only goes 125mph
I remember meeting tom at Euro gamer 2013 outside the building in front of the surgeon van I was wearing a Minecraft creeper t-shirt
i think toms business syndicate original should sell a light grey jackets just like cordons. id buy that shit! gordon is a legend
Mate it won't even ding dong after they've fixed it😂😂
Your granddad is so freaking adorable!!
Russia is in Asia bro...
Is Tom's grandad from his mum's or dad's side?.
How can anyone support Trump? I'm not into politics but plz tell me how Trump is a good president or a better president then Obama? I don't recall being concerned about the world ending when Obama was president...
This is really  gay
bruh that was amazing
Any liberals want to be honest and say that wasn't that great or is that not allowed in your cult? You guys are like Scientologists
Trump is so own by Eminem.
What's a matter Eminem scared your black counterparts won't like you if you talk shit about Obama! Pfft goat my ass, more like sheep of all time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnxPbNUSBt0&feature=share my reaction after watching this
He's gon get rid of all immigrants lmaoooo finny voice

its just not my type music nomo
The rap god is the truth
I got chills That was beautiful Damn I love Em!✊🏾✊🏼✊🏿
I love Eminem, but I don't agree with his raps against Trump, I'm all for Trump, he is way better then Obama, and when was he racist against black people?? Let's just see what Trump does.
can people understand that he's freestyling and adressing real issues in the american system due to donald trump
Ehh still like your music and trump so...
Stan was lucky he killed himself in order to avoid seeing what became of Eminem.
Em was for free speech. Anti gov, counter culture, anti-Establishment. Why is he doing what every celeb has done already. Im tried if it.
They gave him a pass to say that... Ain't falling for it...\nBut that fantastic four reference tho...
I guess all those black dudes behind Eminem got nothing to say... smh.
That doesnt even look like him
Some of the dumbest shit iv'e ever heard!
That's enough cringe for today.
Did Eminem loose his talent or what? This is terible
Hi, I am a White Christian American. I work in the Mainstream media. As an ideal father and husband it's my duty to provide my family so that me and my family can live LAVISHLY. But my salary is not enough for that. So I have to take bribes from Hindus and Muslims and lobby for them ( even if it directly or indirectly harms other White Christian Americans ). I don't even hesitate to say what Hindus say, 'Jai Hind'. I don't even hesitate to say what Muslims say, 'Allah Ho Akbar'. I don't even hesitate to say 'Death to White Christians'. At the same time I wish myself and my family a happy and LAVISH life.
Before you treat him like some righteous activist championing a just cause, may I remind you that he's dropping an album next month and is performing the EXACT same stunt every major rapper does before a major release: dissing celebrities to gain relevancy and attention. Trump's been president for almost a year, and Em decides to speak on it now, right before he drops an album? Please.
This needs to be the national anthem for as long as Trump is president.
The text is killing it😍💪💪💪💪
he's the new king of crap
Stupidity will bring this country down, especially if you believe in this he is saying.
Why he hating our president he’s the people that are going to start world war 3
This is most idiotic thing I have ever seen. Yeah, you're hard, there, Marshall. You'd pee your pants if you ever came into contact with The Donald.
Everyone knows Em can do 100x better than this, he probably thought about this freestyle in 2 minutes. If he took his time to write a diss track about trump he would murder his career, like he murdered Ja Rule's career .
speaking the truth about a races president that no one respect be honest he's a member of the KKK
fuk up, where have you been for the last fuking 3 years
Pure shit. This is idiotic. You used to be good.
That's Why you're a Legend. Screaming shady till I die .😚
I would say that we've officially reached the peak of free expression with this one.  I fucks with it
I'm not with you
This is the most hypocritical freestyle of all time. Anyone remember when Eminem was endorsing Trump and hanging out with him? Both Trump and Eminem are very similar, they have been slandered by the feminists and new outlets for saying offensive yet true things. They both hate the mainstream. Oh, and also, Eminem is from Detroit, one of the most problematic places in the world that Trump promised to fix up.
Ok look I love em but got this is shi but bro this sucks don’t get me wrong I love em I been a fan since I was little but it sucks come on em all love
Why can't everyone just *love* each other? Eminem is just dividing us up even more..
Idk, seems like a joke...
Eminem is back
Eminem wearing those Sashiko NMDs 🔥
im seriously confused. Wtf is this
Well that was classless.
Eminiem
Rap God 😍
What a sellout
Mosh 2.0?
Fire
Eminem a bitch
cmon its eminem don't censor it like wtf
Props to Obama? Yet thanks to Trump, ISIS is fleeing from Raqqa???
When he went redneck😂😂😂
Eminem Now Supports Trump !! :D\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLslNlzAAtI
🖕 u
Thank you Eminem!
True though
Yo!
TY  VAJCOS!!
Dude went hard lol
180,000+ Butthurt Trump Supporters LMAO
Eminem over Trump any day
✊
✊
Damn that was raw.
He went ham
I DONT HEAR THEM DUMP TRUMP SUPPORTERS TALKIN SHIT NOW
You wreckt him
AGAINST!
You amazing man
woohoooooo donald thumbs up
top 3 wrappers:\n1. plastic\n2. paper\n3. aluminum foil

Fock off Marshall - you chug cocks.
Garbage.
Title should be called:Eminem *KILLS* Donald Trump
Eminems freestyle so sick made me vomit 💣💣🔥🔥🔥
Stay retired u monkey joke
This is kinda terrible
No respect worst rap ever Eminem highly disappointed
Baby 😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤
That isn't him..
LMAO he killed him
This shit is trash dawg he actually had a reason to hate on bush lol.
It's very bold of him to risk his fan following..... characterstic of an honest and strong man !!
Eminem tried to kill Trump but commited suicide...........
donald trump get pressed by the legend EMIN3M ❤ This Is lit
Guys... I figured out the Trump/Against Trump debate. \n\nTrump supporters hear his words/theories and agree with him. After all, a lot of what he says makes sense IF IT WAS THE TRUTH. THE PROBLEM IS, a lot of what he says are outright lies and fabrications of the truth. So people that pay attention to the details realize that he is wrong and is making this country worse. \n\nGood intentions on both sides, just one side needs to pay attention to the details and the reality of the situation a bit closer....
I'm a Muslim American and I support Trump.
I hate the orange piece of shit,just as much as i hate this wigger.
Did Em just choke when he said stop? Looks like he choked the first time in his career
This is not freestyle. This is memorized you idiots
You realise Trump was voted in right ? Maybe u should vote a different way next time . Tho i do understand his opponent is just as evil and useless . Hmm hard to choose from 2 piles of shit I guess
lol who this guy? His irrelevant head ass, trying to get hype. Lame
This was a nice way to commit career suicide lol. Goodbye Eminem
When you rap about rape, drugs, sex and killing but still get support from Liberals and Anti-Trump Supporters
was gutted when you didn't try the urban outfitters dress on :(
I LOVE your makeup! Minimal face makeup and eyes and a bolder lip. Very different than a lot of looks that you rock, but it's perfect and I want to try it!
Really digging the minimal makeup and that you can see some of your beautiful freckles more! Love the vid as always Helen!
Do you ever shop in Pull & Bear? I just imagine a lot of the stuff being things you'd wear!
Just wanted to comment on how stunning you're looking in this video! xo
Ordered those slouchy tops you love from UO today a rose colour and dark grey cannot wait to try them now I need that button one. Love you xxx
I can’t find a good pair of jeans anywhere!! I’ve tired topshop Jamie jeans (last 6 months) tried new look (sizing is so bad), asos again sizing issues (always falling down) superdry jeans (too pricey & fake pockets) so any suggestions I’m open too XD.  #help!!!
Helen you look stunning in white! 😊
That pink jacket screams Dolores Umbridge 😂 but I love it
Those shoooeees!!!!! 😍  And I love the toned down makeup look!
Loving the simpler make up on you ..so pretty
I've just found you through Megan and I'm SO CHUFFED! You're wonderful! New fan :)
I love your hair with that bow it looks soo cute!
Why didn't she try on the dress?  I wanted to see it :(
Hi Helen ! In what size did you buy the yellow jumper from Zara? Just asking for reference, I like my jumpers to be oversized but not too much 😅😊
Oh my gosh you are soooooooo beautiful ... I love the no makeup look and your hair are on point  🤘💗🎀
you look sooo beautiful! love the minimal makeup look on you!! 🤗💕
looooved your hair and makeup in this video helen! x
Where are your pants from ? The ones with the cow print ? 😊
I don’t know why Helen, but you are one of my favorite youtubers! You are always so happy.. I love your editing... the colors.. the music and ofcourse your style! You are just so cool :D
Primark have jumpers almost the exact same as the one around 5 mins, it's chenille! Th only difference is the neckline
Eeee I have that white jumper with the fluffy sleeves and I adoooree it!! It's so nice on and super comfy 🖤
You look so young and fresh in this video! Would love to see an updated skincare routine, your skin looks amazeballs.
I love the lipstick you're wearing in the cut away!!!!
OMG YOUR MAKE UP LOOKS STUNNING! love love love it!
You have the most beautiful facial bone structure! ❤️ kisses!
Can you consider signing up and selling on Depop please!? LOVE most pieces you wear.
You are literally the girl in me before you. You look and sound the exact same
I dont want to say that i like you way more without much eye makeup or in general makeup, but you LOOK SO GOOD and fresh without heavy makeup! It looks so natural and ..just great! :)
Crazy I never noticed your eye colour before! Must be your makeup today -  😍
You look AMAZING in everything 😍😍😍
That white jumper from Zara looks\namazing on you! Reminds me of Christmas!!!
LOVING LOVING LOVING you in minimal makeup you look so fresh and Parisian!
Makeup looking lovely! Few things will be seeking out this weekend. It's Prince of Wales check, rather than dogtooth or herringbone x
Omg you look so pretty with minimal makeup!!!! ❤
You are so beautiful Helen x
Loveing the makeup! You have beautifull skin and don't need foundation :D
I love the way you manage to make everyday or more casual outfits look really interesting and glam. You have the best style :)
everything about you is perffffff xx
You are so beautiful. Your lashes are just INCREDIBLE.
Just wanna say how much I love your videos and the effort you put into each of them. Got a little bummed when I didn’t seen “try on” in the title, but alas! You tried things on (I hate when hauls aren’t try ons, you don’t know what things look like!) You never disappoint.
OMG, babez, you look so cute today! What is that lipstick you're wearing in the try ons? It looks so beautiful on you! Pls let me know! xx
Always find it weird  I see stuff I already own in hauls
ahhhh I’m trying to save money😩😩😩😩😩
Where's the jumper ur wearing from? It's amazing
This could've potentially been a very expensive video for me to watch, if I didn't have to shop in the girls/teen section of every store! 😂😂😂
That top at the end went with everything you put on! Love it 😍
Actually loving the lighter makeup on you, looks so fresh! And that white jumper from Zara wowza! XX
@Helen if you want to revive your old face jeans you can buy some dylon dye that you put in the washer, worked a dream for me! hope this helps!!<3
i looove the lace up kinda jeans so much!!
As soon as you said that you’ll love this jumper I knew which one it was before it came up, saw it the other day and fell in love 😍😍😍
On the white boots, the right foot has a stud missing.. unsure if you noticed?! 💗💗
I love the fluffy sleeves from Zara - such a statement piece :) xx
I bought a mustard jumper just like that yesterday but in Primark, fucking LOVE it!! So warm and incredibly soft 😍 \nLove, love, love your sense of style! 💞 xx
The v neck on the rusty/mustardy jumper looked really flattering on you, Helen! Really lovely. Love your hauls :) x
Your pink coat YES I'M IN LOVE
You didn't show us you in the yellow dress!!
I absolutely love how mustard colored clothes look with your purple hair 😍
Love love love that you have your own style and that you aren't like all the other you tubers that are carbon copy's of each other. So refreshing 💕💕
Those bright pink trousers look so good on you! I'm loving everything you've gotten in this haul 😊 x
The slight rumbling makes me think of paranormal activity when the bass comes up when crazy shit is about to happen
They do the coat in grey as well - bought it a few weeks ago it's amazing!!
You look so lovely and fresh without lots of eye make up!
You look AMAZING in the cutaways!! I don't know if it's your make up or weight loss but your face just looks incredible, and obvs just love this video because what's not to love 🤙
Hel you look so cute and fresh faced in the cutaways where you’re trying the stuff on!
Love your style Helen- so fun which is what fashion should be !
looking so cute with this make up 😍😍 great video Helen 😊❤❤
On the white boots there is a big stud missing ( right side of the screen)
Helen, how do you like the UO top? I've been eyeing it forever and am on the fence about buying it because I'm plus size so I don't know how well it'd fit me.
Do a video with all your favourite new looks!
The fact that I can kinda hear the music but not really is making me crazy
I love this makeup!!!! Like the minimal eye and brighter cheek makes you look like a beautiful doll!!!! Love u <3
You just ooze beauty and are so stunning ☺️ I genuinely dig your whole aesthetic ❤️❤️
I love white boots! I have a pair of white platform ankle boots with a three inch heel, the entire thing made me five inches taller! I wore them to death though and I think they only have about two wears left before they really fall apart!
I was watching this intro thinking what have u done different your makeup looks so good and fresh!! Then u said u had hearsay any on 😱 man I wish I looked fresh with no makeup lol
Can we just talk about how everything fits her perfectly?
That's a Helen coat 🍉💜 Love the whole haul. Xoxo
Helen where is your jumper from?? I lurvvvv it xx
Yes! Loving the makeup!
Oo I really like those lace-up trousers and that coat!

You look great
That coat 😍😍
The jeans with the eyelets looking fricking amazing!!
Prefer you makeup here
The 'rusty mustard' jumper material is called chenille 😘
OMG! Finally I found a liverpool youtuber! 👏👏👍
The material is called cheneille I think ? So incredible in jumper form and doesn't get bobbly !
Haha love you girl your lipstick missing in the corner and mascara  all over your eyelid.  No fucks given
I love your style! ❤❤❤
I love your videos especially the hauls.. I love hearing you describe items hahaha, rustardy mustardy :)
Loved this? Where’s the cute blue tie up top from? xoxo
Why are British youtubers so spoiled,snobby and self absorbed? Zoella, her bf, this one? And why r they always trending? Is this remotely entertaining?
I am seriously considering a full on genderbending dragqueen lifestyle when I see half the clothes you buy and wear. Like that floral mustard dress, good lord, I'd be living my Janis Joplin at Woodstock-dream 24/7!

Hi guys, thanks for featuring the Spacedrum® (Metal Sounds company, France) in this cover, that's really great!
I love the cabinet and the way you've organised it. 😍
It’s not the table. I think it’s the picture above it. You should leave the table and replace the picture with something smaller.
Omg that carrot cutter is GENIUS
Your the first person who I’ve heard that is exactly like me! Literally the week before my period I can never get full! And I crave everything! Of course not healthy stuff lol
Boy cats who wee a lot in the wrong place even though they're fixed might have kidney stones.  It happens a lot to fixed males and he could be trying to tell you something
Also could you do an updated video all about your scrap booking?
I wish I had pale skin 😭😭😭
I love the cabinet but maybe you should move the picture 😂
I've lived in Brighton my whole life and hardly ever go to the beach 😫 need to start!
Did she say she was chubs? Omg... if she's chubby I can't imagine what the rest of us must be.

Cats like plastic because it has a smell to them that’s like cat pheromones. I know a boy cat called Snickers that CANNOT be trusted around plastic packaging.
Hey Gabriella, I usually don't comment, but I watch your videos all the time... I thought that if you turn your leaf print to portrait instead landscape it might look better with a smaller cabinet. xx

Gabby your literally me when I am pms crying to my friends on FaceTime and them laughing at me, usually I cry about wanting pizza 😂😂

What the heck is with the carrot scissors!? That's ingenious 😍 so much easier than them pinging off the chopping board. Wow. Need that haha
U should put like small tables on either side of the cabinet to fill the space up. Just an idea.😉😄
I normally get really upset when people cry, but cause she said it's PMS I couldn't stop laughing bc same 😂
Don’t usually bother commenting on videos but this is my favourite vlog this year! ❤️
Those adverts are really annoying.
Non
Dont play Cahill for Ffs i said in my line u play C.Ap A.c Rud \nPlay david in mid we were so rubbish its unbelievable honest why did we not keep the ball bats had his chance i would have played Ped from the starts instead of William our team needs to do some much hard core training we playes a team that have a game since the start . The 2nd goal wtf wtf wtf come on he runs past u and score . Please we need to play A.C Rud at the bk . We have serious need of players . Simple
think we should concentrate on europe, man city are looking on another level this year.....
Michy isn't a premiership player we are playing as a mid table side
Bakayoko was the best player. Michy was the worst. And there were some people who said they prefered that formation over the false 9...
Just a shit day. Big players like Hazard, Azpi who are consistently brilliant were completely out of it today. It's clear to see why Michy isn't rated by Conte. We've got Tammy banging them in for Swansea, infinitely better than Michy who imo plays better with a second striker. No Kante, no Drinkwater, no Morata, Moses goes off, just a shit day. Happens. Conte should rotate? With what?\n Hasn't got the players or quality to rotate. We move on and we put it right asap. COME ON CHELSEA!
Sophie here! Apologies I meant David Luiz back from suspension not injury! Besides this, I do feel our title hopes are unfortunately over. Our rivals are displaying much better performances. Thoughts??
Things that went wrong for me. Willan ,Alonso,michy. No quality in backup. Board didn't back Conte he was calling for it all summer. Probably a cup top 8 or top 4 in champions league and see pep take the league when we could have build on a winning season
The Kante rumour was meant to trigger you guys. Kante wouldn't get in to that PSG midfield.
Stunning Sophie would love to tie you to that bed and do torturous things to you~ \n\nOut title race is over, Hazard will leave for Madrid because of Willian's wankstain ability.\n\nCahil still starts, Christiensen dropped for no reason. \n\nConte still the stubborn old bag he is. Michi needs to fuck off the Twitter merchant cunt.
Hazard is not a world class player..
I noticed on a football stream the commentator mention that we are at the exact  same stage for points, goals, etc as we were at exactly the same stage as last season. Interesting...
Its not the end of the season just yet and just like last season chelsea will start winning their games and get more points 2 win the league . 4 this season , I think Chelsea might become first and do what they did last season
I can definitely see you Sophie 💦💦
This always happens with Chelsea. Those who run the club run it like a business so they do not invest to maintain the momentum. The root problem is at the top with the board who in turn have to do what the Russian Oligarch says. The incompetence at board level is breath-taking. They do not get behind the manager at Chelsea by investing. You can win the Champions League or the title at Chelsea and still get the sack....that is a dictatorship that demands success yesterday. And yet despite being a business rather than a football club, they can't even run a frigging business properly. The Mancs and the North London lot must be having a right laugh. Mourinho must be so very relieved to have moved on from this Chelsea board. They want success quickly that's why the youth team will never get established in the first team. It gets so very weary and exasperating supporting Chelsea which I have done for nearly 50 years. I knew of the 31 August deadline day that the inexcusable indifference of the Chelsea board to reward Conte for the title was a sign that the lack of depth would mean yet another exasperating season after winning the title. No loyalty to managers from the board, no heart, no steel, no true leaders. And to think some people think they will have a right good go at the Champions League.... It's helpful to not hope too much from Chelsea and why? Because they NEVER LEARN from their mistakes. In the real world those board members would have been sacked long ago. But not at a Business run farce like farce like this lot.  Have something else substantial in your life apart from Chelsea Sophie is my advice.
its about time tammy abraham next season should be first team regular next year man on form in swansea he should play with alvaro mrata week in week out charly musonda shold be given more time
As a city fan I was felling like this when we lost at Leicester and Everton so really Chelsea fans welcome to reality I'm enjoying heaven with city. Secondly best was fabregas and worst Mr invisible hazard
You  are better pundit than some at Sky sports, keep it up . Chelsea will come back
batshuay out. call Tammy Abraham, Even if he is not going to score but he has good movement than Batshuay. I hate Batshuay
Michy isn't as good as other strikers. He doesn't make runs or give defenders a hard time. It was his time to shine but he never. Now I understand why conte doesn't rate him. Just a shitty day but I hope we bounce back against Roma.
the problem with chelsea is your overconfident conte prick! you shouldnt change your winning comibination be it any sport! the guy let costa, matic leave who were key players for you the last time so it shouldnt be a shock to you!
Conte didn't even  commit long-term to Chelsea and he was allowed to get away with offloading Costa, our top goal scorer, one of the best in the PL. Now we're seeing the effect of that. Chelsea is done for now and the next 2 years, we won't win anything. Conte will not attract any top player with this attitude.
Bakayoko and fabregas were the only players showing any real passion but weren't good enough like the rest of the squad. Cahill needs to be dropped completely we have 2 centre backs on the bench who are better and have passion. Willian isn't the same player he used to be which is a concern as he has been so good in the past. Zappacosta looked good when he came on. If we are that desperate for a striker then we should recall Abraham? He needs to work alongside people like Morata to show quality. Simply not good enough.
i don't think you can retain your title. top four/cup is the best for you, but even if conte is not at fault, he would get the sack if he doesn't do much this season. that said, he IS at fault for you lot, sicne he's got shit tactically wrong.
If we still have Costa and Matic in that match .............
Best performance was Cahill , worst was azpilicueta , all the rest were awful
Conte of late is making a habit picking the wrong squad....cahill,willian keep strolling into the team when they are clearly out of form.....rudiger,pedro,christinsen keep warming the bench...why??something is going on behind the scenes and conte needs to sort out the issue.
Not only were Chelsea the first team to concede to the one of the worst premier league teams ever (not scoring for 7 games straight, losing all) but they also lost to that team.\n\nWow....
Conte needs to just fucking get over it. work with what u got. we still have enough in our squad to beat a shit side like Palace. He needs to get he head in it because he is obviously distracted by something.
Can someone tell this chick that its not about the selection its about the whole team... We needed reinforcements in the summer.. Maybe Cahil shouldn't start but having Willian and Alonso with no replacement... Michy aint a  footballer!! \nAnyone that thinks Michy is by any chance better than Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo then you're deluded!!!\nI don't know why i'm commenting here...fuck this shit hahaha!
I think Tammy Abraham is better than Michy. 4 Epl goals in 5 game is absolutely good talent.  We need to back him because off we need him.
we'll be okay against Roma
Unless Man City do an Arsenal and crumble spectacularly towards end of season, then the title is surely theirs.. This Chelsea squad isn't as good as last years. Sell Matic get Drinkwater?! Transfer window was a joke, Morata is good but he's just one player. We're gonna be fighting for a top four place for sure!\nStill early days, gonna reserve full judgement until around November. Echo other comments would like top four finish with stronger emphasis on Champs league.
Babe shows us some cleavage when Chelsea looses as it will at least help a bit
Oh Conte's a little bit rubbish now.. Just go do one Sophie ffs
Sophie babes I wish u was mine so peng 😍❤️
Please popularise this comment to conte. Some improvements: buy aubameyang to play him up front with Morata. Also, get Sanchez. His skill works amazing with hazard and pedro and Willian. Imagine that. Sanchez. Aubameyang. We have the money! Cmon conte!!!!!
Yeah, concentrate on CL That'll help.......
Can u dress like u did in soccer am
Well firstly Rory never has a clue! Didn’t see the match today first one missed in ages , I do agree we won’t win the league. Man City will easily but we should try and at least push for 2nd or 3rd
We need Jamie Vardy pay the 40 or 50m
Got a phone number ?
It’s funny coz I was getting clothes for my holiday and there was a palace supporter severing me and I was like I think palace will win as a joke and he was like nah Chelsea will smash us and here we, I was right even though I didn’t want to be 😂
Drinking water,)\nToday in Liverpool vs man United\n one  player\n he looks like a big STARS on the making.. unbelievable \n.. 11..⏳👌👏
Batshuayi looses the ball so easily, he just can't hold up the ball. On top of that many players underperformed today ( don't want to pin point them ). Yes after this game the title hopes are realistically over, unless we pull off something great.
really dislike michy as a player
4 min in and your analysis is....what is it exactly? You are not consistent and you are too emotional. I will chalk it up to thinking with you heart. \n\nGive credit to Palace and the position they were in. They don’t want to break the record for worst start to a season. Zaha has always given us problems and was running riot on Cahill and Alonso. Townsend and C are quality and the ball and luck was with them. \n\nChelsea was looking forward to midweek obviously. The analysis is quite easy for an educated footballer/supporter. I know you have it in you. \nI recommend writing up some outline notes and maybe watch highlights to refresh you memory. I support  you and your Channel and I love you as a fellow fan...and of course dem tig-o-bittties heheh 😏\n\n#COYB
Hellooo gorgeous, u look healthier than the previous video..I think baka n ces should not play together.. agree w/ u Rudi, Andreas n Azpi as the back three.. and why Willian Conte????
I want to see only two things this season, and you know it...
Sophie is class,speaks a lot of sense. - Manchester Utd fan.
Fabregas was world class that match, it's a shame he was the only one who was half decent though. Even Bakayoko was average because, apart from his goal, his performance was sub par. I still have faith in Conte to bring us back into the title race however. COYB
You just got beat by the *CRYSTAL PALACE* football club, formed in *1861* then founded in *1905*
This season is all about the Champions League. If we finished 4th, that would be fine considering our injuries and lack of depth for now. Roman is all about the CL and unless we take points from Roma, it's going to be ugly. If we don't make the round of 16, the season may be the Mourinho year we didn't think possible. Would back-to-back losses to Roma be the end of Conte? He looked pretty angry in the post-match press conference. Too bad there's not an October window.\n\nMitchy showed what no one is willing to say, and that is he doesn't actually create anything and he's scored his goals almost accidentally. Better as a sub when nothing else is working. I wasn't surprised to see Musonda. I expect to see him play v. Roma, even if Conte says Morata will play.
You are going to be very happy I suppose when Conte leaves !! Mitchy suuuuuucksssss
I hope you manage to decipher that I am a real Chelsea Fan amongst the idiots in this comments section, born and raised Chelsea Wharf and Worlds End.\n\n1.What's the big crisis? We lost to the current premiership leaders 1-0, and lets be honest they have been killing all the competition 4-0, 5-0, 7-0 etc.\n\n2. Palace away , who lets not forget are great going forward.\n\n3.A depleted squad with an own goal to boot.\n\n4.INTERNATIONAL duty meant players got injured and fatigued.\n\nCmon you Blues!!
Everyone was just bad, no one did any good.....
I want to be with you in your flat Sophie
clickbait
I've seen your tits😳
Embarrassing...nothing more to say.
Llorente didn't want to join Chelsea, prefered Tottenham anyway.
Highlights | Live Match Review?
😍😘😗😙😑
Bring back Tammy, play Christensen, Rudiger, Azpi! :(
Hazard was terrible
who's zara?
except bakayoko nobody was good without kante
Best - Zappacosta Worst - Luiz
You missed MATIC !
Fuck u guys
Poor game
Title hopes are gone :(
Tammy Abrahams to be recalled?
bring back tammy ffs
Ur so beautiful baby girl
Yes Sophie we had an arguement few days ago about  this game, as we all worried  about it, as we all can smell problems in our team. Palace is not an average team, they are loaded with some very good players and a very good coach. Zaha  is probably better than most of the Chelsea attackers, and Townshend is a better  winger than any Chelsea's wingers. Conte is very upset, very angry and probably will not sleep for a few nights. he knows he made mistakes, and he is a very good learner. Let's hope  he will do his homework well. Problem is not just a debt. We have now 4!!!! injured players and at least  2-3  completely  out of form. We do have Musonda and we do have Kennedy. maybe Conte should  give these two  a fair chance
The difference between us and the Manchester clubs are why we are not as good as them, our squad is just as good, if not better, but we mess up against teams like this, and when we do win we sit back and defend when the Manchester clubs go to destroy every team. We need to play like we did against Atletico every game, we need to stop this sitting back game plan now.
can we play you every week......and didnt we beat you last season......get over it
I fking called it.. if rorey stops doing those 5 reasons that we smash crystal palace and such bullshit and jinx the damn team always against these minnows it would be appreciated. lol
Now you see why Michi should not start.
Wahey! Hahahaha fucking palace the Geordie's will show you's southern cunts how it's done next week!
We are missing a leader up front, which is Costa.
Let's be honest.  Conte is going to leave. The board are clearly pissing him off and it's effecting the team.  Not contes fault.  Fuck the board
I tried to troll Chelsea but then realize we have just lost 2-1 to  Watford
Truth. Conte is rigid. Christensen can play on the LCB.\nTruth. Trust a woman's intuition, Rory. Your positivity is on plastic levels.\n\nBest performance is Cesc. Worst is the whole team.\n\nNo chance of League. Don't dream of Cups (except Sophie's). Conte's record in cup competition is abysmal.
Chelshit
I only hope Christensen goes to a better team that will value him, why on earth are we not playing a class young CB who will be the best defender in the world.
The Atletico was one of my favourite performances ever from us, we actually attacked. City was back to normal, just trying to sit back and defend, and a poor team choice from Conte, then this game was just embarrassing, we had players missing but still.
fuck off   chelsea
Exchange batshuayi for Zaha in January
Hazard is inconsistent for us but for Belgium he bangs in goals all day long
We will still win the league
is that bon iver at 2:15 taking pics!?
Anymore similar songs? Please I love this kinda of beat 😍😍
Great song, honestly is. But how all the black people trying to get to the penthouse, just let the protesters AND cops in after they simmered down and the representative hat, being a symbol of the deep rooted fucked up times in america, was taken off like eh forget it.? hmmm?

great video, message, and representation, but at the end of the day, as an asian american, all i gotta say is of course you used the token hot asian girl for asian representation. not even an asian guy in there
i seriously dont understand whats going on in this video.
Absolutely love that mans voice so mellow just lifts you up no matter how bad your day was. Ty
Am i the only one who can't stop to replay this jam??

Good thought provoking video and lyrcis, only the song is not enjoyable at all, just to plain and faint
this is what i need
Can i reminds me of i feel it coming
Who else liked the video before even watching it???☺️☺️💕💕💕
this music video is retarded it shows all those whites in the ball room and cops as racists and stuck in past yet the only ones stuck in the past are black people still crying about racism its 2017 you fucks you have equal rights its not 1830 anymore fucking hell when will you open up your eyes and see that everyone is the same if anything youre racist for thinking everyone thats not black is racist that is definition of racism hating others for not having the same skin color
frank ocean would have done a number on this beat
JOHN LEGEND SUCKS AND SO DOES CHANCE PLEASE RETIRE AND GO AWAY
So groovy. I love it ❤
Great music! This video is amazing

keep  your libtard wife on leash, you lesbo cunt
I remember watching this and Seth receiving some backlash online by people who didn't get the joke. They thought it was awkward and uncalled for but with new light being shed on Weinstein's assault charges, I'm sure some of those same people are jumping on their high horses now like Oh, I knew all along!!!! Smh.
The people on Hollywood know about all the sex and pedophilia and didn't do shit. Screw them all
This comment section is fucking disgusting. Can none of you scrotum licking cuntshits not think of ANYTHING to call people than 'faggot' 'nigger' and 'feminist'? Go back to licking Trump's anus.
So in everybody's face, creepy feeling about this one.
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
People did say something. Multiple people did. They were paid off, or they weren't believed, or their story just didn't reach enough people to make a difference. Meanwhile people made jokes like this, knowing Weinstein was a creep and adulterer and maybe rumours of his crimes but not having anything concrete enough to convince anyone. Blaming victims for not coming forward is cruel and nonsensical. A lot of them did and it made no difference, and they faced retribution. Blaming Seth MacFarlane is questionable. He joked about rumours. If he'd known any specific detail about any assault it's doubtful he'd be treating it in such a joking manner. Plus, he did publicly speak about the rumours which is what a lot of people didn't.\nThe primary problem here is the behaviour of one terrible man. The secondary problem is how hard it is for the victims should they choose to share their stoties, and how unwilling people are to treat them seriously or even look into them. About that secondary problem, we can all work a little harder on this.
Out of anger? Im 99.9% sure anyone can see his was making a joke and not a bit angry.

So you only reveal now, smh
As disgusting as Harvey Weinstein's actions are I'm really confused as to why people care so much when they didn't seem to care this much about Trump. (I'm not saying it's bad that people care about it, it just seems weird considering who is the president.) Could someone please explain to me why one is seen as fine but the other isn't? I'm seriously curious.
😂😂😂😂 this guy is litreally a legend
Hollywood is Dead...This was a great foreshadowing of this https://wp.me/p5TGq4-2AdL
Dilion harper had a strange haircut back then
I guess Harvey raped seth McFarlane too, no wonder he loves rape so much he's an expert at it
They all took the job
As a man,I am sickened by other men who think they can violate women and get away with it. Call me a feminist all you want,but I hate to see disrespectful disgusting pigs like Pervstein thinking they can get away with this kind of behavior. Ladies,just please remember that not ALL men are sex crazed lunatics. There are still some honest,respectful guys in this world,who don't view women as nothing more than a piece of meat ☺❤🌹
Its just a JOKE that even if Harvey heard it he'll laugh. its the way friends joke. its the way EVERY Oscars host made against the nominees.  \nEveryone in hollywood knew about Weinstein, and Seth more than others given that Jessica Barth confided in him long ago. And did he call the cops in the years since? No. Did he speak out in a serious non-friendly-joke manner? No. He just settled on a joke that no one cared about until now. What good that joke did since 2013? \nIf religious people or Trump did something wrong, Seth would've marched in the streets in protest. And now that Harvey's been exposed Seth tries to be in the spotlight and take credit for a telling a joke. He's a hypocritical asshole.
everybody fucking knew, but lets attack Ben Affleck. \nIf he is hypocrite so do all of you are.
I don’t think he was even joking here. He looks pissed that people are laughing about how it. He said it to make it sound like a joke but his face says it all.
Seth MacFarlane honestly isn't that funny
Who won?
Can someone fill me in on what the fuck this is? I need context. And it came up in my trending tab
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
it wasn't a joke
CNN was first to get exposed, now it's Hollywood and next will be academia.  The three megaphones of cultural Marxism are slowly and surely being silenced.
hey there im just starting out you tubing and will like to see some support on my channel \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5CfnO3bRTCqkwHs3Fv2x1w
I wonder which leading ladies have let Harvey do them ? And are they being quiet because now they feel like ladder climbing whores?
with jews, you lose. Non jews are literally referred to as cattle (goyim). Chief Rabbi of Israel Ovidi Yosef, The only reason to keep non jews alive is because they are donkeys meant to serve the jews. Had a million jews attend his funeral.
Just makes you wonder if an actress got to where they are on their own merits or because they conformed to the Casting Couch!!!   How embarrassing for someone like Ashley Judd to make an ass out of herself calling Trump out for something WAYYYYYY LESS disgusting than what this PIG did to so many women.   Amazing how many twisted women like Meryl Streep continued to praise and bow down to this Nasty Creep, KNOWING his reputation with women and perhaps her own experience with him.
LOLITA EXPRESS. Look it up on YOUTUBE!!! IT'S AWESOME
He makes my skin crawl, i wouldnt be suprised if he's a nonce himself

All hilarys friends are rapists... And now we know why hollywood wanted her in the white house.
Fox news is full of rapists and sexual harassers, but no one said anything for years until the final lawsuit came out.\n\nThe president has been accused of multiple counts of sexual assault and rape, yet we reward him by giving him the highest appointment in the land.\n\n\nStop acting like this is some Hollywood oddity. This isn't a problem that is unique to one industry or country. Everyone has to face it and come to terms with it  to come up with a solution. At least the much maligned mainstream media is talking about it and not down playing it like every right wing news organisation does about the Trump, or Fox News stories. Accountability isn't only exclusive to the left.
Courtney Love called him out in 2003
They all knew yet they said nothing.
it's funny because he raped women.
watch some more here http://yobuilder.com/AoHH
He gives no fucks what he said. 😂
0:27 That guy laughing the loudest was actually Harvey Weinstein himself.
I feel like he meant well but that comment was slightly degrading to women. It's like he implied that they were okay with pretending. But I don't think he meant it that way, it just came out that way
How is this 'calling out Harvey Winstein'? This is more a jab at the women or actresses in general.
Everyone knew and no one had the stones to say anything ? they all laughed about it secretly knowing. Shame
holy Shit!,Seth MacFarlane sounds like Mitch Lucker from Suicide Silence \n\nhe should be the new frontman!,I pictured his talking voice becoming his screaming voice and it sounds FUCKING AWESOME IN MY HEAD!\n\nMitch Lucker 2.0!
And another thing people are given out oh he knew and never done anything about it ,how could he what's he going to say to the cops I believe he's a rapist , the only thing he was able to do was to say it to a large audience he called him out in front of all actors making it none to All  women  ,it was up to the women themselves to report it until then nothing can be done
simply proving the hollywood shock & outrage today is predictably fake. (smh)
Actresses pretending to be attracted to producers is nothing new. This title is misleading. That joke works just as well with any other producer, including Seth, himself.
Yes he made a joke, most people would not have known what he was talking about, why didn't he expose him properly 4 years ago, alot of women would have been saved from his unwanted advances another Hypocrite.
Don't go down there.....the comment section gets pretty brutal.
Everyone already knew and nobody did shit about it. The public will have the same reaction once the child sex rings are finally exposed even though everyone with a brain could already see it.
Ehh nothing new it's been that way in Hollywood since the 1940s hell almost half of Entourage season 4 episodes address's this issue.
that was just making a joke of the disgusting behavior, not calling him out.  Additionally if you google the ass clown you will find that he explicitly says he did not want to call him out....It is just another case of liberals protecting liberals and shows us how far hollywood and its heros and idols have fallen.
All of them new now pretend to be shoked...son of a bitch
Jews
Poor man. Why all come out now. Seems like its fake
You call this a call out, i call it making a joke of something he obviously knew and in the process made his co-host look sick at what he was suggesting.
that face though... https://youtu.be/L1Ki-fun_8U
The look on his face. He fucking meant it.
I keep rewatching this
In the end he’s like “Yea I’m joking but.. come on..”
We've stayed silent until now. We feared. We were threatened. We needed to rebuild our lives. But we can no longer sit back and let the monsters who sexually assaulted women and raped girls to roam free. Please check out famous actress Kate del Castillo movie about her abuse: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOX3tjTVgQc
This harvey weinstein is your typical kike sheeny yid piece of shit!  He should be thrown in a concentration camp and be rapped in all holes until he dies from it!
People on here seem surprised that Hollywood is full of hypocrites and fakes.They're actors for crying out loud. They are professional fakes. It has been well known for at least 25 years what that perv was doing. Everyone turned a blind eye until it was made public.Now they all come out and tell us how surprised and disgusted they are. Actors are the most useless people on the planet. Got the shits? Call a doctor. Leaky tap? Call a plumber. Dodgy hair? Call a hair dresser. Persistent boner? Call a hooker. There is no possible scenario that could occur in everyday life which would require you needing an actor. They're fucking useless.
is seth macfarlen a comedian.
Emma stone is gorgeous
Seth MacFarlane = Dillion Harper
Good
SMH
GOOD ONE, SETH MacFARLANE!!!! #LOL
All go checkout my channel :)
Hahahaha yeah dude, he knew man, he sure showed Harvey! hahahaha\n\nPure idiocy.
yikes
damn
Oh boy
I'll suck Harvey's dick for an oscar
Lol i drink fluoride aswell.
Weinstein is a victim of Jewish Hollywood infighting,he must of upset some powerful members of his Tribe and they are simply settling scores.
Ooooooh
*Emma Stone looked like she wanted to laugh at the dig but still had to be careful for her career...* What a vile industry!
He Knew
That was really funny
They knew Harvey was a perv but nobody dared do anything
Wow
The Chosen People had to much Shekels
I think I am starting to finally get that Family Guy scene where Peter takes Stewie to Disney World and Stewie gets captured by the “it’s a small world” ride people and made to in there as a slave with the other children from around the world. I had no clue at the time what the scene was about until I saw it again at a friends house here over the weekend. Jeezo, we spoke about it and prayed that we are still just guessing at its meaning, but the scene now seems creepy second time around ....
I blame the woman...if she is not a whore.. .. just say fuck off Harvey im not doing your shity movie...simple as that
So Seth McFarlane like most of Hollywood knew this was going on and instead of using his power and influence to do something instead  made a cheep in joke about it at a ceremony. What a fucking hack piece of shit douche bag
hey that guy sounds like the dog off family guy hohoho
I will fight sexual abuse with women every step of the way but women have to do their part as well. First start off by NOT wearing yoga pants 365 days a year everywhere - to hospitals, schools, stores, out and about. The crutch of freedom of expression and comfort has been broken, you cannot tell me you will walk out in public wearing white/grey/tan/green yoga pants with your cameltoe hanging in broad daylight and tell me you are doing it for comfort and NOT for attention. Start respecting yourself before expecting others to respect you. A grown fucking woman should know better!
I'm glad that Seth took a swing at Weinstein and can see in his facial expression the disgust he has for him.
Seth knew the audience would laugh at that statement and his reaction to them laughing is to almost laugh but to feel completely disgusted also.
It's been an open secret for some time now.
U guys should watch open secret documentary...Harvey is harmless compare to these guys
I'll rape dat
Called him out; or knew and didnt say anything about it publicly -.-? Just saying.
Everybody knows it too.
I love how even in low light you can see that Nic has really beautiful and well taken care of skin, not just throwing some moisturizer on like most gurus who sctually have awful skin without their 1000 watt, full coverage and filter trickery.
How do you keep your skin soooo smooth and youthful?
NARS  would be my pick especially as it relates to dry skin
Pls review hudabeaty cos I feel she’s overhyped. Swatched her palette and it was so disappointing
PLEASE can you guys do a review on THE ORDINARY FOUNDATION & the GLOSSIER  products xxxxxxxx ❤️❤️❤️
You should do a review of some of Storybook Cosmetics products!
Would you review Kevyn Aucoin if you haven't already?
This was great Nic, you gave a thorough and fair review. I love that you roadtested the products for a day before. I'd like to see you review Makeup Revolution, I love their gold chocolate bar eyeshadow palette, their double ended eye liner pen and the palette they did with British Beauty Blogger. Thanks. Xx
I love this channel and you girls are amazing, but that contour looks terrible, it's like thick patches of dirt.
Love this review Nic! Really useful. Thanks :) also, may be a really stupid question, but how do you work out your skin tone? I always struggle matching foundation. I don't know if my skin is warm, cool, yellow or pink undertones etc. And different make up stands tell me different things! Thanks xx
This was a fantastic overview--I was laughing at the sheer volume of products that you managed to slap on but it was great to see them all in action!♥
Great review as always, please can you do NYX thanks xxxx
A video using several Clinique products would be great. I rarely ever see videos with their products included, and I'd love to know which of their non-foundation products are good!
Would love love love a tarte review
Yes!!! Thank you for being one of the few people who used these products to their full potential. I love that you weren’t limiting the product to one specific use but you used your creativity to use the products the way you wanted. Love this!!
Like that you take the time to play and understand how work the products before you show to us ;)
I have oily skin and this foundation broke me out really badly. I loved the finish and how it wore on my skin but I cannot use it. Does anyone have the same problem with the foundation?
Hi Nic, Thank you for the awesome review. So much hype on this one that it became so confusing... Btw, can I request you for a review of Huda Beauty's new foundation lines? Thanks a lot!
Pray the rosary everyday and quit the vanities of the world, because the world is passing away and the life of the soul is what is everlasting
love your take on makeup. told myself I wouldn't watch anymore fenty reviews but had to watch yours because I knew you would have a unique stance
Love you and your videos!! Would love to see you do a Bobbi Brown review xx
Eeeeeeeeeeeek. So jealous jealous jealous. I ,over her products. U look absolutely stunning. I loooooooved the eye makeup.the stick blush kinda thing and  the lip gloss. But all too expensive. But absolutely amazing makeup . Absolutely love u nic. ❤️❤️💕💕💕💋💋💋💋🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Love the lipgloss and the eye colours, however am not a huge fan of the base xx
Nic could you do a Fall/Autumn makeup routine video 😙 Love your videos!!
I would love to see a review on Kjaer Weis or RMS Beauty! xx
please review the ordinary serum and coverage foundations!
You girls are beautiful inside & out.
I'm obsessed with this look, stunning make up as always. ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Hi Nic - I know you ladies tend to review/use more high end brands (not a criticism) but I was wondering if you would review the Primark range. X
To me the foundation matches your skin tho
I got the gloss and it just looks like clear gloss on me. The pretty color...disappears.😢
honoring the men in makeup too! Thanks Nic so much, this means so much to someone like me. much love from Orlando! xoxo
Nic - I'd love to see reviews on all of the upcoming Holiday collections!!!!
This is my favorite review of this brand!
one of the most adventurous full fenty beauty looks i've seen! i think the glowy, natural-looking look most people create with these products are lovely, but you really used her products in the versatile way that rihanna wanted. and you did it really well!
Jesus Christ, that’s horrible 😂 She looks absolutely fine, but that over the top makeup is just too much. Sorry guys, but is it just me?
Really like the Brand reviews n seeing all the products used
You should do a review on Jeffree Star cosmetics! The brands Vegan I believe and available on Beauty Bay
Her hairline goes way back like the 1980's
The lighting was so much better in this video! :)\n\nAlso great review :) x
Best review of Fenty I've seen! Love the unique ways you used the products.
I have always loved you!!! Been a subscriber to your channel since your PixiCut hair days! But I love more how excited you get when you show in the products that would look great for darker skin. ❤️
I have to be honest, the contour looked very muddy! Maybe it was because of the lighting? Other than that, the cheeks and eyes looked gorgeous
its 2k 17 \ni cant recognize humans any more
Wasn't she menta shake the foundation first
I wanted to comment on how this has been the best review of the Fenty Beauty line, but everybody has already said it. This is why I've trusted Sam and Nic for years now. Their videos are so informative that they have helped me pick which MAC, Estee Lauder, and Clinique foundations would suit my skin type. Moreover, their reviews are so positive, it's always pleasing to watch them.
I wanted to love the foundation but it sank right into my pores with and without a primer. Good thing I only got a sample.
Would love a review on jefree star products. Thanks x
Out of all the Fenty Beauty reviews I have seen... I feel you were the most honest and transparent... but you guys always are.  💟  This was super informative... Thank u.  Well done!!
Love what you did here 🙌🏼❤️❤️ showing the versatile usage really helped me 😊
I think it's great that you did a full face using the highlighters as eyeshadow! Clever!
Love that you used Trophy Wife as an eyeshadow, and not a highlighter like other light skinned girls have done on Youtube.
Love this look so much!! 👌🏼
Would be great if you did an update skin care video. ☺
Any time you like something I just want to run out and buy it haha! I would love to see you review an affordable brand like Sleek or Nyx please, for those of us who need to rely on cheaper products most of the time...
I love that she didn't just gush over Rihanna for being Rihanna. I'd like to try the matchsticks!!
What colour foundation did you go for Nic?
I LOVE the lighting here!! I am so tired of overly bright videos that everyone else does. xx :)
I love the look you did with it. I haven't seen anyone else use the highlighters as eyeshadow or lipstick
I like the way you do makeup - I don't understand contouring the forehead though.  It just looks like everyone has a dirty forehead.  You don't of course.
The foundation made me break out in little red spots (not pimples/active acne, almost like an allergic reaction as opposed to a breakout) but I really liked the way it looks when mixed with a luminous foundation for my dry skin - I used Koh Gen Do Aqua and the two seemed to play nicely together. If anyone's bought the foundation but has dry skin and finds it isn't working but also own a liquidy dewy foundation try mixing the two!
I have really dry skin and the formulas just did not work for me. I got the foundation as soon as it was released because of the color selection. I have a strong yellow undertone that is hard for me to match. The foundation and primer just made my skin look even dryer. I looked like I had more texture then I actually have.
Celebrity make up . I shall pass
Please review Le Mètier de Beautè. I am very curious on your feedback for a high end brand.
Thank you for always including us darker skin girls in your reviews and recommendations.
I'd like to see a tutorial on Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes.
Fantastic review Nic! Always enjoy listening to your honest thoughts and loved the look💗
Looks great nic.  Would love your opinion on Glossier.
I love but please cut down on the Botox your eyebrows didn't move the whole video!
Could you do a nyx review/tutorial.  I have not used there stuff but have heard good things about it. Also I have extremely pale skin with really dark under eyes. What would you do with that as I have never found a concealer good enough? I love your video. I like how real you are. Keep it up.
This is by far the best review of Fenty Beauty that I have seen so far. 👏🏼
I wasn't sure when I saw it at Sephora last week, but now I want absolutely everything in this range! My poor, poor bank account! lol Thanks for the review, Nic!
Thanks for the review Nic, I love how you showed the versatility of the products unlike the rest of the video reviews.
You're 37 ?! Wow, that's goals aha x
Great review,\nCould you review the Claudia Schiffer’s ?\nThx
This video showed me how much lighting & editing make a difference in makeup videos....the line doesnt seem that great without heavy editing?
I would love to see a review of the new Pat McGrath Labs shadows and liners!
Omg! I looooove this look!
Awesome review
love
Best review so far
Do you still use Lilash?
I thought you said 'ginger minge' 😂😂
CT please!!
Do NYX!!!!!
Best tutorial of fenty beauty. Thanks Nic
that finishing powder.... wow!
NARS would be great! Please please!
Please review Milani
Love the lighting
What moisturiser did you use?
37??? you look great!
Your right side looks fantastic!
Please review Dolce & Gabbana makeup! Thank you!
while tension male wbrozx conviction seemingly fish touch start overall.
To me sound very aggressive here, you can speak softer. Feels exhausting to listen sometimes. Still loved the content :-)
I watched this feeling like I learnt so many new things!
You knew you’d be applauded for making special mention of men and makeup. Nothing is stopping men from wearing makeup. I came here like most, to relax and watch a makeup tutorial. Instead it’s like everywhere else you turn- politically charged and obsessed with political correctness at every point where it can be mentioned.
Would love to know what you think about the new Nars Luminous weightless foundation and how best to apply it!

Honestly glad he knows why some are killed by cops, many people think that it's from blind hate. He actually knows that the hood is a place where you're trapped and convinced to do all these crazy things which might lead to death or someone else's. Preach 21 preach
Finally someone that speaks there mind this shit is fire I love this song
when 21 thinks hes in future's blood on the money video lmfaoooo
Hands up don’t shoot was fake tho😂. The guy charged the cop
Best song I ever heard from him!🔥🔥🔥💡🌟
One of 21’s best songs by far
the message touch my soul!
but this is something new ;]
He speaking about real shit
21 would've probably been in that casket by now but he choose the pen and paper
If you dislike you r actually a peice of shit
How is Trump openly racist?\nNotice how he actually used an example for Hillary
Who's here before it get's hella views
sad story and very good video! :(
anyone else think the reporter look like amber
This shit deep as fuck
I fucks with 21 took a lil time but I give him his props
Anyone who ain't feeling this song ain't got NO HEART .
The US is nothing special.
Im a rapper from Grand Rapids Mi Check Me Out Asap I drop new continent daily !!! 💯🎤🎧🎥
Top 1 Music on youtube !
Bet you didn’t know this, cops DONT shoot kids that have there hands up. You got to be a special kind of stupid to think that they do.
He a real one yo was never a big fan of him until I heard this song
That was DOPE  im happy they helping us with the issue...
AXLE IS A BLOATED SHADOW OF HIMSELF, AND THE BAND IS SLOPPY. SELLING A FADED DREAM OF DAYS GONE BYE NOW IS ALL!!
Damn Axl go on a diet and lose weight. You will look fkn amazing then. GnR 4ever!
I love P!nk's voice.
Neil Young was right.
What is it with middle age musicians (they’re not stars) and their inability to not dress like a 16yr old punk kid?
Guns N' Roses' latest chapter in their how to destroy your legacy book
Glad I got angus young as special guest!
Axl and P!nk, both in their prime, at the same time, that would have been a historic duet!!!
Pink Fucken sucks another  band letting there music get fucked up by these absolutely shit pop stars
I’m so glad Axl doesn’t sound the way he did from 2010-2015. It was like a mixture of a really drunk Willie Nelson and Mickey Mouse on a bad acid-trip. Slash murdered this shit as always! I saw them 3 times last year and I loved every show!
That was pretty cool!
Another video to add to my P!nk collection!
Pink has some records to sell to those middle aged fans out there..give credit to her agent for showing up with Mickey Rourke for 30 seconds\n*LAME* sell-outs
😁 Wish Trump would have walked out and said I told you peeps that is all you need. 😁
it' s true love :)
Honestly, they sound better with Pink. That's exactly what they need. She can really hit those high notes, and she sounds very strong, aggressive, soulful. She has stage presence, looks kinda badass, and doesn't mind running around half naked. That's exactly what Guns n' Roses needs right now, to make up for Axl losing a step. If Pink came out in leather with her tits out, hitting all those high notes, nobody would notice Axl being old and fat.
I respect pink but as far as guns and roses I'll refer to Jason newsteads..opinion. Show up on stage on time. Don't make a habit of starting the show 2 hours late that's disrespectful to your fans and road crew. I'd never pay to see them live.
She's so out of time; very annoying. She's got a great voice, but this was a disappointing watch...at least for me.
I know the world has changed, musical tastes too, but man... They had lots of talent. GnR were a one of a kind.
Totally boring till pink arrived
no way thats Axl Rose
How beautiful! !!
She sounds like crap...omg
muito bom
WOW!!!!!!\n\nLove this!
i ship them
She sucks.
Vc faz um favor em continuar cantando AXL velhas canções Novas emoções. ....♥♥.
Was at that  show, all good but alllll Slash. Something must of happened to Axl cause he kept running backstage , taking long breaks and having Slash solo a loooot. Overall great show though.
Rock is for the young...This is embarrassing.
Axl needs to lose some weight!. yeah he is 55 or whatever but thats no excuse to not hit the gym and lay off junk food
That moment when you realise your guest sings your song better than you......
Pink SLAMS Rose with just a few seconds Lol! \nBTW that final scream from Rose seems like the sound of a dying chicken! Fuckin awful!
Axl still has the pipes!! LEGEND!!
Slash still looks hot under that hat, hair and shades
Love it.  Axl is clearly whistling with a backing track, but it'd be impossible to pull that off ive every night.
Great video quality! What camera did you use?
Welp...... my life is now complete
Wow what's on his waist ??trash bags?? love the group but why the shaggy stuff hanging??? They still sound AWESOME!!
This band sucks.  Axl Rose is a complete tool bag.  And Pink??  WTF?  Real badasses!  Your street cred is gone.
What camera are you using to take the vid? Great quality for how zoomed in it was.
Thank you for sharing. You've got an excellent camera, what is it?
I had such an awesome time at the concert last night 🤙🏼☠️ sickkkkkk
I hope the it ain’t easy guy keeps his desire for a drug free life. Lots of temptation.
pinks voice works so well with the singer's voice
that was kool man

Why are the guitars so high in treble..it hurts the ears
Lol..He is so bad pink had to stop singing so she wouldn't show him up
Which is pink a nd which is axle
Damn axl even whistle like Mickey Mouse. Welcome to Disneyland city where the voice is lost and the vocal chords are ruined. ....
Damn, sure Axl ate a fucking lot of halal food outside the msg
Sorry.. it would have been the best if axl sang the whole thing. I mean pink did ok but the song is axl's.
So many wasted years with Gnr glad to see axel finally came around
Agh 💕 much to love to axl rose 💕💕 saw there this past summer and never rock n rolled so hard in my life 💕💕
Dam, Axl has gotten a fat belly. Guess we all get a little older and thicker around the waistline. Lol
Omg. At least pink can still sing. Axle sounds like shit. Maybe thats why it took so long to get the balz to try again. Original GnR was the best.
at least PINK can sing--damn guns did you forget how to use the vocals??
GnR was a great band. 20yrs ago. 💛
It seems for her, was a dream come true ...
Shame.... I grew up with this band when they were the hottest thing going...Axl Rose looks like a tele tubby and should just sit down
Great as usual. Never disappoint
I can not love this enough
I love you Pink
Yea she was always a huge fan! Good for her man!
Até que ele se tornou um senhorzinho simpático depois de sequestrar o Axl Rose ... Rsrs \n\nBrincadeiras a parte, o vídeo ficou mto bom !!
My favorite band back when. Miss those days
She said stuck in the ground should be stuck in the crowd but overall she sounded great.I'm technical is all so don't mind me.😉
Awesome!
P!nk kicks ass! 🤘
Makes scott weiland one even better..someone lock axl up
axl rose changed a lot
Que desastre la gorda
what dreary tripe!

Sou super, hiper, ultra, mega Fã Zaço!
She is amazing
Get back to the moulin rogue where ya belong. G&R does just fine without u
lets face it . .she didn't exactly do a lot did she . .what was the point ?
*_THANK GOD, that Axl Rose isn't a douchebag Trump supporter._*
pink messed that one up
damn pink is fatter and uglier than usual
Reminds me of my husband on our wedding day, I cried too.
Should’ve disabled comments
The kid looks so confused.
This is so sweet :,)
n'awww adorable
This is the one time that I approve disabling comments
I wish I had a boyfriend who would look at me like that
When the waiter finally comes with my food
Is that Rochelle's son Jordan?
i'd like to see this guy on a game show
I want to be this in love...
I cried too, but I was crying because i thought my life is over I’m officially her prisoner 😂
Lovely video but just you wait and he will find she was boinking the best man all along because he too emotional lmao
Black bitch
Beautiful 💗
He's crying because he can't get a refund on that atrocious singer they hired.
he's crying because he knows that tonight he's gonna have to stick his dick in that hippo
Black people are so dramatic.
Little boy going damm what a bitch, stahp this is embarassing.
What a fag!
I'll play this on loop till the new film comes out.  I don't care Sacred Bones Records buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
Is this the oficial theme of the new movie? looks very creepy
Hell nah ! \nSo thought this was going to be dope but it’s not that great \nY can’t original shit just be left unduplicated & undisturbed 😒🤔🙄
Awful. Simply pathetic. They butchered it. Big fan of NIN but this was simply a quick cash in attempt by NIN. Word of advice mr. Reznor: stay away from covering classics and stick to original songs.
I heard the original back when I was 9. Trent is a genius, but nothing can re-capture that terror. I heard John Carpenter came up with it. Talk about talent; he tapped into my fear center when I was a kid. Now; now I'm more worried about insane drivers during my commute. Carelessness is far more terrifying than evil.
This is it. This is the Halloween song I will remember.
Get serious and remix some Silent Hill jams, RezRoss...
Sorry, but that first time the piano kicks in is just a piss take.
Wait.  This is coming out?! Cool!
Oh wow. I love how they stuck to the original then threw in some modern beats. Yes! Love it! Awesome.
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is the best version of this theme, i've ever heard.  Somehow i just KNEW IT WOULD BE.
Trent needs to do In The Mouth of Madness
That Le Matos version tho... (look it up. I can wait)
I hope to god this gets used in the new film.
8:30pm alone in school , puts headphones, turns volume all the way up = A little piece of terrror gets proyected in the mind :)
I like how it incorporates rhythms from the piece Myers House from the original soundtrack
I feel like there was more to Micheal Myers than we know\nLike I think maybe he survived literally everything for a reason\nI think a part of him wasn’t human
pretty sick\nthanks for the upload
Garbage compared to the original
I guess I’m gonna be this guy, but I really don’t like this. The strange pizzicato lead part just rubs me the wrong way; the highest note of each phrase sounds too flat. And most of it’s just “spooky” ambient noise. It ends up sounding like a twisted remix of the original.
Is this for the new film? And is this a reboot?
i approve of this message
This is pretty terrible
Please don't fuck this up!
Hey guys! You guys think yall help me to get me to 500 sub's? I'll be subscribing back to everyone who comments DONE! My channel consists of vlogs, song covers, and my own originals! Enjoy if you choose to do so! 😄
Subscribe to Colin flaherty the truth ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️the FBI numbers are out
Well the film will be rehashed shit but at least we got this out of it.
Meh . I didn’t hate it but I didn’t love it either . It’s just meh
I feel that if done correctly, you can make a genuine horror movie that will make you scream and jump, but with music just like this. I envision that around 2:00 is when we know that Michael is near but we, just as the main character, do not know where, until the second the music hits 2:09 and she sees him and screams but you hear nothing but the song, before she continues to scream and run.
Finally something I can fall asleep too
Who would be the ideal director for the next one?\n\nMy votes either Darren Aronofsky or Nicolas Winding Refn
This Halloween Michael Myers is coming home Laurie Strode is coming home for the very last time to finally  kill Michael Myers once and for all can't wait to see the new Halloween 2018 can't wait
Master of the ambient background noise
Nothing like perfection! Anything Trent touched is a masterpiece....especially when they work together. Fucking love this! Reznor and Atticus forever!🖤🖤🖤🖤
Trent Reznor came thru with the jams this Halloween 🎃
🖖 I'm slowly peeking with one eye.
Amazing additions to a classic! Love it.
350 people do not know genius when they hear it.
20+ years later and that  parts that starts at 2:10 still makes me shiver. Love it!
So will there be a laurie's theme too? It's my favorite.
The ending part is dope! Should be longer.
I expected more, but this is good.
now this is scary! Love it.
I've been a fan of nine inch nails, have to say this is fuckin awesome!
The blackest eyes, the devil's eyes...
Is this is going to be in the upcoming sequel? I heard that a new Halloween project is coming next year so I'm expecting greater things.
It's $ P 00 K Y  S E A S O N
Nothing beats the original
With Trent and Atticus, of course it's brilliant.... ❤👌
What a shit show. This isn't even as good and powerful as the original theme and it's a nutless rendition that's bordering on elevator music. Hard fail, for fanboys only.
I KNEW when I saw Trent's name on it, it would be freaking amazing!!!
I heard good things. Will post my reaction after I watch
The most remarkable thing they captured was the dissonance of the original score.  I'm sure the low budget and technology at the time prevented Carpenter from editing the music properly, which created flawed, out of pitch notes which, coincidentally enough, added to the sense of unease that the movie imbued within the viewer.  To capture that essence of imperfection shows how much love and dedication they put into this rendition.
Ehhhhhhhhhh......... These guys ripped off that Lincoln Park song!
Secret Chiefs 3 does a fantastic rock version of this.
Did anyone else have sort of an ear shutter in the last few seconds? For me it seems to happen when music gets so chaotic, and then suddenly calm. It's so strange that music can trigger something physiological and involuntary.
How the fuck do they do THIS?!!
This is  as good as the outcast themes
I wonder what Profondo Rosso (the original) would sound like?
This must be what it's like inside Michael's head😶
wasn't sure at first but i dig
I need this on vinyl..Maxi 12 or 7
So much better than the original. The original was ok but this proves that adding a whole bunch of stuff could improve it. I like Halloween. Hopefully they'll remake the original movie and just add stuff to make it better. I like stuff that makes old stuff better.
Halloween The Game: Sega Genesis
Is this official for the new one ??
this is super Impressive it makes me wonder what Trent version of a Halloween remake would be since Rob Zombie is such a white trash hack and damaged Halloween to the point of no return....... 
Music begins at 0:42
Brilliant mix
🤘🇺🇸🤘
This is good
Needs mo' Busta Rhymes fist fighting Michael 3/10
....Then Metro Boomin hops on the beat lol
Trent Reznor + Halloween = Sex
Oh no haha

Do zendaya
I LOST it at the Mom's Upsetti song\nKeeping Up Appearances?!?! NICE she watches the bucket woman XDDDDd
She had me at the whistle, man I wish I could do that!
I think I’m in love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the droid attack on the Wookiees?
I have the same hair cut but how do I style my hair like this? 💞
Looks like one of this pornhub vids
Just saying that if an actor/actress spoils a movie before it comes out they get fired, she didn't actually tell him anything
73 questions with Larry David. Please.
Are you a man or a woman?
She´s so beautifull.  Natural, not like the sluts these days.
So giroud has succeeded in attracting all top ladies towards Arsenal! Lets applaud for his only achievement!
This is by far the best video on Vogue. It was a free flowing, very well prepared interview.
Damn right it's football
Jesus she's so beautiful
She reminds me of the lovely Audrey Hepburn
Having her as a wife would be mission complete marked on my life
He should've jumped off that balcony!
I'm in love. She's perfect. When she corrected him (*football), I was blown away.
Honestly, I began watching this thinking it would represent the stars in a realistic way...but this is SOOOO fake it makes me cringe.\nIt's so obviously scripted, it just comes out as artificial.\n\nSorry, maybe I didn't know what I was getting into, but I won't be watching more of these, thanks.
Star Wars: The Last Porno
How the fuck did I know the song would be Lose Yourself before she sang it? Maybe because it's also the only song I'll always know from start to finish, but shit that was creepy and cute at the same time
she s amazing she will become better than jennifer lawrence and most of the actress of the moment
it'd be soo dope if there's a 73 questions with Millie Bobby Brown!
She had me until Arsenal......... COYS!\n\n...... Let's be honest, she still has me though.
DAISY IS AMAZING, I AM IN LOVE
Plz 73 questions with the rock
That lady on the phone just lost her job
I'VE FINALLY FOUND ANOTHER PERSON WHO LIKES MARMITE YESSSSS
I SWEAR TO GOD LOSE YOURSELF IS ALSO THE SONG I KNOW ALL THE LYRICS TO AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE STARTED SINGING. SWEEEEAAARRRR TO GOD.
She is so pretty.......im crying
Love/ Hate relationship with watching these because we love them too much!
I really hate when she got bleeped out in the end OMFG!!!
She is completely boobless. Couldn't even see a hint of a bump coming from under that dress :(
i’m in love with her until she said she supported arsenal
Anyone knows any pornstar that looks like Daisy Ridley? A fap session is due......
Wow, look at this view 'focuses on daisy'
The format of these videos is cringeworthy in the extreme, the most faux staged unnatural interviews you will ever come across. Just horrendously American.
When he asked what movie made her laugh the hardest, I instantly thought in my mind Spy!
Who is Daisy Ridley would be the first question
As a Welshman I'm always strangely subservient to an English rose as beautiful as her
She was scared of IT......I feel a meme awakening
Okay, Daisy would have been an amazing Lara Croft wtf why isn't she playing her?!?!
Question #1 can I stare at you for a second.
yes she referenced 2 pints of lager and a packet of crisps
0:05 “no I don’t want to buy anything, fuck off.”\n\n0:07 *Slams door*\n\n0:08 interview ends.
She’s adorable

Bleeps everything but the f-bomb
#WENGER OUT
She is so adorable!!!
I love her
She is the greatest human to ever exist.
MARY SUE CANT LIFT THE PRODUCTION BAGS !!
That does not look scripted at all!
How they can answer so quick and directly to every answer? It's scripted? \nIf some one ask me those kind of questions the interview will last forever and most of my answer will be vague.
i love her so much
Was that Karrn Gillan on the phone?!??
even doe she doesn't have boobs. But her pussy will do!
73 questions with Millie Bobby brown
Why does the beginning look like the start to a porno 👀
Okay she's hot, beautifull, fucking strong what else? I'm in love
She was cute until she started belching out Little Marshalls foolishness.
I looovveee heerrrrrr 😍
I am CRUSHING!
Marry me already!
Daisy Ridley 2020
MARY SUEEEEEEEEEEEEE FUCK OFF CUUUUNT
Sounds fake
she has zero boobs
The girl on the phone was Sophie Turner who play's Sansa Stark on Game of Thrones.
anyone else get a porn vibe
The bleeps at the end make it sound like Last Jedi is just one big Star Wars orgy
I love that she doesnt give a fuck about her broken phone screen lol
She's a gooner - perfect
I Love her. coolest woman ever.
I think my heart had a flutter for the first time in years. she is amaaaaazing :D.
Add my channel 🤣

Bruh Mr. Robot isn't even in Netflix

Flat
Id smash
Holy moly I saw her ankle
She need a boob job
The Force just awakened....

Spoiler alert

Why people are saying shes super beautifull?look at her body she has manly body look at her shoulders and back muscle lol
holy shit daisy rapping em made my fucking life
Who is the most nervous Natalie Portman Keira Knightley Or Daisy Ridley??

She is perfect.
7:37 her cellphone habits are quite peculiar
73 questions with Demi lovato

Feels like its trying not to be rehearsed but it is so its unauthentic.
Queria meter a mão nessas coisas aí
Some kind of visual ASML.
That purple/lilac slime was pure porn
I just got slimed...
This video could have been REALLY satisfying... BUT... dirty fingernails everywhere distracted me from the colors.
I'm curious, who was the slime artist who made all of this lovely slime? :)\n\nbecause you probably have to be a molecular physicist to make that sort of thing,\n\nand there aren't a lot of those around.\n\nWas David Hanson involved???
Oddly satisfying
He slimed me

Mello Gold was pure genius. Who kidnapped that guy? Usually I can follow an artist and appreciate changes in their style, but Beck lost me. I have honestly tried.
my daughter has a sensory thing. She has been creating various slime, goo and bead combinations for years -
1st minute: Oooh.. slime visualiser... Seems good...\n2nd minute: This is quite different from what I've heard from Beck before\n3rd minute: ok, this is getting a little weird.. what am I even watching? What am I doing with my life?\n4th minute: might as well wait for it to finish, even though it's not that interesting anymore
beck is fucking great at following trends
[TOXIC DO NOT INGEST]
This is fucking smart
90' artist...
Burn this video
4:03 yellow slime looks too much like human fat yuckerds
Is beck trying too hard to be 6th graders? Whatever because this song is great
Find my way through the lost jizz...
This is absolutely GREAT 80's music.
Man that chorus 1:03
This video made me slime,i mean,smile
Is this seriously the official video
This song does nothing for me.
I 'will love to eat this video !
what is a beck
ASMR
Beck is back.
i busted a nut
es muy....muy placentero verlo
muito bom
B-52s
This is my fetish.
This almost qualifies as visual-tactile synaesthesia.
So satisfying.. so hypnotizing
3:28 widest panned drums! Such a fine piece over all.
Manual work for an original clip :)
In which Beck showcases his daughter's awesome slime collection with an awesome soundtrack.
I LOVE this song! Kinda sounds like Beck has been listening to Justice lately...
r/oddlysatisfying
Honestly this is so aesthetically pleasing. My favourite is the plain purple slime! My friend who knows I like goop linked it to me, and then I heard it on BBC Radio 1 when Beck came on - this has a lot of replayability IMO!! Great song!!
this slime looks so cancer causing :O
mmmmm
Unicorn cum!
OMG😂😂😂
soy un pededor?
ssss
anyone got tabssssssss$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Cool
Boring

Hidden treasure right here.
I love Beck, But this is not for me
this guy's a fuckin genius
Reminds me a lot of Animal Collective.
i need to hear Beck ft. Calvin Harris
I wish people made slime videos like this ;-;.
what's next, fidget spinners?\nI'd probably still like it tho.
There's no such thing as good acid but I'm glad someone still doing it
This is some high grade slime
Like an 80’s and 90’s fusion. On repeat all day

Beck THIS SONG!!!!! You're so incredibly talented
I'm a 62 yr old dude and I've loved Beck since I first heard him in '94.  Best musical phenom since The BeaTles.
BECK IS SO COOL his vids keep getting better and better
Beck just saved the year with some others
A couple months late but ok
As a mom, i just cant escape slime...in the house, on the couch, in the garage, baggies of it, cups of it....now on my Beck video lol
I need to make slime right now (I love this song)
wow, i can't believe this is still the same guy who did Mellow Gold, Still a loser, baby to me, this new stuff is way poppy
The purple one is the most satisfying.
no man, le re chupo la pija a tu imaginacion
I need to see the live version of this!
Get out of my feed
Anyone else getting animal collective vibes from the vocals?
If there's a nontoxic version to imitate, kids with autism would be in heaven to see this.
I feel the strange urge to squeeze boobies... nah forget it I feel it all the time
This is an odd thought, but I'm personally concerned about the environmental impact of this craft trend. It is as bad as plastic and has numerous ways it can kill wildlife.
The is Dr. Squish's dream vid
That is one hell of a hook.
Really slime omg this is so cool
Welcome back beck. This album is so much better then the last two.
If this is the actual music vid the slime has taken over
With this and his other new stuff Beck is pushing out a brilliant, feel-good vibe. Smile, sing, dance.
Song’s addicting, won’t come out of my head
i wanna eat some of dat yummy stuff and die
All of these hands are white... smh
Wow, video quality is so bad. Even at 1080p it feels too much compressed and there's so much noise in it.
It was just a prank, -Han- Woody!
I wish I still had YouTube red!!!Because I love the first one!
That actress is in quite a few things but i know her most from SuperStore
Gavin running into the skeleton in the first Lazer Team was the hardest I've laughed at anything in my life
Bet Gavin is the bad guy or his the one they rescue...
Nicole Bloom who plays Amanda from Shameless. Yes, she is topless in that show. You're welcome.
Only issue right off the bat is I feel like Gavin isn't going to be in much of the movie, and Gavin is one of my favorite parts of the first movie so I'm really not sure how to feel about this trailer
Wait it's coming out next month? Now I'm excited.
Still haven't even seen the first one
They must have won the tournament I guess
Would love to watch if Canada had Youtube Red
For some reason I can't be excited for this idk why
From the thumbnail I was worried they cast Lindsey as the scientist.  thank god it didn't happen.
I am really happy this is coming out soon! way to go RT, I'll see you in theaters next month
So this is it, huh, we're some kind of Lazer Team?
is that amanda from shameless?
I'll be honest, I REALLY liked the first movie and I'm looking forward to this one. Maybe it's the fanboy in me talking, IDK.
I feel there going to scale back on the sequel. But I'm still excited. The dynamic between the team and the scientist might be interesting.
*when Gavin is taken* YOU BASTARDS
Jesus wait, I haven’t even seen the first one yet...I want to if you wanted to know
I have yet to see the first one, and you're already bringing out a second. Bravo, dudes and dudettes - bravo!
...I see the writing is still clever.
first one was meh, but I liked it just cause of burnie, michael, and gavin...this one looks meh, but I will watch it cause of burnie, michael, and gavin
*AND YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY EXTRA PLUTONIUM?*
I hope the dialog volume is a bit higher in the movie than in the trailer, some of the texts were hard to make out.
all aboard to the HYPE Train!
IS THIS ONE PLAYING AT TORONTO AFTER DARK TOO???
Reviews for the first one weren’t good, because people never watched roosterteeth, the jokes were great and I loved it, this looks even better
I'm a bit disappointed that it isn't La2er Team
How long before It's not a DeLorean! becomes a shirt?
I can see that the writing hasn't really improved much...\n(JK, I love you guys)
Oh God, does this mean every single RT video is going to start with the teaser This video brought to you by the new movie Laser Team 2. Coming November 22?
Lazer Team is slowly becoming SuperStore. Can't wait for Dina to be in Lazer Team 3.
aye they got emily from until dawn
im so happy right now!!!!
I bet it's actually a DeLorean.
Why is Gavin/Woody not in that thumbnail?
Is that Emily from Until Dawn?
This one looks wayyyyyyyy better then the first one
I can't wait!
Can anyone please tell me the name of the song playing? It's so goofy I need it.
What is it with Rooster Teeth and rifts
How come this community doesn't understand jokes or sarcasm?\nThat's all this channel is
I really do hope it's better than the first one.
change the name to razor team and slit your wrists..
Gavin couldn't film because he was in Britain the whole time The Movie
Didn't they lose like $800,000 on the first Lazer Team? Hope you can pull it off with the sequel Rooster Teeth...
I legit just watched lazer team again before i saw this! We doing a fund for this one too?
Anyone wander why this is on trending with 200k views and h3s video with 10mil in one day wasn't... YouTube there's other ways of advertising! Which are fairer too
Is that emily from until dawn? if it is and you didn't make a joke aout the butterfly effect i will be disappointed.
They got that one girl from shameless.
This and the first Lazer Team are the main reasons why I have my YouTube Red account. I'm so hyped!
Really hope this is rated R...
I feel bad about Gavin, he is poor when he got stuck across the galaxy, but I like the girl's hairstyle.\n👏🏻🖖🏻👌🏻👍🏻✌🏻️😃
End of lazer team 1: \n*Ice cube's voice*\nyall motherf*ckers is going to space
If there isn't a Delorean in this film, so help me....
THU CUT OFF HIS HEAD\nYOU KILLED HIM
Cant wait to see that sweet sweet Delorean
Amazing also I feel like Michael just plays himself in these movies
Lol Gavin is lost! That makes so much sense!
I think I'm more excited for this one because now I know what I'm getting myself into lol
With each Lazer Team movie, we slowly replace all the original cast with the Superstore cast
I hate to say it, but i'm kind of surprised there doing another one after the last one did so poorly.
Lazer Team 2: The movie the community wasn't really clamoring for but I guess we'll still watch it anyways and at least we don't have to crowd fund it this time so that's a plus
I love this studio...
TBS or Adult Swim will likely air this after AT&T complete the acquisition of Time Warner. RT is co-owned by AT&T. Bring It On! (I have go to watch the first one though).
There are jokes here about Gavin still never being at work, and Across the Galaxy is really just across the ocean in jolly ol' England
Is that Emily from Until Dawn? It looks like her
nice gavins gonna be present for 5% of the movie just like how hes present 5% of the time already
i predict strong 5 out of 10. watchable
Lazer team 2: Electric Boogaloo
Yayyyyy
Lazer Team 2: Strangerer Things
IS ThAt Max
It's not Delorian!
oh no
will dis be on da Netflix
Yayyyyyyyyyy
This looks good
Beutumis
Haha haha so funny
Oh yes
Lazer team X
Can't Wait!!!!!
Ew
I'm excited
ITS NOT A DELOREAN!
NO GAVINOOFREEEEEEE unsub
No. No. NOO. NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Laze team 2 =  Big hero 6
Ahhhh!!!! Yes!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Woo!  (•̀o•́)ง
lol
I CANT FREAKIN WAIT!!!!
Hot garbage 2: dumpster fire
Lazer Team 2: Git Lazerer.
Lazer Team 2: Finding Free-mo
Looks good
This is going to be a fail
I dont think it's an accident that they are close to 100.
Great fucking video, my favorite so far.
Useful video and understand your points, but why would you choose a samsung phone for portraits because it has a specific secondary camera for that purpose... Google has clearly stated that without the use of a second camera they are able to achieve the same result...? Also machine learning means the more you do something the smarter/better it gets so you take loads and loads of portraits on the pixel, they in theory should get better over time, either way fair enough to your video!
I actually dont know about dxomark until this video. lol
Saw that.. Poor V30... Poor LG 😞 lol
DxOMark doesn't want to test Fujifilm cameras.
I just got out of class... lol
This video should have been named The one with Marques destroying DxOmark (mikedrop).
Snarky, but I like it! haha
you nailed it marques!!\njust love the way u present!!
This why I subscribe to this channel! No BS tech videos!!
How about a review of the new Nikon D850 … from the perspective of a video maker?
Can you decrease treble in your voice mkbhd
Bro too much talkin,,,, uv never been so.........
savage!
This is your best video. Thank you
MKBHD rants. love it
Clean and clear explanation. Pretty cool😎
Thanks for informing the rest of us. You made some great points about how the score is weighted based on certain aspects of camera performances that are subjectively emphasized over others. I also didn't know about the partnerships, or that the score wasn't out of 100.
this is the fatest iphone that we've ever made XD
Your best video ever. You’re smart 😀
Wow, thank you so much for putting this video together and explaining how the scoring works. I thought it was out of 100 as well haha. Now I'm informed!
Thanks for clearing things up
Where should you go for prime tech journalism? MKBHD.
Do explain videos like this more.
You can tell MKBHD is tired of all these scores and finally had to say something. Haha great review guy.
This proves again and again how great a YouTuber you are! Great job as usual MB.
I don't know why but this is one of my favourite MKBHD videos
Dxo is bs i think.
All this time I chose a smart phone camera based on things I need and performance I liked from that camera. DxO mark ratings or any other ratings will fade if you don't get what you were looking for from the camera. So like you said, grain of salt.\nOr a teaspoon.
My S7 edge in coral blue got 88!!! Woot!  What will my S9 get one day? 100?
Thanks MKBHD. This is really a great info video!
MKBHD mark
MKBHD fighting fake news since 2017
Dope video & and thanks for dropping some knowledge.
I love your show. You deserve all your subs. Well done Sir.
how did Pixel get a weighted average of 99 when none of the individual values are as high as that
I'd get it if it had a headphone jack - _-
Anyone know where that Engadget video is? Can't seem to find it.
Are you going to do a full review of the Lg V30?
My man's video roasted Engadget so bad they removed their video from their channel 😂
Apple better pick up their game and make their designs and customization features better
thats why we watch mkbhd instead of paying attention to the press
The only one with the highest score! \nThat makes sense alot of sense...
Yo Marques, whats that bracelet you wear on your hand (the long one, covering your forearm and hand)? Pretty neat
Well benchmark tests are also 1 number so this is pretty much like that. I still use this number to determine if a camera on a phone sux or not
It’s like car brands they want to succeed on the Nurburgring, not on the road .
If I purchase a Cellular Ipad (AT&T)  - will I be able to make and accept phone calls on it through AT&T??
Is the Apple WATCH  LTE WORTH THE EXTRA VERIZON COST?
And it makes sense for it to be a linear thing rather than an out of 100 rating because what if a phone camera from 2011 got a 95 and then in 2017 a phone with a clearly better camera gets a 95 then was there an improvement?
Great insight about DXOMark ratings. Makes me wonder what other ratings these companies are using as a marketing edge.
Consulting for their scoring systems? Clever girl..
Bruh i totally had it with them wack  was phones! Review some more camera's/computers/tech!
This Benchmark isn't the most important
This video is a BIG SLAP to whoever bashing Dxomark ratings (including Google) lol...
Who else went to the DxO website after this?
bujo in the bg. bujo styled dots in the theme 🤔
That's why it's called marketing strategy
I only know who you are, cuz a dude at work recognized a whole bunch of your intro tracks, as music that I play at work.  Now I have a massive hate-on for you, for having early access to Wednesday's track. HOW AND WHY!?! I don't care about your tech reviews...how do you have early access!??!?!!?!??!?!
Quality of these videos are next level.
I Like your videos and all But most of them are about phones. Maybe look at good gaming lapots as I'm looking for one atm
iphone got 2 point less because single camera compare to the Plus, so they are telling that the pixel is a 100 point camera? ahahahah i think they took much much money
One day (God willing)you’re going to walk into Best Buy and see (((“MB”)))certified or reviewed on the box that you’re buying..just watch
Marques is usually so neutral (expect on dear Apple videos), it's funny seeing him go to town on tech press for their clickbait and superficial articles.
One of the best reviews I've watched concerning any aspect of smartphones! And I've watched a thousand of them.
You're not gonna get S8 for portrait photos. You're gonna get a proper DSLR for portrait photos. You can't get proper pictures with phones. Instead of buying a $1000 phone for taking pictures, buy a $200 phone and a $800 camera.
Their review of the old 808 definitely seems strange. They have the 808 as the lowest rated phone. That's the 41MP camera from 2012.
Thanks for the breakdown
It is very nice to have someone to point out that!
Thanks for the clarity around this rating.
Hi everyone l like everything about SMARTPHONE SO I HAVE A GREAT TIME TO INTERNET CONNECTION WITH YOU
I am thinking how much Google gave money to dxo
This video is super crisp and clean even at 240p (on a smartphone)
I have both a note 8 and a Pixel 2 and I completely disagree that the Note takes better portrait shots. The software of Googles camera more than compensates for the lack of second camera
With all the flagship models, most cameras do great and you're right, it is difficult to tell the difference. After all, in real life, nobody is going to sit and compare your travel photos taken with the Google Pixel 2 or the iPhone 8. The best camera is the one we have with us, and more often than not, the most important element of the camera is the one who's pressing the shutter.
Right on. Thank you.
all the dislikes, I didn't even know Engadget had 1000 employees damn
FAKE NEWS. READ THOSE RECEIPTS MARQUES YAS
MKOBEHD
Explained Nicely👍
As Always Best
Engadget deleted their video
Mate 10 pro?
Samsung bokeh :45\nPixel bokeh :45 ☺️
I really wish they'd put small bezels on the pixel 2 just like the pixel 2 xl
where is the galaxy s7/s7 edge? That should be listed
Much appreciated
Great video!
basically u r telling they r fraud withing saying it.
Good vid
well explained !!
Respect!
Good info
DxOMark is just a number. -Navi Dendi-
Respect.
awesome! Marques
Awesome video 👌

Afrojack in armada , who cares as long he bring best music
One of the best tracks of 2017!
Very cool track, I'm not so fan of this generic future house drop but the melody and Vassy's vocal in particular are amazing :)
What a song! 🔥🔥👏
Afrojack_The King!
Afrojack!!\nLet's Go!!
I like the  chords much.

Tá show é a melhor vocalista do mundo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
A M E I
The piano is legit!!!
the quick if i had to get doesn't really fit but besides that its a fine track.
NICE VOICE\nNICE TRACK ♥
That piano feels out of beat...
sounds an awful like CALVO :)
I'm not sure why Afrojack is releasing on Armanda. But considering the other songs he has released they wouldn't fit on armanda very well. But I'm just happy this song exists.
Look my new video in my channel help please
beautiful video song was great
wow finally!!!what a great track!!!!
Hey Was Great But we never lost the vibe of it!! Great work Vassy & Afrojack and Oliver Rosa ofcourse!
Feels like summer while listing !!
This ! Is good track !
Afrojack, Dillon Francis , Borgeous on Armada ?what’s next Martin Garrix on Armada ?

То чувство когда баба поющая выглядит как мужик а мужик на видео на бабу похож.
🙌🙌❤🔥🔥🔥
Afrojack❤🔥
Amaizing collab! VASSY x Afrojack = <3
VASSY IS A FUCKEN SINGER?
Great song 👍👍👍👍
Круто !)
🔥
No hay la opcion me encanta no? Buena Musica Un gusto haberte visto por Perú Afrojack (Y)vuelva pronto
que grande!!! afrojack and vassy sigan asi saludos desde argentina!!!
La música, lenguaje universal. - Music, universal language.
Swedish House Mafia vibe? anybody?
Μπραβο VASSY πολυ ωραιο κομματι
Uwielbiam takie kawałki i ten głos.. Vassy
Vassy's voice is simply made for EDM 😍👌
Vassy is really awesome cool vocal and we by Tiesto song same cool groove 💕💕💕💕💕✌️
VASSY, you should sing more, your voice is awesome! Youre doing really well.
Afrojack is dutch so my reaction is gonna be dutch too. In Nederland zijn de dj's veel beter dan in De Verenigde Staten (veel succes met vertalen) (much luck with translating)
Ten utwór jest mało ambitny, taki radiowy pop dla plebsu!
This song has me missing people I haven't even met before 😳 Loving the new tune 🔥🔥🤘
its meh
banda de latinoamerica y el mundo pasen a mi canal esta semana hay mucho drop
LIKE SI AFROJACK ES UN PVTO AMO
Am I the only one who thinks that the vocals of Vassy started at a weird point  of the instrumental? It just seemed off to me :/\n\nEdit: Also her timing right before the drop hits is weird to me.\n\nCorrect me if im wrong :P
Omg that Gucci bag!!! Love your vlogs!
I get what you mean about smells. I am Albanian and to me south Albania by the Ionian coast has a such a beautiful smell. Woodsy and sweet. Its from a plant that grows on the mountains, don't know what it is in English.
aw fab video!! 😌
whys it so dark??
absolutely looooove your dress ❤️💜❤️💜
In this video, Estee=perma-grin☺
kisses from greece!!! thanks for visiting and show our country to the world! i also promote you here hahaha take care and keep going the good work
GORGEOUS
New de_santorini remake looks decent
That absolutely says Sexplorer!
Quick question: \nWhat mic did you all used to capture the audio, it’s so crisp and clear! :) unless that was just how you mixed it in editing
*most cutest is not good grammar but it doesn't matter, because it's true!!
Nice vlog. Nice place. Thank you. Good luck.
you guys are the cutesttt!!!! <3
Estée girl where is your black swimsuit from? I love it! 😊
So jelly !!\nWhat camera do you vlog with??
Haha loved the shoit part! Good lookin’ couple 😍
So glad you visit  my country... I am a greek girl ... Santorini it's such beautiful place ... You also may visit other islands as kefalonia and skopelos which have so amazing beaches... There are so many other places to go in my country that you need a life time to see them all ... Your video is perfect ... Thank you for all the good thinks you showed in your vlog ... All greek people are kind and hospitable... I love mousaka too... Many Kisses #visitgreece #greeksummer ❤❤❤
beautiful..
omg Aslan's bouche pink velvet shirt is soooooo nice!
Aslan's crocs though. yasss bisshh slay all day. 9:47
The quality of this video is amazing. Aaaah santorini 💗💗
Haha hearing Aslan talk about the sunset. Someone get him a travel guide job for every single city immediately. Love him so much.
Glad you two had fun!  Wishing you and Aslan all the best!
Wow, Santorini is stunning!!! 💦💦💦
everything was lovely!
Stunning! Can't wait to visit someday <3
Love how you pronounce Greek names! It's so cute!
Is Aslan just holding the GoPro? Because it's so steady 😐 I'm all over the place with mine
Hey! What camera is she using?
If I had to pick the best part of the video...well ok..how about all 18 minutes of it?  Yes, sure does seem like paradise.  This is akin to visual utopia.  Well, I'll pick just one highlight.  @13:05 when you were showing off that lovely outfit.  The background, the sun setting behind you.. the colors and everything...beyond breathtaking.  Also doesn't hurt that we have a wonderful couple responsible for putting such a brilliant vlog out there.  BTW..I have watched this more than once.
this is so immersive, I've been to Santorini and the places you've mentioned including a visit to the caldera (Santorini is a volcanic island) and it's so beautiful! the people are very nice too. I love you guys :-))
This is amazing! This video just re-confirmed that I want my honeymoon there!
Made me so happy I have to go now
i really love your vlog, especially with aslan on it! xx
Oh my goodness! The pool! I cried! I adore your dress ❤️️❤️️
You in that flower dress and the background.. So beautiful <3
If you want a parfume that smells like that fresh salty air in Santorini you should try Jo Malone Wood sage & sea salt. It's just the best 😍😍😍😍
Hey Estee, seeing your vlogs for years now. Aslan n u are growing so beautifully!
Feel like I need to book a holiday now
Beautiful hotel, sadly out of our budget 🙁 but thanks for sharing
The audio quality is insane!! Huge thank you!
Ohhhh my goodness. It is my number 1 dream to go to santorini. 😭😍 Sooo lucky.
So lucky!!! Makes me want to drop everything and go somewhere
So beautiful. Thank you for sharing!!!!!
Oh the memories! We went there four and a half years ago on our honeymoon and also stayed in Imorovigli. We were like the fourth to last hotel, you would have walked right by it. Man it’s beautiful. We neeeeed to go back! We did the hike right when we got there and were NOT prepared. We just went out, only brought one bottle of water, and were wearing flip flops. Whoops! We did the sunset in Oia, our hotel, and Thira and it was so amazing. Thus makes me nostalgic... thanks for the video! Shout out from Red Deer, Alberta!
esteem I'm sorry i just need to say that you are a beautiful classy lady:)
Those views are what dreams are made of!
Estee, you should really try the Korres body lotion/ shower gel in Santorini Vine! It's my favourite scent out of the whole brand, which is greek and natural ingredient based! They're amazing!!
You picked the best time go. I will say until September Santorini is packed. Enjoy!
Santorini looks like the most beautiful place 😍 xo
what a beautiful video! this made me really happy <3
16:28 Estée has the most beautiful smile ever!
So happy you two visited my country!!!!
Estee, you are glowing. Love to see you and Aslan having such a wonderful time. Some of my favorite people ever, live it up in Santorini!
was thinking you guys both uploaded the same thing! I like the part 1/2 idea. Did you both edit the vlogs together?
I need to go right now, omg, so beautiful!
googled the hotel in case one day I go to Santorini - a little outta my price range 😳
This video is amazing , you guys are adorable
It looks AMAZING! Firmly on my Greece Trip list for June xx
Oia is pronounced Ia! Have fun in Santorini from a Greek in the UK :)
Honeymoon destination.....check!... No doubt about it Santorini it is!!
Estee,try the Korres Santorini vine line....I'm sure you are gonna love it!!!!First time I tried it ,I swear to God I felt I was there......also, Oia is pronounced Ia(not aia  but ea)....(oi in Greek is called difthongos, and is one of our 5 different Is)💖
I was in Santorini last month! It is so beaufitul place, thats true!! :-)
The fresh air they were talking about reminded me of when I visited Oregon...such clean fresh air!
It is pronounced IA in greek. Weather in Greece is nice till almost Christmas time.\nBut July and August it is very hot.
I went to see how much money it would cost for me and my boyfriend to go to this hotel at the end of august next year. A week for 5.500€. So... That isn't happening. :D :D :D
In the name Oia, the O is silent so you pronounce it as if it was written Ia (capital i not l, lol)!! I am a big fan of your videos! Hope you enjoy your time in our country! Welcome! If you need any tips, feel free to contact me!
Awww, Santorini is my absolute favorite place. Love every piece of it. Have fun. xx Linda
The trail has a lot of wild oregano growing along side.
Why do you all watch these Fucktards!!! Get your own life.
I'm so glad you visited my country and had such a wonderful time. You should visit again and discover the unique beauty of many other islands as well! Lots of kisses!
You are such a cute couple.
The prices for the hotel are absolutely ridiculous!
I really really enjoyed this vlog! Now I want to go there too!!
Please break down your trip to Santorini on your blog! I do want to visit. The hotel room looked extremely claustrophobic though, so not sure I could stay there even though it looks beautiful. 😳
this trip of yours was amazing . One of the best vlogs!!!!!  loved it 😘😍
you guys are so damn perfect together UGH want.
The thumbnail is so so sweet especially you guys rarely kiss in front of the camera!
I can't stop smiling! So gorgeous.
Wow i wanna earn that much money via youtube so i plan this kind of trip as well
So glad you two had a great time in my homeland! Next time you are in Greece go to Chania. Aslan will love the history and you will absolutely love this adorable little town.
Ok, it's time for me to finally go to Greece! I've done a bit of research, since I watched your videos, and the end of September, beginning of October is a great time.
Hey Estee and Aslan! My fiancé and I visited Santorini last spring, watching your vlog made me wanna go back asap! Thinking about maybe getting married there... Who knows!
Glad you had a wonderful time, just amazing views. You just cannot beat beautiful Greece at dusk. Great video
Love all the extra information Aslan provides!!! Thank you
whoa i did the hike at the end of july and let me tell you i feel your pain! i pasted your hotel a bunch, i remember those chair with the blue cushin! ugh i want to go back
8:23-8:50 “how do you even know this?!” with your face expression haha! reminds me of my boyfriend. what a lovely paradise !
OMG what a hotel! Santorini is stunning.\nI really enjoy this video cause you two seem so happy... love both 😘
Also, your room is actually a cave. Most homes on the cliff are built inside caves which formed after the volcanic eruption thousands of years ago. It's practical because homes are sheltered from the strong winds which you probably felt at times!
the French Connection floral dress is cute! Like Aslan's pink corduroy shoyt too :0p. The Santorini sunset was so lovely. Gorgeous place!
I love you as a couple guys!!! You are the perfect match!
So glad you both enjoy this gorgeus trip, thanks for sharing.
I love you guys! Couple holiday goals💖
There's a shower gel by Korres called Santorini Vine and it genuinely smells like Greece, I really recommend it! It's amazing.
If you loved the air in Santorini, I’d highly recommend going to iceland! You’ll love it, the air is so fresh
Hey random person scrolling through the comments!\nI hope you have a great day! \nFrom a Danish singer who's dream is to hit 10k subs🍀
this video was so calming to watch... dreamy
Stunning place,and an amazing vlog :))
Fat chinky and a flabby girl....fuck off
Please share your experiences/relationship with alcohol in the comments section below, we'll both be reading them all! xxx
I LOVE HOW YOUTUBE KEEP PUTTING YOU AND LUCY INTO TRENDING OMG YAS QUEENS YAS
thank you so much girls for talking about such a sensitive subject 💓x
I have only drank a bit of wine in a church when I was young and nothing after that. I'm soon-to-be 20 and I don't drink. I do go to the bars and clubs with my friends still and I have fun, maybe even more than they do! I love dancing so i really enjoy clubbing and then just the overall buzz of the night like Melanie said. People usually think that I would be blthered if I was around people who drink but that's not true either! So I'm glad that you are talking about this because like in Irelend in finland the alcohol culture is a big thing and kids start really young...
I reckon binge drinking can be really harmful and it's a safe option to usually drink in moderation 😉❤️
I probably only drink 2 or 3 times a month, and it's usually 1-3 beers with friends at game nights at someone's home or seeing a band in a pub. None of my friends really go in for the club/binge drinking scene, especially since uni.\n\nI noticed the same relaxed drinking culture in Italy. People would meet up for 1 or 2 drinks to hang out and chat, but I don't remember ever seeing anyone drunk in public, except American study abroad students.
I'm Australian and we also have a very prominent culture of drinking and underage drinking. To drink a bottle of wine or a six pack of beers on a weeknight is considered very normal among my age group. I'm 20 and spend pretty much every evening with friends after work/uni etc. I'd say that I drink at least 6 standard drinks 5-6 times a week but that doesn't make me drunk (I've probably heightened my tolerance a LOT). I never see friends without a couple of drinks at the same time. I feel that none of us drink to get drunk at all, its just a pleasant (and delicious) addition to the vibes. Because of this there is no dependency there or anything.\nEven my parents have a couple of drinks and a good chat to debrief every night after work.\nWhere I live, drinking is a natural part of everyday life, but for the most part it's not done in a destructive manner.\nPs loved this video - so interesting!❤❤❤
Binge drinking is considered normal to a lot of college students and people in their twenties here in the U.S. I regret most of the binge drinking I did in my youth. Now I rather enjoy a really good cocktail, glass of wine, or fancy beer.
I'm in my 20s and I don't like to drink. I don't like the taste of alcohol or the way it feels once it settles in my stomach. I've never gotten drunk or tipsy. Before I turned the legal drinking age in my country I was so excited to finally be able to drink but now that I've gotten a taste of alcohol I don't fancy it at all. I guess it's a blessing.. I save money and I'm doing my liver a favor as well.
I'm 13 in second year and if anyone drinks people always talk shit about them and no one really does so cause it's really looked down on like
i'm giggling, I was raised in Germany, legal drinking age for beer and anything under 5% alcohol is 16, anything more than 5% is 18, and most kids start having drinks/getting drunk around 12. the full blown cliche lol
I'm from North Wales and I think that the drinking culture here is very similar to that of Ireland, or maybe it's just the particular place I've grown up in. I started drinking when I was around 13y/o, nearly 14. Myself and my friends would ask strangers to go into the shops for us and I would drink, usually, a whole bottle of 20cl straight vodka most Friday nights before going ice skating! My worst years of drinking were probably around 14-15 when I would go to house parties most weekends. I was in a long term relationship from 16-18 and realised that my drinking slowed down, and even since turning 18 I didn't go out regularly like my friends did, I thought maybe I was over it since I'd been doing it since such a young age. However, now I'm nearly 19 and just started uni in Liverpool and I've found that my drinking habits have worsened quite severely, probably due to my relationship ending too! I think the UK as whole has a really bad drinking problem, especially compared to abroad!xxx
i'm Scottish, we're not much better.
I don't know why, but I grew up being anti-alcohol even though both my parents were (very moderate) drinkers. At 15 my friends started drinking so I had to loosen up, but then at 16 a very traumatic event that has shaped my life happened, which included alcohol. And I decided that I would probably never drink again in my life
I got into a habit over the summer holidays where I drank more or less every single day and was drunk each time (I'm 18 next friday) and I put myself in so much danger and I ruined many relationships in my life. I did this because I was severely depressed and as an Irish person the drowning the sorrow culture was the only way I knew and although some of the times it was great Craic most of the time it was VERY bad I think I did become dependant on it because now I always want a drink but I haven't drank since the end of August and I'm going out for my birthday in two weeks to drink and I know how to control myself now thankfully
Drinking culture is really rough where I live. I live in a very religious place where drinking is strongly discouraged. Because of that a lot of young people (and really all people in general) are never taught what responsible drinking is. I'm grateful that I have a pretty good relationship with alcohol. I never drank in my adolescence. Now that I'm older I definitely enjoy having a drink every once and awhile. But it's pretty occasional. Maybe once a week or less.
I recently spent four weeks in Dublin and can confirm what you said in the beginning. Now I'm sure that there are similar drinking cultures in other countries like my own. What struck me the most was, that most of the Irish people went with the stereotype and presented themselves and their culture as everyhing was about the alcohol. I felt like there was nothing else to do in Dublin than going to the pub - in the middle of the day!
I'm 16 and German and I don't drink and never even did. But there's some kind of pressure to also start drinking. I don't have any friends because they literally only meet to have some kind of drink/fun. This also kinda shows that my generations or teenagers are bored and don't know what to do with each other. But because I'm not interested in drinking/smoking etc I'm alone. I've lost some good friends because of this their hobby
Awn you're so pretty in this Mel
The Czech Republic has probably higher alcohol consumption than Ireland, but I think that's also because of beer and pub tourism especially from English-speaking countries that exists here. \nHowever, binge drinking is not such a big issue because people would drink a beer or two with friends on any week day and not only at weekends, so they don't feel the urge to compensate for the dry week. It's changing, tho, and more and more people only go out at weekends and then drink a lot.\nI think beer and pubs is really a part of our culture and it would be pointless to try to eradicate it, but there should be more awareness about how easy it is for some people to become addicted. You mentioned drinking alone at home and that's just one of the red flags that people should watch out for.
I’m 17 and I have been to few party’s and I love going out with my friends and getting nearly drunk but I don’t think I have ever been fully drunk because I know how dangerous it is and I don’t want to be the burden on friends. I’m the one that will be going around with water I went to a party at a weekend for my friends 18 and her whole family and her got drunk and I was meant to be staying there but got a friend to take me home because it wasn’t safe. I think there’s a level with alcohol that once you cross it you have ruined yours and other people night and put your self danger and I like to get near it but never cross it
Can you do a video about weed or drugs in general?
I rarely ever drink and don't really enjoy getting drunk at all. I personally enjoy the buzz you get and the relaxed state alcohol can put you in but I always like to be in complete control of what I'm doing etc, so I rarely ever get drunk. I started university just a month ago and some of the things I've seen have genuinely shocked me. If you like the taste of it and can limit yourself that's not a problem! There is definitely a very unhealthy attitude towards alcohol in the UK, especially among students, but I'm lucky in that I'm surrounded by lots of positive influences and people who never pressure me to drink!
In America it's really about who you are friends with. I'm friends with people where if you have one glass of wine at a get together you are the odd one out but my cousins have friends where if you didn't have one or two glasses of wine you are the odd one out. And then there are people where if you didn't get plastered you are the odd one out.
Scotland has basically the same drinking culture. I don’t know if it’s the Irish culture which is very imbedded in Scottish culture due To when the Irish came over from the seventeen hundreds to the present day. I’m definitely not saying this is the Irish’s fault it’s our fault because we know our own statistics and we aren’t stopping it. But I have Irish friends and Scottish friends,teenage boys and girls underage and their all getting so drunk every weekend and it’s bad. X
Thanks for talking about this. I'm 22, Irish and in my first year of college. It is strange how many people I can think of that are alcoholics or how many have issues with alcohol. I've a feeling we all go through trouble patches with alcohol since, as you say, it heightens whatever you're feeling at the time and nobody's happy 100% of the time.\n\nFor myself, I don't drink atm for health reasons. I didn't drink anything until 6th year after I'd been 18 awhile and even then only ever one or two. Nobody in my family drinks, same with family friends. They had all seen and tlld stories of how drink had changed people for the worst and you never know if you could have a taste for it. In saying that we'll have a Bailey's come Christmas. Life is a bit strange here not drinking - across weddings, debs, birthdays, funerals... In the end I just found it easier to have one and nurse it for the night instead of having people chat to me about why I'm just drinking a coke.\n\nI met the two of ye in Schuh a few months ago. I was pretty stunned and not in a very good place at the time. The two of you were so nice even though you were rushing. Just wanted to thank the two of you for your kindness and for your solid content time and time again. \n\nHope all well after the hurricane! X
Ok ok Mel & jess Tbh, I grew up in the 🍀Irish catholic church🍀 over here in the states and there was alcohol at a lot of the church functions 😁😂😁🍺🍷\n\nBut I have a sporadic and social relationship with alcohol cause I have such a seriously low tolerance. I wouldn’t say I need an alcoholic beverage everyday but most weekends I defo enjoy a couple pints with friends 😁👍🏽\n\nGood vid ma girls, loves ya 😁😍😉
England is the same to be honest. I’m 17 but there are a lot of places that will sell to me and the first time I got drunk was at 14. I don’t have an alcohol problem I just drink at parties and occasions which I think is healthy
I just realized I love Irish girls!
Came from Dom aka the womb  raIDER
I saw a docummentary on Netflix called The truth about alcohol where they said the more muscle you have the higher your tolerance will be so you will need to drink more to get drunk.
I'm currently sober, been so for 4 months! Quit drinking, smoking cigarettes, weed, and doing other drugs since I wanted to become a better person I guess. It's going good, I like it! I started drinking when I was like 14 or something, it seemed so cool! I used to get really drunk, so drunk I passed out, and I enjoyed it. Now I'm 20 year old, I want to live my life to the fullest and I believe I do so (currently) by being sober. I used to always be looking forward to the next party, now I enjoy them but it's not the reason I'm alive if you get me. I sit there with a cup of tea or some water instead  ^-^
Thank you so much for this video Melanie! Absolutely amazing ! The drinking culture in Norway is the same way... a lot of pressure to drink in many situations
Last time I got drunk was about a week ago, maybe a little more, I drank so much vodka and whisky that I got alcohol poisoning. I'm such a small person, and once I have a bottle I don't know how to stop. usually. this time I didn't stop and even though people took the last bit I had left, it was too late and I had an awful time and I harmed my body in ways that I don't think anyone should ever expose  themselves to. im not saying drinking is awful , but if you are like me and you do not know how to stop then there is a problem. I don't think I'm an alcoholic but I did have the time to self access and realize I was drinking for very very wrong reasons. I can't say if there are right reasons to drink but I know of people who enjoy it and who can control it and that has to say something about the habit.
I'm Irish... I've grown up with an alcoholic father and put off drinking until my 18th birthday (when I had some West Coast Cooler). I was always afraid of becoming like him so I don't push my limits. I can get a little bit tipsy and then stop, that I'm having a good time but it never gets messy (and no hangovers either). It's only since my younger siblings have grown up that we've been more exposed to his alcoholism and the resulting stigma from the problems he attracts to our house. It's pretty shit! On a different note, I've watched my bf's younger brothers start drinking and secretly drinking since they were 13/14. What is the country coming to?
I watch your videos only because of Irish accent. P.S. your sister doesn't look like a teenage
I don't drink like I've only ever had sips of other people's drinks in my life, I'm going to University soon and I'm scared about how people will treat me
As someone who doesn't drink, has never drank, and doesn't plan on ever drinking(I'm 17, so that might change, but as of now, I don't plan on it), I found this so interesting to watch. My mother and my grandmother were pioneers, and have never drank, and my father is french, so he grew up surrounded by the idea that alcohol is a kind of delicacy. My dad drank from the age of 14, but he never binged on drink/ It was always a glass of wine at the dinner table with my granddad. He often comments on how dangerous the drinking culture is here in Ireland. How, when you turn eighteen, the biggest thing you think of is 'Yes! I can drink now!'. I'm very lucky because I haven't grown up in an environment where drinking is seen as an essential or as something that is part of life, because it doesn't have to be either of those things. Thanks for your insight, I really enjoyed this!!
I live in Australia in a small town just out of Melbourne, I'm 14 and I've never had a drink. A lot people will probably look at that and be like oh thats good and normal. But I can tell you so many people I say that to literally look at me like I'm an alien, where I am it isn't strange for an 11 year old to be drinking, the legal age here is 18 as well and for good reason lol. \nAnyway but when I was twelve I knew kids were dropping out of school because they were drunks and addicts and I mean that was just normal. The adults around me even often try to pressure me into drinking but I just I can't, I think I've seen what its done to those around me and it makes me so bloody anxious, just the thought of drinking gives me so much anxiety its dreadful.
I am from the Netherlands, 21yo. I started drinking at 14.. back then the legal drinking age was 16 (since then it has gone up to 18). I used to binge drink at every party I went to and sometimes we would go into a park at night to drink, so our parents couldn't find out, so not a very safe environment.. I don't think I've ever had a problem with drinking, besides feeling peer pressured into drinking loads at parties. I think when you get frown upon when you don't drink, that is when social drinking stops being fun. I am currently trying to stay sober till christmas, I havent craved any alcohol whataoever and I couldnt care less, but with social gatherings it can get quite hard. Wondering if people can relate?
It's probably hard to believe, but I'm 27 y.o. Russian (lol, stereotypes) who never tried any alcohol and not going to. I was just never interested and I believe it causes more harm than benefits you.
I never had a drinking problem and the only few times I ever got tipsy was when I just wanted to see what it felt like or because I felt pressured to drink because of other people. But when I get tipsy I always get pretty down and tired. In Germany you can legally drink with 16 and you are able to buy stronger liquor with 18. But I have seen and heard of 12-13 year old kids drinking and I personally got tipsy for the first time with 14. I never thought of drinking in relation to culture, but since we have the Oktoberfest it probably seems to be rooted in our culture.
If I go out with the intent on drinking, I'll go for beer most of the time. I do enjoy vodka and rum too. Not together obviously lol. I have never been drunk in my life. My brother has a dependency on alcohol so after growing up seeing what being drunk did to him, it made me realize I never wanted to feel or be like that. We've tried several different ways to help him. None have worked. Guess you can't help someone if they don't wanna be helped.
First id like to say I love your videos! Im 22 and live in the US. I usually drink maybe one shot of chilled cinnamon whiskey or gold schlager a year maybe...usually around my birthday. My parents always were very open with alcohol around my sister and I. We learned about it early on and how to to be responsible while drinking. I tend to not drink though because when I have drank before my negative emotions came out worse. For example if I was sad the sadness just became more apparent after a little bit of alcohol.
Thanks so much for sharing your experiences! It was really interesting to me, as a teenager who gets a lot of these talks from school and has friends who I know are partying and drinking a lot.\n\nI'm 17 living in California. I'm from a family that discourages drinking, plus my mother and older sisters hate the taste of alcohol. Because of this, I've always been the goody-2-shoes who never drinks. I've mostly been okay with that, until now. I don't always want to be afraid of drinking and never try drinking at all because I'm afraid to get too drunk or binge drink or something. I think I have a healthy relationship with alcohol because I'm so aware of all of this stuff, and I have supportive people in my life. Also, I would never hide my alcohol usage. I would tell my parents, even if they weren't happy with it, and I think that's what matters. So now I want to allow myself to be free and have drinks with friends because I trust myself and the people around me to be aware of how I'm using alcohol and keep it safe and healthy.
I'm not a big drinker really and not bothered about the taste, but if I don't choose alcohol people sometimes get uncomfortable as if I'm therefore judging them.\n\nUK is the exact same. UK and Ireland are the binge drinking capitals of Europe I'm sure. I started drinking at 17.5 and that was LATE. My siblings have all started at about 14.
The one on the left = ♨️
How much is a pint of beer in Ireland? Just out of curiosity because yous mention it's so expensive
This is amazing. Thank you so much for talking about this!!! Also, all I want is to be your friends!!!!
I'm currently in college and drinks are as cheap as €3 for a double vodka!
what do you think of changing he legal age to 16? do you think it would benefit irish teens in a way that they would be safer with it or do you think it would have the opposite effect?
Hi to both of you,\n\nI personally think that the reason countries in the northern hemisphere particularly in Europe drink more because going back a few hundreds years, I believe that we would drink to keep ourselves warm and with English pub history, men would go to work all day (wives at home), then go to the local public house to relax before going home for tea. It's how it was in those days.\n\nFrom my own experience of drinking in England and in a hot country, I could drink the same amount or more but feel in control of myself in a warm country whereas in England, I'd feel ready for home. I think this links between the different environments, haven't quite sussed out the reasoning behind it but there is my theory. \n\nHope this makes sense...\n\nHazel
I think Germany is almost the same (but I also think I don't even have to say that because Germany is pretty popular for their beer and the Oktoberfest and stuff haha) with the drinking, its starts at a really young age, you are allowed beer and wine at the age of 16 and harder drinks at 18 but to be honest loads and loads of young people already drink with 14 (one girl had to get picked up from a halloween party in school when we were like 13 because she had alcohol poisoning!) So yeah, it is pretty bad over here as well but I have to say I grew up in a small village and was never really interested, I never really went clubbing before (I am 19) because I feel uncomfortable around a bunch of strangers being drunk. The only thing I really enjoyed was back when I lived  in Ireland when you go out with a few friends and drink a few drinks, I tend to get sick quite easily but if I drink I LOVE baileys or cider (one of them is called orchard right) ! But else I don't really drink, even when it is very common here in Germany and a huge social thing, if you go out on a weekend you get massively drunk and tell your friends the monday after how fun it was to be that drink (or at least all my classmates do haha)
I'm from the north of England and I feel like the drinking culture here in the UK is pretty much the same as what you've described in Ireland. It here is also a part of the culture, it's a lot more rare to find people who don't drink in my opinion. :p
I'm of Irish heritage in the US (I'm a McD.). I remember as a kid seeing the stereotype of the drunk Irishman and how stupid he was. I went the opposite way. I only have drinks on my birthday (usually 2 margaritas) and none the rest of the year. It's actually really easy to do if you have the right friends. Great video, Melanie and Jessie!
I’m from Australia and there is a huge drinking culture down here. If you are aged between 15-25 and don’t centre your weekends around binge drinking “you aren’t having fun”. It’s even more prevalent in 18-25,  especially at uni. I don’t like who I turn into when I drink so I stopped at 22. Have felt so much better since.
my biological dad was an alcoholic and even though I havent lived with him since I was 2 I think it's still ingrained in my memory somehow. Ive never been one to drink, Ive gotten tipsy once (I was about 19 at the time). However I can't drink a lot as Ive got epilepsy and drinking too much can trigger them. there is not a lot of drinks I like/will drink but I have started to have a drink now and again, mainly if I go out for a meal or if we have a special occasion, so I feel I have quite a healthy relationship to alcohol in comparison to the majority of people my age (I'm 23)
Us in Scotland have a massive drink  problem too. I am the same as Jess. I drank most at 17 to 18. Now 22 I rarely drink. Drunk stories are funny and scary but it's good to get it out of your system so then you can respect alcohol :).
Im from the uk where binge drinking is also a pretty big problem. I like to drink mainly socially but i know i also have a bad relationship with it where i'll drink on my own in my room because im depressed. So it fluctuates
Le me say this.. I enjoy watching beautiful creatures talking non-stop
I don't drink it makes me so sick straight away not tipsy just so poorly! So just don't bother but I would like to be able to enjoy a few! I think I got out of lots of drink between 16-20 from the sickness the morning after too I would throw up all day long! Xxx
This video came in the right time
I rarely drink now but when I was much younger (14-17) I would drink so much and I think that's why now I just would rather not get drunk. Sometimes I do but as I started drinking so young it's completely put me off 👌🏼
I actually basically don't drink much at all,  when I was younger sure there was a drinking culture when was a teenager in the 80's so its been in OZ for a very long time, I stopped most of my drinking when I had my Kids and Believe it or not lost the taste for alcohol.  I am also a Muso so drinking is pretty standard in my world, however i choose not to drink and don't care what anyone else think.  I also think our drink driving laws in QLD have made a difference to some people as well,  as far as their drinking habits, more people drink before they go out now.   alcohol is expensive and I rather spend my money on other stuff.
Jess your makeup is beautiful. Brings out your natural beauty
i rarely drink but when i do it's small amounts with family around the holidays
I'm 15 in the suburbs near chicago in the U.S. I have never drank. my friends don't want to, and neither do I. some people at my school do have drinking parties and shit like that. It just depends on who you are and who you're friends with. There's 2,600 students at my school, so it makes sense why our culture is so varied.
I only drink to savor the flavors. I've never got drunk before. I love nicely brewed beer, tasty wine.... One of my favorites is umeshu (Japanese plum wine).
We definitely have issues with alcoholism here in America. think part of it is the up bringing. Here in the states you can't drink until you're 21 (legally) so most people do a lot of binge drinking when they're young because they aren't 'taught' to drink they're sneaking it. Then another part is maybe the attitude of work and play... Americans are still pretty concerned with 'the American dream most working crazy long stressful days. So to unwind they maybe have a few at the end of the day. So now you drink to relax and have fun. Happy? Drink. Sad? Drink. It's Tuesday? Bottoms up.
The Portuguese have a very similar culture of drinking. The stereotypes are old drunk farmers.\nIn Canada though, the legal age is 19 and places are STRICT about this. \nMy first drink was when I was 14 and from then on I would drink and get plastered at parties occasionally.\nI grew up in a house where my dad was an alcoholic and because of that, I don't have a very good relationship with alcohol. My mom has been afraid I'll be more inclined to that behaviour. I have a low tolerance and I try to stay away from alcohol when I'm sad or lonely because I don't want to indulge those feelings with something that can really harm me. My friends binge drink a lot and I actually had a discussion with a few of them and it's scary. \nWhat were you parents like about you both drinking?
Why do you drink in the first place if you believe it harms you?
I am from Spain. We start drinking early, my first drink was when I was 13. I have drank a lot in my life, I am 30 now, but this year I have started to quit. I would have maybe two or three beers when I go out but that's it. I can't deal with the shame, the anxiety and the hungover anymore. But the pressure even from friends is huge.
I started drinking just before I was 16 and that was 100% my choice. Like a lot of people have said in Australia we have such a similar situation with alcohol where there are 15 year olds getting drunk and tbh it’s not right in a way but it all comes down to the person, if they want to get drunk at 15 they can have that choice to do it
Not even on my 21st birthday did I drink. I've never had alcohol and don't really plan to. I'm just not interested. What bothers me is how people react when you simply don't drink. Its like people need a reason as to why you don't. I remember going to a bonfire when I was 18 with my new college classmates. One of the girls I was hanging out with asked me if I wanted a drink. I told her no, I didnt drink. When she asked why, I told her, My uncle had liver failure when I was 15. It put me off alcohol. She said she respected that but proceeded to go on about how she thought people that don't drink for no reason are f***ing losers. My uncle did have liver failure but I hate that I feel compelled to use that to get people to leave me alone about alcohol. Alcohol is a personal choice. Drink if you want to, don't drink if you don't want to. Lets respect everyone's choice :) love this series. Love you Mel. Love you Jess 💚💚💚
I'm from Germany and I started drinking and binge drinking with 14. I don't know why, I think I just wanted to distract myself from my problems. I am 16 now and I actually don't drink that much anymore but I still can't control myself when it comes to drugs. I wish people would talk more openly about drug abuse instead of romanticizing it
I just saw this vid and its funny because i have been hanging all day because last night I went to a party and normally im not that bad drunk but i was sloppy and kissing people i shouldn't have and alcohol is such a depressant for me and raises anxiety so much that i was crying in a car park for over an hour... but i kind of know my limit but all my friends were drinking loads so i did and its so unhealthy :(
Both looks so good in this!! The natural makeup looks so amazing on Jess!😍
I rarely ever drink only on occasions. I like being in control of myself haha I get drunk so easily too 😂😂
Thank you for talking about this, my mom passed away this year due to an alcohol addiction so I've never really had a good relationship with alcohol. I've done all the things you've said; been out binge drinking then not remembering then things I'd done then next day. Moms addiction made me see alcohol in a different light, it went on for over ten years and destroyed her life. It can be so dangerous! I would never tell people not to drink as I still drink every now and then (not currently cos I'm pregnant!) but my eyes are so open to the dangers xoxo
I didn't start drinking until I was 19 due to both my parents having somewhat unhealthy relationships with alcohol as I was growing up, and I think I'm glad I waited. I'm from the US but studied at a uni in the UK for a year and also worked in a pub after and personally enjoyed the binge drinking culture. Not that I think it's positive overall, but for me I knew I didn't like the idea of drinking everyday and letting it become habitual, but having one night every couple of weeks when my friends and I would get kinda messy was actually really cathartic for me (I can be pretty anxious otherwise) and there were only a few times that I ever regretted it. Fortunately I'v never turned to alcohol as an escape, and I can see how those habits plus a heavy drinking culture can be a harmful combo. Now I'm back in the US I very rarely drink. I feel there's much more judgement around it here, like people are quick to hand you a beer but also quick to tell you that you're too drunk and should be ashamed a few hours later (not so much from personal experience as observations of others). Plus you have to drive everywhere, and I'm small enough that even one strong drink could put me over, which really limits options for social drinking.
Where is Jessie's top from? It is absolutely adorable !💛
The reason why these bad things happen when you drink alcohol, is because it's a warning, God doesn't want you to drink it! Well why did He create it then? To test you, what do you love more? Him or the demon drink?
1) U BOTH LOOK HOT\n2) NO REALLY SO HOT\n3) THIS IS IMPORTANT
Melanie, your hair is the epitome of Autumn. I love it!
i come from a family of alcoholics and can honestly say that this is so important and an excellent video- thank you guys for being honest about the effects alcohol dependence can have and these issues!
I'm an Irish 22 year old and I've never had a drop of alcohol and I don't plan to. I hate it when I meet people on a night out and they ask what I'm drinking and I say a coke or something they automatically assume that either A) I'm pregnant (which I'm not) or B) that I used to have a drinking problem (which I haven't). When I tell them that I've never had alcohol they all go Fair play to ya or they look at me like I've got ten heads! Last year I was out with my older brother and his friends at his birthday party in a pub/nightclub in Dublin and when I told when of his friends that I don't drink he literally started to question me for the next 45 MINUTES! He was in shock that I never had some cider down the park when I was younger. Also, as a student living away from home for the first time in a different city, I find that I'm not invited out with my friends from college because they automatically assume that I don't like pubs or clubbing. I'm half Irish, half English I LOVE going down to the pub and having the laugh with my friends! Just because I don't drink doesn't mean that I don't like going out with friends on a night out. I find it really sad that we have such a big alcohol problem in Ireland and no, neither of my parents are alcoholics. The reason why I choose not to drink is A) It's WAAAY to expensive! I'm a broke ass college student! B) I don't need it to have fun. Also I'd like to say that no, I don't shame my friends for drinking or anything like that. If they want to drink, let them drink! Rant over.
When I was younger I thought the German drinking culture was bad...then I spend some time at a British Uni and now I think differently. I know people who sometimes get quite drunk, but not too many. I rarely drink. When I do it is usually a drink or two at a bar with friends, very rarely I get a bit tipsy before going out. I like the taste of some alcoholic beverages, especially cocktails, but I also get a bit sick of the taste quite quickly, so drinking a lot wouldn't be easy for me anyway. I also never felt the need to. Most of my good friends don't drink that much and even if I am at a party where people are drinking, I just stop when I feel like I don't want to drink anymore. It is sad that you then sometimes have to justify yourself for not drinking. I also find it shocking when I hear people as young as 18 say that it would be a challenge for them to abstain from drinking for a month. I really have nothing against a bit of social drinking, but I find it disconcerting how something as harmful as alcohol plays such a big role in society.
I live in portugal (which is in the top 20 countries with the most alcohol consumption; legal drinking age - 18)  and I am 16. I can't even count how many times I've gotten  like really fucking drunk. Around my circles of friends it's pretty normal. I've bought alcohol as a 15 year old. It is not allowed but I did it in a self-service place and loads of more local/small shops sell you if you don't look too young, without carding ya. My father incourages me to drink (not the way I do), but since I was little he'd let me drink from his glass. I don't think that had to do with how I came to drink more heavily but idk just thought i'd share that. It´s not just drinking, I don't think I've gone to a party where there wasn't any weed and some other shit. Everytime we're going out it's always with the minset of like let's get fucked. BUT besides that I don't really drink by myself, I don't really feel the need to. And I've never got drunk to solve any problems, it's always been in good fun, I guess. Plus I somehow have never gotten a bad hangover and haven't had any too bad experiences with it, so it has never been a problem for me. the worst that's happened was not enjoying the party cause I was passed out. \n(We mostly drink vodka but anything will do really, also alcohol is really cheap  €6 for a bottle of vodka black for example.)
I'm 15 and have never had any alcohol (other than a glass of prosecco sometimes at family dinners), and have been in quite a few situations where most people are drinking but me. As I have a lot of friends who are older than me (around 18-20), I am generally one of the only ones who is sober. I don't mind not being drunk but I do feel a bit left out, although I've never really had the urge to drink.
in sweden binge drinking is also prevalent. like, we don't drink during the week but then on the weekends and holidays p much everyone drinks. the socialising culture is centered around drinking much, but at least it is a bit more restrictive in stores and like i started drinking at 16 and i think that's pretty common.
Great video by the way. Generally hearing about hangovers reminds me of shitty times but this video was spot on. Keep it up!
When I started drinking I drank very little but when I got 16 it became really bad because I had problems and started binge drinking to forget about them and even if I still had a hangover I couldn`t wait till the next party. \nI did some really stupid and dangerous things while drunk because I didn´t care about anything anymore, like walking on the quay wall and jumping out of a window or stuff like that and I got drunk because I really desperately needed to talk to somebody about my problems but couldn´t do so sober. I always drank on an empty stomach like not haven eaten for 12 hours (I ate very little at that time because I was really down). One time at a party I got really really drunk to the point where I was nearly unconscious and they had to call my parents because it was so bad and I didn´t even recognise my own father. On the next day I didn´t even have a hangover because I puked everything out that was in my stomach. \nBut I had a total blackout and could only remember little bits from a certain point on. \nSince then I have been drunk a few times but I don´t drink as often anymore, mostly because I don´t want my friends to have to look after me when I get really depressed and do stupid shit or when I puke and stuff.  I hope I wont get that bad again but at the moment things aren´t really going too well, so I´ll see, but I´ve learned a few things since then.\nI also always get really depressed the day after.\n\nIn Switzerland you can buy beer etc. when you´re 16 and vodka etc. when you´re 18, but of course most people drink the heavier things before they´re 18.\nBinge drinking is also quite common here but it´s also common to just get a bit tipsy or not even that, it really depends on the occasion. In my city it´s also very common to smoke weed. There´s a quay where all the pubs and bars are and if you get there you can always smell the weed XD. It´s not that everyone smokes weed, but a lot of people do it and they don´t really hide it that much (even though it´s illegal). I know people who have an alcohol problem but I also know people who have a problem with weed (like 3 joints a day, which is just too much regularly).\nI think that most people here are generally quite tolerant if someone doesn´t drink but of course there´s still a lot of people who will make stupid comments etc.\n\nI forgot about fairs where after a certain time just everybody is completely smashed. (also about 40ish/50ish adults)
There's 13/12 year olds in my school getting drunk  at party's and drinking in school and I always get weird stares when I get offered a drink and I say no cause I don't want to drink yet X
I'm Spanish and people start drinking also at very young ages and without any control. But once you're an adult I'd say they usually just drink some beers or wine (or whatever) whenever you feel like it?\nI started drinking when I was almost 18 and that's really weird. I wouldn't really go to clubs or anything bc being there from 1 am to 8 am and sober wasn't ideal... At the beginning I just couldn't understand why anyone would drink, but I feel like in the end it was just to make me feel special. And nowadays I drink when I feel like having a beer or when my friends and I meet to have a coffee or so in the evening. I guess I'm just lucky I don't wanna spend my money in alcohol, I hate spirits and I don't enjoy clubs. \nI wouldn't say I've had a problem with alcohol, but when one of my exboyfriends broke up with me (without telling me a clear answer) and his grandma and father died of cancer I went a bit wild. Once I even went to the cemetery to drink and draw... But all I did was really sporadic and just my way to seek for attention and try to keep myself busy. \n\n\nAnd yeah, they say in the northern countries people drink so much more, and that in the south we have more prostitution... 🤷🏿‍♀️\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Beer's amazing. Especially Belgian beer.
Hi :) I'm from belfast,  started drinking at 13/14 a lot, but when I hit 18 I had no interest in it at all, now at 24 I don't drink, maybe the odd cocktail on holidays but that's it! Completely Agree the culture here is crazy!
love these
Text me 💋 mistress text me girl.
💚💚💚
In England it's also terrible!! I am 17 now and my friends at my school and even myself started heavily and I mean heavily drinking at 13, every single weekend. I know I'm my self have become very dependent on my self with alcohol, I don't wanna go out at all without it or did when growing up. It does take a massive hold on your life and I wish I wasn't addicted as I am now , but I don't fucking love it at the same time .
omg you both look so stunning, im so incredibly gay...
Writing notes!!! Yasss girl. 🔥🔥🍷
What happened to her face. She’s gonna look like donatella if she doesn’t stop wtf
Jac I just wanted to say that the positivity you bring is really appreciated. I just wanted part of a video  (I had to stop it because I was getting a little upset) that someone made bashing you as a person. And it's not just because they were bashing you that made  me upset, I was mostly irritated because they spent time to make a video about someone else and pick them apart. I've been a long time follower of yours and it's always exciting seeing you post videos where you're comfortable and yourself. Long story short, I'm appreciative of the positive community you've built around you
Love you Jaclyn, keep doing you baby! Idc what brand you use as long as the look is 🔥🔥. Honestly people complained about the shipping price from Morphe for your palette and you brought it to Ulta which makes shipping and access cheaper and you made the packaging easier to clean. Thanks for listening and trying to make us all happy. I appreciate the effort and think you are doing great. You are an amazing artist keep it up.
One of the best tutorials there are out there for smokey eyes! Love it!!! I have a question why do you mix shades that much? Is it because you don´t have the exact color or would you do it anyway? xoxo JH
Does anyone know how to block certain channels?  So that I don't have to see them in my recommendations even when I am not subscribed to them.
Big fan of yours. You've taught me almost everything I know about makeup and I love watching you. Follow you on all my social media sites but snapchat videos are my favorite. But if I have a question relating your snapchat videos what is the best way to ask you those questions in reference to your snap chat stories? \nMuch love ❤ - JH
JUST BOUGHT YOUR PALETTE FROM ULTA TODAY for my birthday!!! i love you so much thank you being YOU! your videos always make me happy you’re just so genuine and sincere in ALL your videos i always look forward to them i’ve been wanting your palette forever and i can’t wait until it gets here i’m beyond excited!!!
Maybe I missed it, but I've been waiting on you to come out with your own makeup line for the past like two years when you first mentioned it. Are you still creating your own line or no?
Ah one more question do gel eyeliners dry down or is it like once you have applied it if you rub it it will smear?
Love this look! So pretty!
I use to follow her awhile back ago when she did tons of make up tutorials but now that she is making big money she seems to have moved on.  Good for her that she has the success she has worked hard for but don't act like you care about your followers
Wow. \nYour palette has a new packaging and is being sold at the same price at ulta.  Yet i paid 45 with shipping included and i had to wait for it to be delivered. \nI fuken applied clear duct tape just so it won't get dirty , and wrote the names next to the shadows , to find out u have a better version. \n\nI want an exchange. This is bs
Jaclyn you need to start a vlogging channel!❤️❤️❤️
Your chest and hands are so rosy & pink compared to your face!
You should do a complete house tour now.
This is amazing!! I love it & YOU! I want to try to create this look now :) & keep using Morphe! Don't listen to the hate lol.
does she have a lip piercing ?
The shimmer on the purple is GORGEOUS😍
Jac u should do more videos using Makeup Geek shadows again !! I would love to see you bring some of the back. xoxoxoxo
Why did you stop writing which products you’re using in the description box?
Can you PLEASE do more tutorials using your palette!
Jaclyn I feel like you are very close to Morphe and trust you for a genuine answer- on their FAQs it doesn’t say anything about animal testing/selling in places where it’s required - can you clarify whether Morphe is cruelty free and if it tests on animals? I feel like I always see conflicting answers on the internet. Thank you!
As soon as I saw the backdrop I though “ hocus pocus”
Can you do a tutorial on the new Anastasia Prism pallet.
Would you recommend for a beginner the Kay Von D contour palette or the Anastasia contour palette??
People are Rude, shes so talented! And a different packaging has people this upset..im getting the original one and Im ok..Im not gonna die, I think my life can go on..jesus Christ...I care more about the shadows..Jaclyn if you ever see this..uggg people are gross with Jealously!! Like noone else tries to make money in this world...the drama gives me a fucking headache and that John Cuntchian I dont know the idiot who drinks the Tea and bitches about everyone...Hes so Jealous of you...ok thats all.❤❤
Sooo..... Can you try to do a wearable look using only halloween makeup? I think it would be amazing to see what you could come up with lol

Any new Youtubers want to support each other?? Subscribe to my channel and comment done on this feed and I'll subscribe back! xoxo
Jaclyn your puppies are so precious!!!! What is the breed? Also where did you get them from and for how much? Are they girls?
I love you jaclyn I am hoping to get your pallet for Christmas or my birthday since my birthday is November 21st and I can't wait to play with it again love you
I can't believe how many colors you used on the lid and it came out to such a pretty combination
I love everything. I love you, I love your makeup, and I love your back drops. Just keep doing you. I will literally watch any content you put out. I have bad anxiety right now and watching your video right now is the only thing I can do to help myself.
When you have hooded eyes and eyeshadow never looks this good :(
And your dog is snoring coz your voice and words are so pointless and boring
i am in love! so beautiful!
I feel like this would look so sexy and bombshell vibes with your hair down and waves or loose curls 😍❤️ wish you would have worn it down for the intro. Such a beautiful look! 📸🔮💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
People are hating her but admit it she’s really good on her every tutorial.
I curious why you started with black liner on your bottom water line?
What did you use on the bottom lashes?
Please answer!! How do you get such good pigment from eyeshadows? I use high quality eyeshadow including your palette (which I love) and nice brushes, and I still don’t get good color payoff from eyeshadows on my lid and outer crease!!
Can you do more videos using ur palette? Ita been a week since i bought ur palette but i want to know more what looks should i do
Such an artist! LOVE YOU ❤️
please do Halloween looks I love how you do yours and they always look so real love ya
Regarding your updated eyeshadow palette: After working on the product for 2 years you come out with an update less than a year after the launch?  So glad I didn't jump on the first one! Still better planning and going the extra mile for your subscribers would have been nice instead of trying to cut corners to save money. Debating whether I should even buy the new one, with all the drama surrounding it...
hey Jaclyn i just got me palette nd it is awsome  i was not a huge fan of your but now watching and using i am a huge fan of your well done nd congrats ....
Just a little bit, sprays face 10 times hahahaha
Love this. 💯🙌🏼
*douses self in setting spray* hahaha ily and this looks SLAYS
You got skills! 👏🏼
I’m sure it’s really difficult to use that backdrop, since it’s hard to color balance against it. I personally don’t like backdrops, just you in any room is fine. At some points during this video you turned orange. I think that without the backdrop it would’ve been easier to see all the colors in their true form just against your skin color.
Jaclyn! It is also a tradition of mine every October to watch Hocus Pocus (I grew up with it) and I would loooove to see your recreation of Sarah Sanderson's makeup (since she is my favorite witch) it would be soooo cool to have it as a Halloween makeup tutorial on your channel this year (with that same purple background, which actually reminded me of Sarah before u mentioned u were watching the movie)
You seem so tired in this video :( like your bummed about something. I miss your boss attitude and professionalism. The way you used to teach us make up with that raw energy you had was so amazing. Where you at Jaclyn?!
You should do a updated makeup collection and beauty room tour once everything is done
Omg the ending was THE best part. How you expect me not to scare easy if you just took me to see IT a week ago?
Jaclyn would you ever consider doing a video about being a makeup artist and what you would pack in your kit?
hey Jaclyn I've been a silent watcher for years and I've never really felt the need to comment before but with all the hate you have been receiving ( for being your beautiful self) I just wanted to let you know how much I love your videos and your personality. Your videos are something I watch whenever I'm feeling down and I really appreciate that. You keep being yourself girl! You rock!
I could copy this exactly and still would not get perfection like this!!!
I freaking love you!!Lol watching your videos have got me back into make up. since I have became a mommy I put it on the back burner and now I'm going to get my groove back. Thank You for saying FU to the haters and really motivating me to pursue my passion! Your amazing and I wish I could meet you seriously I would die lol
Love your necklace.....who’s the designer?
I love this look!!!
I normally prefer a natural backdrop but I’m loving this purple glitter! 🙌🏻💜
I really liked your early videos and think you are super talented. I own champagne pop and your morphe palette and think both are mostly beautiful. But lately, I've felt like you are creating and swirling a lot of drama. Of course, I understand that being a public figure brings a tidal wave of bull. But there have been some things lately where I feel like you're subtweeting and sub-snapping (is that a thing) to keep drama alive. Between that and your unwillingness to just leave the KL debacle at an apology instead of trying to justify your behavior, I've been left feeling like I'm watching a high school teenager. I know you'll probably never read this. But if you do, please know I'm not trying to be hateful or mean. I'm trying to speak to you as an adult and let you know my experience as a subscriber.
Love this look!!! I want your palette so bad! 😭😭😍
This is gorgeous!!  Those colors together...
I love the glitter backgrounds👌🏽
it surprised me when she used makeup geek blush, haven't seen her use makeup geek in a while. wish she would use more of there stuff still
Jaclyn this look is BOMB!!! Seriously one of my favs!!! Can you give me the list of brushes you used please & thank you!!! 🙏🙏🙏
I like the natural background... I’m not feeling the purple
Omg your not the only one who waits for hocus pocus all yeah girll , I wait for it too !! Ahhh I’m so excited to watch it this month , but I love you jaccc❤️
This is a CRAZY request/idea, but I have DARKKK brown eyes and I have a hard time livening up my eyes with certain looks and color schemes. I fall in love with so many looks you do, but then I do the same on my eyes and it just doesn't work for me. Would you ever try brown contacts? Then again if I had your eyes I would NEVER cover them, like organically and genuinely the most beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen 😍😍😍😍
i’m being dead honest
Can you do a glam black swan makeup look ?!
WHAT?!! I just FINALLY was able to order your morphe palette and YOU ARE CHANGING THE PACKAGING FOR ULTA!! I call it BS this is a shock to you when it took you 2 YEARS to get the crappy packaging done. #longtermsubscriber  #inkitchentable
Girl this look 😍😍  please do more looks with your palette !!!! I would love to see your creativity with it and ofc more smokey looks too!! Don't worry about people saying your showing off bc girl if I did a colab with morphe I would be screaming it from the mnt tops😉 hahah love you !!!!
Remember when kim k destroyed your reputation lol
YES!!! This felt like vintage Jaclyn! OG Jaclyn!! The silliness, the detailed tutorial, the crazy noises and sidebar thoughts, the outtakes...everything I’ve come to love you for! Your tutorials when you’re just having fun and being creative are my calm happy reset button. Thank you! 💕
People need to realize that the reason your eyeshadow looks like shit is because you don’t use transition shades. If you don’t gradually go from lighter to dark your eyeshadows don’t blend as nicely together. Anyone who is good at doing eyeshadow uses AT LEAST five shades to ensure shadows blend seamlessly into the brow bone and into each other
I love your tutorials, i wish i can do my make up like you
HOCUS POCUS playing in the background 🙌🏼👏🏼🙌🏼🖤😭
00
This is GORGEOUS
Yuck
Show us your makeup collection???
Congratulations on your new baby girls!!!!🐶🐶
Do some research it has been proven that metallic based grease leads to Ocular melanoma and unusually require a frontal lobotomy.
I loved this!!! So happy to have you back on youtube doing more tutorials! Love you Jaclyn!
Updated house tour please!!!!
Not many uploads recently
I 💟 purple 💜 u just amazing 👌🏻😍
Ill be in those theaters when its out
seriously this is like when annakin was transformed into DARTH VADER now its the FEMALE version
I wish Finn was a Jedi
Come on guys it's obvious Kylo will blow up Leia. \nCarrie Fisher passed away! \nSoooo that means they have to kill her off in the series some how because she cannot continue!\n\nOr a Storm Trooper did it?\n\nAlso from the looks of it Rey is the balance. \nI think she will have both light and darkness in her.
I'm just hoping we would've seen Galen Starkiller Marek as a part of the canon... Like Rey's father or something. His character was interesting, powerful and different. Now I feel like we only have characters incredibly similar to what we have seen. To over-simplify; Emo Vader, Black Solo, Female Luke, Hispanic Lando.... I mean, not that I'm a hater of these new movies by any means. I just feel they're very similar. Oh well, at least we're rid of Jar Jar.
I hope is not gone be bad like the last one
Its return of the jedi all over again\nLuke=Yoda\nRey=Luke (untrained)\nKylo Ren= Vader\nSnoke= Darth Sidious
Kylo  Ren: A weak version of Jar Jar
Why reveal so many major plot points?
Its so chilling to see Kylo exstened his hand to Rey...
I believe that Mark Hamill will get an Oscar Nomination.
Kylo is going to blow leia to hell. He already killed han, he will now proceed to kill leia (and since her death in real life makes it hard to include her in future movies).
In that last bit, Rey is talking to Luke in one of those caves they're always in.
I know I'm gonna cry when I see this. In Rogue One I cried at the end because of the animated Carrie. Now with this. I know I'll bawl like a baby.
why do I keep watching over and over and over and over again
Thumbs up, subscribed, and hit the bell! Thanks!
Visit the channel you support your channel. thanks you
So I think ray is obi-ones granddaughter also she could be apart of the old times where they had more power. Idk any ideas ppl?
What's Star Wars.is it like a tv show?
About time they released it
they made kylo ren a good guy in the movie 😝👎👎
I think Snoke is talking about Rey in the beginning.
Ray goes to the dark side, Finn goes in to bring her back he brings her back to the light. Kylo Ren  comes to the light side sees his mother then goes back to the dark side because the dark has already consumed him so he turns on the light side and Finn fights the Storm Trooper Commander for revenge and Ray fights Kylo Ren, wins but is left with a eye scar....
When Kylo says, Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you're meant to be, he's talking to Rey.
Is this really the last jedia?
lol it reminds me of the 2NE1 AON teaser. even the soundtrack.
Now this is pod racing!
Man, the Kylo Ren’s starfighter is totally awesome!
She turns evil at the end, nooooooooooo
NEW STAR WARS MOVIE
1:19 Leia looks as if about to smile.
1:41 Walker in the background. watch to the right of finn . youll see it on fire
1:40 not gonna lie, I kinda want to see the Traitor! stormtrooper get a rematch with Fiin instead of Phasma.
Luke daughter is the golden Jedi wow
I miss Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman i wish that Luke Skywalker could see his parents Anakin Skywalker and Padme Skywalker it would have been a amazing and emotional scene if they just talked to eachother i wanna see it like this:two spirits appears one young man and one young ladyAnakin Skywalker Talks: It saddens me to see you like this my son.Luke Skywalker Talks: F..... Father (luke starting to cry because he is emotional not only to see his father but to see him so young and peacefull)Anakin Skywalker Talks: im very proud of you my sonLuke Skywalker ................. he wants to say he misses them very much but he feels so broken he can't find the words to say something back to themPadme Skywalker smiles because she sees her son and how he grow old and says I love you my son we will allways be by your sideLuke Skywalker smiles and has hope in life again.
This trilogy is looking very similar to the old one. If you think about their role in the movie.\n\nRay = Luke\nLuke = Yoda\nKylo = Vader\nFinn = Han solo (kinda...?)\n\nBut i bet it will be great anyways :)
Ren do not kill your mom
I'm so excited to know there is one more amazing movie after this incredible movie
Can not wait to see this.
I soo excited for the film to come out!!!!
This is going to be good
The force is strong in this trailer
Can I just take the time to say, Rest In Peace Carrie Fisher. ❤️
I can't even. I am WAY too hyped for this.
So many people love STAR WARS you can tell by all the views, I never seen that many views before
I am using the force to get pinned. I am one with the force and the force will pin me, I am one with the force and the force will pin me. I am one with the force and the force will pin me.
Now I feel like Ima get killed if I'm in the way of Rey.......
MY BRAIN JUST DIED!!!! SOMEONE HELP!!! 😱
What happened to all the Jedis?
Even when there is only 1 Jedi, hope is not one.
The force has evolved.
I think Leia will die and Rey will go to black side
The theatre experience is one thing......but taking it in at home is so much better for me. I won't be completely happy till the DVD comes out!
When leia dies, Luke skywalker Will be with her! Ghostly scary and sad
Whoever subs me, I will sub back with 2 accounts.
Guys i would really appreciate it if you go on my channel and watch my latest upload! i mixed the too star wars trialers about and created like a 3rd trailer! thanks!
way they have same titel
Let the past die \nI love this moment
May the force 🅱 with you
I swear to god if this is a rehash of empire strikes back I'm gonna lose it.
Is This Gonna Be The Last Movie???...Nooooooo!!!!
i can't wait
it is so exciting
I need some one
Duuuh ne sheeeeedah\n

AHHHHHHHHHH YESSSS
SPOILER!!!\n\nSomeone gets frozen in Carbonite!!!
That little creature with chewbacca looks awesome
Rey is a palpatine
Hope it was better than the last one
I don't really care for the new Star Wars movies
Meh let star wars remain a legend, stop running it for cash Disney
I need someone to show me my place in all of this\nLet me show you to the kitchen
Rey is not a Skywalker. \n She's also not the last Jedi.
I hate star wars. Fairytales
Why do a lot of people hate these movies? They are much better than the prequels
PRETTY SURE AT 1:53 IS kylo Ren not Rei, Kylo came out of water
I wonder who will play Princess Leia since Carrie Fisher died in 2015...
Hmmm is that an inner monologue for Kylo or is it possible he's talking to someone else.
Why would Disney make movies like that there's death and how is Kyle Reese still alive he was dead why would Disney make movies like that is this supposed to be a kids movie or no
I wish i could do that
why not write a book? maybe an autobiography?
Nice nile
Such an inspiring person with an amazing attitude and only good vibes!!\nCongratulation💪🏼
I love your dad😂
So dreamy....I'm in love....
You inspired me to trial for my schools gymnastics team
Would love to see ultimate gymnastics challenge mens vs woman's
I love the relationship you have with your parents, so cute! Just started watching your videos a few days ago, already hooked! You did great!
You've got a great attitude, fella. It's not about how big you win as how hard you try. Wish you and the team every success...
do you know who viktor trotter is he is a british gymnast and my friend also he is is a kid because he claims he has seen you
I'm a gimnastic too and u are my hero
I'm also 11 if you wanted to know
Nile do you know Ariana Berlin? There is a movie made inspired by her story. The name of the movie is called 'Full Out', but is the full out a real thing? If yes, can you show us the move?
Wow you did such an amazing job !!! 😱💙 congrats ... greetings from the US... I love your vlogs by the way !!!
Hi Nile\n\nI don't know whether you will know him but my dad is the chairman of bg so just wondering whether you know him
Could you do a backflip tutorial?
Omg you are the Best 😘😱
Congrats bro, im from leeds so really proud of you and glad you represents leeds around the world. Keep it up pal.

Nile so happy for you love youuu from spain
Congratulations on everything you have accomplished but I want a video seen you dancing
Love the intro song tom zanetti
Anyone else notice the my hero academia thumbnail??
Exceptional. Managing to perform at the top of your game in our sport and on YouTube. Inspiration to many
Do a gymnast vs. skier challenge! Much love
You are incredible, so inspiring. Congratulations from good old Leeds🎉
His dad is such a lad
You're the 6th best overall gymnast in the world, that's crazy to think
1:14 When you landed perfectly i was like: BRUH! (faint)
I wish you were in America I'm great at gymnastics and I really badly want you to be my mentor 😁😁
your dad ROCKS... hilarious 😉 No doubt your family keeps you strong
Nile you're a fucking Legend!
You bring light to a dark world Nile, thank you!  My best to your folks!
You should do a meet the team and do a Q&A with everyone on the GB team, both women and men
Make a video of trying volt without a springboard
Tbf your lucky you got 6th when competing against Kohei MOTHERFUCKING Uchimura. <3 u.
Hands down. One of the most boring people on YouTube. Get your top off and hope for views
You are the best Nile !! ❤️❤️
Yo mama's got some skills XD
I saw you on TV last night, you did great, and I'm proud of you!
Well done so many people look up to you including me your an inspiration💗💗
Amazing , well done Nile xx  hair looks sick when it's down by the way
The confusion my parents had when I kept asking Where's Nile?!.
Kinda looks like youre taking a dump in the thumbnail. Need to photoshop a toilet under you
Love watching you’re videos. They always make me smile and laugh till my belly hurts. Lol keep it up Nile! 😁
Another absolute phenom vlog!  I literally cannot get through a Nile vlog without a giant grin on my face.  Him and his friends/family just bring so much joy to everyone.
Cracking comeback after the injury, mate. Was rooting for you and delighted to see you made the world championships. Looking forward to see much more of your journey, Nile.
I've been a fan for a long time and it makes me feel so good to see you succeed and be so proud of yourself!\n\nEdit: Wow, that was really cheesy
Honestly, I need a GIF of you and your dad dancing 😂🙌🏼
So happy for you Nile, just found out your channel today! It feels strange to see all these talented people reunited in my hometown but at the same time it's great!\nCongrats again for both the finals and how you pushed through this year~
Fabulous!  Especially enjoyed the dancing.

I hope you have *all* permissions for any songs prior to uploading (even in the background)! If they have Copyrighted material your whole channel will get scanned and they'll claim the videos (all your future ad rev). Not a criticism, just a heads up! Loving the content my man
I'm weak and skinny so how do I get started???
I always wondered what that thing is in his intro. Is it a computer mouse or something???
It's possible to start gymnastic at 16 years?
Dear Nile, I am an 11 year old gymnast and just got a silver medal in a competition and I just wanted you to know that you are my sporting idol and that you are an amazing inspiration to me and you are a positive role model to anyone. Your talent is impeccable so keep it up!PS: I am apart of the body bible fitness group!
I just wanted to let you know that tomorrow I'm going to my first gymnastics practice in years and I can honestly say that it was because of you and your videos.
Nile, where do you live? I went overseas recently and your accent suddenly came to my mind, not sure why xD
Who tf is this guy?
I won National for Taekwondo and I’m in Kang’s Taekwondo. Now I’m National champion,but I can’t go to world because I’m not old enough. I’m only 8 and I’m supposed to be 12!
Nile I’m state champion in gymnastics Australia,Queensland
Is it just me or do Nile and Max not get along?
Congrats Nile! Killing it and inspiring. I actually liked this time though cos of Purvis' freestyle.
Nile how did you like Canada? And did you like us Canadians?
I am thinking of starting gymnastics again. I did gymnastics for 14 years. But i had quite because of my nursing education. Now i have some more time. Do you i should start again??
Congrats, Nile! Looking goood at the banquet. What did you wear?
OmG💙 Gahan one of the most beautiful voices ever !
Best DM song in years!! Ops... :D
Perfect, i love the athmosfere, the darkness, the sound of this song and obviusly my idol Dave <3 great job Kurt
Perfecto love this song 🤙🏻👌🏻
Dave could sing the ABC Song with this soft voice and it would sound sexy to me...wonderful song...pure electronic 🎹
just he voice dave it's so so nice
This Sound is very deep. \nThe Beat is very dark.  \nSometime we need dark and deep things in our Lifes.  \nBut if you sell yourself into the Darkness, you will never be the same Person anymore. It's your Choise, when you even sell your whole body and soul to the Darkness. Sorry Dave Gahan, but this is not my music and not my World. Satanic, Diobolic, whatever. Not every deep music is so dark like this Song, but l will only listen to the beauty of music itself. You have dissapointed me.
What a magical Song!! Kurt Uenala and Dave Gahan are a wunderful Team for pure electronic music
I have an absolute obsession with this song, I have no words  awesome
I don't need another Soulsavers album with Dave, I want new electro project with him !!! This song is simply perfect.
Holy shit, how fucking good was that.
Pretty nice and peaceful song. Especially the voice of Dave Gahan too, makes this even better 🎶
I love Dave Gahan and the versatility of his deep dark Baritone 😍. However, i do not like the video at all (saved only by the shots of Dave himself) . Disturbing....but not in a good way. I shall just close my eyes and listen............
What's the matter with all these morons commenting on Dave's demonic side because of the video??!!? Are you f..ing crazy?? 1) Dave has nothing to do with the concept of the video 2) his voice is a gift from God for all of us who have a soul 3) with what he's been through, no one - NO ONE - has any right to comment on his personal life 4) anyway, WHO CARES about moral implications??? Just listen and appreciate the music for what it is. Long Live Dave <3 And thax Kurt!
Excelente 😁
I think I got the idea of this video: she killed him so that nobody could prevent her from watching Dave and listening to his deep voice :)
Dave is very GOOD...but the music is 😞😩
Love it ....
Great song!
Fantastic!
Perfect! Thanks Kurt+Dave+Tim Team
Pure synth,  I am very happy that Dave done it again at his very best!! The electronic bass line is amazing!!!
One of the best songs 2017! The voice is legendary and the music/programming is breathtaking!!!
This is it :) Nice....
DAVE GAHAN is BACK to SHINE :'(
Дэйв любой трек сделает годным)
Waiting for the Aristokrasia version!
Love Gahan, love the rythm, love the visuals, wow!
I can't stop playing this, absolutely brilliant track thanks to Dave's gorgeous voice 😍😍😍
This track is amazing :)
I really love his wonderful voice. More - more - more!!!
I am really really loving this! Its sounds a bit like Black Celebration era Depeche Mode!
Wow wow wow!!! I can't explain how he makes me feel amazing vid so electronic beautiful mind blowing.They've done a great job together long live Dave & electronic music!!!
dave's divine voice kills me 💙
so beautiful. love it. thank u.
Fantastic ...Dave's voice is like a dream...music is so good and deep. A perfect collaboration. It's make you travelling in your mind and soul....Thank you for moving us so much
Your words were spoken Carefully chosen For me Each one a msg And insight To some degree   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can hear you All around me I feel free   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   Why am I nervous My hands they're shaking My heart it beats Your specter haunts me And taunts me I can't breathe   When I wake up My eyes are open I can see I can feel you All around me I can breathe   There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through There is comfort here Where I wait For you There is sunlight Shining through   We're moving on We're moving on
I loved them a long time ago but fuck me! As pretentious and as same as an album full of DM songs as you are ever going to find.😴
is it trevor or something
The best song of '17 until now
great  track, that  woman  is  really   Tall..  niice
Sounds like real synthy Depeche Mode, but here is very feeble non-catching refrain.
perfect description and personal evaluation...very successful,both the video,and the lyrics...❤️👑🖤
Dave could sing every song and make it famous and wonderful.. but his best is ONLY with Depeche Mode... from 1981 to 2017...
Oh Dave oH Dave   i 'll be waiting you
Amazing! Dave should be the front. It’s different then Depeche Mode by tons. This is the future
What the sound, what the powerful song was this. It will be becoming more popular  than i think.
waiting for Recoil feat. D.Gahan...
Electronic Music brought me here ✨
Masterpiece guys ! This is it !!!
wow amazing song with felling dark i love
This sounds like a B side from the SOTU record that should've been the first single 😐😧😳SHEEEEEEZE that was good
and THIS is what I expect DM music to sound like. perfect electronic stuff!
Great! I would like to be the deep underwater dancer for the next Dave Gahan video!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coh2Pwj6H6k
I just love it!!!!!!
Absolut Perfect voice of Electronic music
gorgeous and very sexy melody to this! i just saw depeche mode at the hollywood bowl and this fulfils my post concert sadness lol great stuff :)
I really love this track. If I didn't know I could have sworn that this is a Depeche Mode single!! So good absolutely!!
Love it Dave Gahan  the master voice.
love at first sight. :)
YES yes.🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤💕👍👍💕👍👍💖💖💖💖👍💕💕💕💕❤💕❤❤❤
Они не умеют делать плохую музыку и все тут! - They can't make a bad music and thats all! 
Increíble!!!
Leck mich am Arsch! Schweinegeil!
Great 😁
Sends chills down my spine
Dave's damn sexy voice!!!
INTRYGUJĄCE , \nA ZARAZEM PIĘKNE ...

Nice job. Perfect
Veľmi profesionálne spravene👍
Very Good!
Excelente, la voz de Dave exquisita y sensual y la música oscura pero muy fresca. Me encantó más que los singles de spirit
peccato per un video cosi' fuori luogo e truce
Bellissima la musica è la voce di dave sempre grandiosa e sensuale!! Questo pezzo è  travolgente! Lo adoro dal primo ascolto! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Słucham i słucham całkiem to dobre
LYRICS pleae. I love this song
I WANT THEM TO DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE..  or another song like fragile tension or in symphony they really need to go back to that sound or speak and spell to bring the 80's sound back at least one song like dreaming of me that was a real good song
The sounds at around 3:50 reminds me of the song/video Wrong.
Klingt ein bischen wie And One. Geil aber nicht einzigartig. Da wird sich doch wohl der Meister nicht etwa was von einem seiner größten Fans etwas abgeschaut haben...?
Dave genual!!!!! Mais no me gusto la violencia del video!!primera vez en mil años.que no quedo contenta.
worst song of 2017
Que video tan horrible !

This beat is fire
Man have no idea that's just a little bit just like a woman think/feel. \nWe're too complex to our own good. 😂
“I can’t win!” Lol, yea, that’s how we all feel. 😂
We have to stop joking about this shit.  My wife is a zombie because of the way she's treated at work (at PWC, btw...never work for them)
Standing up for yourself is commendable, but to assume all men, all companies are one and the same... That's not good.. We used to see that as overreacting... Because honestly there are men who will listen if you tell them how you feel, as you did with calling the presentation cute. We all hate the guys with small dicks who have lots to make up for, but don't say all guys are like that...
One does not simply get triggered over the word 'cute'. At least your boss liked it!
Cute female mouthpiece you have here.  Do you have to plug her in before you leave the office at night?
you would get fired in real life lol its so funny
Funniest part was when Kaity did a thumbs up
The punch line was obvious. It had to actually be a Cute presentation.
also that moment you have had experience being told to shut up on group projects in English projects that require us to analyze characters on your text because your analysis is apparently ignoring the suffering of the character because of their race/gender/sexuality when your analysis is simply summing up all the factors that make up their character instead of flattening them to this character was so sad because she was a woman and patriarchy
So, you're implying that dissecting every word someone utters to look for fault just leads to confusion and discomfort without actually accomplishing anything? You don't say.
and today I got to know that, her name is 'Rekha' , not 'Recca'. :D
Women are just property
No one thinks your cute ever but your fired now.
The insane duality, irony, contradiction and hypocrisy inside most female minds made manifest.\n\nNot sure if Rekha wrote this but it implies accurate introspection. That's exceedingly rare, very well done my girl. \n\nTaking the piss out of the insane. Hope to see more of you.\n\nAlso, nice tits.
*When you're a minority of literally any kind*\nUnless that's too tumblr\nNo, no, I mean it.\nBut it is borderlining sjw/racist at the same time and that leaves me with a deep internal conflict considering my own privileged upbringing...\nNope. Nope, I'm saying it, it's there. That's that.\nBuuuuuuuuuuuut...
This video was so cute that I think I'm gonna get fired.
The struggle is real. Impressively enough there is a struggle there.
Such an object\n\n\n\n\n(Its a joke) so just dont little salty...uuhh..person
Lol this killed me with laughter
Literally did not laugh once, not even a little nose laugh
All this showed me is that feminists are indecisive and not willing to take a compliment.
Bipolar/schizophrenia skit how is this funny? The only funny part was when she jumped out of the window
Stop being a feminist
rekha shankar is an indian name
Like a lot of the new College Humor Sketches, this is so relatable until the last bit, then it goes a little overboard to make it comedy... \n\nWell done. Now for a male version of this
I finished the video and was like. Cool. Where was the funny part?
Standing Up For Yourself as a Woman, But Not Too Much
what's the song played in the inspired parts?
such a hilarious commentary on a very current and important issue. thank you
This is what it would be like with a woman president...
''Mimimi this joke is like 0.02% serious mimimi sjw mimimi buzzfeed''\nHoly shit, just unsubscribe already and never come back.
That was really cute
I come back to this skit multiple times a day bc it's that good.
A... good video on conflicting impulses as a woman when faced with something that comes across as sexist, the fact that easy answers aren't provided, and that sometimes comments really *can* be innocuous in context, which some of the less experienced or more strident voices tend to ignore. I... have a feeling I'm reading it differently than a lot of people here, though?
7 comments in and people are already complaining about tumblr
Oh no not Rake-ah from the mispronouncing names.
If anything this draws on indecisiveness as being a female trait, since it's clear she can't make up her mind!
Now is the time to stop acting like BuzzFeed. Nobody likes Buzzfeed, but we do like you College Humor... Don't make us dislike you, please.
THIS IS SO ACCURATE
Wow! Buzzfeed? Where did you come from? It's been a long time since I have seen one of your ridiculously idiotic videos. Wanna go get some coffee together...or go out to eat...maybe see a movie? 
I don't understand what it's trying to do
Remember when college humour was funny. The good old days.
Modern day feminism in a nutshell.
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool thank you guys so uch for this amazing chhanel and video
WHO IS THE GUY IN THE GREY SUIT OH MY F GOD
You guys could post a video of just a piece of dogshit and all these idiots would still think it was funny
This video was cute, but one thing it wasn't... funny.
This video is the definition of fucking cancer.
Where's the humor?  Boring nonsense!
Cause you're a BIG stinky MAN
Is this how comedians see board room meetings. Lol cute.
A very accurate alternate title to this sketch could be When Keepin' it Real, Goes Wrong. 😂 (ref hint)
Lol, the billboard in the background with Katie on it.
And then she joined buzzfeed
Its not up to you to decide what your boss thinks of your work just like if people think you're an asshole its not up to you if people think You're an asshole
Humorous but very on point.  Well done!
When she shoved her bag in his face LOL Say goodbye to this
Oh my god very revolutionary very progressive you guys at college humor really made a difference this time!
One of the better scripts in recent months
Thought i was about to be in for another sjw filled shitfest by college humor. Still a shitfest, but at least it made feminism look like a bigger shitfest.
This better be fake
This is stupid and sexist and sooo stereotyped like wtf we're your sources college humor also men have to apologize and this is a great example of how women are. Also it's funny how it says we don't know what Unfair is but by we I mean men which is retarded
When she’s outside you can see an add with Katie saying “Drink Splish”
I'm just hear to see Katie's T&A, so this video pretty much sucked.
More unfunny feminist garbage about exaggerated or non-existent problems.
Feminism be like
Lol
Well at least rehka got some titties
This was just weird, Rekha
Katie approves.
I hate feminist
Wait.... This isn't buzzfeed
That Katie reveal.
Relatable
very funny
cringy
Rekha is shit
Me
Youre fired
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😂
Why was this relatable?
OFFENDED lying feminists lmao
Trigger warning
Bipolar disorder
AHAHAHAAHAHA women always apologize smh
@ Rekha...what's poppin 😍😍😜😘😘
facts
Hey @CollegeHumor\n\ni know you have Rekha for diversity points, but you are ruining what people liked college *Humor* for.\n\nHumor.\nnot politics
Women ALWAYS have to apologize This... has not been my experience in real life.
I don't really like how you guys are starting to make videos like this - you're starting to look a little like Buzzfeed and that's the worst thing for your company. I really enjoy your old school risque comedy but understand that the algorithm probably wouldn't allow for that. Just something that isn't to do with social politics would be great, I think it's why most people watch you guys, because you don't usually touch on these kinds of topics which is rare to find on YouTube these days.
I bet none of you have even been to a real meeting. Its doesn't happen like this you SJW
Don’t know if I should hit this with the Slow claps 👏 or hope that she gets fired.
Oh my God....PLEASE go back to being FUNNY!
You know I used to think people who thought CollegeHumor and BuzzFeed were similar were silly, but as the days go by, they continue to advance into their direction. I am disappointed
First world problems, many woman out there don't have the right to have high end jobs or the have right to speak. These are personal problems
Woman have the same rights
Probably best one yet
This was AMAZING
Chewbacca's face actually looks raw and unfinished
1:41 Who’s that handsome devil?
Kylo Ren you are the second character to break Star Wars tradition.  Don't say the actual title in a sentence in your own dimensional universe.  😂You only use the title at the introductory of each story without actually saying it unless it's an audiobook.  After that keep it %101 anonymous while the stories are being told.😅
1:42What the hell man relax!😂😂😂😂
When I first saw the force awakens, I hated kylo. Now due to you guys he's my favourite character!
Tyrion kills his father????? WTF KYLO THANKS FOR THE SPOILER
Dr. Emmett Brown: There's that word again RAW! Why is everything so raw in the future, is something wrong with our ability to shower?
What's Christmas?  I lost it
That right..there be no making up or saying I hate so cause i ducking hates you, hide and run away to my apartment and never call you again and only text for money which mine anyways and my mom trying to change me back into the little girl I was and I say no mom..you don't know Dad
yep Kylo Ren your my boy I'm rooting for you man
I need someone to show me my place.\n\n\nYeah in the ground
Why is this trailer so raw?\nBecause that's how the Old dirty bastard likes it.
Every time he laughs I lose it
Yes I love these
*THERE WILL BE NO TRUCE* more  evil laughter *WHOA TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW?*
I mean you say it's 100% certified raw...but is it organic too?
What's christmas? Lost it. XD
this is my new favorite thing on the internet
I thought Kylo would be a Reylo shipper. In the ground not in my bed?
These are the greatest videos ever 👍
Hey a good idea for the future would be to do a 10 things that would make star wars better like you did with the hobbit
Please let *_RAW_* turn into a meme
I'm more excited for the new Jedi Party than the actual movie
This is a good gimmick you have here. Might as well have Kylo Ren reactions to various trailers and commercials; including outside of the Star Wars franchise...if you can let us vote or decide in the comments sections then you can draw real hype to this channel.
Star Raws:  The Last Jedi
3:00 Thumbs up to all the pervs who saw this little bit of humor. Apparently our boy Kylo likes some Suicide Girls action.
I can't wait for Kylo to see Blade Runner 2049 and go you're still alive!?
I really  enjoy  the Kylo  Ren, I  would  to  see  how  the Hitler reaction  to the Last Jedi  is going  to be  like.
THIS STEAK IS SO RAW, SUPREME LEADER SNOKE WANTS TO TRAIN IT TO USE THE FORCE!
How about in the ground? Lol 😂 (extends hand) what!?? Hahaha
The Auralnauts are 100%  Absolutely Positively Without a Doubt Certified Midichlorified Gugu Mbantha-RAW!\nWhat's Christmas? Lol\nAlso, is that Baby Time playing in the credits?
This shit is so fucking good holy fuck! CLASSIC!!! THUMBS UP!!
The only react videos that matter are from Kylo.
The Suicide Girls at the end....so raw!
That was so Awesome and funny.  I liked how he said this was in the future.  My favorite was when it first switch to Rey.
These vids never cease to get a giggle from me lol 😂
I'm so raw!!!
2:48 is the part you want to see.
lol!!! i love how he shouts out Whaaat?!!! and that laugh
2:44 ''How about in the ground'' LMAO
This reaction is raw
Gordan Ramsey is super pissed at how raw this trailer is.
This video was so RAW
What the hell man, relax.
I hope he still reacts to stuff unrelated to Star Wars after Star Wars is over.
It's baby time
I'm really disappointed that weenie doesn't seem to be in his helmet for most of the movie.
“I need someone to show me my place in all of this...”\n\n“How bout in the ground?”\n\nLost it.
I need someone to show me my place...\n*points to the kitchen*
I heard lady Gaga really liked this trailer. In fact, she said it was raw raw raw raw  rawwwww.
Chewy is Da Best HAHAHAHA That is All
I'm glad you like it Kylo
You should make videos of Kylo watching other trailers other than Star Wars. 👍🏽
🅱aw
RAW!!!!!!!! Love it!!!!
RAW!!
Fresh.
“What’s Christmas?”

90K VIEWS AND TRENDING? HMM I KNOW OF SEVERAL PODCASTS WITH 500K VIEWS IN ONE DAY THAT AREN'T TRENDING.... \n#YOUTUBEBRIBES
Is that Adam Driver?  I can't tell the difference lol
Yay, Ryan's Cooking Show! 10/10!!
omg Ryan's Cooking Show pls make this a thing!! with cheesy music and everything!
I am REALLY impressed by that transition at 5:07 Grace, well done!\n(I genuinely love you guys' creativity and content in general, but this one just really stood out to me...)
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Big spider??  It's so spindly!  Just a cellar spider; totally harmless.
I see Ryan likes spices, garlic and basil. An handsome englishman who likes mediterrean ingredients?\nActually that nice pasta is some kind of Amatriciana, rather than Carbonara. They both have bacon inside but they are totally different; i adore them both anyway.
I think He is good at cooking. Great
Good day to you madam
Mmm, I want Ryan's cooking
Love you guys! Xx❤️\n\n\n\n\nAnd your vlogs! Xx❤️
Ur vlogs r so cool
4:00-4:08 vibes 😂 same
ryan's so funny :D
Fumbs up!
Wow!\nHow old is the building?\nLooks quite old.  Lots of work.
Yay, food! but what is 5:23?
What's that white paste he squirts out of a tube? He used it last time too. Mayo? Some UK thing?
reminds me of my first love :>

How old is she !?
love the world mental healthy day sign. 💚💚💚 I recently was diagnosed with anxiety. It’s not bad, but it’s there. Enough to hurt me. Dan, I pray you find hope throughout your journey of healing. 💚
What do you actually do for exercise?
why did I start crying
A bit of a furry?? He's infected!!\nONE OF US!! ONE OF US!!\n...yea I'm pretty depressed too
I spent 1 hour thinking of something to comment. But\nI still cant think of anything.
Dan thank you for making this video! Its so important to speak up and seek for help.
I've had all depression symptons,\nWhich interfere with my life violently.\nIt's been like this for 1 and a half years.\nDo i have clinical depression?
i know i'm like half you age maybe a bit less BUT i'm proud of youuuuu
I relate to this so much woah
Holy shit Daniel you're a gym lad
I have been depressed for over 4 years now. Figured it all myself but didnt know how to ask for help until last year. Since then I've been on medication which helped a lot. Your way of describing the whole thing is so on point. Thank you for making this video, as I'm sure it'll really help people, who like me, thought they're alone in this. Thanks dad
I luh you, dan. 🎸 I ain't never gonna stop loving you, dan. 🎸
Dan i know this is irrelevant, but i met you in 2016 on your London tour. (You made like 3 seconds of eye contact with me) I got your Merch while i was there, years later my hamster Alan keeps nibbling on my Phandom bracelet and i dont know what to do
Yep, ya daddy!
Thank you
We take the same meds
From the very beginning, I had severe anxiety as a kid. From the beginning of highschool til now, I have severe depression. I have let these things consume me forever and I’m just now starting to make a change. Without the support of my family and friends, I wouldn’t be who I am today. I don’t know if I would even be here. I’m glad at least one youtuber is open about this and isn’t afraid of people judging them because they know in their heart they are doing the right thing. I’m very proud of you Dan and my love for you has grown majorly. And now everyone in the comments is sharing their story and getting so much support. So again, Thank you. From one human to the next. <3
You are one of the people I literally fully relate to.
Super proud of you Dan
Thank you so much for this, sharing your experience really helped. :)
Can you please shove all of my citalopram down my throat, thanks .
Mannnnn I love you loads thanks for this
This was suggested to me by a friend on framecast it made me feel better could you maybe make a video on how to open up to people about depression
Depression is my current issue. This really helped.  Thank you.
Woah can thanks for speaking up about this.....this means so much to me and I think it means so much to every one else too
Dan, seriously. I think everyday that I'm worthless and pointless. Once I saw this video I realised to not let it get worse. I told my parents and I'm going to get help. Thank you, honestly.
Dan: don't listen to me, listen to the professionals\n*Doctor Dan spins on chair* \nMe: BUT I THOUGHT I WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO LISTEN TO YOU?!
isolation while being depressed is no joke it feels like the cozy darkness is calling again.
I havewnt been professionally diagnosed but I think I have either Cyclothymia or dysthemia... Cyclothymia makes a lot of sense cuz its a type of bipolar disorder which runs in my family... One minute you can feel empty and the next you can be cracking jokes and smiling from wear to ear... I also have anxiety and suicidal ideation... Mixing those three together is chaos waiting to happen... Itsf like I'm a ticking time bomb waiting to explode and have an anxiety attack... Then I'll go to not feeling anything but emptiness for maybe an hour then go back to normal... If I didn't have my sister and my best friend who also know what I'm going through since my sister has bipolar disorder, insomnia, and a lot of other shit... My best friend suffers from, depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and schizophrenia...
I want to thank you because I have depression now and it’s very hard for me and you make me somewhat happy and Phil two so I would just like to say thank you dan
For some reason I watched this at work and now I'm about to cry at my desk. Something about this video touched me. I think it was just very honest and matter of fact, and said everything that really needed to be said. So thanks for saying those things, Dan.
Im actually depressed... This video actually made me happy for a few minutes ive been seeing therapists they have been trying but you and only you cheer me, thank you.......
Dan ❤️ you sharing your story is actually so validating 🌸
as someone who has had anxiety for years, seeing a counselor really really helps
So proud of you for sharing this. We all support you and thanks for being truthful. It’s hard to tell the truth to even yourself sometimes, so several million people is very brave. I don’t know how to articulate this, I just wanted to thank you for making this video. It must have taken a lot of courage.
To be honest this want a shock...like at all....
Dan you are so brave for sharing this, I’ve been battling depression for a year now so i know how you feel, i think that you sharing your experience with depression opens up a new perspective on it
How often do you have to feel to depressed for it to be deppression? And how long does it have to last?
Thank you thank you thank you so much. I can’t express my gratitude for you and your videos enough. I’m so grateful for especially this video as you’ve finally put all this emotion into words.
i really want to get better because i relate to this video a lot but first idk where the heck to start and second of all i’m scared to be better? like i’m so used to feeling down and panicky all the time
I just got back from the hospital for OD'ing. I was on life support... I've dealt with depression for years, most of my life... This gave me a bit of hope. Thanks.
Fill the whole with pizza XD
Omg I'm crying. This is me. How have I never realized it before? I could be having a great day and all of a sudden a wave of depression will sweep over me and I can't do anything. I can't feel anything. I just... Thank you Dan. I'm gonna go talk to someone.
When I first told my family, it wasn't consensual. My counselor made me take a test for depression, and i scored way too high. way. too. *high.* but y family told me i was lying, and i didn't have any issues. I smiled and said fuck you i have my rights and persisted towards a therapist. it's been four years since then. i've discovered a lot about myself, including illnesses i didn't even know i had. i learned how to cope with my thoughts, and what to do when everything melted away, including my morals. i'm far from close to being done with this fight. freedom is a long way coming, and due to the load, the light at the end of the tunnel is temporarily shut down. but it's okay. i know, in the end, it'll be worth it. if we had no bad days, we wouldn't know what a good day truly is. this stuff isn't me, but it shapes me. in a way, i'm grateful for it.
daniel, thank you. this honestly helped loads...
i probably have a mental illness but wont go to a doctor lol im serious
Dan, even though I don't know you and I have never met you, I still love you and I care so much about you. And this goes for everyone. I myself, do not know how you feel, but I know people that do. I know that still doesn't compare to how you feel, but as a friend, I hope that everyone in this world knows that someone loves and cares for them. You help so many people and I just hope that this comment helps you and others too. I love you so, so much!!
I'm just so proud of Dan, and how far he has come and how strong he is. Thank you Dan for making this world and youtube a more open and kind place.
I feel this. For me though, it’s my existentialism that kicks in and I feel like nothing matters. Which is terrifying, because my biggest fear is living a pointless existence. I am currently on medication for my bipolar and chronic depression, but it persists. And it makes me kind of want to die. Like, if death is a fire escape, it’s a way to get away from life if it catches fire. The only problem is, it feels like my life is always on fire. Like, what’s the point in living if I’m just becoming my worst fear? I don’t want to just exist without meaning, but when we die, nothing we’ve done in life ever will matter. So what’s the point? (Sorry for the slight rant)
im so fucking proud of you
Hey, can you make a video about your love for furries- thanks
I relate to this so much, I used to think that it was just my personality as well. Gosh I could go on and on about what I've experienced and how I relate, but I'm not gonna go there, Luckily, I've been in therapy for a year or so now and I've been making great progress. I'm really glad that you've uploaded this video because it's so honest and real and inspiring! Thanks, and I really love your videos Dan! 💕
i was having a hard time earlier this year, i had moved countries and schools. I also had bad memories from school the year before, my mum decided to take me to therapy and it helped, I only ended up going once and then another time to see how i was feeling. after the first session i felt a lot better to just get it out and have a talk about it. I know that people struggle with things more intense everyday which must suck so much. I felt emotionless and just stuck in a hole once, it was so weird. One night I just wasn't motivated and I basically knew how dan had felt when he was describing it but i never felt it again. I was scared i was getting depression but it passed over. Seek help if you are struggling though, it can make a difference to your life.
Actually just cried because I felt so guilty for not telling anyone about my depression/suicidal thoughts, Thanks Dan now I can ride my pizza out of the hole. :)
Im still dealing with depression evey single day but thanks to you and Phil that my days can get better, even if its a bit. So thank you and you probably wont ever read this comment but just so you know, you are incredible and strong and even if Im not it makes me so happy that you feel better now
Proud of you. And of anyone who speaks up. What comes into the light loses it's power over us.
Dan, we may not know or ever know what you are going through, but I want you to know that I care so much and there are so many more people that care too. If you ever need help or anything we are here. Just know you are never alone. Never forget because we’ll never forget you. \nBest- \nMaja Cvijanovic
I went to a theripast for 2 months and almost everyday she'd ask my why I was depressed and I never knew why and I thought something was wrong with me for not knowing why, I'm just happy I'm not alone with not knowing why I get depressed
having depression this is amazing to hear that someone that is so popular that has it. It makes me feel like i am not alone and it gives me courage to know that it will get better
I've only just recently became a fan of Dan (hey that rhymes!) and this is one of the first videos of his that I've seen. You don't know how much I appreciate you making this video. I will not be ashamed to say that I suffer from bi-polar, anxiety and chronic depression. Dan is right, it is a daily struggle that you have to fight. Thank you for speaking out about this Daniel and I can't wait for more content and I'm happy to be apart of the fandom :)
Oh Dan Dan 😭 we love you
It wasn't untill after high school(been free for 2 years lol) that I realized that I didn't actually experience the emotions I portrayed and that i felt exactly like  my clinically depressed friends. Around that time I actually found your videos. And I just want to say that this incredibly brave and strong of you to do and I truly admire that.
thank you for making this. The points you talked about are so important for people to understand about depression
daniel you helped me go through many many years of depression, you still do. im so glad you feel enough comfortable to tell us, and im so so proud of your progress- you're an inspiration in so many levels, even from before you share this, i just saw your progress as a human, how you grow and found yourself and it just inspired to found myself, it keeps inspiring me to finally say im stable so thank you, thank you a lot for sharing, thank you a lot for being strong, thank you a lot for being such a great role model. thank you for helping me. thank you.
I'm going to be completely honest. I saw the title of this video, and it has taken me multiple days to watch it. It scared me. The truth scared me. It honestly feels good to not be alone. Thank you Dan, haha. I defiantly needed this. Thank you! I love you, so much! Keep going! We are all here for you! I LOVE YOU, WHEN YOURE SAID REMBER ME, RAVEN WESLEY LOVES YOU. haha 😂😍
My depression is kinda like Dan's. I feel like I'm sitting in an inescapable void but I don't have negative thoughts. I don't think at all. My mind is just a terrible blankness with the worse numb feeling echoing through it. Or I'm just super angry and want to put my hand through a wall. I'm on medication now but thank you for opening up to us. I'm proud of you and I'm glad you're in a good place now (:
Same dan I'm here with you the fans are with you
Could you talk about anxiety?
Can we just appreciate the fact that even though mentally he was going through a lot, Dan continued to make stuff to make us happy :) I'm really proud of you Dan and I hope you realize the magnitude of people you've helped who are dealing/have dealt with mental health issues.
it will get better in a little while they said\n\nit's been four fucking years\n\nwhy is there no rainbow?\n\nbecause for some people, it stays for a long time and it's dreadful.\n\ni hate it.\n\nthe worst part isn't that it gets in the way of things, but that you keep thinking that it's gonna get better tomorrow, that you'll make it through on your own, when the brutal truth is that it takes something that will change your life permanently and that something is usually actually rather someone.
Ummm well sooo I have depression and well it sucks. I relate to you so much. Except when I’m depressed I go into a episode of complete shutdown. Kind of like you. I lay down while thoughts race threw my head. My head will then start hurting at this point I just curl up and cry my self to sleep. It’s crazy because I have people who love me but it doesn’t help. Not to mention the Anxiety I get. I start shaking then I can’t breath. And it’s like a elephant is laying on me. Sometimes they both happen at once and I’m not only in a dark place of unrationalness but I also can’t breath....I have delt with this since I was little. I’ve learned to cope but all in all I hope it gets better. And I do talk I guess it will just take time.
This made me feel better because you made it seem like a physical being which makes it seem easier to fight
after having some really bad anxiety attacks and depressive episodes i would watch your videos to cheer myself up. you're someone whos always inspired me to keep going and im so proud of you for talking about your experience. thank you so much for everything ❤️❤️
Every second of this was so relatable, its good to know I'm actually not a crazy person and other people are actually going through the same stuff lol
You're not gonna get a personal story from me. However, I've stopped cutting. The way I've stopped is drawing on my skin with skin safe markers and (a less-safe way that I'm not exactly proud of) using a rubber band to snap my wrist, compensating for the pain of cutting.
I love you dan. Thank you for being there whenever I needed you
Im still on the anti depressants 3 years, but I still get depressive spells once a month of sometimes once a week. I feel like Im dependent on the drug, my life is better, I'm doing all the things to stay afloat. But I feel like if I go off them I will relapse, how do??
I have depression and I'm still having to deal with it. But whenever i see some of these videos i stop frowning and feel a little bit better but then i fall back into my depression state
*So glad you addressed this subject! Good luck with your journey Dan, you are doing great!!! Xo*
Whoever is reading this, I hope you're all okay. \nThank you Dan for your video and I'm really proud of you.
I have social anxiety disorder & clinical depression.
depression runs in females on my moms side. mine was “activated” when i was 13 when my Great Grandma died. i’m almost 18 now and i still take meds for my depression.
Recently, thanks to the health issues I've been having with my teeth, I've discovered that I've had anxiety disorder. I've always been a person with a little more than average anxiety in certain situations, but it reached a point that I was unable to go to sleep or get out of bed. I kept crying, feeling sick and having so many thoughts about how different people were coping with these kinds of things and I couldn't, etc. I'm still going through it, but it's getting better. I can say that I'm a more functional human being now. So maybe I can take your advice on daily life and exercise now, Dan. Thank you.
Hey Dan, I've been watching your videos for years, and they were always really relatable, especially when my depression was at its worse. I've suspected you were also depressed because of how relatable you were to me, and I'm happy to see you accepting that part of your life and using your experience to help others! I'm sure we'd be great friends in different circumstances :) (like living at least on the same continent, and you being less famous and seeing this comment haha)\nCheers!
Dan and everyone else who has depression you have my full support
I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression a few months ago, but I've had them for a lot longer than that. Lots of people (including my mom) don't understand that mental illnesses can affect you just as much- if not more- than physical illnesses can. It's so discouraging... :(
Fuck depression man...
I love you!!
thank you....
I have crippling depression
*YA DADDY*
ily
Me too...
Everyday
Depression wow \n\n\n\n\nI hate it
girl, same.
Protip
Depression in 2017 is worse than in insane asylums in the 1950's.
I’m still fucking depressed why won’t Death come

Without Eriksen Tottenham are nothing trust me. Any striker who plays week in week out will score plenty of goals for that team, maybe not as much as Kane but Eriksen just runs the game.
One can understand why, the players like him.. He is a very normal and clever guy on football..
Keep ArseAnal under keep Wenkar IN!

I had a problem with a neighbours cat, which used my garden as a toilet.  I made an almost identical box but put a PIR on it so that the cat got sprayed anytime it walked past.  I'm guessing the cat didn't like it very much, because he took his business elsewhere.

Why make one when you can just buy the parts and put them together for cheap? Oh he did...
I think it's possible you have misunderstood the way to wire up that board. Normally you don't have to connect anything from the PWR IN to the three relay connections. Your wiring of the relay connections is unusual and may be the root of your problem. So, one solenoid contact goes to battery ground, but the other goes just to N/O and NOT to N/C. When your signal reaches the unit, the contacts switch over and the solenoid gets power. You might want to try it
You should make a mini bike (taco bike)

I basically started doing comics on Snapchat, and people find it amazing! So once I get a drawing tablet, I'm gonna start animating! (Hopefully)

Anna’s Bianca voice is hilarious 😆
Thanks for the official hand shake Jonathan. Lol😊🙂😄
This world is shit 😐
Irish sounds like a language I can speak called Gaelic
Jonathan is such a good dad
Anna was so funny in this vlog, I just love her xxx
I'm so happy that at the start of the video they gave me an answer to my geography homework and we had to know what Budapest was the capital of 😂😂😂
Jonathan is the best!
Anna I think you lost your bonkers hahahaha love you guys
I just love Anna
HAAA!! Anna's Bianca's voice is everything
I’m from Hungary 😊living in Uk 😊

As soon as he said #nevercopyanother I Started to copy someone
if you go to bing type in yotube and search at the nside there is a little picture of you guys the saconyjolys
Eduardo's laugh is the best !
Hahaha I love Anna’s bianca voice they are sooooo funny
When Johnathan was talking about those muffins all I could think about was that scene from mean girls; would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin? 😂
Love love love Anna doing that voice over for the dogs!! 😂😂
Alessia might be the happiest little human on earth 😂❤
Omg anna you kill me with the dog voices it's hilarious! Really looking forward to meeting you guys in Milton Keynes in a few weeks!
I love you guys so much! Such amazing parents ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a big inspiration Jonathan! Your story will help so many people. I love your family and have watched for over a year now 💗💗
Hahaha I love them their so Funny 😂 Jonathan is so brave also
I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
I'm sure your story will help some other people☺. Peace to you.👍
That voice and clip though.... genius !!!!!
loving the photo in the background at the start, little squid.
So so proud of your bravery, Jonathan ❤❤❤
Anna is so funny, she had me dying in her Bianca voice
Jonathan you are so brave! Anyone who knows you is lucky to have you as a friend
Eduardo is THE sassiest little man and I am in love.
I love love love when Alessia flaps her arms and makes that joyful breathing noise! I just LOVE it and it makes me so happy. #precious
What a coincidence, I missed these videos because I was on a cruise as well.🛳
Anna, why don’t you just take an umbrella with you!!
You are such an amazing human Jonathon xxx
I want to see Eduardo take over the vlog for a day!
God Bless you,  Jonathan.  I can tell how hard that was for you to talk about. I was almost sexually assault when I was 6 by a close relative.  I ran away so nothing ever happened,  however it still haunts me every now and then.  It took me years to tell anyone about it. I'm not sure why,  because nothing happened.  I guess I was just ashamed and that it was my fault for trusting this person.  Just know,  that you're not alone.  I've told my husband and kids what happened and the loved me even more.  Im not sure how I would have felt if I hadn't ran away.
I freaking LOVE Bianca and her funny voice and EVERYTHING I can't with Bianca
Out you will feel better....
Don't ignore signs of this happening to your children.
Anna needs to do a whole video just in the dogs voices. I love it !!
The fAct that you told people what  happened is incredibly brave, inspiring...and shows a LOT of strength...i hope it helps others who have sadly been in your situation...even if they don't feel so alone 💚💚 my heart breaks thinking of how many people have been victim of sexual assault 😢💚
I like how that, despite the fact that you probably had a rough day when you released that video, you remained positive and happy for your kids. I know how hard that is. I have severe anxiety and it’s sooooo hard to be happy for anyone or anything. I don’t have kids but as hard as it is for me to remain happy during anxious times as a single adult with no kids I can only imagine how hard it must be to remain strong in front of your kids when you’re feeling crummy. I’m so sorry about what you went through Jonathan. I’m so happy that you have Anna and the kids to remind you that you’re a great person and Dad and to keep you on your toes and help you get this off your mind.
Alessia seems like such a happy well behaved baby all the time ❤❤
Anna is literally the funniest woman in the world! Love her to bits! I aspire to that woman!!! 💕
Anna couldn't look more beautiful 😍😍
I'm so proud of you for sharing your story. It's so important to open a dialogue for men to discuss their stories too.
Jonathon you helped me with that video you put up as a survivor myself... I admire you so much for speaking up ❤️ I’m coming to see you guys at the baby event at olympia next weekend 😀💙
Hahaha that was the best promotion for innocent 😂 Anna's bianca voice is my fave thing ahhaha amazing!!!
I'm glad you told your mom. I am very sure that the video you posted about your terrible experience helped so many people. You are brave And supported by so many.
Omg lmao Anna's accent for Bianca was everything lol so funny!!!
This video proves that some viewers jump to conclusions way too quick and it proves that no, we viewers don't really know anything because there's so much going on behind the scenes so who are we to speculate. I'm saying this because I was scrolling through the comments of yesterday's video and I saw people being mad about him not telling his mom before putting out the video. So this is for all of you. In your face.
Anna doing the dogs voices is the best. Dying for an episode of the dogs voiced by Anna.
I love when Anna voices the dogs 😂😂
OMGosh, I love that exasperated little breathy laugh that Alessia does when she's excited. Its much too cute!! 😍😍\nAwwww, ballet with Daddy!! How fun!! 💚💜💛\nI love the ending, haha!! When you talk for them its hilarious!! The little Bianca knit was so cute too.
It could be the newer food you’re feeding the pups, that’s causing the staining on their faces.
Jonathan  we can all\nappreciate your courage! Your a wonderful example of strength and character. Your family respects and adores you as do hundreds of viewers. So thank-you for your bravery and bringing another truth to the pitiful silence of sexual assault!
Jonathan you are an amazing man, husband, father and friend to all of us. You are a brave brave man because not any man would have the guts to tell the world something like this. We love and support you. You are amazing because you didnt let this awful experiemce take over your beautiful peronsality, your ability to love and be happy. You are one of the few most amazing husbands a girl could ever want so loving and thoughtful to your wife, kids and friendlist friends !! WE LOVE YOU JONATHAN !!
Ur amazing for sharing ur story

Wow Anna...you look that this is such a struggle to get you child.  Whine...Whine...Whine...oh  my head hurts...  When are you going to be a nice person and parent?
Well done for speaking out Johnathon, that can't have been easy to do. Anyone out there who sees this and has someone in their life making them do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell someone, a parent, a friend, a teacher, a sibling, a doctor, anyone and don't stop talking until someone helps you
This video is Clickbate
I don’t even know what the dislikes are thinking!!! This is so brave of you Jonathan 🌎
I AM FROM GERMANY.PLEASE TALk SLOW.LOVE THIS FAMILY.KISSES
I was also sexually assaulted at the age of 6 I’m 13 now but I’m just wondering if I ever have kids wether I would tell them, so are you ever going to tell them?
Boring unintelligent narcissist parents parade their children for YouTube views shocker

You're so great. Loved the vid

Why goodbye to monetisation when using fake blood?
Adore this! Love that you went for a full gore look but still managed the glam as well 😅 also noticed that you sound the same as you did in your early videos (maybe you were shyer then) probs because you could hardly move your mouth 😅💕
This is great and from what I have seen, original. I thoroughly enjoy your videos.
I laugh so much with your comments!!! You rock!! Xoxoxo

Love love that straw effects you created!
I loved Logan and Children of Men is one of the best films ever made, so I had a lot of fun putting this one together! *What films would you like to see me tackle in the future?*\nAlso, if you happen to be looking for stock footage for a project and want to help support LFTS, check out the 7 day free trial of Videoblocks: http://bit.ly/LFTSVideoblocksTrial
This is fantastic work Michael. Thanks for making us smarter about film!
I know this might sound overrated. But, can you do Godfather Trilogy?
Please do one on 2001: Space Odyssey cinematography or ambiguity, or even effects.
I knew I would love this video
Two great movies. And here's why.
Would love to see a video on you tackling any component of any one of paul thomas andersons films
I feel like The Last of Us can also be compared to these two movies in the same way
I didn't like Logan.  All the characters felt dull
I'm a simple man. I see Children of Men... I click.
I enjoy your video as much as the movies! Thank you for your time and effort.
Awesome video man! They're always better than the last.\nCan I suggest something about the build up on War of the Worlds (2005)? :0
Hey Michael loved the video I'm very new to your videos and since I go to an acting school your channel helps. I was wondering could you try to tackle ether Foxcatcher or Fury? Cause I know there's incredible things in both films.
Very similar to The Last of Us, the three are amazing stories
Children Of Men is my favourite film of all time along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, would love if you did one on them? Or anything by Charlie Kaufman, the man is a genius! Love your work!
I’d love to see you tackle something with minimal dialogue like Shame or Hunger
I never noticed the similarities between these two movies before. Another great video as always.
Do a video of the new Netflix series Mindhunter, pleeeeeeeease
Logan immediately became one of my favorite comicbook movies after seeing it in theaters (and with time, will probably only get better).  Children of Men is one of my top 5 favorite movies to date.  Alfonso Cuaron is a brilliant director.  The cinematography is superb, and all of the actors really flesh out their roles.  I've watched it numerous times, and my enjoyment only increases with each viewing.
so glad i found your channel
Hey Michael Great content as always\nI want to ask you something\n\nI'm having a plan of making a film essay, and i want to ask you what method do you use everytime you analyze a screenplay ? Did you watch the film as you studying the script ? Or you just read it first and then watch the film ? Because i found it really hard for me watching a film and read a script at the same time\n\nThank You !
I absolutely love both of these films. Thank you for the lesson here: as a writer and as a movie lover it makes complete sense.
amazing video as usual, for your future videos, I'd love to see your analysis on The Room by tommy wiseau. i'm sure you love that movie lol
Hey! that was a pretty analysis. But I do have a small disagreement: Logan's lie. At the beginning of the video I thought it might be a bigger disagreement, but you do address part of it when you talk about the initial attitudes both protagonists have about the future. The thing is: I'm not sure Logan's lie is some aversion towards family in general.... I mean he does go to great lengths in order to take care of Xavier in his very complicated decrepitude. I'd probably say that Logan's lie has to do with where he thinks his family exists and what he should be trying to save. His lie is that his family ties can only exist in the past and that the debt he needs to repay to professor X can be repaid by taking care of him. But the truth is that his debt must be payed forward, that his obligations are towards the future, not the past.
Your analysis is amazing as usual. Also, I couldn't agree more on how ridiculously underrated Children of Men is. Truly, a masterpiece!
man Logan really took me by surprise. I knew it was going to be good but it was amazing
24 ways Children of Men and Logan are the same movie.
Bravo.
As Charlie Kaufman says in Synecdoche, New York The end is built into the beginning.
My heart leaped out of my chest when I saw this in my notifs! AAAAAA!! I love both films- Logan is the best X-Men film out there, and Children of Men holds a special place in my heart since it's one of my favorite films ever! And I agree with what you said about it- that it's one of the best films ever made!! GAAAAHHHH--\n\nThat aside, I really love watching your vids 'cause they teach me a lot about films, story telling, character analysis, and etc. Thank you so much for them, and I hope you keep doing your thing! <3
Now I must watch Children of Men.
I was waiting for someone else to make this comparison!  So glad you did!
I've just rewatched The Breakfast Club - pleaseeeeee consider doing an episode on that film.  I'd love to hear your take.
Amazing. You make my comparison film reviews look amateur. Great video man.
Whether or not you do a video essay on it up to you, but if I may recommend a film to you with a lot of themes and ideas to unpack, you should check out The United States of Leland starring Ryan Gosling, Don Cheadle, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Malone, and Chris Kline. Very heavy film.
Hi Michael, I love your video essays. I've been learning a lot. I'm writing a story sort of like wonder boys (by Chabon) and Sideways. And although i kind of see the comparison, i would very much like to see your take on it. thanks a lot!
I love your work. Seriously. I'm a aspiring writer/screenwriter and your essays have helped me a lot trough the process. Here's a suggestion: analyze Chinatown. Why is it so important? Why is it so baddass screenwriting? Thanks again and keep up the good work, man.
Now I want to view both films back to back. Fantastic work.
One of the best analyzing videos I've seen. Great analysis on my favorite movie of all time. Keep up the awesome work.
One could say Han Solo could fall into this category
One of the two favorites movies of all time
i really loved both of these films and I was blown away by this great comparison and analysis - great work!  very inspiring!
There are two types of people whose choices/actions defines them as true heroes: Those who endure all the pain, suffering, and sorrows of the world, so no innocents would ever have to feel them. And those who no matter their desires to protect the innocents and to see justice is served, by the book and nothing but the book, are hated, look down upon, and whose names are ridiculed by same innocent people they fight to protect. They continue to protect them nonetheless, without any regrets. :D
Another amazing video.  Thanks for the incredible content, it's serving as much needed inspiration as I battle through my screenplay.
Best video I have ever seen
how about... THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, please? You've need tackled on a comedy, besides GHOSTBUSTERS and American Beauty, although the latter film isn't exactly a comedy...
I guess you can add The Last of Us to this as well and I love all of them. I guess I'm just a sucker for this type of story.
This video is beautiful. Thank you
This is like a video essay. Thesis and supporting evidence.
Great vídeo !! I wound love to see you talking about The handmaids tale 😃
The Beginning is the End is the Beginning - Smashing Pumpkins
Great video, can you do The Prestige?
Verrrrry well done sir! Keep up the good work!
I will buy those books!
You have such fantastic content. I watch your videos multiple times bc they really get my creativity going. Thank you so much for the work you do!
When you brought up the protagonist believing in a lie that reflects the problems with society, my immediate thought was Bladerunner 2049. What a beautiful character arc for K
I didn’t even have the language to articulate it at the time, but I knew Children of Men was the most powerful (and probably best) movie I had ever seen the first time I watched it.
Great topic.  I'd believe this idea more if you started the explanation with the beginning of the stories instead of the end.  Better proof to just see how it is before the persuasive links are made for the learners.
This video is great. I’m definitely subscribing and definitely binge watching more of your videos
Another piece of media very similar to this is the Last of Us. Identical narrative composition.
Please do an analysis on La La Land! Though I personally think that the screenplay is mediocre, the execution is spotless, and I would LOVE an analysis on the this aspect.
I've never thought about this but soon as I read title of this video I (internally) screamed: Of course!
Wow, The Last of Us follows this formula point for point as well.\nI was joking when seeing the Logan trailer that it would be the Last of Us movie we didn't get but I hadn't realized how similar the two stories actually are until watching this video.
I'd never realized it, but the Matrix fits this structure to a T as well.
It is hard to believe how young your channel is. You went so far, so fast.
I appreciate your work so much. just amezing work.\nmuch love from Denmark
The last of Us is heavily inspired by Children of Men and Logan is basically The Last of Us  but with mutants.
One of your best essays yet, Michael! I love both movies, and you've communicated why they are so effective so eloquently. Really good job
The Last of Us is similar, I think
Whatever you do, whatever you make, I always love all your videos :)
Really wish this was longer..I love these videos so much
Love this channel! I used your advice from the Star Wars LFTS to make the protagonist of my short film more active! Thanks for making my writing better.
Never seen Children of Men but it kinda reminds me of V for Vendetta. Why are the British so convinced they will be the last country standing(and why do they need to turn Fascist to do so)
Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't figure out why tho. DO IT PLEASE :-D!
Fuck man, I love this episode
We really need an analysis on Acts 2 and 3 as well.
I wonder if the academy has the guts to give Jackman a best actor Nom for Logan?
Okay, I would pay you to do a full analysis like this of your favorite movie. These videos are insane.
I love how, even though I'm a writer and not a director, most of the lessons you cover are applicable to my work. Big thanks as always.
This was fantastic!! Man...thank you for making these.
You are great at this. Thanks you for this. I love your essays. And also, your voice is soothing.
Once again, congratulations, Michael. I believe this to be one of your finest works yet. It's quite a pleasure to watch such thought and well-crafted analysis every week. By the way, I also consider Logan as one of the best films of this year, but I must say I did not care much for Children of Men after I first saw it, many, many years ago. After this wonderful essay, I sure will give it another chance. Greetings from Argentina.
Beautifully said.  I absolutely adore the analysis in your video essays, keep up the great work!
Soo, doing it only for the money lead to bad things eh? That's one similarity
While not a favorite of mine, I would love for you to do a analysis of Annie Hall, especially after seeing your video on When Harry Met Sally. I'm really surprised to not see anyone else request this one.
This was fantastic. Thank you.
I really enjoyed watching this video
wait did cleo die? i thought he just passed out. fuck...im just gonna pretend i didnt hear that
(sorry about my english) I've never watched CHILDREN OF MEN, so I've watched only for watch this video. Amazing movie and analysis. Thank you.
It's almost been a year since I started the 3rd draft of my novel for NaNoWriMo. I finished it in the summer time and have been taking a break from it to build my business, and I am often contemplating revising it soon.\n\nTHIS video essay has inspired me to come up with way better revision ideas than I had thought of the past year. Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel. It truly helps a lot!
That was aweomse!
Amazing job! Keep it!
Very informative video. Thanks.
fascinating as always!!
Excellent video.
fantastic stuff
review rudderless
The Dresser and Birdman.
Good job.
I'm sure you've been asked this before, but is there a resource list of all the books you reference in your videos? Would love to add it to my reading list.
I LOOOOVE THIS!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣\nMy distaste for agent orange to my favorite tune!! 😍😍😍😍
I love this I don't care what others think about it I just love it
“You’re the color of the sign outside the store that says Home Depot” I DIED OMFG😂
finally a voice of reason
OMG, first video I see of you and loved it.. And coming from Puerto Rico and hating that song, I love this parody
I can foresee this getting 1,000,000 views by November who agrees like if u agree
You've had a rough week from about a year now lol
Calling trump a cheeto is an insult to cheetos
Why isn't Randy more popular????? He's a freaking genius.
I. LOVE. THIS. SONG!
This song is the reason why I am still sane
This is so funny!
OMG! I just Stumbled on this video the day it came out and literally spent the entire weekend catching up on Randy’s genius! I’m obsessed and addicted! Watching these all weekend made me realize I haven’t laughed since the inauguration.😂😂❤️🌈
I can’t believe that he promised the people less taxes but he hasn’t even did anything except make people annoyed at him and getting people KILLED. Not to ignore that he swears too much and too much Twitter 4 U
Pls put this on Spotify or itunes or something its awesome
I look forward to every song you post. You are fantastic!
i thought randy was going to do a sketch in a parking garage or on the phone with eminem
Omfg this is amazing. Also love the Desperate Cheeto. Who’s with me
Definitely the best video ever. My family's firm Puerto Rico too 🖕❤️ thanks randy
He kinda has a Charlie and the chocolate factory
Right on! Look up Tillerson's Song on YouTube, guys.
This is a good week for administration burns. This and Kellywise are required reading this week.
My favorite part of these videos is your glasses!  I love all of your other elements, too, but that's my favorite.
Who gave him A+'s? Him?
This was amazing. Thank you for it! Calling out the orange blob on Puerto Rico was necessary, funny, and touching.
My new favorite song like of you agree
Shared on Facebook, well done and keep them coming.  We are Canadian but we still think they are great.
Oh My GOD, Randy this is your best ever, you have really outdone yourself this time!!!\nxoxox
This video is awesome - can't stop laughing every time I watch it.
Oh my god I love this so much
RANDY YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh
Can you post these lyrics up somewhere?
😆😆😆 this is so hilarious! You sir, just got a new subscriber 👍
I can't stop watching this....it is that good!
😂😂😂oml! I got it to 9k❤
I've now come back to watch this three times. So good
Omg... When I had first seen this I blew water all over my laptop busting into laughter! Like my new favorite song. Ahahaha...
IM DYING THIS SONG IS SO GENIUS AND FUNNY
Oh my goodness Randy, I have tears running down my face, that is brilliant! keep doing what you’re doing, you make this administration more bearable.
Poor Trump. This must be the first time he ever tried to pronounce a word in a language other than English.  Someone must have tried hard to teach him the pronunciation and get him to pick it up accurately.  But they failed.
All those dislikes I will hunt u down and dislike u
Every thing u said is sooo true
Im so happy right now
The only reason there are dislikes is because people are mad that they didn't write this.
Good day,\n\nHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nThank You The tragedies are horrible, but this Yellow Bodied Cowardly LiAR-ito....\n\nThank you for your time.
Absolutely brilliant. On behalf of my Puerto Rican side of the family, THANK YOU RANDY!!
This is amazing! Life saver for those of us looking for some normality in all this mess
Randy Rainbow is so pretty.
This guy needs to be a guest on SNL!
Been having a bad week, for about a year now!  ... In and out, in and out, three times - okay well lets not get into your sex life!\nLMAO! This is amazing!
Hey, Randy - since you clearly have an in with the White House, can you arrange a meeting between me and Trump?\nI got some things I'd like to get off my chest. :)
Funny, but even funnier is Hilary's book!  How come everyone knows What Happened except her?
8000 to 142. Yeah, I think you nailed this one too. :D
You're my favorite human.
Who are the 141 people that disliked this? Is it Trump disliking it on numerous devices?
HILARIOUS..This guy is sooooo talented...great job...and guess what: he is right, with every word he sings
OMFG Randy's voice is amazing. Me and my daughter keep this song on repeat 😂 grabby braggadocios creepo is perfect
I hope Trump gets to see this. He'll probably try to ban YouTube.
From France : you are a genius ! ;) xoxoxo
That song describes Donald Trump in every single way
I love this song. It's intelligent, hilarious, and spot on. Plus, Randy, you are just adorable and fun to watch!
I died at you're this color. I went to Home Depot, and the sign made me think about this video. I laughed so hard that I farted.
I solemnly dedicate my golf trophy to the victims of Hurricane Donald.\n\nRandy Rainbow, you're a light in the darkness. And a genius. And I love you.
thank you. MY NEW FAVORITE SONG! awesome
A guy from Puerto Rico Hit like on this video! Good!
I heard Justin Bieber did a parody of this song
I'm a fan for sure!  You freekin killed it.  Thanks from all of us Puerto Ricans!!!
Hilarious as usual. Thank you Randy, just what the doctor ordered 😂
We got very high marks! we got A+ pluses Good Boy ahaha\nthe feeling you get when you get A+ on your math test or any other subject :D

I Love Randy

DESPERATE CHEETO IS AWESOME
I hate trump
Wonderful, Randy!
You go randy
Awesome!
And hilarious!
This is Fucking hilarious
u have musical.ly
THIS IS GENIUS 😂😂😂😂😂
My blood still boils and my BP rises at the disregard for human lives by this terrible horrible despicable man somehow elected as president. The nerve of a person with limited language skills and who can only speak one language at 4th grade level to mock those of us with accents and the loving way we pronounce our country's name is 'insoportable'.  Randy's parodies help me put things in perspective and bring my anger to a manageable level and my BP lower. He makes me laugh and I feel better all day.
This why Trump will get 8 years. Thank you
bless whoever carved dat pumpkin at 3:38
Ah, Randy Rainbow, what was my life before I found you?  Personally, I blame my sister because she's been a fan for ages and never bothered to mention it lol <3
I could listen to you all day Randy.
Another great one.  I don't know where you get all the continual creative energy from to do these.  If I had to watch as many videos of him as you do I would surely be heaving over the toilet most of the day. Thanks for getting through this sickness for us.
YOU  SUCK...LMAO
A bit racist isn't it?  The next time there's a black president, will it be okay to poke fun at his skin?
Whats funnier the song or this faggot liberal. Too bad a total flame ass made this , funny parody but this is last guy/girl to make fun of anyone
1 slip can turn your name from most thanked to box office poison, shouldn’t have done it Harvey.

Hollywood being a dark place where women can be sexually assaulted ....\n\nAnybody seeing the 'Beast and the Harlot' music video?
i had been raped by a old women 10 years ago.\n\nwomen False accusations movement without evidence.
At the end of the day Mr women respecter don't get no pussy. If you got money and status women will come around.
This model rocks for wearing a wire and trying to catch him.  Way to go, Ambra!
WHAT A DISGUSTING PIG! THE EMBODIMENT OF TOXIC MASCULINITY THAT POLLUTES OUR SOCIETY! MEN YOU MUST RESPECT WOMEN!
Wait until this vindictive a-hole decides to talk. Right now he's feeling like a lot of his allies have abandoned him. I think he's going  to expose alot of a-list perverts and prostitutes. For all we know he's probably got recordings as well.
Just as digusting is most of the commenters here, using a man's actions to fuel your political views or jew hating rhetorics.
Everybody in Hollywood like this. All pedophiles too. I hope they all die.
the girl with the dragon tattoo
Having to watch this fugly walrus of a hairy beast take a shower must be akin to crucifixion! Disgusting jew!
the jew cries out in embarrassment as he molests you
Hollywood has always had this kinda rep, this isnt anything new.. Why do young people keep trying to knock down the doors to get into a corrupt and perverted industry??  What do you expect??
Nothing will happen to him because he's a Jew and Jews run Hollywood
Is fame and getting movie and television positions worth these incidents with Harvey Weinstein?  Just like the Bible says, is gaining the world worth losing your own soul!  I think not!
This is an anti-semitic canard !
what goes on in the dark always comes out in the light.
SWINE WEINSTEIN CAUGHT WITH PANTS DOWN : DESTROYED (and rightly so)\nSWINE DRUMPF CAUGHT WITH PANTS DOWN: ELECTED\n\nNOBODY IS MORE HYPOCRITICAL THAN A TRUMPANZEE...
And Donald Trump is one of them too
Its also George Clooney, Ben Affleck, and many others.
if he doesnt go to jail , then we will see the power of the money , if anyone of us do that , for sure we were on jail already.
Ewww. I guess he has to pay the karma debt by going to jail and get f*** by the Mexican mans
Harvey Weinstein
After we had a mutually agreed rough and an extremely perverted bukake, anal, foot fetish, food fetish, hentai - like, fisting, footing or feeting, he stood up, looked at me with his devilish eyes and said: \nCan you massage my shoulders, please! \nIt was terrible, massaging that grizzly bear. That massage request was very offensive and hard for me.\n(it's a joke!)\nImprison that hungry perv!
Isn't that that fabian guy from channel one?
Well, you gotta admit -- he had good taste in women.  Only the best...

YOU'RE SO DEAD IN PRISON
What a disgusting deranged jew
Evil ugly pig.
Who the hell would watch some old fat dude take a shower? Lol
execute harvey for his crimes
No arrests made.....JOO pigs covering JOO pigs !!!
So gross. Has some fetish with being watched taking a shower and beating it. Very weird the way he begs for it. Smh.
So now it seems clear to me that any so called actress who was in his films has revealed themselves to be a PROSTITUTE No MAN would ever sleep with a fat ugly woman no matter how rich or powerful but women on the other hand......
He made all this people rich
Can he even find his penis beneath that belly?
Grab her by the pussy.
Maybe he''ll be having a shower with big bubba someday soon.
Weinstein is a sexual predator but the ALMIGHTY HOLLYWOOD protects him and their fellow sexual deviants goyim.\n\nThey thought the Satanic Cult is just a crazy Christian Conspiracy. But this is a hard evidence that several A-listers accused him now.
Don't ruin your friendship with me over five minutes... How simultaneously sad and needy, disgusting and manipulative.
No one should be surprised at what the culture of permissiveness and near naked women and power created. It is also no wonder at the more than 100,000 rapes in this country due to the bombardment of everything having to be sexy.  Virtually everything in the movie industry has an element of sex thrown in and giving something a PG-13 rating will not stop young viewers. Make the ratings and warnings much stronger. God, family and country.
Throw the book at this pervert.
THAT demanding insolent voice is THE DEMON Thats ON HIM TALKING! One demon on him -opens door for lots more. HarveyW IS TOTALLY OVERRUN WITH DEMONS. This guys lord is SATAN. AND NOW satan IS DONE WITH HIM. Devil COMES TO STEAL KILL AND DESTROY! 👎💩👎💩👎
When women singers like the one who used to be Hannah Montana sexually harrasing males none bat and eye, but when a Male do same thing, all of you start complaining about it like a bunch of little kids.
How's the power over women goin Harvey? How's it going?
Yet you all support Hollywood from Woody Allen barely legal adopted Korean daughter to Michael Jackson molesting young boys.  Corey Feldman so messed up (some kind of victim syndrome).  Even Bill Clinton molesting interns as govenor to President.  You all gawk at celebrities as role models?  Why now with McGowen?
No woman is going to have sex with that ugly mug on purpose unless she is blind!
look at that, I cant blame him for trying ;)
Stop sucking dick to get parts in Hollywood all of you ladies.
I want justice for the potted plant!
Liberal Hollywood is being Exposed 😈👿☻👻
I know I am going to get heat for saying this, but the fact that so many women stayed quiet rather than call out this predator is truly sad and upsetting. Their silence perpetuated his deviant behavior. In his sick mind, there wasn't anything wrong with it... Why? Because most of the women shrugged it off or were afraid of losing their career. What's more important, values and standing up for what's right or money and Fame? It seems for many the latter, smh.
Desperately pleading is NOT what Weinstein was doing, you jackasses. We can assume that headline was written by a man.
But he looks so nice and sounds so nice. (Not about the creepy bit)
A perverted freak exposed and uprooted Praise the Lord
Harvey Weinstein? Hollywood?\nThis happens in every aspect of American business.\n\nThe gambling company IGT is just as corrupt and disgraceful.\nThey protect racists, deviants, con men and would defend paedo's if it made them a buck. \n\nPatti Hart, when she was the CEO of IGT, and former General Counsel Johnson, oversaw and concealed: \n1) The bribery of staff to lie to cover up management criminality \n2) The blackmailing of staff to cover up management criminality \n3) Non-disclosure of evidence in direct contravention of court orders\n4) Perverting the course of justice \n5) Forcing staff, by mandate, to commit perjury in court \n6) And other breaches of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act relating to some suspiciously odd adjudications by equally corrupt judges.
Typical dirty jew
Roast that pig
JEWISH SEX TERRORIST IS HARVEY WEINSTEIN
Libtard females and a  Sodom and Gomorrah man...they deserve each other.  LOL
Disgusting Hollywood kike. Deserves to be removed from this planet
If the devil had a voice, his is what it would sound like
I just have a question...why now ladies ? Why not when it happened ? Or is it because you liked what he was doing to you ? You all went to bed with thim stop playing victims...
Who taped the conversation between he and the model?
Oh common people. He is not the only pig in the movie industry.
The year of the Weins. First Anthony w...../carlos danger/mr abedin. now HW....
I dont understand why did they wait so long to sue him and report those facts.
Hollywood seems to be full of very *strange* people , can you guess what group they belong too ? ..Here is a clue ' You can't talk about them '.
Hey can all the anti-Semitism.
That italian chick ruined her chances to become next Hollywood stupidstar...
Whats wrong with desperately pleading with a beautiful model?
a beautiful 22 year old italian model \nthanks for letting us know she was 'beautiful', news. because that's a really valuable and relevant piece of information to a sexual harassment case.
Ugh

Claudia always was and still is LOVELY!!! :)
Lisa! Can you please give a María Félix makeup tutorial! She was one of Mexico’s most beautiful women. With very characteristic makeup.
Pls pls pls pls pls a tutorial with Doutzen Kroes :p one of the most flawless Beauties ever
when other youtubers are collabing between them and Lisa is collabing with top models from the 90's you know the difference in caliber.
can you please do make up on an asian person without a crease?
I will say that I'm not the biggest fan of the quick fire questions -- I love the natural process of getting to know the person through Lisa's conversations with them while she's doing the makeup. Having the quick fire questions makes it seem more jarring and less integrated with the video.
Beautiful job on the Legendary Claudia! Anything Bardot is fantastic
Lisa you make the rest of the 'beauty gurus' looking and sounding incredibly sad and cheap. Video like this one are an example of what a real professional should be. Thank you so much. And thank you for bringing a beauty icon such as Claudia.
I love Lisa's laugh at the end! So adorable! Fantastic work as always <3
Finally, a makeup look done on a true hooded eye- nicely executed. Her crinkly laugh lines are just lovely!
ANY SUPERMODEL that works purposes with you is a great person as well! NOW, if only Christy, Naomi, Kate H. and Linda could be next!!! Love these beautiful women!
So wonderful! I love the whole interaction, just so genuine and sweet!
She does have lines, but she wears them well and she's still gorgeous.
Fabulous tutorial 😍 I cannot use eyelash curlers ... my eyelashes are so long and naturally curly and my eyes are hooded .. I actually try and straighten them out a bit with the mascara wand lol.
What a fantastic tutorial. I love Lisa. She's a true artist and leagues above the other self-centered 20-somethings flooding YouTube. Genuine class and style! And Claudia is so timeless. <3
That Golden Circle makeup bot was quite amazing!
Lisa you and me common thing is rings love
Her skin is everything
Fabulous video Lisa, I loved seeing Claudia, she is amazingly beautiful and natural (meaning no botox or plumped lips). Great idea to show us how you did her make up!!! Wonderful!!! Thank you !!! Cristina M.
Lisa, this was so much fun, with a great match of look & model. And I do want that lipliner color, I've been loving a light nude lip lately.
Hello Lisa Eldridge ..I would love to do the smokey effect underlining the lower eyes with liner or eye makeup..but I suffer from puffy eyes/ slight bulge quite near to the waterline...so how do I tackle this issue with make up...
Lisa looking gangsta with all those rings 😄. Love this makeup look. It isn’t easy working on mature eyes but I think the trick is not to overthink it. This smokey eye still works 👍🏾
Gorgeous!!  Both of u!!  Thank you for sharing this moment in time with us!!
Great video, thank you so much for sharing this! You both are gorgeous & talented. It's wonderful to see two extremely successful women supporting each others work. LOVE!! One minor point, pizza cutter?!? How 'bout modified ball-point pen instead? <
What a lovely guest and a wonderful surprise!  A favorite of mine since the 80's!  Beautiful...
LOL I hit like before even watching!
Please please do rose makeup look from titanic... You seem to know exactly what celebrities use for their roles and real life.. I wana know what Kate used in makeup as rose and what hair colour was used and hair cut... Please do that video!!!!
I'm pretty decent with makeup but if I tried that dark of a smoky eye omg I would be a mess! Seriously talented! Goals dramatic but still minimal
2 wonderful women sharing a wonderful moment with us! Thank you ladies you’re both so inspirational.
Claudia had a few Chelsea Handler angles for me in this...
So beautiful! Loved the quick questions
She´s an archangel.
Make up look with Liu Wen, please! There are not so many make up tutorials with asian beauties. It'll be amazing!
Love how Claudia allows her face to have frown lines and crows feet, instead of botoxing everything away like what happens in Hollywood. Ageless beauty!
I have been waiting my entire life for this.Thank you thank you thank you.I love you Claudia
I didn't think Claudia would be like this, I have never really seen her talk much before. She seems really smart, down to earth and just a cool chick to hang out with. Great tutorial.
I love the 60s looks! Claudia has the most fantastic skin...stunning!
Such a cute video!
Brigitte Bardot is a beautiful woman but let's not forget she's also a keen racist.
She still looks like an angel. That skin!!
Yep! As I suspected, Lisa's rings reproduce
Hi Lisa, I really enjoyed this with Claudia, I’m a massive fan. I also made a video the other day on Claudia too. It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.
just look at this beautiful creature =) no botox and fillers... just plain gorgeous in and out ..   the most beautiful woman in the world!
Anyone know where Lisa’s rings are from?
I am not familiar with Claudia Schiffer but you can see from the bone structure of her face that she is beautiful, with or without makeup. She looks like a doll, big eyes, slim nose and shapely mouth. Not sure if she had plastic surgery, but if she was born like that, she was born to be a supermodel. And she seems so nice and kind, which is a rare in these day and age with supermodels.
Claudia looks so sweet such a kind person
Yes, what a treat! My fave model of all time with the best makeup artist ever!
She is the most beautyful creature in the world. I adore claudia🌹❤️. Thankeyou, Lisa
It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)
I saw one of the OG Supermodels, I clicked
OMG how do you get one of the biggest supermodels of all time in your video?
Black eyelashes and blond hair... isn't it weird?
Funny intro! Really loved the energy between you two Lisa. I did notice the new ring additons. They are so beautiful. Always wondering where you find those dashing rings.
I gave away a fragrance by Agent Provocateur to a free box.  ehehehehehehe
What a goddess she is
Wow, she seems so sweet , nice and authentic!
Once the Top Supermodel in the World, some 25 years ago.
Omg one of my favorite supermodel. She's the perfect Bardot.💕
this is a beautiful makeup tutorial and really fast haha I love all of the colours and you are my favourite YouTuber.
I slept with my makeup on last night. Take me out back and shoot me. :D
My younger brother was IN LOVE with Claudia Schiffer back in the day-she is still stunning and I just love her imperfectly beautiful teeth!,
Lisa Eldrigdge's videos are the only makeup tutorials I need and want to see. Love your work!
If only I could sleep in my makeup and look like Claudia when I wake up!
Lisa!!!! thanks SO much for featuring the original supermodels like Yasmin Le Bon and Claudia! Just what I needed after a hard week :D
oh Claudia is lovely isn't she - so articulate, warm and gorgeous  xxxxx
Beauty really comes from within...
Omg Claudia Schiffer is my favorite model ever since I was a little girl.
OMG her skin is flawless i can't believe this.. another lovely collab!
Do you have a new ring or two?
I really love how she is ageing gracefully.
I love all the great 90s supermodels....! wow! despite the fact that they´re older now, they are still so stunning! Bravo, Claudia and Lisa!
Of course it's gorgeous!  So sad that Claudia's makeup is not available in the US :-(
Thank you for sharing the video, Lisa! I love how Claudia is so natural & classy and looking after herself after 30 years in fashion. She is comfortable & confident in herself that she doesn't mind showing us her lines, which we all have!!! Great to see her amazing self after being her fan for 25 years!!! Love Claudia!!!! XOXO
That intro, sooooo funny !!!!
Nooo waaaayyy claudia schiffer!!! Amaazing!!!
She is STUNNING !

Soap what's the point
Bill, I don't know what you're smoking, but I need some of that.

*SOAP is the GOAT*
Bill please pass the drugs

Thanks for the soap tips. It really helped
soap here\nthanks bro for the soapy shout out
Bill. Who is your dealer???
Just replace every time they say soap with the word drugs.
Best video since History of Japan
You are making these while high, ADMIT IT
Man, we gotta get our act together. We gotta be more like the koala bears, 'cause let me tell you, the number 8 is orange. Y'all think this is a game. Sure, I know my face resembles a checkerboard, but remember how the carpet became like a chicken and we had to stab it with an axe and a mighty hammer? That's why 800 years ago Humongo McRumble put the dynamite in the pizza and the pizza in the dynamite.\n\nY'all know what's up. The choice is yours.
Oh no its a natural disaster...
Oh no, it's a natural disaster!
*You should make the ending more brief*
After taking a quick look in the notebook Bill's website and this video, it's official. Bill Wurtz is taking daily doses of LSD.
This is great because it's like he's using his memes to say different things . Lmao
I have never eaten a brick. Also, I don’t think the moon is for sale. But don’t quote me on that.
Ill have what bills having
Hi, is there some soap I can rent? Wut...
You could make a religion out of this!
I love your content. It sounds like you’re just singing/saying whatever pops into your brain
This dude is on lsd 24/7
Oh no, it’s a natural disaster

Bil your videos are freedom in video form :) always believe in who you are!
The History Of Soap, I Guess
so he got outside and then he found love in the jungle in africa. and soap.
Tip 1, don't drop it
Bill: How r u liking ur soap? Me: Actually no take it back okay bye
Tip: don't drop the soap
Also name a TV show genre after it
as we all sit an pray together may we learn how to use soap together and not be lead to dirtiness, but be delivered from cleanliness. thine's the clean kingdom, thine's the glory, forever and ever, Amen.
Why is In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida playing in my head while I watch this?
About 50 people using the don't drop the soap joke.... because the fruit closest to the ground is best, I guess. smh
I live in Canada and it's not clean
Legend says the stickman is still floating in the flood
L E G A L I Z E   S O A P
I'm giving away Krabby Patty *SOAP* anyone want some?
What if bill wurtz is a soap god?
Lets go to Africa and find love in the jungle best lime ever! I didn't know there were jungles in Africa
Ok sweetie, Don't drop it! ☺️
Soap gods?\nYou can make a religion out of- \nactually, don't.
The soap is a deadly laser.
How do I worship said soap gods? I never feel clean enough bill. Answer me please. I am extremely isolated in the hills of Notverycleanville. And looking forward to seeing a nice bar of happiness on my nose. \n \nMuch love, Dandy
Oh no it's a natural disaster............. .......... I wonder what would happen if you combined soap with soap 😂😂

This band is too cute.
LOOK AT THESE NERDS, THEY'RE SO CUTE
Jaja I love the song
Zac back in the band should be reason enough to any atheist to start believing in God. hahahah \nMy love for this band only increased, and I listen to them simply since they started. That perfect divine melodic and energetic vibe remains in the band independently of any circunstancies the band go through or any new ideas they add. It can only come from God. I actually was growing up as they were also growing up, so you can understand how important they are for me. And notice, I am a person who thinks it's very unhealthy to idolize any artist, so you can see how much my love for this band is not just a teenager idol hysteria thing. hahahah I'm not even a teen anymore. Lol\nGod bless Paramore.
didn't know they could make me laugh while singing such sad lyrics
m y   c h i l d r e n
I love you guys

You saved me, and for that what's mine is yours...

Jessi said she's posting videos since 'as soon as you could make youtube videos' and I thought 2005, and then she says 2013 and I'm like that's just 4 years ago. That's not that long ahahahaha

react to old cheat day episodes you were in !!!
WHY WERE YOU A BLONDE KIM

She is the same, just a little more sarcastic... Yup
You just Made my whole life 😂😂😎😎😎😎😎

LOVE THE VIDEO I KINDA LIKE THE MUSIC BUT GOOD JOB
The girl in the last part sounded like Mel B

Here before it blows up

10 seconds into the video and wtf
Finally been waiting for this
The weirdest music video that has come to my sight and hearing, I do not know why these day's music are meaningless and all about money and hoe's. Just at least tell us a good message just like Tupac Shakur.

ISSSAAAAAAA 😍
Catchy af
Que clase de ozuna gringo con voz de hombre es este?
It took 2 goddamn years... But gosh, I'm so happy for this man ♥
I almost cried 😩 This is a good video for the song. The song deserves a Grammy and the video, an Emmy! ☺️I never expected something like this!
sincerely, i cried watching this video. but then when he started dancing i thought there would be a sick twist where he danced and fell into the pool. \n\nso glad i was so wrong.
Get the depression slapped out of you.
In Chile and other latinoamericana countries, TKM is used as an informal acronym for Te k(q)uiero mucho, which translated means I love you so much\nThat's exactly how I feel about Michael McDonald, Kenny Loggins and Thundercat... and the video of course :)
So disrespectful. He doesn't even open the brochure at the beginning smh 😔😔😔😤
damn thundercat mustve found the most soulful sounding white ppl ever. almost cried
BRAVO SAMURAI!!!!
Nice to see Toro y Moi help the samurai get back in his groove.
WAIT HOW DID HE DRIVE THERE
The hug scene gets me everytime
1:21-1:42 when the bitumen is struck and separated. Thanks for the art, gentlemen. I loved that.
I swore his arms were gonna grow back.
Amazing
Liking this guys music.. gotta love bringing those two legends back together again as well!
Anyone knows other artists that do this kind of music? I love the chord progressions, bass, floating retro synth XD... in this song
Now if he does Lava Lamp, I can die in peace.
00:29 what kind of synth is that
Kenny, Michael, and Thundercat....on a track. Wat??
I didn't know who Thundercat was, but his powers of smooth music are great enugh reunite Kenny and Michael! Damn I'm a fan! Check out Yaght Rock for the whole story. Funny ASF!
You know you've made it when you sing on a miniature cathode television with freakin' Kenny Loggins and Michael f-ing McDonald! Glad to see them up and running :)
What a song! But a very weird video lol
The chorus is so
He will get his arms back in the future.
i follow the truth JIMMY ..
I heard of him from some Kendrick songs and I'm happy I accidentally stumbled upon this.
I was at a ramen joint waiting for my bowl when I saw the video on my feed I clicked on it and the first thing I saw was the samurai and I had to really keep myself from screaming so I had to pause the video and wait for me to leave the ramen joint and watch video at home, lol
This song is beautiful I can’t stop listening
This is some GOOOOD ass Music!! DAMN!!
Dude with the glasses look like Toro...
So glad to see him all positive and happy :)
damn stop abusing my experience with my now disabled mother and squeezing out my tears 😥
Is this a real family and he is actually missing his arms ?
this song is so beautiful and magical
This was actually far more uplifting than I expected it to be
Coco would be proud of such smooth music
I really didn't think we'd get a continuation to the armless samurai's story. Strangely glad we did.
3:57 At the end of it alllll...
I love this song.
0:54 That was the Sonic 1 twinkle.
I absolutely love this! 😍
I absolutely love seeing black cinema that transcends the trite bullshit that typically comes out of racist Hollywood.
Thundercat is a genius this has me crying tears of joy
I been listening to this song alot! Love that he released a video for it
Why does Booker T have no arms?
Never thought I would see a music video sequel to Them Changes.
did tyler the creator shoot his music video for answer there?
thundercat always hits me right in the feels, man 😩😭
He slapped the black off of him lol 1:40
1:07 Donald Glover is that you?!?!
I thought this was KRS-One in the thumbnail
Call video. I thought for sure there was going to be a moment when his arms would sprout out after he got the crap out of his head and let his demons free in the sky. I’m not sure if this was supposed to be symbolic of someone shackled by depression or addiction, so I kept seeing the metaphor of the crap released from his head and the black birds flying away. Way to play the whole cheesy Loggins McDonald cheesy angle in the sky. Thunder is very cool. And is on my #selfiebucketlist
Wtf this is a phenomenal featuring
So, in the last instalment, he's gonna get mechanoid arms, right? Then Evil Red Lobster Samurai's in the shit... 🤣
if he falls in that pool he's fucked
Fuck yes I waiting for a video for this song, THANK YOU! Lol
Michael McDonald & Kenny Loggins are so legendary, so nice with Thundercat.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Loll this video already iconic. Thundercat always has the best videos
The samurai is back and mentally better. Now this makes me wanna go watch them changes. Hope there is a part three for this story.
how far does this samurai story arc reach to?
Walk On By should be about the other samurai
Im sorry but I cried. Healing the wounds of this brother the metaphors are overwelming- thanks T. Wellness = Healing.
The world is so depressing at the moment, thanks for giving the samurai an ending he deserved!
It's so..... Smoooooth.
OooOooh Kenny Loggins
Kenny Loggins!!!Yasss!!!
Excellent.
Nice
nigger nigger faggot
Such a tune!
Dope
That vodka water bottle protip 👌
Thundercat bringin' that smooth R&B
What is this Shananigans?!
wooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!
Thundercat my new fav artist he dont disappoint
Sounds good.....really good
Thundercats can honestly collab with anyone.
Happiness!

Damn...Imma in tears...this...is...so....beautiful
good emotions
My HART!!
I FUCKIN LOVE IT
This my shit
about time.
touching
Favourite tune on Drunk, easy peasy
Tkm or tkc? Tkm probably for thundercat Kenny Michael but still continuity error spotted
I kind of wish the internet didnt have to spoil the surprise of kenny loggins and michael mcdonald being on a thindercat album. I just imagine watching this video or listening to this song for the first time, w/o the prior knowledge, and  it would have been hilarious.
This video and song had me in tears. I have limited use of the left side of my body, limbs are pretty much useless. You can become so bitter, you struggle and ask yourself why. You can become so poisonous and toxic to yourself and those around you. The samurai shows me its possible to heal, for that I am grateful. \nGrateful for this wonderful work of art.
For those crying cultural appropriation in the comments:\n\nThe proper definition of cultural appropriation is claiming a culture of which you're not a part to be your own. I'll use myself as an example. I'm German, so I celebrate German culture. If someone who isn't German likes the culture and decides to partake in something like, let's say, Oktoberfest, but doesn't claim that s/he is German, I have no problem with that. But if that same person claims to be German, when in fact, s/he is Portuguese, then that would start rustling my jimmies.\n\nNow, I know some might say, But you're European. You did that all the time and still do that. I'll include a better example. I play the didgeridoo, an instrument played by Australian Aborigines. I'm not claiming to be Aboriginal, I just appreciate the didgeridoo for what it is. But if I was claiming to be Aboriginal, that would make me a jerk. And nobody likes a jerk.\n\nIf anything, what Lindsey's doing here is cultural appreciation. She's not claiming to be Indian, she's drawing inspiration from Hindu culture for this song/video. If all of her songs were like this, then yeah. That'd be offensive. But this is one song off of one of three albums. \n\nSo please. Chill out. Have some popcorn. Just calm down.\n\nEdit: If you do wanna argue with me, please do so in a civilized manner. Don't resort to insults and the race card. I will point and laugh at you.
why is there like so little acknowledgment of raja kumari here? I love lindsey but raja kumari is extremely talented and deserves the recognition and not to mention, for an indian song with influences of bollywood and bharatnatyam, there is literally no representation from a single indian person in this video
Listen to this song  Lindsey, so beautiful! You should do covers of his songs: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYZOnIEUdYU&list=PLfx5HmJqhpo-Iwkw8Ti4bQSdWcadmiAHz&index=3\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoqetjCskXA&index=1&list=PLfx5HmJqhpo-Iwkw8Ti4bQSdWcadmiAHz
God every time she touches that violin my heart melts because of her music she is really amazing and very inspiring with her music and I thank you Lindsey Sterling for making me the person I am
Another AMAZA-BALLS vedio. Keep up the good work Lindsey Stirling.
I love your music! Can you play Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance? Please, or because Halloween is coming can you play a song from Nightmare Before Christmas?
I want a wall paper for my computer of you in the war paint look. That is so hot looking!
I was subscribed to her since when she had 400,000 subscribers now she has 9,000,000 wow 😮
Tripple combo in the air and a shotgunning of a quick Bulgarian beer, while taking a couple of paparazzi with a high kick out ouf your space is the least thing I can do for you, girl ;)
Lindsey, you never fail to impress me
This is by far your most unique piece.
I would love to have violin lessons from you ❤❤❤❤
AMAZING!!! XD :D :) I want to go to one of your concerts so bad.. Please have one in California!!!
I would    love     you  and  Estas  Tonne     work     together

LOVE IT AS ALWAYS!
Been a fan for years. Even watch you're collabs with various youtuber's and of course the whole Dancing with the Stras thing. Love everything you do. Keep it up chick.
I absolutely love this music, but singing is too much. i found singing disruptive...
You ALWAYS just know, and new video from Lindsey is going to be REMARKABLE, and it always IS.
i love Lindsey as a blonde!
But it is very beautiful this cat ... Success for you Lindsey, I love you and your work, if a day comes to Brazil let me know kisses !!!!!!!!
Some say Lindsey's violin  is magical and any tears brought on by the sounds echoing from it, will cure all sadness.
Her grandma was one of our patients.she played violin everytime  she visits her grandma here in shadypines care home
I'm always listening to you in the car \n\nhttps://zrzutka.pl/jagoda
I wanna see her play devil went down to Georgia so bad, she's so good.

That Thaka dina made my Indian self jump out of my seat LINDSEYYY YOU HAVE MY HEART
You look absolutely stunning in blonde, sweetheart <3
When u mix music in Indian Style, It always will be Great like this, Keep going Lindsey!, Next time try to play ur Violin against a Tanpura! and get a good musician from the music industry and try it with Tanpura,  or u can play Indian Raagas using ur Violin, Just wondering how will it sound Tanpura and Violin and An Raaga. Try night Raagas Like Kirwani or Shivranjani or Marwa!
Yes!Dynamics,energic and spiritfull.Thank's Lindsey Stirling.Bless You!
Oddly this doesn't entirely remind me of Bollywood, it also reminds me of pirates. More accurately, the pirate shanties from A.C.: Black Flag.
THE VIOLIN SOUNDS AMAZING ;D
Didn't know u could make those sounds with a violin
Anybody else think a Ludovico Einaudi and Lindsey Stirling mashup would be beautifully epic?
How do you bend back while playing violin like I tried and I almost fell over and nearly wrecked my violin
She's like the Lady Gaga of the violin.
Love this so much <3
do you can dance hip-hop?
When the song first came out I imagined what the music video for it would look like, and this is SO CLOSE to it! The only real difference is that mine had a flying carpet and life-size castle out of sand in the desert. I LOVE the video, thank you Lindsey!
Lindsey, this track is 🔥🔥🔥 loving the nod to Indian music 😁
Girl, you are an idol to me.  I am rooting for you during DWTS, and I am giving not so subtle hints to my parents to get me tickets for your Christmas tour.  Woot Woot!
Skimming through youtube, trying to find something I can just listen to as I finish this math quiz. Hmmm, Lindsey Stirling? And she has a new video? Works for me! Ok, press play, switch tabs, and start question number 1. Not even 5 seconds in, I had to put down my pencil and switch back. The violin was just so enticing, I loved it!!!
I loved this new video Lindsay
This is gold, quite literally.
I don't like it as much as some other videos, but it's good. I think it could have been more. I would have loved a real story.
Another AMAZING track!!!! I didn't know if it could get better than Elements or The Arena but....Wow. This is beautiful.
I love you
j adore
You are on 🔥.

Beautiful
wth where is the music? It's all violin. Where is the dubstep, and tehno?
my nigga 6lack looking faded as fuck. mad cover
Dayyyuummm
Neo Soul is supposed to be sultry and understated, enthusiasm doesn't necessarily have to be conveyed through being loud or charismatic. Fantastic musical sensibility.
Bunch of Haterz in the comments. I can imagine those people to be analyzing every word he singing. It's good music for the Soul and Spirit. Don't matter if you don't like it because other people will.
This is 6lack putting his touch on the song, reason why it's a cover!!! I say flamessss!!!!!!
I heard dis song all my life... But he made me LISTEN. Badu was kicxin some REAL SHIT bac in da day...
Greatness will always be critiqued by those less qualified. Bless 6lack
Not the biggest fan of dude's music, but I really don't enjoy just watching you guy shit on this cover. It was obviously from a place of appreciation and respect for Badu. This genre is similar but not totally his. And dude did his thing on it. Stop the hate spread love.
6LACK got soul!
This cover is pretty good!!!! Wtf are y'all smoking. 😂😂😂
Aye im not gonna lie to all y'all haters, in my opinion i think this shit is fire
I already know I'm gonna like this
Great voice. Soulful af
Straight Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I already New it was going to be fire had to like it before he even started
6lack is my guy; great music, but this wasn't wow at all. more like an 'oh, aiight, that was cool, I guess' lol
I liked it, don't understand the hate, he should've been more vocally flexible he needed more range
Its a cover smh. Its supposed to be a lil differant.
So In Love with his voice! 😍
I love this!! So soulful ❤ 6lack you did so dam good.
Not my style of music, but solid cover. 6lack has a strong set of pipes on him.
IM FUCKING SHOOK OMFG
Unenthusiastic has a face
If You Don't Like This Then Kys
A guy with a Sade fucking Adu t shirt singing a Erykah MF Badu.... I just can't ♥
This is literally so so good, vibing.
why do i feel late
They should do a collaboration 🔥
My day has been blessed :)
Can you just cover all her songs....thanks
1000 level up from badu, sick !
Damn beautiful low tone
i know it's probably because Ben and Liam get a lot on unsolicited hate in the comments but I miss the little intros at the start of these videos it was always cool to see a bit of what the artist is like
Cant wait for the show in Atl!!! Zone 6 baby
🔥
hoolyTv
😍🎧🎤 #6lack #vibes
The way I love this guy’s voice
Beautiful. \nGave me goosebumps when this was on the radio this morning!
Not my style of music but i love it
6lack lookin like Hall & Oates in the She's Gone video
Amazing 👏🏽👏🏽
Fam killed it
Loved it ❤️❤️
I honestly love this
i can'tttttt<3
1:29 my favorite part 😍
Huge! So well done xx
🔥🔥🔥

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Loved it.
Badass cover!!
Oh shit ❤

*Girls frом уour citу want to meеt уou*

HETDClwTAuA,\n► http://mibik.ru/sex?x=HETDClwTAuA 😎
6lack did justice baby, yasssssss. fuck it up 6LACK
Best Like a Version in awhile
Lethargic
*yawn*
Six-lack never fails to amaze me
Definitely respect the nod to Badu. But this wasn't a good cover of On & On to me. No disrespect to 6lack though.
It sounds okay I guess, maybe because he looks so uninterested in everything it kinda puts me off, haha. There is a girl on Youtube who does a cover that's really nice, her name is Mudi
Shit sucks
Best thing since they found heroine
Not bad at all
Bring john butler on again
Yawn....
6lack makes really good music, however, this cover should not have happened...like, at all.
There's nothing remarkable about this.
This cover is trash lol this is disrespect lol
who is this sixlack?
how did he fit that rat on his head under that small ass beanie
Terrible voice
Crap
Erykah wanted to call him after hearing THIS ? Sounds lifeless to me. No feeling. #DontBelieveTheHype
Absolutely love your living room!
The area that you sit while you explain things about living room has such a good set up
Everything looks beautiful, I love all of the plants!
Beautiful!! I love you desk area xx
Love this style of video! Can’t wait to see the rest of the house ☺️
Anybody know where the large mirror is from behind her?!?! I've been DYING for one exactly like that!!
I never comment but I've been following you for ages! Congratulations on your new home, your style and interior are amazing! Great shooting and editing for this video, thumbs up for the format!!!
Ah! These spaces are so lovely! And yesss so cosy! All the plans as well eeeek, love love love x
Can I move in? or better yet can you come decorate my house for me?!?😂😂😂.....Thanks fam. I rent too and I find changing the surroundings as opposed to structural changes is all that makes sense when you don’t own the house...Although I do feel you with the fire place as our plan once we buy is to have a big wood burner for sure( with emerald green tiling preferably). I love making each space our own and adding textures etc.  Amazing style and attention to detail as usual Sam ❤️❤️❤️
you have amazing taste, and i love the format of this video!!!
Love love ❤️  Is that the ikea swivel chair?
Such a beautiful home. I love the decor
Wtf... feels like just yesterday I found your yt; a beautiful, bubbly, shy girl beauty guru. Now your this chic and inspiring #mumgoals. Love this vid Sam, hope you're having a blessed day Luv!
Our styles are incredibly different, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed both rooms. I've only been watching you for a month, but that office really seems like a great representation of you. The living room is more my speed and it does indeed look cozy and comfortable. If you don't mind me saying this, but your toddler and your husband are just beautiful. Very gorgeous family.
Such a beautiful and peaceful home <3
your home vid is beautiful. Also you hair is so pretty and curly.  Your curly style is back! :)
I love this format!
you seem very passionate about decorating... made it enjoyable to watch! lovely space!
I was under about that blue sofa at first but it really came together and now I love it in that space! Defiantly gives me some inspiration!
I really enjoy decorating and find it very therapeutic as well. Where do you find most of your inspiration? Do you have any recommendations for interior design books?
I love ur home I want it lol
Loved the rooms!! What a great style you have. Also loved the sit down chatty bit... more please?!
I love the office decor so much!
oh my god i love every part of this
love your top and jean combo, esp the top
One word comes to my mind : goals
Amazing idea, loved the video!!
Simply beautiful and cozy !  Thanks for sharing your home with us.
Absolutely loved it! Such an inspirational video
Also the sofa for me is a winner :-)
Beautifully filmed. Thank you for sharing with us xx
The video was so beautifully shot
Such a pretty home.
You look so beautiful!! Loved this style of video. Please do more. (:
Hey Samantha where did u get your cup 'the one with ur tea/ coffee in the video?
Omg I love your style goals I one day dream of having a beautiful home like yours 😍🏡

Haven't watched for awhile,  beautiful home.  What happened to her Frenchie?
I love love love your home decor design, the sofa is beautiful and all the plants and prints 😍😍😍

What collar is frank wearing? Love it. Is it ruffwear?
Because of you, Sammi....I will be shopping for plants next week!! LOL.
Love this ! Keep continuing what you do I love chit chat
This video made me smile, what a beautiful home you have Samantha! So cozy, fresh, and warm
Sammi Id like to request a video regarding financial management after marriage. How do you manage to budget? Do you combine your income? Or does Jason lets you do the budgeting around the house? You do not have to include figures, more on tips and when there are problems regarding financially how you and Jason handle it @samanthamaria
i wanna be as cozy as frank
As someone who's been watching you since '08, I am super proud of you and your accomplishments! Also, I know you are human and don't want to attract negativity and drama, but girl. You gotta be unapologetically yourself! Say what you wanna say. You're going attract haters no matter what you do/say. Let em talk (type really), cuz at the end of the day, you're still making your money, you're still a great youtuber (and a veteran youtuber on top of that), and you're still a bomb ass mom! Don't let them control your actions, especially online. Changing what you say and limiting your voice is exactly what the haters want.
Loved, loved, loved this format. Your spaces are beautiful and you can see all the love that's been put into your home.
Love you house and your interior design.. you so lovely
Love this style of video Sammi  xo
this vid is so relaxing and interesting and YOU LOOK STUNNING
Your home is beautiful and yes..very relaxing.

That couch is everything!!
You look so pretty sam! And your house is gorgeous
I would love loads of plants in the living room but they would just die lol. I love this room it looks amazing :) x
Such an inspiration Sammi! I adore everything you'e done. You've worked really well with the space you have...seriously you're making me want my own place to do that same. I can't wait to see the rest of the house. x
I feel like I stepped into a magazine watching this. This is great Sam, I always thought you had an amazing sense of style. Also, I loved the fact that you weren't just walking around with a camera showing us random stuff. I quite like your sit downs
I absolutely love this style of video and love your home xxxx
Can’t wait for more videos about your new home!
i like this style of videos. please do the rest of the house like this xx
Sammi I feel like we could be such great friends irl! You have such a sweet personality and I love your style!! 😊😊
Love this format Sam! It's wonderful. It is different than most room tours! This is creative! Love to see more rooms from your home.
I love your space! both rooms that you showed are beautiful! I just moved into my own apartment and will definitely be taking a little bit of inspiration from this video regarding my interior style :)
This is such a beautifully shot video Sammi! I feel like you got the perfect balance between sit- down chatty parts, and shots of the rooms on their own. Can't wait for more! x
The living room looks like a photo you would see in an interior magazine and be like, where is that? I wanna live there it looks so dreamy😊 i also love your filming room and i find this so inspirational
You have amazing interior style Sammi! Loved this ❤️
I always felt asking for a tour is too invasive, so I never ask but I am so excited for this! I noticed in your vlogs, the mantle in the living room and the way you style it with the plants and mirror...simply stunning😍
Hi Sam,Indie and Jason. I've been a viewer of yours since day one and so proud of you! You are amazing and one hell of a badass mum. I appreciate all your honestly and realness.\nIt's very refreshing! \nSo question for you. \nI just moved house as well and have a 4 year old daughter. Im using your decor as inspiration for my new place. Just wondering what wall colour did you use for your office and livingroom. Lots of love from Canada.
Oh my it's absolutely perfect !!
Random thought but your fringe kind of looks like a bob and I think you'd look really pretty with a curly bob
Love the format! And the chilled vibe. Much love!
Such a cuddle couch, I love!
Love the vibe of your place and the video- very chill and cool~ any chance you'll restock your candle in the near future?
I love your home 😍
I love your eclectic style! So sophisticated yet at the same time homey and inviting!
Love the style of both rooms; warm and cosy 😍... u should become an interior designer 😉
I love how well thought out this video was, super different and creative. Always enjoy your videos <3
Your style is so nice! I have a very similar style too
Ugh! Please come and sort out my flat!
super cozy! but where is riley? :(
Please get your fringe back I miss it Xxx
Where is riley??
Congrats Sam, both spaces are beautiful AND COZY 😜
Wow!
Amaaazing home, amazing style!!
I love everything 😍​

YAASSSSSS EARRINGSSSS!!!!
Ummm OBSESSED SAM! xo
That sectional is everything
House goaaaalllsss 🔥🔥🔥
Follow me on Insta for behind the scenes: www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\nWe are continuing our street food journey through Sichuan and making our way to the South of China into Yunnan. We found some incredibly delicious street foods you’re going to love in this video! And one of the SPICIEST things I’ve ever eaten!I would love to hear from you in the comments below too! Thanks so much for watching, and I hope you’re doing well and eating well!
嗨，最恨看美食频道，满满地想回国
let's eat Pork, and let the Halal go to hell.
I've been watching your videos for a while and I really enjoy them. Watching your videos has actually inspired me to become a chef and cook this kind of food. It's like an art. I love the variety of spices used and I love the many different flavors that are provided. Not to mention I love spicy foods I love the way it's prepared. I've been making things from home and found that I have a passion for it. Piano is my main thing but this will be my other goal. If you have any tips on where to start in becoming this kind of chef it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your videos and I look forward to many more!
Where is Chu Chu , tell her I want to eat  her feet.
When I saw 凉虾, I almost cried man. Such a homey desert for my childhood memory!
我吃藕😂
Congratz Trevor! Love your FOOD-DOCU. My tastebuds is longing for those delicious foods!
You should've exceeded your spice rating with a tag that says extreme, hahaha love the videos
*you might not be able to eat the raw yak*\n\nwatch me wolf down this raw yak!
Again a fantastic video Trevor;-) The last dish, Chicken feet/lamb dish was really spicy i could tell.. Steam came out of your ears.. ;-))
Do you ever miss a western breakfast ?
I love all your videos man , you are the best , will you visit Egypt soon ? you will like the Egyptian food !!!
saliva flowed out
Really nicely shot video food looks great
much love!
U have great videos and congrats on 1M subscribers, I m wondering why don't u go other countries to do video on different food,,,,,
Your poop was probably Tai Hao La burning the next day
我大华夏~\(≧▽≦)/~
Trevor if you like spicy food you should go to Hunan! It's supposed to be even spicier than Sichuan food :)
Lol I'm born n raise in Zigong, and now living in Toronto, you are like a half countryman to me now. Lol This video has gone viral in my wechat. Thanks for creating such a mouth watering video to show the world my hometown food.
Thank you for the information you gave in the video and the description box, it is handy for people who want to know the information and follow where you go. All of the menus you tried looks amazing! I'm living in Bangkok, Thailand and I really love street food. I hope one day I have a chance to travel to Sichuan and try their street food too :)
真不应该晚上看这个，而且是在我减肥的时候
why arent you fat? why
This guy's voice just soothes me
dear brother i want to know about the big give away prize to come to your trip i am from lahore pakistan i hope to win that dear trevor i want that
“ OHHHHHHH “
why u put 包子into the chilli sauce? I think the老板娘 just wanted u to put dumplings into the chilli sauce. Unlike Shanghai, in Sichuan，we usually just eat 包子without any sauce. However, if u like it, then eat whatever u want! lov ur videos in Sichuan, they make me homesick and I really want to go back to Chengdu and enjoy those delicious food❤️
It's amazing to see everything so fresh and colorful in even the tiniest of shops. America should take note.
大半夜看你吃包子。。。我好饿呀
你的中文似乎很长时间没有进步。
包子是不沾酱的啊
Do you bring your own chopsticks to restaurants?
they put cats (catmeat) in those buns...not that i have a problem with eating cats...but some people who may be squeamish, just a heads up
Are these Sichuan videos old? Trevor's Mandarin seems to be worse than recent vids...
Hello from Trinidad & Tobago Trevor. Keep up the good work
GREAT VIDEO, I WOULD LOVE TO COME OVER AND SPEND A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH YOU. I'M A CHEF AND LIVED IN KOREA FOR 13 MONTHS AND IT WAS GREAT. I'M WORKING IN A RAMEN NOODLE SHOP AT THE PRESENT, JUST WONDERING HAVE YOU BEEN TO SINGAPORE I HEAR IT IS THE BOMB.
How do you manage to poop? You eat chillies like everyday but I mean how does it not burn all the time? I ate fresh chilies once and it was nasty going to the toilet,felt that I almost had instant hemorrhoids!
Was those last dishes hotter than that one dish that the bowl was IN the table?
It is supposed to be zì gòng, not zì gōng. The second sound means you gonna cut off your little buddy.
omg...chili overdose...looks very good
gave ti u big fkn dislek
Ting Ting 🙋
Shokugeki no Soma?
very nice sir
chilli 🌶 😻
Actually my hometown is ZiGong lol
自贡是个很棒的地方，欢迎世界各地朋友来玩。:)
how i wish you visit Yunnan a little bit earlier, it's mushroom season, locals love wild mushrooms. it's a little bit late, but try to find ji zong, niu gan jun, gan ba jun, they are local's top list.
Jiaaaaoooozi baaooooozi lol
OH ! I miss my hometown ZIgong SO MUCH.
Spicy
msg again! 😅
That blade noodle salad looks so good
Lots of chilies..love it
15:27
nee haaa
So what do you do with all the large plates of food? Do you eat all of it? Seems like a huge waste of good food if you don't!
This is a great video, I love the spicy. Keep up the good work.
😍😍you make it seem so easy.you eat everything and not hesitant to try out whatevers offered.. Some food you eat i just squint my eyes while watching bcause no matter how yumm it tastes or cooked i will never eat it especially with some of the food you eat like organs ,frogs etc like damm you must have great genes to handle that😂😂😂
Why do they put MSG in everything?
I only look at the people in the background... they are the best
so wonderful, so good, thank you so much
Have you eaten dog meat?
I KNEW YOU'D PICK LOTUS ROOT
what you are doing is so cool
Hi James. You getting fat!😂
Just one question. How do you use Facebook in China? I heard that is \nblocked there. :)
love from india trevis nice work come to india pls
hope u enjoy living and eating in China!Ur video is so amazing!
isnt it disrespecting ordering so much and only eating 5% of it ??\n\nI mean thats not america where customer is the king... lol\n\ndid u miss that part in your chinese studies ? this is like really derp
Just watching this and feels like my @$$ is going to fall out.
Please also start documenting where you stay and how you travel like Mark Wiens does.
Bhai Trevor, enough of China yaar. Why don't you show us that side of Canada (ur home) & US street tours. More than 70% of Ur vids are China.
Hi man, have you ever think about posting your video on to some China video website like Bilibili. I think many Chinese are willing to watch your videos.
Plz be here for Nepal too...we have got numerous delicious food!!! Excited to welcome you in the Land of Buddha and Everest.
Who won the 1 million subscriber giveaway? I gotta know it was me!
The camera work should receive an award for this video. It is outstanding.
Hi,Trever,I just happened to see your vedio on the weibo of Chinadaily,and started following U on youtube.:) Cannot wait to see ur new vedioes:D
Do you ever....finish your food? Seems such a waste
真是恭喜你成為youtou超級網紅！\n一百多萬訂閱，超級不起的數字。\n謝謝你的工作，讓我們瞭解美味的中華美食。\n中國還有很多美食。有八大菜系，還有很多小菜系，每個菜系都很了不起的美味，希望看到你深入每個菜系瞭解，給大家最好的推薦。
Why following the Pennywise look?
We have been watching you for so long, your part of our home. What a cool show.  Keep going to all those cool places so we can visit some day!
Trevor, have you made any videos where you go to a big city, like Shenzhen, and go into a nice restaurant? Not street food but in an upscale sit down restaurant.
my boy trevor getting a little thicc
your video are very short...and seldom too..not unlike before
I'm glad there is still real food somewhere and not the commercial factory produced food in the west concocted in the lab instead of a real kitchens as shown here.
well, I see a certain Trever put on some weights over the last few months ;)
in start of this video, you walking on the street, the sound of your voice is incredible, can you tell me what kind microphone do you use?
Zigong is my hometown, so sweet, love this video.
When Food is too spicy it´s not fun. Eating should be fun and joy.
Just 2 days of net problem in my home, made me miss your videos so much
It's good that you rate how spicy the dishes are, can you do that for the rest of your videos plz?
I think it's not that spicy for me. coz I can't eat without chilli
I think ur fav place is china
Amazing! China is a place full of great things to explore with exotic foods to savour. Sichuan just makes it top notch.
oh look more sechuan cooking, yawn
Hello! This AiYe Chicken Feet is fake.The original named LiLin Supper(立玲夜宵).As locals of ZiGong I don't think that you've got the most famous food In ZiGong.
...Just for one day to experience,  what you enjoy every day there!
Can you tell me how long would I survive for in China with 10 000$?
A few flat earthers die of heart ache after each spacex video :)
wow Echostar 105? I worked at the company way back when they launched Echostar VI and VII.
elon is actually a Martian just trying to get back home. :(
I love the drone ship names...\nOf Course I Still Love You\nJust Read the Instructions
Gotta love the names of the stations “of course I still love you” and “just read the instructions” or something like it. Makes me giggle.
thanks for building the future
I dont understand how people think we can colonize mars soon when we only been to the moon a few times and alls we did was collect rocks
Wow! Kerbal Space Program has great graphics since the last updatr
Like 2 more Elons and we'll be set.
Great work! Congrats to the whole team at SpaceX.
Steady for a while at max speed at around 8000 kph. With this speed, we can reach Mars in 2.85 years. Not that long...and worth to wait
Can I suggest that when you make your rocket to mars that you create a component called The Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator?
The technology and equipment are good...
I would like to see G forces too in the telemetry section. Would be a nice thing to visualize acceleration.\n\nThumbs up if you want it too! :D
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Why is it on fire prelaunch? What was it doing?
the real one crashed they switched cams to the other barge with the prop.
Why don't you ever show a launch from the camera of a satellite or satellites? So we could see the whole operation   of launching to landing.
Every time Tom (the host) comes on and says he is a Firmware engineer all i here is, I am a Former Engineer and my first thought is WHY ARE YOU HOSTING THEN!?
SpaceX makes NASA look like the overpaid old timers afraid of change they are.
ArianeSpace and ULA are toast! \nSpaceX ate their lunch with Falcon 9. It's a very successful launch technology and SpaceX is already leaving it behind. \nNow Elon will show up the SLS with BFR! \nI cannot wait to see those things coming out of the sky and landing on a launch pad.
2017 and Space companies are still using potatoes to record :/
Anyone wanna explain the space-blizzard at 41:00?
WoW was this fastest re-entry  ? Fins glowing white and plasma show up..... WoW
what if it flies over north korea and they get the wrong idea
what the hell is that camera doing ? seriously? you send rocket to space and you cant tilt the camera steadily?
Point of order!!!! You are not launching from Cape Canaveral. KSC is technically on Merritt Island. ;-)
İ Choice The Blue Pill   Morpheus  Musk !!
Subtitles seem to be about 11 minutes behind the audio(!)
SpaceX  you need a concert like TOMITA Live at Linz in Austria 2 as you send off  :)
Its weird that Tesla cars actually accelerate faster, if you compare them side by side. The rocket just keeps going. I imagine the time when we will launch stuff to space from huge magnetic cannons, made out of hyperloops that then ignite while already hundreds of meters above ground and going just a little under speed of sound already. Could save alot of liftoff fuel payload.
This is not Russia vs America... This humanity vs extinction  ... We are all brothers and sisters... Indian guy here going I could be a part of space x some day... :D
The Russians are known for their secrecy.
Reusing rockets: what's the big deal - I do it on Kerbal all time, and with a real short turn around time: you say this is not the same thing???? ;) Congrats Elon - and people say: What can one person do? Well how about changing the whole world and much for the better?
Saw it from my back yard, 168mi south of the Cape. Awesome!
It's really wonderful. When I'm watching when this rocket is returning from space and landing, I feel like I'm watching the next chapter in space exploration. Congratulations to SpaceX. Elon Musk, I do not think you have time to read the comments, but you know how to inspire people.
How I love these starts.. more please! Also: Mars! I hope once the crew is on it's way there are daily videos of how things going - will watch it! Nothing boring in pushing the boundaries of mankind :)
You are the best
I recently flew on a 4 engine 747... can't imagine 20 engine's and how I would possibly survive, LOL!!!
I can understand camera getting screwed on re-entry, but surely the barge camera can have better than potato quality/connection. Still, awesome work. Look forward to much more and oneday seeing 31 raptor engines firing in all their glory.
Its so complicated to do, yet this video makes it look so easy.  Musk is a force of progress.
Elon Musk is the greatest foreigner to come to America since the time of Nikola Tesla. Bravo Mr. Musk.\nWish you lots of luck on your endeavors.\nIf you take advantage of everything America has to offer there's nothing you can't accomplish- Geraldine Ferraro
if they develop this rocket any further they might just go to the moon some day!
i cannot wait for the BFR
It's a bit strange that it cut out on the landing.
@23:40 In space, they play techno.
Watched it live couldn't comment at time shame visuals were lost of rocket landing but seen most of its journey well done
All bow down to Elon Musk our savior. What I would give to work with him....He will save the world.
Best\nName \nFor\nA\nDroneship
I just love SpaceX! What an extraordinary gang! They just do it :D.\nWould have been nice to see some telemetry data from the 2nd stage during its long flight.\nBut a great presentation anyway. I love watching these launches!
Is it just me or did they attach new cameras, way better quality this time around
This should shut thunderf00t
Пойду лучше на петуха из дерьма посмотрю!!!
13:54 Thank me later...
Such a beautiful takeoff!
Fuck me Alan Musk.

20:54
7:02 hellooooooooooooooooooo there !  *.*
Super décollage, bravo à vous.
What's the nuclear bomb looking thing in the background at 22:12
***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!! Shouldn't have a continuos movement as there is no friction!?  Thanks to all for answer
Part 1 Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSesIuHb3KA \nPart 2 Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg0jLrccyqc \nPart 3 Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNVGF84cys0 \n The book of Daniel is interesting but I feel many studies on it just misses the mark. Take a look at this 3-part video series on Daniel chapter 9:24~27 and see what you think. I have attended many live presentations and viewed countless online videos on this prophecy and found them somewhat lacking. You may consider this comment as being a bit strong so please forgive me and look carefully at the video material I am presenting (see links). Thanks, Art  Email Contact: mailme@cambigue.com
@43:40 can somebody please explain why the speed of second stage is decreasing? Shouldn't it remain constant?
Why did they land on the barge instead of land?  I thought land was preferable now that it has been figured out
Excuse me, I've got a question (and maybe a stupid one, because I don't know what could be the answer). Instead of focusing and spending so much money on reaching Mars, wouldn't be better to focus on asteroid mining technology? I think that once that we will be capabel to gain materials in the space, we will be able to build our rockets directly in space, so that the ammount of fuel needed will be much less becouse we will have no more to escape our gravity.\nHope that someone could clarify me that point.
Thanks for a very interesting and informative video. \n\nI am curious.. After the satellite has been released, what do you do with the part of the rocket, carrying the satellite? Do you fly it back into the earth' atmosphere, so it burns up and falls into the ocean or that happens with it? \n\nIf that is the case, how much is left when it hits the water. Are we talking parts of a few centimeters or more?\n\nKeep up the good work. I love what you are doing to the world.
others can gripe but SpaceX is showing the way forward efficient to the point of 2 launches in 3 days 2 returns in 3 days multiple satellites launched without drama, they are a trucking company doing what they do best, and by developing their own equipment they control quality, remember the plan for BFR is the equivalent of launching a decent sized 4000 ton ship into orbit and reusing it as well multiple times, we really are at a crossroads
I bore my other half to tears alot of the time when I talk about Elon Musk and the whole Space X operation... Not to mention those phenomenally stunning Tesla vehicles. He is a true visionary willing to risk his own wealth for mankind to step foot and even reside on Mars... Obviously it would mean a stupendous amount of wealth WHEN it succeeds. Would love to sit and have a coffee and chat with Elon. I admire his focus and drive on getting us to the red planet. I'm 99.999% sure Space X will get the first structure on Mars ahead of NASA.
@spacex is that the first stage landing at 22:12 on the left side one the screen?
What is on the horizon at 22:12? It looks like a nuke detonation.
Lots of space junk visible on the left camera as the 1st stage is prepping for return to earth. That's going to be a problem pretty soon I would say.
every day seems they send something up...the elite moving out?
SpaceX should send a new rocket to space everyday
Why is the drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You?
The most amazing transportation vehicle and its formed like a penis
Are there people inside?
So is it time to start buying spaceX stock?
is there anything in your rockets with batteries? like the most normal AA batteries. it'd be so hilarious...\nlike Energiser, the Most Space Batteries Ever Made (Elon Musk award) and stuff.\noh the agony of my normal side.
Bollywood celebrity Vidya balan attractive  and some hot looks and dress up\nhttps://youtu.be/8_9o0Xs08cc
weird looking rocket. lot of fancy paintings but still less than half as good as Russian rockets which take off so beautifully, very safe and reliable, unlike this american junk. here's how a rocket should take off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzsRjru86s
Where does the second stage end up going? Does it just drift endlessly now?
Ok...what happened at 14:55?
At SapceX is there career opportunity for non US citizens
20:59 Damn is this plasma ?? Good thing the first stage survived reentry
Flat ?
Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\n\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\n\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.
I wish they would display m/s instead of km/h
elon ! you are gettıng lame  hahahha

hello
The most sensible explanation I’ve heard in a long time. I’m 52 and have been listening since I was 16 with the first system I purchased back then. It is always is the mix like you said whether they can hear super high or not, it is a gift to make a recording blend right! I just laugh anymore that people post in these forums that they can really hear such great differences in 44k and 96 or 192... and if you can then sit down and take a shot like the gal did here and prove it. :-)
Dear Rick, the test would have been more trustworthy if you had chosen highly complex orchestral music (inc the applause) and try listening through good headphones and not through a 'pc out'. Thanks
Um... you realise you're listening to a streamed, chrome eq'd wav file right? Try through a DAC and it's night and day.
Meh, I got 4 out of 6 too. Also I am a professional drummer, with damaged hearing for sure, and I don't have perfect pitch. (Actually, not sure what the heck that has to do with this anyways). I could hear the difference. Hardest one is the vocal only one, because it doesn't have a huge dynamic range.
You’re right about this too! As well as the apple rant
I’m pretty sure I can tell the difference between an mp3 file and uncompressed wav... by listening to cymbals... the way they sustain is obvious
This can also depends on the soundcard of the computer, and on the player you are using! (i would especialy not trust an online player) A neutral curved (monitoring) headset is required in order to get convincing results, and well... not a headset actually but a good loudspeaker would be better. And at last you need to get several people pass the same test! \nAnd i'm not saying that as an audiophile but as a scientist... You need to make sure that your conclusion is really about the human ear and not about the audio material you are using for this experiment.
Anybody who makes music should ace this
Only able to identify 4 out of 6? That's decent.  I did this test and got 5 out of 6.  320kps is close but if I listen to records recording intimate acoustic instruments especially, I can absolutely hear the difference.  Why not use the best quality you can?  Sure, if I am making a punk rock record, I just care about the mid range.  But quality matters.  What's the point of using an mp3 at this point?  Storage is so cheap and internet speeds are at an all time high.\n\nYou are right about the 4k.notch though. I am 15 to 20db down there at 33 years of age. I need to slow it down.
Weĺl done. The thing with audiophiles is that they are usually obsessed with cables and gear and not so much with good music. Somewhere on earth a producer used pure functional stuff to record an album, gear that would give audiophiles a heart attack. And then they start playing it on a record through a 'warm' tube amp. Post-Coloring everywhere. Others like colder high pitched coloring and in reality it doesnt matter how you play it as long as you can enjoy it. It's their search for a personal nirvana similar to recalibrating a TV to get more satisfying personal  colors. Like gamers who hookup their tv's to old black and white screens because it creates a new dimension or something. People like these don't seem to enjoy music / films / games anymore. They enjoy their brand x amplfier for whatever reason. And if people reach that point in which gear becomes like a glass of wine... it's time for them to take a long holiday.
I'd be more interested in the whole musical 'picture'. Pitch only seems a very limited approach. Furthermore I like more and attitude of inquiring instead of making a statement. And you can't deny the subjectivity of the matter.
You're talking nonsense; I reserve the right to spend 1000 dollars on speaker wire, thank you very much...
Right now I want to go back to listen to what I'm into now when I'm 9 that would be cool.
also she a had 33.3% chance of guessing the high quality file.
I just took that quiz before they transitioned to her taking and, without an amp, I got 4 out of 6 right. All the Katy Perry samples sounded exactly the same, but you can parse it out better on all the remasters
I can tell the difference between lossless format and mp3.\nLossless format treble sound so much crisp, sharp,clear and details. the soundstage also sounded much wider&live than mp3. listening on my nw zx100 Walkman player and xba 300 sony iem. Lossless format + Good player + good headphones = high quality sound experience.
I had a hearing test at work last year in the little van that they pull into the  parking lot and cycle us through like cattle. While sitting in the little booth, I could see the reflection of the small laptop that was actually running the test. I noticed that when I could hear the tone, a red bar popped up on the monitor. It went off when the tone stopped. So I just pushed the button on the pickle when I saw the red bar and ignored the actual audio. I got my results and of course it was perfect. I was hearing things only dogs can hear! Like tones in the 18k range. This year I took it and just did it the old fashioned way, and the results were piss poor. But the funny part was the letter accompanying the results telling me that I have suffered dramatic hearing loss and I should see a hearing specialist
Great video, as always! :)
woooahhhhahahhahhhoooaaaawww hold on a second there buddy, let me tell you (before I've watched the full video) that I've compared a 320kbp/s mp3 of my own recorded track side by side against the lossless Wav version and the difference I hear through my beyerdynamic DT150's is that the mp3 has some softening around the edges giving off a very slightly yet noticable dullness to the high end. The Wav version has more clarity. Also it's going to be very difficult to prove your point through a youtube video when that itself is a compressed format, even on a hd setting because otherwise we'd have to somehow stream a 50GB+ file in lossless over the internet which just isn't going to be happening.\n\n*Back to watching video*\n\ncontinued: Alright so I'm seeing how you're testing which is cool, the website seems to test Which one sounds the worst Which for certain genres is easier to tell than others, I feel the recording methods play a role in this too though. For each one I could pick out the worst sounding but between 320 and wav was pretty damn difficult. I will say however people are a sucker for quality and when you know digitally recorded sound which is then compressed doesn't give you a perfectly smooth transition from fin to fin on your waveform you'd much rather resort to analog specifically for this, which you defeinitely can tell the difference on. Digital amp or tube? Tube usually wins hands down too so while we strive for the best quality we can get, digital can do just as good a job while also emulating the analog warmth and smoothness but if we know for sure then we'd choose the more authentic version which I believe this boils down to in the end. Authenticity over a compressed piece of trash, even if we can't really tell the difference ;)
Whether you can hear a difference or not, people should keep in mind that if the difference has reached a  conscious awareness to the point where you can actually pinpoint things like cymbals sounding different, the difference in the ineffable or unnoticed factors must be HUGE. It's not as if music - or any other enjoyable experience, for that matter - is composed of merely these easily identifiable and noticeable aspects. Listening to a little clip and just trying to pick out some difference is pretty far from a test that makes any sense if what you care about is the full lush experience.
It is an interesting video, however there are a few flaws with your logic. Firstly from a technical standpoint, there is a measurable difference. You can subtract the output from the MP3 file from the WAV and have a file that contains the 'differences'. Play this file you'll here quite audible stuff. Certain things like string sections and cymbals do not compress welll you'll hear the echoes of those. So there is a tangible difference especiallly to people who know what to listen to. Secondly, from a business perspective just because someone else can't tell the difference in quality shouldn't mean I deserve worse quality? Apply that logic to a restaurant or any other business. Finally, the problem with the test is that modern music is now created to compress well and is therefore harder to spot compression. This was not previously a constraint, so depending on the listener you need to restrict the content of the test to pre/post MP3/download era music.
You know this proof is rock solid with that MASSIVE sample size
What's the name of the track at the end?
In Photography, It's important to shoot in RAW format, because RAW format records more info about the captured image, in the dark, and in the bright parts. But photographers deliver compressed JPEG images, the RAW format are only helpful during post-processing. I think it's somehow the same with Audio recording.
I don't know if I'm missing something of the discussion by Rick (which I always appreciate and follow), in this case, sorry. It seems to me that we are not talking about WHAT GEAR you are using to play the music. It's out of question that with a cheap computer playing the music you are not gonna hear differencies between different audio formats. I'm surprised the girl succeded in telling the right ones 4 out of 6. But if you have a correct hi fi system (which by no means it is a cheap computer!), you're gonna hear the differencies more more clearly because a good hi fi system enhances the differences like a microscope. I'm talking about CD reproduction (and of course vynil, but we're talking about digital files here). With my system without any difficulty I can tell the differences between different editions of the same music in cd format, ... and an MP3 file would sound terrible compared to an original CD audio file. It's out of question, I made this experiment several times. Even a semi deaf man could tell the difference, my Dad in his seventies clearly tells the differencies and recognize quality files from the less quality ones. Thanks
I agree with all of the points made in this presentation.
Great video! Comparison tests are extremely difficult, since we'll mix the information of the different files with each other. Differences will become bigger over longer time.
This is not very accurate. The girl doesn't have a clue what an audiophile listens for. And the Yamahas are used for checking the balancing between the instruments and to give an idea how the recording will sound on a more common (crappy) stereo equipment. This is how commercial record industry produces records. They ought to have used well produced jazz recordings instead. There's no compromises on those recordings. This is just a fraction of what's wrong with the industry.
I am so glad to hear your opinion on this...  I've never considered myself an audiophile.  I've never needed to have that recliner sitting exactly in the middle of the room with the best speakers in the perfect orientation, etc.  I have never been a professional musician, but I've been actively around music for 45 of my 48 years, and I do think I have a good ear for what sounds good, and what is a well produced recording.  I tend to be able to pick out and appreciate instruments that are deep in the mix and add to the rhythmic complexity or harmony in a song, and am constantly saying to my wife Dont you hear that <whatever> doing those 8th note triplets softly in the background? That's what makes this song so cool to me..   to which she ALWAYS says I was paying attention to the lyrics..  :-)  I notice noise gates kicking in and out, I notice harmonizers and auto-tuned tracks, and other things like that, but GENERALLY dont know or care what sampling frequency or bit depth something has been converted to.  The ONE exception that has been bothering me recently, which I would LOVE to hear your comments on, is SIrius/XM.  I have noticed recently, especially on their special/temporary Billy Joel channel, that it seems the allocated bandwidth is SO BAD that it sounds worse than an old cassette recording, even on stuff I KNOW was studio recorded DDD.  I've been wondering if anyone else has been thinking SXM is perhaps trying to stretch their bandwidth across too many available channels these days??   On a semi-related note.. I still remember the first time I heard Dire Straits Brothers in Arms CD.  I think that was the first DDD CD I had ever heard, and to this day, it's my go to when I want to hear how a system sounds.  So well produced and noise free!
Where you can really tell the difference is the low-level information as notes reach the end of their decay (such as is the case with reverb ring off).  Data compression on soft passages is completely obvious.  While this is moot point for most popular music, I imagine that most audiophiles concern themselves more with classical, jazz, world music, folk, etc. that has a much broader dynamic range.
well, if I request download tracks in 24bit 44.1khz, it's simply for DAW compability. I had a freeware DAW once, which enabled me to only record and export in 32bit floating point. My phone couldn't handle those files porperly, so that's why I prefer 24, 44.1, it just works.
No one uses CD players any more? I guess I'm a dinosaur.
Coincidence or not, the song she said she loved, she got wrong! probably because she was playing more atention to her memories than the song itself...\nThe things I have against MP3 is that some audible artifacts remain even at 320kb/s and it doesn't have native gapless playback, that is the reason I use opus at 200kb/s\nI can't tell the difference between a 128kb/s opus and the uncompressed WAV, I use 200kb/s just to be on the safe side\nnewer lossy format have noise-like compression artifacts, so even at sub-90k bit rates it can be pleasurable to listen to... if you enjoy music more than the specs of your system, of course
Hearing and listening is not the same thing.
i remember electro harmonix 2880 looper rendered recordings wavs and I thought ok I'll convert all my saves to mp3, 100+ 10 minute x4 loops takes a lot of space. I was scolded for it, by a friend who claimed i'd ruined the lot including some of his work. I just converted his loops back to wav and claimed I had kept them aside but had forgotten about it. He didn't notice any deterioration of sound at all, so yeah Rick's post resonates with me.
it's not about kHz, it's about artifacts in the sound. Even watching this video in youtube, i got 4 out of 6 too
People should shut the fuck up, if they don't have a clue of what they are talking about. The difference between compressed and lossles audio is huge, everyone with decent gear knows that.  Only someone who has never heard a lossles file on adecent gear would ever say that mp3 is enough. \nNnot to mention people generally agree that 44,1khz is not fast enough, for the cd to obtain anywhere near the sound quality that a master tape or a vinyl has. \nOr do you also think that any device capable of 44,1khz will sound the same aswell?
Perfect pitch does not enable someone to hear difference in audio quality.
Of course the right answer in the listening test is the one that takes longer to load!
I would like to see a version of this test where you arrange the samples based on your perception of which is the best, second best etc. That would be interesting...\n\nThat would show better if there's any difference between them.
Thanks for a great post Rick. I just happened to be testing my own hearing 2 hours ago after a day of tracking guitars. I'm 53 and I can comfortably hear up to 13.5K then it gradually drops off. 15.5k needs a 15 db boost but I can hear it as the cat dives for cover. What is this 4k notch you mentioned?
Please stop comparing sample rate with bit rate, otherwise great video.
I think we should still consider frequencies outside of our hearing ability range because it's not only our ears that responds to frequencies. Our entire body does.
i also got 4/6 right but i REALLY had to listen closely like i never did before XD i took the test with Beyerdynamic DT-990 Pro and it was HARD i would say for average listeners 128k mp3 is totally fine
Great video, but for me, NOTHING sounds better than a CD or LP, specially when you´re holding the booklet/cover, reading the lyrics and watching the photos or the art. (I think I´m in the audio-fooled category, hahaha).
I've been recording my latest releases purposely in 16bit 44khz.  I find it easier and more comfortable to mix. Than 48khz 24bit.   And it goes down to MP3 formats fairly easily.  Sounds fine.  This could also be just in my head.
Fun fact : youtube's sound quality is 192kbs-mp3 and people are typically completely fine with that

i love your dad
I got my picture with you and the rest of British team! SO COOL!
Amazing. Watched your progress this year & has been amazing, down to hard work, drive, and commitment. Great example :)
Can't even tell you how much you make my day . I love your videos 😃💕
Amazing as always❤❤Keep working hard and doing what you love. I have a GREAT IDEA to tell you, my twitter is @peque2111 in case you want to contact me!
The thing I love about your videos is that everyone is having so much fun.
We could hear your dad yelling Nile. every time you competed all the way back to the  USA. lol.    We could hear him yelling Nile in the back ground of other gymnasts in the go.  \nYou must be one man-of-steal, coming from the back of the pack to the top 8.  Congrats.
So happy for you, keep up the amazing work.
Dude! Caught you on the coverage. Surprised my dad knowing stuff about men's gymnastics. It's all down to you! I know the scoring system and also how far you've come! Didn't know that 3 months ago and it's all down to you!!
Your dad and you are my favorites haha. Thanks for keeping it real!
You'll be on that podium in Tokyo:)
Too bad you didn’t metion some other teams, for example what happened to Epke with his one arm thing.\n\nNonethetless, epic bro, outstanding job. You will be nr 1 some day, I just know it!
So happy for you 🎉
Well Done Nile and GB Team Brilliant
Well done pal ! 6th in the world (for me) even being the sixth best nose picker would be an achievement ! after doing your leg in is Quality ! I watch gymnastics now on TV solely down from watching your vlogs  and the YOUTUBE SENSATION THAT IS YOUR DAD ! great family ! All the Best pal and good luck in future Comps ! my family will be watching GB ALL THE WAY :) ! !
Well done so happy he is ranked 6th in the world
YOUR GIVING HAS TO BE GREATER THEN YOUR EGO
6th mate, sixth.... SIXTH IN THE WORLD! That is immense. Stay humble buddy x
Nile, you remind me of my son, Danny. Congratulations from The United States!
your father is simply a sensation 🏋🏽😂. Very sympatic⭐️
I feel like this was a perfect conclusion to his journey with his injury 8 months ago
Just brilliant ...well done to team GB Well done for You > Nile... Awesome bar...
Nile I met you at worlds! Love the vids and the gymnastics, keep it up!
I found it interesting how Nile looks so different when competing versus what we get to see at the Leeds Gym. You see the fun loving guy turn into a professional looking and acting gymnast when it comes to representing his Country. Congrats.\nDaniel did an excellent job free stylin
my coach was probably here
Yay you mentioned the women!!! Love that!
So proud! You really inspire me with your passion! But seriously How Can you be this cute😍
Where are you from?
In the intro I was like wait he didn’t say “you alright” and his friends called him out I was like thank god because I was having anxiety 😂
That intro though got the song stuck in my head 😂💁
I was there!!!! I saw u and you were incredible!
What an amazing adventure.  Getting to meet you, Bram,your dad, and the GB boys made my year.  Your injury recovery was stunning!  Hope to see you in Glasgow!  <3
I've been a fan for a long time and it makes me feel so good to see you succeed and be so proud of yourself!\n\nEdit: Wow, that was really cheesy
Nile how did you like Canada? And did you like us Canadians?
Make a video climbing
Looking at the classification, Nile matched the winning score for the horizontal bar, so would've shared the gold had he qualified and produced his same performance? Am I reading that right?
WELL DONE YOU GUYS❤❤❤❤ LOVING THE RAPPING😅😅
I finally did my round off flick TUCK BACK !!!!!!!
you seem to be such a nice and kind person nile,  hope the best for you. Keep doing what you do, keep it real
I'm 15 and I'm a profesional swimmer. After watching your videos I want to be a gymnast as well this really encourages me. I've gone through your 7 step to success, it helped me, but I want to know more about how do I start to train what exercises should I do? I think I'll buy your body bible programme to know more or how to do a hand stand for an example
Hi nile! Been a fan for quite awhile. Can i have some advice on how to get ripped like you? Like what trainings or weight liftings you do and what diet. Im 5'7 and i weigh 87 kg. Ive been strugling to cut down me weight. Would love to follow some of your routines. Thanks and much love more power.
Props, dude.
Well done mate
pause at 5:47
Nice job nile
Roids

Love your dad, haha! Congrats,  Nile!
Is it a bit weird for you guys that so many of the girls are young?
I live in Ireland and you should be the best gymnast
Ive actually stopped watching alfie for a while now but i used to watch him every single day but i switched to some other youtubers like logan paul and a bunch of american youtubers and i came across your video yesterday and i was really shocked by the fact that i actually stopped watching you for some weird reason! Your vlogs are filled with nothing but love and positivity and we can see how genuinly good you are alfie!💜 without mentioning your inspiration quotes you say that i ALWAYS take into consideration!! And for all the people reading this i want you to get up RIGHT NOW LIKE LEAVE YOUR PHONE and go do the thing you’ve always wanted to do! Go say i love you to all the people that mean something to you! Spead positivity and love, love you alf💜💜

Hi Alfie !! I love your vlogs :)
I bet Trump will tweet that rap thinking it is in support of him.
Macklemore's version had a lot more fur coats.
Eminem thinking he's black.
I have deleted scenes on my channel too :D
You know your terrible when even Rappers feel comfortable mocking you
out of touch middle class, funny
Aw man, I was expecting them to honk more and Eminem would tell them Fuck You! What a missed opportunity
Eminem being used by Hollywood to distract people from being disgraced by Harvey Weinstein.
All of these idiots saying Trump is unqualified because he hosted the apprentice and now they want an ex-addict washed-up rapper just because he agrees with them...has all logic been lost?
so now that em bashed Trump, the faggot left is cool with that. Back in the day I remember when Eminem ripped on homosexuals and was against exactly what's he's doing today. you cockroaches will never succeed in life and even after death. the joke is on you useless fucks.
will the real macklemore please stand up please stand up
eminem broke? (((they))) are getting desperate...
Why are those Black gentlemen just staying there? DEAD! 😂😂😂😂
When did Slim become parody of himself!! Edgy stuff LOL
Watch Trump tweet  loser eminem is failing and he has low ratings.
Who's Macklemore? Never heard of him.
Im really glad that guy is working for Colbert. He was one of my favorites on Conan
I have no clue what I just watched.
I wanted the horn beep to be timed to censor some of the lines with cussing in them, that would've been fantastic. You missed your one shot, and that opportunity comes once in a lifetime
That's no Macklemore, that Vanilla Ice obviously! The nerve of some people...
I am offended by this
What a joke
They totally clowned him.
Bruh lmao
This is stupid...
Lmao
Kkkkkk
Em is whack
Run him over......
Just ruined a freestyle rap congrats
its g-eazy
funny.
Slim dickhead , fookin spotty little Herbert, slim anus fookin dick!!
This is a miss. It undermines a powerful message.
The car's logo/decal is the Late Show's logo. Nice detail
True, Em is eerily quiet on Trump compared to Bush.
Come on now, that ain't Mackelmore... that's Dan Smith from BYU.
i get that it was scripted but what the fuck was this??
Subsribe me i will subscribe i back
Woah, woah, woah.... Slim shady, take a rest, old man. Catch your breath before you keel
Oh look Fake Fox News is not getting that covered !
ageing washed up has been. just retire old man you are embarrassing yourself. from Australia with love.
that guy looks promising. I think he'll go places
Oh man, Yellowwolf really let George Bush have it in that freestyle!
Is that Macklemore? - I died.
Should I drop this covfefe pot on donald trump?
Artie Kendall should show up after that
That was exactly my thought.\n\nMove it
Eminem resembles drake with the beard
Cringy.  What is this ? Snl
Idiot
I love Evanescence!
lol
Lol
Where did his windshield go?
Where's Skittles ?
😂😂😂😂
Close enough I say.
BRUH! This freestyle have Trump supporters, you knowcloset racist so mad. They calling him everything but a child of god. That goes to show you like Trump said QOUTE: I can shoot a man in broad daylight and not lose 1 supporter might even gain a few. Trump called men expressing there rights sons of bitches but has yet to condemn the Las Vegas mass murderer if PEOPLE TRUMP supporters is the problem they will not call Trump out on one of his lies! That my people is SCARY ASF? He even lost the VOTE but all you hear is he won? That's like the Patriots winning the Super Bowl but lose cause the NFL P.A. said no we're giving it to the Browns JUST CAUSE. This my folks is why we should not vote next election everyone in America cause obviously they gone pick the candidate who will distract the American's the most why they do there dirty work.
My comment was NOT edited
So this is what Vanilla Ice has been up to all this time.
Being dissed by Eminem should be considered an honor.
We're with your Macklemore 🤣😂🤣😂
Excuse me!
Trump, ur an fagit, k.
00:37 = Why are those black gentlemen just standing in the back? They're not saying anything.\nYES! YES! YES!  As much as I enjoyed Eminem's lyrics, I was totally bewildered by his entourage. I wonder how much those men got paid to literally stand around and do nothing. LOL
I was waiting for Stephen's reaction to this 😂
We’ve come a long way from Bach.
Embarrassing just totally embarrassing. \nNo flow, time to retire Em. I loved ya back in the day. But it's time to hang it up man.
that bitch in the car is ugly as fuck!
was this supposed to be funny? you failed
Eminem is cringe !! 😂
The wigger queer looks like he's got Aids
Are we supposed to believe M&M hangs out in parking garages?
Lol comparing eminem to macklemore really now, I mean I know it's a joke but eminem legacy is immortal, he's among the greatest
Do people even still listen to Macklemore?
Hey guys we almost have a 50 subscribers! Help us get it 🙌
The level of disrespect 😲
Has Eminem dissed Weinstein?
One migrant offspring moron bigot dissing another migrant offspring moron bigot
That was lame af lol
Eminem is worth 10 Macklemores. Just saying 😝
bubble currency resistance online magazine busy race clinical.
what emi rap trump ?
those black dudes woulda beat his ass
Ashamed you called him macklemore
Cuckbert
Rap doesn't matter
Who's Macklemore?
https://www.facebook.com/pbs/videos/10155285354243675/
How is this comedy this isn't funny at all
WHO THE FUCK IS THIS LOSER NAMED MACKLMORE?
But who is macklemore?
Meanwhile niggas is still dying in the street by the hands of the police.... hold on I wonder if it was a Sandy Hook every day would this still be the message?
I've been lukewarm on Em for a while but THIS... oh HELL yes.  FINALLY, one of the hip hop crowd had the balls to say it.\n\nFunny how The ICP and now Eminem have more balls than most of the sycophant cowards in Hollywood and almost ALL of the garbage in political office.  My entire family falls somewhere along the LGBT spectrum of things and thanks to that monster and his religious zealot fundies, we all live in fear everyday of what he's going to try and pass.  When does Pence make it legal for those horrible conversion centers to go nationwide?  Or strikes down marriage equality for my little sister?  They've already made it legal for religious folkes to discriminate in ANY venue, denying employment, denying education, denying medical care?\n\nHow far does he have to go before we finally do something and impeach this monster?  He's attacking his own citizens while hurricanes and wildfires kill hundreds and leave thousands homeless.\n\nConservatives, we can all argue about gun laws and taxes later.  PLEASE, put these things aside for once and let's work together as Americans to remove this embarrassment from the world stage!
Eminem went easy on him
I hope this isn't undermining what Eminem did. I hate Rap but I can get behind Eminem on this one.
what a role model. eminem is trash.
Hi I’m Eminem. I became famous by being a drug addict who constantly made songs about murdering women and raping my mother. My political opinions are rational and well thought out though.
*Eminem is simply the greatest - He is a true American hero who loves his country more than false fame or money*
P!nk always loved Guns N' Roses, on her Try This Tour she sing Welcome to the jungle!!!\nGuns are her idols!!! She looks so happy!
Axl's smile truly is something, right?
That was great but why bring her out at the end of the song? It would have been awesome if they sung the entire song together. What was the point at all?
justin bieber will be doing november rain at the next show
reverence for legend
Love that she is clearly a fan as well!
Guns n' pink roses👍
5:46 someone just got the best orgasm in their life
If Axl had just used rasp for that final scream... Anyway, pink did a good job
Pink's reaction would totally be my reaction. Thank you SO MUCH for sharing. This was AMAZING. God, I love these guys so much. They are so amazing and continue to make me sm:)e to this day!
I never thought i'd call a GN'R concert moment cute, but that was.  She was clearly nervous and excited just like any one of us would have been.  Axl is an amazing human being as always.
Way much better than metalligaga
Goodness starts at 4:20
Axl's face looks like a drum with the skins pulled way too tight.
My memories just driving around lost but now am found ...
..time is cruel to some people.. wow 😳
Dam he's fat.
Always Loved Guns N’ Roses but this live performance isn’t that satisfying to me, well the singing that is
Both axel and pink put on weight
Pink showed respect and she sang it note for note. I like her now!
Who's the old woman Pink is singing with?
AXL just whispered in her ear  be in my dressing room in ten minutes gonna take care of that Pink  😎😋
Wow i never thought I'd see GNR trending :^D
She's gained a few pounds. Never liked her till I really gave her half a chance. She's  not bad.
Everytime Guns N Roses comes on the radio I turn it up and jam. Much love. ❤
Slash never changed his look. What a legend.
Sweet!!!! love the video!!!!!!
I love you Axel but damn, get on a Stair Master why don't cha...
Damn that just reminds me just how many years went by. Here's to everyone that plans on picking and playing forever. I think I'm going to dig out my old GNR fake book.
Great if they do an unplug session with the crowd.
Love pink but axel is still a shitbag
You are the KING of Youtube concert videos!!  You're even cool enough to tell people what camera you use!  Keep up the good work and rock on!!
Pink = Lorna Morgan.  Check her out doing Glitter in the Air and I Don't Believe You on LP Funhouse.  Tear your heart out on the second one................First one is simply gorgeous.
Get video.  Do you mind telling me what model and type of camera your using.
2 fat old lesbians singing out of tune.
best trending video since trump took office. damnit. i went political. sorry.
Good thing the instruments drown out his vocals.   Time has not been good to axl..
AXL GETTIN FAT AGAIN! CUT DOWN ON THE TACO BELL MR. ROSE!
Where's his neck?
Pink was just at end...bruh
I can't believe Slash is back! Please keep going GNR!!
I saw them in St. Louis in July. Best fucking concert I have ever seen! I am so happy they are doing this for the fans!! They started on time and Axl was the last off the stage and thanked all the fans for coming to the show!
Queria que minha mulher me olhasse igual a pink olha p axl S2
still beautiful, and that's only like 5% of the experience in comparison to GNR in their prime early 90s. time machine please.
Amazing footage. I was on the floor.
Wow! I knew from the moment I clicked on this, she would be absolutely amazing!
My eldest daughter saw her first pink concert when she was 7yrs old she now 12 now my youngest is going to see her first pink concert at the age of 7 as well. Next when she tours Australia. I would love for her to sing some Guns n Roses They are also one of my Favorite bands. Can't wait.
Highlight of the day... Really cool
I like Pink. He seems like a nice man.
Que linda! Visivelmente emocionada! Me deu uma agoniazinha dela saindo do tempo, mas foi da hora
WTF was that??!;!
!!! !! !!!\n!!! !! !!!
hellyeah!
That worked.
Que lindooo!! 😍
More like guts n roses, fatty
Johnny Deep Dish
slash is back??
his girdle is showing
He ignored her .
Hmm a bit plump??
You can call me chubsy ubsy
Still my favorite band.
FUUUUUUUUUCK
fucking biblical
👏🏻👍👏🏻

AXL Superstar.
I hear. Axle. Rose lead singer acdc now
Pink is great
Axl wants to smash
Where was Billy Joel?
guns n roses ft. SIA please
adorooo
Pink jest WIELKA!
That was tremendus.
2 dykes in love.
Foda
cringe
axel is fat jajja
Trash hahhahahaha
estuvo chingon! jaja es pink no es otra vieja, esta bien!
great song
The 🐐
That was dope
Pink's reaction is literally all of us. That was cute. Im happy she did it since Ill never get a chance :))
Who’s that fat guy with too much plastic surgery standing next to pink?
Lmao he sucks ass now!
Sadly a 5 year old child died later after the concert. Apparently it was sitting next to the catering table and was devoured by Axel and Pink screaming as they covered it in ranch dip.
No one comes close to Axel's singing talent, still the best
It's pretty neat seeing Pink who is incredibly talented in her own right truly star-struck singing next to Axl-people talk shit on him today but there was a time before the internet humanized everyone that Axl Rose was not the biggest rockstar on the planet but the biggest Star period-where he looked like a god on MTV-a one to two year period nobody could touch that guy--love him or hate him that is a fact
:-(
PISS SONG!
Axel should retire.
Dude’s built like a snowman.
so glad that the original guns n' roses got back together brings me back to 1987
Lmao! Just lmmfao!!
Axl sos el puto amo
She got fat as hell
wow how far gnr have fallen and pink sucks

Coccinelle is pronounced Kochinelle, which, in Italian, means lady bugs! As always lovely video, the green Gucci bag is the stuff of dreams 😍😚
Not a fan of the bangs
the frinch suits you so much Amelia!!❤❤
Your hair!❤️
Love your hair girl! 💁🏼😘
Love the fringe! I’m thinking of getting one too now 😅 xxxx
Hey i love your hair but i think you should do your eyebrows a little bit lighter thought, because it just looks a little too much under the fringe like that's the only thing we see. Love you 😘😘😘
I was in love with your hair :( . Your handbag collection is life ! Sooo good pieces
i love that chanel bag, it's such a great size (mini yet still fits everything you need) - i think u should sell it & buy it in another color!
i've never been this early!! love from australia 💕💕
Oh, no! Your fringe looks like mine, that I made myself when I was 8... Please, change it!
The floral gucci looks amazing!
Love love love your style
Beautiful collection
They seem very cheap
Your hair 😍
Love ur handbag taste 👌🏼
Hehehhe Amelia!! The name of the pink bag with the half heart is pronounced “coxinelle”, it’s in french 😊
The fringe fits you so well!! You look so damn chic! Urgh! Loved this video as always (your cutaways are by far the best)
Coccinelle was founded in Italy, so the Italian pronounciation would be like tagliatelle in the end, and the cci is pronounced like chi in tai chi.
The fringe makes you look even prettier
I came here to see your new beautiful hairstyle❤
Love your hair today, girl !!
You look French with your fringe.
It's pronounced Coxinelle (in french coccinelle means ladybug)
That first bag is super chic and functional!  I'm in search of a good work bag and that one definitely caught my eye
Beautiful collection! But what happened to your beautiful Chanel m/l classic?????:(
WOW, Love those bangs, makes you look adorable, a blooming teenager.
You suit your fringe so much! I used to have one and they're awesome ❤️
OMG, I'm catching up on your videos and I only noticed the fringe AFTER the 12:37 minutes long video was finished and the thumbnail of the next one clued me in. That is how well you suit the fringe, it's automatically accepted by my brain as perfectly Amelia. Congratulations on getting the perfect fringe.
I love your outfit in the video! Is it a dress or top and where is it from?
I giggled when you said you own few green clothes while you were actively wearing a similar blue green top, though you may have done that on purpose
Great video ..... your petrol Gucci bag is size small and the pink one is the mini ....  I have the new royal blue velvet Gucci bag in the medium size and it's quite a bit bigger than yours 🌟🖒
i feel like it's been ages since a sit down video like this, i really loved it, makes me want a designer bag so much 😻😻😻
Love all the bagss they are exactly how i like ❤️❤️
Hi :) in english it would be something like kotcheenaellae\n\nIt's italian, and it means ladybugs!
Loved this video and your hair!!!
If I ever won the lottery I would buy every bag in this video\n😂😂😂
waahhh so beautiful 😍
Thats a lot of money for those bags
Nice fringe x
Love your bangs!❤  Your hair is gorgeous!! 👌
Coccinelle is pronounced cokcinelle meaning ladybird in French :)
http://ameliaalicebryson.blogspot.com/?m=1
Amelia it is pronounced coXinelle 😊
which is the gorgeous lipstick youre wearing?
Such a versatile collection !!! 👌🏼😍😍😍😘
Love the hair omg😍❤
Fabulous collection 💕
The brand is COCCINELLE! kisses from Italy,Sicily!!
Love your Multi Jumper, so cosy and cuddly.   Fave bag out of the ones you have is the Black Gucci 🖤  (p.s. Loved the yellow/gold 3 tier dress you wore in Paris).
Your handbag collection is so whimsical! Lovely! Thanks for sharing.
Love the new haircut it suits you 😍👍🏻
I was just thinking how badly I'd love to see an updated designer handbag collection! Literally read.my.mind! ((:
Your new fringe looks greattttt on you!
That multicolour knit jumper looks INCREDIBLE on you! Love that vibe. I'm surprised you don't use a cover for your glasses.
Where is your black dress from!?
wow beautiful collection. btw what is the name of you nail polish color? its so beautiful.
That fringe is 😍😍😍 you look amazing.
A little bit jealous and a big happy for u~ LOL
I love the fringe on you!! Can you please tell us the lipstick you are wearing in this video?
I live in NY and I am always nervous to take nice bags out during the day.... BUT that givenchy bag is soon stunning! <3 <3
What size laptop can you fit in the Givenchy Antigona Bag?
Hi Amelia , please can  you let me know where the Mac/ trench coat is from that you are wearing with the Gucci Marmont ? Thanks
Hey Amelia, i know this isnt your kind of thing but could u pls consider doing a bridal makeup look? Im getting married in dec and i love the way you do makeup. Basically i love everything about you!
Always love your bag collection!
Saks has the nude shade every now and then on the website and you get shipping to other countries. I have the blush and floral Gucci bag. Hope you get to get it just be patient. Xo
beautiful collection, enjoy! would LOVE to see an update to a vid you did 2 years ago, it had your LVCash rose ring, 15 luxury accessories?!? can't recall exact name! was one of my fave vids you have done + would make a great tag vid!! xx
i WOULD LOVE a patent leather bag. Reminds me of the 80s/90s style. I am definitely searching for the right patent leather bag. ♥
Oh my, love these videos!! So happy you uploaded xx
OBSESSED with the blush coloured one!!! i love pink so much and i especially love pink accessories to wear with black or monochrome outfits. also i reeeaaallly love your hair!!! it really suits your face and looks so sophisticated but also fun and flirty at the same time!
The pink sage bag looks just like the antigona but different on the bottom
Love your dress! So sweet and looks very comfortable. 💕
With the velvet bag ...try a baby's toothbrush or a rubber glove to gentle rub over where the velvet is wearing ...it should rebuff it.xx
Always loving your collection and style in everything❤️😘😍
Your hair looks so good 😍 It suits you very much.
i looooove the valentino glam locket in red with your flowery shirt :))))))
I really love your hair! Best decision ever
I'm seriously considering getting bangs now.  They suit u so much Amelia ❤Also love this video and ur lovely bags,  the gucci velvet one is Def my fave 😍
Coccinelle means Ladybug, and it's pronounced cock-see-nell, if you ever wanted to know! ;) That being said, Gucci really upped their bag game lately!! I was never really into their stuff, but every bag you showed in here and the ones I've seen around are sooo pretty!!!
Omg the fringe is everything!!
Your hair is much classier like way! Well done for improving yourself and taking on constructive criticism
Wow you change your hairstyle why ? Amelia Liana .?
this really bags me :P
I feel somebody is not a fan of valentino.. don’t blame you 😂
I haven't heard it pronounced, but my guess would be it's coxinelle like L'Occitane - l'oxitane x
shoe collection???
Please trim the bottom of the lace dress!  Love your videos!
it's pronounced cox-ee-nelle.. which means ladybug in french :)
Can’t decide between whether to get the Gucci velvet bag or the saint Laurent sunset bag🤔
Omg I thought you were wearing makeup until you started applying your makeup. Your skin is perfection!!!
You mean... you weren’t wearing makeup at the start of the video????? Wow goalsssss
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3I8AYNGywk&t=82s
wow your product arrived the next day, meanwhile i just got an email from them saying my order's gonna take longer than expected (more than 5 business days) so unfair :(
i wonder if they ship out of UK, do they ship in other parts of Europe too, when ordering from the UK site?
It took me like 10 minutes, till you applied the perfecting tint, to realize you had no makeup on... looking gorgeous Anna xxx
Not sure that I agree with the shade range being broad if there are only 5 shades ??? is it 5 shades of Caucasian ?  that aside I wish they'd ship to Aus already
I’m not sure this brand is really worth the hype. I have made an order but am not expecting that much really. The choice of products is really limited too. Let’s see how it goes but to be fair  I’m more excited about beauty pie
ArzuJann
Your hair looks so luscious!!!!
Getting my order delivered tomorrow😄
So helpful!!!! Thank you xx
HOLA muñecas a que hora salen por el pan bizcochitos
Bloody loved this, I know what's going on my Christmas list now!! Ps Anna you look gorgeous!! 😍
This was a great review 👏
Thanks for doing this review, Anna, I love your reviews!
Best set of reviews on Glossier that I’ve seen so far. You’re awesome. Now I know what I’m going to get and what colors. Xo 😘
Amazing review and really helpful! My bank balance is going to take a hit tonight! X
Your skin is so flawless! When the video started I thought you were wearing make up!
I really enjoy the Milky Jelly Cleanser but the Super Bounce did nothing for me. I have seriously dry, dehydrated skin and I felt very tight after using it.
That's a great lip color on you. I tried it and it didn't work. I thought the Generation G lip colors were toooooo drying and matte on me. The Stretch Concealer is my GO TO concealer...even with 56 yr. old undereye skin. It looks like skin and doesn't crease or settle!  Thanks for the review.
I can't wear sunscreen directly on my skin. So I have to layer it on top of my moisturizer.
Thank you for this!! Super helpful. Feel like I can justify a couple new purchases now :)
Love the milky jelly cleanser.  The wowder made me break out.  I kept trying it because I really like the finish.  I have oily skin, acne prone skin and I just couldn't make it work.  The cloud paints were great, but after an hour they would disappear off my face.  I really wish they had more staying power.  Probably better for drier skin.
The Glossier Cloud Paints are my fave! I add a small dab of Puff to Dusk and it creates the most natural rosy nude. I find Dusk on its own to be too brown, and Puff to be too bright pink but together - perfection :)
Why is this on trending😐👏🏼
I had a bit of a glossier shopping spree the Monday when uk shipping became available, after watching this I'm really happy about my choices and am looking forward to receiving them. I got the haloscope in quartz, the balm dotcom trio (rose, birthday and cherry) and the phase 2 set (light, brown and zip). Zip looks like it could be the exact wore look red I've been trying to find for months, I can't wait to try it all!!
Thank you for reviewing the body products as I was mulling those over. I will now give them a pass as I too have sensitive skin and can't tolerate overly fragranced products. Also, anyone with sensitive skin or Rosacea prone skin should always avoid chemical sunscreens and opt for the physical sunscreens.
Please make a skin care video with your favs, your face skin is awesome!
I can't get enough of the coconut balm dot com and Milky Jelly Cleanser!
Thanks Anna. Super helpful, well presented review. I was trying to resist buying anything and then, bang!, you hit us with the 10% off code. I've just bought half of the Glossier website and couldn't be happier! Hoping Cake Generation G will make me look as fly as you and Allana :]
you always come up with the most helpful and well thought out videos! btw you're skin looks absolutely incredible! when you started putting make up on I got so confused hahah xx
I made my first Glossier order a few weeks ago and ordered one of almost everything! The only thing I do not care for is the skin tint. It makes me look like an oil slick about 2 hours in. Loved this review and you are the reason I made the order in the first place!
Oh man - Wish I'd watched this before I ordered some products! I need some Generation G!!
Love the thorough review! I'm also waiting for Glossier to release a bronzer :).
As a Combo skin, sensitive, dehydrated and acne prone skinned girl - the original priming moisturizer is holy grail for me. Changed my skin for the better.
Thank you for this Anna, very informative and on the strength of this have ordered a few items to try. I don’t know if you have been asked this before, and I know you’re pushing Glossier here, but have you ever tried any of The Ordinary serum products? If you have, I wondered how comparable you found them to say the Glossier serums? Thanks.
LOL definitely pale! - Right there with you! Thanks for the reviews, I placed my order the other day and can't wait to get it!
Thanks Anna! Really great informative video, my Glossier shopping list just got longer! Also noticed you are number 8 on Trending!!
You have such amazing brows, do you do anything to tame them, grow them, keep them healthy? Gorg! Xxx
You’re not the first one who itches after the shower gel. I’m missing out on these!
No customs? In that case I'll probably try the boy brow at some point since it's cheaper than benefit gimme brow. I haven't purchased a gimme brow in the new packaging yet because I don't like the new packaging and I'm annoyed that they increased the price.
I like that you kept it realistic! Xx
I've been looking forward to this video so much. However my first thought at the start was your hair looks great.
Love this- just done a glossier shop and this totally helped me make an informed decision. Bought stretch concealer, priming moisturiser rich and moon mask 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Thanks for the comprehensive review Anna!
you should always wear this tint ! it's so nice on your skin
Just waiting for my first order, looking forward to trying them. PS, I just listened to a podcast where Emily Weiss mentioned she uses her milky jelly cleanser on her err intimate area, you’re welcome lol xx
Do not buy the vitamin C serum by Glossier. Vitamin C in a clear bottle is a no-no. Also, the serum is already tinted yellow. Not a good sign. For the niacinamide + zinc, opt for the The Ordinary one for a much better price. Same for the hyaluronic acid serum. Even better than The Ordinary, I would suggest the Hadalabo Super Hyaluronic Acid Lotion.
All the makeup YouTubers paying to get on trending hahah
out of everything you showed in your video today ima buy the bobbi brown  brush...and the cleanser
Ah I'm about to place an order but I can't select shipping in the uk anymore. I almost placed one yesterday and it was fine then 😭
Amazing run through! Thx Anna! Feel super informed and ready to hit up the site x
Yes!!! I have been waiting for this aha xxxx
Hi Anna, you mentioned having psoriasis a couple times before and I wonder if you could you do a psoriasis video? Not very glamorous I know haha - mine pretty much disappears in the Spring and reappears in Autumn so I would love to know your tips before it comes back. Thank you!!
Getting my order tomorrow can't wait 😀
Dying to know how the new perfume smells!?
I love crush!!! It looks great on my skin tone!!! I think it’s a very universal shade!!!
I disagree with the skin tint! I have OILY skin and that product is a holy grail. Matifying products always break down weirdly on oily skin. I just embrace my shine and that product doesn't break me out at all
Loved this.  Almost placed an order but glad I waited.  Based on your information about using the products for awhile, I have changed my mind about some items.  This video has helped me out a lot!  Thanks for the very helpful info, Anna!!
Thank you so much for this Anna.  I am about to do my first order and this is so helpful. X
Its been a month and i was skeptical to order but now I'm going to buy. Its a big order but im very curious to not look so beat. Im a little over that look. And this company celebrates natural beauty. I do have acne scaring not so severe but as my skin heals i feel its best to embrace my flaws as they recover. Long story short im buying.
Such an insightful video, can't wait to order! xxx
Obvs I placed an order on Monday (hurry up and arrive please!) but now watching this makes me want to go for order number two!
Can't wait for my order, watching you and Lily rave about this has made me so excited for UK shipping. Not sure my credit card will thank me though! Thanks for such a great review!!
Hiya, I sent you an email about helping me with my a level EPQ, would really appreciate if you reply as soon as possible xx
my first order is on the way over from the US right now. yay to shipito. I'm kind of excited - I hope I picked the right shades. I was like you know what you look like a mozzarella just get the lightest one of everything 😂
Very helpful! I'm hinting to family in the UK to send some to me in SA. Totally unrelated but... what do you use on your hair? It's always so lovely and shiny and sleek.
Thanks Anna this was very helpful - I have ordered the milky cleanser and concealer, hooray!
I love Generation G! They give a tinted look but feel nicer than a lip tint. I also really love the Milky Jelly Cleanser, Haloscope (Quartz) and Cloud Paints (Puff and Dusk for day, Haze for night. I'm also really enjoying Wowder (I look moisturized but it tamps down the Glossier look of looking like I can fry an egg on my face haha). The rest I'm kind of meh with. Stretch Concealer was a fail because I feel like it didn't actually conceal anything and Priming Moisturizer Rich WAS THE THE WORST because the lavender oil broke me out. I was so disappointed when I saw the lavender oil in the ingredients list but I bought it anyway because I love the brand. Anyway it was good to my skin for about two weeks and I actually thought the lavender oil would be ok...and then it murdered my skin. SMH.
Thanks so much for this! As someone with oily acne prone skin most of the skincare is a miss for me and makes me break out terribly (ugh superbounce was awful for me) so I appreciate the disclaimer in the beginning. I would stay away from all the skin products if you have acne prone skin even the concealer and highlighter which has coconut and castor oil. Don't get sucked in!
Just about the order my basket then this popped in to my subscription box !!  Perfect timing thanks Anna !!

I'm loving the look of your hair on this video Anna! You look so pretty :)
Love you and your videos! For redness you should try dr. Jart’s cicarepair tiger grass in the pot! Its so good and has spf in it too 👍🏼 really think you’ll like it 🤗
What a lovely review! I just ordered th Boy Brow in Clear and the Stretch Concealer in Light!! Can't wait to try them!
I really want to try the concealer but I'm not sure it'll cover my mum eye bags!! Xx
I haven't tried these products yet, but I've watched about a dozen videos reviewing them. They seem like they are targeted for women with really good skin, who don't want to wear much make up but just want a little boost. To be honest,my impression is that they are a lot of hype and not a lot of benefit for the money
Thanks for this! Anna, do you find the Moonstone Haloscope glittery or still glossy and sheeny like the others? I have milk pale skin so think that's the one for me, but I've read that it's chunkier than the other two...but I trust your judgment most on it!
anna! i'm a religious viewer/reader but i never comment - i just wanted to say thanks for being dedicated and awesome. I wanted to suggest/ask you to compare the glossier super pure to the ordinary niacinamide serum and super bounce to the ordinary hyaluronic acid. Also, have you ever tried topaz as an eyeshadow situation?? i love quartz but i'm considering topaz for that purpose
Totally couldn't tell you had no makeup on at the start of the video! Your skin is amazing, I hope that's down to the glossier as I just placed a big order 😊❤️
Great review! Wish Glossier would ship to Australia...
I still think that about serum you should try The Ordinary. They are much better prices and really good! Did you try them Anna?
Great video Anna very informative and has saved me spending a lot of money when I don’t need to...thank you
Im obssesed with the generation g lipstick in crush, I use it everyday!!
I really like the skin tint, and I have oily skin. I do use a powder on top. I'm pretty lucky, so my skin is clear and I don't have much discoloration. If you need serious color correction, this may not be so useful. It's a very nice texture as well.
Love that you’re a total fan girl of Glossier but you still gave a very balanced review. That’s why you’re one of my faves💕
Hi! I just wanted to let you all know that you can get 20% off and free shipping of your first Glossier purchase by shopping via a rep link. I have mine linked in my blog posts about Glossier (on ninamidlik(dot)com) or if you go to glossier(dot)com/reps/Nina - I'm just sharing so you all can get the discount. And once you place an order they'll give you a link to share and you can get credits to your account! (Disclaimer: reps get a small amount of commission on sales (not the in store credit) Just so you all know!)
Loved your review and the makeup look, looks amazing on you!
Such an amazingly helpful (& honest as ever) video! Thank you x
You should try the cloud paint as eyeshadow. Dusk makes a great blown-out soft eye shade. I use it on my eyes and cheeks all the time. Makes an easy tonal look.
love your vidsss!!! a huge fan of yours from indonesia <3
I have the Generation G in the color Jam, and I find that it looks absolutely amazing on my lips, but also lightly patted into my cheeks! For any Generation G owners who have yet to try Cloud Paint (be it budget, etc...) definitely give it a go first with some Gen G on the cheeks! That being said, I am really excited to get my first Cloud Paint (Puff), and I am trying Generation G in Crush as well! Just can't get enough..!
Incredibly helpful. I think you’ve just saved me $100. It’s overwhelming trying to figure out what is good, and what’s terrible. Thank you for saving your audience a lot of money.
Just back from New York (still strugling with my jetlag), but I think it's a hype. Only bought the cleansing gel (is ok) and the brow gel. Otherwise, nothing special. It's all about the woman who really doesn't need make up.....(according to the Hirons lady),....so why use it than? Marketing: genius, quality wise: nothing special. So thanks, but no.thanks! 😂😎 And for the stickers...sorry, I'm nót a teenager that loves little kitty!
Yes, Glossier is really hyped, but I have a few issues with some of their products. I have no sensitive skin a lot, but skin tint, priming moisturizer and sometimes even the concealer make my eyes burning like crazy! I love the milk jelly cleanser, the balm - I should have picked the coconut one instead of the birthday one because I wake up in the morning with glitter everywhere on my face :P - and also the lipstick in Leo.
giiiirl, please do a body care video! I have terribly dry skin and love any recs to make my life better <3
Need to try Boy Brow!! Loved this video! Xoxo, Caylie
*the mole on your cheek looks like it has its own gravity and is pulling the side of your lips towards it*\n\n\n\n*jk :D, love ya!*
Anna, thanks for a really thorough review! One thing I really love about Glossier that I feel doesn't get touched on quite enough, is their line is 100% cruelty free and they don't do any animal testing. Just thought I'd share! Thanks again!
this is a blessing

I noticed the bird tattoo and the one on the towel @ 00:35. Then i realized that it was a cupcake jemma towel. Plz tell us more
No way you did that blueberry squishing in that gorgeous top and didn't get it covered in blueberry splatter...

Do these not cristallize? Every time I try freezing yogurt, it always creates small ice crystals that make it horrible to eat. How do I avoid that?
I'm the first one to watch his
How about a pumpkin spice cupcake recipe? #Halloween.. #WinterIsComing

OHHH
我不喜欢川菜，不好吃 ，太辣了.lol。真搞不懂你是怎么想的Lol
你们小笼包是直接蘸辣酱吃的吗2333333
是的，我们中国好吃的可多了.
开早餐店真的是一件非常非常辛苦的事。
The food looks amazing but the interactions are just so... Awkward.
Do they even have Mongolian bbq in China?
This guy is a real boom!! I'm from Zigong, the chicken feet place he went to was one of the most authentic places in my hometown, he must be really serious about his work to even dig that place out!! Cheers dude!!👊
I can't keep watching this. I'm salivating so much.
I can only wonder what my farts would smell like eating like that all the time.
14:11 That's what she said
The thumbnail looked like a chinese food pizza.
you're getting fat trevor. i can see your nips. get some exercise
Wow, as a spicy food lover this looks like Paradise!!! Must do a trip someday :)
I've just watch Shoukugeki no Shouma season 3 and in that episode Shouma learned about spicy Sichuan food and now I found this video! Very interesting!
Haven't watched food ranger's videos for a long time(about a month). So I cooked some scallops and had a glass of wine while I was watching this video. And....\nHey, food ranger, you've got the Sichuaness accent! Do you?
Hahaha I'm Sichuanese. I have to say his Sichuan dialect accent is very funny
I don't know how you manage to sound like a New Yorker in Chinese, but you did it.
Absolutely loved baozi, jaozi, and stir-fry lotus root when I went to China (south of Shanghai not Sichuan). Really miss the authentic flavors of certain places which had brought tastes from across china. A Sichuan jaozi place in hefei was amazing, I love spicy foods. Was lucky enough to bring some Sichuan peppercorns back, unlike any other spice.
Tell me Yibin is your next destination. so awesome!
I am literally dying as an International student from Sichuan in the US. because of your video. I just wanna book a flight and go back home immediately!!!!!!!! It is so painful that I am eating cereal while watching your video.
The guy at 0:35 was so lost he didn't know wtf was going on lmao
Was wondering where to find that kind of food here in singapore.
Why don't he travel to South America or central America only Asia .. or is he eventually going to make it to the americas
15:03-15:07 \nLol I think we know how spicy it is, it went from daylight to almost dark out and you're still not done!
This is killing me! Homesick to the extreme!
Trevor, you need to travel to Iran sometime and try our cuisine, it is out of this world, I'm telling you, and they'll treat you with Such respect and hospitality, you just can't imagine 😊😊😊😊
thats how you react to food, a loud mmmmm, and a thumbs up.. not leaning to the side and doing crazy eyes like that retarded traveler guy
Way too much food for me, is there a way to politely ask for a small portion solo travellers can use? I'd feel very guilty at leaving so much
The intro sounds like h3h3
Well, those food are full of MSG. It tastes good but you should not eat too much.
Makes me want to rob the restaurant and throw eggs at the waiters
I like your videos a lot, and we Chinese are very friendly to foreigners, welcome u come to Wuhan,another famous China city, which is full of delicious specialties, you’ve amazed,lol
when you speak chinese you finish the words mostly with (( MA )) what's that means please ?
This guy's restroom must smell like a land-fill once he goes in to unload..
I love food thanks for this video..
little shocked when you spitthat chinese like a local.
Hey ! Please visit India again. You will find lot of spicy items in India and lot of Indians ready to invite you as well.. who will invite if he visit India?
Oh, thanks, I'm hungry now.
Damn, I need to go with you on one of your food travel experiences, great times.
Why add msg? I don't get that
I really love this series. I am thinking about changing all my plans and do a solo Sichuan tour if I can't find anyone to join me. Looks great and a lot of fun.
I watch his videos since 500k subs
Love your vids guys.  Congrats on 1 MILLION!  And can't wait to see the future for the channel!
点几盘小炒弄碗米饭！拳打肯德基，脚踢麦当劳！
我天啊 馋死我了 我也想吃啊啊啊啊啊
Just amazing to watch you enjoy the food and the people you meet.
This video is trending in the uk
Amazing once again Trevor
Is this shokugeki no soma 3rd season? lmao
Everything is so cheap OMG
I like ur videos.
It's midnight, I'm starving, traver don't miss 富顺豆花 and by the way , I went to chun xi road and bought that 锅盔， but I don't think it's delicious.
😀🙌
very exciting, thanks for sharing!
哈哈哈
lol oh sugar..no its msg
1m ... tumbs up
Please do a South America series. We have a lot of delicious food here.
DUDE COME TO PHILIPPINES AND ILL BE YOUR TOUR GUIDE TO DELICIOUS FOODS OUT HERE.
The timing of this video perfectly aligns with Shojeki no Soma new season. They are doing a whole Sichuan chinese competition.
Come of it when he eats the chicken foot and is like.... Uuuuummmmm
Wonderful video! How do you not get headaches from the MSG?
I wonder if he wastes all the food or if he shares it with the villagers or something.
You must carry pepto with you for all those dishes with chilies
you change my minde about the Chinese food.. i want to try it it seems so delicious
Trevor: Whats your specialty?\n\nLady: MY SPECIALTY IS THAT I CAN FRY ANYTHING *#CoolCookThugLife*
！oh my god！！it is my hometown😄😄😄  ZiGong.\n love you  and your channel!😍
How do you not gain weight eating all that food?
What's wrong with you people?!\nShe's full of age, he wants sex, so what? She could have left anytime.\nJust because he's ugly yet rich doesn't make it a crime.
A jew protected for decades by Jewry in Hollywood \nNothing to see here
That man looks too dirty for taking shower so often....
Jews have a perverse and degenerative effect on American society
Waiting for a guy to denounce him for sexual harassment too. That would be funny.

Sesame Street is retiring the character Grover and  has created a new puppet character based on Harvey Weinstein. It's called Groper
Not only actresses in Hollywood who experience sexual harassment, but ordinary young women around the world. Molestation of girls, Here's how you fight it. # speakout #speakup #saynotomolestation PEOPLE LIKE HIM SHOULD BE HANGED. \nLink👉👉👉👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI5UfM6DJWI&t=4s
Everyone shoud read this blog about Hollywood's hypocrisy with President Trump: http://www.trumpscorecard.com/gone-too-far-1.html
Put a bullet in this kike prick's head.
That's not good, of course. But come on! All these celebs would be nobody without his help. And if some of them said No to hime, they said Yes to other perverts.
I hope we can all come together as a country and kill all the people like this including trump :) Happy Murder everyone
What about the allegations of sexual harassment, seems to me not denying it means it’s TRUE
Brave girl. All those pigs should be exposed and put in prison.
They would if they could but they can't, its a c*nt.
He looks like a cancerous elbow.
Dad always told me never go into a room with a jew
He probably didn’t even need the five minutes.
If your president does it what do you expect!
A fat lecherous jew...who would ever believe it?
I was Weinstein's Doorman and Savages's Call screener Jimmy is refusing to put my call through to tell Savage he's wrong in attempting to paint a sympathetic picture of Weinstein now.  How pathetic. Even the Jews 1st in Savage is showing through.
*When  you're a star they let you do ANYTHING*. \nWhen you're the president, you can get away with it too.
This filthy jew has been raping our Aryan sisters. We must gas the kikes now.
Now he just needs some tictaks and he's qualified to be President.
Man, he's got game.
Weird that it was recorded....... he didn't force her so....... you telling me if you had a model in your hotel room that you wouldn't try to seduce her? wth was she even doing there? You say pig I say trying his luck, yh he sunk low but who hasn't?
So that's why Mira Sorvino's career tanked - she refused to play with Weinstein's weiner
Our cultures popular entertainment is trash, ran by trash, who wants you to be trash.
Horrible human. People that can do things like this should get the electric chair
DISGUSTING
Jabba the Hutt
He is sick
Trump would a grabbed her pussy
This ugly ass mofo was looking for strange somewhere else while he should have been taking care of his wife who is banging.
1:15 I know he has crushed other people before yeah with all his fat rolls and lard crushing the girl below him.
Harvey grabbed them by the pussy, and Hollywood liked it. Streep, Crowe, Damon. Depraved.
His face goes to show that looks don't count for much. All you need is money to be a pig.
wheres the proof, one recording refusing advances doesn't mean rape. Plus the same chick went after burlesconi, Italian president accusing him of same thing, seems like a money grub
But his wife is really beautiful though.
Think of all the disgusting sex predators in Hollywood. Namely. Ones that the Clinton's involve themselves with. What do they all have in common? They're all kikes.
How odd that the society which bombards men with sexual images all the time is the same society  that criticizes a man's behavior that acted upon it.
She is not Italian by any means.  She is Asian, maybe raised in Italy.  The guy is sickening.  Wonder how he lasted so long?!  Big fat and ugly.
Imagine if the Italian bird had a grandfather who was, ya know, connected...
watch me take a dump :)
Everyone knows to get a part in Hollywood what you need to do.
You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful—I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\n\nGrab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.
This guy couldn't sound any more like a New York Jew if he tried. You know that nasally measly mouse voice common to New York Jews, much like Chuck Schumer. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with that, just pointing out the obvious.\n\nIt's funny if I had nothing else to go on other than his voice I'd know that he was a New York Jew. It must be something in the water.
Why use allegedly in the title?? Allegedly makes is sound like there's a debate or a question as to the factuality of there being a recording. There's no debate. He was recorded saying those disgusting things.
a real man, is a predator(a rapist?).... what do us marines, think about that?  man proposes & woman disposes.... harvey, we support  U....
Wankstein got the horn more than a raging bull. Dirty old man
watching this is making me want to shower
I will destroy all my dvd movies, I dont want dirty pigs in my shelves anymore
This is a UNESCO plot to destroy a clean living Jewish Boy,thats why the USA is right to PULL OUT of UNESCO for being bias towards Israel and Harvey.
this dude's balls were never empty
The police r worse cos they chose a woman whose known as a partygirl than an actress. I can see him going free.
There's no smoke without fire too many allegations for it to be untrue dirty entitled arrogant pig
Props to this girl! I hope she succeeds!
I noticed he said he was used to that when she mention touching her breast. Probably because, unlike this girl, so manydo anything for the fame and $$$
the worst part is he did it with a strap on
He is gross and inappropriate, why did this girl go alone into a room with a strange man? Why is there a need to be alone with any strange man? I'm 50,iv been alone in a room with my wife and daughters.... Thats it.
I think the way this is being handled is anti-semitic.
Nobody wants to watch your nasty fat ass take a shower 🤢
It's more interesting who recorded the tape and released it. Maybe it's punishment for what he is going to do or not do.
She was hot though
O.K its bad... but what didn't or did he do for Hollywood and politicians to throw him under the bus... its got to be bigger than this.... ain't it always!    Anyone?!
What a creep, give that animal the chair
He only did what most guys wanna do but can't , because their losers , they know how Hollywood works
How could you trust that face?
not really surprised, news like this is common place
This guy has ZERO game.  Why would a woman get turned on seeing an ugly blob of fat taking a shower??? lol
A predator and his whores. They all deserve each other.
White privilege gets mega passes while Bill Cosby is being crucified over allegations 30 years ago. We will never get fair justice in this wicked and unjust system. That's why it's being broken as we speak.
The fact that he's so ugly and fat makes it even more offensive.
Hey! I'd hit it.
He's so hot , how could any woman resist him..Dont think so. GROSS!!lol.
His day is coming , all things done in the dark will be in the light. JESUS CHRIST
Harvey Weinstein... That boy don’t act right.
These women were selfish in their silence! He had access to children too. Office harassment is one thing but if I had the knowledge that he may have the same access to children and there was a possibility of them being victimized...... 😡😠😡😠😡\nTheir silence was selfish. How can they act as if they didn't know?!!!
Of course he's done thing wrong...but...one thing with this...if she's said she's not interested and then gone back to him to his room (all wired up) wouldn't that signal to him that's she's interested and just playing hard to get? Maybe I'm missing something
he's the definition of a Slimy Jew ... yuk !
Crazy.
Burn in hell Harvey!
Please, please, just touch my small Jewish weiner. Stein.
😱😭😭
Trump counts as Hollywood 😏
Harvey the Walrus, Coo Coo Ca Choo.
That guy is awesome.
Dirty fat pig
What a scumbag.
Grotesque sexual predator.
Barf
What a hurricane
It's showbiz...
Get John Podesta next!
Dirty Jew
Pig.... Disgusting.
Nuke Hollywood. Get rid of all the filth.
White people...
Here we go again why is this creep still free ???      You dont see the cops hauling his ass to be questioned wtf??     No handcuffs wtf ???  No charges wt????     Unfortunately no one is saying he is a pedophile  YET!!!!!      Another rich ass going to convicted PEDOPHILE Jeffery Epstein's Lolita Island ........sicko
*watches with a notepad*
Hi Sam,Indie and Jason. I've been a viewer of yours since day one and so proud of you! You are amazing and one hell of a badass mum. I appreciate all your honestly and realness.\nIt's very refreshing! \nSo question for you. \nI just moved house as well and have a 4 year old daughter. Im using your decor as inspiration for my new place. Just wondering what wall colour did you use for your office and livingroom. Lots of love from Canada.
Oh my it's absolutely perfect !!
Love the format! And the chilled vibe. Much love!
Such a cuddle couch, I love!
Love the vibe of your place and the video- very chill and cool~ any chance you'll restock your candle in the near future?
I love your home 😍
I love your eclectic style! So sophisticated yet at the same time homey and inviting!
Love the style of both rooms; warm and cosy 😍... u should become an interior designer 😉
I love how well thought out this video was, super different and creative. Always enjoy your videos <3
Your style is so nice! I have a very similar style too
Ugh! Please come and sort out my flat!
I loved the video and the format is just fine.  It felt very personal.  I love your style and I too would love a botanical vibe BUT my cats destroy every plant!!!! : ) xo\n\nNatoya
I love interior design too! The rooms look so calm and clean!!!
omg so inspiring! Love you and your family so much <3 Could you do a video about how to style small spaces? I have a one bedroom apartment and have no room for an actual office but still want to have an office space. Help! <3
Both spaces were to die for! Love your style Sammi, and the way that the video was filmed was great too!💙💜💛
What a refreshing house tour style video! Love the format, can't wait to see more! 😍
Initially when I saw the sofa when it was first delivered (I think in one of the vlogs?), I liked it but thought it didn't go with anything and stood out too much... but now I see it in the fully realised room, it just looks like its been there forever! It goes amazing with all the greens and yellows in the room! Such a stunning living room!
Loved it! I’m decorating my apartment and this helped me so much. x
Please get your fringe back I miss it Xxx
Loved the video and really loved the format!!
I really loved this video 👌🏻
Such a beautifully made lil film! The music is so blissful and I love how you’ve decorated 😍
Especially loving the living room! So unique, cosy and light!
Have you ever considered having just above shoulder length hair? I think it would look gorgeous on you, not that you dont look gorgeous already though 💗. It accentuates a womens collar bone and neck which I think is very feminine and sexy. Just a thought though 💗. Hope you have many years of lovely memories in your home with your loving family x.
Never miss a single video 😍 for 4 years now! 😳😍 wow, time flies by... greetings from Germany ❤️
i really loved this video! unlike some other homes where they're aesthetically pleasing but too clean, your spaces feel lived in and unique to you.\n\ni also liked that you didn't tell us where every single thing was from because sometimes that can get overwhelming, in my opinion.\n\noverall, this video was really comfortable to watch, it was like i was sitting down with a friend to talk about home decor :) i hope you continue this format & i'm looking forward to seeing more of your home! 😊\n\n(p.s: been loving all the earrings you've been wearing lately, they look so good on you! 😍)
loved this video Sammie, your style is awesome.
İ love you home Sammy your aesthetic is so good did you search about feng shui?🙈

Uh everything about this video is perfect!!!
The ultrasound pictures of Indie were so cute. It was really beautiful and real.
Sammy can you please give me a shout out...I am shaving my hair off for McMillian Cancer and I am trying to raise £500. I would really appreciate it if you would help me out with this one. https://bravetheshave.macmillan.org.uk/shavers/nicole-macdonald \nI love your videos been watching since day 1 xxx

Your home is amazing! I love how you have incorporated so many plants inside your home. Just lovely and such a pleasure to watch this video. So peaceful somehow.

You are just amazing
You seem so much happier and content in this house! :) I can tell by the decor! Your living room in this house has a completely different atmosphere than the old one.
I would love to see more of these videos. Thought it was great sam! I'm obsessed with homeware so homeware hauls would be cool too
In love with your living room! Currently decorating mine after a move and this is so inspiration! 💙

WHAT ARE THOSE JEANS
Wonderful <3 Thank you
Indie is the absolute cutest😍
Trump is all about the freestyle. No script, no prep, no connection to reality..
I love when I hear my home country name on social networks. Respect Trinidad and Tobago
#FUCKTRUMP
TWO WORDS FOR MR. SESSIONS. “STATES’ RIGHTS’. now jeffie boy, fuck off
Trump is a fucking moron who doesn't understand that this is America and we will fight back. 🖕you trump!
Only loser's like trump.
Damn right, go fuck yourself u orange pile of narcissistic, orangutan looking trumpsterfire
It's disgusting that the president can write whatever he wants on Twitter.  He needs to revoke his own presidency.
Truck Fump
That clap back was the most coherent I've ever seen that worthless asshole trump.
Liberal fruitcakes
When Trump and Big Shaq aka The ting go mix
that 10 sec of trump was better then all that eminem trash.  i enjoy eminem but his freestyle was terrible, my thoughts.
America did not qualify to the World Cup ahahaha. America has been losing its standards since Trump came into office. They stop winning in the world stage.
Do a show with eminem jimmy
Ive always love to watch Jimmy. It's been my nightly ritual the last six years.The skits are hilarious and the music and games. Fed up and just done with it all now!! So sick of the politics and the way over doing about Trump. It has been a eye opener. Sadly I've learned about this whole industry and their selective bashing and go for the throat mentality. Then their outright obvious bias based Hollywood Expectations  it's repulsive. So karma forbid Jimmy you don't ever land a roll in the  Hollywood Stumble ! Only because zero is what you'll end up with.
Trump is a piece of shit.
nose ingredient look impression fat what producer evil move defensive
Where was Hollywood here...?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gU_icR9txU
Middle America, now it's a tragedy\nNow it's so sad to seeremember this lyrics
Liberal celebrities hate him, Democrats condemn him, America's enemies despise him.. watch how he does it with one neat trick! \n\nTWITTER
Is the four years over yet? Or can we impeach him already?
Jimmy Fallon will be sitting front row when Trump is sworn in for his 2nd term in 2020. \nYou like apples Jimmy? How ya them apples sonny boy?
We should all just write rhymes on Trump.. Make it the new thing.
Fallon - Is it true you have people watching you 24 hrs a day so you don't  get arrested?\n“I’ll Put Anthrax on a Tampax and slap you till you can’t stand.” ENEMA M...an artist? LMAO!!\nHow IGNORANT does one have to be to  listen to CNN? and  be a fan of Enema M ?\n BOYCOTT the NFL !!!
I wonder if he's going to call Eminem overrated? Lmao *rolling* *eyes*
i hate trump as well but damn is jimmy fallon such a bad host lol he is all flip floppy and cringy like he will act all buddy buddy with u and then hate on you just because it is the cool thing to do
Losing to Trinidad? I guess they got tired of winning!
Jimmy is a clown for real fucking sell out
Sooooooo, these comments can make a little girl cry, that's for sure.\nQuestion: Who should replace Trump? I will admit, I did vote for Trump in the past because I believed him to be the lesser of two evils. I knew we weren't getting the most perfect person in the world. I am getting annoyed with hearing about Trump's latest tweets, and from all these pretty comments I have seen, he must be a messed up guy. So for all of you who absolutely, positively, undeniably hate Trump: Who would you replace him with?
I've seen 12 year olds make a better Trump rap.
Why doesn't Eminem ask for show me the carfax ... oops I meant the CAFR which shall prove that Detroit, MI went bankrupt under felonious contention and was a complete lie to rip everyone off - based on Budgets per se!! Like all CAFRs' across this nation! Cheap cop out by the rapper instead of going after crooks in Detroit with Chicago next to go Bankrupt like Stockton, Calif already has done so - under false pretense! Proof is @ your local State, city, county websites - just dig deep! via  http://cafr1.com/
trump hates m&Ms, there's no white ones
NBC executives have ordered all NBC programming including NBC news not to mention the Weinstein scandal.
The US women's team did!!!
This was actually funny!!! All of it!!! 😂
Why isn't Jimmy saying anything about Harvey Weinstein?
getting pretty desperate when (((they))) are dragging out eminem...
You are a disgrace Jimmy. well done
Jimmy Fallon this is evangelist Michael Steven Burnett nobody speaks for me unless you come to my house and talk to me face-to-face or call my mom's phone to talk to me I have no idea the things going the way you get to my house is fine Rio Rancho New Mexico Walmart there's a Chili's across the street your West on Southern Boulevard up the hill make a right on Rainbow go three streets down make a right on Inca then go down to the end of that dirt road it's 2nd Street make a left you can only go left and on the left hand side up the street is house number 39 theres punk Pelicans about a foot tall in the front that's where I live do not believe all the lies I do not have anyone that represents me at all nor my communication with anyone I do not have a phone because of hackers I'm using my mom's phone right now

Fun stuff!
TRUMP 2020
Not today Brian
OHhhhh burnnnn especially that Doing Doink tho
Hallooooooooo\n😂😂😂😂😂
Paid Government Nazi !!!!!!!!!
Trump is just like every other Singaporean male or female I have ever met. Evil, self-righteous, pathologically lying, clueless, vain, arrogant...and they also have some bad qualities.
The Libtard is strong on this channel.
We should call  （White House ) is Tweeting House
whatever news that is true about him, he calls it fake new because he doesn't want to admit that they're true
Yes FUCK TRUMP
Pickle Riiiiiiiick!!!
Trump seems like an awful person but im so tired of hearing about him all the time. Opened up YouTube and all i could see was Trump Trump Trump on the main page.
It would of been funny it you showed trump rapping
I just don’t know what to say.
Jimmy that wasn't the BET Awards, it was the Hip Hop Awards. 😂😂😂😂😂
He just seems to hard to be trying to catch up to Colbert now.. cuz NOW he does Trump all the time.. and thing is he has the best impression and could have stayed on top
You forgot to mention that the WOMENS team are playing in the world cup and have won it FOUR times while the men have ZERO wins.
Hey guys we almost have a 50 subscribers! Help us get it 🙌
Yooo go Trinidad that's my home!!!!!!
Halooo my little broders

Maga. Bukkake king fallon
Jimmy Fallon 'bout 2 have his liceanse revokD 😂👌
I got a generation brainwashed to pop pills and smoke weed til they brains rot   -Eminem.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qKL2sKZSQ0g
Interesting comment I read:\n\nAnd now we learn Cyrus Vance, Manhattan DA, declined to criminally prosecute Weinstein even when presented with the NYPD Sex Crimes Unit recorded evidence of sexual assault and witness testimony. Add this to Cyrus Vance taking payola from a Trump Org lawyer the not criminally prosecute Ivanka and Donald Jr for criminal fraud and we have a criminal justice in NYC that is bought and owned by those with privilege. The US Attorney should investigate Cyrus Vance for bribery and malfeasance and all of these cases he personally refused to prosecute.
Donald trump came to my hood busting shot at the ops
Kkkkk
Any more jokes on weinstein?
Wreck that hairstyle.
Trump's a dick
Eminem ,Harvey Weinstein & Trump  can all fuck off.
Well what do you know, another multi millionaire artist trying to speak on behalf of every common folk in America. \n\n Hollywood and Leftists will never learn that this SJW outcry horseshit is the reason Trump won in the 1st place.\nAll this is going to do is make more people tired of being told how they should think and act which will ultimately have Trump stay for another term, and boy is it going to feel fucking sweet seeing you morons cry and try to make change with a lame hashtag since all you do is cry behind your phones not taking it upon yourselves to make change.
I don't know yet but i bet Trump tweeted about Eminem. He's too predicable
The fact that the title has claps back earns an instant dislike.
You liberals are filled with so much hate right now. Hypocrisy.
I wish everyone would stop talking about this clown we are just giving him more power and stroking this idiots ego.
Jimmy you're such a hypocrite.
The salty left are at it again.\nWe laugh.\nThey think we cry.\nFucking brilliant.\nTrump 2020 bitches. 😗
Trump>Eminem
It's a shame that the press has a pass to lie
Hey jimmy why don’t you stop talking about trump every fucking monologue. Can’t you find something else to talk about.
Misleading title, thumbs down.
Fuck Eminem and fuck trump
Trump go die pumpkin face
Y'all better leave DT alone. Lbvs.He'll be president again in 2020.
The Idiot  Trump gets smacked again.
Go Eminem!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So basically... the US has become a reality show, and the whole world is the audience.
Why are you all fuckin sheep :-D he means that the press bills hit and over exaggerate the truth. \nFalling you're a fake piece of shit.
The monologue was exactly same as seth or as Colbert
Go Trump!!! Keep them making idiots of themselves!!
thank you em for support muslim

#FindJeremysDairyFreeGirlfriend2k17
in Chile we call that brazo de reina, which means queen's arm
The best things about dairy-free and/or vegan recipes is that those can be enjoyed by everyone in the family together!
Any chance of you guys making Wagamamas Firecracker Chicken one day?
Did anyone notice the head-wiggle Ben always does while or after saying sorted?
Yep, I'm gonna hold off for another five seconds cause I always end a little... too... early. Oh, look look look, nearly nearly nearly. Nuts are going in!
Thank you for the dairy free recipe
Where on earth do you find hazelnut milk!!!?!?!!
my name is Jeremy But no girlfriend hard r i p.
You're knocking off my nuts ;)
You come for the recipes - you stay for the puns
Hmm...reading a comment I had an idea.  These things rarely escape so I hope this is a good one.  Here goes...How about an education week?  Teaching a class or feeding the 5000 in a dinner school or students restaurant.  Best foods for learning etc.  I'm sure that students will love it.  Well, how did I do?  Oh...OK.   Sorry, I think I'll just go off and disappear.
“And then you wanna grab yourself (long pause) a tray lined with paper.” 😂
JEREMY YOU IDIOT i died
Stoked to see your flavour choice!  Hazelnut and coffee is one of my absolute favourite combos. Thanks for the shout out :)
Love how he explains the reason for each ingredient/action!
Any suggestions if you can't have eggs or dairy? 😥😥😥 I've the worst allergies :(
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
I’m Jeremy’s girlfriend literally
I'm sorry but you know Mary Berry would say that the roll is not tight enough!!
Huh that's how I roll my joints 🤔
Mike, you can totally be Jeremy’s girlfriend if you want to. You can be anything you want if you believe hard enough.
Keep up the dairy free desserts/ food! 👌
What? didn't understand girlfriend explanation >.<
I love the intro it's so funny
Is it possible to substitute hazelnut with macadamia?
Please temper your hazelnut coffee mixture or you will scramble the yolk
No No NO NO NO NO
What if you can't find hazelnut milk? Will other nut mills work??
u're knocking off my nuts\n\nthat sounded damn wrong man XD
You're knocking off my nuts\n\nMike, 2017
Dairy free recipe but you used eggs......
Mike just wanted to put his nuts all over that roll but Ben kept getting in the way
But I’m a girl and I can’t eat dairy
Wait it says coffee st the start and hazelnut in the title
“let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll”
Love the video, but I'm allergic to hazelnuts :(
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
i must try this, thank you.
Hey Mike, you are acting a little strange lately, are you alright?\nBlink twice on the next video if you need help!
Ben almost said Dairy Free Girlfriend at the end don't even try and hide it lad
You can make this vegan by replacing the egg yolks in the cream with silken tofu and the eggs in the cake with aqua faba for the volume and oil for the fat!
Mike''s looking better than eva... so YUMMAYY :)
Ben wins for the first minute with that nose pinch over the glasses...
You're knocking off my nuts \n-Micheal
Could I replace the coffee with something else? Dairy free but I can't stand the taste of coffee..
If he waited until cake was cooled off a little I don't think it would've stuck to the parchment. Can't always cover bad bits with powdered sugar
Oh my god, that looks soo good... I wanna have it!
oh my god Mike don't ignore it >:C
Looking for Jermi in the commnets ;)
That looks yummy even for people who can eat dairy.
I've already become obese watching this. Eating it will kill me for sure.
Swiss rolls are awesome and super tasty so it's awesome that you made a video with this recipe, but you can tell that it's def not perfect. Swiss rolls should be round and the spiral should stand out well otherwise the cake part might not have been made right which is totes fine for just eating with family, but you want to impress your mates right? ;)
Wow it is on trending!
aw man i *just* used the hazelnut milk i had sitting around to make a faux alfredo to get rid of it.
I only invited him because our mums are friends - I've never heard anything more relatable than this
How do you milk a hazelnut?
Thanks Jeremy, you gave us a great recipe because of your stupidity
sorted should do a 23andme test!!
If she's dairy free, tell her to suck it up. HOWEVER, if she's lactose-intolerant, then I'd make it this way.
Looking good, Mike! Lots of jaw line definition!
It has to be nice to have so few allergies in one's circle of acquaintances that dairy free poses a problem. I once made a birthday cake that was nut free, egg free, gluten free, chocolate free, berry free,  stone fruit free and that did not contain lactose, in order to accommodate all the allergies and intolerances within the party-goers. Wasn't the BEST thing I've ever baked, but 1000% worth the effort to see everyone's delight when told that No, there's no gluten/nuts/eggs/etc in there, so you can eat it.
Which is the better method for making marshmallows using egg whites or without egg whites?
I understand how weird this is going to sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway.\nWatching Ben roll that pastry was like, oddly sexual? Just me? 🤷
Looks a bit like it's filled with cold pork gravy... So my challenge for you is this: Make a savory pork swiss roll with gravy!
I'm proud of you lads for making it to Trending with just a midweek recipe
That title is misleading, I hate coffee!
Ahhh dairy free! Thank you!

Can you please do a sweet bake without eggs . Ive mentioned this before but you never seem to do it
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back.

I love this new video! It showcases Randy's talent so beautifully.
Superb skills. Funny. Three dimensional. Erudite. You are a force of light. An absolute treasure. Thank you Mr Rainbow.
I can't stop watching this! Seriously the best one yet from Randy 💕💕
this is the best thing i've seen in my life
My gosh you have such a gorgeous voice.  And this is hilarious.  One of your best, I think!
This is so great
Ok, but this is really good 😂😂😂
You are absolutely amazing if you ever go on tour come to Arizona I want to see you perform
Randy please do one with Trump sitting at a table when he was PR, with his balls hanging low, those pants was cracking his nuts!
It's always a fucked-up week in the drumph regiem
You hit it out of the park with this one.
@randyrainbow why can't I buy this song on iTunes 😩
FYI you come up before Randy Travis in search
Oh wait I know why because of red necks
Oi, leave marijuana out of this! lol
This is the funniest thing i have ever seen
Not an argument. All you did was insult how he looked and cried. Please try and make an argument next time.
you're the color of the sign outside the store that says Home Depot  (You're this color↘🏠) 🎃 \nI can NOT stop laughing! Great! Also that bye bye bye from nsync
Love Randy!\n\nWonder if The Horror knows he WASN'T throwing out beautiful, soft towels?
Pauses at 3:34 to pee\nI don't want that looking at me while I pee that's disgusting
Australia calling from Melbourne, we all love you Randy Rainbow. Love all your parodies on the Trump administration, you're a genius, they ALL stand out and right to the point with this president.Trump is a big JOKE!!!!!!!.
HI randy I just subscribe   You are funny you make my day !
I'm puertorican, and I have to say this made my day. Thank you so much for doing this, after everything thats been going on, I really needed something to make me smile.
Would like to start playing this in my sets, where can I get a copy?
oh randy you never stop making me laugh i love your vids keep up the great work and thanks for the laughs
Get that son of a bitch out of the White House!

Seems the only comedian lampooning President Trump and then copying James Corden..... edgy stuff.... and it's trending wow 😳
This is the best thing ever. The song was good. The lyrical puns were great. But the way you said 'good boy!!!' was the best! It really highlighted his low maturity and vocabulary level.
Randy you are so hysterical .... thank you for these videos They make us laugh and want to drown ourselves a little dress that day.
This is your best video performance yet. Did you purchase new sound equipment? Your voice and your message in the video sounds like it's coming from God himself. BRAVO!  Me and my over 10,000 group members are still waiting for you to do a performance here in Las Vegas. - Official Dump The Trump Campaign - https://www.facebook.com/groups/dumpthetrumpcampaign/
So you've had a bad week... for about a year now. GOLD

Thank you for ALWAYS finding the funny side of this farce
Holy shit this was fire
very good job randy. I will always remember your tweet about seeing the man punch the self check-out machine.
this made me feel better thanks
I think I love you
Hitting the thumbs up button before I even watch the video is automatic--it's Randy Rainbow! Brava, you talented, talented, TALENTED man!
Best one yet!!!!!!!! Love it.
You really are a very talented genius, please never stop what you're doing, I love you!
You're my favorites artist, musician, and comedian. I'd love to see you get your own tv show. Preferably on Netflix so I'll never miss a show.
Genius! Can't stop laughing and fearing that some desperate cheeto is going to send assassins after Randy...
This is PERFECT. (Gorgeous voice too, btw)!!!
You're a genius! I just love you so much! I don't know what else to say. Lol.
Tho Randy... What would we do with pence in office? Cause he's more homophobic and and wants to turn the US into a Christian country so what would we do then?
Best parody to date. It only gets better as we get worse under this prez
Such an appropriate song coming from Puerto Rico! Thank sooo much. I love Randy!
Everytime i hear that song i have to hum along-o,\ncause the lyrics fuck my brain so strong-o!
I truly love you, Randy Rainbow!!! 🌈 \nYou make all that’s happening in the US since Cheetoh‘s inauguration at least somewhat bearable! Greetings from Germany!!
Brilliant ! So funny, and i really like the tune !!
You have such a gorgeous voice. Hope you star on Broadway too, but in the meantime, every video is genius.
Randy is cute. Does he have a boyfriend?
Just love your parodies lol. You are so funny Randy don't stop making these
One of your best! I must have watched this a thousand times.
Love this new video and love you Randy. Please keep it coming , only way to stay sane lol :)
So true, you always express the real American feelings. This song is better than my #1 fav. song you're making things up again Donald  Good job! :D
I love you randy this made my day. Twitter here I come.
Randy is absolutely GREAT & hilarious.  Old trump is an unending source of stupidity.
Randy I always look forward to your videos  keep them coming and  don't let the Cheetos get you.
Randy never ceases to amaze me. His wit and creativity bring light to these dark days.
You've had a rough week, for about a year now
*And you’re in over your head so deep-o*\n\nThat one sentence sums up the entire Trump situation so very succinctly!\nThank you, Randy Rainbow. This video needs to be played in an endless loop right in the Oval Office.\n\nShould the Orange Cheeto-in-chief finally press the nuclear button, this will be the song that I will be listening to should much of the world face its untimely demise at the tiny hands of the Tweeter-twit.
Omg Randy!! This is so good.
Nice ! :D
I love this!
you keep me sane.

anyone who supports or voted for the orange deserves to be thrown in prison
He should be collecting royalties off Dr. Emmett Brown.
This is the kind of teacher I aspire to be.
Can Cliff Stoll be my professor?  Please?
the moment I saw the homework assignment, I immediately thought that I would measure it by attempting to cut a shape of known area, and weighing that piece. Then weighting the whole sheet and multiplying by the known mass per a unit of area (this is how we used to do it for figuring the area under a chromatography trace.)\n\nFor the sides, I was thinking I would cut the paper into several pieces and stack them, to get the thickness of the paper, but I am not sure how precisely the cut edge of the paper matches its thickness.
I would assume there would be some chance that the students results in many cases would not match based on which edges they measured.\nSo then, have them explain why . This would be interesting to observe.\n\nMight experiment on my kids ... now where do i get an imperfecto  ruler.  Must be one in my garage somewhere.
I really wish I had been a student in one of Cliff's classes. He has such great enthusiasm for everything and I love his take on maths and sciences! Every Numberphile video I watch featuring him makes me super happy and pumped! If he ever did an encore class, I'd do everything in my power to attend as I envy his former students!
I would love to have him as a teacher
The one thing I must know is who would dislike this video.
Is there a place where we can get like a PDF copy or something of the imperfecto ruler he uses, or is it a secret of cliff only
I'm almost certain that drive for knowledge is learned, not a natural gift. If you've got it, some event in your past showed you learning how to discover a fundamental truth is empowering in any future dealings with the subject of that truth.
He is weird, but amazing!
Can someone help me find a value of n that works other than 2:\nn^3-1= prime #
I love Cliff.  He's just so enthusiastic and it's contagious
I love this guy, he's so animated and engaged.
The Klein bottle guy. You are Awesome..
15-16 people in each class, hHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This is the opposite of click bait
Morty! Marty!! We have to go back to the future Marty to get back to the past to fix the present
Got to know things is a great way to live. Thanks Cliff
I adore this Professor.  His enthusiasm is infectious.  And his mind is deep and scary and wonderful.
Origin of the imperfecto- they were starting out and tried to make a ruler to sell. But there was a mistake at the factory and the 17 went twice. They decided to go with it and change the name of the ruler, making the company unique and like no other ruler company, making imperfect measuring devices.
I've got one word for this guy, FLUBBER
I mean, i like the content of the video... but seriously... i can't watch it due to the sickening BWP Actioncam... :/
This guy is different and I like him
He sounds like Ernie from Sesame Street
Where's his Morty?
I was surprised to see it’s not a rant by Matt Parker!
What about the holes.
Always examine the assumptions you're making. Advice that's useful to all scientists and engineers!
Best video i've seen today.
You, sir, are evil, and I salute you...
Just been reading up on how you caught that KGB hacker 30 years ago. Brilliant stuff. Well Done.
We love you cliff!\nI would never miss a class if cliff was my teacher. I wonder how many people i have shown the video of the story where cliff catches the spy!
He must know and he will know who said We must know.  We will know.
Spot on, mr. Stoll!! I just can't imagine a person not wanting to know - learning is like breathing. Biggest limitations are our natural stupidity (at least I talk for myself) and our limited lifespans...
Didn't expected this! Nice video!! Lovely man
omg i love cliff and this video now
How can one POSSIBLY not like this.
you made me smile. thank you.
Seems like the type of teacher to not like smart students
this guy sounds like tigger from whinny the pooh
I hope I'm even a tenth as tenacious, enthusiastic and fun as Cliff!
Because this is a Numberphile video, I thought of most of those things, but I doubt I would have thought much of it as a student.
what about the thickness of the paper? It's a cube basically.
So I would have used my own ruler and then cut the paper to make it equal on both sides then worked the area on the separate parts as well. Then wrote the answer for both sides with or without holes and either side with or without the holes. Sorted.
The problem with maths is that everyone picks them up at different speeds, so the fast ones start to make their own problems while the slow ones still trying to figure the first one out
Dude is just trying to over complicate a simple question. I hated teachers like this.
Interesting lesson about science. About the 'must know' thing...he would really hate phil. skeptics ;-)
I wanna see Joe Rogan interview this guy.
I got enthusiasm i don't know a lot of things.. I do as i could viewing videos.. Reading pdfs.. Still i don't know how to just understand without having to pay for university...
Also, this exercise reminds me of a test we were handed in school a couple of times. The test was 2-4 double sided papers filled with instructions. The first one was:\n\n1. Begin by just reading all of the questions in this test.\n\nWhat followed was then a loooong series of strange instructions each more odd than the next, until the last paragraph of the last page:\n\nNow that you have read all of the instructions, please turn this paper over and hold up your hand.\n\nVery few students actually follow the only two instructions of the test that actually mattered.
Can we create a world with lots of teachers as exceptional as this guy?
I feel that every single person in the world right now needs to pause whatever they are doing and watch this video before continuing on their lives
Is he the real Dr. Emmett Brown?
I would have cut out a 1 cm^2 piece of the paper and mass it.  Then I would mass all the paper.  Then, I would have set the ratio of mass to 1 cm^2 equal to the ratio of mass to unknown area of the paper.  I would then solve for the area of the paper.  This would give me 1 side.  Double it and I get the area of the two sides combined.  Even then, you've left out the small, but significant area of all the edges (including those inside the circles.  Like he said - you don't need the perfect answer, but you do have to KNOW exactly what it is you're measuring and how you're measuring it and what assumptions you make when you make those measurements as well as what assumptions you make when you do any calculations involving those measurements.  I love measurement.
I think everyone else agrees, just dedicate this channel to Cliff Stoll videos.
David Hilbert said We must know, we will know shortly before Kurt Gödel came up with his incompleteness proof. \n\nGödel threw the monkey wrench and we will never (for sure) know...
I love his passion!
I have to say, I like his enthusiasm for math and science.  Why can't more teachers be like that?
Does he have a Delorean in his garage?
Cliff is unexpectedly evil. I like it!
Also there is 9 mm between 17 and 17 on the ruler
I love his enthusiasm!
Why does the US have such daft paper sizes? The rest of the world have discovered ISO...
LOL I would never have even done the work. I'd have translated 8.5*11 to cm using the internet lol
I will use this test next time I'm interviewing a programmer for a job in my team!
Doc is that you?
Surveyors rule #1: There is no such thing as a perfect measurement.  Thumbs up Cliff!!
#42 on trending.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANSWER TO LIFE IS CLIFF STOLL!
One must love Cliff Stoll.\nOne will love Cliff Stoll.
Much better video than I was expecting.
I don't know now, but I GOTTA know!
I love this guys! the excitement <3
This is probability one of the best and thus, i watched it twice.
Do modulo inverse plssss :”((
Real life Doc. Brown
Mad genius
Cliff reminds me of doc brown
I feel cheated.
Inspiring guy
Doc Brown.
Nice
where's Morty?
why is this trending?
Ah the Klein bottle guy
I was here.
LOL! Excellent example of trolling IRL.
Cliff videos make anything seem amazing!
This guy literally trolled his students haha
iPhone, huh?\n\n\n\n\nLiterally unwatchable.
fu
Gödel says no.
BIGGEST PRANK IN CLASS
e
Hes rick
2:34 please don't
Ruler
Cliff Stoll is my absolute favorite teacher
I always groan when I see this guy's videos cos I find his personality tiring. But man this video is great!
I think Numberphile is out of ideas
Liberals still crying.
I think jimmy is avoiding this issue as he wants people to forget about “The Man Show”, which was a sexist as you can get. I loved that show, but I don’t go around calling people mysogynists and sexual predators while ignoring the ones I support or are friends with.
Hey Kimmel, you got anything to say about how you're best buddies had no problem covering up for a sexual predator, which was apparently a known thing in Hollywood?\n\nDidn't think so. Proceed with ignoring Leftist douchebaggary.
Hey Jimmy you hypocrite, how was that 18 year old you had feel you up on the Man Show in 2002?
Forgot Harvey Weinstein, what about you, you creep Jimmy!?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBDYGOzViuI\n\nHey girls, feel what's in my pants, use your mouth if you want.
jimmy, I hope your kid takes its last breathe.
Jimmy 👏🏽 back was amazing!!!!! DJTJ stay in your lane.... I’m starting to believe that the stupid gene is Contagious and I guarantee it maybe “ in my DJTS voice”
Look at Jimmy getting down with all the colored people at 1:35. Lol, modern slavery at its finest.
Harvey Weinstein for 2020..he has all the qualification for it like the orange baboon.
so ScrewYouTube allows AdSense on fight videos - ok, got it
Honestly, I had no idea who Harvey Weinstein was before this.
And cue more trump hate. Stop it and your ratings will go up
What’s in your pants Jimmy?  You hypocrite.
I lasted 15 seconds. Which is long for me 😉
I only feel bad for donald trump jr for his name, Donald Trump, literally this explains how much ego Trump (the president) has
That I can tell you and I guarantee it are both things I say all the time... Ugh...
The only thing funny about Kimball is his Trump obsession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ8i6EGH4FI\nSTOP BLAMING GUNS! Howard Stern DESTROYS the gun control Argument
Dotard Jr. is gonna learn to stay in a child's place after that. Lmao
What's in your pants, Jimmy?
Jimmy Kimmel, 'the conscience of America' has teenage girls grope his croutch for a seat see his show.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnGInJ5C-qI
I think next time Jimmy bashes Trump .. let Sean Hannity take the reins .. to respond. He would mop the floor with Kimmel.
Jimmy don't worry you're anniversary of that time where you had women with big breast jump up and down on a trampoline is coming up too.
Why don't Twitter BAN Trump's account? What would he do? It could be a lot of fun😜
jimmy kimmel the king of SJW's. the most beta male ever walked on planet earth.
All you can do is talk about trump and cry about trump every week talk about real issues like harvey weinstein
You expect logic from Idiot Jr
I wonder what Crowder and them will have to say about this lol.
Rest of hollywood are busy slamming Harvey Weinstein and Kimmo is busy attacking Trump.
Love you Jimmy
lmao xD
I honestly love you!
I just love how Jimmy Kimmel makes alot of fun out of his battles with Trump.
Kinda like Kimmel objectified women on the man show. Hypocrisy
Who knew Jimmy was that much of a troll savage 😂😂
donald trump is like a good sales man
Electric cars charging for 3 hrs???🙅 The future looks frustrating.
the elephant slayer feuding with jimmy kimmel did he really think he would win that .
I wonder why they never get into a twitter fight with Putin... And then roast him on a late night show?
Hah! Junior walked himself right into it twice in a row, what a shmuck. Jimmy knocked it out of the ballpark.
That I can tell You!
Hi I am Donald trump. I know I am about to start WWIII with Korea but never fear WE GOT TRUMP CARE
Will this sad excuse for a comedian ever stop talking about trump? Its old. Your pandering and rhetoric doesn't work. Unfortunately for Kimmel, people with brains do still exist. Not many. But enough.
Ah the forced laughter in the crowd
remember when talk shows use to be entertaining and creative I miss those days now it's just politics...
Lol all these left wing bias media. This is actually ridiculous.
Eventually Democrats would've given pedophiles safe spaces and bathrooms. They are sneaky pieces of trash. Can't let it happen won't let it happen! The only good democrat is a... Finish it with me
I’m from the UK and I agree with Trump on this one, all I get in my recommended is late night American hosts talking about trump and how orange he is or how insane he is. Then when Jimmy shows Trump being repetitive, all that that trump says is irrelevant because Trump isn’t bringing up any points in the clips so what if he repeats “I guarantee you”?
Jimmy, I wonder how all your liberal friends would feel if they saw all those clips from the man show  you hosted in the past ???
Kimmel is pretty disgusting. Living in his glass house, should not be throwing stones.\nIn the video below, speaking to a pretty young blonde, Kimmel announces, “I’ve stuffed something in my pants, and you’re welcome to feel around on the outside of the pants. You have then ten seconds to guess what it is in my pants.”\nAs the blonde starts to grope him, Kimmel instructs, “You should use two hands.”\nThe next shot is of a brunette groping Kimmel’s crotch, as he comments, “You’ve done this before, haven’t you.”\nFollowing that, another blonde is on her knees before him, groping him, as Kimmel tells her, “Maybe it would be easier if you put your mouth on it.”\nThe next shot is of Kimmel addressing yet another pretty blonde, asking her, “How old are you?” When she answers, “Eighteen,” he asks, “You sure of that? Cause old Jimmy doesn’t need to do time.”\nBack to woman number one, fully groping him, as Kimmel quips, “You’re going to make a fine wife.”\nBack to woman number two, as Kimmel asks her, “And your guess is?”\nShe replies, “A vibrator?”\nKimmel tells her, “A vibrator?” Then he pulls out an object from his pants, announcing, “No, it is actually a zucchini with a rubber band on it. But you could use it as a vibrator with a rubber band on it. Look,” as he vibrates it in his hand.\nWATCH VIDEO HERE\nhttps://celebz.news/11365/watch-moral-compass-kimmel-has-series
jimmy Kimmel u should do another whats in my pants skit that was so funny smh...
Nice subtle reference to Friends and the fact Joey doesn't know how to use air quotes when he punches Ross in the face. Sorry ;)
I wish you luck America.
Smh we're all taking an L for the very fact this is a thing...
I love jimmy so much
Jimmy kneels for the national anthem
that is the biggest damn spliff i've ever seen
snoop is the funniest person i have ever seen
Im fron England but Jimmy for president!!!!!!
Dude, Joey from friends would make a way better president than Trump :)
Hollywood is a cesspool. It is time to shut it down.
Jimmie Kimmel, the guy from the man show. That sexist show.
I love this guy! Never afraid to say what he stands for.
Anyone else see that video of Jimmy Kimmel sexually harassing women with his fame and influence?  Rub my crotch, I'm Jimmy Kimmel!  It's ok, I'm famous and stuff... another disgusting Hollywood hypocrite hack.
Ah Jimmy, the equivalent of cancer. Seems to like making fun of other people when he can't even control his own face, let alone his ego.
Hi! I am so gullible, i let so called celeb's do my thinking for me.\nI have no mind of my own. This is why i need show's like this, to guide me through my lack of reality.\nThe humour is really spot on, for my low IQ.
Hey, Jimmy. Didn't you once film a so-called gag by asking women to feel an object in the front side of your pants and ask them to figure out what it is?
Donald trump and his son are kidly and Jimmy Kimmel will have fun time. I am sure
At least Weinstein was busted, while Trump is President.  Go figure....
Some people like *mayonnaise.* Some people like *mustard.* Choose your *condiment.* If you're not laughing, you're not paying attention. *Stressed* spelled backwards is *desserts.*
Comparing what Trump said to what Weinstein did is a joke. Lets dig out some footage of your early \n2000's sitcom The Man Show which ran for 5 years where all you did was discuss women's breasts \nand bodies. I guess what you discussed for 5 years on your show makes you a rapist and sexual predator.\nSo be sure to tell your son when he grows up that you were a sexual predator before you became a crying sissy.
meanwhile the satanists molest and rape kids and kimmel is happy taking paychecks from them
I miss the late night shows being funny!
Hey Kimmel, how about you ask another 18 year old to guess what's in your pants!?\n\nDOWN WITH HOLLYWOOD MISOGYNISTIC GARBAGE
You go Jimmy!

Bring  back the girls jumping on trampolines!  Oh wait, that was from the time when you were a man.  LOL
Think its about time you two had a beer together & chill the f**k out 👍
Why do people keep talking about right wing and left wing like they are two polar opposite things ? They are both within the same political system and support the same ideology. Yes there are differences but I don't think you should ever declare yourself loyal to one or the other. I don't see how anyone could stand by every decision without question. I agree with some republican policies and agree with democratic policies. I don't agree with every decision my closest friends make for THEMSELVES never mind a party of hundreds of people who make decisions which affect me. I also think people need to separate their personal dislike on an individual and focus on what they agree or disagree on what a party of politicians are doing: any decision trump makes needs to go through Congress. If you disagree with how the votes were collected, or the fact the previous president ran out of his allotted time or even how decisions on policies are made you have an issue with the political system- not one man. I don't like trump, but instead of criticising him for things which are not his fault, or twisting his words on things like illegal immigrants and instead making that seem like racism, when I don't think anyone should be allowed to enter a country, any country illegally, people should be focussing on what he's doing with the platform of power he holds and the policies he creates or supports, rather than bashing his appearance or something he said a million years ago. If you use petty, irrelevant things to justify your dislike or disdain for him it sounds like you cannot come up with enough legitimate reasons to support your argument. If someone is bad for a country or is abusing their power you should not need to make things up to justify your opinion.
People actually watch cancerous shows like this and honestly wonder why our country is so divided...?
Obsessed with Donald Trump 😂
How come you have armed security you hypocrite?
Jimmy would rather support a dictator like kim, what a shame
Harvey Weinstein everybody.\nHe is just the top of the ice-berg from the stinking bubble that is Hollywood. Kimmel, go after him! why are you not after him like you constatly were Trump? ohh yeah thats right! because he is a part of your bubble!! you can't handle that! again fricking hypocrites the lot of you!
Okay we get it, you hate trump, can we move on to some real comedy now?
She is an inspiration ❤🌹
*HER VOICE IS SERIOUSLY NICE*
When I feel sexy watch out.\nI'm sorry Demi, I'll just keep watching! XD
Fox P Diddy f***** puffy she's only half Mexican half white singing with ebonics it's the way  people think so fake I've been through more s*** than her
Awwww I love you Demi, and I have always ever since I was 7 years old haha, you are such an amazing most beautiful, most talented human being, and I can't wait to see this. Your journey is not over yet, and I will always be right by your side for whatever happens next. :)
Damn she got a fat ass
I love you, Demi! Thank you for being brave enough to release this documentary that looks very personal, it means a lot to me.
She's so fucking gorgeous!!!! I wanna cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭
omg i cannot wait for this!!!!!
I cried and it's a FREAKING trailer
I love  you demi all of us are proud of you
Demi is sexy period she is always slaying my world she is mi reina 👸🏻
Oct 17 just in time for my birthday!!! Thank you so much I love you !!! 💙💙💙💙
OMG, I'M SO PROUD DEMI!! I've been waiting for this for so long!!!
I'm so excited to watch this . I love Demi since his starting, and she never let me like❤
started from disney now ur here👑 *shakes my head* still beautiful as always
God I love this woman so much❤
Real Lovatics are excited for the documentary and if you dont like her then fine but you dont have to proclaim it just stop watching/listening to her.
I can’t wait to know more a little about you (Y)
“Last line was great”\n“Yea” *Awkward moment of silence* “I mean Thank You” \n😂💖💀
I FUCKING LOVE YOU!
so fucking proud of you baby❤️
Man, I wish I could watch it but it's on YouTube red and I can't afford it😭😭😭
i would fuck her ! :)
you so excited to share with me I'm so excited to know you cos I'm in love with you boo big up
This made me cry 😢 Demi I’m sorry you had to go through that shit
I'm so excited for it
This is why you use auto-tune and i don't 😁
Seems good but Chris Brown's documentary is wayyyyy better 💕
I can't wait for this omg yes 😍😭
I love her so much. Her music has helped me through my own struggles so I’m definitely going to cry while watching this 😭😭😭
I cant wait to see it
From watching her on sonny with a chance, to now! She’s blossomed amazingly.
Demi, you are one of my complete idols and I love you so damn much. 💟💚❤💛💙💜💗
😚😚😚😚 love you Demi\npatiently waiting for #simplycomplicated 😍😗😗\n\nyou are the best !
Demi is just such a wonderful person❤️
YouTube must've paid a lot for this exclusive. This doc would've fit more on Apple Music, Netflix or even air as an MTV special. This being on YouTube feels so random. Anyone know if this will be on YouTube Red though? I really wanna watch it but don't want to pay for yet another premium streaming service, and I've already used up my YTR free trial.
I'm gonna cry watching this, i swear, this already breaks my heart a little :'( Love u so much Demi ! You're an inspiration for all of us <3
I need to watch this!
I mean thank you\n😂😂😂😂
mental health ain't no joke
Free of all demons! The journey is worth it and we are all on it. #Choose2LoveOneself #BackToOurEssence
I can't believe we will finally be able to know what actually happened all these years ago. I still remember what I was doing and where I was when I found out she punched a dancer. I was with her before that during and after and I'm proud beyond the word. I can't wait the documentary. <3
Is it free or do we have to pay to watch??
Yes I can’t wait!
How about the auto toon?
I’m so proud of my queen💖\n#weloveyou#lovaticforever❤️
School involved barrier ocboaw employer special primarily morning reverse journalist anxious even barn.
Omg this is out on my birthday 🎂
I can confidently say that Demi is a fighter and that makes her a celebrity
Watch out, people! DEMI is coming through!!! >.< Love you Demi! You will always be my favorite from Disney!!
I ❤ +Demi Lovato  and her voice looking forward for the full video.... 😋😁
i love you so much. thank you for being my sunshine for almost a decade. i don't know what i'd do without you. thank you for everything.
There are few people I love more then Demi
wow. who gives a royal shit?
Please put spanish subtitles in the video
DEMI IS THE EPITOME OF A WOMAN: STRONG FEARLESS AND CONFIDENT
Im so proud of Demi for opening up about her past struggles, her anxiety, her alcoholism, her suicidal past. People need to see that all these issues can affect anyone and that it IS possible to bounce back from it. To be better, greater, stronger. Love you Demi
I'll never understand why people don't like her.
*I love her so much.*
Can't wait! Thank you for sharing your story as it is inspiring and might help those with issues of all sorts and that they realize that it is okay to open up to someone. Side note... It does not matter who did it first, Gaga or Britney, it's not a competition. This is about Demi and her life; her struggles and her success. As fans, we should be supportive in the same way that we would want for our selves for the things that we have struggled through or may go through one day. It also doesn't matter whose horse is bigger some people with minor problems can't deal because they need help, because they have underlying issues. Anyways, i look foward to watching your documentary.
she's my energy💓❤
That last line was great\nDemi: Yeah\n*Big Pause*\nDemi: I mean, thank you 😂😂
My fucking idol !!
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
Sounds so good!!!!!

Where's the school uniform and one glove look? I prefer it when you look like a clown. And when are you going to do something other than going to chicken and chip shops. If my son ate at chicken and chip shops like they were Michelin star joints I'd disown him.

Hello, tonight I'd like to test some of our favorite and as well as some new sounds that can be triggering for you while testing my new mic set. I do need to work on some settings and get pop-filters still but overall I think these are pretty good :D What do you think? \n0-02:10 - intro and voice test\n02:19 - rolling crinkles sound\n05:55 - comb in the plastic ♥ \n09:47 - brushing of the mics\n13:27 - purple beads waterfall\n15:53 - crinkly sticky sounds\n17:47 - bumpy clicky sounds\n18:30 - shell beads high pitch clicky sounds ♥ \n19:41 - fast tapping on a smooth foam sheet ^_^ mmmm\n20:41 - light slime squishing and tapping \n21:36 - whisper test and goodbyes :) \nThank you, I hope you enjoyed it! ♥
I think a college course role play would be awesome! I always fall asleep in my class because my teacher's voice is similar to someone doing an asmr video. \nSpecifically, they are soft spoken and go over problems, opening and closing a brief case with sheets of answer keys inside that they take out and slowly go through for like 2 hours.
0:40 \nMe : uHM yES THERE I- *realizes its my own fan*
When did you upload your first asmr video?
Omg!! Especially the last couple of minutes, mooore of that please 🙏👍
Maria is the asmr GOAT! Hands down, no contest.
These microphones are soooo amazing! I listened to some of your old audios and the difference if incredible. Keep doing what you're doing!
With these new microphones, the layered sounds make me melt from the top of my head to the bottom of my spine. 🤤
Those mics are awesome. Quality is great. Im listening to this through sennheiser headphones
I really like your shirt.
My favorite one you've made
Maria do you use a tube preamp in front of the mic
2:20 alright let's start. I was almost passed out already. Really making me appreciate your work. Very cool. New mics are great thank you
Lush vid as always, super loving your outfit and chocker  tonight. 💕
My life is complete.
do u know whats crazy to think about? maria and jennamarbles are the same age
2:04: *enter christine's what do ya think compilation*
These mics are amaaaaaazing. I love them so much!
I like your other microphone for ear to ear, but this mic is really nice and relaxing as well
MARIA, WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR SWEATER???
ok but this outfit is super cute
this was incredible oh my god
You are so beautiful!
I've listened to this video 5 times and I still don't know what sounds there are because I fall into a coma
In this video Maria looks sooooo beautiful as well as every other video!
I cannot be the only one to finish the video then keep going back to the pink comb
I really like your outfit in this video.
Ohhhh you got the gear head in me going. Nice mics. i want to put some tube pre amps on those bad boys.
My favorite part was the whispers at the beginig, regards!
the og in the whisper game
I've read the comments and here's the awaited moment: Comb time!
OMG!! These mics are going to bring many more tingles for me :-)
People commenting: this is my first  ASMR video\n\nMe: welcome home my children 😭
Oh my gosh!!!!!! I LOVE it!!!! These mics and your camera quality are amazing!!!!!!! I have been tingle immune for awhile now but this gave me those so rare goose bumps!!!! I love it so glad I subscribed like last year!
I can't wait for your whisper videos with the new microphones! ❤️
Please make a white noise delete of the intoxicating sounds video 😍😍😍😍😍👌🏻👍🏻
Just your voice is enough for me to go tingling all the way to dreamland. But you still pamper me with stuff... \nLove your channel! 😊😊😊
I usually don't like ear to ear whispering because I don't like hearing the breath and the lip smacking, but this was done perfectly and the going behind part was so nice. By the end of the video I could feel tingles throughout my back and even down to my legs. So nice!
You are such a beautiful person, and ive been watching your videos for a while now and they never dissapoint! Thank you so much for what you do!
Does anyone else get tingles on the left side when she talks into the left ear and no tingles on the right and then tingles on the right side when she talks into the right ear but not the left? (So basically only the side she talks into responding to the ASMR and not the whole body)
You always look so beautiful girlie! And your outfit in this video is so cute!!! Love you Maria!
i was never really relaxed by watching the brushing of the mic until now 😍 it's so calming
Please do a longer video on the pink comb
1. Microphone is a keeper... 2. Please use those Waterfall beads again soon! Love you!
This is completely irrelevant but since I've known Maria for years, she gets more beautiful with each viewing 😍 I admire her well earned efforts in everything she does, she practically was my first real Asmr experience. Never will abandon this channel, ever.
Omg yes I've been waiting for this video I started to panic after school I saw no new video love you MARIA!
I absolutely looove LOOOOVE your soft whispers.. you are the only ASMR ist that givess me tingles and relaxes me
😲😲 first time ever after several years watching asmr videos that I feel tingles...😮🤪
Hey! I really like these mics, they sound amazing! I will say that The sounds were a bit quiet to me, I know its a personal preference and all, but I just like louder asmr sounds. Great Video! Keep up the great work!
I NEED AN ENTIRE VIDEO DEDICATED TO THAT BRUSH OMG
Please for the love of everything good in the world, could you please do a kissing video! It would sound amazing with the new mics!
Maria- great to hear your voice on these new microphones which I have been keeping my eye on for a while now.  I'm a voiceover artist so trying out new microphones is part of my job.  Really happy with the sound from these.
Well done And thanks
I am always blown away by how genuinely beautiful you are, but that California air must be doing wonders for you because you look so healthy and radiant! Thank you for sharing your sunshine with all of us! :)
At 1:00 I thought she said “I absolutely Love Mass Effect”
who else listened to this and started laying in bed immediately (such a relaxing voice!)
Wow! The microphones are amazing!!!
She looks a lot like Kirsten dunst from old spider man movies 👍🏼
YOUR SO PRETTY WITH YOUR NAILS AND HAIR AND MAKE UP AND OUTFIT 👌👌
Why is it that every girl that produces ASMR is ridiculously hot!
Incredible, nice job! I liked everything, but especially  the end with the sticky tapping and, ah, neck smelling 😆😊🔥
You are white noise
the best Mic I've ever listen to in my life, I'm like 98% tingle immune and with this even the crinkle gave me a tingle, please do more with these mics especially with a whisper!!
The best mic test ever!!!!! (hug) sooo much good asmr
Look, I know this video is all about the sounds, but it would be amiss if I did not say that you are looking stunning in this video. Although, with that being said, you always look a million bucks.
Please do a remake of the fully whispered vid with the new mics
I NEED THAT SHIRT IN MY LIFE!!! 🎀🎀💕
I love her outfit
I lOVEEEE💓💓💓💓💞💟❣️💔💕💛💚💙 THESE MICROPHONES!!!!!\nPLS don't ever change them!!!!Pls do a video Using them for pure whispers and brushing!!!!!!
These mics would be amazing for some dual ear stuff like at 21:50
Who's here before it gets a million views which is probably in less than 2 days.
I remember when I first found out about asmr; I never thought I'd be so deep into it.
So amazing! I love you Maria!
I've been watching A LOT of ASMR lately, and it was starting to lose its effect on me until I found this channel. The gentle whispering here works rather well for me and its extremely helpful! Keep up this quality content, its really good!!
The amount of dislikes on this video is ridiculous! Who the f*ck would dislike a fantastic ASMR video like this?! \n\nIf you like watching ASMR video's, and you gave this video a dislike, you do not know what ASMR is.
Who you calling pin head
Back to front is best.

WEDDING. RING. !!!!!!

WHEN ADAM WALKED IN I ALMOST CLICKED OUT IMAGINE HOW AWKWARD LMAO
CASPAR AND EVA VIDS ARE MY FAVE! 😍
We're the dares
What bothered me was the lipstick that was on her teeth ah haha
That guy with black hair and blue eyes is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
So if we learned anything from this video it's that guys who say condoms are too small are full of it. \nBe safe kids
i love yall and im glad adam was cool with this cause i appreciate the fake marriage so much lol
He slept with zoella in his dream
I like Casper’s pants 😂
Her tits are small than my nut sack
where is the second verse bro?
Wouldn’t be a Caspar Lee video without Silent Night!
I'm like a silent assassin *cringe*
It's not Caspar's video without Silent night 😂
You should do this with joe!
I think she said blindfolded hard something in the third question 😂😂
i need a part two hahahahahahhahaha
Watch this Amazing clip of SpaceX winning against all odds! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4Dz7TXnXSQ
okay i love eva and all but her eyelashes are not good atm
it’s so fucking weird because when i’m sober i’m all preachy and politically correct when it comes to public sex, but when i’m drunk i’ll literally have sex anywhere. like the car park of a costco or on the stairs of a costco or on a field of grass behind a night club 😂😂 wtf is wrong with drunk me
is it bad that i ship it
It'd be awesome if u checked my new vid
I feel like my childhood is ruined 😂😂😂 Eva why😂
she are Thai girl or not? 👧👧
I was equally amused and weirded out
your sing is so cool
The innocent ones are the most freaky ones 😂 oh Eva I feel you
Am I the only who's still waiting for the second verse
I dont want them to date i want them to fuck
Omg the first truth is definitely Saffron B! 😩😂
looks like a guy
i reckon the first truth he got about the dream is saffron barker
I thought I was the only one who masturbated to sleep

I'm still waiting for MYSTERY OF LOVE
Thank you, Sufjan, for making my day so much better!
I can't even get mad anymore at Suf for making me this sad.
How is Sufjan actually allowed to do this???
I cry, but smile, but also cry and smile to Surfman's music like a little bitch.\nHold me.
The most beautiful voice I ve heard. I adore this artist I don't think I am wrong in saying that he is a beautiful person, I really feel connected with Sufjan. I've attended so many concerts, so found of so many music styles, but when I saw Sufjan on stage both in France where I come from and in Dublin where I live,  I really feel he was welcoming us at home. So cosy, funny yet magical atmosphere. It makes me shiver anytime I listen to him,. Sometimes I feel nostalgic in a beautiful way listening to his songs, yet I never feel alone as I have the feeling to be with a spiritual, kindly friend. I feel so happy. I even suffered panic attacks following a trauma for a while, and listening to Sufjan was always the soothing way to chill down. I just wish him the best in his life, he is giving so much to many of us, I wish he realises the impact he has on turning our lives better, isn't it the most beautiful goal to achieve to make someone happy?
Oh how I adore the etherial sounds of Sufjan Stevens!
Tears are running down my cheeks.
WALLOWA LAKE MONSTER (lyrics):\n\nAs if you know the story of Wallowa Lake\nLeviathan first hid in the deep where her children sleep\nShe kept them hidden from the plague\nBut have you heard the story of my mother’s fate?\nShe left us in Detroit in the rain with a pillow case\nFortune for the paper weight\n\nWe followed her to Joseph, near the Indian raid\nShe wept among the weeds, hide and seek, for the fallen chief\nSpathiphyllum on his grave\nAnd like the cedar wax wing, she was drunk all day\nWe put her in the sheet, little wreath, candles on the crate\nAs the monster showed its face\n\nAs she waits for her children in the shade\nDemogorgon or demigod the ghost parade\nNo oblation will bring her back to our place\n\nShe stayed within the deep end of Wallowa Lake\nThe undertow refrained with the flame of a feathered snake\nCharybdis in its shallow grave\nShe gave us one last feature, the fullness of her face\nIn the shade of Hin-mah-too-yah… (Red Napoleon)\nAs the demon took her place\n\nAs we wait for the waters to reside\nHer remarkable stoicism and her pride\nWhen the dragon submerged we knew she had died
I'm not crying, you are.
I'm from Wallowa lake and the lake monster is actually a real urban myth from the Nez Perce Tribe I was told growing up:) this makes me so happy.
Carrie & Lowell part 2. I'm here for it, daddy!
Carrie & Lowell Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
This dude is  unbelievable.
Subaru Sedans is at it again.\ni can bet he is not using *A U T H E N T I C VIEWS D O T C O M* to get views \nas he is talented
The Greatest Gift is Sufjan Stevens himself. An angel in our midst, singing to God for all of us.
this is literally just a sonic fusion of age of adz and carrie and lowell lol
Like a continuation of Carrie and Lowell with added brass and strings... And the lyrics too, just wow
On National Coming Out Day no less
Every time I hear Suf's voice on a new track, I fall in love all over again <3
thank you, sufjan. we've missed you
this song is like half carrie and lowell, half age of adz
I never clicked a video so fast and I was not disappointed
i thought it was mystery of love...this is better
This guy is a genius
is this a nylon banjo?
You have no idea how we've waited for this
a 10 minute edit of the outro \npls
this album is gonna be the gayest ever i can feel it
There are sad days, and there are days Suf releases new music. These days are also sad, but in a good way. Thank you, Sadjan Stevens.
💕
Im wet.
Sad boi hours :'(
❤️
beauuuuutiful!
I fucking love you Sufjan❤❤
just heard this today on the radio tripped me out hard core
It's hard to believe that I've loved Sufjan for 12 years now.
Thank you thank you so much for releasing it on my birthday ❤
Boy, another goosebumps attack, just like the first time I heard the entire Carrie & Lowell album :')
Man I used to swim in wallowa lake all the time as a kid.
thanks so much for this and carrie and lowell. no one talks about complicated relationships with their mother
The lyrics of this song make me think of a family losing their mother to alcoholism. Additionally, it is sung very beautifully.
The brass and strings in this song sound similar to those in some parts planetarium
Been a fan since time began. Keep inspiring creative genius!
I looked at the picture and nutted
I NEED A MYSTERY OF LOVE!!!!
Sufjan I would do anything for you
This is so beautifull. Thank you, thank you !
The beauty of this song makes up for my disappointment that the new release is not Mystery of Love
Had a crappy day. This made it better
I feel like the more Sufjan gets old, the more he makes me cry with his music genius. Sufjan is like that husband who really loves his wife as time goes by both of them. \n\nI've been following him since 2008 and I'm still in love with him until now. And I'm afraid if tomorrow I'll not see your face again.
Honestly since A Sun Came I don't think he's come out with a lackluster song/b-side.  This song continues that trend.
started crying around 2:20 what a day
I was waiting for this  ... And wait is over :D  A SUFJAN FAN
*this is wine to my ears - both bitter and sweet at the same time*
Thank you, yet again Sufjan, for saving my life
Surfism Stovens is the musician of the century.
Think this is a B-side
I am crying and I don't know why
if i weren't at the uni library right  now (supposed to be studying) i would be crying...
All I can  think about when listening to  this song is “rhubarb rhubarb walla walla”
amazing <3
Horribly, disgustingly prim
goosebumps.
Maravilhosa
eu te amo tanto pirra
<3 mood
Ohhhh Sufjan 😍
so good :)
O boy❤
Sufj you killin me fam!!!
Beautiful, ethereal. Takes me to heavens.
Standard Sufjan....SUPERB!
HOLY FUCK WHAT??
‘Trending’
Thank you
ty daddy
[muffled screams in the background]
Exquisite Sufjan. I love you.
If his goal was to compete for the most depressing lyrics with the saddest music ever written, I think he quite easily achieved the victory. Every suggestion for a competitor is welcome
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
love it!!!!!!!
Omg omg . Love it !!!!
Hello Sufjan, I love you.
gorgeous conjuring track. as usual Sufjan delivering shivers down one's spine.
sooo great!!2 DAYS LATER!
Its astounding as usual
<3
why does he take forever to release albums -.-
Our boy got #20 on trending! 💪
thank you suf
sufjan stevens you're killing me
:,(
Fodeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
You are the Bob Dylan of our generation.
Dearest heart, you feel it rising do you not? How we love you and want you to know of our gratitude, simply for YOU Sufjan, Lowell and all in the family that is life. As an aside this notification came through while I am covered in hospital sheets. Too many hospital stays simply trying to keep death (life?) at bay... this is a gift I take with me on day 3. You lulled me to sleep last night with Carrie and Lowell and Planetarium on repeat. I am no longer afraid. I merely want release... we're all going to die. Look right into the light lovelies. It Wont.Hurt.A.Bit... Has your prayer only been LOVE? GOOD. For love is all...
Is this like B-side from Carrie and Lowell? Or from a new album? Sounds fantastic as usual. Still can’t wait for Call Me by Your Name tracks
noooo i thought this was a new album
18 days left.

What’s the song at the end????!!!
i like . it's very good ❤❤❤
I felt like I was in many different places at once.. IT WAS AMAZZZING! 😍❤️
Where's the storyline?😭😭😪
I like for Linsey. Love yours full themes. Great job.
I love that blond hair!!!!
Lindsey you are a true artist
i really love the theme is this <3
Lindsey just keeps getting better and better
Finally a song i like from her. Love her talent but most of her music grates my eardrums wrong 😭
I’m so increasingly disappointed in all of your new stuff. You have moved so far away from what I initially was interested in you for, which was the NOT super overproduced, poppy butt twerking and bleach blonde clone of every other celebrity. I guess it’s because you are a celebrity now. I just really miss Lindsey in the weird socks, or in totally home done makeup dancing around in a forest, or in cosplay. It all feels so... produced and fake and distant. Your music is just totally lacking too. It’s not atmospheric and epic in the way it was, it feels flat, boring and pop-produced. I don’t know if I can support you anymore. Which is super sad because you were my all time favorite musician. Now I feel like you are the opposite. Just another musician selling out.
really cool expression this! from the music, the costumes to the dance :)
Really good. One million in two days.... fine work.
i love that she combines dance with her music
This is so cool looking! Who did the choreo?
Any violinist could have played this part. Mindless techno on listen .
Style like a Vanessa Mae
Lindsey, great work. I like your stile and your musik is inspiring. Not only modern but even more fresh, unique. There might be other violinist, with other talents in playing old composed stuff, remaking, but you play your oen musik - and that's what amazing. I like your interpretation in dance moves too. Keep ongoing. I look forward to see and listen to much  more....
You are great and it’s all because of your songs and of you that I’m no longer depressed your songs cheers me up so thank you for making your beautiful songs and please keep making more I love you
Is that Crazy Frog I hear in the vocals?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNnRGtVkr6E&t=17s

Some one needs to dance to a Rockcandy song!!!! check out the song on my channel. Enjoy
The most valuable commodity on earth: golden Lindsey.
Even since I heard this song on your tour... I've been in love with it and hoped that one day you'd make a music video for it. Here it is and just what I imagined it to be. Thank you Lindsey for this wonderful dream come to life<3
IM GOING TO LISTEN TO THIS FOR ETERNITY UNTIL THE NEXT SONG.
Hello Ms. Stirling.. I am a violinist myself, you are inspiring me to challenge myself to play more difficult songs.. Thx!!!😄
You slay this world woman
I wonder what actual kathak would look like on this song :P
Lindsey, you are very talented, a wonderful gift from GOD! Don't forget HIM! No matter what you are promised in this short life, it is not worth the eternal damnation of your soul!!! May GOD bless you and keep you!!!
I listen to you every day and i love you so much you have also inspire me to be a violinista like you😂😂😂😂
You've inspired me so much!!! I really want to play the violin but mom says no.
i have been amazed once more with your music Lindsey! plz keep up the good work. i love every song each time i watch you dance as well as play your violin i want to be like you!
Hey love ... I’m super happy with this. All your videos are nice but I enjoy seeing you perform while playing it’s one of the things that sets u apart and makes me amazed by you thank you for this it’s like your old videos !!
Amazing! Each new video keeps blowing me away.  I am enjoying seeing you on Dancing with the Stars, too.  You are so inspiring!
Lindsey's got her Bollywood going on!!!
God told me she will be using her powers in his new kingdom to heal the world and she will join the chorus of holy angels, in our new beginning I love you so much and we will always be one with our creator.. keep healing this sick world it needs you more than you know Lindsey Sterling..
Love it.. You go girl !!

Congrats on Trending!! I love your music so much! I went to a concert of yours and I loved it!! ❤️❤️

Stunning as ever! But I do wish you hadn't dyed your hair. So many preformers go blond. Still a beauty for sure, but your natural self was best! :)
This. Is. So. COOL. 😍😍😍
I remember in 1st grade she came to our school and she did it for free.
Amazing performance, but really? no 4K....? What is this 1970?
She is a true blessing to music.... love ya Lindsey
Who's here right now?
She is BEA-UTIFUL. And this showed a side I've never seen before. Which is not surprising. She's always giving us surprises....she keeps me in my toes
You are facinating to watch. So cute too.

Love the music and love the black with red lighting look, reminds me of the minmatar.

This is so amazing! You're so talented, fantastic song and video<3
Thanks Lindsey for collaboration with a Indian😍!! Nice work!!

I cant be the only one to be strongly reminded of GW2's Path of Fire? \nI mean the name of the piece, the theme and style all fit so well!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Praise Joko
So happy to see how far you've come Lindsey! You're truly an inspiration and I hope you continue to make more music and bring happiness to everyone ❤
Its like she read my last comment and made the video. I wish the choreography was different from her show but I still love it.
YES YES YES!!!! by far my favorite video so far Lindsey you are amazing and magical and thank you so much for your music and spirit and passion!!!!!! it's contagious, listening to your music and watching your videos ignites my passion for life so strongly. my life wouldn't be the same without you!

I'm sad that Paperman didn't make top 3, it's my personal favorite! I'm also surprised that Get a Horse! wasn't in top 3.
My friend randomly brought a ukulele to school and during lunch she played a beautiful rendition of Lava and everyone stopped to listen.
Aw man, I was expecting you to mention the Mexican volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, they have a legend about an Aztec princess named Iztaccíhuatl that is in love with a handsome warrior named Popocatépetl, and they swore to marry if he came back after winning the war against the Tlaxcalans. But Popocatépetl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztaccíhuatl that his fiancé had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocatépetl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:
My favourite short is day and night
You talked about your son kicking and I automatically liked the video ❤
Meh. I don't think Lava is that great. Made it even worse when I saw Inside Out. The 2nd worst Disney Pixar movie! 😑
My favorite was the one about the guy in a desk job who was sad but ended up finding happiness and making friends and I just connect with it a lot.
@SuperCarlinBrothers. Ey! I think your video is cut off at the end... The vid needs some music! My songs might help youtube․com/XimerTracks
It could have been a turtle from Moana because Olaf will be in front of Coco so a mix of Disney and pixar in the shorts isnt unheard of.
Not going to lie I bawled when I watched this Short in theatres.
I've been waiting for someone who is worthy of my lava. I hope to be worthy of his lava too.....
Personally the first time I heard lava I teared up because I was lonely and wanted to meet someone and had given up because of past failures. But then I met someone later in life and now I can hardly remember being alone anymore.
Harry Potter question: We know that someone's Patronous and Anigmas animal are the same, because we were able to see McGonagall's Patronous. But if you change your Patronous, does you Anigmus change too?
piper yes it ain't any of your business.
This one is my favorite too.
If you want a place as a person... Hetalia
you should do a pixar movie tournament.
Are we not going to talk about the love of my life?! Israel “IZ” I-not-going-to-even-try-spelling-his-last-name?! He sang “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and is the main inspiration to the song aspect of the short! He’s a large Hawaiian who looks like Uku and his wife looks exactly like Lele.
Nooo.....Partly Cloudy is the best one!
NO. BOUNDIN WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST. BOUND. BOUND. BOUND AND REBOUND.
why did you stop the socks??????so sad
Who else thought he meant last video forever!
We sang this song in my choir class
Just started watching your videos and love you guys
11 minute explanation on why a 4 minute video is the best short.
my favorite one is the one with the sheep
do like if inside out have a series
me and my partner went to see Inside Out in the cinema when we were on holiday, and even though we were the only adults there without kids I was without a doubt the first person in that screen to cry. SO MUCH! at Lava 😭 happy tears though ❤
I would have picked lift
Lava was one of the first songs I learned on ukulele, so it has a very special place in my heart ❤️ The video has very nice aesthetic appeal as well
My Favorite short is Boundin'. I do not have a Lava story to share (but I love that short). Tournament ideas: Best Pixar movie, best Harry Potter movie/book, thins in the star wars prequels that sucks the least, best Disney song, and coolest movie character of all time.
It's pronounced Ookalaylee but it's been Americanized into Yukalaylee. So yeah, you're right to think you're pronouncing it wrong. also pronouncing ukulele in the proper way sounds like a pretty cool battle cry.
Anyone heard of Walk On’s?
Are you guys gonna do a trailer review for the new Star Wars trailer?
There is also the fact that story telling is a very big part of the Hawaiian culture and music. Not only do you have to tell a story by the lyrics, you have to tell the story by the music. I remember the first time I watched the short, (which btw is my all time fave as well), I was crying before I even watched the movie! lol. In other words: It was such an amazing short because of it told a story.
I thought you were going to say this on number 1. But it is based on a love story. More accurately, the love story of IZ, one of the most influential people in the history of hawaii. You probably know him for his somewhere over the Rainbow and what a wonderful world song.
I always sing this song whenever I hear it
Presto is the best these people don't know what there talking about
I really liked Lava too, but my fav is the 2D animated one about opposites.
LAVA!!! Ever since I was 3, I had been saying that I was waiting for my true love, then at 7, I met a nice boy in my class who liked me, then I liked him, but he had forgotten about me, but now I am currently dating him.
the story was based around the Hawaiian guy who sang Over The Rainbow, and his wife bc he was a large lonely man until his tall hopeful beautiful wife came into the picture btw
I literally remember being in the theater with my sister and this came on and we were in tears laughing at how dumb this was. It was literally a knock off song of the over the rainbow Hawaiian version with a super cheesy story. We were in hysterics
I have another napkin story!  Monty Oum smudged ketchup on a napkin in IHOP to make the world of Remnant in RWBY.  He also used different foods to symbolize ice, mountains, deserts, etc.  I feel like you'd like RWBY.  It's a little different than your normal content, but it's characters are very relatable and fun.  I think you guys could have fun with it.  Just consider RWBY pls.
My science teacher used the short to teach us about tectonic plates and stuff like that in fourth grade
Holy shit you're an exact rip off of vlog brothers disliked
Love this, just one little thing...Hawaii is a hotspot, rather than converging plates. Much like yellowstone, but under the ocean instead of the land.
Check out the Shakeman show page for funny bits not for the faint at heart or easily offended
Funny thing about that pole:  Lifted is my favorite Pixar short.
If Boundin' isn't your favorite there is something wrong with this generation
I can't unsee that the middle top little green man on his shirt is wearing a tie.
My top 10 shorts that are better than Lava. #1 being the best short ever.\n\n10. Partly Cloudy\n9. Boundin'\n8. For The Birds\n7. La Luna\n6. One Man Band\n5. Presto\n4. Luxo Jr.\n3. Lou\n2. Geri's Game\n1. Night and Day
Looks like they had babies hahahahaha I lost it 😂😂
Hello from peters creek road
Geri's Game will always reign supreme!
Everybody knows that the greatest Pixar short is Mr. Incredible and Pals
I think it's hilarious that he listened to this song on repeat after going to a beer festival
what the one man band seemed pretty cool im my opinion
7:22 Ugh! I love napkin stories.\n\nyEAh DoN'T yOu juSt LOvE NapKIn stORiEs?!!1??!1?\n\nI'm sorry that part was too funny for me
I love boundin its so cool
ok double the dislikes with 333 becomes 666😨😨😨😨😨😨
I disagree... I think Piper is the best short.
Enjoy Your Favorite Song >> http://bit.ly/FuLLmusIc << (FREE)
It's ook-oo-lay-lay\nNot yuke-a-laylay\n\nThere's a reason their names are pronounced that way, J.
Okay guys pleeeaase don't all shout at me but I actually didn't like Lava.. Sorry!
UGH i gotta follow you guys on twitter. Lifted and Bounding are some of my top two!!!!
I lava this short film.
my favourite short is the one with the old guy playing chess against himself for his own false teeth.
I like the older shorts better. Newer ones still pretty good
I'm pretty sure the Ukulele gets its name because while playing it your fingers look like little bugs (uku) jumping from string to string.
Aww men. The Blue Umbrella is the best one for me. But Lava is good too. 😁
My favourite short probably is Larva
Dayumn dude.. kid is not even born yet and the dad jokes begin. LOL. 6:22
Where can I get one of those Pixar balls!? :D
you couldn't just say Why I like this short\n\ntop 10 reasons? like we needed 10 reasons, nevermind top _10_ -_ -
Fun Hawaiian fact about the Uku is lice part, it's called an ukulele because your fingers are moving and jumping around like ukus
Actually the volcanos are most likely hot spots
What did the tectonic plate say after the earthquake.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm shook but it wasn't my fault.
I lava it
#ukulelescreamo
Pipper is probably my favroit 🐥🌊
No
Day and night
Sorry, but the number one reason, and perhaps the only reason necessary....IT'S A PUN!!! Puns are the best!
As a late 90's/ early 2000's kid I will always say that For the Birds is the best Pixar short.
Omg I used to watch these in school- never realised they were pixar!!!
Lava is the best but piper is the cutest
Do Is Descendants Mal a Disney Queen! (Or whatever Elsa is)
Geri’s game!!
Boundin was my entire childhood
#LiveLifeButtFirst\n\n#BrideCano
Mountain + whale\nMountainwhale\nMountwhale\nMowhal.....\nNARWHAL!!!!!!!!
R pixar shorts in the pixar thereoy
lava or inner workings
you shoud
Nope
This short sucks
Definitely the best pixar short!
Paperman
100000000000000\nVos for you
I admire you so much....i am 69, and been vegan for 9 months and have lost 47 pounds.  I wish i had figured out some of these things when i was your age.  You rock!
Aw Kiera! Thank you so much for sharing your story. Though you and I had different journeys (duhhhh different people), I feel exactly the same about veganism. It was like as soon as I started eating vegan, all the other problems I had went away. I stopped wanting to be thinner, restricting, calorie counting and just eat whatever I want, when I want. Everyone’s always saying how good I look physically, though I do regularly exercise now too. If you want any tips on how to get the ball rolling on exercising on the reg pls let me know. Sending love to you and Alex xx
Nothing better, or healthier, than a delicious, juicy sirloin steak from a 7 week+ hung side of beef.
I love your food videos ! They motivate me so much to eat better & to cook more & I love seeing meal ideas !
I ❤️ you so much Kiera ❤️❤️
What a brilliant video Kiera, huge respect for you for opening up about something so personal. I’ve had huge up and downs with food and my weight and have chronic ibs which makes things even more difficult! Have been wanting to go vegan myself for a long time but with ibs it’s extremely difficult and I haven’t found a way yet. Our relationships with food are such a complicated thing and the focus is always on weight loss above everything so thank you for talking about it from a different angle.
I too find it so hard  to motivate myself to exercise! It'd be great if you could share your journey when you get started ... it really is a mountain to climb ... Does Alex exercise? It's lovely he became vegan with you. Thank you for your videos!
I don't eat fruit. I eat pretty much all veg, but can't get over the fruit mental block :( hopefully one day
I adore you. And I love your what-i-eat-in-a-day videos so much more than most others, because they include a variety of foods of all kinds.
This video made me tear up. Your story is very similar to mine, wow. I did eat more of a variety of foods at home as a child, but still did a lot of overeating. The part where you talk about being a great student but still dreading school, being very introverted, wondering why you couldn't be like the other kids, was me as well. I'm in the process of making the switch to vegetarianism right now. Two months in, and I thought it would be hard, but I've been figuring out lots of recipes that I love which makes it easier every day. ❤️ (And trying to refrain from putting cheese on EVERYTHING 😅.) Anyway, thank you for sharing your story. ❤️
Thank you for talking about it. It is really meaningful for me.
I've been subscribed to you for years now. I relate to you on so many levels. This video however just blew my mind. Our stories are so unbelievably similar. Thank you for  being brave enough to share your experiences. And thank you for normalising and demistifying veganism as much as you do. You, and your videos, are very much appreciated ❤️
you're hair looks amazing!!! it really compliments your face <3
I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already! I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too! Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself. My point being that you've done amazingly, and I can really appreciate the progress you've made
Maybe try trampolining classes for fitness? Could be really fun and a great throwback!
Thank you for making this video Keira! \n\nyour food videos have always been a big help to me, reminding me how important it is for me to be chill about food, eat that ice cream, try that fake cheese ect \nveganism has also done so so much for me in repairing my very broken relationship with food
Thank you for producing such an honest video about food. I too had a big problem with textures of food growing up and it is nice to hear someone talking about it! I completely agree than Minamilist Baker is a life saver - has opened my eyes as well. I have only been vegan for 4 months now and have been enjoying getting to know you through your channel. It takes a lot of courage to go online and talk about these things and I really respect you for having the confidence to do so.
I didnt get my weight loss ca. 1,5 years after I went vegan. All the other people mentioned it to me and they still do. Sure, I realized I could downsize my wardrobe here and there in the sizes I needed to buy. I still don't weigh myself. That's what I stopped since I moved out from my parents house. Avery helpful video. Thank you Kiera. All the love. <3
Wow this helped me a lot and opened my eyes. I'm vegetarian and I stress over a lot and I found myself gaining weight rather then losing it. Then again my diet isn't the greatest.. but you've inspired me. I honestly always wanted to go vegan and I will get there one day but thanks for inspiring me!❤️❤️❤️
Just found you through this video loved it I wish I wash brave enough to talk about weight mental health and veganism on youtube but I love watching videos about it 💗
I think your food videos are really awesome! You show that you can eat what ever tasty food you want when you go vegan and you're not hard on your self and you show it for what it is, delicious! Anyone who's is vegan and promoting it is admirable. Not everyone needs or wants to be a health guru. You do you!! You're doing great work.
oh my god, thanks a lot for sharing.
Veganism is so beneficial in so many different ways!\n\nLoved this video <3
You look So gorgeous in this video!
Thank you for sharing this, Kiera!\n\nI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that - as you said - cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.\n\nRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy! :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you! ^^
My cat came to sit with my when I clicked on your video. Kind of sweet :)\nI (like so so so many others) have struggeled with food from a young age. I'm 29 and I'm still not OK with it, but since going vegan it's gotten better. I focus more on health than on weight and slowly but surely I think I'm actually heading somewhere :) \nThank you so much for sharing. You're such a wonderful and inspiring human being xx
Self defence classes? Hell yeah, become more like Xena!
I love this. I relate to this so much and I can say right now, my relationship with food is not the greatest. No one would even consider me fat but I was very overweight when I was younger and I still tend to feel like a little fat girl this was inspiring.
I had a very similar experience with food, I hadn't eaten onions until I was about 17 and only tried courgettes this year! I do not like a lot of food textures and I have a lot of food aversions! It was really nice listening to someone else talk about this The environment I grew up in wasn't good, and I was fed nothing but chicken nuggets and chips and other freezer food, when I moved in with my other parent at 14 it was mad, I'd never really seen fresh vegetables in my home before that and it's been such a long journey to start eating properly and enjoying food! Cooking is a big part of my life now and I also find it very therapeutic! I recently got into exercising, an I've been doing the wii fit aha, retro I know, but it's nice exercising when nobody can see you!
Thank you for this video. My eating disorder history is different but it is nice to see that you have gotten better and made progress. Seeing you talk about it and how it got easier is really encouraging.
Thank you so much for this video. I'm on my own journey to resolving my life long issues with exercise and food and it is so inspiring to see someone who has gone through simillar struggles and has come so far. No matter how many videos I watch of super healthy exercise and diet people I watch I never know where to begin but your channel actually makes it seem possible. Thank you for showing me that I'm not alone.
Ah I’m so proud of you! (And Alex!) thank you for sharing this with us 💕 you’re so amazing and definitely continue to inspire me. I’ll forever love your videos, super chill and feels like I’m hanging with my friend ❤️ (I’ve stuck around since your red hair days! And your pink/ purple fringe and blue hair days lol) so glad you’ve stuck with YouTube. Thank you 😊 much love 💕
I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :) - loved hearing of your story and experience. You show food in a very natural and easy way that I think a lot of people understand better myself included 😊
I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures. It's got so bad that me and my partners friends won't invite us out to certain restaurants because they worry I will not be able to eat anything on the menu 😞 I feel like I really need to be open minded to trying new foods especially fruit and veg. I'm really glad you did this video it made me feel like I'm not the only one who has food struggles ❤
Great video! I was also a very plain picky eater as a kid (only ate white food i.e. Chicken and potatoes) so I can relate a lot! I started being more adventurous with food (also as a result of meeting my boyfriend) and now I love trying new things my family are constantly amazed at the change 😜😜 have you tried any recipes from Monami Frost's vegan cookbook?
You look extremely beautiful always. and i think you are a great person
Thanks so much for sharing your journey with us! :) \nI felt the same when I went vegan - I lost some weight, but I gained a whole new world of delicious food, compassion, knowledge and I feel the best I've ever felt - the weight is just a thing that happened along side that!
Great video! It was so interesting to learn more about your lifestyle. Thanks for sharing. :)
Thank you for sharing your story. It is a brave thing to do and it's a brave thing to share what you eat to the world especially if you've struggled with food in your lifetime because people can be really brutal online. Here you are not hiding behind a veil like the people who judge you are and putting yourself out here and it's really inspiring. I love to hearing that despite the judgement you recognize your own personal achievements like eating a variety of foods. I can't tell you how much this really does help. You seem like such a sweet person and I really enjoy your videos and hope you enjoy inspiring others with what you make.
Thanks for sharing your journey! Sorry you suffered a traumatic event that affected you so adversely! Just look at how far you’ve come!! Be kind to yourself!! Love your channel!
Veganism has also changed my life! It's so lovely when things fall into place. Thanks for sharing your story. It resonated with my own story so much.
❤️❤️❤️
I like food
It’s nice to see a vegan, and I know not all vegans are like this but they do exist, who doesn’t force veganism down non vegans throats because they see it as a superior way of life when they a lot of the time themselves are restricting their diets so much they have border line eating disorders that are not healthy and sustainable in the long run. She just seems to natural and real like a normal vegan with a diet that is healthy and makes her happy, it’s nice. Sorry for the paragraph just thought I would say 😂
I struggle with food textures. Like onions. They're a slimy slippery nightmare! But man do they smell good and give off a great flavor.
At 21 years old I’ve never met or even heard anyone else being so ‘fussy’ with food like me. For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with the textures of food and in consequence have a really basic diet, also being vegetarian that doesn’t even eat fruit and veggies is practically unheard of lol. It’s so reassuring hearing that you’ve managed to overcome this your self and gives me hope for the future that I can do this myself
Awww Kiera. I still remember asking if you were vegan a long while ago and you said you weren't yet. Your journey is amazing. So many animals saved. You look so beautiful , you always have quite frankly...oh and the grown out fringe definitely becomes you! <3 from Long Beach, CA USA
Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.\n\nI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.\n\nI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. \n\nTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.\n\nI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.\n\nKeira - thank you for being so honest. You're honest and have no shame and it means that people like me can be honest too. \n\nLove you x
Oh my god this video was so personal thank you for sharing 💗 your thoughts from childhood were so heartbreaking but comforting at the same time to hear someone else feel the same. I'd like to think that if our younger selves knew each other, they would have been pals 💗
Such a lovely and inspiring video...I can really relate to your story and struggle. Well done on getting so far! Xxx
Great video Kiera! Talking about food and diet on here (especially if you're vegan) can be so nerve-wracking! I used to be a pretty picky eater myself but once I cut out meat from my diet I was sort of forced to try so many new things - most of which I really enjoyed! I follow Dana too, she's so unbelievably helpful. ohsheglows is pretty amazing too ^_^ Hope you and Alex had a lovely anniversary!
thank you for sharing your story <3\ni've also struggled with food my whole life, had anorexia as a teen, but now that i'm vegan (been vegan for 14 months) my symptoms have lessened significantly, i feel a lot less guilty about eating and have managed to maintain a healthy & stable weight - i think the knowledge that i'm making a difference by eating plant-based really helped me feel better about food\ni've also been going to therapy which has helped, and figuring out the root causes for my mental health issues has given me so many tools to improve
you look beautiful and your so brave x
You are an amazing person Kiera!!! Keep on being fab x
You are the only person that helped me stop feeling ashamed of being a size 16 because I think you are so unbelievably beautiful and it helps me think that I might be beautiful too ❤
Anyone who would dis your diet or lifestyle or tear apart your daily menu must be extremely disillusioned by something that has absolutely nothing to do with you, personally.  Every video you make is honest and non judgmental to anyone out there. Why there are people out there in the www (is that an old term?, I'm over 50 yo so sorry if I'm not up to date), who seem to seek out reasons to hurt people are doing well in their lives? Hopefully these few ( and I sincerely hope they are few) who feel they must take time out of their day to make disparaging remarks about ANY of your videos will soon realize that it's not YOU or anyone else but THEY who have a problem. Sorry to go on for so long.
so important! amazing video hun x\ni've noticed it's quite common for many people that after going vegan their relationship with food changed. \nin my case...I don't want to say that I forgot about my ED but it just....I don't know, different things started to be more important and I was just so excited about foods? With trying new things - high five. As a kiddo the only veggies I ate were chips and mushrooms. Maybe cauliflower. And now? Look at me! For dinner today I had bowl of SALAD bigger than my head :P\nI'm so happy that you're doing better and that you having back control over what's happening :*\nLots of love :*\n\nalso - vegans judging other vegans over who's more vegan - GTFO\nanimals don't care if you eat raw till 4, if you're frutarian, if you juicing all day or if you stuff your face with mac n cheese. As long as it's vegan, you're good to go!
You are #22 trending! Really interesting video I went vegan almost two years ago and it really changed the way I thought about food. Also it helped with binge eating (for me chocolate) when things aren't vegan I have absolutely no desire to eat them 👌🏽
this video was so honest and real and from the heart <3 thank you for sharing Kiera, you'll have helped so many xo
I SPY A NEW PLANT BABY!
I agree with other commentators that if you want to exercise more, then find something you LOVE! ^____^ I started hula hooping/ hoop dancing almost 2 years ago, and I love it so much because it is FUN and creative! :) And as a circus skill, anyone can learn it, all it takes is practice!  \nThank you for this video, even if if was super hard for you to do, you did a great job, and you are making me more and more interested in becoming vegan! ^____^ X
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD
I hadn't eaten all those vegetables or really ANYTHING either until I went veg and pretty much forced myself into it
Your hair is amazing right now
I super related to the taste and texture sensitivity issue. I tell people all the time I can't eat certain foods cuz they feel off to me. Definitely agree that my partner influenced my ability to expand my tastes. Still struggling with my weight but I less overeat and more so eat poorly and lack exercise. Loved this video so much for it's honesty And realness
I'm a fussy eater as well. I also hardly eat fruit because of the textures! It's like you are describing me! I would have to try new foods at friends houses because I didn't want to be rude. I'm 28 now and I'm still fussy but my fiance (got engaged last week after being together 6 years!) has pushed me to try new things and my diet isn't amazing but I'm doing well :)\nThe way I eat fruit now is smoothies! It's the easiest way I find to do it.
Really interesting video Kiera , iv suffered from bulimia since i was 16 at 20 i went vegetarain and it really helped me to feel more comfortable with food. However i still suffer from bulimia and im struggling at the moment with over eating and i feel like im really suffering but i cant stop and i sont know what to do i need help. X
You are truly inspiring and yes! Cooking helps so much when making the transition and it's so much fun to challenge yourself with different recipes. Hot for food is another awesome blog if you haven't checked it out yet.
Just to say that you look absolutely beautiful in this video.  And now I will watch the rest 😂
so happy for you!!! i love hearing everything u have to say <3
I'm not vegan or ever plan to be one but I really do enjoy your videos on cooking! It's awesome that you share what you love without trying to push anything on anyone :) Keep up the amazing work!
The pea pesto is my favourite too!
As we grow our taste buds change I don t do well with vegetables but after 19 I started to be able to tolarate them before that I would eat potatoes. My relation with food and weight is also shit, university isn t helping my situation either...
This is like looking in a mirror. God, some of the things you said hit me so hard in the chest. I just have to say, you are not alone and the struggle is real.
You are very brave and beautiful. Thank you for sharing ❤️🌱
When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.
Find a fight like xena class.
Thank you for this video Kiera! I have struggled with my weight and insecurities my entire life. I started going to the gym last year and it has helped me so much , not only about the weight I just feel better in general <3
have you ever heard of Neophobia? from what you're describing it sounds like you may have had that in the past, but look into it if you don't know what it is and see for yourself obviously! Nice video btw xx
Thank you for sharing, great video. Also your hair looks amazing!
Thanks for speaking so openly about this topic. I was very shy as a child. Although I wasn't overweight, I established a strange relationship with food. I never gained Body Positivity so things like shopping clothes, wearing a swimsuit... are stressful to me. It's good to hear that there are some other people, dealing with this problem.
Honestly, I am so happy that this video didn't really focus on weight loss being the number one topic, but rather your increasing enjoyment of food, how happy it makes you, and how you don't obsess over being perfect about it. I think that sends a great message to younger girls (and old ladies like me - lol) who may be watching your video. And vegans too! From one chill vegan to another - thumbs up for this one. <3
I've always loved the idea of veganism, but I'm afraid of carbs. I have a liver disease where basically I need to lose fat, and they suggest a low carb diet, which has worked so far, but I don't like eating meat since I was raised vegetarian so I feel conflicted. It's hard finding a balance I guess. Thanks for this video, I've always had a complicated relationship with food and it helps hearing other people's perspectives and journeys :D
*you should try proper working out*\n*i used to hate it when i started myself pretty late in life, but then i learned to love it!*\n*most things in life we don't like when we're not good at them, but no one is good at anything he has never tried*
I bloody love your what I ate videos. I think it shows what real life is like and that not everyone is a health nut. Vegan ism personally isn't for me but I think your videos also show that veganism isn't just a bunch of salads all the time. You're looking fabulous and as long as you are happy then that's brilliant 👏🏻💕
I think everyone in the comments will hate me for this but... In one of your really earlier videos I did make a comment to you about my concern that there was a lack of vegetables and fruit and now I really regret what i wrote, I wasnt trying to be rude I thought I was trying, in my weird way, to look out for you. I thought I was being helpful, but wasn't aware of the issues you faced, so I want to take this moment to apologise, I'm sorry and I really hope that I didn't offend you.
I relate to basically all of this. I’m 22 and I still can’t figure out my relationship with food. I feel like it’s never gonna get better :(
You're amazing💜

Love u 💓

#YIAYpoint to does life really have a meaning or does it have something more to offer, is there life after death and do we get to see our love ones again, is there really a heaven or hell and is there a devil or a Jesus, how many years do I have left.\n\nwell these are questions that people has asked themselves in this life time and still don't know the answers yet, what I do know is that life is vary confusing and its hard to understand what life is all about, let me sum up for you that life is really about and see what you think what life is really about.\n\nthe meaning of life- The meaning of life is a philosophical and spiritual question concerning the significance of living or existence in general. It can also be expressed in different forms, such as What should I do?, Why are we here?, What is life all about?, and What is the purpose of existence? or even Does life exist at all? It has been the subject of much philosophical, scientific, and theological speculation throughout history. There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds.\n\nThe meaning of life is in the philosophical and religious conceptions of existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness, and borders on many other issues, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question What is the meaning of my life? The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of ultimate reality, or a feeling of oneness, or even a feeling of fearness.\n\nthis is what I found to be close to what life really is and how we take this information and use it for the good, life is like a summer breeze that blows right by us, or its like the little things we enjoy like sipping on a good whiskey or maybe having a glass of butter milk, whatever it is we must take it like a grain of salt and do the best we can that was giving to us in this life time.\n\nremember this life is to short to be upset or to be upset with others, we must forget our past and only focus on the future and keep pushing on, because one day we might not get the chance that we want to do in this life time. I spoke to a man about life and his words spoke true to me what he said was the reason why it rains on earth is because all the angels is crying and that a desert sun in the morning time is more beautiful than anything else, the man also said that when he would look at the sunset or sun rise he didn't know if he was still on earth or looking directly at heaven.\n\nand his words has stuck by me for awhile now and I think about what he said to me and that i know that life is full of mysteries and possibilities for us all and all we have to do is just find that one true meaning for us all.

#YIAYpoint In modern mathematics, a point refers usually to an element of some set called a space.\n\nMore specifically, in Euclidean geometry, a point is a primitive notion upon which the geometry is built, meaning that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a point is defined only by some properties, called axioms, that it must satisfy. In particular, the geometric points do not have any length, area, volume or any other dimensional attribute. A common interpretation is that the concept of a point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in Euclidean space.\nShow less\nREPLY

Got this notification while I was in train returning home from school and never have I ever felt so lively and yet so dead at the same time. \nJulien never fails to amaze me. I’m so grateful for her and her music. \nThis is phenomenal.
She's done it again
Can she even write a bad song? Next time I'm just hitting Like before I even listen.
Lyrics:\n\nThere's a hole in the dry wall, still not fixed. I just haven't gotten around to it and besides, I'm starting to get used to the gaps. Say wish you could find some way to live to be so hard on myself, so why is it easy for everyone else. I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow, I guess.\n\nAnd I never do it but it's not a joke. I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone. Is it real or a dream, which is worse, can you help me? I just wanted to go to sleep.\n\nWhen I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. There's no one left between myself and me.\nBut when I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights, there's no one left between myself and me.\n\n\n\nJB's new single is amaze y'all. Enjoy it. I sure am. 😊
Well I was not prepared to cry today and yet here we are
2:30 breaks me
Damn son! Out of left field. I've heard this song so many times through live recordings and I couldn't wait to hear this track in its final studio version and there it is (And it came with a music video!). Ack October is snailing through right now, the 27th seems so faaaarrrr.
I'm actually gonna fly from Moscow to Paris just to see her show in November...
So excited for the album <3
This a bop, I'm crying but this a bop
This album is gonna be amazing.
This is an entirely new level! Can't wait to hear her new album!
The tears are real son
Omg I wasn't prepared for this
And I thought I couldn't love her more
The perfect way to kick off fall is with a new Julien Baker song and a good cry. This is wonderful. <3
Entirely in love with her.
so keen for new album
Goosebumps. Pure art. Oct 27th please hurry.
Magical sound
Greatness.
She makes me want to be a better person
So lovely, u are are my favorit artist Julien.
No one inspires me more than Julien does. Absolutely cannot wait to see her next week.
Darn. My life’s changed forever since I found Julien, and each song touches my soul in places I didn’t know existed before... Thank you.
Julien, you just get me. Thank you.
This song is a masterpiece <3
Absolutely breathtaking
Ouch oof owie my emotions
A new sooooong!
YES
Slowly it start to sound similar...
How is she running after that sprained ankle?
The use of 35mm color film here is something from out of a dream. It’s subconscious and unreal. The shot of Julien coming out of the smoke before she starts running is my favorite.
I love her and so happy shes releasing new music.
I remember the first time I heard it live. Damn, I had goosebumps everywhere. I love that song. I love Julien. Can't wait for the new cd to come out.
Me vs Maradona vs Elvis. So much Brand New in this song. Love it
wow!
once again I clapped physical claps
Beautiful
In portuguese, we have some expressions to descrive fellings, things, in this case music, that we fell like overwhelming. Its:«do caraças!». the music of little Julien Baker is... do caraças.
I like how the wire is not actually burning its way through the place, but is just being pulled while the end has a sparkling effect to it :D\nthis song tho <3
well I just had 3:35 minutes of goosebumps
really wished I could have seen her open for jason isbell at the ryman the other night! she's amazing.
Beautiful song! Masterful video! Great job Julien and crew! Wish you all the best!
Only person in my life that makes me feel something and I'm tired of feeling nothing. ♥️🏳️‍🌈
Oh my gosh! Even the sound of her footsteps in the beginning gave me goosebumps.
My god this woman can do no wrong. Simply amazing! Whoever disliked this video; FOR SHAME MAN!!!
We need a song with Julien Baker and Dallas Green
She's an angel sounds so beautiful Love her voice gives me goosbumps
It's in 4:3 so you sure as hell no it's artistic ;)
Pretty awesome, at the end 2017 it was a good year 😍
Recently discovered Juliens music by accident. Now I need this album
I know its not her style, but im a sucker for at 2:30 if a full band came in and just thrashed the outro
I love every new song more than the last. The only downside of an artist like Julien is that every re-listen to one of her songs will never be as good as that first emotional journey, one where you could never be  sure of what was about to hit you. It still hits you of course, but I wish I could go into every song having never listened to it before.
tears everywhere
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow I guess.
I am crying.....again.
holy crap! Although she writes kinda sad songs they always fit for every kinda mood....
Got to see her when she played in New Zealand! I'm hoping she tours this album here again, she's the best female artist in the world.
what if she sing with dallas green?
The mother Fucking GOAT. Best music I've heard in the last few years.
This video was shot next to my house
wtf shes a crack
what camera is used?
Maybe this will sound better in the album, but as a single and in general, its the most boring JB track to date IMO.
HOW YOU DOIN'? Sharing is caring (and good for your mental health...let me know and talk to each other and be nice to each other and give virtual hugs down here plz) <3
Yet another ugly plastic cunt with too much fake up....sup bitch what you trying to hide...your ugly face
Thank you for a great video again Mel xx. All my support and big hugs to everyone who is going through some rough time! Please believe me everything will be Ok, im speaking from personal experience of recently getting over depression, because of a bad brake up from an abusive long term relationship! The only thing i have to say Mel is that i miss your makeup vids and pamper routines, they were the inspiration for so many of us to put something together and relax at home, which is always helpful especially if you ate having a bad bad day!
I suffer from bipolar disorder and I'm currently sipping hot chocolate and you my lady are so soothing 2 watch 😊😊😊
I feel like you've just described my life. For one week out of every month my life gets put on halt because of my period.
I am SO affected by PMS and it's something I really want to talk about on my channel as it's actually so common for women. You are not alone xxx
Would love a red wine hot chocolate tutorial!!
if You think the film is emotional you should try reading the book, I literally couldn't see the words and had to stop because I was sobbing. I recommended it to everyone when I read it.  💚
Another day, another frustrating commute, but doing okay. Need more sleep. :-) Have you seen the film Dog Park (w/Owen Wilson's brother Luke)? It's not for crying, but rather laughing. I'd think you need more smiles than tears right now. Hope you get through it okay. Baby steps, right? ^_^
Isn't H as in H&M supposed to be pronounced aitch not haitch? Just wondering. English is not my native language.
I really don't get the difference between Jam and Marmalade! Here in Spain, I think it's all the same thing, and we call it Mermelada so, marmalade.
I absolutely love you, keep being you girl 💕
I love your short hair, but I know you are going to grow them anyway! <3
I enjoy using Lush R&B on my ends and u can rub it into your hands afterwards.
Oh girl, Marley and Me ruins me every time I watch it. Good choice. \nI'm not doing very well. I feel like I'm stuck in chaos and I'm anxious about everything. I'm so angry, yet so tired. And I'm super scared because when I get into these angry and tired and anxious stages, the immediate stage is depression and just feeling completely numb and apathetic which is not good for me. So I'm desperately trying to find all the moments of good I can find. \nYou're videos are helping and I just want to reach out by saying that even if you're in this place of not feeling yourself, you will feel like yourself again, everything is cyclical and a journey (as I'm sure you know). I'm wishing you strength and love <3
I feel you Melanie! Periods and PMS do affect me a lot even though I try to be strong and focused but it just does affect me every month. I'm learning. \nLove your channel 😀
Red wine hot chocolate? YES Miss Melanie please!! Awesome video Mel, helps so much just to sit down and relax to here you talk
Don't worry Melanie, that happens a lot after finishing projects,  you feel sad and confused,  but what you need to do is  go out, visit things and  go to places,  find  inspiration, and soon you will feel fantastic again,  and  you will find something to manifest your creativity too, remember we love you, and  we are  here for you!
Melanie, you're so pretty
Honestly, I'm not doing okay.\nI picked my major back in high school, got a degree, and then got two jobs because that's what I was supposed to do.\nI'm tired of doing what I'm supposed to do.\nI loathe my major, and it makes me depressed working on it.\nI started my YT channel because that's my true passion, and it's helping.\nIf anyone could send me good vibes, I'd love that :)\nTo anyone reading, hang in there if you're feeling down today <3
I'm a slave for my hormones... i need to have an oral contraception, i'm a mess without that, physically and psycho. With the pils, i just have anxiety and migraines few days before my pms get out. I know it, so i can deal with it. \nI understand what you said about not knowing what to do. When my calendar is empty for few days, i feel empty. When i see an entirely month empty, it's the worst. I need to have mini goals through the year. It's ok to have some days with nothing to do. Nothing like oblivion. But we, humans, need these moments to find peace, enjoy the quiet... go shopping, watch tv, clean house. Just relax. \nAnd the calendar will be filled day after day. Plan some vacations for december, plan a birthday, a tattoo, a lunch with family... little things. Let the life guide you , like an otter on a river. ;)
Hand over that hot wine chocolate recipe! Love you ❤️
So how do you make this red wine hot chocolate? 🤔🍫🍷
I cry every single time i watch Marley and Me and i have a yellow labrador who's 9 now :(((
I love these videos Melanie 💚 seeing that your not happy and perfectly wonderful 100% of the time makes the rest of us feel more normal (what ever that is) love your videos, keep being you 💚😘💚
tysm for this, mel. i've been feeling pretty down recently myself but your videos make me feel hopeful :) i hope you find that same positivity! much love x
I have generalized anxiety disorder. I've been doing quite well with therapy. However, last month I was PMSing and I couldn't even go to sleep because I kept overthinking everything. As soon as I got my period it went away. Hormones fucking suck
Melanie, I'm happy you shared a video with us  even though you weren't 100% feelin it. I think it's incredibly noble to be vulnerable on camera and I just love your content! It's good to let yourself feel.
I feel you sooo much. Recently, I feel like the PMS, Menstruation and recovery phases take up about 75-85 percent of my time. I have become extremely withdrawn. More so since I don't have any Projects going on right now.
Love the way you edited this video at the start showing how you were scatter-brained, but at the same time still had you talking!
i bloody  love how the red has faded  in  your hair to ginger like...  i always wanted to  go  that red but i also  wanted to go that ginger so it's  like best of both world and it grows out nicely  too
Generally the week before my period starts I get so so sad and down for at least a full week and it ruins everything because I have no motivation and I get so easily stressed and overwhelmed with everything. It sucks
You do seem a little off, tlking faster than normal. Hope you feel better soon  :)
Love you, and proud of you for posting this video even tho you weren't feeling yourself (still loved it, just always feels like chatting with a friend). 💚
very random and off topic...but gosh you're gorgeous!!
Ive had a good week ,I did 1500 steps in aid for mental health for my school and we raised a flag for awareness
I feel exactly the same right now !! Kinda deflated I think .. anything will put me in a mood eeesshh! Pms is the worst :(
YES for talking about being so weird and scatterbrained during certain times of the cycle. Happens to me too, at least zwo times during one cycle. I recently found cbd oil drops, they seem to help my anxiety. Best from Germany <3
I feel like you're the sister I never had. I relate to you so much with everything you say and we look weirdly similar ?? (My mum's Irish so that might explain it) but I love your videos, you're the cutest!!
Is the Garnier hair mask available in the US? I found it on the UK Amazon site, but I can't find it on any US site.
Out of all my friends, I am the one who suffers from serious symptoms of PMS. I've been diagnosed with PMDD and do have meds for it but I try not to take it unless i REALLY need to. I just turned 29 and I realized that my PMS was really bad in my mid 20s - 23-28 were my worst years. I also have crazy anxiety but that hasn't been diagnosed by a doctor, I just know it gets alot worse during my PMS.  I feel like I have the same issue as you - when there isn't something i am working on, I am extremely scattered brained. I just started journaling this week. Hate to admit - I've only done it once this week but I do want to stay committed. I feel like that is an emotional release for me on paper.  I also realized reading also helps with my PMS. I sorta just shut myself out from the world and dig into a book and that REALLY helps.
Hun, I'm sorry it's not a good spell right now. Just remember another one of those wonderful life affirming days will be just around the corner. \nSending a hug :) \n\nAlso, the words: red wine hot chocolate in conjunction with one another are perfection. PLEASE make a tutorial! X
I hate Marley and Me it's so depressing 😡
I've been sick in bed all day :/ but I'm feeling a lot better I've been bingeing your food diary Fridays and videos in general ❤️ I saw a clip of you vlogging from the Scotch Hall bridge and had a spit take moment because I live there ( drogheda,, not under the bridge 😁 )
thank you for this video . the past two days i've been shit like zone out or something.  and I've so much assignments to do . 😣🖒 are you doing vlogmas?
Yes! i have PMDD and it sucks
Oh Mel💚 It breaks my heart to see you down, I sincerely hope you're feeling back to normal again soon. I'm proud of you for still filming despite your struggles, and even sharing them with us so we know we're not alone. And neither are you:) Much love💚💚💚
I need that red wine hot chocolate receipt <3 and thank you for mentioning briefly that all the girls PMS and menstruation doesn't affect so much, I'm one of them usually when it comes to periods and I feel like it is criminal to talk about having easy periods when so many struggle with them. I also would like to hear more this kind of honest conversation around all the hormonal stuff .
Have you heard of anhedonia? It's a condition where one is unable to feel pleasure in things they would typically enjoy. It's a common symptom of depression but there's no reason why it shouldn't exist without full-blown major depressive disorder or whatever. I also associate it with a lack of motivation etc which is why what you said reminded me and I thought I'd mention it just in case there was the smallest chance it could be useful. Sending all the love xx
Hi Melanie, I totally feel you. I feel like a different person the week or two before my period. I question life decisions, friendships and my own self-worth. I'm slowly learning to work through those feelings, but it's always hard.
It's so amazing that you talk about everything with huge honesty. I know our situation is so different, but I think I had the same issue that you have now in the summer. I accomplished a big goal of mine and after that I just didn't know what to do with myself. I'm a creative person and then somehow I lost all my creativity and motivation. I just wrote it down cause I'm so happy that I've heard someone else talk about it. I felt like nobody understood what I was going throught. I hope you'll feel better soon Mel, you're just an amazing human being<3
thx mel i really appreciate you openly talking about how you are feeling. I am hating school at the moment I just want to cry when I go but it makes me feel better that feeling anxious and sad is ok and I can work through it, love you mel xxx
I NEED your chocolate 🙏🏻red wine recipe!!!!
Thank you so much for this video, Mel! I had THE worst day and hearing that I'm not the only one feeling like  this helped me soooo much.
i feel you! i usually get into a slump, where all i want to do is sit and  binge watch, but tthen i get anxious about the fact that i'm wwasting time when i could be doing something else, which adds to feeling down and it just feels like i'm digging myself a hole. but it always passes, i hope you'll feel a lot better!
Today I'm actually in a really nice mood. World Mental Health day kind of highlighted how far I've come since last year and while progress can seem slow it is happening, it has put me in a hopeful mood.
I personally have been lucky enough to regulate my hormones with the Pill. I've taken it since I was 14 (I had/have very bad acne), but I'm going off on it at the start of next year which is scaring me horrendeously. I'm undergoing a new treatment for my acne that will make the Pill pretty much unnecessary (in regards to my skin, obviously) and I'm terrified of not having the effects the Pill had for me in regards to my PMS and my period. The few times I went off the Pill in the past or wasn't on it when I was 12/13 I was in horrific pain and couldn't even get out of bed on some occassions. I'm really afraid to see what will happen next year. On the other hand, I've been dying to not have to rely on the Pill for so so long. I'm almost 27 now and I just don't want to have to spend money on it if I don't have to.
I absolutely know how you feel. During pms sure it gets worse but I do struggle with both anxiety and depression  as well. It's hard not to compare yourself  but with depression it's even harder to get out of that head space to be happy and healthy and carefree when your wallowing in misery
What liquid eyeliner do you use? That lipstick suits you so much!
You're definitely not alone on this! I suffer from really bad PMDD which i'm sure you've heard of but its just a more severe form of PMS and it consumes my whole life for like 4 days out of every month, gets pretty bad in terms of depression and overthinking and I can't get anything done, can't focus on anything, it affects my work life and my relationships and its just awful so i know EXACTLY how you feel. My only advice i can give you is to just let it happen, know that its only situational and just do small things that make you happy to try and get through it to the other side! You're a very strong woman so I know you can handle this!
I get really down round my period and start questioning my life decisions too! And crying over really minimal things and wondering if this is what I should be doing with my life etc. Completely okay! xxx
Aw Mel, even on your down days you make me smile. Thank you for doing what you do for us <3 p.s: I would love to see the red wine hot chocolate recipe!
I relate to this so much. I always need to have a target and a goal to obtain otherwise I get lost and unfocused and overthink. So now I make lists whenever I feel like I need it to motivate me and I make things for myself to do so I’m focused.
I'm watching  Laurel and Hardy to feel better, it helps, perhaps you should watch them aswel :-) nice video thnx for making it.
Your videos are so calming and cozy❤ +long or short hair you look beautiful anyway😁
Random, but I really love how you edit your videos!! Every time you do that thing where the audio keeps talking but you visually show your pauses it makes me so happy because it's so well done:D
I've always struggled with my periods, they've always been ridiculously heavy and leave me feeling really drained and I usually feel really sad in the lead up and throughout and it's annoying as some of my friends will have really light three day long periods, and their moods don't change and they can't understand why I'm so effected! I've been on pills to reduce the bleeding and always refused the actual Pill as I don't want hormones in my body but now I've been made to go on it as they think I have endometriosis, I'm really scared as I know how much my periods effect me, I don't want the pill to effect me loads too 😢
I feel ya, girl. Every fucking month, 1 week before my period starts, I get extra emotional. I cry watching The Voice, I cry thinking I procrastinate a lot and I'm not doing anything with my life, it's awful.. I honestly am tired to have this every month :(
My boyfriend is very understanding when it comes to periods but he still doesn't understand the full effect
I feel you sister! I was always a very busy person, worked a lot, had uni and other projects I was working on, etc. Since having my little girl I am limited in how much I can work and have not yet returned to uni. I am fully aware that having a little girly is so fulfilling and she does indeed take up so much of my time but I often get really down about the fact that I always had a goal I was working towards and was always so busy and now I find myself feeling as though I am no longer working towards anything. I am simultaneously the happiest I’ve ever been and the most lost. I find setting myself little projects helps, I crochet and cross stitch etc. But I completely understand where you are coming from here, and it’s nice to hear I’m not the only person who doesn’t really enjoy not having a lot to do! \nYou’ll find your content self again lovely lady, don’t let the bad days overshadow the good. Lots of love from my house to yours! 😘
Red wine and hot chocolate damn that sounds nice I used to drink coffee and cider my London friends didn't like it but I did must be the welsh in me
Love your honesty, love how you edited the video!\nSo awesome that you did this for world mental health day! You are so amazing Mel :) all the best
I totally understand how you're feeling. I'm in a place at the moment where i just cannot motivate myself to do anything and im feeling a bit empty and aimless because i have no goals to work towards and all i want is comfort and cuddles. My period is coming up too so it is probably hormone induced for me too but its bloody annoying... you're not alone ❤
OMG I have watched marley and me in cinema. I think that was year 2009 and i remember i've cried  a lot. I thought that me and my boyfriend are going to watch a fun comedy to laugh a bit  but no. What was even worst ,about 2 months earlier my parents had to put to sleep my dog that we had for 16 year. Damn You marley and me!
You are such an inspiration, you're doing more good than you think, Mel. When you're stressed or anxious or sad or angry, just think that it'll all pass with time. You know what to do, it's just getting around to it is the hurdle. BUT you did this video and that's amazing. I've been majorly struggling with balancing my PMS moods, general moods and little anxiety things like not letting shit get to me so easily. We're all trying and when we know what works for us, we keep going and we're NEVER alone. :)\n\nAlso, RED WINE HOT CHOCOLATE!? HELL YES!? We need to sit down for one of these some day.
Girl I feel you, I have the worst PMS. Physically but especially mentally. Kinda hate it but luckily other than that I am very healthy right now. Which I am grateful for! But those couple of days are tough sometimes!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE share the recipe for red wine hot chocolate!! That just sounds incredible. The copper mug is beautiful.\nI just realised that yesterday was world mental health awareness day and I was diagnosed with chronic depression yesterday. The irony....
The background of this video is so pretty 💛💛
I have been lucky not to have any mental health issue  ,however i had a family member and a friend ,whom suffered with  mental illnesses. I have immense empathy for  people ,who are dealing with mental health issues  ,you are all brave living your lives ,even though you feel like rolling up in a ball and not moving .
It's so strange, I feel exactly the same. I can't actually tell you what is wrong but I'm feeling very heavy (the best word to describe it). So today i didn't even go to uni. I stayed in bed and I'm taking the morning off. It's my mental health day and I'm trying to focus on myself now. I want to work through this and get better. (Plus yes, im also about to get my period and my  skin looks horrendous and it felling effects me). Hope you're having a good day today :) love you!
I just wanted to say how happy I am that your a YouTube. Your funny, relatable, truthful, smart, fashionable and more! Honestly, and I never think this about anyone..but goals😄 I hope you stay on yt forever💚
Mel we all lose our keys and find them in our pocket! Since I left uni I really struggle with fulfilment but I'm going to do some volunteering to fill that gap
Melanie, \nThank you for the abundance of joys and happiness that your delightful sharings bring. Your thoughts and warmth are always a present to your YouTube friends. I wish I could wrap you in the largest of hugs when you need them most. \nBe confident that you bring something special to those in your real and virtual worlds. \nThank you for sharing.
I get this, it's a lack of focus and a lack of purpose. When I'm not doing something I start to wonder why I'm here and I start thinking about all the bad things, but it's not all bad and in reality you'll have dips  because you can't constantly be doing something or you'll burn yourself out!
red wine hot chocolate?! pretty sure i NEED that in my life 😂
be careful with the crest strips, don't use them all the time, take breaks. When  I was in america for three months I used the crest 3d white toothpaste (not even the strips) but the toothpaste has hydrogen peroxide in it and for the first two months I felt fine. I now suffer consistently with really bad sensitivity in my eye tooth and nothing makes it go away!
It's EXACTLY the same thing for me at the moment, I feel sooo down and on the verge of tears everyday because of period hormons :(
red wine hot chocolate recipe, please!!!
Reilly concrete 👍

Melani Murphi really you are a lasbian ???
Hi Melanie, did you get your dental implant yet ? and if so where did you have it done ❤️
Why do live-action renditions of Batman pretty much always look really dopey when they're in the superhero costume
Whether this movie ends up being good or bad, I think it'll for sure be a fun ride. This trailer just screams fun, like DC was in the past. :) And, honestly,  who cares if it flops or gets horrid reviews? If you love it, that's all that matters. I have a feeling I'll really enjoy this movie.
i bet this film is better than thor raknarok!!!
Without Superman(Henry ) This Movie is nothing
that part where the ciborg catched aquaman and  threw him looks so fucking bad.not bad ass, just...bad

This wonder woman is the kin of girl u bring home to ur parents...
We don't need them, we only need Jesus Christ as our Saviour. Amen??
1:23 Is it just me, or does anybody else see Ben Affleck's lips shaped as the Bat?
really hope this has a good storyline too.
As soon as I heard man of steel theme...
God said in the koran(alquran) Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators. (Al mukminun 23:14)
Is that the Dothraki screamers at 1:11?
Superman oh wait it’s a dream -_-
Does flash's foot break at 1:50?
Today is my lucky day. Can I get 10000 likes. Pleasee.
I like the part where the Jewish child killer soldier try to act like the savior of the human race and americans call her wonder woman..
what's this song
What's the name of the song they use I this trailer? I was really feeling it for a second.
Try not to cry challenge 😭😭
Supes can't stay dead so will see
I like more Marvel to be honest....but this looks hella cool so imma like both sides
red and black flannel shirt - 2 superheroes wear it.   how sad.
Where is infinity war trail... oh wait wrong channel
Aquaman is just a sexier, slimmer, younger and a more attractive version of me.
https://youtu.be/r9-DM9uBtVI?t=3\n Make me remember to limpbizkit song :D
Why do they persist with Zach? Only reason this film will do good is because Joss took over at the end. Now here's an interview with Michael Jordan's ghost\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PGYoOya0l70
Fucking awesome, can't wait, then Start Wars. Awesome time to be a DC and Star Wars fanatic
chicks love my 6.5 inch dick
*Reasons why Justice League will be successful (if they at least have a decent storyline);*\n1. Justice League is the epitome of a superhero team up. The alpha team in comicbook history. This is not just a movie. It's a historic event.\n\n2. This movie builds up and ends on a triumphant note (different from Batman v Superman which was a movie about internal struggles with an atmosphere shrouded in angst) \n\n3. Rebirth of Superman (him largely missing in the marketing campaign will boost the level of anticipation, making his entry even more epic)\n\n4. It's not a copy of the first avengers movie and has it's own unique signature.\n\n5. Success of the Wonder Woman movie and the presence of Wonder Woman in this movie.\n\n6. Team dynamic looks great and will be a major selling point\n\n7. Seemingly menacing villain \n\n8. More Thermyscira and Amazonians for the Wonder Woman fanbase and the introduction to Atlantis (the underwater kingdom will be a unique cinematic experience)\n\n9. DCEU has a great track record with soundtracks and cinematography. These aspects will elevate the level of energy and epicness
Imagine a world where we get the best possible Superman Wonder Woman and Batman then put them in a faithfull yet original piece of cinematic art that is visually stunning and reminds us of a badass live adaption version of the show and comics we grew up with? Well we got it and it's right here its actually happening.
if only we had a god of war who fought other gods...... right Diana.... right?
Christian Bale was awesome as Batman! But when we say, 'RDJ does not play Iron Man, He is Iron Man.' In the same way I believe that, 'Ben Affleck Is Batman.' I mean the way he carries himself and he executes the role, he is way too relatable and suitable to Batman's role. Henry Cavill, in the same way is one of the best people Hollywood could have chosen to play Superman.
We can be heroes! Just for one day!\nI love that song so much and it's so fitting right here! xD
Rotten Tomatoes was exposed as being biased towards DC and it influenced the Internet to hate... This movie gonna be LIT AF.
I just don't get a genius detective vibe from Ben's Batman.
I waiting for this
If anyone is wondering what the song is, it's Gang of Youths cover of Heroes
I can't wait for the movie
Damn i love these actors !
Jason Momoa is totally enjoying the character .. one of the best cast assemble.
Anyone know why they picked cyborg over Martian manhunter
Wow they remixed David Bowie hero’s
wow

Meh
No one cares about this film. It's all about the Last Jedi this year.
I have seen better things coming out of a dog's rear-end than this shit film.
Over CGI
This gone be bad....damn shame...
I like how DC is starting to really compete with Marvel. Ever since Iron Man, Marvel has dominated even though DC had Nolan's Batman series. But clearly Marvel had a plan and a narrative in which they would carry out their universe over the next 10-20 years whereas DC wasnt really doing that much and they were almost non existent. Now that DC actually has a timeline and direction for the franchise Marvel will have to make sure they can stay on top. DC arent just focusing on Individual movies anymore, and Marvel is somewhat nearing the end of their own timeline. Now DC can focus on trying to take over and they have a good chance of doing it too.
Plot twist Darkseid's mother was also named Martha.
Would be great to see superman and green lantern in justice league 2
I dont remember it being so red during the fights from the previous trailers. Specially when WW jumps off the parademons from bat's car. I just hope it's not painful to the eyes when it reaches the theatre.🤗
it's sad to see that many people are saying that they're going to boycott this movie because of something that happened a decade ago...
I don't remember Aquaman ever being able to fly
2 questions,whitch  flash is that and who's playing him?

Ffs you bought shit,  you need fox or tld brand clothing
Find good matcjing gloves
Go to eBay for towbar
gumtree or ebay
Looking FRESH!  Yes lad.
Upgrade your rocker
Nice parking Harry lol
🌴
get a roof rack
No you haven't broken your ankle it's just in a cast 🙄
Dude I work for Land Rover @champagnejolag that's my insta DM me I'll hook it up
EVOC Back packs for the win every time !!
get  universal tow bar in have a range rover and it works excellent mate
Harry those 2 holes on you tow hitch are for the safety chains on a trailer. Incase a trailer comes off the tow hitch ball, the safety chains wiith hooks stay connected and insure the trailer doesn't go into on coming traffic, hit a person or a building etc. You want a tow hitch bike rack like this. It'll slide right in to the square receiver n fastened with a big pin ..... \n https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-Racks/Thule/TH990XT.html?feed=npn&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIofbev_jp1gIVQWSGCh1JkAubEAQYBCABEgKO2fD_BwE\nThule make good hitch racks. Hope this helps.
*HARRY hit up Cannock Chase!* Best place I've been to for Mountain Biking!!\nhttp://www.chasetrails.co.uk/
Doing sick bro keep up the good work
Harry, get the space brace for your ankles when you ride. They will save your ankles! Also help you get revived.
I am so glad harry is keeping it like his channel in stead of worrying about youtubes rules! Cheers!
you can purchase a bike rack that just sicks right into the square hole in the back.
its a bit shit mate, got to a mountain bike specific store and there get you the baller shit you need man!
That was one of the funniest vids I've ever seen!! Good start with the Enduro gear, just stay away from Spprts Direct next time. Have a ganders at Endura clothing on Chain Reactin Cycling.
Parking over two spaces like a twat
Harry!!!! You don’t need glasses bro, just bang on a sick set of goggles with your full face 😜
Why don't you get a roof rack for the bike
thumbs up for nandos (SA for the win)
There is a tow hitch already on it. Just removed that plastic blocking the hitch and you can use your bike rack.
the riding shorts are good  but maybe invest in better jerseys, those ones look like they are for cross country, also an enduro helmet would help.. For example ( troy lee designs A2 helmet) having longer shorts is better too,  the jacket is good.
for your towbar try Caravan and Camping/ towers in southport
You have a hitch on your Sport already mate.  All you need is a bike rack now, it will go right into the existing receiver.\n\nSomething line this would work https://www.roofbox.co.uk/scripts/rbvehsel4_tab.php/car-specific-accessories/buzz_rack_bb4_4_bike_wheel_support_rack_no_brp304/Qx%40w%2C6M42VAwp3%40Rb%7B~cC4ure5HXEB\n\nGood luck with the ankle and the date bro!
Nice little fear and loathing in Las Vegas look! Yesslad
Get a tld Jersey they're the best
Holy shit mate, i sprained my ankle on a second degree and y have a friend that hurt it 4th degree, and now you!, we were joking that hurting your ankle was the new trend. Its fkin nuts. What up with the global energy or wtf is going on, too many synchrinicities
A Thule should just slide right into that hitch that's already on your car. And I'd definitely get a neck brace for downhill riding. If you go head first into a tree without one you'll for sure fuck ur shit up.
The square in the middle is the tow hitch receiver...typically you'd slide a trailer hitch w/ ball mount in there to tow a trailer, but they make bike racks that slide right in there as well, similar to this  https://cdn1.static-tgdp.com/ui/productimages/approved/std.lang.all/90/45/t2_classic_wloc_9044_9045_sized_750x492.jpg
You already have a receiver hitch, which is the squareish opening back there, which is what all bike racks insert into anyways. Get a North Shore style rack or a tray rack. North Shore mounts the bikes so the sit vertically long ways. Tray rack they just sit by the wheels horizontally. North Shore rack would be my personal opinion any day as you can hold way more bikes and they don't extend out so bloody far, so they are sturdier and more compact so that you're less likely to back into things.
You already have a towing receiver. Just buy a bike rack that fits your (guessing) 2inch receiver.
Harry you need a hitch bike rack. You already have the hitch you just need the rack not a tow bar. US price is less than $100
get  full face helmet with the remove able chin piece there better for enduro type riding
Don’t get a Thule get a North shore rack they are much better
buy a thule bike rack or a roof rack for the MTB it will look steeazy and its not half that expensive
stretch the other side of your ankle.
check out the online store chain reaction cycles
You have a hitch receiver. Just get a 2 rack.  🤘
You should have gotten the TLD or FOX gear
Most hilarious video in a while or maybe I am just in a good mood.\nI feel Harry is back to having tonnes of fun and just doing things he loves!\n\nVery good to see my man, cannot wait to watch you shred some enduro in your new get up!
Go on chain reaction cycle if you want good deals on any mtb stuff
Hahahaha the ginger part. Sounded like u said shall I edit that hahahahahahah. Hilarious
I enjoy the mountain bike videos
your fucking quality man videos are sick.
for outdoor sports stuff go to decathlon if there is one near you not sports direct
Riding gear is right I'd just go to a local bike shop
hi harry i have some downhill trousers and a top you can have . the top is a large and the trouser are a small to medium they were only used a couple of times . they are in good nic. let me know if you want them
Check out the Bell Super 3R helmet. It's a half shell but has a chin bar that you can attach and detached. Means when your confidents goes up you can remove the chin bar.
Hope his ankles alright but him hitting that tree was fantastic 😂
I feel you pain. Always did my feet and ankles. In the end I just permanently rode with 661 ankle braces on. Made a big difference in pain management and feeling confident. You're totally killing it on the MTB by the way 👍
As an MTBer who did some homework, I recommend Osprey back/hydration packs, camelback is the big name but osprey are better thought out, Chain Reaction are a good start point, another top tip, join British Cycling for £20 2nd get 10% discount at CRC, have saved myself a fortune
Shimano do a great hydration pack and alterations or funkier clothing is good
any fox mtb clothing are the best, for winter I've just bought the fox downhill polar pants and a gore-tex waterproof jacket......best mtb gear purchases i have made! For a full face i suggest the POC Coron...rated for multiple impacts so you can crash it a lot and you'll survive
10:48 i lost my shit holy fuck that was funny xD
bro you should make your own cry down hill gear shoes the lot job will look sick
The central square hole under the bumper is the main armature part of a tow bar(the expensive bit!), you have the electrics fitted too (black plastic thing to the right of square with sprung lid!). I doubt that you have the plug in part with the hitch under the floor in the boot (it's too big to fit under the floor, old ones used to attach differently and fit under the floor). Go to LR Supermarket in Speke, they can sort you with the bit that's missing (I have the adjustable height removable bar on my RR) - also they sell Thule bike racks - the 'tilting' ones are recommended cos you can still open the boot with bikes on the rack!
Budget is best sometimes man ruin it re buy :)
For your enduro rides you should def get a pair of bib shorts. Basically a Lycra suspender shorts but it has a pad in and stops any chafing. \n\nIt took me years to start wearing them. It it's the best thing I ever did.
giro switchblade is a pretty good helmet for enduro and dh
Osprey hydration packs are really good I’ve had one for a year and it’s really good
Towbars are normally a few hundred quid. Just shop around at scrap metal places and stuff or CES or euro car parts. They will certainly have something for you
An easy way to remember what you need to do is called R.I.C.E.  R- rest I- ice C- compression & E- elevation. If you do that you’ll heal quicker.
Get roof bars fitted by a Land Rover specialist not Land Rover themselves and then get a roof rack for the bikes
You need to get a ute to put your bikes on the back
Why don't you get someone to fabricate one lad
I sprained my ankle really badly and wrapped it up tight to stop it flopping about when on crutches. Turns out it's not the best thing to do according to NHS
And there is a channel on YouTube callGMBN that is all about mountain biking and everything you need to know when you are starting off
Such an expensive vehicle I would go the dealer to get the tow Barr
Come subscribe to my Chanel new to youtube would like your support I do biking vids
As a mountain biker I am loving this shizzz!
i'd recommend the fox proframe helmet, it's lite and cool enough to just wear all the time but it's full face. i have one and its sick! or the bell one with the removable chin piece.
Those two holes are for the safety chains.
What size bike should I get I'm 57
Should've put trophy wife on your inner corner !
Does the maybelline fit me loose powder have flash back????
This is gorgeous!! For a video recommendation could u please do a natural warm toned everyday makeup look, just very natural and cute :3

Dude did you do your research on Fenty beauty and how to use the products? All her powder highlighter are called Killawatt. The duos have the shade names on the bottom & on the box it comes in. This was a half ass  review.

Love your suede jacket 🌷
Aviator jacket camel jumper and green cardigan are gorgeous. You have lovely style suzie x
I love scarves!!! I'm obsessed with them! 🙈
Great haul!💖👌

where your earrings from?
Love the cardigans
Happy birthday
pls do more zara haul!!! ♥️
Omg I love the cardigans!!!
Looove the cream cardigan 😍
Love your try on hauls 💚 saludos desde Argentina! 💚😘
You're so beaut! Thanks for sharing your haul!
Hi Suzie, Love your video. Thank you. Please can you share where your jeans are from? They are lovely!! Xx
Those jeans ! Where is it from ??? 😍 your body👌
Her youtube channel is called helloOctoberxo...?
loved this haul! recently did a little shopping at Zara as well! :)
My faves were the grey and camel scarf, and the camel jumper! Oh and the cream cardigan😍🙋💛Been looking for one like that for a while! 💖💖
loved so many items! Why have I decided to go capsule wardrobe 😩
How tall are you?
Where are your earrings from, love them!
How did you make your thumbnail where you cut yourself out with the white bit around you? Xx
Hello October, you've come round so quickly! 🍁
Does anyone know where her gold choker is from? Been looking for it forever xx
Really like this makeup look, I know you said the lipstick is discontinued but I'd love a tutorial of the whole look
Looove those scarves!! I picked a couple up last year and after using the soft ones I couldn't go back to any of my other ones... also, can you link us your jewelry pieces?!
I love the font you use on your thumbnails! What is it called?
Who knows where to find the short necklace that she is wearing? Please?)
good call on the aviator jacket - you're right .. its the perfect length on you! lovely haul - love you!!
where are your earrings from? i love them!!
Oh my I LOVED every single thing in this haul 😍💜
Paused the video to buy the red sweater with the bow. 😂
Love the green cardigan and the suede jacket best.  I love the pink jumper contrasted with the black tie (very Chanel) but I would return since it has pulls in it.
that first grey scarf looks amazing on you! especially with your hair and makeup like that. so pretty <3
You can poke the pulled thread through the jumper (just stretch it a little bit where it's pulled-you will be able to poke it through one of the holes and pull it through from the inside). I have 2 cats I have to do it all the time!
LOVE LOVE LOVE everything from this haul. I'm a short arse too and I need that aviator jacket it's perfect. 👌 Where are you jeans from you're wearing in the cut away frames? Xx
Number 14 on trending eeeek!!!! Loved this haul, but my bank account did not 😂 love the olive tones and that scarf is lovely 😍
Hey Suzi , just wondering what hairdresser you go to ..? :) loved the haul. Knew you would kill it with an autumn haul. The aviator jacket is sooo flattering on you 😍😍
could you tell me what jeans you are wearing???
Very good video!but i cannot opeen the links!i want to buy firectly things i have got iphone6 and when i cleek on them it goes to a blank page whatever video i  see!can u help?thnk u!
girl im buying every single jumper, cardigans, scarves, and that suede jacket yesssss I love all of them so cosy and pretty and pretty much my style for every autumn and winter season cause dang its cold up here in the north of america 😅☁️🌧🌨🌦☔️
everything is beautiful.. also  the last coat..
That olive cardigan is absolute GOALS! It looks so soft and cozy, which is a must have for the fall! 😍🍂
Where are the white drawers behind you from please?
How tall are you? It would just be helpful in relation to sizing :)
I have the same faux suede jacket and I am soo happy with it! It's so worth buying. Love your hauls, especially Zara ones!!!!😍
Use a bobbypin to fix the snag in your jumper!
Your hair colour is just so nice :D
Everything looks amazing and suits so well! Except I agree that the “cape style” coat at the end doesn’t sit as well as the other pieces.
What lipstick are you wearing? It look amazing on you!! xoxo
When u wear the cuffs over your hands!!! 🙈
I got the same jacket but in pink xD
tha aviator jacket looks so perfect on you !!!! i love ur videos !
Love your style..more of hauls.. I just added everything in wishlist 😍😍💗
Fell in love with your earrings, where are they from? <3
That leather jacket you're wearing when showing the beanie!! Where is it from I've been after a jacket like that!!
I'm sooo gold you said that about jumpers being tight at the bottom and that they're not as flattering. All the jumpers I have that I love are loose and I was just about to get a tight one on ASOS. Ta!  Haha
So jealous that you can wear scarves and sweaters already, we’re still waiting for the cold in New York 😭
These videos are my favourite! Try on hauls are the best.
I bought the cape coat but returned it because it was just too thin. For the money I didn’t think it was worth it. Also didn’t have any washing instructions in it 🙈
I just ordered the oversize cardigan in gray. It will be perfect for when I fly to New Zealand in February. I had to limit my self, but wanted to buy everything in this haul💕
Ohhh so nice! Girl three bags for your birthday- you don't need to justify yourself! Love love love xxx
The grey hat. Love it.
Love the cardigans and herringbone grey /beige scarf, I love the bat wing coat on you, will be best when it's really cold as it looks roomy and big enough to wear a thick jumper underneath and still button it up. Your style is so good Susie X ❤️👍🏻💕
Makeup tut on this look please
Loving all of your haul, love a good knit recently!!! The Zara aviator is in fact £25.99 😱😱😱😱😱 so a Brucey bargain rather than £50 as you quoted, I bought one in mustard yellow and it also comes in a pink 😍😍😍😍😍 I’m in love
I am happy for you, my Zara basket is filled with amazing items, but I live in Louisiana, so I haven't ever worn the clothes I got last year ☹️, I am still tempted to get a couple
Love your videos. What is the lipstick you are wearing? It's lovely and really suits you xx
Top haul. I have recently become obsessed with Zara this season. I recently bought an insane pale pink and faux fur sweater with huuuge balloon sleeves. It's life. I LOVE it.
Great video! You got so many cute clothes!! I have a small channel that I am really trying to grow. I would be super grateful if anyone could go check it out!💜
We have the same aviator jacket 😬 I love it! It's so warm. Looks great on you x
I bought the same sweaters in the exactly same colors😂
What jeans are you wearing?
Stupid little puppy claws... seriously disappointing?
Where are your jeans from? x
To be honest I'll never get why anyone would consider something 'high quality' when it's literally made up of only plasticy synthetic fibers like acrylic that will look terrible after a year of wearing...
Do you actually try things on in store?
Love the aviator jacket! Your fashion content is so nice to watch :) xx
I want that camel jumper on you so much but it’s out of stock :’(
Zara is life! Love these pieces!
Where are your earrings from?
actually, I think the cape is really cute. It's really stylish and fashionable.
I have the red jumper with the bow except In cream, but it's gone so bobbly already even though I haven't washed it. Does anyone know how I can save it? So sad it looks so old and worn :(
You're looking good, girl!🙌🏻 Cute Haul!!!
Don’t keep the pink jumper with the black bow doesn’t really look cute and it kinda makes you look wide and hides your figure ✨
Where is this lipstick from? :)
I love everything omg!\n\nAlso, I personally really like long cardigans and I think this one looks lovely on you! However, if your looking for a shorter alternative, check out the cream one Zoella got from ASOS​ in her latest haul. It looks so cosy, but I also think it is the perfect length for what your looking for xx
What lipstick are you wearing PLEASE TELL US xxx
Please stop looking into the viewfinder so much.
I just want subs
Youtube made me buy it...so I now got the beige scarf, thanks Suzie ;-). I'd totally be in favour of a Bag Collection video :-)
Love this zara haul would love to see more of these
Love these type of videos with try ons!Also love the scarves.Liked them all from the start on your youtube vlogs!
Please comment like and subscribe
I wonder why he didn't comment? Maybe he just wanted to focus on why he was there. Hey just realised that is Harvey Weinstein! He has his own shit to deal with right now.

Me: *googles* how many eyes do spiders have\nGoogle: Most spiders have eight eyes. Some have no eyes and others have as many as 12 eyes. Most can detect only between light and dark, while others have well-developed vision.\nMe: .......THAT'S RIGHT! MY SPIDER IS NOT LIKE MOST SPIDERS IT'S DIFFERENT AND HAS 4 FUCKING EYES.

Could you use heavy duty double sided tape on the legs and skip thed hot glue?
Can you guys try doll faceup =))) That's freaking amazing, how about a holo witch doll? :v
Can u put that on ur front lawn for a day and record people's reactions? 😂😂😂
https://www.facebook.com/FirstMediaBlossom/videos/10155867319889586/\n\nNeed to do this
Would've loved to be a fly on the wall when he comes home and the god damned spider is just...sitting there...waiting.... lol, also Corrine? Hot glue also comes in frigging ROPES sweetheart. Yeah, that's right, ROPES. You stick the end of a coil into your glue gun and your set for another twelve aragog sized spiders!
I dont think she could get it down the stairs thats why its over the balcony
That looks really awesome! Especially on the front yard. Except where the fuck do you store that the other 11 months of the year? It needs its own fucken garage!!
I want to see robs reaction
Corrine is so fucking beautiful, oml I can't <3
Your spider doesn't have any mantables
Spirit Halloween store should also carry a Giant Spider Decor that could've been used as a base skeletal structure and fabric for the spider
This is awesome! I want one
Corrine, pls do gelatin art cake! It's so artsy, pretty and challenging!
One thing you should look into Corrine is jello flower art been seeing it around and suggest you take a whack at it!!!
You guys should try French Toast Hamburgers. My family tried them and it was good. Just out a burger patty and cheese between French Toast pieces.
CORRINE CORRINE!!! of you still have left over supplies, you can make the pincers that go on her face!! Like Aragog!!!!!
omg this is so cool! you must have put a lot of time into it!
Aka this video is cool
Corinne! Corinne! ... can you please make Water Candles?
Corinne you should do a mandrake!
It turned out really nice!
i really wanted to see rob to get scared by it\nlol i thought it was gonna happen
Please please please react to your old videos
you should do a mini aragog
You made this on my birthday
if you're just covering it in fabric anyway why do you have to tape the whole thing?
Thats truely a master piece! Amazing! Question how many rolls of electrical tape did you use?! I also need to get my hands on a huge hotglue gun like that!
Pause it at 1:09 you can see her zip code (28801)
If u heated up the knife or saw cutter, it would cut the foam more smoother...
What's that app she uses that has Harry Potter read to her?
Nooo I wanted to see rob react to this
That is si dope to be honest lol
wow my mind is blown! Great job Corinne!!!
Nooo I wanted to see rob's reaction!
I don't understand why does everyone tell me that watching threadbanger is bad because I'm 11yrs old 😒🙅
To be honest im shitscared of spiders but this shit is pretty fucken dope
Corinne, I will join you in the celebration of Harry Potter!
since ur outta ideas how about drunk as fuck pintrest... my drunk kitchen was great till she got sponsered and became a whoretuba and paint a pumpkin
I give up girl you are definitely the queen of Harry Potter! Just saw HP world yesterday for the first time and cried when I saw the castle...the feels were real!! 😭 but seriously Someone needs to give you a golden snitch crown or something! 👑👑👑
god how long did that take
it was so cute when you pet the spider AHH
What is kitty's favorite hp  book/movie?
Can you make paper soap??

3:26?
I liked the part where Kylo Ren tells Rey, Wow you are The Last Jedi. Sorry I killed your dad, Luke Skywalker.
I think it's just a space band-aid on his face
How funny, you are silly, and cute, but a little silly, I think I mentioned that already, not sure I trust those porgs though, what someone else called an egguin, a term I like, but I can't wait to see the movie, mesh scars and all, force be with you.
Jenny, is your left sleeve okay?
God I hate you
I thought it was a space band-aid
i do not do reaction
Your mother has a screw in her leg?  She is more machine now, than mother. Twisted and evil.
Your reaction was cool, seriously. But Tyrone Magnus was better ijs
That stuff is not under Kylos skin I don’t think. It looks likes a band aid almost
It's not fun watching someone complain about entertainment
Make a video about  Andy Signore.
If you really want to see cringe reactions in their purest form, type ComicBookCast2 trailer reactions. The guy who does those reactions is like Tommy Wiseau of trailer reactions.
It baffles my mind people watch this...
You are so perfect, and I would, still, say that if I could only hear you on the radio,...... or something stupid like that.
who cares if he has a gold robe? What's the big deal? What's to dislike? It may be part of his character development. Who cares. The nitpicking about every little thing is getting to the point that I just can't watch this type of crap anymore. There's NOTHING of value in these videos. Just people doing absolutely nothing, saying absolutely nothing, talking shit about things they'll never come close to accomplishing themselves and so what the fuck is the point? You watched a trailer that we also watched, wow, guess we need a video about it? What's going on in the world? Why are we all choosing entertainment that's duller, less interesting, has less substance and doesn't bring anything new to anything. That's our world today. Watching people watch other videos and then bitch about them. WTF!?
I love the Porgs too
I was a huge fan of the part when the Porg opened up his mask only to reveal another Porg saying, Now, I am The Last Jedi.
I assumed it was a bacti strip to accelerate healing and minimize scarring. If that's the case, then he's obviously wearing it at the beginning of the movie, which is when I think the space battles take place.
If Luke and Anakin can get robot hands that look like normal hands why can't kylo ren get his scar repaired or pull a handsome Jack and have a hologram over it
She is so weird and awkward...yet I still want to bang her.
I HAVE SCREWS IN MY LEG, TOO!!
Yippee, another star wars movie. I can't wait to be disappointed by another average movie hyped to infinity.
Are you underage, why all the fluffy toys?
I can't find last week's millennial falcon. when are you gonna release it Jenny?
The Porg marketing for children is clearly working.
I would be very interested to see your analysis of the Steven Moffat era of Doctor Who, if that's something you are familiar with. Although it may be too much of a complete mess to even attempt analyzing...
PLEASE MAKE OUT WITH THE PORG ON YOUR NEXT VIDEO!
The whole flick is a comedy!
I got mad 'Goldmember' vibes on Snoke when i paused it on him by chance, I love GOOLLLLLLDDD came to mind.
Jenny is the antithesis of Mike Zeroh.
Btw this looks like a cam girl room... from what I've heard from other ppls experiences 😂
Im a pretty anime fox :D
Kylo's scar is awesome. I think of it as part of this recurring thing where being sith = becoming a cyborg. But he's this kinda young modern sith with nice hair so instead of getting an iron lung suit or robot spider legs he's got this kind of low-key brillo-patch on his ronin face cut.
BB-9e will most likely be in the actual movie this time due to how much they have promoted him outside of the toy market, including animated shorts.
Can you hold up the porg next to your face, there's a similarity!\n\nI thought that Kylo was just wearing a sticky plaster with little TIE fighters on it.
Is comedic genius in your genes? You never fail to crack me up, and I'm as cynical as it gets. You rock, Jenny.
This was the worst Last Jedi trailer reaction, which makes it...Awesome. You rock Jenny!
She reminds me of the babysitter from The Incredibles.
If I wrote the new trilogy I would see the OT events as WW1 and this new one as WW2. The Empire being Nazi Germany. \n\nStar Wars would be like basically what would happen if humanity colonized most of the galaxy 1000 years ago and the the events shown in the movies are the 20th century but set against the whole galaxy background not just earth.
It's not there the whole time.
I'm thinking that's going to be the same question most people will have when they walk out of the theater for ep8, too. Was Rose even in this? On the other hand we probably wont, because no one really cares.
So why did Luke (nor anybody else) not go after the punk and kill or capture him after he killed all the trainees?  Nope.  Luke just turned into a pussy and went into hiding for 30 years? Where were all the ghosts of Yoda, Obi Wan or whatever couldn't have been there to warn Luke when the danger was there?  Was Luke just the only Jedi training and running that center?
I like this video! You do sound more honest than the majority out there, and the part that you laughed because of how Snoke looks made me smile. :)
your poor boyfriend, his eyes must hurt all the time. ;)
One theory I don't see anyone talking about online the I believe the trailer confirms is that Kylo has an oedipus complex. He killed his father and then he goes right after his mother! Star wars is based on mythology so this must be what happens! #Leilo #KyLeia
You are amazingly awkward...it's very engaging for a channel, good job.
omg I don't know what is cuter you or the porg plushie :O I WANT THAT PLUSH!
You’re my new favorite person. I’m really animated when reacting to trailers. I literally threw my shoe across the room when it showed Kylo’s hand on the trigger. Then I screamed at the tv, “OMG! Are they going to show Kylo?” Before full on pterodactyl screeching and shouting, “I KNEW IT!!!!” There were other people in the room. We’re all atheists, but I’m pretty sure they wanted to call the exorcist.
I know this chick is trying to be funny but um, yea.
Yes, trailer reactions are silly. But they make sense in internet nerd-town - what are they if not an excuse to add more 'content' to a thinly-veiled vanity channel and just blurt 'I LOVE THIS' and 'I HATE THIS', trying to impress upon the world nothing opinions, vaporware inner-ramblings, piggy-backing search engines, and overdocumenting every single dribble and fart, to the point where you can no longer discern things of merit and value?\n\n Which is funny.
You are just TOO COOL!! \n\nHOW can anyone else even STRIVE to attain your level of COOLNESS?! \n\n\nKeep being humble chick!! 👍
think they won’t say porg in the movie as a call back to not saying Ewok?
Oh no i don't want poe to be evil :((((
Is this comment section replacing Red Letter Media's comment section?
hey jenny are you single?
You nailed it on Snoke!  Hard to take seriously!
I like your Kylo Ren doll. I especially like his Rey T shirt!
Well I guess I was overreacting when I watched it cuz I was HYPE. I try not to over hype these movies too much but i love the fuck out of Star Wars. So yeah I did screech like a retard when I saw Snoke and Luke.
+Jenny-- I haven't watched yet. Click, pause, this comment. You are my only star wars source. Stworce. (Tm) the other pre tenders, see that?, get confused with the Schwartz, and muck it up.  You rock in galaxys near and far, times past and time not yet from now. Now i'll watch.  See? Rea's swim qualifier. Boom!   I'm dead serious Stworce is TM. You may borrow it with blessings.  Ps, Who is playing Snoke? Larry Hagman?  Or playdoe and CGI?
You bring back my faith that there still are some normal star wars fans out there. Thank you.
She needs long black pipe
Jenny: “All of this stuff is obsolete. Why did I buy any of this?!”\nMe: Because your a fan, and a nerd. Doesn’t matter which you are, because the good ones always support the stuff they like. And you are clearly doing that.
I like how she obsessed over a tiny detail no one else noticed.
Kylo's face mesh is gone at the end of the trailer, So it was either for healing or it was a piece of flare he was wearing to feel tough.
Is it me or does Jenny keep getting more beautiful? Anyway, great video. The commentary was on point.
Oh wtf, haven't watched in a while.\nShe blew up!
I thought the mesh on Kylo Ren's face was more of like a bandaid that covers the burn until it's healed, then it's removed. Not stuck under the scar.
He got his synth skin at the Emperor Palpatine Surgical Reconstruction Center™
Dang it Jenny, you had to point out that Poe is on the bad guy side and now that's gonna bother me until December!!!!!!
You are special 💗
Reaction starts at Never:Clickbait
LOL
The black thing on the scar is probably a way to heal it.\n\nHe will probzmably wear it only in the beginning of the movie
AT-ST!\nAT-ST!\nAT-ST!\nAT-ST!\nAT-ST!\n\nIT BROKE NEW GROUND!!!!!
0:30 A teen's first attempt at finding the g-spot.
What do you mean no reactions anymore to new Star Wars trailers!! 🤔 ... Another 2 months 🤣 ... and then ... 🎫😂
Noticed how Rey looks so awkward swinging a lightsaber! I think a lightsaber has no weight, they probably realized this w the originals and created that ball to shoot lasers at Luke so he wouldn’t look retarded.
I think it's a dark side band aid.
You guys know that carbon fibre was over his scar right? It's not prosthetic, it's probably a band-aid. you can see scenes with just a scar on his face in the same trailer.
Why were you fondling poor Porgs eyes while watching it!!!
Only channel that makes sense to me xP
#PorgLife
I didnt know they made Porg vibrators.
Mark Hamill resents your comments about face reconstruction.
Disco Snoke lol
It was bandaid
Aye we got the same laptop lmao
6:57
jenny your fricking amazing :)
Also quit Shitting on trailer reactions. People like the crew at Blind Wave, for instance,  work very hard on their content, know their stuff, are intelligent, and their responses show this. People want to see fans like THEM react to things they are equally fans of, as well as hear their subsequent opinons on the matter. Your invalidation of this is very narrow.
The only The Last Jedi Trailer Reaction you need.. *to avoid*
why does ray have a british accent it's kind of undignified
Wonder what Andy made her do to get her show. Didn't like it I guess with a lot of other people no season 2. Don't like her condescending attitude
hmm...mighta been best that this video wasn't done.  But then I did enjoy the Kylo Ren with Rey shirt on.
Yeah! The Production Designers, creators, writers, and Director thought it would be a great idea to have the mesh scar thing to... challenge cosplayers??? In the last movie he had his face sliced in half... like deep deeeep cuts. Thats just a space band-aid, Im sure it wont last more than one scene.
How come I never have nice ladies like you who enjoy Star Wars in my life?  LOL
Wow. This is pretty obnoxious.
God you're obnoxious
I feel like I'm the only person to just say meh to the recent trailer lol
Matt, I am sure you can come up with an imperfect approximation to a ball made all with hexagons and we'll call it The Parker Ball.
Perhaps the street signs are incorrect in _Euclidean_ geometry, but here in the real world we use _Minkowski_ geometry. Can you make a sphere out of hexagons in Minkowski space?
That was an interesting video!  At first, I thought, Who cares?  But, then when I thought about it and how you only wanted the newly made signs updated, I realized it does matter enough to correctly display football images on newly made signs.  Way to go, I hope you get your petition positively recognized.  I cannot sign anything since the only part of me that is UK is long past ancestry.
Petition to make him pronounce hexagon correctly
It's a Parker soccer ball, it's valid in Parker geometrical spaces
Undoubtedly a serious problem. Now all we have to fix is all those arrows pointing to the sky. Am sick of getting misdirected into space. It really messes up my day.
Just did it don't even like football but if its 3D will look 10 times better
Am I crazy or does he have an australian accent?
*What is the music that you use at the end of this video?*
I don't see any footballs, hexagins, or pentagins - only soccer balls, hexagons, and pentagons.
Will there be a petition to change the airplane icon too? A plane wont fly without engines.
Wow, my Dad told me about this a couple of days ago... I should have know you were behind it!! Haha

A ball made entirely of hexagons is known as a Parker Ball
Why not just get rid of all footyball nonsense in public entirely? It is a paupers game.
The ball at the Etihad stadium is stuck to David Silva's foot
This clearly shows that math and sports do not like to mix.
I'm not British but I do reside in this country for many years, still I don't know how important this can be for a UK born person and football fan. ? who cares about the geometry when it comes to UK road signs symbols ? everybody knows what this means so why changing it ?\n\nI  think it's a waste of TAX PAYERS MONEY and Money is needed right now in this country.
I will not let you pronunciation of Hexagon slide <3
If you look at the petition map, you can find the UK universities pretty easily.\nhttp://petitionmap.unboxedconsulting.com/?petition=202305
I am neither  not citizen of nor resident in the UK, but I'm willing to move just to help the cause
Who cares, it's a small meaningless change... also will the government listen to a petition and then waste money on useless sign changes
The zoo sign is also wrong!  Elephants' trunks always curl in, not out!
and where is the mathematics of a real football?\nhow many possible shapes can you combine to make a succesful football?
This is like saying the size and proportion of a castle sign is wrong we mist change it
Yah, but then you can round the hexigon, gcd lcm, so 6 into 5, 30.  You cant easily use 15 without a cooly ball.  But why not?  In 1995, they had advanced materials, whirly tennis balls, you could play tennis in the rain.  It was so bouncy and aerodynamic that you could dip legendary shots, in the rain.  Man that was cool because any old man with wilson whites wasnt anywhere, just your marine core tennis pals. LOL! The ball was fusia, neon, and indigo ripple like a racquet ball, but hat slight overweight and under pressure with poly fillament that grabbed the air, discontinued in 2001 due to cannibals?  I was mad one time, and i realized baseball,  Take a ball because my bat blows smoke?  Upper cut a top spin into the short stop hitting the grass square negative curl for a frack your mom douglas serve koopa troopa.  So it stands to reason that whirly cleats with ankle 400 lbs skocks an d carbide teath are so supperior that nobody could beat and defeat them.  So we learned in 1993 how to compound with a caroitoid lever for acceleration.
Speaking as an American, I envy you that this is the worst of your mathematical problems.  8)
You've got too much time on your hands!
Alright then, The sign for roadworks needs changing because not all road workers are Black.
I totally agree! In norway, feminists got through to change all the old pedestrian crossing signs to a unisex silhouette of a person crossing, than the old man with a hat-silhouette. This cost Norway about 80m NOK, which is a bit less than 8m GBP. Crazy!\nI do agree that it was poorly designed, back in the 70's, but lets update the symbol, so all new signs get updated, and use those 80m NOK a bit more sensible.
its a road sign... its not really that significant
THIS HAS BUGGED ME FOR YEARS, and I'm glad you noticed too.
Brilliant way to make geometry cool.\n\nMy man! \n(JL trailer reference)
Do we really want to use tax money to change these
I don't know about the castle, I'll need to hear Shadiversity opinion on that.
i bet you can use a infinite flat surface as a ball as long you are playing on a hyperbolic plane..
I think it's of hexagons because you don't need to distort them on 2d space so it was easier to create lol Britons are lazy.
What about the airport arrivals signs? You can't land a plane with the nose pointing down!
Let's waste tax payers money to make a nice signs that we don't need... Let's instead not.
I'm not allowed to sign because I'm not from the UK, but I would if I was.
national embarrassment... says someone whose country nearly got knocked out of wc qualifying by SYRIA
Lets just say your campaign works....what a waste of parliamentary time. theresa-  lets discuss wage increases for the nhs, oh no theresa we have a much more important issue to do with pentagons and road signs jesus to think people have time to waste like this lmao what is the world coming to...spend your time partitioning for something that may save a life or help people. Sorry Sheldon but what a waste of resouces. Yours sincerley,\nAngumentitive Arnold
*clicks on video*\nO Shit, I know where that is! I now feel almost famous by association - I used to get all my school supplies in the staples just along that road
first world's problem
Good to know.\nBut not worth starting a petition over.
Not cool changing the sign like that just for a video. Someone could have gotten into an accident. I'm flagging this video for dangerous acts.
There are enough views on this video for the bar to be full of petitions but some people are just too lazy
Looks like we have ourselves a case of Parker Football geometry
I’m from the US but you best know I still signed this
Not something very important to be done in my opinion
I started thinking that this was a triviality. But you convinced me that it might help with math awareness and costs little.  Alas, am a landlocked USian without British acquaintances. But I liked your video. Good luck.
If the petition gets 100,000 it will be considered for debate in parliament
Is it just him or that how people in Britain pronounce hexagon and pentagon?
This guy is such a gorby who tf will sign his petition
UK government be like\n\n\nWho's this hate letter from\n\nIt's the same guy as last week\n\nOhh now it's footballs ant it??\n\nYep\n\nWell,,,,,, just walks away angry
It looks like a circle of someone's bathroom tiles
That's a Parker football.
3:40  ...and a very proud tradition in mathematics....   Gotcha!  I knew one day your maths would slip and you'd realize the truth of the Yankee way!  Mathematics FTW!
Man! I don't live in the UK....
I thought this was going to be about directing traffic through a deliberately convoluted route to control traffic flow, but this was a nice surprise
I guess this is why democracy matters.
Perhaps they don't match because they are trying to represent a 3D shape in 2 dimensions? I imagine that if you take a 2D image of the correct shape you describe, it's not actually going to improve the level of recognition that is important for signage
This guy needs to get a life... I’m sorry but he just does
Signed... Let's push for 100k to be considered for debate in parliament...
he’s like that one maths teacher that you have in school that tries to make maths relevant in real life but it’s just bullshit anyway
*DON'T  YOU  HAVE  SOMETHING  ELSE  TO  DO??*
Almost 15k signatures so far. Wouldn't it be awesome to get to 100k so they have to bring it up in parliament
I saw this at the show in Warwick on Friday! Hope it gets to 10k
Could the ball have hexagons on one side (visible in the sign), and other polygons on the other side, and still be a ball?\n Instinctively I sense no, but can we prove that it is not possible?
I really hope they waste lots of money replacing all those signs. Nothing better to spend it on, well done, we need more like you 👍
I’m more concerned about the colour of the balls. The light hexagons are greater in number projecting white privilege.
The fact that nearly 15,000 people have gone out of their way to change road signs makes me proud to be British xD
When I lived in the UK I always appreciated the accurate graphics on the road signs, you always knew when you were coming up on a man shaking out an umbrella.
As important as the change in road sign is, my first thought was that they've finally finished that bloody bus lane!
What a load of balls. In a good way. You've got my signature!
That's not even a football! A real football is a prolate spheroid, usually colored (or coloured) brown. What you're talking about is a soccer ball.
Will never look at my sign the same way again.
Something similar happened at the company I work for.  We make geographic information systems so marketing asked a graphic designer to put a globe in some of our marketing material.  It was a complete mess and would have been an embarrassment if any geography nerds (As in a significant portion of our customers and potential hires) had seen it.  Thankfully some of us outside marketing got to see it early enough to fix it and the globe ended up being drawn correctly.
You have to much time on your hands mate
Please sign our petition to put pentagrams on road signs!\nThank you.\n— Devil worshippers of Britain
A well run democracy depends on public participation. Nothing is so small that it should not be fixed.
This level of extra is refreshing :')
So you've basically made football to do with maths.
For one very narrow definition of better. XD
Signed, at the moment there are over 14k signatures
And i thought people could not get any more obsessed with soccor \nUgh I hate soccor so boring \nI prefer motocross or skateboarding or any other exetreme sport
Why don't you call it a Parker sign if it's wrong
I'm a Yank, so I can't sign the petition. Great video and I hope that your petition is a success.
Wtf have I just watched
Icons aren't meant to be real, they are meant to be easy to see and quickly to be recognisable. – Signs don't use photorealistic iconography of other things like cars, lorries, trees, because that would make it not stand out. – Would a pentagon-hexagon ball be easier to see then a solely hexagon ball?
You're at 15k. Congrats.
Who cares?
NERRRRRRDDD!!!!!!!!!!
Does it matter
OMG get this twit off YouTube!
Make smoke smoothing. Chill out man
priapian
Parker ball
Signed ;)

The highlighter looks amazing on you, and the fact that it stayed for 10 hours is amazing because I feel like it is the first thing that comes off on me!
8/10, probably would bang
I usually just actually just jizz it on my chest. 😂😂😂😂  CRYING! I love you Chloe.
I actually can’t believe the products that you gurus get. It’s amazing they can afford to send everyone of the colors to all of you and charge the public a fortune 🔮 for them. I know it sounds like jealousy but it’s actually thinking they are dumb as hell. You guys don’t even use most of them. They lose a lot there but get it back from us. You guys can’t say it’s for your kit because you don’t do other peoples makeup anymore. It’s just yourself. I think you guys should start doing other people. It would be interesting. Still love all your videos. Not against you. You can’t help it but you should do more giveaways for colors you can’t use. I’ll take whatever. 😉 hehe
Can you do a tutorial on this hairstyle please?! It's gorgeous xx
You look so stunning at the end of the video!
You look beautiful Chloe! Can you review the new Galaxy collection by Fenty beauty ?
Was waiting for this babes!! ❤️
Just the tip of the Iceberg, how low have we allowed ourselves to sink? Homeless Vets on OUR Streets, Homeless full stop! Corrupt Governments, a Cataclysm of staged attacks, Women & Children dying every day, needlessly, while you pander your own Narcissistic Ego, mind boggling, how dumbed down you have allowed yourselves to become. Satisfied with your material fallacies! Keep watching your scrying mirrors, keep swallowing your Blue Pills. Makes me ashamed to be part of the same Race.
OMG I think she got married already
*Fenty Beauty is here to stay* #MoneyMoves *When Rihanna became a world star successful artist, award winning Fashion designer and now makeup*
I didn't like rihanna either at first. Actually I'm still not her biggest fan, but I can appreciate her and the effort she puts in her make up line
Woah it looks terrible at the end. I honestly hated all the products i tried from the fenty line specially the foundation. I returned everything

You make putting on makeup so easy. I really want to try fenti but the closest stockist is in Gold Coast (I am in Townsville) and I need to try the shades. I always get scared when people put on the contour creams but they look so good when you blend them out. Maybe I should try them
Wow Chloe you look so happy in this vid 😊🤗
Does anyone ever notice that she looks like Candice Victore Secret & Kendall jenner ??
Love your hair!! The final result of your makeup is stunning. Sexy af👍
I really loved your energy in this video! A++\nAlso, your hair. Amazeballs. xx

9 months use by for the killawatt highlighters that's way too short should be a year, the modern renaissance had a 6 months use by which is even worse.
Can you do a toot on your eye make up, pretty please

YOUTUBE STOP FREEZING THE VIEWS PLEASE 🙏😥😢
5mins but the views moves only for 2 digits wtf
7 men in white costume 😍
*We actually improve so many thing about this comeback,  like korean chart, album sales,  yes our youtube views is decreasing compared to NEVER EVER,  but the like and comments is lots,  mean our fandoms is keep bigger,we trending in many country, itunes no1 in 17 country, and many youtube trending,  i think many of ahgases help stream in korea site, that why youtube views not that fast we make it NAVER, MNET, GENIE,  debuted no 1 after mv out,  even soribada and bugs is in top3 position,  our melon chart is good comparing to Never ever,  we get rank no3/4 in ICHART that really huge improvement,  for other ahgases who can't help stream in korea app,  we must hardly stream here,  we expected to win this time but Nuest is really no joke this time,  Nuest got a public recognition after the program produce 101,we do very amazing at album sales and we never expect nuest to sell more album than us, Yes their fans work hard to get NUEST first win, that really shock,  yes they deserved to get that! But our boys is GOT7,  that why we need to help them,  That why if we want to won,  let's work more hard, but if we dont won , don't be so frust,  the boys know how we work,  but yesss whatever let's work hard more for them,  they give everything to us , I tell you ahgases u will only meet group like GOT7 once in your lifes,  i'm not trying to say anything,  but tell me where u can find a group who always put 'BABYBIRD' in their mv, babybird is us!,  where u can find a group who always upload special video in every comeback for us? They humble, funny,crazy, sweet, Where u can find a group that always talk about their friendship than anything? Creating album about real friendship? Including us in their life,  love us than anything, ? , every group have their own uniqueness,  but you will only meet squad like GOT7 once in your life, They never be same and none group can replace them in my heart, like jinyoung said said GOT7 is a friends that i will never meet again in my life,  i will never meet friends like them, only them, we came from differents country , differents age,we work hard together and share the same dreams okay Ahgases no matters what happen, 1,2,3,or 10 years we will stay with them, always GOT7,  7 for life,  although if we lost don't ever stop streaming, voting and all,  our boys only have us,  only IGOT7,  if JYP seems dont care about them anymore let JYP know IGOT7 is work harder than the company,  JYP never promote them in korea popular variety show, Jyp seems to want they work for more tours and etc to get a lots money,  that no fair,  they deserved korea big award too!,  we need to make JYP wake up,  let JYP know our boys talents need more recognition in korea,  let's make JYP send them in happY together,  Knowing bro,  and etc,  so our boys will be more popular in korea, please JYP just dont use GOT7 only for money,  give them what they deserved !*\n\n*Sorry for mention nuest,  i like them too*
It's beautiful sky 🌌 ~~~~~~~~~~~~

WHOS EXCITED TO WATCH US GROW IN THIS NEW HOUSE?!! 😍😍😍😍😍👩‍👩‍👦🌈🌹
dominic is getting sooooo big😭😻
I was kinda sad they left there other house but dang this house is so nice,  AND IT'S A FREAKING 1 STORY!
entrances & outrances lmao what
Okay. I cant get over the fact how loyal you two both are to each other. Y'all both have been together fpr 2-3 years, moved into a bomb ass house, got engaged,had a son, then move into another bomb ass house. Yall have the funniest little arguments but whem its ovet tell each other 'i love', you both make the craziest pranks on each other and you either get pissed or cry but in the end tell each other 'I love you' . yall can act totally ridiculous in public or not but never be embarrassed of each other. Yall both will do anything for each other amd it sets so much goals for people and its so inspiring.❤\nYall just keep doing what yall are doing cause you both dont know how much you impact on yalls fans and set huge examples for love. You both are the best parents dominic will ever ask for and you both are going to raise him so well!💕 #wilsonfamily
I love the fact the pool is gated, u guys really put wicky first
You gonna need a big remote control car to put him in to be able to get around in the big ass house!!! You's are blessed in everyway!! Love you's 💙💚💛💜❤

Hahahahaha I thought my phone was messing up when it paused on her scary face 😂😂😂😂 I was like WTF YOUTUBE
You should do a mermaid or siren. Not the nice kind, but the evil, murdering, seductress kind. Maybe with cool glitter or prosthetic effects? It would be awesome to see your creative side come out more.
That eye look on it's own was absolutely gorgeous BUT THAT FINAL LOOK DOOOOOE!
YOU SO TALENT DESCHIIIII! 🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓 😂😂😂😂😂😂  you give me a BLIND!!! what it is color eyes are!!!!!! PLEASE talk to me !!!!!! IM WAVE YOU FOR LONG TIME!!! xoxo MMRxMISSMALY 🌹✨🌊
To clarify: I never said I was definitely returning it (or the company took it back), I said we'll see if they let me! as a joke, knowing I've done a lot of stuff in it and also made a video documenting me doing those things, implying that they would definitely not let me return it. Sorry if that didn't come across or if anyone got confused! xox
You literally pull off every ugly outfit you've worn that's crazy lol 😂😂😂😂
5:27 hhahahahahahahah
You should try the Steam powered hair straightener that is being advertised on Facebook and see if it actually works.
10:42 It's like.. which one's worse? 🤣
I feel like this is what most girls would be like if they had a penis for a day.... just swinging it around.... lmao
I've always wore oversized tees and sweaters, but this I wanna try!!
Honestly, I think it’s cute when they’re bunched up
THE FACT THAT TYLER IS ALWAYS WITH HER DURING THIS AND ENCOURAGES HER MELTS MY HEART (,:
LIKE IF SAFIYA SHOULD DO “BOYFRIEND BUYS MY OUTFIT ON WISH” !!!!!!!
http://www.shein.com/Eye-Embroidery-Patch-Mesh-Embellished-Top-p-377435-cat-1738.html have you seen this shirt on SHEIN? I thought of your videos when I saw it. It kind of reminds of that shirt you wore to Coachella. Those eyes on this SHEIN shirt though.👀 it's like I can't look away.
for some reason this jacket creeps me out so much!
5:56 this would be creepy to see at night, like you’re alone acting like a weirdo...nah it would be creepy at any time if he day. 😂😂 love you Safiya ❤️
This is my my favorite video of yours! So funny, and entertaining. Especially you being flailing arm inflatable tubeman, and those dance moves! Lol I love how you're not afraid to be yourself, never change Saf! <3
the picture on splash mountain ;D hilarious!
I aspire to be as confident as Safiya
SHE SHOUKD TRY OUT THE VELVET 11’S THE JORDANS BC SHE CAN AFFORD A $700 JACKET AND I CANT EVEN AFFORD A CIRCLE
Can you do a video where you wear all of the worst clothing items together! 😂
Saf you need Mr Kate to come over and spruce up your filming space! (I've been watching LOTS of Mr Kate and I think she'd do something so fun for you!)
Looks like a jean straightjacket
I wouldn't say it's the ugliest jacket ever, but it's definitely the stupidest jacket I've ever seen
That outfit at the end killed me. omg.
The sound quality of your videos are always so perfect
Isn't the point of the jacket to get super stacked sleeves? Idk it's still completely useless
who else noticed that she blurred her butt at 9:58 XD
😂😂😂😂 I laughing like Crazy! Safiya you r the best!!!!!
I felt claustrophobic looking at this.....
Who else cringed inside when she used her sleeves to eat the pizza
wear boys clothes for a day
Didn't anyone see her ass blurred out lol
Shit she gets rlly good views for her vids
Hey! I was wondering if anyone wants to be Youtube friends? If you subscribe to me, I’ll subscribe back 💞💞 I love this community & I want to meet as many people  as possible!
we call those long sleeves 水袖 in Chinese but we use much more flowy material for it. Just copy and paste the word in google to see what it's like!
So next you have to do the ugliest hat.  Or skirt.
When my arms are chubby so I gotta get a large.....\n\nYup
In actually really loved your 'formal' styling with the jacket
For $700 this jacket best pay my phone bill every month
This gave me major anxiety and hand claustrophobia.
I love you and you're videos and tyler and crusty ❤❤❤❤
Code name kids next door who??? 😋😋
The hardest I've laughed all week! Thank you! Honestly love this jacket after watching this video. If it wasn't so expensive, I'd buy it in a heartbeat! Hmmm... maybe I can create my own?
I just realized that it's literally just a denim straight jacket oml
Omg this is the best I've ever seen on YouTube!! 😂😂
Am I the only one who was waiting for her to pull the sleeves up whilst eating the pizza
When you want to be an ender man
Dress like it’s the 50’s
I put my hair in a ponytail to get it out of my face and then I put little hairs on my face 😬
I, too, want to look like the Slenderman joined b*witched
I love it when it’s bunched up
This video made me laugh so hard that I peed myself. No regerts.
For some reason YouTube doesn't want me to watch this video.
On Wish there's a fanny pack that seems right up your alley for these 'wear weird things' videos. It looks like a hairy man's potbelly. I'd love to see you wear it around and see what reactions you'd get. I guess it's called The Dadbag Fannypack here are some links: https://www.shefinds.com/collections/dad-bod-fanny-pack/           http://qwiket.com/m/context/topic/a-designer-made-a-stomach-fanny-pack-that-gives-men-a-dad-bod-and-the-internet-is-obsessed               http://www.ifitshipitshere.com/the-dadbag-fanny-pack/
Next you should try the swell waterbottle to see if it actually stays cold
reminds me of the straight jacket i owned in middle school....yes i wore it unbuckled...yes i wore it everyday.
in case you ever thought you have tried every transparent plastic piece of clothing, here's another one: \n http://www.romwe.com/Adjustable-Straps-Clear-Bra-p-248602-cat-671.html
Safiya Nygard, please try the new trend nose hair extension? 😁😁😁😁
I like the video's with some history in there :-)
When you think the thing about the school code is funny but then you realise it doesn't make sense😂
Why don't you try to wear kpop clothes for a week?
Omg this made me crack up. I think you did an awesome job rockin it.
It reminds me of a home economics project gone wrong.
I think it would be awesome if you did a pastel goth makeover! It's really in style now a days, at least most of the internet think so. You obviously really love dark colors, I mean it fills up most of your closet, but in your pastel makeover video you said you kind of like it, so why not mix the two! That's entirely what pastel goth is, it's the normal dark gothic look but with pops of pastel, the style is very cute but also dark, it's kinda like if you took a normal goth and locked them in a room stuffed with candy for a week. I think you'd look super pretty in that style, and since it's mostly black you won't be stepping too far out of your comfort zone.
6:58 killed me so hard\nIts like a 4 year old not wanting to do her chorus
get a sewing machine and a few yards of denim and make one yourself for a fraction of the cost
the only person who would need this jacket is slenderman😂
I have to cringe every time she pronouncing net a porter the English way. It's a play on the French prêt à porter which means ready to wear and was used to promote pre-sewn clothes back when people mostly bought their own fabric and made clothes themselves. It's still used today, in fact, with many companies, and the phrase is used as well in popular culture with, for instance, the healthy fast food chain prêt à manger. But MOST IMPORTANTLY TO KNOW: it's pronounced pret (or net) AH port-AY.
*plot twist* they were pants...\nEDIT I HAVE BAD GRAMMAR BC IM ASIAN...
This looks like a computer malfunction.
can you try the Lunapad?
This is not ugly it's just too long
High fashion is art, it doesn’t need a purpose.
YOU SHOULD GO TO VIENNA AND WEAR A SUPER WIDE HIPPED OLD FASION DRESS!!! Like if you agree!!
I LOVE THAT YOU INCLUDED KIKWEAR PANTS!!\nphat rave pants all day every day c:
I actually really dig the jacket \nI love long bunched-up sleeves
Splash moutin is mah fave ride :DD
lmfao 9:58 the blur
Safff please try paper makeup (??)
whered you get your balck pullover its so pretttyyy

Wi think is looks kinda cute rolled up
@11:40 gives me life. 😂😂
hi miss safiya! are you from eaglerock?
here's what I don't understand, why scale the fish if you're going to fillet it? what was the point of scaling if you're cutting the skin off the flesh anyway?
3:26 Never heard of a straight bass Sean
isn't that the sushi chef from gmm? xd
I'm a fan, but - I just don't think the world needed another white people learn to make sushi in ten minutes short, you know? I feel like it's been done and done and *done* at this point.
8:31 That's much better than at the truck stop.  Sean, open up a sushi truck stop.
No such thing as a 1950s mustang. They came out in 1964
lose the playa watch please!
@0:35 THAT ACTION POSE!
Remove your watch before cooking.
Stick to the wings
We only teach 5 things...  1. Sharpening knife  2. Cutting fish  3. Making rice  4. Rolling ... just 5 things!
I don't get all the hype over sushi.\nIt's literally just raw fish on rice.
for some reason I've always thought Sean was a cook, turns out he can't fillet a fish LOL
I remember this dude from Ten Feet Tall. A true master
The entire time I just kept thinking I want to eat that entire slab of tuna.
What a brutal personality...just a terrible, terrible host.
Idk if I could dream up any sort of shittier hair line lmfao rip Sean
Hey guys. Commenting here so I can plug Jiro Dreams of Sushi, one of the greatest sushi documentaries out there, and quite possibly one of the greatest documentaries of all time. You guys should definitely take the time to watch it. That's all.
more of a snowflake situation. killed me
I like how you are switching it up. Good job man.
sean is not even fun to watch. boring hipster dressing motherfucker
Mustangs didn’t exist until the end of 1964 nerd. No such thing as a “round 1950’s mustang”.
He has so much pride about making sushi it’s very wholesome
Love sushi! Thanks Sean your videos are always making me hungry and teaching me simultaneously.
watch more great video on Indian cooking click photo
“Like a 1950’s mustang” he says. Too bad they debuted in 1964😑😑
I'm going to pretend you meant a 50's P51 Mustang and not the car, seeing as how the fish on the rice kinda looks like the body of a P51!
You're such a good host
Can you invite Pewdiepie again?\nI know the first time you invited him! But he turned you down because he's busy!
What watch is that sean
I really enjoyed the video, but you don't need to stay in character all the time. This segment seemed a little forced.
Little finger action?  That didn't sound right haha
I love Sean, but his knife technique is horrendous.
Where did you see a 1950s mustang?
Honestly super proud of Sean. Great work! 
Chef was a champ, seems like a cool dude
Next Hot ones we need Hot Ones: with ROADMAN SHAQ PLEASE LIKE THIS SO THEY CAN SEE IT
In school I used to always question why the things we were learning were relevant to our us. Now I willfully click on these kinds of videos...
Become a sushi chef in two months......... Lol
The mustang released in 1964 1/2. Damn Sean. Letting down the Midwest.
Hey Shawn hold the spine of the knife just above the handle with your thumb and for finger and wrap the rest around the handle  you will get better control of the knife
Mustangs fist got introduced in 1964 1/2 but I definitely knew what you meant 😆
Need hot sauce to eat it or what?
So we filleted our straight bass\nSean...it's striped bass.
So 1:30 in and already they are lying to me. That is not a a stripped bass. The lines are broken.
I want to eat sushi off of Sean, Fantano, and Binging with Babish's shiny bald heads.
0o0 when he chops the fishys head
When they're cutting near the beginning you can see how inexperienced he is just by his knife technique when cutting to the middle bone because he holds the knife with his finger on the blade.  Surprised the teacher didn't  point it out
I would be dope for them to have a video on traditional shojin ryori sushi.
Plot twist the Asian guy on the thumbnail is Sean.
I hope he meant p-51 mustangs, not Ford mustangs........
Ik he's not a car guy but a 1950's mustang is not a thing 😂 mustangs became a car in 1964.5
That intro is what I like to call sushi porn
The chef reminds me of Adam Sandler for some reason
The justin Timberlake of food 
Sooo... There's an anime with this premise right?
The secret to good sushi is bad fish. C'mon, guys.
It's still just a finesse game the chef is just moving forward...lmao I love Sean
Dude's such a sushi master that he has sponsor logos on his chef jacket
I feel like Sean Evans is so robotic and has no personality. He's like the Jason Bateman of interviewers
Gotta love those 1950's mustangs that came out in 1964 and 1/2.
as someone getting into blades and sharpening.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a sushi chefs and how well they can sharpen their knives
Someone call Flava Flav Sean has the guy's clock on his wrist.
now kill a chicken next and make wings from scratch :)
that blonde girl... damn stole the show
There is not a 1950's Mustang. LOL
Sean's roll looked pretty dodge but I bet it still tasted nice as fuck!
Shawn Evans acts like a female.....jeeezzz
1:04 that's only four things.  Not five things.
Lol love it, 1950's mustang hahaha you killed it bro

Anyone else wanted them to eat it

Nooooooooooooooooo😱
Little finger action

Hair net? What hair net?
aaaaaaah i need some sushi now
The Chef sounds like Adam Sandler doing an Asian accent 😃

#ricegumisabitch
Little finger action? Uh huh.
Sushi quality looks fetching terrible
little finger action... \n \nsean, you tease...
Did these motherfuckers just sushi-fy a fucking striper???
Great interview!
1960s* mustang, sean.
Hahahaha awesome.. tnx Sean this was entertaining :)
this was awesome!
1950s Mustang?
Daddy Evans
Woah this is a trip. I studied under Chef Andy Matsuda and graduated from SCI years ago. Hell yeah, Andy is an amazing instructor.
2 months and best sushi chef ? Are you joking ? \nIt takes a minimum of 10 years to be a sushi chef !
2 months? more like 20 years, fucking plebs

You love the Spice Girls and you know it! Friendship never eeenndss!
This was extremely good I loved it plz make more videos
To make you feel better there are 5 Spice girls, so Brandon is a little less creepy now. Well on that end of the spectrum 😂
JJR, the spice Girls are nothing to be ashamed of! We all love them, even you! Don't fight the spice.
Where do you get all of your shirts??? I love them!!!
Found your channel from iJustine! Love it.
He hates the Spice Girls,  tries to use a drill to make gum paste strings for decoration, and knows what channel locks are. Yep, definitely a Man . . . About Cake.\n\nAs for my costume, I'll be dressing up as a skeleton for work, but my husband wants us to dress up as peanuts so we can be nuts together.
Does whatever a spider cake does
I love this cake
Next Video please collab with How to Cake It
Can make a Australia themed cake pls
For the record, there were FIVE Spice Girls. Not four ;)
Aw, JJR, the crew's singing is great though!!! Love the cake (even though I'm arachnaphobic) and the crew!
I was Baby Spice when I was 8, my best friend was sporty spice and my neighbor made us sing for our candy.
Can you do a vampire team please. Beacuse I am a big fan of Twilight movie.🖒👍👍
I loved the guys singing and making JR turn red in the face. LOL 🤣💘
Long time ago I made and wore an autumn-themed costume  (that was inspired by Marjorie the Trash Heap on the puppet show FRAGGLE ROCK)  to work which won 2nd place in the costume contest. It was a separate hood over a long sleeved maxi length dress out of soft, drape coral-orange knit fabric; covered over with preserved florist autumn leaves and stems that I had meticulously appliquéd by hand. The accessory was a fan rake and to remove ANY doubt as to what I was supposed to be, my name tag read:  Pile-a Leaves!\nYou could make an Pile of Leaves autumnal cake like that too.  Bet it would be gloriously golden and gorgeous!
Really bitch! I was about to go to sleep and then I seen this video in my recommendation 💀💀😢😢
The Spice Girl puns! Lol Had me dying!
I love that all the guys started singing spice girls lol 🤣🤣😂
Love the Halloween opening!!!
You put a top panel on you middle tier. Did the gumpaste stay soft enough for the bubble tea straws
You guys are funny! (: JJR I always enjoy watching your vids!
Is that like a weird instrumental of ghost town in the background???
Honestly I think the spider would have been creepier if he would left it bone white and painted the top-tier gold underneath it. Cuz then I would look like a weird Fusion of the skeleton and spider
One of my most favourite video...if you wanna be my lover LOL 😂
This was one of the funniest episodes ever!!!  I loved watching this one!
Sorry, but I gotta love the singing and the Spice Girls references.  Totally liked for the Spice Girls stuff!!
I like the added Spice Girls 😅
I will sing a spice girls song every time I hear pumpkin spice lol
Their singing is beautiful
me and my best friend are thing 1 and thing 2
My best Halloween costume (or, at least, my favorite) was Eric Draven from The Crow. I was about twelve or thirteen, wore an all black outfit with a life-sized crow decoration stitched to the shoulder of my shirt (and of course I had the makeup). It was awesome, and we didn't even get to go trick or treating that year -_-
This is one of the most beautiful cakes I've ever seen! It's so elegant!!! I loved every detail... AMAZING JOB!
so is he a top or bottom
I absolutely love your work!!!! Please please please do a two sided cake!!!!!!
The Halloween intro is amazing
New subscriber here if u wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends making it last forever frrrrieeeendships never ennnnnnnd😂😂😂😂😁😁😁
Hello I have a question. Is there a reason u don't paint before and touch up after? Just curious.
I wonder where all the cakes go?
The banter between them all made this more enjoyable! Not that it wouldn't be without it but it made me smile 🤗
Loved the singing 😂😂😂,  your cake's look so yummy and beautiful ,  love you're show.
That wasn't a Halloween cake, it was a Wedding cake!!! but the two are not mutually exclusive so I will call this, Halloween Wedding cake 👰🎃🍰,
My best costume was a cardboard refrigerator running
This channel needs more singing 😂😂😂
Best halloween costume was was probably han solo, my friends were chewy, luke and Leia
I want to make a hALloween  but I am terrible at cakes and desserts
I am so in love with this cake!!
You and your crew are my favorite people
Hello👍 could you possibly do a Frankenstein cake?? And the original Frankenstein please😊😊
hands down my favorite episode the singing and back seat caking make this too legit to quit. #backseatcaking
Love your designs!  I took up baking cakes 2 months ago and found your channel.  I think I've seen all your MAC videos & this one has to be the best! I hate spiders but I so wanna recreate this cake myself. Thank you for all the inspirations! Go Team MAC!
Phantom of the Opera, clothing sucked but I'm proud of the makeup I did.
I HAVE ARACHNAPHOBIA WHO ELSE DOES
I'm sorry Josh, but i feel they should sing more
😍😍
Best Halloween costume: I was a gps
The spider looks almost like a jeweled pin.
When I was 11, I had two costumes.  One for the town Halloween parade and one for actual Halloween.  For the parade, I was a golf ball.  For Halloween, I was a munchkin.  Donut munchkin.
I absolutely love the crew! You guys rock! JJR you need to sing along man, singing good for the soul!!
People gold shame me all the time
Ammmazzing... No words
#letbrandonsing
JJR, you so fine <3
the buttercream kinuf looks crunchy almost
I always like watching your videos. You make beautiful ckes
The bloopers and the singing kinda made this better... and that spider was awesome, this woukd an an awesome cake for someone getting married around Halloween ^_^.
This episode was hilarious! I feel your pain with that extruder that would make me crazy!! Lolllll. This cake is amazing! And yes I have a crazy fear of spiders but you made it look incredible! Great job as always!

lmao you kept activiting my google home
Hey guys I have a few questions.  I'm seriously considering picking up a Google home (pod) and I want to know -\n1. Does it work with apple Music? I'm subscribed to them and if Google home can't play from this service it's a huge deal breaker for me\n\n2. How good is the sound quality? Does it compare to speakers (of the same price range) from the likes of Bose ?\n\nThanks
How long does it actually take to for Google to respond. I see you edited it so its quick
Quit complaining people about it being micro USB not USB c. It's a charger and nothing more. Wouldn't complain if it was a special charger but since it was a cord you already have in your drawer you got upset?
Google home is useless to me maybe because I have a simple life but I find no use for this if I have a phone
This video taught me that my google home can find my phone. Thank you for this.
Are you going to make a video to compare Echo dot to google home mini .?
I think it would be a really good video comparing the Amazon Echo and the Google Home. I want to get one of the two, but I cannot decide which one.
No, the price point wasn't enough for me to purchase, but as a free code comes with the purchase of a new Pixel2/Pixel2XL, I'll be checking it out. Not sure where to put it where it wouldn't be made redundant by my phone.
Shoutout to the Oddisee plug during the audio section
I have the Echo Dot and it does everything I need it to. However the game changer with the Mini Home is the ability to launch Youtube videos natively.  For that single reason I shall buy it.
You triggered the one in my room.
Awesome review! I'm receiving a free one for pre-purchasing the Google Pixel 2.
A good Black Friday deal could make these fly off the shelves for Christmas.
Can you pair it with a Bluetooth speaker? Also does it work with Spotify?
Marques whenever you said hey google you always activated my google home
I  know you dont have a girlfriend, but can you do a video explaining how google home acts with multiple android phones in the same house?
btw, your nestcam its not connected to the internet.
Why would I get one?\nWhat is the everyday use for?\nHow does it talk to the tv to play you tube?\nCan it open Netflix?\nSpotify?
yes because it is alot better than amazon lol
Im gonna gonna run up to someone with a pixel and yell ok google send my search history to babe
MKBHD the typa dude to go protesting for usb c everything
This thing is magic
I am definitely going to pick one up, maybe a couple.  I want to see how the sound is first before I commit to a second. I already have one Google Home and want more around the house. These makes the cost much easier to tolerate.
Do you need that speaker at home?, NOPE.
“The size of a donut.” I think it’s bigger than UK donuts. I asked Siri but she was useless, ironically.
for 50 bucks cool thing, I'll go and order myself
I was in the same room as my Google Home and it was going nuts watching this video. 😂
I can do this all day, I can do this all night want this music.
you don't really need type c port because you're not charging it nor transferring files.. save a panny and just do micro
Can you still play mad libs with the mini?
Hi marques,\nWhat do you think about the STREAMZ headphones?\n\nIt is a one piece...uou don't need a phone or computer to listen to music...\nPlease hurry, I need a head phone...one piece.
Gonna wait 'till version 2 and then I'll get 3 or 4 of them for my house. Thanks for the review.
Play a B Flat... Lol
Preordered mine
2017 feels so futuristic
Ok Google, eat my ass!!!
Technigger
Extreme other kind doorway kit probably illustrate sentiment achievement.
4.03 Savage 👊
Right when you said to broadcast video it did it on my Google Home smh. The sad part was that my volume was low
whats the song you used when you tested the google homes?
Another ploy by google to data mine a different demographic at a lower price point
Google mini's speaker sounds much better than the original Google Home
I am not batman because i _like_  being BATMAN. I am Batman because i _am_ BATMAN
It's an always-listening device made by a company that monetizes private data about our every move. Pass.
So I have the Google Home, if I get the Google Home mini and do Hey Google, will both devices be triggered or just the device I am nearest to?
Can you do a review of a phone LG Q6 which was launched in India for 15000rs and was also having face recognition mode.
If I already have Amazon Echo's is there anything much better about the Google Home that I should know to get me to switch?  I feel like they are effectively the same.
Hey Marques, I noticed you triggered the assistant by saying Hey Google instead of Okey Google. Is there a way to change that command? Btw, great video as always. Keep it up!
nice shirt can i get one
can i trade my echo dot, never use it xD (Its useless in malaysia)
Love you my black diamond
Just a suggestion .. mute Okay Google in your videos, I had to stop watching, it was triggering my Google Home!
Lucky your internet is fast. It's fucken horrible here in Australia
Why would you need USB type-c???? Cost of those components are much higher and has no impact on anything! Sorry but thats a bad nit for a product like this.
I think Google already spies on people enough! now you want to let them into you're home!? Google is creepy!! now they can listen and watch everything going on in you're home! NO FUCKING WAY!
worth the money i guess
No Google, I will not voluntarily pay you to put microphones in my house. That's way too much.
that's creepy
Even though i am not gonna buy any of these I wanted you to review Google home Max than a mini
Which is this song that he is using
WHY YOU ALWAYS DON'T PUT ENGLISH SUBTITLES IT IS NOW DUTCH
Looking forward to the Pixel 2 and XL review. ETA?
That smile when the default essential phone video is an MKBHD video. 😜
Man google products are f-ugly, damn !! Pixel 2 looks like a noname $100 phone 🤢
My phone whent crazy every time he said hey google...
I don't understand how it hears you? How far away can you be
Mkbhd thoughts on the flexible phone by Samsung. Samsung Galaxy X?
Playing your own video via Google home was so meta..... and badass.
Just got a 4k monitor.... Watching this is epic! Ok, not epic. But pretty cool. :D
i'd buy one today if it had an audio output.
I'm really considering getting this maybe I'll gift it for someone if I find it useless
I've just moved house to a place with some awesome scenery, I love talking photos but only use my phone. I'm on a cheap budget to buy a camera ( $440 ) so do you or anyone reading this comment know a good camera I could get?
Hey Guys I'm Just Starting out my youtube venture a little bit of love would be appreciated... Like and subscribe to my channel and i would do the same for you... also like this comment..Thanks and have a great day!!!
My Google home can't find my phone!!!! She says that she doesn't understand, is this a new feature on the mini one?
Even if they'd give them away for free, I wouldn't want one. It's bad enough, that google knows everything I do online - it really doesn't need to listen to everything I do offline ;)
This is sweet, unbelievable for £50
Can you connect it to a sonos play 1?
This is a cool device. Except for its fabric top. A surface that is designed for tap/touch will soon get dirty and the grunge buildup will not be easy to wipe clean.
What’s the point of this if your phone can do all the same commands?
Dude, my Home sent me away from your video when you asked it to show Essential Phone Videos!
umm.. isn't the trigger Ok Google..? Since when did it start responding to Hey Google..? Did Google assistant and Siri have a child..? lol..
Dude , thanks for that song
Sure
Stop saying yo please say het guys MKBHD here
That new wallpaper TV is off the chain. What size is it?

Hey do you think the pixel and Google are ushering in a new era for android?
I swear, this guy is like a great teacher teaching all the important detail about these tech products.
It's time to stop saying 'OK Google' in your Google Home related videos, have to mute my mic every time lol.
Definitely getting a few for the house
This is the most entertaining tech review I've seen in a long time.  Thanks!  You're the man!
Can u make vlogs if u get the chance
Could you review the new Lenovo Yoga 920?

We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
The grey jedi crap goes against EVERYTHING.
I didn't miss shit!
the scene between Brienne of Tarth I mean... Phasma and Finn is reminicent of the Revenge of the sith  cover with Anakin striking Obi-wan with his lightsaber inside Darth Vader's face
#teamporg but where is my girl Jessica!?
Porgs and Star Wars fans are words that will never go in a sentence together. EVER.
What about the line which Luke says about raw power ?
Why do the US and UK trailers have different middles.. THIS CHRISTMAS or THIS DECEMBER around the 1min 20 mark...
Star Wars: Return of the Mary Sue
I think a BIG detail was missed: Luke's fear!
I love how she pretends to give a fuck about all of this xD
Great job Amy on this episode of Nerdist News!
How did the star go from being cute to unattractive in just 18 months
She talks too fast the first half.  She needs to pace and breathe.  Outside of that, it cracks me up all this crying over Jessica, happens every time she isn't in the video lol
Jesus! Fuck! What is it with her eyes?
She reminds me a lot of Pearl from Steven Universe.
But what about Luke being placed on the back of the poster? Like all antagonists have been in the posters as far as I know.
Nothing about Phasma and Fin, but all about the Porgs? Are you taking Star Wars not serious? :)
#teamporg\nI hope I don't wind up regretting that.
The fact that they remembered the blast mark is amazing. So much attention to detail.
I can't wait for Dec., but seen this new trailer it as the look of a rehash Empire Strikes Back like with The Force Awakens from a New Hope. basically The Empire/New Order & Rebel/Resistance still haven't learn from history. they might have new tech, but still essentially stuck in a loop.
Where the hell is Chobot?
that prog is going to be annoying
spoiler warning after playing parts from the trailer. im sure anyone who want avoiding spoilers would not have click this any way. but still you made a shitty warning
Got to love myself a little Porg
#TEAM CHEWBACCA because he is going to eat that stupid porg thing lol
I agree with Mark Hamill: They have totally fucked up Luke's character,and this trailer seems to be more evidence of that.  Also, they should retitle this Episode 8: Return of the Mary Sue
Chewie is a legend!! where does he fit in all this? are R2 and 3PO going to continue on their dumbass adventures? what about BB8 and the new evil BB9??? also, Phasma..... how sick does she look?!
Great breakdown because you added bits of info you know as a fan already knolagble about the Last Jedi
Je--Jessica? Is that... you? Wow. Star Wars has changed you
What's with Rey's white lightsaber or am I seeing things?
Loving that Vault-Tec top!!
I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\n\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\n\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \n\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*
I'm on team Amy.
NERDGASM FOR THE CRYSTAL FOX!!!!!!!
I miss jessica\n\n
this trailer was the final piece that convinced me: star wars is DEAD.
Could Snoke's torturing of Rey be a force dream and not real?
Some of you guys give nerds a bad name. \nWhat does it matter who is presenting? It's the content I'm here for!
Love the trailer, but I hope it's full to the brim of misdirection like the Rogue One trailers. All I'm going to take from this is that it looks COOL!!!!!
Holy shit the blatant disconcerting reading-face she's doing is the most distracting thing I've seen in weeks, and the fact that you had to KEEP CUTTING TO HER RANDOMLY forced me to keep most of the video off the screen at all times because seeing her leaning forward staring at the cue cards/prompter made every word she said turn into those sounds adults made on Peanuts cartoons.\n\nIf you have to bring someone on that can't read without leaning in and making it obvious, at least don't cut to her at random frequent intervals so it's less of a distraction.
A bit dumb and logic jumpy. I think after that scene with the ships giant robot elephants warp in shooting nuclear bananas.... Could happen!
Fuck Jessica\nShe's a thot
I am hyped for Carrie Fisher but it’s going to break my heart, and I want a nude scene with Poe and Finn... but that’s just me...
Amazing, Amy did great, even she has the same gesture of putting the arms behind her back!! 😍 In general she's more cute and Jess more spicy, but anyway, good job!! 😊
is it just me or thi Amy Vorpahl is just too hot!! damn
Bb8 getting zapped from the back of Poe’s Tie Fighter, a nod to R2D2 getting zapped on the back of Luke’s Tie Fighter in Star Wars A New Hope???
#TeamCrystalFox If they're running into the base it's clear they've been domesticated and are being used somehow by the Resistance. For who knows what but they're cool!
Amy, dunno what you did with you hair but it worked. You looking damn fine.
I wonder is Rey was created by Snoke a'la Darth Plagueis with the purpose of mating with Kylo to give rise to the ultimate Force child?
Balanced Jedi are those who rely on the Light side of the Force. Anakin brought balance (restored the natural balance) by destroying the Avatar of the Dark side, Sidious. The Gray was never canon.
Maybe this mineral planet is rich with Kyber crystals
Kylo Rey will be the ultimate evil of EP IX xD
What about fin?🤔he was in the trailer
damn i know you warned me but why would they put so many spoilers in the god damn trailer
We are the Porg. Resistance is futile.

Thanks!
Jessica looks different
kristal fox
Man. I love this channel, but the troop of turds lead by their cocks crying when Jessica isn’t on makes me queasy.
Basically its all white males are now bad.... You know, the majority of the USA... Now has to sit back and let 'minorities' take over to become 'equal' WHEN they wont show the same in countries they come from.... Thats how pathetic people are. Wont help each other in their own country BUT make white people PAY for their 3rd world country immigrants that want free stuff and to blame everyone else for their mistakes in life...... How pathetic.
It's pronounced AHK-TOE. That drove me nuts the whole time I was watching. Jessica would say it right #TrueFan
Who the fuck is this?
Bring back jessica
He's kinda look like Gackt , japanese singer am I right ?
I'm a Taemin fan now.
I had a vision of you in that white shirt, Taemin! Awwe, you look so good! Congrats on your new album! ♥
SM Is legit trying to make everyone have heart failures everyday!

TAEMIN!!!!!!!!!! SHINEE FOR LIFE!
Oh my GOSH! Dirty, dark, sensual, alluring Taemin is THE BEST.
IM ALREADY LOVE THIS
I'm dead \n.bye
Taemin siempre haciendo lo mejor! 👍
i know the michael jackson vibes comments are meant as a compliment. but actually i think taemin is moving further away from that with every comeback. there is a big influence coming from japanese artists now, especially koharu of course, but altogether he is developing a more and more theatrical, artistic style that is very different from MJ.
OMG TAEMIN IS FINALLY BACK!!! CAN'T WAIT!!!
King of The 80s vibes.
*THIS IS GOING TO BE LIT* *AF*
Taemin looks a freaking Anime character freshly drawn and printed out. He's beautiful af. I'm ready for this comeback 👏
IM SO READY KING TAEMIN IS BACK TO SLAY THE WORLD
all of this look like ghost in a shield omg
This has such a mj vibe to it and i LOVE IT BIH
This song better be used in Stranger Things
I NEED THIS BEAT TO SOUND LIKE THIS WHEN IT COMES OUT!!!! The world needs it! The 80's early 90's new wave baby in me is living for this!! He's about to slay the game!
2 mins left for the new teaser!!!
Editors who stan him are so lucky, if y’all wanna do Spy or Gang AUs then it’s gonna be so goddamn easy thanks to these clips
Fk he's hot

One word:\nR E A D Y
His shirt in the beginning said *take a small bite* BISH I’M TAKING A BIG BITE
This sounds so good
I don't know if I'm ready yall omg
SUCH A MAN WOW
I'm really loving the BGM on these teasers. Can't wait to hear Taemin's raspy voice singing over them!
I'm in Love!!!! He looked like a sexy Scarlet Johannson at 0:12
Sounds so 80s love it
i can't stop repeating this taemin is a fucking legend
This reminds me of Matrix for some reason... 😂😂😂
Will this song actually be on iTunes?
The king is coming back to end everyone and they mamas 😍

I think joes sc has been hacked it's got some next thing on his story like if u seen his recent story

I hate buzzfeed, but this show gives me a lot of good food places to go to
I Think Steven and Andrew are gay for each other.
After Steven drank the alcohol, he got the signature Asian glow!! LOOOOOL
I literally have never been disappointed in these videos.
Ryland looks good in this video

Steven’s crush on Andrew just keeps growing lol
What the hell is “kayso”?

i camt get over the way that lady says queso and jalapeños like hun jalapeÑÑYOS cmon
It's like Jake and Amir, except Jake says yes to dinner every single time.

The tortilla smells incredible. Its like a  baby's thigh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot creepy at all... (◕︵◕)

Are andrew and steven gay?
Damn i could go for some dennys or something rn
when you use a flour tortilla it turns into a burrito, or quesadilla.. Idiots
I feel like the brunch facts are off though.. I mean, at least in the south, Sunday brunch was like a fancy meal you went to after church because you're already dressed up and with your family ha
This is just one of the most successful forms of modern advertising.\nand they get to eat a ton of good food along the way\nthey must love their jobs lol
Did Adam finally get his own meal! Go Adam! Lol
Who else only watches these videos from buzzfeed
Food lovers Steven and Andrew or Lovers, Steven and Andrew, ?
good food, nice place setting, quality camera work, three adorkable men. what else can i ask for?
Steven looks so good in that sweater
They're the Jake and Amir of Buzzfeed
Oh god...if they in Japan; I can only think of two things: Ramen or Japanese Sushi...or Kobe Beef idk...
I wonder if they use Yelp
that lady briana was so nice! i want to be her friend! (but even being brazilian and speaking portuguese, the way she pronunced queso sounded just wrong) 😂💕
I love this series 💕
Adams face when he received that massive pancake was amazing.
Do a Drone Worth it!!!!!
The music from overcooked!
steven is wearing the suit he made in the suit episode :D
did adam get his own plate!!!!!! whhaaatttttttttttttt !
The most expensive brunch is $113\nThe like for this video is 113K\nIlluminati confirmed
YOU DO EAT THE WHOLE STACK MAN CMON
when they put the huge pancake in front of Adam, i died :'D
I can tell on the last restaurant, they had a dress code
I think they're lowkey turning gay
Adam finally getting full proper meals of his own, lol
When they describe it I was like whooo!!!  Wait I am eating egg now lol
Andrew is my favorite person to partner with Steven.
Why isn’t “Worth It” on the Food Network yet?
Part of the charm of Worth it is also following the budding friendship between Steven and Andrew.
Darn I should not have watched this while hungry
brunch is all about bottomless mimosas or bloody marys

I literally had a breakdown over my anxiety the other day and then my mom went on a tangent on how I’m “ just trying to be cool “ and that I “ don’t have anxiety. “ god I wish people would realize that ANXIETY ISNT COOL and it’s extremely difficult to deal with.

Ha what luck I was having an anxiety attack last night and I didn't even know it was mental awareness day hahaha
This is amazing thank u Dan and this is coming from someone with anxiety depression and ocd
Oh dad guess who has anxiety! That's right me
Your nails are hella pretty but I bite mine off

WOW FOOD WARS IS BACK???!?!?!!!
The only yellow clothing I own is a single yellow sock. I wore it, though.
I saw him flash the nails and I was like Ooh loving the nails\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut that opinion died as soon as he properly showed us the nails.

How big can this get? - that's what she said.
My school doesn't even do counselling
THERE'S ANIMALS IN THE CALENDER! CONFIRMED
my school let us wear yellow accessory for a day it was fun
I like his nails ^^
Dan, you're so precious
I was told by my school u would get a councillor and they would support me because I’ve only just spoken out about my mental health problems and idk what else to do because nobody is supporting me and I’m only young, but ur videos have helped me so much xxx
A girl tried to commit suicide at my school yesterday and it's really scary to realise how many people are actually going thru depression and struggle with mental health.This foundation is really important and i hope it successfully helps those who don't currently have it...thank you
Now I want Phil to paint my nails ff
Now I kinda wanna write a fanfic of Dan and Phil working in a nail salon................\nBrb
Are we going to have a Dil and family Halloween video? Please?!
Hi Dan, I just want to tell you that I allllllways miss your live streams, because my mother takes out my tablet when I go to bed because I'll probably be on them all night, so anyway can you please go live on the weekends because I'm allowed them on the weekend. Thanks.
Heey\nMy best friend is in a depression I really want to help her. Has anyone advise?

Is it Dodie yellow tho?
Phill is so cheesey
Like a demented Julie Andrews song. Love it!
You know, I miss when Annie used to shred the guitar on her earlier albums. I don't even recognize this as her work anymlre
I didn’t see that it said 'audio' so I kept waiting for her to move 😂😂
Cara's voice is good :)
This chorus is horrendous (coming form someone who loves her with a passion) but the rest of this song is fire!!!!
does this remind anyone else of the underpants gnomes' song from south park?
pretty good timing for this song considering that the vegas shooter took anti anxiety pills that  drove him to psychosis
I don't even know if that's a bass anymore (what year is this?), but the responsible for it knows his stuff
This is my happy pill!
The first song, New York...just didn't really do it for me. I love Annie for her insanely idiosyncratic angular approach to songwriting....and that song just didn't tickle my fancy. But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\n\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.
The breakdown sounds like the Rain down... section from Paranoid Android to me... (a good thing)
the end half reminds me of Marry Me, and whatever happens before that gives me a seizure. I kinda like it. It feels like a solid blend between new and old styles. It reminds me a bit of The Apocalypse Song from Marry Me, and then Your Lips are Red, and then the hook is like a 1960's commercial jingle
Music of this woman is  absolutely Unique !!! 😍 I love it !!!! 😍
I hate pills but I like this songs.
St. Vincent > Queen Bee
Tasty guitar on a delicious track!  YUMMM!!!\nWhen it comes to St. Vincent, I cannot be satiated!
This song honestly not my style, too fucking weird
So far the album sounds like Annie trying so hard to avoid her feelings
This song is amazing and catchy as hell
Check out LIVINGSTON CAULFIELD - Not in love (official music video) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyKs-DJJFvY
When I saw the notification I haven't read the title 'till the middle, so when I started watching thought she's gonna move... that's how I love u =)
Sounds like a blend of songs from Panda Bear, Bowie, Queen, Sufjan Stevens, and Bjork. Loving it so far 👌
One of the reasons i still want to live..
It must have a ❤️ button 'cause I'm loving it!\n\nMASSEDUCTION's on fire 🔥🔥🔥
I'm glad this turned out to be music instead of what I clicked on this for.
Holy shit this is the St. Vincent I've been waiting for
sounds like it belongs on masseducation
the 21st century's female Bowie.
Ugh I’m loving this new sounds so much
Wow. She just continues to put on bangers. So excited for the album!!!!!
Every other commercial on my tv is another one, and with each one the name sounds increasingly more like folk terminology for an affliction than a remedy.
Getting some real Marry Me vibes at the end. 4:13 reminds me so much of apocalypse song
I 🖤 Annie Clark. Girl needs a hit though. Hoping this is it!
I like how the song is kind of ambiguous about pills. The ending made me think that the problem isn't pill use -- the problem is the world
Annie's requiem for a dream
These lyrics are some Talking Heads-level stuff.
I want the outro on a loop. 🔥
I want to hear Mindless Self Indulgence do a cover of this
The beginning of the song sounds like that one Moana song tbh
I wouldn't need any pills to fuck her
Omg she is so sexy. Only girl I'd go gay for
Definitely my favorite so far from the singles released
I WANT TO MAKE SEXY TIME WITH THIS WOMAN NOW!
It kind of reminds me of Tune Yards
let alone find that kind of vocal range

this sucks so bad that im' done with youtube for right now.
Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Ummmm this is so weird. It sounds like an ad St Vincent made. It is terrible and brilliant at the same time. The pills pills pills and a good stiff drink makes me nervous, but she redeems it towards the middle and the end with a classic rock structure. Maybe it'll make sense next to the other tracks.
Awesome song dead on commentary about how screwed up this society is and how we are all puppets of big Pharma.\n\nWhat one thing do all the shooters in all mass shootings have in common? They were all on multiple psychoactive prescribed drugs.
Am I the only one who hears life on mars at 2:50?
Annie, needs to do some work with Jamie Hince
i love this pic for.. reasons
Kind of Vampire Weekend 's vibe at some parts
Anyone else notice that Pink Floyd influence?
chorus is annoying, BUT DEAR GOD THAT SECOND HALF IS AMAZING! seriously that should have been the whole song. felt like modern day pink floyd
The melancholy finish is so Bowie Diamond Dogs/Low.
Not a very subtle message to this song.
I've never felt so ready for an album in my life.
Pills to follow Prof. Oak back to the lab
This song seems like to use for cheerleading or marching
upward arching Sphinx
Annie is spitting rhymes. Awesome!
The outro interpolates ''Everyone You Know Will Go Away'', or the live song she played addressing mental health at David Byrne's show.\n(I am secretly SO happy for that)
I'm enjoying this new direction. It's not as heavy as the older albums. Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar. But I do understand sometimes people just don't dig something and that's fair enough. There's a beauty in difference of views and opinion.
love it
I think we are listening an album about a beautiful talented musician girl who joined the high fashion scene and her thoughts about the things she finds ridiculous in it. Its just an idea though so we will see but It is ok beautiful girl, it is ok.. not everyone has the chance you have.. funny song though !
Pills pills pills to get a big stiff dick pills pills pills

Firm flop into pop on this album. Lalala fafafa pillspillspills. She used to rock.

Portrait of an Artist Selling Out
I've really liked the way this album has sounded so far, but the social commentary has been lack luster. I definitely think you should put it in your music, but what does saying anything about plastic surgery or Fucking pills have to do? Yes there are plenty of people who take pills who don't need them, but I'm disabled and in debilitating pain and I need them to get out of bed. I need pills to wake and sleep and fucking walk AND eat because of stomach issues. Medical science has come a long way and I'm HAPPY for it. This song is catchy but the lyrics are a snooze fest. 😴😴😴😴😴😴
Sorry but it's annoying and generic
Really talented pop composer though, like brilliant ear for melody and tasteful guitar, the music kicks ass. It's just like 'rage against the machine' or some other kind of immature preachy bad self-important lyricism, i can suffer through most of it.
50 Cent is the epitome of Petty Betty and I live for it!
Loni looks GORGEOUS!! even w her auntie glasses on
never heard about this beef
Patiently waits for 50 to respond in 3...2....1
50 cent is petty af.
50 cent always feuding with somebody like how old are u
LONI LOOKS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!!OMG
Tamera looks GORGEOUS
ADRIENNE IS SUCH A DICK RIDER.
Both of these old ass clowns need to chill out
You tried to kill the man...............we gone have beef fo eva (in my Cardi B *voice*)
Who is he ?
Adrienne seems different in this clip, the way she is talking and handling herself
Damn Loni is looking so good these days
Irv Gotti a STAND UP GUY? Is she FOR REAL? Another reason I can't stand Adrienne.
Why is loni dressed like the auntie that stays by the drinks table gossiping with the grannies? 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣  Don't get me wrong, she is looking so much better this season but what is this outfit?
they too old for that 🙄
Irv tried to get 50 killed. That's beef for life! What do you expect?
From Season One, they are interviewing so many people I have not heard of their name or seen them before. At least I know now.
Lol they to old to be having beef for 15 years 😂😂😂😂 get over it!!!
POWER, BMF and 50 CENTRAL > IRV GOTTI AND TALES COMBINED
Because he's an overconfident dweeb
This clown acting like he's the victim when he tried to kill 50 TWICE. Foh
Lol this is silly. They stabbed 50, took credit for when 50 got shot 9 times. They where involved with jay master j's death, they linked up with people who wanted 50 dead. 50 is a bad good guy, but this guy is a punk.
Probably because Irv was being extorted by the same Gangsters that shot FIF for disrespecting their bitch and meal ticket aka Irv gotti
he tried to kill 50 cent Twice what dose he mean wtf
Because 50 Cent is petty. It's time for him to grow up, dude is like 40/41 years old.
Whenever i see beefs i just think that forgiveness is so worth it
who's uploading these clips?? people u r killing us,can't you upload the whole thing, please
These one minute clips are getting INFURIATING, I'm gonna keep it real, if y'all keep this up, you'll lose too many fans to count, think about your international viewing.
50 has beef with his own son, why are we surprised?
All I got to say is I STILL love MURDER INC. Love Ja always!!!
You people are so dumb Is there a beef started in the streets of New York Queens South Jamaica really serious
Been a BIG fan of 50 cent  for years but he does have a history of pettiness. Like be grown men and just let it go.
This the guy who said Kardashian’s caused racism
These clips are so short it ain't even really worth someone writing their opinion
Hay im from uk\nHow can i watch the full  video?\nAnyone know?
Any small youtubers wanna support each other? Sub first & I'll sub back ❤😎
Can't wait to see my loves hit a million!!
they have been beefing since 1999 that's 18yrs Adrienne not 15yrs😂
I'm sick of these clickbait titles. Unsubscribed.
Dnt talk about my bae 50
Adrienne looks amazing!!!
Clown as dude
Who is he?
50 Cent is super petty...and guess what? I love it! I think it's funny. He's a trip and he cracks me up. I say keep bein' petty. You should know this by now, Irv. You're always talkin' about _turning the other cheek_ so do that. You know 50 is petty. Quit playin'. Oooh and Irv, didn't y'all try to *_take 50 out_* at one point in time? Ummm huh... I remember...
50 actually gets on my nerves LOL and 50 central sucks
50cent is a TROLL. You can't take it seriously.
Adrienne & Jeannie look GORGEOUS
ooo girl whats up with Lonis ashy foundation? She needs some fenty beauty
I can’t stand Loni
Irv you a bitch!
omg he got old
MASSIVE Thank you for everyone supporting me and making a dream reality! TG
What a sound guy .
Back on CM 1996/7 I was always newcastle due to Shearer (I'm a saints fan). Good interview.  Shearer is a nice bloke.
This guy looks like Lincoln Burrows bruh
0:03 is that a young Brian?
What a wonderful podcast. Excellent work guys!!
unliked so i could like this video twice. mad respect geordie
Wish me Dad was alive to watch this he would of loved this :) proud to be a geordie awesome podcast mate glad you met your childhood hero nice one :)
The arsehole who took Newcastle down, yes had little chance to save but didn’t care enough to help get them back up, no sit on his smug arse on motd, were I Geordie (thank god I’m not) I’d despise the arsewipe
Great Podcast! Think you should have hat films on the podcast they are youtubers as well and think it would be a hell of a laugh
Where are the fucking football hangovers?
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Terrific podcast, really enjoyed it, keep up the good work lad.
What a brilliant Interview. No punches pulled and raw AF. Loved it TG
can you do one about the big man's tattoo's..?..and another one about lawrence dick...oh no..that would only last 2 minutes...!!
Amazing podcast! Try and get Kai Greene on, that would be sick!
class podcast genuinely proud to have been a fan for a long time. MICHAEL DAPAH or MR TRAUMATIC would be great guests
Wish I could speak Newcastle so I could understand them :(
I know most people wouldn't like this comparison , but Alan Shearer looks a lot like Fred Durst to me
Got emotional when talking about speed. RIP speedo I remember the day he died I just finished a Sunday league game was devastated
Dammn still Trending smashing it lad
So happy for you!!!
Never really thought much of Alan Shearer, other than he was an incredible striker. Watched the full 2 hours and I think he came across really well. Good interview.
Talking about Leicester aswell. I'm in love. Shearer knows what we did was something to never be repeated.
As A Boro fan ... Enjoyed that ..I met Alan a few times when he lived next door to my freind in Wynyard ( Kenny Lowe now manager of Perth Glory ) Had a party one night and all the guys had come in Fancy Dress ,,,Well TBH dressed a women !!! Mr Shearer turned up in a lovely silver dress !!! He is good craic , Comes accross different on the TV ....England legend
Well done Geordie , good on you mate !
This is a great interview.  Shearer is my favourite English striker, and the best that I have been play.  I am happy to see True Geordie interview his hero and keep it real.
Absolutely Class podcast mate, congratulations on realizing a dream TG, as a Newcastle fan, this was amazing to listen to.
Holy Shit!!! Even as an American Toon Army supporter i'm giddy, and i only saw him at the end of his career. Thank You!
Shearer was a TOP class centre forward who scored all types of goals and was infact underrated.
Just scanning YouTube and found your podcast just wanted to say not a Newcastle fan but really injoyed the podcast!
Arsene Wenger says what made muhammad ali so great was he got loads of people interested in boxing. \n\nsame thing applies to true geordie, he's got a lot of us hoping newcastle do well
It's all about money, tell me I'm wrong.
Shearer was a big part of why i started following NUFC, what a player. Great man too. Loved seeing TTG get the chance to meet one of his idols too. Great stuff. Keep at it fella. HWTL
Well in, TG. Happy for you. Being one of the realest youtubers out there, you immensely deserved this. The podcast was quite enjoyable and it was great to hear personal stories from Alan. Long may the King in the North reign. Your Empire shall hopefully soon have 1 million citizens
I am a Liverpool fan and I was so happy he turned down Man utd to go Newcastle and respect to him to turning so surely so many trophies to go to his boyhood club,he was a great player same never won a trophy with you.
As a fellow Newcastle fan, great to see you meeting your idol, such a nice, down to earth guy 👍🏻
Never watched a YouTube video for more than 15 mins.....until now. Shearer is a class act and great interview kid.
BEST VIDEO EVER!!!! nice to hear a few hope truths from wor al such a professional my brothers want to play for Newcastle and they graft there arses off every weekend please try and get my hero on Peter Beardsley for a talk  would be great to hear from him thanks guys keep the vids coming thick and fast C,MON THE TOON!
Class Brian how far you’ve come , excellent interview
Fantastic inrerview mate i couldnt think of a questione you didnt ask.\nBig al a true gent as always......the toons no1 ......
Wtf I went off for like 2 months and they've got Alan shearer on congrats guys
What an absolute show today, loved this as a football, Lawrence and Geordie fan
Absolutely brilliant TG. Big follower anyways, but what a two hours. Gripping stuff. Mr Shearer is a true ledge of the English game and gave me fantastic enjoyment down the years. He put a 'shift' in here too. And he pulls no punches. Cheers guys. Manc Red since 79 n all. Keep up the gud work lad.
This is one of the best yet, i feel like i say that every week. TTGP doesn't set the bar....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHEY ARE THE BAR!!
I go to his sons school !
Gaz\n\nFulham fan. Shearer a legend! Watched whole interview and his  beard had grown an inch by end of interview.
Such an interesting & inspiring watch. Well done mate!
Intro song pls I need this
Could you get wayne rooney ???
First time listening, from Ireland and a United supporter haha, but was an unbelievable one, Id usually watch Joe Rogan/Fighter and the kid, dabble with cheeky sports the odd time, but this was unreal well done!
Who's the bird on the wall ?
Who did Shearer tell not to come back to Newcastle?
Very emotional last part. But so happy to see my favourite YouTuber make it even bigger than before
Being a Blackburn fan it was great hearing about the good old days. Fantastic podcast as always Geordie keep it up. #VenkysOut
Top player the Germans feared him! Seems like a top man too. Well done mate on a. Great interview ☺
Respect man... Ive been subscribed to you since 2014 and to see how far you’ve come on YouTube is absolutely great. You’re my favourite YouTuber and you deserve all the great stuff that comes your way
Sir Bobby Robson wasnt in charge when bowyer and dyer had a fight it was soueness lol
Did they turn Laurence's mic off
My Idol as well mate, watched him when I was younger on the telly. What an experience that would've been Geordie!
Who brought their kitten to the studio man?
3rd time watching this through
Great podcast. Proper envious of you meeting your idol and having a chat like that with him. Also what a guy Shearer is as well, down to earth legend. Well in mate, hard work is paying off 👊🏻
Alan shearer brilliant player but he was not as good as wor Jackie Milburn he got three fa cup winners medals how many has alan won non
Wow, some unique questions asked, well done chap
SHEEEEEEEAAAAAAAARRRREEEERRRRRRRRR!!!!\n\nI love that man!!!\n\nStuff of dreams.........
First one I listened to twice, awesome mate!
I know the answer to his question at about 1:03:30  It may have been midweek but there were many kids there and not in school because it was August lol
fuckin hell, now get benitez and mcgregor on
you guys are way too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n smart for football,  do so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmething vital.. True geordeie is, the side kick is a moron
Georidie i fucking love ur content get rich but never change!!!! Also if u guys get a Gallagher brother on the podcast tht would be great
Awesome player, awesome bloke, Humble, Legend for both Toon and England and even though in a time of Keane, Vieira and the rest,I can honestly say I can not remember anyone and i mean domestic or International would try and fuck with this man physically cos he would fuck you up and then score again.
the last minute of the podcast made me cry :)
Brilliant interview - great insights. I picked up one error. Bobby Robson wasn't the manager for the Bowyer v Dyer incident - it was Souness.
TG ...you hit it out of the park with this one.
I'm a Sunderland fan. And I was absoloutely glued to that. Yea I couldn't stand shearer in a Newcastle shirt. But can't deny the legend that he is.
eyyyy one of our own neil maddo ! :) utb
“There’s no club bigger than Newcastle” has shearer never heard of Everton?
I clicked on this vid thinking i'll just watch it for 10 mins or so. Here I am 2 hours later. Great interview enjoyed every minute of it :) There's only 1 Alan Shearer!
Enjoyed that , thanks!!, Alan Shearaaaa Legend!
Great interview guys !!
Alan shearer like
Louis Theroux would be class to get on 👌🏻👍🏻
R
Proud of Geordie
1:34:00
Get SHOLA AMEOBI on
Great interview.
Brilliant just fucking brilliant podcast
Fav podcast ,good work
You're flying, Geordie!
Congratulations on this man, totally deserved
sweet interview!
Ricky gervais or Karl  Pickilington next
Great vid lad
R.I.P SPEEDO LEEDS LEGEND \nOHHH GARY GARY GARY GARY GARY GARY GARY SPEED
Splendid stuff lads. Up the Hammers
I was 3 when he had his testimonial match I have it on DVD he's a true inspiration
What a humble man Alan Shearer is.. He's also a straight talker, no bullshit and says exactly what he thinks. Not even a fan of Newcastle or shy of the teams he played for but so much respect for a good guy 👍\nMan I'd love a two hour podcast if you could get Paul Gascoigne on, imagine the stories he could tell lol.
Robson was not in charge at the time of the Dyer/Bowyer fight, weird Al forgot that one
The only thing this was missing is some pencils and pens. Can't make a good beat without a good pen.
That what i like for this song haha amazing😍😍😍
Background singers on point too
Bruno and Michael probably related.
The best ever! See you november 19, in Rio. ♥️
Wait until you see the SEX Tape Bruno made with Steve Harvey.. Repugnant ! You'll never guess which one was the pitcher & which one was dressed like Little Bo Peep.. swashbuckling Madness
Something about Bruno is so sexy
Please release this on iTunes

No words, what a great, creative live performance.
great execution of a great arrangement
what an inspiration Bruno and both singers with you
This is why I love this dude and his whole band, they bring it too!
Bruno and Band are amazing! They're smooth and effortless!!! Quality music from great artist of their craft! Side note: I am crushing on the singer on Brunos left , our right. <3
Wow...amazing...He's so far ahead of his generation. True talent!
Bruno Mars is the best around!
Also the only reason they are sitting is because Bruno is a midget
I like you & l Support you.\nBruno Mars

Bruno Mars is awesome artist! 24k magic is great album and this song is one of the best of it. It completely change my life and that's the reason why we need more this sort of music today!
Who's that little monkey that danced around on Kimmel?-Joey Diaz.
Is there anything this handsome man can't do.?
Im sorry i didnt ask you if u liked it bitch
This would have been better if they did an acapela version just to show off bruno's voice even more
Reppin’ the 808! Love that hat
IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE THE SONG
All i can say is 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍woooh! Bruno can only do that...hands down
I would drink your bath water Bruno
For all these autotuned ass singers please be able to sing live cause if not we know u can't sing. Bruno sounds good wit auto tune, without auto tune, he sounds great live and even better accapela so if u don't like of love Bruno mars the u on some strong ass week or coke💯💯
When its Friday and you know that the lunch is pizza...
I guess this song means he learned his lesson in *When I Was Your Man* and now treating his girl right.
Charlie Rose is such an old fuddy duddy.

I love this and the Dance Gavin Dance cover 😍
I WATCHED THIS SOO MANY TIMES
Freaking awesome. I love Bruno Mars and his band. They are #1. Patricia
This guy just always ups his game, never fails to suprise me
74k views, on trending while a video with over a million views that exposes youtubes shity attitude towards creators is not on trending. #killyoutube
Great & Awesome\n\nSubscribe, watching & download mp3 On My Channel :-D\ngoo.gl/cICvOy
The National Park remix is better
My son just can't get enough of your music he loves the beats and your style . You are a true artist ! With nothing added to your voice you have your own melody that's just so mesmerizing.  You will always continue to be a favorite in my household !
GREAT ! I LOVE IT
The guy to the right, with the grey jacket and backwards black hat is 😍. This was so good. There should be an acoustic version of every song, they always sound so good. I loved this.
And this is why I watch Charlie Rose!
Smooth. Also, glad to see Bruno packed his textbooks.
He goes Hard... But he looks like he has on makeup 😭
Bruno is one of the few pop artist I really enjoy and respect. In a world full of over produced crap and over produced polished pop stars; Bruno comes off as an actual talent and authenticly charismatic.
Best thing about this: Bruno Mars singing on a damn Sure SM 58
You really deserve that 8 AMA nominations 👏👏👏😚😚😚😘😘😘
best ever https://youtu.be/VOfkATP7Z8M
1:58 lip sync
Que voz!!! Que homem!!

I didnt know that his father was puerto rican.
I think Bruno is better than MJ

I doubt Charlie Rose has ever listened to Bruno Mars before. \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
MY only issue with Bruno is the lack of new music.
I saw him in concert a few weeks ago with my girlfriend, hands down the best live concert I have ever seen.
Most underrated artist/performer. I don't always like his songs but he is very talented and a great entertainer.
Why does Bruno has a backpack he looks like Dora the explorer
*SPOTIFY PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
I don't think this acoustic could be called as a remix, since it's still the original mix with only acoustic instruments along with smooth vocals. A remix should be for the change in the style of the original mix like pop to EDM or something
This shit got less than 100k in 24h and is on trending wtf
He needs two other people to sound good lol
Bruno probably ate his CD for breakfast
The truth still lies in the X-Files, Mulder.
hell yea i cant wait damn smoking man just die allredy and damn does scully get hotter
Every time someone says Agent Einstein' it sounds like sarcasm. Hope this season is better.
and rain pours down in vancouver, ha ha ha
I really hope Season 11 is going to have the creepy spooky chilling vibe of the first six seasons, because the seasons 7-10 were so awful.
Scully dies at the end of this season
No more of those younger agents PLEASE! They were annoying and charismaless af.
no lot call officially makeup throat rub mayor pig talented wisdom.
British guideline matter bfhwl succeed own hungry landing both prime.
I don't like this, Skinner meeting with CSM.
The trailer looks amazing! So looking forward to season 11!
Finally more x-files.. the wait was to long..
Awe man! It's on! Can't wait
I loved that they brought the series back but it's almost it's own parody with some episodes. It's not dark like it was in the past. The fish man episode with the fake sex scene with Agent Scully really turned me off too last season. I mean when have they ever done anything like that with her character???
They all look great! Wow
That theme song never gets old.
makes me wanna take a knee
the rabbit hole just got a lot deeper than expected
Don't these two people hate each other in real life?
The X-Files, guaranteed to have more facts than fox news.
I love everything I just saw....everything...even the fact that they showed the same cut of Mulder looking around a corner twice to fill out the trailer.....
I’m the only one who’s watching this over and over again?
What cover of Zombie is that in the trailer? Should be a federal law to provide that lmao.
*HOLY SHIT THAT INTRO SENDS CHILL DOWN MY SPINE*
If Mulder and Scully were real people they would have gone insane by now from everything they've experienced in The X files but there not real people so who care's, they almost die in nearly every episode but they carry on 'Where are we going too this week Mulder?'
Love how both of you took a knee to support the NFL protest... JK you're dead to me now I destroyed my XFiles DVDs. I loved that show but seeing you two sell out like that.
0:47 stop right there I'm in \nI need friends
Who is the artist of the song we hear please? I love the version!
Uh huh, taking a knee, too, I almost don't want to watch. They don't realize how incredibly lucky they are to live in a country where you can get as stinking rich as these two, oh wait, she doesn't live here. Fuck off Anderson. Stick to movies. Besides, is she taking a knee against all the terror in Londonistan? I didn't think so.
♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n*This Is True Love!!!  (Just ask Him)*
The Alien at the and is like Dude, what the fuck?
2:04 nice! I love the flashback scenes.
So fucking excited for this!
Cigarette Smoking man turns out to be an alien in disguise who's been observing human activity!
This trailer looks better than all of the 10th season.
Does anyone know the link to this exact song cover?? Sounds like Corvyx but its not it...
Someone needs to get cigarette man a vape cigarette.
For those saying that Gillian is quitting after this season I did read that is not 100 hundred def if they decide to make and have a 12th season be the final one for sure and since the season will end on a cliffhanger it's still most likely to have a 12th season even without her as they did when David left for the original final season. Maybe they could bring back Doggett and Reyes or something but if there will be another season without Gillian it won't be as good of course but I just want it to actually finish with more closure than season 9 had
Cigarette Smoking Man is my favorite Character... I miss The Syndicate. The depopulation agenda never fails! 👌🏻😁
This isn't my X-Files.
ayy lmao's :D good i like / Excited for new episodes <3
i'm so excited to have this show back on
She gets hotter with age. Was my FHM UK pin up in the 90s when I was 17 & if my wife would allow me to have pin ups now, she would be now I'm 38. I never saw the last mini season & I thought the last movie was crap. This looks promising. I thought the way they finished the original was just right, but what a way to add to this new golden age of TV by putting in one of the shows that started epic episodic TV storytelling.
i hope the kill scully off
The end is near.
Wait a miniute mulder and scully' boy is allien???!!!
How is the smoking man still alive? He should've died from lung cancer decades ago.
Pause at 2:08\nOh... my... God.
Finally going back to orginial movie, the aliens are coming
I can’t wait! 👽
Oh, everyone is so old now... Only Scully is eternal beauty:)
well this was an nice surprise.
Holy s***! THIS! LOOKS! A.W.E.S.O.M.E.!!!!
Finally! I new it that will be next season. Can't wait.
Does Scully still not believe shit Mulder tells here like in the earlier series?
They Where Kneeling With The NFL So No More X-Files For Me and They Where On Jimmy  Cunt Kimmel
I'm watching this on the bus and looking like a crazy person because I'm just fangirling WAY too hard 😂😭😭
I really hate the alien invasion crap, so I hope there will be some good monster of the week episodes. I love when they just investigate paranormal stuff.
I've been watching the original X-FILES SINCE 1993-2002. AND in the recent episodes over a year ago. I always loved the X-FILES. This new series should be awesome.
https://youtu.be/c1_4SNLT2sk  Não sei se isso te interessa  Você se lembra deste video ?😊
Dreck
Holy crapitty dapitty..was that Alex Krycek who just got hit at 2:08???
Alex Krycek?
Dam scully is looking fine
Bad old smoky.
omg YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
Отлично! Хорошая новость!
scullys got some moves at 50

Hank Moody. Californication > X files.

Can’t wait
On season one 😂
Goosebumps
Trust no one
fox=666
They put everything in these shows and movies to show you exactly what they are going to do. Trust God! Call on him and today tomorrow is not promised. BELIEVE on the Lord  the he died and was buried for our sins and rose 3 days later. 1 Corinthians 15:3-4
Too bad the actors knelt in support of athletes who publicly disrespected the Flag.    If I boycott the NFL for spitting on the graves and sacrifices of our service members, then I boycott a show that I have watched since day one.  Too bad, it literally was one of my favorite shows.  Since day one.  If you want to protest, do not do it supporting the desecration of our Flag and Anthem, especially when it is based on lies and you are protesting the wrong people.
Does anyone know if the music from this trailer is available? Or the name of it?
Omg this song is just as astonishing as Nobody's Empire 😍
Just can't stop listening to it <3
Cool that the best band in the world announce their new project on International Mental Health Day. I LOVE B&S <3
Even a brand new song by you evokes a strong feeling of nostalgia in me 💛
I love how they can go back to their roots or evolve, but they never loose that beautiful characteristic sound.
So I made the cover of this EP, the good looking one in the hat..
Reminds me of the music from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocd1D8fwdjU
Amazing work as always guys. Love it!
Belle and Sebastian is Back!! *-* ..
I'M IN LOVE
dig the song! here's a brief write-up we did about it https://zumic.com/ill-be-your-pilot-belle-and-sebastian-youtube-audio-single
I just loved it!
OMG new song!!  I love it
Can't wait to hear more!
Such a sweet song! Love you Belle and Sebastian 😚😍😘
Again the kind of music I put on at night and lay in the dark thinking of nothing but the music and the imagery it provokes <3 thank you for making my life better, b&s!!!
This is not nostalgia, it’s just a band doing the usual, without being affected by the poor music changes from the last 15 years
Beutiful 😍 Love it 😊 Come to Mexico someday please :3
It's just so lovely  and relaxing
❤❤❤❤❤ Thank u for making this
Man, this is beautiful.
it's like i'm watching life in a movie
omg I'm so excited! I love it! Thank you, Belle and Sebastian!
Wow! New sweet music of my favorite band!!! Love it! Thanx!
I love you, guys.
Ich liebe Euch. Greetings from BVB-City.
💖💖💖💖
I love this! <3
love LOVE love.
Sublime
Yaaay! :)
great work
damm this is sweet
Nice try to retrieve some of your original sound. Utter failure though, atmosphere is lacking.
yikes not a great trailer for a probably incredible series
Is it me or this trailer is just too noisy. It seemed like I was playing another video at the background whole time playing this.The dialogues and the music was just too much I guess.
Wrong choice of music for psychological horror.
Anna Torv 😍
I'm confident this will be great, but the music choice really fucked this trailer over.
I am beyond ready for this.
Wait for stranger things wil be less painful now.
Im very excited for this series, it has great potential, but this is a shit trailer
David Fincher is a great thriller director
These are the types of shows that I subscribe to netflix for.... Not the last 50 netflix shows that I never would watch... Good,  highly entertaining shows like this one are the reason I will continue to subscribe.... Take these away\n... My money goes away! 😯
I loved the first trailer (teaser) but this one, not so much... I'm still looking forward to the release of this series though!
Jonathan Groff and Anna Torv, friday come soon!
the music was really not well suited for this trailer
aaaa groffsauce 💕
What about the Punisher?
Friday the 13th this coming out!
*G R O F F S A U C E*
That Jonathan can Groff me all night.
The song just didn't work, but just look at Groffsauce. Ugh, I'm so not ready, I might even cry. Hopefully I do so.
I'm tired of cop series. (Investigation, crimes and witness. I'm full of this. )\nI love Netflix, but cop series is boring.\nBut, Star Track Discovery Is simple amazing I'm waiting to the next episode.
WOW! A whopping 100k views?!! I can definitely see why this is trending. Its totally just suuuuuper popular and not just youtube making deals behind closed doors.
this trailer is so bad hahahaa still great potential on the series
The Cinematography has David Fincher written all over it
His name is Robert Pulson
It’s the Three Kings guy ! “Where the hell did all this booze come from ?”
I'm sure the show will be great but yikes, this trailer sucks.  Whoever is in charge of promoting Mindhunter should be fired.
Bad trailer for a probably great show.
I like the dopplar effect like title
Anybody notice that this Oct 13th will be on Fridayyyy 👻👻👻👻
David Fincher and Charlize Theron is on Producer of this show. Will be great.
Let's hope it will not become another disaster...
Silent Killer Soundtrack and a new David Fincher Show, already in love.
another buddy cop what a bore
feature length or series? either way it looks great.
Can't wait to see it.

who chose the music for this trailer?  terrible.
First trailer was a lot better
Anyone know what serial killers will be featured? i can see obviously Ed kemper, Jerry Brudos, Richard speck and a shot of BTK in the last trailer, thats all i can tell.
Another show that glamorizes serial killers in some fashion
the track song ? Please
So like can we just call trending page what it is? Paid Promotion. k thanks.
Maybe I'm just super excited to get any new clips at all, but I don't think this trailer is so bad. I did like the first trailer better, but I'm guessing Netflix is trying to advertise to a different crowd with this one. The first trailer was for people who like psychological horror, this one is for people who like comedy. Looks like there's a nice mix of both dark and comedic elements in the show - I'm so psyched for this!
What a garbage trailer! Doesn't convey the theme at all like the first one did! Netflix should be embarrassed! Gonna be a great show but please do it justice by advertising properly
It's like they googled songs with psycho killer in the lyrics and went with the first song they saw... fucking idiots need firing.
+👍
Wow...👌👌🎤🎧👌👍
So many Zodiac vibes
Amazing
So hyped

What went wrong : the music is throughout the entire video and the tone doesn't fit, there's someone constantly talking, no breather, the scenes cut way too fast and there's no comprehensible flow. A trailer with mostly no talking and longer shots with no singing would've been better
Oh my god that is the worst fucking trailer...and that music? Dear lord I think I've turned off some people by recommending this. I'll use the old trailer, thanks.
Any other murderinos super excited for this??
waiting and waiting 4 days to go !!!! yayyyy!!!!!
It's beyond me why shows like this not get the hype they deserve.
wildly different trailer than one before. what's up with this music?
Been waiting for this one. Hope it is as good as I think it is going to be.
I can't wait
52 thousand views and it's on trending. Ya, ok. Nice ad YouTube.
David Fincher, Yeah!
ugly trailer
How much you paid them netflix
who can tell me а name of the song playing on background? pls
Only on  Netflix Ha ! I don't think so
Wtf is the plot
Is that harvey from suits?
Okay, is this a series or a movie, because it honestly looks like it could be either
I thought this was another Hannibal Lector show
Wait..no one told me that this show was a weird FBI Seth Rogen inspired comedy..I didn't sign up for that
That's Friday, yessss

OMG these interviews are hilarious 😆 Amalah is the Queen of spin, she answers no questions, but has you talking about firefighters👩🏽‍🚒 Priceless 😂
Next time someone asks me something that I don't want to reveal, I'll counter with what color is a firefighter? 😂😂😂
Amalah never did answer the question about the boys names!!!🤣🤣🤣
My daughter is in preK this year--she's one of 3 girls in a class of about 12-15. Yup, that's 3 girls and 9-12 boys. Her besties are all boys. Only down side is them teaching her to root for the wrong team--she came home today cheering for the Buckeyes when we're a Bobcat family! Austie [Austin] taught me that is apparently enough explanation. LOL.
I love any video you guys make!!!!!!!
I love this as usual... keep up the amazing work
Well that's what she got!!!! 😂
She's getting so articulate in her words! I love this smart little lady!
Great job, Baby!!! So proud of you, Malah! 😀❤😀
Before I force you to drop out of preschool......lol #rofl
So much entertainment hahahah love this family 🙌🏻🙌🏻
She changing the subject man. She's not answering your question at all ......HO! NO NO  pls ,  don't fall for her cute smile. I'M JUST JOKING......... THE SAME WAY I TALK MY DAUGHTER EVERY TIME . MAY  GOD BLESS  YOU AND YOUR FAMILY ,
This is the cutest thing ever

Dude,I was drinking something when you ask about getting something from school and your Nooooo's  are classic, i almost chocked and spit liquid everywhere....I can't take it I'm dead at pretty much every video.
There MUST be something that you got from preschool....😥😥😥🚫🚫🚫...😷💫...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I died when he sprayed her at the end
I must humbly disagree, that was an incredible crocodile.  I was terrified for a moment
When he started dancing 😂😂
Is it selfish of me to say that I don't want her to grow up... She just perfect
Yeah she differently caught that cold from preschool it seems like my daughter has had a different one every week and she only started a month ago her first week she had one and I'm sure it was that little boy with that runny nose!
*There has to be something you got from preschool COUGH COUGH nooooooooo* 😂😂😂😂
Let me be messy.....she got that cough from a boy....he he he
2:40 that is so cute I forgot to count how many times I watched it.
This made me feel good and blessed 😂💙💕😇keep up the blessing seriously ☺️
before I force you to drop out of preschool.... 😂😂
The Ending Tho When She Coughed 😂 Keep Up The Great Content My Guy. She'll Have So Much To Look Back On & Laugh At When She's Older
I can't stop watching the dance 😂😂😂
Amahlah has a crush on a guy
Great great job! I really enjoy it!
AMALAH is such a beautiful little girl. she has matured (???) so much within the past 6 months. My niece was beautiful like Amalah at that age ( still is) and one little boy gave her his mother's ring!!!!! She was in kindergarten!!!!. Seriously Amalah dodges direct questions like a skilled politician. Maybe she will grow up to become President.  Nayele (although not in this video) is such a skilled and articulate communicator, she will probably grow up to become another Oprah Winfrey. You and Leah have two beautiful, adorable and very intelligent little girls.
Payback from throwing my baby on the bed and hitting her with bread is a bucket of water to the face!!! Git 'em Amalah!!!
well it looks like someone is about to make a school visit lol
Well at least she didnt distract you with the finger song!! We all know how much you looooove that song!! hahahaha
Yep- I've been a victim of that Toddler distraction trick when my kids were young and now my grandkids try it on me ! They're so cute tho !
I died when she told you that you're talking too much!!! Almost peed when the water was thrown on you!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
My favorite part has to be the very end.... lol you are so silly...
That's all school is until about the 5th grade: germ cesspool 🤒😷🤧🤢 Thanks for the laffs!
Hilarious! The cough says it all. Welcome to shared germs. :-)
I love how he broke charavter and everything to make his point about her only knowing the boys names.
Amalah is a pro now
This is the truth as if Jesus himself wrote it. Children only bring home illnesses and heartbreak from school. TRUTH!
Too cute. I really love your videos
Yup that's what they get from school
Love love love y'all.  Too funny!!
AS MUCH AS I LOVE BEING ABLE TO WATCH AMALAH GROW UP I WILL MISS HER PLANS TO TAKE OVER THE WORld😭😭😭😭✌🏽
How could anyone hate this? They are so funny XD

Nein! Nein! Nein! Can you get a Jew shekel in any of the loot crates?
Honestly video games should be free if developers are going introducing crappy loot boxes in them. There no reason for developers to be greedy by charging more people for the game.
This shit will be free on ea access in no time
there is gonna be alot of afk people just grinding credits
lol don't buy it then... They need your purchase to have a job. You don't have to pay them to live. Players always got the upper hand.
Just boycott the f*cking pay to win system. Maybe even buying these games, untill then they are the ones in control...
Such a great game, sadly i wont be getting this because of this shady ass practice. Same with Shadow Of War which REALLY  pisses me off
Simple solution:\nDon't buy the game if you don't like micro transactions.\nI pre-ordered the $79.99 edition and have literally no intentions to play online, just custom private modes with my girlfriend (not my hand).\nThe actual game will also likely be much different than the beta, but either way I'm not worried. I'm buying it to casually play, not to be the best competitor online. I'm sure there's plenty of other people like me buying it for the same reason.\nChill out, kids. Let the free market do its job.
You should probably check out their feedback article, they just basically said it's not P2W and they're going to balance the system. All this ranting was over a beta build, not the full game.
The obvious thing to do is not buy any game with these mechanics, it's simple. I don't buy them and I don't feel like I'm missing that much as I already have games that I can play without this bullshit.
This shit needs to be illegal. It's unregulated gambling.
Anyone who supports this needs to take a long hard think about what ea are doing.\nIf this goes through most if not all games will do it.\nDont buy the game....iam definately not buying battlefront 2!
If that’s the case, which I hope not because this is a beta and could be subject to change. That would be the dumbest decision ever made by EA, I know dice is having their hand forced by those greedy corporate fucks. EA has to make up for the plain Jane battlefront we got. If they choose to go this route for progression in a 60 dollar game, they will sure lose my support and the support of many others. I haven’t preordered this game and won’t, and I will for sure cancel my EA access and do my best to avoid any game published EA if they pull this fuckery
After watching this video, I think it’s safe to say that people can stop bitching about loot systems in other games now. Especially CoD (which now is completely fair).
You can also get guns in loot boxes
There's still hope. Our outrage changed the always online DRM. And our outrage destroyed Diablo 3's auction house
I just don't understand.  The ultimate goal of a corporation is to make as much money as possible, so why does EA make stupid decisions that'll piss off their consumers?  Did they really think they could slap a campaign mode onto a free-to-play game, charge *full retail price* for it, and get off scot-free?  Holy shit.  Whoever came up with the idea of making a $60 game pay-to-win needs to be fired, ASAP.
Check the lates new about it In other words, you whiny bitches can suck it.
Hey guys look at the bright side Red Dead 2 by rockstar is coming out soon.
I was actually considering buying this game (unlike the first Battlefront), but I'm once again repulsed from the idea.
Star Wars use to be a great franchise before the Disney take over. Like if pumping out shitty new movies wasn't bad enough, they close down lucasarts and of course pick one of the greediest companies (EA) to publish their games, because obviously that's were the money is at. I never thought I would find myself hating this franchise as much as I do now.
Well this game won't be getting my support/money, do not support these greedy publishers. This will be EA's downfall.
Well the hobby is dead it was fun while it lasted maybe I will take up rock collecting...
I'm going to try my best to make this unpopular OPINION of mine as concise and to the point as possible.\n\nNow that EA has stopped its premium/season pass marketing strategy and decided to give us a $60 game with possibly game unbalancing micro transactions, is it a PAY TO WIN game? To me, it is not. How I look at this is that for the people who have the money to spend buying loot crates, then do so. The only thing a player can get by spending real money is just a CHANCE OF WINNING THE DAMN RNG, which is not pay to win. The RNG factor is still there for the people who pays, so even if they spend money they might not be lucky enough to win the things they want whereas people who grind to get the crates might have already won them.\n\nFor me, Pay to win is when you can spend money to ACTUALLY BUY the items.\n\nWhat EA did here is to not split the community with a paid pass and also not to LOCK the additional contents behind a paid pass, which to me is already good enough because this means that everybody has access to all its contents, and depending on a player's luck in gambling the loot.\n\nComparatively, if you look at their marketing strategy for Battlefield games, they split the community AND LOCK the contents behind a paid pass and to me that's even more like a pay to win game than this Battlefront. In Battlefield, some of the DLC guns are significantly better (especially in BF1). The DLC tanks are also much better. These DLC contents give paid players considerable amount of advantage over those without the pass. THE WORST THING about this is that, players without the pass can never be able to get the stronger DLC contents whatsoever unless they pay for the pass or DLC.\n\nIn Battlefront 2, none of the contents are behind paid pass and so even if a player is out-equipped due to the other player wearing stronger cards, it wouldn't be long for that player to get the card and compete on even grounds.\n\nAlso, the grinding aspect should never be a problem in games (if you truly love the game) because why would anyone complain about getting to play more of a game that they love? This really puzzles me.
They Just took the Gears of War 4 micro-transaction system and pasted it in the game.  600 to craft something decent 2400 for a legendary. Lol games are turning to shit now. LAME
Thanks for video, definitely won’t be getting this.
I played it.. and the loot crate system is so freaking bad its infuriating!
Gambling in game should be banned by the law. This is clear exploitation of young players and their parents. It's disgusting.
and you know this isn't dices' idea.  this shit has ea written all over it.  f*&king ea strikes again.  they must love being voted the worst company over and over again.
Jet pack damage? The fuck is this? Team Fortress rocket jumping?
Funny thing to note and I truly do not care for those people who will support this bullshit game. You deserve everything that's coming to you.\nCase in point the game is Always Online and is primarily run with servers and during your playtime all of a sudden when EA loses the rights to Star Wars one day EA will be forced to shutdown the 2017 Star Wars Battlefront 2 servers and all of that money you had spent via the Microtransactions/Lootboxes will be for nothing and all you have left is a physical cup coaster that can no longer be played online thus you lose all of that cosmetic/cards that you had opened via a Lootbox and your overall game progression.Wake up and smell the fucking coffee. These Companies do not care about you. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BULLSHIT.\nAny AAA game with Lootboxes as of from now and for the foreseeable future must be boycotted.Refuse to buy into this anti-consumer bullshit.
ea sport= enter anally suckers. this is a ganranty flop and will proove that ea is the next big one to fail
We need to stop referring to any sort of RNG as a functioning mechanic in these loot crate games. There is nothing random about how gear and abilities are doled out. The developer is in full control of the numbers and equations being executed behind the curtain, and is therefore in full control of the rewards a player may or may not receive. Loot crate rewards are engineered to appear completely arbitrary, but actual drop rates are most assuredly determined and fixed by the folks who code the game (at the behest of their bosses, naturally). Believe me now, or wait until someone else who has worked on the back-end of one of these games comes clean about what's REALLY going on. Your choice.\n\nPeople compare opening loot crates in a video game to pulling the handle on a Vegas slot machine. The only way this is even halfway true is if the machine has been programmed to hit on a timed basis, which is not entirely how slot machines work. Slots do utilize RNG's, which are sometimes (at least in larger Casinos) tied into a master controller that determines hit rates on banks of slot machines. By comparison, loot crate games simply use formulas that are specifically engineered to grant minor rewards while withholding the most valuable ones from any given asset pool at a disproportionately high rate in order to encourage additional investment from people who are either stupid or addicted to the process.\n\nIOW, you're not playing a loot crate game. The loot crate game is playing you. At least go to Vegas and have some real fun in between episodes of throwing your money away.
Joe, have you seen EA's response to the Loot Crate concerns?
You should make a new video to their response to all of this
You look pretty foolish now Joe
If people are sick of it then DO NOT BUY THE GAME.
Great video. Joe's a good dude for pointing this out to the community, thanks man. Now, onto the bullshit. Fuck EA, this is ludicrous. I am so fucking happy I saw this, not buying it! BTW...Classic Battlefront 2 servers are up.
I couldn't even get passed the users agreement... Fuck You EA!
Anakin: My trust in EA has been shaken...\nPalpatine: Why? They did something that you thought was dishonest didn't they... They asked you to buy loot crates, didn't they.\nAnakin: I ugh, I don't know what to say...\nPalpatine: Remember back to your Battlefield 4, 1 and Battlefront EA...All who gain hype, are afraid to lose it, even the gamers.\nAnakin: The EA use their marketing power for screw jobs, they think inwards only about themselves...\nPalpatine: And the gamers don't?\nAnakin: The gamers are selfless, they only care about good gaming...
I have a feeling that nothing is going to change.  People will pay for the latest games no matter what and the gaming industry will make money hand over fist.  This is the new normal.
Fellas,the loot boxes won't give you an automatic advantage if you buy them.It's still random.You're all incompetent of learning anything if you seriously see free everything in a $60 game with online multiplayer as a focus and no way to make money after.It's like selling someone all your drugs and you get an average amount of money,but then that's it.Nothing more.
So good news to people who are concerned about the Microtransactions for Battlefront 2. It’s only for Cards, Emotes and Skins. You can still earn these in game. Weapons are only for game progression so no pay to win on that.\n\nEdit: even if you get a card lucky for spending real world money, you have to still play the game and level up in order to use it. \n\nThey also addressed the Flametrooper lol
I was disappointed when I found the loot crates.
I stopped playing games for probably over 6months now. I use to play blizzard games, and when I came back to games about two days ago, I see that Heroes of the Storm has gone to something kind of similar to this. I hate it. You have to open so many boxes before you get the one thing you actually want. So you have to sift through so much crap before you get anything you even remotely want. I was gone from Heroes for months, so when I got back on I had 29loot boxes, 15 epic, and 1 legendary. Out of all those boxes I got two skins I use to have before the new system went into play and 2 heroes I already had. Then, ontop of that crap pile, they make you pay gold to reroll and when you reroll you aren't guaranteed any type of quality value. So if you reroll two legendary items because you already have them, you could roll all common crap afterwards.
It's such a flawed system. If there's no incentive to do well in a match because we all get the same amount of credits, then why should I try to power up in the game??? Therefore there's no reason to play 😂
Why is everyone saying 60$ 80 in Canada
Stop purchasing these games, therefore stop supporting their practices.
Please make a new video on the statement EA released, its promising I think
my main issue with the beta is if I can get into a fucking game literally only played like 5 matches and couldn't connect to another match the rest of the time the beta was open
That's it. NOBODY buy EA products for a long time until they straighten up....
Ty angry joe not preordering or buying it for the matter. if i want f2p style I'll stick to SWHotG
Gaming is dead and has been so since next Gen emerged. gaming has gone the way of Christmas and is thoroughly commercialized meaning its all about the money so don't expect much and become familiar with the term cash grab
I love star wars. It WAS my childhood. But these mfs (EA) want to poison it. Boycotting EA til this shits over. Will i miss some great game, yes but i will not be robbed by this STD (microtransactions) riddled bs.
I'm saving my money. All these games with this sort of platform just won't get any money from me. I'm happy right now playing one game. Elite Dangerous done. (Until Red Dead 2 lol)
So will he make a video or respond about EAs response? We will see.
The only way these companies will listen is if players start to vote with their wallet. If you really want the game, just wait and get it used.
I don't think loot boxes will be that big of an issue. You have a slight advantage for a few weeks, then it's fairly even. Cash won't keep up with people who know how to play the game
The most common defence for this shit that I'm hearing is: But the micro-transactions are funding the free content that'll be released in the future!\n...\nWell then it's not free content is it, you mouthbreathers?! >:(
Disappointing, loot crates are gambling and they are ruining the gaming industry. If i remember correctly someone said this game had no dlc cause they didn't want to divide the player base. well guess what loot crate advancement and progression is gonna divide the player base and they are gonna lose players. well done EA well done.
It's very simple, DON'T BUY THE GAME.
So I guess you’d rather have an expansion pass? I’d rather have these little loot boxes than having to buy map packs.
Would EA have removed the crates if no one complained about it though? Its just an option select. If people complain they remove it, and if they dont they leave them in there.
Honestly if I had to choose between this or paying for DLC, I'd rather pay for the DLC. Because at least that, even if they charge it at bullshit prices, doesn't fuck with the games balancing. This on the other hand forces your hand constantly and eventually your patience will wear thin to where you'll either you'll cave in and pay up for the loot crates or just walk away. GTA online did that to me and I  (aside from recently) haven't touched it for 2 years
Can we collectively boycott all games with  loot boxes that aren't exclusively cosmetic? At least until these asshats are forced to change. You vote with your dollar. STOP VOTING FOR  SHIT.
Does dale have a youtube channel?
Loot boxes need to be regulated by the government, seeing as how this scam is nothing more than poorly-disguised gambling.
TBH I don’t think this well be a problem cause this game is so addicting that grinding it to get loot boxes won’t be a problem for me at least, this is way better then paying for dlc that’s 50 dollars anyway. There’s so much content in the game that I’ll be playing this for hrs
I don't understand why people don't understand that everyone needs to have a level playing field in fps games. It That is the ONLY good way to make a good fps that can survive long term. Look at battlegrounds, possible one of successful first iterations of a shooter ever. In it there are no uneven starts. You literally start with nothing.  It's like developers don't understand how to make successful games anymore.
What a let down. Was really looking forward to this one :-(
I don't buy any game now with micro transactions no matter how much I want to play them. So no battlefront 2 or middle earth shadow war for me. Hate greed and pay to win. It just needs to stop and people who feed these games money are just the cancer of gaming.
We are doomed if People actually Buy these things... AHHHHHHHH
generation facebook ruined my favorite hobby
Unlocked a victory pose....NIEN NIEN NIEN NIEN!!!
Mak a engry revue you lazi turmite
Whats your psn joe
From angry to hater!
Battle front is garbage
At least Titanfall 2 only has cosmetics.
Awesome game but crappy loot boxes
Not gonna buy it.
So skilled players are punished.
the next big game crash is coming people. it's no longer what if it's when cause it's only a matter of time.
Games should be forced to have a rating of A for adult in order to have these supply drops. It's bad for games that are cosmetic like overwatch, but it would make developers think twice about making what this mess of a game has brought us.
they are giving away free dlc for battlefront. what did u expect??? they got to make thier money back somehow black ops 3 dlc isnt free thats why its not as bad
New response from EA that is very promising pls view it and address it in some way.
Want to play the game ? Buy a loot box First :/
Motherfuckers have been going to shit for long now and people get still getting SCAMMED. WAKE THE FUCK UP!
WE NEED TO KILL THE JEWS RUNNING THIS FUCKING GAMES. \n\nHITLER WAS RIGHT
This loot crate system reminds me a lot EA sport games
They should do it like CSGO. Im sure that they can implement a bunch of nice skins into the game.
Remember when Star Wars Battlefront was just basic? No cards, no loot boxes, just a good old ammo and medic droid. Good times, good times.
EA just came out today from the feedback announcing that the loot box system in the game will not be like how it is in the beta
I'm reminded of something Jim Sterling once said (if I remember correctly). If you are charging money for boxes that advance character progression, you are saying that NOT playing your game has a monetary value. You're saying that the experience of playing your game is something people should pay money to avoid, because unlocking things through playing the game is too tedious. \nThat is a failure of game design, although it's no secret they intentionally make things tedious to try and frustrate you into buying shit.\n\nPretty soon, DICE will be just another successful developer that EA sucked dry, and threw away.
EA's Mass Effect Andromeda had a loot crate system like this. It took about 1 hour to get a good quality loot box, and then you needed to get the same character card or gun TEN TIMES before it had its full stats unlocked, and there was about 40 cards to a rarity set. It was impossible to unlock everything through normal play too because EA kept adding things to the loot pool, and then made it so that each item had TWENTY TIERS instead of ten. Basically the loot pool required you to get one card 20 times from a pool of about 60 cards after the second month, and that was at a pull rate of 2 cards per hour with 4 rarity sets.
thsi game is a failer
the problem is not EA or others, but the level of stupidity by the consumers. they just eat that shit up, so it will keep happening. if you pay for shit, you keep getting shit. easy
Thanks Joe! Keep us informed about shit like that!
You don't know what to do about it? It's pretty easy actually- DON'T BUY THIS FUCKING GAMES.
I was extremely disappointed about the Loot Crates. But... my worries have been set aside. EA has made an official release about how you can only get stuff from loot crates you've unlocked through progression. You can look it up, it set aside my worries.\nIf you're still worried, it's better than expensive DLC.

What are your thoughts on Mike Ditka's comments?
Mike Ditka in real life is a asshole..Thats saying it nicely..Hes rude to everyone
Name an oppression in the last 100 years and I'll show you first world problems
Mike Ditka needs to have his name pulled from the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  No one who's that ignorant and foolish should hold that honor.
It wasn't just blacks that were oppressed 100 years ago. So were women, so were catholics and so were other immigrants as well. Look it up Protestants 100 years ago were oppressing catholics up to WW2 pretty much.
The NFL is dying and this idiot is helping to throw dirt on it!
the true racists are showing there faces.
When Mike Ditka screwed Hof Walter Payton on the 1yard line in the 85 Superbowl I knew he was a clown.
There has been no oppression in the last 100 years...., says the white guy.😳
Looks like Mike Ditka finally came out as being ignorant  as FUCK...who knew?!
Dick head is a Trump supporter...enough said. This bastard wasn't shit as a coach, and ain't shit as a human. He has been a racist bastard way back when..the hell with him
Ditka is a racist bigot, always has been.
Just another dumb ass stupid racist Trump supporter...He has said stupid shit before...No surprise...Trump and Ditka went to the same old racist school...
SCREW YOU SMITH...YOU ARE A SERIOUS JOKE !!  AS LONG AS EVERYONE AGREES WITH YOU AND THE OTHERS .....THOSE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE HEARD??? JOKE....FREEDOM OF SPEECH BROTHER....AND WHEN WILL THESE PEOPLE CHOOSE THE PLIGHT OF THEM IS OVER....ENOUGH ALREADY!!
shove it up the ass of POLITICALLY CORRECTNESS...FOR IT IS 'ANTI CHRIST'...........THE FLAG HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHOM YOU ARE..........GOD CREATED YOU......NOT THE PIECE OF CLOTH THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO MAKE UNDERWEAR ...............DECIDE NOW......WORSHIP A PIECE OF CLOTH (the flag).....or WORSHIP 'GOD'!!!
I wish Walter was still here to slap the shit out of ditka
I was 7yrs old when over the PA System, the segregated school I attended, were informed as to the assignation of Dr. King...a few days later I watch his funeral in TV.  I guess Coach Ditka, being 20+ years older then I...missed those events...
There is no institutional oppression
Damn he ever heard of the civil rights movement
Mike Ditka is an ignorant man, overrated as a coach (Buddy Ryan was the driving force behind the defense which made The Bears great) To prove the point, this idiot gave up all the Saints draft picks to draft Ricky Williams. He's a not to bright and was overrated in his profession. (in my opinion)
Disregardong the fact that u speak like a secondhand witness how did poles work harder outnumber 3 to 1 out manned physically by bigger stronger black men who it can be historically proven were force fed narcotic stimulants like cocain to keep them on 20 hours days do some research son.
Thank You it is a disgrace for intelligent men white men in mostly as Mike D. Now Trump we know is stupid in all understanding But please. stop showing us who you are.
STEPHEN A SMITH IS THE MOST BOOT  LICKING NIGGER I HAVE EVER SEEN ..
he was wrong for saying 100 yrs lol its been more like 30 yrs but other than tht he didnt say anything wrong
Leave this old hag along he got cte,Alzheimer's,dementia
Ditka is a dick..............................OK, I should not have called Ditka a dick, I should have called him an ignorant racist dick.
Fuck Mike Ditka forever and his family! Why explain to that pos that something racist has happened in the past 100 years? He know that he's lying he's just a pos and should be dealt with as such!
Fuck them racist black Americans! Get 'em Mike!
Mike Ditka is a true representation of old white racist. He is the epitome of turning a blind eye and deaf ear to reality. True racist pretend like racism does not exist. They are programmed to deny any accusations of racism or mistreatment...deny, deny, deny and continue to deny and lie, thats the racist model.
So how many NFL players and blacks under 50 dealt with the 60's racism?  Oh yeah NONE. Why are blacks undereducated....go to inner cities and go to their schools and see for yourself and STOP LYING saying they are being oppressed. NO, they are choosing gang life, thug life, rap life, drugs, guns, 30 rims, gold fronts, ebonics, and BS over sitting in class paying attention. The black culture oppresses themselves with their uncle tom labels or violence against black who don't want to participate in the popular crap culture. 99.9% of blacks in the U.S. have never nor will ever set foot on African soil, let alone were born there, yet they continue to label themselves AFRICAN American, while no one else can try to create Scottish American, Irish American, Italian American, French American groups to circumvent and abuse their rights. Bottom line, yes, blacks USED to have it shitty thanks to some very narrow minded people who didn't want them to succeed, but even in that time, blacks could succeed because of others who knew they were human too. These days its all an excuse to act like a lazy thug who feels they deserve something based on skin color and affirmative action proved that over and over. White guy scores a 94% on a firemens test, Black man scores 68%....depending on where this job is located, the minority gets the job so the department LOOKS more diverse, who cares about qualification when our society now demands people be given something they didn't earn!  Also, most of these retards who kneel are kneeling for criminals who deserved what they got. Armed robbers, rioters, strong arm robbers, shot by police for their actions, not because they were black. The stupidity on these shows is overwhelming. Black or white, everyone has the same rights these days, same opportunities...difference is one culture WANTS to work for it, another only some do...the rest want to blame slavery from 200 years ago so they can be useless no good scum and blame others for their spoiled ways.
I so wanted to hear Will Cain's opinion on this!
Max is such a brown nose to the black race
I bet he won't get suspended like Jemele Hill.
What a surprise.... white guy says there has been no oppression...
Do Mike Ditka know that if Emmit Till was still living today they are not that far apart in age?
i read a tweet today that said that emmit till would have been the same age that mike ditka is now had he not been murdered for being a black kid whistling at a white woman..  at 14 years old... so yes mr ditka.. there has been oppression in the last 100 years.. A LOT of it...
Mike didn’t miss anything, he feels that black Americans should be treated that way, so for him it doesn’t matter. No adult human being could justify that type of ignorance!
First i will start with these articles form the pass to the present and Mike Dicka's is an old school bigot!!! I dear you to look at these articles and if you do you will see why Mike is s wrong with his hundred years nonsense comments. \n1. Black men soldiers \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSZTHGOGA0Y&feature=youtu.be\n2. Fire Chief racist remarks  keep in mind he has the posistion to hir and fire people.\nhttp://bleacherreport.com/articles/2735250\n3. City commissioner racist remarks can also hire and fire \nhttp://m.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/article_e959f208-a3a8-11e7-a5d1-1f47d3cd06b6.html?mode=jqm\n4. The Mike Bennett incident \nhttps://www.si.com/nfl/2017/09/29/police-video-michael-bennett-las-vegas\nthe list goes on and on. so when people say black people is playing the race card think twice before you speak, if it doesn't not effect you directly you dont know what other people are dealing with every day.
Max is always on point.
Oppression hasn't happened to just black people. What do you call the ND pipeline protests?
Mike Ditka needs to die. In a matter of fact all racist whites from that generation need to die. That includes Jerry Jones. Fuck him and fuck racism!!!!!!!!!!!
He didn't know because he was living his life. Nothing bad was happening to him. This wasn't his problem, and that's the problem today. If it's not happening to you, you don't care and might not really even know. And that's why people don't care or know today.
Nothing these self-righteous Democrat hypocrites on ESPN said (against the Strawman they set up to knock down) has anything to do with Ditka's criticism of the NFL players disrespecting the American flag and the anthem.

I find it strange that as a white male of 49 years of age that I am held responsible for the plight of my minority group members of African heritage, slavery was a rich man's racket in which my family had no part in... I hate the fact that hundreds of thousands men and women were forced to go to war with each other for the envious Northern industrialist who didn't want to see the south succeed, the fact that Lincoln said he wouldn't have freed a single Negro if it were possible to preserve the Union
I doubt that Paul Robeson,King and X  would agree with taking a knee during the pledge...
I do believe Paul Robeson was speaking to a white journalist during that quote. Possible, the conversation took place during WW1. I think!
Here is a suggestion that has passed the test of most people I know.......Keep the teams in the locker room. Then bring them out after the National Anthem. That way we clearly honor our flag and our country. Then all the idiots in the locker room can come and play the game.
This is a f - ing joke someone tell me what this has to do with sports? If I want to hear about politics I'll turn on a major news network...
Keep Politics out of Sports please! People claiming oppression were broke or living paycheck to paycheck when Bill Clinton was in office...People are Lazy selfish and have a sense of entitlement and think it's all about them...So can you'll please stop comparing this to the civil rights days PLEASE!
Well like Jake the snake Roberts use to say NEVER TRUST A SNAKE!
Racist are really coming out the closet!
I'm from the ghettos of Savannah and I can honestly say all the white people I've met did nothing but try to help me,I got a raise and an opportunity to move up to management, not cause I'm black cause my hard work is being recognize. But when I walk home from the bus stop, I got to watch out for these dopeboys,these God damn J's, stick up kids,I got robbed 3 times and shot in the stomach and left for dead. This redneck from a near bye road construction ran to me held my head up,put pressure on my wound and talk to me to keep me from passing out till the ambulance came, so not all white redneck are bad.
Look at that face for crissakes.....nothing intelligent will  come out of that face
Spoken like a true racist dam mike really go to another country and play football I bet u wasn't talking like that when them niggaz was helping u win that ring back in 85 just like a punk ass white boy fake as fuck blacks are only cool when we helping u accomplish a dream but once that's done we ain't no good no more get the fuck out of here fuck ditka & any other racist muthafucka out there this country don't belong to no one technically u whites always trying to act like yall were the only ones here and blacks just popped up out of nowhere no muthafucka we were brought here so since u hate blacks so much u really should be mad at your grandfather's and their father's it's their fault u gotta see us everyday and no matter how much u try to act like it doesn't exist racism is real and always has been so stop lying to yourselves white people and I always thought we were the dumb ones smh
White people are so paranoid and nervous. What a shitty life to always live. In reality they have nothing!!! I feel so sorry for them. They put so much effort and money to constantly try and shame us at every stop. These times remind me of Ali vs Frazier. The chosen blackman playing rope a dope until there punched out!!!
What do you expect from a Neanderthal? Ditka is a racist piece of trash
Check this mf for CTE- but let’s not wait for him to die...
I bet Mike Ditka want lose any sponsors. But Cam lose money for laughing. That's the equality that runs America.
I think he meant the last 10 years instead of a hundred. Somebody added an extra zero in there.
If that's what Ditka believes it really says a lot about his true character. If he didn't view lynching, Jim Crow, and other types of discrimination as oppressive though out his life then and now he can just get fucked. OVERRATED AND AWFUL COACH, Buddy Ryan was the true coach for the '85 Bears rip
As a lifelong Bears fan, Ditka was my all-time favorite coach. I have looked past the Trump support but no longer. Congratulations, Lovie Smith, you just moved up my list to number one. Still miss you, Lovie!
lol black people were still getting lynched in the south until the  late 1960s
Ditka's statement is embarrasingly stupid. And whites are really claiming to have an high iQ ?  LoL.
what a shock...a coach from the modern day slave trade doesn't think there was any oppression against black people, 100 years or not. These type of people get TV time now a days...sad.
Mike Ditka is an over rated clown, coach Ryan is the reason the 85 Bears were so dominant. Fuck him and fuck the NFL, i'm enjoying my NFL Boycott & saving money at the same time.
mike ditka speaks the truth steven smith is a racist he loves talking crap about white people and max, slavery ended well over the 100yrs ago which mike is talking about .today its the white man who constantly is under attack
All I have to say is thank you Mr.Kaepernick. Things are coming to light
The same Ditka  who loved his running back so much he wanted him in a wedding dress, Ricky Williams, Ditka is a nut case.
It just shows there is something wrong with the wiring in a lot of white folks .
Steven A Smith.... nigga shut your dam mouth you racist POS
The NFL players are playing the race card and the victim card.  However, President Trump and the majority of Americans, aren't falling for it and see how hypocritical it is.  First of all the players are on the job, a job where, outrageously, we Americans subsidize their millions of dollars a year salaries.  We don't go to work and bend the knee to show our support for anything.  But those players are SPESHUL.  They are, some think, HEROES.  Why?  Because they can do certain things in a game with a little ball?  Some of the police they are protesting are the real heroes, as seen in Las Vegas and during the hurricanes, white or black.\n..\nThose players can protest elsewhere, not on our dollars and on our time.  And really if they want to help America - which they will not change a bit with their lazy knee bending - they should start at home  So many bending the knee are known for destroying hotel rooms and are on drugs, are spouse abusers, and not uncommonly are found in court or in jail.  Let's see.  Those kinds of things could get you  on the wrong side with the police.  Hmmm...  Could that be one reason they hate the police so much?   And they want to act like they have some kind of moral high ground with their bowed heads and fake piety and court records?  What a joke.  NFL too often means National Felon League.\n.\nIf they really want to help Blacks, why don't they go to the U.N. and protest Black on Black slavery in Africa?  Notice that none of them are moving back to Africa.  Funny about that.  Why don't they go out into the communities of those who are being oppressed and give their money and their time, face to face, the way Trump and Melania have done for hurricane victims of all colors?\n.\n  Oh wait!  Most of the NFL players are Black.  That means we have to wallow in a guilt trip and assume they can do no wrong.  Sorry, that doesn't work for me.  My ancestors never owned slaves and I am thankful to the WHITE Christian abolitionists who were the first people in the WORLD to fight against, and end, slavery - in this country and in England. When I worked in the school system I loved my little Black students as much as my little White students, in some cases more. But, if anyone says anything against an ill intentioned Black person, well, that means they are just a racist and a Nazi, right?  B.S.!\n.\nI smell  Islam in the background.  And don't you just know that Islamists are loving it when  they see those players taking the knee and disrespecting this country.
Yea the civil Rights were terrible but fuck that let's go back 100 years like said, it's 2017 so back in 1917 you telling me there was no oppression, you telling me they weren't out there lynching niggas? And Max's comment about the civil Rights was only partially right, the main reason the civil Rights started was because of Emitt Till, that shit shoke the world and opened everybody's eyes... But of course just like when a sad movie is over, white people listen to the story but get up and leave as if it's not their fault...not their reality...
Not sure that I care enough about what Mike Ditka thinks. It's those closet Flat-Earthers who really concern me...
Why don't you doosh bags stick to sports.
Fitst Take is the best sports show on television. SAS and MK are great together. The irony though of these gentlemen having the freedom to say how they feel regarding sensitive racial issues facing this country, but Jamele Hill gets suspended. It can be hard being black in this country, but it's even harder for black women.
And he was probably high all the time which is why he hasn't seen or heard of any oppression in the last 100 years. Stupid ass old man
You're a man. Quit scratching your vagina and complaining about insensitivity. Grow a pair you fucking quiff. Slavery was a shitty thing but thats why whites and blacks stood together to end it.
Mike Ditka is who I thought he was , but niggaz let him off the hook . Why do ya'll act so surprise each time the devil comes out the closet , like you couldn't see it in his face before .
Lol he's right, black people need to keep playing the victim though so they have an excuse for their underwhelming performance in society.
Max Kellerman sounds very presidential in the pre-Trump sense of the phrase.
Mike dikta is a idiot his white ignorance and stupidity is a real true assclown he need to be  heavily medicated now lawd have mercy disgrace to the BEARS organization smh he is suffering lack of everything im done with him for good now smh 👀😞😞😒😒😒😒
Ditker....

This will be a great show. Not just good. GREAT!
The shawshank car at the end really did it for me, than one upped it with the you dont know what your dealing with do you? My theory about bill is he serves at shawshank because when he appears he is in one of those straight jackets. Guess i gotta get hulu now for this and runaways.
what a time to be alive - Stephen King's Bank Account (Probably).
Did I just see my boy Cujo? And that Shawshank sticker? Ohhhh I'm ready for this.
I'm a simple man... I see anything Stephen King, I watch.
They float. They aaaaall floooat. And when your car goes into the water, it'll float too.
Sounds like a DEAD MAU5 score
I want the music more than anything, somebody please make music like this for the sake of humanity
This looks freaking amazing... I need to get Hulu
So ready to see what this is all about...Especially because I'm in it well hopefully if they had all of the footage anyways
What’s Castle Rock about?
I want a Friday the 13th movie to watch tomorrow
The music is cool
Sissy motherfucking Spacek
Anybody know if it's possible to get your hands on this edit of Coelacanth I ? I am obsessed with this version!!
Bill and Stephen better become the next Tim Burton and Johnny Depp
Anyone know who the music is by?\nFreaking love it.
Can't wait to see this show.  And really can't wait for them to be done shooting it causing all these traffic delays in my town
Wow Hulu with show is awesome \nbut  I would like someone or some channel to bring it back to The Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt that would be great
a trailer with Deadmau5 soundtrack...you have my attention Hulu
IS THAT DEADMAU5?!? I THINK SO. IS HE COMPOSING THIS?!?!!
Nice ! But only need access to Hulu from Canada you know, it can help.
Look out Stranger Things...Hulu has got you in their sights.
Is this related to Shawshank redemption?
Is this series lik free hulu or do we hav to pay?
♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n*This Is True Love!!!  (Just ask Him)*
Holy shit, the kid who plays it is in this. It really IS gonna tie everything together.
Andre Holland = Bae, he's a talented actor too, ever since moonlight i had my eye on him.
Let me guess, this takes place in Maine?
An Emmy for Sissy Spacek?  She deserves one for this!
I couldn't have been the only one surprised to hear a Deadmau5 track on this trailer
What's the track playing in the background?
Soo happy its getting filmed in my town
Isn't Castle Rock the name of that place in Lord of the Flies? lmao
Castle Rock is a town in Colorado. One of many places King is fond of using for inspiration in his stories.
I just want The Knick to return.
It's kinda weird bill skarsgard is in this lol
Let me guess, it is set in creepy town in Maine where everything isn't what it seems...gee, how original Mr. King.
When anyone writes something It's from their mind. From Stephen King's mind?
They're filming this in my town
I could watch Andre Holland cook beans and rice in a 3x5 kitchen for HOURSSSSS, I can't wait!
Based on the trailer, this movie gonna have some sick drops m8 and cubes
Newsflash: THIS IS HOW YOU PRODUCE A DAMN GOOD TRAILER!!!
Goddamn it. Make a fucking true Dark Tower show.\n*HOLLYWOOD, IT'S MAJOR MONEY IN YOUR POCKET A FAITHFUL ADAPTATION!!!!*
0:41  41 years ago Sissy Spacek performed Carrie in the adaptation of brilliant  Stephen King, this year surely will make a cameo in this series.
I used to live in castle rock, co
can we expect to see Johnny Smith in it?
Hulu is like what LoveFilm was to Netflix
Well it has my attention. Hate when trailers spoil whole movies or shows.
Does this link in with 11.22.63 that was a pretty dope show no one ever talks about
Really looking forward to this. I'm loving this Stephen King revival, hes such a great storyteller and his books deserve great adaptions (we can just forget The Mist tv show happened tho).
even cooler when you lived in the town they filmed it in. walked over that bridge everyday for over a year
i used to live in Castle Rock.
This show is flimed in my home town I have watched it being filmed it's so cool!!!!
deadmau5 on that score, definitely feeling it.
Marc Bernardian wrote some of this he’s perf
Ah man I wanted a Fraggle rock spin off
The viewers really win when Hulu and Netflix have to keep stepping their games up to compete with one another. Can’t wait for everyone to see how good Bill Skarsgard is outside of his Pennywise roll. Such a talent.
They caught me in the background lmao it's amazing the things they've done to my town though. They've fixed up a lot for this movie. Shooting is taking place in orange Massachusetts if you didn't know
You Are Great - Motivation \nhttps://youtu.be/4R90ek4V7d8
Wow. This is going to be great , I can tell.
Who can say no to this?
Hulu and Zikonightcore are my favorite channels , propably you dont know zikonightcore channel but it's  just Fier !!
YES a Deadmau5 song
Bad trailer.
SISSY!!!!!
0:12 Mike Hanlon?
that bladerunner piano shot
FUCK!
Dude they’ve got Pennywise AND Carrie? Stephen King Fest!
DEADMAU5!!!!!!!
Guy from THE KNICK
Giving up on Hulu. New interface SUCKS totally.
Andre Holland & Sissy Spacek... I'm there!!!
anybody catch the shawshank easter egg at 1:05
No captions?
DEADMAU5
Is Bill Skarsgard playing Andy Dufrense?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!! dangit I have Netflix.
deadmau5
Deadmau5 sound mixing!
I really hope Carrie appears
joels coelanth
Its exclusive un hulu?
Everybody came home!
Go Algernon!
This looks amazzzizzzing
Andre Holland !
WANT THIS!
nice nice
*WILL YOU MARRY ME HULU!*
I'm getting Stranger Things vibes.
even at $5.99 a month I don't want Hulu.  it's trash and I refuse to pay any amount of money for a service that forces me to watch commercials
Like Castle Rock, Colorado?
The nig from the Knick, Stick and It.
0:40 That old lady looks exactly like stephen king
Me: *sees ad*\n\nCastle Rock\n\nMe: this is Stephen King. This is totally going to be Stephen King. I know this reference from It.\n\n*bill skarsgard shows up*\n\nMe: yep, it even has bill skarsgard.\n\nfrom the mind of stephen king*\n\nMe: I WAS RIGHT.
Fuck Stephen king, YOU SUCK BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!
Eyeliner pls!!!

Tati you look beautiful
Why grandiose? 😱😭 i've never tried anything better on my lashes 😱
Will you be reviewing the new Charlotte tilbury palette?
It’s amazing that beauty gurus have an almost textbook memory for products they’ve tried. Like Tati just rattled off mini reviews almost for like 100 products! It’s kind of impressive she remembers specific experiences with all of those.
Please do a lipstick purge video

TATI!! I would love to see you test out Ciate London’s new glitter flip lip. It starts out as a matte lipstick but when you rub your lips together it turns into glitter!
Hey Tati, can you do a review on the Luxe Glitz Palette by Jolie Beauty??
I love these videos!!
Tati? You don't have any Toofaced products? You should do a full face of Toofaced. 🙂

Tati, we need a makeup set up tour!!!! I wanna know how your organize your makeup drawers/ how you sort and store them.
You can buy Fiona stiles at their website
I love when you do these and go through everything, I bring a pen & paper to the table and write down things to maybe try. The only thing that kinda stinks is since you put the name of the products before you say whether you like it or not, I end up having to pause and rewind to catch the name again but that's okay <3 Thanks for a great video
I love you so much Tati ❣️❣️
That glittery lower lash eyeshadow...and the red lip we and James love! 😍
I would like to see some recent skin care routine
We can make,

You always have the cutest clothes and accessories!!!!  Can you please put where you got them along with your daily make up 😘😍😘😍
Tati you need to try the dark blue version of the Catrice Glam&Doll, it's mind blowing
When you donate, where do you donate to? I lost all of my makeup collection in a house fire. I’m a MUA and it’s so upsetting. I love you Tati! I learn a lot from you!
Can I have the mini's? :(
Great Video!! Love these makeup graveyard Videos 👍👍👍\n\nHey everyone I would love it if you check out my instagram page my.makeup.goods 😊 I would really appreciate your support😘
Please please please do a tutorial on your eye look!
I hope you saved your throw aways. I can't remember the organization but there's one out there that cleans and uses the brushes to help clean ocean wildlife (like penguins) when there is a spill.
Tati. I do not see “Doll Lashes” by Lancôme. It’s wonderful. I’ve tried many also. It has a tapered brush that’s great.   Xo. 💄👄
Wishing I had seen this years ago before I started using Lancôme ‘s primer. After I use up the two I have, one was a back up before I moved and the other is because I forgot I had a backup, I’m trying the Wet & Wild one. I wish I didn’t need this step, but w/o it my lashes are invisible.
where better than sex at?
I love your lip colour ! Love you 💃🏻
HOW do you even remember how they apply ... GOALS, goals, goals
I like the revlon red lid formula but i didn't like the brush it was so scratchy.
Could you try catching it tho??? thanks \nI died!
I love your videos... Wish i can meet you... Hug n kisses from indonesia 😘😘
I'd love to see this style of video with eyeliner!!
You look stunning!! I love what you did with your eyes, and that red lip is perfect. <3
Yay!!! I requested this video and you did it! Thank you! You are amazing Tati! ❤️❤️💜❤️
you say donate, im curious where do you donate them to?
I use a lot of Mirenesse (I'm from Australia) & their skin care is the BOMB!!! A full face of Mirenesse or just Australian makeup would be great to see
please do a review on a bunch of fiona stiles products
I would love to see a declutter of lipsticks. Great job!
You’ve inspired me to get rid of things. Thank you
Ooo can you do one with lip liners 💋
I would LOVE if you did this 'spring cleaning' with eyeliners! I'm Asian, so I monolid horribly, and really really need a budgeproof smudge free eyeliner for my oily lids. It always comes down and makes raccoon eyes, and I've tried at least 6 different drugstore liners and none of them have done it for me yet.
When you do these videos could you compile a pdf of all the products that you liked that worked for you, and ones that didn’t work for you, since In your description box you can’t list all of them. I would love to know all the ones you like, especially the affordable ones! Thanks love💕 keep slaying 💁🏻🔥
Tati you should do this with eyeliners. Need a good drugstore one that doesn't run.
Love to see more videos like this❤
We are so proud of you too, I need to do that with my makeup collection
Love that your just as equally excited about essence as you were about Marc jacobs
where does all your makeup get donated too??
im trying to be patient, but please give us a pr unboxing
what are your opinions on merle norman?
Tati:  Where do you donate your items to?
I only have one muscara from essence \nYour lucky to own all of that
I thought Rick and Morty fans were supposed to be of higher intelligence? They bee getting scammed
Why are People so stupid these days
THAT FUCKIN NUMALE CUCK TAKING THE MONEY FROM HIS FATHER
If only the guy selling looked more jewish this would be perfect.
Eat from a strangers hands for 10$. Did he wash his hands?
i fucking love how his face shows the worthiness
A sauce that has been nearly forgotten for 19 years, suddenly blows up in popularity because of one show
Dumb kid. \nThey were selling for 800 dollars on eBay. \n\nCongratulations on missing out on a fortune.
0:21 why is that the perfect representation of the rick and morty fanbase
0:05 you can see how the guy asked for his father to borrow the 10 bucks lmao
I had this sauce before. It was good, but not $10 a pop good. Particularly notable for the sesame sauce aftertaste that lasted hours.
I do not understand how can he sell something inside the macdonalds. Isnt it wrong to sell other things inside another shop
It's no scam, they got exactly what they paid for; what an inspirational merchant.
The aspiring entrepreneur seems to touch the money and hold the nugget using the same hand. Not only the idiot will get the chance to taste the sauce for $10, he will also get E coli for free. Great deal!
And people thought MLP & Steven Universe fans were cancer. R&M fans are super AIDs double cancer.
It's fake 4 guys set this up!
The idiots paying 10 bucks are stupid but that’s actually a good idea to get idiots to pay 10 bucks for it
i blame baby boomers for this shit
This shows the elites the true nature of people. They can watch this and justify there own actions since the first chance this dude got he started exploiting people, reassuring the elites that any of us they are causing suffering would have done just the same if we was in the same position the elites currently are. He had a chance to share valuable limited resources the sauce like people preach for the corrupt people to do but then we dont do it ourself at the first chance we get?
Jimmy neutron in ten years
Somebody help me out, is this sauce expensive or rare or what?
This seshuan sauce has been blown way out of proportion
Half expecting Rick to walk in with 100 dollar bills in his hands.
Thank you Rick and Morty you proved our world is fat enough to pay $10 for a bit of sauce and nugget
It's my series arc Morty, 9 seasons morty
This sums up Americans in a chicken nugget.
How is he allowed to do this inside the place where it was sold
Capitalism has gotten out of hand
THE LOOK ON THE NERDS FACE JESUS MAKES ME LAUGH
Rick and Morty fans: we're smart cos we watch Rick and Morty, the rest of you guys are fucking retards cos you don't understand the show\n\nAlso Rick and Morty fans:
The most American thing ive ever watched
-pays 10 usd for a nugget\n-eats it in one go
Please help me I am in great pain.
It wasn’t worth it👎
That guy doesn’t seem impressed
That man is a genius.
What a fucking fool. The look on his face when he's asked if its worth it. Of course  its not fucking  worth it
Don't these guys know anything about hygiene?!
Its a scam a few people In on it and they buy and say its nice so other normal people buy like sheep
Is this in Canada
These rick and morty fans are so fucking cringe smh
you paid a man 10 dollars to dip a nugget in some shite sauce, if i was your dad ill slap the shit out of you and disown you for life.
Why did i watch this 😒
Is this a live action Ed, Edd and Eddy?
Capitalist at its best! 😂😂😂
you can buy szechuan sauce from the chinese down the road from me. they do it with seafood or meat
People in the comments will gladly hand over money for overpriced iPhones, celebrity endorsed makeup, cars, and sneakers etc but think it's dumb to buy a nugget dipped in sauce for ten bucks ......
The world is fucked.
Stupid niggers. This is why you are poor.
Rick and Morty fans belong in concentration camps
That’s cheap as fuck!!!
Szechuan sauce? Tf??\nBruh that dude handles money and then your nugget and sauce. Good luck with all that faecal matter on the nugget, you probably got some other sauce too 😷
ARE THEY REALLY THAT GOOD???
Think for yourself, don't be sheep
'Capitalism is the most efficient system at resource distribution'
You should all kill your selves
50% men don't wash their hands after toilet, so there's a 50% chance he touched a penis before taking that nugget.
Sooooo... would any of you recommend I watch Rick and Morty?
people are so fucking stupid oh my days
0:31 the look on that man's face just shows he wasted 10 fucking bucks on not even a 1/4 dipped chicken nugget
I like how everyone is crowding around him likes he’s the fucking messiah or some shit.
I don’t know why people are going mad for this sauce as it’s nothing to do with rick and Morty except rick referenced it in an episode and the promotion for the sauce isn’t even rick and Morty related
Look at all these troglodyte homunculi degenerates that the show itself mocks doing exactly as they mock others for doing.
He then sold them air for $20
Fair play to the guy hustling these idiots
All that guy could taste was regret...
Good for him. Just like people that pay $1,000 for a phone.
Well, time to stop watching rick and morty and associating myself with the horde of asshats that claim to be fans......
Lol the guy stuffs it in and crosses his arms like yes I'm a badass
:24 That is the face of defeated, beaten man.
What a stupid fucking video.
Rick and Morty is truly a show for intellectuals a fanboy shouts as he pays 10 dollars for a fucking chicken nugget...
Wow much intelligent\n\n\nSuch intellects
Fucking retards
Fucking 10 bucks apiece for meme sauce
Bet you its soy sauce+ ketchup.
Goddammit Rick...
https://youtu.be/0sNs_w_9Q8k *this*
genius
Watch this\nhttps://youtu.be/inLM7eCRaTA
What a nugget
Capitalism at its finest
Actual Autism
Wtf is this?
Filfiy  capitalist
I need it ffs
Communion
American weirdos
Anybody else like WTF
What a fucking legend
aaahahahha, gogo internet! make the sauce flow!
Worlds gone mad 🙈
Fucking sad fat americunts😂
Mc Jewed
What is szechuan sauce lol
The Chad Enterprise
Bunun trendde ne işi var amk?
Ahh, the human race.
Please meme gods make 0:25 a meme
All these comments hating on Rick and Morty fans saying they can't be as clever as they think they are for spending $10 a nugget.....I argue the dude selling the nuggets is the biggest fan in the room and he's a fucking genius
Written by Kate McKinnon
LMFAO conservatives rubbing their man junk all over the place 24/7 and their porn and sexual desires and preach not being offended but this is gross LOLOLLLLLLLLLLLLL
this was hot garbage. i clicked on this because of the number of views thinking i was finally going to see a good SNL skit and didn't laugh once, didn't get excited about the kiss, nothing. this shit is hot garbage. one of the best I've seen is this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG0wQRsXLi4
If Diana ain't a bit gay, how does she kiss so well? 🤔🤔
This is funny? How exactly?
Why is a kiss always their punchline lately?
gal gadot really is beautiful id kiss her!!
So sick of homosexuality having to be in everything on TV nowadays.
I'd rather have Chris Pine #Hello
LMAO THIS IS EVERYTHING IVE EVER WANTED FROM SNL\nseriously, i love kate and she was so hilarious in this, i was dying when she kept saying alright. god, seeing kate and gal kiss was an experience :) to snl, all of us wlw thank you lol
You know that Kate was so fucking turned on
ok but why does gal seem to be looking offstage the entire time
Gal gadot is the only person ive EVER seen in snl just blatantly stare at the teleprompter....i mean shit atleast TRY to make it subtle
... I felt something watching... Just saying.
that was hot
SNL sucks now
I just ... ... ... anyone who has seen me watch WW or the mew GB knows the inhuman noises I made ... which were really loud.
Notice this act did not come before her Wonder Woman movie. This is because they needed to have her idolized by young girls. Then they make their move with their agenda. Mothers and Fathers protect your sons and daughters. Do not support Gal Gadot or this flagrant propaganda against your children.
That kiss was hot 🔥🔥🔥
hey.. its fun to do this
As a male this did not give me a boner but My room did get hot. Perfectly normal
Best day of Kate's life, no doubt.
they aired THIS and cut the last fry song? are you kidding me?
Did you guys find that they said their name wrong?  They all claim herself Megan, the other is Dre.
This isn’t crazy....THIS IS LESBOS!- Mr’s garrison.
YES!!!!!! I CAN NOW REST IN PEACE.
For the first time in my life I feel envy.
lol at the Oooo okay, that burns. I-w-what is that? xD
WONDER WOMAN IS BISEXUAL THOUGH
Please help me what was that I found in my last video I'm
Everyone saying Kate's so lucky! No (I mean yes) but Gal is so lucky! I mean it's Kate Freaking McKinnon
I relate to Kate on a spiritual level here..
People find this funny?  What part of any of that was funny?
I hope to find a male version of Themyscira .^_^.
This shit became more feminist by the day..fuck you.
Pure bliss and I'm not even Gay 😍
SNL is disgusting. So now all female superheroes must be lesbians? Great job perpetuating the stereotypes.
4:12 Kate got her motor running by Gal
In every sketch, Gal is obviously looking at cue cards.
I thought the make out session with Vanessa Bayer, and Kristen  Stewart  was hot, but this tops that for sure.. ☺
If she wasn't a lesbian before, she is now.
How in the hell did that kiss not make news?! I just stumbled onto this vid... I need another pair of pants...
What is that black girl lose her themyscira accent halfway through the skit?😅
Did anyone else make the connection to the name of the island and the fact that the amazonians are all women?... Themyscira.....the mascara....mascara... Makeup?
Gadot should have went for  hair massage during the kiss.
So many people in this comment section are trying to criticize SNL for promoting LGBTQ propaganda, but if you were to look at the history of Wonder Woman you would realize that she was written as a bisexual Superhero and the skit was playing off of that. Also, can't a skit just have an LGBTQ character in it and not be seen as propaganda? They are just people, nothing to politicize so can we all just stop being so offended.
Kate got a HUuuuuGe lady boner at it!!!
Fuck when she said ‘I felt nothing’ I would have crawled in a hole and died
what's with the dislikes?
I’m 2minutes in and still waiting to laugh...😐
I would love to get kissed by gal
Double thumbs down and goodbye me watching Wonder Woman or Justice League.
Is Gal really that tall?  Or is Kate really, really short?
Exactly, normal people don’t want any mentally ill faggots looking at the knowing the sick bastards would fuck you if they had the chance 🖕🏻🖕🏻
Women trying to be funny is not funny
How I'd wish to get a kiss from Kate...
Yep. This is what it's like. Every lesbian on the planet was watching sympathizing so hard it altered the rotation of the earth.
MADtv
I'll be in my bunk.
This video was stupid and disgusting.
I just came to laugh at the comments of triggered snowflakes.
damn im so jealous of Gal, she got to kiss Kate!!!
This shit was as funny as Saving Private Ryan...\n\nSorry, Saving Private Ryan was funnier.
This is such a realistic sketch its funny as hell
Dikes and Jew whores kissing!? SNL is going down hill
It would be funnier if the first guys to arrive were your typical 30 year old gamers who sit in their basement all day and play wow or dnd.
God I wish that were me.
Man, I was grossed out through the whole thing. I guess this means I'm not gay!
I don't like lesbian stuffs (except selected porn) but this was awesome
First face in Ryan Gosling's ass and now being kissed by Gal Gadot - she is lucky!!! 😄
Wow, they sure are lesbians alright... but aren't they also supposed to be funny?\n\nSexy, yes, but wow this skit was LAZY
I could think of a great Wonder Woman re-make, hell even the sequel
I, however, did feel something
promise industrial similarly me frozen necessary abandon.
holy shit gal gadot looks like a phenominal kisser omfg
wooooooooooooooooooooooooow
showing how dikes sexualized everything ...finally snl you got something right....bravo bravo
Really? Ridiculous
Relateable.
Rhetoric sink proud front race perfect running accept.
Kate you lucky bastard
dykes...
100% Certified TRASH...
Gal is so rediciously attractive
creepy
Sexism at its best, you couldnt do this with 2 cis males hitting on the Amazonians.
I honestly couldnt decide wich woman I was more jealous of, Kate or Gal.
Man, Gal Gadot just tasted fish.
thisis my proudest fap
Damn I wish I were Kate McKinnon.
DAMN GAL!
Oh, Kate..You lucky, lucky gal.
Water water everywhere 😂
TRUMP 2020✌🏻SNL SUCKS 💩
*WE NEED ANOTHER DYKE AND FATS SKETCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
disgusting
I've had bare wanks over this
Here’s to hoping they make a male version of this skit with Thor 🙏
Gal gadot is not hot at all
I'm old enough to remember when SNL was funny.
Good game lads...Robbie savage is sooo entertaining to watch, gotta love him. Best quote of the day regarding one of the keepers, he should be playing for Donald Trump coz he's a wall.   LOL
Who else remember the first ever Wembley cup😂😂😂😂
It is boring when spencer fc/hashtag united always win like if you agree😊😊😊
kieran brown really bad on the pitch should stay with his tricks and freestyle
I mean gerrard
Crawford sucks
Stuart Pearce losing a game as a manager? Where have we seen this before...
What's the song called  when the commentary said that ksi intressed
Tekkers was so op but still got destroyed
If billy was on for Cutting, Tekkers prolly could have won or tied
Hope ksi don't make a disstrac about tekkers city
This is unfair: you take a team that has already play a lot of games togheter and that is really fit and then a team that has never played togheter and are really unfit and then play against each other. of course the fit team is going to win and if you think that legends will help then no ok some of them were fit still but many of them were not so the legends will also not really help. Plus you obviously need a professional coach and do some training because everyone got tackled who ever got the ball and when some one was open no one else opened up so it was very hard to pass it is just un fair it is the same as real madrid and tekkers town played togheter un fair also the others from hashtag who were off camera during the challenges were obviously training togheter
Why does lynch never use his skill
Hashtag only won because billy was injured
commentary was on another level! hope you guys do it also next year! thanks for the laughs! oh, and the game was ok too
Anyone can tell me the score so I don’t have to watch the whole thing
Hi everyone can you check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
If billy wingrove played earlier he would have knocked in at least 4
The commentators just hate each other don’t they 😂😂😂
How much did Spencer pay the F2???
My Bad 14.34
Yes hashtag
There both Sunday leeeeagueee
Did joe Weller come on?
Gerrard never nasty...just stamped on Herrera that one time after being on the pitch for 1 min ;)
does anybody else get annoyed by geordie sometimes? something about him idek.
David James just isn't a legend, always been shot and still is now hahaha
Crappy defensive side for tekkers. Absolutely no chemistry and fitness for tekkers. This isn’t right 😡😡😡
why cant the amazing freestylers like daniel cutting and sian garnier and jezza just dribble through the whole team and score like they do in their videos
+F2Freestylers - Ultimate Soccer so funny when there was a pen for jezza and he was so serious when he scored but then he was like, this is just my job
Please do a Highlights video like last year.
david JAMES as they call him in spain lmao lawrence u dumbass lol haha funny mfkrs
Just finished highschool but already makes more money then you
Does anyone know the bouncin tune that was played as the teams came out?
If tekkers town had a single legend in defence this game would've been very different.
Geordie looking smart once a year for the wembley cup. 😊
without a doubt the commentary made this
Came and stayed for the commentary
I think Elliot let Team Tekkers down the whole game.
I think they should host one of the games here in Houston Texas
Houst, Tx
I miss this!!!! Noo
Hashtag should sign jeremy lynch and billy wingrove
Wingrove?
Theo Barker hahehe lol
Hashtag united sucks
Heskey time
I went to the Match
As much as I'd like it to be true, William Gallas never won a World Cup.
country music these days is awful , I enjoy Billy currington  ,but I don't care about the others. our 1990s n 1980s music will not be played again unless there's a station that just plays the older music . it's too bad too, it took away a lot of good music!!!! if we have CDs of our favorites, then we can listen to them . but I think there should be a good amount of the older country played. the 1980s& 1990s really had a lot of good country. music worth listening to.!!.
Did
Yo, I haven't exactly payed the attention i should've. Can anyone tell me why Billy ain't playing?
F**k this game
KSI and Joe Weller on the same team lol.
Don't know who I would prefer as a defence out of Liverpool's defence or tekkerz town's defence
is scott allowed to have that bottle......
They should make a tournament  with teams Facebook youtube twitter and istagarm
Geordie and Laurence's commentary was golden, had me laughing all game.
Seb is such a try hard haha and it doesn’t work.
Brain and Lawrence managed to make this game incredibly entertaining 😂
Well done to billy wingrove for coming on
isnt it funny how every year spencers team has won and when spencer went on sidemen team they won and when spencer went on youtube all stars they won
Why didn’t give JJ a proper pic? His face is photoshopped onto a black body😂
Sub to my channel
Does anyone else hate Laurence? He's so annoying
If Tekkers had both the F2 they would have dominated this game, the extra training time would have been very helpful as well
If Billy played the score would've changed
Man True Geordie and Lawrence are to much!!😂😂😂
Anyone know the song that was played when they scored
What's the goal song called?
Who saw Jimmy Conrad pointing where jeremy was going when he was taking the penalty
I love spencer fc like if you agree
I focking love how k.s.i is in the same team as husky long time fans will get it hilarious.
lajk ako si balkanac
Pollock is quality
Aids :/
slaughter
Theo Barker??
Tekers guru
It’s always hashtag
chrismd :/
Heskey time
Linesman should go in the kitchen and make me a meal
Spencer pin this if you love all your fans
If only at the beginning jezza and Sean just dribbled they're so good but they don't dribble
I last my teams chance to wembley  cup 2017
Wingrove?
Announcers only ##################
*theo barker 😂
Where is Miniminter?
Did Joe Weller even play
Geordie < martin Tyler
wait! Joe Weller dosen't play?
Why didn't Joe Waller play? Is he hurt too?
Weller didn't even play... Why did he take his top off?
steven gerrard says next year??? mate this is not liverpool chasing the premier league lol
Spencer FC
Who won
This series is so pointless to watch we know Spencer’s gonna win at least make the match interesting by going into penalties or something
I wanted Gerard to slip again
Tom we REALLY want a video about Lance explaining what he does to take care of is skin!!!!!!!!!
Bloody Fantastic vid!  So happy to know that Lance's 10 Meter Scream is next!!
I love Lance. I wish he was in every video.
Love it at 16:25 lol :D <3 <3 <3\n\nLance looked like he unintentionally kissed Tom because he couldn't resist Tom's cuteness lol :D\n\np.s: he even covered it up by saying: I just...I-
He deserves more subscribers
Is your best friend Sofe has someone in her life?, coz I am interested
Is Sophie bi? Cause she is cute as hell! ❤️❤️❤️
Probably the most fun video you’ve made :)
Last time I saw 2 twinks and a girl with cream pies to the face was a completely different video. \nJust sayin. 😉😁
Lance is just so funny and smart
Lance is definitely catching that British accent~
lance is so competitive. i fuckin' relate.

his husband is 43...how da fuk does he look so young at 43
Glad to see Tom had got Lance to loosen up a bit, more relaxed and enjoying himself. The combo works well together.
Your best freind is apparently not watching all your collab vids 😂 You had a discussion with Nile about the famous person thingy in his vid
Hi Tom,\nI Love you so much especially for the work out exercises. (Little less than Lance do). I know for a fact that you are not political person. But would you be able to do a video about the people  who are very unfortunate that they are born in countries like MIDDLE EAST, INDIA, RUSSIA. I would start loving you more than Lance. \nI swear.\nStill Love You even if you don’t. \nThanks Heaps.\nFrom\nWell let’s say Unfortunate Tom Daley
My daily dose of cute, sexy fun!
He’s like a British version of Connor Franta😂
This was so good.  You made my day. Love you guys.
I said 165 for the medals wtf...

Your cuteness is starting to grow on me.  I own you. - lol
Forget husband, I wish I had a BF Q_Q....\n\nBut at least I can watch these....
T. Daley is so funny looking, but he seems to have a nice personality.  He lucked out with the American guy.
i think this video is most sweetest video that i liked so much..💞💞💞
Lance enjoyed this WAY too much!  LOL.......thanks you guys...........Ray

Ugh! Lance. Such a douche!
How does someone look that young at 43.. I guess getting creamed regularly is the secret?
Tom, you`ve become a little bit feminine.
Did anyone else notice that ‘husband’ kissed ‘best friend’ at 17:35
I used to fancy Tom but he's too camp now...
we know who's the bottom now
i didn't know that tom daley is gay
i love him and i know hes wearing nice clothes and all but tom was a little whinny  you knew you where going to get creamed
Lance and Sophie i rekon both need another pie for the question they both got wrong! For the chicken strips one. 513,137 now, in 2days

I love seeing Carrie happy something about it just brings me joy on an otherwise bad day. My honorary big sister is killing it career wise taking on the book and theater industry it’s beautiful to see.
Will you guys be doing a cast recording of the show? I just saw a play of it at my college and I loved the show! I would LOVE to have the soundtrack with you in it! 💜
I will be there this Saturday at the Kings Theatre Glasgow and taking my older sister, as a treat because she is an amazing sister.  I can not wait.  Been following you on here Carrie and the time has come to see the show.  Hope you enjoy your time in Glasgow x
I get the feeling that u and Oliver are dating
Are Carrie and Oliver together
Saw you in the opening night at the Grand Opera House, you (and everyone else!) were awesome!!! It was my friend's first ever time at the theatre and she really, really enjoyed it :) Had to dash for a train so couldn't wait and stage door to tell you how much I enjoyed it in person, but hopefully I'll see you again in the future and can tell you then!
OMG you and Scott’s rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow is beautiful😄
So weird seeing you in places that are so familiar to me! Loved meeting you Carrie, you were so sweet as always
I saw you perform last night at the Kings theatre it was amazing loved the show , you were all great 💖💖
CAN NOT WAIT!! UR COMING TO ME NEXT WEEK AND IM COMING TO WATCH!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME TO STAGE DOOR!!
Ok. I know I'm probably way behind the times, but why/when did the channel change names? I could have sworn that there was a (relatively) recent video where she talked about how she WOULDN'T change it because of the significance of the phrase It's way past your bedtime to her life. DID I DREAM THAT? AM I CRAZY?
I seriously think Carrie has the perfect voice. That is to say, if I could be Ursula and steal anyone’s voice it would be hers!💜🖤
Oliver's monkey impression looked more like Zoidberg😂
One Normal Night is one of my fav songs from the Musical and you totally sing it the best ! wish could hear recorded version.
I actually went to see that in Belfast because we're doing the addams family in november \nP.s. I'm the granny \nP.s.s. I was the guy with the stupid laugh
Absolutely loved seeing you perform! Kinda raging that I didn't bump into you at all seeing as my work is directly next the Opera house.
EXCUSE ME BUT I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT BUM SQUEEZE
At the end of the tour, we need a full dance cover of crazier than you!! :D
So I watched this with my husband, and when the video ended his response was: Wait we have to wait for the Unicorn!?\nAnd now he is sad that there aren't anymore videos to watch till next week.
Now we all just wanna know what happened to the unicorn
I've just realised that Oliver reminds me of John Barrowman and now I can't unsee it. 😫
Absolutely loved meeting you in Belfast! Hope you liked the summer night fruit tea 💕💕
I need to see the fully grown unicorn. This isn’t fair
Enjoyed this show so so much absolutely incredible!
The real question is, where on earth did that dragonfly necklace come from? it's gorgeous!
But what about the unicorn though? THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!!!
Can anybody find the jumper from Zara she is wearing and link it! Im in love with it! I see you on Friday night and I CANNOT wait!!! xx
why the youtube name change? I loved it :( xx
I saw you LIVE! I was skooked to the core. your voice is seriously amazing. well done!!!
It's the elevation is my new excuse! Hahaha
When she said end of the day ... is it ok if I sang “end of the day another day over” les mis
Hey I was just wondering, how long do these musicals usually run for?
My ticket arrived last week so I’m getting more and more excited now and even have a sticker in my planner for the day 8 come to see the show. Yeah I’m a nerd lol
didn't even think to look for a catan app for my phone! Love the game. might have to go look for it now.
I actually can't cope that you are in Maggie mays like 2 minutes from my flat 🙈 seen you while you were here, me and my best friend had the best night, amazing show
Also your voice is a POWERHOUSE
you were amazing on saturday! love you xo
Ok I've always wanted to know the answer to this: HOW do actors in musicals not CONSTANTLY LOSE THEIR VOICES?!! That's so much constant stress on your voice omg
Anyone else find it hilarious that she was dressed as Wednesday talking about wanting a giant unicorn 😂😂
Scott has me wondering about his range. I had an oh snap moment when he took it up a free octaves.
But what happened with the unicorn??? 🦄🦄🦄
I saw you guys in that theatre Thursday and it was amazing! 10/10
whenever you film onstage and show all the seats it makes me so happy :) you're my inspiration, carrie ♥
I started SNORTING with laughter at 9:16 like OH MY GOD
What is the music for the signing clip?
Are her and Dan still friends??
Are.... are we sure they aren’t dating....?
So nice seeing the inside of my favourite place to work in whilst I'm across the water in Liverpool for Uni.
Although they're in the same family, zebras make different barking sounds than horses do, so it stands to reason that unicorns would make different sounds as well.  Something more lyrical perhaps?
Forget Oliver, I want to see more of the woman with the purple headband @6:40  :D
Maybe it's just me but you seem a bit wicked dressed as Wednesday, the character takes over and nice Carrie is no more.
You where wearing that necklace today as well, very cool!! Where did you get it? And whoop for the Stitch pj!!
Love “watch me, Wednesday” xx😀 now which shop did you get that beautiful green scarf from??
I must admit, after being introduced to the new cast on Sunday night at the London Poladium, I wasn't sure what to think, since watching these vlogs I've found it quite reassuring that you guys are doing a great job at taking the show on!
It's like we're inside a jewelry box! 😍 That is what it looks like!! I've always dreamed of being that little ballerina inside a music box... Carrie, you really were! 💕
so so excited for the addam's family in singapore!!!!
Oh carrie please do a full cover of somewhere over the rainbow that would be lovely
I'm loving the backstage dancing haha! So excited to see the show in Glasgow :D
I'm so upset I don't have the money to go to see The Adams Family \nI hope you have a really amazing and special time in Belfast! <3
Where is your long striped dress from please?? Xx
Can we have a full cover of one normal night pleaseeeee
I was at your last performance in Belfast on Saturday night! It was flipping amazing! \nI've never appreciated how pretty the Grand Opera House is until you pointed it out!
I was in the front row at the Thursday matinee in GOH and it was amazing. Thanks for a class show even if some of the guys in the orchestra pit got a bit singed by the rogue fuse from Festers rocket! Haha
I just booked tickets to see The Addams family in Glasgow after seeing it in Edinburgh I couldn't not see it in Glasgow!! I'm so excited
Was at the half 2 show on Saturday and loved it so so so much. Hearing crazier than you again makes me so happy!
I love you Carrie above and beyond
Carrie was 10 minutes away and I couldn't meet her😭😭😭
I was there on Saturday night... what a performance, it was amazing! X
The chemistry between you and Oliver is insane. Whether you may be together or not, you're definitely friendship goals and I envy it so much
Is the dear Evan Hansen cover (with you and Oliver) ever going to be uploaded? I NEED a full version in my life! 💕
I could watch HOURS of Carrie, Ollie, Scott, and the rest of the cast just having fun and singing their hearts out. I'm always so sad to see the vlogs end. I look forward to them every week and they always make me smile so much. Keep up the great work, Carrie! <3
That unicorn is the biggest cliffhanger...
what's the deal with the unicorn, fletcher??? the people want to know
ok but did the unicorn ever get bigger??? asking for a friend...
Wait I'm in such suspense how big did the unicorn get??
I REALLY WANNA KNOW WHAT THE UNICORN LOOKS LIKE NOW!!
Omgg why I am being so awkward at that signing, I completely blanked and forgot to say I was coming to the Addams Family on the Saturday and that I work at lush, literally I'm such a freak at 2:55
Love the scarves! :) <3
oliver ormson doing the most casual pirouette ever is the reason I'm an emotional mess
TRENDINGGG
YOUARESOPRETTYBEAUTIFULFUNNTANDTALENTED AAAAAA
That riff at 5:56 ❤️❤️❤️❤️
So cute
Wonderful 😍
Your voice 😍😍😍
Carrie has really nice eyebrows
And the Unicorn????
Oli’s double jazz pirouettes 👌🏻👌🏻
It’s so funny how much different English (British) language is from American language if that makes sense😂 like Carrie says Beer Mats and in America we call them Coasters 😂😂🤔
All these comments are basically the same thing 😂 least Carrie has everyone's approval if she wants it 😂❤️
Can we please have a unicorn update? xx
1:32 IM NOT IMPULSIVE (I'd never ask that of you)
anyone know the song at 0:25
I'm so upset that you were in Belfast just weeks after I moved away for uni! 💔💔
I’ve never met someone else who knew that coaster (or beer mat as you said) flipping trick! So awesome 💕
''its like we're inside a jewellery box!'' that was so adorable :3
cant believe I missed the live where carried opened the presents :(
I used to have pretty ridiculous mood swings and low points while menstruating, but since i've start the pill they've kind of evened out. I take Junel Fe and I haven't experienced ANY side effects aside from lighter flow! \nBefore I started the pill, I remember trying to cook an egg on the stove, the yolk proceeded to break while I was cooking it, and i fell to the floor a blubbering mess.
I struggled to take the pill daily so changed to the patch. There was next to no information on it and the doctors were clueless but I have had a good experience on it. My moods are pretty consistent and my PMS is no where near as bad as it was on the pill. Although you can see it in certain places I tend to wear it under my clothes. I would recommend it for someone who struggles to take pills daily as you change it weekly.
Why the fuck are feminists so obsessed with menstruation?
I'm allergic to concentrated yeast! It's a thing. Everything is fine except for marmite because of how concentrated it is. It broke me out in hives when I ate it for the first time.
Loved the video I find you so relaxing! I was hoping you could do a 'how cruel is my makeup bag' as you have a large following you can actually make a small difference even if it's just encouraging one person to stop using products tested on animals xx
I reacted so badly to microgynon , so i asked for yasmine and iv never looked back.  I love it and i feel so much more leveled out. This video was awesome thanks for ur honest pill journey story, i was getting really sick of youtubers banging on about how bad the pill is , theres been a huge amount of biased pill shaming , so this has been a welcomed breath of fresh air xxx
Thanks for talking about this topic. I, too, have had similar difficulties with the pill. I finally found the perfect one for me, but it's expensive, but I did find a coupon from the manufacturer that helps with the cost. I wish finding contraceptive wasn't so difficult.
Thank you for this video! Perfect timing because I have been having serious mood problems and I didn't know why. I did some research and found out it could be my pill... I'm changing brands soon and I really hope my mood will get BETTER! Love you and you look GORGEOUS!
i love this kind of video ! <3
For a while now I'm having a huge problem with PMS. Like  up to a week or so before my period, I start to feel really bad, emotionally. And by really bad, I'm talking suicidal. I do have depression and take anti-depressants for it, but I'm usually fine - unless it's getting close to my period. It's heartbreaking and really, really exhausting. So much so that I actually look forward to my period now because I start to feel better and more stable immediately. I'm not on any birth control, so I don't know if a pill could make this better...
There is quite a controversy growing about the pill in France lately. More and more women stop it because of side effects they don’t want to accept anymore. Consequently there is a controversy about gynecologists because they don’t listen properly to women, etc. I stopped my pill last March, after taking it for 11 years and I feel good. My libido is slowly coming back (which was the main side effect of the pill for me) and I feel less « upset and angry » all the time. I didn’t have any bad side effects. I like the fact that now my mood is way more fluctuant. I spent 10 years having a really « flat » and constant mood. Which could seem nice, but now that I actually experience emotions, I think I was like a robot in some way ^^
my contraception journey: at the age of 19 I went on the implant, I spent a year CONSTANTLY bleeding and I couldn't take it anymore. I then went to the doctors and for some reason (God knows why) the doctor decided to put me on the combination pill whilst I was still on the implant to see if it would stop the bleeding.\nAs someone who suffers with Epilepsy I have to be very careful with what medication I take because it can affect my epilepsy medication and my epilepsy in general. I started to suffer from Aura Migranes (basically if I was looking at anything my vision would flash from normal colour to all pink then all green - the only way I can describe it is like you have got pink and green christmas lights in front of your eyes and they are flashing so all you can see is the intensity of that colour). I went to see my epilepsy specialist and he got so angry at how the GP was so reckless with my condition. He told me to get the implant out and swap the combination pill to progesterone only as the progesterone doesn't affect my medication. so I did this then I spent the next year basically feeling numb, I had no feelings, it was completely flat like nothing mattered. I didn't enjoy anything, I didn't get passionate about anything, nothing affected me. Then I started experiencing pain and bleeding when having sex (obviously my immediate thought went to cervical cancer), so I went to see the doctor, had a smear then got sent to the hospital for a colposcopy. My smear came back normal but there was some abnormality but it was normal. I went to see my nurse (Ive had her for 17 years now) and she suggested coming off the pill altogether as my body might be rejecting all contraception as that can sometimes happen. I did that and the pain and bleeding stopped and it's taken a while but all my smears and colposcopys are coming back as normal. I am now 23, and even though Im relying solely on condoms (not the most effective contraception) I couldn't be happier. My advice to anyone having problems is keep going back, you will eventually get it sorted, don't suffer in silence.
I'm on rigevidon and I've have no problems with it at all. I have been on others in the past and have put weight on very quickly and struggled to shift it. But this hasn't happened with rigevidon and I have been on it for a couple of years
okay so i was in my health class and i was really annoyed and i had really bad cramps. So i like corrected my teacher when she said something wrong and she got really annoyed even though there were other people also making the comments. She then after class talks to me like why the 'fuck you actin' like that so then i'm just like i'm on my period. she then goes on about how periods don't change your mood and i almost slapped her or walked out but i just kinda had to sit there waiting to leave. it was actual hell.
I've never been sure if the awful feelings I had when I was 16/17 Was due to bad mental health, being on the pill, or being a relationship that was going down towards the end of it's run, or a mix of all three. What doesn't help is that after I broke up I decide to just give up taking it and started to feel better and was starting to finish exam stress SO WHO KNOWS MAN SO GLAD TO BE AT UNI WITH A COIL AND WITH A NEW PARTNER NOW
PMS is the worst. I'm currently trying to read up more on herbs to help normalize hormones as I've had some successes in the past (Rosemary Gladstar is a good resource for anyone curious).
What's the pill for ?
this video is so important. I went on the pill (sounds like jasmin from your description but I know it as estelle or brenda) and then roaccutane to deal with my cystic acne. once I finished the roaccutane, maybe a year later, mum suggested I go off the pill and doctor said why not so I did. within a few weeks I felt way more low than I normally do, and unfortunately that fed into my grades for the rest of semester (or was at least a factor). end of last year I went back on the same pill and felt more 'myself'. so weird that that's the case when i'm *on* medication though, and I agree with your dislike of having to depend on it.
I was in a similar situation as your friend where I completely lacked motivation. However I had a blood test done and found I was iron and vitamin D deficient so I'm taking supplements now. My mood has greatly improved thanks to it, so it's not necessarily due to the pill
hey thank you for making this video lucy ! it made me realise that i might be in a hormonal depression like you mentioned the pill caused for you, however i've been on depo provera / the injection for about 4 months now and my depression has been absolutely horrible. i got discharged from therapy earlier this year as i was feeling better about my depression but i had to go to back to therapy as i felt depressed again and it was also around the same time i started by birth control !!! so thank u :)
My doctor recommended me the Yasmin pill which I was on for about a year, and I found it cleared up my skin really nicely, however, I felt extremely hormonal and volatile in the off couple of days before my period. Because of this, I decided to go off of it and similarly, my skin became awful. It's taken me almost another year and a lot of skincare medication to get it back to the point of where it used to be, and I really wish someone had warned me about the consequences of going off of Yasmin.
for what it's worth, i know someone who is allergic to yeast! so it could be that haha
I've tried \nCopper iud (rejected)\nEstrogen projesten combo pills (had awful hesr attack like symptoms)\nProjesten only pills two different strengths (gave me same side effects combo pills did) \nNuvaring (again same side effects)\nMy partner and I would prefer not to use condoms so we are looking into surgical options as I am in a hetero relationship and don't want kids
Do you think your feeling of ‘craziness’ was because you had a break up, maybe you were dealing with that too?\nBut I 100% agree with the hormonal depression, I was on a pill once where I felt so low, I changed and it was so much better
I'm not sure if I just don't notice my period symptoms anymore or if they're just very mild. My periods are generally quite uneventful--I may be slightly more irritated a bit before, but nothing ever noteworthy. They typically only last three days and the only symptom I've ever noticed is some heavy cramping my first day.
Before you do 23andMe or anything of the sort I would highly recommend doing some research into the fact that they can sell your genetic data to third party companies etc!
I switched from the pill to the implant then finally to the copper coil/IUD and honestly having something hormone free has changed my life. No side affects at all apart from slightly heavier, more painful periods but generally better skin, mood, regular cycles etc. Copper coil all the way!
I'm on the pill which has helped with me getting depressed a week before the week during and the week after so basically i had one week of feeling like me and that sucked however i still have body dysmorphia and i get very emotional and everything is very sensitive which i hate and this period it was bad i hadn't seen my therapist for a week everything was building up and people were being right dick heads this week and what made things worse is that teachers at my school still don't know or even try to know about mental health issues and how to deal with someone having a panic attack non the less my period can do one :(
I'm also having an unusual series of periods. I still haven't got it, but I'm already bloated, I'm super hungry all the time, and I've been feeling depressed for a few weeks. And that's weird cause I never had mood changes before due to my period. I don't understand why this changed. Can your body just change like that even if you haven't done anything different in your lifestyle? As for the pill, I don't feel comfortable taking it, so I just don't :) To me it feels too artificial and I'm not a big fan of hormonal treatments (anyway, that's just what I do myself, of course, I think everyone should take their own decisions on that and that it's ok other people decide to take them).
I was recommended Yasminiq when I was 16 and still take it to this day. I took a pill break from october-november 2016 to february 2017 and I got the WORST CYSTIC ACNE. It just wouldn’t go away and I didn’t want to leave my house because it looked terrible and my face hurt.\nI know a girl in the UK whose doctor told her she should take breaks every three months? But my doctor said that I could just take my pill forever? I don’t know what to believe.
I've been recommended to double pack my pill by many doctors because of my horrendous period pains (endometrosis) never once been told its unsafe.
You'd be surprised by how many people are actually yeast intolerant instead of gluten. It also might be worth seeing if you're intolerant to Malt - as it's in beer, but only some breads and cereals. You could get an intolerance test done from a nutritionist outside of the NHS and it really helps! Saves time with all the trial and errors of eating certain foods each month! :)
Deep shades of lipstick look so good on you compared to just Dabbing on colour
About the food/diet thing, I'm suffering with IBS, which involves things such as bloating and feeling sick after eating. (Relatable to your symptoms)\nAt the moment I'm doing a diet called the Fodmap diet which is of course meant to help with the symptoms but the main goal is to find out what food triggers you by trying several categories of foods and keeping a diary. I've only started a couple of days ago, so I'm still very new at this but I thought of the diet immediately when you mentioned the foods that might or might not trigger you. It might not be useful for you at all but it is worth to google :)
I used to be on a combined pill that needed a 7 day break and it was horrible. The pain was unbearable (cramps) and I became depressed and also very angry. Kept lashing out at my family and then boyfriend. Changed over to the 30 day pill and I'll never look back. I don't have the same problems anymore, rarely any mood swings (my mood levelled out) and it helped calm me down and rarely any pain \nTrust your instincts on this stuff your body will tell you when it doesn't agree with something
I'm 23 and I've always had a really irregular period ever since I can remember. When it came, it wasn't too painful, it was ordinary length and everything, but there were months when it just didn't come. Once when I was maybe 16 or 17, there was an entire year when my period just disappeared, although I'm pretty sure that was due to the death of my brother which occured around that time. Now I finally did go to the doctor and I got a pill, I just started taking it, so I'm really hopeful that it will help me having regular, on-point periods again. If anything, it's really making me more focused and helps me feel a lot better, I've been down lately, but I've been much more balanced since taking it. Fingers crossed it'll work on the long run! :)
I feel like the pill is messing up my hormones or is it my mental health. I really don't know :/
I take Gedarel, as I was taken off Ridgevidon after my face broke out and I had lots of chest pain. It definitely cured the spots but the chest pain has got slightly better but hasn’t gone entirely. However, I’ve noticed that with this pill my mood is lower generally, and my libido/sex drive is non-existent which is very frustrating for my partner. I think I will be going back to the doctors soon to see what can be done.
I have been on Yasmin for 7 years without a break. I have no bad side effects and everything seems normal and manageable (3 day light periods, no pain, no acne, no bloating and minimal PMS). That said - I'm worried I could be hiding my true self! What if I came off the pill one day and no longer loved my husband?! Wondering if I should TRY another pill just to see... or, should I not kill a good thing?
Period day 3 still living just about
My implant is really messing with me, and I should go to the doctors, but I feel like male doctors don't really understand, which puts me off, annoying because my first implant was great
My brother has a yeast intolerance so it's very possible that you could be allergic to that. He also lives in London where yeast alternatives are a lot more available for things like yeast free soy sauce and suchlike :)
I can relate to so many of these pill problems. Taking the pill was just not the right thing for me. I used to get headaches that were out of this world, and it was every time during my pill break (so essentially my period) without fault. I knew that two days after going on a break I couldn't schedule anything with friends because I would be in bed with all the lights out and no sound whatsoever. Now since I am off the pill and using a non-hormonal way for birth control I am so much happier. I can't recommend it enough to try and go without hormonal birth-control for a while, it's so much better for your body and your mind (I used to be an emotional mess whilst on the pill, now I'm totally fine)!
Love ❤️ your videos!
See im on Microgynon and have been for over a year and it really agrees with me so far compared to the 3 others ive been on. But i really wanna come off and try the contraceptive app, but my partner doesnt like condoms. EH. LIFE OF A WOMAN.
every time i watch her videos i feel so peaceful inside <3
You do make me consider going to the doctors to try another pill... Even if its just to see what it would do to me Hahaha
I mean your aesthetic is just goals
The food thing may also be fermented foods? All GI doctors get you to do the FODMAP diet, I'm sure you've heard of it. Maybe talk to your doctor about giving that a go? Kombucha is also fermented fruits and stuff hence why I suggested the FODMAP diet. It helps narrow down which food group it is x
a book i read about nutrition told me to find out for myself what i'm intolerant to and how differents food affect my body (cutting stuff out, trying new foods, etc) it's a looong road but i'm willing to try it 🙌🏻
Also, I couldn't recommend enough picking up the book A Mind of your Own by Kelly Brogan. At least look her up on facebook or on her website
This video came at the right time! I have really heavy, really painful, super irregular period and I've been trying to research what kind of pill would help me. The thing is, my mom is against it. It's already been more than five years since my first period (it'll be six in April) and they've been getting progressively worse. This last period, I woke up twice at night because of the pain. And I was on a heating pad! I've been having to take two Aleve and an ibuprofen in the morning, then another ibuprofen at lunch or when I get home. I'm just tired of my super heavy periods and want some relief.
I'm having a very similar experience right now! I've been on rigevidon for about 8 months now, but starting in May, I began to have anxiety attacks about once every 2 weeks or so, normally in the evenings. Recently they've been happening way more often, and this period it's happened three days in a row. I know that rigevidon has caused similar anxiety symptoms in a lot of other women so I'm thinking of swapping to a lower oestrogen pill!
This was lovely to watch, especially as I'm on my period too! You're the only person I know of who has tried Cilest, it was the first pill I tried and I was on it for 3 years and the only reason I stopped was because it stopped effecting my periods and I just had irregular periods anytime instead of during my week break. I then went on Cerazette I think (mini pill) and I was on it for 2 weeks and it made me suicidal so I came off it and my GP was horrible about it but this was the same GP who didn't believe me when I came to her for help with anxiety and depression. I went on another combined pill for a while and then ended up back on Cilest and eventually on a cheaper version of it at the moment! I get awful PMS too I hate myself on my period. I get so forgetful, very irritable and impatient but also mega tired and I either want to eat everything or nothing. I can't believe some of the things doctors have said about the pill, taking two pills at once sounds mental! \nI take my pill 2 months at a time and then I have a week break because during the week break I get bad migraines and my mental health gets really bad so I try to avoid having a period every month and doctors have said it's okay to do it the way I'm doing it. I love watching videos about this stuff, I love talking about contraception and sexual health because it's a personal thing that I don't tend to discuss as most of my friends are on the implant and all tell me I should get it but no thank you 😂
I have a hormone imbalance. Probably have pcos due to most of the woman in my mums side having it. I started at 11. It was irregular, fairly light but very bad cramps. I have ibs so that interfered. After a year my period got heavier, began my descent into anxiety and depression, cramps got worse, acne EVERYWHERE other than my face lol. Gained an obscene amount of weight. I left my school and moved to a much better one. Two kinds of pills later I’m on sertraline and an anti acid with no pill. My periods are back and batter ish. I used to have them for 2weeks to 8weeks and now they’re exactly 7 days and only very very heavy for 2days. Zelest was great as it removed my periods completely but due to gaining weight I couldn’t take it. I went on the single hormone which really didn’t work. Bit babbly but you get the picture. Much happier now, still fighting my weight but I’ll get there. Ly girl - starting conversations from day one xxx
i read a historic book and suddenly started to cry...yeah hormons are great
I swear A LOT on my period and I'm so emotional
I love these type of videos.
I don’t understand why you put so much god damn emphasis??? on using cruelty free make up but you still but from shops like H&M? Like??? Why don’t you care about your clothes being cruelty free? I don’t... understand??
I’m on the pill Marvelon to help my skin and my period pain and my skin is incredible, I went from having acne to completely clear skin but my period pain is awful.. I accidentally doubled a pill this month when I was hungover (no idea why) and I’ve started my period early, usually I start on exactly the same day on my break week, but I am in agonyyyy, I need a pill that fixes my skin and my pain🤦🏼‍♀️ loved this video! X
I believe I have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. I also have really heavy, long and painful periods so that I cry from the pain and everything it is not a good time
I have REALLY bad cramps on my period, but I've just gone on the  rigevidon pill. I've just had my first period on the pill and I had NO CRAMPS!!!! I was the happiest person on the planet, so that's my story 😊
i’m on yasmin too!! i’ve been on a few different ones after suffering from intense cystic acne and yasmin with antibiotics has worked a treat but i’m so terrified of when i decide to come off it and get bombarded with it again!!
After 6 years on the pill, most recent being Desogestrel, I decided to come off it altogether. I feel liberated 👍👍 could not deal with the constant flat moods and not really giving a shit about anything - good or bad. Now I watch adverts and cry when i think theyre emotional looool SUCCESS
I've had the ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel pil since I was 14. As far as I know it's been working for the last 5 years.
I don't think the issue is lack of training, but due to lack of research. Obviously research is being done, but how much of it by men? How much of women's health issues have been dictated, researched, etc. by men? And how many medications given to men for certain ailments are also given to women even if no research was done on women? There's a book written on the topic and I have no idea what it's called. \nBut this video is making me want to go back into Biology.
I was on cilest, and it was awful for me! I was so angry and so hormonal and irritated. I changed to rigevidon, which has caused no side effects and I'm thrilled! Just goes to show, it is completely dependent on each and every body. Don't just listen to what has/hasn't worked on your friend. We're all unique!
Here in Norway many doctors give you Yasmin to start off with, so I got that. It made me really down. I am normally a very happy go lucky person but on Yasmin i was almost sad. It took me a while to realize it, but when I did - swithing it made all the difference. Now I'm using Loette and have no side-effects. Well, right now I'm not using any pill, because I'm pregnant :) But I have been really happy and feeling like myself after switching pills!
I used Yasmine for my acne for about 6months and it did clear up my acne but when I got off it...my ance was worse than ever and I felt really bad in my skin. Now I'm off the pill and I'm looking for a non-hormonal way to not get pregnant haha! Hopefully some day the man-pill will come out...
ugh, periods are awful. for the first years of my period i only got like 2 or 3 in a whole year. I tried birth control but I have severe anxiety and depression and it just fucked me up so I gave up on that totally. Then a weird thing happened where i just started CONSTANTLY bleeding. like 4 months on. straight. tried birth control again and again it completely fucked up my anxiety and depression so i decided id rather bleed FOREVER than go completely insane. Then they found a huge cyst on one of my ovaries, the size of a fucking melon. SO had surgery and my periods seemed to get a little better, until i started bleeding forever again. THIS TIME my doctor was like 'listen, let's just give you a birthcontrol bill with no estrogen that we give new mothers who are breast feeding, really low dose of hormones.' I agreed and now I HAVE A MONTHLY PERIOD.\n\nCelebratioooooon.\n\nOf course the down side is that now I have 'typical' period things. I get really really emotional and cry a lot, I want all the sweets, I get terrible cramps and just lay in bed moaning and ranting about how unjust life is. Who cares. It is magic. MAGIC I TELL YOU.\n\nNow I just need to make up all the iron I lost when I was bleeding CONSTANTLY. Apparently blood loss really fucks with a person.
I have never used a hormonal pill however I do take a herbal supplement which has been LIFE CHANGING! I used to get the most intense cramps, back and leg pain as well as severe nausea and fainting episodes, every month! I had tried anti nausea pills from the doctor but they weren't always effective and did nothing for my mood swings and menstrual cramps. I visited a homeopathic clinic and ended up starting on 'agnus castus', a herbal supplement which balances my hormones throughout the month. It basically stops the huge build up of hormones on the first day of my period which was causing my body to go a bit mental! This literally cured me and if I remember to take my supplements everyday I can have almost no symptoms whatsoever - even less painful symptoms like breast tenderness has almost diminished! I know it sounds hippie and alternative and unlikely to work, but I have found the natural way far more effective than anything I have ever been prescribed. Homeopathy treats the underlying condition whereas, in this case with my periods, conventional medicine was just trying to treat the symptoms. I am now in the position where the symptoms do not occur. The only down side is you do have to pay for it however my supplements are about £9 a bottle and I only use up about 3 per year so it's a small cost for the amazing benefits I receive. I really cannot recommend it enough!
I have friends who take low-dose birth control pills for their acne. Not sure what kind, though.
I literally just got on the pill a couple days ago and had questions about people's experiences, so this video was perfect!
I have PCOS, so I got my period for about three months straight and then not again for another year at a time (which had the side effects for bleeding so much), and then for two months and then not again for six months. the flow was extremely heavy all of the time. the pills would give me horrible rashes on my body and do nothing with my actual cycle. I tried about three different ones and then began the depo shot. i haven't had my cycle since 2014 but every three months around the time my shot is due, I do have serious mood swings, cravings, cystic acne and cramping. it's nothing compared to when I actually had my period, though. I have abnormal lower abdomen swelling from time to time and strong pain, but unfortunately I have not found a doctor that thinks that it's nothing more than yoga or drinking more water can change. I believe more people need to talk about these things because it seems like nobody knows what I'm talking about when I bring it up.
The pill makes me extremely depressed! I've been off it for a year now and my mood is more consistent, but I still get depressed/anxious during the week my period starts. Its really good to talk about this!
It is very possible you may have a yeast intolerance, there are circumstances that lead to an overproduction of yeast in our bodies that can lead to intolerance. Funnily enough oral contraceptives with synthetic progesterone can cause it. I am getting this off of the internet, but seems like enough of a reason to go to your doctor and get tested.
Will you do a video about bullet journaling?
Microgynon isn't often prescribed in Aus but I'm on a double dose of it, because while I don't have huge problems with blood flow, I often got my period two or three times a month for a couple of days (and yes, that included PMS symptoms). I tried many other pills including a lesser does of Microgynon, and my period would still come, just more clumpy and gross. Each to their own with taking pills but I'm so grateful that it got my period back into a normal routine.
Yasmin is the only one I've had problems on, HATED IT!!!!
I can definitely relate to this, especially when it comes to different doctors telling you different things! I was also put on Microgynon, then after about a year on that, the doctor I was seeing recommended I changed to a mini-pill, even though I was happy and healthy with what I was taking. I saw a different doctor for that appointment to actually get a prescription for cerelle, who seemed very confused as to why I was changing if there was no problem. Ugh! Now with Cerelle I don't get periods which freaks me out more than anything, so I want to change back... if I can even get an appointment before my next pack ends. Ahh, to be a person with a uterus :)))))))
I appreciate your candor! I wish more people would be open about periods--it would have made my life as a young teenager much easier! My worst period story is the time that I had cramps so bad that my mom called an ambulance and I had myriads of tests and ultrasounds only to be told that it was gas pain...none of the doctors even suggested that it was period related. Still angry.
I feel bad for all the people out there who have so many problems with the pill and /or their periods, I've been using micronelle for almost two years as contraception and I've been fine, with minimal to no side effects. I do get really painful cramps on the first day of my period and I get emotional and cry as well but other than that it's fine.
My period have started today, my mood is going up and down, i'm angry and in tears about basically anything. I took the pill from 18 till 20 and i have a copper DIU now. The side effect is that acne is there and ruins my confidence sometimes but still, i felt different (better) quitting the pill...
I'm on the pill and during my period I feel similar to how you felt when you were 16, like worthless, ugly, etc, I hate it but I don't blame the pill I'm on to be honest as it works well with me
If any of you ladies, have any advice on the pill, I would love to know, because I’ve been told by friends to give it a try because my period tends to be very painful, and heavy on the flow side of things, but I live in a conservative state so it’s not talked about at all really....so I’m unsure as to giving it a try or not???
Just a guy passing through......
I wish that more people with female reproductive organs talked about how they feel not just on their period, but throughout their ENTIRE cycle, too. I have the most horrific cramps during my period, but when I ovulate, my skin breaks out and I have other physical symptoms, and it took me the longest time to figure out why my body was acting the way it was during a seemingly random time of the month because I had no idea I could be affected by my ovulation. Our bodies are constantly at work on this cycle, with our hormone levels varying depending on what time it is in the cycle, and I hope more conversations about hormones and periods also include discussion about how our bodies operate during other times of the month.
Honestly as a teenager I'm really struggling with my periods, the hormonal side and the pain thankyou for this x
Love the Chatty GRWM videos!\n\nI have endometriosis and adenomyosis which results in super painful periods. I have tried so many different hormonal treatments and it has left my with horrible side effects from bloating and weight gain to hair loss and acne. I now have a horrible relationship with my body because it has changed so often and I don't understand it.  I know that not your experience but it's nice to hear someone talk about things openly.
I‘m on a pill called maxim since i‘m sixteen. It’s sooo good. My skin is great (and has always been), my mood is normal or good. My period lasts 3 to 4 days. Not sure if maxim is available in the uk, I’m from Germany. But maxim is great.
every time i'm on my period, i love making period jokes or puns to lighten the situation. i'm menstruating currently and i can strongly say that i hate this period of time
I really like these videos because it's a topic that isn't talked about on youtube that often. I just got back on the pill after not taking it for over a year, because my skin and period pain got so bad. Originally I didn't want to go back on the pill because I hate the fact that I now take hormones every single day, but to be honest I also didn't find a better form of contraception for me. Regarding my skin I really hope to see an improvement, even though I'm not taking the strongest pill that is used for acne, because I'm too scared of blood clots. But in general, every friend I talk to either has problems with their hormones and skin after coming off the pill or doesn't want to take the pill anymore but can't find a better alternative. The struggle is real 🙄
Youre hair!' 😍
microgynon fked me up
Mmmm another GRWM? Feed me I need more Lucy
shit.
'Best' pill for hormonal acne?
It might be barley
girl theres gluten in beer
I used to get so irritated every time i had my period, this was pre birth control and literally anything done by anyone, especially by brother, would make me so frustrated. but now i'm on the implant and that fucked up my periods so i went on a pill at the same time to try and figure that out but now i'm off the pill and my fucked periods have come back. (fucked being that i would get a really long period every 2 weeks) so i think i'm just going to get the implant out, maybe go hormone free for a while who knows\nbut i am absolutely terrible at taking a pill at the same time every day so i'm going to need something i can't mess up\nAlso i think the implant it messing with my skin as well plus i'm not really have sex so theres sort of no use having it \naghh but idk
Reading the title I thought the family was on foot and the wolf was driving a car
That is hybred not wild !  Click bait !
That was someone's pet. She thought you were going to save her from the wild. 😞
this animal was domestic at one time abandoned, &  wants to get back to the easy life
It's not chasing you,but we should
obviously domesticated animal ,, wild wolf would never do this ,, looks more mixed breed ,, sad should have stopped and investigated more ,, there car must have looked familiar ,
Wolves are very tall they have very long legs JS and the stupid people could of gotten him ran over
Looks more like a husky than a wolf.
that's not a wolf
I would have picked it up....he didn't seem wild at all.
That looks nothing like a wolf.
These people fed the wolf. Then after feeding him they drove very slowly encouraging the wolf to follow thinking it would get more food. Possibly even holding more of whatever they fed it out the window to encourage it. It looks like a heavily wooded area, possibly a tourist destination where animals are fed all the time.
That seems to have been someone' pet at 1 time. because wild animals don't keep on if you leave what they are protecting they stop  chasing you.
looks like they drove out to remote location & put the family dog out. Hes chasing them because he knows hes been abandoned would be my guess.
Say my name, say my name. PERFECT MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.
If I was the people I would jump out swoop him up and keep him as my pet or if he has owners help find them
That's a dog. How can you not see that. Never seen a real wolf before?
dumassess its a husky ive seen wolves up close even pet them these people being stupid
For all of you that are saying this is a wolf it is not it is someone's dog it was posted on missing pets of British columbia
Forgot to add that's a beautiful animal!!!!
Are they strong for not stopping or am i weak cause i would have?
people are stupid. why did this show in my feed? ugh
Regular wolves stay away from humans... It's obvious that the animal was probably a pet at some point and was abandoned or lost... They're so MEAN for taunting the animal like that!!! 👿😡😡 they probably fed it, and that's why it was following them! Also, usually don't wolves come in packs? It's pretty strange to see one going on its own like that...
That is not a wolf!!  That looks like an Alaskan Malamute that appears to have been left and probably was hoping to get in the car!! How sad for this poor dog!!   I have had Malamutes for years and always get people commenting, Is that a wolf?  NO!!!  Not to mention, wolves are incredibly shy and would be highly unlikely to chase a car!!
That’s someone’s pet, it’s a dog. You’d think after all the fires we’ve had this year, instead of tormenting the dog to make a video, you’d stop and help him !!!!!!
i wanna murder the people in the car including the dumb ass baby. Am i psycho for feeling this way?
Maybe the wolf is a spirit or guardian angel... that one of the family members lost someone that they were close to so the wolf is coming to say hi
It is not a wolf, it is a domestic Husky. Hopefully his owners find him...terrible sad.
That's one of the littlest hobo.
WOLVES ARE NOT THE SAME AS DOGS
This is a dog
what you need to do is get out of the car and snuggle it
Not a gray wolf somebody's husky
Listen dum dum. This wolf is chasing you because it's hungry,  unless you plan on feeding it or sacrificing a limb to it then drive away because you're wasting all of its energy making it chase you...  the Ignorance is mind blowing.
maybe he is domesticated already.  maybe someone dropped him on road
EXCUSE ME SIR! SIR! EXCUSE ME SIR! DO YOU HAVE TIME TO HEAR ABOUT OUR LORD AND SAVIOR PUPPER JESUS DOGO!? SIR! HE DIED FOR OUR TREATS SIR! THIS BISCUIT IS THE FLESH OF OUR SAVIOR SIR!
This is a husky not a wolf, someone ditched the poor thing
Wolf is like hey you forgot me
were ever they go hes going to track them haha
This is NOT a wolf it is a tamed dog which yes is like a wolf wolves don’t leave there packs like that to chase people they don’t hunt alone
It's a dog. I can recognize my own species.
He looks like he wants to play
Dude my Uncle has the Exact same Pet.Bro its a husky mix wolf and I feel bad for the poor thing these people are stupid tryna to get attiontion on YouTube this is a crying shame!
Bruh that look like a dog not a wolf,looked like it was lost n tryna hitch a ride
It's a dog.......... And this video has been used by anti-wolf media in France to demonize the wolf and increase the kill quota... So remove it please...
Undrcover cop, they were driving too slow, they got a ticket but the cop couldn't sign it.
Sorry to burst your bubble but the wolf was chasing you.
stupid people should chkd at least if he was alerting u or he was hurt or in danger
Thats a dog. Wagging tail mouth opened playfully\n\nWith the traffic instead of running away definitely domesticated
That’s someone’s dog!! Not a wolf ..
AWWWW\nITS\nSO CUTE. :,) I\nLove herrrr she’s so chunky! <3
I had a dream like this once
Rude! You keep making the poor animal run! And, that's very rare to see a wolf out in the open like that. Believe it or not wolves are more afraid of us, then we are of them! You were feeding him/her weren't you? You're even lucky to see a wolf! They are nearly extinct! Anddd you were leading in in the middle of the road, the poor wolf could've got hit by a car! It was obviously not chasing anything, it was trying to tell you something. They're extremely intelligent! The reason the wolf ran in the woods at the end is because he knew he might of nearly got squished by the beeping truck! And, doesn't it look to small to be a wolf? Well, just cruel... recording an animal nearly getting hit by a car? If you stopped someone would've came flying and hit the wolf... but, after all these facts it looks like a domesticated husky/ wolfdog. A wolf would be to shy to chase after a car like that. I would've stopped to check. Wolves don't attack people so, no worries. It sure looked like a wolf dog. It was probably dumbed, wanted food, water, and a home. Very selfish... poor little doggo/ wolf...
Or u just abandoned ur dog..hes following u
How dare u make that wolf hurt its legs just to make a viral video smh
Abandoned Husky. Too much in the juvenile manner for any wolf hybrid or wolf I've ever observed. Probably wanted food, water, and a home.
Screw you guys for messing with the poor dog you did not help it or anything hope you all crash on the way home
me : im gonna go to sleep early tonight \nme @ 3 am :
Lol it's funny to watch an animal stupid enough to waste it's time chasing a car.
I would have stopped and domesticated it.
0:30 he looks before crossing gosh damn that wolf is smarter then some teens
Looked more like a husky looking for a home.
Crazy.. our DNA is being altered from silicon based to crystalline based and this is effecting the animals first before the human race.  Crystalline is love energies.  I find this amazing no matter what kind of animal it is.
That is not a wolf. It is a husky.
it's like be part of our pack!!!!
Some say he's still giving chase to this day...
Feed wild animals and they'll run into oncoming traffic until they collapse or get run over. Exact same goes for welfare recipients, but progressives want to expand the feeding until everyone is running into oncoming traffic. #SoMuchProgressiveLogic.
Can wolves be as good as dog pets ?
This is a domestic husky not a wolf!
Это волк одиночка,так они передвигаются что бы не нарваться на чужую стаю.

Say my name by Rihanna was playing in the background lol
I would've drove in front of him, slammed on the brakes, gotten out after he's dazed from slamming in to the car, and stomped on its head until it turned to mush.
OMG YESSS! I'm so sick of every youtube channel being targeted to children and everything being censored and bleeped or not spoken about. I'm 20 years old and i struggle so hard to find people I relate to. and often even when I watch youtubers my own age, they still target their videos to children and do 'back to school crap and how to make friends etc. I was overcome with joy when louise did that big video about changing her channel and I think more people need to!!
I am 60 and watch you both
Background music is too loud
Why wasn't Louise invited to the Janya wedding, tho?
The day Louise made the video announcing the change in her channel I hit subscribe so fast! I was so excited! Love when youtubers are genuine!
Louise and Tanya have never made a video together
“Where can you go after someone mentions their dead mum?” that happens to me all the time. Whenever I bring up my dead mum everything is so awkward😂😂
Awe!! You all are so great!! Her hair is so pretty!!
I like to think of myself as a realistic christian Louise I don't think I've related to you more than when you were talking about religion.
it's like two work colleagues forced to work together
I started watching Louise more after the end of an era. I loved her more whilst she was being herself- i could sense she wasn't truly being herself in videos before that. Love you Louise!!!
Jim deserves more views.
I’m 20. Should I ask my mom if I can watch this? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously kidding.
Ahhh I want a friendship like Louise and Jims :)
I am not a Christian, but if you don't take the 6 days of creation literally and assume a 'day' means a different length of time, the story is actually in the same order of creation as evolution.
Love both of your channels, Louise more so since her content changed. I've just turned 27 and always felt too old to watch some but you two have always been my favourites regardless. As you've both grown, I have too. Watching the two of you together is hilarious!
Hi everyone,\nThis you tuber is trying to raise $50,000 for 10 Cancer Patients. Please donate if you can, thanks so much: https://www.gofundme.com/luckielifestyle\nHis Youtube Channel is: Luckie Lifestyle
Three Men and a Little Lady! Fave film 😍
What does 'lowering the tone' mean? I'm in the dark here...
omfg the background music is so distracting, its like fake laughter in tv shows pls stop
i don't think the adam and eve story was meant to be like a direct description haha. most ppl take the view that the seven day creation thing is a v brief description of millions/billions of years of evolution. and the adam and eve story is to serve a purpose of telling the story of original sin and it explains well why the world can be bad. most christians believe that a lot of the bible consists of stories/metaphors that tell us something abt God. my idea of science is that is doesn't contradict religion at all, science is the study of God's creation! ^*^
I love that the content changes because we can grow with you and watch the creator make the cc content they want to create. It feels more natural x
This video looked so awkward. Jim does not seem to be on the same page/feel comfortable throughout this entire video...
Im a Christian and I believe God created the Earth and everything in it, in all its sciency goodness. Im not the only one, theres tons of Christian scientists. Be open minded about it, you will be surprised by your own wrong misconceptions.
Jim, most Christians don't believe evolution and Christianity conflict...
Threw everyone I watch from Zoe all the way to Shane Dawson my mom has watched a least one video of ever YouTuber I watch. She has never complained about what they have been talking about especially how foul of a mouth Shane has. She realizes now they have all made me the person I am , she loves them all as well. She never once made me stop watching someone and it really helped our relationship and made it stronger with how much she trusted me. I just wish some parents would understand that , I'm not one myself...but it really helps the child trust me.
Aww I’ve missed these two together! 😁
Same thoughts re: evolution and Christianity.  Love Louise ❤️❤️
Irrelavant to the video but what lipstick does louise have on?
You look particularly handsome in this video Jim 😁
Was shookt when Louise said that Darcy was 6 years old!!! All I remember is itty bitty toddler Darcy 🙊
I THINK THAT the only reason why Loise wasnt invited to the wedding is bcos of Tanya...
JIM What hairdryer do you use, do you use it everyday, what hair product/s do you use and do you style your hair everyday?
Pretty woman? The film??
my name is Jim too HAHA
Oh😍 Jim you are so handsome!
i love the film louise was talking about Talladega nights : Ballad of Ricky Bobby <3
See, the two of you touching on religion has made me want to see a video purely talking about faith and religion. Especially as you have a degree on the same subject. Xx
I really enjoyed you talking to each other even more than answering the questions - especially the take on being a realistic Christian and mature content. Good stuff.
Dear louise, \n                             I think you are a great role model. You might of made some bad choices but you are still inspirational because you have managed to make a life out of your situations. You now have a beautiful daughter so keep bing louise\nXx
Honestly I cannot focus with the music in the background. Maybe it's just me but it drives me mad
The vast majority of Christians believe in evolution. Religious truth and scientific truth have the same source and therefore cannot contradict each other.
Is the thing Louise said at the start monsters Inc. Xx love you guys
I'm 12 and I watched the lost condom video lol
On the science/Christian thing - my brother is a ‘scientist’ (degree in science and science nerd) and he’s a devout Christian - preaches a lot etc. I think it’s all about being open minded and tolerant of everything. \n\nGreat video guys :-) you’re awesome!
I totally forgot I added a question and just for the fun of it I watched this video, finding out you answered my question! How cool is that! Thank you lots and lots for the answer and for turning it into a conversation about porn, hahaha. Ohh and Jim, you pronounced my name best! It's difficult, I know. Just say it as you read it! Much love again, Sjarlie!
Eminem ripping Trump a new one isn't on the trending list, but this total garbage is......
I'm glad your content has matured. I started watching you when I was 16 and I'm 20 now so I've been able to grow up with your content.
Science was originally designed to prove christianity. Just because it has gone on to prove the theory of evolution it doesn't and shouldn't effect a persons belief in any religion.
Music is too loud and beat-ey
Jim 😂🙈😂 14:33 ahaja poor Louise \nmaybe subscribe. but if you don't want to don't omg
It’s so refreshing to see a Christian believe in something other than Adam and Eve, yet the way you explained it as thinking Adam and Eve is a metaphor is brilliant. It doesn’t belittle  the belief of Adam and Eve, but puts a reasonable sensible thought process to it.
You two are so funny together
Louise, I always thought you were younger than me, but we're the same age.
the movie is Angus thongs and perfect snogging
That end bit about subscribing to Louise made me laugh so hard.
Louise and Jim are the best combination, neither of you beat around the bush with what you're saying and I love it!
Jim, you definitely have the gift of gab (a great asset for you).When are you and Tyler doing another collaboration?
What was the movie was Louise talking about?
the music was fucking annoying - clicked off
I am proud for  my family to watch Jims channel.  He is a sweetheart and  very real, not like the others who put on airs and  fake
When Louise and Jim were trying to call people my phone started ringing 😂
Would watch Jim and Tan in anything xxx such good videos!!!❤
this is the best video
Is it bad , im 14 and i watch louises videos X
I haven't watched Jim in years. I found the desperate to be a children's tv presenter vibe just too much.  Happy Louise has made a  reintroduction happen.
The ad on this video was your book on audible lol xx
I get my book tomorrow!!! So excited!
Louise has lost a good bit of weight go her
Subscribed to Louise after this. :)\nI looked at her channel AGES ago after a collab with Zoe or someone and didn't much like it but I guess that must have been towards the end of the old era. I like her stuff more now. Glad to have had her brought to my awareness again.
Right......... adult Q&A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlet’s watch it anyway
I'm 14 you are both amazing role models! You make me happy! You make me less anxious! Your both great
Hey Jim! Please do more videos like this. I like seeing this side of you!
Barbera Streisand says that, is it funny girl or something?
I did love this video and what you guys were talking about! But the music was a bit annoying, I'm not sure if it was my headphones, but at times it was difficult to hear you guys :(
I thought I was the only one who believes that SOME of Christianity is a metaphor and doesn’t believe in Adam and Eve!
You two should make more videos! Enjoyed it immensely!
Is it talladega nights?? lol, great video :) x
When Harry met sally!!
That Ricky Bobby Talladega Nights reference at the beginning, though. :p\nLouise is so awesome haha.
I am 10 years old and I watch both of them
HAHAH I want to hear Louise's story about losing the condom, anyone know which video that is??
I started my YouTube channel to get comfortable in front of a camera, I went to an acting school for tv and movies, and we were in front of cameras doing audition practice. So it was a way for me to get used to that. Now I love it!
Louise, my dad died when I was young. I think all the time about how in the future my kids will be able to watch my videos because I would have loved to have something like this of my dad. Im sorry about your mom, but I’m glad to know I’m not the only one who thinks about this
Love how real you both were in this, there should definitely not be more videos like this out there. X
Three men and a little lady??? “My hands? I never know what to do with my hands” xx
Love Talladega Nights.
I got divorced, met a man on tinder and got pregnant YES YES YES LOUISE I LOVE YOU
:))) lol
It's Madagascar 3!
PART 2 !!!!!

This video seemed mega awkward to me..

i'm not going to leave one of those mediocre comments saying 'oh i wish that they were all close like they were a few years ago' because the reality is, they've all found their path in life now. some, successful authors and others working in the fashion industry. ultimately, i'm so proud of all of them. they're all doing their thing, and are smashing it. well done 'old crew' of youtube <3

How beautiful to see Sharon and Charles interacting.  Thank you for this intimate glimpse into her world.
Yes! Sharon and Charles together!  Miss them both.
This moved me in so many ways. I'm sad that Sharon and Charles are no longer with us, but their art will outlive us all and for that I am so very grateful.
I'm also writing this message with tears streaming down my face.  Glad to have had the opportunity to see Sharon last September when Miss Sharon Jones was playing in Brooklyn.  I'll always cherish that moment.  So grateful we still have her music and movie!  Great video!
Nothing but Love & Respect for Charles & Sharon R.I.P x
Brought a tear to my eye, seeing Sharon and Charles living it up, having a good time, doing what they did best..... RIP Sharon and Charles.
Bosco and the team- Thanks for making and posting this, it's a beautiful tribute. I still can't re-watch the documentary yet, I just miss this woman and her energy. This made me cry like a baby... She will live forever in the music, thanks again, can't wait to hear her final album.
Rest In Power Sharon!
I miss her so much, everyday. Sharon and Charles have left indelible marks on all of us, and the music world. I know that they are jamming up in Heaven with Prince, Tom Petty, DB and so many other musical heroes we have lost. Thank you, Daptone for this incredible video, and for producing real, powerful soul music!
The Queen is back... Forever!
Man, I miss her and Charles.
The best performer I've ever seen. Still can't believe she's gone. What a beautiful song.
Maravilhosa!❤😘 I love her!
A beautiful tribute!
I'm feelin' this song
What an amazing tribute to Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings. My heart breaks for the entire band-they lost a sister in soul, and quite frankly lost their livelihood. One only has to read about the trials and tribulations the band went through when Sharon fought cancer the first time to realize if they don't tour, they make no money. Thanks to everyone downloading music or using these free services, there is precious little money in recording music and selling it.\nDo the band a favor, do Daptones records a favor, and buy 10 copies of this CD for your friends and family. There will never be a band quite like SJDK again. Bosch/Gabe, thanks for making this all happen.
Beautiful, what an amazing energy!
I'm not scared to grow old now
Sharon forever you'll stay in our hearts !
This is a lovely tribute. Bravo, Daptone.
Only time I got a record signed and a kiss smack on the lips to go with it! Miss you Sharon, rest well.
I loved her and the great band plays with Amy too. This clip it's a dream...
Even in her last days, she still full of energy. Definitely one of the best that the world ever seen
more than music Sharon Jones and Charles Bradley .... Never Forget
Not one dislike. As it should be.
I miss her every day. Thank you Daptone!
Chilling to see both Sharon and Charles together.
Thanks, Daptone!  Love and miss you, Sharon and Charles.
Sounds great!  Can't wait for it to be released!  Wow...in seeing Charles Bradley in this video.  RIP to them both!!
True Gem!
Forever Legends RIP † @2:21
Miss her.
fabulous!!
Beautiful
Loved it!
💙
oh yeah! love and miss Sharon
菅田将暉のような人気俳優とコラボして歌うなんてマトリョシカにはまってたあの頃の自分は一ミリも想像してなかった・・・いや、本当に、一ミリも・・・
米津さんの  むねがぁーいたくて\nの部分素晴らしすぎる
なぜ毎回こんなにいい曲を\n作れるのだろうか...
映画を一本見た後の様な気持ちだわ
脅威的な再生回数やな
Is it me or an pair of glasses are featured in kenshi's song. Shinpachi.
この動画に低評価押してる人の気持ちがわからん
今までは、ボカロP ハチ が好きで、米津さんはそこまで好きじゃ無かった。\nけど、この曲聴いて、米津玄師としても好きになれた。
好きなふたりが同じ画面で一気に見れるこの嬉しさと興奮を誰かに伝えたいこの興奮よ伝われ
後半の 胸が痛くて のとこすごく好き\n掠れた声が心にズシッとくる
どっちも普通に歌上手い。凄い鳥肌たったわ
打ち上げ花火下からみるか横からみるかっぽい
最初の窓に映る米津さんの身体の向きが不自然なのは、深い意味はないのかな…。気になってしまう。 \n\n歌詞はそうでもないのに、映像が意味深。\n\n全体的に言い知れぬ不安感がある。最後誰も乗っていない二つのブランコが揃うときだけ、安心する。
そろそろ米津さん1人のガチ目な新曲聴きたいなーとか期待してたらコラボかー...\nリピートして聴いてみてるけど、、うーーん...米津さん1人で歌ってるとこ好きです！\n米津ワールドじゃないけどこういうのも書くんですね！
この曲で米津玄師さんのこと好きになる人増えたら嬉しいなぁ
菅田将暉！？\n映画かなんかのテーマソングになってるんですか？？
すみません一言いいですか\n5:07\n菅田君白目むいてて、少し笑ってしまったのは私だけでしょうか？\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nそれにしてもこの曲は神
この2人の歌声って\n胸が熱くなってギューッてなる。
どうやったらこんな歌詞思いつくんだろう
合唱版とかでないかなー、\n卒業とかにはもってこいなイメージだけど。。。
another beautiful song!! this was brillant!! *thumb up* greez from germany.
はじめのとこ､えむれなカップルのM君に見えた
米津さん有名になったなぁ。。\nちょっと寂しいけどこれからも応援してます✨
朝学校行くときに聞くと帰りたくてしょうがなくなる
この人は\nほんとに歌が好きなんだなって思う。\n\nやっぱりそういう人が作る曲ってゆうのは自然と人をひきつけるんだなぁ。
昔からずっとずっと大好き\n辛い時も米津さんの曲に背中を押してもらってます\nこれからも応援してます
今回の普通だった、米津さんは耳に残るメロディを作るのが本当に上手いなって思うけど\nなんでこう頭に残りやすいんだろう俺の耳がミーハーなのかな()
米津玄師はハズレないと思う\n今回も神です
めっちゃかっこいいです。\n本当にありがとう。
高評価奇数回連打した。
米津さん脚長すぎない？
菅田の声の方が好きかも
まじ神すぎ！やばい！
なんだこのコンビ\n\n\n\n\n\nえっと神ですか？
イントロでもうやられた\n良すぎる
ブスとイケメン
はぁ...いいわ
米津玄師さんお願いしますテレビ出て下さい
尊敬するわ
どこで撮影してるんかな
とりあえず米津は神
凄い励みになる。
イイネ！
エモすぎ注意だな...
ライブ行きたいな～
Nice voice :)
歌声菅田さんの方が好き

ウィスパー何たらの女よりマシ
菅田将暉って何者やねん…！？なんでも出来すぎ君
途中からタバコの煙多くね？
菅田将暉パイセン歌うますぎ
歌詞、、やっぱり最高だな(´；ω；`)
いやぁー　好きやわ！
米津さんカッコいいです

サムネがもうね、ヤバい(語彙力)
泣けてくる……(；ω；)
かっこよすぎる。
きたーーーー！！
米津さんだけがいい
米津さん痩せた…？
200万！           はやっ！！！！
米津さんやっぱり神。\n大好きです
映画のエンディングみたいな感じが好き
合唱で使われそう
うっはww\n数日でこの再生数w
米津さんの歌で1番好きかも。
やっぱ米津さんの声が一番好き
ブランコ乗ってる米津さん\nかっこいい〜 (>_>)
3:38 ここから好きすぎる
米津さんらしくないってコメントよく見るけど米津さんの曲って誰が作ったか知らなくてもなぜか米津さんが作ったってわかる曲が多い。
もう２人らぶ！！
何もかもかっこいいです😌✨
どんどん米津さんが有名になっていく、、寂しいけど、もう諦めて応援しますね、。w
広告で流れたのにそのまま全部見ちゃったよねーーうっかりリンク飛んじゃったよねーー
菅田将暉すげえなwwwww
As usual, there aren't any English comments..\nBut I'm listening only this song since it released IT'S SO GOOD
批判するワケではないのですが、どうしても米津さんの良さが分からない。。\nちょっとヌメっとした歌い方や声質が苦手なのもあるけど・・・。\nこれだけ評価されている方なので、自分の感性が人とは違うんだなと思うのだけど\nやっぱり良さが分からない(´；ω；`)ｳｩｩ　どんなところが良いのか、具体的に教えて欲しい。
Just an english coment passing by...
What this song name in romaji or english? Please anyone im feel lonelly here ;(
菅田くんの声がたまにamazarashiさんの声に聞こえるのは気のせい？？
菅田将暉なんか...髪似合わない...ただのボサボサなきが...
How about having Eddie Bravo on? He trains some top UFC/mma fighters and can promote EBI which is damn exciting for any bjj/mma fans. C'mon Ariel, show Edgy Brah some love.
Please make the into screen longer next time
Tony just rambles on....lol....love that dude though!👊
Uncle Creepy spiraling...
MMA HOUR get Gegard Mousasi Fighting BELLATOR 185
Tony I went big bear Ferguson..
Can we please not have Ian McCall on the show ever again. Would be great.
Ian mccall wants 100k to fight on the fight pass prelims lol Thats a Lil bit of a reach dawg
Ariel is so cringe. Stop trying to psychoanalyse the fighters, you say the same thing about the fighters you interview being completely different people nearly every single time. You look for depth where it isn't there.
Lol @020:28 StarTrek s***. - Demetrious Johnson. What a great analogy. Haha
It is what it is
Show with sound begins @ 3:58
GooD To SeE HelwanI AnD CucuY BacK TogetheR <3
Ian McCall is such a garbage fighter. He should be happy that UFC let him stay this long.
When you get home from Taco Bell 2:56:54
Ian McCall is transitioning into a woman.
Man Condit is such a good dude very under rated...that Maia fight was a disappointment but I feel Condit still causes problems for anyone would love to see Condit vs Cerrone Condit vs Woodley Condit vs Wonderboy\n\nHope he's well off, dude was doing medical stuff? Sounds like he hated it cant go from fighting in the UFC and being top 5 to work a regular day job. \n\nGet in the gym Carlos everyone knows grappling is your weakness work on it and destroy 170
EL CUCUY!!!
Ian mccall is such a douche im gald he dont fight anymore
Holloway dating a hot model? His ex was just a couple of notches above that
2:56:54 Excuse me!
slow day lets rattle conor fans... lol
too chinny for Conor
Yes Ariel the pro Mcgreggor fans are very annoying. Good to hear I'm not the only one who can't stand them.
Too many politics in this episode. I get it though. But lets not make a habit of it!
Always good to hear from Frankie, also I agree Tony's demeanour seemed much more composed.
does Max have any idea how ridiculous he sounds when he speaks? Saying you know every 4 words makes you sound like a moron. I like Max, he's dope AF, just hard to listen to.
NY Ric better at pronouncing those names than Schaub is.
I thought it was supposed to be RICS PICS not Ariel criticizing every pick from Rick. Rics picks is all I watch cause Ariel is beginning to annoy me.
Sensei Seagull is a fraud! He got choked & pooped himself!
Ian Mccall is ass
no audio for first 4 minutes???
LAS VEGAS WAS A FALSE FLAG
Was that a fart 2:56:54
Tony is gullible if he thinks Dana speaks the truth.
Wtf ian hasnt fought in years nd he wanna get paid more wtf he just need to retire he a nobody lost to dj he doent want it to fight no more he should quit cus he aint top 5 nd he wanna get paid like he a champ no way
Condit is one of my favorite fighters and one of the most entertaining fighters I've ever seen. He's had a rough last few fights (as he said, the Maia loss was so ugly for him, he decided to leave the sport), but I think he's still one of the pound-for-pound best. Over the last half of his career, he's only lost to the best-of-the-best and only by the narrowest of margins. He was injured during the Woodley fight, Lawler was a razor-thin split decision, he avenged his Kampmann loss, and St. Pierre is St. Pierre. One weakness that he has is he doesn't fight takedowns enough. He's so skilled & active off his back, that getting taken down is almost a comfortable position for him. The problem is, even if he's not taking damage on the ground, the judges see it & tend to score against him because of that. Plus, he tends to brawl too much. If he had gotten a few takedowns against Lawler (nobody ever tries to take Robbie down) he would've won that fight and might be the champ right now.
Artem Lobov vs DJ. UFC let's make it happen
Tony's been writing a book? What's it called Cat? And then you open the book and there is a picture of a cat and an arrow with the word Cat in bold. Then you turn the page and its another type of cat with an arrow and the word Cat!.  Just 50 pages of that. I'd buy it.
so glad condits back. and so much respect to Alessio. awesome to hear from him and get some insight on how everything went from his perspective.
Tony Ferguson is so irritating and bodacious! Man, I can't wait to see someone knock this clown out.
greatest my arse.guy beats no named cans, gtfoh
Tonys mind is bullet proof !!
Tony is the real champ, Conor is a paper champ !!! Lmao 😂
Tony the real champ
Tony is so intense he made a Starbucks story intense
Caldwell did not win that fight that's all he did was hold and stall
So Ian McCall basically is saying he pulled a wanderlai??? Usada came over and....wtf???
marissamal
Straight up
Tony straight up Ferguson
NBK IS BACK!!!!
Tony Absolutely Ferguson
Tony Ferguson rocks!
Dis, is not a terapy session - Ian McCall's Skype connection.
Ian McCall wants loads of money to fight but can't actually fight cause his hand is jacked LOL
Tony needs to take a chill pill lol
i did that armbar in big bear
Carlos Condit is the man. My fav fighters : Diaz Bros,Condit, Rory, Gegard Mousasi, and for sure DJ, TJ and Rockhold have a very well rounded skillset and a high fight IQ.
wtf no time stamps who dropped the ball
I keep thinking that max holloway is a really cool guy
So Ariel thinks the ufc's bantemweight division is the sister division to bellators version ayyt ariel i see you
2:56:54 Was that a cart from Tony?
Ric: Who said it was the best sub?\nAriel: OHHHHHH MMYYYYY,,,\n\nHAHA favorite part is when Ariel and Ric just talk. Both actually understand and know what is happening.
every time a bigger name fighter has a bad weight cut.....OMG we need more weight classes.   because you know that will end bad weight cuts.   Forget all the factors that come into play.
theeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee mixed martial arts hour back in. your llife.  same time same place same blababalal until then i say peace......im outta heeeeerre
Maybe in the 165lb division...AAAAAYYYYOOOOO!
The mighty wizz bar.. really?
DJ and Max are class acts...
Tony vs Conor....Let's go! Hey....hello....hello....Conor? Conor?? where u at? :)))
Conor's are exhibition fights , ha, ha , ha good one Max
Condit is and has always been a fighter's fighter. Gotta love the guy, hope he makes a run and gets another crack at Tyron. #NBK
Tony is great fighter but if he's that hittable in first 5 min against Conor he might get ko'd.
What? Flying Suplex Armbar?? The next finishing move on DJ's list will be Zangeifs 'Final Atomic Buster'. You read it here first.
lol @ ric thinking that push by GSP is real and that he's upset
Might need to re-upload this --- missing the sound first 4 minutes of Ariel talking :(
Was it muted in the first 4mim for everyone else too?
I like Tony but he can be full of himself sometimes when he talks about how exactly he likes the fight to go down after a win.  Give me a break Tony....nobody wants a war like the fight you had with RDA.  And definitely you did not want to be mounted by Kevin Lee (you weren't getting out of that if it wasn't for the bell).  Just say it like it is Tony.  With that being said, you're a great fighter.  \n\nHope you get that Mcgregor fight.
Saki vs. Roundtree is a dope ass fight.
Tony might be weird and a genius at the same time.
The earth is flat
Ferguson will desyroy mcgregor.
2:56:55 ferguson farts
Sometimes Ariels asks the dumbest questions ever
Stamp times, please? And how lazy that you couldn't even list the guest list initially - well, it's even in numerical order. And when they do the time they're usually erroneous. Ariel is the best MMA journalist and this is the best mma podcast. I do appreciate all the effort but just such significant things, but it's somewhat unprofessional. :)
DJ wants the easy route. Lame fighter. Retire already
Mousasi the real lb for lb best sorry DJ.
Caldwell breaking the record for most stoned guest of all time
conor will destroy this guy
Ferguson vs khabib this fight make sens for us!!😂😂
Man, Ariel checks his laptop too much when his guests are talking.

El Cucuy. love the work ethic and your fighting style... you are a really great fighter, a top 3 lightweight in the world, but your striking game and movement. i can't see anything but you getting KO'd in 1 vs conor...and vs khabib...if Lee took you down that many times my lord the difference.
LIST OF GUESTS PLEASE
Im a musician of 30yrs. \n I must say Everlast's performance was VERYimportant, he grasped that and wasted nothing, he took that moment did Xactly what was needed, healing. Big respect to the man. BIG RESPECT!
You should of had DJ on longer
Lol Tony, delusional. Conor gonna kill him within 2. Lando Vannata had you doing the chicken dance and you think you can handle a combo from Conor?
I wish Condit will go into acting, the guy has something about him, I wanna see him in some movies
Lol tony is so lucky he loses weight so easy. Should be at 170 cheating realy
MMA is GAY.
From a person who suffers with mental health issues I send you much love Simon. Thank you. 💚
This video is wonderful, thanks Simon. My mental health is bit of a dumpster fire at the moment and all these world mental health day discussions are catching me off guard, but I think are exactly what I need, if that makes sense. Midwinter was a book that destroyed me, and I didn't even have the personal connection you did - there's just something so vulnerable and beautiful about a book that expresses sadness that well. I read my favorite book (The Mill on the Floss) when I was going through a rough patch, and it just articulated things inside me that I'd never thought were important enough to be captured on paper. Anyway, going off on my own tangents now, thanks again for your thoughts
Great video Simon and thank you for sharing your mental health story with us. I absolutely agree that books can help with some mental health symptoms/ situations. I suffer from anxiety and depression, with some periods of my life the depression was more intense and others the anxiety was more intense. I still get anxious about work related things or personal relationship where I feel that I didn't do something right or good enough and will go over it in my head. I have learned that I need to debrief at the end of the day by having time to escape into a book and have a cup of tea. This helps me to get away for a bit and not dwell on things that can be irrational. I think this was a helpful video and was great to hear how books assisted you through some of your mental health situations.
Simon thank you so much for this video and your honesty in it. Books have definitely helped my mental health in terms of self help books building up my self esteem and resilience, but also like you say getting lost in fiction. The times when my physical health has been really bad I don't know what I would have done without books - I so needed that escape. Thanks again for this video xx
Thank you so so so much for posting this Simon! As someone who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past I think its so important to us all to talk about it and know we are not alone. I think books of all kinds can not only be therapeutic for us when we are going through a difficult time mentally but also physically. I know myself when my physical health has been bad it then has had a knock on effect on my mental health-reading has helped me escape for a while when physically the only choice ive had is to rest, read and escape! :)  Thanks again -you're a gem! or a gem of a bear you might say! :) xoxx
This was a wonderful video, Simon.  Thanks for your honesty in sharing your mental health experiences.  I often have suffered from hormonal depression, but never to the extent that is was an issue for me.  \nReading has been a lifeline for me when I have been through some pretty horrible experiences.  I don't have too many memories of before I was 11 when my parents split up.  Reading was my saviour then.  I was sexually abused for about 5 years in my early teen years, and later on my stepfather was a horribly abusive alcoholic.  Throughout all those years reading was my safe place - and it continues to the place where I feel least threatened by the world, where I feel the safest, where I feel I belong and where I don't have to do anything or be anyone but myself.  \nNowadays my own life is a lot less harrowing but my 31 year old son suffers from schizophrenia and my daughter has been diagnosed with clinical depression as well as fibromyalgia so mental health is very close and all around me.\nYou and I have vastly different tastes in reading - I am a popular fiction reader through and through, but your channel is such a welcome relief from all the noise noise noise that goes on in this world.  You are a lovely man and I always look forward to your name popping up in my subscription feed.  Thank you for your content and I wish you nothing but wellness and happiness.  Love from NZ
Reading can make you escape in the darkest of times. I feel that's what's informed my reading from a young age and what let me find fantasy novels as an escape from reality since a young age. Thanks for making this video and opening up a discussion!
Ahh I love the video!
Thank you for sharing, Simon! As someone who is suffering a great deal from a debilitating  mix of depression, anxiety  and stress, I felt a lot better just to listen to another person who has been through it before. It made me feel less lonely and really hopeful about overcoming it all.
Thank you so much, Simon! It is really helps.\nI've just started to take meds for depression last week, finally gave in =D. Mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, also fear of death, etc. have been with me from teen years, more than a decade already, and well, it is hard. At the moment I'm winning, because I've learnt how calm myself, even without meds (internal dialogue). Movies, TV shows and sleep are my other treatment. Unfortinately, I have this problem when I can't really concentrate if I feel sad or am caught in a loop of depressive thoughts, so I can't read. Hope that this tendency will pass with time.\nLots of love to you. Stay strong!
Lovely video Simon; I appreciate your honesty about mental health.  I needed this, as I am a bit shaky in the mental health department right now. I would like to hear your review of A Line Made by Walking.
Simon, thank you so much for this video! I've been going through a bad patch lately, and have been for pretty much this whole year, but I've found myself reading a ton lately and it has helped me so much. Books really can act as an escape and a way to not have to think about what's going on around you for a bit. I've truly found that books have helped me tons over the years I've been an avid reader.
Thanks so much for creating and sharing this video. I was completed sucked in, and enjoyed the bits you would have edited out - love seeing that stuff. On the topic of dealing with grief, have you read H is for Hawk? I own a copy, but haven't read it yet, but it generally comes up a lot on the topic of grief and processing change, etc. and comes highly recommended from the BookRiot gang. Anyway, I really appreciate this video, and generally, your videos are always a bright spot in my day no matter how things are going. Thank you!
Thank you so much for making this video and being so open. I work as a mental health therapist and I’m often talking to people about what they are reading and how it helps. It is definitely something people struggle with more than we know. I truly believe every time someone shares their story they make someone else feel more “normal”. Thank you for being brave.
So needed, great video.
This video is wonderful, I've been feeling down lately and your videos always cheer me up. It's wonderful to see more people talking about mental health.
Was having a terrible day today (just woke up like that) and this was great to see. Didn't even know i needed it until I clicked. Thanks x
I don't have a lot to contribute to the conversation, but I really loved this video.
Suffering from mood swings since going through menopause, I know exactly what you mean and you're right, reading helps!! Watching book tube videos helps. But I have phases when I can't read depressing stories or very suspenseful stories but there are a lot of other books I can read instead! Thank you for be so honest about your problems.
Thanks for sharing, I send you lots of love and hugs simon. xxxx
I wish I could 'love' this video. *massive virtual squeeze*
You are wonderful and life affirming and a joy! Thank you for all your vlogs but especially this one.  You said so much that i am going to ponder over. A couple of things about reading helping mental health in my experience: depression is exhausting and especially talking to people during depression is just too much effort. I crave silence at that time but as yiu say that can cut you off. But you can read, think, and in a way interact while being silent when yiu read. Also reading is like exercise or maintenance for the emotions and mind on a daily basis. We develop and hone our responses and capacity for imagination and empathy while we read and that pays off in hard times.
I recognized what I interpret as nerves near the end about sharing this, and I just wanted to say that I am glad you did.
That is such a touching story (I'm at the story of 10 year old Simon) and I'm sending you good thoughts.
Can I give this video like milion thumbs up...?
Wow, great video Simon. I loved reading A Line Made by Walking and Midwinter too and it's so moving hearing how you connected with them personally.
Thank you Simon for this video. I suppose it was really hard to talk about it, for that reason I even more appreciate you shared your experiences with us. Sure it will provide help/support to others. Thank you again :)\n\nPS. You are absolutely right, your channel  does bring happy moments :)))) (plus some serious added value as well)
A wonderful video thank you! I appreciate all you've done and said. Sending you love
Powerful. This is a video I shall return to again and again. ❤️
Thank you so much for your brave video. Really honest, vulnerable and important! Wanted to give you a big hug at the end :)
I am really glad you decided to upload this video. We do share some similar experiences, especially regarding grief, so, as you said, it‘s so helpful to know you‘re not alone.
This was a truly lovely video Simon. Thanks for sharing. Reading is generally speaking a source of stress relief for me, but as you said it can also be a balm in terms of finding others (whether fictional or not) that have had shared experiences. I have gone through one or two periods of intense anxiety and that actually makes it really hard to focus on reading. I've found that audio books are actually better when you have too much nervous energy so that you can take walks or run or whatnot and at the same time listen to a story. Stories can really help draw the mind away from negative loops and focus on something else.
Thanks so much for doing this video and for being so open. I can relate to what you were saying about reading being helpful for your mental health and comforting you through tough times. although it's only this year that I have returned to reading & found book tube and it has a been a real comfort and life saver for me. I have read 80 books since May when I started reading again and I can't believe that I stopped reading for 7 years!!! Thanks again for sharing 😍
Thank you so much for this video!! I live with a mental health condition and at its worst it makes me very socially isolated (nature of the beast innit?) but books have always kept me feeling connected to the world, at least in some small way and have proved invaluable. I've always loved the Jeanette Winterson quote Art is an air pocket in an upturned boat,  that's what books have been for me. Also - sometimes if I struggle to engage with the world and have to retreat for a while, when I start to feel ready to re-connect I find spending some time knitting (other crafty pursuits are available! ;) and watching a backlog of booktube videos enormously therapeutic. It allows me that 'halfway house' of feeling like I'm hanging out with lovely people while not having the immediate pressures that socialising entails. So, yes, thanks, loved your unedited honesty - wonderful video!
Thanks Simon you probably just helped a lot of people.
This is great. I have a mental health blog and agree, although I am not a doctor, just sharing what works for me does help people so thank you. And thank you for talking about MH too! I would love a goldsmiths video and or a line made by walking video. All of the videos. ALSO. Can you tell us when the dates for the costa are? Like longlist and shortlist and announcements? I can't find it anywhere but I might just be being silly. Xxx
Thanks so much Simon, I found that really helpful. I started reading again because of grief, my daughter died. I found comfort and understanding in books. It helped me comprehend what my family and I was going through. I still look out for good grief stories.
This is wonderful. I needed this video right now.  Thank you thank you thank you.
Fantastic video. I've also had issues in the past, and often still struggle with anxiety, it's great to hear people speaking openly about these things. I also think books definitely help. I'm a bit of an introvert (like a lot of bookish people I suppose) and have a tendency to isolate myself. I went to a talk last night and Ali Smith mentioned isolation and reading, how you can feel alone and go and sit by yourself in a room, but as soon as you open a book that room fills with people.
Thank you for sharing your own experiences Simon .Reading helps me escape. 👍sleeping helps too. XXX
There was one book I picked up after my brother died that helped me a lot.  The best part of this book was being told to acknowledge your feelings and allow them to be...for a bit.  It was also good to have an activity to do, something that made me feel like I was doing something to dig out of my pit because the book actually has tasks to work through.   I still grieve for him 12 years later but it doesn't take me into the pit of hell when it comes over me now.  The Grief Recovery Handbook  by  John W. James, Russell Friedman
This is one of my favourite videos of yours. Thank you for addressing this difficult topic that's also been/is very present in my life, and for being so vulnerable and honest! I'm going to try and get my hands on a copy of A Line Made By Walking asap. Thanks for doing so much good, Simon! x
Great video! And what an important topic!\n\nMy first major downward spiral was about 12 yrs ago. I had just discovered Audible and, wanting the biggest bang for my buck, I searched for the longest books with the best ratings. I stumbled onto Outlander by Diana Gabaldon and was instantly captivated by Davina Porter's narration and the main character of Claire. Davina's Claire became my best friend. She was smart and tough and I just fell into her story. Reading was definitely an escape from terrible things going on in my real life but also gave me a reason to hang in there through each day so I could listen to the next chapter at bedtime. That book is 40+ hours long so it lasted many many days. And there are a ton of sequels. I'm not exaggerating when I say that Claire saved my life. Eventually I made my way to therapy and a good doctor. But I'd never have made it that far if it weren't for that book that just hooked me. I hope everyone who struggles with depression finds a book, or many books, to fall into one day at a time.\n\nOn a side note, you are looking particularly handsome today Simon! (Swear I'm not a stalker. Just speaking the truth 😊)
Brave video Simon, and beautifully delivered.  I also like to be alone, but not lonely, and given my physical isolation, I feel like my Booktube family are my most important and easiest to access portal to a social life with like-minded people.  I'm in a beautiful place and mostly thrive on the isolation, but some days I'm so glad when you pop in for a chat.  You are funny and wise and self-deprecating, such good qualities in an imaginary friend.\n\nOddly enough, I've just begun reading a short story in bed at night before going to sleep and it helps enormously.  I'm currently reading 'The Day I Ate Whatever I Wanted'  by Elizabeth Berg and it's very good.\n\nIncidentally, I've also just finished Tin Man (recommended by you and others).  Absolute heartbreaker and I loved it.  Thanks for the chat.
Wonderful video, Simon. Hugs and more hugs.
You are such a good egg Simon, you really are. Talking about mental health needs to be continually kept relevant. I can't even talk about the things which have effected my mental health in the past ... you are very brave xx
Thank you so much Simon. This was a wonderful video! I truly appreciate your openness. My aunt introduced me to Will Schwalbe's beautiful book.  I've also read his more recent work, Books for Living.  He is a wonderful bookish companion. I cannot imagine a life without books. I find such solace in reading. Thank you again for sharing your own experience.
amen....to all the here's to's that you mentioned..and here's to sharing as best we can and here's to you simon for your generosity in creating this video.
Best video yet! Thank you for sharing your very personal story. I can relate. I’ve had anxiety for a long time and my depression spurts come and go as well. I agree that books can be a form of escapism. Reading them as well as just wandering around bookshops works for me. I also have a rather large dvd collection if I need a quick escape fix. I also think is true that every once in a while we find a book that speaks to us and leaves us all a little less lonely. All my best to you!
It is an amazing gift you've given us by sharing your journey - calmly, kindly, warmly. With regards to the grief, A Year of Magical Thinking, by Joan Didion, made me realize I wasn't alone.
Thank you for sharing. I think we put so much emphasis on being yourself and uniqueness in general that we forget how important and comforting it is to be reminded that, in the end, we're actually not so unique. I am not the only person in the world experiencing a problem. Someone else has been there. You are not alone. Someone else has felt that. Etc.
Thanks for such a wonderful video Simon! Mental health is exactly what you said, something that we need not be afraid to talk about! I'm so glad to hear that you liked A Line Made by Walking. I was recently able to pick it up for only a few dollars as an ebook. I'm really looking forward to getting to it!
I don't even know where to start with this comment - I have been binge watching BookTube today and thinking about starting my own and I come across your channel at 1:30am - firstly it's lovely to find a fellow Brit, secondly, it's lovely to see someone my age and thirdly, I think you are basically the male version of me!  (I should state I love ALL BookTubers, but meeting a Brit the same age as me has given me renewed hope that I can indeed give this a go!\n\nI smiled, I LOL'd and I teared up watching this.  I haven't ben through anything like what you have but so much of your journey sounds like mine - I loved it when you said I don't like feeling lonely but I quite like being alone. this is something I have struggled to get other people to understand so it is refreshing to hear someone else say it.  And I totally, TOTALLY have the paranoia thing too, in fact it's what caused me to lose a job 18 months ago .. well that an the panic attacks I was having almost daily (mostly due to the paranoia and anxiety I experienced in my role and at the place I worked,\n\nThank you so much for opening up so honestly and eloquently (tangents are fun). I shall stop here otherwise .. well it's nearly 2am now and I really should get to bed ..!\n\nPS - you have a new stalker ;)
Thank you for this heartfelt video. When my sin died I spent a lot of time with Jane Austen. I know those characters/people so well and they never let me down. I didn't want any surprises or mysteries just good writing and friends (well, Elizabeth Bennet is my friend!). Thanks again.
Excellent video, Simon. I'm sure that wasn't easy to share such personal moments but thank you for sharing your story with us. I think so many of us have suffered at one time in our lives with mental health, but it's so great to see so many people opening up about their struggles and breaking the stigma against mental illness. I can't think of any books in particular that have helped me through a particularly rough patch, but I definitely turn to books (and booktube!) as a source of comfort or distraction when life gets hard.
Thank you for sharing this video it really helped. I suffer with mental health and it's nice to hear that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling
thanks for sharing your experiences, Simon. I think videos like this always, always help! glad you decided to make it :)
Thank you for sharing! I think it’s hard to share something so personal. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for years. It’s been fine for awhile, but I lost my dad in December last year which triggered my depression. I have struggled all year. The reason I’ve said this is because I’ve tried to read for escape, but it is just not working for me. I’ve been in the biggest slumpiest slump of my life since he got sick in November of last year. I’ve read 30 books. I’ve probably started and put down 100. It’s just so frustrating because I want to read, but I just can’t. I’m hoping to pull out of it soon because I agree with you that it is good for depression.
Thanks for such a personal video Simon, it's actually really refreshing. I've never really thought of reading and how it relates or influences my mental health before, but I now realise that I am someone who, when lonely or depressed, either obsessively reads or gets in the biggest slump ever. There is no in between. \nThe specific books I read also tend to influence my mental health, as some books really give me a real 'high' (mostly because they're just really good books), whilst others really depress me. And I don't even always know specifically why a book has had a negative influence on my mental health, so that's a bit annoying.\nI can see how this video (and others) may feel like therapy, as just reflecting on such things in my mind sort of felt like therapy, haha.\nI'm really intrigued by A Line Made by Walking, but I feel like I may relate to it more if I read it in a couple of years, so I'm in doubt whether or not to buy it..
I have the same issue. Some days are wonderful and my excitement is off the charts and others days its like the world is upside down. I know you were hesistant to do this video but I appreciated hearing someone say they have the same issues I do. Makes ya feel not so alone.
Thank you so much for sharing this video. It's really helpful to hear about others' experiences and how different people get through the difficult moments in life, however long they last. Big hugs from me and my cat!
Yes Simon, I feel the same way as you.  I like being alone alot but I do not feel lonely when I’m reading because “books are my friends”.  Totally agree.  Thanks for sharing!
It's been really helpful to watch this semi-cuppa and a catch up/ reminisce with you Simon.
I suffer regularly with depression manifesting in self doubt, paranoia and manic spending.  Events over the last 2 years makes it hard for me to feel people truly like me for who I am or will hurt or leave me.  Recent health issues mean that more than ever my hobbies root me to reality and for this it is reading and art journalling.  I started Youtube last year and have done some book buddy reads and chatted with some lovely people.  I am so pleased you felt comfortable enough to be so open about something so personal xx
Thanks for this video. I work from home, which a lot of people think is the dream, and it is a really lonely 😔 I miss out on socialising out of office hours because I have fibromyalgia which makes it hard to sit in a hard chair for a long time and I need my rest. Your videos really help me feel less lonely. I do worry it’s a bit sad that I feel I know you but it always cheers me up to see a new video from you no matter the topic... well I would draw the line at Simon goes hunting or something 😂 I’m currently reading it’s all in your head. A guide to getting your shit together by Rae Earl at the moment which I think is meant for a slightly younger audience than me (I’m 40) but nonetheless is a good book on different facets of mental health and where to go or what to do to help yourself. Anyway thanks for the videos xx
Brilliant, Simon.  Thank you.
Thank you, Simon. <3 <3
I completely agree that everything is spectrums, and that we should be open about our experiences when it is safe to do so.  Thanks for sharing, Simon.
My parents died in my 30s and i wasnt. ready.  I dont think anyone really is.  It wasnt books that got me though it was my Dads records the swing of Goodman and the jaxz of Coltrane and Miles. I wish i had Grief is a thing with feathers back then.
Thanks for this video Simon, and sorry to hear about the difficult times you’ve been through. I can definitely say that your videos - and those of some other lovely book tubers - have helped me an awful lot during some low times, so thank you! Also, books themselves have helped me to escape, take my mind off things and have sometimes reminded me that there are other people out there who have felt the same things as me, and have put it much more eloquently than I ever could. That’s the reason ’A Line made by Walking’ is one of my favourite books of the year too. That and the beautiful writing.
It's really amusing that americans get offended by this, while europeans love it. This is pure rock 'n' roll. A drunk former rock star who lost his once great voice screaming like Johnny Rotten and forgetting the lyrics of a song by his own favorite band, then inviting a random girl up on stage to sing and then ending everything stage diving. This is pure punk rock. Not some americanized plastic crap like Green Day.
Legend has it liams still crowd surfing
Liam the last fuckin rock and roll star!
It's alright, he was just fuckin' drunk 😂 It could have been perfect if he was sober. But it's not THAT embarrassing. People act like it was a huge tragedy ... don't be too serious pals!
Liam is the ultimate frontman, he just owns it
He went straight for the chorus after the first verse and forgot there's a second one first, haha
Sucks up to the godsmack version tbh
Who is the girl?
Somehow this is still amazing even though liam fucked the words lol
Epic moment, The Legend Squad !!!
Weak out of tune wtfs happened to the voice of a generation just sounds tired shouty and naizily
reading the lyrics of his favorite band?going to a chorus at the start where it should be another verse?Getting the words wrong in the first verse?being out of key?And then resorting to pulling someone out of the audience to finish it for him, and as shit as she is shes still better than him?\nI wouldnt have my hood up, id have a bag over my head.Fucking joker.
Fucking rubbish. Useless cunt. He doesn't even know the arrangement of the song nor does he know the lyrics. Look em up before you stone island fans start spouting shite. The guys a fucking knob end no wonder Noel fucked off. At least the brains he had went to his head unlike his semi-retarded brother.
That’s not pure rock n roll - that’s pure embarrassing
Golden! Golden!... Liam knows what are the good things of life hahahaha
I love liam, but he couldn't have fucked that up any more if he tried.
Liam knows that FF concert is the only thing on the world you can do that. Biblical.
If he wasn't smashed out of his face and he had autoque on so he didn't forget the words and that irritating woman wasn't there this would have been even more amazing...even doing this half hearted his vocals are brilliant and it suits him even more than lennon
I think I just saw Liam Gallagher's ass crack.. \n-Dave Grohl
Foo at city stadium next year hope Liam comes that has to happen my home town will shit itself
If he just came out there and sang it properly and pretented to be a decent frontman, I would probably just watch it once and never again cos these guest performances are boring anyway. But I swear I have watched this like 50 times already and it's also so much fun reading comments of people complaining how pissed off they are with this. Why do people take music so seriously? It's just entertainment, nothing more. The dude was obviously having fun. And by the way, Lennon doesn't give a f**k what's going on here cos he's dead!
supposedly a big beatles fans... doesn't know lyrics to one of their biggest songs XD
Dave grohl went to the back because of embarrassment or rock n roll?
Over Dave. Over Joe. Over Taylor. Over Everyone!
Liam! The best
O Liam é bom demaaais! É puro rock and roll, ele vive a música, quando eu o ouço eu sinto a força de um verdadeiro rockstar entrando pelos meus ouvidos
Liam is back... LEGEND
Liam is pure gold
Super-great! But short pants are so passe
Think what this needs is another guitar
Totally awesome, the best of USA and uk united on one stage.
It would have been biblical if Joe Perry had knocked Liam out with his guitar.
Wow Liam is Rock n Roll.
Shame that twat Laim is in it
I was there... Liam is such a fuckin toolbag
So some douche bag comes up and talks in the mic ... doesn't sing.\nAnd this gets 1K+ thumbs up?\nLOL!\nFU
Nice video thanks for sharing. please visit my channel for more videos like this \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW6xNtP6pnfXXXXp7cvSTOw
How any one can watch this and not realize how badly Liam butchered both the timing of the lyrics and the lyrics themselves is beyond me
Mic cupping like a pro, Liam really fucked this up
Shorts and a hoodie? How old does the twat think he is? And he can't reach the high notes. And I don't care how hard he tries, he will never be Joh Lennon.

Liam reminds me of a softer version of Phil Anselmo in this.
Liam can't sing like he used to. How voice sounds like an old man trying to do a Liam Gallagher impersonation from the 90's.
Best part is I was there and HOLY FUCK trust me when Joe Perry got on stage\nI punched my friend in the arm and said This is gonna be fuckin AWESOME!
Why is he reading the lyrics it's a beatles classic?
The funny thing is ppl here worried about he fucked up the lyrics. Hahaha.   LIAM.  A FUCKING LEGEND
When random crowd chick knows the song better than dude from one of England's greatest rock bands
Its a mash up but I liked it.   Not about getting it spot on exactly; having a good time is more important.
I love Liam but i'm seriously disappointed in him for fucking the lyrics up!!!
Oof how the mighty have fallen. He's too old to be doing the trainwreck dance. Be more like Noel. Classy, cocky, confident, delivers.
People taking Liam too serious are either Americans or boring.
It’s the 2nd coming....
this thing is a total nonsens haha
Lead guitar is so off...like liam...damn
I'm the like 1k 😎
Who TF doesn't know the words to this?
Didn't know gallagher liked aerosmith \nI know that the beatles originally did this
Sounds like an old drunk
I fucking love this!  Kinda wish too see it again with Liam being sober haha but he's just being the rock n roll legend he is
The video cut it off but right after this Grohl was laughing his ass off and just said into the mic yeah THAT was planned
So talented!!!\nTrue Rock'n'Roll Star
Now we see how tough Liam is! He dares to come and present the song without knowing the word! Who else dares? 10/10
Pure Rock'n'roll Jam !!! Pure Legend(s) !!
Sometimes shit don't go well and that's what makes it rock n fucking roll people. Enjoy it when it's great & when it's shit. Just laugh and rock out 🤘
crowdsurfing yeah!
That was Koranic.
Zero Fucks Liam
tan Liam <3
Liam fucking it up again.
gostosa
Jeesh look at all the sycophantic comments! Cringe.
Wrong lyrics!!!!
HOLY SHIT
Hahaha
Manc cock
Did Liam get back alive tho????😐
In Love
Iconic
Hi
Piece of crap.
Am I awake
This collab would just never happen
Pure trash.
Für den Musikexpress ist es Fremdschämen,für uns ist es Rock n Roll...
Liam Gallagher is a massive prick. This was pretty shit. (I'm only here coz it's trending).
Warum ist dieser Sänger so beliebt? Es ist eines der bekanntesten Songs der Beatles und er bekommt es nicht auf die Reihe sich den Text zu merken steht auf der Bühne als ob er ein Stock im A.... hat.
Liam Gallagher: Claims to be a massive John Lennon fan, doesn't know the words of Come Together smh
THIS IS ROCK N ROLL, SHIT MORONS
Am I the only one that feels it was kinda douchey that he had to have the lyrics in front of him, even more so to hold it up in front of the crowd? Liam seems beyond bored this point... His performance of Wonderwall at Cal Jam was sad, just blah...
Ladies and gentlemen. Liam Gallagher completely destroying a Beatles song.
What you don’t know what happened after 😅\n\nhttps://youtu.be/XBs1wBMRDcY
Omg he doesn't even know the lyrics, he is supposed to be a big Beatles fan 😅
You'd think for a massive Beatles fan and wannabe-Lennon that he'd know this song...
This is my favourite Beatles song...\n\n\nShame Liam sung it
Careful with the chicks Liam, you’ll get in trouble again.
Looking at some of the comments on here - I just sometimes think not all Americans 'get' Liam Gallagher - in Britain he's like a God (for my group of friends/family anyway growing up!) loads of people commenting calling him a douche-bag or whatever - I don't think they get it - it's just supposed to be abit of fun and the guy was probably tanked up and just having a laugh with the crowd-surfing etc - long live the greatness that is Oasis! X stay young, love forever and don't look back in anger ;-) X
Liam ist ein riesen scheiß Idiot.
Liam Gallagher is a prick
ONE word - Disgusting.
Now I remember why I always liked Noel Gallagher more.
The only good spider is a dead spider
Military ideas.\n\n-France vs. UK\n-EU vs. China\n-Saudi Arabia vs. Iran\n-North Korea vs. Japan
Largest in mythical creatures video?
Malaysia is not Indonesia
The blue whale is also the largest creature that has ever lived on Earth
Blue whale is the boss.
Just remember there's always a bigger fish
What about the anaconda there is reports that some are 60 feet lads
donald trump is biggest creature in america
Can you do a comparison on tiger vs lion this will be amazing and world's strongest man vs a Gorilla
all the fatties are in this video
Where are the Feminist
I ride my Godzilla to work
Ah u forgot Barney he’s much bigger then all these animals
That was a bad pun, spiders are not bugs.
what if bloop really is an animal amd still live today?
You forgot to add the largest reptile
Everyone knows Godzilla is totally *REAL* ...
The fact that the Komoto Dragon can run as fast as a healthy human is terrifying.
The weight for the Mini Cooper given comparing it to a blue whale's heart was for an original Mini (1960's to 2000) not the 2000 and later model that is illustrated.  The later ones are about a thousand pounds heavier.
A mini cooper is only 600kg? seems legit
Please use the metric system.\nI don't understand the 'feet' and I don't want to open google to convert feet to meter every time you give a value.
The modern 3rd wave feminist weighs an estimated 1.2million metric tons, it eats an estimated 69 tons of ice cream and cheese sticks every day. Their large fat bodies allow them go last years without food, giving them plenty of time to post shitty pictures of themselves on Tumblr.
Being eaten by a snake would be so horrible, it's so slow.
i dare to press read more\n\n\n\n\nwell i wasted your time haha
My mum is the biggest creature ever
I got bitten by a Komodo dragon in 2016
you know what...titans are coming
A tarantula can live to how long?????
Americans are the fattest creatures that exist right now.
A man eaten by 10 years old .... how pathetic .... !!
Please tell me there is a largest creatures of all time video coming up?
Why isn’t my ex girlfriend featured in this video?
What about the saltwater crocodile? Or the Argentinosarus?
HAH\nDAT PUN\nthis is why i love this channel lol
When you realize a spider can live longer than a snake
Military comparison\nIndonesia and Malaysia
I hav been up close to the golathial bird eating spider once,the whale shark and that's it...or is there more...idk...oh wait the elephant and a ostrich
Ostrich can run up to 60mph?
I wish I could have seen a blue Whale but life doesn't always give u what u want
In the USA, the biggest animal is Donald Trump.😂😂😂😂
Anicondas dont get close to 25 feet they get really fat and like 15 feet
where are the country comparison vids???
Why are none of those snakes anacondas
Everybody knows the largest creature in the world is your MOM
I've been  close to a whale shark
Do Godzilla vs King Kong next i mean obviously Godzilla would win because he’s an extra 200 feet tall and weighs 10 times more.The older films portrayed Kong winnings because he was the same height and weight which wouldn’t work because last year he was 100 feet tall so he grows 50 meet every 40-50 years so Godzilla will be way taller then him still
Loved the video, would have liked to see a human resemblance or size compared thingy :)
A 9 meter Sucuri was captured and they leave the animal in his habitat, this was last week in Caçu, Goiás, Brazil.
Yes I've meant one of these creatures and it was staring at me like a rapist and then tried to bite a persons hand\nIt is the mighty ostrich
What about he biggest land predator? The polar bear BOI
This video was published in 2017, a Mini Cooper now weighs 2600-3000lbs. You meant it weighs 1300 kg.
Africa doesn't have water because of the elephants
Wrong the biggest creature to walk the earth is trumps ego.
I've seen a Blue Whale up close, although it was dead and washed up on the coast. Would have been about 25m long and you could smell its rotting carcass from about a kilometer away. Standing right next to it the stench was so strong that you could taste the air....and it didn't taste nice. Quite a few people made the trek to have a look at it, tho some turned back vomiting from the odour long before getting in sight of the putrefying mammal/fish :)
How about the clock spider?
OK... How do you convert 33 foot into 400 kilo????
Y’all should do mars facts and statistics
Okay How about How much water we need in a Lifetime?
Trapped in a snake MIGHT??? Be scarier than an ostrich catching up with your car???
Ummm why did he not but Jake Paul's  balls on there?
You should have included the polar bear, it’s the largest land carnivore and the largest one on record weighed over a ton
The largest toothed carnivore and predator to ever live is the modern sperm whale and the largest invertebrate is the colossal squid which the sperm whale hunts
Nato vs China and Russia
The only Godzilla I know of is the R32, R33, R34, and R35 GTR.
,,Size can differ depending on the animal,, . . . You dont say lol
There really is nothing like hanging out in a hammock in the amazon rain forest with a capybara pissing all over the floor....like a really shit dog, they are adorable and foul at the same time
Liked because the Sun is P4P the worst UK newspaper next to the Daily Mail.
I don’t exist???
I live in Queensland Australia as well
Isn't a blue whale the size of a football field

best vids on youtube: The Infographics Show
I absolutely love watching the videos on this channel while eating a casual meal. Get super stoked whenever there's a new upload. \n\nPlease continue pumping out great content!
A moment of silence for the Indonesian guy who got eaten by an anaconda...
ahahhahahahahahahhhahahahaahahahaa 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I'd just surprised that The Infografic show is talking about Indonesia btw like if you are from Indonesia
I haven't even finished and I know I'm going to feel down after this video D:
0-2 years old you can get away with ANYTHING
Why do they say that Math skills are highest at 50 years old but show Physics stuff instead -.-
Best at playing chess? Most people can’t even play
From the jump this video is dumb, the younger age learning languages better  thing is a myth.
Such videos need evidence. scientific evidence or at least mention a research because this world has a media that is full of mistakes
Ok I will wait to get 50 and then deal with mathematics
Cant wait to be 60 or over so I can say whatever the f I want lol
Wait... so you're telling me I have to wait half a century in order to be decent at math... *sigh*
That's for middle class , what about the other humans?

Women's peak strength is earlier than 25
i one year over least likely to die, *sigh*
Anyone know who the music is by?
Or just go smoke a blunt
Women make highest salary at 39 and met at 48 wtf are the feminists talking about
I actually felt the most alive, and my future felt the most promising at 23. By the time I turned 24 though, after a few failed job interviews and rejections later.. realized this life thing aint easy.
this is the most depressing video ever
i am least likely to die :/\n*W H Y*
I haven’t begun to peak
I just want to know when will be my peak dick size.
I'm 18. I guess this is my last year of not being retarded
Age 31, when your metabolism says “fuck you”.
Lol, so you are at peace with yourself and your body just before you die.....
Does anyone know the song?
75-84 most comfortable with your body???? Are you freaking kidding me????????????
It would make my day if someone could tell me what song this is.
When you dont fit any of the above 😂😂😂
This explains why i keep getting straight F's in my math class....cant wait to get 50 and boom....
Well ain't this video all BS
Some of these don't make sense.
Yeah...just can’t wait until I can play chess well.
Yeah I'm looking forward to having great math skills. You know, 30-40 years after school
why at the end did it say there's always one thing to look forward to then they all die
Well this wasn't nearly as depressing as I thought it would be.
Even though this isn't full on fact (or fact at all) this video is uplifting to people who are scared of aging.
I call bullshit on most of them
What a load of crap.
Dnt watch this just experience ur own surprises In the things that make you, YOU ! (:

NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. THE CHURCH IS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE NOT IN THE INSTITUTIONS. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!! ACTS 7:48\n\nBE YE SEPARATE FROM THE WORLD!! BE YE SEPERATE FROM THE LOVERS OF THIS WORLD!
Highest satisfaction in life 23? Well, the rest of life is going to suck haha.
But I thought no one likes you when you're 23?
I'm 18 and i noticed I'm faster at reading and reflexes this year compared to other years no joke. Lol.

Great....Ill die before the things I need happen lol
Did the really do women are most attractive and not do men are most attractive?
What are you the best at RIGHT NOW? \n.... sleeping.
They forgot:\nThe age when you are best at popping a boner: 12 years old
So these are just averages, you can’t really take anything from this video, at all
Well, damn, I'm 24 so I guess it's all downhill now.
Highest satisfaction at 23? That was the lowest point of my life.
Age is just a number or you can  ask my mom, who against all odds , came to this country, learn a new language at 44, met the man of her dreams at 46, got an incredible job offer at 66, at 77 yrs old my mom is still going strong!!\nstill works her full time job ( by choice), and has More aspirations than ever.\nabove all she is very grateful woman for what she  has done for  her life  and ours .\nage is just a number.
lmao the happiest is 23 years old, usually when people graduate college
I thought at the end it was going to say No matter how old you are...we are all going to die
Jesus goddamn Christ! Can I go one day without worrying about my future?!
No matter how old you are... remember, that one day, you WILL die.  Have a nice life :)
Well this brought my self esteem down
What if I say, I don't believe this crap ....
Quality of life is highest at 23? I feel like there are so many social determinants and lifestyle dependency factors...
You Are Great - Motivation \nhttps://youtu.be/4R90ek4V7d8
This is fake I enjoyed life the most when I was 24
 I'm Proven this video Very Wrong !     🔮
23 is typically when most people are out of college with no job.  That doesn't sound like a satisfying life.
Going back to college at 50 I guess
Sum up from 25 - 35: Best at building muscles and strongest mindset for achievements.
Bunch Of Nonsense
Nothing
This is BS
Brain activity fastest at 18. Well fuck 😂
wtf is this based on ? buzzfeed polls ?
All BS
That shit’s bullshit
0:42 BOII!!
Horrible
23 most happiest lmfao
Nothing
bullshit
So after 30 eat shit
All downhill from 25
Sources?
wtf was taht
42
FALSE.
lockheed martin
Not true
FUCK MY LIFE
Peak procrastination age - 15 to 20
Notice there is no women most attracted to men, only men most attracted to women age.
Nice music
Anout to be 25 💪💪💪💪
Yup, we can all look forward to death!
This video is complete bullshit.
Oh yeah?....., well whats the age you get a shitty roll of the dice and get cancer and die well before most people?.... \n\nFuck off!
I'm 19, time to see how shitty the rest off my life will be :)
so they looked at a bunch of statistics, calculated averages and then proceeded to make a shitty, useless video. bravo.
TIL that the average person, doesn't know what an average means...
When are men most attractive to women? Da fuk.
Get this trash off trending!!!!

Oooohh so Kawaii!!!! I was wondering if you can make a cake (or anything) relating to the new My Little pony: movie. It'll be so cool if you can do like a pirate ship cake with Rainbow Dash's RAINBOOM!!
What’s the name of the song?😜🤔
Tip: if you change the background music it won't be that distracting \nLove you
I imagine this conversation at my birthday part\nMe: Hi guys! Guess what we are going eat.\nPerson: cake? \nMe: guess again.\nPerson: more cake? \nMe: nope. \nPerson: I am out of guesses \nMe: WE ARE GOING TO EAT PUSHEEN!!!\nPerson: but I am a vegetarian .-. I am crying inside

I shouldn't have gotten up today.
This is genius. I'm surprised I never thought of how good of a comparison this is. D.Va's my favorite overwatch hero and I love the Umaru-chan anime. Great video
Not a fan of Overwatch.\n\nHuge fan of Himouto Umaru-Chan.\n\nHave my thumbs up.
That is SO CUTE! GG <3
Props to you. This is amazingly well done.
1:05 Mash those macros!

I love it but the Doritos bag at 0:57 bothers me, lmao
This is the best thing I've ever seen thank you so much for making it!!!!!

The best part is that Solider76 is Oni-chan. that alone got me SOLD!
Someone please give this man a medal

1 year spent well, ps if you didn't know this being put on Crunchyroll roll news, that's how I got here 👍
Holy shit. I almost feel like watching this anime just from this video
This is what actual perfection is. <3
this is awesome, really well done.
For some reason the lucio at 0:16 has me dying LOL
Carbot Zerglings <3
If pure perfection ever existed, this would be it
380 subs ?? man life is unfair ;__; i really love your work keep it up <3
So good, i love it
Now take a look on real girls, then cry a lot.
How did I end up here lol. Totally worth it tho.
THIS VIDEO SAVED ME. Great job!!!!! <3
They should hire you! :O
Let me have it.
Good work. Now like my comment, Glayer :3
Nicely done, it's quite cute! =)
Ничего не понимаю,но это ОХУЕННО!!!
Почему если автор считает если показать Dva няшной анимешной дурочкой то это будет  нормально? Этот опенинг же бессмысленный... Это может понравиться только гигнутым фанам ониме, но со взгляда нормального человека это такая срань...
grade A censoring of dor*****

Интро интересное, но тратить целый год на его создание - БОРЩ

0:18 Is that a zergling? :3
Come to the eagles
I still cant believe a guy that smokes weed is being punished more than abusers and animal killers. Vick is on tv as an ANALST! A fucking analyst, that we look at and listen to in hope to gain some perspective. Think about that and look at Josh. I get what he is going through too. I can smoke weed once a month and never need anything else, but it stays in your system so long you get your fix through more harmful ways like alcohol to not get in trouble. With that said and we literally look at people around us, if he is such a drug addict how can he be so healthy? The NFL is wrong for doing this, the suspensions only make situations like this worse fir the individual. His legal problems are fixed faster than his NFL problems. Unless there is a performance enhancement issue/violence then the NFL should stay out of it and support it's own assests. ☝
Now all he needs is to get out of Cleveland
Him talking about his dad is so sad. He still loves him and hasn't even talked to him for 12 years.
Really proud of the work you have done big guy, can't play ping pong though!!
He’s a beast, the browns need him back and hope he can stay clean. At 26 he has a lot of good football left In him
Why do we have to listen to Steven A Smith coon ass before his interview? Did he intentionally want us to listen to the naysayers are what? Steven coon ass don’t have the right to be done with nobody but his own children if he have any?
And the Browns decided to draft that enabler piece of shit Manziel, who fed Josh more drugs. \n\nFucking dumbest franchise in all of sports.
arguably the most talented receiver I've seen not named randy moss
When life situations transcend sport and the game its related to ,... It reveals the most beautiful aspect of sports in general. Specifically in this all too common story of addiction. When a man is stripped of everything he loves and forced to confront his demons head on, its a defining moment that will break or rebuild his life, not just in his sport but his life as a whole. Josh Gordon speaks eloquently and direct about his experience so well thats it gives me hope that he can come back. I cheer for guys who can lose it all and fight their way back. Its a test of the human condition. Now that's a player and athlete i can root for.  -Eagles fan-
This man is a freak on the field. Hope he gets the chance to come back.
Let’s go falcons pick this man up just makes us that much better
Inspiring! Way to be a complete man, Josh. Time for you to put up over 200 back to back yards on your demons. You got this!
NFL time to give him another chance! Good luck JG
He must be broke now
This guy hasn't learned anything.  He doesn't need to be worried about football, he needs to be worried about his life and about his daughter that he has never met.  I guarantee that if he gets back on the football field and suffers a career ending injury, he will OD soon after if he doesn't get his head right.  Football is a privilege, not a right.
Countdown waiting on you big dog stay on the path
Big Fan of Gordon!  Even more now listening to him and can see he trying whatever it take to change and step up to be a father. Hope Cleveland want to trade him. Jerry Jone need to watch this and trade a 1st round draft for him.   Best of luck to you J Gordon.
Hes from texas , of course he sippin lean 😂
The Bills need a receiver badly right now.  Hope he gets reinstated and they take a look at signing him.
I’m rooting for you Flash! Keep working, get your life together and get back in the league!
Very powerful. A lot of these guys will lose their job and give up and give into the temptation that led them to lose everything in the first place. It’s good to see people make change from their past and give their all to right their wrongs. I hope I’ll see JG on the field soon.
Come back to Cleveland young man .
I have faith he'll stay clean. And once hes out, come to phi, the Eagles need you haha
What kind of camera does uninterrupted use ? Anyone know
This was awesome..See ya soon Flash..✌🏾
wish him the best i pray the brotha turns it around and heals himself football or not
Eli Manning needs you, the NY Giants need you #MakeItHappen 🙌🏾🏈
It's crazy this made me really think and a lot of his issues weren't drugs, it was him handling the stresses of life. Grant it he didn't have a great start with drugs but if you listen closely you'll see. my college coaches taught me how to drink detox everyone thought i was a junkie, so i said eff it. It seems that was obviously his coping mechanism but no one helped this man, not even himself. To change you really gotta tear down the whole thing so you can rebuild. Everyone was giving him a quick fix, even himself. He looks great now and ability wise he's been a top tier talent. Hopefully he gets reinstated
I failed this drug test because I was getting high... Thats a very mature answer, I like that.
BECAUSE HE CAN'T STAY OFF THE WEEEDUH???
As a fan you never truly realize what someone is going thru...prayers up for JG 🙏🏻
Fuck the NFL. Go to Canada. It's bullshit!! All this fucking trying to humble a player is bullshit!!! Fuck that!!! They play football!! They do not make laws, they don't do shit but play football. I am sick of Americans and their fucking contradictions. Expect more from a person who does nothing to impact my life than a person who can impact my life. I do not expect anything from athletes. I expect my President to not be a separator, congress to not be full of old white people, jobs paying people every two weeks or once a month. I mean real things. I wonder what did Kerry Collins have to do. What about Riley Cooper. Hmmm, yup, full of shit!
Man he looks lost. He needs God like us all
Alright so he said 110 days of rehab and the last snap chat he said he was at day 99. That was 16 days ago. Shouldnt he be out of rehab by now and submitting papers of reinstatement?
He is obviously a smart dude with some internal issues. He has done no worse than most of the white kids I went to college with. They received a second chance though due to their privilege.
no, I failed the drug test because I was getting high taking responsibility for his actions, admirable. Keep it pushing Josh
You can see the effects of drug in his face.  Him using his natural supports like talking to his boy on the phone is real important. Glad to see that.
Best of luck Josh. Would like to see you back on the Browns, but more importantly would love you see you live a happy and healthy life and be an inspiration to others!
Give this guy a chance fuck wasting his potential
7:27  Anyone know who that is on the back of Gordon's hoodie?
Going through same things dui in 2014 and still going but this helps me maintain
Never give up! Great video ❤
Somebody has to say it! - How long until he is traded to NE? ....
Hope my Bengals call and give you a chance
Great job Josh! Awesome to see a positive story in today's world! Keep up what you're doing bro! My BEARS could DEFINITELY use you haha..
mannnnnn, i'll take him in New England in a heartbeat
they need to make a full documentary series of this guy
damn son, this more than weed
Still love you bro! Miner set back for a major come back
Wait so the schools help athletes violate ncaa policy? But I thought it was all about amateurism and education?
Carolina go get this guy🙏\n\n#Another chance\n#KeepPounding
ill believe it when I see it
So basically this is letting everyone know he’s going to the patriots next year
I failed the drug test because I was getting high. man this makes me change my opinion about him. hope he gets on the field soon. God knows the Browns need him
Good to see him working on him self ..
Bro holla at the giants we definitely need some help
Idk why but I get a Jon Jones vibe from this. I hope Josh leaves this behind and gets back to the league.
I'm praying for this young man to succeed. It should start with being a good person first.
I pray the Chicago bears get him 🐻
I believe in you bro, always have always will. You still have the chance to be the greatest ever. #JoshGordon
All the best to him, he seems like he's really taken some huge steps forward. I really hope it all works out for him, from people I know in my life this is incredibly tough to deal with.
His drug use never effected his performance from what I seen not encouraging it when your making millions of dollars but I am not worried about him not being the same at all he got help\nAt the right time never showed he was washed now all he has to do is stay clean.
Give him a couple million and he would f up again
I hope he can make it back in the league!
I've have never seen a joint worth a million dollars
I believe in you J.G.\nI sincerely hope you can become a father. Be blessed.
Can he play football next year?
He would’ve been on Julio, Odell, and Antonio’s level
Weed should just be cool with NFL. Since 90% of them have brain damage retiring
*i want my Bears to somehow get him* 🐻
Stay strong my brother we all make mistakes keep the grind up don't look back
Lamar high school proud 💯
Man he went around the streets, knocking on people’s door, asking random people where he could find weed. All he had to do was knock on my door. I would have directed him to Johnny Manziel’s Twitter page.
6:39 Tyrone Biggums sighting
Hope he can redeem himself. Fantastic talent.
Fuck skip bayless
Good luck Josh...
Go to dallas
Amazing
Rooting for u josh keep pushing Brody!
Rooting for him
VLONE THUG
You got this Josh, you got this!! #onedayatatime
Giants watching like........👀
Such a talent.
“STAY OFFFFF THE WEEEEEEEEEEEEEDD”
Stay OFFFF The WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDUUUHH
Raiders need him

Prove em wrong!
ayeee shout out to Turbo Taylor
Josh imma need the name of these detox drinks
Am I the only one who was sweating the guy might fail a drug test before I even finished the video?? Thats all nice talk, but dude only wants reinstated to make money. Hes never seen his baby but wants to be a father? I grew up with countless guys like him, buddies who would talk about getting their lives together but never would. Always excuses. He will never stay clean for long. It takes a certain kind of personalty to conquer substance abuse. He dont got it.
There is no detox drink that works as he described. Too bad this perennial failure has to try and attribute his mistakes to other people. I see no growth.
From a long time browns fan i truly believe Josh Gordon had all the god given talent to be a hall of fame wide receiver and in 2013 he had 1600+ receiving 9 td's and went to the pro bowl, this has to be the most talented person I have ever seen literally throw it away, in the future I wish him the best but I think he will regret the decisions he made later in life.
He had multiple chances but keep fucking up
Iv done all these drugs that he said he's done multiple times before and never got addicted , he doesn't have a problem he's just immature
He is an idiot. He has had so many chances already.
hope he gets a 2nd chance in the league.
cant wait for the EXPLORATION YESS YESSS YESSSS !!!!! Finaly
Did I hear that right? Did they say that all of the content mentioned from the 2018 roadmap was going to be _free for all Horizons players?_
I remember a time when software companies would release a game, then not support it, then release a new system so that you would have to re-buy the game, AND the system.  We have it pretty damn good as Elite Dangerous gamers!  THANK YOU Frontier.
Please no more rank grinding
I don’t care what everyone else says, I am looking forward to this and am VERY happy with the announcements.
Space loach bobble head?
good to see them crack down on the core of the game finally, wish it happened sooner but hey.. better late than never. Also really excited to see this new generation of ship design we will be seeing!
Love the road map & where we are all heading CMDRS! Keep up the sterling work Frontier.
The main problem FD have here is the impatience of the general public. Give 'em a rest guys.
I'm really happy with what I saw. I wonder if any of my old wingmen are still flying.
So if I find a thargoid base the location will be saved at the codex?
So THAT'S how they made the thargoid noise....never would have guessed!
So, Thargoids = shitty space flowers? I'm really disappointed. This devs have zero imagination.
All promising content reveals. My hope for ED is that it continues to grow & is supported through the next couple generations. The foundation/the palate to paint-upon, is there. But like the 1st explorers of our galaxy, we must find a patience within us that keeps our desire for it all, at bay, as to not cloud what already is there.\n\nIf you can find that place, you'll enjoy ED for what it is currently, while having realistic dreams about what is to come. \n\nWhich looks like an Alliance fleet & more dynamic planets (Yay!).\n\nQuality of life improvements on the core gameplay, especially to and from distant destinations, will help immensely. Like Galnet Audio.\n\nSimply listening to an engaging story about the Guardians, Thargoids or the Human race would be quite enjoyable while frame shifting through the black. We've all experienced reading something hud-related, only to be interdicted or miss a signal. I think the audio concept will eliminate that possibility while simultaneously keeping the player engaged. Not to dissimilar from driving today-Keep the eyes on the (neutron) highway while filling the ears with information.\n\nAlthough not mentioned, any HUD customization options Frontier could make available to consoles, would be greatly appreciated. I enjoy the orange aesthetic! But once saw a PC commander with bronze colored shield rings...and it looked SO right. Just a thought/suggestion.\n\nThank you for creating Elite dangerous and continuing to support it. It truly is a journey.\n\nSincerely and Respectfully, \nCommander Voltron IV (xbox)
Sorry, expand what narrative? Maybe I missed it in my many hours of playing the game. I have yet to see any in game narrative. The player is dropped into the middle of nowhere with no direction given and if you never search the net you would have no clue as to what is going on in the game. So I ask again, what narrative are you planning on expanding?
Thats gOOD! space legs can w8!
I'm a bit concerned about what they classify as 'Narrative'..😒 Narrative is not a new gun or gadget for your ship, and 'narrative' is NOT seeing blocks coming out of the ground or dropping cargo and watching a ship change colour when it takes it on board. They reeally need to look up and re evaluate what theybare calling narrative here.. Lets face it, if any of the things i mentioned was the story in a game or movie, it would be absolutely ripped apart for its so called narrative. What they're calling a narrative here, makes the story in the first Destiny game look like Tolstoy in comparison lol
2018 sounds like it is going to be more interesting than 2017!  Looking forward to it.
Another year and you still can not get out of your ship and walk around.
GalNet pictogram (star) is like as Thargoid interceptor :)\nAnd in general this star has 8 rays, but in animation only 7 rays.\nWhy?
and the enginieer RNG still remain... what a joke !
Does all look very nice and shiny, just a shame we have to wait a year for it all.
I really like the game and bought horizons today. What i really don't like is the fact that i have to pay for a simple jacket for my hologram and ship skins after i did pay €65  (77$) total for the game. I could understand that if it's a free game to play but this is just greedy.  Even the deluxe edition give some free skins and i did pay more cause i already bought the Mercenary Edition. Pay some respect to your customers and give them some skins and goodies for free.
Let the Python carry a single fighter.
This was done really well and very professionally... Wow. It's almost like a talk show.
Haha this skinhead guy is so genuine sweet as he laughs and smiles all the way throu :D I love it!
WTF ever happened to the idea of being able to land on planets with atmosphere?  That went out the window 2 years ago it seems.
At this rate, SC is going to have some serious competition.
A question on the future squadrons and fleet cariers.if squadrons are group based and and fleet cariers bought by groups . how will they resolve the problem of groups that have pc/mac, x-box, playstation members as they dont show up in in friendlists or private groups.
Do we know what size the Chieftain will be? I've already got two endgame ships, I feel like the game needs more super high lever stuff.
I'm no scientist, but doesn't fog and vapour require atmosphere? We are landing on barren rocks....where's the fog and vapour from?
Nothing new here then.. No landing on planets with atmosphere. No real market between players, just two critical things which come to mind.  \n\nI think the lead designer is a classic example of talking the talk by the way he looks but there is no walk the walk.  \n\nThe game was effectively dead when they decided to implement it via p2p instead of the way every other mmo type game does imho, I said it at the time, got shouted down by fanboys as I will now no doubt but hey its your money,, keep buying them bobbleheads..\n\n:)
I'm enjoying reading all the comments and can't believe how awesome the game is coming along.  My personal push and shove to actually play the game is that we finally have 'THE THARGOIDS.'  I searched black and blue in the original Elite.  Now if only I didn't feel so retarded trying to actually play this new Elite I'd probably play it more.  So far I've installed it, got scared off by the tutorial and my brother couldn't believe how incredibly bad I was at it.  Which is a real shame as I'd love to be able to play it and join in.  Was happy to back it at a high level on Kickstarter and I'm glad that many fellow space gamers are enjoying the result. Great presentation and I think it's fantastic that Elite is being updated and enhanced without destroying the things that make it great in the process.  Essentially you can take all this great new stuff in or leave it and continue playing the game the way you like to play it.  ROCK ON COMMANDERS!!!!! It looks like Elite Dangerous is not going to go the path of EVE Online which is a great aspect indeed.
They should merge The Sims with Elite Dangerous. Having crew members, associates, competitors and enemies that procedurally generate personal narratives. Something that isn't spelled out but rather interpreted by the player.\nI hate the galactic simulation and the voting by grinding on these narratives as they call them.
Would love to see the the amount of NPC encounters in the game increased - too often you find yourself scouring the galaxy for a good amount of combat opportunities / waiting around in mining sites for a 'Wanted' enemy to appear - i want to see squadrons of 20 pirate ships from same faction appear on your scanner gunning for loot.
tbh, i only want 2 things from ed atm; i want at least another 10 yr on the jump range of my python, and the ability to equip at least one fighter. of course, that would shift the python from, arguably the best ship in the game, to, undisputedly the best ship in the game.
Who knew all this time that a thargoid sound was made from a bass clarinet
I think I would have been happier if Elite was only now being launched.  Having bought the game and the Horizons pass Elite is only now beginning to be a full game worth the money. Hopefully it can attract  some of the players that gave up long ago to give it another try.
Ah thanks 3303 but I've already died in my vulture a couple of times, I'm gonna take a break.
Get rid of the dam warping mini game what a huge waste if time!!!
I wonder if the planets I have already explored will appear in the codex. Also loving all the content. I think i'll drop a few £ in some cosmetics to make it clear. The way I see it my expansion pass is pretty much payed in full already.
Amazing narrative? You mean the bland blocks of text you call Galnet, amrite?
I waited over 20 years to play Frontier again!  Teenage years spent playing Frontier Elite 2 in UK it was a great game.  The one reason I bought a PS4 Pro was to play Frontier Elite Dangerous (the wife was not keen on a crazy priced laptop for one game!).  Now a 36 year old in New Zealand and still loving the atmosphere the game produces.  I sneak in about 4-5 hours play a week = not much but it's time well spent!  Thank you Frontier for a quality product.
I'll believe it when I see it... late next year....
I'd like to see additional surface vehicles, and outfitting for them as well.
A Ship launched miner would be awesome with multicrew !
The amount of RNG in engineer mods in the game right now. If those personal narrative guns are as unique as told, then they worry me a lot....
I would love to see my crew onboard my vessel. Perhaps sitting on the bridge, or using npc spacelegs walking about.
They are improving a bunch of core game mechanics such as better multiplayer interaction, improved exploration(I'm hoping this means they are adding more variety to procedurally generated nebulae and maybe even improving known nebulae) improved planetary exploration, better engineering, the type 10(what do you expect it to look like? Obviously it's gonna look like the type 9 it's a part of that series). They have gave you a reason to grind rank for the alliance, and obviously some bug fixes. So now they can work on either atmospheric planets or space legs. Or is there gonna be a problem that is just you and not the game? (Don't say I'm saying the game is perfect)
exploration carriers that can scan several light-years and give the probability of life in the systems it scans?
It's great to see continued support for this game,  great work guys.  Ps4 player
why are these expos always so cringe? why are they always so nervous? everyone is there for the same reason so relax and have some fun, especially the audience! The host had to work so hard to keep it intact... if your at the expo then maybe you should all be jumping out of your seats and be excited, it would put the developers at ease more and its a lot less awkward to keep telling the audience to settle with humor than having to encourage them to clap??? what is wrong with this world these days??? Why is everyone wound up so damn TIGHT? chill out, laugh, relax, its a game, not a un summit haha
Why is it taking so long to overlay a simple optional wireframe grid on a planet surface, to help with navigation when it's dark (or for bad weather)? Even films as old as 'Alien' managed to portray that!
Thanks for that FD!
Any mention of 4k option for the PS4 PRO and at least support for the PS4's camera for head tracking.
Cmon,i just need to know where the Monolith is and how can i see the You Win Screen at the End of the Grind(Game).
I'm only watching this because I like Sandy!
I really hope that the trade changes don't just come with stuff to make it easier, but also balance it out to make it more challenging with markets that respond to player action. So like, when some one or a group discovers something lucrative, there's a limited amount of farming they can do on that market before profits drop, so that a good trader will constantly be on the move looking for the best profits
So...\nWhat about space legs.\nWhen are we going to see them or you know...\nBE ABLE TO WALK AROUND ON DOES FUCKING EXPENSIVE SHIPS THAT WE GRIND LIKE A MOTHERFUCKERS FOR. \nI'm just asking out of curiosity for a friend.
PvP fleet battles would be a fun addition
Lots of cool stuff the part that im most exited about is the update to the planets and the ships computer Reading the news.
бла бла бла .. где бл... ноги ?  ноги где ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool. Galnet audio (no sarcasm).
No Panther Clipper?
Spess pinecones.
ALLIANCE SHIPS NICE!
YEAAA BOOiiiiii~~~~  *cringe*
I've got one thing to say to the Devs, grinding is not game play.
Just give us atmospheric planets that we can land on and I’ll be happy... thanks bye
Branching mission tasks someday with decision nodes ?
Elite: Dangerous = heavily slept on game
CLAP CLAP
Sandro likes trex jokes???
MAKE POWERPLAY FUN (AGAIN, NOT)
SPLENDID! <3
👌😊
Okay no space legs.... but hot damn I bloody like what I saw and heard here... good job Frontier 👏👏👏👍👍👍
I got the feeling that ED's roadmap presentation is like watching a Microsoft keynote.
Personal narrative = massive grind
Chieftain requirements-aquire rank legend in alliance navy. mission grind incoming!
What is that thing on his shoulder?
Very excited for Elite in 2018! Thanks FDev!
I really hope the exploration update improves jumping.  It's the exact same particle effect with the exact same sound, which you get to watch a hundred times during a gameplay session.  It needs something to spice it up, or it should take 1/4th the time.  I understand it's doing the Stellar Forge thing as well as finding sessions, but systems can be optimized.
Hopefully the Mamba, Moray and Boa find their way to ED too.
I can picture the q4 release already. It won´t come in q4 2018, but hey... they didn´t explicitly say that it´s not going to arrive in 2018... so... they are still on time... I really enjoyed how the game started. Especially the amount of insight FDev gave us into the dev-process. but now, their newsletters are basically galnet, new cosmetics and a picture of a child touching a hotas. I miss when they actually seemed to do something :-(
In other words, no need to come back to ED before Beyond update.
Just popped back on after half a year away from the game. Took a passenger tourist mission worth 2.5mil for a few hundred ly. The last visitor beacon was 250kls from the main star, so I pulled up the Steam browser and Googled Elitge Dangerous Sucks while I waited. \n\nThis game just isn't for me. Too little challenge spread across too much time. It doesn't really sound like that's about to change.
I would like Galnet Radio to have funny fake ads like GTA radio stations
Please guys in 2018 we need be able to...walk everywhere! PLEASE!
Hum... maybe this new lighting of theirs will allow the Mac version to have planetary landings?\nThe main thing holding back a Mac version of Horizons was, if I'm not mistaken, a shader incompatibility in the Mac's OpenGl library, correct?
everyones excited everyones passionate .. but none of them actually play the game ...
I feel like Q4 2018 will be the day ED meets a lot of the expectations people had when it launched. Can't wait!
Coming Soon.... The  Narrative Expansion
They could of saved this for next year ..we waited to hear stuff for next year smdh I couldn't believe when they said it and the end of it at that..wow I'm so happy..not just like why talk about or bring up t10 if it's not until next year and who really going to fly it..I hate the 9 slow azz
If those new Thargoids aren't called 'Angels' then there is no justice in the universe.
Maybe the team needs to take the quarter off and actually play their game .. On second thought one week off should suffice.
4 dots on a screen don't equal a roadmap. Welcome to season 3, Elite: Dangerous Maintenance Mode
If I hear narrative once more, Ill kill him.
again BLA-BLA-BLA(( Where CONTENT???
Too little, too late. Star Citizen's still in alpha and has more to offer in v3.0 than the glorified puddle of a game you've put together.
Hello, my name is Jinny Anna. I am 14 years old and I want to ask everyone a question. How can a young ugly girl become a youtuber? 😭
Love this Georgia! Would love a style/ look book style video! Or history or your style, fashion tips x
Really good video and enjoyed watching it

So are we getting more pokemon vids?
This movie failing at the box office may be a great thing. Now there won't be a cinematic universe and unnecessary sequels
I know it’s really broad to say, but for me, this might be the greatest film of the decade
Kinda weird not hearing that split second earrape intro like with the rest of your videos
Just saw it myself and really enjoyed it. \nHowever, without spoiling anything, there was a scene that took me by surprise because it suddenly reminded me of a scene from the movie Ghost and I had to stifle a chuckle in the theater.
Apparently he's interested in making his own version of Dune\n*Claps then shoots arms up in excitement*
It avoided all of the traps of your usual sequel cash-grab.
It's is incredibly relieving to me that you enjoyed this film.  I felt the same way as you after my second viewing.
I need that Denis Dune movie in my life.
Fake Reviews are propping this disaster up\n \nThis movie was just awful in so many ways. I had a very hard time\nstaying awake and an even harder time making sense out the extremely\nslow story line unfolding. I kept thinking the entire time I was\nwatching it that they were just filling time with empty, meaningless\nscenes. In the end I was convinced that the entire story could have\nbeen told in about thirty minutes, with some decent action, and it\nwould have been a lot better. \n\nThe main way to describe this movie is that, to be kind, the story line\ntook a backseat to meaningless but beautiful HD cinematography. The\nstory was difficult to follow and had an all over the place and\nmeaningless feeling to it. No one in the theater said a word when it\nwas over. They all just got up and walked out looking bored out of\ntheir minds. \n\nCharacter development was next to non existent with the exception of a\nfew scenes that pretended to develop the main character. \n\nSince I had to give it one star to rate it, I will say that star was\nfor the actors, who in my opinion did as good a job as possible with\nthe horrible, painstakingly slow script they were give. \n\nMy last complaint is that I have been duped into going and seeing a few\nmovies because the IMDb rating was initially very high, only to end up\nwasting my time and money. I am convinced that the good reviews are\nfake and most likely paid for. It is IMPOSSIBLE for people to be rating\nthis garbage a 9 or 10. Perhaps someone who is deaf and just loves\nlooking at HD scenery in movies would have loved it. Other than that it\nwould take a seriously unique kind of person to think this movie was\ndecent, much less good.
Will you please please please do a review on 'American Satan' when it comes out. I'm positive it's gunna suck but I'd like to hear your thoughts on it and if it's worth my time.
I'm so glad you loved this movie as much as I did, it's definitely my favourite movie of 2017
Looks like people voted to have more Jurassic worlds and Transformers. ☹
Do i have to watch all the 2048 blade runner movies?
Story was fucking awful. Littered with conveniences. Forgets a lot of the elements it brings up and doesn't do anything with it's themes. The ties to the original were pointless.
I kinda hated it honestly. I felt bored during the movie.
I've seen this movie 2 times already and I will be seeing it again can't get it out of my head.
It's such a shame that a visionary film like this under performs at the box office, while bullshit movies like the Transformers sequels still rake in enough cash to keep being made. WTF!?
I loved the movie. The art and cinematography is amazing. But I do believe it's a bit stretched out. Lots of just waiting around, a bit too long to concentrate on (maybe because I saw it at 10pm and was tired.)
If this guy pulls off a successful DOOM movie I think my faith in this medium will be restored.
Harrison Ford was perfect in episode seven. For what it was supposed to be. It wasn't eh, it was Han. It's probably one of the reasons Ford really doesn't like that character, because he has to act somewhat cheesy and at times kind of stupid. His performance in Crystal Skull was eh.
From an audio/visual perspective this movie is the apex of what film has done so far.
ADAM IM UPSET BLADE RUNNER ISNT DOING GOOD AT THE BOX OFFICE IM GOING TO WATCH IT 3 MORE TIMES
I recently watched Arrival for the first time and I can say with absolute certainty that Denis Villeneuve is the best new filmmaker working today. I didn't think I'd be saying that but after watching Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario and now, Arrival, there's no doubt in my mind. Arrival was smart, emotional and spellbinding and did something that is rare in mainstream movies; It provoked my thoughts. I can't wait to see Blade Runner 2049.
Funny I found the first one much more enjoyable and better paced than the new one. I actually had moments where I had to keep me awake in the cinema because I was nearly falling asleep because it was not only long but so slow paced like every scene. Even now that I am nearly complettly asleep I have trouble turning of the original but just one hour ago I ad real trouble not to fall asleep. Also the characters where much better. Especially this, whats his face? The guy who bought tyrell just sucked and I was happy when he was out of frame. He was okay but damn Tyrell was a genius this is just a Chickenhead of a rich dude.\n\nBut than that is how it is everyone expierence so I see YMS points and I consider them fair.
Maybe the engineers from Prometheus / Alien Covenant are replicants that created the aliens so that replicants could kill off all humans.
I nearly didn't see this on the basis that I didn't like the original Blade Runner, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews I've read/heard from reviewers and publications I trust and close friends swayed my opinion. So glad I did. Sure, there WERE flaws, but they didn't massively detract from the film, and honestly, if it doesn't sweep all the techie awards (Oscars, BAFTAs, etc. etc.), I will slap a bitch.
Do a yms review of screenagers
I've never heard him say 10/10
Lets give this director more money plz!!! Villenueve deserves it. His worlk has been impecable on every single movie he has been directing. Personally one of my favorites this decade.
Thank you Adam, I was going to skip this one because I wasn't convinced Blade Runner needed a sequel or that Hollywood would do it justice but this quickie made me do a 180 on that decision.\nWas not disappointed in the least!
not a 10/10 I'm so fucking triggered reeeeee!
m8! do a review on IT pleez
I really hope Villeneuve and Deakins squeeze in Bond 25 before Dune
Spoilers:\nI think the whole movie is about K finding his humanity. Throughout the movie, he constantly is belittled by everyone for being a replicant, he’s not real to anyone, not even to himself. But deep down, he knows there's something more, but because of his job and the world he lives in, he won't accept it. That’s why his girlfriend isn’t real either, he doesn't think he deserves a real one, and he See's himself in her. But as the story continues, and he begins to figure out that he may actually be this prophecy child, he begins to realize that maybe he is real. He starts breaking down, realizing that this whole time he was right, that what his girlfriend told him was right, that he is special. Because of this he begins acting human, he goes against what he's told, he lies, as he believes he really is real, that he has a soul. But after its revealed to him that he isn't this child, he loses hope. They tell him to kill deckard, and begins to act as he did at the beginning of the film, just following orders. But before he does, he See's his girlfriend advertising hologram, and then realizes something. He realizes this whole time, she was just as unreal as he was. But he loved her just the same. So it hits him, if I can believe she is real, why can't I believe I am real? He realizes that this whole time, he always had a soul, that everything he did while he thought he was this child the way he acted, that was just him. The memory of the horse was like placebo for him. You even hear the voice over say dying for a cause is the most human thing a person can do  which is exactly what he did. But this not only alludes to him, but to Joi too. She risked her life to help him, and died because of it. In this scene, he realizes that she was real. Him realizing she is real, is his miracle (like sapper said) that gives him a reason to believe he too is real. He then uses this freedom to go against what he is told, freeing deckard, reuniting him with his daughter, and then dying peacefully just like Roy. As he has now proven to himself. That he was always real. As he lets the snow land on him, just like the rain did on Joi when she discovered she was real. He is real. He is free.
huh. i watched this expecting you to rip it a new asshole not suck it off. I guess i need to see it.
I thought it was boring. Although I enjoyed when he choked that bitch out.
dune aside, I heard daniel craig absolutely wants villeneuve to direct his final 007 next year...
2049 is not a movie, seeing it in a theater is one of those experiences you describe to your grandchildren years later.
When i saw that you'd reviewed BR49 i was excited and a little worried because your reviews are usually spot on and you don't suffer fools gladly so i was pleasantly surprised with your very positive review. \nI watched BR as a 20yo and it really was my favourite movie for many years (not so much these days). It's so nice to see that the torch has been passed.
this movie costed $150m let's hope it'll surpass it's budget.
I knew I wanted to see this movie, but I so rarely see movies (just due to scheduling). This review was the kick in the ass I needed and holy shit, I loved it. Possibly one of my favorite movies of the past few years. Excellent.
Well I guess we gotta give Ridley Scott credit...
I completely agree. I loved this movie and do think it is an improvement over the original. I felt transported to another universe for 3 hours, and the story was decadent filled with characters that are well acted and that the audience grows to actually care about.
I love the theme of loneliness in the movie.
Oscar MUST consider this film during awards season. Reframed in that context I think it will finally attract the audience it was always meant to (i.e. people looking for long form art, not a blockbuster action film).
Oh my god, a movie that Chris Stuckmann and YMS agree on? Amazing. The only, ONLY reviewer or whatever that didn't like this movie was Cr1tikal and his opinion just comes from his lack of understanding of what Blade Runner is. His friend didn't even like the shining. Everyone else is in love. If even YMS is in love, then this really is one of the best sequels of all time. Alongside Aliens.
I saw this video the day it came out, watched the first five seconds, heard I thought it was phenominal and immediately closed the video to go watch the film. After finally getting a chance, I came back, watched the vid, and found myself in agreeance.  A lot of the things you said were things I happened to notice while watching the movie. You and other film critic channels (such as Ralphthemoviemaker) have really helped me learn about how cinematography works, and how to view films with a critical eye rather than that of the average movie goer. In many ways this has enhanced my experience watching films and I appreciate the lessons you've taught on the value of good film making.
I just saw this movie today. The theater was mostly empty unfortunately, but it's so good I decided I'm gonna have to see it at least two more times. I want more movies like this, please.
wtf, this review was the most positive review ive ever heard from Adam. So much so that I thought he had to be kidding. I'll definitely check this movie out
Oh fuck I didn't know the person who directed Arrival.\nI'll watch this.
Instead of doing DOOM maybe the director who's name I will not butcher can explore a possible live action Cowboy Bebop?? =D
Too bad it couldn't captivate audiences enough to see it... like the original couldn't...
9? Wow, the movie rubbed me in the wrong way for some reason, I would not give it more than a 6 or 7. Maybe an 8. I also watched the first Bladerunner a day before, and it left a better impression on me than the new one. The new one has some similar visual elements, but in my mind the new movie has a different tone than the first one. The first one from what I got out of it was about the struggle of a lower class. I feel that the new one has some themes that are better illustrated in Children of Men, and Moon, with regards to a rare birth and memory implants. The first movie was much more subtle, and better developed than the new one in my opinion. I wouldn't say that the new one sucks, but rather it is a sort of fancy average.
Could you please do a more in depth review of this movie. Would love to hear your opinions on the plot, wich was my biggest gripe with the film. I may just be stupid, but some things were quite confusing to me.
The one sequel, the ONE good sequel, and it tanks harder than the Cleveland Browns. Yippee.
If u like a movie just dont make a vid bout it
Someone who actually gives Leto his due how about that.
m gonna have to completely disagree with you about the pacing.  It felt like 7 hrs for me.
I hope Denis gets Dune green lit.
I thought it was pretty good, bit slow and the rebellion plot was a bit unnecessary though
visually one the best movies iv ever seen, highly recommend seeing this in cinemas the sound made me feel like I was in a trance
I saw this movie and fell in love with it. I saw that you were reviewing it and my heart sank into my stomach. I respect and am heavy influenced by your reviews, but I was thinking “Please, Adam, go easy on this movie”. I am very happy you enjoyed it too.
K I N O
So amazing, denis is one of the best directors around, best fx ever with great music/acting/storytelling  10/10
Very Good film and a classic in 20 years from now , just a lot more times watching . Original at the moment still the best film ever made though .
You sure know how to sell a movie lol. Definitely going to see this now.
YES!!!!!!!! I SAW THIS AND WAS SCARED YOU MIGHT RIP IT TO SHREDS BUT YOU DIDNT!!!
Well I was on the fence and Adum once again pushed me off and said IT'S GOOD and I went oh ok
You kinda sound like riley dennis
Blade Runner is a great film, as is the sequel, which is an extremely rare thing...   but alas, I'm heartbroken. It seems that the general public HAS voted with their wallets and Blade Runner 2049 is not the film they want. They don't want excellent pacing, cinematography, directing, acting, etc. Most want their Fast & Furious and Transformer schlock. If there is one thing I want to see happen (which probably won't) is that even if it's not the financial success we'd hoped it would be, I pray The Academy gets one thing right, and that's for 2049 to sweep all it's categories...          well, if it's even nominated, that is.
Every time Ryan Gosling's wife rang, the Peter and the Wolf ringtone made me immediately paint a mental image of Kenny initiating a plan to beat Spenny at a competition.
You sound like Force Gaming
Just came here for the first 4 seconds. Will come back when i actually watched it.
so this is what happens when a director who wants to say something gets an opportunity in 2017. I hope that people will support this with their $. denis villeneuve will never be unemployed anyways, but let's show that we, as general audience still have a good taste.
Am I the only one that found Luv and mister Wallace very boring? Luv felt kinda edgy with her oneliners and Wallace was just spouting some biblical mythology to sound deep. That's what I got out of it at least. Ryan gosling carried the movie for me.
Do a long review please
The original is more pure, it's never dull or slow cause it's telling the story at all times with multiple meanings to every scene, just think, he's continplating if hes a replicant during the entire movie and the reason for the pacing of the movie makes sense. That's how I see it.
This movie isn't making enough money. Looks like it's more Jurassic World for us.
and they finally make the film the nerds wanted and it flops...HARD.
I thought this movie had something from Drive in terms of Gosling's storyline. And something from Her. And something from Ghost in the Shell. And the main villian replicant looked like a fem-version of agent Smith from Matrix
bullshit. director is talentless cockroach, eh.
ngl, didnt like it
Vote with your wallets, people
42nd on trending \n\n\n\n\nGOOD JOB
Wtf is episode 7?
hype hype hype ... beautiful visuals gimmicks already forgotten in 3, 2, 1.
I hate movie goers these days... they get a masterpiece in all cinemas around them and all they care about is a trailer for another shitty ultra remix star wars movie
Adam this comment is kinda gay but I just wanted to say that I love this channel. Your reviews are hilarious and aside from just being funny these videos are pretty in depth and analytical all things considered. I just wanted to say this channel is fucking great and coming from someone who aspires to be a director  I really admire what you do. so keep up the good work and remember cool cat loves you.
... Why is...\nWhat\nMy family and I went and saw it and it was the only time we were all in agreement about a movie.\nWe hated it, I can't find anything I like about it?
This movie was so fucking boring...
I'm sorry, how was every scene necessary? There's legit a whole scene of him sticking his hand in a beehive for 10 mins. He just walks around doing nothing for most of the film.\n\nI actually thought you were being sarcastic at points. This movie was so long and the plot was so thin it should have been an hour long.\n\nThe story was really predictable and kind of disappointing. Compare this to an episode of black mirror and there's no contest. Blade Runner 2049 wasn't thrilling, it wasn't exciting. It was mildly interesting at best.\n\nThe type of movie is also done to death with Ghost In The Shell and every dystopian sci-fi franchise ever being already produced. \n\nIt has no suspense or drama and it had a typical mustache twirling villain that drove the plot of the film. I wouldn't even call it dystopian, the drive of the film had nothing to do with the world. The world wasn't oppressive and the protagonist wasn't fighting against human nature, he was fighting against some big baddy. \n\nI also had no reason to care about the characters. I just found myself thinking, oh so they're dead okay.\n\nAny other sci-fi film has explored the concepts in this film a million times better than this did.\n\nIdk, maybe I should watch it again but idk why people are praising this film so much.
It was bloody awful, dry, slow and anti climatic. I agree the cinematography and visuals with the locations and props was excellent, but everything else was below par.
I'm planning on seeing this in the theater, but i still have a question - would you say Harrison Ford's emphasis in the poster outweighs his emphasis in the film?
A few nitpicks I had with this overall amazing movie. The SONY advertisement crap was very distracting, not to forget about the Coca Cola that's in every Sony pictures as well. \n\nThe Final Boss fight was not very well handled, Trying not to spoil anything, but two dark clad people fighting in the dark, while the camera constantly swifts to a different person, only to return to the fight from the opposite camera angle making it hard to get invested in. Also the final Boss changed character so suddenly in the movie I had a hard time feeling motivated in the villains arc.\n\nThe fight scene between Dekard and K seemed a bit forced, like why not just say why you where there, really? And when the movie decides to kill off a character they made it very clear that, that person was going to die soon.\n\nLast thing is a small thing, but in a visual movie like this I wish they had recorded it on film and not digital, I know Sony would never allow Panavision 70mm in their movies, but the absence of pitch black and only dark grey is a real shame. (Now granted I didn't see it in a IMAX theater, but black was just not there where I saw the movie).\n\nAll in all these are small things, now go watch this movie!
I’m glad I watched your review for this because I grew up watching the original Blade Runner thanks to my dad so I got really excited when the sequel got announced. And hearing that it’s good gives me joy because I really wanted to be a success so thank you for your review
I wanted to watch it again as soon as it was over
Saw it on Friday, awesome movie.
Excuse me but what is it to this particular movie that was not previously explored and shown in Her, Equilibrium, Chlidren of Men and some others? What is so unique in terms of themes, plot points and questions that it asks you? Anyone?
dude, this flick sucked...people walked out.
Your head wrap is hella cute! Give us a Tutoria!!!  Please ☺️
My friend is really pale there's a big difference when she wears spf 30, 50 and 100.
Jackie's little intro song is the only one on youtube I enjoy lol
THANK YOU. my friend never uses sunscreen bc she said she’s black she doesn’t need it and I’m like girllll, it’s not just to prevent sun burn 😭
I have worn sunscreen everyday, non-negotiable since I was 12. The way my hyper pigmentation and acne scars are set up I can't take the chance of going without it. Currently swear by the Elta Md spf 46 which my latest dermatologist highly recommends.
i saw you mention the benefit dream screen sunscreen in a video like a year + i bought it like a week afterward + ive been wearing it ever since! u know that i always listen to aunt jackie lol
Hi Jackie. I’ve been using sunscreen since I was 16 and I’m now 28. You should try Supergoop “Refresh Setting Mist Broad Spectum SPF 50”. I’ve used it for a year now and love it. I use mine mid-day after my morning SPF degrades. It’s great because the sprayer prevents you from having to rub in pollutants and makeup when reapplying SPF AND the magnifying is THE TRUTH!!!!!!
When you said, Did you forget I was Black or I about FELL OUT 😂 You are amazing.
The coverfx packaging is TRASH!!! I’ve returned a few of them to Sephora!!!
the thick formula of sunscreen makes me breakout ;( so I only wear BB/CCcreams with spf
So happy you made this, but is it just me or is the link to the chemical ingredients of sunscreen not in the description box? I really wanna know which to avoid and such.
If you want inexpensive but AWESOME SPF options, order some Korean or Japanese ones from Amazon. A lot are clear/gel formulas so you won't have a white cast.
I never miss a Jackie Video, this is what I watch in the morning when I work out.
Needed this !!!! Thank you xx
Well just snatch my edges why don't you Jackie!!💗you're the best! I so 💘 you!!
I love you jackie😂😂😂 I've been telling my fellow melanin sister's to use sunscreen  for years and I always get the side eye. Look after your skin people coconut oil is not a viable sunscreen🙄
Thank you sooooo much for this video Jackie!!! The only sunscreen I’ve ever used that didn’t cause the chalkboard look is Hawaiian Tropic sheer touch.
Auntie Jackie please review the cats pajama's palette by Laura lee. It seems very suspicious to me that I haven't seen a single negative review on it. She also seems to have only sent the palette to her close friends and really small YouTube accounts that wouldn't dare give it a negative review since they  would probably like to get on other pr lists. Idk it just seems suspicious since the searches don't seem very good and even the looks don't seem that good but the people who have tried rave about it. I need a trustworthy person aka auntie Jackie to review it
I always find myself going back to murad invisiblur but good lordt it is pricey
Woowww let me take my notes while watching this vid. this was so helpful!
Aunty Jackie 😩😩😩why wasn’t this done before the summer started 😩😭sis this could’ve been SOO useful 😭
Please review E.L.F new products. There's so many I'm interested in but afraid to buy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for this video!!! My mom unfortunately passed away from skin cancer and she was always SO careful in the sun. You are absolutely right, cancer doesn't discriminate. I really appreciate the work you put into this! So much love! 😙
I like the missha suncreams since they have high spf levels, don’t break the bank, and are a combination of a physical and chemical suncream
My favorite daily sunscreen + moisturizer is Formula 10.0.6 Picture Perfect Day! It's only SPF 15 but it smells good and feels great! It doesn't make me greasy either.
thanks for this helpful and important video! dark skin people don't need spf is the dumbest skin care myth ever and i still see people perpetuating that ignorance in 2017. just because our skin doesn't turn red & peel off from going outside to check the mailbox (like white ppl) doesn't mean we're immune from UV rays!!
She's a veteran but she's also not trying to break a nail - why I love Jackie 😍😂
This video was a gooodseeend thankyousomuch!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
also do you have lash extensions or are you just that blessed? i'm in love with your lashes ♥
As far as the cast tacha causes. I'm a medium light skin tone. And that type of SPF makes my skin look weird too. So I think that type does that to everyone...  except maybe porcelain skin lol
Tip to all: You might want to take a daily vitamin D supplement if you're wearing sunscreen everyday. It's easy to become deficient in this vitamin if you're minimizing all sun exposure, especially for darker skinned people. Sunscreen is so, so important for everybody though.\n\nThanks for this video Jackie, I need some of that bad and  bougie Murad sunscreen in my life now.
OMG my friends and I used to send each other the Big Miss Steak picture all the time when we were in high school 😭 I miss them aw
Thanks for doing this Jackie!
I loved this video!!!! So so so informative and I really learned a lot.
La roche posay are famous for their sunscreens in Europe. It is a French pharmacy brand. Maybe worth trying out for some drugtore sunscreens?
Jackie Jackie Jackieeeee Living for the outfit Jackie!
guys just bash your head on the keyboard and see what comes up:\n\n\njackiejackieeekaklciiijackiieeejackiieeep[0\nicfhiodfikdddpio
Have you tried the Anessa perfect UV sunscreen aqua booster? It's great at mattefying :)
So do you moisturize, and then use spf or do you skip moisturizer?
I just learned there was a difference the other day in esthetics school. I need physical SPF, or I'll have to visit the ER.
i fucking love you
Wtf I thought the glossier sunscreen was soo much bigger, it looks so tiny irl when u hold it
Loving the new intro 😭
when you're as white as that tatcha sunscreen but is still watching
I get rid of my Hyperpigmentation by using potatoes by 2 weeks my face was so clear of acne scars etc. and it helped with my face texture that I had going on and I know this is some random comment has nothing do with your video lol . P.s I love all your videos Jackie !!!❤️
I love how much I learn from Jackie Aina's channel! She's so smart, funny and makes learning fun!! Now I'm on the market for an SPF
A Chemical sunscreen for normal/dry skin is Aveeno protect and hydrate SPF 50. And it’s only $10. No cast, it’s beautiful 😍
Thank you so much for this video!!!
OMGGGG the Alba Mineral Sunscreen is AMAZING !!! Absorbs in completely 😊
AUNT JACKIE!! I found the Benefit Dream Screen as a mini in a skincare set on Macy's website!
This was really helpful! I was in need of a spf for my face!
I love you for being that Auntie! 💖 You've inspired me to invest in an spf outside of my foundation. I'm a pale little cave-dweller, though, so I rarely see the sun. 😂
You’re hilarious and so positive! Love your videos.
I'm a manager at ulta the most recent benefit cosmetics training they sent us to. They had us try different techniques with the dream screen. Mixing it with porefessional before applying to the face is a dream!!!!! You can also mix it in with their triple moisture cream if the matte sunscreen is too dry for you.
Can you recommend a sunscreen that does not leave your face looking chalky and works for those who are allergic to chemical sunscreens? I have been using the Coola Mineral Matte(?) and like it , but it does leave me a little casper looking
Jackie you have to store the colourfx bottles upside down.
Also for everyone, I want to recommend that the actual amount of sunscreen you should apply is anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 a  tbsp, yes, tablespoon.  If you apply anything less than that you are not reaching the claimed protection your sunscreen offers. This is scientifically proven, i am not  sure why  Western brands don't give that kind of  information :/ . Sorry I don't have the sources right now but you guys can google it if you want confirmation :)
Jackieee what did you use to lay those EDGES THOOOOO??
I use the La Roche-Posay Anthelios 50 Mineral with zinc oxide and and titanium dioxide. The feel on the skin is great, and there is minimal white cast if any on my MAC NW20 skin. It's $33 in the US, and feels silky and not overly greasy on my dehydrated skin.
I'm pregnant, so I can't use chemical sunscreens right now. I'm hating using physical sunscreens. I'll have to try one of these after the baby is born.
I click like every time I hear Jackie, Jackie, Jackie, Jackiiiieee, Jackie, Jackie, Jackie!!!!!
What would you recommend for the Body?
she's a veteran, she's army strong but she's still also not trying to break a nail LOL
I love this video it’s so informative. I need to look better at these ingredients, 😂
😂😂😂 What's good YouTube Square up👊 Get them notifications together. \nI need some SPF in my life. I never wear any smh. I'ma do better lol.
Awww, is that Eggy you're wearing?! Jenn Im's clothing line? Loved the video Jackie! As always girl, you keep me laughing and informed! 😊
Oh shit I love Evelyn too!
Beautiful video! Would love it if u would have a peak at my channel and maybe like or subscribe to it.  I will be posting videos weekly!!
You don’t understand how happy I get when you start singing “Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie Jackie”😂😭
I’m definitely going to Sephora to check a couple out. Thanks for this Jackie❤️
IM HOLLERING MAMA WHYY DID YOU PUT ONE OF THE GROSS SISTERS FROM THE PROUD FAMILY😢😂😂😭😅😂😍MRS.JACKIE😅
Jackie your edges look so good 😍😘
If u are in asia...try sunkiller perfect watery essence (non alcohol version) gurll...itssss good...
Talking about spf with anyone else it's boring but with Jackie it's poppin🤣🤣🤣
I just discovered u! I'm glad I did
i love the alpha h spa 50. its moisturising and  smoothing too
HANDS DOWN MOST ENTERTAINING BEAUTY GURU! ADOPT ME!
Japan/Korean SPFs are where it’s at. I hated using SPF until I tried Asian SPF.
Well IBD! Chemical vs Physical SPF, learned something new today.
after spf 30 it really doesnt matter, u still have to reapply every 2 hours anyways...im sure they can invent an spf that lasts all day but....how will they make money? lol i dont think companies ever will tbh
....should i not be using regular sunscreen on my face then?
Yaaasssss! Thank you for being the plug, Jackie!! I’m still hunting for the Dream Screen. 6 weeks and counting 🙄
A physical sunscreen that works well for brown skin is the Drunk Elephant Umbra Tinte Spf 30. It doesn't leave a cast, but she does have peeling issues, so I have to spray fix plus or water on my face to make sure she gets mixed in good. Also, when dealing with a greasy sunscreen, I just set her with some powder and it's all good in the hood.
Can you use spf as primer?
there is no such thing higher than SPF 50 , they can say its higher eg. SPF70 but its a lie lol
I'm a sunscreen girl everyday since I was 14 no matter what. People ask how I'd get my makeup to last all day and I swear the spf helps it to stay all day. I call it the original primer.
Thank you
Came here from Bretmen Rocks snap😛😛
You are awesome!
**SKIN CANCER DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE**\n👏🏾👏🏾 yasss aunty Jackie!
Lmaoooooo beetlejuice 😂😂😂😂😂😂 dead
Thank you Auntie Jackie!! #blackgirlmagic✨
Jackie!! you have me rolling lmboo!
Lmao oops I thought adding spf products together actually worked.
Neutrogena oil free moisture?
My Auntie Jackie shouted out my Cousin Evelyn!
Skinceuticals makes some awesome ones!
It's still trending. 😊
YES you know EVELYN
From my own experience, if you have sensitive skin, extremely sensitive skin, maybe stay away from the chemical barriers. I've had even the best break me out. CeraVe and Cetaphil make decent oxide/physical barriers where I c an usually  get them to rub in mostly clear. If you  use a powder foundation you can actually tent it yourself as well. It's not usually that deep for me lol
I stand behind what I said about this movie, which is that I hated it. You don’t have to like a movie to do a tutorial on a look from it, & being that it’s the most popular movie right now, it would be dumb of me to not do a tutorial. Get over it 🎈
Being disrespectful and then going back to everything you say, cuz money is never enough. #ill-manneredchild
This is what I call a prettier version of pennywise
 And if not... you'll float SCREECH HIS COSTUME GOT ME CRACKING  UP
“Meet Pennywise’s younger cousin, Nickeldumb” 😂😂😂 I saw that on twitter and it’s my favorite comment about this lmfao.
and if you don't you'll float me: 😐*likes video so fast I spring my index finger*
fucking give credit to the creator of that song, you insensitive fuck. I hate you so much.
Bitch how do you even know what Pennywise looks like you were on your phone in the theatre
tbh i don’t even like him that much but this is one of the best pennywise makeup looks i’ve seen. he is rlly talented
I loved the movie It, and while I do think the whole drama is ridiculous, the fact that people are finding time to be rude to this guy (who I literally just started watching) is even more so. Lay off. A lot of people liked the movie so why not show people how to glam it up. Plus he may not have liked the movie but he thought Pennywise was cool. Whatever your opinions are, you shouldn't be putting out so much negativity, if this bothers you 👋🏼
That white stuff in the corners of his mouth grossed me out I couldnt finish video...sorry!
I'm never a person to hate. But why??
What are you doing you need to credit people for god sake stop being a dumb fuck!
Why James? If u hated the movie why do this?
“we’re all sisters down here”
..attention seeking, honestly. don't just do it for the views, do it if you actually want to. smh, i have respect for you still but it's low.. sorry. 😐
I love how glam the eyes are 😍
Honestly the hater will always look at everything  just to make you feel bad but don’t listen to them please because they are jealous bc you are a happy person ! Love you lots hope u see the positive comments and not the negative ones 😘😘 te amo
This makeup tutorial is so predictable I was texting my friend the whole time guessing what was next and I was never wrong. Get it brother. 🎈
All these commenters are pissy for the wrong reason. Liking someones art has nothing to do with inspiration that might come from it, right, I'm sure a ton of people wanted to see his take on it, so he made, one, for the fans, duh.  Anyway, what we SHOULD be mad about, is that James has used someone's music for the intro and not credited that artist. Andrew Michael @andrewmichaelofficial on gram.
im mad bc the eyeshadow palette he used was so pretty but on the morphe website it looks like shit and not the same at all :/
I love it! Your tutorials are always so great!!
You know, I respect how you felt about the movie because even thought you didn't like it you still appreciated the acting which is nice. People asked for you to do this and you delivered so go you and this is actually quite nice. Sorry for the drama but the fandom gets defensive.
Regardless if he did it for the money or not his makeup SLAYED.. and I think that is the ultimate factor since his channel is mainly based on makeup tutorials... just keep slaying sister James...love  ya..😚😚😚
You have this natural light within you that is so vibrant when you talk about things. Dont let it dim just because some people like to drink haterade in the mornings. You're an inspiration to boys and girls. Be true to yourself. You are young and are going to make mistakes.   Dont take anything too hard.
+James Charles its his opinion on if he likes the movie or not
He did give the film its props... why is everyone pissed that he thought it wasn't scary? I expected it to be a horror movie too but it was more of an awesome comedy...and who cares if he didn't think the movie was AMAZING and did a tutorial. News flash, this is probably one of the top ten looks for Halloween 2017, of course he should make a tutorial. *Shrugs*
Love the beat in the beginning. Great tutorial! I won’t see the movie, and I think it’s perfectly fine that you didn’t like it. YouTube is your JOB and you gotta do whatever will get you views. Good day Sister.
This was AN AMAZING TUTORIAL SISTER JAMES! 😉
He has an opinion he shouldn't be hated for it. Of course he's gonna do a tutorial wouldn't you? He just shouldn't have fought with wyatt and finn
He’s so good at this and the skull one to
5 minutes in and this is already awful, stay tuned for updates.
Already two minutes in and the video is horrible! Stay tuned for updates
He blinks way to much
you're an idiot, go read a book sister.
I have a idea for u! ....fuck you sister.

Already 5 minutes in and I already hate this fucking video. Stay tuned for updates
how do u dislike an iconic movie i’m
he's so sweet i love it
I love this\nLooks so real
So you stole  Andrew Michael song without permission  copyright.......
5 minutes in and this tutorial is already awful stayed tuned for more updates
He had white stuff in the corner of his lips the whole time... I couldn't pay attention to anything else🤦🏼‍♀️
How about you quit stealing artwork from other people...and im not just talking about similar  makeup looks. Im also speaking about the young man who's music you stole for this video... Didnt you just go on a snap chat rant about you give credit where credit is so !? Obviously not 👎
5 minutes in and this tutorial is already awful, stay tuned for updates.
I can’t look at him without being reminded of the dragon off of shrek
How do you delete someone else's entire existence?
HI SISTERS, NICKELDUMB HERE AND WELCOME TO ME MAKING MONEY OFF OF A MOVIE I FUCKING HATE!!!!
OMG a Finn wolfhard Comercial came on and and it made me laugh bc no offense I love you but I didn't really have to tell everyone you hated the movie but whatever
Okay. You didn't think the movie was scary but this is supposed to be scary somehow? The only thing that's about it is that it's on your face. And that's no play on words. ;)
Wow he finally gave credit to artist that made the music! Gooooo Andrew!!!!
i'm just gonna put this out there, he did do his job, james did, he did a tutorial for something that was requested by his fans, which is his job\n\nand it is completely fine to dislike something and make a tutorial of it, you don't always have to like your job, but how he so strongly expressed his hatred for it is what made it pretty disrespectful to the cast and crew of the movie because he's profiting off it\n\nbut of course i'm well aware this was all for controversy and attention
Can you CALM DOWN! you talk so fast how does anyone understand you😂
5 minutes in and this tutorial is already awful stay tuned for updates
I like you, James. What I don't like is that you're using the success of a movie you hate. Really annoying and hypocritical. It makes you look dumb.
Wow this makeup tutorial was predictable...hate it
Omghe looks like a dirt coffee filter 😂😂😂😂😂 I CAN'T
I'm not really sure why he hates it. he doesn't need to like it, but hate? wtf
Ah, nice to see the literal poison of this generation..
Finn Wolfhard tweeting James is the best thing that has, and ever will, happen to James.
James on twitter: I HATE IT\nAlso James: LETS DO A MAKEUP TUTORIAL
Already 5 mins into tutorial and it's awful stay tuned for updates
5 seconds into this video and it’s trash stay tuned for updates
Five minutes in and this tutorial is already awful stay tuned for updates

Your resultss were boommbb. I definitely need to try that jane carter nourish and shine. Maybe you could whip it like you would for a diy shea butter mix or melt it down for easier application. I need this hair color! Thanks for sharing
Ugh, this is the second time I have washed this, I am seriously considering co washing my hair this evening just so I can add shea butter directly to my leave in....Le sigh.
I love everything about this. I need to try this combo and see if it will work for me.

Wow your hair is so pretty😊
You are my hair length goals 😍
I had to stop by couldn't help it.you look Amazing
Literally no frizz ! Amaziinnnggg and so much definition
beautiful!!! LOVE THIS SONG!!!
So, I was struggling the past few weeks after my hair cut to get my old products to work in this southern humidity . This video came at The perfect time . I picked up the hair lotion and the nourish and shine ( I already had the gel) and applied everything as you suggested.  My hair is now shiny and defined with a strong but soft hold ! I love how it came out. Thanks for your videos !  These will be staples all winter!
Any other recommendations to substitute the lotion? For some reason SM products has been drying my hair out. Smh... great tutorial!
THIS WAS SO BOMB😭 can’t wait to try it!!! Literally perfection ❣️
Love it!!! For my Grand daughter!!! Also use White Vinegar to get the snarls out when wet...cheap treatment, doesn't smell.

I'm tired of seeing ppl show  products that don't work and say oh it gives nice fluffy results for how long 1 minute?! Lol anyway that's my little rant. I'm definitely going to try this combo. I use Cantu and ecostyler olive oil gel now and it works great but hair can never have too much moisture so I'm going to try the and see how they compare

OKAAAAY INTRO!
Love this color did you have and transfer of the color on your clothing at all?
I have texture similar to yours and when I first tried this gel with the LOC method and a regular curling cream I didn’t get the definition every one was raving over 😭 so then I tried it using Shea butter (like you used the Jane Carter) and it was literally my best Wash n go ever and my hair was so moisturized I had grease on my hands for DAYS every time I touched my hair. It was so soft and defined! So yes ladies if your hair is similar to hers THIS METHOD WORKS! Phenomenal video
My cocker spaniel has the same hair
looks liek burnt spaggeti
Congratulations on reaching 300K subscribers ❤️🤗. May your channel continue to flourish ✨☺️
I'm so about to binge on all your videos, I do need to catch up! Hey now 300K!!! I liiiiive!!! Love your videos always!!!
I would love to see a video about how your handling your postpartum shedding around your edges. I am not dealing with postpartum but my edges seems to be thinning and I am not sure why and what to do.
It looks beautiful! You're hair is growing back so fast.
Love the tutorial. I see that your hair is not dripping wet. Do you find that you get better results doing wash-n-gos on dry(damp) hair?
YASSS BIHH! I love this, I might just try this! I can’t wait to see the hair journey video :) YOUR TRENDING!! ❤️
You’re trending yassss🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
I'm an Exo_L and this is my first time adoring another kpop band's mv like I adore Exo. This is just art.
THE BEST 4:11 MINUTE OF MY LIFE
So much hip thrusting, facial expressions, and physical touching. I'm crying
Now I'm on the ground.
ugh the views on this video are so slow compared to the others. APPRECIATE THE PERFORMANCE UNIT THANKS.
lee chan is a king!
Time to stream this loudly for my neighbors!!!!! Shar8ng the love lol
Who gave Jun a choker?!\nAsdfghjkl I'm gonna die
This shows that big groups it's very hard for everyone to get attention but Pledis is smart for the units. Hopefully  they do the same with Pristin.  And a side note Starship should take notes from Seventeen and Loona
svt delivers best choreos in k-pop, without doubt.hoshi is g o d being the mastermind behind this
Where is wen jun hui stan??
LEGIT GOT MY MOUTH OPEN THE WHOLE TIME TF THEY'RE SO TALENTED
I started the song with 1 bias now i have 1 bias and 3 bias wreckers wtf
Song and choreography is just great. Hi Loves.
No but Seventeen is so confusing. Like should I look at my bias , Dino that little hoe or should I look at my other bias my precious Minghao or should I look at the beautiful angel Jun or should I look at my bias wrecker Hoshi. They're so frustrating y'all. 🙄
If I saw svt I would fall on the floor too
They just gave their very best for this , you can see how hard the dance moves are ! support our babies
Dem boi!! One shot MV. That is how talented they are. Applauseee!!!
I'm that pigeon in the beginning 😂
I'm kinda into it finally after 4 days.
OMG! This is so beautiful!
Not a carot but holy crap this is amazinggG
I didn't knew i was crying until the video ended and i was claping and breathing fast
At some points the song is ordinary but their dance made it extraordinary.
Svt never failed to amaze me
WHOS THAT AT 0:58 ? 😍
Wow amazing....
Minghao and Junhui ❤️❤️❤️
we hit 1M viewers!
I'm speechless

Thousands of bias lists must have been wrecked because of Dino
This song its like they've been allowed to bring their inner  sexiness out !! 😭💔 *perfect unit*
While Hip Hop team came in all black and killed us.. Performance team came as angels to revive us... And Kill us Again
I have a feeling with all these masterpieces that we're not going to be prepared for the vocal team's release either.

Hi i'm new can anyone tell me their names ?
who's the one in the center at 1:30 ?? he's so hot omg
can someone tell me who is who?
I need help learning who the members are because I'm trying to join this fandom
Dino @2:43 though😊
Great tribute to a legend.
I love Brandon for always paying homage to those that influenced him and came before him. I love all the music he always mentions and talks about. I guess I connect to him in that way. Great video and cover!
I was there😊 they were amazing 🔥
this made me so happy that they did this
One of my favorite songs sung by my favorite band. Awesome!
At least they're set will one good song
Why I love music.....Petty was the best.
And then segueing into Mr. Brightside. Perfect tribute
For a cover, it's pretty darn good! Huge respect to The Killers for this amazing tribute.
Watched this live! Great way to open to the show!!!! They should do this cover on their next Sawdust type album!!!
The Killers have always struck me as having Tom Petty and Heartbreakers' songwriting sensibilities (sure they may get a little more ornate sometimes, with Sam's Town seeming like an homage to Queen) and Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's energy. Flowers' voice forces you to focus on the heart before the head. He's got a gift.
Such an amazing way to start a great set. So happy I made it out!!!
That was awesome, thanks so much! Beautifully done!
Feels
They were absolutely amazing at ACL!!!!
Hi there,\n\nDid you shoot this video footage? If so, we would like to use it as part of an article on our website Radio X - http://www.radiox.co.uk and also  associated social media channels with a credit.  Could you please get back to me asap and let me know if this is ok? Many thanks!\n\nCrystal
The sentiment was lovely, but the result was awful. I've heard better bar bands---not that I expected the killers to live up to the musicianship of the Heartbreakers to begin with.
everyone needs to put her out of her misery and not vote for her to stay another week.
Why is this trending.
So glad Bruno backed Shirley Ballas and told Brendan where to shove it. Utterly disrespectful, he's always had such an anger problem.
Firstly, Charlotte looks like a matured version of Taylor Swift. But quit trying to make her look sexy, Brendan. She's clearly not comfortable looking sexy. Somehow I felt she was not keeping to the steady tango walk (she went up and down against Brendan), I think she forgot to flex her knees. Not good still. 5
Didn't enjoy this one. Charlotte just seemed awkward and uncomfortable through out. Also Brendan's comment was completely uncalled for. Well done to Bruno for calling him on it.
Dragged from pillar to post... poor girl. Nerves again got the better of her I think. Could have been dynamic and staccato with the right paring...\n\nI just don't think they are gelling at all. Charlotte looked MORTIFIED when Brendan had a go at Shirley... Not nice to watch on an entertainment show. These two clearly have beef off-set. We the public don't want or need to see that.\n\nI hope they go tonight, getting unpleasant again (he was ott on 'It Takes Two' last week.) sadly and no-one should display the anger that Brendan did there... poor. Bring on Neil next year and get rid of Brendan.
I think that the judges were fair and there was no need for Brendan to answer back to the HEAD judge like that. He was just dragging her across the floor. I didn't like it
Charlotte doesn't have the technique or is even entertaining on the dance floor.... it's normal that her scores are low same with Ruth p.ex Susan may not be a great dancer but you can see she's enjoying herself..I much rather watch a bad happy dancer than a train wreck :(
The judges were quite harsh, but Brendan had no excuse to act like such an ass. \nI don't think she's enjoying the competition at all, would probably be relieved to go out this week tbh.
Yeah, that foxtrot seems a million miles away now. She's just getting shoved around. Also, shut up Brendan. 3.0/10
terrble dragged around not good brendan was horrible to shirley 3/10
Can I get a thumbs up here folks? Hey @BBCStrictly - you know what makes for uncomfortable television? Not watching poor old Charlotte plod around the floor - but watching that angry, narcissist Brendan Cole. He can't take a woman judging him, especially one that knows more about dancing than he ever will and that also beat him to the judging position he wanted. He's rude, disrespectul, takes himself waaaay too seriously and should be warned that if he keeps this up he'll be off the show. Nobody wants to watch this angry man bring the show down. Tell him to shut it - or leave.
She has no personality... Such a boring contestant..
Bloody hell people, what's the matter with you? This was a perfectly acceptable dance for week 2. She had a few moments of rise and fall, but it certainly wasn't as much as Shirley seemed to think. Brendan stuck up for Charlotte because Shirley crucified her dance when it wasn't deserved; she'd make marked improvements and had many good points to praise. It's clear that Charlotte lacks in confidence, and I feel that Shirley comments were more about knocking Brendan than they were about critiquing Charlotte. There were other pairs that night who were spoken to far more kindly than Charlotte was and her performance was far better. I think the judges sometimes forget that they are speaking to other adults, not children.
This had rise and fall, and her frame was not strong enough. 4/10.
Ah yes, there is a little rise and fall towards the end. Not down low enough and she is an awkward, self conscious dancer but maybe she can improve.
Charlotte looked gorgeous but unfortunately she looked prettier then how she danced this was a hot mess 4/10
Unfortunately, this dance didn't suit her. Her posture and her frame were bad. Her footwork was bad - no heel leads at all. In addition, there was no emotion, she didn't portrayed the character of this dance... she looked  cold and even nervous.... the choreography was great, her musicality was excellent and her standing spin was very good, but the rest of the dance (in terms of hold, posture, technique and performance) were disappointing. A 5.
She didn't seem comfortable at all and there was almost no sticatto from Charlotte. She showed promise in Week 1, but I feel like she's only gonna shine in those Waltz-esque dances.\n\n4/10
1 am not an expert but i know what rise and fall is (as in waltz) and, after re-watching dance,  gemma did not do it.. \nIn spins and 'poses' she was 'taller' and if you look is spins on the balls of her feet and she IS TALL so she rose but that is not rise and fall.\nI have no complaint with brendan standing up for her, \ni have no complaint about the fact gemma was pulled and pushed throughout the dance and was generally bad but it was better than week one\ni am annoyed this issue was not mentioned/handled in the Sunday show - that was a disgrace\nIf professionals cannot defend their partners then make that a scd rule and keep all professionals silent as judges make they comments.\nas for being too competitive - they all are - pro and celeb - they all want to win and be correctly critiqued
Awful he had to drag her to keep her frame up . And Brendan giving flack to Shirley since she started can he not take being judged by a woman? His snarky comments help no one especially Charlotte
Poor dancer..
Terrible dance and she's getting dragged across the floor! Also Brendan's attitude needs to be sorted, it's a competition but at the end of the day it's a bit of fun. He takes it too seriously, that's not what dancing is about!
WHO IS HERE JUST TO SEE IF SHIRLEY WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE RISE AND FALL LOL
That new judge is awful, she needs to be aware she is addressing the public, she has no respect from me, we know she knows her dancing and steps we do not want to hear it. She caused Brendan to react to her. NO professional judge should cause that. It is totally uncalled for her to make Brendan have to point out her mistake.To be honest I am fed up with Bruno shoving himself about I just wish he's wack that judge and shut her up. Bad move stricktly we do not like her.\n Brendan they do not need to tell you about dancing you are a professional judge yourself and this is week three.You did great getting Charlotte to come back.Try and let her make her own mistakes she is good and it will show. Don't rise to that nasty judge she is an embarassment to Strictly
I think that Shirley was too harsh. What she said was right but she talks to some in a rude way rather than a constructive way! Brendan was a bit quick to argue back but I think he could hear the way she talks to others in comparison to the way she talks to charlotte and I'm not surprised he was angry! Charlotte was nervous and clearly just needed someone to acknowledge her efforts rather than just lay into her. It is only week 3
Feel like Charlotte and Brendan don't get along... he takes it way to seriously and needs to relax a bit.  You can tell she is so tense especially when getting the scores
Brendan needs to learn to shut his mouth
Brendan had a right to stick up for his partner.its only week three she never danced before(unlike some people on the show )u can tell sheirly dosnt like Brendan tentoin onto nights show proves it. Well done u to u can improve each week.xx
The thing with Shirley is that I am actually learning about the dances. I like the detail she puts into her critiques. Brendan really just needs to remind himself it's Sat night tv. Laugh it off like Anton. He's making it hard for Charlotte to enjoy herself. She just looks scared and non enthused and unlike the second shooter you cannot debate the fact that there WAS rise and bloody fall!!!
she looks gorgeous every week but my guess is she was terrified again because she looked joyless out there :(
Brendan was disrespectful to Shirley. His choreography is not really that good nor is his teaching style. Remember what happened with Anastasia? He just couldn’t choreograph something that would make her shine or teach her basics. He gets sick and in come Gorka. He taught her and choreographed a beautiful routine which was her highest score. Brendan returns and they get eliminated. I think it’s time for him to go
I can understand why the rise and fall was there. If you look closely, you can see it's because she keeps quite low while moving in hold. When she straightens up in the dance to pose and because of her height it looks like a rise. I think Shirley is waay too harsh.
this is disappointing i thought after her first dance she showed promise and potential but these last 2 dances have not been good she's in danger tomorrow i think Charlotte and Rev Richard will be in the dance off
Who?
Are we still doing phrasing?!
Surprising, if disappointing, lack of Archer related comments...
Well done Brendan for sticking up for your lady in a respectful way.  Shirley was unkind and Bruno joining in just made him look like a  bully
yasss the old Brendan is back
Why the hell is this trending?
She looks REALLY uncomftable
DANGER ZONE!!!
This woman can't dance
Poor Charlotte, looks so uncomfortable when Brandon back talks Shirley. She has a higher status than you, do not have a go at someone who clearly knows what their talking about
She needs to feel more comfortable with Brendan, trust him and let him lead! Good week 1, but there is more improvement needed. 4/10
If she isn't in the dance off she needs to come back strong better than last week but not good enough that motorbike looks expensive, 5
Wow nice cute but the best
Welcome back old Brendan! We didn't miss you.
Clear rise and fall - you don’t need to be a dance expert to be able to see that (and I’m not) - the judges were right, Brendan!!
She should have gone home, just doesn't seem to care and no effort is shown, this dance would have been amazing if it was someone else
She is so graceful, but he pushes her about too much and makes the dance about himself. The dance would be much less stunted if he wasn’t pushing her around. Also do keep your mouth shut Brendan. You are the most unpleasant dancer we’ve had on strictly, and you have no right to try and correct a judge, especially Shirley, head judge. Well done to Bruno to putting you in your place.
I'm surprised Brendan is still on the show as I don't think he has the spirit of it- too serious
I do see where everyone is coming from but brendon is just saying what he has to say because most peole just smile and nod their heads but i surpose everyone was being harah except charlotte
Charlotte is like a mannequin.
i like Charlotte...but my God...she is awful
Disaster, Charlotte is way too far to the right of Brendan which is distorting the frame. This seems like a rushed job as she appeases to be skipping along the floor which is creating the illusion that they’re using rise and fall which is not the way a tango should be done... Totally agree with Shirley. I score this a 3.
Brendan shouldn't have said there was no rise and fall until he'd watched the dance back. He'd made himself look a bit of an idiot after a few million of us had watched Charlotte rising and falling .....
Change of the jacket and these two could easily play sandy and Danny 💙
Why the fluff is this 11 on trending
I congratulate her on coming back from last week's display, but the potential of her Foxtrot in week 1 is becoming a distant memory.If she survives this week, I hope she starts a) enjoying herself and b)discovering some performance skills and characterisation-I think that would help her actually and Brendan for that matter.
better than last week but there is still room for improvement
I'm disappointed. I said she'll pull it back with some ballroom this week, guess I was wrong. She could be in trouble. Not good. 4.
A little improvement. Needs a little bit more improvement to get to week 4. 3
If this was a dance that required 'Rise and Fall' the judges would probably have said that it was non existent. Bruno is the arch exponent of rise and fall,  he can barely keep his posterior positioned on his chair.
i'm going to be generous with my remarks here. Charlotte definitely gets nervous beforehand and that affects her ability to dance. I think she played the character of the Tango very well actually. my mark - 6.
A nice girl but a little stiff in the hips.
As a dancer Charlotte is being throne round by Brendon because she is doing everything really bad like her frame no offence but also Brendon was very rude to the judges !
She’s just shit
Charlotte looks like  a homeless Taylor swift
They're through for another week
Charlotte gets nervous ,she looked great,but I bet she doesn't like showing so much flesh..that effects her dance routines..I thought harshly marked as much improvement...up to judges to give her confidence not tear into her.judges you can tell have their favourites...strictly possibly coming to the end of its run now!
Hm, I did like it though. Wasn't the best dance ever of course. But still enjoyable. I think the judges votes for them are more of a personal vote than a professional vote. They are really harsh on Charlotte.....
Beauty... But dead behind the eyes
Gosh i want her out, she's just not good
No sense of rhythm.
Mr I Fancy Myself Strikes again I really hate him
Brandon is known to be hotheaded but for her sake he needs to be carafull. It's all about her, not him.
The problem with Brendan is that he is insufferable. Even if he is part of s fantastic dance I still don’t enjoy it.
I wish the judges would stop being so harsh and having favourites!!! The dance was brilliant - I enjoyed it and I'm sure all #TeamCharcole fans enjoyed it as well!
Wasn't impressed last week but was a big improvement however the judges were too harsh on Brendan but his comments weren't appreciated\n5
I protect these two so much, Shirley may have been right about the rise and fall but no need to tear the poor girl to shreds. Feel like the judges have it in for team Charcole, Craig was actually the nicest! Well, despite it being 3rd from bottom, a HUGE improvement on last week, well done! Just keep building that confidence up, fingers crossed for team Charcole!
Most gallant of Brendan to defend his partner.  Especially considering that the head judge has a tendency to mark down the female contestants.
Why is this on trending? #8
Trending? More like Tossed money at YouTube.\n\nYou really expect us to believe that this video that hasn't even hit 100k views in over a day is trending?\n\nGeeze just make a tab called  'Paid Promotions' please.
I no longer live where I can watch this live and am limited to the videos that are posted here on youtube.  A lot of the comments mention Brendan's comments.  What happened???
Brendon said he messed up....where in the routine did he mess up?
I don't see why people keep on hating on her 🤔 I know she's not the greatest dancer there but can't u see the improvement from last week. Brendon's answering back has just ruined it for her Because now she's caught up between the judges and Brendon disagreement .From now on I'm only expecting low scores and I literally feel so sorry for her 😩😭.i just hope that the judges give her a chance to boost her confidence like how she was like at the beginning of the show
How is this trending 😂😂
Wooden horse comes to mind
She’s hurtin’ for a squirtin’
I'm seriously annoyed with Brendan acting like that, saying Shirley doesn't know what she's talking about, but I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
What's a rise and fall?
Someone please explain what rise and fall is?!?!?!
I'm actually on Brendan's side with the whole Brendan and Shirley conflict! I like how he defends himself. Not a huge fan of Shirley
Who else realises that Brendan has to make a speech every time him and his partner get slightly bad comments? - I can't be the only one. Right?\n\nBrendan was of course lying - that or he's a very bad choreographer. It had loads of rise and fall.
I apologize. Even though I'm a huge fan of the show, I don't know a lot about techniques of dancing and their names. What is a rise and fall? :)
Free update and people are complaining.\n\nWow, please ignore them Frontier. A lot of us love the free content we are getting. Keep up the good work.
Hi Planet Coaster, I have few more ideas for the game: \n- It can be good if we could make attractions more original ( like changing the height of the screamenator)\n- Can you do a ferry for making little tours ( like in Disney Land in Paris )\n- Can you do Coaster which are launch on an ascent ( like Space mountain in Disney Land in Paris), and launch coasters whith a Square rail ( like Kingda Ka )\n- Can you do like differents types of trains for one type of Parkour ( if I want to do Kingda Ka, I can only use the Ferrari train)\n\nI'm very happy whith cascade, I wated for it long Time ! \nI'm french so there might be mistakes but I love your game, continue to improve it.\nI hope you'll read this, and like if you are agree !
PICNIC BENCHES!!!!
Would really like to see a water slide / pool dlc
I love building theme parks thank you for this amazing game and congratulations for this first anniversary 👏🎢🎡
Picnic benches !! I want beach chairs ! LOL no this will be a cool update. Thanks frontier.
Thank you for continuing to bring us so much content for free! Fantastic team of devs!
Where's the skyride
When they do waterparks... Imma buy that DLC right away. I love where this game is at already
Why in the world would they have an Expo if they are not going to announce everything from an update that is only one month away? I feel bad for the people who wasted their money to go to that lame show.
If you added a waterpark DLC, you could make a lot of money off of it.
Please make a bobsled coaster
Unbeliveble what this Team fo us do. Thank you very much Frontier for your work and the next Update.
Wow, scenario editor. This. Just. Got. Real.
Snakes? Did you say snakes?\n\nA standard. A symbol. Perhaps on a shield. Two snakes coming together... Facing each other! But they're one!
I just love how people still complain that this update is not enough. Really? I mean all the new mechanics that's just not enough. Jesus Christ people.
Im exited for cascade, but a bobsled coaster is still something im waiting for fronteir
I would love to see the Vekoma SLC, a Skyscraper Flat Ride, A natural Intamin Launch Coaster Like Kingda Ka, Stormrunner, and so on and a Coaster Train Like Intimidator 305
Looking forward to it, can’t wait! The devs do a wonderful job on this game, you’ll can be very proud of it. Thank you for showing my Pixel Island park in the community video, so cool! 😍🌎🎢
We need the infinity coaster sooo bad
Make a update that you can controle the age of the coasters and rides
i really like the swastika ride
love it can't wait.. but will there ever be save path to blueprint ... that would be so awesome and would make it easier to snap an blueprint to the ground
Can't wait for the update, looks so freaking good:)
Can you please add a reguöar wild mouse, like the one at bakken in denmark
Thank you! I as just starting a greece area in my park and I was complaining all the time that there's no water coaster!
Am I the only one who noticed the Shroom ride arms being the shape of a Swastika?
id love to play this in VR
You guys are doing such fantastic work after all this time. Thank you for bringing beauty and true creativity for tycoon games of this generation. :) I love this game so much and it has made me really get that enjoyment I use to have playing these games back in the day. Such talented and epic developers! THANK YOU!
I don't know if you guys will see this or not but I just want to say thank you so much for being, well honestly, the best dev team I have ever seen. You guys genuinely show concern about us players and that, to me, is the most important thing when dealing with consumers. Again, thank you for adding so much free content and showing the PC community how much you care!
This update looks interesting. I think the updates to staff management may be a little too complex, but I'll give it some time to see. Tables are an awesome idea, now I can make a themed, sit down cafe. Some updates I would like; The ability to explore your park as a guest (could work with vr), Water transport rides and other transport rides, and maybe some way to incorporate a hotel.\nOne thing I like over RCT3 is that guests factor in the transport rides when navigating to a ride. One complaint I have is the fireworks placement and sequencing. I prefer the old RCT3 sequencer and being able to place generic launchers and just place the various elements in them.  \nThis game is still very addicting, so keep up the good work.
Just read the comments and I haven't played the game yet so obviously I can't relate to the complaints, but this is a pleasant surprise because I was considering buying it and this is a nice push into wanting to buy it even more, thank you Planet Coaster :D
I will cry when we see the day when they finally add motion simulators
Free stuff? I love free stuff! Thank you so much, Frontier, for continuing to develop the game! :) Still so much love being thrown into this game and your other big projects!
I'd love to see sit-down restaurants where you can customise the layouts of tables and stuff, and also picnic areas for parks (families sat down on grass and stuff) haha I know these are pretty menial requests, but it would add such a level of immersion
I don't get it, it's frontier's game, they do what they want to do with it, it's free and fantastic, thank you frontier for giving us free updates and we love your game,
Looks great, not much content though which I'm hoping means they are working on a water park expansion behind the scenes ;)
Good progress, getting the management side of things up is needed .. I would love too see you  guys increase the AI interaction priorities, have guests stop and interact more with each other and staff in random ways .. more random AI animations like stopping to take photos ... also have them use benches more diversly, rather than just go to closest bench.  Everyone walking around in a giant heard like zombies feels a bit weird.
Awesome features! I'd love to see a weather system.
Very nice stuff, reminds me the Theme Park and Theme Hospital era.  The next game will be the Planet Hospital? xD
I always love the free updates it seems like some cool content in this one! I will also pay to see WATER PARKs please!?
yo when it showed the gient robot Phix made i immediately went to the steam workshop to download it
When is the release
When is the update coming out
Just a quick thing, I find the white background behind the speakers distracting... it's far to bright... the best moment was transfereging from a video back to the stage with a nice black background.
this should have been named the round of applause panel
What happened to showing us a roadmap for future DLC and updates? Overall, like most have been saying, I feel like this updates a bit lackluster. However, I appreciate the free updates, and hope they continue!
It would be cool to see the addition of track drop sections & track switches. pretty damn cool so far though.
I hope the rode is going to be a intamin launch
Doesn't that Wise Horn Canopy ride normally have more Hills in the circle? It seems so flat here. I remember as a kid there being more hills.\nLooking forward to the ability to change cars on tracks.
Is that the Star Wars kid?
For the peeps upset about the content.. I'm sure theres more than they previewed here.  The 1 year mark for this game is a big deal considering what it started out as. I'm sure the PC Team have a lot more in store to mark it.  I'm really excited to see the adjustments to staff management.  I hope that trend continues and we get a much more in depth management system delivered over the next year.  In all honesty, the management aspect of the game needs a lot of love. There is so much potential there.  Lets hope the next 12 months see the game move forward even more.
WOW that water coaster so nice
Frontier is awesome! Best developer in years.
Planet Coaster, when will this Update be released to the Public?
I would PAY PAY PAY for much more content. I want DLCs, Addons, ... love this game :-)
I'd happily pay another $30 USD for Waterparks. Fewer assets than Animals and Safaris plus I'd go back to playing the game again.
Did I miss when they said a date for it? Since it's anniversary does that mean it's coming in November?
Does anybody know if - and if yes, how - you can change the map size in the scenario editor?
Planet coaster: I am a big fan of Carnival flat rides and I was just wondering why no one has yet created the Double Farris Wheel that is usually seen at fair grounds?
I'm so thrilled to see you guys have made it this far. Your game is great and you all should be very proud.
Audio for Vocals is too Low and the Audio for Music too Loud.
I love the new water ride!
Glass, Swimming Pools & lots of Scaffolding... That's what I want.
WATERPARK DLC
AW HEELL YEUUUS ❤\n\nSo excited :D
Scenario Editoooor!!!! 🍾🍾👏🏻👏🏻🎉🎉
S&S space shot next please!
Add swimming pools please
Need more water park & zoo dlc like RCT 3.
Audio?
OMG YES! Water Coaster! Side-Friction Wooden Coaster! Changeable trains!
Scenario editor!!! DAY MADE!
Frontier, well done!!
wann werden den echte Glasscheiben entdeckt,oder erfunden??
We need waterparks!! (I'm frensh)\n;)
What do you think is the unannounced coaster?
go channel5gaming
I first bought this game last year, and somehow didnt like it, and gave it back via steam refund. Bought it again this year, and fell in love with it.... was it me who changed, or did the game change that much?
I still hype this game its such a great game. I hope you expand it even more with more content such as country based stuff for example Japan themed content :D
why can't they make planet coaster free?
I want the soaked DLC for Planet Coaster! ;P
Thank you so much Frontier for the staff management features! This is what I’ve been hoping for since I first heard about the game being developed!
With that matterhorn ride that is coming in the future, if I rode that in real life I would probably die from hyperventilation, because I would be worrying that I would run out of air.
First I want to make a shoutout to the people who are making amazing Planet coaster content but are really struggling to get heard. Usually these so called ''featured creators'' get the majority of the attention. Who came up with that? It only encourages elitism.\n\nOkay, 1 new flat ride, 2 new coasters, a staff management building, picnic tables, scenario's and the ability to place different cars on same tracks. \nI'm so glad this update is free because just like the spooky pack, wich wasn't free... this is basic game content.\n\n Take picnic table for example, Zoo Tycoon 1 already had this feature and that game is 16 years old...\n\nScenario's. About time... I know many park simulation games wich already had this feature at the launch of the game.\n\n1 new flat ride and 2 new coasters. The coasters are nice. But i've expected more in terms of flatrides and track rides.\n\nI like the staff building, adds more realism to the game.\n\nPlacing different cars on same track. Good, a feature which screamed to be added.\n\nIt doesn't harm to be critical and we should not applaud every nack they add to the game that isn't really new and innovative.
Those interesting name of those rides! How do you guys come up with the names of them?
I'd love to see functionality to make true racing coasters (synced-up parallel stations) or even functionality for track switches (taking cars off or adding cars to the track when rides get busy)
All I want is to be able to build on the train station grid!
Are We Finally Getting Dynamic Weather after the billionth ask?!
Okay, this would probably be a lot of work, but I had to get the idea out there before I forgot, anyway. \nMy idea is scripted live-action stunt shows, like the ones I've seen in every theme park ever. Wild-West shows, the pirate ship battle show, I've even seen a Batman one at Six Flags.\nThe base is a stage area, on which you can place scenery, and hired staff are actors in the show. You can create a script that the actors follow. Run here, shoot there, fall down onto airbag after being shot there... etc etc. I'm sure these guys could create amazing things with a tool like that in the game. \nAnd what park guest doesn't like to get off their feet and enjoy a show??\nI dunno, I think it would be awesome to see what people could create. The possibilities would be endless!!
Still waiting for a fully-fledged expansion pack like water parks, zoos, or even dark rides.
A couple of in game scenarios would've been nice.
I can't even play this game anymore :( takes too much to run it. I have a super good $2500 computer and I still can't run it
This game has amazing art and graphics, but i get bored with it fast. I think RCT3 is still more fun than this boring gameplay. Also I think the theft and vandalism thing sucks and should be able to be turned off in the settings.
That crowd is terrible! This people did all this work and people barely clapped! How dare they!
Just glad it was streaming I would of been as excited as people in the room ( dead silent ) after the 3 things were announced yippee saved £ on this clowns blowing there own trumpet over Notting lol
I was hoping for alot more. More Scenery stuff more rides more coasters, but...
The coolest game ever \nBut I would like a PS4 version \nI don't know if it is possible but ...
I expected a bit more :( The water coaster is cool but i really don't care about the management stuff.
Don't hype this up to be groundbreaking new updates and then deliver this. You shot yourselves in the foot with this one Frontier.
I wish there was more content on YouTube like this.
my new fav video on this channel.  :)
Whats the music in the first 10 seconds I recognise it from somewhere.
Great video again! Youre basically doing same quality of content as NoClip, but with more oddball, yet interesting topics.\n\nDDR was pretty similar to what it was like in Czechoslovakia too (later on Czech and Slovak Republics). Its kinda suprising that you dont reference the lack of Intellectual Property laws and how theyve affected opinions on piracy. So in short for the people from outside of central and eastern europe: Imagine 80s and 90s with no NES, SNES, Mega Drive etc., except for occasional knockoffs and lack of willingness to pay for any software :).
If ever someone says Communism is the best thing ever, point them towards East Germany... that might shut them up for a few minutes until they start saying But it just hasn't been done right yet!
8:08 thanks for the fan service george
This story is a jewel. I have researched the history of computing in the Warsaw Pact countries and it is wonderful to see the quality of this work. I am grateful. Thank you very much.
It depresses me to know that my parents and other relatives back in Romania had to live and grow up under these conditions and I only narrowly avoided being born under Communism.
But games aren't political though.
What is this? WHAT IS THIS!?? An American talking about something from beyond the Iron Curtain? And doing proper research on it? And presenting it in a bearable manner? my compliments go to that!\n\nWhen I clicked on the video I seriously expected it will be all like HUHUH, they didnt have NENTENDUH, HUHUH, they suck!
I loved the music choices in this vid. And this was a very interesting topic.
That's some great parents.
7 minutes in and I still don't see the point this video is trying to make...
The animations were my favourite part, Dad Gorg continues to raise the bar for everyone.
Great, informative video! In Finland, we also had commodore programs broadcast over the radio so you could record it on a cassette.
I come close from Koblenz and i wondered why i could never find a NES. gameboy. SNES or any other console/pc on a fleamarket.\nThey didn't have that shit lol.
I dig the sad Tetris theme
It is shocking that East Germany were way behind Poland (my homeland country neighboring with former East Germany) in video games field. In Poland were not produced home computers in late 80' nevertheless they were imported from West Germany (Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and later Amiga). At these times on flea markets you could get many games (of course pirated but back then in Poland were not defined anti-piracy law) therefore we could play many different games from the west. In Poland video game consoles became popular in early 90' when communism was overthrown and one of Polish company imported Taiwan famiclones (Famicom/NES clone) known today as Pegasus. To be honest I miss these days, it was really good times.
Polyplay... German company... polyplay... commissioned by the governmetn to manipulate the masses... polyplay... polybius ?
The animation is amazing and I love it.
Nice, some German history beside the obvious one.
There is something that makes no sense, a underlined fact that makes no sense. If you're going to have some crazy half step embargo against basically any kind of electrical based tech, why have electricity at all. It would all and all lead to a better life ingeneral without electricity, the only thing electricity does outside of entertainment is make people lazy POS, so basically baring electric entertainment based tech, makes having electricity at all pointless.
What music begins playing at 28 seconds?
Okay, seriously, why didn't it show up in my subscription box despite me having you subbed and the bell on?
Great video as always George. I saw a cip from  Curse of the grey elephant at 6:40, did you watched it? Because i would be interested in your thoughts about it.
I spat my drink out when he pronounced comparison , instead of comparishon*
Surely Michael Gorbachev takes some credit for the wall?
imagine the games we could create if east germany rose again\nI'd be the leader of the new gdr and I'd allow war games as long as they where through perspective of eastern countries
Your videos keep making this political scientist smile. Keep up the good work
I strongly recommend to the people who liked this video to watch the Dendy russian video about an angry russian dude (acting like the AVGN) talking about his childhood playing those NES knockoffs and ports of newer games on that nes hardware. It's very interesting and fun to watch!
When it worked.\n\nIt never worked. That's why the lines and the poverty were so different when the unification happened.
But nintendo is eastern.
So this might be an influence to why Yager made the most prolific anti-war war game to date?
I had never thought of, or even thought to think of, gaming in the Eastern Bloc.\nExcellent topic choice, and as usual, excellent video.\nThank you for this!
That museum was very cool. Really liked seeing the old games and tech.
lol, my mum didn't see a pineapple till she was 18, let alone video games
I visited the museum last year with my college class it was extremely interesting(The pain station was the center piece of our whole time there, did you play it bunny?) but they never quite went into how the machines etc. were programmed that was very interesting finding it out from this video. \nDid you manage to get to the DDR museum bunny? I found it very interesting as well.
Haha communism really suck. It will never work out, ever.
was fun to hear about my  homeland on this channel ^.^
This is one of many reasons as to why I do not support Socialism/Marxism
Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)
And that's why I dislike communism.
Everytime governments think they've controlled markets, people make their choices anyway. This is why black markets exist.
If only communism would've actually been a good way to run a country and not make everyone hate it and want to leave, because ultimately it's not in our nature to behave that way.\nI was born way past that time, but it does sound like a fucking nightmare. By the by, I never learned stuff like this in school. All we ever talked about was how bad Hitler was and nothing else, like what our country was actually like.
With people even resorting to broadcasting source code to each other over the radio... \n\nLook at what lengths these people went to make games work back then! Meanwhile publishers like 2K can't be bothered to get 2K18 under freaking 16 GB for the Switch...
btw dendy is a chinese system and was simultaneously on market with sega16bit and ps1 (n64 and snes too but no one ever cared about nintendo)
wow this video made it into youtube's trending, well deserved in my opinion
This is also the case in all of the former soviet bloc countries. Taping software/games on cassettes in order to share them to the few people who had some sort of bootleg commodore 64 was common practice.
I am glad that Marxism did not prevail in the free world.
The Stasi secret police museum is actually not very far away from the video game museum. It's 10 minutes on the train system they have there.
It's not that related to the topic at hand, but that museum is great. In there you can have a chat with one of the first chat bots called Eliza, created in the 60-s. When I was there I told it it's 2014 and it told me I'm insane.\n\nThey also have the weirdest arcade pong machine called Pain station. You move the bar by rotating an analog tumbler with your right hand, while your left hand is pressed against a metal grate with electric contacts. If you take your left hand off that grate, you lose. The gist is - every time you miss a ball, random danger zones appear on the screen. If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts. We've had enough after like 5 minutes. The record holder, as we were told, has managed to endure this for several hours.
amazing ingenuinity on part of east german programmers, even if their gaming industry never kicked off\nimagine playing western games for hours so that you can make your own copy from scratch and discussing coding with other programmers through (non-electronic) mail\nhats off to people like andre weißflog
The Hudson river, two years ago...
Channels like this are making youtube more serious planform than a national tv. But than again there are much more stupid stuff on youtube.
1:06 I live in berlin and never knew about this sooooo....yeah ;)
Thank you great video. Much needed.  We are still susceptible to the temptations and failed promises of socialism.
Man.. I can't watch this anymore. It's too depressing.
This is 44th in trending right now.\nNever expected you to be there but I'm glad nonetheless, great video George.\nBut when's next TOVG podcast bruh?
I think your video is on trending, at least on mine it seems. \n\nGood to see hard work pay off.
Sounds like current year gaming politics.
I wish I were employed and not just an intern, to support you on Patreon >_> Hopefully I can do it in the future, you totally deserve it!
Makes me feel blessed to live in a time where I can buy any pc or console and any game for it...
4:45 very interested in this but I'm having trouble finding more info about having software on a vinyl disc.
The Soviets were going to make a Nintendo knockoff called the Dendy?\nNot the Денде?\nI'm not doubting you at all, but that is so weird...
Dude, you really have a lot of talent. As cliche as it sounds, this really has a lot of meaning in the scientific community as it stands in america. The government holding back its citizens in scientific discovery is mind boggling.
Hi, German here. What do you mean by Hasselhof was not responsible for tearing down the wall?
Your work is so good and very appreciated.
Now I want to see a period film about a ragtag but lovable group of young game devs living behind the iron curtain in the 80s
Thats a new subject matter. DANKA  I am makeing subscrib to wonderful YouTubes channel.
Holy shit my boy bunnyhop made trending? So cool to see!
How can Cloth Map be making 16 grand a month to visit Eurovision and you're hear making amazing content like this and selling George Socks to survive?
Eastern European countries actually were making imitations of zx spectrum (commodore) and we had them all over the USSR in the 80s. We had all the games on pirated cassette tapes sold all over the street markets.
When people conplain about gaming being addictive, violent, sexist and other sorts of things, I think they are the offspring of those Communists with ideologies that just don't make any real sense when there are so many serious stuff in the real world but they get so offended by works of fiction it is a strange comparison.\n\nSure even capitalist countries got worried about violence in gaming, but allot of those who were worried have deep communist beliefs how everything needed to be done to their standards that were often unrealistic.
This video was ..... really cool
I need to work on german subtitles for this video ASAP. My family comes from East Germany and I bet my mum would love to watch the video! Problem is; her english is terrible, she wouldn't understand most of this.
and people still insist socialism is the way to go..
You've got to wonder sometimes.\nPart of the Soviet Block's problems were just a severe lack of industrial capacity.\n\nAround the time Communism took hold, if you compare Russia to the United states, one has massive amounts of industrial infrastructure, the other is still dominated by rural farmland and relatively little industry to speak of.\n\nYou might think it sad that all they managed is inferior knock-offs of western computer technology, but when you really stop and think about it, the fact that they could build semi-decent clones of this stuff at all was a major accomplishment in it's own right.\n\nComputer technology requires a LOT of resources to do effectively.\nSo much so that the most critical components are the product of maybe a half dozen factories at most.\nAn earthquake in a single country a decade or so ago, which crippled only one or two factories was enough to cut the global supply of RAM chips by 30%\n\nEast German computers huh.\n\nI guess given those restrictions, if you had the connections and wealth to get a machine imported in the late 80's it seems pretty clear to me you'd want an Amiga;\nSince you weren't allowed to have software... Yeah, that seems like the most impressive thing you could get if you had to make all your own software and tools for it...
Thank you for making a video about this topic. I legitimately had no idea about this, and I find this utterly fascinating. I'm so glad that you still make amazing videos after all this time being subscribed to you. Cheers!
Who are you, Drew Scanlines?
Amazing work George.
Great vid, interesting topic, well made.Liked, subbed and notified
Hey, greetings from Berlin! :-) Nice video!
4:11 *HEEEHEHEHEHEE! MY MAN!*
Man socialism sounds fun.
This is right-wing propaganda!!!!!!
great video
damn starting with mgs3 huh
NOOOOOOOOOOOODDLLEEEEEEEESSSS!!!!
Trending. Nice job George!
#43 on Trending. Nice!
Karl Marx Ave. ah Soviet Union
#37 ON TRENDING BUNNY! CONGRATS!
Woah!! Trending video, congrats!
8:10
GEORGE on TRENDING!?
communism/socialism is cancer
Trending!!!! My boyyyy
Ui, ich wusste nicht, dass Sie deutsch sprechen können!
ICH BIN EINE GAMER!
Living in an Actual Communist Country, I can say a computer/laptop/video game console is worth several months of complete salaries. A desktop computer like 8-14 months, a laptop 3-20 months, VG console 12-13 months
Hmm, at least 100,000 to 1,000,000 Iraqi's killed by our government, over a weapons of mass destruction program that didn't exist....\n\nYeah, I trust that group of thugs to be the exclusive owners of guns.  YOU CAN TRUST THEM...
What part of Shall Not Be Infringed do you not understand?
Unsubscribed. If you hate guns and the second amendment get the fuck out of the country.
We need guns, not all guns kill people, however i do agree they need more regulations but not all guns r bad like u bad, like u said at 3:00 to 3:10 u basically said that all guns r bad, other then that great video
Disarm the cops first. That establishes a conversation.\n\nUntil that happens this is always give even more killing power to the police. No. ∞
I get it, just ban guns.  Self protection and self determination are evil these days anyways. I doesn't matter if it helps, just do something right.
Damn this video is the more bias than CNN
This is why I unsubbed from Cracked. But enjoy the free view.
Yes guns kill people. That's why we don't want the government to have a monopoly in killing people. Governments tend to have a history of turning its guns on its own people even in western nations like Germany.
Wow. Such happily delivered bullshit, I'm almost impressed. Perhaps you might learn a bit more about the subject and... I dunno... The English language?
300 million Americans and over 300 million firearms that we know but the death count is around 40,000 a year for the past 10 years. Yall talk about the gun violence like its 1 to 1 , if so we should all be dead. 13 million children in America have Food Insecurity, lets talk about that problem and leave us gun nuts alone.
Also, the argument that because guns are deadly weapons with no other use, then any other use is illegitimate is child-thinking. Killing is a reality of life, under certain circumstances killing is necessary to guarantee your own safety and integrity, the very reason government agencies carry guns is the same that every day citizens do, it's quite simple if you aren't a sheltered individual. This also is an argument which points to there being no legitimate reason to own a gun other than to murder people, and thus, ALL gun ownership being immoral and thus it should be treated as such . . . but then he says pro-gun advocates are crazy for saying that Democrats want to ban guns, when they are saying shit like this.
Nothing is ever going to happen to guns I think the government should hand out government guns and bullets and blame the state of Alaska where people are literally hunting with guns every day
Cracked is about as much news as The Onion.  Please just stick to Honest Ads seriously.
What in the actual fuck has this channel Come too!!!!!!!! Took a hard fucking left!!!!
For all Americans:  The rest of the world is passing you ideas on how to attempt to fix things and all anyone hears is about how that won't work....how about you come up with your own bloody idea then?  Didn't someone once say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result...what exactly are you waiting for?  the solution you have currently is not working...you don't like our ideas, find your own...or lock your borders and shoot each other
There has to be a compromise between the wild west and the draconian policies of foreign governments.
I'm leftist and love guns but this is irritating
yes, guns are for killing, and when an old person has a home invader, your method would just let them die.........i am wishing ass cancer on you. i have never ever been able to purchase a gun without a background check...been to many gun shows, never seen the loop hole in practice. you are right about the shady deal CA did on the Panthers,  that was pure illegal bullshit.
So per capita in homicide, Chicago is actually way down here...behind all these other cities with high minority populations, high poverty rates, high gun control laws, and Democratic leadership for the last 50 years. Tops on the list: New Orleans, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Oakland.\n\nAre you fucking serious? Can you in any way be more disingenuous to the point being made? Do you know what intellectual honesty and engagement with an argument is, how Chicago is a synecdoche, a useful talisman, not the goddamn argument itself.
NRA money is peanuts.  they aren't even close to the top 10 of lobbyists in america.  its because its a true grass roots organization.  oh yeah and the reason people panic buy is because they worry they won't be able to purchase it.   happens with everything, not just guns.
Until you can get rid of EVERY gun on the planet and stop people from wanting to murder others, there's no real effective measure ...
If you dont want guns to be regulated, maybe its because you are an asshole willing to shoot other people deep inside your conscious too.
You are literally the only reason I don’t wana do away with abortion
Money money money. \nMust be funny. \nIn a rich man's world.
Is it just me or is the lighting different this episode?
Yep Im going to say it, I would rather live in a world where there are mass shootings than ultimately be a subject in someones dictatorship.\n\nIts not the best tool but a gun is blind to corruption, its up to the people to know when and how to use it for the better of our collective freedoms.
F*ck this country. I'm done. The experiment failed. Thanks Cracked for showing this place is one running racist stupid insensitive joke.
We shouldn't let this distract us.  The most pressing issue we have is that we need to stop giving control over our nuclear arsenal to liars, psychopaths, and the mentally ill (I think that covers most of our presidents)
This is one of the best videos on YouTube. I've rewatched it a ton and shared it. Ignore the right wing people in comments Cracked, keep it up!
#NRAhaveuglyshriveleddicks ×××makeithappen××××
Succ my pp
Anybody else getting these shit ads?
My rights are non negotiable . fuck off sheeple
Really tried to listen, stupid.
NRA members are so obsessed with the constitution and their right to bear arms, they'll NEVER change things in ways that could possibly limit gun use. They're idiots and they'll risk innocent lives in order to uphold (and take to logical extremes) their gun rights.
You mention bill clinton is a rapist, what do you think will happen when all gun disappear?
Is this the same Cracked that tries to compete with Mad Magazine?   Well you still don't understand what the purpose of the 2nd amendment is about, when you understand that then we can have a civil discussion about a human right
I am not really a firearm supporter, but I am a weapons collector. I do not think there should be any limitation on what weapons you may have with you, loaded or not, in public. I do however support weapon licenses. In fact I would much prefer a license/merit based system for most potentially dangerous rights.
So, we just need to out-bid the NRA to own a government.
This is kind of a one sided argument this guy is making. Guns are here to stay and always will be. Owning a gun shouldn't place you in a category in which you are called a crazy person nor should someone who doesn't support gun rights be catagorized as a b****. Owning a firearm is not wrong. The constitution makes it very clear that a citizen has the right to own arms. The Vegas shooting and all other gun related incidents and mass shootings are real tragedies but putting the blame on a object and not the person is not the way to deal with a problem. The average person or the average Joe who owns a firearm does not have the intent of committing crimes with the firearm. For what ever reason a person wants to own a firearm. If they are able to and legally doing so then it is there right to own a firearm
Man Cody that smug asshole Marxism mentality will get trump elected again in 2020. Keep up the great work prick
The shots at Steven Crowder are pretty unfair. I'm willing to say that Crowder's investigation could be somewhat inconclusive, but to claim he's lying to everyone and then using an isolated incident to as your only evidence, without giving any extra context or sources just makes you look like a fucking propaganda machine. If you are going to call someone out, do it the right way. Not only that but it appears there is a gross misunderstanding of Crowder's footage as Cracked specifically pulled clips from the more over the top scenes. There are plenty of other scenes where Crowder is not acting suspicious. I want to give Cracked the benefit of the doubt, but no solid evidence is really given because we don't have most of the sources, we just have their word.
Lack of gun control is definitely impacting tourism. I for one am never going to visit the US until people stop carrying weapons.
Was great till the race thing.. Then it was racist.
i honestly can't think of any way you'd convince gun owners to give up or even just regulate their precious, precious guns. doesn't matter how many people get murdered with them. anything that could possibly interfere with buying another sweetass firearm is too much, regardless of other people dying--they're just simply too selfish to give a damn.
Ok let's talk about gun control. Cars kill 10x more people yet more people want them. Why? It's it because it's useful tool? Now I don't go tell driving because it's dangerous and you have a chance of killing someone 10x more than guns. Also you say guns only kill. I'm sorry about what about sports shooting? Also let's look at NJ and CA, they are strict gun control states that also seems to have high gun crime for how strict the laws are. The best I have to say is it's a civil right. There should be no limitations as it states  shall not be infringed. The debate on if modern firearms count is stupid, they understood the concept of advancement in technology (they saw a musket go to a 15 round air rifle that could kill deer size animals). Lastly a quote that should mean something to everyone:  Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety. -Benjamin Franklin. So give up your rights, I'm not without a fight because without rights man cannot be free.
facts matter...and we need to be honest about them\n\nKill yourself.
Finally an American who gets it... great video
I think Trump may have been making light of a shitty situation. This vid is such nonsense I started rebutting things but thought I may get carpel tunnel.
I own guns to protect MY family. You call people with guns to come protect you...one way is immediate, and one way is slow.PEOPLE WITH GUNS SHOWED UP TO STOP A PERSON WITH A GUN IN VEGAS!! When you have a way to stop ALL people from killing in any way, call me (so how many people were killed when McVeigh used a truck and fertilizer, and not a gun?) . Its a mental issue problem, not a chosen method problem. If you wave your magic pen and make ALL guns in the U.S. disappear, you can bet your anything-you-want they will come right across the border. Drugs are illegal, kids. That fixed the drug problem and didn't make cartels rich and powerful, huh? Hey, sarcasm IS fun! Thanks, cracked, but I think I'll keep my tools of life protection!
If cops didn't have guns, the criminals woudn't need them!!!!
So guns are tools that can kill people. Congrats you only started the obvious but saying that we need regulations to stop mass shooting will not in fact stop a mass shooting. You can try and regulate or even straight out ban guns but what does it do besides put citizens who want to protect themselves or their families in a tough spot. Another thing is that you perpetuate the gun show loophole and say criminals can get their guns without background checks... Accept that's not what happens. It's already against state and federal law for license fire arms dealers to sell guns without checking the person first. What about private sales... Not many people have to get checked for that... Then in that case it is the individuals at fault not the tools. A little side note criminals don't necessarily need to buy guns from the gun show. They can make their own or steal from others. Your emotions show a lot in this videos and while feeling are necessary for life don't let you feelings misconstrue facts. Suicides is another thing you bring up, and yeah I agree with a gun they are more likely to kill themselves with a gun. However there are multiple weapons to kill oneself if not ways. The shooter was a coward and so are the majority of you for using that massacre to up your political agenda gun regulations and gun bans, because even in the end it's not gonna change a thing. You can regulate the gun or even flat out ban it. Criminals will find a way to do what they want even if it means taking the lives of some if not many.
The willful ignorance of some of these comments...is just...incredible. Like, did you even WATCH the video🤔
Ban hand guns and semi-auto rifles. That alone will significantly decrease shootings. Enact a 5 year program where you can turn in those weapons. It would take time but it would help a lot in the long run.\n\nBolt action, lever action, double barrel, and single shot long guns (in other words shotguns and rifles) are the only ones that civilians should have access to. Also limit magazine capacities to no more than 10 rounds.
replace fire arms with zappers, and made fire arm illegal unless you are in an army. then. get better police. star to make trials to those politics that get money for corporations, they got a salary for avoid that.
to everyone who is for gun control and hysterically calls trump a Nazi in the same breath, do you really want the government to exclusively have the rights to guns? let me pharse that differently in case you don't understand; do you really want Nazis to exclusively have the rights to guns? you are aware of how that ends historically right?
This isn't an discussion it is a political stance being presented in a un-nuanced and emotional argument.  This is fine, but the article is about why we keep putting off the discussion.  The reason we keep putting off the discussion is because people on both sides are so entrenched that they talk about gun like this.  And you can't have conversations when people talk like this.  So to answer the question in the title, Why do we constantly avoid talking about gun control because people to discuss things they want to make their point.  Perhaps this article should be Why don't people agree with me yet about gun control.\n\nTo pretend it isn't a complicated issue denies the fact about how divisive it its.  Of course if all you want it likes from like minded people go ahead and make a video about people who disagree with you.
wow, you sound so scared...man up, buy a gun
I love you guys but y’all have a serious diversity problem....
if the some prime figure who stands for no gun control got shot.that would be game changer. and ironic.
Meanwhile your USA army drops bombs on civilians and hospitals, killing many innocents. Whoops, mistake is what you read in the media and you take it for granted and never speak your mouth about that. It's just the middle east right, not our people and kids who died, plus it was Obama at the top. You can't of course critize black presidents, that's racist right. Bunch of liberal hypocrits.
This show is the best thing on Cracked (after After Hours).
Ya know, it's too bad that the Vegas shooter was in a gun free zone, because maybe if some responsible gun owners were around for that, there could have been less casualties. But hey, just wait for the cops to save you. 73 minute response time perfectly acceptable..
This is wrong on just about ever substantive point; the rebuttals of pro-gun arguments (some of which themselves are weak) are flaccid.\n\nso you want to ban guns? - um, yes, that's the obvious extension of your logic. And gun control advocates are on record as saying as much.\n\nOn regulated - yes, and if you knew how to read, you'd know that refers to the militia, not the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nOn knives, and the many other purposes - guns also have many other purposes. Lots of people hunt, shoot clays, participate in competitions, and other things. And let's not forget that sometimes, killing is an unfortunate necessity. Oh, and let's not forget, there are plenty of cases of knife attacks, including a major attack in China in 2014 that killed 31 people (not including the perpetrators) and injured 143 others (which is to say, the use from the 32nd floor bit is retarded).\n\nOn doing things that don't involve guns - again, this dismisses the fact that there are lots of legitimate uses of guns. Not to mention illustrative of your general hoplophobia. Or your willingness to sacrifice your rights when they have no bearing on your personal life (which is to say, you're being a selfish twat). \n\nPeople with guns frequently use guns to shoot people with guns - um, no. There are 300 million guns in the US owned by a fairly sizeable chunk of the population. The percentage of gun owners who commit murder with guns is vanishingly small. Talk about skewing facts to avoid truths.\n\nOn the gun show loophole - this is a misnomer. It's not gun shows that are the problem, but private party sales. Gun shows are by law gun stores, which means background checks are required for any sale on the premises. That doesn't mean, however, that you as a private individual can't meet another private individual at a gun store, then go make the purchase off the premises. For the record, Crowder is a moron, and universal background checks are one piece of gun control I agree with. But you'd get a lot further if you didn't use easily deflected language to describe the issue.\n\nMurders and suicides are completely different in almost every way, and the two problems are not solved the same way. In fact, murder isn't even a homogeneous category - gang-related murder is not the same problem as domestic murders, and again, won't be solved the same way. And on suicide specifically, there's really no evidence that stronger gun control will have an effect. Yes, there is the example in Britain with the changeover from coal gas to natural gas, but more relevantly, Canada experienced no change in the suicide rate when they enacted stronger gun control laws. Yes, suicide by gun went down, but it was simply replaced by other methods.
I am all for gun confiscation. Just pass a law where all the beta cuck liberals and tough talking cat ladies on Faceberg go door to door confiscating them. That sounds great. You don't have a right to a car. And no - the majority of gun owners do not want more gun laws. That's a lie. That's like saying dope fiends want more drug laws and the police to screw with them even more. There is Gun Show Loophole. Those are called private transactions.
There is ample gun control, nobody enforces it. Get the government to do their job. The firearms are already here, so more regulation takes rights from law abiding citizens. Don't forget when they pass a bill, they also sneak in other things and that is what concerns me. Bump stocks in my opinion gimmicky so I don't care either way. So regulating or banning them is fine nothing else. A highly trained person with a single shot bolt action could have just as much damage unfortunately
So many people here are crying and complaining about guns in US. There are far more shootings in the EU! This is both in terms of frequency and annual death rate from shootings. They also last longer in EU. Most Shootings in the US last 5 minutes. In the EU they sometimes last for days. People in the EU are disarmed and more over, the police in EU don't have the proper tools once arriving on scene. The often flee cause they are overpowered. Not only can't the public protect themselves, the police in EU can't protect themselves. People call the shooting in Las Vegas that biggest mass shooting in modern American history with 59 people dead. But, in EU, shootings with hundreds of people dead is actually not uncommon, and EU is even smaller than the US! Why is it that when something in the US happens, the whole world will talk and hear about it in the media for long periods. When something happens elsewhere the media doesn't pay much attention to it! My Chinese girlfriend tells me often about hundreds, sometimes thousands of people, either killed or abducted in China. Why don't we here about that in the media. The Whole world is heavily controlled by media propaganda, including the US. Anybody who talks trash about the US has either never been here or maybe they only traveled to High Crime cities like Chicago, Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles and so on. These little hives and nests are not the whole of the US!!! I lived 20 years in Europe, in many different countries. I lived in China for 3 years. I now live in Colorado US and I have never been happier or safer than now.

I'm good with more gun control or limiting weapons to handguns, shotguns and small mag rifles.  \n\nI'm not good with Comedy Channels forcibly debating their opinions down people's throat and not properly titling their video so I can avoid it.   \n\nRight wing, left wing, liberal or conservative I don't care what you have to say.  Just go fight with each other on some properly titled political debate forum and leave your opinions out of media.
The magical  something bannr was a nice touch
is defense an argument?
What's it going to take?  Well I know what this guys gonna take...a big dick in his asshole because he's a sissy bottom fag that likes to be subjegated. I'm a hard hitting top because I like taking care of business and also like to be able to defend myself if/when something bad happens. Keep being a bottom sissy fag and bad shit will continue to happen.
yes, guns were invented to kill people. some of us don't want to be at the mercy of mobs which may or may not include governments. this is a classic example of how leftists only think in terms of solutions instead of what is actually possible in the reality place where all of us actually live.
All discussion leads to the same effect.  Infringing on rights, be it right to arms or right to privacy. Rehashing the terms Common Sense and join the discussion is collectivist, statist lingo and is part is why there are already so many over reaches on the fourth and second amendment in the country.  Its for the good of society! we hear, like in this video, but there actually isn't any evidence to support that claim one way or the other.  \n\nIf that is the case, loose opinions on effectiveness in either direction I'm going to side with individual freedoms in opposition of the mob.
I was right there with Cracked for once until I heard the spin about Cop on Black violence and how...Left out certain information was. Like how cops are more likely to kill white people than black people, or how black people kill more black people than cops kill black people. But its cool, we can pick out certain information and make it sound like theirs a problem when there isn't.
0:34 Tool invented for murder.\n\nThat's how far I made it. Calling a firearm a 'tool invented for murder' puts your ignorance on such fantastic display as to disqualify you from commenting further without being laughed at by anyone who actually knows what the fuck they are talking about. Remember to recycle, donate to your local charities, and shut the fuck up about things you know nothing about unless you want to look like a fool.
I know that this is cracked, and that it is a humor site, but if you stop throwing jokes into a topic like this, I might be able to take you seriously.
I have a 9mm and an AR 15 and I am a veteran. Guns are used for killing ppl. Target practice is fun. Although I have never taken mine to a range as a civilian, i get it. But guns are for killing. I learned how to fire my weapons at human shaped targets bcuz blood makes the grass grow  Bcuz..... they are used and made to kill
Well, to everyone saying glad I don't live in the US living in constant fear of being shot it's really not bad. I have never been afraid of getting shot by some random person and I live in a place where 4/5 cars have a gun in them. Hell, people carry weapons daily, there are 3 gun shops within a block of each other, and even the wal-mart sells guns! It's not the wild west, there aren't shootouts going on. The biggest issues are the drugs tbh, and those are illegal too so idk
Want to have an honest conversation? Start by being honest yourself.\n\nThere is no gun show loophole, or online loophole (not mentioned in the video). If you buy a gun from a dealer, you need a background check, even at gun shows. If you buy a gun online, it's shipped to a dealer so you can do a background check. Most states do not require background checks for private purchases. If your buddy sells you a gun or you want to buy a gun from someone you met on a local forum (and will meet face-to-face for the purchase) you don't need a background check. It doesn't matter if you're at your house, a Walmart parking lot, or a gun show. A private transaction is a private transaction.\n\nThe CDC is not barred from researching gun violence. They can't use federal funds to push for gun control. That was done because there were people in the CDC with an agenda that outright said they would do as many studies as they needed to find the evidence that proved their point about gun violence. That's not how research works. You find data and draw a conclusion, not start with a conclusion and find data to fit.\n\nThe NRA isn't even near the top of organizations that donate money to legislators. They win because gun owners go out to vote.\n\nPer the video, there is no correlation between guns and murders, but there is a correlation between guns and gun deaths. No shit. Just like places with more cars have more car deaths, or more pools means more pool deaths. It's just statistics. If you want to reduce deaths without taking guns away you need to be productive: safety education, mental health (to prevent suicide), so many other things like universal healthcare, a good education, a living wage.\n\nThere are dozens of countries with a higher suicide rate than the US. Guns aren't the only factor and taking them away from people that don't want to kill themselves or others won't fix it.\n\nRealistically, what will it take to limit guns in the US? If nothing happened after Sandy Hook or Vegas, nothing will happen. It would take huge political effort to amend the constitution and get tens of millions, potentially over a hundred million Americans to give up. And for what? There are hundreds of millions of guns in the US. More are manufactured to equip police and military around the world. Law-abiding citizens may give up their guns but criminals will keep theirs. Legal guns become undocumented.
Planned Parenthood gives about 10 times the amount of money to Democrats every year that the NRA has given in the past several decades. Do organizations with private agendas donating vast sums of money to influence politics bother you or is it only a problem when they lobby for something you disagree with?
For all those citing Australian and U.K gun laws as an example for the U.S to follow, you have to provide a 'Genuine Reason/Good Reason' for a Firearms Licence. Self defence is *NOT* considered a 'Genuine Reason/Good Reason'...
I immediately stopped watching the video the second this dipstick condescendingly said, Oh so now you wanna ban guns? to even the mere words gun control even though regulated is in the Constitution in the part that's called the 2nd Amendment.\n\nThe words are, A well regulated *militia*..., which refers to a member of the militia, NOT a firearm. It's this kind of intentional twisting of words to make a straw-man argument that makes it so frustrating to have a reasonable discussion with people who want gun control.\nFor clarification, the first part of that sentence states the need for the State to draw from the populace an armed and orderly fighting force (regulated) under a command structure (the State). The second part of the sentence makes it clear that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon an American citizen, which is what a militia is created from (not to be confused with a standing army).\n\n\nIf people like this can't be honest about their arguments, how can we trust they'd be any better about finding an honest solution?
No that's not Capitalism - That is Curruption !!
*sigh* :(
All Bolshevik Propaganda Lies!

“Also Dre” 😂😂
Great video
Australia did not had constitutional right to own guns. Mandatory buyback would start civil war. And also 80+ people were killed in France using a fucking TRUCK. Lets ban trucks
If my ancestors in Europe had guns then they would not have been Holocausted
Congress can start with banning the sale of bump stocks and high cap magazines... \nI'll bet nothing happens... \nagain...
Mass shootings make me uncomfortable about going out in public.  So I bought a gun.  Multiple guns.  I feel better now.  I encourage you to do the same.
The NRA and RNC both ban guns from their conventions. Why aren't gun owners first attacking them for banning guns instead of attacking people advocating for gun regulation (non-ban) discussions?
Fuck you! This shooting was done by the deep state to push gun control! How about some outrage over people we pay taxes to to protect us, who are going out gunning us down to push for take our freedoms?
fact: he was on psyche drugs, like ALL mass shooters last 30 years...dumbass!
Correction - Cars drive and kill. Guns protect and kill.... to say the only use of a weapon is to murder, you're severely off base.
Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. How has that worked out for them?
Can someone honestly and seriously explain to me what the FUCK the CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL has to do with GUNS?! I mean, call me crazy, but I always foolishly assumed that the Centre for Disease Control dealt with such things as DISEASES: outbreaks, mutations, treatments, developing inoculations (which apparently a large percentage of you won't even use anyway because you're so fucking stupid you think that it's safer to not take the chance your kid might somehow spontaneously develop autism as a side effect of vaccination, instead of ensuring they have a LIFETIME PREVENTATIVE from contracting a highly contagious and DEADLY disease. Smallpox may not be the danger it was 150 years ago, but it hasn't ACTUALLY been eradicated and cases are still reported regularly in countries such as Africa.... but that's a whole other rant for another day 😁). \n\nBack to my initial question: as much as the American gun obsession has been referred to as a disease, IT ISN'T ACTUALLY A REAL DISEASE. You won't be bitten by some kind of radioactive spider or tick or mosquito, or be exposed to gamma radiated germs whenever someone sneezes, which will cause you to spontaneously decide guns are awesome, I must have more guns, I must have all the guns, I need bigger guns that can fire more bullets, dear god, someone give me more guns. So WHY in the name of all that is... well, not a bunch of hypocritical selfish fucking bastards, would a DISEASE authority being doing research into the safety of guns?!?! \n\nSincerely, \nA very confused Australian who was a teenager at the time of Martin Bryant's Port Arthur Massacre (world record holder for a decade, Aussie Aussie Aussie) and who was inordinately proud of her country for standing up and saying, take these guns away and make sure this never happens again and the Government DID (John Howard will be immortalised in Australian history none of us will ever actually read forever for this one decision), who was also HORRIFIED when the Columbine High School Shooting happened, and NOTHING IN YOUR COUNTRY FUCKING CHANGED. Aussie guy, injures and/or kills men, women, children, teens, tweens, grandparents, etc, whole country rewrites its gun laws. Teenagers shoot up a high school, killing and/or injuring mostly teens and some adults, and the best that happens is a guy makes an award winning documentary about it which is derided by the very people it's trying to help. \n\nSeriously, I just don't understand. What's wrong with you? Why do you care so little for your own countrymen? How can you be so selfishly callous? \n\nBut more pertinently, what the FUCK does the CDC have to do with GUNS?!?!?!?
USA, Ofcourse

Fake and gay, just like the whole Vegas hoax (but Dan managed to make it even fake and gayer)

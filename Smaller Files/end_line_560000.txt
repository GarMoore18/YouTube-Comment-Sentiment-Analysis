Stupid fevking idiot thinks he's a hero .. Look at me Iam getting there
To bad this waste of skin never got shot
I could've been the 4,500th thumb up...instead I chose to be the 19,260th thumb down.
If they have turned on the lights on the hotel rooms maybe that would have cause poor 7 vision
The like to dislike ration reminds me of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare
it's a shame this useless piece of crap did not get shot that day. what a fucking shit-stain self-absorbed trust fund baby publicity whore. fuck you for the cunt you are
hahahhahahhahahhahhahahhahhahahhahahhahahhahhahahhahhahhahahhahhahahhahaha. I love idiots!! Even during an event as horrible as this they still give me a good laugh. I don't even know you hahahhahahhahahahha
hey Dan if you see this fuck you you pantywaist dumbass piece of shit. A child would know to go provide first aid instead of trying to bum a weapon off of an officer. you should be arrested for interfering with police business clownass
That's not running tword the shooter, that's cover and concealment.
This.... This here in 55 seconds is everything wrong with American gun culture. A nutjob with an arsenal many African warlords would be envious of, and a narcissistic nutjob who thinks the best way to combat it is with more guns and to just go in blazing.
If only the gunman aimed closer to him
O    M   G !!! Thank God Dan was there ..  a lot of people has been saved all because this super heroe was at the good place in the perfect time!! Thank God he had a camera too!
He's a cunt
he's an attention whore. c'mon there's a guy filming him. he thought this will be a great way to get attention
Wanna be.. That's all he is. Coward who runs away instead of helping others.
I have no issue with Dan Bilzerian, but why the fuck would he put this video out? He gets a strip torn off him by a cop and only looks like an asshole here.
well he stayed well away from the field of fire and never got to close. who did he put up to filming him? that cop sure put him in his place, lol.
Everyone wants to be a hero these days
If I could to dislike this video again, I'd do that right now!
Officer - you know better.\nWhelps!! I dont think Dan does tbh.
As far as I'm concerned the cop who REFUSED to give the douche bag a gun is the HERO!!!!!!  The only method this dude Dan has is trying to get himself noticed even while in the midst of tragedy .... still trying to promote himself.  All you virgins find yourself another hero.
This idiot is lucky he was not charged for interfering with police duties. He was probably drunk or high and should be ashamed.
We can all agree that the shooter was a funkien dumb cunt
He went through seal training twice
In all honesty what the fuck is he going do?
What a ball bag
It doesn't matter how much money you got, a douchebag is still a fucking douchebag lol
This guy is a good example of a dumbfuck
This guy seems more like a Brad or some douche bag kind of name like that, you know
Our policy is not to run ads on videos about tragedies
He did nothing, he can live doing and spending money however he wants, but in the end he, just like the rest of us is nothing and will return to nothing. Don't let the antics of individual retards like this guy get to you.
Ha what a tool
the hero we need, not the one we deserve
So is the camera man
hes a fucking retard he saw what was going on and thought it was a good opportunity to make a video in which he thought would make him seem like a hero or something ffs cunt kys
Lol, I don't know who the fuck you are. You douchebag, let them do their job you attention seeking bitch
What a douche tool. I wish the cop would have pistol whipped the wanker.
And what exactly was his plan, give me a gun I'm sure I can aim for the guy high up in the hotel? Fucking dumbass, I laughed when the police screamed at him and said I don't give a fuck who you are 😂
Whys does money make someone so fckn self righteous. I bet this guy thinks his shit doesn’t stink.
These guys are legends. Risking there life for a vid
Dan bilzarian hides behind a jersey barrier like a faggot and tries to snuggle with a cop would have been a more accurate title.....#fake terror
Fuck Dan blizarian
What an idiot... sweet creds bruh
Coyote Peterson
Fucking idiot
Faker than Pam Anderson's tits
achieved zero
lmao
Fkn pathetic cunt
The ting goes skrrrr
Aye fuk this guy aye
my favorite dc hero
Haters gonna hate.
Publicity stunt piece of shit
_My dad has diabetes_
What an absolute dickhead
Twat.
What a wanker!
The cop should of given him the gun, i mean it's Dan Bilzarian after all!
zane wilson with sexy beast says words is better check it out here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjE6lABNJPw
Dan bilzerian knows two things, guns and women
What an absolute fucking hero.
https://youtu.be/eQSbkBla0mw
look at this \nhttp://yobuilder.com/2M7l
*Dan is a reserve police officer*, he showed the cop his ID but the cop was panicking and didn't want to read it (fair enough). \n\nDan also has 510 days of NAVY SEAL training. Just the fact that he ran towards the gun fire looking to help out and put his life on the line, shows he had good intentions (would you be brave enough to do the same?)\n Probably helped calm people by telling them if they hear a crack then the bullet is close. Stop hating.
So sick!
how is this trending it only has 14k views, youtube is rigged
Hey man! I'm a small filmmaker that really wanna share my content. I would really appreciate, if you guys could give me a chance, and check my channel out. I hate promoting, but I stand 100% by my content, and spend a lot of time on it. I hope some of you would give me a chance :-)
The motion capture scene 1:20 of this video seems to have been corrected. \nI have a Sony Mirrorless camera. But it does not get the same neat motion capture effect as this video.\n I think he used masking editing.  So I put this on my channel.\n I hope you can watch and review.
Hey, guys! I have a new travel video I hope you guys would check it out. Thank you https://youtu.be/Ve7_P38jbDc
I also live in wine country.
heck yes!! some sick shots with the go pros
this was just top shelf stuff. that hero 6 in the gimbal was rock solid and looked great
I daydreamed through this whole video.  What'd I miss?
0:39 think gopros cheating us a little on the capabilities of its slow mo look at the front wheel looks like they are using a time warp style plugin in post to generate that slowmo. Either that or YouTube's player is getting shitter and shitter by the day.
I have two GoPro hero 5....been trying to get a microphone for it...for interning someone for my channel...what would you recommend for me to get?

Does'nt his rap music make him enough money?! 😅 artist name patchy
weird morphing frame to frame in first jump...which gopro was used? Not Hero4K obviously, or why is there no 4k playback?
I hate how you guys removed slow motion editing from your software. I have to buy from somewhere now. Ughhh why did I get the hero 6
i have good videos i just need a shoutout https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mqz-h2EgIXcCMs1y0c7Sg
I have a hero5 but i don't know how to do the thing at 1:19
some blockiness in some parts, pretty good for such a tiny camera though
Man, those big airs 1:22 are mesmerizing. Can seriously watch those over and over.
Go pro hero 6 is just godlike no other way of explaining it

all cool but the avverrage gopro user doesnt have a drone for all thkse sick shots. You should do a tutorial on how to make the best video with your gopro by yourself
Wahhhhh is it made by the hero 6 or fusion it so bieutiful 😍😍😍😍
Any small time youtubers care to support each other? Comment if interested
Hello from Reunion Island. Nice video
someone make video better to go pro ? I dont think
Meeehhh.. \n\n\nHold my beer. \n\n\n\n\nI can't do that!
compared to release videos of hero 5 and 6 quality of this one is very bad. Oversharpened and full of moire and false detail. Did they not use protune ? why is it ? quality looks imo as hero 3 or hero3+ at max. @gopro #gopro please explain.
Nate has so many backflips under his belt he’s got it mastered!
For the idiots who think that the slo-mo clip at 0:39 is native to the camera, you guys are wrong. You can obviously see that Twixtor (or another similar effect) has been used
The new Trials game looks pretty good.
Best part was the slow motion in the air
Are GoPros image really that clean?
Nice. What editing software used?
Well sick!
Espectacular como todos !!!

Another amazing song by these 2.
Why the dislikes? This is amazing!
What a song and video it just reminds me of my parents who would have been married for 59 years, I lost my mother this past august, 7, She was a 26 year breast canacer survior two years ago they removed a her left breast,  but nothing else, This past April it spread to her Brain and lungs, My parents used to dance in the living room, while they would listen to old country, and plus your music as well thank you for this beautiful video <3
This is the first time I heard this song so damn good sooths the soul calms the heart and mind my all time favorite country singer Tim McGraw. Love your music
They are such an amazing couple.... they are so sincere.... so loving...so compassionate when they look at each other. They are the best country music couple. I have all of their music and even the Barbie dolls. They are the best
How I love this song!
These two are so beautiful together:) After 17 years with my sweetheart, we still look at each other the same way as they do. We'll grow old together, and when one passes, the other probably will soon after from a broken heart. He is my best friend, my everything. My true love
4 and a half years ago, I wasn't sure about The rest of my life?? https://youtu.be/CodlS_NDKXA\nThank you for the song.\nGod bless
What's with these country singers ? Loving their wives too much... Tim McGraw , Thomas Rhett etc..is it all real ?
Faith's voice sounds way better in this song than in Speak to a Girl, but Tim sounds weird at the end. And can def. tell Ed Sheeran co wrote this
Beautiful song and beautiful video😄😄😄.Lol
I love the song, the video.. I don't know why they have to be angry all the time..  <wink wink> But I love the song. I can't wait to hear the rest of the album. Thank you Faith and Tim!

Did Faith say her son will be named Ride or Rye?
This is sick, rich un-connected....I am wondering where my next meal is coming from and you....one gray hair....you are too rich for me to associate anything with you...including this horrible song.
That's one dysfunctional relationship
Now THAT'S the kind of love I'd like to find!    ....maybe someday.....
Two beautiful people that makes good music 💕and I enjoy the passion that they have for each other.

Faith Evans aging like a fine Wine...... and id be fine to if my husband was Tim McGraw
Ok - I need to tell my husband to sing to me like that when he walks into a restaurant even with our screaming kids and embarrassed teenager. That was amazing.
Country music is pretty good, country people are dumbshits that cant get their heads out of their own ass to understand how the world works, trapped in their own small town backward world.
Is...is that a formal cowboy hat?
I just love this couple....
Happy 21st Wedding Anniversary, look for their upcoming Showtime special
Check out my piano cover of this song! Thanks!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGzW1p4Rt9Y
I want a love like this..😔
She just needed a walk in the rain
Pure magic for sure....I pray for them that with the Lord's help they will continue to be strong in their marriage !!!  Reminds me of my own marriage of 29 years to a long blonde headed country girl with pretty blue eyes...only the Lord gives this gift !!!
Love this song ! I\nAlways love watching true love ;) This is magic
Love their harmony, love the song.
I love this so much.they are so perfect together.
This will be played at tons of weddings.
Perfect example what God intended marriage to be. Smart , beautiful couple , who knows money n fame is not everything.
This is such a lovely song💕💕
Best country couple,, king & queen of country music
If real men still existed.
Holy shit Tim McGraw with the high notes in this song!! Absolutely amazing and I haven't seen him do that often. So good
REAL TALK: Why does Tim sound totally different??
They are literally goals for life! ❤️

I want to suck your toes Kate
Am I the only one who's embarrassed of having a foot fetish? 😔
0:06 Man, that's a huge housefly! Someone's getting a reprimand!
“You know how I feel about feet!” “Bunion” - Junior Soprano
I absolutely love feet too and I think it's a great when celebs come out about there foot fetish.
Idris is black so that makes him cool... White people in these comment are so funny!
Kate looks beautiful and she never really ages! amazing! Also, who else noticed she had Invisalign?
Stacker pentacost has a print of every kaiju's feet in his office and now we know why
This is trending but Liam Gallagher isn't?
Chris looks like a little boy lol
Omg I just watched Ryan does something every week his videos are hilarious check him out and share
This man is perfection
Theres a FLY on the wine glass at the start of the clip!!!! Did Graham drink from this glass later on?!?!?!
'I can't wait to see this movie' LOL
In the comment section: foot folk.
just watched their movie , I am yet to recover from that love scene where Ben(Idris) sweeps Alex(Kate) off her feet to bring her to bed, so perfectly savage
Now I'm picturing Idris doing things to my feet.....
0:06 There is a giant fly getting drunk off of Graham Norton's drink just over his left shoulder.
I to have a foot fetish ha
Well.. Idris Elba is younger than Chris Rock..
Poor old Idris clearly nervous about  the sex scene and promoting this movie, Kate bailed him out with a story about a foot fetish
Stringer Bell does it again. \nIdris is the coolest.
Idris is a foot guy - YUP we're meant to be ;) LERVE Kate Winslet and Chris Rock!!
Am the only one around here who noticed the fly in Graham's wine?
The non-verbal communication between Idris and Kate is interesting... she grabs his hand and he does pull away...
I've just done films with a lot of guys.\nTHAT'S NO EXCUSE!\nOkie dokie, that's beautiful.
Love Kate and Idris. Not being nasty but Kate looks so tired eyes here, prob jet lagged! Wondering why she chose those tights too.... sorry Kate but you look silly in those tights. Idris is a dish 😍🤣
''Hi Guys I'm Karlie Kloss and I've just create-----A WEBSITE?? YES!! WE KNOW!! WE ALL KNOW!!! CONGRATULATONS!!!!  WOW!! GO YOU !! CREATING A WEBSITE?? WHATEVER NEXT!!
i really don't why there are fly's in the studio 0:08 graham's glass ...
I thought that was madonna
Has Winslet done surgeries on her face? I didn't recognize her to begin with!
Idris please be my second husband!!😂
Can you imagine Chris Rock is 7 years older than Idris Elba
Chris Rock is looking good.
that's Kate Winslet?   I was thinking, damn, Emma Thompson looks GOOD!
*Movie guy voice* Chris Rock, Idris Elba in: Brokeblack Mountain.
Bet he dose you know how them black men get around white women
I keep forgetting that Kate is British, she's so good at doing an American accent.
I was smiling and giggling the whole time but the last two lines had me in splits
katie really needs some botox under the eyes
I love Idris. Can't wait for more Luther
I love how idris took his hand back reallll quick 😂😂😂😂
Why is Chris Rock naked?
109 thumbs down. Why? No, wait, I don't know why. You can keep it to your self.
Kate looks incredible in those fishnets. Wow...
He's hot

Idris 💙
I thought i was the only one with a foot fetish
I would never have guessed that Chris is older than Idris.
im so glad luther is returning for season 5
The guy literally directed a short for Sky which was centred around a woman and her love of shoes because he likes feet that much. The signs are all there haha
Idris I want your baby
If you don't know what Chris Rock meant by 'Hammertime' watch this and all will be revealed https://youtu.be/NP7_SIRfo-c
I think Kate Winslet is a bit of diva.
You can tell Idris can't stand Kate and to tell her to keep her socks on really shows the lack of chemistry considering he loves nice feet. From how bossy Kate is I can tell why he doesn't like her.
i dunno...still think Idris is faking that accent...
There's a fly in Graham Norton's wine glass at 0.07
Idris: I've done a lot of films where there are a lot of guys.\nChris Rock: That's no excuse.  \n\nSmart and funny - LOL!
Idris is my boy and Kate looks great. Chris is the one true rock.
there´s a fly on Graham´s glass
0:34 same Chris. Same.
BLACKED
I do too
Ok I already liked Elba as an actor, but I just noticed his hand tattoo I totally didn't know he had, just hours after I got my hand tattoo aaand he just admitted havin a foot fetish, which I also have, on national tv looking cool as hell, Elba just turned into one of my fav celebrities lol
I love Kate's hair!!!!
Did anyone else search Kate Winslet feet before the video even finished playing?
He's going to get so many feet pics slid into his dm
I can not say  it often enough - I LOVE  Idris
These 3 had brilliant chemistry together
Guys, he's only human
Kate winslet mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

well. if idris has a foot fetish, i guess now i have a foot fetish
I respect Idris Alba even more now..\nUs feet lovers have to stick together lol
Having a foot fetish is no longer creepy now a famous rich black man likes feet
Was i the only one grossed out? xD
Guest: I like to keep myself clean, head to toe, you know.\nGraham Nortons YT channel: GUEST HAS A FOOT FETISH
Ewww nasty
Foot fetish is gross
I hate feet
I bet he has another foot in his trousers.
I hate Idris Elba ever since he came on the office. He's not even a popular actor and has failed in all his mainstream movies.
Why hasn't Idris done many love scenes?\n\nPerhaps because he's black and and the only people who want to watch negro and white woman get intimate are degenerate SJWs and Jews.
Always thought there was something wrong with that coon
Foot fetishes are disgusting. FEET ARE DISGUSTING!
What a shit referee. Is he Scottish?
Кто то поставил хату букмеккерам на то, что в матче не будет пенки
Loved the video, would love to connect!
Not complaining when such officiation leads to an England world cup win (y)
That's one dodgy referee.  Some pass from the guy though.
In the words of Mr Bean,\n\nmish mish mish mish mish mish mish mish mish
Can anyone translate what he's saying?
Penalty! And another penalty! Oh wait.
If you ever saw a referee that has been bribed, this is one .
What a disgrace!! Kudos to the reporter by making this public with walking away. This referee should be banned for life and heavily fined as a lesson for anyone who dares to take sides while officiating. The match has to be repeated.
this is literally the worst referee EVER
Was the referee a coward (scared) or bribed? The goal keeper clearly committed a foul in the goal area and it was seen by the referee, and it should have been a penalty and the keeper should have been shown the 'Red Card'. This does not look good for the reputation of all match officials.
Судья-пидорас,чоуж.)
Wow! Should be sacked and given an eye test
Don't mind me. just an English comment coming through
Read about this on BBC 😂😂
Fire that referees ass for match fixing
Wow! Fixed or just thick as fuck?
First one was a clear dive by the attacker beside the corner flag. Second the defender clearly kicks the ball away. I see no issues here.
Calm down dear, its a bloody football match!!!
It's pretty clear that the referee has given the free kick for the goalkeeper handling the ball outside of the penalty area. Whether it should have been a penalty is another matter! As for the subsequent handball - yep - he's missed a sitter.
In communist Russia, you supply commentary.
who's here after bbcnews?
The ref got the decision correct! The free kick is for handball outside the area. There was no penalty as the forward was not fouled. He went down looking for the penalty with minimal contact.
Watch this at .25 speed. The referee was correct not to give a penalty. The attacking player runs into the goalkeeper, not the other way round. The keeper's eyes are on the ball at all times. The attacker is deliberately looking for a penalty and if anything should have been given a yellow card for simulation. The referee gave a free kick for handball to the attacking side but could easily have awarded a free kick to the defending side.
The free kick was given for goalkeeper handball outside of the box, NOT the foul in the box.\nHowever I cannot see explanation for the second handball from the free kick not being given.
Жора Черданцев отдыхает)))...а если серьёзно - это налицо результат работы Фонбетов, Винлайнов, Лиги ставок и прочих многочисленных контор...деньги правят футболом...даже во Владимире (или в Иваново)...и это печально
Ещё бы пенальти ставить в 2017 году!
комментатор идиот!
Лучше хоккей играйте !!!
ههههههههههههه
Очевидно что комментатор под чем-то. Жаль, что эти бесполезные уёбки занимают места, на которых могли бы работать люди, которые хотят комментировать, а не исполнять вот эти цирковые номера. Пенальти на усмотрение судьи. Я видел, что полевой игрок подставился под вратаря, блокируя ему дорогу - такие приёмы разрешены в хоккее, в футболе это трактуется в пользу вратаря. Комментатор - бесталанный уёбок, надеюсь этот мудак не будет больше засирать эфир своими воплями дикобраза, которого только то сняли с самки.
Комментатор истиричка
Почему молчит Российский футбольный совет?!
А теперь самое главное,запомните фамилию этого судьи,МИ-РО-ШНИ-ЧЕН-КО...Верх КОРРУПЦИИ всего судейского корпуса и цинизма....
HHHHHHHHHHHH
ну если первое нарушение сомнительное если честно игрок явно подставлялся ,а вратарь тупо бежал с задратой вверх головой и сбил его тоесть еще можно поспорить,но когда защитник выносит мяч с штрафной ДВУМЯ руками -это жесть судью на мыло!
Ну судья явно работает не только за зарплату...А комментатор прав, чем такое комментировать, лучше другую работу найти. Я бы тоже ушел).
какой нах футбол в раше, готовьтесь к труду и обороне, мля, путлер укажет путь еще на лет 20
порядочный коментатор
Судью надо отправить судить матчи чемпионата мира!
Комментатор просто работает в Торпедо
Ребята, ну вот есть же Шакуров о сборной (полная версия БЕЗ ЦЕНЗУРЫ).\nЗдесь всё сказано. И закрыть нужно эту тему (вместе с футболом естественно).
Not surprised, blatent pen tbf.
Некоторые пишут , что позор комментатору. Если бы не он, то никто бы так и не узнал о таком моменте и полной деквалификации судьи.
что за кривоногие и долбаебы судьи ?
Ну хоть что-то в нашем Владимире происходит
забавно, он сразу на точку указал, а потом поменял решение на штрафной
Комментатор : пресс-атташе ФК Торпедо (Владиир).
обычный договорняк,игрок сыграл руками,сделал это сознательно,про не назначенный пенальти я уже молчу,неужели кто то еще болеет за такое.Одним словом днище
государство не содержит футбольные команды, они принадлежат частникам :) Государство строит только стадионы, которые потом сдает в аренду футбольным клубам, так что налогов граждан РФ в существовании футбольных клубов НЕТ:) В СССР футбольные клубы были на содержании у государства, но вы же захотели профессиональный футбол, вот и кушайте его.
Посмотрел несколько раз — с этого ракурса и расстояния, я не увидел нарушения со стороны вратаря ( при борьбе за мяч ). Штрафной за игру руками — да, можно и карточку было дать. Во втором эпизоде: — он не играл рукой, а закрывался от удара
Бомбонуло у коментатора жостко!
Can anyone please translate?
Я надеюсь судья как минимум уже ничего не судит?
Какая страна такой и футбол
я один заметил что нет болейшиков
bloody hell
Referee should be lynched.  Awful
ты чё тваришшшш
комментатор-огонь!!! он лучший! не то что тухлые с матч тв
Такое ощущение, что даже нарушивший голкипер показывал судье, что там пенка. А потом защ специально руками сыграл, чтобы хоть так пенку дали. Но судья был невозмутим ))
чтоб бля он в аду горел, пидорас  мирошниченко, а его жена в бедности жила и  сосала на хлеб.
Это позор комментатора,что бы не происходило ОН ОБЯЗАН вести себя профессионально, какое не было бы решение, а он повел себя как истеричная тёлка которой что то не понравилось...Надеюсь его уволят...
Доскакались на майдане кацапи .Позор мірошнику.Смерть ворогам
дайте угадаю: Мутко молчит с невинным ебалом.
СУДЬЮ НА КУЙ ИЗ СПОРТА ПОЖИЗНЕННО!
Вратары поймал мячь за переделами своего ринга \n Из за этого судья не дал пеналти  А дуругой игрок зашишал груд
Судью дисквалифицировать. Комментатору- респект. У нас футбол итак то не футбол, а корявая ходьба за мячом, а тут ещё и эти ублюдыши со (свистками) встревают. Хатьфу
В первом случае пенальти не было - игрок видя, что проигрывает эпизод подставился под вратаря.\nА вот во втором случае 100% пенальти.\nКомментатор - истеричка, парень абсолютно не на своем месте
Конечно у комментатора накипело
Долбоебы со своим футболом все носятся
Как и вся Россия. Как и все судьи в судах.
Дырдырову можно судей аскорблять, а комментатору нет?
Когда вот так и Орлов уйдет во время трансляции ?)))
Молодец! Человек с позицией.
Зачем вообще нужен этот футбол? Давно пора киберспортом заниматься.
Мирошниченко пидор заряженный!!!!
ахаха еблан куплен на все 100
Надеюсь, это последний матч этого арбитра в его профессиональной карьере.
Будни параши во всей красе.
Цирк
Это какая лига???
5 ысяч ублей!
чем закончилась матч
Спасибо, ржал в голос xD
Респект коментатору!
у судьи ставка горит)))
Кто выиграл то в итоге?
*2:15
нууу, так то он прав
РУКА!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Это Россия
Komentator je u pravu i ja bi otisao
LOL He is so right. A lot of things have to change in football referees.
комментатор мужик! респект тебе!
Там явных нарушений нет, судья матча виноват лишь в том, что хотел судить как в Премьер лиге. Ахахахаха) Пенальти! Пенальти мать твою. Позор игроку, который лег под вратаря, а во втором, мяч все равно летел в живот, а попал в руки прижатые  к животу. Позор тем кто так отреагировал бурно. Это футбол друзья, и в обоих случаях на усмотрение судьи.
истеричка, очень непрофессионально.
Хуле, кацапстан
ПЕНААААЛЬТИ
Its the most annoying thing when you fell asleep with your 300$ beats headphones and break them because you slept on them.
*Are you looking for GREAT car insurance?!?*
I'm so late but I'M SO PROUD,WE'VE REACHED 1M SUBS
Or when one of the earbuds stops working
She has a YouTube Playlist Of ASMR videos? \n\n\n\n\ndamn. that's smart let me go start that.
I swear I thought I was the only one who gets strangled with headphones and it doesn’t feel good to lay down with headphones either \nALSO THE CHARGING IN THE MORNING
Omg yes yes yes yes!! All true!!!....lol great video!! Super cute  and really funny!!😍😘🤗😄😘
It’s to true
how long did it take you to get your phone to 1% while trying to film this?
Your editing in this is 💯. Good work
Anyone else also watching this video in bed, on your phone with earbuds? :P
*DO YOU BELIEVE IN CAR INSURANCE!!!!!!!!?*\n\n_Imaginaaaationnn~_
omg..literally this morning...i was watching asmr, i feel asleep, and i woke up with 0% on my phone...i tried to charge it...I ended up going to school with 17%😫😢and it died...and just great: in one of my classes, we needed to use a device for research...i sat in class doing nothing for 30 minutes😒😬
I got another one. When you want to watch ASMR, but one of your earbuds is broken, so you have no choice but to listen to one-sided ASMR.
I hate when I’m watching an asmr video and my mom starts yelling my name... then when I ask her What, she doesn’t answer back. Then I have to physically go all the way downstairs to ask her... hate it.
SO MUCH TRUTH IN THIS VIDEO
is it tjust me or is her bed super squeaky
when you tryna fall asleep but the headphones your using for asmr are uncomfy when you lie on your side
My favorite asmr video got deleted once. It was a blue yeti mic test video, and it was the most tingly thing ever. The worst part is, she didn't even just delete the one video, Zozo ASMR deleted her ENTIRE channel. I was depressed for a couple days.
This video explains perfectly why Taylor is back with her creep. You can see her real personality opposed to this America's ASMR sweetheart she has been playing for almost 2 years. Yuck.
You should make a vlog channel two
When she got scared over the ad thing I got all scared too cause I was relaxed
I remember when the Annabelle creations ad was all over YouTube..... That sure was a bad to be watching ASMR
The headphones always tangle. Somehow, i managed to have them go inside my shirt and out the neck hole
When you go to sit up and accidentally pull your earphones out your ears and headphone jack.
I love this Type of Videos too!☺💜
I prefer to listen to amsr without my head phones
*M O T H E R F R I C K E R  W H E R E  A R E  M Y  H E A D P H O N E S  A T*
I got tingles in this video for some reason it wasnt even a asmr video. But i got tingles in some parts like when she was wispering and taping on that cans and the pillows souds that it makes when she moved around😊
I've never seen a video so relatable
I usually wake up in the morning to find my earphones disconnected from my phone, earbuds still in (and wrapped around my neck), but my phones nowhere to be found! The chargers so long it could literally be anywhere!
1 million subscribers
THIS is funny
LOL OMG WTF
“OH MAMMA THATS RELAAAXING”\n-ASMR darling 2017
😂😂😂Spongebob🤣🤣🤣
*earbuds
Most Accurate video ever
Jesus! I love Vivienne ♡
Would bang
this is honestly so relatable
your acting is goddamn mindblowing lol
MOTHER FUCKER
THICC
darling: that means im gonna have to wTch aSMR wIThOuT MY HEADPHONES \nme: *dramatic gasp*
I lost my skull candy headphones
HAPPY DEATH DAY
Download tutu app vip. Follow instructions. Download YouTube ++ . It’s a free version of YouTube red no ads
I love that flute song who knows what it's called?🙂
That male asmr the she watches is ASMR Zeitgeist
When you play ASMR but the people around you are too loud
Having to choose between charging you phone and using headphones
I CAN RELATE SO HARD
I had never felt so identified with a video 😂😂❤
OMG THIS IS SO ME
ASMR with AirPods = the best.  I have to search for them every morning, but totally worth it.
I just watched pj's useless facts video
When you fall asleep watching a 3 hr ASMR and don’t wake up on time bc your phone died mid video 😰
The dislikes are from all earbuds
I find the way Brittney talks very relaxing. Brittney roleplay when? :D
This is me every night.😂😂😂
Mother fricker is going to be my new saying
that was so true.  i see ur past a mil subs :)  congrats.  always love watching u
Do more videos like these! These are funny👏🏻😂😂
Totally truth! Those things happen every day \nLoving this video
M O T H E R F R I C K E R
Why is this all true? Like she got everything right
The stragglers are real ever night 😴 waking up 😖
I deal with all of these
I watch asmr without my headphones literally all the time. That’s the only way I watch it hahaha.
love your video jeje my first language is Spanish but I speak a little English and if everything you said is true haha ​​greetings from argentina kisses
I have all of those problems
i relate to this in many ways!
This video is Amazing 😂🔥🔥🔥
I don't really know if wearing a earphone overnight is good for  my ear 😄😄
I know which position i'd prefer ;)
have you heard of pianoboy? his music is really calming and relaxing. ASmr might make you lose yourself for a while but you still get frustrated day to day right? painoboy's music really calms a person in a lasting way
Am I the only person who doesn't watch ASMR videos with headphones because they're annoying while laying on the side?
+ASMR Darling I recently experienced the Struggles of MAKING ASMR
Hello
Lmao i love u
Bc i wake up gorgeous
Omg me and Taylor have like, the exact same room
OMG I LOVE PJ DREAMS TOO!!! And you of course!❤️
Another problem is *BUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP*
Lol omg wtf hahahahaha
Same
She look AnoASMR
Relatable
*oh mama*
Mother fricker 😂😂
So relatable
Oh God please no
wasted lmfao
This is sooo true
WASTED
No Asmr
Lol!

Can be founded in a kid-friendly channel, doesn't accept people opinion, wants to fuck Jake Paul and want to kill all the haters for no reason\n\nHARDCORE JAKE PAULER: Type everything in caps on, use shit ton of emoji and waste money for Jake Paul crap merchandise.\n\nAUTISM JAKE PAULER​: The extremely most common species, wants to lick Jake Paul tits and dick, use Shit ton of emoji, disrespecting parents and waste data just to watch Jake Paul\n\nAnd here are the list of Jake Paulers that you should be careful!

You are the best YouTuber🤑😀😀😀😀😆😆😆
The dislikes are from Costa for being pocketed by Per in FA cup final
Wow his English is pure fluent better than Kane tbh
If Arsenal FC was a man it would pretty much be Per 👏
you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice that he cares. it's great that he cares.
I feel proud that we have such a fantastic club captain!
Per Mertesacker, a true leader in many areas of life. A good example, strong but humble character. He is an example of what we lack in today's society, not just in football, for a man to stand up and be a leader and but remain true and humble. What a brilliant man.
More people need to be like that. Including me.
now i know why wenger chose him to be our club's captain
Per really looks like a young Arsene Wenger when he was young lol
Class act on and off the pitch 👊👊
Please don’t retire. Ever.
I honestly love Per Mertesacker. He will always be a legend whilst he retires.
I'll always love this guy. Always. What a legend. Humility builds great leaders.
Big Friendly German once again showing the young Guns what Sportsmanship is all about.
Big _Friendly_ German awww
What a guy per mertesacker BFG⚽️. My G
Why not make him assistant coach for next season?
What a genuine and lovely person respect per
All young players, from ALL clubs, watch & learn, BFG, top man,
I just love this club so much
A perfect club captain for us.
John Terry might have every single trophy for club out there and perhaps superior to the BFG but he ain't won a World Cup has he
manutd fan here, have to admit I have always looked up at to him both on and off the pitch
He's such a great guy.
Top lad
Man like BFG
The depth of character of this man...geez Louise.  It's an absolute honor to have him represent The Arsenal on and off the pitch.  I hope he remains with the Club in various capacities long after this final campaign.
Proud to be gooner fan and proud of him..coug
This man has went from hero-Legend-God
Big Friendly German!!! Top Guy I reckon.
What a great man! Let's keep him at the Arsenal.
Gary hurt Per's eye 😭
He gives so much back to the community. Could do with a politician like him tbf
Values of this club were always top , love you Per.
Mertesacker should be Arsenal Manager by 2030... Remember me...
What a great man.\nReally hope he can instill the same values he has on the younger lads (not saying that they don't have it) and raise them to be leaders, not just football players.
Proud to have him at arsenal
Remember who you are, what you are, and who you represent.
PER!!! What a GUY..!! 👏
Well done and nice video UP THE GUNNERS🖒
What a good day for me. Inspired
Respect! It's good of Arsenal to keep hold of him
I love this guy man.. what a legend.
people who dislike this have no heart
Mertesacker one of my all time favorites. This man's form in 14/15 damn!!
Thanks Per, that was touching and lovely
I just dont understand people these days how can there be 4 dislikes ,what is wrong with being honest and wanting to highlight a important condition in many peoples life's. even if your not an arsenal fan or admirer of per there shouldn't be dislikes
Wow. Such an amazing role model for Arsenal. So much respect for Per Mertesacker.
Fantastic!  Hope to see you on the pitch again soon.
Now that is how you really serve your people and country not a never ending war in the name of peace, so much respect for you Per
Per is a one of a kind.
I can't wait until he takes over the Arsenal academy. He is going to be such an important asset to youth development. Legend.
I'm a simple man, I hear Per Mertesacker giving his perspective  on something, I listen.
Hi  i love the guners please can play in your team  please 😢 🙏
Hopefully his last game with Arsenal is winning Europa League trophy! #Respect #Legend
You cannot hate Per Mertesacker
Legend💪🏾
Love this guy
our captain! <3 :')
WELL DONE MERTESACKER!!!!!
Per is somebody that you just can't hate.
Big f****** German - Top guy. A really nice guy.
A gentle giant and a great man.
Well done sir!  Respect to you!
The man's so elegant and refined he's even starting to look like Arsene
You are a very good man Per. Big fan. A man who is really down to earth, loves the club and fans. A true leader and real captain. Thanks.
Can see this guy becoming manager of our great club one day 🔴⚪️❤️
Hope Per always stays around the club, he's such a gentle, intelligent kind-hearted guy
We can have this great mentality.. and all the other great mentalities that Arsenal have AND buy top class players that might not meet the humble footballer and change them to be more humble once they're brought to Arsenal!!
my favorite player since he played his first few games at arsenal. what a guy
I hope Per stays in UK and with Arsenal for many years.
I don't even like football, what a great guy
What a great guy Per is.... really pleased he's staying on at Arsenal after he's finished playing. He has all the right values.
We're lucky to have this kind and thoughtful human being at our club, your a credit to your parents and country
Proud that he is our CAPTAIN :)
We Love You Per. You have opened my eyes. God Bless You
Announce Thomas Lemar signing in January
4 dislikes WTF... Spuds troll ?
What a inspiration 👏👍
Thats why he is captian, always stay humble guys!
Nice video Per, good bloke
Lad
I appriciate this more than trophies.\nThis is per..this is Wenger..this is wenger's philosofy..this is arsenal!!!!!!!!!!
Mertesacker being a legend, as PER usual...
Proud to have him as our Captain! Also proud that he speaks better English than Harry Kane... What a man
does germany still have that kind of national service?\nwe seriously need it in england
Love, Per.
BFG!
Much respect Per Mertesacker. Really touching example
; ♥️ ;
BFG!!! “F” stands for fabulous, fantastic :) what an inspiring man.
An Arsenal Legend already!
Class pure class...thank you Per!
Craque.
Love mertesacker
Fantastic wall done to hem & Respect
Fair play per👏
Love you Per
Per mertasacker blond hair
He truly stands tall among men.
The beautiful side of America
That type of song you can do in car rides... making love.. even Family party... or listening just by yourself late night by a neon fading light... ODESZA is pure magic  <3
i love the cookout aesthetic.\nAlso craving some cornbread rn !!
You guys captured something powerful happy here :D
Odesza brings all the feels again.
Shitt im not first
fucking hell this is intensely beautiful
This song is uplifting... makes me wanna cry... I am crying now..
song is amazing but wtf is the video
❤️❤️❤️
👍
This song feels like both a eulogy to past endings, and a hymn to new beginnings at the same time. That's pure magic to me.
Beautiful. This touched my heart.
What are we doing in the comment section. ENJOY THE MUSIC
lol that only 2 white guys at the party hahah
My speakers won't go loud enough for this one
I was making a video basted in one of your songs (Rely) and i find out that now it has copyrights.It's about a shipwreck in Greece,is there any way  i can use your song..It's the only one that matched for me!!
Love this video! Matches the song beautifully!
I love that the guys make an appearance in the video...
Since October Good Music Been Showing Up :D
Yes, my favorite video from you guys! I am a big fan of Leon Bridges so its dope you all made the video on film and kept it authentic to your sound as well as his
What I really appreciate about this album is that they focused on sounds rather than beats if that makes sense. Like it freakin gives me the feels.
Please make a full album movie for A Moment Apart!
This gave me chills. Lots of beautiful emotion. Great job, guys, as always.
This is a beautiful song and a awesome music video
Wait, how old is Leon bridges?? I thought that album Coming Home was from like 50 years ago what is going on
Hey guys, I've recently made a mix that I think might appeal to some of you.\nIf you have some spare time on your hands, check it out! thanks.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/19untld97/sleepless-mix02
good song but why the black people
I just noticed ODESZA IS IN THE VIDEO AT 2:20
I love this song!  It's like how music from the 70s and 80s sounded, but in a modern way.  Finally music that I'm proud of, that was made during our present time
Hey guys please check out my new music YouTube channel. Thanks
Favorite off the album.
Everyone white girl just orgasmed at the same time
When i listening the album for the first time i think Its too different than old themes now some weeks later i fucking love this album :D
A Moment Apart-FAN MADE MOVIE!..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llEbJrs5MVs&t=25s
I feel more connected to my Afro-brother roots.
Heard the song live at Bumbershoot before the album came out and it's one of my favorites off this incredible album.
This makes me wanna be black! Just this communal, easy going vibe❤ Why am I so white haha:)
This it probably the only song they have ever made that I don't like
I want to be friends with Leon. He seems like such a humble and down to earth dude.
Notice Odesza at the party at 2:19? awesome video <3
Such a  nice music video.
sounds a little bit like Moby

Hermoso!!!
0:58 Best part ever
Красиво снято)
Odesza makes me so happy!
Perfect song for some wedding planning and stuff! Spread LOVE :)
There is a very obvious reason why this is my favorite song on the album. Very nostalgic feeling and amazing like all your other tracks, keep it up ODESZA!
Most killing track on this album
I can't wait to see them at the Lost Lake Festival!!
lol anyone notice odesza in the video
it's got that late 90's early 2000's feel. so good
Atleast 50% of the views here are mine
This song is so good :3
Love Leon Bridges in everything he does!

que album tan mas perfectooooo!, ojala porter sacara otro maldito album tambien
Me encanta la humildad en este vídeo, excelente ODESZA💙
La puta madre, que buen vídeo y que buen tema!! Amo A Moment Apart 😍😍
Đây là một video hay... \nGreat video..
Track reminds me of Moby's Play era
terible...why him... as feat...shiiiiite
Said it before his call up that Winks is what England need ahead of every other English CM. Henderson and the likes seriously do fuck all. Don't assist, don't pass forward, don't slice open defensive teams etc. The only thing those plodders do is pass sideways like Crabs and run around like a headless chicken. Right now England should be looking at Dier/Winks/Drinkwater/Lewis Cook/Tom Davies/Loftus Cheek/Chalobah/Barkley/Ward Prowse. \n\nHenderson, Livermore, Ox, Sturridge, Delph, Wilshere (who needs to prove he can stay fit for a season), Shelvey are all fucking liabilities in so many ways from lack of skill, awareness to discipline and temperament.
What I like about this boy is he gets the ball and straight away he turns towards goal, too many English players panic and turn their backs and start passing back into their own area
Thanks for putting this on. I could watch this lad all day. Here, guys, is the future creative pinnacle of England's midfield. I've watched him grow with Spurs and he never has an off day. Always busy, always creative, quick and clever, combative and with a passing accuracy that just gets better and better. He will be our 'Little Iniesta' - Pochettino's words.
Didn't see Harry winking once what is this video about? That 7 seems pretty good though. Still a fit Wilshere is what England needs.
time tovget rid off players like shelvey and livwrmore lol offer nothing
Already England's best player apart from Kane. Far superior to Alli and Rashford who constantly give the ball away.
He has good technique... for an English player
I hope to get rid of the disgrace of Henderson like Milner
gotta start at the world cup
no more hendersson. hendersson lacks ability on the ball and he could only operate uaing his pressing and occassional long passes and switch play in a fast tempo pressing team like liverpool. when games slow down at international level he cant do a thing against dense defence. emgland has many technival players and wilshere barkely and winks could dictate play and play those through passes between crowd and create space. its time to use the proper man
Eric Dyer / Jack Willser / Daily Ella / Rose Barclay / Avey eijreya / Harry Winkes / Lewis Cook / Adam Lallana midfield should go to Russia and toss the dumb Henderson off the plane
Enjoy the Trailer for Pacific Rim 2
Those Jeagars should not be shiny and jumping around. They're meant to be inefficient last resort war engines which are dark and gritty. Armored to the point of sacrificing mobility to endure the Kaiju. What is this power ranger shit.
The 1st film was good, I've got a feeling this next instalment,won't be as good
THIS IS FANTASTIC AND EXTRODINARY AND FABULOUS. I don't know why people dislike this
Is it me or at 2:32, it sounds like glados from portal
This looks so shit like a transformers movie. Fuck they should have not make a sequel to Guillermo del toros fantastic movie. The cgi even looks shit. And you can't beat ron pearl man who was awesome
Any one else dislikes the same sleek design to all the jaeger they don’t seem to have the same personality as the ones from the first movie
This is what i fucking love about this movie. Jaegers actually died, making the bleakness actually seem believable. Now they're just fucking power rangers in the sequel and the worst that can fucking happen is a broken arm\n\nAlthough it's not out yet so i want to be proven wrong.
I own the first one
Hollywood runs out of ideas so they start making prequel s smh
Best Movie Downloading Site Is Tubemediadown.com
i cant wait for it to come out
KARL FOOKING TANNER THE LEGEND OF GINALLEY at 1:29
Holy shit its GLaDOS! Also in the mood to rewatch Evangelion now. (Very similar genre)
The original Pacific Rim is a cult classic, this looks worrying though. And WTF is up with the trailer music... No Ramin Djawadi this time eh? That sucks.
At this point it's titan fall
2:19 GlaDOS is going to be in the movie, now I have too see it, XD XD
Did Michael Bay direct this garbage?
I kinda enjoyed the first pacific rim. I'm curious about this one, but very obnoxious music.
Loved the first movie. But this looks horrible, with an equally horrible soundtrack/vibe.
How is the name of the music in the background
I've been waiting SOOO LONG for this OMG
Can't stand that beard
I only have one problem.. where is the water fighting? Its called pacific rim isnt it? Water makes the movements so much more solid and impactful.
Where the f**k is Raleigh Buckett? Dude if u make him die everyone will hate on u
OK. everyone is hating the new jeers but the  it makes sense that there faster stronger because it's been  20 years since  the Pacific rim  yes they could make them look  a bit more rustic and less smoth but it's still going to be a fun movie I mean there all 5th or 6 genration jäger so I would expect them to be better but I have not seen the movie but still I want to see it.
Hell I thought this was TITANFALL!!!
with a world with giant robots... i have never seen the sky so blue
IM SO HAPPY FOR THIS TO COME OUT :D
(The first scene with the girl) HOMEWORK IS COMING!!!!!
Stop cutting to black and show us something to get hyped for
the only good thing of this is Tupac
people over here talking like they could do it better
I got an ad of this trailer
what is this music? 1:19 I am asking for a quick answer
this looks like its gonna be another 'independence Day Resurgence' and 'GI Joe 2'...
Cant wait this to see
finally, the movie that i'm been waiting for
Are they look petty small now
where is the old jaeger pilots of Gypsy's danger????
I remember leaving the cinema in the middle of the first one .i don't know how they get backed up for a second one ,its a shame so many movies struggling to be made and we get this shit ,thanks Hollywood .
The old robots were at the right speed in real life they would be slowish but momentum would increase it over time but these new ones are moving like someone put on fast forward
Should of been set in London with that amount of British actors init.
Look! The idea of #Gundam huhuhu..
You gonna sleep on the homie Vince for making it??
the bad thing about this movie is...weigthless yes its like 10 year later(i think) bu ist that too fluid? heck the fastest jeager is striker eureka and it still hold a semblence of weigth.\nand the good stuff.\nkaiju combiner?
Wow they somehow took the most interesting and unique movie in hollywood and turned it into a corporate generic shit fest\nGod del toro cant catch a break
why u are fucking change the Gipsy Danger Riders.wtf is this??this will be a shit movie..
Gotta love a bit of rim now and again! 😊
that big one over towers the jaegers
this Movie looks fucking badass I don't give three fucks about what people are saying about this movie fuck them haters I can't wait for it
How is name of the music?
God I loved the first one so fucking much. I wake up and this shitty remake exists?? I'm going to have an aneurysm this looks so bad.
Okay this obviously has mixed reviews and I can see where people reviews are coming from I have respect for that I think we should wait for the second trailer and see Will it give us more let's not judge the movie cuz we haven't seen it but that's just wait for the second trailer and if that is you know bad to some people they should have picked another director
I had been waiting for this for my fking 4 years . And you gave me this? Fuck you
YES THE DOCTOR OF PAFIFC RIM 1 HIS BACK :D IM SO HAPPY my fav jaeger its azure defiant he its the philippines jaeger first philippine jaeger
Okay, i just have a few comments to say about this trailer regarding pacific rim in a whole. For one, why do the new jaegers look like super nimble and shit and as if you werent powering a goddamn big ass mech. In the first movie, they were latched on the this thing on the floor so if they got hit, they wouldnt fly off and get raped by the walls of the mech. Now, apparently, they can just run in the robot easily. In the first one, you can tell that the pilots needed strength when they tried to throw a punch. I know the old jaegers all got fucked up in the explosion in the last movie, but still. Not trying to bash this movie yet, but i hope it's actually good.
Hi Glados. Long time no see
I need the song in 1:00
*TRANSFORMERS MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE*
This gonna be TRASH. A shame...
I like Japanese Anime Super Robots?
Hah yes. Looks worse than the first one by far.
Everytime Chinese investment involves a movie it becomes shit.
Omg can't wait the people who have watched  pacific rim one pls like
I think that all the monsters combined to the big one bigger robot people loll
Day man, fighter of the night man. Campion of the sun. \nDay man. Master of karate and friendship. \nDayman ahh ahh aaahhhhhh
Well I guess we found Lincoln Clay Mafia 3..the movie though look meh
This gives me the chills.
This isn't the power rangers ?
doesnt look like theres weight to the motion, the whip flings that kaiju aside like an origami tiger
Don't like it.\nWrong approach, this is supposed to be a fun, stupid, colorful, wild almost B movie. Instead we get a Transformers-PowerRanger mediocre mashup that takes itself too seriously... sigh.\nWhat is wrong with you Hollywood? I had great expectations for this sequel, but now I see it's the same shite you tend to produce when you don't like to think about something new, and instead you pick someone elses project, fire him and everyone that made it unique, and make this crap.\nIt may work with teenagers who watch Transformers, but not with the people that loved the original. I'm not gonna pay for this one.
HOW DARE YOU use 2pac's music in vain???? for such a SHITTY LOOKING sequel.\nI mean the 1st movie was MEH'.... but this looks like FUCKING ASS!!!!
Playing 2Pac😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 truly immortal
nutella
Looks cool to me
Top..
OMG They used gladous's voice!!!!
nice trailer, horrible music
2:18 GLaDOS?
YES!!!! FUCKING YES!!!
Oh F**K diversity!
Go go power rangers
Song
Transformers + Power Rangers = Pacific Rim
Anyone else wondering why GLaDOS is narrating a Jaeger recruitment commercial?
Power angels 2
Whyyyyy where is the old guy whatttttt im sooooo shoooocked
Best movie ever
Category 9 kaiju
The orange Jaeger resembles Evangelion Unit-02.
Peeps, doubt It looks like  actually   great  resulw philosophy   ..
cool!
Glados ?
what the song ?
This movie sucks
2:17     Glados everyone
the kaiju combined like transformer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Was that glados voice
wow! the power rangers!!!
Great looking Q but Eater obviously hasn't visited many BBQ joints in America.  😂😂😂
Very sorry, but having 2 Joints in NY on the Best in America List is absolute BS buddies!!
This video is brought to you by the NYC tourist board of overpriced, knock off BBQ for the hipster set commitee. No Franklin's, no Carolina pit BBQ joints, no KC BBQ, no Memphis or Alabama BBQ? Not even the birthplace of smoked Q in Lockhart Tx, Kreuz, Smittys or Blacks? This isn't a list of the best BBQ, this is an advertisement aimed at the inexperienced BBQ hipster who wants to be cool. Real BBQ connoisseurs know this is the most bogus Q list in America! Very disappointed Eater!
Wheres Franklins BBQ?
Franklins BBQ! If it's not on your list, it is not a list of good BBQ.
2 places from New York?  GTFO of here!  This is expensive bbq for suckers.
More Like Top 5 BBQ Joints From People in NY
How is Franklins BBQ not on this list!! Eaters gotta go do their homework.....
How can you list 2 NY bbq places, and not list any Carolina bbq!?!?
Just putting NY once shows not to trust this list, but they did it twice. Dislike.
Why not Franklins BBQ?
First eater I'm going to thumbs down, not for the quality but the content. 2 from new york, no franklin's which there is no argument, it IS the most popular BBQ joint in the US. No Kansas City, no Memphis. I wouldn't have complained until you said some korean BBQ joint in Atlanta was the number 1? WTF?!  go home eater, you're drunk.
Oops!  Looks like there's been a typo.  Pretty sure the headline was supposed to read Eater's The Only 5 Barbecue Joints We Ever Visited in America (Where We Had B-Roll Left Over).
So the title should read Two New York and Texas places and one Atlanta place. They havent even touched Kansas City, Memphis or even the two different styles of BBQ in the Carolinas. Like people have said you didnt do anything over Franklins while in Austin or even went to Kruez.
Franklins??????
But wher s the funk and platonic flavors? Is it dry aged BBQ?
Snow's below NYC bbq? No Franklin's? Nothing from Carolinas or Kansas or Memphis?
This is a strange concept for a video. And the sound was wonky.
Unless title has changed I'm pretty sure this says Eater's top 5 favorite barbecue joints in america not best bbq joints in america  i dont understand why so many people are getting salty
worst top five anything ever .......ppl in New York don't even believe it.
lol. NYC BBQ x2 come on!!
Maybe not top 5 but que still looked pretty tasty
Who else replayed the first part over and over again?
Very lazy video. All you did was rehash b-roll from 5 places Eater had already filmed at and then put them into some arbitrary order. There is zero new content.
how is a place where absolutely no pork product is served one of the best in america? ribs and pulled pork are not so important?
Seems biased towards texas style/beef bbq except for the korean one.
No Franklin's and no Smoque? You guys are amateurs.
more than a THIRD of the American population is obese....no wonder why (smh)
As an NYC resident, I'm absolutely loving how triggered everyone is getting over this list.
As a North Carolinian, this list offends me.  Eat at 12 Bones, Bum's and Skylight Inn and then do a remake of this video the right way.
Ok.. i'm droooooooling right now!
This is the first time I have downvoted a video of eater. This video is BS!
Clearly phoning it in with this segment. A top 5 BBQ without Franklin’s is a joke.
So the best bbq is in NY??
Step 1. Go to Austin, TX.\nStep 2. Remake this video\nStep 3. Profit?
It’s favorites you morons - not best
lol 2 NY BBQ restaurants\nThey should rename this The Time One of our NY Staff Went to TX
I was going to say something here about Eater people being high to put 2 NYC joints in here, but my BBQ brothers & sisters got here before me.  Get off the subway, Eater people, and go eat BBQ in the real world!
La BBQ is amazing, havne't been to Snows though.
I haven't been anywhere in KC that belongs on this list.
Wtf where is franklin's
I love eater.com, but this list is beyond pathetic.  I don't know whether to be mad or feel sorry for you guys.. 2 NYC?? smh
Where is ol Rudy's bbq in Jackson ga
This is a joke. I noticed Memphis is not even on their top 23 list. I guess because not “Eater city”.
I was just staring at the meat thinking the jibber jabber about the best joints was coming at some point in the time space continuum.  But I have to give you props for just showing video, with cool music and no mumbo jumbo.\n\nTotally missed the top joints but I'm also totally cool with that.
Oh how I love the comment section on Eater
damn you guys have to get better sound editors. 9/10 of your videos are so quiet my dog cant even hear it
wait.. i love this vid cuz of all the meats but wheres franklin at??
Whose list is this?! You must be from NY.
Eater this is sad even for you. The travel channel tv show food paradise did a whole hour special on the best places to eat bbq in the country. They even shows franklins.
This is the reason why is watch this channel
No Franklin's? You gotta be kidding me
Eaters top 5 BBQ joins in america, except we did not want to travel far so these 5 will have to do.... \nnone of the well known iconic and best BBQ places in the list....... wtf
eater is so corrupt how can 2 new york places be in top 5 bbq places. the owners of those 2 restaurants must paid you alot to say that.
sorry, this is fashionable bbq vs real and delicious bbq.
I just ate breakfast and this still made me hungry.
Some of those had nice smoke rings on them.
dude, you're going to start a war in the comment
No Joe's Kansas City? No Franklins? 2 NY places? Come on man... Worst top BBQ list ever.\nThey got our views though so... They win.
Kansas City? Memphis? NC? I LOVE this show, but wow this is the worst BBQ list I ever saw.
See, these kind of ignorant posts makes a semi-successful youtube channel such as yourself who is just beginning to establish a reputation, discredit themselves. disliked and unsubscribed for lack of trying, good job eater.
No Franklin's GTFO!  Also no Memphis or Carolina or Kansas City BBQ joints represented delete the Meat Show permanently!  Snows is awesome at least you got that right!
There's no way any NY should be on the list, hipster.
few things make me salivate more than delicious looking BBQ. I'm not pro, but it makes me miss my smoker, my next apartment or townhouse needs to allow charcoal lol
This one is clearly missing a part of the title! It should go like Top 5 Favourite BBQ Joints in America, that aren't Franklin. Get your editors to work, Eater! xD
High Dollar imitation city Q. You need to get out more for BBQ.
Y'all don't get out very often do you?  Good BBQ in Brooklyn? Give me a break.
Looks like eater is starting to run out of ideas they're starting to recycle existing content like the Gordon Ramsey channel and great big story
lol all places should be below the mason Dixon line if you're talking about good barbeque
Obviously you have never been to KC.
Is it the edit or do all 5 restaurants essentially do the same thing?\n\nThere's a Korean restaurant and a Kosher restaurant and they're basically serving the same thing, low and slow smoked brisket. I get the rubs will be different, but come on guys, BBQ is such a rich field, where's the variety?\n\nEvery one of these looked like a Franklins clone. It would be great to see content producers cast a wider net and showcase places that are more original in their concept.
And Franklin's?!?
Black’s Texas oldest bbq!
Fake news
Texas bbq>>>>>>>>all bbq
Thisade me have sexual feelings
Damn.... just damn...
whoa no franklin bruh?
Yum, yes please!
Heirloom is soooo good.
Some of these briskets..smh
*NICE!!*
First!
U know Nick put that kosher place on the list due to his guilt.
Eater: where the purview is limited and the points don't matter! No Memphis or KC places...sad!
No Joe's KC or Q39? Not a valid list
Wtf is this cancer comment section. Title says Eater's top 5 barbecue places in America. Its Eater's opinion so they like whatever they may want to like. If they choose to not have Franklins, dont be butthurt crybabies about it.
BBQ is a touching subject to some... You bring this and that is the best people go crazy 😂 it's like bringing up politics and religion.
been to hometown bbq and its not that great.  shouldn't be on the list.
Now i want a short with Oswald!
I thought Mickey was gonna say something else when they come into the cave
Y Pinocchio y not Alice in wonderland
I don't know why i got sad when i saw walt and mick wink
La la la la la la la
1.12 A rat afraid of another rat.
I think I should make the video shorter !!
I almost cried at 3:04! #RelationshipGoals
They did make a holloween short its on demand if you have spectrum
These are so cute and funny!
Make Thailand episode plz <3
I love these shorts
OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS SO MAGICAL!!! <3 <3 <3 <3
I don't like it
The amount of referencing here, wow!!! Everything from Pinocchio's opening song, to Disneyland's Nature Wonderland to an original park map. Heck... it even foreshadows the new Mickey ride in WDW! It also remains vividly entertaining!
I've been there before
This is definitely the true story behind Big Thunder Mountain
this is the pinnacle of humor i love these so much
It would have been funny if the ending was that they were dreaming and none of that happened
My cousin thought they were brother and sisters but nope 😂😂
Walt Disney winking like I got you! just made my day
Mickey has a beautiful singing voice
Thunder mountain reference?\n\n\n\n\n\nOops forgot the splash mountain reference
I love you 😘 so much and you can always be loved
Mikey mousse
Wish I had a chance to ride that attraction before it was closed... alas, I wasn't even born yet. Still a great short though.
Great throwback to Disneyland's old attraction
I don't know why, but i love 1:00 soooooo much!
Ummmm...  One question were are chip and dale?
This is a rip off of cuphead
Disney need to go back to hand drawn animation :)
I can't handle the amount of references in this one short.
I cant believe The rainbow caverns was a real place... I got goosebumps.
They were literally riding big thunder mountain
make a  valentines day movie
IT'S MICKEY MOUSE...
Is supposed to be how Thurber Mountain was made??? Disney👏
that the best thing isee on the (hot shows) on youtube ...paint and fantasy
Cmon disney do what the creators of Cuphead did and go back to your roots this animation style sucks
This has all the charm of the old cartoon shorts they used to do! Love it!
Lol. I found this vid when it had 666 views.
Rated G Halloween movies in a nutshell0:57
Aww, this one was so sweet!! :D
The new Star Wars is looking great!
Who used to have these kinds of animations on cassette tapes  \n\nOnly 90s kid will understand
These shorts never disappoint me. They're the best!
I want a game in this animation style!!!! Like cuphead
Iowa
Ha ha
By 3:13 I thought it would end with a sad ending
I love those rats.\nThe ones with the plague.
I really hate the new mickey mouse animation design\nI remember when I was 10 they had the 3d/classic design..\nGood old days when disney actually cared about fans...
I'm sick of Disney adhering to these hetro-normative stereotypes
And so, they stuck in the Rainbow Caverns and live happily ever after😂😂
That was so good especially 0:07
I hope they make a Halloween short
Did they rly put. A goat next to TNT 😂😂
again, i ask myself how do i get here. haha
These are AMAZING, who is making these? And why arent they more famous??
Ren and Stimpy may well be the most influential cartoon ever. Seems most cartoons these days share its DNA. Even Mickey now.
Did they just .... die ??
Is HotDiggityDemon the voice actor?
mickey mouse never seems to fail in making my day
I thought my animation was bad!
Come a long way since steamboat willie
i love how they brought back Pinocchio :')
T H U N D E R  R A I L R O A D
When I heard that the short opened with Little wooden head from Pinocchio I immediately liked it because pinocchio is my favorite movie
I hope they make a ride out of this
Who else loves Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse ?
I want Duffy to be in one of these shorts.
Rats with plague I thought plague is done but not in Madagascar

The first Vox Borders documentary launches in 8 days. It's publishing October 17th, across Youtube and Facebook. The other 5 will come weekly after that, on Tuesdays. If you want to make sure you don't miss them, you can follow me on Facebook: www.facebook.com/johnnyharrisvox or sign up for my newsletter: www.vox.com/borders-email. \n\nI'm so excited to release these. I've been working on nothing else for the past 6 months, and I think they'll live up to the hype!\n\n- Johnny
I can't imagine the comments
Only wild monkeys in Europe \n\nNo go zones...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a joke...
RIP my ears
I thought I had a sam & niko tab playing in the background at the start of this video.
I went to an international guide camp in Co. Cavan in Ireland and the gibraltar guide leaders told us about 'los monos' being everywhere and being very naughty. Have you been to Jersey? It feels like a weird mix of France and Britain :)
Wouldn't the genetic pool for these monkeys be very limited to the point where they're inbreeding?
Finally a BORDERS episode about an actual border conflict. the rest were about stupid vending machines and surfing. Please don't fail me again.
Man where do I sign up for his job? It's so awesome to be able to travel and learn all these things, moreover being able to share them with the world on a popular platform.
These aren't monkeys. Monkeys have tails.
Those Monkeys are robbing bastards! One of them still has my old Nokia............
Asia is full of wild monkeys cuz you can definitely see it in India!
Gibraltar is not a zoo, so why cant I feed the monkeys? Stupid rules.
You hear tht  The Males Play A Huge Roll in Raising The Infants  I Respect Tht Too 👏🏽
The only monkeys? Mate you forgot the cast of Eastenders.
I clicked because the guy is hot
English is my second language, I'm asking, shouldn't he say there ARE monkeys instead or is ? 0:01
ohhh...you haven't travelled to india then haha
Who else is from Gibraltar here? Please tell me I'm not the only one.
All the British monkeys are coming to America and taking over TV host positions.
In my city, a monkey held up an old lady and took her money
Actually there are plenty of monkeys in Eu if you check a place called the rift on league of legends
hmmmmm nah will leave it its just too easy!
Militarized for WAR. Wow. Excellent observation
Let's see what happens after Brexit...
Funny how the thumbnail could referr both left and right as monkeys
You are a mix of Rhett and Michael from vsauce  lol
Oh ye, I visited that place about 2 years ago, but didn't know it was the only monkey inhabited place in Europe. Very strange indeed, there is an airbase built ontop of the water and you suddenly traveled from Spain to a British speaking area. If you visit, remember that the boarder patrol are British so don't be fooled by Spanish ticket scammers, especially since you don't even need a ticket cross boarders x.x
I knew there were going to be racist comments before opening them!
No, there is also monkeys in Finland. Winter monkeys.
Arent they supposed to be recording that new album? smh
what is the name of second track? the one that starts at 1:05?
What about all the monkeys that ran away from their country and are now plaguing Europe? They should be included too...
The monkeys will steal your ice cream and dolls if you aren’t careful, I’ve been there
But there's millions of monkeys in Europe 😉
Gibraltar voted 95% to remain in the EU😂
THEY FORGOT ABOUT THE WINDSOR MONKEYS IN WINDSOR CASTLE !
Thought this was going to be about middle eastern refugees
Orangutans are common in China India has monkeys ! It's all the same landmass .🐒🙊🙈🙉🐵
Bet there are gonna be plenty of racist ass comments down here
Thought this was gonna be about African and Middle Eastern immigrants...
You can find monkeys that claim to be refugees from Northern Africa all over Germany and France
Before too much longer the title will read  The only Europeans left in Europe. liberal trash.
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \n\nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Him! He loves you! \n\nPlease don't listen to the lies of the enemy. Jesus is not angry at you, in fact He is waiting on YOU to call upon Him! Jesus died so that you may live! \n\nHe knows what you are going through, and He will help you if you would let Him. \n\nI pray you consider calling upon Him today. You may not get another chance, and to die without The Lord Jesus is a very dangerous thing. \n\nJudgement is also swiftly approaching, and Jesus is the Only Way to escape. So please trust and follow Jesus today! Don't be scared, Jesus TRULY Loves you! \n\nShalom, friends.
Lol complete bullshit. Just visit any Muslim ghetto in Europe. You'll see.
I am watching this about 1km away from where you are filming that and those monkeys are vicious and often attack you it you aren't careful on the devil's steps (one of the ways up to the top)
y is he pronouncing it macock?
Gibraltar is the best!!
I bet they are inbred as heck.
There are alot of these monkeys in northern India. I always see them when I visit
europe is full of monkeys my man.
why don't they leave Gibraltar and spread out?
Come to India, monkeys will even enter your hotel and sometimes humans here also behave like monkeys
So imperial Britain cared more for these macaques then they did for all the humans of the Indian subcontinent. How quaint
Go to the Catalan region of Spain next please!
Muslims are loose monkeys, should kill them all
Does someone have a link to listen to the last music? Despite the name in the credits I can't find it anywhere
Winston, is that you?
Photographing the monkeys is psychologically stressful for them.\n*Films the monkeys instead.*
Lol you make Gibraltar look interesting and not a boring shithole
I remember when i visited Gibraltar one of the monkeys sat on the back of one of my friends and started pulling on her hair and she started freaking out and i was like just chill out maybe you should stop trying get selfies with him and just take a photo of him .
Here are a few things here I think are important and cool about Gibraltar:\n- Gibraltar is one of the last territories that the UN considers a colony in the world. Gibraltar in this video is shown to be an entity Britain would give up and give back to Spain, but the residents and government of Gibraltar want to be entirely independent of both countries and be their own sovereign nation. \n-Gibraltar is entirely self-sufficient economically and they actually end most years with a surplus\n-Gibraltar is not just English and Spanish. Because of the small populace, minorities have a substantial impact on the culture. These include a large Indian community as well as the second largest population of Jews per capita in the world\n-Going off the previous point, many people from Gibraltar speak Llanito, a hybrid of Spanish and English with many words and phrases from Hebrew/Yiddish and Hindi mixed in.
The monkey myth - lose the monkeys, lose the Rock - is almost word for word like the myth about the ravens at the Tower of London, and both with the twist of Winston Churchill ordering the animals protected for the sake of the nation.
That's cool. I want to visit some day
Reminds me of the Green Monkeys in Barbados. They were likely brought there through trade.
As someone who's been to Gibraltar, banning tourists from giving food isn't going to do anything because the monkeys are the ones attacking the tourists and stealing their food/ running after you.
Technically Gibraltar is close enough to be considered Africa as well
You're forgetting all the wild muslims and africans
Very interesting topic, TERRIBLE footage. Damn son, if you can't nudge the camera in the right direction exposure-wise, you should get a competent cameraman to follow you.
Are these really monkeys? I thought monkeys had to have tails. Apes don't have tails.
The only wild monkeys in Europe: Rapefugees
i thought all monkeys had long tails. **the more you know**
Gibraltar will never be Spanish but forever remain part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
... are the illegal immigrants.
I live here haha this for me is super normal
Wait what about the millions of migrants?
Muslims are all over Europe, that's one type of monkey
The  monkeys are moroccan native monkeys from the Atlas Mountains, there a big sea gap between morocco and that rock and u still ask how they got there ? Damn VOX u can be stupid sometimes
I know a guy when I lived in Gibraltar who threw a monkey off a cliff because it stole his daughters necklace.
I hate how I have anxiety and live here. There is a 1/30,000 chance I could be in this video.
What are you talking about? I saw loads of wild monkeys when I was in Italy and more come there every day
Welcome to Europe :)
We have immigrants
THEY APES. check for tails.
Welcome to watchpoint Gibraltar
I live there ☺☺☺
They’re apes
You mean immigrants
Congrats on 3 mill
joss fong i love you

Horrid lip injections 😱😱😖😖😖\nNicol looks like Duckie from The Land Before Time 🤔
That contour color is orange af 😕
Can you make a house tour? Really want see how your house looks like, and also want see the other part of the room you film in :)
I think I'm about the only one thinking this but, cheek contouring to me just looks an obvious dark line across your face - even when done well it doesn't decrease the cheek or enhance the cheekbones. Oh well
4:19 'gogo gaga' I LOVE CRISTINE  SO MUCH omg i never laughed so hard honestly loving this series
Christine heart my comment if you are holosexual
I am officially a homosexual. Thanks Cristine. I was never really a fan of glitter nail polish til I saw your  holo nail polish intro!
I always laugh way too hard at the whatdya think I woke up my boyfriend
At first i thought she was mylifeaseva
It was the summer of 2001; Joe meets Patrick and he’s like “Yo, I know about music.” and Patrick’s like “Yo, I know more about music” That’s impossible. Do you wanna start a band?” And Patrick’s like “…Yeah… That’s cool.” And then he’s like “Yo, this is a book store, it's not a music store!” And then they met at Patrick’s house. And Patrick’s wearing shorts and socks and a hat. Patrick is playin’ drums for some fuckin’ reason! And Pete’s there, for some reason! They start playin’ music together. And they're like “Oh, let’s play some fuckin’ covers from some other bands!” It was like, Green Day and fuckin’ Misfits and fuckin’ Ramones! Pete said to Joe “Yo, we gotta change this shit up! Yo, we’ve played all these bands; let’s play shit from Fall Out Boy.” And so Pete and Patrick are like “Yo, that’s dope. But we need a fuckin’ drummer!” Because Patrick’s playin’ drums and he’s a singer! Patrick's like “Yo! I got a soul voice!” And they're like “Wait, how do you have a soul voice!?!” And he’s like “Yo, watch this! Yeah!” and they’re like “Oh my god! That sounds like soul!” So they put it in the song and it was like “WHERE IS YOUR BOY TONIGHT!” And then they’re like: “Yo, this is fuckin’ perfect. This is Fall Out Boy.” And they made records like, Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend. Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend, everybody loves it. It's called: Evening Out With Your Girlfriend. -With Your Ex-Girlfriend! It's called Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend! It's called Eating Out Your Girlfriend, and it's real and it doesn't matter. And Pete talked to Patrick and Joe and he was like “Yo, what the fuck! Yo, this is gonna be fuckin’ dope!” So they made a record, and it was called: Take This To Your Grave. They made it without a drummer! And they had like three, four drummers come in. The four drummers they had come in were like: Josh Freese, Neil Peart, the dude from Toto… The fourth one was like the guy from Papa Roach or something. And they were like, “Yo, we need Andy Hurley. Andy Hurley. Take This To Your Grave. Fuckin' record it.” And he did it, and he killed it. He was like, Bigadigadigalalululapssshhhh! Killing the skins! Tapping the skins! Tapping the rims! Playing the shit! Killing these bitches! Wrapping it out! (You're getting a fucking tattoo right now! What the fuck is going on?!) “We should get signed, to Fueled by Ramen. 'Cause these guys know what the fuck is going on.” And they were like “Yo, if you can make our scene any bigger than it is, which is not fuckin' hard. We will sign you guys. Pete was like ”Yo! We got this record that’s fuckin’ dope dude! It's called Take This To Your Grave.“ Hey, it's gonna be called From Under The Cork Tree, it's gonna be fuckin' huge. And then Patrick’s like I gotta keep it real, I gotta keep it artistic. These are three songs that are gonna make the album and it's called (burp), this is called: Thanks for the Memories, 20 Dollar Nosebleed, and Sugar We're Going Down..” And they made this record that was fucking dope and it fucking hit on the charts like: one, two, three! Three, two one! Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! TEN TO ONE! From Under The Cork Tree sold like, four million records! Ten million records! Fifteen million records! And Brendon Urie had nothing to do with the entire record. And Patrick was like “That's good!” Pete was like “Yo, fuck you! I can do whatever I want!” Joe was like “Yeah, it's cool man, whatever… I don’t give a shit.” And then Andy was like “Eh… Cool!” And Pete was like Makeup is fuckin’ great for a guy. Because it makes a guy look beautiful. Which a lot of times, a guy is not beautiful. And I wanna change that. I wanna make sure everybody thinks that guys are beautiful. (I'm good so far. You wanna spit one more time? Yeah, I do. ...Shut the fuck!..) Pete was like “Oh my god, I’m so embarrassed about this dick pic!” And then I saw the dick pic, and I was like “Eh, it's not bad. It's not a bad dick. Let’s be real.” We made Rolling Stone one issue before Fall Out Boy. And Fall Out Boy made the issue right after us and they were so pissed! They were like “Yo, fuck you guys!” They were like “Yo! Panic has the fucking cover of Rolling Stone!?! Yo, fuck these dudes, we're gonna fucking go miles above! We're gonna hit every fucking continent there is known to man!” But they didn’t! Because they missed a second of time. Apparently, they were like: “Oh, shit we got every continent.” And they didn’t actually hit it. Dude, Pete was like What the fuck!” Oh, you didn’t fuckin’ make the continent. It's like, fuck you! So From Under The Cork Tree happens, we fuckin' have three, four years of awesomeness! Like people are cumming on themselves, 'cause it's so big! So Fall Out Boy was like, so Patrick’s like “Yo, we're gonna name this record From Under The Cork Tree and From Infinity On High.” Pete was like “Yo, Folie à Deux means, the Theatric of Two.” Fall Out Boy was like “Yo, we gotta take a break” meaning, Pete was like “Yo, we gotta take a break bro” and Patrick’s like, “I need time for my music! Uhhh!” And Joe's like “Yo, I need time to find the fuckin’ art dude I gotta find some fuckin’ meau-metal.” And Andy’s like “I’m just gonna play with some fuckin' metal bands.” And they were like, “Alright, this breaks been like three years long. Two years long. Three years long. Three and a half? We gotta fuckin’ come back man. We gotta come back STRONG!\n(You took my beer away, what the fuck?! No, you poured it all over yourself! Yeah, you poured it on yourself, man.) We gotta make this shit legit. It's gonna be fuckin' dope. It's gonna go fuckin' sky high. We're gonna make a fuckin' record that sails the skies. We're gonna call this record: Save Rock And Roll.” So they made Alone Together, Light 'Em Up, Alone Together, Phoenix. And everyone’s like “What the fuck? You’re working with this guy who fuckin' recorded Avril Lavigne and P!nk!” (What the fuck is this on my shirt, did I puke on my shirt? No, you poured beer all over yourself Oh god...) Pete was like: “Yo, we're gonna end up on the tour with Panic! At The Disco and Twenty Pilots.” (Burp, spit) And that’s all. And that’s all that matters. And that is how the fucking story goes.
When Cristine says I'm a beauty guru I know what I'm doing girl and sticks her tongue out I die every time😂😂
Damn what's up with Nicol's lips?
Why were make up you bueatifull anyways unicons don't we're make up !
I'm so sorry but what is the deal with Nicole's jaw bones? I have never seen anyone's face stick out in that way. Really not trying to be mean. I actually want to know what that is. It's on both sides of her jaw. Really protruding like a bone.
Please do a Simply Claylogical
cristine, i love ur fucking contour
OMG I love ur fucking videos  bigest fan #holosexual 😍😍❤❤❤
Holo vampire teeth
They look so pretty ✨✨✨✨
So it says SimplyNAILogical...
OMFG Ben and Cristine kissed on Nicol concilio latest video
Did she say booty guru
3:51
Do a vid on popping a balloon popping to make slime (don't do it if there is no holo because what's the point if Thiers no holo)
I love like I know none of the beauty people
Pewdiepai should be in this series
This video shows the incredible skills of the pilots. Even after an unexpected wind gust after touchdown they managed to re-align with the runway. Incredible job by the pilots !!
Just what speed was the crosswind anyone?
Why was the plane even told to land if the storm was that bad? This could have ended really badly and probably made all the passengers feel like they were going to die.
The pilot was perfect on the rudder at 21-22 and should of held it in that poison but at 23 seconds \n he goes hard left rudder, I think he was in a bit of panic because he clearly held that left rudder a full second or more before going back right.  Additionally he was way too HARD on the rudder.
Kind of a terrible landing actually...sorry
This video is a total cover up for a bad landing. An approach with heavy crosswinds as claimed would have the aircraft crabbing or offsetting on approach. This one is coming with its nose straight in for landing. Chaos happens after touch down. It pure pilot error in over-anticipating rudder. Luckily he did not get into a lateral PIO.
The pilot who made the landing was a captain candidate on a training flight. He is now removed from roster as they call it in EK.\n\nYou are not allowed to make a mistake like this. One unexpected gust, and this could have been one of the worst aviation accidents in history. He is lucky to only lose his job, and hopefully he got himself a real eye-opener of what the fuck could've happened. If it was up to me he should've lost his license aswell. \n\nAlso kind of terrifying how much praise you are giving this terrible pilot in the comment section. If you are not a pilot, instructor or ATC, don't comment on the pilot's skills at all.
If you sub to me I’ll sub back with two separate accounts like and comment when done ✅
Should of gone around.
He straight up drifted a plane
I don't get it why the pilots and ACT decided to land in such dangerous situation. It jeopardized hundreds ppl.
I've been on that plane all night and all day like Ariana, this pilot really got me goin' side to side, shit! 😂
NEXT TIME PEOPLE CHECK THE WEATHER BEFORE YOU LEAVE
Take that, you bad, bad runway.
It's easyer than it looks
Look how delicate those wings are. One of these went through concrete and came out of the other side. WOWWIE!
nice videos i likes it so much , please watch my video airport in Cambodia : https://youtu.be/diD0-gkc6pQ
Fantastic piloting skills but pretty scary for the passengers. Excellent footage! Best Regards from Maxi and Maro.
Hard to imagine what would have happened if the nose wheel touched early when the plane was bouncing, May be that is the training
Cheap try to make people beeing afraid again
Solid-state coupled lidars with intersecting fields of view on-board aircraft would allow automated, preemptive course & heading corrections near the ground. See https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/a-deep-dive-into-the-tech-behind-gms-new-lidar-on-a-chip-company/
Massive over-correction on the rudder caused the aircraft to veer wildly like that, not to mention the very hard landing. This is not heroism at all. The pilot flying as well as the pilot not flying should be sent back to sim for a loooong time before they get to drive the bus again. Hope that aircraft went into a proper maintenance check straight after...
Outstanding Airmanship. Please show the pilot landing this beast. Deserves a medal!
That plane did exactly what that rudder told it to do.  The crosswind had him crabbed hard, but the drastic loss of lift on that landing made that plane hit hard and it looked like it resulted in the pilot overcorrecting.   More aileron, less spoiler and rudder on that landing next time.
Lol it does not look like a storm since theres sunlight but really high winds
I'm no expert, but Looking at the vid in slomo it appears the rudder input was used to line the plane up in the crosswind but then wasn't cancelled when the wheels hit the ground sending the plane veering off to the left. I think  the pilot may have been distracted by a late gust causing the starboard roll which meant the  starboard landing gear touched down earlier (and harder!) than expected. Props to the tyre manufacturer - they appear to have all survived intact.
Those at the back of the plane please remain in your seats until the plane finishes waving to the crowd.
Amazing capture! Please allow me to say this was an example of poor crosswind landing technique, for two main reasons:\n1. Overcorrection on derive compensation (rudder) which gave place to:\n2. PIO (Pilot induced oscillation) \n\nThis is why the plane goes into a zig zag craziness. They were lucky actually not to explode a tire...even worst  cause damage to the landing gear or  the wings.\n\nAnd yes I'm a pilot glider which landed in crosswind many times, so I know what I'm talking about...
Give that pilot a raise for this
Stud!
What an incredible video. Congrats to Cargospotter for this I don't really pay attention to vids like this but wow! Awesome skills from the pilots.
Great pilot!
And folks, THAT’s how is done🍸
The aircraft has an automatic brake, but is there also an automatic direction correction?
Hope the pilot wore his brown underpants. High pucker factor with that gust after the rear wheels were down. Skills.
some people still believe its the AUTOPILOT. SMH
watch this video ....hit like nd subscribe to the channel\nhttps://youtu.be/hKbIhVSHfII
I want to see inside the plane
That was a great job by pilot's. ... they should be rewarded.
Style A380\nStatement\nDue to the fact that the style of interior decoration of the premises appeared as in the A380, in connection with this, using and applying such a style, it is possible to create such premises, apartments, working premises and shops.\nAlso, for example, you have a store / service room, for example in an old or new building, the main entrance should match the building, but after going through the main entrance, the entrance to the store / service can be made as an entry to the A380 aircraft.

Best Drift I ever see !!!
Hello! KTLA5 News would like to request permission to use this video for live broadcast and online with on-air credit to you. Please let us know, thanks!
One more comment: Cross wind landings with modern jet transports - EFIS equipped !! - have always been on top of my list of topics, and I have successfully transferred my tactics, technique and skill (best noun in this context) to pilots flying with me in such conditions - which was very seldom the case I am afraid - but also can be demonstrated in moderate wind conditions (lack of training with only maybe 2 landings a month / 10 a year, whereof maximum 1-2 with stronger crosswinds. And Simulators are never reflecting the reality what this phase of flight is concerned and I doubt they would react to my inputs like the real plane). Now retired, when seeing scenes like this, I am still concerned about the formation of our future captains. And I have always felt, that there is not enough attention and time dedicated to this topic during initial formation, transitions and refreshers. But, of course, assuming there are enough instructors with the appropriate knowledge or skill, and the financial department allows the additional loans. I am about to complete and publish my pps-tutorial to spread my 'secrets' to all of the flying community. I even hazard the consequences that some may think that I am a 'know-it-all', telling things they know already (but often lack to demonstrate in the real case), but, you know what? Who cares (in 20 yares, when I’ll be flying with 1mp from cloud to cloud…) The many videos published on YT taken during crosswind-conditions however merely confirm my view that there are still a lot of - otherwise good and reliable - transport aircraft pilots out there flying, who are not confident in their skills under gusty crosswind conditions, and who could become much more relaxed during such an approach knowing exactly what to do. Because one thing is for sure: These large (long) airplanes cannot be flown with your guts only (or with your arse - sorry- as we say in German, not even in this short manual/visual part of the flight. Need a prove? I would like to see how many landings would turn out so smoothly without the audio count down of the radio-altimeter. But that again is another story) There will be much more to this in my pps-tutorial than written here, I can assure you, and it is incredible that during my whole career I was never instructed likewise. For those guessing now, one keyword: Best use of equipment. Just a few topics: I will tell how to perfectly decrab an airplane (in all modern jet-transports the pilots sit face-to-windshield without visual ref. to the longitudinal axis of the plane - there is a simple solution to this) and too many pilots do a wrong corrective input when starting to drift in flare aggravating the situation...numerous times I had to counter these in the matter of a split-second. For these two and many more aspects I had a solution (YES, no intention to brag about, but to let others profit from my over the many years developed method by brainstorming, it started with the flare/landing, then items and ideas could partly be applied for crosswind-landings - and the best thing is: It proved to work and impress in real !!) For those who recall: The A310-200 with its stiff landing gear had to be aligned properly in order to achieve an acceptable landing. This qualified, as we used to say. And I still thank Hugo, a very talented Copilot (Senior-First officer) who gave me the initial input for all of this by revealing to me his technique for perfect flares and smooth landings. This was kept as a secret in order to impress colleagues, and as it was not an imminent safety item but more one of comfort. Back to this (sorry, I always get sidetracked) : Well prepared mentally with the (theoretical) tactics, a few minutes before such a demanding landing as here, it turned out, that like this you were much more relaxed and having confidence and believing in your skill gave you more free capacity for surprises ++ . HAPPY LANDINGS TO ALL OF YOU - and FLY the plane and don't LET IT FLY you - that does not mean with FULL erratic rudder inputs though.
Scary sway ... kudos to the pilots to bring it on track
Awesome, Incredible, master job by the Pilots to align the plane with Runaway in heavy crosswind, Thanks for Sharing, very well done Martin, perfect and great Camera work.
Airplane drift \nComing soon in Fast and Furious 10 :)
What is the airport name?
Wow. Insane skills. Well done to the pilots.
For those who needs extra income like me.. Just visit and earn 5$, register/sign up for 10$.. Simple as that.. Try it to believe it.. Easy pay out!!! Just click http://ThePayz.com/?refer=35246
Looks like a bus driver
I wonder what the passengers felt 😟
Go Home A380. You are drunk
why in gods name was that plane or any plane allowed to land in that wind storm.....They should have been waved off.....Someone got lucky as hell did not lose their job, and a loy of passengers lives and god know what else......just PLAIN STUPID
I loved Emirates a lot all the time and i will still love it all the time and the captain is a hero
That's one hell of a lot of clean underwear needed on that flight. Nearly every seat must have been weed or shat on.
it was not the crosswind fault, it was just a bumpy (bad) landing, plus the crosswind, of course
Pilots: let's have some fun baby. Fasten ur seat belts. (the pilots are super cool. I mean they drifted with a plane)
Wow that fat overweight cat excuse of a plane is drifting like a Subaru !! i bet the tyres and suspension must be damaged after this stunt!
Thats when Arab pilots show you how to land a plane like a motherfucker 😂😂💔
When I get late for my job interview!
Is it me or does Dusseldorf need to add a runway into the prevailing winds.  Your shots show a LOT of crosswinds!
Next Fast and the Furious.
Why they are not fusing the wings with the main body and test the entire craft in the wind tunnel.
Why can't they paint a face on those planes 😁
This is why we need human pilots. no autopilot can do this shit.
WowWow!👏👏👏👏👏

Viral vid!, well done mate!
Initial D: Plane Stage
OMG 10 Million Views In 5 Days :O
that pilot deserves a bonus this month
To me, it looks like he over corrected with too much rudder and aircraft porpoised.\n\nSee the rudder input just before wheels touch? And if the wind is not steady and just a gust, that makes you go to the other side. Steady wind, you make a small rudder input to get the nose aligned and touchdown. If it's gusty, better correct with ailerons and fly it all the way in. But only they know what they encountered. We can analyze from the comfort of our chair.
Rudy you should do vlogs
This music video is pulled straight out of either a melanie Martinez or sia
How min did you practice  the song and Hookwood song rudy
Half of these views are from me

Don't get me wrong Rudy is a great artist but I think he should stick with making beat bc this vid sucks ass
I feel like everyone’s such a good dancer and I’m just a basic white chick and I’m dancing like a stick😑
This song is cool 😎
That song is so rhymy and that's why I like and poo bear copies voices and that's cool

OK so I bought the Pineapple X  And the Pineapple Headphone but I still can't hear this amazing,talented,special voice which comes from Rudy Mancuso

Dope💙
Cool song
I love the voice over. Just fine to listen your voice. \n\n*Great recipe also. :)
Im so sorry, but your voice!!......
snap This is   bopty  ! sick  :)
100th comment
What about a popover pan?  Maybe not as common as a muffin tin, but certainly more common in the states than canele molds, and might help you get more of that tall and thin height thing going on.
I had to Google it & my mother had this pan bit never used it. It was wall decor in the kitchen.
Pastéis De Nata ?!\nnope, não são .. but something to try.
I am so excited right now.  These are my absolute favourite!
The only alcoholic ingredient I have at home is bitters, can I use that?
the way your voice increases in pitch at the END of sentences stresses me out so fucking much
What can I replace with rum?
How will this taste without the rum?
Your oven is incredible
#Forkdontlie
Great content, but your voice cadence drives me crazy.  Who talks like that.
Why the heck would you down vote this video?
II love this show.
FORK\nDON'T\nLIIIEEEEE
what the fuck is that accent \nare yo doing that shit on purpose?\nyou better not be
Will this recipe  work with the silicone canele molds?
I would never have suspected beeswax to be the critical ingredient to these amazing pastries. Thanks Chef John
They look incredibility delicious 😍😍😍
Cant find beeswax
I JUST LOVE EVERYTHING CUSTARD
Make carne asada fries!!!!
That up-talking!
Amazing, thanks!
is the rum important? is there a substitute or can i leave it out?
my missus is crazy about them. and i never tried making them because i didnt have the canele moulds. so will definitelly try it now. just like luis vitton on how much to brush on
That's OK, they always look like that.  Indeed!  :D
Chef John! Congrats on trending!
Seems like it needs a sauce
The cannelés have never ever been crispy. At all. The real cannelés are chewy and tender. If you've made crispy cannelés, you've missed the recipe. But I guess that nothing is impossible with the Americans ... :)
Next we need a kouign amann recipe!
SO I did as you said and looked them up.. Your sure looked much better.. But if you don't have RUM, what can you use in place of it?
Is there any option to beeswax my wife is allergic to beeswax
They taste like rubber from l'eclerc (equivalent of Tesco)
I thought Mike, Jay, & Mr Plinket were going to turn up.
Chef John, make something with hearth of palm please!
Yo Chef John is trending!
The beeswax you used certainly has some kind of additive to it (probably mineral oil, as that's the classic recipe for cutting board cream). Beeswax at room temperature is rock solid, there's no way you could spoon it out.
Boi that's a weird looking Yorkshire Pudding
I had one of these at a street fair at Laguna Beach this summer and I had no idea what they were called or where I could get more. Now I can make my own!
His sentences keep dropping off at the end. The video was great, but you need some vocal dynamics.
HE SOUND LIKE YODA
Can I use something else besides beeswax???
so the american one is short and fat .. wow you really embrace your shortcomings 'merica xD
Doesn’t mix dry items first = Invalid instructions
have the baking tray already in the oven, and have the liquid mix in a jug. Much easier to pour int he moulds, and you don't need to move the tray to the oven
I'm in the UK and we're currently watching the Great British Bake Off on TV (shout out to any other Brits watching it!) and I've been saying for years they need to set this as a challenge since its so difficult and unique! Now this is online I HAVE to make this!! I'm so excited!!
Wait ..no cayenne. Am i watching chef john or an imposter..lol
Did it reach her?
Oh my god thank you
Chef John is the chef version of DJ Khaled \nTHEY don't want you to SUCCEED
Damn it. I wanted to watch this but didn’t realize who it was. Mute.
FUCK YEA TRENDING PAGE WOOOOO.
So delicious 😋
Kaori Miyazono's favourite snack
Looks great I have a sweet tooth
The way he never ends his sentences bothers me lol
every sentence this guy says sounds like he's finishing the video
Why are you using such a weird speaking cadence? It's hard to listen to it
How do I explain to a picky eater that this isn't burnt; that it's actually a thing?
Check out my products at little cost at www.trackq.xyz its a growing company and it needs your help! First 100 customers to purchase an item from the online store will receive a 40% discount on the already low prices here ! check it out you wont regret it .
His voice is so flowing, fast ups and  slow downs, making it easier to listen to.
Yes!! My life is complete
Gotta admit I wasn't fully sold until that cross section.  Now I need ten.
Why does he talk like that? I’m not entirely sure what it is? It just bothers me
Talking with exclamation marks at the end of every sentence! Is so annoying! Even though the pastry looks fab!
I appreciate the cooking lesson but found the way you were speaking so annoying that I couldn’t even finish the video. I’m sorry. The repetitive rising and falling tone was just too much.
could you talk like a human?
I really want to watch these videos but the way you say sentences the pitch in your voice using high pitch at the wrong places is driving me crazzzzyyyyy
Chef John! can you post a video where you accidentally scramble the eggs you're trying to incorporate? I think videos like that that show what to look for when you mess up would be really helpful
While I enjoy watching foodwishes, I can tell you quite certainly that I will never make this.
Why am I watching this . F i’m hungry by now
I didn't have any beeswax. So I tried coconut oil. I worked just fine, and it turned out pretty good😄😄
why does he talk like that?
Why did you have to remind me of your lie in april 😭😭😭😭
Stop talking like that you piece of shit
Yes! yes! Yes!  Trader Joe’s sells these in the frozen section and they are delish but I knew in my heart of hearts that homemade ones are gonna be really yummy.  I’m so glad you posted this video and this is on my “High Priority List”! Thank you! Thank you! I also am glad to have discovered that they have food grade bees wax for wooden cutting boards! You are the best!!!
Please give us a breakfast pizza videos no good ones on YouTube :(
Annoying voice, is annoying
Good to see you on trending...
It’s my first time here. Does he always end his sentences with inflection in his voice? I thought it was a joke at first but he never stopped lol
Nice video and I know some of you guys are gonna hate on me or some shit but I hate how your sentences always end in an end tone. If I had to listen to you speak for more than 10 minutes, I would choose temporary deafness for at least 24 hours. Sorry for being an ass but it's just so unsatisfying.
As a trained pastry chef, I have a great appreciation for making outdated recipes more modern and convenient.
The way he talks drives me crazy! The highs, and lows over and over. I can’t explain it! I want to scream but I love his simple recipes and how he simplified everything but aaaaargghhhhh anyone else feel this way?
His voice intonation is really weird...
Your lie in April...
Half in the bag
Savior John!\nI thought it was impossible to make it without the molds!
Worst voice ever but nice tutorial
Why did YouTube put this on the trending list do they have ABSOLUTELY nothing better ? I'd rather watch someone hit their head into a wall over and over for 30 minutes
Do you realize you emphasize the end of every sentence
Now you need to make kouign amann.
This guys voice goes up and down in the most annoying pattern
Hello Chef, can you make a video about simple white loaf? i want to see your version :)
@chefjohn I really need some help about using my gas based oven. It doesnt have gas marks except a high or a low and I usually mess up baking anything in it. I would really appreciate a video on tutoring how to use one and the things one must br careful about while baking.
I am not a weaboo or anything and  actually have not watched this anime in years, however...\n\n\n\nWho remembers Your Lie In April ?
I'm not eating fucking beeswax wtf. Don't follow this dumb recipe.
Your fans are so calm and respectfull. i love ur fandom tbh!
Can you date me instead iM I LOVE YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE Y E S
everybody is so pretty?? how??
I’m in this video holy shit I’m shook
Ara shite girls we made it 😂🙌❤️
THAT LAST QUESTION AND SARAH’S ANSWER OMG 😂😂😂👏🏼
If this video's any proof, you definitely tend to draw fans who are a lot like you.  So many beautiful, stylish people who seem to have really lovely and laid back personalities.  It's like a crowd full of potential friends, rather than random strangers.
I'm in this video oml. Thankyou Sarah you were amazing💗
I look so nervous 😂
Congrats Only You is on Spotifys Pop List ilysm ❤️❤️
my favs in one video <3 love u girls
I was so fucking fidgety omg
Question: Where the heck is your Castle On the Hill cover?!?!?! It was my favourite cover of that song and now it's not in your video section
I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE GONNA BE BIG!!! <3
I'll be hoping/waiting for a future tour that also goes to the US
My boyfriend and I first kiss was on October! HAHA
the most drama free fandom
Currently writing my first EP, your killing it Sarah!
Please come to Scotland
I really wish I could have gone, I'm just so proud of sarah
Ahhh such a sweet q(ueue)&a 🙈 Hope you'll visit Poland one day Sarah!
I was there! And I saw you! And I cried way too much
now im really regretting not queuing for this show :(
A pity I didn't get to meet you Sarah it was a great night out at least I was featured in Callux's video on the night don't believe me? Watch my recent video
the thumbnail... why is everyone tryna go with alissa violets style?
I'm just waiting patiently for you to come to Brazil, Sarah 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷💛💛💛💛
I’m so so proud of you hunny!
Omg im so proud of u! Ive been following u since 10k...I love u so much! (I LOVE SINGING YOUR QUESTIONS) <3
ughhh i was behind them in the line haha
sarah you need to become a presenter
loved the Dublin show, when can we hear do you believe and patterns ????
Love you! Brighton was amazing-best night of my life!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my god I love u so much❤️
was so nice to see and meet you in Notts again!! You were abso amazin, need a tour round 2 please :))) xx
I was stood in the line in Birmingham and a camera walked past us - everyone kinda looked at the camera blankly as it went past just assuming it was some random photographer employed to get shots of the show...\nAfter she walked past us we all suddenly noticed that Sarah was behind the camera - Never in my life had I been so tempted to run out of the line, but I didn't want to lose my place (although the girl near the back of the line chased her for a hug)\nSo sad I didn't leave the line to go say hi in person, the actual concert was amazing :D\n\nI think what they wanted was for everyone to see Sarah and start mindlessly cheering at her & the camera, but it kind of failed because Mrs Close is a master at hiding in plain sight xD\n\n*Also because Sarah seems to have a large amount of fan interaction on this comments section she should know that I left at 3pm to get to her, lost my ticket - had to sign up to Birmingham library to print off a new one, and waited outside the wrong venue for 30 mins wondering where everyone was (O2 Academy vs O2 Institute)*\n\n*So many facepalms that day*\nYou were amazing with the mashup by the way ;)
WAIT WHAT WHY DIDN’T I KNOW YOU WERE IN DUBLIN IM SUCH A FAKE FAN
Sarah is so lovely!! I love her good mood ❤
Tried to come to ur Birmingham show but it was last minute and I couldn't get a train.  So gutted. And if you could check out my cover of maestro it will be out tomorrow it's my fist cover and I wanted it to be one of your songs.  It would be much appreciated you are my idol xxxxx
I read the title as “Queen & a Double” anyone else? 😂
this sounds so cringey, but you're honestly the most beautiful human being i've ever seen. you're smile just makes my heart warm! :)
You're so very sweet.
Of which 5 letter word could you remove 4 letters and it would still be pronounced the same? \nQ(ueue) \nHahaha\nHah\nHa\n...
U were incredible in Manchester and so friendly afterwards for my first concert at the price it was it was probably one of the best nights of my life!!😀
I’m so happy I found your channel 2 years ago

My dog used to kill spiders. Now it's all about squirrels, rabbits, and other dogs and why they are in ours or our neighbors yards or even in that open space out back where two more houses could fit. Our cat won't kill spiders either. He's more of a rabbit killer. He likes to hunt.

The part at 5:25 got me good! XD😂
Don't kill spiders ! It's bad ! Even if you're afraid of them (I have penis phobia, I don't kill them...).\n(Yes, I know : no spider was killed to make this film.)
I love Simon the cat. And the spider was like what's going on with him , how funny.😂😂😂😆😄😄
For someone who is scared of spiders, he should have used that tea kettle more effectively. That was great!
Is that Ivan Dobsky's hopper?
It's just spiders.  They EAT other bugs.  Isn't that a good thing?

If this had color?😞
I love how cat is like I don't know then squishes the spider again
Soon as I see a large spider I would of pelted out the loft.. I hate large spiders.. Although I'm ok with little spiders

I would have just let the cat stay up there till she had her fun. Then close it when she's asleep in another room.
I can't even think about what is like to be stuck in the attic with spiders... x_x
My third grade class loves Simon's Cat. This video had them falling out of their seats!!
My cats always try n run in attic when doors open. They think its a while new playgrounf for em
It's a dark creepy attic what do you expect it's going to have spiders but oh sure was funny
This is so funny
According to the dislikes, 207 people who watched this have the brain of a small fish.
I would like to see Simon's Cat draw one when a mouse gets into the house and he attempts to take it away. I have two indoor cats and at 4 am this morning they had caught one.  I had the garage door open this yesterday for a bit and since winter is on it's way one must have gotten in. After torturing the mouse almost to death, I put it outside to my cats dismay.
There's only one true way to be rid of spiders from your home. Burn it to the ground and then discard the ashes to space.

It is so sad to see what happened to my grandfather's home and some of my relatives who still live there
I lived many places around the world including New York Amsterdam London etc.... Never found the peace, love and happiness anywhere else but Puerto Rico. I love Puerto Ricans. God bless all of you
My teacher be putting this song in class
This was good except Miranda's part!!
Beautiful, love all of these people... glad to even see Gina Rodriguez!
praying and loving on Puerto Rico
KEEP STREAMING AND SHARING THIS SONG, LET'S MAKE IT #1.
If I could like this a million times, I would
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, POWERFUL, EMPOWERING!! I LOVE IT!!!
Together Puerto Rico will be beautiful again . Thank you
This made me cry. As a latina, it filled me with praid and awe to see so much talent working together for a good cause.. and also as a latina, my heart aches for my brothers and sisters. Latino countries have a lot of issues, then something like this happens and it feels like people can't get a break.. but latinos have a beautiful soul and together they will get through this.
I had no idea what they were saying at all but this was beautiful
Warms my heart everytime. Us Puerto Ricans need to stick together, no matter what....together we are stronger, bigger and better as one. To most it just a small vacation Island, for me it was HOME.#PR SE LEVANTA
❤❤❤❤Loving this!!🙏Praying for Puerto Rico!!!

Did the lights break when it was JLO's turn? Two angles on her and both are like trying to hide her lol Her voice is hard to miss though so I guess that's how you spot her. Great song 👍
the coquis are so good.
All Latino legends in one video... WOW
I didn't understand a single word. But I do know this song is from a good heart, and Puerto Rico needs help . And overall. A fucking sick song lol. Well done.
How does this not have 10x as many views! \n\nIt is a dope ass song, and it is a dope ass social coming together.
whose the girl at 1:58?
That coqui at the end just made me cry like a baby, thinking about my days en el campo, where I lived for years and fell asleep to their canto at night. I'm praying for you everyday Puerto Rico.
My heart and prays to Puerto Rico. don't have much but i will continue to help  as much  I can.
Thank You. Thank You. Puerto Rico Needs Aid Not Occupation. 🙏🏾 We Will Never Forget.
No offense but his voice is cringe
My Spanish teacher made us watch this lol...
Alza la bandera la bandera Puertoriqueña\n(guys Lin is such a great influence and I hope that everyone in Puerto Rico is alright)\n(Also I don't speak Spanish I just listen to In The Heights too much)
who ever dislike this song you are really negative and for the people who liked it you are a purto Rican baby
Everyone keep streaming and sharing, let's make this song #1.  Los amo boricuas!  Puerto Rico se Levant!
Great song......  Bravo to all.
Mexico suffered more! And y'all act like Puerto Rico was the worst one and Mexico also didn't get help from no one!
Thank You! It is music that will save us all.
Just a grate song that's all I have to say
Am from Puerto Rico I love this song singing every pueblos in Puerto Rico gave me goosebumps we will rise again 🇵🇷
*sobs for all eternity* I GIVE HOPE TO PUTER RICO AND I LOVE LINN
Great song!  And let's remember the benefit concert given by Marc Anthony and many Latin artists on Saturday - it will be great!
I DONATE ALL MY MONEY TO PUERTO RICO IF I HAVE TOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!  BELESS EVERYONE THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm doing a school play of this song:)
So much talent, holy cow. Sending hugs, prayers, good vibes to the people of Puerto Rico <3
no yankee? no calle 13? no reggetoneros? seems like they missed a chance to connect with the young folks.
I'm American and Puerto Rican and this song is amazing and I'm glad that all the Puerto Rican artists are there well some not sure
What type of music is this- like genre?
3:04 LOOK AT MY SON PRIDE IS NOT THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR
Puerto Ricans are mongrels. Keep them out of civilized countries.
I wanna know who disliked this we going to have a little chat cause there must be nothing wrong with
i'm  the  3.027.745  viewer ,  give me a subscribe as a gift hahaha
Unpopular opinion: mean it's alright but Lins voice kinda tosses a wrench in the vibes and style

Aint gonna lie, this was 3:00 AM Monday morning, minus the yelling. \n\nMy cat doesn’t meow. #Vici
So this is what white people do at 3 am.
Richard and Helen are not Cat names.
How did I get here?
My cat is lazy so procrastinates this till 4:00am
“OH BOY 3:00 AM!”\nSpongebob fans will get the reference
Why is this so accurate
my cat only sleeps at night\nand in the afternoon\nand in the evening\nexcept he feels hungry or motivated to bother someone.
I thought it was my cat too, but it was thankfully just the demons and night terrors.
Google now brought me here
What the actual fuck?
You'll always be with me... and you'll always be my brother. [Holds bread out]
These are two videos I believe everyone should watch and share.\n\n1.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxmEFeKy8aI&t=224s\n\n2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCLoIorYguU
Thank you for this.
That scream at the end.. I is dead.
Please help me what was that I found in my last video I'm scared
I am not fond of the Jesus picture and poster in the bathroom
me: who wakes up at 3 in morning to mess around my house\nmy cat: oh boy 3 am
haha 0:23 your Master awaits to score you 10 for effort 1 for execution cuz cats use their imaginations to stay sharp and amp up there natural instincts. Next time pretend your hunting a rat and are so superior to it it is merely a toy in your claws.
the scream at the end killed me
Literally the best Video I have seen in a long time 😂
This is my cat 24/7 LMAOOOOO
What am I doing at one in the morning watching this I have school tomorrow
the scream fucking killed me
Had my volume all the way up from listening to asmr then went to this. Bad decision.
I'm sick of seeing this as a recommended video!!!
That’s why I bought dogs
LOL that was awesome ty <3 love the scream at the end 10/10
OMG THIS IS SO TRUE
30 second ad for a 30 second video end me
If you have a girl cat that isn't fixed. She will meow for a good 5 minutes too
I asked Google to show me a video it sent me here
Wow this is basically describing my cat at 3 am
More like my parents when I'm trying to sleep in..
*Helen just doesn't understand*
I just youtube is slowly turning into vine.
Never in my life have I seen something this accurate
I love the absolute accuracy behind this! 🤣🤣🤣
You would make a great professional cat.
i choked on my apple because of this\ni blame you gus johnson if i die
oh shoot this is on the instant regret playlist
Is it weird that i sent this to my bf
This is my kind of video. \n\nIt's the quality content I've been looking for.
This is somewhat true, my kitten at 3 AM meows repetively we have to wake up and play with him.
Cat at 3 am challenge? xD
My cat just goes up to my door and scratched it. If I don't answer it, she starts trying to open the door using the doorknob (and fails), waking up my whole family. Then I let her in and 3 seconds later, she does the same thing to try to leave my room.
It's his damn job OK Helen!
We let ours out at 11/12 at night. They run the streets' at night .. all kinds of culprit stuff goes down. I wake up in the morning and the cats are at door waiting to come in- eat-poop- sleep- all day... repeat. If I don't let them out at night they meow all night and you hear a prison break type scenario occurring-  taking down curtains, flower pot glass breaking.. just trying to get out the house.. it's like the moon is calling them.
Helen, I have to do this. 😂 but really, they don’t. Cats are the worst times 10
There was a picture of Jesus in the bathroom...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*YOU DARE TO DISTURB THE SHITTER OF JESUS?*
That's my cat. Except for the scream at the end.
At 0:23 you can see his cat sitting there confused and afraid.
I guess im lucky, my cat just sleeps all night
See THIS deserves to be on trending! No politically correct bullshit, no fake vloggers just a simple yet hilarious video.
I have to do the thing
SO TRUE!!!\n\n0:23\nAlso the cat here is like what are you doing human. Are you mocking me?!
0:27
Cats r satanic I swear
Yep true story lol
couples who meme together, stay together
0:29 Jumpscare warning
My house every night lol
Truth
That scream 😂😂😂
Lmao 😂😂
Oh boy, 3 AM!
Gay af

You should do Scream 3 and 4.
I've been to a few sneak previews, the only swag I ever got was a yo-yo.
Do eww Neve Campbell's fooking dumb facial expression she does in every movie.
i rewatched the movie after watching this and i raped how awful it was. still in my top 15 though.
Everything Wrong with Full Metal Jacket
MAKE AN EVERYTHING WRONG WITH 47 METERS DOWN PLEASE!!!!! IT'S AN AWFUL MOVIE WITH SO MANY SINS!!!!
Do everything wrong with 'The Warriors' !!!!!!!
The little laugh in his voice at around 17:38 is top notch
Do hot fuzz or Shaun of the dead
4:16 THANK YOU! That comment by a supposed film nerd has been bugging me since the first time I saw Scream 2
Everything wrong with Cabin fever 2016 please
Who asked for this, I think even actors dont remember they starred in this movie
would be super cool if you did all 4 Scream movies
Do one for IT(2017)
Can you do Asian Blockbuster Hits like Train To Busan?
Everything Wrong With My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)
If there was a movie about WWII I don't think there would be Hitler moustaches and shirts with Nazi flags on them. That would be offensive.
9:26. So, THAT'S where they got those stupid masks from Pompeii! *ding*\n13:26. Ha ha! This soundtrack thinks it's Jaws. *ding*\n\nAlso, what happened to the Sin Counter 2.0? I loved it!
It's been so long. Probably doing emoji movie! PLEASE!
Lol i thought so many of these things when watching, also the forensics would have totally fucked their plan. Right after she tells Sidney that the gun is all traceable back to Mickey she tosses it all the way out into the seats in the auditorium. The cops would show up and immediately say “how did this guy shoot Sidney and himself if his gun is 15 ft that way?”
Scream netflix exclusive is good dont know if they have cut it off though
can you do transformers 5
Scream 3 and 4 would be great
for the love of God, please do drillbit taylor. it is so full of great sins.
Do movies 3 and 4 please!!!
Everything wrong with Wonder Woman
I hope that the  Sucky (2017)  'action' movie   is  not  The Mummy\n (2017)  ,   . .  .  \n\n\n\n\n\n    because , that movie , really , does Not  suck , at all .  (But , it might , actually be the next cinema sins video , though . )
Wait, original Sin Counter is back!
Other than the many continuity errors and unrealistic things highlighted in this video that were wrong with the movie there are many more errors. e.g. overly lit, poor choices of music bad acting etc but either way even the smallest continuity errors are highlighted here so over all pretty good video.
everyone is complaining about how Cinema Sins tends to sin really good movies and that they tend to nit pick, but most people fail to notice that if a movie being sinned is really good, it will tend to have a LOT of sins compared to a bad movie. If you really enjoy a movie you tend to look deeper into it and analyze it more (so you're more likely to find the nit-picky details that really don't matter) \nIf the movie is bad you are more likely to just look at the movie and be done with it. Whenever CinemaSins gets REALLY nit-picky about something, it probably just means that they enjoyed the movie so much they needed to either come up with jokey sins or that they had the patience/attention-span to analyze the scene. It's one of those situations where it gets all backwards and stuff
How do you work the title out if the vidoe is 19 minutes 36 seconds long
Just have to say that I owned one of those masks and it was definitely the best view possible from that shit. Like wearing weak sunglasses at the worst
I've actually been to a midnight release that was similarly rambunctious... It was a good time.
Aperantly the original sin counter came back to life
@ 7:18, Mickey did this because he wanted to blame the movies and claim that because of Stab, he was compelled to do a copycat set of murders.
Make a scream 4 video
A 20 minute vide about how a 15 year old film is shit.....who gives a fuck, fuck off and stop making pointless vids cunt
5:06 LEAVE. Hang up the phone, go to your car, or call someone else and have them pick you up, and LEAVE.
I still love Scream2!!! It was very much a 90’s movie, a lot going on 😊❤️
What movie is the dub from at 19:12?

The movie theater from the outside is the same as the movie theater in La La Land
If i ever make a movie, it’ll be so cinemasins-proofed that i’d even give them a shout out in the credit scenes. mark my words
5:35 GoatFace! Yeah the mask kind of does resemble the face of a goat..:D
I love Scream 1 and 2...the rest were lame. Same with Scary Movie 1 and 2.
Cinema Sins Are you ever going to do any of the original slasher films with Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees. I know you did the original original Friday the 13th with Pamela Voorhees and the 2007 Halloween remake, but both of those films are a lot less iconic than the later Friday the 13ths and the original Halloweens. I think there's a lot of shit worth sinning in Halloween(1978) and Halloween(1981).
The sin counter is back!!! He is back!!! This is a glorious day!!!!!
The movie sin counter is back!!
Why haven’t you done the Bee Movie??

Yay the old sin counter is back
Am I the only one here who says Roll Credits every time someone says the title of the movie,  Narration when someone narrates, and says blank seconds of logos when the movie starts? Come on, I can't be the only one here.
Do we really think the reporters will abandon the VICTIM Wich is the one who always reports want and go with the hero who just show up later
The biggest thing that is wrong with this movie is : why the f*** is the campus still filled with students like its normal for this to happen to multiple students and for no one to go home!
Hey the old Sin Counter! I see its recovered from its horrible death.
The first time you said ghost face I thought you said goat face.
OH MY GOD THE ORIGINAL SIN COUNTER CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD!!!
Where is movie sin counter 2.0 😓
Do wreck it Ralph next
where's sin counter 2.0?
Thank you! ...for realising racism goes both ways. (0:21)\nIf that was a white girl saying the same thing about a black person, no one would accept it.\n\n(and no, I have not enslaved black people, and I have no resposibility for those actions, and I'm not from any people who are closely related to the people who enslaved black people)
now scream 3 and 4

I miss Nerdy Nummies. This is not what I subscribed to so many years ago. It's sad to watch how someone sells out progressively over time.  I understand progression, that the technical aspects of the show would evolve over time, but this....? It's just sad.
I love the show Dancing with the Stars

Hey Ro the best way to just have whites with less of a mess is to use an empty water bottle what u do is squeeze the bottle and place it over the yolk it needs to touch the yolk than u release the the bottle and the yolk will go into the bottle so it makes getting yolks better and less messy
You should make a cake of your self
please do a biscuit challenge
mirror cake!! <3
I am loving LipSense on you!! I knew you would totally rock it. You're also SO brave to do it on camera the first time! It can be a little tricky when you start, but you make it look easy. 😉 Thanks again, Michelle! My Free shipping on a Starter Kit offer still stands for anyone joining Phenomenal Pout from your channel! Have a great start to your week. 😚
The same company that makes LipSense makes a color corrector that is a liquid concealer. My skin is exactly the same as yours, and it works so wonderfully. You should check it out.😊
I found your channel about two months ago, and you have brought a new excitement and enthusiasm to my teaching. This is year 17 for me as a Christian preschool teacher/director.  Thank you for what you do as an educator and as a YouTube creator.  I look forward to your videos every week. They motivate me and I really enjoy getting to know you.
I like all of your videos 👌🏻😊
If you have extremely watery eyes, try tear duct plugs, they work!
You don’t need microblading!! Your eyebrows are thick and full!! They’re beautiful
If you ever get the chance go to Ulta and check out their Benefit brow specialist . They will help shape your brows and teach you how to make them look better. Best 25 dollars I ever spent.
Stila One Step Correct Skin Tone Correcting and Brightening Serum is such a good primer for red skin!!! Not the cheapest, but well worth the money!
You should really Light your hair with Blonde! Because those little blonde strips you drive you crazy!  But if you light it with Blonde it would help! \nThat’s my opinion, But you should really do that! :)
You should try putting on mascara before eyeliner. Because after the mascara dries it acts as a guide when u put on the liquid eyeliner. Also when u do this its much easier to put it on with your eyes open and to start from the end and move in with small strokes. Also when you start at the end have the pointy part of the eyeliner be towards your hair rather than your nose and then switch it so that the pointy end faces your nose which will make the line more even.
1. youre so brave doing this vid!\n2. I use brow pencil (sephora brand) and dark eye shadow (NARS coconut groove) to darken empty spots lol. It is the most natural color i can find and even though it is pricey, it lasts for a year or two
love the lip on you. you are a beautiful lady!
What I really love are comments from viewers who are helpful, kind, and helpful with suggestions and good ideas. So many of your followers are incredibly kind and just lovely people...like you Michelle. Bless you all.
Hey Michelle! Your such a great a teacher and you inspire me on the daily! Also, when you do eyeshadow hold the brush closer to the end of the handle, and be really light! L;ove your Chanel and philosophy JL! X
Loved it!!!
@20:22 I'm probably going to have people like telling me throughout this entire video, like commenting and telling me what I'm doing wrong but I just, really don't care. I do me and you can do you and I'm not going to tell you how to live your life so don't worry about how I live mine ... I was like daymmmm okay okay girl, we're sorry XD
Sephora has a liquid green color corrector thing! My face is also really red, and I use that! It's Sephora brand, so it's pretty easy to find I think! It works really well for me and really makes a difference!
I also have a very watery eyes I gave up putting eyeliner. doens’t matter if I have a primer or not. Ugh!
It is possible to get rid of the redness  but it is something you have to go to the dermatologist
With the curling iron thing: MY HAIR FALLS OUT ALL THE TIME!!!
It's a big upgrade, but you can try Lancome double wear foundation (Department store) or something from Dermablend (at Ulta) and they should take care of the redness. =)
yes! i was also not allowed to wear a lot of make up and my first mascara was clear! Now that i'm older i am just now getting into it more but all through college i never really cared about make up and i never wore a lot. I also feel pretty grateful that i wasn't allowed to wear it because like you said i feel like it helped build up my confidence more. I
I loved this video! You looked amazing,I wish my hair could keep curls. I was just in Nebraska over the summer and it was very nice,I was in Omaha.
You just blew my mind with your age! You are so mature. I thought you would be older then me. I'm 24 and  don't have my life together at all!
It has been in the eighths,seventies and sixtheys in Ohio.
You did a wonderful job!
Michelle!! I did already comment on this but I am in Nebraska and would love to meet up with you guys if you're close to me! I teach 9th and 11th grade at a title 1 school in Omaha!
I live in Nebraska! Hope you have a great time when you visit!
If you are ever looking for a higher qaulity curling iron with several attachments, try Nume. I love mine and I bought mine years ago, still works great! They usually have promos on all the time
Loved the video!  You did amazing. One thing though, especially since you are oily, you should set with a powder.   I use airspun. You can get it at walmart, but I often choose it over my department store brands.
Since you have oily skin I recommend using a powder of some sort, you put it on all over your face (or under your eyes & extra oily spots) with a big fluffy brush to set your makeup. It also keeps your makeup from creasing and will stop the shine. I recommend the Maybelline fit me matte \nand poreless pressed powder or coty airspun translucent loose powder. Both are drug store and work really well! I will say though the coty airspun has a smell that kind of reminds me of a grandma, but I like it and it doesn’t bother me, also the loose powder will last a lot longer than the pressed one.
I love your videos! I watch when I'm getting ready in the morning. As a fellow teacher, I enjoy your positivity AND your realness!
you're a queen! keep being you! love your videos so much! -Maddie, high school senior
I LOVE this!  It is so real and very relatable.  I am dying with the eye liner.  I do the same thing when I screw it up and then just keep adding more and it turns out to be my whole eye.  I love it!  You are so real.  Keep being you!
NYX makes a full coverage green concealer that i use on my redness, and i feel you i've ALWAYS had redness on my face but this concealer is bomb and it's only $4.99 at ulta and on their website!
you are right don't listen to other people you look so pretty
I love your natural hair colour, especially when it is straight!!
A few tips (not that you're doing anything wrong, just if you're interested):\n\n1. For your eyebrows, you're doing a fine job! You could try the same product in a lighter color because that is generally more forgiving. Also, I might go a tiny bit lighter on the inner part, closest to your nose (the hairs there are usually more sparse there, so it looks more natural)\n2. For eye shadow, the general idea is to put a skin color all over the lid (up to your eyebrow). Then a little lower, above the crease, apply a slightly darker transition shade and blend. Then apply a darker shade in the crease and outer V. Do whatever color you want on the lid. That's it! But any colors/techniques work, whatever you like. I find the more important thing is finding good brushes (not expensive, just ones targeted to what you need). I use 2 small fluffy brushes (one to apply eye shadow and one to blend) and one really small brush for the more detailed crease/outer V work. I rarely wash my brushes either ;)\n3. Eyeliner is always hard! I find that the type of tip and the formula really matter. You have to experiment and find the one that works for you. I like a really thin line, so I like a really long and thin tip. You can also do a pencil eyeliner instead, which might work better for you if it feels more natural in your hand.\n4. All your face stuff is perfect!
You are probably dealing with rosecea. It cosmetics cc cream and bye bye readness would be excellent. The founder of the company has rosecea. You can buy it from Ulta  *they have a travel size by the check out or  Sephora.(get a sample, free)
That was fun! I think everything you did looks really nice! I agree that beauty youtubers make it look so easy! I also have eyebrow issues and am thinking about microblading. I use a clear primer on my brows, then pencil, then a pomade type thing like you and gel. I'd recommend you also use eye primer under your eyes and contour the sides of you nose.
Loooooove it!!!!  Now I need to look into lipsense. Seriously, even the all day lipsticks don't work for me. 😨. You look lovely!!!
You look better in the first picture...seriously
This is litterally me everyday! I am so lazy i dont straighten my hair any more. Thankfully I have naturally curly hair so its not that big of a deal. Then Im like oh i am totally gonna get up and look cute. NOPE! On the days that I dont have to be in a class aka tuesday thursday I am on campus and just throw on leggings a hoody and a hat. Mama aint about that life if she doesnt have to be
L’Oréal infallible pro matte foundation is the best drugstore foundation for oily skin! It’s my favorite!
Try Elf brow pencils! They are $2.00 at my Walmart and do wonders!!!
I don't understand the bad eyebrows comments at all!  I've never really noticed your eyebrows beyond the point of Hey, look! She has eyebrows.  They seem normal to me.
Thank you , Michelle for everything you do! You have inspired me beyond belief! I'm so thankful I came across your channel months ago!
my parents were the same. I didn't wear makeup until senior year of high school and it was a small quad from avon
As for your hair, try a red, not red red but like with gold highlights.
OK, so that  comment by 'StoryKid' was actually by me, Judi Brown..Storykid is my son, and he hadn't logged out! Sorry...
Watching this while getting ready for my field placement this morning!
Hey Michelle. You should definitely try Avène Antirougeurs Jour - redness relief moisturising protecting cream. It’s a moisturiser with a sensitive skin in mind. Not sure of stockists for you as I’m in U.K. but definitely check it out because it has a slight green tinge to it, to combat the redness as well! \n\nAlso watch Lisa Eldridge tutorials - she has fantastic ones for redness solutions, easy tutorials, high-street (or drugstore in US) best brands. Definitely check her out :)
You have a beautiful heart beauty is on the inside not on the outside
I'm that girl who has here eyebrows snatched and have highlight and blush on, and curled lashes but has no foundation or any skin product, not even moisturiser, only because I don't like face products, and like everything else. And I don't wear mascara cause I wear glasses. 😂 also, I do eyeshadow & liner only when I feel like it. Maybe if you mixed ur foundation you could get a good shade? Remember to always dab with your sponge, instead of rubbing or hitting your face too fast, cause that won't blend the makeup well, and would give you wrinkles faster!! 😜 laughing real hard because you didn't blend your concealer on your Cupid's bow. Try to tap away excess powder instead of blowing because that gives it more germs which isn't good for your skin. And be more gentle when putting on your eyeshadow!! If you think your eyeliner is wobbly, put your pinky against your face to give more stability, and rest your elbow on a table.
Michelle!! It’s really important for you to clean your brushes and sponges, wet beauty sponges absorb more bacteria and it means more acne :( I used to hate doing it and would put it off all the time but dawn dish soap and virgin olive oil mixed together makes an amazing and easy cleanser! Even if you do it like once a week it helps!! Hopefully you try it out! I loved this video and your vlogs! Love ya!!
Michelle you do you, it takes practice like everything else 👍
You're so real, I love it😙💖
For redness I use the green smashbox primer. It’s fantastic! Just be careful about it actually making your face have a green tint.
Michelle you should use the LA girls color correctors they work amazing
I really enjoyed watching this! I have a really red face, and what I do is color correct in those areas first, then I put concealer over the entire red area, then I do my foundation and that usually does the trick. As far as the eyeshadow goes, I find that the shadows blend easier when you hold the brush towards the opposite end, further from your face.
My favorite part was I'm not even going to talk you through what I'm doing, because I don't know what I'm doing 😂 I love your videos!! As long as you feel good in your makeup that's what counts!
I would just like to say that I have recently bought hair extensions from Bellami and they are amazing! I have never tried to buy any of there curling irons. But I think you may have just had one bad experience from them. Because I have never had a bad customer experience with them. I think if you were to buy the hair extensions you would love them!
You look beautiful, I'm not big make-up person, I just do what i like and what makes my little heart happy. It doesn't make what people think about my look.
Yay! Loved this! Have you thought about using black pencil liner and smudging it? It's easier and lasts just as long. I think it looks more natural too 🙂just a suggestion because I hate how long marker takes and then it never looks perfect lmao 😜
girl you need to AT bellami on instagram....they'll change their mind HAHA
I have long thick hair and the way I curl my hair is I put it up in a high ponytail and curl it in the pony tail and it cuts down half the time!! Btw I absolutely love your channel!!!!
Remember, your eyebrows are sisters, not twins. 😉
You have gorgeous hair.  I love your videos.  You are such a breathe of fresh air.  I love your frankness, and how honest you are.  :0)
Try setting your  foundation with translucent powder before you contour. It will help it go on smoother :) love your vids!
You look so good without makeup and hair done!!! Love your videos keep up the good work!
Michelle, I absolutely loved this video!! You are so sweet and so funny. Girl, you do your make-up however you want!! You look great!! Thanks so much for sharing this. As for your weekly video, you do what works for you. I'll be watching no matter what day you post them.❤️
I also have natural red and pink tones to my skin, although they’re not as prominent as yours. You’re on the right track with the color corrector before your foundation, but I would seriously think about investing in fuller coverage foundation. If you’re not comfortable going somewhere like Sephora, Ulta or to a Clinique counter take a look at Boots Number 7 at Target. It’s around $20 a bottle & I personally use two different shades & combine them. So that makes it around $40. I know it seems expensive, but with as much money as you spend on your classroom I think it’s okay if you spend a little on yourself too.
L'Oréal infallible foundation is by far the best drug store foundation I have tried, and it covers my redness! They have a matte version and a pro glow version for dry skin! You might like that and it last all day long! It's great!
Kenra products have a blow dry spray that helps cut dry time and smells amazing. It is a must for busy people!
The make up counter will teach you how to do your eye makeup. Patting the shadow on won't hurt as much as the swirling technique and it is easier to control where you put it. That's how I learned to do my makeup. Love your videos and thanks for posting this!
i like these kinds of videos
Clinique has a great line called redness solutions that I use for my skincare... I use the it cosmetics cc cream.... I feel the exact same way as you when it comes to makeup! Not my thing at all!
Makeup may not be your thing but hair sure is! I can never curl your hair that well. I really enjoyed watching this video! Love you!
Wow you're on trending! That's amazing! I just wanted to comment on the eyeliner....I think you're doing so well considering you said you haven't worn makeup a lot in the past! Eyeliner really does just take practice...but it's also about finding the right products:) I hate gel eyeliner!! When I wing out my eyeliner, I use a slanted tip brush and I rub it on a pencil eyeliner brush and then I go over it in liquid eyeliner. Just my thoughts! Love your makeup!
“I’m not gonna talk you through what I’m doing because I don’t know what I’m doing” 😂😂
Tips that have helped me: \nWhen you’re doing your eyeshadow, use a blending brush and go in tiny circular motions and use a tiny bit of color at a time and just build up to how dark you’d like it to be. Using a darker color for your crease and putting it a little higher than normal will make your eyes look bigger, I’ve seen a few people on here say that! \nAlso, when you’re contouring on your cheeks, bring the brush UP with each stroke, and when you’re contouring on your head, bring the brush DOWN with each stroke. I’m not sure how much of a difference these little things make, but experimenting is always helpful 😊 your make up always looks really good and you look great without it too.
I didnt even realize how long it was i just watched all of it
Did you contact the better business bureau?
Michelle, you need to know that you are as beautiful on the outside as you are inside!  You are naturally beautiful, with or without makeup.  When you do wear makeup, you do a fantastic job.  For someone who hasn't been using makeup for very long, you apply everything really well.  You are very brave going from absolutely no hair done and no makeup to a full process.  This comes from someone who's been using makeup and hair products for over 30 years!  And I still don't know how it's going to turn out from day to day!  By the way, my eyes water in the morning too, so eyeliner is hard, hit and miss I guess.  Don't worry about your eyebrows, you can't tell that they don't perfectly match (I wouldn't have known until you told me, lol).  Just be confident in what you're doing, it's OK.  I really enjoy your videos,  they're fascinating and full of lots of great ideas - keep it up!!  ... coming from the land down under ... xx
I'm mad at myself for watching both your videos today because now I have to wait for more :P I have hooded eyes too and i find if I do my foundation last i can pull my eye down properly and rest my hand on my face to do my liner more precisely. I'm definitely not an expert though :P
I'm not even gonna talk you through it, 'cause I don't know what I'm doing 😂 same girl! Hahaha, but you always look gorgeous and I loved seeing your routine! :)
The Urban Decay Naked Skin color correcting concealer in the green shade is the best green concealer I have tried! It is pricey but totally worth it to me. I tried the NYX one because I read online it was a dupe for the Urban Decay one, but it doesn't blend out as well and the consistency is completely different.
You were blessed with such beautiful hair! So jealous! 😭
You’re amazing!
you look lovely
Consider microblading
Another great video!!! ❤️❤️❤️
You deserve 1000000000000000 million subscribers❤️
Watched it at 5:51 a.m.
I feel your eyebrow pain
I really like your natural hair color! How about natural color with low lights?
Girl! My skin is almost as red as yours naturally and I've found that the Timewise miracle set by Mary Kay took the redness out no joke! I just became a consultant and received it in my starter Kit and it's amazing! Everyone's skin is different but if you want to give it a go checkout my site www.marykay.com/kristencates
I love how you are saying you don’t know about makeup but you are a total pro! Microblading should be your last resort. Try growing them out(this will take months). I suggest castor oil for regrowing. That and patience will completely change them! Eyebrows would frame your beautiful face.
I loved it. Felt like we were just hanging out. I think allowing yourself more time to get the videos is posted is a great idea. You shouldn't have to stress and rush and stay up late on Friday trying to get the videos done.
Unfortunately, you can't donate hair if it has bleach in it:/ but anyways I just wanted to say that I really enjoy your content! I'm not a teacher but we're the same age and you just have really good energy and your videos always put me in a good mood! 😊 keep it up!
<3
Sending you huge love xxxxx
Sending lots of love 💜
My heart is breaking for you - so sorry for your loss.  Sending you lots of positivity.
Alix I am so sorry for your loss <3 I cannot imagine how you must be feeling. I almost lost my own mum to breast cancer and all I can say is to remember how much support you have around you and keep them close <3 don't be afraid to have bad days, you are fully allowed to be vulnerable and feel shitty because it is a shitty thing. Love you and your channel <3 take as much time as you need, your followers will understand
Sending you all my love and prayers
i am so sorry for your loss ,my love and prayers are with you and your family
Sending you so much love ❤️
I lost my mum 2 years ago😔 i know how you feel ! Stay strong
Sending lots of love, Im so sorry for your loss. I will pray for you!
She is still with you. I lost my dad a few years ago and I still ‘talk’ to him all the time.  You will feel her with you, trust me. xoxo
Hopefully you'll have so much positive and hopeful feedback after this video that you'll be glad you shared, and hopefully finally saying it here, in this space that's so much a part of you, there will be some comfort.\n'This too shall pass'. oxo
My deepest sympathies. I can somewhat relate. My sister (whom I was so close to) passed away very recently, just a couple of months ago. She was so young only 32. Her life was stolen from her/me/my family. Her husband who was physically abusive took it too far, and now she's gone. I'm so angry about it sometimes. Life just isn't fair. I understand you not wanting to talk about it completely, bcs I normally can't and don't talk about my loss. There is no right way to grieve. Live for the highs and just bare it through the lows.
So sorry for your loss ❤️
Sending you strength and love 💕💕
I'm so sorry for your loss. Your mom was proud of you, and I'm sure I don't just speak for myself when I say your videos are always a bright part of my day. You have a lot of people around the world who want you to take care of yourself and are sending you love in this difficult time <3
My thoughts are with you... don't feel any pressure about YouTube or anything- just do what you need to feel ok!
I'm so sorry Alix. I hope time acts as a healer. Xx
Alix I'm so so sorry for your huge, unimaginable loss. Words are pretty meaningless at such a painful time but I hope there is some comfort in them for you. Sending you and your family all my best wishes. I'm so sorry. X
❤️

sending hugs & love your way ❤❤❤

We love you Alix .
Sending all my love, so heartbreaking xxxxxx

My condolences :(
💖
My heart aches for you Alix... Saying this out loud to us/anyone makes it all too real, doesn't it. It's like if you don't admit it, then maybe on some level it never happened. You said your life is different now... Having lost my mom way, way too soon (2 weeks before my daughter was born), I can attest that it will always be different. But you'll find your way, in your own time. Love and prayers to you.
I'm so sorry for your loss Alix. Uploading that video was such a brave thing to do and I can't even begin to imagine how you must be feeling. Take things day by day. Sending lots of love ❤
You're so incredibly brave to make this video and talk through your pain, especially so soon after her passing.  You owe YouTube nothing with regards to explanations.\nI hope that your pain grows less and less every day, even though she'll never leave your memory. \nSending you all of the love, from South Africa.\nxxxxx
I hope you are comforted by all the memories you have of your mom.
I am so unbelievably sorry for the pain you are going through. Don't ever feel like you HAVE to film. You film if you want to, and dont if you dont want to. We're here always x
So sorry for you, I lost my Dad years ago and I know how it's hard. I send you love and support, take care ❤❤❤ (sorry if my english is bad)
You take your time Alix. Come back when you are ready. When you come back be the best you that you can be...your Mum would love that. Sending you love and light.
I'm so sorry for your loss
sending you all my love ! xxxxx
Sending you all the love!!
I’m so sorry you had that experience. I hope you get trough it easily. 💜
I'm so sorry Alix. I lost my Dad unexpectedly and I know the pain is so excruciating sometimes that it's hard to see a way that it'll ever get better. But trust me it does, in time, day by day, the pain will get a little less. I'm sure she was so proud of you. Sending hugs and love xXx
It's really hard to understand what it's like to lose a parent until you experience it. My dad literally died suddenly without warning a year ago. There were no goodbyes. Your mum would be so proud Alix. Try to remember the good times. I always go to a place my dad took me through my childhood and it really helps me to feel closer to him. Sending lots of love. It will get easier. X
Sending you so much love! You’re so strong, you can and you will get through this xx
So very very sorry for your loss. You don’t owe anyone an explanation and I’m sure I’m not the only one who thinks that you’re very brave for posting this video. Remember to ask for help from your friends and family when you need it. We’re all thinking of you! X
I have just watched your incredibly brave video and felt I needed to reach out to say I know how you feel. On 4th October my mum lost her  4 year battle with cancer and this is the hardest most surreal situation I have ever experienced. I am so sorry for you loss - it’s shit isn’t it! \nPlease make sure you take care of yourself. Xxxx
You’re in the situation I fear the most in my life so even if we don’t know each other I want to send you all the love and support you need to get through this. I hope it will reach you through the wire. There are a lot of negative people in this world but you just need a few around you to be kind enough to you to get through this shitty moment. We can see that you’re a strong woman. You’ll be better soon I’m sure. Bon courage !!!
I am so sorry for your loss. No words can describe what it feels like to lose your parent to such an unforgiving disease. All my love to you.
Im so sorry Alix, I can't imagine how devastated you must be. It takes so much courage to post a video like this on youtube. Sending love to you and your family.
Oh Alix, I'm so so so sorry. I wish I could do something to make it better. It praying for you!
I'm so sorry for your loss Alix.  Take care <3. You are so brave!
What an incredibly strong thing to do, I am so terribly sorry for your tremendous loss! ❤️
Be strong ! Sending lots of love and courage !
I'm so so so sorry Alix. My heart breaks for you.
Oh gosh hon I'm so sad for you. In my prayers x
Sorry you felt the need to make such a difficult video 😔😔😔 My heart goes out to you.
Sending u lots of love xxx
Dear Alix, so, so sorry for your loss. You do what's best for you and your family. Your you tube family will be here patiently awaiting your return. Take all the time you need!
Take all the time you need. Sending love your way.
What a shame that you feel that you have to explain yourself. Social media really has become something else. Alix, your true followers on here see you as more than a YouTuber that needs to provide regular videos, you're a person with feelings, and to lose your mom and go through all the stuff you have gone through you absolutely need to take time off and take care of yourself. YouTube will be here when you're ready, as will your subscribers. So sorry for your loss.
Sending so much love to you as you go through all of this <3 <3
Thank you for sharing with us Alix. I am so sorry for your loss! Thinking of you and your family during this tough time. Stay strong and take all the time you need. 💕
This is very close to home for me Alix - sending you so much love to you and your family <3 xxxx
I’m watching this on my Mums birthday, she passed away 22 years ago. I wish I had some wonderful advice to help you through this awful time, but all I can say is that it does get easier and you will be happy again (and don’t feel guilty about that!). Stay strong and when you feel ready continue to make your mother proud on here xx
Oh Alix. I’m so. So sorry. This is such sad news. Sending you lots of love. Please don’t worry about everyone. You need to go what you need to, everyone will still be here xxxx
I am heartbroken for you. Your mum is so proud of you and is with you constantly in everything you do. Sending so much love to you and your family. Xxxxxx
I’m so so sorry sweetheart. Massive hugs and we are all thinking of you. Xxxx
heartbroken for you Alix, be kind to yourself at this difficult time xxxxx
So sorry for your loss. In tears for you..x
So, so much love. This is so brave. All the love in the world xxxxxxxx
I’m so sorry for your loss and so sorry if you felt any obligation to make this video so early in your grief. I wish you lots of love and strength. Take care of yourself xxx
Wish you all the best! Take care! Xx
Sending my love ❤️ and take you’re time!!!
I am so sorry for your loss ❤️
Sending you all the love. Xxx
take as much time off of youtube as you need. and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. griefing is the hardest thing a person has to overcome. especially in a mother-daughter relationship. it's not going to get better, but it's going to become different. you'll eventually start including your grief into your life. the dark last days will eventually fade - even if it takes a while - and you will be able to remember the happy times with your mother. even if right now you think it's never going to be okay ever again - here is my advise to you (from personal experience and losing my mother in 2016 with only 54 to breast cancer): one moment at a time. there's nothing more you have to do right now than to grieve and to live through a minute after another. ❤
Sorry for your loss Alix, it's a terrible thing losing your mum. I wish you well. ♥️
oh so sad.i am so so sorry fr your lose. mothers are always so so much special. but her prayers will be with you forever. just pray for her.
Hi Alix, I'm not someone who usually comments on videos but I just wanted to say I'm so sorry for your loss. Look after yourself 💕
So sad to watch this Alix. Take care xx
I'm so sorry. 💗
I can't express how deeply and sincerely sorry I am for your loss. love and light your way.
I lost my mum to cancer in 2013. Still hurts. You don't owe anyone, anything. Sending you all the love in the world.
I am so sorry for the loss of your mother. Please take the time you need.  You are a lovely person and I really enjoy your videos.  As a mother I want to tell you that I'm sure your mother didn't feel like she gave everything up for others - you and your family were what made her life happy and gave it meaning.
The rest of the world can get on with their lives and will still be there when *you're ready* I am sorry about those who think because you have a Social Media job, that they are some how entitled to speak to you with no consideration, restraint or tact!! When you lose your best friend you can only try to get through each day, one at a time. Somehow it starts to hurt a little less as more time passes. 💕 You will have days when you are ok, and times when you're not. You just do what you need to, to *care for yourself and spend time with those who love you the most* 💞
Please take your time. I lost my dad during summer after 2 years of battling cancer. It's so heartbreaking. I know what you're going through. And it's not fair. I learned 1 lesson: focus on yourself and on what YOU need now to feel better, to grieve. And take your time! x
omg this made me cry so much and broke my heart seeing you so sad and upset I'm so so sorry Alix! I wish you and also your family all the best and sending lots of love. <3<3<3<3  We understand completely if your not in the mood to upload it's totally okay. It's okay not to be okay. <3<3
I truly believe she is still watching you, Alix. Sending love and support x
I am so, so heartbroken for you. You are so brave to post this video and I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending you so much love and lots of healing thoughts. You must take the time to do what feels right for you and not let others make you feel guilty for not uploading or being as present online. Thinking of you and your family and sending prayers for you all ❤️ xoxo
I am crying writing this.  I lost my mum 16 years ago to cancer when I was 33 and understand totally what you are going through.  Take time for yourself lovely every day will be different - some days good some days bad.  One thing that cannot be taken from you are all your lovely memories - keep them close to your heart.   You will never get over losing your Mum - I know I won’t but time is a great healer (an old cliche I know but so true).   My heart goes out to you and all of your family - sending all my love to you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sending all my love, you're never alone <3
You are so very brave to make this video..well done and I hope you can find strength. Your mother must have been so very proud of you. May your lovely mum rest in peace 💞 she will always be there for you in spirit x
omg :( I lost my mum too at 23. I am so sorry for your loss. I wish you the strength and courage to get through this. It gets easier with time but we never recover from loss of parents.
Bless you. You don't owe anyone an explanation at all. Thinking of you all xxx
I'm SO sorry to hear this. I lost my dad new years day this year and I'm not going to lie it is one of the hardest things you will probably ever go through. There is no wrong or right way to grieve and don't let anyone rush you or make you feel like you're not allowed to feel the way you DO, it's all a process. I don't know you personally but if you ever want to speak to anyone with a little bit of insight and sometimes talking to someone you don't know can be easier sometimes I'm always here 💖
Sending you lots of love alix my heart breaks for you xoxo
oh God, sending you power and love. Be strong or weak if you need! Don't think about anyone here, take care of yourself. <3
I'm so sorry for your loss. Sending you my love ❤️xx
the journalist at 19:11 was probably butthurt when Dana didn't really defend GSP lol
Bisping is tryna be the off brand Conor McGregor
Was this in a church?  Why so quiet?
Bising\nJoanna\nCody g
I was impressed (by Michael Bisping's performance) at 3:22 when he managed to wait 22 seconds until GSP was finished.
re-jew-va-naited
joanna is so fucking sexy
Rose trying to pull off the Boy in the Striped Pyjamas look
Bisping is so cringe-worthy. He's like that bully at school that thinks he's hilarious, and just never lets anyone else's opinion be heard because he doesn't stfu, ever. I truly hope that GSP catches him with a wheel kick or head kick or some amazing strike just to shut that fucktard up.
He got fucked up when he went against silva
Bisping is the worst champion
Gsp will knock bisping out nd let him keep the belt.
The cheer Joanna got
I got Bisping, Joanna, Garbrant. Who Ya got?
Bisping talk while you can ;)
Bruh Bisping savage as fuck to Roach leave the poor guy alone ffs XD
the trash talk is so cringe
The Michael Bisping Show...guy is a legend
Bisping trying to be the british McGregor too hard and GSP not getting the respect he deserves. Too many new ufc fans who dunno shit of what this guy achieved.
Bisping showing again how annoying he is. In case you forgot.\nHis GSP voice was funny though.
Shut that British Fucktard up GSP! what happened to respecting the legends? btw Bisping, you are not a legend in case you were wondering!
Bisping - the worst person at trying to sell a fight, sorry but your just a jerk.
LISPING TRYING TO LOOK AND BE LIKE THE NOTORIOUS... WHAT A FUCKIG POSER CHAMELEON PIECE OF SHIT
Heart is everything? it pumps blood, so is he saying that having a strong cardio respiratory system is important?
Michael Bisping didn't beat Anderson. He got lucky that Anderson thought Herb stopped the fight. Henderson smashed him up badly for a 46 year old, about to retire man. He's a weak champion.
Watched this for Joanna. Rose is a great fighter, but we’re talking about the greatest female fighter of all time. Her game is unbelievably technical. Elite skill.
oh shit bisping taking shots at a boxing legend with a disease? thats low
George is going to destroy Bisping, he can’t stand  bullies and will never let them win
That bisping guy is a terrible conor-wannabe
haha michael bisping is a chump. hes been fighting for how long and just won the title. haha really? and hes acting like hes all that. he's gonna get his ass whooped just like he did against dan henderson. lol
TJ lookin like Slytherin Lannister
Bisping's steroid accusation is so old.
Did she say I fucked there last year at 10:27 ? that's cool Joanna but we didn't need to know!
St. Pierre is a class act. The man pushes his chair under the table when he gets up. Can't help but respect the guy
the blNk-fAcd, zN monk, obsSd shaOlN warEOr stAr- that's the 4rEl DL scArE✋️(Nd U L nO dM wL hU I'm talkEng aboOt☹️)
I love Rose but JJ takes this. Rose is still young, we’ve seen this many times. Experience wins over youth. But, Cody looked exceptional against an experienced fighter. However, JJ is still in her prime. \n\nBisping\nCody\nJJ
Was Freddie having a stroke or something at 22.03 ? :o
GSP For The Win
Bisping is a king
Heart and mind aren't disciplines in mma bisping... gsp answered that question with complete accuracy, you're just an average bloke 🖕🏼
Listening to Joanna talk while I take a shit helps it fall right out
I hate bisping but his George saint Pierre impression is hilarious
Rose is lame. WTF was that?
Bisping is a legend and a warrior but I don’t think his winning this one but hope he does come on England
rose looking like  a figure from Thunderbirds
Its funny how Bisping's guilty conscience acts up accusing gsp of steroids. lol\nHe's wearing smart foam, now like conman mctapout, so he feels guilty.
Talk about this in our latest podcast. Why Michael Bisping is a better trash talker than GSP.  Just made a video about it.
i have to give it to bisping tho, he's pretty badass, and most of the time he speaks the truth
Bisping is such a cock head...
After MacGregor's over hyped boxing challenge, its a bit tiring to be interested in mma again
Joanna is love, Joanna is life, Joanna's so fine, and she's gonna be mine!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Bisping was on point in this presser.
why is there no water? that's weird.
i honestly got pissed at michael for talkig smack against freddy roach. dude got no fucking respect. he'll definitely regret losing that title and yet again get his mouth shut the way hendo shut it. i totally loast all my respect to this guy.
Bisping: touch my belt it's nice huh\nGSP: I had 5 of those while you were getting knocked out in historic fashion by Dan henderson in my undercard.
LOL! The first guy in history GSP has outsmack-talked ... Bisping's 100 words per minute down the drain by one waterr iz wet, fiure burn an am gonna beat Migel Beezpeeng.
Bisping interviews are like looking at a wall
Yeah... a sexy fucken lizard! 👅👅👅👅👅
Sleepy Sinead O'Connor
Thumbnail looks like Bisping vs Macklemore
these faggots booing Bisping, fckin wankers
'ARE YOU INTOXICAAATTED'😂
20:11
*Bisping ducking so hard. Fighting welterweights now.*
Btf Rose is beaten already mentally she knows whats coming
hes right,we will miss him,fucking hilarious
Mike bisping trying sound American
Never knew that girl from Stranger things took up MMA
Only a complete knob would want Michael Bisping to win, I hope GSP drops this mofo
Michael Bisping is going to get fucked
Rose is gonna fuck up Joanna I see it in her eyes. Just ask Michelle Waterson smh
I'm rooting for Joanna <3. I can't wait to see you fight again, Champ.
This is really awkward
I, I, I, I'm not impressed by your drunken performance.
Michael Bisbing is too real for YouTube
We all remember how Johny Hendricks gave a face care to GSP so the end here is pretty clear
15:43
TJ looks pretty confident
I fucking love Micheal Bisping 😂😂😂
I love Bisping.
Bisping's trash talk makes me cringe
British scum
Bisping what a dickhead
On my birthday
Bisping is a slick talker these days
Crap
Bispings trash LOL his whole UFC career is garbage hahahahaj
Go thug rose
Are you in-tox-it-k-ted... are you in-tox-it-k-ted?
GSP!!
Bisping is a joke! Not even close to an all-time great! Are you kidding??? He's one of the worst champs I've ever seen just got a lucky punch.
people saying tony ferguson vs kevin lee was cringe
Anderson Silva defeated MB  but was rewarded the win, and he's happy with it knowing he lost. GSP the winner on Nov. 4.
Dana White is like ... fuuuuck this
Rose gives 0 fucks I love it
I'm British ,  bisping is embarrassing
GSP will kick bitchpings ass
GSP will win for sure, how many lucky wins and how many controversial wins are der in Kissbings career!! Countless.. Yes GSP had his controversies as well, whatever the case maybe GSP is better skilled and raw power house, he will fuck Kissbing on Nov 4th (no fucking doubt)
Gegard Mousasi, will whip them both.
Bisping trying so hard to be like McGregor 😒. Get your own act bro
I'm sorry I'm gonna need an entire video on pumpkin canoes cause WHAT
Humans... WOW! has to be the best ending to a Vlogbrothers video :) I feel the way about humans all the time, and this is no exception.
Does anyone need a ticket to their Charlotte show tonight? I can’t go- selling the ticket for $20!
Omg I feel like I'm watching zack and Cody grown up
In a few more years, people will be the largest fruit.
1:30 am i the only one thinking of the curse of the were rabbit
Did anybody notice that their all white
Its 11:11pm, I'm drunk and choose to watch this awesome(and weird) video. You guys are awesome
I grew a giant marrow this year that's too big for my mum to lift
Going with humans messing with fruits and veggies I HAVE HAD COTTON CANDY GRAPES. They were terrifyingly good.
This was coincidentally perfectly timed to relieve a lot of my stress as well, so THANKS HANK. i might have to bring a lil pumpkin to tour now.
My brother grew pumpkins up the side and on top of our shed. In order to get them to stay on the vine, he made pantyhose pouches which he tied to a makeshift trellis so they could sit and grow comfortably while defying gravity. It was very peculiar looking, but the pumpkins made really good pies later.
I don't know if it's still on the air, but Food Network used to have a show during Halloween that involved carving humongous pumpkins.
<3 this video is so sweet
Are these fruits and vegetables tested for steroids?
Thank you Hank for sharing this video I'm a little anxious and depressed too so that really helped me I love how you help love  and support your brother you are so amazing
Our festival winner was 768 pounds. Big, but no 2600 pounds. :D
So a guy just won the world record for largest gourd, 4 days after video published.
It's the 10th, anyone got any word on the pumpkin weigh off?
OH MAN! I just went to a giant pumpkin festival and both of my uncles grow giant pumpkins (one of them came in 10th)\nOn this note, the largest watermelon in Oregon ever was awarded first place at said festival.
0/10 no pic of Corbyn and a giant Marrow.
so i just got my copy of turtles all the way down, except, no i didn't, turns out i ended up with 2 copies, and not only that, but they're both signed! i don't know how this error happened but it resulted in the overdraft of my account by 7 dollars, but I'm okay with that because they didn't charge me an overdraft fee and i just sent in my jar full of loose change to them so they wouldn't have to. So all in all, i might end up selling one of my extras to someone who didn't, or i might give it to my sister. i don't know.
This is why I love watching you guys. I love seeing passionate people get passionate about stuff, especially when they are getting passionate about other passionate people's passions! It is infectious and I always find myself feeling excited for the same thing too, even if four minutes prior I knew nothing about it. \n\nThanks for being awesome.
Hank green you are the best brother ever
OMG!!!!! The book came today and i am soooo happy!!!!!!!!
Wow, this is one of the sweetest videos that I have ever seen.
I thought this was gonna be an autobiography
http://www.bigpumpkins.com/WeighoffResultsGPC.aspx?c=P&y=2017   -- Mathias's pumpkin was over 2,228lb this year! :P Didn't beat out last year's!
I wonder what the largest (in terms of size, not pages) book is...
oh god! that's not a carrot, it's a Resident Evil boss!
New tomato record set by Dan Sutherland
I love both you guys so much! 😂
I already knew you two were the world's biggest fruits
Please tell me I'm not the only one who Googled the European Pumpkin Championship and found out that the fella who holds the record for largest pumpkin ever is currently winning this year's contest with a 2228.9 lb pumpkin. Congrats, Mathias! Keep 'em comin'!
Well if they are alive, I would guess, Pewie Landsherson, Oliver Pratt and formerly Chris Platt though sometimes its Kathy Baits butt on the hole its got to be Boseanne Rarr. Or it could be that sumo wrestler that Quentin Tarateeneeew-Yuk hangs with. Sorry I didn't realize this about giant edible fruits. Nevermind.
i luv how u give us details and info about the giant fruits thank u
Ah!!! I'm so excited! I preordered Turtles and didn't even know when it was being released!  Woot! New Book!!!
Why is this trending again
I decided to take a break from essay writing to catch up on my Vlogbrothers and I just wanted to say thank you. This was amazing. I can go back to my essay proofreading happily now.
This is definitely one of my favorite vlog brother vids. Thanks Hank!
But do they taste good???? 🤔
Wait I thought they were all working for VICE as reporters?
literally thousands of generations of people\n\nIf one generation is taken as 20 years of births and thousands is taken as the lowest possible plural - 2000, then you are saying literally 40,000 years of work and intelligence. How can it be literally 40,000 years when it is fact that the Earth is 6000 years old.
I love big pumpkins. And this video made my day. Thanks Hank.
I almost skipped this video and I'm so glad I didn't
great video, a hug from cuba omg
You should end every video like that. Humans. WOW.
You guys should make a video for us newbies to the fandom. Like Vlogbrothers 101 with all the references you guys make. A simple resource for all our nerdy confusion.
I preordered turtles all the way diwn expecting it to come on the 10 as in the release date but there was mail today even though its columbus day and i got the book!!!
Is it me or did all these vegetables/fruits look like tumours?
I need a photo of John with a copy of Turtles All the way Down in his mouth. You put the thing that does the killing between your teeth...
Genetic selection  at it's best. What better way to genetically modify the species then to selectively breed it.
why is john sad?
Hank needs to watch Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were Rabbit asap
I am from Belgium and it is true. Some regions take the pumkin thing very serieusly and in elementery school we did competitions of our own.
Why is pewdiepie not on the list
I love this video
Hi John, Im Brazilian but I live in Bolivia, Im doing a literary analysis of your book Under the same star , I really like your videos, I love your book. Kisses from Peniel school.
Thank you for a lovely video that warmed me up on a grey, cold Sunday. \nI just wanted to add that when I'm upset and need a little bit of anarchic giggling I go on Scottish Twitter. Completely loopy, foul mouthed, sometimes way too much but always strangely logical, Scottish Twitter is the Wild Wild West of the Internet.
Stop talking and just show us the damn fruit
But how do they taste?
This was perfect to start a stressful week. Thank you Hank. 😂😂
Oh ,you're gosh, hank, I love the giant onion man too. He just looks SO HAPPY about his onion. I needed this video too. I needed a video where overwhelming happiness is the theme.
This made my week
Hank, you have succeed. I was in a very bad mood and now I'm excited about this pumpkin madness!
Can I post a picture showing my huge vegetable?
Most of them look like deformed mutants lol
That’s some crazy stuff !! 🤔🤔🤔
Says fruits but in thumbnail puts a cucumber/gourd
I FINALLY FOUND YOU MY MAN! I misses sewing you in Crash course. You are awesome there and here :D
My boyfriend and I just broke up and this is the video I didn't know I needed to cheer me up, thank you Hank 😊
Anyone find out the winners?
OMG, @vlogbrothers, you are awesome! @Hank I loved it all -  the subtext, the distraction, can't even imagine how you would have researched! This is true love,<3. - Love, J
These guys are the biggest fruits I've ever seen.
How does one breed a plant?
2:52 IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN CHARLIE BROWN
u forgot Mr Bean :/
nice click bait on trending keep it up youtube!!!
This makes me uncomfortable.
Hey, my name is Mathias.
Giant potatoes look frickin gross...
World’s largest fruit; Bruce Jenner.
I have good news and bad news \nBad news Some preorders shipped early \nGood News The preorder when to me who will not spoil the AMAZING first 3 chapters
Hahahahaha Hank you are the sweetest!
I'd devour that watermelon. :) Can't have enough of it. :)
This made me so happy hahaha thanks Hank xD
This video makes me happy.
mouth poem school sure ban image shut really.
onions and potatos aren't fruits
SEEING YALL ON TOUR IN NYC TOMORROW
I hate your videos.
**Super Mario Sunshine Flashbacks**
Those are pumpkin kayaks.
No Gmo
LOVE.
Humans!! Wow!!!
<3 Hankie.
Good morning John
Pumpkins and Penguins, Hank
This is what happens when you genetically modify food...
Pink you're the best
Pink... Love your Music. Keep it up... God Bless.
So so good! I wish you came to Portugal. I would go north or south just to watch your concert! I love love love your music! It's too good!!! <3 <3 <3 xx
omg, i can't find the rest of the album, i am so sad, is anyone able to find it?
This is so brilliantly beautiful!!!!!!
Pink is a super artist....'at a girl!
Who did the art for this video?
I didn't know about it the first listen, but something kept pulling me back to the song.  Now after like the 20th listen I am in love with it. It has a distinct 80/90's pop vibe an I am here for it.
Pink you never disappoint me, thank you for your beautiful music
New song better every time like if u agree 👍
She's The best ever !! ❤👏👏
i love this song.

Crap. this is not a message to us
I had a pit pull mixed husky
Those stapleless staplers are pretty useless we had one for a while but it just shreds papers and when it does actually staple it usually unstaples within a short while.
He wiped his hands with toilet wipes 😂😂😂😂
Wow , i didn't know you can put coins in sluts 😵
Fun mail
Im wearing that type of belt right now lol
Spongbob squarepants :p
You make the best videos ever
I think the other one is a vomit bag hahahaha
 That's more than enough [toilet paper] for one use\n-Dingleberry Lovers, 2017
he has a husky
I love how he pronounces potty party. Have you ever been in one of those porta parties?
dildos put to the test
I love how he thanks each one who sent something
Whats your opinion on the United States
what does he even say in the beginning
I'm very interested to know how well the plunger works!
The dogs are feisty today

I’m watching you, I know where you are, I know what you do hahahahaha!!!!!!!
I wear those belts to school
The clock fan took a while to work because your laptop was installing the drivers for it.
That stapless stapler is actually a mechanism invented in the very early 1900's
i can clean my h'ands very well
all are nice and useful product
What is the brand of the USB clock fan?
He told Fun Mail Instead Of Fan Mail
They are the best belts ever, I have a few of them.
That's more than enough for one use??? Are you kidding? That was like 30 squares!
I wish I had Fun Mail
Lúcio's Gun is actually a drain cleaner😂😂 (only overwatch fans could understand)

i had a belt like that once before and it broken and sliced my stomach open when i tried to get it off. it was too tight :(
How did he get plastic sponge Bob  character cards
Plumbers love those pressurized pipe blaster things. Best way to ensure your customers keep calling you back to fix their exploded pipes lol
I love his dog😂😂😍
That was the kulakovest video in the world

Love your Sponge Bob cards! Я люблю ваши карты Губка Боб!
Hope Scotland qualify from an Englishman
That keeper playing in the Matrix
Why is Scotland in pink? I've never seen that before. Also I'm very impressed with that Coldplay singer - didn't know he could play like that! ;p
Holland guy here. We miss that passion and willing to win!
Never seen a black Scottish before. Very cool 🙏🏿
Scotland!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
strange how it was only weiss that got booed for slovakia
Scotland played good, andtgey won my bet good job! Got to qualify
Englishman here. But honestly Scotland look far better and way more exciting to watch then England. Was only the keeper stopping Scotland being about 4-0
10vs12 Could be different match when Mak rather could scored and did not made fault. Anyway, pretty hard group even Slovakia may be will not proceed. Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland should be on the cup :D
oh wow this was a very lucky one ... :/ :D
Robert mak stuped this is not greek league
I've half Slovakian so idk what to say here :/
scotlands central defence represented by hearts and Blackburn omg thank god we,re not going to the world cup the goal difference would read for nil conced 35 after the group games
England and Slovakia will make it to the World Cup from group C.Scotland will struggle at Slovenia and Slovakia will definately beat Malta
Tht late goal made it the 40\nMin wait to get out   Asda car park worth it haha
Wish Scotland would stop playing in those poofy pink shirts. Hardly a tough image.
Good luck to Scotland as an england fan
Consider a fact: a Serbian guy send off Slovakian player in both match against England and against Scotland. We must play in ten to lose tightly.
We have some of the most passionate fans in football. Just please don't bottle it in Slovenia
COME ON YOU BOYS IN PINK!!!!!!! #SCOTLANDSPINKARMY
Good decision by a reff!!
outside the box thats a free kick,if its a foul its a foul, his point is right, thats a free kick so why no pen
Proud to be scottish 🔵⚪💪now on to Slovenia #believe
From an Englishman one more games lad's you can do it!!!!!!! See you in Russia.
Not a fan of that pink kit. They should use black and / or yellow.
I'm just here to see the Scottish Fans freaking out completely. Hope to see you at WC18.\nBest wishes from Germany.
Who else was there?
Got to love Scotland! Defo be supporting them over England if they make it... coming from an Englishman (with Scottish family ties)
My friends went to see it! In wembley
That boy from coldplay sure can shoot!
Scotland playing amazing keep it up boys.
It would be really cool if wales,england and scotland all qualify for the wc
Really Good Match To Watch..
What a game. Should have watched this one
Such a great match and better than a grand football final 😱😱
Subscribe to me and stay active 👍comment done 😅 I WILL RETURN AND STAY ACTIVE 😃
Wish England had this passion.
So many nice shots, but eventually get such a weird goal,
Excellent keep up the good work!
Well done once again for fighting hard scottish boys just hope we now can get a win over in Slovenia be tough game but canny fault the effort from the scotland team
whatever happens,so proud of my country tonight,Benidorm erupted when the goal went in,nice end to a holiday!
Man off the match is the fans xd
As Gordon Strachan said, \n\nTheir goalkeeper played brilliant, as did the crossbar.
Hi guys can everyone check out my little boys football channel if you like subscribe thank you
Scotland will go in playoff because our retarded coach fafanec will lose on purpose. Fortunately he will be gone after this match and hopefully never seen again. At least it's a safe bet who bets on football.
We’re on our way mon eh Scots
if scoltand qualify to the world cup, they will be in brazil group, thats always happens.
What's with the faggy pink shirts?
Unlucky, own goal at the end
I was tearing my hair out with 10 minutes to go ,the amount of times I have seen that with Scotland needing the win and coming so close chance after chance but the ball wouldn't go in the net at the 84 minute mark I just decided Scotland are cursed that's it end of ! And then that goal goes in Jesus Christ hahaha you stress me out Scotland but I love you surley we can do it now !!
Shiteland third place
Hahahahaha. Still laughing to myself
Maddd
Cmon SCOTLAND 👍🏻
Great Dúbravka. Amazing....
good job scotland
Not Fair for goalkeeper..
Goal at 5:25
Celtic v dudee 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚6-1 celtic
What a goalkeeper💗
Chrissy martin 😊\nYou rams !!
We will def beat Slovinia 0-2 mooooonnn boys
why pink... why... FORZA SCOTLAND!!!!!!
So.... Congratulation from Slovakia.
Scotland deserved it
Well done mini terriers
Please please please win today boys.
Yaaaaaaaaas!
I hate yet rate Skrtel.  Very tough streetwise player.
https://youtu.be/Zo8I_gC6sSM
On ye go boys!
FIFA Keeper
Cmon Scotland!
Strong play
Imagine booing a Slovakia player because he used to play for rangers pathetic
That goalkeeper is world class
Best fans in the world so much passion from Scotland the English have nothing like this so sad !!😎😛
Every1 criticising the guy who dived, fair enough but the Slovakian goalie played insane.
I'm English but support Scotland and Wales more - their team's passion is real
Scotland did not score a goal in doubles from Slovak
Can we do it!? Should never have let England off the hook.
You have to play Slovenia in Slovenia and win because Slovakia will beat Malta. That will be very difficult Slovenia are a solid team. Even if you win there is a good likelihood you'll be lowest second best team and not qualify for the playoffs. In any case whatever happens credit to Strachan for turning a terrible team into contenders.
This should be on Scots telly.
here a slovakian...good match guys, but its still not the end...
Slovakia beast win with malta and rusia is open but scotlan dont win with slovenia
Today Scotland will pay Slovenia cause they know that Slovakia will win so they are out of play and they will let Scotland win...sadly
Frrrreeeeeeeddddddoooooom i can say it because im Scottish
Wow, Scotland actually got a chance to go to the World Cup, what a time to be alive...
Who is the child that keeps whistling?\nNeeds a dunt with an elbow.
answer me this, was that bad or was that crap
I'm a Rangers fan(also Scotland fan obvs) but griffiths has a wand of a foot, his free kicks are insane. When he banged those 2 against Joe Hart me and my cousin went ballistic, but sadly in typical Scottish style we bottled it and only came out with a point 😂
check out my youtube channel i made a diss track on rice gum!
Why are Scotland playing in pink?
Wrong Title..there are never any highlights when Scotland or England attempt to play football
SUPER👍👍👍
Scotland no foot ball
no tartan army in moscow :). If you meet Italy good luck to your boys they will sliced you into pieces
Anyone know why Scotland are playing in pink, not their dark blue ?
That commentator is atrocious.
A god among men...
@NF is it just me or r u mad at roman or something?
I just listened to his old songs and he had a wayyyy different style (autotuned singing full of Christian lyrics). Wow he's really found his sound and has come a long way! Great artist!
This is my new theme song
made an instrumental of this song. check it out bro :D
Have you heard of 80 DEKA?\nsoundcloud.com/paradox2025
He low key sound like Eminem
I had seen a snippet of this in an ad on a video talking about Eminem releasing a new album.... I thought this was one of the songs. But at least I'm a fan of this guy now.
Why is this not on the trending page in Australia? #RealMusic
Smile more comment is funny.
He remember me LOGIC, EMINEM AND HOPSIN all the same time....
Every song is a master piece!
He's gonna be this generations Eminem. I can here it now and Em's walking out soon anyway.
I love the way he rap ....
He's growing so fast, i remember when this song came out 7 days ago, he's so close to 1m :)
Wait a minute....there was a song called Mansion for his Mansion album and a song called Therapy Session for his TS album so where's Perception? So maybe we could be expecting a new song in the coming months or hopefully a music video for Intro 3
I LITERALLY JUST GOT THE NOTIFICATION FOR THIS WHAT THE HECK
I’m like, OOH a new song of NF, let me see... “after 3 seconds” OMG I LOVED IT!
Example of dying Black culture!
He's so sick.
see this is how i feel to          NF REAL
I'm suddenly a rap kinda person
NF and Logic? Would that be a sick beat and song? Some real feels? Maybe
This man is bigger than 116
A M A Z I N G !!!
For once, a song that accurately describes me...
Never stop righting emotionally use every emotion you have to make the best music of your career you amazing amazing career.
2:37 is it just me or sounds like from the movie saw
Hopefully Eminem does a song with NF
Wish I could be there
Turn on the lights please i want to see the video thanks
Look at 2:45 theres know one in the car
Young version of Eminem
Am always coming back for seconds 😂🔥
Love The Beat-Voice FLOW. Not much rappers can combo beats and rap to em perfect throw up a W.... Others grab the L.
We are on a date with a clash of rap gods when Eminem releases his new album ..
This is me in the outcast fuck it I dont care neither does nf he rule the world if I need a song to correct me he's got it
I wonder if he'll sell out too like Eminem did when he found out you won't blow up unless you put out the message they want.
Goosebumps for days! NF man you really know how to get the adrenaline going.
better than all the rappers
ill just be the outcast ...
So apparently Russ called NF whack in an IG stream and that’s why NF says “somebody told you I was whack? Check the source” \n\n\nThat may not be why but holy hell this song is incredible
This helps me feel at home.Thanks
The next generation Eminem.
Got a weird smile, but I like it... lol  Why is there no love button for YouTube!  Its awesome that he throws in peaces of his other songs. It's like a darker version of what Disney, and  his rhythm changes so much.  Long live the King!
Am I the only one who thinks he sound similar to eminem
Am I the only one who thinks he Eminem twin
christian musicians rule the world. That’s, what’s truth! God before everything!
Now you'll be able to buy pants without holes
I think NF just created a new style of rapping. He builds up and gets more intense with every line. I'm gonna calling it build up rap.
Nice rapper, not like lil wayne and others mumble rappers, mumble rap is shit
Now this is a song that I can keep listening to.
i did not know eminem had a child that could rap better than him...
Where all real fans at ? C'mon Perception is out now !
He just doesn't stop dropping bangers!!!\nThis is his best album for me\nDope production and deep lyrics as you always expect from NF\n🔥🔥🔥🔥
What i would give to be one of the 50 people in this music video!
U N D E R R A T E D
the new EMINAME

Omg so savage 👏👏
oh hello there
Wait for Rebelliouz😉he will show yee all how its done🇮🇪🇮🇪
You need more severe mental problems to provide more interesting material for lyrical content.\nA song about giving up the need to feel accepted is quite boring.
I was just about to study but then...... I don't care  NF  buy youtube views from *AUTHENTIC* *Views* *dot* *com*
Eminem Jr.  Dope AF
introduced to the beast back in Mansion. The first song i heard that got me hooked was All I Have. He's come a long way. His fan-base has grown so much in just 2 years.
I aint Puttin out trash. Ill take a hundred and staple it right to my tongue.. I ALWAYS PUT THE MONEY WHERE MY MOUTHS AT! - NF\n\nI love this. Hes passionate, he's got skill, and hes got a lot on his mind, but theres nothing in any of his songs that is suggestive. NF, this album dethroned Skillet as my #1 band... your at the top! keep up the music man. God has used you in my life more than you know. Thank you SO much!!
Woke up in a cell, where am I at
Flow doesn’t suit the beat in my opinion, it really does seem like he’s trying to copy Eminem’s flow with the way he’s rapping
I was about to eat but this came
#tiredofthewhiterapper
Been here everyday ever since it dropped. 🔥
NF is NF not a take Eminem

micro transactions anyone ? \n\nNot for me thanks.
Kumail, I'm playing this game and your character was hilarious. I killed him and he cheated death and came back to fight me again....but much to his chagrin...I killed him again. <3
This was the best, most positive cringe I've never seen! Cringe is usually...just cringy. Also, I love that Kumail is a fan of LOTR and a gamer! Conan and Kumail are so good together.
I think Kumail Nanjiani did a good voice over lol....
No thanks, The game looks half baked.
Kumail's done voice work in Adventure Time as well
I respect Conan. This was a good segment. I swear I would watch and pay for Conan doing remotes and clueless gamer.
Im waiting for Friday The 13 The Game
i hate conans all nerds are following nerd criteria while also going im just a nerd too but your a dork
I remember hearing this dude from the walking dead game and something else but I love this dude!
I hate the separate camera in SOW
I thought the Orc sounded more like Patton Oswald than Kumail.
OH GOD......waching the CD standing there...being so uncomfortable.....oh that was painfull
If only Kumail Nanjiani was as talented as he is smug.
I m amazed how Erin ( sorry if I m wrong) kept losing n gaining his weight. How he do that. I want to lose some weight.
I rememberr the dark souls cluelessgamer video where everyone was bullshitting around and kumail was engrossed in the atmosphere
god I hate this idiot
I honestly really want this game
BE SMART AND BECOME RICH IN LESS THAN 3DAYS…It all depends on how fast you can be to get the new PROGRAMMED blank ATM card that is capable of hacking into any ATM machine,anywhere in the world.

Clueless gamer is my all time favorite thing xD I play half these games, making it even funnier
Please just listen and bring back Aaron for crying in a bucket!
People needs to read the books.
Well I still have the 909 preped and ready
can we just get more of aaron please?
He's one of the overlords in my game
Kumail is so funny! I love the banter between these two!
I love that Conan comments that Kumail's never been outside....when Kumail and his wife used to have a video game podcast called The Indoor Kids
What is Pakistani Denzel doing with Conan O'Brien?
Lol first day and I found him
your mom's shades of lipstic...and butthole
This game is being promoted really hard.
Is this offensive to gamers ? Can't figure it out...he's constantly geek-shaming Aaron
aaron has low T
if conan was a game streamer and i watched him play i'll be dead laughing   by now
No talk show like conan
yeeeaaaaaahh my favorite lets player! And the only one i watch. I play the games myself instead of watching another boo hoo play\nThat last fraise about PC was .. Original Conan : )
You're waist-ing my time!  amazing
ugh...video games are wasted on the elderly
Haha 😂 they didn't change his voice
i'm gonna buy this game just to shame Dugz over & over & over & over again before killing him.
I like how they got the guy in charge of the game to come in just so they could call him racist
I have this on ps4
Kumail is the best
The devs could change his voice in a patch.
Lol 😁
Elijah Wood should've been in this video
This is hilarious, great chemistry between this 2 lol
This looks like the same damn game years later lol.
Kumail should be Conan's regular clueless gamer guest.....this is the best!
Poor Aaron
Everything is racist for Conan and that Iranian dude.
genually i dont like celebs on cluelessgamer. this guy was funny
All the shades of your mom's lipstick
Somehow Aaron gets skinnier every time he appears on Conan
I'm saying,Pied Piper needs funding \n😂😂😂😂😂
The Orc who is dazed by brutal violence or shaming (Twitter) is the best part.
my dream clueless gamer is fire emblem warriors with matthew mercer
I'm surprised Kumail was able to go 8 minutes without complaining about Trump.
4:50 man that sounds... so frickin bad\nLMAO\nThe cringe is amazing
They should have used his voice when you open a loot box. That would've cheered people up so they would pay more money.
His orc voice is good! Because it sounds original instead of grungy like most, they do have higher pitched orcs that sound insane! He did a good job
I't s rather old game, but I would LOVE to see Conan do The Last of Us.
Why is this untalented asshat in everything now?
I miss conan's ranking every end of the game!!!
should've brought in the voice actor for Kruk..
the game graphics is lame for 2017 game
Practically people from India are orcs.
i didn't know raj from the big bang theory played video games
Still waiting for a Conan Schlansky gaming video
Conan REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I'm looking forward to dominating kumail nanjianai orc
Do rainbow six siege
Pied Piper needs funding xD
I love Kumail!
Whares the romantic diner lol to unwined
SHADOW OF WAR
Damn those textures are bland as hell.
Glorbgorb
Map struggle run cloth promotion household endure.
7:39 ahahahaha Conan you are cute.
i heard jarun tann
dugz the curry maker
They were freaking hilarious; but the game itself looks kinda meh.
Just do a game with Aaron!  We don’t always need celebrities!  At least this guy seemed to know how to play video games
Dear Team Coco: Why does nobody at ur staff has the balls or ovarians to get Aaron back. Conan and Aaron whers purely joy. He(Conan) could fool around non scripted and funny as he naturally is and Aaron gets the nerdy impact. I wouldnt say you ruined it, but #FreeConan.
Love these 😂
Get Conan on Vr
Pakistani denzel
Bro you fucked me
Await construction ceremony poll layer real contribute.
I hate you Conan
Kumail seems like a lovely guy
hahah YES!!! thank you Conan. Keep these gems coming
5:30
I literally lol
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssa 🤓🤓🤓
Indian Orcs?
SHADOW OF MICROTRANSACTIONS
Pied piper needs funding xDD
He's happy
Kourtney, your new boyfriend is so hot. Scott, who?\nKourtney looks so gorgeous.
Omg monotonic voice is beyond annoying
This camera work is killing me omfg fire them
Does kourtney take Xanax every day? Or does she just lack a personality all together? Or is her face just stuck like that? I have so many questions.
He did that with 19 yr old Sofia
well kourt he is trying to do something for your birthday you already leave your life scott he has the right to get jealous je is the father of your 3 kid's sound like you are using him..get a life kourt.
She looks like a drugsaddict. That explains the slow/ weird talking
Kris look like Michael Jackson in the thumbnail. .lmao 😅😅
I used to watch this. Probably the first two years and a few spin offs. This is the first time I have seen them close up since. WOW! Both their faces are crazy looking. And she was bitching about Scott back then.
I just think Scott wanted the best of both worlds. He wanted to cheat, be heavily intoxicated, AND be the family guy he brought it on himself. Kourtney seems genuinely happy now.
I can't.
the video caption has kris looking like MJ
wow she talks so stupid, like a 12 year old and she is like 38 with 3 kids
This seems so scripted and not a real convo
This women as got such strong gains she could birth a nation and they would all be beautiful
I don't feel sorry . First of all who cares love your life . I'm over it
It's weird seeing her talk to her mom it's like all Kris talks to is Kendal kylie n kim
She wants him to get it together bc she's not done popping kids out.
just dropped by to say this is the worse trash on television...along with housewives and most of those reality shows..
Face pulled up...not saggy anymore around her chin cheek area...has to keep up with the young bf😁
She isn't free from blame....it's just the degree falls heavily on Scott
With that voice alone, i'm surprised Scott hasn't lost it earlier in their relationship. Good god! Also Kourtney is often very cold to anyone around her and i remember after Scott's parents died, the way she behaved on the show. The man lost it probably because she is just not a sympathetic woman and emotionally she abandoned him when he needed her the most and Scott unconsciously cant forgive that so he is acting out like a little kid.
Kourt's complexion looks really bad. Strange because she has access to the best dermatologist in the world.
How dare her call other girls hookers that way. She gets upset that he dates younger girls, SHE is dating a younger man. She's lead him on for years and even said on the show that having another baby with him was not totally out of the question. He's no Angel, but neither is she.
Naaaah Scott ftw!!
WWWLOGANPAUL/SHOP
so she basically called Bella Thorne, Sofia Richie, and Chantel Jeffries all hookers lmao
1 Kourtney \n2 kim\n3 khloe \n4 kilye \n5 kendall\n6 kris \n7 8 9 10 you choose\n😛😛😛😍😍
I like the less makeup look on Kourt- maybe just use a different contour shade, that's the only thing I'd change
Is just me or does the song in the background sound a lot like Are You That Somebody by Aaliyah but slowed down?🤔
She looks like she got her face done
It is funny at least one of her kids should be real
She looks so ugly here
So glad she left Scott that relationship was horrible.
Why do these women gaze, pause and talk?
I know that's rite kourtney
COME ON CAMERA MAN GET IT TOGETHER!!!!!!
That valley girl accent i cant
I am glad that Kourtney have move on with Scott. Way you go Kourtney!
Eyebrow lift and botox, she looks so different
What is the name of the music at the end?
Oh no Kortney!!! She should of left her eyebrows alone. It gives her a different unusual look. 😒
Has she had something done to her face? She look's different
She got eyebrow lift she used to have creases on her eyes.
Scott's been living off the Kardashian fame for 10 years, I agree 100% with Kourtney here. He just wants to continue living the lifestyle so he plays up for the camera's and the family
Kourt probably gave in too the plastic surgery  because she started dating a guy younger than her  ....... idk she looks different
Why Kortney has such a bad skin if she can afford anything in the world.  Looks horrible
Scott always playing the victim like sis, wyddddd
Hella VALLEY WHITE GIRL talk. Like who needs to sound like this?
Kourtney gets upset when he’s with someone else too so...
l'm over her.... She strings Scott along, it's ok for her to date though
Just can’t stop staring at her frozen forehead.
Kris needs to stop being her kids friends and start being their mother. Like a proper real mother. How can Kourtney say it’s ‘funny to drink so much she fell asleep in her own vomit’. That’s just not ok on any level, it’s also dangerous and not funny at all. I hope her kids NEVER see that video clip.
I was in the exact same kind of relationship, just left a week ago. All games. 10 years together
Kourtney looks older than Kris in this video....She should change her make up artist..
He is a loose cannon but when I think about him having no other family, no siblings no parents I feel sad that they don't get it back together
Kortneys cheek fillers are shifting you can see the cracks which that makeup application
When they say hi 😏. Annoying !!
Kourtney Kardashian starts taking...aaaaaand it's the end of the world. All she tried to say was hello. she's the slowest person in talking like you literally have to speed it up to make her sound normal! I bet it's the only reason Scott can't stand her. I cringe every time she tries to speak. Like I'm shouting inside talk like a fuckin normal person
Kris jenner needs to stop with the plastic and botox lookin like latoya jackson
She looks a bit sleep deprived here
Scott has disrespected Kourtney way to much he should not have any thing to do with her success, he is disrespectful, disgusting, baggage.
God whatever she's had done to her face most recently is NOT flattering.
He had 10 years to put his heart in this relationship, he blew it
1. You should have thought of that before you had 3 children with him.\n2. She just admitted that she doesn't want him to leave her alone. (as evident by the 3 kids)\n3. Well now you have Hookers of your own. Just a nice little instagram hook-a. (in my Lafayette voice)
why Kris look better than Kourtney
kourtney look at you face lit scars
Kris slaying that adidas
I liked kourtney’s old brows
Ew I just realized how ugly kourtney tbhhh
kourt has old lady neck :(
Q fea mujer
kourtney looks krae krae
Whao
I LOVE SCOTT 😫😭😒
Kourtney got something done that fucked up hwr face
!!!!
Kourtney needs to ditch the Don Draper Dickhead
Drag comparison example close faith advocate taste moment forty
The way they say Hi Hiiiiiii ugh lol

Girl.... fix your eyebrows
Bella Thorne is shaking....
Lazstyftrrthicl
Something odd about kourtneys face...
Very icy scripted 📜
1:03 mood Kris Jenner everyday
How did kourtney get Scott? Scott's a genuinely handsome, model looking man, while kourtney is average (full of plastic surgery). Part of me feels that kourtney deep down knows Scott is better than her, he's a smart and funny dude, and she can't handle that so she puts him down to feel better about her miserable self
Kourtney you are a bit of an airhead! Yes we see Scot grovelling and begging you for intimacy, yet you think it is best to display yourself as this untouchable goddess who refuses to be touched by this man, your husband. You probably think it's the best story line, yet you simply appear cold hearted. If you love him and give him all he needs, why doesn't Seacrest have it on show?? All we see is you expecting his babies, having had them, you embrace the kids and kick him to the kerb. He is naughty, but I don't blame Scot for engaging other girls. You give him the ammunition and the guts to show the world that many other women are open to loving him. Now all we see is you publicly taking youths like Beiber etcetera? Have a bit of pride as a woman, a mother! The air in your head says leave the kids go get drunk and puke, and you think your mother is wrong? Guess what, your children will suffer emotionally for the rest of their lives when they are grown enough to understand your behaviour. Revenge dating cost Princess Diana. In your case it's not pretty to compete with a man so publicly. I see a cold hearted woman who only takes her husband when she wants a new baby. You are the reason why Scot is a rascal. How old are we?
Courtney such a b****she doesn't even deserve Scott
Kourtney you are the most beautiful of your sisters, you dress better and you are mom of the year. Forget that classless waste who asks strangers for _______s when he's drunk. He can't handle a real woman that's why he is with ugly youngsters. I think Ed wrote The Shape of You thinking of you! Forget him as your love and find someone who won't humiliate you and deserves your love.
Kris said she THINKS he was jealous not he was jealous so why is kourtney  getting angry
That’s the most emotion I have ever seen from her.
Kris knows exactly how social media works and to see how her kids don't listen to her advice is sad. The internet is a harsh place. Especially for a crying Kardashian
The issue is that Kourtney took Scott when he was way too young to be the kind of mature man she was hoping for, being an older woman. Their entire life have been that mismatch. And tho kids are a joy those decisions have always been sideways to what she wanted forcing him in a position to man up for her when he was not at that stage to do such  (tho he manned up for his kids). Kourtney is as much to blame for the situation she is in as is Scott. And I am on neither team and like them both as individuals. It is clear that Scott love Kourtney but unfortunately they are just on different pages of life. I do hope they find love in other people cause they would not work well unless they are very late in life. Scott needs to find himself and make mistakes without being tied to the person he made the mistakes with. I believe young ppl in their 20s should not be tied down and that is what Kourtney wanted with Scott. The age difference here came with maturity difference as well, and they both paid the price of that decision.
Who do you think did better?!
I was literally stressed out for you.
I love the lip that Nikkie used ❤️
6:54 LOOK AT THAT TWO SWIPE MAGIC
nikkie tutorials laugh @ 7:04 was hilarious and cute ! thanks for making my day with this collab
The person behind you at 10:02 totally freaked me out!! I was just like whoa who’s that they didn’t even notice😱
Who the HELL was standing behind Jaclyn. That was a bit creepy, they're there, then BOOM like they never existed. Vanished.
We need more videos please.... I feel like I'm having withdrawals..xc
You guys openly talking about your poop is reason number 862774 why I need to be your friend.
What did Jaclyn use on her lips?
Lmao I love how you waited for the timer to get till 4 mins instead of just going till 6 mins to make it 10
I just want to know he lip colors 🙄😳
You guys are so funny
But what lip did you use?!
You two peas in the pod should totally do DRUNK GET TOGETHER ready with holy grail!
tbh i feel as nikki can go up a shade in foundation
Jaclyn what lip is that?!
YESSS!! Fun with makeup, that's what it's all about!! At the end of the day, remember it's just makeup, don't take life so seriously... I loved this video :)
Wait.. why didn’t they just start the timer again & go to 6 minutes...
Sorry off topic........ *Please Read* I need help. I have a video on my page here for my GoFundMe and I’m just asking if you could please just share my video or GoFundMe page on Facebook, Twitter or instagram. My video explains what’s going on, as does the page. Thank you!
I'm laughing soo much!! By far my favorite video!! Love you guys so much!!
How is this full glam? Lol
does anyone know what shade numbers she wears with the dior foundation she never says?
This looked like y'all had such a good time!! Also was curious if you've ever tried the Milani fierce foil eyeshine quad in 03 Florence? I just picked this up and it's super creamy and pretty. Thought I would share!
This is me every morning running late to school because I refuse to go to school with a naked mole rat face.
Lol I don't usually enjoy watching either of you, but this was really funny and enjoyable to watch
I need Nikkie's lip color like RIGHT NOW, I feel like it's from Kylie Cosmetics....
Nikkies outfit is gorg! Love you both
omg the 2 most annoying youtubers did a collab... *still watches & likes*
Some “Ninja shit”
Nikki your top is sooo beautiful! where did you get her?
More videos please!! Love this!
Y’all are sooo gorgeous and funny! I love both of y’all soooo much! Jaclyn you inspire me sooo much and I just wanted to tell you keep doing what your doing!! I love you sooooo freaking much!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hilarious! I think so many of us have done those ninja moves too 😂
I loooove these girls, made my day every time they upload a video
OMG I love y'all together!!!! You both did great
I never thought I'd ever ever ever see this!!!!
Jaclyn is me rushing to get ready for school in the morning.
Why didn't Nikki put lashes on though?
You haven't touched your brows yet! LMAO!
💕💕
WHAT FREAKING HIGHLIGHT DOES JACLYN USE?! HOLY SHIT
Wouldn't it have been easier to just set the timer for 6 minutes instead of waiting for it to reach 4 minutes and then go to 10...?
it takes me 10 minutes just to do my brows..........
Thats Jacylin Hill?! I thought that she was... a not so that kind of a  person.  Shooked
Why don't you post anymore?! I know it's only been 6 days but I NEED MORE!!! 😩
I know you love luminous finish. Can you please do a tutorial on LA girl HD foundation? Thanks Jacklyn!👍🤗
This is proof girls can do there make up in 10 mins. Why do you take 3 hours
loveeeeeeee! such a good video! 😊💋
Hahah you guys are amazing!!! this made me laugh!!! my honey looked at me like what the hell is wrong with her lol 😂😭
CAN YOU DO A BRATZ DOLL INSPIRED MAKEUP LOOK
10 min makeup is what I do when trying to go to the grocers or get donuts. A good quick Glam look takes a good 30-45 min 😅
And yet teenage girls do this every morning. This seriously reminds me of every single morning on the weekdays
Will you do a comparison of the 35O and 35O2, please.
Let me just say first. I love Jaclyn and Nikki. If they just did a classic GRWM video, I would have been very happy. I'm just not a big fan of these challenges videos. I want to see Jaclyn and other beauty gurus just bonding, talking makeup. I get it though. Why they do these challenge videos because they've completely exploded on the YouTube community. These types of videos get lots of views. Not hating at all! Just something I've noticed and wondering if anyone feels the same way? \n\nAgain, I'll say it again,\n\nI LOVE JACLYN AND NIKKI BOTH!!!
OF COURSE! I’m already subscribed to Nikkie’s channel✨
This is me every morning getting ready! 😆😊
Saw Nikki. Clicked
Team \nJaclyn won
I thought nikkie was 40+ LOL
omg when the time came up at 3:21 and nicki rolled her tongue she did it so fast I thought it was sped up
Lmfao I love you both so much <3
Nikkie did that!! She kills it on challenges
I'm here for the Queen en Nikkitutorial's 💄👑 someone else?🤔🤗
Nikkie - NO NO NO and NO on the bushy brows!! That was NOT a good look hun!! :(     ... Stick with the gorgeous way you always do them!! :)
Lmao I shit 4 times last night 😂😂😂 that is why I love you Jaclyn!
This video was so funny 😂😂
Jaclyn is the kind of person who sits next to you in an exam and panics over everything and ends up stressing you out too xD
Awe, that was so much fun to watch! Thanks for the great entertainment and I feel that in this situation I would be acting just like Jacyln! haha :)
This was effing hilarious I was roaring at the shades bit at the end 😂😂😂😂
Why would anyone collab with Jaclyn anything for views Hill? Ugh next!
Does anyone know what brand/ color they used on their lips? I loved both of the colors.
Jaclyn came to win lmfao!!! Love the ninja move😂
Jaclyn can you make a video about your piercings?
All this time she complain about how bad her brows, foundation, etc is... I though it was good. I really need to raise my standard
Love you both!! I’ve been following both of you for years! My favs. Get it girls. 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Where are Nikki's glasses from?
All of my subscriber are all ready subscribed to her😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any small YouTubers want to support each other? ❤️
Video was so funny my fav since your drunk one with your other gf 😂❤️ love you always!
I'm still wondering why they've used stopwatch instead of a timer?
Why did they wait 4 minutes when they could just do the rest of their make up in 6 minutes? 
Honestly this video was hilarious 😂 loved it 😂😂
What color lip is Nikkie wearing? Thanks! Enjoyed this hilarious funny video
Jaclyn looked BEAT TO THE GODS!!! You honestly couldn't tell she spent ten minutes on it.
Yes .... true beauty guru's ! Ain't nobody got time for drama channels ! Keep it clean !
👍🏻
what happed to nicki
Nikkie has the best laugh
Whats with Jaclyn and primers?
Lol Jaclyn is always a mess, so relatable 😂

Hey girl. Just wanted to let you know that Jesus LOVES you. We never know if today will be our last day, so we need to make sure we're going to heaven. Love from Mexico!
Who else is in 10th grade and homecoming is soon
I typed a lot of things about you that were probably true, with no ill intent. All put together they were WAY too mean. So I deleted them and offer this instead.\n\nGrace, Please don't drink so much.
I hate you grace, I'm a hater, deal with it, I have my reasons and I'm not going to tell you, you need to fix your own shit
Hey sweetheart... I genuinely love you...  Because I totally relate..... Gosh... Are you seriously as clumsy as you showcase in your videos... Coz I am guilty AF😂😂
(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\n\nJesus said unto them,\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\n\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\nbut Jesus hid himself, \nand went out of the temple,\n\ngoing through the midst of them, \nand so passed by.\n\n(John 8:58-59).\n\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\n\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\n\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(I AM):\n\n(Gk. ego emimi);\n\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\n\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\n\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\n\nThen answered Jesus \nand said unto them,\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \n\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\nfor what things soever he doeth, \n\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\n\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\n\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \nand sheweth him all things \nthat himself doeth:\n\nand he will shew him \ngreater works than these, \nthat ye may marvel.\n\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\n\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \nand quickeneth them; \neven so the Son quickeneth \nwhom he will.\n\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\n(John 5:19-21).
it has been at least 30 years since your homecoming from college
@gracehelbig \nCan we get some fucken merch going here soon?? I NEED it. Maybe some holy trinity merch?? Come on smellbig, you got it in you. Bring...it....back!
okay but it's Jo-Ann Fabrics, no S on the Jo-Ann.
OMG JOANNS I WORK THERE.\n\n(Sorry I get excited when people mention my employer. Lol)
This was great. Also, Colleen, please participate.
I was very drunk I'm Nashville when I watched this. You're welcome, just trying to keep you on brand!🍾🍷🍸🍹🍺
For my high school's homecoming dances, we were required to purchase and wear a specific homecoming t-shirt each year. So ours was really casual. Kinda bums me out that we didn't get to dress up like all the other schools
you don’t look like you ö
wow -- you have no thighs .... \ndon't worry -- you will ...
Man do I miss some things of HS \n\nand then remember there are things about HS I can't stand lol
3:56 @cinderella much?
Call it the Throw Back Closet Tag - then they have more to work with for past looks.
How come it's been 6 months since you've gotten 1 million views on a video that wasn't about Jake Paul? You have 3 mil subs tho?...
I'm in school right now for fashion design and this both made me mildly cringe and laugh so hard at the same time :D
I actually really like when Grace makes stuff...
I love that she calls 9th grade Grace a stick bug 😂😂😂 bc like 9th grade me was also a bug. Not sure what kind though. Probably a pillbug.
I caught that lol indeed you are getting there lol
Is it even a Grace Helbig DIY video if there isn't a hot glue gun (and a continuous stream of 'ow's) involved?! :D
I can't believe how adorable baby grace was
You're a pretty :s
What haircut is her hair?
“How many fingers is it holding up” 😂
hOMECOMING IS TONIGHT IM WATCHING GRACE WHILE I STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR
I didn't know she was from south jersey. Shout out my homie
I never had homecoming or prom so I never went through that torture. Also there weren't any cute guys at my school, like none, so that helped. Plus my school was small so not a lot of people.
SIGN UP --> ENTER CODES --> GET PAYED!!\nI made $150 just last night XD\nTrying to get referrals! Help me help you! Thank You!\nhttp://pepiredrsa.win/3522403659458/
Love the cute pics of 'Young Grace'!
That dress in 9th grade looks great!  You need to get a real sewing machine and do a video making a real dress from scratch!  That would be amazing, clearly you have mad sewing skills!!!
Lol is Brooks talking about Iowa? And I actually really like your original sophomore year look
I love your hair Grace 😍
I'm kidding i'm kidding, i'm kidding ...my social life in 3 sentences
Grace you are beautiful. But I'm sure you knew that. If you did not know now you know, you're life isn't different now.
This WHOLE VIDEO screams JEEEEERSEY IN THE HOOOOUSE!!!
OK, I think its cute. You are too young for me to date, so can I adopt you?
My school’s homecoming is super casual
Grace - I thought your high school photos were cute.  I have more respect for you knowing you made your own dress.
I have my junior year homecoming tonight!
I feel so honoured. Grace Helbig gave me the rude finger.
THIS IS CONTENT I DON'T WANT TO MISS!!!! thank you grace 😘❤️
Loved it! TBH I could watch Grace do pretty much anything and it'd be the best :)
So, finally I got to learn what Homecoming actually is. As a European who is sort of familiar with various American conventions I heard the term. And I knew the Monkees song :D But that was about it. So educational value: check!
Just looking at that black fabric made me sneeze.
I love when you make Jersey videos!  They make me understood and less alone in my small south Jersey home!
I like the sophomore homecoming ensemble
'And Halloween is the same thing. So I thought it'd be fun to merge the two.'    Flawless logic. I hope someone will combine water and h2o.
If you can, please help me get my car back.https://www.gofundme.com/in-desparate-need-of-car I only have two weeks and I'm desperate. Please.
she went to my highschool
We’ve been graced many, many times
i can’t wait to be Grace From 10th grade Homecoming for Halloween
I thought homecoming was another word for prom.
You should do a ‘will it halloween’ series and try and turn things into halloween costumes x
my last name is Helbig maybe we’re related 😂😂
i don't know what is the difference about before and after!
user psychosoprano better do this
I’m 99.9% sure that the mom from Schitts Creek wears a dress in that type of clothing
3:26 wtf, xD.

Wer ist auch wegen bürkis Insta story hier 😂💪
love him. Wendy annoys me. It feels fake
Love Russell and wish him the best
Russell: “We’re hypnotised by a culture that tells us we’re not good enough...that we have to wear makeup, that we can only better ourselves by what we purchase and consume...”\n\nAudience: *applause* *cheers*\n\nPop-up caption: Still to come - How to look hot for the fall, brought to you by Burlington...
Russell Brand went IN... He even low key called Wendy a crackhead! Hahahaha! He's cunning and witty with a dash of humility. I loved this interview. Lol the crackheads and smackers can unite! Read child!\n\nAnd as a communication studies major he is correct. We are completely saturated in advertising that pulls is into a consumer nation with the profits going to the 1% or other nations (i.e. China, Mexico and so forth). He is smarter than what most would give him credit for and I appreciate him, love Wendy but these interviews show you how shallow she truly is.
So nobody caught that he said he slept with Donald Trump, his daughter, and his wife...lol I love him.
I'm always greatly amused by the reactions whenever Russell shows up on mainstream media. Because they don't understand him he must be severely depraved and mentally unwell. We're all mentally unwell mate, that's his main point.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hilarious
The host looks petrified haha
Wendy is such a lousy interviewer.  Here she has a charismatic, interesting and intelligent guest and she bombards him with so many asinine questions that he can barely finish a thought.  I would've loved to hear more about his thoughts as a new father.  Why is she asking him about his former wife???  Thank goodness Brand is compelling enough to withstand her inanity.
Why does she keep bringing up Katy Perry?
I could listen to him talk for hours. I always think i'm one with words... this man makes me feel like a vegetable.
his intelligence is so sexy
two of my favorite people!
i love me some him. and the way he described addiction is down right beautiful <3
Omg I love him so much. Wendy needs to have him on more often
he got this chick speechless....im so jealous lol
What an incredibly brilliant and attractive mind!!! I could literally listen to him talk all day!
The message is from minute 7:31 to 8:05, and it's brilliant.
Russell is an autodidact.
My spirit animal
hilarious and wise
“...I was ringside, and I use that term deliberately....” \n\n\n🤣
How can you ask a person if he blames himself about his fiend's passing?!?! Asking him if he could have done something to save Amy Winehouse...really?
Aliens have landed! what's not to love?! Let loose, bring out the fantastic in our world!
He's so yummy and smart
He so owned this haha he's so funny!! Anyone else really considering buying the book 👀!
Woke and always sexy ❤️him !
he played you Wendy
Amy whine house love her still this man is so amazing at being himself so funny hahahaha
I laughed so hard. Omg. I love Russel he is a Wildcat. Wendy your great. So much energy...
i just fell in LOVE with russel brand  THAT is why British humor and British blokes rock!
This interview was hilarious! I was laughing the whole time i was watching it. He reminds me of Jim Carey, he cant stick with one topic, he gets all over the place and makes people laugh at his jokes.
I love this man. 😂💛
He’s a bit exhausting hahah but u gotta love\nEm he reminds me of one of my acting coaches from college lmao
Love this guy.. Quite impressed at 9:05-9:15. Truer words have never been spoken. Thanks for exposing yourself in such a way that your example can be viewed as genuine and sincere. I find him funny, entertaining, and highly intelligent.
Love his crazy energy and passion! Handsome man! 😍
Crikeys Russel I didn't know about the mothers bits moving forward like a mound - and I have four children
I love him his accent voice is awesome
Chocolate lake .... he knows what he's doing
Wendy can't controll him
the way he spoke about loosing his friend was touching he is really deep down behind the front face a good guy you can tell.
he's giving her a run for her money, oh how i love being british lmao
Russell was walking and sitting like he is suffering from anal fissures. I hope he gets better.
The idiocies Russell has to endure to promote his book.
Didn't she call him a vampire at one point?
Love Russell but somtimes worry about this exposing.
0:46 Wendy looked at Russell's crotch and said oh gosh I'm so gone!
Too intelligent for the likes of Wendy
This drama obsessed lady and audience are so confused lol
I love him. So down to earth and hilarious
He is funny as hell.. Who cares if he is not popular.. 
I fucking love Russell he's hot funny and naughty all at the same time and a freak in one makes u want to bone him so hard
My God! His humor is everything 🤗🤗🤗
She is a terrible interviewer.
He could also pass as John wick's brother
I sincerely love this guy.. He is very wise.
Unfortunately Russel Brand is the ultimate Wendy Williams guest - his struggle with addiction, fatherhood and how parenthood straightened him out, and the love of a good woman keep him on the right path. Cheers. Unfortunately it made him boring
If this is him sober, then.....
WoW...at first I was wondering...then YESSSSSssss I get what this Man is trying to say...WE DON'T NEED CORPORATE PROGRAMMING...WE DON'T NEED TO BUY WHAT THEY ARE SELLING...WE NEED PROGRESS AS A SPECIES.....WE CAN RULE - BEING OURSELVES WITHOUT THE PRETEND!!!..WE ARE ALL ROYALTY!!!
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. Such a creature of a different frequency SUPER SMART! We GOTTA CATCH UP!
She looks like a lizard person
Russell brand  and Kate winslet  from Titanic would be a great couple he's funny just like her 😂
I love watching his interviews with Wendy lmao. He's so extra, but hilarious and very intelligent.
Wendy was having a hard time following his humor.
Russell is a legend of our time. His life is the realist thing anyone can relate to.
Delightful interview.\nNever knew he was so .... You know\nDelightful😄
He's fell off since the divorce from Katy Perry.
He should have his own show !
This is not a talk show its a gossip show from one of the characters from CATS musical.
I have the animals but haven't gotten to exploiting them yet 😂😂😂😂😂
He is a funny guy!!
Love Russell and interview
Russell Brand is Sexy and Woke AF and he's fucking clever you've gotta love him I'm kinda glad he left America and we have him back haha x
Am I the only one who thinks Russel Brand looks like a young Billy Bob Thornton?
10:30 sounds more like wendy's in the hot seat
The audience is full of horny heifers lmao!
he's so fast i love it
Yeaaaaaaaassssss!!! Consumerism is killing Humanity! You’ve come a long way Russell and so happy you are here❤️💛💚 Stay👁woke🔥
lol Wendy looks so nervous 😂
so cray , hes brilliant
This was brilliant!
Wow. Never seen her so unbalanced. Smashing!
He looks high af
He's hot
*drooooool*
gawd hes ANNOYING af
3:18 Wendy got called out!
Love this guy!!!
5:42 The audience completely missed the ringside joke.
He’s crazy
Brilliant!
Russell - Reader \nWendy - TV Watcher
I love himmmmm omg
He is lovely.
Love him
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
RUSSELL IS ARTICULATE ASF
What a man
Man he's pretentious. Do people really fall for this? He's just regurgitating a word salad of marxism mixed with the problem of hard solipsism most of the time. He thinks consciousness is some undetectable homogeneous energy that exists everywhere all at once and drives our bodies like meat wagons. All evidence indicates that consciousness is an emergent property of electrochemical reactions between billions of innervated neurons and that it ceases to emerge when the reactions can no longer be sustained and your neurons cease to fire...
And this is how TWD started
Twist is probably something like the virus didn't make people violent at all. Somebody respond to this in like a couple months.
Anyone else watching it JUST for Steven Yeun?
Sooooooo......when Glen gets killed his brother Marcelo takes over and kills everyone.
His Hair is so cool #nohomo
Monday morning in the office be like.............
I'd watch it
As an office worker, I dream something like this everyday
I will watch this to support him
I know it would be a terrible joke, but it would have been great if in the scene when he's making weapons he picks up a barbwired baseball bat and looked at the camera.
So this is what Glenn was like before The Walking Dead
oh i miss you glenn TT_TT
Who said Glenn died by Negan, dumbster hero saved him again !
all I can hear is Keith and I'm not okay
The Belko Experiment anyone???! But this looks better
Must have been the sushi lol😎
0:23 Will Smith lookin good in that dress.
Dayum, Glenn. You went full Shane and then leveled up fifty...take a chill pill! ;)
OMG this movie is fuckin' scary!!! I love it
Reminds me a cross between the Belko Experiment, and Quarantine
Previously, on Walking Dead... no wait...
wonder if he'll find a dumpster to hide under....?
Negan hit him so hard that he will keep bleeding for the next two movies
I miss his face! I gotta watch this
Reminds me of that one movie that these people would kill office employees unless the employees would do the killing for themselves.
yesss glenn😁😁😁😁
So he did really hide under the dumpster!
Yuen in a virus movie.  Awesome.  I have never seen him in anything like that.  Bold career choice, Steven...
This is like a retarded version of Fight Club.
chill out we do this everyday in our office killing each other fighting each other backstabbing each other from  8.30 am to 5.30 pm
Kudos to Steve Yeun, he chose an interesting movie to star in. I'll see it.
I don't get it but I love Steven so...I love it.
hey wait a sec. Negan smashed his head in. Otherwise this is totally legit.
The type of movie that will desensitize you to blood.
What the hell is Glenn doing?
Glenn still looks like he just got out of the negan beating hahaha
Oh glenn, you're so much better than this.
subscribe or ill do it.......
Glenn died in TWD and woke up in a corporation in the afterlife to fuck shit up as revenge.
This looks like the belch experiment but better
I hope Steven kill Jeffrey Dean Morgan in this movie
Sooo... this is literally just a “Belko” movie. Or rip-off whatever.
Isn't that Eugene a 1:28?
Can't he do a movie or TV show where his face isn't getting smashed?
another movie for pussies who dont dare to punch someone
Glad to see my chink back in action
Send help, I can't find the release date for this movie, I'm getting March 13th - 17, Oct 7 - 17, and Nov 10th - 17.
He become the walking Dead!
Glen didn't die, Lucille teleported him to another reality  now it makes cents
Oh man i  love to do this in my office.
It's like when you see Daniel Radcliffe in a non-Harry Potter movie
Steven Yeun is my new favorite actor
Looks better than the Belko Experiment.
Damn Glen.  You can't catch a break lol\nEven got Milton on here too lol
I can't believe how many people have seen The Belko Experiment. I didn't know it was that popular.
Milton's in this too a walking dead reunion
So you're going live in hell with zombies and now you're going live in hell with humans who have gone crazy
Will watch this because of Glenn hahaha
Steven Yeung & Blood Violence: Love It!!
Jeez he hit you in the head that hard huh?
It needs more Negan and Lucille, but it's ok
This is were Glenn went when he died
i´m only watching this movie because of Steven
The Belko Experiment.  Did like it when it was called that either.
This is literally TWD inside the Belko experiment
hope steven yeun enjoys doing conventions.
belko expreriment 2
The Belko Experiment: Volume II
Glenn Became a Zombie.
looks dope
Looks actually good.
Cool!

28 days + Belko experiment + the office???
Glenn's Back, MOTHERFUCKERS.
Gleeeeenn!!!!
Welcome back Glenn!
Rage, Steve.\n\nRage.
Gleen is alive!!!
Glenn and Milton reunited
So, we entertain ourselves with movies about people snapping and killing each other, and then we are suddenly horrified when it plays out in real life wondering how anyone could act like that.
Wait...really?  Asian lead in a major hollywood movie?
Fuck this shit up, Glenn. Show them who's the baddest mofo out there
Isn't this The Belko Experiment?
I live in New Zealand... I'm safe!
Not just the rich, most of those I associate with prep, as do I. And its not the end of the world doomsday, AI takeover, Global nuclear war that we prep for. Most of us are more worried about a collapse of our modern infrastructure. Internet, phones, satellites, electricity grid. A mega solar storm would not take long to recover from, but how many millions would die of starvation and disease if the planes, boats and trains stopped for just a few months. I can't live without my heart medication. I don't have a substitute, I don't know where it is made, or how it is made. My life hangs in the balance of our complex supply chain. So yeah, its an effort to reclaim control over my life.
Heh, heh, heh,... rich people are in for a rude awakening if anything big happens..
Wow this channel got political really fast
Armageddon is coming❗  Shop, shop, shop for survival gear...Forget decluttering your home, pursuing your goals and investing in your future.  Stock up and hoard for doomsday.  Live in fear.  
I remember when these guys were good.  I guess they caught liberalism.
I use time travel to get around issues like that.
Thanks it's 3:30 in the morning and this really helped my insomnia. You had to mention Donald
You know you're absolutely right. Fuck them for being so selfish and wanting to look after their families. \n\nYour social agenda must be very fragile if you feel like you need to attack something like self preservation by blaming it on greed.
I grew up as a survivalist. We weren't prepping for future disaster, we were fighting to stay alive in real time in the real world.
Why should someone feel guilty if there rich?
So he did need I surgery?
Why would you feel guilty for being rich? I mean you worked for it you earned it
Here i have been in nz wondering where i would go in an apocalyspe. I guess ill set up a tent in the backyard?
gotta love good old new zealand imma proud kiwi <3
Whistle blows:\n1 = Where are you \n2 = Come to me \n3 = I need help\n\nI would love to have a stash of food.\n\n...but I also try to eat what I have to save money.
I just need a trench coat and a level 3 backpack
Who gives a shit? They have the money for it.
Best way to prepare for the end? Repent, love God with all of your heart, soul, strength, and mind, love your neighbor as yourself (every living being is your neighbor), and treat others how you would like to be treated. This is what Jesus teaches. Pretty simple.
im not really worried about the end of the world scenario, but i have been thinking about preparing an emergency kit once i have been working for a year or two. \nwhile i say emergency kit, im basically talking about having a chest that contains a hiking bag, some long term survival tools (flint or lenses, strainer, survival knife etc.) a one man tent and food that stays good for a long time etc.\nbecause even if there might not be an apocalyptic event happening in our lifetime it is better to be prepared for catastrophes such as war or famine that will not happen rather than not being preparred if it actually do happen.
Why did trump come in this video at all. Lol.
The rich are so out of touch with how normal people live. The 'apocalypse' means a change in their way of life. That change being they're not leeching off the people any more
You guys are like a discount version of Superfruit\nMitch = Mitch\nGreg = Scott
The world isn't going to end, we are. The world will shake us off like a mild cold.
Making fun of trump is gonna get you raped by little kids in the comments...
Leave new Zealand alone man... that's like the last place where politics and stuff aren't disgusting...
The hosts self righteousness is so cringeworthy.
I love you guys❤ you helped me love science❤
What stops security turning the guns on the rich. Honestly 😂🤣😂 why would I protect you. For what?
All the signs In the Quran about the end are coming true too.
Fuck...these guys are just blatantly politically one sided now. You do realize that some of your viewers might be conservative, right? I was wondering why I was unsubscribed and now I remember. Stop alienating a whole chunk of your viewers and just get the channel back to how it used to be.
When society falls, pot farm. Everyone’s an instant friend. A friend with weed, is a friend indeed.
I've been hording the absolute essentials in case of civilization collapses , Toilet paper and WEED.
God damn I wonder what political party you guys chose. Fucking losers
This is one of the most retarded channels in the youtube.I am hoping that the apocalypse arrives soon, so you won't survive beta cucks.
Im poor. Who wants to join me for a raider party.
These two are so stupid i swear
You can demonize anyone but I bet some Puerto Ricans wish they could have prepped.
Meanwhile both of the two in the video are millionaires who have more money than any of the viewers here, and have not given you any money or help.   Pure hypocrites with liberal agendas.
I remember in the 90's I used to get property for sale catalogues sent to me from ads in the back of magazines I was always trying to get people to chip in with me to buy old missile silos which were very cheap then , I knew there would be a great use for them one day , now I could sell them to Rich cunts for loads of money , and then also no where they all are for the end of the world to pillage with my band of mad max mutant people I'd have following me !
You really need to sit on your hands
The days when men were men and women were women, what happend!
This is so pretentious.
Boo hooo, The rich have bunkers and I have to fend for myself.  Guess what, you are not their responsibility.  It's their money and if they wanna spend it on a plan B in case things go south it's their prerogative.
If you're rich buy a condo for the rest of us oh but them buying for themselves is wrong? Lazy assholes
Survival of the richest
What's wrong with Trump
This is the most *cringe* worthy video on the internet. Congrats :/
Isn't the most used language in new Zealand Dutch ?
So we're all just gonna ignore the fact that he's wearing a scouter in the thumbnail?
The being rich makes them guilty and insane..... fucking idiots
I just got a pocket knife under my pillow and a Pringles can in my drawer
Fuck these two guys, they’re assholes who hate people with money
I live in New Zealand 😆😆😆
That white guy is an embarrassment to men everywhere.
The rest of us crumble.\n\nNo, just you.
Uh, I hate to be the one to awkwardly point this out, but your political bias is showing.
After the revolution comrades shall go to New Zealand to rid the world of what is left of the capitalist class.
Rapture my friends 💕 Our Lord is coming soon! God bless you all! 😄
You don't have to suffer the great wrath of God. Put your trust in Jesus and salvation is promised. I overdosed in 2013 and was brought into the glorious presence of God. Jesus Christ is the truth! God is Love and Light. I made a testimony video if anyone wants to watch. God bless you all in the name of the Lord, Jesus.
except that there are waaaaaaaay more poor people who prep for disasters than wealthy
3:48 but.... I can't whistleblow..... guess I'm just gonna die then
Haha Trump bad! Right guys? Please give me likes and views because of my left wing opinions!
This type of prepping, with stockpiling and stuff will only last a certain amount of time. However, developing skills will keep you going indefinitely.
this is a trash vid
This bunker company, is really getting me a vault tech vibe, like the bunker is going to do experiments...
Atlease now I know were suzan collins got her idea for district 13 from.
Watch a video on my channel CJ Collins
What if I can’t whistle
good job blaming everything on trump and people who are good with money.
Christ is coming soon. No life hack would work. Believe in Jesus
Your politics are showing
Why would they be guilty? Also why is Trump a factor in our crazy toward apocalypse world? Trump does not equal end of all life because he was elected. If I was part of the 1% I would not feel a single damn thing about the rest of you while I survive.
I don't need to prep. \nI'm just gonna go into the first disaster I see, and *die*
With Trump, natural disasters, North Korea... Jesus Christ, I don't even like the guy but the number of people finding every excuse to put him on the same list as a fucking hurricane is pathetic.
if I were rich I would give my money way to all of you liberal cry babies so you can stop crying about he's not my president or I need other people to do this for me and I need more rights because this or that happened to people I don't even know hundreds of years ago so SHUT THE F UP
obumer is the one who well help bring do America. obumer is not only a LYING TRAITOR PIG, but he's also a minion of the Antichrist. Lol, which is probably why he's a LYING TRAITOR. EVIL PIG!!!
Why is Trump a reason for people to prepare for societal breakdown? I think liberals fucking everything up is good enough for me...
Re: the reddit guys eye surgery--as someone with such bad eyesight that I would be disabled w/o prescription eye wear,  it totally makes sense to think about being able to see during a disaster. I've definitely thought of it, and I'm just a regular person. I'd be dead super fast if my glasses broke or couldn't be replaced in a disaster. Surving as a blind person is probably next to impossible in the wild. Just playing devil's advocate on that one...

But is it worth living in a world after the apocalypse
Hey you forget somthing ahhh! Cellphone! So if you forgot how to survive u can just type ASAPscience how to survive
Shit Science. I only got a A- on that I can do history though.
Or just scavenge supplies and live in still standing houses 😂😂😂😂
A vegan will survive the apocalypse

All pine trees are edible. ALL pines contain high amounts of  vitamin C. You can chew the needles or boil them to make a  tea.
Hmmm. I think I'll just die
I read the title as “How to Survive The Adpocalypse”.
I thought Vitamin-C was heat sensitive.
I want to see one of you guys on Naked and Afraid now lol.
What about how to survive being locked in a bathroom don't ask how I got the idea    \n\n\n\n\n\nOk I was looked in the bathroom for an hour it's india the door look             are hard to open 😐 🚽🚪😓😲😨😭☠😭😭😭
How often do we really need to bathe?
Woah woah woah... This is a science channel?? You CANT drink cactus water Bc in actuality cactus infused their water w a poisonous substance to protect it, anything that drinks it will get violently ill throwing up and w diarrhea. You will die of dehydration.
too much tannic acid from acorns can be lethal to humans
Can we have a how to save the ADpocalypse
I was studying for a test on electron configuration but an asapscience video popped up. Oh well.
Only certain cactus can be used for water. You should have included that.
we are forgetting that we are 13 billions people on this planet ... that will result in mass hysteria, anarchism and so violence and self-destruction.\nYOU are gonna be the rabbit !!!
If these were realistic zombies just wait until they starved to death. They don't have infinite energy.
The best part of the apocalypse is that the left and right coast will be the first to go, and all the libtards will go with it.
How do you boil something in the wild
Im like that the only person that doesnt wear skinny jeans thats for pussies
How to Survive out in the Wild: Watch Primitive Technology.
Damn. Is this fore shadowing? Should I write some of these down??
actually most survival experts consider the water just reaching a boil to be adequate.Since any heat of that level kills pretty much everything.
My burning question is: How is it that people can outgrow food allergies? I'm overall curious about the science of food allergies.
DO NOT EAT RANDOM CACTUS FOR WATER!!!   Many Cacti are poisonous.   That's a real scientific fact.
What is water memory
I Like this video althought I loved Asapscience once but now most of your videos are overrated and packed with LBGT.... \nGood things always end up fast 😟😟😟
Do the Mandela Effect
This isn’t related to the video, but my school puts your videos in some of the video announcements they play, and they legit don’t say who it’s from or where.
You can still loot old buildings and stuff
You guys got some information wrong in this video. Make different video, I'm only at the snow water part so I'll have to finish the video before adding more.
Thanks
What if the world don’t have internet
Uhh.. isn't cacti poisonous? Pretty big myth that you can just slice and drink out of a cacti
How do you hicup
DO NOT BURN CEDAR
Please do the science of cold showers!! Should us as humans shower with cold water?
Says how to survive in the forest\n\nDoesn't say ho to survive the zombie apocalypse.
How about in a tropical country?
It is damn near impossible to get close to a wild rabbit unless your the flash wth
I'd rather just kill myself
the water contained in cacti actually has a type of poison that makes you sick though also you should melt the snow before eating it because just eating raw snow will lower your body temperature
The VO in this video mispronounces AND misuses the word integral.
Will be helpful when the world supposedly ends on 13th October because of planet Nibru xD
Regarding acorns, by always safe, do you mean they're hypoallergenic too?

Try to consider making a video on whether its better to put soap on your hands before you wash you hands, or while your hands are wet during your hand wash.
Vegans,\nThis is why we need to be tentative. Ergo; sorry, not sorry Chickens but until then, yous safe and are my non edible friends.
Do NOT eat snow. Melt it first or you risk lowering your body temperature. Remember water freezes at 0 degrees Centigrade but it can be much, much colder.

Every one is talking about this😐y?

Hello, my name is Jinny Anna. I am 14 years old and I want to ask everyone a question. How can a young ugly girl become a youtuber? 😭
Why does it look like blake is wearing makeup in the thumbnail (not that there's anything wrong with that) but really isnt in the video

BLAKE'S FALSETTOOOOOO
...  Brad Pitt :v ?
Its amazingg
The pianist's song choices are so delightful! I heard Abba, The Beach Boys and a swath of musicals in there, and I'm sure there were more. What a treat. 💛
I just adore Alexander Campbell!  He is both a magnificent dancer but also seems like a gentleman!
Can we take a minute and appreciate the pianist?? What an amazing job :) :)
Does anybody else just LIVE for videos like this, because they can't take ballet themselves?
I squealed when Alexander Campbell appeared.
oh my god, mamma mia into rhapsody in blue. so perfect!
Vadim😍. So, so elegant, even in class.
The pianist likes his musicals!
My eyes always go straight to Sarah Lamb whenever she's on screen. Olga is also such a great teacher, I'd love to have a teacher as sweet and straight to the point as her.
I so appreciate the pianist's inclusion of Monty Python's Lumberjack Song
Every year there's someone pregnant hahaha!
Thank you for this video!!♡
What's the song at 1:30:00 ?
Simplesmente maravilhoso !  Excelentes bailarinos e belíssimos coreógrafos.
Sae Maeda already stands out and she’s one of the newest. I knew she was going to be something when I saw her perform at Prix de Lausanne. Cannot wait to see her perform principal roles someday!
Anyone know the song from Frankie and Alex’s duet of The Dreamers Ever Leave You? I’m in love with the song!! All I know is the composer and I can’t find it anywhere... Help!!
The most wonderful ballet company.  From Ashton and Fonteyn to the MacMillan years, and now the innovative and fabulous young choreographers and dancers of today\n - The Royal will always remain my favourite company in the world.
The piano player was so impressive, always played the right beat for the right length
No inicio os exercícios são simples mas tem que ter precisão mesmo. Eu amei ♥♥
so beautiful wow i love ballet
I literally WENT to a ballet class, then I came home to WATCH a ballet class 😂
Who could thumbs down this?? lol lol love this teacher she's adorable much love!
Love!  'Mr. Cellophane for tendu from 5th!  Thank you!  :-)
Thank you soooo much for the video!! It was a great day! :-)
Okay.. so I was impressed with the pianist but saw others had already mentioned him in the comments and figured I wouldn't add to it--until he played the tutti opening of tchaikovsky's piano concerto... this guy is amazing!!!
Does anyone recognize the tune at 53:48?
I practice ballet in Panama
1:30 into the tape is a fantastic ballet
Olga makes all this up? Someone let her choreograph her own ballet please👍👏👏😂
I love all the different styles of their clothes :D
Thank you SO MUCH for the videos! Couldn't watch it live but I've now watched this afterwards 2 times already!
What's the song at 37:40??
After the last year's disastrous presentation by Darcy, the World Ballet Day has become immensely enjoyable again. I love Kirsty and Alexander's supportive attitude towards their great colleagues.
What’s the song at 01:30:00?
My favorite time of year, I just love watching World ballet day with the royal ballet every year
look at the men in the Royal Ballet their feet their bodies their technique their turns Etc and look at the men in San Francisco Ballet and it is so embarrassing for sfb these days
(if only the commentators would stop talking...)
I Love😍 World Ballet Day!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
God, my calves are killing me just watching those 16 rises  😭 😭  Relevés and frappés were my most dreaded exercises in ballet lmao
I always love Royal Ballet's class in World Ballet Day :)
Why wasn’t Yasmine Naghdi in class? I was really looking forward to her in class this year, she’s so lovely! So happy she was promoted to Principal this year!!
At 1:09:45 the music is I could have danced all night from My Fair Lady. And at 1:10:55 My favourite things from The Sound of Music.
I love watching Olga teaching. She's so nice and vibrant. She pays so much attention to the details and to each and every dancer. The dancers seem to  like her very much, too!
You know I noticed that the Royal dancers were all very honest with their turn out. I recall watching some Russian ballet company classes last year the dancers all had their feet 180 flat in first position and one dude even had his toes pointing backwards in second position - a bit freaky to be honest. There are many things I adore the Royal Ballet for and now I discovered one more. It is my favourite ballet company of all : )
As good as calf rises are they should be doing it turned out , so they don't bulk up muscles that aren't needed when the legs are turned out.
I love this company and Olga's classes so much ❤
I always love the live stream on world ballet day! ❤️
Could I get any information about musics in this video?
I loved what O'Hare said - we can do more together to bring awareness to ballet as a vital art form than we can each standing alone. Collaboration among art companies in the US has always seemed too politicized to work, as each is trying to beat out each other for limited funding, etc. Everyone seems out for themselves a bit. Worldwide there seems to be a lot more opportunity to come together and be a stronger louder voice that's needed to keep critical arts like ballet alive and thriving as we are stronger together than apart. This is such a lovely experience every year, thanks to ROH and all the companies that share intimate coverage of their beautiful creations, dancers, and processes.
squealed when i saw vadim - love that guy!
There's something hypnotic about watching class.  Fumi looking drop dead gorgeous here.
what a wonderful teacher, i also love her barre combinations!
I am an aspiring ballet dancer and watching this really inspires me.I hope I can be there with you one day.Every year is better than before.Congratulations!
Can we talk about Steven McRae at 44:15?
The class of Olga Evreinoff is very fun. But I am waiting for Brian Maloney's class. Can I see his class again? Is Brian a class teacher in World Ballet Day 2018?
ROH channel, thank you for uploading the whole thing! I never get to watch it live. This is my favorite stream from the World Ballet Day!
Who's the guy in the black tights and white tank top that looks like it has bananas on it?? I'm really enjoying his dancing.
I just missed Natalia Osipova in class :(
Love the sound of music in there
I find ballet dancers fascinating because of their commitment to hard physical work coupled with their artistry.  I admire each dancer's accomplishment to get to this level.
1:02:22 is so me when i screw up and 1:02:50 is me when i think i'm at the club when i'm in class
Oh! I was so glad to see Nadia in the first class! If she is into her apprenticeship then I wish her the best of luck for a contract!
I love how this year they keep the camera on the dancers so you can still follow along while they're commentating instead of going to the commentators and missing part of the warm up class.
I love how the pianist went from Là ci darem la mano (Mozart's Don Giovanni) to Wagner's Treulich geführt (Wedding march) What an irony.
They guy at 1:02:23 is literally me everyday 😂
Love to see all the dancers.  They work so hard and create such beautiful art.  Grateful for their dedication.
Olga's class! Love it!
The talent of the young dancers from the Royal Ballet School is amazing.
I hear a Swiss song as training melodie :) at 1.06---- Vo Luzärn uff Wäggis zue :)
Steven McRae's chaines at 44:18 holy crap!
I love Olga!
Leticia Stock, so beautiful!
AWESOME!  I ADORE BALLET.
frankie's legssss
What is the music of 'rond de jambe a terre'?
my legs hurt watching them lol
Olga -amazing teacher
Steven McRaes but😍😍
Marianelaaaaa!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Love this ! Delicious !
Tchaikovsky pdd😍
Does osipova appear somewhere?
Ahhh <3 <3 <3. The pregnant ballerina is definitely goals!!! :D xxxx
1:16:15 'cause its just not World Ballet Day without Nela :)
Love Vadim!
What’s the music for the dreamers ever leave you ??
Who is the Asian male dancer in the black socks and green tights?!
talk the talk .... you'd think they'd sort the picture quality oot        , shabby cunts         . love the dancers tho
Horrible! Royal Ballet is a piece of shit
Sadly no Natalia Osipova, she's been with TRB since 2013 - never seen her dance live or in the cinema, boo hoo :-(
Can anybody tell me what the song at 30:20 is?
do they dance at their own time..
Whoops! I spelled her name wrong. I meant to write Yuhui Choe.  Is she still with the company?
when will this be deleted??
Steven Mccrae😍 hope i spelled that right
38:30 men's butt in tights...
EEEEEK!!!! Alexander has a hairy chest AND a nice ass!!! (jumping and screaming like a fangirl with panties falling on the floor).
Where is Yuhui Choe pls?
Talking about the rehearsal of the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland, the guy in purple (Fernando?) is definitely not as good as Eric Underwood in this role back in the original production. Maybe he's still young and has to learn but Eric's Caterpillar was just so much more sexy and fascinating and his movements much softer, bigger and more elegant and worm-like.
Только не прыгай, Вадик! XD  36:48
Adam is so caring and empathic <3 very nice complement for Eva :) what a nice couple, blessings!
Be suuuuuuper careful washing her face, do it separately from the bath
pork blood is used in black pudding i believe
Try not to wash her ears because water and shampoo can cause deafness to her or other ear problems  :/
It’s pigs blood-so basically pork like a sausage
I have a dog named Muneco in English is boy doll
The blood is from pig, cause a long time ago they didn’t want to waste any part of the pig.
Gurl your boyfriend is just the most handsome guy alive. You lucky ❤❤❤
At 6.26 the houses look like the ones from Paddington
So cute!\nIt melts my heart!!!💖😘😍💖😘😍💖😘😍💖😘😍
whats the song called
Black pudding is made of pig blood! Here in norway we eat that as dinner alot, and often with potatos, bacon, carrots and syrup. Its an usual course in norway👍
You can't just say Puppies First Bath Time and not give us a full dog on your sweet puppy :(
it's good for your dog🐕
The black pudding is pigs blood xxx I’m British so enjoy!! Xxxx
It's pig Blood
Black pudding has blood sausage in it
Also menudo is also just made with pork belly and also dinuguan

If I see a man in the airport who's riding on the suitcase I will know for sure that it's Adam
When will you come to philippines? :( please
Hi! Im from the philippines. And yes it is DEE-NOOH-GOOH-AN as DINUGUAN hahahahaha but it's basically pork blood 🤣
Its shampoo time\nWhat flavor is it? \nRlly what flavor is it..
It's sheep blood
That is not a full English breckfast and it is pig blod
Just to let you know black pubbing is made out of pig blood and it's sometimes on a British breakfast
eva don’t wash her ears bcs she can get an ear infection just saying
Pls show some respect, some culture eat these food. It’s ok if u don’t like it, but saying ewww or disgusting or gross is like disrespectful to other cultures that eats dinuguan or menudo. But I still love u, nice vlog anw.  <3
THE DAILY AWWW     \nAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Wtf is a dude wearing a thumb ring for 🙄, nvm fuck boi verified
I'm from the Philippines and I love dinuguan and Menudo. If you don't like pork's intestine you can substitute it with meat and it tastes like spaghetti without the noodles, don't forget to top it up with some grated cheese. And the dinuguan is pronounced as Di.Nu.Gu.An
here I am, it's 2am and I'm watching a dog have a bath
bruh omg I have tried tripe and its really good so offensive Eva
I'm Hispanic and I don't even like menudo

I'm from Newfoundland, Canada and those black things are called blood puddings. I've had them my whole life. The ones I have are good

No offence to these people but I only watch the parts with the puppy lol
OMGGGG HOW MUCH WAS UR DOG HOW MUCH IT WAS I WILL GIVE U THE MONEY AND U GIVE ME THE PUPPPY
Tripe isn't that bad my family loves it they eat in menudo but I don't like it
you should not wash her ears especially since she has floppy ears, if the water gets trapped in side her ears it can grow fungi
Tip: next time when you give her a bath try not to put water on her ears because they are very sensitive
I loiked up tripe thinking I was a dare devil👹👹👹👺👺But no I clicked right off it holding my hands to my mouth😂😂😂
You two are so wonderfull together. OMG😊
It’s pigs blood\n\n\n\n\nI think??

Black pudding is made of pig blood i think. In Norway we just call it Blood pudding.

Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww  my dog loves baths
Whats the flavor? 😂😂
I'm sorry, but you should really have done some research about the breed before getting one :( I'm a 15 year old who's never owned a dog, yet even I know that 1. Golden have very sensitive ears so you shouldn't just wash them carelessly, and 2. You can't just use random human shampoo on an animal. Please do some research for the dogs sake
pig blod
The poop transplant animation was awesome! Lol!.😂😁😂
How to cure cancer ??\n\n\n\n\n\nShove up shit in your arse
oh my, if only our bacterias are as cute as in the bacterias in this vide
I want to fap,my bacteria tells me to 🤣
kurzgesagt never disappoints... love your video.... Always learning something new.
Do you dance or sing in the car?
lovely way of explaining all of this. from a microbiome nerd.
This is actually so fascinating to learn about. One of the things that always made me picture eating healthy as difficult is how I always crave sweets and fatty things, but never much cared about fruits and vegetables. To think that not only can eating healthy things effect my gut bacteria like this, but that I can actively _change_ the things I crave to eat!\n\nIt's true, too. For the past few months I've had a much more balanced diet with plenty of vegetables in it, and I've actually been finding myself craving those as much, sometimes even more, than the kind of unhealthy things I used to. So cool!
The information is really interesting
Great video it had some great information!!!
This video leaves me totally paralyzed. This increased abruptly at about 6:20
How dare the immune system kill a microbe
Great. Now I need to tell my pizza loving bacteria to shoo without offending them...\nHmm.
6:48 Made them LESS sensitive to insulin? errm.. you meant MORE right?
Hey! Could I request something?Like the inner body functions? Would be awsome like how body digestion, stuff like that. :)
Bacteria have been around before Dinosaurs ever existed
4:09 That's because you've been feeding them guts you monsters!
This is the plot of John Green’s Turtles All the Way Down
Alright, bacteria. We can have pizza, but we must have a veggie pizza.
Truly fascinating, and wonderfully made. Thank you.
MarshMello needs to see he isn’t alone.
next time hospital be like healthy poop donor needed xD
So that is why when I eat a lot of chocolates, I feel addicted.
So that's why some people like canableisim
Another great video from big K
Literally got myself a bottle of probiotics after watching this video.
How could this relate to Intermittent Fasting? Seriously though; looking for educated opinions on the matter. Cool video!
If anyone's interested in fixing their gut-microbiome without a poop transplant, you should give Amare a try. Their supplements help the microbiome rebalance itself while helping to repair the gut-brain-axis for better brain function, mood-neurotransmitter imbalances, or immune problems. https://amare.com/10060.
Where can I find the sources used for this video?
Amazing!!! My family and I love this channel
That is so fucking interesting
Jokes on you, I have no serotonin left.
Thanks, Bill and Melinda G., for sponsoring such amazing content.
I'm surprised that the Bill and Melinda Gates foundations supports Kurzgesagt
A bacteriocracy, if you will.
so you want to tell me, that fucking bacteria are affecting my intelligence?
New job: poop people. People kept in the best condition so they can give others their good poop
I'm trying to breed bacteria that can digest a gallon of sriracha.

So... the fastest way to a man’s heart really IS through his gut.
I have a gut feeling that this is false.
Do a video on consciousness
Microbes must love the likes of chocolate...I crave it.
I guess the majority of kurzgesagt’s subscribers must be 11 years old, judging by this comment section.
There's already research being done on genetically modified gut bacteria to cure all sorts of diseases.  Keep in mind that a lot of our gut bacterial already produce substances that act as drugs (have a direct chemical effect on our body).  \nhttps://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/10/03/genetically-engineered-gut-bacteria-may-replace-pill-delivering-drugs/
The future of medicine. Is poop transplants? Somehow I did not see this coming.
This sorta make me proud. Like I have a little society inside me
What about vegan and vegetarian? Have they got overgrown green vegetable bacteria like fat people with fast food bacteria?
at 0:14 did they intentionally make the fleshy pink one on the tongue look like a dick?
If we are so codependant, is there still meaning speaking about bacterias as organisms different from our selves? why is my immune system me and not these bacteria that I can't live without?
Don't tell me there's nothing I can do about the micobes all over me! Excuse me while I go take a bath in molten steel to prove you wrong.
Now I'll never feel alone
this is warning you can eat fast food but dont eat it too many
holy shit, poop transfer? I learn something new everyday..
I love your videos
This was an amazing video!  I knew it could affect cravings, but never thought a fecal transplant could cause obesity!  Holy crap!  No pun intended.
wait kurzgesagt, you're british and it said Mom at 4:40, I smell a conspiracy theory
I'd like some healthy poop!
This isn’t very scientific but can you do a zombie apocalypse episode
well\nhopefully a germaphobic person doesnt watch this
Is it just me, or was this video *_full of shit_*
This video gives a whole new meaning to give me your shit
Well then since I'm healthy and I was born through c-section, then I'm pretty lucky then
Pooptransplant, well that’s a new one.
The only thing I've learned from this video is that when a baby is born via c-section, you have to rub the baby all over the mothers vagina for a duration of an average birth to give the child a healthy start.
Wow shit 90% of serotonin wtf
poop transplant is catchy
BRING SKINNY PEOPLES' POOP TO MURICA NOW!!1!!!11
Kurzgesagt pls make a video on teleportation
Anyone who has scientific references to this subject? Great video by the way.
any smart, happy, healthy people here? can i eat some of your shit please?
Cant take somebodies Crap? Well you may just have to...

You always give cells personalities making me feel for them and junk!!
So do I eat too much healthy stuff? Sometimes I refuse to eat fast food, even when I'm starving.

Not my proudest fap

Amazing Video... Great Job 👍🏻
Amoeba?
wtf. literal feces transfers wtf ew.
Why are they called blasters when they are regular firearms that fire projectiles?
In what way are those silly blasters supposed to be better than something like the current FNX-45, or 10mm Glocks?
Oh hey, a batch of flowers are behind him, the same that were on...... I wont say.
Where was Luv's blaster???
CG muzzle flash...ok...but how did they recreate the recoil? It looks great in the film.
If Adam would get his hands out of the way we could see the actual gun
I really love Adams reaction to these props.  I guess I look at things a bit more pragmatically, to me Functionality means more than Form, a reverse thinking process than Doug Harlocker I agree, and taking nothing from his creativity or skills which are AWESOME.  I always look at a weapon prop and wonder in my mind just how it would work IRL.  What type of weapon it is, charged particle, projectile or what have you.   I have yet to see the Film and am hoping I can afford to buy it soon, I am really looking forward to the props and such.
I could totally see Adam trying so hard to contain his excitement.
Original is still better, but I'll take it.
Adam is like, this new gun is fugn lame and uninspired. I can see it in his eyes.
.......are those gigantic bottles of liquor at 4:45? Johnnie Walker?
Blade Runner 2049 Johnny Walker Black Label bottle on the window in the Background?
surprised Adam didn't find a way to work on this.\n\nshould've looked at competitive shooting handguns.
These Blasters are beautiful...and inside the Peli cases they look even more bad-ass
Couldn't get my fucking eyes off that Ducati Evo in the back
Come on adam one day build next
You can see Adam’s happiness doing this. I mean he can’t stop smiling and he’s almost jumping in place... it’s awesome how passionate he is
Love your series.
I know its not, but adams hat looks like its backwards
It's always fun to see Adam look like a kid in a candy store, just puts a grin on my face.
anyone know what leather jacket that guy is wearing, maybe schott?
The Ducati Motorcycle in the background is not even necessary for me to tell this guy rides a Ducati, just sayin.
Great hat Adam!
I'm really curious what kind of leather jacket the prop master is sporting
I'm curious what type of ammo the new blaster uses, like is it bullets or is it an energy weapon? I only ask because it doesn't look  like it has any place to load traditional ammo.
Using a real gun in the prop sticks with the post modern feel of Blade Runner, the new one looks like some shit from the sci fi channel
Wasn't the old blaster a replica made by Tomenosuke?\nThey also got the permission to use the Blade Runner 2049 logo on the boxes of their latest batch.\nI can't understand why they are not addressing it and give Tomenosuke the proper recognition.
I don't get how in 30 years the blaster develops only into a single trigger difference really. Still a gun
Lol, Adam is already measuring and taking memory pictures to make his.
Fact it could not function as a real gun completely kills the cool factor. Its just a toy not a blaster.
Four words which will make you think of one movie:  Three Fifty Seven Magnum.
Lets hope Mr. Savage took measurements and all do to we do not want the blaster guess work all over again.
I love the bottles of Johnnie Walker in the background!
oooo those are noice...than handle is sweet....that recoil is so awesome...reminds me of time crisis
Anyone else distracted by the beautiful Ducati in the background?
I would love for Tested and Adam to take a look at some of the weapons from Dark Matter on Netflix.
For someone who really, really hates guns, Adam Savage really, really loves guns
Where was this filmed it looks very much like the Netherlands
I really have to rewatch Blade Runner again. it's been far too long sense the last time.
so k's sidearm is a blow forward receiver?
the new one looks on the barrel bbut the original's handle is so much cooler
how much did the one with the wood handle cost?
Should of based the new gun on a Luger i feel like if you modded it right it would function and look awesome.
Now the real question is will they help those who are interested in the parts of the gun (if it is made of any real items not completely sculpted new) with showing them what its made of. Or will it be another 20+ years of fans working together.
Adam review 2049 please !!! I wanna hear what you think.
Do we really need more videos about guns right now? Plus the movie is boring garbage.
Sorry to say but the movie was dumb, I didn’t understand it
Like a kid in a candy shop
Adam Savage, what a damn savage.
i was really waiting for Doug to be like well you can keep one if you like that would have been awesome lol
Most iconic handgun? More so than Dirty Harry's 44 magnum? Bond's Walther PPK? Robocop's Autopistol? I mean, yeah, it's a cool gun, but I don't think it makes the top 10 of things  that come to mind about Blade Runner.
although I respect the work and effort put into the new blaster, I just don't like the new design of it... just looks like your typical futuristic pistol, doesn't look as iconic and special as the first blaster
I love to see someone as acomplished as Adam get all giddy over something.
Where's the latest This Is Only a Test podcast?
They made it grey and generic, nice
He needs to learn how to trim his beard properly. Looks silly that high up.
How disappointing that you guys didn't even bother showing us close up comparisons. Verging on pointless!
Idk if this info exists but in the world of Blade Runner 2049, what caliber does that gun shoot?
Did anyone else notice the Jack Daniel's bottles ?
Can Doug and his crew redo the weapons for Alien: Covenant? That was such a cop out for them to use basic AR-15s and Steyr AUGs instead of coming up with something original like in Aliens.
Didn't like the new one. It's a beautiful desing, ok, but it lacks the mix of old and new, the revamped art deco look that made the original Blade Runner so influential and unique.
Not a particular fan of this new blaster design. I can't quite put my finger on it. :s
Next gen gun is ok but they should have kept the grips closer to the earlier version.
music at the end... Vangelis?
New gun looks like a super soaker
Adam Savage acts like a NRA poster boy.
I thought 2049 was better than the original movie, but I'm not crazy about the new blaster. They did the classic sci-fi designers pitfall: Making it look overly cool and sacrifice function for form. I also just don't think it looks that cool. The original gun felt grounded and real, and had a very unique look. This new gun feels overly designed.
Why does it have two holes at the end?
Looks like Timecop Beretta with ugly handle. Original is much better.
Still surprised there isn't any Blaster homage in Destiny.
I wonder if Adam is capable of being disappointed, or if his excitement and enthusiasm always carry him beyond his expectations? I have a feeling that Ridley Scott could stub a cigarette out in a dog turd and Adam would be waxing lyrical about the aesthetics.\n\nI mean, the props do look good (as you might expect on a $150million+ production!) but I strongly suspect that however they looked he'd struggle to see anything wrong with them.
Damn it you lazy bastards! Get off yer asses and take & upload a cam already!!
Does Adam Savage Dream of Electric Sheep? Probably not but I bet he dreams of building the 2049 Blade Runner Blaster! ;-)
Adam please made me a accurate blaster please of Deckard. with flasing fire and sounds and heavy handguard
I just realized, is Adam wearing his hat...backwards? xD
I know they're fake guns, but my heart stopped when I saw Adam pointing it right at that dude's chest
And I bet Doug was thinking Adam is such a legend
It's funny. I really don't care about most of this nerdy stuff, but I really enjoy Adam and appreciate the craftsmanship of the people who make these props and replicas so I watch anyway.
Honestly... the reason movies these days loose the excitement of older movies is because everything is CG! If you're making a gun, make it fire! Stop going the cheap and easy route of making fake props!
Deberían poner un reglamento que prohiba el uso de armamento a los particulares NO ME GUSTA ESTA VIDEO
2:32 Hans Zimmer recording his score in the background
That red ducati in the back is so sick too.
💕💕💕💕💕💕 Adam
Is it just me, or does the old gun look way better? The new one looks like a goofy and generic comic book rip.
proposed like order ygaxxli okay extend quantity operating extra hand worth.
Amazing movie
Definitely still could have fired blanks
Adam's hat, anyone?
My precious!...
Meh
Thank you!!
Thsnks Adam
No close Ups?
That Gun
why is adams' hat brim backwards?
sorry they ruined it
That's a borderland gun lmao. Jakobs'
Doug should have given credit to Tomenosuke & Adam knows better. They may have made one Hero from scratch but most of those blasters are a kit from Tomenosuke; not fabricated by hand from scratch like he is claiming.\n\nThat is why Adam is not raving over the classic blasters and is fascinated by the rubber one and the new versions.  It's because he knows what they are and has several.
The new blaster is shit.
movie was crap
Go Airsofting or Paintballing xD
You should go see blade runner 2049 😂😂😂

Very interesting. Being Muslim and European I feel I've spent a lot of time thinking about the places where Islam and Christianity and Judaism intersect, thinking about different ways of looking at the proverbial mountain. There are multiple times when little kids have asked me 'eres monja?' meaning 'are you a nun?' because of my hijab. Or family members have asked whether halal is the same as kosher, or if lent is the same as Ramadan. In Islam, we believe that the three religions are a continuation of each other, they were sent to us in that order so that they could complete each other, across history we followed the message of the same god through different prophets, Abraham Moses Jesus Mohammed. Imam Ali has this great quote that says 'a person is either your brother in religion or your equal in humanity' and more people need to live by that\n\nSorry for the rant, it just saddens me that there is so much division between muslims, between believers, and between people :/
I have never heard of the Overton Window, but I love that it has a name that I can go and get more info on. I definitely believe in that concept but didn't have a word for it. There are some unshakeable truths in my life, but most things I love getting other perspectives on. \nAlso that drink at the end made me crave hot chocolate so thanks for that lol
so interesting! would love for you to talk specifics & unpack this at some point :)
this was so crazily mind-opening.\nthank you for this monologue!
I'm not religious. I'm open to spiritual concepts and metaphysical musings, though after 55 orbits around the sun, I've seen and heard most arguments. \nBut like you, I have some non-negotiables. Racism, homophobia - prejudice in general which is based on fear, I am unpersuadable (I think I just made that word up) when it comes to what my conscience dictates on such matters.  People are people, and I abjectly refuse to entertain biases based on what someone is. They are a person, that's what. If I have to judge someone, I want to base it on _who_ they are, not what.
You are really cool. Just fyi.
Great video. It's given me a lot to think about, or perhaps just a different way to think about things. Thank you!
I think a problem with the mountain metaphor is that not all view points are right. Like you said: racism. That's never going to be a valid way to view the mountain. I saw a graphic today that showed two people looking at a number from opposite sides. From the perspective of one of the people, it was a 6, and a 9 from the other. They were arguing about whether it was a 6 or a 9. Only one of them was right, though, because whoever drew the number there purposefully made a 6 or 9. The view point could only be solved by using context clues, asking questions, and having a discussion about its purpose and history. I felt it was very poignant, and maybe relevant to what you're saying in this video. Loved this one :)
I love your creativity, balance, intellect. Really enjoyed your last few vids in particular, with views on this, and what it is to be british, etc. All the best to you. :)
Wow! very interesting idea! I think I'm going to do and research this idea further... thank you :)
so articulate, love your vids and the food for thought
Was the theologian in hot pants Marika Rose?
Wonderful video! Great concise thoughts for us to mull over! Thank you for sharing. I love the mountain analogy and am definitely looking that up.
I think you'd find Dr. Jordan Peterson really interesting! ❤️️
Ahhhhh how refreshing to hear!  There’s so much to learn from in what you said in terms of how to listen to people of a different view to you! 👏🏻 Never heard of the Overton window before but will read up more on it.\n\nIf you have time, I’d highly recommend listen to a theologian called Michael Ramsden. Namely his one on whether Christianity is intolerant. (Clearly coming from a Christian perspective). The entire talk is interesting, but in responding to a question in the Q&A ( see 52:20 onwards) he unpacks a particular Oxford study on freedom of speech and the capacity to disagree which I think you might find interesting.\n\n(Please do inbox me your thoughts! Or if you find it intriguing enough, make a video!) ❤️
Hmm that mountain part made me think of Impressionism. As a creative, I think a lot about whom I'm trying to communicate with. I've been obsessed with thinking about the the lay viewer instead of professionals and colleagues. Got me thinking again!
Love this idea and love Greenbelt, are you going next year? I should be 🙌🏻
I'm basically persuadeable on anything relating to what istrue.\n\nIt's a few of the fundamental ought questions that I'm firm in.
Freaking L O V E  Greenbelt! Hope you had an ace time xoxoxo
I wish more people would be like you, Leena!
Very interesting concept  I've been thinking about this lately without knowing how to name it :) Lots of love from Luxembourg
have a good time
I think thinking i like your thinking, however overton windows? they are too basic. Saying RACISM is one, but that's too simple to me. This may be because i was a scientist, but in my opinion i think it's too basic a term. one key on my keyboard is broken and you will see which one in a moment. i heard the saying minorities are no problem for people until they become the magority (yes i know it's not spelt with a g!) and i think to understand or be wrong about something one has to delve deeper into the cause of that group of ideas. As far as i can tell it is very instinctive and in our DNA to appease evolution, evolution is unsurpasable..one can not override it with logic or environment or education. parts of evolution never leave our brains, and that part is the part we should look at. EVen the FEAR element behind racism is a massive indicator of things. I think , yes we can be prepared to be wrong, btu we must be prepared to delve much deeper into the whys not just the result to figure out how best to tackle this in society and come to an understanding with other people on earth. it may be unshakeable..but that does NOT excuse you from delving deeper, these people still have valid feelings, regardless of how utterly distasteful they are to us, and understanding more can be the key to actually changing things. it is so easy to dismiss fear based reactions, like the gun owning argument (yes i know it is more complicated) and bombing another country on account of a group of individual's actions and justifying it using blame factors like religion ro such to then make it seem like the whole country are terrorists in order to dispense bombs that rip civilians apart. and the others throwing their hands up in despair and grief at the actions. look into the actiual origin of the thinking to find the clues. these things are too big to generalise.
i've missed your videos like this, this was so interesting, tysm!!
This is very true. With the whole birth control thing going down in the US I got into a couple of twitter discussions and it was really interesting to see the way different people would have different levels of flexibility around the discussion, and also the way a lot of people would cling to an absolutist viewpoint. I talked to a lady who had the general view of 'This shouldn't be included in healthcare because sex not for procreation is immoral' and I suggested that most people using birth control are married with children, and should surely be able to enjoy sex within their lawful loving all-american marriage without risking pregnancy every time... and she said no. Much of the arguments were incredibly hyperbolic on both sides, but that particular instance really stood out as someone who probably didn't really believe what they were saying, but would not budge from their principle. \n\nThere's a book called 'The Righteous Mind' by John Haidt and it looks at why so many of us (myself included a lot of the time) refuse to budge from our political and religious standpoint even when presented with ideas that do make sense. It gives an insight into why Trump supporters are still on board and why the media on both sides has a lot to answer for, it's not the most engaging read, and it's from 2012 so it's a little outdated BUT it's definitely a valuable resource.
I enjoyed this!

Fabulous thoughts, as always <3
Be Vegan cause using animals as products is shit.
This is why it bugs me when we're separated into two and only two groups (left and right or whatever). It makes it harder to find my neighbors.
1st one
So just to add to the concepts in this video, the thing about the mountain actually is kind of making another point as well - that even if you're sitting on one side of the mountain and seeing one thing and someone else is seeing something entirely different on the other side, you're both still looking at the same mountain, and neither of you are wrong. The mountain of course being an allegory for life, the universe, right and wrong etc, the point is that just because you absolutely cannot see another person's point of view, doesn't mean the point isn't valid and real from where they're standing! I think it's a really interesting metaphor that can help you view the world more dynamically! Sincerely, Grew Up In A HIGHLY Philosophical Household

trending with 2.8k views 🤔\n\nSo anyways I did watch the video, interesting concept \n\njust curious how do you feel about islam? You were saying how you went to the islam workshop tents which is great\n\nbut then you said that sexism was no way in your overton window, meaning that you will never entertain the idea of sexism (also great)\n\nbut then sexism is actually deeply routed in the islamic culture, exhibit 1: Saudi arabia only just allowed women to drive, in 2017, thats bonkers right? I cant think of anything MORE sexist \n\nDid they mention any of this in the talks? Not trying to hate whatsoever, just interested on everyones opinion on this matter
This is such an interesting idea that I've really been thinking about a lot recently! Greenbelt always gives me fresh perspectives on the way I live my life and how to better myself. FYI I think I was stood next to you at Newton Faulkner's set but wasn't sure enough that it was you to say hey...so hey now I guess!
Hi guys!! Will be starting Accutane on Oct 12 (assuming all goes well with lab results on the 11th) and will be having the acne story video coming the following week! I'll be documenting each month on Accutane & filming update videos, etc. This video was pre-filmed, so I ended up being able to get about 2 months of Foundation Friday videos pre-filmed in time before starting Accutane- yay! xx
How i got here beats me lol. Im a guy and never had any acne. But she seems so professional that i stayed to watch just cause. Cheers, hope you all have a good day and the accuthing works for you!
This is kinda weird, I've never actually commented on a video before, but I just wanted to say that I stumbled upon your channel a month or so before I started accutane. Today's actually my 10th day!!! I keep hoping to wake up one morning and find that everything's miraculously disappeared, I've waited 6 years for clear skin but for some reason idk if I can do another couple months. Anyway as someone who has been struggling not really knowing how to deal with my combination skin, red cystic acne, and pale skin on top of that, I'm glad I found someone who has it all figured out. I also thought it was wiiiild that we were starting accutane around the same time. Best believe I'll be here for every update video, and best of luck to both of us sissss!!
I like this foundation but I always have to doctor it up so it's lighter and less drying. I have really dry flaky skin all over and when it's super bad my go to is the Cetaphil cream and the Cerave Renewing SA cream that come in jars.
Im on humira at the minute but ive had accutane. Skin wise it made me worse then better skin literally went so dry dehydrated and porus on my face and hands. It did become sensitive i agree with laying off the foundation for a while. Drink lots of water crushed strawberries facemasks really helped and using hydrating oils under clinuque lotion. Oh and plenty of sunlotion x
what kind of self tanner did you use in that pic?? or did you get a professional spray tan done?
Taylor your teeth are soooooo pretty and white!!! Do you use teeth whitener? And good luck with acutane girl! ❤️
This girl is honestly beautiful, I don’t know why she puts on makeup when she is really just covering a stunning face. 🙏🏻✨
Best of luck with Accutane! I really hope it works out well for you!
I've heard dairy can be a big cause of acne not sure much about it but you may look into it
I was on accurate for 6th months and it was all worth it !! looking forward to your journey! best of luck :) also CeraVe is great for moisturizer as well as the cleanser for dryness (dryness will be insane)
You look better without that lip ring
literally the only opinion I actually trust
This is my favorite drug store foundation ever. I just have to make sure I use a good primer.
I love the colors, its hard to find a light shade with yellow in it. But it's overall just okay to me, I have foundations that look better on the skin and have better coverage like the elf acne fighting foundation in porcelain, which is too neutral so I mix in some of the milani 001 vanilla shade.
Accutane worked wonders for me. I had horrible, painful cystic acne, went on it when I was 16 and haven't had a major breakout since (I'm now almost 33). The only time I had an acne breakout again (and this one was much less severe than when I was a teenager) was shortly after I gave birth to my son and my hormones were out of whack.\n\nI will say that it sucks while you're on it. Everything is dry. My lips were so cracked and bleeding, but it really does work amazingly well.\n\nGood luck Taylor! I hope it works as well for you as it did for me!
I have oily skin and I use sand beige works well for me I set it with the air spun powder and it doesn’t break down for me
I used acutane when I was 20, best medicine I ever used because it made my bad acne go away forever. Although I did have to get blood tests every month or week I forget. It was that powerful. I'm glad I used it though and hope all goes well with you
Wow you have the prettiest eyes! 👀
I hate this foundation. The same thing happened to me with it breaking down and looking very cakey. So many people raved about it but it was a big fail for me.
Oh HELL TO THE FUCK NAWW!!! GUYS PSA: FIRST DATE , TAKE THAT BITCH SWIMMING IN A HEAVILY CHLORINATED POOL!.\nMAKE UP IS SCARY AF!
Accutane was the best thing to happen to me! I felt like I looked like a completely different person once my face cleared up.
Huge question. Does applying makeup like your video increase skin irritation? I have a daughter that is starting to learn makeup and is having some minor skin issues. Thanks
I'm so happy for you that you are finally going to try Accutane. You do whatever you gotta do and if any body doesn't like it, they can fuck off because it's not their life or really their business.
I’m so excited for you! I really hoped Accutane works for you!
I did about 3 months of accutane when I was 19, about 4 years ago. The prescribing dermatologist recommended that I use cetaphil/cerave face wash, a good moisturizer, and CHAPSTICK. Tayla, my lips were constantly peeling. My acne was pretty well gone in three months and I only struggle with hormonal break outs monthly now (they are very minimal). I am so excited that you get to do this, I hope it works well for you and enjoy the results! I think I was still able to wear foundation during accutane, so I hope you can, too, if you want to! <3 <3
Selfish comment alert: My skin has recently gone from combo/oily to dry after finishing accutane 2 months ago and I'm excited to see some videos from you on product recommendations for dry skin! ;)
tried this a few weeks ago when i realized they had a shade that would match.. anyone else have a really terrible reaction to this? man!  im 99% sure that i had an allergic reaction to this (as i cant think of what else it would be) and got almost a rash of breakouts AFTER ONE USE. im guessing it was fragrance. but even if i didnt have a bad reaction, the complaints you had were the same for me; although not as much it did last longer through the day bc i set it w powder (which looked heavy)
I had bought these foundations in desperation to find great coverage for my skin color. Also cuz tati raved about it. I work as a nurse pouring sweat running around and by 8hrs my makeup on my cheeks was off and it looked like I used  cooking spray on my face. Loreals pro-matte infallible  is fantastic for my oily skin. That's the first ever cheap foundation that stayed put thru humidity,sweat and oil. My makeup was still on and my t zone wasn't bad😆
this foundation works really well with light baking with Coty Airspun powder in your T-Zone💙💙💙 love you!
i LOVE how involved you are with your audience! I really feel the effort you put into these videos. I love how you're constantly switching things up and asking what we think and taking our thoughts into consideration. You are and will always be the most attentive and caring youtuber ever! And my favorite 💕 Love ya! #SnapFam #Baeritto
Just want to say that Walmart has ooA :)
my skin was so incredibly oily before accutane that even though i was on a high dose my skin never even got dry, just normal. i never peeled or anything lol. now my skin is moderately oily and it was the best decision ive ever made. good luck on accutane i hope everything goes well for you! stay hydrated and take fish oil!
I wish you well on the accurate journey! You're gorgeous already, I have a good feeling it's gonna work out lovely for you :)
Good luck with accutane ! Very exciting ,, I did it 13 years ago when I was 20,, was the last and final resort I had cystic acne also..I did six months yea the nausea was hard but was worth it . My skin has never flared up since just hormonal flare up for thag time of the month. And I do agree ur skin does switch to dry my skin is very very dry . But I have no regrets ,, good luck on your progress . You will love ur results. Don't give up everyone is different . It helped me. The first week or so is hard you will flare up cuz it's bringing everything to the surface and yes you will be dry and your lips will crack but remember it's temporary ! It will pass stay strong and don't give up and finish your treatment fully 😊
OMG the amount of Mansplanning on this video in the comments is ridiculous.....Taylor I am so sorry that this still goes on. I love that people would assume that you have not looked at many options and figured out for yourself as an adult what is best for you. Crazy. I also love that people complain about makeup when they clicked on a makeup review. LOL crazy.
Accutane is seriously worth it. There will be scaring but it will go away with time. But it’s one of the best decisions a person with acne can make.
I hope the accutane works for you ! I know it must be so hard and frustrating ! make sure to take care of yourself drink water, rest, relax and watch what you eat. Good luck ! I know your skin will clear up by the new year for sure !
Pleeeeease do a review on No. 7 makeup. They also have an app to find your perfect color but wanna see how it wears.
Wishing you the very best. \nGod Bless You young Lady
Nothing like pounding 5g of makeup to your face
Watch and Love all your videos! 🌯💕
Hey Taylor! \nWas wondering if you could do a review of a new drugstore makeup brand that just hit my Walmart shelves called found cosmetics it's supposed to be an all natural eco friendly brand! Would love to see your thoughts on it! Love you!
Hi Taylor. This isn't makeup related and I know you don't like to make personal videos but I was wondering if you have any remedies or suggestions for my sister's migraines. She got a really bad one today and I feel so bad not being able to help her.
Glad to see a negative review on this foundation. I have combo skin. No breakouts or issues typical combo. I tried this so many times before I tossed. It looked like crap around my nose. Made my pores look huge no matter what primer and broke down in my t zone.
The edit on the display image tho...bad
i wish ypu well with your treatment. my daughter did the Accutane treatment. it worked but only temporarily and her skin was incredibly sensitive- even the skin on her hands. out of absolute desperation, she finally went oil free vegan, eating veg, fruit, seeds, nuts, and grains. bingo....took about 2 months, but she's nearly flawless now.
You have beautiful eyes
Bummer you didn't like this foundation... It's my favorite drug store full-coverage foundation for my combo/dry skin.  I always set it with translucent powder and a setting spray... but it wears all day for me until I take it off.
I like the idea to use primer on only half of your face. I've used a number of foundations that don't work well with certain primers or look better without any primer at all.
Thank you for all of the hard work and dedication you do for your fans. I love listening to your voice,it calms me down when I'm having an anxiety attack.
Please do a video on how you whiten your teeth. They are WHITE Im a coffee lover like you and I need to know!!!
Hey Thataylaa, I just wanted to say that I love your videos and I appreciate you helping us, acne prone skin sisters out with our foundation choices. I was wondering if you would be able to review the 100 pure 2nd skin foundation? I love the ingredients but I'm not quite sure how well it does with coverage and wear time. I have similar past acne marks like you. Thanks and wishing you an awesome week! 💕
I was on accutane for 6 months about a year an a half ago and I honestly think it permanently damaged my skin.. good luck and I hope you get good results! And moisturize moisturize moisturize!!!
Thank you for all of your hard work! We appreciate the dedication you put in and it's one of the (many) reasons we love you.
Revlon color stay powder usually makes any shitty foundation stick all or most of the day for my oily skin.
Taking Accutane was one of the best things I did. It's been over 5 years and my skin is still pretty clear!
I was talking about this to a friend of mine who was on accutane and she told me it made her super dry “down there”. I don’t know, I thought that was an interesting side effect I’d never heard of
Have you tried Curology?
Will you please do a review on The Balm’s Even Steven whipped foundation. The jar looks so tiny, but it’s supposed to be super full coverage.
I have normal skin with an oily tzone and I've tried this foundation a couple times. It felt disgusting within 2 hours.
Hi from NZ!! First off can I say that you are an absolute inspiration to all those who suffer with acne. You are incredibly beautiful and I hope all goes well with the accutane. I went on isotane (very similar) and I went off due to some emotional side effects but hey everyone is different😊 My advise is pretty much the same as most people: A good lip balm and moisturizer is everything:)  Good Luck.
This is why we have trust issues
Accutane cured me but it took 3 trials for me. Each time the acne was less and so were the sides (good luck with accutane during cold winter months). First my Chest acne was cured, second try my back was cleared and finally after my final try my face was cleared. It took me 2.5 years to fully get over acne at the ripe age of 23 lol. Even my scars have healed I'm 26 now. Tanning helps with the scars.
I actually spotted the shades 00A and 00B at my local Walmart. They seem to have more of a selection than any other Walmart I've been to lol
Can you add the Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation to one of your Foundation Fridays or 15 DoF?  Wayne Goss mentioned it, but I don't trust anybody else, lol!
Because I was a grease bomb, Accutane only made my skin normal out. However, it made my lips chapped af. It might make you a bit miserable, but stick with it! It is 1000000% worth it!
well milani is geared toward people of color so they probably actually didnt see a need to make light shades
Have you tried drinking a table spoon of apple cider vinegar twice a day? It really helped me out with my skin problem. Of course my skin didn't clear up the next day, but it took a week before I show a little sign of progress. And boy was it great.
Not sure if comments are a zero sum game, but came back to leave another comment just to say, TAYLOR YOURE DOING AMAZING SWEETY. #GoodVibesOnly 🖤
What I don't like about foundations is they don't have a fair peachy color. Phycians formula had a foundation powder a long time ago in that color but stopped making it. Nothing matches my skin.
Why do white chick's have such bad acne
And this is why guys say make up is false advertising.
makes you wounder if she would not cake on the make up for a week if here acne would lighten up
Reasons why I have trust issues always take your date to the pool
I'm a guy, I feel like having a layer over your face would feel soooo uncomfortable.
*BEFORE* 🤢🤢🤢🤢 \n\n\n*AFTER* 😳😳🤔🤢
Heal first!!
Disgusting
Omg. All these people who have never had cystic acne giving “advice” on how to get rid of it. \nI’ve had cystic acne since I was 13. Here’s the list of things I’ve tried to get rid of it. No soda, no dairy, no gluten, no sugar, no caffeine .  For a year. Every prescription drug except accutane. Salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, no makeup, working out 3x a week for a year, more sleep, more water. I did all organic food with no processed foods and no dairy for 3 weeks. (The ultimate reset) \nGuess what. I still have cystic acne. I am now 44 and am considering doing accutane, even though I’m terrified of the side effects. Nobody who hasn’t dealt with this for most of their life gets to have an opinion on what will get rid of it. \nGood for you, Taylor. I hope it works well for you.
This bitch is fake af
Cut the dairy and sugar out of your diet. Add some leafy greens, fuck acutane.
Yo, what's all over your face
Just stop putting on makeup until your face heals ffs. Nobody cares how it look ffs. I guess I get it for special occasions like black tie events or weddings.
Lmao and you think covering your zits with shit makeup is going to help NOT dumb video
Girl u need to detox and a doctor. Not no make up make up make it worst
Girl get a tan
I think that make up is messing with your acne .. but you're still Beautiful
Damn. From Freddy Kruger to ru Paul in   An instant. Good job.
Thank god you're finally doing something about it, all these damn foundations don't help.
Whoa! Makeup really changes a person!
This why you go to the water park on the first date
Have u ever tried face wash and proactive?
This makeup clears up your acne? If not you should moisturize and use sea salts.

I love it when you fugly bitches try to hide your acne with makeup , fucking pizza face hoe stop trying to hide your puberty complexion 😜😂
FAAAAKKKE
i got 500th dislike wooo
Makeup is great and all but I think it does more harm than good. Sure it may cover up what you believe to be major imperfections but it damages the skin even more. \n\nHonestly I’d suggest to women that use makeup to first drink at least a gallon of water a day, wear sunscreen in the morning, try not to eat foods that are really oily, and moisturize after your bath/shower. It’s troubling to see what some women have to go through everyday to feel confident in themselves. \n\nIt may sound cliche but guys appreciate it when women don’t wear makeup. Unless of course you’re doing it for yourself, that’s cool too...
This is why I have trust issues
Eric church, a true talent! No amount of bullets. God bless you!
This is unbelievable. Thank you Eric Church. I teared up. You did this for you fans. Your crowd. I am part of your crowd. I am part of your fans. I wasn't  there that night. Thank you Eric. It's awesome.
Quit the sniffling bullshit. Just play.
amazing
I have been a fan for some time now, but he got me there. When there are so-called entertainers like Eminem spewing hate, I need real people like Eric Church to restore my faith in humanity and remind me that the others don't matter.
Mr. Chruch You put a Tear in this Americans Eye, They weren't just You're ppl they Were OURS as well and it's time We ALL start seeing that not just as American's but as Mankind.

The moment that you fall in love with the heart and compassion  of Eric Church.
So I’m blurry eyed from crying. Even though I wasn’t there. I’m a big country fan ! Had plans on being at this concert. I have days now that I just cry. I can’t believe that this could ever happen. Than reality hits. I can’t understand why this man decided to cause so much pain. Are we so broken that we can just kill each other off. God won’t have to do a thing . We have enough people playing god.
Please help me what was that I found in my last video I'm scared
Song starts at 4:45. This is not to disrespect the message that he is saying. If this is the first time watching this video you should watch the video through and through. But if you have already heard his message and want to listen to the song because it is amazing. Then use the time stamp above. Again I do not mean to disrespect anyone by saying this. I’m just trying to make it easier on people who want to listen to the song again.

Good message, love eric church.  Not that impressed with the song. Lots of emotion though, can tell he was really singing from the heart.
Crying my eyes out !!!! This is what the American Spirit is all about, the empathy, the compassion and love for our fellow man. No color, no religion and nothing but respect for our country, its people and OUR FLAG !!!! Other artists can learn a great deal from Mr Church !!
Bless his heart.... he's struggling!
Eric Church I do not know if you read comments but I wanted to come see your last show and couldn't afford to...........Sunday night was more than something that sank hearts, filled eyes with tears & tattered souls like worn paper. I just watched this clip of you here on youtube and listened to your new song. My thoughts of you Sir and my love for your voice and your music extend much further now because I just saw your person.......your thoughts just as a person. Your words for the people echo through the walls of The Grand Ole Opry now for all of time.
He is so good God bless all that was lost.
Kevin Love?!?
Who 😢
how could 1 person much less 2,000 dislike this video..
Nothing can separate us from God's Love. Because If God is for us, who can be against us? No one! Bless your Mr. Church, the gate of hell shall not prevail on you, on us, on America, on the world, and on the beautiful souls that went to glory. \n\nGod heal and bless America.
Beautiful job! I think we all have to ask ourselves that same question ...
Beautiful song with powerful words for us all and especially for the families who are having to say goodbye. Eric Church you did a wonderful thing when you wrote this. I am glad you know God.
Yo crowd stfu hes trying to talk so annoying
He reminds me of a young Willy Nelson.
Thank you Eric Church. Sonny was from my hometown. This song helps me so much to deal with the pain of losing a member of my family. God Bless you.
Wow, I was just thinking, why not him.
It was an amazing performance, Thank you for sharing your soul with us Eric Church
God bless you all every one ☝️ I love going to church both really church and Eric church
Eric Church is the epitome of what a musician, a human being should be.  Heartfelt, he knows were he came from and respects it, and the fans who have found him.  Simply my favorite musician, and a human I strive to be.
I started listening to the Chief back during the Sinners like me Album, I kept trying to show him to everyone I could. The way he conveys his message is incredible and this song just shows it. I could have been there at that concert and am thankful I wasn't. He is truly the Chief! Eric Church is the real deal. He isn't like the other modern country artist, this man is real.
Excellent, beautiful, heart wrenching and pure art.
So now that every part of the American background has been affected can we talk about gun control? Insane how these guys have to sing about this...
4:12 tears started flowing. How can you not love this guy?
There is no better artist
You have a huge heart Eric.. God Bless you!!!
Heart of gold love his words in a song...he is truth and country music💕💕💕
Somerset Ky  shout out from the bluegrass..... we love you Eric  Church
Eric, I sense that you grasp the connection between all of us, so let me suggest this as the answer to your song.  Why not me?   I'd say, a part of you did die. As a part of all of us died.  We are truly all connected.
Brave performance and beautiful song. A fitting tribute.
Song I wrote for the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas. 🙏🏼https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1926598244024504&id=100000230425794
This is why Eric is my favorite and always will be. Thank you for sharing your heart Eric. Continued prayers to all affected. #churchchoir.  #prayers.
Thank you.  We needed to see this.  My cousin was there.  I'm sorry you had to go through what you did.  Glad you made it to the Opry that night.
I love this man!
Don't know about y'all but at 4:15 I broke down
He's amazing....if he read the bible hed know why the wicked pray on the good....God will put an end to it soon Death will be no more
he's famous now... #illuminati
I'm a huge country music fan! I've always loved Eric Church and love him even more after this! Made me cry....so heartwrenching! Beautiful song! My prayers and thoughts go out to Eric Church, all of the artists, fans, and their families that were affected by the Las Vegas tragedy!
No big deal here.
This is Eric Church.
Thank you Chief for helping us heal with your music.  You are incredible. From another one of your people & Church Choir member.
A new era is sure to come, it is definite and it is written.....And the kingdoms of this world, have become the kingdom of our Lord..
Eric Church you are a amazing man.  There is no artist like you.  You are a gifted man. Both artistically and personally.  Keep being you!!!
you are so amazing... I love you so much Eric. This broke my heart....
Tell the loudmouth in the crowd to shut up. Annoying
Great song rip the Vegas victims
I am so glad we have people like Eric.  He always says almost exactly what i'm feeling in times like these.  And he is so right. You can't kill music.  It's there and will survive as long as someone sings it.
country music sucks ! and great acting by singers!
I thought him Liam from 1D
I'm crying...thank you Eric for your heartfelt words and beautiful rendition...it helps in the healing... xx & prayers.
how could 2k ppl not love this man? I feel sorry for them, I truly do....
Such a beautiful, heartfelt performance and message ❤ I will forever be a fan of EC, he is a true artist who is truly in love with music. The best music in the world is the kind that speaks to your soul, brings tears to your eyes, and moves you deep inside ❤❤❤
What a beautiful tribute to those who lost their lives. As someone who was there, this is how we all feel!  Love you Eric!
Very sad..\nYour a true hero\nLove your songs\nLots of respect..\nLove you
I live in Vegas. God be with you.
It seems like we all knew someone who was there that night. I had a few family members there and some friends. Although they made it home safely they were not left unscathed. It hurts me knowing what they all must be going through. They too are hurting and will forever be changed. I saw this video and can't help but hope we can lift them up if only through our prayers and love. You're not alone and we may be strangers but we're all in this together.
I hate country music..but this okay I suppose..even though if he missed a few chords.
Tosh.0?
Love this song. Great performance and tribute to a legend
veeeeery nice :-)
Superb . .

i think tom petty would have love it          great job
Goodness.. That's great!!
So amazing !
I am a super huge Fed Up Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and all the other bands that Tom Petty was in and most of the Heartbreakers are in as well. I am 55 years old and I have loved Tom Petty and everything he's ever done my entire adult life and just under half my childhood from the very beginning of his career. I am devastated that he was taken from us so soon but I know he's got a great place in heaven. Having said that I'm very particular about who sings his music. most of the time I will not listen to somebody else sing a song that he wrote. But you guys are amazing so I decided to listen and it brought tears to my eyes thank you for doing a great job on a legend in his own time and his time in the hereafter.💞💜
Great vid as usual! RIP Tom Petty.  : (
Legendary!
Nicely done!
You guys are amazing!
Beautiful
Incredible Tribute guys! Thank You!

I wish more bands gave us a jam session. So goooood.
Tom would be so happy and proud of this. 👌🤘

I would love to sit in on one of their jam sessions.
A other awesome cover thank you 👊🏻
Stupendo 😍😍😍bacio hai cuccioli di casa da l'Italia
Yes! Love this! Got a Hooters vibe too! Killer! Digging it!
I love this cover . Walk off the earth you guys are amazing .
Unrelated. But I would LOVE to hear you do your version of Sia _ Chandelier! Don't how to reach you guys, so figured I'd try in the comment section of your latest video. Love all your stuff. Keep it up! Not assuming you take requests. Sorry if I'm coming off rude. Just figured it was worth mentioning. Greetings from Norway
Respect to Marshall for the Elora Brewing Co. Hat. I've got home roots around that town. Great tribute!
Thanks to you all, WOTE! I needed this today. I needed it days ago, but times are busy. Tom Petty is missed.
It is my request that can you make your next song 'Despacito'
More madness and mayhem. Just as it should be - but with respect! Thanks!! x
heey guys!! could you do a cover of Castle On The Hill (ed sheeran)? :)  \nbtw this is definetly one of my favorite covers! you guys did it amazing, I showed do everyone here in the family (my dad especially loved!) xx from Brazil!
Tom would be proud. Well done everyone! RIP Legendary Tom Petty <3
Holy shit the amazement is beyond comprehension....
Someone should have hit that flaming marshmallow at the camera with the back of a uke.
They are one of my favorite groups!
too good at goodbye please !!!
*tears. My favorite Tom Petty song is Alright For Now. He's alright forever now.
Oh I love the older bluegrass feel... Tom Petty will be so missed  #WootWOTE
I've loved Tom Petty ever since my dad played his music at hime when I was a boy. That's been 25 years ago. I was very sad when I read he passed away, I will miss him. He was unique.
You guys should do let me go by hailee steinfeld ft. Florida Georgia Line
Someone can recommend me songs like this i like how it sound but is the first time i heard something like this
Great tribute guys!   You rock in every since of the word
You guys are amazing!! Love this so much! Great tribute to Tom Petty <3
I was so satisfied when the camera turned to the bearded guy in the hammock.
Hmmmm...never heard of you cats before.\nDigging your sound as we morn the loss of a truly great artist.\nWell met. \npeace
R.I.P. Mr.Petty,great song performed by some great artists right there.love it ❤❤👍👍(on another note how in the hell this video got 72 dislike?)
Are they hiring people? I could be those two on the right easily. Clap some random shit and get to be with WOTE in a video...!
Awesome Tribute.  1st concert I ever saw was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, at Hec Edmundsen pavilion at UW. Saw him 3 times and loved every show. Would you consider covering Spike, off of Southern Accents, or pack up the plantation live version?  Love Your Music!
They should do a cover of Shut Up and Dance. Who agrees?
Wow... I'm not into this music genre but I love the vibe you guys give off. The sound is smooth. Nice in general. 👍
Another amazing cover and big props to Tom's legacy!
Top downloaded WOTE on Google play (just downloaded it myself) Very cool all the proceeds going to the Heart and Stroke Foundation :D
I would pay good money to sit by the fire with these guys and just listen
When I saw this was a  Tommy Petty cover, I was upset. But after watching and listening I was smiling, singing and clapping😁 Amazing job and don't think Tom would have disagreed...how fun!
You guys are always so amazing.
this kind of looks like a bunch of camp counselors have abandoned all the children
Love this. Thanks Walk of the Earth It's a pleasure to see what you do with music and video and your generosity.
We love you guys!!!!! Amazing cover. Thanks.
Marshal looks like he would be very much at home on a tractor
Ohh damn. How much I've missed you guys.
amazing vibes and color tones, makes me wanna just sit with them and listen
hi. im one of your fans from indonesia. can i request for the next song Walk off the earth use Angklung or Kolintang. :)
Please don't ever stop doing this! You guys are too good :)
that was pretty amazing\nwell done!
Thankyou very much guy's. That was such a  beautiful rendition of the late Tom Petty's  song. Another Legend we all loved. RIP Tom Petty ❤ \nYou rock!
I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't tear up from trying to hold back emotions about this loss. You guys did a great job, I think it's truly good enough for tom
What a great cover! Thank you, thank you, thank you, and thank you some more.
so well done!! Tom is smiling down! RIP Tom Petty
Lovely tribute to one of the best!  RIP Mr. Petty.
Big ups from Brazil! (y)
thank you for making this.
What a great tribute. Love it.
I thought this was going to suck.  I was wrong.  RIP Tommy boy
Why the heck are y'alls videos not ever popping up for me.  Thought y'all walked off the earth literally.  So glad to hear ya again though.
lost all respect for tom petty when he sued sam smith for royalties because tom was broke. stay with me doesn't have the same melodies or respective choruses as i won't back down. sad
She should have had that after thr home secretary job
What is wrong with these people and how did they get like that?
I hope Brexit will fix multiculturalism in shitholes like Tottenham. It's obviously irreversible, removing British born Africans and Middle Easterners, but here's me hoping it will be a bit better.
no video here just an advert
Get may out ruining the country
Getting people into work faster and staying in work longer.😂more like destroying life's.
Love the hair it's so Trumpy!
She said something and noone laughed so she said it again
She is a fearful hypocrite, no matter she pretends to say. Gray hair and cracked voice of some old witch from forest suits her perfect.
Amazing the guy got that close to the PM, he'd have been shot in the US.
Lucky she was in the U.K. in America it would have been a gun.
Who is this bird again?
Well past her sell by date...
I think half of them shouting OUT directed that towards Theresa May.
Id go gay for that guy! No homo.
Does it get any worse ....
She wants to give him a p45 because she can't handle the competition?
What a farce, that was a Tory setup. Your telling me the dam security never knew he was coming on? Seriously even the camera crews knew where he was sitting they zoomed in on him at the start of her speech, just waiting for his staged stunt.
We need her out
I take it everyone knows the prankster was the comedian lee Nelson?
Look at those fat slobs thumping themselves on the back... P45 is the first form they should have received
Even a software update can't save Teresa.
He is not a prankster it's called the comedian
I just want to see how many people hate her and want her out. If it’s labour or green or even Lib Dem hit like to get her out. She isn’t for the people, she isn’t for the poor or middle class, she doesn’t care about anyone other than companies giving her money. HIT LIKE IF YOU WANT HER OUT WE NEED HER OUT!!
Just to clear who he was. He was lee nelson. Not his real name but now u kno who i mean
She doesn't have any respect to people
Why does this crone always blabber on about corbyn, are there any solid beneficial ideas to be implemented for the people or is it just this childish pissing match. It's always some inept moron at the head of a witless cabinet plunging us into one disaster after another, no real progress is made from politics.
Lee nelson always up to something he’s the one who threw money over Seb platter funny guy
You can hear Brexit in the background
What an old Hag can’t  wait till she leaves
This, and other trivial things, seems to be so much more important than what the PM had to say.  NOT!
Honestly cheers to that guy
We've spent too much time talking about Jeremy Corbyn ['s past] *proceeds to talk about Jeremy Corbyn further.
It’s lee nelson man you blind
Does anyone know who the prankster is, I do I just forgot his name :/
that was such a dead prank
The guards probably let him get close in hopes that he would hopefully assassinate her lmao😂
Lol what a bunch of scrubs if that was white house that nerd woulda lost his teeth 10 feet in lol
OH MY GOD ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT IS JEREMY CORBIN. WHAT KIND OF POLITICS IS THIS??? SO RUBBISH
If she said something like you’re a btech sacha baron cohen his career could have been ended but she wasn’t on the ball.
Well done Simon Brodkin aka Lee Nelson the brilliant comedian does it again superb 👏👏👏👏😂😂😂😂
We all know Amber Rudd is smirking in the audience
I hate this woman
Somebody give a knighthood to that man!!!!!!!!!
Is it Lee Nelson?
Joke politicians for an even bigger joke of a nation. Merkal herself probably could run that place better than your so called Parliament.
Was that Lee Nelson again?
No copyright music for your channel, enjoy))
And  you my dear have just been served
I feel sorry for may whoever we have as prime minister is still going to be ruled by America
All she needs now is the stab in the back and the show is over.
How about you shut up about Corbyn and get on with your job and talk about your policies and plans. Or is she just going to keep complaining like a child
Saying Jeremy Corbyn should be given a P45 and when you struck a deal with a racist party to stay in power 😐
Who's ready for the UK Riots next year?
Am I the only one who recognises this dude as Lee Nelson?!
Love that theresa may would love her to touch my clit
Please take your P45 and leave Mrs May. You madam are a disaster waiting to happen and Corbin isn't any better.
She's like a broken record. Plus you have all those seals clapping at anything that comes out her mouth.
*build a country that works for rich people
I thought she tried to give Jeremy Corbyn a P45 and that's the reason her party wants to give a P45 to her.
Is it me or he looks WAY TO MUCH LIKE MATTSHEA O
Lee nelson lol what a guy
whats a P45?
Old hag!
Thought we’d got rid of all the witches after maggie thatcher, but I guess not🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
yerno it would be a different story if it was a terrorist or criminal
Somone give that man a promotion and a raise!
where's the secret service when you need them. Double tap to the head is all it takes
JEJEJEREMY COBYN!! Go llabour
yes marconni
Bye Bye Tories.
Lee Nelson ain't funny anymore.
Simon back again
I LOVE THAT PRANKSTER HAHAHAHAH
Blah blah blah
bankers puppet with the lowest wit
AHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHHAHHA
LEE NELSON WAYYYYY
Simon brodkin
Qwaliteeeeeeeee
Foreign Poricy...

Ayyyyy Simon Brodkin ;)
OMG that's Lee Nelson.
Simon brodkin
She has nightmares about corbyn
DO IT! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!
Okay im 14, no idea whats going on. Can someone care to explain?
Admit it, all of you thought in the title it said Ps5.....
This incredibly pretentious, this is why trump won #2020
Ah, most of America. How painfully mediocre you are 💕
too good for your home? who tries to make fun of a hometown? fail.
Speak for yourself. My hometown of about 4,000 has a lot to do. They even have an annual get together of the local craft breweries this weekend. 8 hours of beers from 17 different breweries. And an awesome theatre that will be showing Rocky Horror and a tour of all the haunted sites around town.\n\nIt's so packed with goodies that the nearest town has moved their Night of the Living Dead weekend to next weekend instead of Friday the 13th.
When your hometown is literally the capital city of your state
My hometown doesn't have a zoo or a mall.
People commenting about their small towns in Southern Ontario. Puts a smile on my face 'cause they don't even know what a real isolated small town feels like. Try a population of 8000 with no city centers within 4 hours of driving.
Google Yardley, Pennsylvania. That's where I'm from
I guess it's a good thing I'm from a fairly big city then
Over half the things that are mentioned aren't even in my hometown xD
my small town dosent have a cheese cake factory that's for the big city's lol
i just love the fact they think this illuminati stuff is still funny or staring controversy , THAT makes me laugh :), this vid is nice overall, but THAT cracks me up.
at least my home town just added a pot shop
Psh, my hometown has none of this
This is exactly Salt Lake City
interesting video...grass is always greener on the other side mooo! lol
We actually have that one nice mall with a Cheesecake Factory 😂
lol we dont even have a mall and its technically a city :D
When the place he's describing actually has more things then your own hometown lol\n\nSigh
what about doing hard drugs with high school friends that used to be staunchly against even weed
lol i love how the background music dip and fluctuates like a shitty ad
this is literally just a copy of an snl joke commercial
I wish I had money to go
I'm glad my hometown isn't that big.
My town isn't even that big
When this is what the biggest city in your country is like...
My crappy hometown doesn't have a zoo, a mall, or an airport (what town has a fucking airport???). If you want entertainment go buy some laced pot from the homeless guy outside the library.
It's somehow less walkable here than either a small town OR big city XD so true, I don't even need a car in the city, home town is so spread out the slightest errand is somehow a 10 mile round trip
when your home town is actually crappier than that one...
My Hometown:\nNo Zoo\nNo Mall\nNo Airport\nNo Sophisticated Bars\nNo Dance Clubs\nNo Bowling\n1/2 of the churches are empty buildings (don't want to go anyway)\nA couple smokehouses\nA Walmart\nA couple FF restaurants\nA Dead Main Street\nSomehow we're still in the top 25 biggest in my state
Man... kind of puts things in perspective being that my hometown has like a million people and in the top 15 of the country. Annnnnd no, I don't live there.
My local mall doesnt have a cheesecake factory, all 3 of them. \n:(
not gonna lie, that thumbnail looks like Stevie T
I'm still trapped in this shithole. The town you described looks like a metropolis compared to this... pile of nothing.
Lol mall, zoo I wish my town was that big
Damn! Moving out at 18 really got me there for some strange reason, I'm 20 and I still live with my parents.
Move To The google search And Type: *FreeCodesXXX* It happens to be the only working FIFA 14 coins working these days. Never waste your entire free time in some other applications
I now feel slightly better over my hometown which is one of the major cities in the US. I've never thought of how little things to do other places had.
People in the comments talking about how their hometown doesn't have a zoo...my whole COUNTRY does not have a zoo. Yeah we have that place in the capital and some similar one in the countryside where you can go and see sheep, cows, geese, pigs and such but that is it....
Wait? Does every mall really have a cheese cake factory? Because mine does!
I'm from Celebration, Florida and I haven't been there in years. It didn't feel like a real town, as if I were on the Truman Show.
The only mall we have if a Giant Tiger. :(
My hometown didn't even have 90% of the stuff he mention, no mall no night life not cocktail places, no bowling, no air port have to drive about 3 hours or 6 hours for that.  They have Canada though.
y is he describing mine perfectly
yah mine doesn't have a bar or a mall
The nearest zoo was in Seattle (I’m from Idaho😂😂) and then there was a tiny airport with literally one room that we shared with the neighboring(and rival) collar town
this has the distinct vibe of this is my milwaukee, except not as creepy.
They are doing a lot of weird commercials lately. XD
Woah I can't relate to any of these, born and brought up in London...
That feel when your hometown isn't crappy and is already a destination people from all over the globe travel to visit..
My crappy hometown doesn't even have half of the stuff they said. 😂
My home town(s): Akron, Ohio, USA! Or North Canton, OH, USA!\n\nCome to Akron, they have the ZOO! And they... they have... You can get MUGGED! Yay, crime!\n\nCome to North Canton! No zoo, but a very nice mall! With a HOT TOPIC! North Canton has an AIRPORT! One city away, that is. Plus, low crime! Yay!\n\nPick one. Get mugged at the zoo or go have fun at the mall.
Yeah I went to visit your crappy momma too
um i was born in the capital of sweden why am i here\n\n\nHelp me find the way to the Visit the tourist destination of sweden now! video\npls
How did he some how accurately describe my hometown, even though I like it better then where I am now.
Had to drive 30 minutes to the real mall. The mall in town only had 3 places to go. We did have a Wal-mart though.
Go to google and type: *gamesecrx guide* You'll get the only 100% working secret fully FREE for the game.
CH: You're a loser if you don't live in a big city!
What if your hometown is Las Vegas
My hometown didn’t even have a traffic light....
Ahh small town America, it's the Pallet Town for venturing white millennials.
Very funny! Could have said more about the lameness of the small town bar scene; under-age and/or under-educated people standing around watching MMA. Bunch of kids still living with mom + dad closing down the bars each night, or getting thrown out of them for fighting.
This was funnier when it was snl... and that's saying something.
and yet still my shitty home town i joined the damn army to get away from still doesn't suck as much as LA :)
Jokes on you. Theres a Topgolf in my home town!
My hometown is a massive tourist destination, so visiting is only crappy when I just want to go to the beach and 50 million American's are there escaping their crappy home towns.
I don't even have a hometown
Just did, we don't have a Mall or bowling
My home town has woods.  I love it.
Was grant from Utah?
I'd go there.....I have none of these things in my hometown
What's with the Illuminati sign appearing in every video. Is it a joke?
I think I've seen this before..... just not sure where though...
Whose crappy hometown actually has a mall, a zoo, a bowling alley, an airport with 3 gates, a sports bar, and all that other stuff he mentioned? Mine ain't got none of that.
“Bowling: That’ll kill some time” never a more accurate description of bowling.
the nice mall, ya know the one with the cheesecake factory relatable AF
Loved the bit about public transit. Prob no nice stop shelter like that though lol.
You should see my hometown, there’s a killer shapeshifting clown in the sewers
The accuracy of this was eerie..
So true about the mall / airport / accommodations.
Visit bars
heheheheheh i got u #3 wit ilumtittiiyy thing clvr
Visiting Your Crappy Hometown
Macon, GA....
same. A flipping airport, yea right.
bfdkjhsfdshf omg stop this is depressing
Looks like Keith from Buzzfeed
YEEEEES
Illuminati!
College Humour videos fucking sucks!
Visit Fairbanks,Alaska... Goldenly Crappy.
This reeks of bugman.
Unsubscribe. bye.
Illuminati confirmed
Illuminati confirmed
Wanna go bowling?
ILLUMINATI
Did anybody else see that Illuminati symbol?
I could eat a really unhealthy burger right now.
It's even more depressing when you realize the exaggerated-for-humor description of a crappy home town is still cooler than yours.
If you have Netflix & haven't seen Kick Kroll and John Mulaney's show Oh Hello, you are missing out. It's their stage production on Broadway and it's hysterical. :)
Johns facial expressions are the best!
How do you get someone to ask you out?\n\nJohn: I don't know that one.\n\nLMAO
John mulaney's too good for buzzfeed
That girls expression when Nick talked about putting butter on his face was priceless.
Nick would be such a great dad
4:45 the HORROR on her face!!!
I use a diva cup. Killed me!😂😂🤣🤣😆
Everytime one of the kids asks a question john has this look of shit I have the same question
i love nick sooo much one of my fave comedians of all time
They're like two goofy but sweet big brothers. :)
I can only see you guys as animated! Big Mouth is phenomenal!!!
I think some of the humor was totally lost on these kids lol. but these guys are hilarious together
I am OBSESSED with John Mulaney. He's the goddamn best
john is there to learn about puberty too
how do you find the g spot, John?
hey look! It's john mulaney and a hermit
Team diva cup !
obnoxious music
I can't watch this without thinking that Nick from Big Mouth is talking lmao
y'all she has my name
This is fucking disgusting and your show promotes pedophiles
3:40 I stan this child. It’s like looking in a mirror of my 6th grade self.
I found that pretty awkward and not funny at all. I guess I'm not in their target audience.
They went from playing 70 year olds to playing tweens. And make me crack up as both.
Was Nick kidding when he said he doesn't believe in evolution??????
3rd bass - mc search - house of pain everlast
Christopher literally looks exactly like John Mulaney.
Christopher is so cute!
i will miss the brain cells i lost watching this
If the boy did asked the question What third base is these guys would have answered it better or comfortably than when the girl asked it.
nick kroll definitely made nick to look like him
Nick Kroll should be legally obligated to stay away from children
I’m 13 and damn I wish I could be in this video
This was a ridiculous waste of time. Not funny....(John Mulaney is a funny dude, BUT not here.)
This is going to be me with my kids
I need 2 black people please?!?
Neosporin is great for after you have popped a zit. Really speeds up the healing process.
name a better duo! i'll wait
Nick looks sorta like my youth pastor who's also named Nick. Creepy.
What is the point of this video
i can’t listen to john’s voice without imagining andrew talking lmao
*Throws penalty flag at Nick Kroll*  Everlast was in House of Pain not 3rd Bass.  3rd Bass was MC Serch and Pete Nice.
Two strange men talking about puberty with kids...
If you have not watched Big Mouth on Netflix, you must!!! It is hilarious and one of the best things ever.
what highlighter is Nick Kroll wearing because it's really pretty!
ANDREW AND NICK \nBIG MOUTH\n\nIS \n\nAWESOME
hi i'm nick crompton and no i'm n-
Emma:\n\n\n\nI call the darkness into me \nFrom deepest depths of Earth and Sea \nFrom ancient evils unawoken \nbreak the who one can't be broken \nthe blackest night I plaged my soul \nand you crush my heart to Burning coal the sommon forth deathly power to see my hated foe devorued 😂
What am I watching.  The Douche is describing puberty to me.
It's a 90s hip hop group lolol Great answer
I'm guessing they only did this to promote Big Mouth and BuzzFeed didn't put it anywhere in the video or the description.
Simply Move to google and type: WUMO SEO. They are the cheapest Search engine optimization company and ranked my site within just Eight weeks. They will either rank your blog or give your cashback. I simply love WUMO SEO.
I'm bout to put you in the neighborhood
What was the advice?
watched until he said evolution wasnt real, i didnt realize he was an idiot.
John was so close to cussing at 2:20 😂
Not sure how Nick got House of Pain and 3rd Bass mixed up. Or did I miss some sort of joke?
I guess you can ball park someone’s income bracket by asking them about their butter preferences. “French butter” Lmao. What? Kroll is my hero.
i love these people but i HATE buzzfeed
Your video was very well made & inspiring to watch! My favorite way to make money online, legitimately is by earning residual income with Bitcoin... by Auto Trading Loans, I make up to 40% R.O.I. monthly.. Check out this tutorial to learn how:\nhttps://goo.gl/242BgP
Big Mouth is the fucking best
There is no such thing as puberty or sex  we are sexless consciousness
Does Nick Kroll not actually believe in evolution?
But they won't put iddubz in the trending tab
I love this so damn much
Nick Kroll looks exactly like nick from big mouth
There coming if age all over the place.......
I finished Big Mouth in a day in a half 😂😂😂
toothpaste works bruh
Nick Croll is a pedophile y’all
OOF
That was awkward
I love John
4:46 SHE WAS SO SHOOK NFNSDNNSS
Buzzfeed now promoting pedophilia? What's next?
http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=159749
WTF
((()))
Nick Kroll is hilarious
Big mouth is fucking hilarious
San Diego Diet
JOHN MULANEY
OMG OMG MY HEALTH TEACHERS NAME IS JOHN MULLANEY WTF
What was that 😂
we're here at *busts out laughing* BUZZFEEd
Ew
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVENT HIT PUBERTY YET.
Visit www.indis.me and expose your local luciferians!
Disgusting, ,,, have fun in hell
Useless.
I wanna clap Brooke’s cheeks
Uhh 🙄 really now?!?
BuzzFeed is disgusting.
Alberto Roy lol mejor su ta\n\n\n\n\n\nFax
Go To Google And then Type: *gamesecrxguide facebook* This has been the only working FB h@ck tool working these days. Never waste the available free time on some other applications
Nick kroll doesn't believe in evolution!? I'm sorry Nick, but despite what your opinion is, evolution is a fact.
What is wrong with society? Having young children questioned by two grown male comedians about intimate topics that should be discussed with their parents? Shame on the parents for allowing this. Disgusting, this is not normal. Wake up
That netflix show isnt funny... but Its okay (animation is terrible) but story is, okay...
Big mouth is my new favorite show , slowly healing the void in my heart from the absence of Brickleberry
You got a way of making me feel insane\nLike I can't trust my own brain\nUnless it's screaming your name\nI'd have it no other way\nI'd have it no other way\nAnd maybe that's why I stay\nHow many times can we pick up the same fight?\nCan we keep screaming all night?\nAnd make up until it's light?\nThat's when I say that you're right\nAnd feel your body on mine\nOh, maybe that's why I stay\n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\nI could be with someone, making me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down\nJust pick up my keys\nI could let you go and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nKeep coming back\nGuess you can say I'm attached\nLast time we called it a wrap\nI came begging and all that\nYou're like a habit, it's bad\nI gotta have it, it's bad\nOh no, I'm not even mad, no\n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\nI could be with someone, making me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down\nJust pick up my keys\nI could let you go and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nIt's the way you keep me up all night\nIt's the way you make me lose my mind\nEvery time I'm saying one more night\nIt's the way you know I'm yours\nIt's the way you know I'm yours for life\n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\nI could be with someone, making me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down\nJust pick up my keys\nI could let you go and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love
This song is chill 👍

God, I can't wait for this. If you guys at Syfy are finally making good shows, I think it's fine for them to not always be the genre your name dictates.
Ever wonder what happened to Elliot Stabler of Law & Order: SVU? Well we found out.
There must be something seriously wrong with me... Because I am going to enjoy the crap out of this show!
You had me at Christopher Meloni dabbing while his head was a blood fountain... AND ITS OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!
I GOTTA see this.
When Stabler misses Olivia...
I see Detective Stabler and I am down.
Detective Stabler???? Ha - this looks like a trip. Kind of it to it tho, plus I like how the scenes are shot & edited.
Elliot. Plz come back.
I'm all in.
What were the people who made this tripping on?
The special victims unit really chews you up then spits you out.
This. Looks. AMAZING!!!!!!!
Welcome back Meloni!
So no crank 3 :(
I loved him in OZ.
This looks like what happened after SVU's Detective Stabler put in his retirement papers and just went on a never-ending downward spiral.
Looks like a discount Deadpool, no costume.
LONG LIVE GRANT MORRISON!!!
you lost me at dabbing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...but you got me at graphic novel and the plot!
this looks like a youtube s**tpost turned  into a tv series...
Reminds me of I man.
This looks so good!
sooooo a cop with a cartoon character, hmmm....reminds me of another movie with the same concept...
This will be a hard R right? Not that it will full of violence but no uses of the F-word and stuff? Don't know what the policy of SYFY is.
For some reason I want to hear Carpenter Brut - Roller Mobster on one of the episodes. Can you imagine?
Anyone know the song in the beginning when he’s dancing?
WHAT IS THIS I DON'T EVEN
Anyone know the song they used? It kind of reminded me of Prodigy. Would like to hear more.
i know ya seen that dab at 00:13
I'd watch anything with Chris Meloni in it.
Meloni is doing the batman voice
I love how the blood just came rushing out when he dabbed
At the end of this show series, he is finally arrested and sent to jail under the name Chris Keller.
where do i get that disco jingle bells track?
What is the song in this trailer?
I REALLY hope this is as good as it looks .... and not another Son of Zorn
Why he left SVU?  He was my favorite character.
The Animation on him Blew me away! This is a Television Show, Could a TED TV Show be possible now?!
So excited for this.  Syfy just keeps on getting better and better as a network. I hope this continues that trend.
Eu tenho o encadernado da Devir. Apesar de ser bem violenta a história é o maior barato. Muito ansioso por esta série. Acho que não vai dar errado.
Dab -_-
*EXTREME EARRAPE WHEN DABS*
another comicbook series yay
gota see this !!!!
This looks amazing
DROP DEAD FRED!
Drugs. Lots of drugs.
Come back to SVU
Amazing!!!
This looks amazing!!
Поезд сделал БУМ!
This. Looks. Amazing!
Beginning scene remind me of Rorschart
I was kinda in, then the cartoon thing showed up and I was way out.
This looks amazing.
Pause at :49. I swear one of these paramedics is Jon snow
😍 #FuckYeah
Wow. This looks really good.
Manoooo que fodaa ansioso pra ver já!
entertain you with violence.. And then cry their agenda all over the place.....
awesome trailer,  I can't wait for this
I like Patton Oswalt and all but it should have been Bobby Moynihan...
Ohhh i definitely will be watching this!
oh heck ya! I'm excited for this
I've never really been into Syfy shows but this looks amazing! I am so watching this!!!
this looks amazing
I think you got one, Syfy\n 😂😂😂
Added to my list of stuff to watch.   This is going to be a riot.. one way or the other.
Shows have gotten fucking weird.
meh, blood drive was better.
This actually looks good.
well atleast its new
Is that the Las Vegas shooter?
And you cancelled Dark Matter for this? Why should I watch anything you make when that show had just as high (if not higher) ratings than your other shows. I will not invest my time in your shows. You only cancel them -- even if they are going strong.
In the final episode he goes to mandalay bay and shoots everybody
JANIELLLLLLLLL❤️😍😍🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈

If you decide to breastfeed, the first couple weeks of breastfeeding are the hardest and there’s such a steep learning curve, but if you are able to push through it, it’s definitely worth it. I will say that if you end up deciding breastfeeding isn’t for you and some people give you a hard time about it, remember that being a good parent is making sure your baby is fed. It doesn’t matter if it’s breastmilk or formula. Fed is best. Period!
I've just had my 5th baby, would love to see an anti haul or products you regret buying once you have this baby. It's surprising how many I wish I'd never bought! Your looking lovely x
If you chopped yourself in half... bahaha, i love how your sense of humor gets injected into whatever you're talking about. Such a chill gal!
Great video
You look great 😍😍😍
Ovia is the app that I’m loving using, as well as the What to Expect app, and I’m currently 17 weeks. It’s been really great watching your videos!
I also had the pregnancy plus app. \nI would say the best spent money on baby thing was fee of private lactation consultant that came to our house day after we got home. She spent quite a lot of time with us, looked at my feeding as well as where I planned to feed - nursery, master bedroom and living room. Gave me lots of tips for breastfeeding as well as baby care. \n\nThe other thing I found helpful was refilling bottles of water  every night at each feeding station in the house and making sure I would have everything handy. Water, burp muslin, box of tissues and snacks. You feel huge thirst when baby latches and you could be out of reach for ages.... \n\nAnd buy one pack of PJs in 3-6 and 6-9m just to keep handy. I always find we need the next size up with no warning. My baby is almost 4 months but he is already in 6-9m clothing... My older son now 20months did not go through sizes as fast but we had the same I have grown out of all of my clothes between dinner time and bath time 😀
You might like the book by  clemmie hooper how to grow a baby and push it out she is a midwife and is amazing. Xx
:D
Ovia ia great!  I use ovia fertility!  Great app :)
I'm only 14 + 2 now and I'm pretty sure I'm just going to be living in stretchy maxi skirts and crop tops for the rest of my pregnancy. It's Spring here in Australia and it's already really hot.
omg your skin is GLOWING <3
So I started writing this out in notes thinking I just had one thing to say but turns out I have a few, hence the essay comment!\nI’m a FTM, my daughter is just over 6 weeks old and the only thing really I’d say is just do what works for you and Mike. You will find people will be eager to give advice (not to mention horror labour stories, why?!) and whilst it may be well intentioned, it may not work for you or go against what you plan on doing. Don’t let anyone pressure you into doing something you don’t want, that goes for labour and how you decide to feed. If you breastfeed, great, if you bottle feed, great. As long as your baby gets fed, is happy and puts on weight that’s all that matters. \nIf you do bottle feed I cannot recommend the Tommee Tippee perfect prep machine highly enough, it sorts the water out for you so no waiting around for the kettle to boil and cool, which at 3am is a life saver. The Tommee Tippee electric steriliser is fab too. \nApps wise:\n1. The Wonder Weeks (£1.99), I never pay for apps but this one is amazing. It explains all about babies mental development that keeps you informed about the leaps/bounds and fussy phases. It charts it on a calendar for you which then links to your personal calendar if you want it to. \n2. Sound sleeper: White noise (free), I found out about this from susiejverrill on Instagram and it’s a life saver. If baby is absolutely refusing to go to sleep, pick one of the noises and baby should soon be sound asleep. Mine is currently, finally, sleeping to the womb noise. \nOh and another thing, try and remember you’re doing an amazing job, but it’s also ok to ask for help. It’s hard work and no one will judge you if you ask for help, that’s what dads, grandparents, uncles and aunties are for. But most of all, enjoy absolutely every single second, even those moments where you feel like you don’t know what you’re doing.
Watching this at 3.30 AM while pumping 😅🐄 #momlife
We found out we are having a girl she is due Valentine's day.
I love the moment Fleur casually drops: My baby is currently a Papaya. XD
if u plan are breast feed i would highly recommend a nipple cream, the ultra blam from lush works really well, and mama’s nipple butter are my go two’s both are very natural and i love the smell and feel of them... also a good breast pump, breast pads for milk leakage, and make sure ur chair is comfy enough to fall a sleep in, cause i most likely will fall asleep well feeding. i also found a nursing bracelet helpful, u switch from wrist to wrist so u kno witch breast to either start with or that u last feed from .
Hi Fleur! Could you please do a pregnancy approved skincare and makeup?? It would be much appreciated. Congrats and thank you for all your work! ;)
please try Bravado nursing bras. They are expensive, but they are the most comfortable bras, period!
Breastfeeding- I was recommended and used this little silver cups for your nipples. I know it sounds odd but silver heals the skin (you re-activate it by washing the cups daily with bicarbonate soda) They're called Silverette \n\nhttp://www.silverette.com/en/cups-how-to-use.php
I have the Ovia app too and i love how it shows you how big the hands and feet are by week
please name your girl Delilah after your first dance song, and matches your name!
If you don't use fabric conditioner on stretchy jeans leggings etc they last longer. Conditioner ruins latex and other fibres used in stretchy clothes.
Hey Fleur :-) I use the same bras from Emma Jane (my son is now 6 months). I love them as well. I would say - if you decide to breastfeed - you should def get some wool nursing pads (Just a random webside: https://danishwool.com/collections/nursing-pads). It will keep your breasts nice and warm so that you won't get mastitis. Also lanolin balm is great for the nipples :-)
Just a tip for breast feeding. It was really difficult to get my Ellie to breast feed. We had just about had her trained when I had to go away on a business trip. Ruined everything. It's a lot of work to get a child to breast feed, so keep your schedule clear from flying/ travel that would take you away from her until your little one is completely on board with breast feeding (if that's what you choose to do).
The first pregnancy essential is.... who is the father!?
I'm going to have to look into the max vs plus because I'm wondering why anyone would want to take 3 instead of 2 tablets lol. 😵 I am sooooo in love with ur necklace would love to know where it's from please I'll be calling my bump Luna so I'm obsessed with moons! Xxx
Medela nipple shields and read as much about breastfeeding as possible.
Also with the ovia app, you get 4 choices of the baby size comparison! If you go to the settings, you can chose from fruits/veggies, silly animals, toys, and persian bakery items!
Jools olivers book Minus Nine To One is my favorite Pregnancy book. XX
have you decided what to do with your belly button piercing? you mentioned it in an earlier video and I can't remember if you came to a decision
You should download the Wonder Weeks app for when your bubba is born! It's sooooo helpful for knowing when your babe is entering a leap and gives you heaps of info of what to expect! X
Bra strap in the tea = great YouTube moment!
My bra straps been dipped in my tea 😂😂😂 love you fleur
An absolute essential is Massage oil for your perineal area to avoid ripping during birth 🙃
I'm 36 weeks. I use the Ovia App!! I find it the most entertaining. This week she is the size of a Cabbage patch doll. I am starting to get very uncomfortable. I have to go to the bathroom every hour some nights which is not very cool. But I guess it is training for the interrupted sleeps that I will have in the not so distant future.
Have you tried any of the H&M maternity wear or George at Asda? They look ok for workwear (shirts, trousers etc). Can find lots of jeans but not many proper trousers.
For once baby is here the wonder weeks app is amazing. Lets you know what stages they're going through at that time. (There is alot) like teething not sleeping etc. It really helped me when my little was growing up. He's 3 now the time really goes so quickly! Enjoy being pregnant it was the best time for me! Xx
'My baby is currently a papaya' 😂😂😂
I also had Ovia app when I was pregnant and liked it a lot :) I had my first baby at the end of August. Newborn essential I really like and I don't know if you have it yet is baby-vac...So funny, but it's a tube that you attach to your vacuum and you can clean a baby's nose with it so easily...Babies have stuffed noses so often, even if they don't have a cold and it's hard for them to eat with stuffed nose...Also treat yourself with massages, pedicures, etc. before the baby comes...:D
For goodness sake do your pelvic floor exercises!! In fact self-care in general is massively important when you have a baby (mine's 8 months now). It's very easy to let it fall by the wayside! \nTwo apps I would recommend for finishing off your pregnancy are Kegal Kat and Contraction Timer. The timer will let you track your stage 1 labour, which I found useful to help me decide when to go to the hospital. Also for the hospital I took a prepared playlist with me - it gives your brain something to focus on when the pain gets bad. Remember to take water and snacks for you and Mike! You'll both (mainly you) need your energy!
Ovia does show you fruit too! Just change what you want to see each week - you can switch between fruit & veg, weird animals, fun & games etc
Hi! I’m about a week ahead of you with a boy so it has been so fun watching your updates!! I have been loving super comfy pajama shorts since I get so hot at night and long tank tops with cardigans as it gets into Fall in the US. My skin has been super dry so I have been going through sheet masks like crazy! XOXO
There is an app called Sprout I think you might like. I’m due next week but feel ready now!
Super helpful video! I'm looking forward to getting some comfy maternity wear in the next month (it's early days for me). But I'll be checking out those vitamins today as I do want to take omega 3 as well 🙂
My little boy is six months and the most used things for me are muslins... Millions of them!!he spits up and protects us from having to change a million times a day.\nA basic light weight bouncer, I have two a tiny love rocker and napper(which is also brilliant as it lies flat)and a mothercare basic one as I can lift it one handed so if I need to go to different rooms or the bathroom its portable, I probably used it most for getting ready in my dressing room as he could see me and I wasn't running in and out of rooms to check him.\nA lie flat high chair, hauck do one and other brands(think stokke have new born inserts for theirs,they are very lush looking).bit more  pricier but great for sitting at table or in kitchen and eating and good way to get bubs used to seeing food getting made,eaten,sitting as a family.\nNot new born but my boy is now weaning and I live the Annabel karmel silicone freezer trays supper easy to batch cook and the weaning app on app store for ideas.\nHave loafs more but will leave it here...good luck xkx
Epsom salt baths when I got near the end 🙌
http://www.bounty.com/pregnancy-and-birth/pregnancy/pregnancy-week-by-week/20-weeks-pregnant this like but many more websites
I really loved the H&M maternity jeggings with the full panel that goes all the way up, way more comfortable in my opinion! Also during towards the end of my pregnancy I could not wear any sort of jeans/leggings I lived in maxi dresses!
Newborn essential - this is a bit of a strange one but the Phillips' 'Hue' light bulbs and hub have saved me with my nighttime feeds. You can control your lights with an app on your phone including a dimmer option so you don't need to get up and turn on bright lights at 3am, if you have a bedside cot, you won't even need to get out of bed! I am a wheelchair user so this has literally been the best thing ever!
★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★  ★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★\n*God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n (Just ask Him)
Prenatal vitamins are so important during pregnancy and also if nursing.  Those pregnancy apps look fun to use 👶🏼😊
you are glowing Fleur, i loved Ovia when i was pregnant
This is pretty random, but I’m currently 18 weeks with my first, loving maternity jeans, but I miss tucking in tops!  Anyone else experiencing this? 😆
I'm soaking up every single pregnancy content that you put up lol, so so interesting
Number 1 essential when I had my baby girl: Fisher Price Rock n’ Play. She slept in it until she was 6 months old. It rocks and has a sound machine attached... folds up flat for travel. Super light and easy to move around from room to room. I think it was $75 US. So excited for you guys! My Ava is 19 months old and time is just flying so quickly. Being a mom is just the greatest gift 😊 Enjoy every second!
You might not be this far ahead yet for preparing but I highly recommend socks for labor and a lovely lip balm. I had long labors and forgot socks the first time and the air con is freezing and if you have gas and air your lips get so dry x
Yeah my name is Joni, glad you are enjoying my jeans!😅
I would recommend lots of relaxation and sleep since you won't be getting much in the first few months! Keeping your stress levels low is key! A pregnancy pillow is a must have especially towards the end! Go out to restaurants and lots of movies as you won't get a chance to do that as much later! Also I would recommend packing your hospital bag early so you don't end up like me when my baby decided to come early and we were packing after my water broke! Keep an open mind about everything especially labour and birth! Most of all enjoy the pregnancy and savour this special time!
I don't know if you've already seen it but Whitney Port from the Hills has a YouTube channel vlogging her pregnancy and birth. As a momma myself I wish her channel was there when I had my daughter...she is so real and honest. I hope you will check it out :)
Are you going to do a nursery tour soon? :D Pretty please!
I don't have a baby myself but im a caregiver and i'd say you need tons of biebs, specially if you care about your baby looking neat. You will need to change them often, for heavy drooling days (lol) i recomend you look for the ones that have plastic lining on the back so moisture stays away from her skin. Also all plastic when they start with food, spots find their way and are hard to remove!
For my third pregnancy I read Jenny McCarthy's Belly Laughs. It is an interesting read. It talks about stuff during pregnancy/birth that are taboo and I found it pretty funny and real.
You should try reading a parenting book called Bringing up Bebe, it's about French parenting techniques, and an American parent. It's really eye opening!
I'm currently 8 months pregnant and I just wanted to say first that I love your updates! Also that if you want to geek it a little more the book the first 6 months is a fantastic book for newborn Info, it's written by a midwife and it's an Australian book if you want to check it out. Xx
Fleur I am obsessed in watching Emily Norris videos. She has done baby essentials which I found really useful
I'm happy for you Fleur!☺
I am actually a nanny for a currently 9month old. But have been with him since he was 3 months.  The things that i would recommend are the BabyWise book by Robert Bucknam M.D. and Gary Ezzo!! The most incredible philosophy on sleep.  Its all about fitting a baby in to your life versus the other way around.  The parents i work for are able to live their normal lives, and know when their child while actually be sleeping versus having a new schedule everyday.  Also a dock-a-tot!!! and back is best sleep suits!
Great video! I'm just behind you at 25 weeks, and I've been loving the Palmer's oil for my belly. I need to try the tummy butter! And I've been reading Bringing up Bébé. Love the book so far. Great advice from an American ex-pat living in France. Hope you're enjoying your pregnancy! You look beautiful! xx
Do you think you and Mike  or just you will do a baby names we love but won't be using video?
pregnacare max is the best used it throughout my pregnancy.....
Two kids down, working on a third. Definitely buy (if avail in UK): Nose Frida, Kinsa Smart Thermometer (probe kind), coconut oil for breastfeeding, and a touch lamp.
I'm 23 weeks pregnant and I'm so glad im not the only freak obsessed with watching every newborn essentials video on YouTube haha
My son is now 18 weeks old and my essentials were my fit ball to bounce on as I got close to due date, soft sports bras for bed and night shirts a pose to pj's. when you pack your hospital bag make sure you take some pre made milk bottles I.e cow and gate etc inc saw it takes a while for baby to latch I had been awake for days and my son had tongue tie so our only way to feed him was formula to start.? I have commented before but aquanatal classes are the best thing I ever did for exercise and to meet other mums. My no.1 tip is to meet other people at antenatal classes that are due a similar time, no matter what you read nothing beats k owing other people are going through the exact same and it is the best form of support as a new mum, I never ever read a pregnancy book as it is such a personal experience you just learn and develop every day when baby arrives. enjoy every second of being pregnant, before you know it you will have the most perfect little person by your side but my gosh you will miss your bump after a while. It's honestly the best feeling in the world xxxx
Yes leggings are a must during the last part of pregnancy and if there is one thing to invest in for baby it's a good car seat and stroller hands down
I just had my baby girl last week!!' Definitely recommended sleepyhead ! You should do a 'favourite names' , 💯for the Topshop jeans x
Hey Fleur! Would you talk about how pregnancy has effected your relationship with Mike? All good if that's too personal though! Xx
I don't have kids yet but I really like your videos :) \nWhere are your necklaces from? They're SO cute.\nAnd I also love your iPhone cover - where is it from?
I’m 35 weeks I use the glow nurture app I find talking to other ladies due the same time as me reassuring
Have you been keeping a pregnancy journal? I've always considered keeping one when I get pregnant but I'm bot sure how time consuming that would be
Omg this was me last year- I can't believe how fast this year has gone. My little boy was born 27th December. Savour everything because you'll blink and miss it!!
On Ovia, at least in the US, you can  change the size comparisons. Mines currently toys, but you can change it to fruit if you want!
I'm 20 weeks pregnant, my essentials are also the pregnacare max and clarins body tonic oil for my tummy it smells amazing and last for ages!!! Xxxxx
Hi Fleur, I think we are going to have babies around the same time! Xmas babies :) My essentials have been loose fitting dresses, baby apps The Bump and Ovia, Palmers cocao butter, and teas! First mint tea helped me with my gas in the evening but it ended up giving me more heartburn (was probably overdoing it) so I switched to Chamomile tea and drink it max once a day. Another thing I have been loving is watching pregnancy updates, newborn essentials and a day in the life with newborn videos on Youtube haha! Saludos
I’m 32 weeks pregnant with my 3rd and the biggest essential I can recommend is SLEEP!!! \nRelax and sleep as much as possible. Also, try a pregnancy massage....heaven!!
crazy but importent: Don't forget the dogs:) let them a good smiff of the baby before she'll arrive home xoxo
I’ve just noticed your audience is (also) growing at past the 1/2 million mark!  Congrats on keeping great content coming, including your wonderful pregnancy vlogs 💖
Would so love to see a baby names video from you!! Xx
Without plugging....I have filmed loads of videos on pregnancy and breastfeeding. It can be really tough and quite lonely. I found YouTube so helpful for any questions I had xxx
I'm 6months ahead. Wren is 16 weeks now. Postpartum essential; high waisted leggings that suck you in again because I felt like I was falling apart, so empty and flabby and most of my maternity jeans just let the flab hang out! These ones are most like the ones I had. \nhttps://m.topshop.com/en/tsuk/product/textured-elastic-ponte-legging-5855128\n\nBreastfeeding essential is support. All hands on deck to feed you and keep the tea and toast and pillows and blankets coming especially that first two weeks. It will hurt a lot until it doesn't. Cabbage leaves for engorgement work really well, surprisingly! \nBaby essentials; Vibrating bouncer seat, clevamama sleep pod, playmat with overhead toys, mirror for the car headrest. \nAnd the very first thing I ditched was my fancy over the shoulder nappy bag in favour of a backpack style handbag from primark. Throw it on your back, both hands free for baby. \nOh and keep getting baby clothes YOU love because you'll get SO many pink things or baby gear emblazoned with Daddy's little princess. x
If you are doings a name reveal, pls, pls, pls, Please do a sugar cookie name eveal
Where is your moon/star necklace from Fleur? It is beautiful! Thank you so much for doing this video! Love hearing all the essentials and tips you've figured out along your pregnancy. I'm so excited for you! Btw your glowing! <3
when is she due
I really hope you do breastfeed! It's the most nutritious and wonderful milk for your baby and there's nothing quite like it on Earth. Make use of lactation consultants too who can and will make your breastfeeding journey easier. \nMany women stop due to them thinking they're not producing enough, when in fact it's just the baby cluster feeding! Newborns eat constantly, it's their way of regulating your milk supply and will take around 12 weeks to establish. \nIf you haven't already, read up the science behind it all. It's incredible stuff! ❤️
Loved watching this even though I'm currently not pregnant 😍
Oh my goodness, I wasn't prepared for the fruit thing and you saying your baby is currently a papaya. :D
Currently my baby is a papaya... That made me laugh... So cute
hi  fleur ! how many weight have you gain ??
Which items are sponsored? The first one I'd say?
Are you sure you're normally a 32C Fleur? I was measured as a 32C recently and I'm quite busty for my petite frame. Either that or you just hide your boobs very well :-)

Did Chaeyoung's hair really grow that much since the KK live performances, or is she wearing extensions? I thought she was gorgeous with the short bob.
Am I the only one that thinks that jeongyeon is struggling with her lipsyncing or just isn't into the vibes of this song

Okay so I might add that yes, Scott does need a few more parts, but 1: He knew what he was getting himself into when he started singing with Mitch alone. 2: He was most of the lead in Pentatonix so he can take a breather and let Mitch be the show, and he has and I thank him for that. They are both equally amazing and they know what they are doing they don't need other people to tell them what and what not to do. I applaud you both.
cinematography is beautiful! the slow-mo shots, the lighting, everything! such a gorgeous video that only enhances the feel of the song! LURV IT SO MUCHHHH!

I REALLY CAN'T HEAR SCOTT😢

I can't stop listening to this
This music video is AMAZING
WHAT IS THIS I AM ATTACKED FALL BACK OHMYGOD
i relate to much to this song.
Also I’m obsessed with the song. Damn, I can’t stop listening.
Mitch is looking so Daddy in this!!
scott and mitch, to each other: i try but i can't deny u\nus: SIS WE BEEN KNEW
mitch looks like a hot mexican mafia
I HAVE to say this! I looooove Mitch's moustache!!!
Scott reminds me of a vampire from The Lost Boys movie
There's so many Scott's in this video though I love it

Channelling Freddie Mercury Mitch! I see you ;)
JUST GET FUCKING MARRIED ALL READY WHY YOU GOTTA PLAY ME LIKE DAT
Baby this was way too intense for me.
The video Scömìche shippers have been waiting their entire lives for
Wow that did something for me
Don't really know who these guys are.. but I love the video & the song is awesome 💯
I love you
unlike justin beibers new song, this song will NEVER get old.
2:04 When someone laughs at my girlfriends joke.
Legit. I started sobbing in the middle of class because of this video. T h a n k s.
this brought me back to life
I want to play this song till it leaks through my ears. Fun. :)
At 0:11 Mitch reminds me of Mario but in a good way
this is my favorite song off the album and this mv is so good i’m in love 
mitchs voice holy fucking shitttt
1:47 oh
NEW FAVORITE SONG OMG
To everyone who interprets this as Mitch having a thing for Scott, but vainly trying to get rid of it: just because they decided Mitch would have the lead on this song, doesn't mean it's written from his perspective. We all know they wrote their songs together, so it's equally possible most of the input for (the feelings behind) the lyrics could've been from Scott. The roles in the video are just convenient because Mitch sings the lead, but he does so in almost the entire album. That doesn't mean he wrote all the songs. You get what I'm trying to say? :) On the other hand, it could be inspired by other people they know, and not by personal experiences. It's open for interpretation, right? Anyway, I think they did the acting greatly. It's a fucking good video.
MY SCÖMÌCHE HEART
1:15 Dadddyyyyyy
Mitch:trigger the gun..\nMe:Oh no. I'm dead.
the concept 😭😭😭😭😍💜
Heart found
dammit!
loooooooooooooooooooooove it!!!!!!
Oh my godddd hes everywhere 💙💙💙
AAAAAAA SO gOoD
<3
WOWIE THIS VIDEO
I’m obsessed
They're married
you're my Robin lmao
MITCH IS SINGING ABOUT SCOTT HOLY CRAP
am i the only one that would want bloopers from this video because i feel like they went through alot of takes because scott and mitch would burst out laughing from trying to be serious.
omg scott is making me straight in this vidio haha
Mitch, please shave...you look like a creeper 👀
So, i am just gonna say i am so glad i don't really like this one. \n\nIt makes me feel like they are normal people. Because, this album is fucking fire.\n\n#cometorichmondva
Mitch please shave off your moustache!! 😂😭😭 I love you so much and your the queen but please do that!
Why does Mitch look like a pedophile (Its a joke!!)
God damn I have never been more attracted to Scott in my life. I know he's cute and all but they did an amazing job turning him into forbidden fruit. I feel like I'm hung up on Scott too now lol
mitch best look
Hi. I'm not entirely sure who this goes to, but if I wanted to send a PTX member an actual paper letter, who do I talk to, and where do I send it to? Thanks!Krystal ❤

''And while you are in Africa, I will invade Europe''
I feel so bad for you guys. This video is posted on HelloU Comedy on Facebook with millions of views! God it’s awful that thy can just steal your shit! But it did let me find you channel
I keep watching these and keep thinking This is the best one! Can't pick a favourite!
And while you are in Afrika, I wil invade Europe.  >:D

Oh i thought we're playing Monopoly :o Aren't we playing Monopoly??
Who is the mother telling them to finish and go to bed representing?\nIlluminati confirmed.
Canada would have been a funny inclusion. But... do I have to invade someone? Maybe we can just sit down and have a cup of maple syrup together?
This is GENIUS!!! Laughed so hard at the Switzerland part - proud to call it my home
Let's collab and do a 40k video! =D
Love the bit where Dmitri says And while you are in Africa, I will invade Europe
This was sooooooooo good it deserve a second part
This is my favorite one!!!
That's one of yer best skits. Bloody brilliant. I am a Catalan!.
Come on, where's Poland ? Hahaha
I like how he tries the American accent and just gives up halfway through. XD
Classic Soviet response 😂\n\n What troops?\n\nWhat political opponent?\n\nWhat downed commercial aircraft?\n\nWhat prohibited use of substance in sport?
I assume 137 Russians have watched this...
I snorted when they said “Ireland” omg and the Russian part LOOOL
Really funny! (By Switzerland have an army, mandatory military service)
I could watch this every day.  SO funny.
Why can't I contribute by translating the subtitles?
OMG, this one is the best! The best humor comes from real life 😂
Yesssss! 我说汉语!
I'm bothered by the fact that a large part of western Siberia is colored blue, and that the islands next to Australia are purple.
That's America! India is the other way, you bloody moron. Every bloody time with this guy!\nLooool
While you Africa, I will invade Europe. :D :D :) nice smile ahahhahah

I love when you get political, it's brilliant :) also, kudos for all the great accent imitations!
Wow! I’m Chinese and I’ve been following you guys for a while :) you’re great!\nI also went to two of your shows in Edinburgh, both brilliant!
Which country does the guy at 1:50 represent? The one with the green thing on his shoulders?

And while you invade Africa... I will invade Europe ;)
You guys are gas. Defo going to go see you live this year

That Dutch accent was definitely something!
9gag brought me here. I've watched it 3 times already. Now I'm bored. It's been an hour.\nWell... here we go again
When will you tour in the United States California region?
how dare you leave Portugal out of this! :)
What county are they from
9GAG make me come here...
This is at the same time the most preachy and the most politically incorrect video I have seen in a long time. And I love it.
Guys, i loved it!! i saw this videos 5 times!! amazing... keep the good work!  best regards from Lisbon :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZPrRgbJfY8 someone uploaded your video, probably because of facebook
Yes, there is Chinese people watching this video
I just have met you yesterday guys, awesome, It is so hilarious that I have just share it with a lot of people here in Bolivia, and well i would like to know if there is a way that you can start making spanish subtitles????
Brilliant :D Funny without being nasty takes real talent - genius!
Yes! You do have Mandarin speakers watching !! 😀 Me!!!!  Love you guys xxx
One of your best!
American here. You guys are great.
Okay I binge watched your Videos the entire morning and now I have a crush on Arms. Thanks I guess 🙍🏻🙄
I love that. Anna is ignoring all the 'don't hold your baby too much' 'rule and doing whatever she feels right for her I love that really like whatever makes ur baby happy and is working no matter what the rules are then do it like so what at least it's working for u and the baby. I love it
Prepping the kids for beer pong, a useful skill in high school and college. Lol
In Germany it is more common to put the baby in a sleeping bag - because blankets can move over to her face overnight and she might get too less air
Anna, I feel the nursery isn’t a very big room. A little fussing a crying is okay, if she gets hysterical, yes plz pick her up. But if you wanna redo it, maybe put her in her crib, play some soft music or fun kid songs she likes and continuously talk or sing to her as you work to redo her room the way you want so she hears your voice and knows your close. Maybe take breaks every half hr or 10 min to hold her and play with her, then do another 10 min or so. It will take longer then if you were alone (but what doesn’t with kids) but I feel you can get it done. Could work? Worth a shot?
Eduardo: So good morning I am naked cracked me up! 😂😂😂
The way Alessia was looking at Johnathan when he was trying to feed her was like smirking as if to say im not going to open my mouth 😁😁😁
Did they change the title and thumbnail? Thought it was named ‘feeding the baby’ before and had a picture of Alessia and a spoon?
Lol @ Jonathan feeding alessia, typical Man slopping it everywhere 😂
Who remembers when Emilia would just sit and rock and bang her head? 🤣🤣🤣 smh
Alessia is finally in that phase where babies have developed their growing personalities.  She's so cute and tiny petite..., just like Erika!  I think Alessia is going to be the most precious of all your children.  She's just a little beauty with those drop dead gorgeous baby blues and her long dark lashes.  Emilia has a built in best friend and Eduardo will have the company of two great sisters to walk through life with.  Of course, a brother will even the odds for Eduardo and give him a brother/best mate to leverage his odds, but I'll just leave that area up to you guys.  Love your vlogs!!!
i love how excited the kids got on the bowl game x so lovely xx
Get a Lillebaby carrier, Anna! It will help so so so much. The 6 in 1 Complete in Woven. Just trust me. SO SOFT.
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  wait why are you talking? 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said  good morning my friendliest friend very slowly and when johnathan asked him if he had a girlfriend he said   yes then when johnathan said what is her name? Eduardo said  emilia and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera when johnathan was holding her :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nJohnathan is a great dad and Anna is a lovely mum x
How cute are your kids!! Love watching your videos 💚💛❤️💙
When are use going to move house
You are such a good mom.  It's a lot of work and you do a wonderful job.  What a good example you are for others when it comes to parenting. Love watching you guys.  Been watching since Emilia was a baby.  It just keeps getting better.
😂Eduardo coughing at Alessia's was so funny , I love the kids theyre so cuttee❤️
It's bounces off and out cause its a spiky ball
Guys it's been officially one year since i've watched sacconejolys every single day! love you guys
Anna YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL 👏🏻👏🏻
I wish it was cold in Texas where I live 😕 -*jealous*
I hear ya Anna! You rock as a mom :)
The best bit made me roar with laughter Jonathan feeding the baby and get bored face. And Eduardo stripping off. Typical child  very funny
 So good morning. I am naked!
I KNEW I couldn't possibly be the only person in the world who says Whatever song is playing on the radio when I turn it on will depict how the day is going to go !!!!!!!!!!!!! Woooooo !!! Haha !! Thanks Johnathen !! 😍😍😍
Awww Alessia was so happy to see her mommy in the beginning of the video. Too precious for words!!!
Anna you are so right ❤ dont ever listen to other people. A mom always knows whats the best for her children/babys. + you can never cuddle your baby to much. Enjoy every minute ❤
I love Eduardo's passion for Little Mix 😂😂
eduardo's favorite song is shout out to my ex by little mix?? omg that's funny! hahaha
Let Allessia nap in your room while you tackle the nursery
When are yall moving?? Lol at Jonathan's Comment...Alessia is so cute!
Middle child syndrome 😂😂😂😋😂 I'm a middle child
Anna you are my idol!!!! Such a strong and inspiring woman 🌸🌸
Aleesia is cute.  She loves that camera!  What is everyone being for Halloween?
Do you like to baby wear? Maybe that’s help getting stuff done!
You guys are such a beautiful family. I really love watching your videos. You always lift my spirits up. Keep being awesome. <3
Eduardo I am naked. He always cracks me up.
Anna I'd love to see your nighttime routine! Like makeup removal to bed! :)
Hi everyone, I'm wanting to give it a shot at vlogging so I have memories to look back on. Should my channel be called\n- Zac and Sophie\nor\n- Sophie + boys\nAm open to any other suggestions too! ☺\nMy fiance name is Zac and we have 2 little boys.\nThanks for the help ☺❤
My mom called me her broach because i never wanted to be away from her.
Alessia is a smiling baby like Emilia when she was young. Hahaha! Edwardo was the opposite.
I can't believe Eduardo only 3 it sounds weird when you say interview with my three year old so cute my little cousin is 3 Lenny and he still can't speak very well he can speak but he still can't say proper conversations and when he does try you don't under stand he turnt three 2 weeks ago xx
My brother is Eduardos age and all he wants to do is strip off it's so funny but annoying xx 😘
Love the kiddos. Love u all!
My 3 year old brother likes Steve and Maggie
Anna never mind what others think you are both great parents and no matter what age we are we want and hug from mammy
the most adorable family on the internet 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
“don’t press that button!” Haha Jonathan’s Irish accent really came out there
Omg when Edwardo said that emelia was his girlfriend, dead 😂😂😂
Shoutout to my ex😂 Eduardo is hilarious 😂🙈
why don't you put alessia in that like thing that moves up and down and its always moving maybe she'll enjoy it and set it outside the nursery door so she can see you. then maaaybe the little cutie will let you do thing without holding her. I'm sure she will cry at first but yeah shouldn't get her use to always being carried cause that's what happens. she gets spoil and thinks well if I cry mom will pick me up lol
I'm in love with this family.
Get your baby snuggles while you can.
Johnathan is teaching Amelia how to be the queen of beer pong when she's older 😂😂😂😂
That ball you were using was way to bouncy. Fun though. Alessia looking at Emilia at the dinner table was so cute.
Just keep cuddling as much as you want to. The time flies too quickly.
Eduardos saying is I'm Anna or I'm Elsa😂❤️
Ha-Ha!  Jonathon is so hilarious - Why is the tv show from last night coming over the radio?!  Anna is right, there is no such thing as loving a baby too much! 💕
I adore Eduardo he is just adorable is hillarious and extremely clever and we'll developed for his age!!!😋😉😃👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👶🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕
I laughed sook hard this vlog :\nEmilia: Wait! Why are YOU talking😂😂😂
Oh my gosh is it me or is jonathan screaming nonstop at the camera? I wish he would just talk normal sometimes and not so animated.
Jonathon, stop screaming.  Are you on something your so hyper active weird in this video.  I wonder why the children don't listen, hmmmmmm.
Love you, guys!!  :*
anna is sooo gorgeous though:(
Ffs
The cutest kids ever 💕
Yes Eduardo!!! Mini mixer right there!!!!
Amazing parenting! :)
that baby looks like Miley Cyrus
Sweet Eduardo
Im dead! Emilia - Diahrrea, diahrrea (sp?) shes so funny!
Hi Guys!
Just take it
Did you change the title or is it just me ?
Not worth listening to Senborra\nSACCNOE JOLYs are multimillon subscribed and worth it \nGot muted.........
Aww
Fav irish family 💚
Pobre bb no tiene cámara para mirarla y no tiene protección la cuna el video anterior se metió un golpe muy feo porfavor tengan más cuidado los amoooooooo
EDUARDO GETTING NAKED AND JUMPING IN THE CRIB WITH ALESSIA IS THE MOST BIZARRE THING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED.
Have you tried baby wearing so you can get stuff done? All my friends swear by it to get the housework done!
Ok I Alesia's adorable we get it. But did they forget they have 2 other kids? I know babies attract more views🙄 but come on. Almost every thumbnail lately has been Alessia
Emilia is Eduardo's hero and gf.
I can’t believe Eduardo is only 3! He acts so much older I think!
Anna, I love you honesty. I had a baby boy around the same time as you did Alessia (I think they are about 2 weeks apart) and with it being my second I have really struggled with some of the day to day!! I think you're doing an amazing job and you are just so real!! Thank you for making me fee like I am doing a great job too. Xxx
Does anyone know what is Vodafone please leave in the comments
What day was this filmed on. Are the vlogs not filmed the day before they're uploaded anymore?😔😭
Poor Edourdo he has  pressure of speech he never gets the chance to verbalise himself fully. Jonathon always has to be yapping  ALL the time
Emilia saying Give me some hope LOL she is adorable
I haven't watched lately!  What happed with the new house? Are they getting a new house like they said? Or what happened?
You were saying we're moving soon and when we move a lot these past few weeks, now it's all we're never moving what happened??! Please fill us in more about this, it's so confusing 🤔
watch +kavos video about family vloggers
Silly spoons for feeding babies
I really hope you taught Emilia and Eduardo they're not supposed to climb in the cot with Alessia unless you or Anna are there. I'm imaging all sorts of tragic scenarios here...
At 6:49 Edwardo is naked 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Eduardo is an expressive child. He have a big heart and plenty of love to give. Him getting naked is his way of saying that he does not want Alessia getting the grubbiness from his school clothes. I am sure his parents will teach him the norm of things as he grows older. He is only 3 For God's sake....
Omg she slept whole night on her tummy!Is it safe to do so.Bit confused as i was told to make my baby sleep on her back by my midwife😔
Emilia and Edwardo need more discipline. They should not talk to you or ignore what you say
I finally realized who Anna reminds me of: Julia Roberts
I don t know when they are moving but it s hard to take all the things that they need in the new house and they have 2 kids in school and a baby it must be hard
So Good Music relax 😌👌✌
Brandon and Zion anyone ? 😍😍😍😍😍
I love it I keep on listening to it nonstop
Actually I'm a teacher! Hahaha 😍😄😅
These boys are fine as hell 😍😙😋👅💦🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They're style is so real... it's like my guy friends talking to me😫❤️
GAWD I LOVE THIS. I LOVE THEM.
I don't know yall. But I like yall.
that one w/ red jacket has a real nice voice
This was so cute 😂❤️😂. Made my day
Proud of you guys :3
I was vibing to this shit
FIRE! i  flix with this.
I fr love Edwin like he sooo cute😍😍😍😍
Why Dont We is better. Though i like PRETTYMUCH just as much <3
I'm screaming why that white boy dancing like that?? All over the place.
This came out on birthday
Change the playback speed to 1.25.... you’ll thank me later
This is better than 'would you mind'.
Soo much energy... y'all gonna be huge🔥
Austin needs to sing more!!!! and have more solos
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME WATCHING ANYTHING OF THEIRS AND IM LITERALLY IN LOOOOOOVE
I used to be a hardcore 1 Directioner and I was there to experience their last album Made in the AM and I loved all of their songs so much that I would listen to my 1D playlist every single day until I got tired of them and then I would wait months of not listening to them and then restart so it was kinda like I was rediscovering their music and that worked for a while until 8 months ago. So I was without a favorite boy band for a while until my sister introduced me to PRETTYMUCH.\nNow PRETTYMUCH, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND IVE ONLY KNOWN YOU EXISTED FOR A WEEK. WOULD YOU MIND AND TEACHER ARE AMAZING AND ARE MY FAVORITE SONGS RIGHT NOW. AND THIS COVER IS MY FAVORITE COVER OF YOURS AND I LISTEN TO IT 30 TIMES AFTER SCHOOL, AND YES I 100% AGREE THAT YOU ARE MUCH BETTER THAN 1D!! 1D could only sing, be funny and do quirky dance moves. but YOU GUYS are amazing!! you can do EVERYTHING!!! dance! Sing! Harmonize! Be funny! Be beautiful! Be trendy! Be everything a boy band should be and more! So I just like to say that I am a huge fan of yours and it would mean so much to me if you were to reply to the comment. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING SUCH AN AMAZING GROUP!!\n\nP.S. BRANDON AND ZION I LOVE YOU SO MUCH\nNICK AND EDWIN YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL \nI AM BEYOND EXCITED TO LISTEN TO YOU FIRST ALBUM!
I swear I'll never get tired of these guys <3
nick you can dance way better than that, honey

Just discovered the band ! I just love the song !! I think that if they promote in S.korea or asia for while they would be successful as well there =) ! !! Waiting for more songs for them =) !!!
This title supposed you could be my not TEACHER\n\n*my opinion if you don't like my opinion don't hate me *
I think I am the reason this video has 400,000 views lol
Back Street Boys de 2017!!
No i just like boys.... dancing and singing and... it's not like l'm gay or something
God I love them 😍
🙋 Excuse me , teachers? Can I have a bathroom pass so I can go scream real quick!!??
good song. needs choreography. Choreography = views! No dance moves to learn, no reason to watch this again.
I really tried to listen a few more times but this is so cringe. The music video was lame but i understand as they are pretty new?
Fluffle Puff I'm thinking like a type of braid on Austin finally someone gets mere!!!
THEY CANT SING. There are few good bands anymore, they suck, why do people listen to this crap.🤦🏻‍♀️🤷‍♀️💩
omg I love them sooooooo cute the song is so good uh their voices uhh
my goal in life is to be as happy as them tbh
I’m entirely too old for this, but it just reminds me of every mass produced pop act in the 90s and I love it 😂
I am your lover now

She has a great husband that would never leave her or stop loving her.\nThe only one annoying vlog is Judy life. (sorry for the people who likes them) They are pretty annoying but for this family vlog they aren't annoying \nthey are a perfect family. A fun, funning, loving, and amazing family
I am new to vlog. I was confused by the beginning, how old is isaac?
Isaacs speech is improving in each vlog, he just developed at his own pace! That other little boy developed extremely fast, and Isaac was a little slower. He will get there someday!
Isaac has no chill, he really wanted that cone. Haha that look on his face is so adorable!
Isaacs little accent melts my heart wow😭💕
Love seeing Isaac talk all the time <3
Hi bubz. Can i ask what lotion or moisturizer do you put on ayla's face? Shes so cute😍
Issac is so brave not to cry out for you guys during that thunderstorm.  I can tell that he was truly terrified.  Bubz, you are not that big actually.  Considering this is you second child, you could be a lot bigger!  You will be back in shape in no time.  The next time family  tries to body shame you, just smile and say thank you.  And if a stranger dares to go there, just let Tim handle it!  LOL Tim: Screw you, B__!!!!  AHHHAHAHHAHHHAAA
I am absolutely dreading seeing family in Hong Kong!! \n\n‘Why have you gained weight? Why don’t you have a job after university? Well that’s what you get for taking a creative subject...’  ffs 😐
I think your face is just a little fuller than it used to be and that is why they notice it so much more but I think you look amazing Bubz. Healthy and happy and your family looks the same. Like you said in time it will change and you did just have a baby.
Omg I cried when you all were saying good night to Isaac 😭 oh my pregnancy hormones
This kid stopped, said in English that Lindy is 10 times his age.... these 3 year olds out here.. amazing 😩😩
Naturally you have baby weight atm but tbh it's not even that much! Youre Still quite slim even with the gain, you'll be back to your usual size soon but just remember size isn't everything and you are beautiful no matter what!
you look perfect ❤ and you are such an inspiration ❤
Bubz, you have two beautiful children and are beautiful just the way you are on the inside and out. I love your sweet, kind, sincere, and down-to-earth personality. God bless you, Tim, and your two little ones! Sending love and hugs your way! ♥♥
That child who new his multiples sounds adorable. XD
No joke in hongkong the kids have too much competition kid start there addition at like 2 and learn algebra at 5 or something
Can someone tell me what camera that is she’s using to vlog???
ayla bathing looks so much like Isaac when he was her age... omoooo so cute.. love them chubbchubb rolls
She's tiny. And her babies are born chubby and cute
Ayla is such a happy Bub😄
The same thing happened to me although I'm not overweight even after baby .. My family would call me fat. And after all the sleepless days or nights it could definitely be a damper on the spirits. Keep up mummy bubz u r doing so well! They really don know what they r saying. We r the best mums to our kids for giving them what we can
Can you make a “how to vlog“ video?
I have that dyson vaccum machine too but ends up dying after a few areas of the house, then needs a long time to be fully charged Ahahahaha
I don't know about your family, but I find it ironic that the family members telling you you need to lose weight are usually bigger than you themselves, that's how you know they don't know what they're talking about 😂
The family hurt thing is so true, I cannot believe anyone would say that is so mean :-( I think you look beautiful..
It's usually the older generations that do this too.\nMy mom is my worst reminder of all my insecurities cause she always says I'm fat even though I'm not and then I start believing her :C
Ive never comment but I just want to tell you I understand how you feel about the whole weight thing. Im 4'8 and have always weighed under 100 pounds to 110. I had a baby girl around the same time as your baby girl. Her name is Ahsoka Nohea born 7-11-17. My husband friends give him advise about my pregnancy but they were from wifes that didnt have the same difficulties I had. I was sick the whole time. My body expanded everywhere, shoulders, face, neck, sides and my feets were so swollen you could see the water coming out of my legs if you touched it. I had heartburn that no amount of tums could cure. I tried exercising but I could barely walk for 30 mins without having to sit down. I tried eating heathly but I would throw it up oh and water I would throw up too. My weight gain and the fact we were dealing with a big move made me very emotional. I'm just not losing the weight as fast as all the other mommies. Always i dont want this to be a downer but just know your not alone.
Isaac is so incredibly cute when he says please mommy. My heart melts
Both your kids are adorable, and I love the body positivity you're expressing.  My relatives are the same way regarding my weight gain (which is really from stress eating because of studies lol), but it's nice to hear how you deal with it.  Ayla and Isaac are so cute!  Thanks bubz <3
Hi bubz! i think u need new vlog intro w isaac n ayla. xD  Btw may i know whats the background music @ 4.53?
A friend of mine had similar issues after she had her kid. I went to her daughter’s first birthday party and she took a moment to sit with me in a private corner and vent that one of her family members had criticized her choice of outfit for the occasion because it made her look fat. She almost broke down in tears. I don’t understand how anyone, especially family members can put down a woman who is pregnant or has given birth recently.
They want you to have a happy marriage. The lack of momentum leads to further loss momentum. Weight gain strains attraction between the husband and wife.\n\nThey want a happy family. If it's happy wife happy life than there is also the equivalent for the husband side. Relationships require dual effort from both sides.\n\nThis is why they say such things. It's out of care.
Normally boy looks like mom and girl looks like dad but urs is the opposite 🙃 I actually like it that way .... goofy son and pretty daughter ☺️
if u wanna listen to Selena Gomez - Hands To Myself then click on this link \nhttp://yobuilder.com/4Xfm
Ayla is getting so big already.. she's only 2months old. She looks so much like her Mummy!
Bubz, you literally have the perfect family. 2 adorable dogs, an awesome son who is 2 years older than your beautiful daughter, and an amazing husband. I love your family, P.S. you neeeeed to add ayla to the intro :DDDD
You are beautiful to me ! :) Family can be rude most of the time!
Second borns always seem so chill. They’re just happy to watch what’s going on and be part of the family. First borns have no chill!! Lol.\nI’ve got an 18mo daughter and I can’t imagine having another sibling in the house. She demands your full attention! Lol. Maybe it’s a first born girl thing? 👸🏼😳
But Lindy you’re 10x the mum any there kid has!
Can someone explain what Bubz means by feeling condemned by a 3 year old? I'm just confused why she lied about Issac's age o.O??
Bubz, i have a question: if it is a cultural thing for your Chinese relatives to be blunt, wouldn't it be culturally okay to be blunt back at them? And just answer with something like yes, but I just had a baby and you are hurting my feelings? Or just it only go one way?
4:58 That face makes my heart MELT TT-TT <3
Oh my goodness I had to pause this video for a second to make this comment. Issac has the most cutest accent when he talks I love the way he says mommy and daddy, cutest little thing ever..okay continuing watching the rest of the video.☺️❣️🙈
Celebrities use this fan!\nI don't really care lol.. \n\nHaha you and your family make my day! It was off to a very bad start, and watching you brings me so much positivity <3
So how old is Isaac?
Issac is super adorable. He's so grown up now!
Issac is one of the sweetest boys I have ever seen <3
Awwwww she's a chunky baby just like isaac was ❤️❤️❤️
Ayla is the cutest, just like her mom! Also, I have that same little portable fan. IT'S LIFE CHANGING. I like to use it in the morning to help facial mists or makeup sprays dry faster, too. xD
Bubz , You Are An Excellent Example Of A Lovely Human Being... ! 😊
You are perfect the way you are. I am sick of the world trying to make girls and women think they must be perfect based on social values.
I’m honestly surprised that so many people are commenting on your weight because you don’t even look like you’ve gained to me. I think you look great!
Isaac is such a polite and well mannered kid, well done to you both. I come from a Chinese family too, so I totally understand where you are coming from. I know I will never do it to my kids when they get older ❤️
Oh so Ayla has cradle cap. That's easy, coconut oil or baby oil will soften the skin then gently get a fine tooth comb and gently run it along the skin. I was able to get my son's cradle cap off that way. It's normal and common, and usually happens around newborn age to 1 years old
Hey bubz really my son is also 3 but he s not even interested in abc or ne learning thing it make me sad
I’m due my first baby any day now and I was at a wedding about 8 weeks ago. One of the grandmas looked at me when I was eating and said wow you still have a while to go yet and you are pretty big. I managed to laugh it off but I was not expecting comments like that! I’m a UK size 8 normally and I’m probably a UK size 12 now. I just keep thinking of how sore you must have been during the final weeks now I am there. You did amazing!
5:00 And this is how God came into play/ was invented :D lol
Hi Bubz-mommy ! im glad you all are ok there! i hope your little doggies are ok also! please tell us about them at next video! :)
Feel the same way with my 2 toddlers..😭
lol never miss an arm day😂😂😂
Loved how she randomly spit on your hand
Your not fat because, that what happen when you give brith and it call beauty and plus you should said I also human begin too so sometime my body is not going to be like as you wanted my body to look afther getting brith because I also getting old so there no need to worry about my body no more because I already have someone who love me for who I am and how I look like and take care of my two kids. 😊😍😘 but it just depend on what you decide and choose so yea . 😊 and plus your baby is so cute when she yawn 😍😘.
LOVE your makeup whenever you're in Hong Kong! Looks so much fresh :D
so cute😍😍😍 I like the way you and Tim teach your children. Love care.
She is so cute!
Isaac is growing so fast 😭 what a cutie
She's such a happy baby I'm so in love
This kids make my day. SOO CUTE 😍😍
Bubz you look beautiful, and your babies look so happy.
My grandma used to tell everybody, including me: 'you're fat!' while she would take a big piece of your belly or your butt to prove her point. And she would say this as a compliment, very happy that at last the kids and teens in her family put some meat on their bones... We didn't like it at all, compliment or not. But she was adorable in everything else, so... We gave her that privilege of being our personal scale.
Isaac seems to be speaking more and more, and he is so polite! He really is getting cuter and cuter by the day <3
Just tell them sometimes that is the eye opening for them I know that horrible felling
People need to stop with how one looks because everyone is made in God's image and we should Embrace our Individuality! not compare,their opinion is their opinion and it's better if they just chill out
Ah I get it a lot too....the constant you're so fat! Lose some weight! I've honestly given up trying to say no, I'm healthy! It's quite bad as I am at the age when girls feel the most vulnerable to these comments and do extreme things to make themselves perfect. However, rather than feeling crappy about it, I use it to my advantage and make jokes about it. I've been hearing the comments over and over I basically immune to it 😄
ohh Lindy,  may I know your lipstick ? that you wore in the car.  it's look so nice on you :)
the disconnect between the mentality of asian relatives who live in asia vs. your own upbringing as an asian in a western country will always exist. you just need to remember that in their culture, it's automatically assumed that every individual wants to be thin. they're not telling you you're chubby or fat because they don't love you, but rather it's because they care about you and are trying to be helpful in the way that they think they should be.\n\nwhich is totally not to invalidate anything you're feeling, because i've absolutely been there too. i gained about 15 pounds in the last year and a half and while i'm not fat, i look noticeably different to my family. when i'm just sitting there with my mom and my sister having unrelated conversations and my mom suddenly finds another way to bring up my weight and my out of control habits, it makes me feel like she can't even see her own daughter as anything but a measurement of fat. but you just have to keep doing what you're doing and let it roll off you, while reminding yourself that it's not a matter of love or not-love, but just difference.
Hi bubz! Love your videos! You are doing so well only having a baby 2 months ago and looking after two kids! Don't worry about what people say, I cannot understand them, esp the women who probably have been through the same thing! My daughter is exactly 2 months older than Ayla and had the same white patch on her tongue, just gently brush with some cooled boiled water and toothbrush and it all went away! I read if you do not, then it can lead to thrush ... all the best :)
#1 - You are AMAZING! And you're so right, it took your body 9+ months to make that adorable little girl of yours and it's going to take time to heal.\n#2 - She could have cradle cap. My son had it. You just need to get a little brush and gently scrub her scalp with some soap and warm water. It will go away soon enough. \n😊💖
Older family members are never held responsible for their hurtful words because others make excuses for them, such as, It's just a generation/culture thing!, or, They honestly feel like they are helping you. None of the hurtful comments will ever stop until you hold them accountable for it.
Hi Bubz, so glad you guys back to Hong Kong. I have been watched your videos for such a long time.But i was like the silent viewer ,quite shy to leave a comment.Your videos are so amazing and inspirational.It is trilled to see you guys vlogging, from seeing Tim's proposal until Ayla is born,. I really feel like being part of your family. I know Youtube has tons of youtubers but you guys are absolutely  be my favorite. I remember once you asked Tim what is the thing that he miss the most in HK, he said food!!!! Since I am currently working at yuen long ,i always looking for amazing dish for lunch , i would just killing me by not sharing the good food for you guys.Bubz i know you love dim sum you mentioned in the video back in Belfast said you didn't find a place in hk served good dim sum.I found a place call Big Belly at 教育路they did serve nice dim sum,you should try it!!!!!Anyway wish your family all the best ,healthy and happy ^^Have a nice time in Hong Kong .God bless your family .
all children develop different I wouldn't beat yourself up over lying about your sons age, I'm sure most mom's on here have told some porkies now and then. lol
Awww Ayla got your eyes bubz♡♡

If you rinse out a clean wash cloth you can use it to gentle clean Lala's tongue just like teeth brushing to help with the white tongue. I used to do it once daily- gently because breast milk is so fatty :) is even do it to clean the sides of his cheeks, gum stimulation to help with milk teeth and the roof of he younger. You just gotta go slow as not to hit their gag reflex lol she's so cute!!
you are really fat these days, bubz
Okay, okay! Here's the theme remix: https://soundcloud.com/andrew-mcmurry-487864575/pubg-theme-from-battlegrounds-the-zone\nI made it downloadable, too. You guys can use it for whatever you want. Glad everyone enjoys the video so far!

I wonder if his mother is so supportive because shes afraid to let him go, to let him grow up. Because her other children are adult babies so, it could be a coincidence they all have that interest, but likely the way they were raised?
Look...it's a documentary about liberal fucks.
his girlfriend must be alright with this.
If only I could get away with doing this... #sigh  lol
This is the world we live in... take it all in
I bet he wants to suck on those boobies . 😂😂😂
There are worst people than he, like furrys or bronys
I think his life is so  sad 😢
Damn obvious he never got this love as a actual baby. Who ever his mom is doesnt need to be a mon at all
I know it's his life and I have no place to judge anybody but yuck
how the hell did I get to this?
LMAO. Bro you need the red pill ASAP. I'm ordering your prescription to join MGTOW and reevaluate who you are.
This guy is pathetic he is weekminded and cant live in the real world
At least it isn't suicide
This is actually a common thing it's called little space. And no it isn't because they we're sexually assaulted as a child. People who have a little space just always have a state of mind where they can be carefree like a toddler or a regular infant. If you think it's weird go online and search it up. THIS IS COMMON. Not a lot of people are open about it. He's open about it which is good. So stop saying that this is why this shit doesn't happen. People get a fucking brain and do your god damned research
His mum is a milf
is this donald trump?
Let's get this straight. \nThe only reason this *man* (If Christ willing) is acting like a baby is because he's afraid of society and wants safety. This is what lacking of family and friends does people, get yourself at least one good friend.
Do you shit yourself too ?  .  .  .  .  .Im serious.
I don't like how they played creepy music with it. This is something that comforts him and makes him happy and we don't have the right to make it seem creepy or weird as much as we think it is. Also, this probably took incredible courage to get filmed in such a vulnerable state.
okay,am on the weird site of youtube again....
I think he doesnt hurt nobody i hope he finds peace and happines from all the trauma and abuse
What did i just watch😲
is this a fucking joke?
1:32 this nigga is sweatin damn fuckin put on a t-shirt and shorts
At least I know I'm not the oldest one who drinks out a baby bottle?
What in the world did I just watch?
And I thought the U.S. is weird. But boyyy the U.K. is a whole other level.
I T S  N O T  S E X U A L  A T  A L L
Which one is more crazy?
Thats it I'm deleting YouTube.
He is so cute
I respect this guy
What the living fuck
HOLD UP. I’M BEGINNING TO THINK IT’S JUST A FETISH \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJK lmao
I have a feeling he never had a good childhood when he was a baby and never experienced it. I'm guessing he wants to experience it on his own. Its weird of doing this even when you're 31 but shit... It looks like he haven't gone a lot of asleep cause he has bags under his eyes.
Makes me feel sad for him on what kind of childhood he had.  What kind of parents did he have?!
God, I wanna kick his fat a**.
5:50 The cat looks like it's borderline suicidal and I don't blame it
I heard that this guy have voted for Hillary
*ITS NOT SEXUAL AT ALL*
If this isn't sexual at all then something must of bad happen when his younger
i hope the next hitler comes along soon so we can have less people like this.
Well its better than that guy that had a sexual relationship with his car.
Why does this guy look like Francis from pee wee hermans movie?
He must be Hillarys baby snowflakes are going crazy
He probably lives off the government and has nothing else to do..... so he acts like a baby! Jesus Christ the hell is wrong with people?
So he doesn't jerk off?
I just don't understand .? Lmao
Cut him some slack let him enjoy his life . He had a bad childhood
Lol a women playing with a baby man XD
Momma said I can’t be a kid forever but this guy is on a whole other level 💀💀
You’re dumb. Get a life ya fag
What in the actual fuck did I just watched 😂
this might sound weird but , im glad he is being him self
what the actual fuck
Does he have a job?
That’s a strong case of autism
Am I the only one who doesn't find this weird?
Well it's time for bed
How much did they pay him for this?
“Something he keeps under wraps”\n(Shows diapers on television)\n \nThat’s a great secret
just play some damn video games
He probably is still a virgin
I'm surprised he hasn't broke the crib yet lmfao
I wonder what Supernanny has to say about this
Robber: alright Derrick you go in that room I'll go in this one \nDerrick: ok boss \nDerrick:( goes in room )\nStanley: wanna play \nDerrick: ( walks out of room ) \nRobber: alright what you find I found a TV \nDerrick: I think it's best if we leave\nRobber: why m8\nDerrick: I'll tell you later
Hey let him live his life Ik all of us want to go back to being babies to do things differently
I love this guy
Grow up you idiot and go get a job you over grown fat shit
This bitch made all of this stuff when he could have used all of the time to get a fucking job and do something in life
WTH did I just watch
He foreal too lol
Only white people
OMG the cringe!!!
Fxcking white people
fucking virgin
Wtf
Shes aight

Welcome to my crib

Kane, I just happened 2 b peeking at random videos n here you are filling my ears with such joy, you have a unique voice n masculinity essence that shines thru your songs. I'm going to keep listening, Sadie La Boricua.
This is probably the best version of Kane. It's natural, and suits him so much better.

I just can’t 😭❤️
Omg Hannah I've commented this before and I am honestly sorry for repeating myself, but if you like your romantic comedy tropes deconstructed, then give Crazy Ex Girlfriend another go!!!  I swear every other favourites video you give me another reason to be sure that it's basically made for you. But, you know, no pressure. :)
Can you film a video where you show all the books on your bookshelf and mention a few of your faves and why. You have so many books I really want to hear some good recommendations.
I work in technical theatre and I had the opportunity to shadow the touring stage manager for Wicked one year. Best experience of my life, that show is amazing!! \nI’ve never had a chance to experience an Immersion theatre show, but I get so excited every time I hear about one. I’m so glad you shared!!
The Virgin Suicides is SUCH a great book. I read it in one sitting while sitting on a bench in  park, and it was the most beautiful day.
The actos name from the big sick is Kumail Nanjiani and I highly recommend his stand up and maybe even more so his twitter. Seriously it's a treasure box! I love that guy. oh and while I'm at it, he's in the show silicon valley. Also amazing.
I live in Toronto and I wish I saw you guys but omg I always feel so proud when people love toronto!!!
I saw Wicked in the thumbnail so I’m here
What's with the 720p50? Why 50?
I want to recommend the TV show Looking! It's really great!
i adore EE jewellery!! so jealous they sent you all their beautiful stuff
I love the Eclectic Eccentricity jewellery, so pretty. Last month I read quite a few books, but at the moment I'm reading The Sun and Her Flowers which is beautiful. Also I've been loving the articles on the sex and relationship site neutral.love - which I think you'd probably enjoy. :)
It'd be a shame if someone did a video with Boyinaband
Thanks for the recommendations, Hannah! \n\nI finally got around to seeing Jessica Jones ... great show! I also watched Mr. Robot, which was weird but good. I've mostly been enjoying my writing class in my spare time, though. :)
Can I just recommend that you watch a film called I am me it's heartbreakingly beautiful and British
some nice favourites you have there :)
and i am here sitting and waiting for a fionas apple record. and she releases an album once every 7 years or so.
We did the same with House of Cards! We'd already watched it though, so we started the new series just after GOT finished *I had the void too...*I also love how you described it as GOT in the Whtie House as that's how i describe it to people! Along with Game of Thrones meets West Wing :P\n\n i also really recommend Designated Survivor, if you're looking for one AFTER House of Cards. Isn't Kevin Spacey AMAZING? One of the best actors and it only gets better!\n\nI'm also a huge Reese fan, ever since her Legally Blonde days - i just went to see the musical on friday night in Bristol and it reminded me how much i adore the film! It's also so lovely to see the jewellery brand on here as i discovered them on Not on The Highstreet a few years ago :) As ever, your videos never fail to bring a smile to my day! xxx
The star actor in The Big Sick is Kumail Nanjiani.
You came to Toronto and didn't say :(   Yeah, it's cool here, 'cept when the winters suck xD
Hannah your brows are on point girl
Wicked is good Hamilton is the best! Highly recommended
You have the best favourites videos
thank you! ( your hair texture is first class, Hannah! you are looking Gorgeous, I like you very much, obviously!) thanks! good night! what's next? have a wonderful happy week ahead! thanks!
i read it only happens in the movies yesterday, it’s the first book i’ve read all the way through in about 3 years (i used to read all the time and went off it completely) it was so good, planning on reading the spinster club ones next
House of Cards is my favourite netflix series EVER! Wicked is also my favourite musical so i'm all over this favourites video :)
My September favourite was definitely meeting you and Lucy at Buffer Fest :)
You're jumper looks so cosy... where's it from?
Have you found your perfect man yet?
I love The virgin suicides :)
I loved Holly's book! and those jewellery pieces look beautiful! :)
Omg yes! Share that First Aid Kit love <3
Dear Hannah,\nI want to thank you for a lot of things but I think I'll tell you a story first, so here goes nothing: \nIt was 11:45 or something and we were sitting on the tables because it was breakfast break (we have that at my school). Everyone is really exited because Anderson asked Eva if she wanted to go to dance lessons for the 9th grade dance (we have that at our school too). There is a certain pressure in the room because              everyone is expecting other boys to ask other girls... who do I want to dance with me? I ask myself...without hesitating I already know: Andrew, with the ginger hair who sits behind me. Without thinking twice about it I ask him: are you going to dance lessons? No, I don't have anyone to go with and he turns around, almost in shame, because he can't  pluck up the courage to ask\nanyone. Do you want to dance with me? I ask and I see his face light up...I still don't know if in embarrassment or happiness. Yeah, I'd love to he says. Why? Don't you have a boyfriend? Because I like you...I  a friend way and he's not my boyfriend, he's my best friend plus he's too old for the dance, he'd have to be 4 years younger \n\nLater that day alot of my friends had been asked out to dance, but none of them had asked any boy. Who are you dancing with? They asked me. Andrew. oh, did he ask you? \nNo, I asked him *silence* \nThey didn't seem to get the idea that it was totally fine to ask a boy out! (Not even out, to dance lessons!!)\n\nBut sure enough the girls that weren't asked, asked the boys themselves the next day.\nHooray for empowering women! \n\nI'm telling you this because I think women like you Hannah, gave me the confidence to do my little act of rebellion against societies ideas. \n\nI probably git some stuff wrong and part of its cheesy but I hope I got out what I could. Thankyou Hannah:)
I went to see wicked the same night :) it was my second time and I'm still awed by it. I wish I could live somewhere nearer to London to be able to see more Musicals!
My boyfriend and I are watching House of Cards and we’ve just gotten into season 2 as well! Also, you’ve made me want to finally read The Virgin Suicides.
haha I think those intros are so cute :P
I'm seeing wicked november 8th with my school chorus! How is it? :)
I LOVE The Virgin Suicides movie. Would you say the book is worth it? I'm not sure if I should read it.
I love your hair in this video! Cutie.
I once actually had to explain to a guy that the way men pursue women in movies is generally not a good idea in real life.  He thought that was actually how it's done.
Hey!\n\nI've just recently discovered your channel and i love it!\nthe  jewellery.... omg.. i want it. I hope i can find something similar here (i'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).. i looove galaxy and space stuff.\n\nI really love wicked! wish i could have seen it many times as well.\n\nYou could have an amazing intro that is like you.. but you do not need it! seriously!
Adore Wicked - I've seen it twice in London and I'm really tempted to see it again when the tour visits next year.  Will def be checking out Holly's new book!
That's me too! I feel like i need to get the souvenir programme everytime i watch a musical.... and then i don't actually know what to do with it....
You're videos seem to begin after the beginning. Like YouTube delays your video just a bit, but I can't tell how much\n Stop it or stop them. I want to see all of you and I mean that in every good way.
Where is the jumper you're wearing from? I love it!
The Big Sick made me cry too. Kumail Nanjiani who wrote it with his wife and stars in it is really talented and funny. You should follow him on twitter.
Are you planning on seeing It? Or maybe you're not into the horror genre? I think it has a very beautiful cinematography and it was a very good movie, that's why I'm curious :)
oh my gooood I saw the big sick on it's release day it's one of my fav films it's so so so so good, glad you liked it too!!!
Yesss, first aid kit! The new single is amazing.
I love watching these vids because some of these things I’ve heard of and some I haven’t, if I haven’t, then they become my favourites. Lol, plus I just love hannah❤️🙏🏼
i NEED to see Wicked again! i saw it a couple of years back and it was honestly incredible, so much better than i expected! love your vids Hannah!
So jelly! I've seen Wicked twice and it was my first theatre show that I saw live. I sat in the front row the first time and cried because of how excited I was. Needless to say, I love it. I would have loved to celebrate the 11th :)
I love Wicked so very much 💚
Was nice seeing you at Buffer Fest! :D
I think I will have ti buy Holly's book
You haven't seen IT
I know this is a weird video to comment on this but the quality of this vid is awesome! Like super HD
My friend read The Manifesto On How To Be Interesting by Holly, and then wrote a blog pretty much copying it? And I got so annoyed, like, I was all 'She's Hannah's friend you can't plagiarise her!'😂
Did you get a new camera? I can't really explain it, but you look more...real?
That Alice Underground theatre show sounds incredible! So sad I didn’t get a chance to take part!!
About a month ago I read the Manifesto on How to Be Interesting and loved it! It left me feeling personally affected. I didn't realise you knew Holly Bourne :) I'm happy now to have something to relate to!
how come there's no motion blur in this video? my eyes feel warped
Is it just me or does the video look slightly sped up?
I was wondering why this video seemed hyperreal.  And it was in 1080p50.  That explains everything.
OMG House of Cards AND First Aid Kit being mentioned in the same video 😍😍😍 First Aid Kit are amazingggg live
I've been enjoying starting university. So far it's just been a blur of lectures, training, eating and sleeping
Pls don’t rip the page out of the programme, it makes me a little uncomfortable thinking about it 😩
Tickets booked! A great 19th Birthday present to myself - I can't wait :D
i haven't watched the last season of house of cards just yet but holy fuck is that A Show™
Get one like the Drunk Advice intro!
I LOVE The Big Sick. One of the best pieces of film I've seen in awhile.
why is it in a higher frame rate this time? It looks odd to me
FIRST AID KIT ♥︎
Good 🎥 film
Love this narcissist 💋💋🌷
Dannah
First Aid Kit, ahhhh ❤❤
Omg I loooove Holly Bourne
Show off TV
Your amazing hannah! Great vids
I LOVE WICKED
Is the jumper Dodie yellow tho?
BYOI  it's audience participation Improv group,  renaissance  fairs,
You are gorgeous Hannah. :)
Hi
I. LOVE. WICKED.
Omg yes love First Aid Kit!
Robin wright is my BAE!
What time-ish will the event with Holly finish? Just wondering so I can book my train!
The idea of someone ripping out pages of a theatre Programme pains me. Lol
I love your rainbow book stacks
I'm I the only one distressed by the disorganised bookshelf???  :P
I'm seeing First Aid Kit next week for the first time! I'm so excited!
I'm a gardener, we call it the change. Thank you your up beat and happy perspective.
Genuinely interested- if I now comment that The Big Sick is not a Judd Apatow movie, but was directed by  Michael Showalter and writen by Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani (a.k.a. the leading actor and his wife), would that be considered a rude comment? I really want to know, because I am a big Kumail fan and am totally excited for the movie, and was just kind of sad to hear Hannah's mistake.
Holly was literally in my school today
Literally just found your account I’m 16 and wondering where I’ve been under what rock to not find you you’re amazing omg ❤️
HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU HAVE PER DAY TO READ AND WATCH ALL OF IT AND LIVE
Omg my friend played Alice in that play! What a small world 🙊
Aaah I had no idea Holly Bourne was releasing another book, I need to get it asap!
Omg southbank 😍😍
I now think insects are cool
What if all mosquitoes die ?
I just wish flys, wasp, roaches, and other bugs that have no use die
Mosquito's must be extinct
do how nukes can wipe out anything please
It didnt surprise me because we learned it in science class about pollinators and angiosperms
What are you talking about? keemstar can't die.
I am scared of cockroaches
I never thought of these little $@#%#@ insects. Generally you are a genius blogo !!!!!!🤐🤐🤐Speechless for you bro!!!!! I am also scared of cockroaches
Don't *bee* a jerk to bugs and insects. \n\n\nLike and you will have a bee so *bee* happy with it!
i kept checking the floor to make sure there are no roaches while watching this video... i still hate them
All insects should die except for bee's and butterfly's
dont forget that decomposers such as worms, flies, cockroaches and such help the soil being fertile. xD
I've learned more from these videos than my whole 6th grade year.
If cockroaches look like aliens does that mean you have seen an alien?!\n0-0
While watching this, spider fell into display\nI am still scared of insects omg
Bugs are annoying. The BUG me.\n\n\nSorry I'm so sorry
just remember the bee movie.
I have Katsaridaphobia,  irrational fear of roaches. This would be helpful for me.
also the bug lovers would lose their beloved pets and goodbye honey and beekeepers and cool shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
well i am starting to like bugs
For some reason I don't fear cockroaches..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*I hate the albino ones.*
I'm pretty sure that it would be best if all bugs died except for bees because they produce honey and also spread pollen. But please no hornets/wasps that would be a nightmare.
Cant we just mind control the bugs so we can still get food and not get attacked?
if insects suddenly died...then my lizard would have no food!
All insects except bees and butterflies should bee die.
Death
BUGS = ALIENS
What about antman? :(
*Ya like jazz?*
“I wish spiders would just all die”\n“But then other bugs would have a much higher population!”\n“So lets just kill all of the bugs”\nWhat happens next? Watch till the end of this video!
I am grossed out in cockroaches more than spiders...spiders help me troll someone xD
come on you apes do you want to live forever?
The origin of the word Mosquito actually mean useless so...
I don't care what the consequences are, I would push a button that made every insect go splat if I could. I hate insects with every molecule in my body, and I hate spiders even more. As long as I can survive, kill all the insects.
Well think about it like this, bad ones die and good ones stay to be amazing, likes bees and butterflies!
I freaking love insects. I’m one of those rare people who has hard time hating pretty much any kind of animal. Maybe I prefer some animals to others, (example, I love grasshoppers way more than ticks since being bit by them is terrible) but I can just never confidently say, “I hate this animal!”
Answer: we would all die as soon as i saw this title
Who knew they did that much.
WHAT IF WE KILL ALL THE COCKROACHES???? ONLY COCKROACHES
could you make a video about genetically modified crops ?\n\n\nplease.
Kill the ones that don’t help
he forgot that with out bees we would only survive for 4 years...
I still hate bugs XD\nI put hugs instead of bugs by mistake and it autocorrect it to bugs XD\nNot even autocorrect hates hugs
Let the Bees Live \nLet the Wasps Die\nLet the Butterflys Fly
If there is no bees we will not have honey
What would happen if all the bugs die?\nMe: Every game would never need a bug fix.

Okay… so can we just get rid of gnats and mosquitoes?
If by bugs we mean small invertebrates all together, without them our society would end. Just cause something isn't pretty doesn't mean it should go.
they are cool now
Just kill the harmful ones :D
i wonder what mosquitoes do to contribute to humanity
people being scared of bugs/insects is realy cringey to watch because they're so interesting and most of them are harmless
i'd rather spare bees and wasp
Just have force field that kills bugs within 10 yards of you
all we just need is just more useful bugs like bees and get rid of the digusting bugs like moths or cockroches
Don’t kill all bugs just the annoying and dangerous ones agreed
Just kill the mosquitos and flys and done
Remember when dinosaurs are extinct?  Well i hope that mosquitoes go extinct in 20 years
3:04 There's a mosquito in my room right now and I cant find it
My friend has a Cockroach 😖🤢
If every bug died we die as well finish you don't even need too watch the video all you have is a comment BOOM WIN WIN
The Life devs are working on removing the bugs.
If there was no such thing as a wasp, my life would be 100000000000000000x better
We would all die 15 minutes later
We would die if insects died
If insects dissipated, in 50 years everything on earth will die\n\n\n\n\nIf humans disappeared, in 50 years the earth will flourish
One we make fake bugs can we kill al da bugs?
I believe the Jews are similar to bugs so they might be cool.
I thought only bees sting. Don't wasps bite? Too lazy to google it.
On a forum a read a quote and it said 'when someone says he or she is an animal lover but says he or she hates bugs, they are hating 84% of all animals.
Sooo you're saying that getting rid of all bugs is BAD!!!!😶.And I'm still afraid of bugs.
If cockroaches, water bugs, mosquitoes and other bugs that people are mostly afraid of(including me) are gone, then we wont have to worry about bugs anymore.
I just want spiders and cockroaches out of this world
Does it includes Jollibee?

2:59 Incite = Insight
Plz no not spider man
Bugs aren't creepy.  Creeps are buggy!
I scared of cocroch soooooooooo much
kill all bugs except bees
1:36 sneaky, sneaky animators...
What about flies
nahhh just kill the flies and mosquitos and gnats
I've always loved insects
Love this channel
I hate bugs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO
Wait what\n0:10\nYour human world...\nHnmmm

social media doesn’t help with this in modern times. we need to understand a lot of thoughts aren’t put into words, and everyone has felt negative emotions. you are not alone.
I feel lonely and odd because I'm lonely and odd.
Easy summary of this video. We all have a public life, private life and secret life. Learn and study what separates them, how they work for others and for your self. This will be of great in understanding others and their behavior.
THIS IS THE VIDEO I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED 💖
Love this video. Thanks again School of Life
At 1:56-1:57 the black character has an erection.
This is the product of an extremely conceited and closed mind to not realize that the experiences and thoughts of others are even present and is rather superficial. If one if only able to see the outside of a person then that person lacks the basic empathy or at least the cognitive ability needed to understand the point of view of anyone who is not themselves. This video plays up the feeling that people believe that no one could possibly relate to them.
1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\n\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\n\n( Die Normalsten sind die kränkesten und die Kranken sind die gesündesten. )\n\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \n\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\n\n Well, isn't that good news??\n\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \n\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\n\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \n\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \n\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\n\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \n\n\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \n\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\n\n You are human beings nonetheless.\n As far as one can see\n Of the same species as myself \n\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\n\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!
Just moved into uni and was putting myself down because I'm not as good at socializing as my flatmates, but then I thought how far I've come, making friends with course mates and having long conversations with new people because a few years back I never would have been able to do that :') I feel a tad lonely, but I guess everyone else does at this stage as well
This animation art is wonderful !!! I am amazed !!!
I love seeing depressed people self loathe like total retards. I kinda pity them. Just to feel bad for themselves. It's edgy, retarded, and doesn't help depression.
These days i feel less lonely when i am around books , dogs and nature .Being in a group of people makes be extremely lonely ..i really dont like the shallow talks , selfies ,snapchat and gossiping about others .i especially vowed never to go to a dinner with somebody who uses phone all the time .
oh my god all of you are so stupid god loves us and the gays he even loved hitler for gods shakes i love snakes omg and 3 lol
needed this right now, thank you.
Poetry is the science of the awake unconscious speaking to the state of living.
Another reason we (or I) wear masks, is that I'm currently unable to articulate the person that I feel I am inside, so wearing a mask is easier. Sometimes the body lacks the precision to move and speak in the way I feel I truly am. It's not all down to anxiety.
Here's a video suggestion. Could you please do one about the obsession we have for our birthdays?
Please make a video about immature or childish thing :(
I don't know if this is a great idea or not. Sometimes I wonder if I throw my weight around online too much simply by offering suggestions (for content). Or, maybe I think I am more powerful than I actually am (because of my brilliant suggestions). It seems like, if not School of Life, then another place should do an episode on social statistics, and what they actually mean. I'm autistic, and I've read that autistic people usually end up trapped in working class-like situations, regardless of where we start. I look at that and think rather than I'm going to beat these statistics, I think Ahhh, I'm doomed! There's no way out! The good psychologist or sociologist asks why, and what causes a statistic to be. The good epistemologist asks a) Does knowing a statistic like this count as self-knowledge and b) Is it better to know this, or is it better not to know? It's The Meno Problem right?
School of life should do a literature video on Anthony Burgess/ F Scott Fitzgerald/ or like John Wyndham or HG Wells they've all got a form of literature with meaning
I just want to thank you for all the videos you do and the hardwork you put in them. I really enjoy them. Also, the essays you write , i read them when i wake up for school and they always get me thinking. Keep up the good work 💛

Don't waste your life and your purpose God has created you for, don't waste yourself for folly things that are pointless if it won't encourage you and bring you closer to Jesus and bring your faith to shine more, it is not worth it, Following Jesus is amen, He will comfort you and wipe your tears and remind you of his unfailing love for you, For He is your true father from above in the heavens amen, He is a Father to the fatherless, don't mess with them because if God hears their precious cries and tears then you will be destroyed, God is a judge for the widows, Don't mess with them because God will judge you and you'll be in great trouble, God is an Awesome and Fair God, God of Israel Amen.\n\nIf there's no love which is Jesus, Then people will error greatly and follow their own way and it may seem good outside and they may try to use history to back up their foolish imaginations, but inside them, it isn't the truth, neither is it good, And Good works will never be enough to enter into the Kingdom of God only through Lord Jesus Christ, who paid our debt and did it for us, You only have to believe and have Faith, not belief and your feelings those are entirely different from Faith and believing, having a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ who is God is the Good news and the Truth Amen.\n\nThere are sad people on this world that rather reject God and go after the world which is pointless and no hope for them unless they be willing to turn to the Father, Jesus can change a wicked sinner into a beautiful, clean saint, And how beautiful it is indeed, You won't learn from anything from this video neither anything else but from God's words alone, The Holy Bible King James Bible Amen, You have to take everything from God's words literally and ask for Jesus for Guidance and help in his words and you will see, You will understand that others will not because everyone is different and unique, Just like the stars God created for example, Each having names and each being very unique and beautiful, But for you, You are much more to God then the Stars, God of Israel Loves You Unconditionallay and you will always be important to God but if you continue to live in sin, Don't do it, Go any deeper and there will be no hope for you and there will be no way for you to come to repentance, But it is never too late right now while there is still time, Jesus is able to restore the soul and deliver everyone from falling, You only need to look deep into God's words and learn from him Amen.\n\nWhat will you do? Get up and get away from being comfortable to this world, Living for Jesus Christ is worth it Amen, There are greater things ahead that this world will never understand but only in Jesus alone, God knows your heart and there's no hiding anything from him, You can hide in a cave but that still won't hide yourself from him, It's a very very very terrible, Dreadful and terrifying experience to be standing against a Strong and Powerful Living God who created you and form you with a purpose, But how a great blessing and beautiful it is to stand with our True Father God who is Mighty and Strong, God can do the impossible and never doubt him, He's GOD OF THE LIVING! GOD OF ISRAEL AMEN.
I needed this right now, thanks for helping me feel better :)
Because you hang out in front of your computer all day!
I think you're wrong with this one, School of Life. Sometimes you just have to cope with realizing that you're odd. Sometimes trying to connect with people on a deeper level is great for realizing that their insides are different from what they portray externally, but it's also great for realizing that who they are internally is still very different from who you are internally. Sometimes you really are just odd and you have to embrace that.
Feedback: been subscribed for about two years now. I wish you guys would make more videos that feature actors or even real world scenarios. Actually I also loved your videos about the great philosophers... if there aren't any of them left to do then what about other notable artists or famous people like, I dunno... JFK, Martin Luther King or Lady Gaga.
Maybe you think you know yourself but your mama thinks she knows better but your psychiatrist says you're both wrong then the priest says nah you're all clueless...none knows the 100% truth so there is no such thing as you...or they ..just an idea
ever since I was a kid ppl thought I was a weirdo so I embrace that shit, makes life easier and much more fun when I can do whatever the fuck I want and ppl are like oh well that's just dynp being dynp also you're not fukkin alone. I'm a juggalo and I know there are a shit ton of weirdos out there JUST LIKE ME who like the same shit I do and don't give a fuck. whoop whoop!
I like the love illustration. Who did it?
Its why I think I'm alien to my own species. Most times I just feel like everyone is out for themselves and only need you when they want something.
art? not so sure abut that. especially with it being so subjective.
Loneliness is that feeling to be stranger; the fact is that we're all strangers to each other. We live between two worlds; the inside and the outside, if you focus in the one of the inside, you'll fall in anxiety, depression and anguish and if you just focus in one of the outside you'll lose your confidence in yourself and you fall in the same illness. The other is a book, be courageous and go to the library and chose a book. Open it and start reading. We're all strangers.
This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all. Neither has love.
Such as amazing Channel. They  never teach this in school. And if so , it feels to technical (Lack of feeling and association. Like robots). \n\nThis channel deserves more subs like 7 billion!
Please translate it to Arabic
You have got a very limited set of topics for your videos. I feel like i've watched this one already five times. Also I wonder how lonley and odd you feel Alain de Botton, and weather talking about it over and over again helps you with it. Hearing about it over and over again sure doesn't help me a lot.
This describes me too  well
I feel lonely because I lost all my friends when they left to different colleges.
This explains why I'm honest and blunt with my character.\nMy character helps people be more comfortable being themselves around me.
This video gives points that are completely subjective. How does this shit get on trending? Who did you pay?
I deeply and truly appreciate these videos and this narrator's work.
Can you do a Literature episode about Balzac?
I don't agree with this silly generational we are all ultimately the same, share the same experiences, the same thoughts and feelings. I talk to people lots and meet very few who have same or similar thoughts, feeling and experiences as me.
worship 1 GOD, \nVerily only with the remembrance of god do hearts find peace-Quran
What a coincidence. I just watched a video from SciShow Psych on a very similar feeling. They called it imposter syndrome. It's a feeling of inadequacy in successful people and thinking their success was only based on luck and that other people deserve more admiration than they do. I think you mentioned it at one point in the video.
Birth we come alone. Death we leave alone.
I AM NOT LONELY! I FEEL SO ATTACKED BY THIS
Another pretentious video. We feel odd because life is fucking strange it's that simple.
Because we have no God.
I will have to rewatch that several times to really get the idea behind this animation. For now I can tell, these are some beautiful illustrations!
I feel like you guys are rehashing your old stuff
no because of society
because we are odd and alone
This is so accurately and beautifully expressed
Hello friends, have a great day, love you
This is why reading introspective literature is so important! This is reading Kafka, ladies and gentleman! Then you can easily imagine what others in you life are going through and how they are in the inside, which is very much like yourself, which is very comforting.
Really? But I use mINS reading and individualism. I simply don't care what people think and expose my true self as much as possible.
the sketch was kinda depressing :/
man, I don't know how you choose your topics, but please keep up what you're doing.\none of the best channels on youtube.
I have spent 5 years listening to the inner reality of women's lives. http://www.collectingconversations.com Our stories may differ but we are very similar.
Truly beautiful animations! I loved when the lead character turned off the light to reveal everyone else’s deep, neon mysteries.
Life every day is happy or sad thats your life you should choose to take one of this in your life be successful and dont forget me
Is it ok to think that we should act fake so we don't put others down or bore them? I feel like we are our own individuals and that we can choose how we want to feel, but a lot of people do not think that way and expect others to entertain them or serve their interest the way they want.
I feel lonely because I decided to ditch my toxic friends and ex-partner. Now I'm too busy turning my life around studying uni via correspondence in the small rural town I live in to make friends with people I have nothing in common with. So for now, until I meet other people passionate about Science, I am lonely.
Moral of the video. Don’t care what people think because we all go through the same inner battle we try to fight
Well shit... looks like one of those solutions is hopeless for me... -_-
It's hard to make new friends when you have none because you forgot how.
Hi School of Life. Can you write an essay regarding gratification excesses found mostly on social media usage? And idenitfy newly adoptive practices of communication influenced by rapid tech advancements? Since you emphasize that well being is so important, I believe you ahould begin to study this behaviours.\nP.S Your videos always help me understand human weirdness. This is a positive thing, haha.
i’m so in love with this art
YES! I relate so much! Thanks SOL!!
For me it doesn't help that my parents have told me when I overreact or don't react normal/properly to simple things such as when I feel annoyance or sadness or hate. I once became so upset with a person because they tricked the teachers, lied multiple times a day, and yet they were proud of this and others did not seem to think badly of them. My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).
Reminds me of we judge others on their actions, and judge ourselves on our intentions
Uhhhhh I know I'm odd... I have sex with dogs... that's pretty disgusting in everyone else's view points... but I find that eating animals out of enjoyment is disgusting... I could never eat pork or pig... I do eat chicken but I always feel sad and guilty while eating it for needed nourishment to help my skin disease.. :(
ive learned i enjoy life a hell of a lot more on my own.  im happy being lonely!!
AALIYAH MADE THIS FROM BEYOUND THE GRAVE........
Thanks for Brazil Portuguese subtitles.
делайте пожалуйста русские субтитры!
BETTER THAN THERAPY
Last!

This was good!
True true true ...
Meditate!
Thank you.
i am a misanthrope😈
Lovely animation!
Beautiful.
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaasssseeeee subtitles in Spanisssshhhhh
TL;DW we're all eggs.
Is this tutsytut?
wow best video ever
As french people, this title does not mean anything... I guess you wanted to say Pourquoi nous nous sentons SEULS et étranges
I'm lonely cuz most people are retards.
we actually feel alone because God created us all out of himself, thus we are all apart of God. But at the beginning it was only him, and he was alone. So the loneliness you feel within is really only an echo of God's primal emotion at the beginning of time.
Jesus knows you completely and loves you unconditionally. Have a moment with Him and ask Him to live in your heart.
Dear School of Life,\nPlease stop stalking your subscribers, you are always uploading videos exactly when we need it to the point where it gets a little eery.
1:05 When will tSoL stop the sex obsession?? That is literally pornography!!
To be fair,  people you know could also know you better than yourself.

If SME would remove all of the lyric videos posted on YT, this post would have more than double the views and attention. So sad how the attention seekers capitalize on this precious amazing talent. That goes for you FanderWaalNews too.
Am I the only one wondering who it's about?
This song needs to be in a radio... :D
I wish this was uncut! Her voice without auto tune is so much better!

Beautiful and fun as always. :-) I love watching your makeup videos, but I don't have your gorgeous skin tone... Are there any pale-girl makeup tutorial artists you'd recommend?
Does anyone know the shade of the lip liner that she used?
it made me laugh when you said fear of textures i thought i was the only one!!! one time my mom accidentally left the iron board on a wood stand we had well i guess it wasn't real wood and it made this bubbly texture it freaked me out so bad and i was scared to look at it and i could never explain it. Thanks for explaining that.
pllleased try buying from saboskirt and do a review

3:33 I know exactly what you were thinking XD 20 and not all that mature in regards to those kinds of jokes.

Pleeeeeease don’t promote black. Up it’s a very racist company to simplify their disturbing origin.
Your face looks amazing! Really like this face combo!
the sort hair really suits you, you look beautiful
babe, zoeva 102 silk finish is brush for foundation, it gives really full coverage and blends out like beauy blender!!

I really enjoy shopping in Sephora, and I'm starting to use more of their own brand items
I'm 12 but SUPER dirty minded, I get what you mean
23 years in the house boo :*
Youuuu are golddddddddddddddd.  What color is that lip liner??
Patricia there's a three month old fyi ~
I saw someone else use that mask and I thought the same thing. 😂. It’s one reason I won’t be trying it.   I have a thing about certain textures or whatever.   I just cannot.
You look really different without makeup on. Not saying it's a bad thing as your pretty with or without makeup. It's just unusual how different you look. Your eyes especially.
Yassss so excited for the triple uploads!! Always need more Patricia in my life!!
Old enough to get the joke😩😂💕
You’re too much 😂😂😂 with your little mind 😂😂
Always beautiful whatever you wear, actually makes me want to start wearing make-up x
my fav brush is anastasia renaissance palette brush, it makes all that lines that you want, i never liked any palette brushes before that one
Anyone know What song is playing at the beginning?
I love how well u edit your videos
3:43 min “I’m a Christian” WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THE SAME OMG
I love the Sephora brand foundation-- it's about the only thing that doesn't freak my skin out, so if you have sensitive skin/combination, it is WONDERFUL.
Patricia I would like to ask you something in regards my personal experience, maybe you have had the same experience. I was wondering if there's private message on her thanks x
I usually don't buy stuff just because a youtuber made a video about it, but yesterday i bought the dr jart mask and the sephora cream lip stain in 26 after seeing this video.
New sub.....I love your personality........
I'm 17 so you can say everything you've got 😂

My only nitpick with the trailer is that the music was too loud to hear what the characters were saying, but other than that, awesome!
Fuck this stupid ass show and anybody who watches this
This is gonna be an awesome Halloween! #StrangerThings2
My body is ready...
ha ha what's score Mark?
Is it just me... or does eleven look like Juni Cortez in the thumbnail...
Best fucking trailer of all series
I am so goddam pumped for this
Can't wait!\n\n\n\n\nStill gonna have to cancel my subscription after I watch this since they increased their prices. It's just super inconvenient to have to pay $11 with $30 prepaid cards.
Hey I'm a german guitarist and produce covers in fingerstyle. My Videos are  in a high quality so it will be worth going to my channel. XD
Dude I can't get into this show, it's too strange even for my mind and seems all over the map, I don't get it.it's Tacky
what if the monster is barb
I know what's wrong \n\n\n\n\nwill got kidnapped by brendon urie
Looks like they've added some grit to this season
No I want more of Dustin😣💗💗
He still has that bat!\nhttps://goo.gl/Cwxmcp
So is that big monster-thing supposed to represent trump or something?
im so ready this is the best trailer im dead and dying
is it bad I cried while watching this lmao
OH PLEASE PLEASE no death, I love the whole cast it will get too emotional if someone dies but that’s the only way for the story to go on... This season will be emotional is all I know
I just want to hunt some monsters for the city I live in every time I watch the trailer
That theme song makes me feel so good inside
I'm glad i wasn't the only one who thought it was frodo in the thumbnail; Calm down Sam, we were fooled.
The one with the nails \n- Dustin Henderson 1984
Someone knows what music it is cause it sounds sooooo good ! Also this season looks amazing !!!
I just need Mike and Eleven going to the snowball
THE BAT IS BACK BITCHES
OH MY FUCKING GOD HAVE TO NETFLIX AND CHILL ALL FUCKING SEASON
Steve goes from Douche bag to kinda secondary hero in season one, season two he's like fucking Rudy from Monster Squad! FUCKING HYPE!
OMG I NEED MORE IM HYPED I CANT WAIT FOR ELEVEN TO COME BACK AND DID SHE OPEN MIKES DOOR?!?!
Steve is Jaime Lannister of Stranger Things
The hype is real !!!!!
So excited!! I'm curious also to see why Steve is hanging with the younger crew instead of Nancy and Jonathan - but either way seems like he's doing some cool proactive anti-upside-down stuff with the crew which is awesome
I'm going to rewatch season 1 just before I watch season 2
I DID NOT THINK IT COULD BE BETTER THAN THE THRILLER TRAILER BOY WAS I WRONG
I'm internally crying, this is amazing. How the fuck is even possible that I love all the characters? ALL OF THEM. There is no one I dislike, and that never happened to me in years of watching tv shows. I can't fucking wait to see season 2, Halloween is finally gonna be amazing here in Italy.
Course it's number 1 on trending lol
The mom is so fucking annoying
Gotta watch the whole first season again to understand everything
Steve is my spirit animal
What if it's 2 Stranger Things?
Bruh y'all kno 11 bout to go the fuck off this time I'm so hyped

Halo!:)
Already searching a excuse because he is scared to lose, pussy
Your just trying to get out of it
Apparently its the different lighting on the trainers, that makes then different colours, they are actually pink and white but the photo some see as blue and grey is taken with the flasg on. I see blue and grey like you though x
JOE YOU ARE A BEAST
You are not bad but I prefer KSI.
You're a dickhead for going through KSI's stuff. Go watch his recent, you're a complete utter failure.
I see grey and green shoes
Bs ur just to pussy 🐱 u called him pussy 🖕🏼
For some reason, with in the other photo I saw them as pink and white but on this one I see them as green and grey
Only retarded people see pink.
I see grey and white
Pussy u making this bs up just so u don’t have to fight kill yourself u fucking square head prick
Am I the only one who thinks this fight is stupid
I see green and grey but both of my sisters see pink and white. Im literally just like how?!!!
didn’t even sound like mcgregor
if you turn the intensity on your phone to invert colours in settings then the trainers go pink and white 💛😁
ITS PINK AND WHITE
Is this a setup or does he really intend to beat KSI.. If he's serious then he's earned a sub. I can't stand KSI.. Or his brother.
I hate you Joe Weller I can't wait till ksi beats you up haha haha :-)
Conor is my uncle that's not Conor's voice
Come out retarded the fuck
it's pink and white
some one watch me as well
Compensating for his  Why I lost excuses already?
That phone call was not stage at all
Even though you'll never see this and it's old news, I just wanted to say thank you for standing up for everyone who's in the boat we're in with depression. JJ isn't the person we all looked up to, and now you're an idol. It's nice to see someone who's famous but still has good morals and stands up for what's right.
Be careful my sister fractured her knee in two places and didn't realise she now has CRPS XX
Why does everyone hate on joe, hes broke his knee but hes not pussying out tho hes getting over it and fighting ksi. KSI going to get droppedddd!
I want to punch you in your obnoxious face cunt
I see them as grey and green
Fuck you go kill you do we will be soo happy
so if u lose i bet u will blame your knee
I see green and gray
Is there any way you can block pointless nobody's like this. Please tell me I can avoid them. I stopped watching tv to avoid Eastenders and anything close to that bullshit now I have popular weak boy on my feed with a had knee he sustained from watching How to meet Gary Barlow videos. Sort it out it's fucking awful
Light Blue and grey
That's Al Foran not Conor
The whole shoe thing is mental because 2 days ago they were pink and white for me now there blue and grey wtf!!!
This is Max 🐢 he has no Friends \n1 like=1 friend\n1 comment 10 Friends \n10 likes 100 Friends
Light blue and gray shoes
the conor mcgregor call is actually real...u can hear how he prounounces any word with r
lol he getting scared, trying to back out XD, PUSSY
Pretty sure that was Al Foran on the phone impersonating Conor
Hope you get better soon, Joe! Really hope this fight still happens!
I believe in #TeamWeller keep on being the best Joe,you will beat KSI bro
Why does his mum look like a fried egg ?
You are the stronger component Joe. Now let's put you back together.
Green and gray

Say what you want about JJ, but at least he isn't making excuses about the fight. Just a fall back in case you lose.
Go ahead you leftist losers . Keep blaming trump for every single thing bad, that happens in America . Thats surely gonna solve the problems you have in the society you live in .
Harvey Weinstien ejaculated into a potted plant? Someone needs to tell him that's the wrong way to seed a plant.
And liberals believe this?
Sexual assaults, pedophiles, silenced victims. Keep these crimes exposed, and then maybe, there will be enough bipartisan outrage to remove the sick offender. Start with www.justiceforkatie.com
Yes!! I love u Seth Meyer! So true !
There's no 'systemic sexism' - at least not against women. If you want actual 'systemic sexism', look at the justice system.
Stop allowing liberal propaganda to trend, youtube. It's obvious and pathetic.
«A woman enjoys intercourse with her man - as she fantasizes being raped by 3 men simultaneously.» (c) Bernie Sanders
Thank you, Seth. Compact, apt, biting, and unutterably sad that it's needed. Keep at it. Trumpie's lashed out even more, just now, defiant. Unrepentant. Unforgivable.
I am going to laugh so fucking hard if he gets re-elected in 2020.
lol toxic male culture... How about Crypto Talmudic Jews and others.. in all the Media and Hollywood protecting and procuring all of this... nah can't be them.. I must be a Anti Semite... gotta be toxic male masculinity....

All late night tv is so hypocritical! Seth would never make it in prison with a big mouth and scrawny figure. Dork, is the perfect description. I wanna put Him in the head lock and make Him say uncle. It's trendy to make jokes on Trump. Get creative and move on. Fueling the fire.
i dont believe this like/dislike ratio for a second
Seth, must everything be about President Trump?  Your show is terrible. What did you talk about before Trump took over? You had to have been 'Weinsteined' to get this gig you excruciatingly boring loser!
I'm going to be careful on what I say, cause I think I can't attack you, with the intent, for you to stop attacking me (that would be hypocritical) so I'm just going to love you even if you don't stop. But please stop.
I cant believe i actually used to watch this show... i want my time and money back
Donald is a legend in his own mind.
Of course YouTube would have this trending,Should add Bill Clinton while your at it,Democrats just hold this L
Of course, we just had to turn it into a anti-Trump thing.
its gonna be so dope and ya everybody can u report a account named litonerflat on insta he says seth meyers is for kids
this guy is retarded, how is this trending?
My farts smell like this video., GREAT!
If only scientists could find a way to power the world using all the butt-hurt that Trump supporters in the comment section are feeling we could solve global warming tomorrow.
Stopped it 34 seconds in. Another misogynistic apologist. Trump talked locker room talk, but Wein(er)stein actually is a rapist. Instead of focusing on the rapist... You decide to show how butthurt you still are about President Trump winning the election. I don't watch you...ever.
Americans really are super brainwashed both left and right. This has nothing to do with the video or anything just something that comes to my mind when ever I read comments from both sides. Like you need politics to tell you everything about you. It's as fake as horoscopy or anything of the like. Americans don't know about the world fight on emotions and fight evils that don't exist in the way they think not completely false but not the way they think while ignoring real evils that exist in their society
I hope seth reads these comments😂
Before reading the comments:\nHealthy 24 year old\nAfter reading the comments:\n24 year old with cancer
hollywood is full of pedophiles and rapists.
What is that Fraud Gorka still doing in the news?\nWasn't he kicked out of the WH months ago??
I love when the left conveniently forgets about Bill Clinton.
So let me wrap my head around this. Raping woman, sexually harassing them, demanding they massage you, blow you, screw you or watch you rub me out or all 4 or else they are finished and will never work again. That is equivalent or worse than a comment said never done. I see. Interesting
Wait...was I suppose to find this entertaining or funny? If so, you miserably failed
This guy is just another part of the pedo rapist Hollywood. Trending is false advertisement. It should be labeled top paid propaganda
This was the best closer look I have watched. Not only funny but nailed some difficult topics seriously and with respect and consideration. Well done to Seth and his team
Get off donald trumps dick people.don't attack me with straight white male shit.I'm asian nd still support  him.
Faucets? Really? Is that what Americans actually call a tap? A Faucet? Well that was unexpected
Difference is winesteine did those dirty stuff trump said dirty stuff doing and saying are different and Seth Meyers only says says stuff negative stuff of president for ratings Seth is a sad sad man
Seth Myers your channel gets less hits than Tanner Braungardt lmfao. Cable is dead. Seth is out of touch. SAD!!
this is how bs late night has become even a Harvey story is about Trump bs
Holy Slandering Trump Batman does this clown... I mean Joker have any other material than blah blah blah Trump is a poopyhead ... blah blah blah ... LOL.... blah blah I disagree with Trump so you should too or you are also poopyhead.
All you white liberal hosted late night talk show fans how does it feel to be aligned politically with a self admitted nazi collaborator? How does it feel to be aligned with a bunch of overpaid weirdo pervert celebrities? How does it feel to be aligned with every little privileged college kid that's been taught there is only one way to think and diversity of opinion and open dialogue is to be frowned upon? How does it feel to get all your news and information from comedians and bought and paid for, entirely partisan news sources and every single monopolized media outlet with the same political agenda? How does it make you feel that your sources of information leave so much of what you have the right to know on the table? How does it feel to be full of double standards? How does it feel?
All of you are slaves to an masonry satanic cult of group think. You religious viewer of late night -propagandists- tv hosts are the reason the western world is on the edge of collapse.  Read a book, stop watching these modern day jesters juggle.
It is not the federal governments job to save every city during natural disaster. The government is to big and people expect to much Puerto Rico is filled with tourism crime corruption and its the local governments job to help and lift people up.
FAKE TRENDING LIST to go with the FAKE Comedy.
*honestly it's depressing what our country has become.. nobody can get along anymore. people hate eachother because of their political views or their sexuality. i have yet to discover my political views, but i know once i discover it, it doesn't matter if my friends and family don't agree with me (politically), they will still love me because they're good people who can see past it.*\n\n\n*I know this single comment won't change anything but can't we all just get along??*
The left can't meme
Seth who? He has a tv show? Say wha?
You leftists will do whatever takes to slander Trump won't you?
The right is the one who is exploiting this? Then wtf are you doing?
Latest News: Hillary Clinton calls Trump 'sexual assaulter' in BBC interview, but says Bill's behavior 'in the pa\nhttps://goo.gl/aZacZ6
Why so much hate on trump yet he became the president? \nNB: I don't live in the US
Doesn't the press have freedom of speech? Oh I forgot that trump doesnt know the amendments
Who can watch this everyday????
Losers and fake media don't bullshit no more.
I do not expect a reply, and will not read responses, but I am just puzzled that this is just coming out now when one considers this long history of Weinstein 's abuses.
Fucking yuppies. Get a friggin hobby.
This is funny?

Hollyweird is full of harvey  jewsteins.
Fire Seth
Seth is a sick gay moron
Guys fTd. Go watch my video
Seth said it! BRAVO!
haha hEY GUYS LOOK WHO YOUTUBE PUT ON TRENDING TODAY
American humour is so stale, jesus.
Ladies and gentleman, this is what YouTube hopes their future looks like.\nIndependent content creators? Free speech? Questioning establishments narratives? Nope, just an extension of MSM and all the bullshit that goes along with it.
*So many snowflakes in the comments*
Why did MGM big wigs sell right before the shooting? 250mil. Also, is Harvey close friends with Trump or Hillary? Seth, you are a puppet and will crash and burn, you know it.
Did...\n\nDid you just tell me I need to apologize for, and feel guilty for the misogyny of others?...\n\nDude...
Weinstein is a liberal Jew. You're not going to pawn him off on Trump and the right. Get fucked. He's one of yours.
*Facepalm* what an asshat. Glad there is new comedy that doesn't spread lies on youtube.
>male privilege\nBullshit, never had anyone hand me anything for just being a man. I have to go to school to pay bills and feed myself. Nobody is getting me any special clubs or scholarships for being a man studying engineering. Now if I were a woman, they have the dedicated SWE (Society of Women's Engineers) and over 4 times more scholarships available in my region.\n\n>women are socially disadvantaged\nMight be true in some cases, same goes for women. Both men and women have different roles to fill, and opinions of one another.\n\nGoddamn Late Night is fucking brainwashed agenda, just urges me to make comments when I see this trash trending.
Seth, you're a desperate, lefty, moron. You're the definition of left-wing bias. Also, the Weinstein stuff is about a bad guy with power and the liberal/leftists who protected his position; not the boogieman (Patriarchy). Women can be just as evil as men. ... You're​ just so wrong at so many levels; but I agree with you that bad things, like actual sexual assault, are bad. Most of who and what you blame for the bad stuff are just so~ dumb. I don't want to write a book down here in the comment section, so that's where I'll leave it.
A major Dem donor got busted raping actresses let us try and get some blame on Trump.
Seth meyers is a fucking coward. He refuses to follow the rules of democracy by hiding behind his camera. Theres nothing funny about leftist brainwashing and anyone who watches and enjoys this watches only because they want to feel good about their opinions. Please act like a human being
Ask Seth about how a black girl claimed he forced her to strip naked at a rush party in the Phi Gamma Delta house when he was a sophomore at Northwestern University.\nFucking hypocrite!!  I hope he is next to be exposed.
hes so woke!!!!
Dafuq. Is this trending??
Yeah, conveniently forget Bill Clinton
Upvote this comment if you love women and don't want to see them molested and disrespected
You say Trump isn't qualified to be president but what I want to know is how are you qualified to be a comedian?
I’m a liberal and I want to throw up when I hear all the ultra liberal crap about “toxic masculinity” and “male entitlement” and all this other crap.\n\nNO. Weinstein was a man who was a gatekeeper of something everybody wanted and nobody had to offer. Stardom. And so he used that power to get what he wanted. It has NOTHING to do with him being a man. It has to do with him having power. The same power that women want and the same power that they use in the same way when they have it.\n\nWomen aren’t some benevolent heavenly gender that are so far above men. Women do the exact same crappy stuff men do the second they have the chance.
This is not funny anymore it's over used
Well this video officially makes me hate Seth :/ unbelievable how much disrespect can be thrown to a president of the United States
Wait, isn't Bill Clinton the rapist pedophile, and Hillary CLinton the one that befriends Weinstein?  \nLOL Hollywood, I love how you project your own shittiness onto someone else.  \n\nSeth Meyers:  You, Jon Stewart, Noah Trevor, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden are a curse upon this country.
Seth Meyers blows - most unfunny late night host ever...
Pathetic shill for the corrupt Hollywood elite. We know you're fraud. You liberal sellouts are losing and it's only going to get worse
U fucktard Trump Suckers cant really find issue with the content making dumbass generalisations
Everyone has demons.
Arya & Sansa are both in X:Men movies now? Sign me up!
Where's the good X men
Looks a lot like LEGION. People should watch it its amazing.
that is going to be so f**king stupid!  what a way to ruin a great comic!
Saw this trailer like 7 times. X-Men and horror are instant nerdgasm.
Jump scare movie that is not scary
Was not expecting that lol
looks like fox is back on track and has found the formula\nnice to see sth different
Woah, why am I watching American Horror Story 2.0?
despite the choice of music being super cheesy, this already looks better than any of the Marvel Studios movies
Why bring in the MCU to this? I enjoy the MCU and the X-Men franchise. No need to have these two franchises hit on one another.
I'm so hyped. This has everything I love: horror vibe, out of control scary abilities, an asylum, a witch, a girl that can make your worst fears come to life, and a blood thirsty werewolf. I hope they put in demons that Magik can release. I'm more hyped for this than any other movie except for infinity war and Deadpool 2 and btw this is connected to Deadpool.
Where are you Quentin...
Is this some sort of official spin off? Or the origin story of a powerful telepathic mutant that has to conquer their demons?
Queen of the south, game of thrones, stranger things yah I watch a lot of tv
why did they make an action movie into horror?
A new trailer for Stranger Things sequel. Nice!
It's that dude from 10 Cloverfield Lane
Not what i was expecting at all but sure, ill watch it
I thought this was a new X-Men movie
I was really hoping it would pick up with laura and those new mutants after logan :/
When is this set in the timeline
This doesn't look scary am sorry
Spoiler Alert!!! They're stuck in Legion's mind
Oh no marvel what have you done
I thought this was a new x men movie. I was wrong
It looks good but I just don't get the whole horror aspect like don't they have superpowers
its gonna be so dope and ya everybody can u report a account named litonerflat on insta he says movie\n is for kids
I thought this was X-Men
Never wouldv'e expected the film to take a horror route, but I'm keen for the take on it. Anything different from the same old stuff is welcome at this point.
I don’t get it are we watching  a movie trailer or another garbage Marvel b rated short movie/tvshow that just goes to Netflix... I mean I absolutely love Marvel but the tv shows need to step it up
This Movie Makes Me Wanna \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive A Cup Of Bleach To My Dog
Weird to see X-Men go full horror
Im so hyped, especially because  both charlie Heaton and maisie williams are starring in it
Well here we go again with yet another movie where Mystique makes an appearance. Just wait for it.
When  X-Men and Conjuring got married they had a baby called        New Mutants.
Does not feel like a marvel movie looks like a M Night Shamanuts film.
I'm interested! I just hope it doesn't have a lot of jump scares, there's a few in just the trailer, and they get really bland, really fast.
hey....isn't there the hot guy from stranger things??
Thumbs up for Jonathan (Stranger Things) and Arya (GOT) 👍🏻
All that's missing is Freddy Krueger.
this movie would look good on a iphone X >>109268.iphonexfree.net<<
looks kinda cheap, but i have high hopes for this
would have been surprising if he found clean laundry in the machine.....this looks so banal
It's more looks like horror movie rather than hero movie
Some mix of American horror story and legion type movie
This... This actually looks pretty good.
Marvel is trying way too hard..to bad my negus at DC finna take over the globe when aqua man drops in December or 2018. We are on a new level and a new era is coming. Get widdit o get lost
OHHH. So it is X-men in the horror genre??
HEY! Teacher! Leave that mutant alone!
It comes out on Homestuck day.
I don't know how I feel about this \nOn one hand IT'S THE NEW MUTANTS I have been waiting years for them to make a movie out of this and the trailer does not disappoint me with only a few minor details\nOn the other hand I was not expecting them to take an asylum setting \nI immediately recognized each of the mutants even they young illyana but I don't see karma in the trailer but I saw Dani Rahne Sam illyana and Roberto
omfg I thought this was mutant teenage ninja turtles
is this a marvel film or what?
wayy too late/early for halloween by the time this movie comes out
More horror then I thought
who knew Marvel could create a horror film? i thought they only created comics and movie comics! you're tellinh me that marvel has a horror superhero comic?!
Looks as if you slapped the X-Men branding on to Stranger Things and called it a movie
Low key thought this trailer was about a new x men movie
i thought this was going to be something about xmen
Wat? Wat is this? This no X-Men! Nonononononooo you've got it all wrong this, this is American horror story: hospital
Ok so is this a horror movie or a comic book super hero movie?
Well, looks like a horror flick more than a Mutant flick, but it's an early trailer, so who knows. I know what I expect as a reader in the 80s and I hope Fox maintains some level of continuity. Logan was done reasonably well and, while they actually ahd minimal interaction, Deadpool was amazing. But...then I reflect on those other movies such as X-men, Xmen Apocalypse...and I have to say that Fox has had minimal luck, as it's own entity, with bringing Super Heroes to the screen. Have high hopes :)
What the OST of this movie ?
This is the first time a Marvel trailer actually gave me the willies.
i dont know how to feel about this
Stop using Pink Floyd music for this pls
So what does this have to do with The New Mutants?
This trailer rocks!! I wish Thor Ragnarok was done like this instead of being extremely lighthearted and comical. I'm definitely looking forward to this baby! 😃👏❤️
I thought this was another X-men movie
I warned you about including the Hellions bro!!!!\n\nI told you dog
I'm ready.
Trending is fixed
BRUUUUUUUUUUUH. I'M HYPED
X-Men: Asylum?
American Horror Story-Hospital returns April 13th 2018....Stay tuned
http://FixMonthlyincome.Com/?refer=55550

CHARLIE HEATON GAJDHANSB
We want R , we want R
WOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU  AMAZING  WOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

HEY \n\nTEACHER\n\nLEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE

¿What is this?
Marvel and horror
Looks lame
http://bit.ly/2wJ3aNN
ummmmmmm
Rights wps kr do chutiyo ....
LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE
Cool!
Wait... Marvel made a horror movie ?  WHAAAAAAAAAAAAADAFUQ
LIKE si hablas español
Just give back the X-Men rights to Marvel Studios already!!!
Why this look like a horror movie?
Looks like majority of people in the comments aren't liking it.  Is there anyone here who likes the trailer? Sure, it's not the best trailer, but it does make me want to know more by waiting for a second one.
I really hope this is just horror themed because of Halloween. AFAIK the only horror related New Mutants characters are Magic and Wolfsbane...
UMMM??.......WHERES ROBERTO???........WHERES SUNSPOT???....
You gotta get my man Khalid on this
Who knew Luke Evans had pipes like that!?!
Not to bring something unarevelavent but um shows a clip of BTS jungkook, Jin, jimin, and V cough cough they sing good asf and are the hottest but it's not about who's the hottest but who has the talent 😂😂😂😂😍😍😍😍
Luke Evans was singing with his nostrils
Brendon Urie isn't here. This is a travesty!
does anyone actually like usher? the answer is no right?
clearly the actor is the winner here!he had the most sensual n emotional voice :D
Luke Evans voice is beautiful, even when he’s just talking!
Wearing sunglasses indoors makes you look like a fool
Usher is the winner. Ugh am missing his music so much 😍😍😍
I'm about to show Luke what love is... ox
they must have rehearsed very hard for this
Hoping a drop the mic segment w/ john cena
that luke guy is a dork ... i never even heard of him.
i think we've found the next big boy band XDDDDD
I was waiting for Justin Timberlake with 'sexyback'
Was I the only one that thought he meant Philharmonic orchestra 😅😂 but these guys are awesome
Before I looked at the title I thought it was Simon cowell
Why is he sexy cus he is white
Chris Brown should've been there instead of Billy bryan
I can't look at a Supreme t-shirt without thinking of idubbbz now...
Russ would have one hands down!! Get him on your show James!!!
Luke Evans is such a babe 😍😍
What is the little thing the guy on the left is holding at 6:00?
Luke's butt tho. His butt is perfection
Wow I did not see Luke Evans being able sing like that.
Bisexual Herpes Usher Trying To Keep His Name Alive
Usher won....  but Gaston is good....  James is funny!!!!
One of the three Musketeers can sing. 😍😍😍❤️️❤️️❤️️
Is all that stuff true about Usher?  I just want to get some clear that if u don't ask him if he really does have that disease  or watevr cause u just can't tell if he really does have it just by looking at him.
I’m actually do impressed with James. He’s gotten sooo good with his vocals
usher’s voice tho so fuckn smooth and beautiful 😍💯
Luke Evans was an amazing Gaston
Speaking of sexy, sensual, there's this vibe I get from hearing George Michael singing Careless Whisper. Probably romance and mystique, yet sentiment..?
Whats sonng is luke singing i like it
bravo to Luke for actually belting and not doing all the falsetto nonsense we hear in pop music (minus Bruno Mars)
ummm not its not even sexy
Uh.... I spoke too soon, why? Cause then there was... LUKE EVANS? This guy can sing? What?!?
Ushers mike is filled with who knows what stds
All I cared about was the middle boy harmonizing 😍
Luke *Killed* it!! I adore him
Fuck. Why can’t Luke Evans be straight. His voice is so damn sexy!!!😍😭😛🤤
The first time he ever lost a riff off battle ;)
Didn’t Usher give a bunch of women crabs?
ok Joe it's time to turn me on.  never mind that idiot
Sorry but Bruno Mars will always win this category without even competing
Who would take James,  to get usher and Luke Evans?
Luke can talk and be sexy. Luke can stand there and be sexy. 😋
OMG I totally loved the end of this when they're all together! We love Usher here in Chattanooga!! He grew up here!
Damn! That Luke Evans never fails to bring the fire. That's one fine ass (cough, emphasis on ass, cough) bruv!
He can sing!? \nJesus everyone's wet ....
As far as performances:\n\nUsher beats both\n\nRandom dude is average at best\n\nHost is less than average
It makes me sad that Luke Evans is gay, because he's really hot. 😍😢
No one sings like Gaston 😍😍😍
Why don't you bring in the Why don't we boys?? They're super cool too👌💖
I don't think Neil Patrick Harris would agree 😂
Update: Luke was okay. Not bad. Still don't recognize him.
Want to enjoy this.. after reading the news all I can think about during this clip is usher giving herpes to a host of individuals..
That was the best ending to one of these riff offs ever 😩😍
Get his supreme cool ass
Gaston's back!
Zayn sounds sexy..and is totally sexy too.. 💖💖💖
Damn Luke!
Luke Evans wins. Duh. lol
Luke Evans. Wooow so gorgeous!!
HERPES!
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn, Luke Evans.
😍 Luke Evans!!!
James corden kinda of looks like Chris Farley

Man supreme is everywhere.

Love this...
Fuck Luke Evans makes me bussy wet
when usher's poking james corden's belly hahahahahaha
esperando el momento para que james, usher, luke y los chicos anuncien su gira mundial!!
I didn't care about anything but ushers shirt
Luke Evans even made usher fall in love with him!!! 😍😍 8:54
Usher has a STD
Luke Evans must have a rough life, he looks 50+ but he is 38 o0. Usher is also 38 but, looks younger like late 20's.
James is a fat faggot.
Omg I was sure that usher was the best but Luke start singing and OMG, I'm in love with him now😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 🔥🔥🔥🙊🙊🙊😊😊😊😘😘😘
That is not Eminem! Look at his eyes! Its a clone from him maybe.
Diqqa thats weird. He is to old for rap or freestyle or hip hop now.
Im reading most these comments and your all expecting some fire bars or a track ,he trying to convey a message which clearly means something ... yall to stupid to see that
Everyones knocking the delivery thats great and all i get it the flow isnt their but hes doing it angry NOT clear headed.. Some of u need to watch the news to know what hes talking about... Hes about to start world war 3 and some of you are still like  yay trump.... Idiots.... Its the lyrics not the delivery stop tryin to lip sync n rap to everything that plays off ur phone n focus on whats being said maybe u would understand more then just music but world issues as well... Hes 100% correct about all the issues he spoke of... Rest of u stop hoping theirs gunna be some catchy beat u can shake ur ass to and LISTEN
Lame. Total sell out. Never buy another album from this has been.
Yep I'm against Eminem you white trash.............do nothing bitch .......go back to your white trash supporters and your brothas in the kkk............
is this a parody of what he thinks a political song should be?
This shit sucks. I always wanted to rap like Eminem. Now I can.
Everybody WHO Said Thats cringy have no mention about Music.. it Is es FREESTYLE... without a beat. This is for everybody who said that: make it better!
What a kiss ass. always was
power to the people, F the taxes get on the Bitcoin and be free - https://bethefirst.usi-tech.info/ cut that middle man!!!
Oh, look! Some aging celebrity trash-talking Trump!!! Way to be a pioneer!
who gone drop the lyrics?
Hey Marshall that shit you spewing ain't hip hop\nYour lyrics are dryer than Gandhi's flip flop
Marshall Mathers your a coward. I hope this really hurts you.
Eminem\nLost\nThe\nPlot
everyone who dislike this is for Trump.
And Eminem proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Orange is definitely The New Black.\n\n\nRacist much, Marshall.
Why am I here? I don't even watch BET. Gave that shit up years and years ago. \n\nI'm out.
Damn We got Eminem spitting than snoop dog crying, than NFL Twitter where da faq is U.S.A @ FYI all you new Ex Eminem fans have to call him Marshall now
Who is eminem in 2017? Seriously.
Give Obama props? For what? Leaving American tax payers a $20 trillion national debt? Invading and destroying more countries than any other US president? Killing more civilians in drone strikes and bombing campaigns than any other president? Deporting more immigrants than any other president?\n\nHas Eminem got a contract with CNN now?
loved u once. now ur just an sjw dickhead
YES! THATS RIGHT....    HE GOT IT!  BIG SHOT 2 EMINEM
DIVIDE ET IMPERA - start thinking and just listen\nObama, Trump - the other sides of same corrupted system\nBoth supporters are right, busy fighting with each other,\nOh mother - they help to introduce a New World Order\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-yVx8_syjs
Watching all these people comment this is trash and shit because they don't understand the meaning behind the words
EMINEM FOR PRESIDENT SAY I DO
What a boring video, I did hope to hear a new nice music clip from him :(
I want to see Eminem rap about M&m's
He disappears and when he comes back he disses the POTUS?! He just wants attention and what better place to do it than on BET
Is this even MM it doesnt even sound or look like him? It just shows people that are SJW are just bitching over everything now a days!
That was some of the Worst, Crappiest, and SLOWLY spoken Nursery rhymes I have ever heard ! LOLOL Vanilla Ice is better. OMG
Man this fool sucks. I can't believe this is the best em had. Guess he needed something to sell his album.
Dont want to make this about color but when white rappers flow like this they are untouchable
A clear explanation that Eminem's days are over.
*so what next hip hop be like? No music even not saying shit just moving hands and body?*
Will the real Slim Shady please come back? Cause this shit is just stupid!
Why do liberals hate being white?
yo em get back on the drugs
I thought this was an SNL skit at first. Lmao
Im on your side of sand.
You're the best 😍❤ everthing's so true. Please someone just punch Trump in his dumb orange face
so full of it i can smell it from here. draw your line in the sand ass hat.
I have no idea what he is  talking about is this a rap or rant?
this is not Eminem anymore 😢
He lost his touch
Wow saying the same regurgitating things everyone else has said that's been false.\n\nThis i hate trump cuz raisins Bandwagon is getting ridiculous....
umm looks like eminem is on the pension and old as faaark
This is what happens when you have an uncontrollable ego! You think that your shit don't stink and that you make sense to everyone.
3:59\nTill the end ....\nI stg, i got goose bumps bro !!!!!!!!!!
Trump is mother fu*ker ... i want him to DIE!! ❤🌸
Do not think, just listen
everyone in the comments is trashtalkin that NOW talentless Wigger, yet he somehow hast 900k likes and only 150k dislikes
Crazy. BETNetworks, an anti-white racist organization is on the 'trending page'.
Liberals are supporting him just because he is bashing Trump, not because it is good at all. I still haven't seen a single valid argument, fact presented, or debate entered into by a liberal. They just hate without reasons or logic. Please try to challenge your opinions in an actual discussion rather than assuming you are right. You will keep losing and Trump will keep winning... Your lives will continue to fall apart while we grow stronger... I love my enemies and i want you succeed and be happy. Please go towards learning and away from emotion.
Omg no one have the balls to say this, eminem is a genius\nI love Eminem, Trump Sucks \nLike if you agree
he is a god a rapgod
F☆ck yeah I hate Trump.. what a Idiot he is.
*TRIGGERED*
What an angry little commie pislamic wigger bitch.
BLÁ BLÁ BLÁ BLÁ.... Bullshit!!!! 😛😜
This Cypher wasn't good

Loser!!!!
Gay!!!
LOL xD nothing makes sence
Eminem, definitely not afraid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkC1Bohf2Vw
This is just dumb it he obviously has no clue at all what he’s talking about. Just another brainwashed Hollywood celebrity trying to get involved in politics even though he has no idea what he’s talking about
This sounds like a mental patient
This is like something I would have written when I was 20, thinking I could be a rapper.
Complain all you want... \nHis vid got more LIKES than \nDISLIKES 😂😂 \nTrump that Trump ✌\nGo Emm 🔥
It sickens me to read all uninformed comments about how bad this is,  from you ignorant fools.\nThis is clearly freestyle and Eminem is stating facts, from what is already been said before several times.\nBut again let me see you try do it better, no? So shut up and walk.
Trump is Killing us softly and at least Em is other celeb are speaking the truth.  Fuk that puto trump
Trump supporters = disgusting nazis
Trump is a peace of SHIT ! ! ! ! ! !
Look at all the stupid ass trump supporters and Russian infiltrators acting like trump supporters. You motherfuckers know this shit is FIRE!!!
Look at that like to dislike ratio. Looks like the majority of America stands with Eminem. Get wrecked Trump bitches.
This is why the electoral college chooses the president. You can't go and trust a huge number of morons to decide who's gonna be running shit.
Politics has to kill everything I like doesn't it. The only thing politics doesn't kill that I like is politics itself and that's debatable to whether or not it's killing itself.
Trump is our hope
Yessir Eminem

Its the SHARING of eiffel tower pictures thats illegal not just taking the picture at night, authorities just dont like it.... Get facts right before making a clickbait video
Ah, thank you for shining a light on the situation. Heh. Light.
*_Because Effiel Tower Looks Like A BIG TALL CO*K_*
Do quote someone: Well, that's retarded..
I'm French and in Paris you can buy reproductions (postcards, framed pictures...) of the Eiffel Tower at night everywhere. As said at the end of the video, this law has never been enforced. So don't worry you can take and use representations of the Eiffel Tower.
Ok Google, show me pictures of the Eiffel Tower at night\n*Authorities are on the way, please stay where you are and remain calm, thank you for your cooperation*
Lol you seen Logan Paul ? He recorded the tower at night time :)
Damn the person who made this is a bitch LOL
I believe the way copyright laws are being handled is the true cause of cancer.
Not really... Its not really that serious.. You can definitely show a picture of the Paris skyline... Nobodies gonna come after you.. Its like the law in arizona where you can only have 1 dildo in a house.. Its not enforced..\n\nIf you google eiffel tower at night surprise surprise, 100's of pics come up.\nGonna have to dislike because this video makes it seem like a super serious thing when in reality, nobody gives a shit, including France
I just googled and result for Effiel Tower at night is... Endless... 😋😋😂😂😑😑🙃🙃
Let's see YouTubed:\n\nPyramid of the Louvre - France\nLittle Mermaid Statue - Copenhagen\nAND for good measure\nTermini station - Rome\n\nYup that about covers it, found videos on all of Them, so much for that _don't film_ bit.
Well that’s a retarded law
They show the Eiffel tower at night in Ratatouille. Did pixar haveto get permission to do so?
Because someone comes to use that giant dildo before it sleeps
Uk.... European Union 😂😂😂 get out of here uk, you choose for the brexit
This is really dumb
The last part of this is an ad.
Who else looked up a photo of it at night?
Long story short they added lights which which make it illegal to show at night but is okay during day.
So i cant take a picture at night because of some pile of junk is in the way?
fun fact the UK left the European union look it up
They gonna copyright a croissant next
Okay, but why don't normal buildings have to be censored? I mean buildings where people live and work
What happens if u not blur? Will those architect come to where u live if it's not the eu or even France? Will they summon u to the international court or something?
the E.U.\na place where Somalis and Muzies can rape European women but people can't take a photo to buildings at night.. smh
there are many videos of eifel tower at night.
⭐... too windy. If it was American we would stop all that wind 😂😂😂
And this is why the US is the best smh
Ugh people are dumb ok so first of all they bought the design but if you take a picture the buildings then your ok but if you take the design I mean like taking the design and call it your own that’s illegal but taking pictures of it is fine since your not actually taking credit for the thing your not taking pictures of just taking a photo of it but with videos it’s different if you take a movie or a video off of someone and get money of it then that’s illegal
welp, off to start my website full of illegal photos of public buildings and other random landmarks
Can the night shot be painted?
That's wrong. There is a lot of pictures of the eiffel tower at night. And, this is not really illegal. It is like in the United States where there are many old ridiculous laws that have never been abolished but are inapplicable
This stupid I found hundreds of pictures of the Eiffel Tower at night
But destroying Libya for French Economic interest is legal.
Interesting! Speaking of Eiffel tower, you pronounced the man's name as ef-el, should we be pronouncing the building's name the same way, or is there a reason we say I-fell? Surely at this point it doesn't matter, I'm just curious.
So is smoking weed fed law \nmakes it illegal but hasn't been enforced in friendly states but when that day comes you'll be charged with a federal crime meaning federal prison somewhere in Oklahoma
What  about the purple tower when Prince die. That pic at night
This is the dumbest shit that I've ever heard
Should an instagram post be getting a copyright if for example I did a selfie and have the eiffel tower at night? Is it considered as a commercial use?
Eat my ass I’m American I’ll do what I fuckin want
This is idiotic. It should be legal to take a picture of anything that's as public and exposed as a fucking building. People should have the right to capture landmarks in commercial works! It would never make sense to do it any other way. This kind of laws is attacking basic freedoms, and is denying one of the fundamentals of art: Its message and its impact by being seen and examined by the public. Just as I can talk about the lights of the Eiffel tower, I should get the right to express them through art, be it a painting or a replica. And I should get the right to sell those, as long as I don't cash in on claiming I inventing anything I didn't invent. Fuck you, France.
I start get annoyed by your ad, wth? 10s the beginning, 30s the end? of a total 4:30 video? you are worse than chinese online video sites
We should get the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building at night to be a piece of copyrighted artwork too!
I have lots of videos of it it about a 45 min drive from my home
People in these comments are just disrespecting another country. Wtf, that is really rude and technically they have a point. It's just like copying a movie. Also, don't forget that Apple sues any company that does a similar design to their phone or device color.
So are we just going to ignore the fact that the animator used a Boy Scouts version of the Navy SEALs copypasta?
I call communism on this one
Jail? Is copyright infringement really a criminal offense in France?
Who would have made a video with this and other stupid things? They would have needed a brain.
When you blurred out the Eiffel Tower, I just got reminded of Asian porn...
Just googled it at night, found nothing but eiffel tower pictures at night
Time to make a illegal European monument website using square space, sorry for the angry email ahead of time
damn i learn alot from this, thanks and also great video
This is why Rockstar designs its own cities for every big game
This comment is copyrighted. If you dare take a screenshot of it, I’ll have the FBI come and say hello.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZW7et3tPuQ So this commercial footage of the Eiffel Tower at night with its lights on is illegal?
Does this mean Hitler broke copyright laws?\nThat bastard...
Didn't expect my country to be mentioned in here lol, Venezuela :)
I just used square space for illegal European photos and of the tower
I am pleased to present my magnum opus, the Eiffel Tower with a little Reindeer on top. It's an original work, just installed. So photos of this tower are now illegal. However licensing options are available for the next 120 years! For only $1.99 per impression, you can share this amazing sight with the uncouth eyes of the general public.\n\nYou're welcome!
That French to E.U. flag animation was probably the most sexy thing I’ve seen
amazing video mate. i love riddle and science and i give reasons too . please pin this . i make reasoning scientific vids
HAHAHAHAHA. seriously get off your high horse France.
I have tons the eiffel tower photos by night in my phone... 😵😵
How silly this thing really is 😂
This is honestly so bullshit on every level. Delete this fucking video. You can take pictures of any building you fucking want, and everything you've said is completely false. There are LOTS of photos just google Eiffel Tower at night. Jesus Christ
No photos? Ok. \n*Records the Eifell tower*
As a person who is studying architecture, this is incredibly stupid. The building is built for the people and by the people. If it is meant to by symbolical and celebrated, why copyright them so people can't share the amazing things they saw and be inspired by it?!
My name is Paris. Hi👋🏽 🤓
Is my dick in your mom's mouth illegal?
I'm copyrighting the sun
Who else search up the Eiffel Tower at night? After watching this
Interesting Fact : No one cares
Fucking French
This sounds either untrue or outdated..
Thats so stupid
Fuck squarespace
Good job, Europe
this rules is retarded
Aaaaahhhhhhh. I see now

ok lol
Thank you so much to Quidd for sponsoring us! Go get some Ryland, Drew, and Shane STICKERS here!!!!!! it's free!! http://bit.ly/2xs3Evj
I was just crying, went upstairs to watch this video. Made me laugh and make me feel less shitty...
Nobody gonna talk about this 13:05
I love the fact that he treated the waitress as if she was a friend of his. He literally saved a slice 🍕 for her!!!!!! Gotta love Shane❤️
Is that poor turtle swimming around in that tiny glassbox and there is nothing else there, no decorations or anything. Is there place where that poor thing can rest? What is this. Im shook, but not in a good way.
Drew is literally me with pizza. I now aspire to have a booth in my house just for eating pizza.
Buzzfeed was shooketh when Shane walk over their Worth It show. 😂😂😂😂😂
Whose eating pizza while watching this? 🍕
you have too watch M5 Please
Did anybody else get Shane’s reference when he said “And the reason is food~”
I forgot why I stopped watching shane....I remember now
The waitress was so beautiful and sweet, and the valet guy was such a nice guy. Honesty love how Shane just treats everybody like a friend.
It looks like they're going to a funeral 😂
AND THE REASON IS FOOOOOOODDDD
Ryland has a new video where he does something gay, I don't know Ryland- *screams*
that waitress was so nice, funny, and beautiful
idk why but im totally crushing on the waitress
Each slice of that pizza would be $125 down the hatch. (If it was 8 pieces)
Warms my heart how well those people clicked with you
I don't care about the content of the  video, but drew is in the thumbnail so I had to watch it! Haha!
The waitress reminds me of  antonia.. idk she looks like her a bit
i'm peeling the skin of my faace
ugh i can't stop seeing guardians of the galaxy ads
what's better than this, just guys being dudes.

I watched the ad in the middle of the video so Shane gets reimbursed for spending 1,000 on pizza lmfao
omfg now i want a piece
Whelp Shane can now cross off eat 1,000 pizza from his bucket list, lol.
OMGG MY best friend sent me a picture of your eating pizza and i was like wtf is that and she just responded diss appointed. i thought you liked him i watched your video just now and realized what she meant i use quidd all the time now 😂
Is it okay that I'm wrinkly
Shane: PIZZA FACT!\nRyland: Cheese-us Christ...\n\n(I thought he said cheese-us... I'll go home) 😅\n(wait I'm already home)

Pretty the valet thought Shane was Julian 😂
Nobody's ever ordered that before? Shane you're a part of their history lol!
operator: Hello 911 what's your emergency \nMe: I don't got my espressos \nOperator: um this is an emergency number\nMe: this is and emergency!!!☕
I thought this a buzzfeed video when I saw the thumbnail
It doesn't matter if they think Shane is from Buzzfeed because they're gonna make the same vid a week later
I love how they shared a slice with the waitress I was really hoping for that
when the guy at the restaurant recognised shane i actually died it was adorable
I'll still eat it I'm laughing way too hard
WEEZER HAS BEEN R E P L A C E D
Whoa wait, is Drew's new apartment Trisha's old apartment on the beach, or am are the similarities just in my head?? I searched for comments about this but couldn't find any.
That small as pizza looks like over cooked roast beef pus lmao ewwwwww who would ever want that!!!
I want my turtles to meet drews turtle
I wish I was rich just so I can go there and eat that pizza

How's Ryland sitting there eating in the car while they go to buy a $1000 pizza. 😂
Am I the only one who misses Shane’s giant cakes? Like fr they are funny as hell to watch
Shane!  Do a song parody of Hoobastank's The Reason but with the lyrics and the reason is fooooood!
I found it my life is complete yeszzz
Shane the first idiot to order 1000 fucking dollar pizza ...wow Shane wow

No doubt Tom love his granpups but it's weird the way he talks to him, like he's a little boy. My grandad would knock seven shades of shit out of me if i talked to me him that. Strange.
The main reason we have the Queen is tourism, tradition and international relations.
I love the videos with your Granddad. All my grandparents are gone, so I live vicariously through you guys!
42 min vlog.\nThat's our boy😇
title should have been call 'Gordon's Big Day Out'
Hes Granddad is so damn patient with Tom lol. You can tell loves him and is to nice to be like stop recording me every 2 mins motherfucker lol. Such a great soul.
You should have sent one of your post cards to Ron
Pendolino? Superfast... no, just kinda average...
Great Vlog  Tom but HMS Belfast is a light cruiser not a Battleship but loved the vid
Hey Tom I build those helicopters in philadelphia

I am a afraid to say Gordon what wrong the is the queens flag that shows the queen is there if it was a Union Jack she wouldn’t be in
The Guard was probably a viewer and was in 2 minds in going against rules and jumping off the horse to get a selfie with you hahahaha
I fucking love Gordon lol
I absolutely love Gordon😂😂😂
Gordon for pm
All the places you visited remind me of Assassin's Creed Syndicate
The grandad is a\n mad tang
Tom just  keep this in your mind. I slept on HMS Belfast over night. With all those creepy figurines...
It's not a skirt Thomas!!!! It's a kilt. A KILT!!!!
The queen is only in when that flag is up which is the royal coat of arms and the guards are doubled up like that
GORDON WHAT A LAD. I'M CREASING
Your granddad is amazing. both my grandparents are gone, i enjoy it when your granddad joins you in your videos

Oh you mean this carl😂😂 I laugh so hard😂
Hate to say it but Gordon is wrong! When the Union Flag 🇬🇧flys above the palace the queen is NOT home, when the Royal Standard flys  above the palace like in the video it shows the Queen is home
@lil_pidge_ Still tryin' for that controller!
please remember tom that that was a kilt not a skirt thank you
Your grandad is Amazing! We Love GORDON! ❤️
Your Grandad needs his own Insta!! Who cares about people's cats and dogs, I wanna see a page about Gordon!❤
The queen is in when the royal standard is flying like the one in the vlog, not the Union Jack
Tom you should take your granddad to la with you
We havent left the European Union
Fairly certain Karl made a Pheonix night reference which went right over Toms head 😂

I think you’ll find the queen and royal family bring in money too Tom. Lots and gives our country a identity and shows our tradition and history.
That guard defiantly watches the vlogs Hahahaha his grandad love loves to moan and Carl pissing his sides at the end was brilliant
Btw Tom the flag is always flying over every royal estate. If the queen is in the royal standard is up instead.
@ethan.luke.neill
The flag at Buckingham Palace was the Royal Standard flag which meant the queen was at home. Its not the Union Jack
Best vlog yet hahaha your grandad is just content gold. Had me in creasing all the way through the vlog but that phone all at the end had me in tears hahaha
“ give him the finger duty “ 😂😂 your grandad is a funny wanker
This was cute
I have slept on HMS Belfast, I could't god damn sleep after looking at all those dummies!!!!
Ooooooh that means my shirt came out of the new office
SERIOUSLY TOM !! there is a video of a guard screaming at a girl in that same spot.People thought it was a joke but its not.The vid would be about 5 -6 yrs ago.Because It was around the time that Jackass was filming there movie. MAYBE its Alice ???  Need to have a search on youtube
Some of Russia is in Europe some of its in aisa it's weird
Tom if your ever back in London with Lidia or Gordon or anyone I live in London and for Dinner would recommend Aqua at the shard, Hutong at the shard (Best Chinese Ever ever been to), The Ivy, The Wolseley, Nobu (Japanese) and the OXO tower.
No lie my family owned this ship
Taxi time, granddad time, must be tom time, love this guy so much.
#10 on trending tom
You look a lot like your grandpa
That is exactly what is wrong with these kids nowadays.. look there is drake. Who drake the rapper?.. no.. Drake who saved us from the  armada. Even when you google drake its the rapper ffs.. wild.
Im suprised he hasnt punched you
And this is the place where I killed many police officers and royal guards in Assassins creed syndicate
My Daughter flicks my Dad's/her Grampy's earlobes the same you do to your lovely Grandad!  \nGordon is an Absolute Legend!  Sleep Well, I hope you don't ache too much xx
So this video has barley 200k views and is in the trending section and has 8 ads in it... okay...\n\nThis guy also conned his fans.
Your grandad is the cutest!!! 😂😊
I didn't know Tom knew boulevard of broken dreams
Tom this vid is in the trending section on YouTube wow
Hate ta tell ya, but she's home when the Royal STANDARD is flying not the Union Jack. So the flag that you guys saw meant she was home
Most entertaining Vlog of 2017.
Should take em with ya to la show em round the sights
What a beer pour!!! I'll show you how to pour a proper one
Love you boo but you're so behind the track.. there are new releases every day we'd love to see u mixing it up with looks and brands 💆🏻💆🏻
Please can you start listing the products you used in the description box or maybe annotate them on the video because I would love to he able to see what they are as it will be easier to recreate  the look
that's red not pink.........
Wow i wouldn't have thought to use orange and purple together, but this is booomb
Loved this look so much I recreated it this morning only using your palette!  I’ve used the purple a ton with gold, and hadn’t figured out how to use the orangey reds...boom! Loved it!  Please do more looks with you’re palette.  How do I use the greens???
GORGEOUS!!! Can't wait to have a play with my collection now 😁💜💜💜
I like how helllllla people are bitching because she’s using morphe...ummm hello!?!? Did you not watch the video!? She used the SEPHORA pro palette, she used Nars, makeup geek, maybelline, kat Von d, etc. y’all are acting like this was a “one brand tutorial” or something. And even if it was, GET OVER IT!!! Just like she said “use whatever palette or products that you have” you’re not going to be able to recreate this look EXACTLY even if you used everything the same it will still look different because you’re not her. Get over it, stop bashing her, move on, get a life. Kthanxbye 👍🏼😁
Natural backdrop is soo much better
Love the background stunning, really goes with your eye colors 💁❤️
Hi dear can u do some makeup looks using bhcosmetic....and first impression video on the products from bh cosmetic. .thank u jaclyn..luv u and ur makeup looks...
Very good job ! I love this look!
you guys wonder why jaclyn doesn’t upload as much anymore...READ THE DAMN COMMENT SECTION. you guys are sooo unbelievably rude and harsh and just nasty it’s sickening. i wouldn’t want to be on here either. maybe if you all started spreading some positivity or frankly just shutting your mouth sometimes.... you’d get more content/enthusiasm. these comment sections are nothing but her getting teared down... i’m sure it gets a little discouraging to upload!
I loved the look way much more without the last rosegold shade in the middle like the purples were talking to me
when are you gonna collab with your own lashes?
ALWAYS LOVE YOUR TUTORIALS, the way you explain it👌i'm sub'd to so many ppl but when i want a certain look it's almost always your videos I go too
Love this!!! Thank you!
I have a purple witch costume this would look amazing with! So stunning! 😱😍💜
I love that backdrop! I can’t wait for my palette to come in so I can try this look!!! 😍
Wish it was a full face tutorial❤️
Looovvveeee the look you nail it every time!!!\nFlawless stunning your good girl may god keep blessing you always you keep  it up!
I'm definitely going to need to try doing this look!
It’s sad that I can tell EXACTLY what part of Hocus Pocus is playing. That shiz is on repeat in my house every October
You got the palette in the mail today and played with it yesterday and today?????????
I am ok with the backdrop but I think I love it a lot more if its just a background of anything in your home. Glitter is just not a love.
I hope to be this amazing at make up one day, especially eyeshadow! That’s definitely my biggest struggle 😅 this look is gorgeous
Love this and love YOU. oh my god. Gorgeous look.
I feel like she really doesn't enjoy making videos anymore.
You should do a what's in my bag or question and answer
Such a beautiful look
Would love more wearable and natural looks for Fall! <3
Tati Westbrook! 5 uploads a week. She's genuine, keeps it real, and doesn't use 25 eyeshadows for a 'look'.. If you see the real Jaclyn Hill in your travels, let her know that people miss her.. That's if you have time of course..
You and John are hilarious. Loving this look!
What was the point of putting on the reddish colors if she was gona cover them with purple 😐
I know times are changing and so it YouTube but I would love to see some OG YouTube style vids.  Also maybe incorporate john soon??  Your glitter backdrop is good on occasion👌🏻 \n** side note everyone always bitches about how annoying they think she is and her screaming but then she has a super chill video and now people are bitching about that... 🙄🙄\nAlso Jaclyn could you to a step by step how to do a cut crease 😍
I miss the fiery red haired Jaclyn with a softer brow. The dark is pretty, but I miss the red hair! Bold brows are pretty, but for you I like a softer brow.
Believe it or not we are using your techniques for our music videos...
Only cause you asked... I hate backdrops but that's just me 😬 love this look tho 😍
I want more looks with your palette!!!!!
You are so beautiful😍😍😍😍
I love you Jaclyn thank you for this video!! I need to see an updated bridal tutorial!!!
I like that you are doing more actual makeup tutorials.
My sister loves you (Jaclyn Hill) & we talk about makeup every time we visit each other & about your products. Just like the comments below I've been watching for about 4months I just discovered your channel. I was going to say that some videos you do look a little dingy ( like in a whatever mode) idk but my sister basically said that the videos are not that great anymore because you already made your money. I'm not trying to be mean.
Gorgeous! Any small you tubers want to support each other? xx
Jacklyn I love how you give great tips in your videos (eg using a certain shape brush or keeping the blending power in the crease). Can you please keep giving detailed tips and lots and lots of them! For me the challenges that I have are that I can't afford international shipping/duties for morphe brushes so I need to know what to look for in other brands, and when I do I looks mine tend to turn out muddy and never as pretty as yours. Thanks Jacklyn!
Jaclyn, i usually never comment on YouTube videos but  i absolutely love this look!!!!! It is soo gorgeous! You are truly an artist and you're so talented. Thank you for this video!!!!!
I've been watching for a few years now and this is my favorite look, that's a non-neutral, that you have ever done! I love you. Keep succeeding and keep being you. I love watching you grow and further not only yourself but also your career in make up!
I am so excited that your pallet will be available at ulta😊🤗
Love this look! Background not so much 😘
I like this purple deep sunset look, I dont find alot of utbers do purple smokey eyes😋🤣
I can totally relate to not wanting my partner see me film or feeling awkward when I´m doing my voiceovers! It´s like don´t see me or heard me please!
Beautiful makeup look I'm loving the brand new morphe palette love
Who doesn’t wear lower lash mascara, yes we need it!
I love the purple backdrop
I've never really watched your videos and wow amazing!!!!! You give such good instructions and wow I am in love!!!!!!
Please do more looks using your palette!!
I thought it was hunts, not hunty
I do love this look I need this palette love the glitter background Jaclyn love u so much
i love this look, but i really fell in love with the eye look before she added the purple and everything after. it looked so beautifully warm and just a dreamy fall smoky eye.
I think I'll try this look but using black, purple, and copper.  Btw wth isn't your eyeshadow called HUNTS????  You kept saying Hunty lol.
Jaclynn, you're beautiful! I love your pallet. Keep doing you, beautiful.
*goes to order her brush set off morphe* Says “out of stock” *tears up, crys myself to sleep*
I'll nut on that chalky face
Is it me or does she always wear black pencil on her waterline???? It always looks really dark 😂
Love this look... definitely gonna try it sometime
“I get a lot of request for tutorials with morphe” where they at tho 🤷‍♀️
Of course she's not super keen on YouTube anymore... people think it's okay to leave negative and nasty comments
i can guarantee if I'm putting 12 shades of purple on my eyes I'm looking like I've just did 10 rounds with mike tyson.
If i see one more person talk about how she looks im going to SCREAM!!!! Its her face! She is happy with it and that is all that matters! How you you feel if someone walked up to you and told you that you looked better a couple of years ago then you do now? Yeah it would suck! Shes an actual person and if you cant be a decent human being then go away! No need to make her or anyone else feel just as miserable as some of you seem to be!
Can we get some looks using the Balm Cosmetics??? Such an underrated brand.
You've said over and over on your videos and Snapchat that you spent so much time and energy on your Morphe pallet and yet you've only down maybe 2-3 videos. Come on Jac literally sooooo many of your subscribers have supported you and bought your pallet myself included and we would love to see more looks. You did the same thing when you came out with the other Morphe pallet. I prefer your normal background and not a color or glitter one.
why did she mess with her face...it was beautiful...
I've been watching your videos for less than six months, and you have completely revolutionized my makeup life! I've learned about so many new brands of makeup, and I'm getting so many compliments on my makeup because of everything I have learned from you. Keep doing what you do!!!
GURLL!!! WHAT BRUSHES ARE YOU USING!!!!???? PLEASEEEEE
This is gorgeous!!!!
2017 Fall look using your palette...PLEASE!!!!!!
LOOOL the bloopers at the end 😂
LMAO the end
4million subscribers?
So beautiful !!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Wow! ... super beautiful.

Yusssss this look is everything 💖 omg slayyyyy 💁🏻

Love this look!!
Yikes!  Lara Flynn Boyle circa 2015 vibes....
I loveeee morphe palettes
Why is this trending
TRENDINGGG
love the backdrop !
Queeeeen
This looks amazing
Really beautiful Jaclyn
Any small YouTubers wanna support eachother ?? 💜 let me know 👇👇👇👇
If you don’t love this eye look, you’re lying. Slayyyyyy
Is it just me or was the editing on this really bad??
I get people are cranky about her using morphe so much but you really can use whatever you want! Use whatever colors that are similar or is it that people aren't creative enough to do That? I never use what youtuber use but I can recreate the looks with similar colors I have all the time. 🤷‍♀️
Love this Jaclyn!! don't listen to these comments saying you should dedicate more time to youtube, keep doing you boo & your real fans will love and be excited anytime you put out a video
Omg anna’s Bianca voice is so funny. “Oh she’s so stupid”😂
Anna was so funny in this vlog, I just love her xxx
Anna is such a good mum
This world is shit 😐
I swear these people put a child or the word baby in the title to get trending.
I'm so happy that at the start of the video they gave me an answer to my geography homework and we had to know what Budapest was the capital of 😂😂😂
Irish sounds like a language I can speak called Gaelic
Jonathan is the best!
Anna I think you lost your bonkers hahahaha love you guys
Don't ignore signs of this happening to your children.
12 on trending!!! Xxx
Sub to sub guyzz?
we love u
I just love Anna
HAAA!! Anna's Bianca's voice is everything
I’m from Hungary 😊living in Uk 😊
Anna you are amazing with that voice!!!!....I love it~~~Is UK the only place you can buy the smoothies???????
How beautiful is Anna guys??!! And hilarious too!!
Anna needs to do a whole video just in the dogs voices. I love it !!
Love watching u guys! It brings a smile to my face!💖 alessia is so adorable, emilia is so kind and clever ,Eduardo is so cute and happy, Anna is so gorgeous and Jonathon is so bubbly and sweet! I'll always watch your lovely videos! Xxxxx
The fAct that you told people what  happened is incredibly brave, inspiring...and shows a LOT of strength...i hope it helps others who have sadly been in your situation...even if they don't feel so alone 💚💚 my heart breaks thinking of how many people have been victim of sexual assault 😢💚
As soon as he said #nevercopyanother I Started to copy someone
if you go to bing type in yotube and search at the nside there is a little picture of you guys the saconyjolys
Eduardo's laugh is the best !
I like how that, despite the fact that you probably had a rough day when you released that video, you remained positive and happy for your kids. I know how hard that is. I have severe anxiety and it’s sooooo hard to be happy for anyone or anything. I don’t have kids but as hard as it is for me to remain happy during anxious times as a single adult with no kids I can only imagine how hard it must be to remain strong in front of your kids when you’re feeling crummy. I’m so sorry about what you went through Jonathan. I’m so happy that you have Anna and the kids to remind you that you’re a great person and Dad and to keep you on your toes and help you get this off your mind.
Alessia might be the happiest little human on earth 😂❤
Omg anna you kill me with the dog voices it's hilarious! Really looking forward to meeting you guys in Milton Keynes in a few weeks!
I love you guys so much! Such amazing parents ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a big inspiration Jonathan! Your story will help so many people. I love your family and have watched for over a year now 💗💗
Hahaha I love them their so Funny 😂 Jonathan is so brave also
I'm glad you told your mom. I am very sure that the video you posted about your terrible experience helped so many people. You are brave And supported by so many.
Omg lmao Anna's accent for Bianca was everything lol so funny!!!
I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
This video proves that some viewers jump to conclusions way too quick and it proves that no, we viewers don't really know anything because there's so much going on behind the scenes so who are we to speculate. I'm saying this because I was scrolling through the comments of yesterday's video and I saw people being mad about him not telling his mom before putting out the video. So this is for all of you. In your face.
Hahaha I love Anna’s bianca voice they are sooooo funny
Alessia seems like such a happy well behaved baby all the time ❤❤
Anna is literally the funniest woman in the world! Love her to bits! I aspire to that woman!!! 💕
Anna couldn't look more beautiful 😍😍
Well done for speaking out Johnathon, that can't have been easy to do. Anyone out there who sees this and has someone in their life making them do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell someone, a parent, a friend, a teacher, a sibling, a doctor, anyone and don't stop talking until someone helps you
I'm so proud of you for sharing your story. It's so important to open a dialogue for men to discuss their stories too.
Jonathon you helped me with that video you put up as a survivor myself... I admire you so much for speaking up ❤️ I’m coming to see you guys at the baby event at olympia next weekend 😀💙
When Johnathan was talking about those muffins all I could think about was that scene from mean girls; would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin? 😂
Love love love Anna doing that voice over for the dogs!! 😂😂
Hahaha that was the best promotion for innocent 😂 Anna's bianca voice is my fave thing ahhaha amazing!!!
The Bianca voice!! 😂 made my day!!
So proud of you jonathan
I could watch a whole day just with Anna narrating as Bianca. I f-ing love it!!! Anna you seriously have the best sense of humor
After watching your video yesterday, I still affirm that you are very brave and such a wonderful role model!  By sharing your story you have shown others that they do not have to be a victim and that they can go on to live their best possible lives!  What someone does to someone else, does not define them!!!  They have the power to do and be anything they want as they are not defined by a circumstance!!!   Bianca Baby, you are hilarious!!!  XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA. God Bless!!!
We support you no matter what!!! It sucks telling your story for the first time but you survived it...please take care of yourself the next few days it can hit hard after!!💕🙏🙏
Ok Jonathan. The hungry - Hungary joke is not a good one and not original. Sincerely: a Hungarian person \nLove you though
That voice and clip though.... genius !!!!!
loving the photo in the background at the start, little squid.
So so proud of your bravery, Jonathan ❤❤❤
Anna is so funny, she had me dying in her Bianca voice
Jonathan you are so brave! Anyone who knows you is lucky to have you as a friend
I love when Anna voices the dogs 😂😂
Eduardo is THE sassiest little man and I am in love.
OMGosh, I love that exasperated little breathy laugh that Alessia does when she's excited. Its much too cute!! 😍😍\nAwwww, ballet with Daddy!! How fun!! 💚💜💛\nI love the ending, haha!! When you talk for them its hilarious!! The little Bianca knit was so cute too.
I love love love when Alessia flaps her arms and makes that joyful breathing noise! I just LOVE it and it makes me so happy. #precious
Anna, why don’t you just take an umbrella with you!!
Jonathan  we can all\nappreciate your courage! Your a wonderful example of strength and character. Your family respects and adores you as do hundreds of viewers. So thank-you for your bravery and bringing another truth to the pitiful silence of sexual assault!
You are such an amazing human Jonathon xxx
I want to see Eduardo take over the vlog for a day!
God Bless you,  Jonathan.  I can tell how hard that was for you to talk about. I was almost sexually assault when I was 6 by a close relative.  I ran away so nothing ever happened,  however it still haunts me every now and then.  It took me years to tell anyone about it. I'm not sure why,  because nothing happened.  I guess I was just ashamed and that it was my fault for trusting this person.  Just know,  that you're not alone.  I've told my husband and kids what happened and the loved me even more.  Im not sure how I would have felt if I hadn't ran away.
I freaking LOVE Bianca and her funny voice and EVERYTHING I can't with Bianca
Out you will feel better....
I stand by your side no matter what happen to you than and in the future.  I will never abandon you. 💕💕💕💕
You are the sweetest mom, Anna :)
Anna doing the dogs voices is the best. Dying for an episode of the dogs voiced by Anna.
It could be the newer food you’re feeding the pups, that’s causing the staining on their faces.
Doesn't Anna just seem so healthy and happy recently? 💙
I say the darnn with what others think. It helped you and it will help others. The outcome will be way more good from your release. Well done.
First, thank you Jonathan for sharing your story. I’m sure that was incredibly difficult to do and I’m sorry you had to go through that and live with it. Second, my parents are on a cruise in Budapest as well! How funny!
The dogs voices kill me 😂

You are so pretty ANNA ❤️

I AM FROM GERMANY.PLEASE TALk SLOW.LOVE THIS FAMILY.KISSES
I'm not sure I've ever commented on a YT vid before (even though I've been watching you for hundreds of years now) ...I just felt totally compelled to tell you that you look absolutely especially stunning here, just such a babe! X
You look so fresh faced! Blooming gorgeous xx
LOVE the minimal make up! Seriously, you look gorgeous!👌🏻😃
I LOVE your makeup! Minimal face makeup and eyes and a bolder lip. Very different than a lot of looks that you rock, but it's perfect and I want to try it!
The mustard colour works so great with your hair colour! Love dis <3
love your make-up, you look beautiful <3
You should ditch the extensions and cut your hair into a bob
You look so young and fresh in this video! Would love to see an updated skincare routine, your skin looks amazeballs.
I love the lipstick you're wearing in the cut away!!!!
OMG YOUR MAKE UP LOOKS STUNNING! love love love it!
You have the most beautiful facial bone structure! ❤️ kisses!
Can you consider signing up and selling on Depop please!? LOVE most pieces you wear.
You are literally the girl in me before you. You look and sound the exact same
I dont want to say that i like you way more without much eye makeup or in general makeup, but you LOOK SO GOOD and fresh without heavy makeup! It looks so natural and ..just great! :)
Crazy I never noticed your eye colour before! Must be your makeup today -  😍
You look AMAZING in everything 😍😍😍
Really digging the minimal makeup and that you can see some of your beautiful freckles more! Love the vid as always Helen!
Actually loving the lighter makeup on you, looks so fresh! And that white jumper from Zara wowza! XX
@Helen if you want to revive your old face jeans you can buy some dylon dye that you put in the washer, worked a dream for me! hope this helps!!<3
i looove the lace up kinda jeans so much!!
As soon as you said that you’ll love this jumper I knew which one it was before it came up, saw it the other day and fell in love 😍😍😍
On the white boots, the right foot has a stud missing.. unsure if you noticed?! 💗💗
I love the fluffy sleeves from Zara - such a statement piece :) xx
I bought a mustard jumper just like that yesterday but in Primark, fucking LOVE it!! So warm and incredibly soft 😍 \nLove, love, love your sense of style! 💞 xx
The v neck on the rusty/mustardy jumper looked really flattering on you, Helen! Really lovely. Love your hauls :) x
Your pink coat YES I'M IN LOVE
You didn't show us you in the yellow dress!!
I absolutely love how mustard colored clothes look with your purple hair 😍
Love love love that you have your own style and that you aren't like all the other you tubers that are carbon copy's of each other. So refreshing 💕💕
Those bright pink trousers look so good on you! I'm loving everything you've gotten in this haul 😊 x
The slight rumbling makes me think of paranormal activity when the bass comes up when crazy shit is about to happen
They do the coat in grey as well - bought it a few weeks ago it's amazing!!
That white jumper from Zara looks\namazing on you! Reminds me of Christmas!!!
LOVING LOVING LOVING you in minimal makeup you look so fresh and Parisian!
OMG I have a burnt out, rusty  orange jumper the exactly same feel as your mustard yellow zara one. Mine's from M&S lol. They're silky soft aren't they! 😂 ~ Georgia x
Makeup looking lovely! Few things will be seeking out this weekend. It's Prince of Wales check, rather than dogtooth or herringbone x
Omg you look so pretty with minimal makeup!!!! ❤
You are so beautiful Helen x
Loveing the makeup! You have beautifull skin and don't need foundation :D
I love the way you manage to make everyday or more casual outfits look really interesting and glam. You have the best style :)
everything about you is perffffff xx
You are so beautiful. Your lashes are just INCREDIBLE.
Just wanna say how much I love your videos and the effort you put into each of them. Got a little bummed when I didn’t seen “try on” in the title, but alas! You tried things on (I hate when hauls aren’t try ons, you don’t know what things look like!) You never disappoint.
OMG, babez, you look so cute today! What is that lipstick you're wearing in the try ons? It looks so beautiful on you! Pls let me know! xx
Always find it weird  I see stuff I already own in hauls
ahhhh I’m trying to save money😩😩😩😩😩
Where's the jumper ur wearing from? It's amazing
This could've potentially been a very expensive video for me to watch, if I didn't have to shop in the girls/teen section of every store! 😂😂😂
That top at the end went with everything you put on! Love it 😍
Do you ever shop in Pull & Bear? I just imagine a lot of the stuff being things you'd wear!
You look so lovely and fresh without lots of eye make up!
You look AMAZING in the cutaways!! I don't know if it's your make up or weight loss but your face just looks incredible, and obvs just love this video because what's not to love 🤙
Hel you look so cute and fresh faced in the cutaways where you’re trying the stuff on!
Love your style Helen- so fun which is what fashion should be !
looking so cute with this make up 😍😍 great video Helen 😊❤❤
On the white boots there is a big stud missing ( right side of the screen)
Helen, how do you like the UO top? I've been eyeing it forever and am on the fence about buying it because I'm plus size so I don't know how well it'd fit me.
Do a video with all your favourite new looks!
The fact that I can kinda hear the music but not really is making me crazy
I love this makeup!!!! Like the minimal eye and brighter cheek makes you look like a beautiful doll!!!! Love u <3
You just ooze beauty and are so stunning ☺️ I genuinely dig your whole aesthetic ❤️❤️
I love white boots! I have a pair of white platform ankle boots with a three inch heel, the entire thing made me five inches taller! I wore them to death though and I think they only have about two wears left before they really fall apart!
was gutted when you didn't try the urban outfitters dress on :(
I was watching this intro thinking what have u done different your makeup looks so good and fresh!! Then u said u had hearsay any on 😱 man I wish I looked fresh with no makeup lol
Can we just talk about how everything fits her perfectly?
Miss Helen I think you need some Freddie's of Pinewood in your life and Vivian of Halloway
That's a Helen coat 🍉💜 Love the whole haul. Xoxo
Helen looks like paloma faith in the video!
Not much on pink but that coat though. Love It!!
Omg I love your makeup in this Helen!! Literally looks so good and makes your skin look super amazing!! Love it❤️
gosh, i dont even know why but im looking at you and seeing as .. elf! or smth .... just add sharp ears edge ! ok i just go, scrool down
I love when Barney makes his special guest appearances 😂
Where is the jumper you're wearing from?
Yellow looks so good against your hair, fab!💖
I was just gonna buy that top from UO in orange!! It looks so cute on you
Helen where is your jumper from?? I lurvvvv it xx
Just wanted to comment on how stunning you're looking in this video! xo
OMG! Finally I found a liverpool youtuber! 👏👏👍
<------loves pinkelephantday
Oo I really like those lace-up trousers and that coat!
Always do but love your make up so much in this video!
I have the same white boots and they are SO comfy and look fab!
so sad I missed you in Liverpool!! I saw you were there on snapchat but I'm now in Sheffield for Uni. I wanna meet you, you’re so cool
That coat 😍😍
The jeans with the eyelets looking fricking amazing!!
those trousers from miss selfridge are beautiful :o
You look great
Prefer you makeup here
greattttttt video Helena
OMFG those trousers! 😭💕
The 'rusty mustard' jumper material is called chenille 😘
<3
Why are British youtubers so spoiled,snobby and self absorbed? Zoella, her bf, this one? And why r they always trending? Is this remotely entertaining?
Haha love you girl your lipstick missing in the corner and mascara  all over your eyelid.  No fucks given
I love your style! ❤❤❤
did you loose a stud on the white boot ??
Helen! I'm not sure if you noticed but your hair in most of your side videos your hair looks shoulder length on one side and I think shorter hair looks wicked on you!! Random I know!! 🙄
Loved this? Where’s the cute blue tie up top from? xoxo
I love your videos especially the hauls.. I love hearing you describe items hahaha, rustardy mustardy :)
I can’t find a good pair of jeans anywhere!! I’ve tired topshop Jamie jeans (last 6 months) tried new look (sizing is so bad), asos again sizing issues (always falling down) superdry jeans (too pricey & fake pockets) so any suggestions I’m open too XD.  #help!!!

You definitely need to do a hair care routine omg 😍😍😍
omg congratulations on your line everything is amazing !! well done <3 one question cant we buy stuff from uk misguided ? much love
I wish misguided would do a petites range of these pants because I already know they'd be way too long for lil old me
Great collection! I'm obsessed💋
Congrats on the collection they look amazing! Would love to see all of the items with larger sizes  💛
30$ is pretty cheap for such nice pieces. Dang even in Canada these prices rival Winners :0
I Love Carli so much but these clothes are to expensive and if I'm going to spend all of money on clothes I need to wear it all not just to a club I couldn't wear this too a grocery store, I would feel to exposed and u have to look perfect too wear those clothes.
I used to love her style, but from about a year ago her style changed to more kim k kylie jenner type. Not hating,  just an opinion so back off!
Do I ever go anywhere fancy that I can wear the collection to? No. \nWill I still buy heaps of the collection? Yes.
Although I’m waaay too broke to purchase any of these outfits, I’M JUST SO HAPPY & PROUD OF YOU CARLI!!! Everything looks amazing and you deserve everything!!!
THOSE TWO PIECE SETS ARE AMAZING!!! 😍😍😍 I NEED THE BLUE LEGGINGS WITH THE PINK STRIPES
So this is featured but not the line rider sync?
Omg it's gonna drop in time for my birthday! I cannaaah 😩🔥🔥🔥
Love that you have plus sizes, love the style, the price is reasonable, I adore your efforts!
Couldn't stop staring at your outfit the WHOOOOOLLLEEEE TIME! #CongratsCarli 💖
The shoes that wrap around the ankle in the black and the nude are stunning ! I have never seen any heels like that ❤️❤️👌🏻 I like the glitter and sparkle clothes but if you could of made dresses/skirts midi length instead of mini i would of bought ! Im 5'11 and i look crazy in a mini skirt 😏
everything is so beautiful, i love you! ❣️
AMBER SCHOLL YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS GONNA BE IN PAIN
I wish you did plus suze
Shit! It would be hard not to put it in ya!
You need more flowy shirts.  Not all of us have your tummy.  Also, the skirts that go up to a size 20 are pretty tight, so just because it fits doesn't mean they should wear it.  Just a few suggestions to make your line more regular people friendly.  Love ya!!
Will it be available in UK too? I'm in love!!!!
This collection is borderline horrible.. the sweats look nice tho 😕
Carli looks a little fuller in her hips, but no where else (She's not modelling the clothes or doing any full body camera shots). I get like this when there's a little passenger 🤔. Hope to hear good news soon 😃.
$45 dollars for a piece of fabric
I love love LOVEEEEE that she’s plus size friendly thank you Carli❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why is she so beautiful ?!
Why didn’t you try it on
Why is this chick trying to look like kim k???
This collection is amazing i want it all❤
Very unfortunate... No plus sizes 🙄 oh well, sticking to my fashion Nova ig
I want to get everything
I absolutely love your entire line! And for someone who is a size 12/14 I'm suuuuper excited for all the plus size options you have! Congrats on all your success and most importantly for being unapologetically you! Your amazing girl ! And such an inspiration to me! Can't wait for the 2nd drop 😘👏🏼✌🏼
White sweats! Definitely getting those...i saw some on nakd but wayy to expensive for a sweatpant...i hope they are true white!\nYou are amazing carli!
Is the pants tall people friendly??????? or would they look capri on me ?
So would you tape your boobs for the shiny rhinestone shirt that comes in silver/gold?
So much ppl are hating bc Who wears this on a daily basis? But ppl need to understand this is her style. It is beautiful just as how it is.  If you're insecure just  don't buy the collection.
Obessed with her style! ❤️ it's so extra and I love it!
Obsessed with the cargo silk pants and the cameo skirt and top! Congratulations!
Do a try on!
Physically walking into a store under your clothing collection would be so much fun!!!! I’d literally find everything interesting and cool. Every clothing stores nowadays is so boring and simple. At least the stores near me..
will the collection be available for your European subscribers?
Why don't you open up your own clothing store (online) so you can actually have a say on the prices.....
I mean...  its cool buhh what about +size 🤷🏻‍♀️ kinda disappointing  🙅🏻
I think that sparkly top would look awesome with the ribbed skirt!
those plum trackies look like my primary school clothes lol
That first one is not for big boobs
i hope i'm able to get an outfit for my birthday in november 😩😩😩
Omg no 👎🏻 😞 i was so excited too . I’m just sad it’s not my style but it would look amazing on somebody who likes that type of clothing
You are amazing Carli! I am so excited for this collection #OBSESSED xx.
I have to ask where are those strappy tan heels Moo is wearing in your snap!? I'm dying to find them 😭😩😍
i love it all, you did amazing so happy for you ❤️❤️❤️
literally this collection is everything that is in right now in terms of fashion. Obsessed!!! <3
There's a few pieces I LOVE. Definitely not the whole collection, some pieces look very cheap. Prices are decent IMO. Obsessed w.pink velvet shiny dress....Id use it as a jacket also & make a totally different look with it. Jean jackets are really cool too. And the jumpsuit shes wearing...*faints😍*
Everything i like is only available size 0-12 and im a 14/16....sigh....plus size women like crop tops and sequins too!!
The prices are super decent but my body just ain't having it. Shout outs to the women that can slay these pieces. :)
Hey girl but your going to restock if it sells out ? I saw about 4 things I wanna get !!!!
Do you feel like you want to look like Kim k ?? Just asking
❤️❤️❤️Just wanted to say what a kind sweet soul you are! My son and I love watching you feed Charlotte the deer on Snapchat! ❤️❤️❤️
You look beautiful & all your clothing collection so congratulations 🎉🎈🎊🍾
Omg I’m gonna cry. Your collection is awesome & I can’t wait for launch #2 to see how much the jumper you were wearing is!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Try on haul coming? Everything is beautiful carli ❤
just go to forever 21 and buy something similar and save money. 😏\n  comment by Teresa
Love her ! Love her style! But this is not clothes for your average Jane. Beautiful yes but to look at on all the pretty instagram models.
i love the pink lace.. is it available in Philippines??
Www Sunny Leone\nXxx com
Please like all the positive comments to drown out the complaints.
GUYS!!! This is a partnership with MISSGUIDED not Walmart. \n\nTo the people complaining about pricing: As Carli mentioned in her video, she isn't in charge of pricing. If you've ever bought anything from Missguided you know they have pretty good quality items, so of course they aren't gonna be budget friendly. Also, Missguided has sales all the time to kind of make up for it, especially if you're a college student. When you first sign up with Missguided it asks you if your'e a college student and make sure to sign up with your college email to get discounts through Unidays. Download the Missguided App, you'll be aware of all the sales going on.\n\nTo the people complaining about the outfit design: These were based off of Carli Bybel's own style. She wouldn't design things that she wouldn't wear. A lot of her followers love how she dresses (which is why her first launch sold out so quickly). She mentioned in her video, you could wear most of these items for Holidays/Special Events. Most of the items are not very conservative, most of them are crop top/bandeaus. I've seen many women who are not so slim rock crop tops. If you aren't comfortable wearing the crop tops don't buy them. There are other items that she offers like the skirts, pants, shoes, or jackets. \n\nTo people complaining about the sizing: As far as it being only for skinny people, I disagree, The sizing is pretty much 0-12 across the board on most of her items, and only a couple of her items offer bigger sizes. But that's typical for Missguided. It's basically your standard XS, S, M, L, XL. And since there are so many items in this collection (i think she said 100), it's difficult to make so many different sizes of each item. If you look at the single size chart on the Missguided website an XS is a size 4 and an XL would be considered a size 12. \n\nIt's not everyone's style, and not on everyone's budget. If you don't like the items or don't like Carli, then don't purchase them plain and simple.
Super happy for you. There were pieces I liked and others not so much but I liked most of them. Very good job Carli. Don't let any of these negatives comments get you down. You're #bookedandbusy and they're #brokeandmad Keep up the good work darlin! ❤️❤️
The clothes are so pretty. You remind of Kim K and Cher with your outfit and hair. I can't wait to see the whole collection.
I need everything
Congratulations!!!!!
Kim K 2.0
Yasssssssss take all of my moneyyyy 😍😍😍

WOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU   AMAZING

Congrats on another collection! 💕
no try on? boring :(
❤️❤️❤️
Enter...
Instagram: Officialbaileyc \nSnapchat: Blue203040 \nLove you all! ❤️
Love it 💕
EVERYTHING!!💖💖
These comments smh yall really waste your time commenting negative shit. If you got a problem with the clothes keep your irrelevant comments to yourself. It's sad when someone works on something so hard for others & then gets all this negativity. Carli, all these clothes are gorgeous & I would definitely purchase them ❤
Didn’t Carli post a snap story of that nude tube top and holes were already forming and it said great quality???
Can’t wait till the collection launches😍Love me some Carli Bybel ❤️
That Jean jacket.... Omg yes 😍
Watching this video over and over again just to prepare myself for the struggle when purchasing
how can she afford all this?
I noticed that she's wearing a ring on her left hand? Am I late?
When did they get engaged?
Rip my bank account
Saw this trending.\nMe: oh, Kim Kardashian is trending\n*closer look*\nMe: oeeewwww, it's another wannabe \n*bye*
He is so fake.
Clicked because PINK HAS A SON?? I know she had a daughter but whaaaaaaat?
Love Pink. And just wait until it's her daughter AND granddaughter that cries when she sings lol!
i cant wait to see P!nk in toronto a week after my birthday
Amazing price charmes with 10% off use code 10off go to\nMikeyww.com
yess
I cry when she sings too. Because I miss the old Pink. Now all of her songs are practically all the same.
I was psyched until I heard little Marshall was belching out his stench on her album.
Fallon just doesn't seem to connect with his guests. He's like an over excited kid on Christmas morning. Is that from smoking pot?
What do you see in your mom's hair
Wow, she's really cool 😎
*There have never been a pink m&m*
beautiful trauma and wild hearts can't be broken are amazing songs. Good job p!nk 👌
Holy shit Jimmy. It's not that difficult to learn the name of your guest's children and spouses. I have seen him fumble this so many times. It's so awkward to see him ask about people he clearly has no clue what they're called. I'm sure he has a research team who can write this very basic information on a card for him.
Whooo!! Can't wait for the tour
Who the hell cares.
Hello! I like your channel. Subscribe to my\nchannel.
She sound like such a mom talking about her son it's amazing love her so much
Punch that cuck in the face
he cries because this sl.ut is turning the little dude gay...
I realized that you don't tend to talk politics on this show, and I appreciate that. It's unfortunate that your ratings would be higher if you did get political, but keep at what you do, this is a show for everyone.
Harvey Weinstien  touched my pee pee while I was being forced to watch this video.  He made me say repeatedly my bean, my meatball, I felt used and disgusted about my new Hollywood movie coming out next Summer 2018!!!!!!!! Thanks Harvey we love you!!!!!
Hey y’all - can anyone find it in their hearts to subscribe to my channel?!\nI’m recently paralyzed & I chose to create a channel that inspires other wheelchair users ❤️\nPlease help me reach 1,000!! Ps....im not begging so if not, it’s cool - thanks for reading! 😘
Wait........ Pink is spelled out P!nk not Pink since when?
Jimmy is so fake though
Freaking love pink I'd cry if she sung to me to
Just another nasty skank with fans that have taste for shit!!!
I guess I'm Pink's son, because it makes me cry also..
Pink start her tour on my birthday!!
ANOTHER KID HOW LATE AM I
Im here because of p!nk, not because of the host.
This is not a scam or spam. I am trying to spread the word about my dream of becoming a mother. God Bless. https://www.gofundme.com/kasxky-help-me-become-a-mother
When you are old enough to remember when TRL asked Pink if she would collaborate with Eminem and she said Yes, because I think we are both misunderstoond.
So do I, but not for a good reason
You put special ed on your album?  Tell him we want fries with that.
Pink and Demi Lovato need to duet. It would be amazing
Can’t wait to see you in kc! Pink is a legit GREAT artist
In her time of Britney’s and Christina’s she ended up being the most talented and grounded star! Love her to bits.
Trending used to be useful
Omg! Pink is mom, mom now. We're getting old.
Jimmy is a real kiss ass
one of the best or greatest live acts in our era !
Pink is her generation's Bette Midler. Her husband looks so traditional, not at all who I think Pink would marry. Beautiful family.
Pink takes your money\nPink gives you lies\nBut hey , you like it !
Why does Pin dress like a homeless person
But she's white...
Rihanna is no way near as hot as P!nk 😂😍
He doesn’t want to hear that bitch either !
Pink is actually a man. You are deaf, dumb & blind if you think he is an actual woman. No possible way to birth a child.
How old is the meatball? LOL!
More pc social justice warrior mentality.
Ugh I love her dress. Ugh I love her.
Jimmy... as annoying as usual.
That colour suits her
carey is so handsome
burn Hollywood burn \nhttps://youtu.be/N2O7b4FcoXI?t=245
Come to Poppa \nhttps://youtu.be/tuveMDIAbd8
Idk why pink is so hot
#AnittafeatPink
PINKS A MAN!!!!!!
More Pink, less Miley please!
Why p!nk wearing Blue? 😂
Love Pink and love Eminem :)
cant blame him. probably hurts
I do too.. Bleeeawk,😝😝😝. 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Who else loves P!NK!!💕💜
Yeah pheonix

Harvey Weinstein
So do I.
Aww. Hi, Pink.
My 6 year old teenager. LOL
Jimmy's fake laugh sounds like Elmo eheheo

THE NEW HOT 93.5
I usually take a dump when she sings.
OMG! Eminen and pink ! Perfect combination 😭❤️😻 just wanna be épic🙌🏻👏🏼im weating for it!
She should be a teacher of celebrity's behaviour.
This lady is such full of shit.... Jesus appears when she sings too
I am going to go see her live in May. I am so excited, not only is it going to be my first concert, but it is also to see the person I have wanted to see live for like 6-7 years. I love her so much. I can't even describe how excited I am
One of the BEST female artists out there!  Love the album!!!
I love you Pink
She is the best now and forever !!!
I love Eminem and Pink together. An iconic duo.
P!NK LOVES EMINEM TOO, I LOVE HER EVEN MORE NOW
You god damn evil fucking Democrats. This is trending why???
Few people know that pink sings very well.  Her music fits a strange genre, but give her only a give her a wooden guitar and a mike...
Lol her son is look back at this & be like really mom u had to talk about my butt on national TV!? 😂😂😂😂

4:00 *Me with every KickThePj video*
I freaking love Pink ❤
“My bean, my meatball” *ahsdfjksksks I love her*
I cry whenever she sings. It's awful
I cry too when that ugly fucked up man sings.
Kimmels fucking forced laugh smh
What if that's just the way Jimmy Fallon laughs? 🤔

I love it! Happy Halloween Dave!
Dave at about 1:49 you lost me. lol. Boring. Stupid. Simply not interesting to me. 👋
if you dont have those acrylic letters, just carve a letter into the pumpkin. Save money
I could of use a sharpie and write happy Halloween then shine a light on the front of the pumpkin.
Another hand picked trending video by yours truly, Susan. \n\nPretty neat, huh?

I did always wanted to know how Jason knew where she lived. I been waiting for a answer since I was 5 years old. I'm 23 now.
We need Everything Wrong with The Emoji Movie
What’s wrong on Friday nigga?
No, sins taken off for the aaaaawesome titties?!
When ever this channle makes video on moives I like, I put really big quotation marks around the word wrong in my head
This is very true most 1980s movies are very slow to get started
Is it just me or dose anyone else hate how he talks
You guys should do everything wrong with Sky High!
Alice is in camp crystal lake if you hear her talking too her mom you hear her saying about confront in her fears.
I think Part 7 is one of my favorites. Psychic chick is badass.
Jason influenced the holding a gun sideways bs with his upside down knife. Maybe chinese gangsters held knives like that in 70's movies.
Oh s*** it's on thirteen on trending plus it the Friday the thirteen
Do better watch out next!
I commented wanting this exact video like two days ago
Yay, it's Friday the 13th =)

I was very scared of this guy when I was a kid.
Is it bad that I laughed at, I sense pee behind me?
I feel you are not at all taking into account how old this movie is and how thousands of movies since have copied it. It's like listening to a crabby millennial critique a good punk band. Done watching these videos.
Totally thought this was the second part of a longer video.
I thought his mom used black magic to revive Jason
It's 13 on trending :o
you gotta do the rest of em!
Number 13 on the trending page on Friday the 13th
In the spirit of October and Friday the 13th do an Everything wrong with Freddy vs. Jason. Please.

Amazing , well done Nile xx  hair looks sick when it's down by the way

Another absolute phenom vlog!  I literally cannot get through a Nile vlog without a giant grin on my face.  Him and his friends/family just bring so much joy to everyone.
Cracking comeback after the injury, mate. Was rooting for you and delighted to see you made the world championships. Looking forward to see much more of your journey, Nile.
I've been a fan for a long time and it makes me feel so good to see you succeed and be so proud of yourself!\n\nEdit: Wow, that was really cheesy
Honestly, I need a GIF of you and your dad dancing 😂🙌🏼
So happy for you Nile, just found out your channel today! It feels strange to see all these talented people reunited in my hometown but at the same time it's great!\nCongrats again for both the finals and how you pushed through this year~
Congratulations hunni, amazing xx you smash it every time xxx
So cute when he says.... Y'all right.
Train hard,  Keep it real = 6th in the World Championships.  Fantastic result after a year of challenges.  Well done Nile.

The thing I love about your videos is that everyone is having so much fun.
We could hear your dad yelling Nile. every time you competed all the way back to the  USA. lol.    We could hear him yelling Nile in the back ground of other gymnasts in the go.  \nYou must be one man-of-steal, coming from the back of the pack to the top 8.  Congrats.
So happy for you, keep up the amazing work.
Dude! Caught you on the coverage. Surprised my dad knowing stuff about men's gymnastics. It's all down to you! I know the scoring system and also how far you've come! Didn't know that 3 months ago and it's all down to you!!
Your dad and you are my favorites haha. Thanks for keeping it real!
You'll be on that podium in Tokyo:)
So happy for you 🎉
Well Done Nile and GB Team Brilliant

nice one Nile!!!!
I won National for Taekwondo and I’m in Kang’s Taekwondo. Now I’m National champion,but I can’t go to world because I’m not old enough. I’m only 8 and I’m supposed to be 12!
Nile I’m state champion in gymnastics Australia,Queensland
Is it just me or do Nile and Max not get along?
What does it take to have a physic like yours Nile? Diet, training routine, and cost?
Congrats Nile! Killing it and inspiring. I actually liked this time though cos of Purvis' freestyle.
Nile how did you like Canada? And did you like us Canadians?
Nile can you help tell me what to do iam 13 years old and 10 stone and hardley do exercise because i have no will power i used to do gymnastics and almost had a six pack when i was 10 but then i quit because i was getting bullied and put on so much weight but i have a illness that makes me want to eat more but i try resist but you have inspired me to try lose weight i love gymnastics and want to do it again what exercises could i do that arnt to hard for me to start of with but get me going to loose weight if you get this message pls reply me on this email Oliverjonbeevers@icloud.com
I always wondered what that thing is in his intro. Is it a computer mouse or something???
It's possible to start gymnastic at 16 years?
Looking at the classification, Nile matched the winning score for the horizontal bar, so would've shared the gold had he qualified and produced his same performance? Am I reading that right?
Who got 1st?
Too bad you didn’t metion some other teams, for example what happened to Epke with his one arm thing.\n\nNonethetless, epic bro, outstanding job. You will be nr 1 some day, I just know it!
Just got tickets for December 13th!
You can see that Rian Johnson loves photography, this movie looks beautiful!
So many goosebumps... 10/10 , I am watching this..
Farewell princess Leia, We`ll see again each other far, far away in the galaxy...
Hopefully it is not a dissapointment like the last one...\nI want to see some good fights............................................with Sayan powers xD
This shot with Phasma and Finn , just perfect . I hope that she will be more badass in this episode !
Wahoo! Seems like I've waited forever for this movie to release.
So Jabba the Hut will finally be released from the Carbohydrite?
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD!! I GOT GOOSEBUMPS XDDD
It would be nice to see her join the dark side.
Is it just me or, Kylo Ren looks like Severus Snape? The next Allan Rickman ehhh? hahaha\nProud Harry Potter and Star Wars fan here!
Lol,its the plural of Jedi because in German its Die letzen Jedi,and thats plural.SPOILER!
I came up with 2 theories they are in the scene were Finn is marching with the first order and the last scene Finn marching with the first order might be a clone (I got the idea from episode 7 when someone says they should just invest into a clone army) and Rey might try to learn force lightning and become a grey Jedi and stuff
“I need someone to show me a place in all this” *FLIPS TABLE*
It looks interesting having a different director and writer but the same characters
am i the only one who thinks the trailer spoils that kylo ren destroys the rebel base or not?
What's with the silly deformed gopher? Who's bright idea was that?
this is what we like to call...a juicer. this video was juicy?
tell me gies how hiped are you from out of ten
Oh dear, Home One is getting seriously messed up.  :(
Why am I watching this I don't even like Star Wars 😂😳
Leila will die (like she did in real life)
Star wars episode 8: Last jedi\n\nStar wars episode 9: Oh wait we found another jedi
Hell yeah fin vs captain phasma and AT-AT and Luke sky walker its like FLIPPING CHRISTMAS 🎄
she cuts his hand when he reaches out for her.
My eyes need to watch this now.
Snoke face for the win
Kylo Ren better not kill Leia my heart won't be able to take it !!!
John Williams is a god with the music 👌
why is she training? she's already a master of pretty much everything isn't she? all women are perfect, didn't you know?.
Well I wish they win
I’m not as enthusiastic about the franchise anymore. The videos of Mark Hamill bashing Star Wars has ruined it for me. So long, Star Wars.
If this fails I will be disappointed beyond belief
Is no one talk about Finn versus Captain Phasma?
That Goog, I Like It... best regards from bengkulu indonesia
I cant wait for December! ❤️
Oh my gosh did anyone else notice the blue hue of Rey's lightsaber matches that of A New Hope? AAAAHHH!!!!
Star Wars is da best
She looks like Dede from Surge.
Lol. Smoke is talking about Finn!! Like hon solo said call him big deal Finn is the key to it all.. He's Snokes chosen one
It’s really feels like the interpersonal level of Star Wars is gone, sure these movies are pretty, but the dialogue of the originals is gone.
hey guys so i'm in agony looking for a song but i don't remember most the lyrics or the name. I vaguely remember the name being happy song or sing a happy song. the one lyric i remember is she would come around at night or something like that. i would be so happy if anyone can find this song for me. thanks!
Why are you reading this comment
Luke’s line... “This is not going to go the way you think” \n\nSpoken to someone in the movie, or spoken to the audience? 😏
Oh boy it's time for revenge of the sith part 2; the return of the sith's revenge\n\nI just can't get excited for this movie, judging from the trailer it feels as predictable as all hell
I'm literally crying now i can't
So im guessing Kylo will not kill Leia leaving him in a kinda bad good situation and Luke will become evil making Rey doubt herself and probably Kylo and Rey are not gonna be good or bad they will be the balance to the force
This looks dumb

He's smiling while delivering that line. I'm not buying the idea that he was legitimately calling Harvey out here. It was more of a.. oh Harvey.. you silly man.
Honestly idrc not my problem, fuck hollywood and fuck those girls ✊✊
That’s sad they all knew but said nothing
Guess all that pizzagate stuff with just nonsense, right? Crazy conspiracy theorists!!! \n\nThese people sold their souls to the devil. They knew about it. They openly laughed in our faces about it. Now they claim to have some superior moral standing. 😒 Wake up people. It's right in front of our faces. It's been there.
Funny how everyone seemed to know but never did shit about it
LOL This shit is funny as hell...!!!!
So 3-4 years and people give a shit finally.
All these fucks are complacent with what Weinstein did and worse.
The audience laughed, they obviously got the joke. Disgusting.
*sees title*\nme: of course he did
Dont give heat to Seth.. it was the audience who laughed..
I’m glad he made a joke about it but it’s still just a joke. He didn’t really take a stand or make an actual comment. Why is everyone praising Seth for this and hating on Nathan Lane for making a joke straight to Harvey Weinsteins face years ago?
People acting like Seth is some sort of sage. Come on folks get real. It is very  well known among those who know the true nature of Hollywood that casting couch is a regular fixture. The people who are famous and rich in mainstream entertainment are in their positions because they had sex with executives, directors etc. \n\nAnd keep in mind Seth is apart of the sick playground that is Hollywood. He was supposed to be on the 911 flight but for some convineint reason missed his flight. In other words he either knew not to get on as he knew what was going to happen or someone advised him not to. \n\nThere were always rumours that Harvey Weinstein was a sexual predator. Look it up and you'll see.
... It 's just the fault of testesteron ...
He’s a talented, established Jew. Nothing to fear. (Actors and actresses are just professional liars and its no shock the whole industry and, indeed the whole society, is run by Masonic demons.) kudos to you Seth. They all enjoy your lewd antics. Oye vey!
What sort of world do we live in when a woman has to suck a fat producers cock to get a role? I guess the world we always lived in. I ain't justifying it, or saying it is right, but it ain't fucking news. These fat fucks were never doing it for the art, what the fuck did people think was going on? Emma Stone is famous for a fucking reason, she has got the carpet burns to prove it.
Nothing but white devils and evil....
They all knew, but did nothing. Some feminists they all are, fucking hypocrites. Dictating how we all should live and think. Hollywoods full of two types of people, pedophiles and children.
Props to Seth, real man right there.
“Make no mistake, this came from a place of loathing and anger.”\n\nMaking this so very very much the better.
Sure this guy knew, the audience would have moaned or been silent  if they didn't know, all these actresses knew they weren't the only one.....yet we're all suppose to believe that no one knew nothing.  None of the women would have been alone in a room with Weinstein, if he had no money, and they weren't trying to better their careers. They were using each other for their own personal gains.
These sluts sleep their way to the top and cry foul? Each one could've said no and tried to out him but chose the easier way to get rich. Whores!!!
A few things I want to say\n\n1.I hate it when people comment things in lists\n2.I hate it when people ask for likes\n3.I hate it when people edit their comments\n\n\nLike If You Agree
Andrew Breitbart calls out John podesta back in 2012 shouldn't this be news as well?
I saw Emma stone now I'm here.
Why did Harvey Weinstein contribute EXCLUSIVELY to the Democrats?\n\nWhat did a rapist pig like him want in return from the Democrats?
THE POWER OF PRAYER IS REAL and REPENT while we still can we are all NOT promised tomorrow you do that through Jesus who washed our sins on the Cross and rosed 3 days later, PRAY for forgiveness and ask him into your heart.
I got a good fucking feeling all these accusations where covered up for all this times because Harvey is a democrat donor....big fucking feeling...
You god damn evil fucking Democrats covered this up for decades.
Liberals are all f***** in the head with the divisive dangerous agenda
Hollywood is all about politics, drugs, money and sex!
Emma Stone looks like she just recalls her Harvey Weinstein experience.
That face at the end is like, Watch this in four years, trust me it'll be funnier.
Wow. He definitely was pissed about this. A very serious statement disguised as a joke...
Everyone knew it, that's how hollywood is

This mild joke is not calling him out
He knew. Didn't do a damn thing.
Proof the libt@rds like all the late night hosts knew about Weinergate yet did nothing. But hypocritically they go for an outsider like Trump. Im waiting for the pussyhats to come out again.
Seth Macfarlane and Russell Brand are my absolute 2 favourite celebrities OMG they are both so amazingly hilarious and straight up!!! <3 <3 <3 Thanks for being real Seth!!!
Haha every one of these rich whores have been tasting the guys cock for decades
What else can u expect from Zionist jew hollywood Elite weinstein? Typical crook. Its in their holy book.
He sounds like Brian from family Guy holy shit
Look at Emma Stone. She tries really hard to keep that smile after that line . She probably had abit of that Harvey too 😂🤢
Interesting, isn't it, that the so called shitlords like MacFarlane were the ones calling him out while all the pious folk did nothing and let it go on.
next EXPOSE=PEDOPHILES...cnn going down first.
Surprised he was able to figure it out. Think your crude shows and movies might have something to do with promoting a culture of sexual promiscuity? Of course, when you're stupid enough to be an atheist, that's a sign you're not playing with a full deck.
See you there soon xx
And the group of people in that room spent the next four years lecturing the rest of us on morality, while they all allowed serial abuser to remain in their midst.
Russell Crowe and Matt Damon prevented an article being published about Weinstein back in 2004. They should make a movie about this where all the actors play themselves
Wow.theres not even an hint of a joke in wot hes saying.fucking good on him
Its funny how everyone knew but stayed quiet...Now its recorded and everyones like.............\n\n\n\n\nWHHHHAAAAATTTT?
- - - - - Wow. What a low-life cesspool of scum-bag hypocrites. They’ve always known.\n.
Actress=bunch of pretentious porn stars. At least porn stars are honest and have way more integrity than these hooker. Lol. Role models my ass
Keep this up, we need to get these scum out of power
And no one in holllywood knew except for the countless lawsuits and police reports and jokes on Weinstein assaulting women
Meanwhile the entire room thinks it's OK to support a religion that believes in genital mutilation, child marriage and violence against women because it's politically correct to do so... pathetic Hollywood !! You're all a bunch of fake hypocrites !!
Crazy how they allowed his creepy behavior for so long shameful

All the dislikes in this video are from liberals who support molestation
Guys, I don't think he's joking
Quagmire is based on Harvey weinstein

Harvey weinstein and donald trump are one in the same... but lets pretend all the comments here arent political bullshit... hypocritical agenda driven sheep. \nWake up
Family Guy is dead.
He sounds like Brain from family guy lol
I cant stand liberals, especially Hollywood liberals, but Seth might be the only legit liberal in existence, the guy called out this pervert in 2013, and at the freaking OSCARS.\n\nMy respects to this talented and sincere artist.\n\nBtw, the same assholes that now act all outraged, are the ones that put Seth on a black list (he is not hosting the Oscars ever again) for things like this
As usual, I underestimated how long the podcast would take to upload, but it's already available at www.showmakers.fm, and will be on the youtube channel soon.\n\nPlease check out Brilliant too, it's a fantastic site and fits my channel perfectly: http://bit.ly/2xDcRNe
I was astonished when I learned that the Zumwalt destroyers are diesel powered. What a tactical blunder. Modular nuclear reactors are by far a better solution to powering an all-electric ship.\n\nAlso these rail guns seem like a pretty big waste of money in the era of anti-ship missiles.
You know nothing.... Jon Snow
Bae systems
I LIKE TRAINS!!!!
America’s gay
Cool
antimatter powered railgun
0:37 BRTTTTTTTTTTTT
The current durability problem. Ha!
Talk about nuclear reactors
too much advertising... ☹

Halo reach MAC cannons? Hell yeah!!
Hell yeah, railguns
You’re accent enrages me
Would a superconductor do away with all that frictional heat? Also, would not killing people do away with needing to come up with clever weapons?
Could one launch a tiny satellite into orbit using rail gun technology?
How about not shoot each other? Just fund space science properly and call it a day.
a real life MAC gun from halo
I like some of the other applications of thos tech but it seems like surface to air missiles and drone strikes are way more effective as comes to war.
Awesome like the one in halo 5 lol
Larger versions of rail gun in space to defend earth from asteroid?(HALO)
by the way barrel boring and barrel riffling are different, they are not the same. barrels rifled has a huge accuracy and precision advantage over bored barrels but in exchange for a loss in velocity and penetration factor.
americans are so creative!\n\n\n\n\n... in making weapons...
>Thinking what the US government shows us is the best they got
Top Notch video. Very enjoyable from start to finish 👽
How about compared to Athena?
Weapons of the future will be projectiles that are shot from space that are already above the intended target. Good luck intercepting that.
Wrong!\n\nthe 16/50 Mark 7 is still more powerful that the particular rail gun we have ATM.\n\nall though a rail gun of equal magnitude would be far more powerful which is what we need.\nBRING THE BATTLESHIPS BACK!, 100 TONNE RAIL GUNS THIS TIME!
We have better weapons.
Very interesting video, but the narrator sounds chronically out of breath for some reason.
now THIS is quality YouTube material. Thank you
Is it possible to use a step up transformer to provide the required electricity
4:46 what city is that in the background? looks like San Diego?
MY GOD IT'S A FUCKING MASS DRIVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If we had giant rail guns orbiting around earth, it’d literally be Halo IRL
What if you used a giant railgun to launch an orbital asteroid killing railgun to space :D... wouldn't that be weird.
3:47 to 4:00 are the M289 sabot round that the M1 Abrams uses, not the railgun.
Same dude who did escape from mount stupid
Can we load the barrel full of weeaboos, bronies, millenials, liberals, democrats, antifa, illegals, and kim jon-un....and then fire it into the sun? JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH BETTER THIS WORLD WOULD BE!!!!    =)
What's with this foreigner talking about our military secrets???
Still not fast enough to shoot a warhead traveling at mach 20 (25,000Km/h)
NO.\n\nTHIS IS NOT ENGINEERING AND DOES NOT WORK.\nNEITHER DOES THAT GUN.\nTOTAL WASTE \n\n....NINJAOA
This video was 100 watched by at least 1 foreign power
What about using giant railguns to launch spacecraft into orbit.
Do you really think HAI's vids are boring?
These look like the aa guns in cod infinite warfare
How about getting hit in the face with one of those OUCH
guess we'll see japan and US team up and a result will be a super-battleship with laser AA and railguns
Wait but they are recoilless right??
Is it just me, or did every science/engineering channel on you tube suddenly get funded by Brilliant at once?
Kami Kazé (神風)\nThis actually means Divine  Wind, Like a divine wind that is coming to do what's right.
The most powerful gun is the one you don't know about
THIS IS OLD SHIT
Why were you shooting into Angola? Sure they’re commies but... the didn’t do anything. 1:31
That's the sign that God does not want us to make weapons
All I can think about is Metal Gear Rex
Published on the US Navy birthday, go you!
Of course, there's a certain advantage to not having to worry about having your guns all made useless by an EMP, so I don't see the old method being entirely phased out for awhile
Weaponized autism is without a doubt, the most powerful and dangerous of them all.
U mean most powerful gun in the world?
Brilliant makes you think like an engineer?... so, like, approximate everything?
The US military's most powerful weapon - Donald Trump's mouth
I'm in agreeance with everything except the ability to [shoot-down] asteroids !!! ... Last time I checked,  Average speed for one of them is somewhere in the vicinity of Mach 20 (13,000+MPH) ! ...That would be like throwing eggs at an F-16 !
I felt like if China is working on this technology as well
its simple just do repulsion than attraction and the missile will hover between the two rods without touching . i'm guessing..
I wonder if you could use a conductive laser beam to impart a generous high voltage- high current discharge into a target?\nJust wondering.
*I lived in Hawaii, I lived on Pearl harbor, and I got a tour of the USS Arizona and It had three rail guns on the front of the battleship*
most powerful that's not top secret
When the US Military's most powerful gun is made by BAE..
Navy has more or less decided the wear issue isn't actually an issue. Barrel wear is only a problem if you are making very expensive barrels, or it is exceedingly difficult to replace the barrels (meaning they have to go back to port). The truth of the matter is that ONR realized that the rails in a railgun just have to be two pieces of metal that can be electromagnetically charged. Anything else is just gravy.
OMFG the A10 most beautiful Plane ever made!
What a waste of time.
5:08 ayyyyy i was just on that ship
is a massive generator any better than a ammo cache?
How pathetic! Surely the great superpower U.S. can develop laser weapons like the ones that were used against us in CA to create those so-called wildfires.
This reminds me of Stonehenge from Ace Combat.
This is great intel for ISIS
Giant rail run with an anti matter armature would legit destroy the planet
I know you're thinking about this Transformers scene:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUusHbKEji4
Send a rail gun to space... with a rail gun. Brilliant😂
Learned a lot more from this then I did from Otacon...
can you do a video on coil guns and why the military don't use them instead of railguns?
I was going to sign up with Brilliant, But once i got there i realized its priced a bit outside what i can budget currently for a fun gimmick site  (as in, a site i will use as a hobbyist user, not as a student, or processional exc)\n\nIts a shame too, because i can say its actually really nice, I messed around with some of the introduction tests (Free to anyone to try.... you should) and i actually quite enjoy it.... i didn't expect that going in.   If my financial situation ever manages to crawl out of the depths of hell I will defiantly be coming back with a subscription.\n\nSorry, comment is completely unrelated to the video subject, but i felt the need to say it.
How would you deal with the recoil from a massive in orbit railgun?
4:39 And that's why the US is so shit. They rather spend all their money and time building shit like that than education or healthcare.
If only humans could learn to see the pitfalls of their ape brains and stop killing each other over rivalries about land, money and power.
I thought the Knife hand was the deadliest weapon on the military.
Why not use this technology to benefit the common man around the world instead of it being used as a weapon of destruction. Pray for all parties involved, friends and our “perceived enemies”.
Nothing compared to my nerf guns
Kim Jong Un is taking notes
It was SS John Burke, not USS John Burke.
This video was not about The US Military's Most Powerful Gun. It was about a prototype weapon. Also, as a college sophomore this was way over my head all I got out of it was electro magnet... I still don't understand how a rail gun works. :(
Magnets ... How the fuck do they work?
I don’t understand why this is on the trending page but I’m studying to be an engineer so I’ll let it pass
Sps sps spsssss sps slack spslack
Boring video
Macklemore's version had a lot more fur coats.
I bet Trump will tweet that rap thinking it is in support of him.
What kind of coops we're those in the background? (to the right specifically)
😂😂get a proper job😂😂
Sorry, had to change it from 666 dislikes.
Watch Em not take this lightly aha
I forgot to do you as an impression. Damn
Is this all YouTube is now, just a lefty, liberal diseased platform?\nThis crap and pointless women, make up video's. \nPlease to all libtards and lefty freaks; paper cut your eye's open ffs.
This new trendin' genre spoken word with a pre-recorded base that's harassin' us since the '90s is gone too far! Now it's even without pre-recorded base, it's just spoken word!
Sometimes I feel bad for Macklemore cause noone says his name right
I don’t know if I’ve enjoyed a literal minute more in the last year. Solid gold
i get that it was scripted but what the fuck was this??
Subsribe me i will subscribe i back
Woah, woah, woah.... Slim shady, take a rest, old man. Catch your breath before you keel
Oh look Fake Fox News is not getting that covered !
ageing washed up has been. just retire old man you are embarrassing yourself. from Australia with love.
that guy looks promising. I think he'll go places
Is that Macklemore? - I died.
Oh man, Yellowwolf really let George Bush have it in that freestyle!
More like Kevin Durand Trump Dis.
shit skit
lmaooooo
Dammmmmm throwing that shade
Eminem thinking he's black.
will the real macklemore please stand up please stand up
I have deleted scenes on my channel too :D
eminem broke? (((they))) are getting desperate...
Why are those Black gentlemen just staying there? DEAD! 😂😂😂😂
When did Slim become parody of himself!! Edgy stuff LOL
You know your terrible when even Rappers feel comfortable mocking you
out of touch middle class, funny
Aw man, I was expecting them to honk more and Eminem would tell them Fuck You! What a missed opportunity
Eminem being used by Hollywood to distract people from being disgraced by Harvey Weinstein.
Watch Trump tweet  loser eminem is failing and he has low ratings.
All of these idiots saying Trump is unqualified because he hosted the apprentice and now they want an ex-addict washed-up rapper just because he agrees with them...has all logic been lost?
Who's Macklemore? Never heard of him.
Im really glad that guy is working for Colbert. He was one of my favorites on Conan
so now that em bashed Trump, the faggot left is cool with that. Back in the day I remember when Eminem ripped on homosexuals and was against exactly what's he's doing today. you cockroaches will never succeed in life and even after death. the joke is on you useless fucks.
I have no clue what I just watched.
I wanted the horn beep to be timed to censor some of the lines with cussing in them, that would've been fantastic. You missed your one shot, and that opportunity comes once in a lifetime
That's no Macklemore, that Vanilla Ice obviously! The nerve of some people...
True, Em is eerily quiet on Trump compared to Bush.
Come on now, that ain't Mackelmore... that's Dan Smith from BYU.
Macklemore > Traffic
SALUTE! ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
What a joke
They totally clowned him.
I love Evanescence!
lol
Lol
Where did his windshield go?
Where's Skittles ?
So this is what Vanilla Ice has been up to all this time.
Bruh lmao
Kkkkkk
Em is whack
Run him over......
This is stupid...
Just ruined a freestyle rap congrats
Lmao
its g-eazy
funny.
Slim dickhead , fookin spotty little Herbert, slim anus fookin dick!!
Cringy.  What is this ? Snl
Idiot
He sounds right cunt on this
What car company is *LS SC?*\n\n\n                 ⬇\n\n\n\n\n\n*Late Show* with *Stephen Colbert*
BRUH! This freestyle have Trump supporters, you knowcloset racist so mad. They calling him everything but a child of god. That goes to show you like Trump said QOUTE: I can shoot a man in broad daylight and not lose 1 supporter might even gain a few. Trump called men expressing there rights sons of bitches but has yet to condemn the Las Vegas mass murderer if PEOPLE TRUMP supporters is the problem they will not call Trump out on one of his lies! That my people is SCARY ASF? He even lost the VOTE but all you hear is he won? That's like the Patriots winning the Super Bowl but lose cause the NFL P.A. said no we're giving it to the Browns JUST CAUSE. This my folks is why we should not vote next election everyone in America cause obviously they gone pick the candidate who will distract the American's the most why they do there dirty work.
I was waiting for Stephen's reaction to this 😂
My comment was NOT edited
My apologies for the long post... had to get a few things off my chest.\n\nStill can't understand (for the life of me) how/why Black folks are quick to take knees; whine about Republicans/Conservatives/Trump/Police; how poorly (they think/feel) 'The White Man' is/has been treating them (while begging for their attention) and White Supremacy but quickly OVERLOOK ALL of THAT whenever they get the attention they CRAVE/BEG for from White People. \n\nThese fickle Black folks will show love to ANY/EVERYONE who panders to their feeble 'struggle/opression' Group Hive think and will IMMEDIATELY vilify/try to destroy anyone (other Black folks included) who break away from that fatuous mentality and/or chooses to think for themselves... Damn shame.\n\nOne last thing... These athletes/celebrities who constantly whine about the POTUS are weak. Whenever they're given an opportunity to meet him face-to-face to address their concerns, they act like BRATS, refuse to meet with him (runaway) and choose (INSTEAD) to name-call/disrespect him on social media. ALL because it's cool and will get them clicks; likes; retweets; reposts; followers and attention. They're NOT role models/revolutionaries/leaders, they're 'Hive Think' FOLLOWERS and COWARDS.\n\nThey're not looking for solutions to problems, they're looking to stay in the good graces of their 'Group Think' peers and fans. All they do is WHINE about 'stuff' (built upon emotions) but FAIL to BRING LOGICAL SOLUTIONS to ANY of it. \n\nKneeling about 'stuff' (WITHOUT ACTUAL LOGICAL SOLUTIONS) DOES NOT bring about solutions it just brings about attention to kneeling.\n\nHow about we focus on teaching our children to become doctors; lawyers; scientists; engineers; teachers; public officials; police officers; fire fighters; politicians; business owners; entrepreneurs and the like INSTEAD of Entertainers (i.e. Rappers; Actors; Athletes and the like)?\n\nHow about we teach and show the IMPORTANCE of education, ownership and growing LEGALIZED wealth in order to better one's self, family and/or community?\n\nHow about we WORK to improve our neighborhoods? How about we demonize/vilify the drug dealers, gang members and people (INSIDE) who are ACTIVELY/CONSTANTLY/DELIBERATELY DESTROYING our communities? How about we WORK/FIGHT to remove THEM?\n\nNAW... Let's keep kneeling and blaming EVERYONE ELSE INSTEAD. YEAH, that makes MORE sense; that's the solution.\n\n'Butthurt' Group/Hive Think individuals... Feel free to childishly insult me with You Bitch Ass Nigga; House Nigga; FuckBoy; Race Traitor; Coon; Token; Troll; Black Impersonator; White Boy; Agent and/or whatever insult I forgot in 3... 2... 1...
that bitch in the car is ugly as fuck!
was this supposed to be funny? you failed
The wigger queer looks like he's got Aids
Are we supposed to believe M&M hangs out in parking garages?
Lol comparing eminem to macklemore really now, I mean I know it's a joke but eminem legacy is immortal, he's among the greatest
Do people even still listen to Macklemore?
Hey guys we almost have a 50 subscribers! Help us get it 🙌
Embarrassing just totally embarrassing. \nNo flow, time to retire Em. I loved ya back in the day. But it's time to hang it up man.
Eminem is cringe !! 😂
Excuse me!
Has Eminem dissed Weinstein?
One migrant offspring moron bigot dissing another migrant offspring moron bigot
That was lame af lol
Eminem is worth 10 Macklemores. Just saying 😝
bubble currency resistance online magazine busy race clinical.
what emi rap trump ?
those black dudes woulda beat his ass
Ashamed you called him macklemore
Cuckbert
Rap doesn't matter
Urgh, how is this show still on tv...? It's fucking propaganda bullshit... Same with Fallon, Kimmel - all that shit.
this is the most unfunny thing I've ever seen
racism at its finest liltle jewish cunts
fucking wank stains
Keep pushing the bullshite libtards
I am personally offended by this
I hope this isn't undermining what Eminem did. I hate Rap but I can get behind Eminem on this one.
How is this comedy this isn't funny at all
Hi I’m Eminem. I became famous by being a drug addict who constantly made songs about murdering women and raping my mother. My political opinions are rational and well thought out though.
2:57 😁😁😁👌👌👌
She doesnt really include olive skintones.. i have the hardest time finding foundation. And no nutural doesnt work for me either. If anyone have recommendations pleeeeease
You knew you’d be applauded for making special mention of men and makeup. Nothing is stopping men from wearing makeup. I came here like most, to relax and watch a makeup tutorial. Instead it’s like everywhere else you turn- politically charged and obsessed with political correctness at every point where it can be mentioned.
Would love to know what you think about the new Nars Luminous weightless foundation and how best to apply it!
What colour foundation did you go for Nic?
I love the look you did with it. I haven't seen anyone else use the highlighters as eyeshadow or lipstick
I like the way you do makeup - I don't understand contouring the forehead though.  It just looks like everyone has a dirty forehead.  You don't of course.
The foundation made me break out in little red spots (not pimples/active acne, almost like an allergic reaction as opposed to a breakout) but I really liked the way it looks when mixed with a luminous foundation for my dry skin - I used Koh Gen Do Aqua and the two seemed to play nicely together. If anyone's bought the foundation but has dry skin and finds it isn't working but also own a liquidy dewy foundation try mixing the two!
I have really dry skin and the formulas just did not work for me. I got the foundation as soon as it was released because of the color selection. I have a strong yellow undertone that is hard for me to match. The foundation and primer just made my skin look even dryer. I looked like I had more texture then I actually have.
Celebrity make up . I shall pass
Please review Le Mètier de Beautè. I am very curious on your feedback for a high end brand.
Thank you for always including us darker skin girls in your reviews and recommendations.
I'd like to see a tutorial on Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes.
Fantastic review Nic! Always enjoy listening to your honest thoughts and loved the look💗
I love how even in low light you can see that Nic has really beautiful and well taken care of skin, not just throwing some moisturizer on like most gurus who sctually have awful skin without their 1000 watt, full coverage and filter trickery.
Looks great nic.  Would love your opinion on Glossier.
I love but please cut down on the Botox your eyebrows didn't move the whole video!
Could you do a nyx review/tutorial.  I have not used there stuff but have heard good things about it. Also I have extremely pale skin with really dark under eyes. What would you do with that as I have never found a concealer good enough? I love your video. I like how real you are. Keep it up.
This is by far the best review of Fenty Beauty that I have seen so far. 👏🏼
I wasn't sure when I saw it at Sephora last week, but now I want absolutely everything in this range! My poor, poor bank account! lol Thanks for the review, Nic!
Thanks for the review Nic, I love how you showed the versatility of the products unlike the rest of the video reviews.
You're 37 ?! Wow, that's goals aha x
Great review,\nCould you review the Claudia Schiffer’s ?\nThx
This video showed me how much lighting & editing make a difference in makeup videos....the line doesnt seem that great without heavy editing?
I would love to see a review of the new Pat McGrath Labs shadows and liners!
aw I love how you have Tanyas  Burr\ns book in the background
lighting is a little bit dark!
Love your makeup looks, but could you do more makeup looks on brown eyes please! Your eyes stand out a lot with makeup especially because they're light, it takes effort to choose a natural/ish look for brown eyes. Kim Kardashian does this beautifully at the moment, but I can't seem to create the look or pick the right shades. Would love a video on that. Thank you! <3
Just started watching you! You are lovely x I am 37 also. I really enjoyed this review. I learnt so much thank you 💕
Thank you for this review! I find you such a warm person and endearing to watch! X
I really don't like the drying effect of liquid lipsticks either. A video on your favourite lipstick would be fab ❤
Best review of the products!!! Now I want everything 😭💸
I would love to know the brand and formula your colourist uses. Gorgeous dark hair!
I'm 37 with a little mature skin ..... 🙄🙄 Me thinks most 20 year olds had skin as beautiful as yours sister 😘
What shade was the fenty foundation? 😊
Would love to see a review of Kiko Milano products! x
Is trophy wife eye shadow? I thought it was a highlighter.\nAlso you look stunning!!! With and without makeup :)
I actually love how talk about products you think would be really nice on darker skin. You don't get that a lot in tutorials/tester videos. Absolutely impressed with your openness
Great video as always as with the other comments I'm reading it's so refreshing to see a video on real skin without auto -tuning your face, I would like to see the ordinary foundation also and an updated affordable (drug store) dry skin review for us that have to watch out pennies - my face tends to crack on the cheeks in cold weather thank you xxx
I really wanted to see someone use Rum on the eyes!
Love it 😍 Fenty makeup is next on my list of products ... thank you for your videos I love watching them and your brushes are the best 👌🏽💋 xxx
Love what you said about men wearing makeup.  Recently did my boyfriends makeup for a laugh and he loved it! Just a shame that makeup is frowned upon on guys.
Awesome review! Thank you, it's the best Fenty review I've watched so far. \nI'd like to know what you think about Urban Decay: I love their products but you don't seem to love them too much, since I rarely see you use them... I'm just curious, so perhaps a review on UD? :)
Lovely video!! I would really like a review on KIKO cosmetics and specificaly their permanent line please!
Glossier review please for a slightly more mature woman 35+...thank you 😊. Love your reviews ❤️ Xx
Will this be the lighting used going forward when reviewing make up lines? I very much hope so.
Would love a Tanya burr makeup review!
I liked the liquid  foundation on your skin better. Rather than the stick side. But as always, you’re gorgeous!
LOVING the not so bright lights! you can see how the makeup is really looking, please stick with that
I think I'm the only person in the world that didn't like the lip gloss! It just looked clear on me. 😢
I so appreciate the more natural lighting, Nic.  I think many of us feel alienated when we watch videos where the person's skin texture is totally bleached out.  You still look absolutely gorgeous, but you look human.  Beautifully so. X
Hi Nic, nice Fenty Beauty review!\nSince you asked, would you please consider reviewing Kjaer Weis products?\nThanks a lot and keep up the good work,\nEve from France
I really like the look of the blotting powder. can it be used as a setting powder?
absolutely love you so much!
I don't think this was fair review. You said you adjusted the lighting so we could see what the makeup really looks like on your skin, you normally have bright lighting so perhaps you should adjust the lighting so we can what every product you review really looks like on your skin.
Brilliant video. Would love you to review the new Bobbi Brown exclusive to selfridges sparkle palette. X
a glossier video would be amazing seeing as they just started shipping in the UK!!✨
You made these products look fantastic on dry skin. I’m returning the foundation. It settled into my fine lines and dry patches.
Glossier! I would love a review of that.
Such a pretty look!  Great tutorial!
I love how you used the shimmer sticks and powder highlighters on your eyes, the finished result is stunning! X
Very nice review, as usual! But I think the ones you called eyeshaddows are not eyeshaddows but highlighters.. obviously you can wear them as a eyesahddows as well but just saying :)
I would love to see the NARS Man Ray collection reviewed! :)
I’ve been in love with nic for years love all your work
It’s so refreshing to see a tutorial with ‘real’ lighting instead of 4 ring-lights making everyone look pale and doesn’t show the true pigments of the makeup. \nThanks Nic, brilliant job 😘 xo
Could you do a review on clinque beyond perfecting foundation and concealer in one please love to know your thoughts on it. Great video as always
Come onnnnn you must have said “ginger minge” by accident just once
I found that the power highlighters looked cakey on my (normal/oily) skin. They swatch beautifully on my arm, but it looked like a clump of power sitting on top of my cheek bones. I used different brushes, my finger, sprayed my brush with setting spray, applied less product, etc. but no matter the technique I used, it always yielded the same result. I'm surprised so many people liked it. The formula was way too chalky for my liking.
Ive been waiting for this for so long!!!
Oh man. I was waiting for your review forever on Fenty Beauty and I REAAAAAALLY wanted to like this but I think it just didn't work :( a lot of mixed reviews on the products. Still prefer the VB Estee Lauder one you looked gorgeous on there :)
Fabulous Nic 😘😍 Absolutely love yours and Sam's tutorials 💕
This was a very fun show of the collection, im a bit surprised that you managed to put out a completely unique video after the craze of release, everyone was doing the same thing initially. It's funny, i didnt think about it initially, but a lot of these colors are very spring/summer to me, they look a bit odd going into fall
I think that men should feel included too because when men wanna wear makeup too, go for it. 💄 Gorgeous tutorial and love you ❤
Please do a mineral makeup tutorial 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I just love that you apply products however you want! Im so sick of all the youtubers doing the same boring contour routine, just with different brand every time...
I love the fact you have made the video in more realistic lighting :)

Hi hun, thanks for this review, I have ISSUES with finding MUF in my colour and I do like to test the foundation before buying them as you can imagine being the chocolate colour I am I wish people would understand how hard it is to find colours. I have the double wear in Sandlewood colour and still isn't right for me, I have reviewed the Fenty foundation on my channel (I promise this isn't a plug just so you can understand my point of view) \n\nThe Estee Lauder sandlewood colour is off on me, and its hard to find shades and then factor in undertone, anyway for the first time in MY life the Fenty foundation is PERFECT for me without having to mix two foundations, and I am not even saying this because it is Rihanna! But I wish people would understand that its not about how many shades, its also the correct undertones.\n\nI need companies to bring out a neutral undertone, a yellow one and red one while being the same shade because I could be the same colour as two other girls BUT have different tones.  \nHope this makes sense Love your channel! xx
Gurl who are you kidding?? Your skin is perfect and this is not medium to full coverage, it's no coverage at all, I can still see your redness, it's like you didn't put anything on your skin. The make up is shitty af why don't you say it?? You'll lose your commission??😎
Loved this review. Your skin is so incredible also. Also love this ponytail! What accessories did you use to create the bubbles?!
HOW LISA use TARTE shape tape: little touches here and there PEOPLE, HERE & THERE, not all over the face ☻
Hi Lisa, I really enjoyed this with Claudia, I’m a massive fan. I also made a video the other day on Claudia too. It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.
just look at this beautiful creature =) no botox and fillers... just plain gorgeous in and out ..   the most beautiful woman in the world!
Thank you for sharing the video, Lisa! I love how Claudia is so natural & classy and looking after herself after 30 years in fashion. She is comfortable & confident in herself that she doesn't mind showing us her lines, which we all have!!! Great to see her amazing self after being her fan for 25 years!!! Love Claudia!!!! XOXO
Anyone know where Lisa’s rings are from?
Claudia looks so sweet such a kind person
Yes, what a treat! My fave model of all time with the best makeup artist ever!
She is the most beautyful creature in the world. I adore claudia🌹❤️. Thankeyou, Lisa
It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)
I saw one of the OG Supermodels, I clicked
OMG how do you get one of the biggest supermodels of all time in your video?

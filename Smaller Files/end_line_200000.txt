Y'all Mother Fuckers need Charles Babbage..
Pick me ur cakes are awesome
Hermosa torta!
so, dogs trump blacks now. ¬†I'm with her. ¬†Fake service dogs are a problem. ¬†You can't bring your pet into restaurants. ¬†I wouldn't want to eat with a dog anus nearby. ¬†it IS NASTY and she's right, though she could have made her point in a finer way.
This lady is far from crazy. You all chose to post about a quarter of what happened. Here is a prime example of white privilege  as she was deciding to leave minding her own damn business, got in her face called her a racial slur along with several other white people who were already there apparently meeting the people with the dog. I'm pointing out the fact that they're white because of the racial slurs and how much this looked like some racist movie scene. Funny to call someone racist after you start crap and call them racial epithets. She had every right to get upset and at the end when the large male approached her I'm sorry but her husband should have stepped in and stepped right in front of her because he looked like he wanted to hit her over some racist cat fighting mess which was weak on his part. People need to start waiting until the full story comes out in these situations. They are trying to make her look bad but I think they did a good job of accomplishing the exact opposite. I will also never patronize a business that treats their customers like that. Black or white they should have seen past racial lines and escorted the sh*t starters out. She was already minding her business before being rudely approached with her young child right next to her. I commend her for standing up for herself. She probably felt very defensive. Shame on them. People need to understand this is not the 1960s or whenever and quit overstepping their boundaries. How in the hell do you walk up to someone just because they're choosing to leave and tell them that they have less rights than the dog. Ignorance at it's best.
the negro female is the absolute least desired female on the planet\nthey are angry by nature and must be loud\nboth in sound and attire
Where's her mama to set her straight. Ooo makes my blood boil. Why is her man letting her look bad like that too. Some man he is.
This woman is like this ALL day long, every day.
Dogs are filthy and shouldn't be in a restaurant. She is right about that.
ibe never seen a black woman get upset... Who knew they even did stuff like this? Wow, I'm super surprised
Just another dumb n**** they will never f****** get it
Everybody needs to step back and lets ask: What service does this enormous dog perform for this man. If it's a seeing eye dog or the kind that opens doors and the like then fine but most likely he's one of them people who register any old mutt as a comfort dog and that is bulshit by itself but he had to pick a dog the size of a small horse too. I would not scream it but I think if the dog is not really doing anything for you.. at a restaurant.. it can wait in the car.
I can see only one animal and is not the dog.
She's a pathetic piece of human slime.
Comment on the white woman that shot her dog in cold blood while the dog was chained on a tree for no reason and laughed about it!!
Thank God there wasn't another black female in that restaurant!.. Blood & hair would've been all over the place.
The calmness of the soldier was telling. But, what I took from this video. I just loved how profoundly calm the service dog remained throughout the entire event. His attitude, demeanor and service to his owner is the very reason he has the job that he has. I can't help but wonder what the crazy ladies  job is and if her boss is as proud of her as this service dog's boss is proud of him. Doubt it.  WHO'S A GOOD BOY? YOU'RE A GOOD BOY! YES YOU ARE! WHAT A GOOD DOGGY!
Good job to the man that finally told her to get the fuck out.
Put her back in her kennel......not the Dog.
B*tch sorry but I feel sorry for the dog I hope she doesn't have a dog wow it is over dramatic I hope that it doesn't happen again the guy old veteran deserves better. I got upset when she said so what I don't care  part I'm like what b*tch please let me see you after youv'e been to war\nAgain I'm sorry for using the b word
Many American women are walking advertisements for foreign dating....I could see a foreign dating service posting this video on their site....Avoid this,when you could have this (insert feminine woman here) WIN! American women have become straight up BEASTS....WHAT HAPPENED TO AMERICAN WOMEN???Seriously....What happened???
Looks like enough evidence to charge her with criminal trespassing.
Fucking bitch, that‚Äôs all I have to say, the old man is just so sweet.
Bitch. She's the one acting like an animal
. This is what i would have said Wow having a service dog. Im sorry lady i had know idea. Heres what ill do. If you dont get out in the next 10 seconds. Im going to break off one of your arms and give it to the dog as a chew toy
Can't figure out why they did not just let this low life, ignorant, scum of the earth leave. When she said she was leaving they should have said oh happy day, bye. and held the door for her.  She is obviously to ignorant of common laws not to mention, decent behavior to be out in public. note to her husband, keep this moron at home.
What a twat.  May as well argue about a wheelchair.  It's a service animal you idiot.
WHITE PEOPLE SURE LOVE THEIR DOGS MORE THAN THEIR BLACK PEOPLE!
She is a nasty pig!!!
Is anyone really surprised at this? Another black animal doing what they do....!
I'd rather share a meal with the dog, than some ratchet she-boon, to be honest.
If I was was there I would pet the dog and thank that man for fighting for our country in front of her...that crazy woman gave me a headache just watching this video...no respect for our troops
a lot of black people don't like dogs because dogs can sense evil.
lm bringing my horse into the establishment eat my meal an ride off into the sunset lol
I feel bad for her boyfriend. You could tell he wasn't on her side but what can he do?
I'm just here to learn more about their Low Country Boil.
I can see a  scenario like this  on the show called   What Would You Do coming soon now.
One of the two dogs in that restaurant is much more polite.
I would rather eat beside the dog than that animal
Oh my God. I would've even shamelessly ask the doggo's owner if I can sit with them so I can be closer to the big pupper
Love how her man is so cucked that he wont control his woman and how she behaves in public.
When your life is so easy the only thing you have to complain about is a service dog in a restaurant. Pathetic.
Stupid nigger. Stupid, stupid, she-boon. This is what generations of entitlement have brought us. No surprise to me. What I hope is that this video wakes up the milquetoast white Americans who still subscribe to white guilt.
I would have called the cops and had her arrested for disturbing the peace. maybe a fine and a night in jail would give her a new outlook
acts all fucking hard with her 6.5 foot hubby behind her , who clearly wants to just disapear , poor bloke XD
Sweet heart take your white husband home and shut up.
Gotta get my pup that cool vest so I can take him out to eat üçîüçüüíØ
Wait but aren't we  never mind
i would much rather share a meal with the dog than her...ratchet...!
I got PTSD by just watching this.
I kno y these honkies r honkin Jus bcuz yah ll smell like dogs wen ur wet doesn't mean u have to take up for them!!! they have to take up for their smell, but we r racist??? all these racist are typing nigger, some nerve crackers ass crackers!!!!
I will show You how does it look in Poland, with respect, not only to people but also animals specialy guide animals , whatever You heard earlier: https://www.sadistic.pl/czarna-nie-potrafi-zyc-z-innymi-zwierzetami-vt458207.htm\n1st comment with picture of woman drinking water After all, with one thing I said I agree - There should be a separate sector for fucking animals! - as in good old times\nthe second one \nNevertheless, the owner should tell her that the animals actually do not support and ask her out\nWe do not have problems with color of the skin, belives itc. but we do have a problem with their behavior, \nAmercians said that we are Poles most of us said that u idiots allowing such behavior, not only to the people who deserve the assurance of being This man, but overall if someone says I'm a racist (and I'm not) because I consider it something should be dug out of this place, and the guy who  This came should have enough intelligence in the head to pull that from there hair and toss into the gutter where it found something, \nWhy do not we tolerate immigrants who want to change our country to a zoo in what is America now? Those who want to live in a place where respect exists, we cordially welcome all nationalities, all skin colors if you can access our culture! We are not the rasists we just want to live the way we do :)
This stupid lady just made it easier for cops to beat the shit out of black ppl some mo! Unbelievable!
Many people, including whites, for many years were not racist nor  prejudice. However, it is the behaviour of many black people such as this one that are making people more prejudice against blacks. Often it is the black people  themselves that are causing an increase in racism and turning the clock back to increasing racism.. Its like black culture is decaying rapidly and its sad to see. I think the biggest culprit is govt dependency that robs many blacks of the need to work, which in turn robs them of their dignity and self worth, which leads to this video.  Kudos to all the hard working and successful black people that refused to let govt dependency enslave them.
I don't condone a man hitting a woman, but her ole man should have knocked her the fuck out!
That woman needs to be thrown in jail!
I think it's fucking DISGUSTING that she's complaining about a service dog. A service dog is by no means a regular pet. They are literally fucking TRAINED to help physically and mentally disabled people do what they have and want to do. This particular dog (it looks like a Great Dane) is a PTSD service dog, which are exceptionally special dogs because they help to comfort and bring peace to military veterans severely struggling with the mental scars left on them from WAR. Goddamn, I'm so fucking wound up right now. Oh my god this pisses me off so much. If I were there, I would have got right in her face and screamed at her to get the fuck out. She's what is absolutely disgusting.
or in the most simple terms...Jerry Springer comes to Delaware.... thanks lady you make all of us in Delaware look like trailer trash
Can anybody next time this nasty bitch comes in accommodate her in a spot on any corner with some water in a bowl and also covered with some newspaper in case she decides to do her thing... you know...LOL fucking BT1000
Her son is super embarrassed
Someone should have punched that bitch right in the mouth. Pure trash.
Shes black..she cant help herself..shes an animal as most black people are...
I'd rather look at the dog's butt than her fat butt in those gross leggings. I feel sorry for that husband, look at his face, he now knows the 'or worse' part of his wedding vows.
Her husband needs to take that shirt off, because he's a little bitch! Get a hold of your woman! I bet she talks to him like that all the time, pussy!
I don't like to eat around animals, either, but would eat lunch off this dogs back before eating within audible distance of her mouth. It is much more disgusting than ANY animal.
She seems to be suffering from PTSD as well, maybe she was viciously attack by a dog(s) as a child and see a dog is a trigger-Why did the works not call the cops to deal with this situation? I feel sorry for the man with her, serve him right for hanging with a hood-rat.
It is disgusting to have that dog in a restaurant, throw the black lady out. And as for the great dane, he or she is so precious and calm =']
Just another knuckle walker doing what knuckle walkers do best, causing misery for anyone anywhere near them.  Selma was a horrid mistake, the Civil Rights Movement needs repealed, and those Coons need sent back to the motherlands.  There's no civilizing those monkeys.
if she demand a different space for people with animals, there should be a different space for black people and white people like a good 'ol days.
I don't see a lady. I only see a wild hyena hoodrat.
She's NOW claiming they called her a Nigger before she went off, no one called you anything, but the ironic part is, you have more than PROVED your own INSULT.
That was her boyfriend? That fuck needs to grow some balls. Psycho can't be that great a blow job.
IT IS WHAT THIS SOLDIER DID FOR HIS COUNTRY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO SPEAK BITCH and  thank the LORD for the lady who is trying to calm everybody down she is the voice of reason in this crazy and absurd incident.
IMO, she was trying to bait someone into hitting her or pushing her out the door so she could sue. What a lowlife piece of trash. Why didn't the owner of the restaurant call the police? That would've shut her up right away. And who was the guy in the black t-shirt that hovered behind her? Not a friend or boyfriend I hope. If he is, he's as dumb as she is.
I'm sorry if this offends anyone but if I was in this restaurant at this time I would've smacked the black off her!! How dare her attack a vet over his service dog!! The dog acted better than she does!! But after 8 years of Obama this is what we get with this BS of BLM and all they're racist tyrants!! An entire generation of entitled minority's thinking they're word is law now!! Attacking a veteran or service dog or discrimination against them is a $75,000 dollar fine!! The staff should have called the police and had her escorted to the police station!! But with giving them they're way we now have them feel they make the laws!! Sickens me!! Too think my entire family fought for total douchebags like this to be free and enjoy the freedoms of our country!! She should be ashamed of herself and anyone that recognizes her anywhere should spit on this ignorant piece of crap!!! Unbelievable!!!!!!!
Typical black bitch: loud, rude, aggressive and crazy. I would prefer to eat next to kind service dog than this mad sick n%6%r
Is she own drugs? wow. she is nuts.
This is not a public restaurant, it's private property and she is invited to eat there. She is causing distress to the dog and other customers and disorderly conduct. Disorderly conduct is a criminal charge in most jurisdictions in the United States and certain other countries. Typically, disorderly conduct makes it a crime to be drunk in public, to disturb the peace, or to loiter in certain areas. Hope that she used her bank cards for her transaction together with that information and this video she should be arrested!! This behaviour of self entitlement has got to stop!!
The dog has a better behavior than that crazy woman... Shame on her, she can have her opinion but she is rude and she could express it in a different way and if she doesn't like to be close to to animals she can go and eat somewhere else
If that dog is listed as a service dog, it is illegal for any restaurant to deny service to the person that dog is servicing. It is a FEDERAL law that prohibits that, as well as a service dog being petted, played with, instigated or such. They should have called the authorities right away for starters. Then kept their mouths shut until LEO's arrived. Then show the officer their permit and paperwork showing/proving that that dog is in fact legally a service dog. At that point, they would have assessed the situation further. Lastly, the woman leashing the dog should have shut up even more once that beastly woman walked out the door the first time! She just HAD to say something!\nSeriously though, educate yourselves on what service dogs are supposed to be for. They are working 24/7.
the only animal is that nigga hootin' and hollerin
She's upset about a dog, that's probably cleaner than her.. mean while she's probably living in a welfare apartment loaded with cockroaches.. take a walk bitch..
She needs a solid punch to the face. As a veteran she is wrong and stupid.
...& her lame ass 'boyfriend' finally decides dealing with black pussy is just NOT Worth it...
The poor dude with her has a look on his face like he's been through this embarrassment with her before.  But that is one hell of a service dog to sit calmly throughout that mess.  Now she's claiming somebody said something racist to her off camera.  These kinds of videos - and those kind of excuses - are the reason we have such racial divides in this country.  No way that behavior is acceptable in ANY culture - black, white or purple.  Black folks (or anybody else) who take up for her are perpetuating the problem.
I have extreme respect for service dog bc they are well trained, respectful, and helpful to their owners.  Im sad the lady was disrespectful to such a hardworking dog = ( .  These dogs deserve a metal for helping with any human being in need of life assistance.   Makes me want to cry for that service dog being harrass w/ profanity and yelling.
what a stupid bitch!
Wut a dumb bitch
Another Crazy Black Girl,  Claims Racism
black monkey
Good, nobody wants to eat with that nasty foulmouthed hoodrat manly sheboon.

What a cunt...
monke y
STOP IT NOW!!!
ape went ape shit
It's a fucking DOG ,they lick their dick and ass every were and some owners don't bath their dogs and then they smell really bad ,at the moment you can't do nothing about a smelly dog in the restaurant but you have the freedom to leave and that's what the lady did until she got confronted by the dog owner,,,so who started the altercation ??
She right no dogs in a restaurant, who wants to eat dog hair?
The dog owner is a baby killer.He gets free drugs till the end of his miserable life.I don't want him in a restaurant.
BRINGING YOUR PETS INTO A RESTAURANT AND SLEEPING IN THE BED WITH THEM IS NOT NORMAL. THIS MAN WITH THE BIG NASTY DOG IS A DISSERVICE TO VETERANS WHO HAVE BEEN MAIMED IN COMBAT
This black bitch is so nasty and evil toward the veteran and his service dog.  The service dog has a right to be there in the restaurant.  What fantasy world is she living in??  Oh I forgot she is one of those crazy BLM Democrat liberal idiots.  People she needs to shut her stupid mouth up and in the future I would not let this crazy ass back in the restaurant.  Just like a BLM nut they thing they own your property and can tell you what to do, when to talk, what to think.  If someone had done this to me I would have slapped her stupid face off!!
The entire group of¬†MOB attacking an angry woman who was called an N word¬†(according to the¬†woman, she was called an N word). And the restaurant waitress acted like a TRASH by calling¬†the angry woman¬†B word before locking the door. How professional¬†?? Mob mentality, just¬†because¬†there are more of your, you felt entitled to¬†fight with¬†a¬†rude customer. ¬†Shameful !! All involved. No one is better.
I went to the match and there was barely anyone there in the stands lol

In two words explain what beautiful, kind, caring, sweet, supporting, friendly, gorgeous and stunning means \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTyler Oakley ‚ù§Ô∏èüëë
Best moment was when you came to Perth, Australia for amplify, I tweeted you and you tweeted back, I watched you on stage and continue you watch your videos every time you upload and have done for quite some time now. You've given me the strength to be who I am, and made me feel like I am important in this world. For that I thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I haven't been here from the beginning but you have inspired me to just myself in front of the world thank you so much Tyler
I will always remember the way you laugh. It always makes me smile.
I'm not even a regular viewer of Tyler and the onions are getting to me so bad rn
My first video was Chickens Inspired by Chickens, but I don't think I saw it when it was new, I don't think I've been following you for that long. I'm really happy that you're such a positive role model to the LGBTQ+ community. I'm not a part of the community, but I'm really happy to know that the community has you to be an example and empower them :]
I've only been here for the past about four years maybe? But you have really inspired me to come out of my shell and be who I want to be and who I am, my gay ass self! Thank you for everything, more than you know, making me laugh when all I've wanted to do was cry, and enjoy the next ten years, on YouTube or not! (ignore my name.....I made this account like five years ago when I was twelve... I highly regret it)
when i snuck into your perth slumber party meet and greet
Tyler, I hd no idea what youtube was when I was younger, I thought it was just a place for music videos. Until one day I was scrolling my suggested because I didn't know what subscribing to a channel meant either, but in any case, my suggested brought me to you. You were the first person I subscribed to on Youtube and some years later I still love your content. You have truly been such an inspiration and even though we unfortunately haven't met, I really feel like I've seen you grow in the best ways. I remember when you stopped dying your hair all the fun colors and I was sad but then I realized you were transitioning to your next phase on life and I loved to see that change and in a way be apart of that transition. I LOVE YOU, I'LL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU. I know you'll keep doing amazing things and continue to be a hugeee inspiration for anyone and everyone and I can't wait to see them unfold. ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è
His reaction when Joe Sugg came on-screen I'm still laughing üòÇ
Whenever I try to do an American accent you comes to my mind and I feel everytime I'm just doing a Tyler impression xD And ever since I saw your video talking about there's no glory in the process I have had it written on a post-it note and stuck it on my laptop. It keeps me going. Thank yous much Tyler.

Thank you for shining your light in this dark world through YouTube for 10 years! You've impacted our lives. You've made us all laugh and proud on various occasions. Your fans love you, and we cannot wait to see what's in store for you.
I've literally been here since the start and I've loved you since the beginning you have the quirkiest cutest personality and I wish I could meet you one day but if I did get to meet you I'd probably cry because you have literally helped people in their worst times feel like they are perfect the way they are, which they are so thank you for these 10 years you are the best
HAPPY 10 YEARS A MAY BE 4 DAY LATE BUT ILY can't wait till the next 5 years (is that ok)

Happy 10 year anniversary for your YouTube channel !

You're such an inspiration and I can't imagine what YouTube would be like without you. Scratch that, I can't imagine what life on Earth would be without you. You're such a radiating light in so many people's lives and I'm sure you will continue to be in the years to come. Love you and keep being yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è
I know this sounds really clich√© and stupid but you really did help me out of depression and taught me how to be comfortable being me so... Thanks Tyler! Congrats!!!
I always knew you'd rock the youtube world
i love this so muchüíó
I LOVE YOU BABE!!! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!
Loved meeting you at the slumber party! Congrats on ten years of making the world a better place ‚ù§Ô∏è
Been here 5 of those years. You've been with me from my awkward high school years to my slightly less awkward self. You radiate love and always try to inspire people to do the same. Thank you Tyler!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

You taught me to always be myself no matter what others think and that is the best lesson I have ever learned. Thank you so much for everything and happy 10 years!‚ù§Ô∏è
I have been here since 11k. üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ
i hate her channel but i always come back to watch more
My daughter can't drink milk but can eat cheese and yogurt
It's not that I didn't like the video, but I had to thumbs down it. Us Kardashian lovers don't take too well to hate lol
Even tho I'm white as hell even I was seasoning lol üòÇ
I thought she was going to say how much weight she lost tho
I really noticed tht u looked more refreshed & less dark circles around ur eyes. just really refreshed!!
Look really cute with your hair in the side ponytail (5:04)
They make soy sauce that is gluten free. Try Tamari
You actually look at lot like Courtney. I'm not a big fan of the Kardashians, but I do like Courtney. She's my favorite. :-)
You look just like Lily from Clevver style
Dude I thought this was a buzzfeed video, I know that she was in buzzfeed but the thumbnail was so much like buzzfeed's
It's like America - Kardashians .British -Queen
It was suppose to be Kourtney Kardashian not Kourtney Kardashian'S
after watching this, iv realized kourtneys diet is trash in all honesty. i would never eat like that. unhealthy af. and boring af.
Plugging it in helps lol This was a fun vlog! I love eating vegan, it is my favorite way to eat so far.
How is she dairy free when she eats eggs and cheese?
Mozzarella in her signature salad? Isn't she dairy free?
literally couldn't have half assed it more
Lol no one ever knows kourtney kardashian is or what she does
Tofu? Really ?? I'd rather ear heated up dog shit
Kourtney Kardashian is dairy free but eats cheese? That's a dairy product
i just saw that she works at popsugar
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS A BUZZFEED VIDEO FROM THE THUMBNAIL
One of my friends who is allergic to gluten told me that soy sauce that is produced in Asia is gluten free most of the times. Only the ones they produce in Europe (and probably the US aswell) contain gluten for some reason.
Was I the only one who saw the blender wasn't plugged in
Soy doesnt contain gluten but gives off a similar effect to gluten when ingested into the body... as far as I'm aware.
Your skin looks so much better after that diet!!
WHERE ARE THE CARBS?! I'd be starving on that little amount of calories and carbs. And I hope her kids get a higher carb intake as their brains need the glucose for energy for school etc.
7:23 YOU LOOK SO GOOD! You should do your makeup and hair like that more often
Ew how can anyone eat avocado like that!!! With chocolate?!
She's dairy free but mozzarella for lunch? üòü
Maybe I just haven't seen enough episodes but every time I see her eating on the show she's just poking her food around and having half bites and throwing most of the meal out. Not sure if following her recipes really counts as following her diet :p I'm not suggesting she's starving herself - she's eating very often, just only tiny bits at a time.
waits you actually look a lot like kourney (6 mins)
It's easy to be on a diet when you're a multi millionaire so you can buy all the expensive ingredients you need to be on one. It's expensive to be on a diet.
She can't be dairy free and eat a kit kat, wtf
There‚Äôs no reason to go gluten free if you don‚Äôt have to
When you talk your mouth moves like Kourtney's üòÇ
Oh that tofu shrimp stir fry looked so yummy! I think I'll add it to my meal plan for next week! I enjoy these videos about the different diets that you make they are so interesting xx
So annoyed that it unsubscribed me from your channel üôÑ
I'd love to see Khloe kardashians diet since it really seems to be working for her x
ok she is actually just like Callie Torres!
Please don't use the word minimalist to describe any aspect of Kortney Kardashian.
A week has 21 meals... where is the rest of your food?
In place of soy sauce use Tamari :) it‚Äôs gluten free and tastes the same #ShoutOutToTheCeliacHusband hahah
Keep getting unsubscribed from you :(
That intro gives me life cx
So is this diet like \nWater only \nNo dairy\nNo gluten\nNo soy \nNo life \nLike if you like Starbucks
How is she dairy free if she puts cheese in her salad lol
No thanks. I'll stick to real food which has actual flavour
Mozzarella cheese? But, I thought the diet was dairy free?
Just curious but it looked like there was a fair bit of dairy in the diet...
The gluten-free sandwich from Starbucks has CHEESE on it #dairy
Anyone wanting soy sauce, but is GF can get Tamari :)! It has a little bit more of a stronger taste as well...
where did you get the info on the diet?
Do you have mild rosacea? Only asking cuz your cheeks get a bit red!
Try this Tamari Soy Sauce - it is 100% gluten free and DELICIOUS. It has been my go to soy sauce for years, and tastes better than any other soy sauce:  http://san-j.com/products/organic-tamari-gluten-free-soy-sauce
I love your videos too but I do agree with a earlier comment I feel like you modified it just a little too much. Adding cocoa powder to the morning shakes changes it and takes away from the true Kourtney Kardashian morning shake. Again love you and love your videos but the modification was a issue.
Honestly, I can't even imagine what your body can actually handle at this point. You are constantly yoyo dieting, and I feel like you're not going to be okay if you keep doing this.  I'm not hating, because I know what it means to struggle with body image issues, but you need to keep your own health in mind.
@5:04 that LV phone case/wallet..... Happy for your success, but....be real.
Don't you know everyone is Gluten intolerant üòÑ  prob must naturalists etc will say your gluten intolerant...I say intolerant NOT allergic. I know a couple people that have celiac disease. One was like sick for years and losing weight until he got tested and found everything was caused from gluten. If you actually have Celiac you can/will get very sick from eating even just a little gluten. Reading labels is VERY important and leaning what words mean it has gluten (in ingredient list)
Finally someone else who can't stand tomatoes!!!! Everyone thinks I'm crazy but I can't even smell them let alone eat them!! ü§¢
isn't she an adult? why does she have a roomate?
I usually really like your videos, but you seemed very forced and kind of fake in this one. :/
There is a gluten free soy sauce called Tamari
You redid every single recipe. This doesn't count I don't get it?
A good filling breakfast for me is ah egg, 2 bacon strips and...u guessed it...a small avocado!  BTW...loved the voice-fracking...sounds all fracked up!  lol
I do not think that food processor at the beginning was plugged in....
You can use coconut amino instead of soy sauce. Its available in whole foods <3
I wish I could eat avocado. Glad she isn't afraid of fats though!
Try adding frozen peaches to the smoothie and I find it hides the earthy taste of spinach and avocado.
watching & hearing the blender for that morning smoothie was scary!!  PS would be good to add chocolate protein powder for taste & health.
could you try out the hard boiled egg diet?
Omg by 7:30 you actually LOOK like Kourtney K! üòÑ
uhm meat is not sustainable
YOUR HAIR
Ehhh... this video suck
Up your avo game kourt!
So awkward/cringey üòÑüòÇ
Aren't eggs dairy ü§î
Her eyebrows are very uneven
7:50 üòÇ the vocal fry
I like your positivity. Shines through.
Chicken soup
hemp milk....
omfg 7:50 xDDDDDDDD so good
What does kardashian fartface eats
No dairy? No thank you
2:57
Mozzarella is dairy..
mozzarella is not dairy free haha,
Moserella cheese is dairy...
5:05 stump stump stump stump stump
Isn't Mozzarella cheese dairy?
Do a kpop diet
Intro is toooooo long..
7:15 HAHAHA
I fucking hate tomatoes
eat like freelee for a week!
She‚Äôd be great for Buzzfeed. (This is a compliment.)
why she need to fast once a week?? it's weird
In most of the interviews mike and chester were together, fucking sad now Mike is alone and he's in pain üò≠
I can hear the pain in his voice, it's so clear... But that has only increased my love and respect for Mike. In spite of everything that has happened and how it affects him, he still talked to us. And not only through social media but now also on the radio. I can't even imagine how he - and the other guys&Chesters family of course - must feel. The fact that he reaches out to us is just... it's just downright special and emotional and ugh I don't even have the words. I'm really fucking proud of him, and I know that the LP family will always have not only his back, but also the other guys' and Chesters family their backs. One day at a time. We will remember Chester forever <3 Always in our hearts #MakeChesterProud #fuckdepression
It¬¥s like medicine to hear his voice again <3
Its Nice to Hear Mike Voice After 2 months.
If Mike ever sings that song himself there will be tears
Hey I'm thinking about you. I care. And sometimes that's enough.    Well.. Freaking true. It's so relieving to hear his strong words too, though.
It‚Äôs so hard to see that things are moving on without Chester, those 2 month felt kind of empty for me, and for a lot of people here i guess...\nBut it really helps to hear mike‚Äôs voice...\n\nThank you LPA to share this with us !\nDoes anyone know if there will be a live stream of the show ?\n\nAnyway, i think it‚Äôs such a symbolic date to honor his memory, just a few days after hybrid theory‚Äôs birthday.
Will it be streamed for those of us around the world. \nI would sell my kidneys and liver if it meant I could attend this event, but it's not possible for me. \n\nCome on, please there's got to be some way you could let all those who care to be part of it.
My heart goes to LP, the fans, the families, and everyone. Chester and all of LP have helped me and many, many of us through the years! One More Light makes me cry every single time. And I wish one of us could have reached Chester the way he reached us.
There's no way in hell it's been 2 months already since he's been gone.....omg.........
I sense the pain but fortunately he sounds calmed as well. I pray depression never gets you Mike, remember the love of not only your family and friends but all your true fans. Peace.
Who's gonna be singing chesters parts???
And a DVD/B-ray of this show just to be fair to every fans around the world
Is the concert also going to be send out live on YouTube or Facebook?  I really want to see it live.
Thank you so much for sharing this. As a fan the lost of Chester really hurt. I cannot begin to understand what his family and close friends are going through. :(
it is so nice to hear your voice Mike,i love you,Chester and Linkin Park  forever in my heart.
i wish i had the money and a way to go to Hollywood bowl for the memorial show
Chester's death was a very painful memory but I cant believe that Mike can hold in all that sadness
I cried during this whole interview.
So great to hear Mike in an interview like this. You can tell how broken up he is, but he's still keeping his head up. Good for you Mike. Stay strong, Shinoda. The fans still need Linkin Park. We need you guys.
Mike's voice never ceases to be medicine to my soul. Thank you, so much Mike, for being the strength for the fans and the genuine spirit who never stops caring. Who cares if one more light goes out? Well, WE do!!!
Really hope they live stream October 27th üôè
Who were the 24 people that disliked this?
You can feel the change in the way he talks.... :(
I whis I could come to the consert but it to far away.
the great thing about this interview is that you didn't ask any specific questions about the passing of Chester.
Man it's so nice to hear Mike and just anything about how they're all doing. üíú
If us,the fans,are broken i can't imagine what his family and rest of the band are going through
Jesus has it been two months already? Damn feels just like yesterday. Miss you Chaz
Every time Chester screamed I do toward the end of One More Light=goosebumps.
I have been a fan since the beginning. I am now 54 and still with them.  My heart was broken and still hurts.. so good to hear Mike so positive.
I hope they get austin carlile for the oct 27 tribute concert.
THANK YOU FOR THIS LPASSOC. JUST WANT TO ADD....I WOULD LOVE TO\nSEE LP CONTINUE ON WITH\nJUST THE FIVE OF THEM, NO NEW LEAD SINGER, MIKE IS NOW THE NEW LEAD, MIKE SHINODA HAS \nA GREAT VOICE‚ù§
Right now it's good to hear Mike. It's good to hear a follow up.
Mike is such a great nice guy. This was a good interview and very touching.
The Two months since Chester passed away... was enough thank you... bye
I am glad to hear Mike's voice. I'll hope everyone is okay. Dave, Hahn, Rob and Brad too. It is very dark time losing someone we loved. \nThank you so much for making this interview. At least, I know any progress about them. \n\nPS: I don't have twitter, facebook and instagram. So, I am kinda outdated to get the news.
I can't believe people have disliked this video smh
pain in his voice... But good to hear Mike's laugh.
idk why i find this hole chester thing suspect but who knoes
Please don't stop Linkin Park. \nPlease continue your fantastic Job. \nI love you guys.
Glad to hear Mike Sounding so well!
earphones on and closed my eyes\n. i don't want to get distracted from hearing his voice, after a while. and to hear he sounded okay.. make me feel okay.\nthank you for this. :')
Wish I could be at the upcoming event. \nGreat to hear from Mike!
So who's excited for new Fort Minor tracks?
It felt SO GOOD to hear his voice again
Is there any chance of that tribute concert being broadcast online for other fans throughout the U.S. and around the world who won't be able to attend?
So good to finally hear Mike's voice... Thank you so so much for uploading this.
I am very grateful for this
Just started on youtube to capture all the shit me and my mates get up to so any views, likes, dislikes or subs would help but shit i wont loose sleep if im still on 0 in 3 years üòÇüòÇ
Mike is so strong, I am so proud of him and LP. Its a heavy time for them, for us, for all fans. Its good to hear him. Stay strong, guys <3
Thank you Mike , is this show going to be recorded or live broadcast so fans like me from Europe can see it too?
Damn it, I cannot help crying just looking at the comments.
thank you for posting this
There's a reason he's 'The Glue'
Thank you so much LPA  for uploading this interview
I hope that there will be a live stream or something for the fans all over the world who can not be there
I got my tickets to this show today. I hope this will be a good time for everyone, and a source of some closure.
I love u guys so much and I am very sad that I can't come to the show in honour of Chester just because I am living so far awayüòî
3:20 one more light - how this idea pop out - heart breaking story </3
I'm so happy to hear Mike's voice again. I can't even begin to imagine how tough it must be for him, the rest of the band and Talinda. You guys handle it with a lot of care and dignity, and I wish you all the best in the future. Won't be able to see you guys live unfortunately, but I will always be there, making tributes and doing my best to support you. Thank you for everything.
Much love and respect Mike and LP and all Chester's fans, and family!
Such a Great Person.. stay strong r.i.p chester bennington üò≠ he's an Angel now
üò¢üíîüíîüíî so much love to the #LP and the family rest in peace chester bennington xxxxx
He definitely was choking up while talking about the making of One More Light. I feel horrible for him and the rest of the band plus Chester's family.
Mike is really in pain.......rip chester
I like that they didn't ask him about Chester's death and just let him speak a little bit about it
Wish you all the best Mike, the hole band and Chesters family..‚ù§‚ù§
In the tribute concert I would like to see the band members together sing One More Light to end the show, makes me tear up just picturing that in my mind.
Thank You Mike for this from üá©üá™
This broke my heart a little.  But I needed this. I really hope they come back to tampa fl and do something.  I need to see them and cry out . Not to sound like a little bitch,  but this band has been in my life sense the 9th grade and I'm 33 now
it's very comforting to hear mike's voice
He really likes to say the meat and potatos XD
Its been 2 months...2 months of sadness.R.I.P Chester Bennington.
it's so good to hear his voice. the guys are so strong and i know that they're gonna get through this even though the hole in their hearts will never be filled by anyone else ever again. i miss Chester so much and i know that he'd be proud of everything the guys are doing. i love them so much and hearing Mike's voice and his laugh gives me comfort in this hard time ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is so hard to listen to but it was nice to hear Mike again. Thank you for uploading this.
I love Mike. He is such an inspiration as well
Linkin Park should not fade away... please it is a remedy , a medicine for the cure to all the fans who are depressed and are lost...
Keep strong.
Thank you for sharing.
LP43V3R
So nice to hear from you, Mike. Sending you much love and wishing to be there at Hollywood Bowl on October 27.
Thank you for uploading this :)
This just came up in my recommendations and the first thing i thought was 'how can Mike be so strong about this'. He is amazing and i love them so much üòä
The fact that he had the strength to talk like this , makes u hopeful and to be more positive. #staystronglp thank you for this

Thanks for this
Mike <3
Como tw extra√±o Chester la banda que ara sin ti has dejado un vac√≠o en el coraz√≥n y en el alma tanto dolor üò¢
2 months? thats fucking crazy, yet people like already dont care. probably because we get new information so fucking quick n more new news over n over than people jus forget. we need to like get rid of this way of getting information, i dont think its good for us
I was my whole life a big fan of this band and there is this last consert! as a normal guy from vienna i guess there is never been a way to get there and listen to them but i hope they stream the shit out of there so i can watch it at home <3\n\nThanks Mike for this great Interview!!!
His 1st interview since?
thankyou so much for this Mike , LP4LIFE!!!!
You can hear it in his voice that he's still hurt. I feel for the guy but it's pretty amazing to hear his voice and to hear Kevin and Bean lift his spirits up. Good interview.
When the Aliens land here to make contact, Bj√∂rk should be there to receive them.
some ideas and symbols already appeared in wanderlust.\nexciting.
Great video. Pity the audio needs more work.
Visional a masterpiece, the music is as always strange  as fuck. The only song I rally did enjoy was All is full of love
This is better than many films out there
WHO THE FUCK DOWNVOTED THIS?!
I feel less alone, knowing she exists
Love, just like energy, is mean to flow in and out through all of us, so we can all give and recive. And when correctly, what a wonderful and  harmonious symphony it can be
She's the Supreme
How does a sociopath prove to himself he cares about another person
to simply call what this amazing woman does just music is an insult, this right here and like all she does is an experience of sound and visuals like no other!üôè
People who pretend to like this music are pretentious AF.
I'm not gonna lie. As a longtime bjork's fun, I am not happy. I'm just miss good music.
The video is like a computer game - you go one level up each time you go through her heart.
The video is amazing the song is just not good.
I miss being the healer of my raid party
we're not prepared for this
This is visually exquisite- the best of her videos!
I onky liked the first scene. I feel like it takes to to other world where a maid is playing the flute sorrounded by robots and an extraterrestrial nature. I love that part.
I love her, but I think she is burnt, by now
I love her so much
This will be one of her timeless video.
Bjork is a true example of the word artist. Her work goes beyond music and visuals, she masters the media and through it, she takes you to another level of awareness. Only few people in the world has this ability.
so glad i clicked this.. looks like a DMT trip! amazing as always Bj√∂rk :)
Closest thing to a DMT trip. Including sound
What a beautiful piece of her mind...Thank you Bjork ‚ù§üíö
Bj√∂rk + Arca is a perfect combination
The queen of Scandinavia has done it again !
Bjork always gets me high on music.
Anyone who gives her a thumbs down obviously doesn't get her or appreciate her for what she is.
It makes me think of Digimon's evolutions
I couldn't have clicked any faster,  what a genius
the queen is back!  (^_^)\nlove her!
Infinitely complex energy orbz inside all of us? Our human bodies being just gates? Yah im so down.
That felt longer than 7 minutes, so immersive!!
I had a fever from hypothermia where my delirium was like this for a day. Thank you for your creative art, Bj√∂rk.
Bjork has been one of the earth's greatest gifts...but I really didn't enjoy watching her have sex with a digital...creature...thing.
Think she opened my third eye.
dont like the song, except that little tone sequence in the refrain. the video is hypnotizing though
I wonder if the song would hold up if it weren't for the stunning visuals. I'm imagining myself listening to an entire album like this on headphones but I don't really see it happening. I love Bj√∂rk, and the video, but I don't think this is a song I'd return to for pure sound experience. Big props to the CG artists, as I think they deserve as much, if not more credit for bringing the project to life.
Holy shit....did I just watch Mother Nature having sex with me in 3rd person?

Why isn't this in 4K HDR!?
I can't believe Bjork invented the future
This was hard to watch. The Gucci dress is amazing but I don't understand the appeal of the music of the video.
She is a Goddess! So much creativity and always evolving with such an accurate sensibility! Breathtaking! üíì
Two great artists releasing music at the same time - Bjork and Tori Amos..
Bj√∂rk giving reiki for this sick and aggressive world we're living, thank you sister!!! Still spreading love for the Multiverses!!!! <3

Okay! I guess I don't have to do DMT now.
A M A Z I N G
is this supposed to be a DMT trip?
thank you
i love this new track but i do hope the whole record isn't just this style. Vulnicura was wonderful while being a bit homogenous (similar to Biophilia) i hope she doesn't do that with this particular style which is like a cross between those two records... i also really hope to god that it won't be called Utopia.
Just here for the dress
I NEED THE INSTRUMENTAL, THIS IS WONDERFUL
After hearing the song, i decided to watch the video on mute, play some psybient in background. 6:50 minutes of pure bliss.
this comes from another fucking dimension
Evertime I think about to not be any part of this existence anymore. She is bringing me back. I hope there is a place where I can experience that kind of universe.
Yep, she's still got it.
This is so stupid and pretentious

Best\nThing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVER
What is she ?
La nueva m√∫sica cl√°sica, hoy.
La introducci√≥n es como una mezcla de Raymand Adventures y Badland y sonidos de renacuajos.\nNormalmente nos gusta primero el sonido y ritmo de la m√∫sica seguido de la letra.. con THE GATE y con casi todas las canciones de esta Diosa es todo lo contrario..... tomamos atenci√≥n a la letra y nos gusta, esa sinceridad que tiene para transmitir un mensaje por medio de su arte.
esto es muy hermoso y tan relajante, realmente Bj√∂rk hace arte ‚ù§
DESEARIA TENER SU PERSPECTIVA ACERCA DE LO QUE INTERPRETA!!!
No other artist comes up to her level of visual creativity in musicvideos. But personally i feel that her music is less interesting now compared to Debut and Post. She still has a couple of really good tracks on her albums though. This is not one of them.
This is cri ‚Äì inge worthy, cri ‚Äì inge worthy, cri ‚Äì inge worthy, cri ‚Äì inge worthy, cri ‚Äì inge worthy. I am go -ing, to-o-o, pu-uke, no-o-o-ow.
Hmm, her music and image has gotten progressively fairy/new-agey calm as she's aged. I miss the high energy dynamic Bjork with rhythm of the late 90s and early 2000s. Saw her in concert a few years ago, and it was great, but she was losing her voice half way through.
Sorry to those that love her music but I think she had no idea how to sing. Sorry but that's what I think and the video is super weird!!
satanists know what is coming...
I'm currently watching this on shrooms and it's guncking amazing

Jesus she's awful.
Cho isn't funny      .
Deleted every one of them. \n\nI'd best go and pray now!
Oh boy, you know it's gonna be a good episode, when Norm starts it off with a nazi joke
Bobby Lee part 2 was very disappointing, this time around there was no chemistry or connection. Norm seemed a little bit out of it. He didn't even get any funny story's this time. No wonder they didn't open the season with this one.  This one might be the worst episode of the entire 3 seasons.
Margaret Cho what a twat, any excuse to shit on conservatives it's ironic that the joke is why would anyone be apposed to killing ISIS and she has to turn it around to make a point saying fuck conservatives. I detest the religion as a whole being a vile sexist, destructive, oppressive religion but we can all distinguish between ISIS and more moderate Muslims you pig.
HMMM, SHE SAYS SHE SOCIALIZES WITH SUPER DAVE OSBOURNE, BUT THEN SHE ASKS IF HE STILL SHOOTS HIMSELF OUT OF THINGS AND VECROS HIMSELF. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SHE REALLY KNOWS SUPER DAVE AT ALL.
So is that just a straight Mickey Avalon My Dick rip off or was he involved somehow?
44:03 pizza joke is funnier when you put them emphasis on ITSELF
I thought comedians were supposed to have a sense of humor.
Everyone loves Margaret especially me.........Ok now let's see the funny Cho?
i don't find her funny anymore ...
Margaret Cho basically says its bad to say isis hunter because it generalizes muslims, and then proceeds to generalize conservatives. This is why leftys are fucking idiots
What a brain dead liberal. Proved it when she took the bait @31:53.
Man, Norm's flinch after the Lizzie Borden joke is too funny
boy Norm did NOT look like he wanted to be there...either that or he had copious amounts of xanax
Hahaha! I really liked that part where Margaret made the asshole licking to battery testing comparison. It reminds me of that time that Jim Norton did the exact same joke in his new HBO special. What a funny and original gal she is. What a hoot!
One thing I've learned consistently from watching Norm Live: not a lot of comedians or comic actors actually have senses of humor.
she's just an old chung of coal.
One less bar, norm. Just one.
I dunno who this Buckley character is. ¬†I thought he was doing Hannibal Lector.
Why is Norm pretending to be more senile than he really is? I mean... I know why, but... you know!
Jesus Norm, could you put some effort into the show with Margaret Cho. Stop taking what ever meds your Dr has prescribed  you.
I heard Hitler was a bit of a jerk.
What do you do with a guest that isn't funny and you don't respect?  JOKES for 15 minutes and the guest has absolutely no fun with it the entire time.  TRUE COMEDY
I watched videos of Bob Hope from 1990 and he seemed pretty mentally alert.
oh jesus H christ...my pus ?
Next week for the whole hour The Bushman
Cho sporting the Joyce DeWitt hairdo.
I love how diverse this season is! Doesn t matter if old white men are funnier, but as long as its diverse!
clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Margaret is starting to resemble my mother.  And I hate my mother. Ok I find my mother extremely annoying and try to distance myself from her as much as possible.  Hate's a little excessive.
I've seen nearly every episode save for the Adam Sandler one and part 2 of Gilbert godtfried. This is the only one I didn't thoroughly enjoy.
Norm doing his best Eric Andre impression.
on Hitler: ..and I do not care for that man. Norm and/or my Grandmother.
I've recommended season 1 and 2 to my friends. Not so much for this season...
I love Norm but he can be frustrating at times.
Norm, buddy....are you okay?   Let me know
I mean this guy was a real jerk!!!
Cho in a nutshell- Don't generalize about Muslims! while she generalizes about conservative Americans. I don't think the sentiment going around in conservative circles is that it is OK to think all Muslims are ISIS, but I guess it is OK for her to generalize while she criticizes others for generalizing. 100% aside from her hypocrisy, this was the least funny episode of the entire series- except for the Lizzie Borden and Mamie Eisenhower jokes.
But they never suspect THE DEACON!
does margaret not like norm...or just not get him? she comes off like someone's nervous, humorless aunt that wandered into the studio.
I thought that was the boy in those Karate movies of the 80s
Is Norm stoned or high or extremely tired or something? He looks like he is about to fall over at times.
It's a bird
when adam eget is more entertaining and interesting than the guest.
You know, I am a self-identifying conservative and it is true that¬†I DID want to kill all Muslims. ALL OF THEM. But after hearing Margaret shine light on this subject and really illustrate how ignorant I was being...as a conservative, of course...it has made me really do some self-reflecting. I guess she's right. I guess we shouldn't kill all Muslims. I guess that not all the billions of Muslims world wide are terrorists. I'm glad she pointed out the ignorance that all us conservatives hold because I really did think that all Muslims were evil terrorists. Wow. Thank you Margaret. But now my conundrum is, can I be a conservative who doesn't believe that all Muslims are evil or should I become a liberal who makes sweeping generalizations about the ideologues of conservatives? \n\nHmmmm...
I have watched most all of Norm Macdonald Live but this one...uggh. Not remotely entertaining. \nIt's not too late to delete this episode, Norm.
What the hell is the meaning of this?!
13:23 omg I can't stop watching this over and over
Light camera....dark camera.....light camea.....dark camera.....I fuckin love this show!  That and Margaret started off with Ari Shafir's joke about liking assholes is like a 9 volt battery.
i bone no one
Norm tried, but she is a killjoy of a guest.
how come she has nothing to say ..did anyone sit through this shit ?
Albert Brooks would be an awesome interview.
The only way this season of Norm could get any more intense is if Doug Stanhope is the next guest.
Robert Forster does a mean Norm Macdonald in this one.
Fuck this show! You suck now Norm. Either get off the drugs you're on, or get back on the drugs you were on 2 years ago. The only  episodes I've actually watched all the way through this season are the David Letterman, Dana Carvey, and Mike Tyson episodes and even those are a shadow of the greatness that was the first two seasons.
The last 20 minutes are fantastic. Such a weird atmosphere, like a real life tim and eric skit
you win this battle, clinical depression
Norm is hilarious, but he really needs to work on his speaking voice.  It almost makes me want to not watch.
Seeing Norm so down makes me feel kinda down, you know? I think my favorite part of this was when Adam was trying to agree with Margaret and Norm was saying at the same time, Well, well uh, well uh, well spoken, haha. Wasn't really a joke or anything but it was one of those tension-releasing laughs.
Why are mainland chinese people so rude and uncivilised?
Get Dan Akyroyd  on the show Norm!\nYou can ask him about aliens and Coneheads and shit!\nOr get Bill Murray... Margaret Cho isn't funny.
I love the awkward episodes.
Come on Norm, you can find more interesting people to interview than this.
This was priceless. Now, not so much.  No more garbage guests
I'll take some orange chicken and a couple egg rolls.
Margaret Cho's impression of a dull lady with nothing to say was irresistible
I have no idea why this woman is famous.
The ISIS hunting permit bit culminating in Norm's friend's biggest fear is fucking sublime genius. It is so deadpan I missed it as badly as Cho and Eget the first time I saw it. But Norm masterfully hooks them into revealing their banal PC ideas that basically are the same ones Barack Obama had (after every Islamic atrocity in Europe the first thing our former POTUS would say was words to the effect of 'Islam is a great religion of peace', b/c he was more worried about the blowback than the safety of Western innocents at the hands of crazed butchers). Norm set it up in such a way that they were completely unaware they were subjects of his satirical observations. Cho's that's true was the coup de grace. Anyone who wrote off this episode b/c of the guest is missing classic Norm.
I remember when Adam's shoes were still clean in season 1.
I'm going to the bathroom and take a Margret, then I'm going to wipe my Cho. She really knows how to put the UN in funny!
I'm surprised Cho didn't end up looking like Friar Tuck by minute 26 with all the jokes flying over her head at such velocity and frequency. I gave the episode a like based purely on Norm's heroic effort in salvaging it. Although entertaining, it was the worst yet. I understand why it was delayed since it seems it was the first one filmed this season.
Norm MacDonald is the smartest duck in the bin. By any reasonable metric Norm is the binniest duck in bin.
Never seen this old Oriental fellow before, he seems angry...probably has a very small penis.
I got your muslim joke Norm. I shared your disappointment in the morons beside you.
Adam Eget is one of the worst jewz
She suddenly looks old. She's only 49
last week's guest was a much more attractive woman
Fuckin fuck margeret cho
Egret is as fatbody.
Margaret Cho, beautiful, great guest
always amazing Ms. Cho!
Worst episode ever.
jokes are back!!! thank you jeebus
Isnt this the chick from greys anatomy?
Painful,
4:54 12:56
Egret is getting fat.
Good episode. Minus the viet cong fella.
Yet another awesome show, Norm.
Discovered by a barely alive Bob Hope... that explains it. Seriously, this show dragged. Apparently to be a comedian you don't need to be funny off-script.
for some (stupid) reason, alt-righter fans of norm have concluded that since he's made some right-wing sounding comments over the years and likes fucking with people, that he is a *sociopathic maniac* who mocks his liberal guests' very existence just by having them on - while appearing cordial on the surface. all done as a nod to the enlightened few who truly understand him. every fan who knows norm well enough knows that they haven't the slightest clue about almost anything, least of all the things he's spoken about.
This podcast needs to be age restricted...Must be 40 years old and up to watch. To hear so many stupid kids spitting and bratting in these comments sections, it makes me sick.
What a generous guest. Norm was a total ass.
She has the flattest face I've ever seen. Just a nose.
I'm pretty sure Norm overdid it on the Xanax.
Normie i love ya but this season sucks so far. I have a feeling your producers or someone at Jash is forcing you into some guests....
Mel Brooks: Stupidly politically correct society is the death of comedy. ¬†The master has spoken.
Good job!...  looks tough...  it's nice to see a gaming journalist who is able to get past the tutorial.  :)
Even years after it was announced, this art still blows me away.
Clearly you don't have an exhorbitant amount of experience in the industry as you seem to know how to play a video game.  Looks like a blast!
How did u get past the tutorial?
Wow this art and animation...
It was a close call, but someone *finally* took down Hilda's moon form!
I'm getting a lot of Contra and Gradius vibes from this game.
Really looks like a cartoon is onüòÇüòÇüòÇ I can't tell where it loops unlike other games, there's no break in the animation here
The boss battles look amazing. But the in-between bits look a little lackluster. The game was originally supposed to be just boss battles, and I hope there's a mode like that in the game. I will buy this simply because it looks incredible and because I want to support the developers who have put themselves in a financial hole to make this game.
The hero is a Cuphead - Is there any beverage link to power ups or health - like soda or coffee gives you an extra life?
This is gonna be great
Oh hey, someone that can actually play the game.
Ok so THIS lady is very good at this game from what I can see. It's nice to see someone who's COMPETENT at games. Job well done since this is literally the ONLY time I've seen any reviewer beat the Zeppelin boss. I give this vid two thumbs up (and  a like).
I hope there are cheats so I can play with my son :D he'd love this one.. little hard for 3 year old tho haha
This game will still be relevant 10 years from now for the art style alone... probably even longer than that.
Wow someone who can handle this game is playing.
This game idea just wows me every time I watch it. The Art, Music, SFX, and story idea are amazing. I can't wait to get my hands one this game.
What? Someone who can actually play a game... on a game journalism channel? What is this heresy!
So Cuphead is early Disney's Contra.
I CANNOT be more excited for this game. How is it only $20?????
This game looks like it is going to be amazingly infuriating....and I can't wait!
That song reminds me soo much of skullgirl
The boss battles look amazing, you can tell everything in between was kind of tacked on
The art style is still stunning but the gameplay looks pretty dull.
wait, this is not 20 min long... ;)
The art for this is incredible, but the sound effects, while appropriate, make me want to rip my ears off.
finally gameplay where someone is actually good at games
If Walt Disney made Contra
Dean Takahashi would put you to shame...
I wonder how many young people watching this video realize this was a cartoon format LONG ago, even before I was born.
Visually, it's orgasmic!
Not bad for a $5.00 game I guess
You know, I've never really been a fan of the 1920s cartoon aesthetic, and I hate this type of music, but man from the moment I saw this game revealed I have loved it. I appreciate the craft on so many different levels. Day one.
This game is gonna be released on pc too right?
Hi. Just curious. I know this is an Xbox exclusive, but any chance this fire coming to the Switch?\nIs it a timed indie exclusive or are the chances like having Banjo coming back to Nintendo?
#First
Game LOOKS amazing. I'm unimpressed by the depth of the game and the sound effects leave a lot to be desired. Atleast from what I can see from the demo. Not to say I won't support the game. Love the art style. Hoping this is still an early version and they fill out the enemy sound effects a bit more and show more depth in the pre boss game play. (better platforming, unique mechanics, creative boss battles, etc)
None of that DOS buildup, and WEEZER!!\n\nWindows 95 was the SHIT!
this is the kind of acting that made daniel day lewis retire.

Hey there,\nYour Videos are amazing!\nI work for GamePro and GameStar, two gaming pages on facebook with more than 600k fans combined. Would it be ok for you if we created a video based on yours?\nWe would credit your channel/video in the top-comment and tag your FB-Page in the post's status, so that our fans could become fans of your page in a second. I think that your work could reach a lot of people who yet have to see your amazing work!\nLet me know what you're thinking.\nCheers, Philipp\n\nEspecially we're interested in the following clip: https://youtu.be/7vdNTw3zzEs
I wonder what they were thinking, like there were 4 of us and we just died to a grandpa... what is life
I'm not even upset that its tpp.\nWell done, man.
This is great! Could we feature this clip on our show Highlight Reel? We link out/credit every clip we feature.

the sound at the last was really weird.
Follow the sound of the flute OMO the next song in my playlist is go go go im dying
They just roasted army's üò≠üòÇüòÇüíò I don't know what to think right now
lol I'm listening to this while studyingüòÇ
i really need them to sing this live before i die üò´üëÖüí¶
I want to cry all my life over that yeah suga im weak
MY FAV!!! I THINK I LIKE THIS EVEN BETTER THAN DNA OR IT IS AFTER DNA it depends on my mood :P but I LOOOVEE THIS SOOONGG OMGGGGG TAKE ME AWAY!!! *___*
I got busted by BTS bcause spend my time just to watch them only all day. But I dont regret it. A.R.M.Y FOREVERRRRRüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Why do I find the chorus and bridge sensual? üòÇ plus kookie's husky voice. Okay. My green mind is taking over me.
BTS: Go fucking study and be healthy \nMe: B-bu-\nBTS: GO. NOW.
As a fanboy this makes me upset how this song is just for fangirls...
I am sorry armies but I love this song more than dna
For some reason this song encouraged me to study for my upcoming exams in three weeksüòÇüòÅ I love you BTS!!!!
'stop, let's stop looking and start studying for the exams'\n*deep\n\nwell I'm in final year of secondary School..and this gonna be my final exam..\nbye~ I will go study now...
I'm crying a lot .. harder than  i cry for my last year exam result
I promised my self not to get into this fandome....
did anyone else get the shit scared out of them by the really soft yeah, suga omg
my parents & boss doesnt hate you namjoon bc they dont even know you... sad, their missing out not knowing you.
*i'm your paradise :D
Before you know translate:wow cool\nAfter you know:ooooooooo
I will always love you, BTS!‚ô•
This'll be my anthem from now on. HAHAHAHA
Jimin: can't close your eyes\nMe: *closes eyes* just did you damn liar wait CAUGHT IN A LIEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
I barely know what to feel hahah. BTS have ruined me in the best way possible, and it seems like they can barely live without us either.
don't reject me. boi, I'll reject my homework and my social life for you. Not like I already haven't but
No line for rm?
Their dance in I like it pt 2 would fit in this.. in my opinion
I suddenly feel bad for fanboys and I don't know why.
I'm not sure if I feel inspired or scolded...A little bit of both?? \nWhats this feeling of being carefully scolded by older siblings? They are all older than me but it still feels odd... Warm and fuzzy but a little painful and I kind of want to rush to be successful so that I can show them...Yeah I'm definitely getting an older sibling vibe from this which is SOOO surreal and shocking because I've got 3 older brothers and...This is the first time I've seen BTS as older brothers. Idk really how I'm feeling rn. Did they mean to do this? Because I'm so conflicted and turned around right now and I now have an anxious feeling of needing to study. I do need to study for my GED and I still don't have my drivers license and...AH! Ty bts ty, now I have ambitions that I do not want. you guys happy? 0_-
they are making it sound like if you choose to be an army, it is a sin that you made
i blushed. i read the lyrics until I  realize something. they are starring  at me rn. üò≥üò£üòä
I play the flute...\n\n\n\n\n\ncome follow, my hyungs. <3
HI, Could I use your vid. . . . I will use it on my BTS crack video. I will give credits
I stan the ONE AND ONLY LEGENDS
oH SO THE SONG IS FOR US hm
Umm yeah..  Sure thing you ruined us because we go crazy to a boy group that doesn't even know us and called us in generalized as ARMY.  But well what can we do??  We are already drawn to all of you..  You're like a drug that we got ruined but we have been happy seing you watching you.  Just continue doing this amazing performances because even we are ruined I know you're the only ones who can Also save us from this addiction.  I love you BTS.  keep FIGHTING~~ üòòüòò
this is describing army, literally  üòç
They didn't even mention 'girl',I like it because although the majority of ARMY is girl,they make the song specified for us yet generally for us to relate regardless of our gender
Hmmm this translation mistranslated a bunch of lines like you test me should be I'm testing you there's a couple lines she missed like that where it should be I'm _____ you instead of you _____ me. The latter makes it sound like bts is flirting with fans but the correct translation is that they know we're drawn to them like a light. They're both saving us and ruining us and they know it.
I don't mind being lectured this way HAHAHHAHA
Diss ARMY, ok i'm fine......

The storylines of this song sound somehow as the European legend  the Pied Piper of Hamelin which is about a piper who rid the town of Hamelin of rats by luring them away with his music and then, when he was not paid for his services, lured away its children...
No worries, BTS. I make sure I have spare time before listening! I'm already planning college visits.
BLOW IT LIKE A FLUTE\n wait wrong group\n this lyrics are so accurate
some people take this song as they are dissing us (well it was a small diss I though it was funny) but I believe they are just showing their love and care for us, like how we always tell them to rest, eat and work hard they are basically saying the same like you are telling us to do this stuff but look at you, you've been up for hours supporting us you should rest too and focus on you're life too that's what I got from this song anyway

Guys the whole album is a masterpiece i can't get my emotions together I LOVE IT THE MORE I LISTEN TO IT
wtf has it got to do with Richard Madeley or anybody else for that matter?
they're two adults forming a relashionship, nobody on this earth has the right to say anything.
Who? Why is this important?
Anybody would attack if you've being locked up for that amount of time , when he should be out , an what's he going to say when he see luton , fuck me were you dropped me off ? Paki fucking stan , all I want is a apple pie not a bloody curry an loads of fucking sex cases
Richard Madeley is a stuttering gibberish bell end and what‚Äôs more the cock twat got his facts wrong lol numpty
Coming from this guy \n Hes a shoplifter
Piers Morgan number 2.. What a prick!!!
Id love his porn tash around the base of my meaty length.
What happened to Lorraine Etherington who was engaged to Bronson a couple of years back?
Has there been a helium leak.........pssssssssss
He‚Äôs never getting out of jail and she‚Äôs just a fame whore
Think Richards been taking tips off Piers Morgan lol
Why are all these 2k views videos in the trending tab all of a sudden? How is this #27 in trending?
fiance? hes been inside for 30 years.. so she got with him outta clout? women are weirdos hahahaha
Fiancee lol ok. He's never getting out, pointless.
Richard is a complete dick.
Tony bhlair is a bigger criminal than this guy....
When did Richard become such a gobby, shitty presenter? Maybe I was just too young & naive in my childhood to fully be aware of how he presented This Morning with Judy, but I don‚Äôt ever recall him having this much of a cocky arrogance about him.\nHe‚Äôs not asking questions from the public, he‚Äôs projecting his own opinions onto her & using that as an excuse, that‚Äôs poor journalism & completely unprofessional. \n\nNo one has the right to tell her who she can & can‚Äôt love.It‚Äôs not about acceptability, no one has to accept it, it‚Äôs their lives, & they have the freedom to do whatever they choose to with their emotions & feelings.
Charles Bronson is a fucking scumbag, let the cunt rot in jail. This dopey bitch gets all wet over violent men!? Send her to the Jihadis. ANd to all you pathetic dimwits who idolise this cretin; EAT MY SHIT!
Richard should stick to shop lifting wine from Tesco. Always thought he was a shitty presenter, I wonder how is alcoholic wife is doing?
They invite this women to come on their show for an interview and general talk about her relationship.  Why is the host not being a host and starting arguments. His opinion should be neutral no matter what his personal views. \n\nThis is just pathetic and I feel sorry that women had to go through that interrogation. \n\nHe is a full on posh beta cuck that says anything to please the majority.
The actual russian translation is He is gender neutral!
And he went straight to the pits of hell where all of these Jude created degenerate/bolshevik/perverts will burn forever.....
only cops in america that dont have tazers?
Does an individual have a right to walk around or not? What has this student done? Apparently, nothing. We're losing our civil liberties. We're heading down the road to a police state where you will obey every order a police officer gives you or you will be killed. That is the definition of a POLICE STATE. YOU ARE A CRIMINAL UNLESS PROVEN OTHERWISE - that's A POLICE STATE. You people that think this was justified action by the police better start getting educated.
I guess his heart just wasnt in it
I don't understand why they shot him/her. He/she did not come running at them wielding the knife like a maniac. They could have taken a couple steps back and tazed them. The cop must not've know that they could take a few steps back and give them another chance to drop the knife. I guess they can say they've shot somebody. Cop should be fired and sentenced. No need to take a life that way. I don't get it. What's wrong with cops these days?
If you're dumb enough to come at people who're trying to help you with a knife, that's your own fault.
If that was me you think that police officer would be stepping away from me asking me to nicely put the knife down? Fucc the police either way RIP Scout üôèüèæ
Clean shot.
Actually at ranges of less than 20 feet a knife, even with a small blade can be as deadly or more deadly than a pistol. At the distance Schutz was allowed to close to,  he could have closed the remaining distance in a rush and inflicted lethal blows himself. Again at the distances Schutz closed to he could have rushed the remaining distance and stabbed before a fired taser deployed it's wire. These cops had no knowledge beforehand that this was a suicide by cop. Their call was to protect themselves and the lives of other citizens in the area. They gave him multiple chances to comply and tried to engage him. Schutz was not allowing a peaceful solution. Cops acted correctly.
These comments are sad. Most of the people here should get into a depression and live it for years. Then ask to be shot.
I feel for everyone involved but these officers tried. My heart breaks for Scouts pain but you don't force someone to kill you. Someone committed suicide by jumping in front of my baby brothers car. My brother is the best, kindest person in this world and suffers from depression and some PTSD because of this. He even secretly checks in on the guys kids every Christmas. Never, ever make someone kill you. It's the most selfish act in this world. These officers didn't have tazers, they attempted to talk to Scout, they got behind barriers to allow themselves more time to react, they repeatedly told Scout to drop it and gave Scout ample time to do so. Notice how close the officer is who shoots Scout. This wasn't some asshole cop shooting an unarmed person from a mile away. The police did everything right in this situation. All you people asking if we'd want the police to react this way if it was our family member? Yes! I would want them to try to connect. I would want them to try to talk, to take time to try to diffuse the situation, to try to establish a rapport. That's exactly what I would want. And in the event that it was one of my family members that was the officer, I would want them to shoot when an armed, distressed individual with nothing to lose is coming at then with a knife.
Protesters doing a school shooting
So some gay group on this campus had elected THIS character as their leader??
Mother fuck the police!! üñïüñïüñï
Go to 1:00 to brighten your day
I feel bad for the police in this situation.
My biggest problem with this is all the people that come in thinking that they know exactly how to handle a knife threat when they've never had to handle a knife threat before
Dumbass asked for it so he got it!
Drop the knife and you live, Walk up on cops with the knife you die.... Simple choice or should have been for someone that is so called educated. Case closed, suicide by cop.
And nothing of value was lost that day
This coward didn't have the balls to take his own life, so he dragged these officers into the final moments of his pathetic existence.
All these tranny freaks need to be put down. Good shoot.
There is no argument here. If you are threatening a police officer, and disobey their commands, you WILL be shot. He committed suicide by cop.
He did say shoot me. Seriously, I know cops get away with fucked up shit but the proof is all there. They warned him, they tried to talk it out, he wasn't listening. If it would have been me in the situation, I would do the same. It's him or me, I kinda like breathing and I was told in police training, they teach you that someone with a knife can close the distance very quickly. Fuck this guy. I would say the same if he was black, proof is there. It's not a race/gender/orientation thing in this case, it's basic logic.
We as a society have to do better period!!!...
People are a bunch of pussies. No one should respond to a little knife by pulling or firing a gun. Huge bitch move. There was obviously no threat to the pigs. Just another coward with a gun.
Was the cop justified in shooting Schultz after was told to stop?\nYes.\nWould it have been better if he had tazed Schultz instead?\nAlso yes.\n\nThat's all, folks.
Police did their job..no one wants to get stabbed..if someone is charging at you with a knife you have every right to defend yourself
Damn trees in the way.... Damn it! It got what IT asked for...
Wah wah wah police didn't try to de-escalate the situation first\nTelling him to drop the knife like a dozen times and trying to get him to tell them his name don't count?
There's a lot of homophobic hate speech going on in this comments section and it's fucked up
He was a... _she_ was... it?  Yeah, _it._  _It_ was a good... _thing?_  Okay, _it_ was good _thing,_ it just got caught up with the wrong crowd.  It was just startin' to get its' life turned around.\n\n*_It dindu nuffin!_*    :'(
please tell me it die
What are you going to do? Shoot me? - Quote from man shot.
good for the faggot. one less gay muther fucker in the world
My Coverage Of This:\nhttps://youtu.be/iXodCGzKhpU
You know, another way to handle this would be for the cops to just leave.  Just walk away and leave the freak all alone out there.  It probably would have just sat down on the ground and snowflaked out, and then went back to its dorm to watch Liza Minelli videos.  It wouldn't have hurt anybody - because it's not nice to hurt people.  Its only motive here was to have the cops kill it because it was too much of a sissy to do it itself.  If the cops had just left, we might still have this Girl Scout with us.
Absolutely unnecessary. You can tell by their vocal tones and body language that the cops did not feel this person was a true threat. It sounds like the female officer pulled the trigger. Come on. Body armor, military grade equipment, tazers, possibly non-lethal force weaponry, and you have to shoot an obviously mentally ill person that's holding a multi-tool, with a lethal shot? Sickening.
Mental disorder is a real thing people...
Suicide by cop, and he was clearly mentally ill. You can't be non binary just like you can't be a bird no matter how much you feel like one.
Cops made a good job! Respect for them, they gave the chance to that idiot to stop.
This is because American cops are pussies.... Too quick to go for a gun and too scared to take an arse whooping. Then again, same with a lot of the US civilian population too... Too scared to take an arse whooping so to live up to the 'gangsta'/ 'I'm the best in the world'/'unique snowflake attitude a lot of them have thanks to the media, they carry guns to alleviate their shortcomings. \nOver here in the UK, the cop would have just pulled out his side stick and smashed the guy in the face. I've seen it happen a few times with my own eyeballs. The shit has to be hitting the fan to warrant UK police carrying guns. Because of that, a lot of UK police will just rush you at the first moment and beat you down, pin you to the ground and get a few extra sly digs in while you're having handcuffs put on you.\nThe guy in the video was clearly a scrawny weedy looking dude AND the police had at least 60 seconds to assess this. To look him in the eyes. Yeah, he has a blade, but shit reach. The cop had better reach and even more reach with a baton. And the knowledge that stabbings are rarely fatal. And body armour. And a partner with a gun just in case the attempted takedown with a baton didn't work immediately. Also, at that range, there was no reason to not fire three shots at the guys legs. At no point was he moving fast and if you can't hit with 1 of three shots to a 6 inch target (width of average human calf muscle) moving at walking pace at 15m, you shouldn't be allowed to carry a gun. The officer shit himself/herself and immediately and instinctively aimed for centre mass/vital organs. Again, police need to asses the situation. Night time, few people out if any, no one directly behind him or in the immediate area... No worry about discharging 2 or 3 rounds at him. Sure, you can die from a bullet wound to the leg, but that's even less likely than dying from being stabbed. But yet, the officer opened fire. Centre mass... Killed him stone dead. He had time to cry out on the floor like a scared child for a few minutes. \nWell that's the thing; in such a society, you need officers who are brave. Who can take the extra second to assess the situation and not act on instinct. To act on higher rational thinking and motive. Here in the UK, we have a stabbing every 4 minutes... on Average. 130,000 a year. Wanna know how many people die? On average? a little over 200. Its because it takes training and skill or a good bit of luck to effectively kill with a knife. 95% of people don't know how to use one and thus the majority of stabbings are rarely fatal. Now, taking the 60 seconds the officer had to think about it, it doesn't take a genius to figure the threat level was low. \nSo, does a low threat level justify execution? I'd say not.\nSomeone with combat experience would have been able to rationalise that. Then again, the armed police are NOT civilians... Yet you guys keep hiring civilians and giving all of them a gun and thus, death by cop is an easy way out.\nI mean, I understand and all. 2nd amendment, and you'd do well to keep hold of that and not let it go. Hell, if the next Hitler rises, we, the people, here in the UK have nothing but harsh language to oppose him with. The second amendment allows you to fight back if the next Hitler thinks about rising over there. \nIf you have a society that has a lot of guns though, you MUST be more stringent on the kinds of people you allow to carry them. \n\nBrave, just and honest individuals only... Ideally, people with combat experience who have live training in taking the extra second even while the bullets are flying. Its not like you guys don't have a load of vets.
‚Ä†you can not under stand resurection becauze it waz scout shultz hiz destiny iz to die GET IT‚Ä†
Nice job. As we can see police do not relish with unleashing violence on even stupid assholes.
The officer that took the shot was an old high-school buddy of mine, I really hope there aren't any repercussions for him. But obviously Scout needed some help. God bless 'em both.
Did anyone else hear a male scream? I definitely heard a man scream...
Suicide by cop. The cowards way out. Don't have the balls to do it yourself, have to ruin somebody else's life too. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. And what retarded argument is It wasn't even a real knife, it was a multitool!? Have you not seen a Leatherman's blade?
listen to that panzy ass after getting what she wanted *shouldve double tapped there boss
Dumb retard tranny deserved to get shot. The tranny said Shoot Me . So they fucking shot it. Who the fuck cares
what I don't get is why they waited to shot until the point of no return,\naka when their own safety was at risk,\n\nOne officer could have warned him at let's say the 10-meter mark, or maybe even 15\nand after 3 ignored order at dropping the knife, they could have shot him in a non-lethal area, like the Legs, arm, shoulder\n\nPerhaps even have one officer with a trained gun on him, and one other going for a taser, \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying they Cop are to blame for acting with force, I just don't understand why they let him get that close when he clearly wasn't rushing, and just walking normally at a normal pace towards them
fucking RUSSIANS everywhere. But WHY couldnt that BITCH COP shoot him in the leg or shoulder at SUCH CLOSE RANGE !! lol.. womenzes and guns.. and CUNTS as COPS .. a bad combination. Cunts should NEVER BE ALLOWED to have a gun . they already have the ultimate pussy weapon.
Shout out to the guy who recorded this.
talk about excessive use of force
who's the dumbass bitch screaming in the background
That's what you get when you name your children Scout. I blame the parents
There's actually a easy way not to die by cops it's called listening to them
About as clean a shoot as there can be. The kid wanted this. Sorry to his/her family, but this was very much justified.
See cops shoot white people too...just saying
I would have aimed between the eyes.
Are k9 units even a thing in the U.S? Why werent they called to assist?? I dont believe a bullet is the answer for everything.
He ain't no michael Brown, nigga.
LGBT community should realize that if someone is willing to change their gender then they are severely mentally ill and are plagued by depression and self-loathing. Scout died because of your backwards beliefs. Scout should have been in Therapy but you guys think that's fascism.
That's what he gets for not dropping the knife period.
Time to loot and riot!!!!!1111\n\nOh nevermind, it's time to play GTA5 !!!
1:08  Crying like a little bitch. I got shot in Iraq and I didn't whine like this...... Of course, come to think of it; I was wearing Kevlar and all I ended up with was a gnarly bruise on my stomach.... And I did get to go to the infirmary where there was air conditioning and chocolate cake..... And my wound wasn't even bad enough to warrant a Purple Heart.... And I actually didn't have any long term disability or even a cool scar; just a bruise for like 2 weeks. But still; this guy's a pussy. Man up for fuck's sake.
And here is a prime example that these he/she's have a mental illness. Just think, Obama was going to let a creature like this join the military!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And they are protesting this? They get no sympathy from me.
Oh! You were told twice to put down your boyscout knife and you didn't do it so you must die! Can you imagine if workers in a mental institution had this threshold? Ninety percent of patients would never get out alive. No one said being a cop was easy. But if you can't deal with a troubled kid slow walking with a Swiss army type knife without killing her or him or whatever it is TURN IN YOUR FUCKING BADGE. I blame black lives matter for this. They have been so insane in their screaming over every death that they have made otherwise reasonable people think it's ok for a cop to kill a confused kid not slowly walking.
I wish the tree wasn't in the way, I wanted to see it happen.
why shoot somewhere fatal - when you could just shoot at their legs/arms/whatever. If they're still dangerous after that then go ahead but c'mon...
I am sorry but this has nothing to do with LGBT. I am also gay, but I can't really feel sorry for this girl. If you are idiot enough to attack the police with a weapon, unfortunately you have to deal with the consequences. Those who are demonstrating and protesting today referring to inequality and LGBT rights blablabla, don't do it, because 1) you are totally wrong, this case has nothing to do with LGBT 2) you are embarrassing  other members of LGBT with your behaviour (e.g. myself) and doing something wrong to the community....\nPlease, if you also lost your mind like this girl, and you are planning on launching the 3rd world war on police, do not fight for LGBT rights beforehand, or say publicly that you are gay / lesbian. Thanks ,)
Good riddance. The only good ANTIFA is dead ANTIFA.\nI hope they identify as a dead motha'fucka, cuz that's all they are now.
Very clear. The kid is the instigator.  The kid is the aggressor.  The kid fails to follow repeated instructions.  The kid is armed.  The kid asked to be killed.  Antifa lessons to be learned...America will no longer tolerate your shit.  There are lots more, who are not cops, who also have guns.  Think about it next time you try to burn down my family's car or business.
Scout was just mad because the officer didn't reference him with the proper pronoun I think lol enjoy your day libtards
I get that a knife is a deadly weapon that could easily of killed then with a poke but couldn't they just shoot him once or twice in both legs? Anyways if that's not a possible solution I guess the local Georgian officers did what they could. Sad story.
A female cop shot him? The march of progress! All those protesters should be celebrating.
And the Darwin Award goes to!
I don't understand the outrage. We allow Cops authority over us when they are on duty because they keep us safe. That is the compromise we agree to with the cops! So when you don't respect that authority and get shot.......
He failed to comply, he got killed...that's what happens. Why are these college idiots rioting? Imagine if this guy was black, the whole city would be on fire.
Na Na Na Na. Na Na Na Na. Hey hey hey. Goodbye.
Well done
Meh, had it coming
suicide by cop
us became hardcore isramic country.
HAHA.  One less faggot liberal.
Doesnt matter that theyre gay, cops, or whatever. Theyre dumb.
BAWAHAHAHAHA !!!!!!!
Such a waste
Good riddance!
Good riddance.
lol get rekt
Haahahahahaa Good! These idiots should not reproduce.
This started a riot? Pathetic.
Moron deserved it.
The US Police seem to forget they are there to serve and protect. Why on earth would you need to shoot somebody with a knife in the chest? Shoot them in the leg, shatter their kneecap if necessary, but no need to kill them.
It looks like he wanted the cops to shoot him. Either that or he was on drugs. Seriously, who walks towards cops with guns drawn and expects a good outcome?!
they could've shot him in the leg, ended the threat instead of his life.
Why didn't the police just shoot the legs?
Two cops at point blank range; neither decided to shoot him in the leg. Wake up sleepy heads.
That. Was. Fucking. Awesome.
This Q&A is the best one ive ever heard so far, made me understood WMD and SMS decisions overall, with that philosophy, im backing them all the way and as a bonus...I now hate EA for ethical reason instead of their bad games lol
6:14:07 he talks how EA killed Shift guys!
EA = Evil Assholes ? LOL üòâ
Legendary interview
EA is absolutely disgusting
Time-stamps:\n1:20:00 - Ian Bell joins the Live Chat (On the right Hand Side)\n2:03:20 - Ian Bell joins the Discord Chat (Audio Q/A)\nI wanted to clarify the basis of the interview as I've been asked by a handful of people. There was no prior arrangement made for Ian to come into the stream, it was completely off the cuff which is the surreal part of all of this. I was simply Live Streaming Project Cars 2 and Ian Bell popped up into the live feed chat. I invited Ian to come into Discord which he was an absolute pleasure to have on. \n\nIan was a completely open book - He spoke in great detail about prior business dealing that went awry with EA, growing up in Belfast with his Mum, dating tips for single guys, foreseeable updates for Project Cars 2 and other tidbits! he even strummed his guitar. What's the most amazing part is that he never once ignored any questions that anyone asked for the entire 5 hours he was on mic; respect!\n\nThanks again Ian Bell! It was absolute madness to have you come on the stream to talk to the peeps! :)
This is amazing. Q&A sold me on the game, thanks Ian and Ozzie.
Aww man, wish I'd been around for this! Great to see Ian doing what he does best (stream/chat/forum bombing), always fun to watch the bossman doing his thing, and great job Ozzie for keeping up with him!
Bell actually comes across decent here tbh. Weird as he always comes across an idiot when reading posts from him over the years but shows how different a person actually is with voice. He seems genuine with passion and i like the way he's says it how it is. Waiting for somebody like Empty Box to give some thoughts before buying as I didn't like PCARS. But still he gained a bit of respect from me here either way.
Best stream interview ever. I have supported Project Cars from day 1. Mr Bell sounds like a great man. If more people heard this, I am sure sales would increase massively. I play all the racing games, I play on PC, XBoxone and PS4. Project Cars 2 is the best racing game by far.
This is the best interview ever!!!
Thanks Ozzie for this really fascinating stream. And of course thank you Mr.Bell for the EPIC Q/A session!!!
Pure Class .
I'm not sure where Ian Bell gets his energy, amazing. He's been up for 60 hours and he STILL has the passion and desire to spend this much time on a live stream talking about his game, the industry etc. Respect.
about the whole Aus/NZ pricing, you children should stop crying, yes you pay more but you also have double the minimum wage of UK so stfu
Stream of the year!
Congratulations are in order for Ian and the team.  I was one of the senior manager members of WMD for pCARS 1, and we had a very good result with it. Some of the drama that went on with pCARS 1 was ridiculous when placed in the context of the complexity of what they were trying to do.  Haters gonna hate, and all that.   It was unfortunate we weren't able to continue the relationship for pCARS 2, but if SMS were considering branching out and wanted to leverage some risk with some outside investment again, I'd be interested.
Complains about EA trying to fuck him, and then tells you to go out and fuck everyone you can (as long as there's condoms). That's a wide ranging Q&A right there

Well this i can read people even when they typing he could save that lol - felt to good to trash EA with 100% true facts and he lost control for a minute I guess :D
EA suck my dick i will never ever buy a game from you again :) the list gets longer. ubisoft/EA/activision no money from me. the little studios are making better games anyays since years. :)
So they gave him 3 Millions and than fired him? Monsters!!!
If you enjoyed the live stream please show your support by leaving a like on the video :) This will assist in more opportunities in the future if it's looked in great favour!\n\nP.s. Ian Bell is the man!
Wait the360-PS3  shift game? was need for speed all ways part of EA?
inb4 EA gets voted worst company in America again.
This CEO is cool as hell.\nAlso obligatory #FuckEA
Yes he is right, EA is soulless monster...but everybody know that, do they?
Lmao We had one guy that left to join Pixar, hell I would've left to join PIxar. This CEO is a savage, EA is getting exposed.
well, you deal with one the worst companis ever, VERY know to kill franchises and studios....what were you expecting????
6:15:35 wwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhwwwwwwww - sincerity 100%\n\nso the guy is finally breaking the protocols while throwing a bomb at EA, and this fella was driving? hell yeah, bring me wayne¬¥s world handsome Dan scene.
Wonder how EA will react to this.
with my realism glasses on :   ian probably burned soo many bridges with the first project , that going on random streams is his only option for an interview.\n\nhowever , pre- ordered and cant wait to try it out  in a few hours from now.
Legend. I throw something hard and spikey at the person that tries to use anything said in this stream against Ian Bell. Open candid chat like this is becoming rarer and rarer and we all lose more to over bearing political correctness than we take damage from edgy chat. More humanity 4tw!
I like this video but the chase cam + the wheel = ridiculous... :/
it's not even humanly possible to read 150-200 books a year with a schedule like his.
Looks like EA secured 'Worst company of the Year' AGAIN with this.\nCongratulations! /slowclap
That was excellent, Ian is a legend.
Holy shit that got cringey at times but that was so cool.
Fuck EA
hahaha, EA loosing some on stockmarket :D https://goo.gl/VNecyT
Fuck EA.
On the Rallycross I'm trying to turn on practice side, the problem is that those tracks don't really have pit areas in the traditional way in real life, so on a lot of them we couldn't really enable practice sessions. You can of course use them in private practice, but having a practice session before a race isn't possible due to you having no place to take the car outside the track.
Fascinating stuff!
Really loved this, great conversation both ways. Ian Bell really impressed me and I'm so glad even though I'm skint at the moment I saved enough to buy the deluxe edition on steam, and can support both this and future PCars.  Thanks for sharing both.
I love how the puddle stayed there for a freaking long time (Around 3:40:00). This was one of the  (minor)  gripes I had with PCars weather system, while it looked great, the transitions were little to fast, and the track changed from full wet to dry in 2-3 laps. I havent even consider buying this game outside of a sale, but now, after watching several streams and listening to this, down to the earth, honest, interview, I preordered. So yeah, Ian, you made a customer by jumping drunk and sleep deprived into a random stream :)
i was there and he answered my question thank you so much mr Ian for the awesome time you spent with us and im pre loading PC2 now
That moment when you decide to boycott all EA games after they destroyed your beloved Mass Effect Series with Andromeda. I heard IAN in this video and I believe EA has done this to him. So I just bought Project Cars 2 for 80 euros and my machine will barely run it. I support the companies that deserve it such as Slightly Mad Studios and CDPR!\n\nPS: I work 12 hours a day and do not have to game anymore. You can imagine I did not need project cars 2 at all!
He gave away a few things he shouldn't have, he will be in trouble for some of the things he said for sure.
Whos this dude? Interested in him
Got a link to the entire thing? This link starts halfway through.
more bad things to add onto the pile of how bad ea is.
So, a thing Ian clarified, he's really not happy about the opinion of other people hahahaha. Is very subjective the realism feel. It can be awesome, but for some people is just not good enough or just it doesn't feel right, what are you going to do? Kill them? My goodness.\nHe's really arrogant, maybe they have the most advanced physics in the market, but the difference is in how you say things. Plenty of other games had and have racing drivers helping them, but they're not telling, we're elite, we are better than you, if you can't see that you're an idiot. That's precisely why I can't hear him for too long. And even with aaaaaaaall of that, I and many others can't stand playing PCars.
Hey man, it might be beneficial for you to put a time stamp down in the description that lets people skip to where Ian joins you on Discord!
First time here. Congratulations. Awesome interview indeed. The fact the CEO of SMS chose to come on live and open up about a range of topics speaks volumes about you and your channel. I've hit subscribe and look forward to seeing the channel develop and grow. Thank you
And here I am finished listening to the whole ~6hours of Q&A while trying to work. It surprisingly worked out fine. Entertaining AF. Especially Ians laughter.
sounds like Ian isn't telling all the truth
Isn't EA heavily associated with Microsoft? Makes sense then.
Great interview.. But, Ian, you've pissed off a lot of Scotsmen and probably your host with the rambling statement regarding the kilt. Perhaps you should read about the Dress Act 1746 mate -\nThat from and after the first day of August, One thousand, seven hundred and forty-six, no man or boy within that part of Britain called Scotland, other than such as shall be employed as Officers and Soldiers in His Majesty's Forces, shall, on any pretext whatever, wear or put on the clothes commonly called Highland clothes (that is to say) the Plaid, Philabeg, or little Kilt, Trowse, Shoulder-belts, or any part whatever of what peculiarly belongs to the Highland Garb; and that no tartan or party-coloured plaid of stuff shall be used for Great Coats or upper coats, and if any such person shall presume after the said first day of August, to wear or put on the aforesaid garment or any part of them, every such person so offending ... For the first offence,shall be liable to be imprisoned for 6 months, and on the second offence, to be transported to any of His Majesty's plantations beyond the seas, there to remain for the space of seven years. \nThe English government have tried to destroy our identity and culture for a very long time,  Saor Alba.
Great video, amazing stuff.\nAmazing to listen Ian praising Assetto Corsa, greatness recognizes greatness, never forget.\nBest part was listening Ian telling the simcade troll to funk off, these guys need to stop with this bullshit of bashing pCARS for not being a sim, it¬¥s a sim, a very good one. Full stop.\n\nThanks guys, you¬¥re amazing.
Hang on a minute... EA gave him 1.5 million... he blew that money then EA cancelled a game.. I am not really sure what they did wrong. I mean they cancelled a game.. that is it. Ian Bell sounds like a bit of cunt as well.. I mean I understand he is angry but he took the money told them they had access to the tech and then he scammed EA..
Best! Stream! Ever! üëå
Project cars has really shifted gears.
where is the money from wiiu version of project  cars ?
Why don't you finish eating before you start no one wants to see you eat?
And when we get pCARS 3?!
Oh and Ozzie, all the cars have multiple pre-saved setups on them (from launch on the PC and in a later update on consoles due to differences in how long it takes for patches to process on different platforms), on most cars you'll find a Stable and a Loose setup, on road cars you'll find an additional OEM setup that's supposed to be more like what the road condition car is (which might not be track friendly). If you find yourself struggling at first on the Loose setups (which is the default when using a wheel) go ahead and switch to the Stable ones, the brake balances and many other things are designed to be more resistant to things like sudden inputs etc. In the future if there's enough desire we might include stuff like pre-made low and high drag setups etc.\n\nOf course going over a crest while braking and turning is still going to be a though thing to handle no matter what the setup. =)
I am Bell is the biggest asshole in gaming. His company asked THOUSANDS if people to crowd fund his game, and then went out and got a publisher. He pocketed all of that crowd source money. He's a thief and a liar. Fucking asshole.
Ian Bell... Could you lie anymore?  Is such a thing even possible and at this point how can anyone besides the shills believe you?  You buy websites off to end negative coverage, surely you do it on YouTube as well.\n\nWould be very funny if EA sued you.  Oh God...the bells would ring, no pun intended.

This edit is perfection! The start was way cooler than anything on YouTube at the moment!!!! Loved it and appreciate the hard work you put in to create content üíïüíï
I know this isn't really relevant but you have such a beautiful body Helen!
anybody else waiting for jamie genevieve and helen to collab? cause i'm waiting. i think a grwm together would just be the best thing on earth.
Im not sure which Kat Von D palette you have but there is refillable version, and then when you use one shade you can just buy that one and replace it. :)
i loooove your freckles!!!
Love loveee the way you don't take make-up too seriously, makes it more fun! .. great inspo right there!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
1.30 in and I'm thinking GURL your skin is looking fabulous without makeup, is there a particular product your using for skin care that's doing that? It's looking real glowy and smooth and lovely, super jealous
Helen I think the Kat Von D palate has refillable pans so you could just get your favourite shade and replace it! I think anyway not 100% sure
I love how similar to your vlogs the intro is, i LIVE for them
your skin is looking incred!! love the style of this video <3
When you were going to put on your mascara and made the, bind them together now comment...I can't even tell you how hard I laughed at it. I was in tears! The voice you made and the face that went along with it. Hahahahahaha. <3
You have such original ideas and original ways of filming! I love your channel so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ooh that glitter looks amazing!
I love the color combo on the eyes
Dude are u ever stoned when filming these videos? Cos that would be awesome....
Loved how you did your intro! And at the end of the video your hair has this dark red kind of colour and I think it could suits you so much! But we'll never be tired of the purple one of course
YOU'RE SUCH A BABE
Glad it's not just me who looks half dead when they first put on their foundation cause I'm so pale üòÜ
kat von d have separate pans so you can refil the contour kits!!
It was SO lovely to see a latest on you doing makeup, havent really seen you do a makeup look in a long time. üòä xxx
you are off your head girl so funny, why all the foundation slap though like coco the clown when your skin is pretty without it , it's just a waist of money that clown stuff.  you should show your pretty freckles üòâ
Speaking of Harry Potter, you're a real life Tonks üòÑ love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I can tell your more crazy side is out more now!! Yay!
Miss Helen you look amazing üíúüíúüíú Loving the heavier eye makeup and your hair looks so shiny and luxe at the end!! Xx
I didn't think it was possible to be jealous of someone's eye socket shape, but every time you just throw eyeshadow on it is already this incredible shape.
This introduction is FRESH!! Feels super happy and professional xx seriously coooool!!
you need to tell us where you got your tape ins done at! <3
That was the most honest way of putting on eyelashes !!!! I struggle so hard because it's actually quite difficult.  So relatable !!!!! Oxoxooxox
This is one of the most beautiful looks & best edited GRWM videos I've ever seen, the quality of your videos keep going up and up, Helen üå∏‚ú®
I laughed so hard when you said YO im a shadow!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ xxx
You are hilarious ! That's why I always look forward to watching your video xx
Love this look. I find it easier to apply lashes when I put mascara on first then the lashes because they have something to stick onto  xx
It still amazes me how you can use both hands to do your makeup
Not sure if this has been said, or this is a really strange thing to say. But your jaw line is just magnificent!! xz
I'm always listening to the harry potter audiobooks while I'm working! It's great background noise when I can't be watching something!
Hey What's up from Ireland Sidney here uuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmm i love that look 2day uuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmm i love im watching u on my ps4 pro ps4 pro ps4 PlayStation vr rules
I hope everything's OK Helen.
Use a Suede shoe cleaner for the palette! Works like a charm. I use the Vans shoe cleaner (just because that's what I buy to clean all my Vans) but you can use any Suede shoe cleaner you can find üëç
This had me cracking up the whole time! bravo!
YO! im a shadoww :') you say the best things lol
Such a fun grwm üòÄYour super fun and charming. All the best to you ‚ù§Ô∏è
haha i loved the comment about doing your eyeshadow first - i do it first now too and it's soo much better!! i feel so weird doing foundation first now.
I am loving your re-vamped hair colour. Seriously, every single hair colour you have ever had is amazing. It always makes me want to dye my hair again. (I've had nearly every colour you can think of.) Also, make-up goals. (= xx
Love the intro, you put so much love and effort on your videos. Everytime I see a notification of you it makes my day üòöüòÑ
You are so cute and funny üòç
I love the way you use both of your hands, I'm so jealous!! üòç
Please don't ever change. I love you so much üòÇ your just you and that's great! üíñ
oooh the struggle! same happens to me when putting on lashes - same eye, same corner. utterly frustrating üòÖüòÖüòÖ
Hahaha. I thought I was the only one who had issues sticking eyelashes on. My reaction is pretty similar
you are so damn beautiful
I loved everything about this
omg helens hair is so shiny, it looks like its in great condition
I basically only ever wear makeup when I'm filming haha.....so I wore makeup today! I need to do my eyeshadow more often with eyeliner, I always love how you do yours!
üíúüíìüíúüíïüíïüíúüíìüíú\nLoved this video! \nYou probably won't see this comment being so busy, but can you do a FLAMINGO inspired makeup look? \nLove you! \nüíúüíìüíúüíûüíïüíúüíìüíú
I love your hair color üíú‚ù§
You should try getting a toothbrush to scrub off the dirt if it's just a fluffy velvety material :) it should be okay and not damage the packaging !
Where did you get ur new pallette! been trying to get my hands on one but haven't been successful:( pls help! x
Your makeup looks amazing, great video üíóüíó
Loved your energy in this! I think a little background music would have been cool too üòä
Savers sell Eyelure for cheaper if you have a store near by, they sell them for 2.99/3.99.
I keep my ABH palette in the cardboard sleeve so it doesn't get mucky ‚ù§Ô∏è
Loved this video. You are hilarious.
I like that you filmed the beginning like your vlog intos are. Always putting out fab content babes.
This was such a fun video! Love the make up look
The makeup is so cool! I wish I could rock this just like you do! Anyaway, the whole video was really beautiful, you are such an inspiration Helen
Helen, I fucking love you. This edit too! top bloody notch! <3
I have the electric palette and it says on the back that like 3 of the colors aren't meant for use on eyes. Kinda of silly for AN EYESHADOW PALLETTE. I mean, I do it anyway...but whatever.
Am I the only one who thinks you look and act like Helena bonham carter? I love your videos though ‚ù§Ô∏è x
Again. Your uniqueness shines through in your videos. I love how you don't take everything so serious! Loving the vlog style at the beginning of your vid too üòâ
This look is gorgeous and you are gorgeous üòçüòçüòç
Your intro inspired me to get my shit together :___D
Love your videos Helen!! What shade do you use in the too faced concealer? Xx ‚ù§Ô∏è
This vid is the best! üòÇ
loving your make up. also very much loving the mirror in the background, I'm looking for one just like it . It's amazing how we change the way we put on our make up with all these YouTube beauty bloggers teaching us how to do things right. I'm now 37 and for years i would use my hands and fingers for putting my foundation and eyeshadow on, oh the horror lol.....i mean what was primer.... eyebrows, well they were ignored and hidden under my fringe or should I see my very much very blonde barely there eyebrows lol. When I told my 13year old she had a look of shock n horror on her face as tho I had just licked the toilet bowl lol, have to say the kids more clued up on make up trends than me and when I tell her she doesn't need to use my primer she tells me times have changed now mum....boy I feel ancient lol
For a second I thought I was watching one of your vlogs because of the intro. I actually checked the channel lolz. Love this chatty relaxed get ready vid, your energy is infectious. Reminds me of your old melonlady video's but with better make-up skills ;)
Love the edit
Do you still have your septum pierced? xxxx
Gorgeous!!!

Had you had a drink before this video? You seemed a little lit and in a great mood üòÇ
Helen, you should definitely dye your hair burgundy after this color! The lighting made it look that way towards the end and it was gorge! You could even put darker parts in it, like lowlights.. For the edgy rock chick side of you üòâü§òüèº
your hair at the end looked dark, mahogany like! omg so suited u!!! do it do it do it
I wish my skin was naturally dryer, because as someone with naturally oily skin, when I put ON oils and cream foundations... oh my god. My skin can be clean and fresh to put them on, then an hour later I just look so oily. Even after setting spray, after everything. I have to stick to powder foundation and skip using any oil or moisturizer before makeup to avoid looking like a human toad. I stick to a good skin routine and I do moisturize my face before bed, but I can't wear makeup that has a lot of liquidity to it because I just go glossy. Does anyone else have this problem?? I wish there was a way to switch skin types because I feel if you have dry skin, you can moisturize it. If you have oily skin... Like what do. Sorry for rambling.
This is the first time i've heard that the Electric Palette had issues with the eye. LOL I'm american, I use it and have no issues. LOL The more you know.
Have you heard of the eyelashes that have tiny magnets on them? They have a top lash with a little magnet end and a bottom lash with a little magnet end. Then you sandwich your natural eyelashes in the middle of the falsies. I think they are suppose to stack on the outer parts of your eyelashes to make the outer corners more full. \nI haven't tried them but they look interesting. They are suppose to be lightweight so they don't harm your natural lashes. And I'm pretty sure they are reusable.
Gosh every video is sooooo good Helen! A round of applause to you darling
I wouldn't really say changed The reason why i like R&M is because the character development. It's growth. It was intended
Here's an interesting theory.\nWhat if our rick was the rick that visited the Rick in the flashback in S3E1.\nHe was the one who truly invented the portal gun, and ended up killing that rick's wife and daughter.\nThat would explain why he cried at that scene, and why he was able to alter it. because he just imagined what went on from the other rick's perspective. Maybe after that happened, the Rick whose family died tried to hunt down our rick. Maybe he became simple rick.
No, but Morty has!! Just look at him go! Hahahaha!
Oh and the Fake Reality. If it isn't Real then Rick Fantasize to be with Annie? xD
the rickest of ricks has no f*cks to give
maybe rick is being distant to morty because if he gets close, and when either he or morty dies or leaves the other suffers greatly which can lead to creating an evil morty due to a sense of betrayal and/or another suicidal rick.
Why are there so many douches psychoanalyzing Rick and Morty? Its a fucking cartoon comedy show.
I think it was A really interesting and important point that in the toxin episode, rick was shown that his feeling for his family is something about himself he sees as toxic. but so was the need to mascorade and hid his feelings, Thus in toxic rick, we see the extreme of both ends of the scale, and the detoxified rick no longer had this conflict.
He does care because his toxic side cared for morty, so when he put toxic rick back into him his care for morty came with it :)
It's called character development
Short answer; yes, it's called character development you nimbwit.
I played pocket mortys and found a picture on the floor at the right bathroom at the morty games. When you interact with it, a ghost rick comes and says that he will find his morty which might suggest that the rick you play as is not the original rick
Rick would be a cool grandpa
Has anyone considered that maybe rick turned himself in because he did care about the family, but because he didn't wan't us the viewer ( because he knows were watching) or his family to know he came up with the plan to destroy the galactic federation after he got caught to cover up his own weakness. \n\nI also think that rick knew that morty would get on the pad instead of noob noob because why all the other traps had stuff that would kill you if you got the answer wrong but and i think rick knew what drunk rick was up to since all through out the episode he seemed to understand the reasoning behind everything drunk rick was doing he only fucked up when he left his portal gun on the vindicators ship
Rick's burping less on this season, that's for sure
i see this channel is on point wit it.....may my thumbs up for this channel soar pass the heavens
What would be amazing: a rick and morty movie (and no even tho rick and morty is a parody of back to the future, it doesn't count)
I guess Rick has mood swings. Bipolar disorder maybe? Its just a cartoon, so probably not, but he's a genius, and geniusses usually arent very good at social things.
I'm not crying I'm just allergic to dipshits
Rick may change but Morty will never, Rick doesn't allow him.
This new season is gay a‚Äôf half assed
Remember when he got home in that one episode and searched the house for anyone to talk to, but then ended up sitting at the table by himself all sad. And when Morty walked in he was like MORTY! I mean.. hey. That would have been a great moment to highlight in the video.
Rick didn't change, the Pilot was just bad at portraying him.
how do we know he faked the backstory. ehat if all ricked did was change what the math said on the garage. so everything else could technically be true.
FUCK NO he hasn't changed. He's only getting worse. lol
Hehe i fond it so amusing that Rick is a sin wave. Lol.. sin..math...Yep, sums him up pretty good alright. Also youtube wouldnt let me in peace until i saw this video damn
I wonder if the reunion with unity is what really tipped the scales for Rick.
I think the purpose of rick and morty is to literally make people who try to find meaning and understanding in it go mad or sound like fools when failing explain it. Designed specifically to no be broken down into your tropes and misconceived ideas on how thing should be.
Yes, it's called character development. Rick is becoming more caring for his family and Morty is becoming more like Rick.
Finding meaning is a choice\n\nSelf delusion. The only meaning you can choose to find is one that isn't real. Or more accurately the concept of meaning itself isn't real.
I think Rick always cares but does not like showing it because it causes him deep emotional pain. Something must have happened to our Rick to make him this way.  Perhaps he realized that no one in his family is special and he can just move to a new reality where his family still exists and everything's the same.  He knows somewhere another Rick has done the same thing making it feel  pointless. He often breaks the fourth wall and is smart enough to know he is in a tv show and none of this is real. This would explain his depression and why he is constantly coming up with catchphrases. He does not want to be cancelled because he knows what happens if the show gets cancelled. His only function is to be our entertainment which is why he is so nihilistic.
You can't trust Rick. He always says he doesn't care, but he told Morty the only reason he saved Morty and Summer was so Beth would take him back, but why would he care about Beth if he doesn't care about her children? He loves Beth, Morty, and Summer. Loathes Jerry, but has a sweet spot for him because Jerry's the father of his grandkids. It's normal to hate inlaws though.
My English teachers always told me to use concrete examples/evidence to back up my claims. I'll find channels all the time that are lazy and could use more clips for examples of their point, and less of the show has A, but bc A, that means B and just playing unrelated scenes in the background. It grinds my gears.\n\nScreen Prism, you got, like, too many examples. How much time do you waste digging through content to exhaust every option that relates to each point you have? This channel is really underrated.
Ever since jerry left rick has started being a better person
The only thing thats permanent is change
rick lost his original morty, that's why he stopped caring......he was confronted with that and starts thinking about it more frequently. Original Morty isn't dead but pissed and takes over the Citadel of Ricks to get revenge?
The family he lives with in the show isn't even 'his' family as he potal jumped there shortly after the native rick died. It's also implied he's done this before so it's not surprising he's got minimal emotional connection
So, rick is a tsundere
Rick isn't changing and never will and the Rick and Morty bubble will pop soon
I don't want to see an emotional Rick...
I think it's just his character developing more.
Yeah he no longer has the lovable half assed doc brown impression voice
5:43 that is true... noob noob was the true hero of the episode. The universe is a cold place... even colder when your own family can't even pick up what you're laying down, and looks up to distant idols, rather than nearby heroes... \n\nSometimes all it takes is someone to bite into someone else's joke when they put it out there on the line, when no one else would... ü§î
Rick used to drool/burp mid speaking, he doesn't do it much now, other ricks do it but not the Rickest Rick
I feel realateable to Rick in the sense that whenever I feel to emotionally close to someone I push them away
They would all want to kill themselves if Rick did not erase their memories. Rick makes them go crazy.\nAlso, when Rick and Morty are forced to abandon living in different dimensions, like the Cronenberg episode or when Morty starts the squirrel reich, their family wouldn't know of the stuff that happened in the episodes before since they get swapped out.... Maybe Rick struggles so much because he's destroyed his own families' minds over and over again and no one else but him understands what it's like to be the smartest being in the universe.
Jesus Christ can someone please figure out the name of that outro song? I know they cited the music they used at the end of the video, but none of them matches up. Please help! @ScreenPrism
The reason why he cares but doesn't care is because he wants to make sure his enemies don't use them against him because they'll sense vulnerability.
Ugh the show is supposed to be crazy and weird, that's what makes it good, this vid is just trying to put reasoning behind everything that happens, just stop..please
i dont want rick to change\ni want him to be that same rick that was on a whole new level and didn't give a shit, he's a unique character and changing him by giving him deeper emotions would ruin the character
There's two Ricks, one with drool and one without. The sober one cares, the drunk one doesn't.
Rick is just an ass
At 8:11 Rick and Morty pull down the pants and underwear except Summer who leaves the underwear.
I like what you got GOOD JOB!
what is the music at 6.40
Take a shot every time theirs an unnecessary edit
Rick always showed equal signs of caring and signs of carelessness.\n\nHe has two parts of his character and is very dynamic, Ricks typically find emotions as a weakness when I think he can and has made it a strength.
Why does it feel like the quality drops in season 3.
rick is in deep conflict with himself. he's a man of science and therefore knows that a human life is basically worth as much as an ants life. and just like ants, it doesn't matter if he or anyone else dies. there's infinite ricks, his genious isn't special. he always says not to think about it. then he finds himself thinking about it and that goes against a rick's nature. it's like if chris hanson finds him self becoming a pedophile. that just shatters your selfperception.
That how a asshole acts
Maybe Rick does it because he might know he may lose them. Maybe he already lost a family and tries not to get too attached.
You know what the Rick and Morty soundtrack is just amazing!! I mean wow!
He doesn't want to get to close to north because if he loses him he knows he will be devastated
I'll say it again, this is called CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, it isn't something masterfully crafted, also the federation thing fell into his lap later on, you can't show genuine sadness and then turn back on it as part of the plan
He talks differently too. Burps less and says morty less
On this quizizz app that my school uses it pops up with stupid memes when u get a right answer and sometimes there is one where rick pops up and says wubba lubba dub dub and every time I see it I think about how it means pain and suffering and laugh
She sounds like the therapist from Pickle Rick
This theory is so stupid for so many reasons. It is revealed that Rick cares for morty in several ways. An example of this is Rick's idea of toxicity, which is his care for morty. And the part about morty telling summer that Rick left them was because he was protecting summer from the dangers of trying to help him.
You are seeking an explanation for a guy who thinks nothing matters, and life has no meaning. He is right, of course. But he is also acting on it instead of behaving as expected. Because unlike the rest of us who have to live among people despite of knowing the lack of meaning in life, he doesnt have to live among people and therefore he doesnt try to be likeable at all.
Who here wants to learn God?
Best explaination ive heard of his charactor and one that i fully agree with. Amazing video!!
Are you kidding meüòÇ who fuckin cares, there are much bigger secrets to find than emotions
...sooo...Rick is a...MAN...what a Fucking...revelation...(sigh)...\n(this is some feminist Bullshit.)\nNOBODY wants to see Rick care about shit. It would RUIN the show. You know, like how the Leftists have ruined America...(BELCH) :>)
He's not my rick, he's my partner OH JEEEEEEZZZZZ
wubba lubba dub dub!
This show is fucking overrated
Hahaa wobalaba dub dub dub thats funny right it's funny hahaha so funny no please stop
Rick has always cared about Morty
yea well no shit
Rick is basically choatic neutral.
Yes
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB
I think no
good video
Wabba lubba dub dub!
Niggers
Yes character development exists
Aww rick
Has Rick Changed \n\n\n\n\n\n*Obviously*
And
Rick is a Tsundere???
rick is a tsundere
*WUBBA WUBBA DUB DUB*
Morty swears much more
The smartest stupid show.
WUBBALUBBADUBDUB
wubba lubba dub dub for life
Ooo jeez, this show is terrible.
He was not taking about nopnob he was talking about Morty he was jest so drunk he wosint think straight
I hate it when people write a comment, get likes then edit it. Just leave it\nEdit: one like!!
Moron! Water doesn't hurt them... They just don't have the buoyancy to swim to the surface, it's not like they have breath in their lungs.
Season 1-4 was godly. The rest is shit, totally lost its edge. fuck d&d
so if there are a few female rulers in westeros, you call it feminist shit ??\n\nwe females LIVE in such a world, jackass
Hey Idjets! Remember the Ice King has Giants too! The water would have been about knee deep to them!
Game of Thrones thoughts: We got probably the last major piece of the Jon puzzle before he has to find out for himself. Jon and Dany got their hookup although it feels more ominous than it might have been otherwise given how the season ends and given that the scene was laid over with R+L=J exposition (Jon‚Äôs boning his aunt and Dany‚Äôs boning someone who can blow up her own claim, haha?). I still choose to believe the Night King deliberately set out to get a dragon, because the alternative ‚Äî he lucked into it and just happened to get the one thing he needed to breach the Wall through sheer dumb chance ‚Äî makes my brain hurt. I‚Äôm glad Littlefinger‚Äôs done. I feel like next season I will be bored with whatever they‚Äôre doing with the Iron Islands and Theon/Yara/Euron. On the one hand I wonder how they‚Äôll fill next season given the immediacy of the Others now being over the Wall, but there‚Äôs still stuff that they need to resolve: the Cleganes, Jon‚Äôs parentage, Cersei and her valonqar, Sam finding out what Dany did to his family, and the stupid ironborn. I do wonder how they‚Äôll balance the non-magical stuff with the magical stuff now that the Wall‚Äôs breached. I guess we have a while to think about it and maybe we‚Äôll have the sixth book by then to help us figure it all out.
The end of this last season was disappointing.  Everything was happening way too fast when in previous seasons much smaller events were drawn out over many episodes.
Oh bone heads, they're controlled by which ever white walker turned them, they can get it water but cannot swim, the fucks that got controlled to do the chains couldn't get back up cause they can't swim, they were sacrificed. At hardhome the walkers said NOPE don't go in that water bitches cause u can't swim to the surface to get them in a boat so it would be pointless, come on u dumb fucks.
Norton's face when he realises that Eddie is right is hilarious.
what is the dragon's taxation plan?
Maybe the ice king just froze the whole lake.
They probably just walked with the chain and fell down without getting up, just for the purpose on hooking on that chain. Easy as that, they wouldnt care cuz they are dead. Westeros is basicly the size of England so it isnt as bad. Eddy bravo needs and education haha
Eddie worried about Game of Thrones army of the Dead talking about its ridiculous. But still believes the earths flat?!?!
Ok well maybe they just used hooks the motherfucker was dead a hook isn't gonna hurt it if you're bringing it back as a white walker so do what you gotta do I'm just trying to rectify this bullshit so I can continue watching lol how does bran the three eyed raven ever take a shit
He's not wrong, about the water and the dragon.
GoT was good until season 3. After that it went downhill and it became a SJW shitfest with pathetic writing.
They sink in water, can't swim. Easy enough to let a few sink to the bottom attach chains to the dragon and then leave them. Why is this so hard for people to get their head around?
That bad dude looks like a fucking meth head. Who is that?
I though Eddie was gonna tell  us if look into it
jon, jamie and bronn also seem to be able to breath under water and swim with armor, and I think that it's clear that the showrunners just want to finish it now. Some have said Martin only have seen some of s6 like the battle of the bastards but other then that he doesn't consult or write for them anymore, some say it's because he is too busy writing, which I can very well believe but if you don't mention a show that is based on your work and instead say how much you enjoy another fantasy show, it's a sign that he's not pleased. Not everyone loves the ASOIAF books but I think everyone would agree that Martin would never write himself into such a corner that he would require to bend space and time and had to create 4 hero shields, two of which Jon used in 1 episode. Game of Thrones was the prime example of how to do an ex machina, where the setup of how the situation was resolved was forshadowed and hinted at so that you can go back and see that it was a natural progression of the story. But episode 6 this season literally reminded me of the same feeling BvS gave me which was alot of great and awsome individual scenes but the story didn't make sense and I couldn't feel as excited as I wanted about the fact that we saw the night king kill a dragon, cause just like in BvS the reasoning was non existent. Tyrion failing as a battle commander? totally understandable, jamie should be able to outsmart him in that area. Tyrion coming up with the most stupid plan however is not fitting to his character. And WTF happened to Dany? If it turns out that her inevitable dementia has kicked earlier then expected, and they reveal it in s8 I will give the writers props but if not then they have made a huge mistake. She's never been good at looking at the long term picture because she is so obessed with only what's right infront of her but come on, when Jon said at the very least your better then Cersei ye no shit, psychopathy isn't really a good quality for a ruler to have. That doesn't change the fact that she argued like a spoiled brat this season, insisting on everyone should continue the pledge of their forefathers. Acknowledging that she had an evil father but that is about as far as her humility goes, she says she wants to be told when she has failed but when Tyrion then actually dares to confront her. -she gets angry for not having a reasonable argument to give him so she instead snaps at him. Even hinting that Tyrion might be looking for a way to get her killed so that he can take over when he is the only one that understand that the change she wants to make will never happen in their life times but that with the right people in the right positions it could be the start of the process of democracy they just don't know what that means yet.
How about the fact that she flew like 1000 miles in a day, somehow holding on to the dragon by nothing but the spikes. And then somehow found their precise GPS location in order to save them.  How could she have possibly known where they were? Every episode is filled with dumb shit like this now. That's why people are getting mad at it.
The last 3 seasons have been utter garbage
Lol bravo is a huge idiot but man he's hilarious
Game of Thrones has sucked since season 5 when they stopped actually following novels.  Those D&D clowns are just mediocre writers.
They can get in water...they just can't swim Eddie lol
Valar morgules all men must die! Only wemen left in westros by the end
Where are the iron mines, forges and smiths to build those chains?
The scene with viserion being brought back should have been left out for several reasons. First, we knew it was going to happen. Second, it would have had much more impact seeing him at the end of the season if that was the first time we had seen him undead. Finally, they could have avoided all of that nonsense with the chain.\n\nThe shows quality is a far cry from what it was back in season 3 and 4, though it is still the best thing on tv right now, even if it is only for the set pieces.
im sold. the earth is flat.
Yeah they can't swim but they can go in water and sink come one they pulled some people in the water
They cant swim is why they dont like water, so sinking to the bottom of a lake and tying up a dragon shouldn't be a problem.
Bravo is a fucking idiot !!! He's actually arguing about how real this and that is on got !!! Its a fucking fantasy with dragons and zombies and magic !! u dumbass none of it is real or makes sense its fiction not a documentary
Eddie is easily a top 5 on the guests list
It's a conspiracy about that dragon and how they got it out. Someone should look into it...
It does take months... they just don't show it in the show
They cant swim but they can still sink to the bottom
Someone hire Eddie to tie up the fukn Dragon right now
What about the plot hole where the sand snakes magically teleport on Jamie lanasters boat murder that dornish prince but for some reason don't murder jamie lanaster the family they hate.
Its never stated that water hurts them, I think they cannot swim because since they are not breathing they do not have the oxygen in their bodies for buoyancy, so if they go in water they will just sink.
I¬¥ve never thought that the white walkers cant swim. Just the whights.
The Night King isn't a white. He can go in the water and use crazy magic obviously....
Edgy Brah would merk the Night King in a jiu-jitsu match.
They can get into water, they just cant swim
This season was full of plot holes and some really crazy shit that just didnt make sense. I dont understand why they are rushing to finish the highest rated show hbo has ever had. Still it was entertaining as fuck!
Got isn't also real
I wannt to be one of those dragon spikes!
Joe - you absolutely must watch Jon Snow Gets to Work. Look it up - NOW
Another episode of Eddie Bravo talking absolute shite and Joe not calling him out because Eddie could tie him up like a boa constrictor
also got timeline is not linear and never has been get over it.
Not to mention the reason why there was water in earlier season was because winter hadn't truly come yet, until this season hence the term winter is coming lol
The wights are dead reanimated..cant swim...the White walkers are not.
Also why didn't he start chucking sprees at him when he was on that island
Maybe the white walkers tied up the dragon not the dead people
Drop the chains and drag it in the bottom until it hooks the dragon
Maybe they dropped anchors down from the surface and dragged it up after catching it on the hooks?
Eddie bravo- I'm CRAZY bro!  All I'm saying is that if I don't see it with my own eyes I don't believe it. Go on you tube and watch the video zombies can't swim. It will explain everything. I'm crazy!
then when you find out all the chicks on GOT are trangendered boys
I loved the episode where Dany, Jon and everyone was standing on the beach and in the next scene she's on the other side of the continent with an entire army. Then they cut back to the beach and everyone is still standing there.
You can tell Eddie really loves and cares about the series. They really did take a giant shit on this last season.
Is it me or is Joe Rogan giving Eddie the evil eye?
Early on in the show if I remember they did better on showing how long it took to go to places. But there was only another season left now so they really have to speed up the travels just to get the story going.
I have never watched game of thrones and never will, because its got fucking dragons, and people are getting erections when talking about a red wedding were people get killed. Im not kidding, that red wedding thing makes people bust loads that rips their pants and hits the wall. Its so silly.\n\nIf i want a fantasy movie i just watch lotr or something.
game of thrones sucks\n couldn't even finish the 1st episode
Eddie you're talking about fuckin dragons and riding them???? Dragons not fuckin real. Lol. But Eddie spoilt it for me with dragon dragged out of the water. Maybe earth is flat??? Lol
Khaleesi dropping a deuce(getting diarhhea) was descrbied in vivid detail in one of the books.
We don't know for sure if the White Walkers can't swim, just that the zombies can't swim. I could see one or two White Walkers swimming down there and attaching some chains to a dragon. Then the wights are just on pull duty.
eddie fucking bravo is on the next level
Hodor's gonna come back and bitch-slap stupid Bran.
if you throw a glock into a swimming pool I can go in and get it but if you take off on a speed boat across the ocean I can't get you... pretty obvious
they snagged the dragon with a hook!!!!
They have shown they can't swim but CAN enter water. Wasting thousands to kill 5 guys = not worth it. Wasting a few dozen to rez a dragon = worth it.
season 7 was the best season so far.  -- Exemplifies why I can't stand Jim Norton. Him as successful comedian makes as much sense as Donald Trump being president.
Jim Norton is an unfunny, despicable disgusting vile fucking human being. Why is he trying to revamp his image at his age? He portrayed himself as the loser that he is all his life, all of a sudden he becomes an 'MMA' guy and he buys a leather jacket? Ok Jim....stick to fucking lady boys in Thailand and stop this cringe you slack jawed yokel. He is 49 but looks 103, looks like Hans Moleman.
They dropped the chains down with anchor style hooks, and dragged it out you could have pulled the chains truller style, so with enough of them it would be easy to drag the dragons out using the chains without entering the water.
sorry i have to do this eddie but you dont know shit about medieval fantasy. THEY SUMMONED it. loook into it.
I understand the show version. Book version is way more thought out but i drive most of the day for work and audible is awsome. I know alot of show watchers cant read or (listen) but it makes more sense
There was already a bunch of Deadites at the bottom of the lake from the battle, right? Case solved.
Obviously they let the giant tie the dragon, the water wasn't probably very deep. He's strong enough to carry the chain and he's tall enough to not just drown, assuming the water isnt extremely deep he could stand in the water, unlike the normal white walkers who would just sink to the bottom
I don't like how so many people don't see the difference between white walkers and the Others
In a world where dragons, wizards and other magical things exist Eddie is questioning how'd the chains get down there? Lolz
They just sink. There's nothing about water specifically that hurts them.
A Dragon blew up Tower 6!
Well if it's Redondo Beach to Hollywood, the armies can take the freeways so it's much faster.
Someone in the comments section said that, since the Night King was likely a sorcerer, he was probably able to create chains from magic.
So here is my theory for Eddie Bravo, I hope you see this. It seems that the white walker commanders have the same type of remote viewing ability and all knowing ability that Bran possesses as the Ravens Eye or w/e the fuck it's called. So that tells me that the commanders knew about the entire plan, as well as the dragons, and they chose not to advance on the group and didn't not advance because they couldn't, it seemed they were completely capable of killing that entire group including jon snow whenever they wanted to, they used that group to bait out the dragons so they could kill and revive one. That answers that part. In terms of how they are moving the big heavy dragons, they have Giants. Also in terms of who as you put it scuba dived down to put the chains on to begin with, I have to assume it was someone from the command of the white walker army being as they clearly possess abilities and greater powers than the zombies, as you can see they killed the dragon with one shot from a spear thrown from his hand, they could have clearly and easily killed all of the people stranded. So , I don't think there are quite as many holes as you think, I think the real only question would be exactly how they got the chains down to begin with, but that could be explained through the greater power and magic of the white walker commanders.
Rome had a sanitation system; medieval cities did not.
Eddie Bravo is a genius!
This dude is half a tard. I'm supposed to respect his opinion because he's good at jujitsu? GTFO.
eddie sounds like every 9gager lol
Dragongate
The giants put the chains maybe?
Fished him out
Eddie Bravo is an actual retard. 75 IQ
Magic muthafacka!
I'M CRAAAAZY!
They have giants.
Eddie schools Joe. ¬† Finalllllly. ¬†Joe is Eddie b88ch.
lmao ayyy Eddie is funny af
5:36 - 6:12 had me dying
hahaha eddies the best
Edgy Brah pointin' out plot holes in ALL official narratives
I CAN'T WAIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOR STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT 2
Big fucking open world map , a just 4 v 4 players in the map , great job Ubisoft.
such a big map and only a few maps to play, smh
This is going to be amazing, I still play this game faithfully. I just hope we can customize class looks and weapons.
Everyone who is saying you should of made it battle royale style I agree but don't forget we're talking about Ubisoft a company heavily known for having some of the worst servers in all of gaming. You really think they can support the whole map with 50-150 people, hell no ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I love how all the people dropping the negativity will be the ones who play the new 4v4 the most. Haters are your biggest fans! thanks ubisoft
Make that i can choose costumes like in singleplayer pls.
Is the PVP really confirmed or are they just testing the PVP?
tinha que ter modo battle royle pq o mapa √© enorme
So there are 6 classes now ? never played the game, should i get it ?
Can't wait for this I just got the game and really enjoying it
They are cheesing that voice actor
I love this game and R6S
Aaaaaand they fucked up GR. Rip. You will be missed.
Awesome! Going to be a cool mode for ghost recon wildlands I can't wait to see what it holds.!
I honestly can't believe you made a team in your building dedicate time and effort for a 4v4 pvp on a huge expansive open world map, only to limit it to little zones. \n\nI mean, wow. No wonder your user bases die within a matter of weeks after a game launch. Rainbow Six being the only exceptions miraculously.
I'm actually happy there are no sniper rifles in this.  Seems like a lot of map for hiding on the edges all the time.  Time to shakes things up n see how everyone plays
Took long enough almost flicked the game
I'm not one that needs PvP but this looks kickass
Can't wait wish they had sniper class because what's what I play on the hardest mode and they never see me coming lmao
Make a battle royal mode !!!
Give us some new aircrafts and some actual tanks üôÑ
No Helicopters,Tanks And cars?
Who wants this when de have pubg
DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS BETA it doesn't work at all and there's only 60-70 players on Xbox at a time it's a waste of time. lol I bought this game and the season pass and this is what I, among many others get? lol scrap the game issue refunds appropriately and try again in 5 years
this game died before it got out! and still no PvP..... Ubisoft lol what a joke!
when pre download beta come in ps store thailand ps4 ver. dev , community tell me....
I like for this
Is that the doom(2017) music?
Nice. But I still can't wait for you guys to add the new special forces weapons of choice to the game, the H&K 416 and 417. And to add in the legendary M16 A3 & A4 models. I dont even know how the game was made without these badass weapons in the first place. I'd love to see a update adding those in the game. I'd buy them from the store anyday.
Would really like to see at least 10vs10 but I'll give it a shot
I played the closed beta and I will play the open beta.  I played a couple hundred hours of coop and it is a great game.  But I must say that you guys are a little late to the party with this.
Y'all need an open world pvp where when you spawn in you get put on one of two teams and there like 16 on each team and you can do missions or whatever or you could go attack the other team and maybe even through in like fortress raids pvp
What a lot of people don't get is that the reason its this and not battle royale like we all wanted is because they'd have to pay for servers for that but with this instead its p2p so the host will be a player in the game and not a ubisoft dedicated server
You gave me a reason to play this game againüòÉ
need to have the game or its free beta
This looks like the most dummest and boring thing they can make and I like ghost recon
Make it like pubg and ad like 32vs32 and i might pick it up
This game is dead
I deleted this game from computer after 10 hours and nothing will make me install it.
Hopefully there is a hardcore mode
You‚Äôve got this huge map and are only doing 4v4? Lol this will be dead before it comes out.
This is the cheesiest trailer I've ever seen
Only thing I see is 3rd person advantage
Don't care most players want new stuff for the co-op
Obviously not the PS4 version being shown, as it wasn't plagued by massive amounts of pop in.\n Seriously, this is the most pop in I've seen on any Ubisoft game. I don't expect perfection on a massive open world....but it has A LOT. Much more in comparison to any other open world game from even five years ago.
Yes!! Can't wait\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause I have no PSN account and I can't play it!!!
When will it actually come out after the BETA
Tried it and its shite
Idk which class I'm thinking bout going tank or enforcer
4 v 4 pvp is not a good idea....stop doing this small team bullshit ubisoft ffs
coming out 9/24/2021 \nedit i‚Äôm excited tho
Creat battle royale in this game
Can't wait to play it it looks awesome
This game died before the beta even ended üòï
Has Ubisoft confirmed that they will ONLY do a 4 v 4 PvP mode? Or is that just for the Beta???
Cool beta
Boring!!!
this game has the potential to be the next socom. Throw in some objectives and open the map more and you've got yourself a competitive game that online gamers haven't seen in years. none of this casual, cs go/overwatch garbage
More the Crew 2
Make a battle royale mode like everyone else or a TDM mode with a big team scattered in squads, the game has a big map USE IT WELL FOR GOD SAKE!
jizzing my pants
Aaaaarrrgh! Start now!
This looks absolutely terrible
Age really
LOL
I hope there is a sniper class
HELL YA
ill have to wait to play but i dont see this working like they plan to. whats to stop us from just sniping off the team while throwing down an airstrike. theres only 4 people i dont see matches lasting very long
Should have a battle royale mode
You gotta love that bfh theme music lol.
Can we please customize or Bot please man I hate their  uniform

This looks fine, but I really wish you had stuck with a core four class system. Breaking it up into a dozen classes makes none of them feel particularly special. FWIW, I would be much more interested in a coop attack/defend mode than 4v4 PVP.
why just 4vs4 üò¢üò¢
Will we get access to the R4, MDR, BFG 50, PSG1 or any other guns from dlc?
Awesome
1:23 it's twitch
Game is dead
Nicee
Basuda
Me gust√≥ mucho ese juegos de Goku rico se ve brutal

Ubishit
Lol\nBoring!
YES
What! No sniper
Si on a achet√© Ghost recon wildlands deluxe √©dition est-ce que on aura ghost war gratuitement?
Listen to the people Ubisoft. This is okay but for months we been begging for something more. Atleast make it 8v8 or 6v6
Wait, is that dude at the end in a red shirt a new operator or someone revealed?
Ubi there's a website called r6credits.com giving out free credits please take it down as it could be a scam or the real deal
Can they just stop trying to make people buy or still play this game. Ubisoft just needs to admit that they fucked up
All you guys had to do was bring back Future Soldier's PvP, and just fix the hacking problem.
I want to play this so bad I have a 4 person group on ghost we're going to rek people
They're trying to pull of the no mans sky. Putting things in the game that were supposed to be in there in the first place. Putting all this effort in this and I'm sure it'll all be dead within a month. Everyone has already moved on or completed the game already. Ive already got all the achievements in this game and if this has no achievements in this there's 0 reason to go back to this game and play this....0
Cod is to Internet hungry have to have real fast speed or you are always behind , I can't get fast enough Internet so.i hope this is as bad
Lame. You could and should have made it much simpler. Give everyone three armor options, a list of guns to choose and let them see who's best. Now it's about who picked the best class talents. This is another typical, run of the mill shooter for children with ADD and no skill. Long live SOCOM!
Have some played the beta? And is the gunplay better more fluid? In the base game it's complete trash :(
Wildlands has its quirks but as an Hour to burn with a buddy COOP game it sure was worth my money. not every title released under the sun needs PVP. Hell, the last thing we need is a PVP saturated market. When this game was released I never expected it to have PVP, At most I expected COOP. the PVP here feels tacked on to please people, that's my biggest complaint at the moment.\n\nit may just my personal opinion, but damn, you want Battle Royale? play PUBG hell, Im sure its gun-play is better than Wildlands.
can I get likes for no reason?
Good win!
Listen carefully to Vardy congratulating Slimani, does he say why don't you do that all the time? üòä
guess come Leicester come Leicester come Leicester come Leicester come Leicester come Leicester come Leicester come Leicester I'm season ticket
Decent game overall; should've been battered first half but second half mainly due to Shinji Okazaki we improved drastically
what a game!!!

The South ruined hip-hop.
Takeoff actually spoke in a interview
Anyone else notice this nigga offset change his attitude? Looks like he trying to act more accordingly
Even though this was short I learnt a lot about the Migos and it helped me appreciate each member individually!
When Quavo starts talking about an album with Travis and him everyone else looks real sad.
Montreality doin a hell of a job.creative team and design team.good job guys.oh plus the interviews are dope..gems and jewels
Takeoff finally talking!? Is the world ending ü§î

Im sorry but that red lip stick doesnt go good on you
i like your clothes than kylie
OMG I freaking love you more and more each day. Is it just me or do I love love love your natural eyebrows. Don't fill them in anymore I just fell in love with them they are like legit perfection. And also I have an amazing DIY that I know you might like since your always this over the top fashionista and have your PhD in shoes. The DIY is to recreate in your own version the shoes that Rhianna gave JLo as a gift for her music video Ain't Your Mama. I freaking fell in love with those shoes they are denim over the knee high heel boots with a belt around the waist and they are attached to the belt. If you end up doing this DIY I will freaking love you for life because I've been wanting them but they are a wapping 3 or 4 grand. Thank you so much and I love you so much. #MOM

GUYS! EVERYONE IS SAYING THIS IS HER LAST VIDEO (ON HER CHANNEL) WITH BLONDE HAIR!!!!!!
Wow first time I heard Lauren say damn
THIS WAS SOOO WELL DONE ü§óüòëüòùü§óüòéüòéüòùüòõü§óüòùüòóüòóüòùüòóüòãüòóüòóüòùü§óü§óüòõü§ë
Lol you took the words right out of my mouth
She should make this the song at the end of her video!! She has had the other one for sooooooo long
Hey Lauren me and my friends are dancers and we were wondering if it's ok that we dance to your song
In my opinion, I prefer the Gabbie Show music. üòç
Every single youtubers song is horrible. They cannot rap or sing.
yes its a bomb lyrics yas luv it but the way lauren raps no
They dont know that life of Laur D I Y!!!!
I think my friend Frances was inspired by you to craft etc because last year I never really SO her be creative or be good at art. Thanks for inspiring her, me and many others! üòÖüòáüòä ~ Isabelle
I wish this as musically and I would just DOUBLE TAP FOR LIFEEEEEE!
OMG AWESOME
This on musiclly yet?üòÇ
Slay!!!
Give you credit for the video but the lyrics aren't that good ü§îüíú
This song is 100x better than ANY Jake Paul songüòÇ\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry for bringing him upüòµ
I hope this is a jokeüòÇüòÇI used to watch her a lot but who makes a rap about DIYs üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Lauren is already amazing I really don‚Äôt think it was necessary to make a song...
ok why is everyone suddenly becoming a singer
This is a piece of *shit*
If you bash this ill fuckin say your a bich
So fake it's funny.
The Muslims are at it again!
At least no one died though.. good job it was a bag for life
Turns out someone had just left a Samsung phone in the Lidl bag
How did a burning bucket manage to injure 18 people and spew a fireball through carriages if it couldn't make it past a plastic bucket confused...?
In Russia you attack the terrorists
amazing how strong those lidl plastic bags for life are,  they truly do mean bag for lf! \ni might make a house and a car out of em they're that strong
The passengers' burnt hair has now been culturally enriched !
Wake up people your government are terrorising YOU. Staged event.
The religion of Stone Age, pedophile worshipping, war mongering, women oppressing filth taking responsibility again
We've gone from flying planes into the Pentagon to a bucket full of fairy lights in a Lidl bag. We just don't have the budget the big American blockbusters have.
what a terrible dumb person to do this,  childish behaviour and all those injuries to people, I saw a couple lad with guys jeans split and loads more with shoes missing,  the initial blast must have been fierce , they all deserve 6 months test and up to 7k in compensation claims
bucket on fire? godda be a damn bomb made by isis
Why would a woman leave her most important possesion her hand bag
They all have to go back where they came from.
FALSE FLAG!   hey London slow down, theses aren't even fooling kids anymore!
Well; one things for certain. Lidl bucket sales are going to plummet. You'd better warn anyone who doesn't follow the news not to buy one and take it home using the underground otherwise they are liable to get shot by the Anti-terror squad.
Ok so a bomb goes off on the tube, what do you do? You film the flaming leftovers, not knowing how dangerous it still is.
Let me guess, the lidl bag had mental problems, and suffered from islamaphobia, the bag will be given counselling and a ¬£5000 payout, sadik khan will hail the bag as a hero
at 0.8 the women must be a member of mensa .or Steve harking teacher ..

I believe Air is water to fish
HaHaHAHAHAHAHhH only in Britain would they be afraid of a bag on a train that was set on fire HAHAHA NewYork has trains with trash cans on fire every day üòÇüòÇ
Let's just go and look at it why don't we....
I wonder if Islamic State took responsibilty for this as it was a complete failiure. Knowing them idiots they probably did.
What kind of idiot gets closer to the still flaming bomb, for a better look.
also known as a bucket, on fire.
is it because of the explosion?
, trojan horse you take in teenagers for abroad cloves  them feed them house them and they try to blow up a train full of people
how can 27 people get injured but no damage to the train looks like the bag got burnt with the bomb in
Zero bomb damage on train...
let in a couple hundred thousand more Refugees pretty soon you guys are going to become the Refugees.
oh that bags on fire ?  lets move in closer to get a better look could be a bomb.
I am new so who will subscribe me and give likes on my video I will subscribe him/her return
A gift from the religion of peace
Device~ pile of trash you mean
and i was wondering why the delay
Oh look, it's a bomb!  Let's go take a selfie with it!
It seem like my lidl bag done suicide.\nYou lived a great life...
Burning device mATE THAT'S A BLOODY BOMB!
The British are gas burning lidi bag on tube (turns terror level to critical)
Im really confused guys, please someone explain whats going on
Wow why do people bring the note 7 on the tube ffs
Oh look, something has exploded.... lets stand and watch it for a bit......
Oh no! the note 7 strikes again!
1 minute silence \nAs we stare at a bag
Oh god the note strikes again
That's the bomb apparently...
At which point did Mr 'Crowley' burn all his hair off.......
Guys I'm doing a legit give away on my channel all you need to do is follow me on sc joe_moakes\nSubscribe \nIt is a iPhone 6s and I pad mini 2
I'm going to guess the ethnicity of the bomber?\n\nChinese? No\n\nOkay then.....Canadian? No.\n\nBritish-white. I mean hell that is the majority of people in the country? No.\n\nHow about Irish? They do have history. No, no the man wasn't Irish?\n\n\nJewish, I bet the bomber was Jewish!!! No, no the bomber wasn't Jewish.\n\n\nHe was a Muslim? Jesus I would have never guessed that. That is so out of character.
EVERYTIME JUST DROP THE SAME BOMB ON MECCA !!
Some people in the comments are unbelievably stupid. \n\nIt was a fireball, enough to singe light clothing, hair and burn skin, it was hardly napalm. You need to create a long lasting fire to have any damage to the train interior.
Media: this terrorist attack has links with Isis \nIsis: someone say terrorist attack?... yeah it was is
Bloody Muslims up to no good again
Pray for the 22 injured... 1 like = 1 prayer
I see the bucket was unharmed, and it's surrounding area ...
I guess someone didn't listen to the reviews on the Note 7, smh
Its a lidl bag not a device....
Is that a Galaxy Note 7?
MrShrimpton said it was der Germans.???
The woman who is pointing at the bucket, why is her back splattered with  the milky substance that the bucket supposedly contains and why is she carry a very familiar looking flag with stars, in her hand, was she supposed to be a crisis actor victim and then given another role?
Who is filming this and why .
Divide and conquer.  Conquer then divide some more. Thanks evil govts!
How can a bomb injure 20 people but not even damage the train carriage or even the plastic bag that surrounded it?
Yeah just stand in front and gather around a bomb.
It could be a dildo vibrator that's overheating. That's my surmise.
Such a fake terror event - see Ole Dammegard's work.  This bomb that put so many people in hospital, didn't even throw smut or soot on the adjacent walls, windows or fabric seats of the tube train.  So it can't have exploded or sent fireballs down the train.  It's a shame people got trampled, but this is such a bad hoax.
BREAKING NEWS!!  the bag was completely incinerated, however, the attackers passport managed to be blown to the other side of the cabin from the explosion.... this is the news; we don't lie to you....
What a waste of 10p.
Why is this 1 on trending?
Islam is cancer
Bultoraune
nice coat
London is lost
hmmmm
Congrats on trending
Why is this trending
Damn those LIDL carrier bags are made strong. ü§î
(((pure coincidence)))
Omg
psy op
The HOAXes are getting ridiculous
What ?
Guess who's school was evacuated
Lots of comments here trying to be funny but if this device had gone off as intended, everyone on that carriage would be dead.
Must be terrible to be paranoid every day about the Muslims you brought in and gave benifits and houses to blowing you up.
ISIS Claimed the device, but LIDL beat them to it! ¬£9.99
Add my Snapchat thxmaswiltshire
Hi guys if u sub to me I will sub back
For all the people saying 'Don't automatically assume it is muslims' or 'you don't know if it was a Muslim' actually, it's been revealed on the news today that it WAS a Muslim, from Iraq so stfuüòå it always is Muslims, I don't know why people are always protecting them and trying to act like they're so innocent, when they're obviously not...
Can't be that bad, the train still has its GLASS
the new iphone
Why is this still trending
did they find tyler in that carriage
If I was them people I would of broke the glass and put that fire out.
19 people involved and burnt alive and yet the bucket and bag is intact..... how gullable are the British
Lets Play Russian Roulette üî´\nEvery 5th like gets Killed üí•\nComment What You Got üëá
It's important to remember that this was the action of an extremist,  and that he doesn't represent all Muslims. I, a white atheist, think it's important to protect our Muslims friends in the innevitable influx of anti-islamic hate crimes.
I seriously had a very difficult time uploading this. I don't like to put anything in my videos that might bring your mood down so please forgive me. I just need to start opening up a little more for you guys so you can understand some of the things that are taking away from the vlogs. Thank you so much for being here either way. I love you so much. See you Tomorrow. :)
I live inChicago
Awesome Vid + Sad Vid
*OMFG* Sorry did not mean that -F- ;)
Dude I took a pic with you at Gordianos in Chicago that was lit!!!!!!
I watch everything
I am subscribe
Vent away
You gotta do what you gotta do Roman. I feel that you balance your every day life with fam and work pretty well. Those of you that don't understand what real life is, well he just basically told you. We have to juggle work, family, and that grey haired word, stress. Keep doing what you do Roman, you give my household the positivity we need on a daily basis. My kids love watching you and your family, do what you do. I have also grown to love watching you guys. Take care and be safe in all you do! üòä
Stress? I just went through hurricane Irma. We got hit head on. Day 13 of no power or water because we have a well. We been using gallons of water to bath. We spent the first week after the hurricane looking for gas which was nowhere to be found. We lost 75% of our food that was refrigerated. We had major damage and flooding. I'm out ta work because the place I worked at was damaged bad by the hurricane. There are people who lost their homes, people who lost their lives because of the hurricane. We are trying to rebuild and its hard, stressful and emotional. I'd do anything to be in your shoes rather than dealing with what we are dealing with.  I just keep telling myself that God has this.
Haters gona hate
Hey Roman - all of us are sending you big hugs and sharing our strength with you.  Stay positive and smile
You and your family Change my life everyday im glad you did this vlog your REAL life its awesome you share
Roman if you need to take a break from the vlogs so you won‚Äôt be so stressed and so you can sleep then go ahead. I‚Äôm not just a fan, I‚Äôm a caring fan and I love you. There will not be anything that you post that I don‚Äôt watch. You‚Äôre amazing!
Oh my god, why are so many people being dicks for no reason, if you don't like his work, don't watch him, it's that simple.
Love your vlogs and do what you have to do. Smile more üòùüòúüòõ
I love you roman and your doing an amazing job keep it up !! üôåüèΩüíØ
I watch every video to the end
We still love you!! its life and you do what you have to do!  Love you all
It makes me sad to know ppl get upset that you leave you family. You're doing big things and ppl definitely need to remember that. Me and my boys watch your videos almost every school night just before bed. They look up to you and rightfully so. I admire your dedication to your family and respect your Drive. You need to do what you are happy with. If it's your project put whatever the fluff you want in it lol. As for the vlogs we would all miss you if you took a break but if that'll help just know your supporters will be here whenever you'd return. Your doing wonderful things for so many ppl so just remember that. Your human and sometimes you just have to step back and asses things, figure things out. Chat with Brit & the boys about how to make it better and easier on all of you. At the end of the day you'll always have fans that support you and your family is always there. So just take a minute to think about what's the best option right now and go from there. Sending lots of love from our family straight to yours. Xoxo \nCheers
OMG I did not see this vid straight away and I missed my opportunity to see Roman Atwood!! WHYYYY!!! üò¢üò¢üî´üî´
I will never leave you
Everyone has to vent we support you!
Sorry mate I dont understand why and what....
I love you man, I appreciate you so much. I appreciate you being real with us. I will never judge you, keep doing you! Smile more!
You seriously are such a cunt
IM BACK!!! What I miss? ( I left when baby came) OH!!! There's a cat!!!!
so proud of you keep up the good work you are where you are because of your hard work love you sooooo much but please rest .
Yh my dad just went up to india for 4 months
It's all good roman! You are staying strong and handling that situation way better than I would've. Keep doing the amazing things you do and remember, through thick and thin, smile more :)
We love you and your family Roman üíû‚ù§Ô∏è
Do I know you?
We love you Roman and your fam you do your best and that's all that matters
Hey everyone go download Tempry from the App Store it's a new social media site üëç Follow me caraxxbibby
We understand roman love you
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Smile more buddy!
Chicago City!!!! WOAHHHHH!!
take ur time roman
Just listen to nf
I miss Zeus
Weee loveeee youuuu
Roman, if it makes you feel any better I think that if you don`t have traveling on your channel then it would always be the same. It`s nice to mix things up a bit and have different content. I know it might be difficult to leave your family but you gotta do what you gotta do. :) p.s if you are reading this (I doubt it) I love you so much and you are a huge inspiration to me!
Probably no one is going to see this but roman you are helping on family with these projects but how many families are you helping with on vlog thousand maybe more I mean what are you actually doing with this project us seeing you Dad without your family and us not seeing tour family so ask yourself why are you doing it for money for views what.
i feel you
}{{}
Stop manipulating your audience.
Roman: you wanna say somethin?\n\nFlash: (punches suitcase) Woof Woof!
i  love  Chicago   xoxooxoxox
Fuck off
sub to me
Your videos are still the same their your vlogs about your life don't let anyone change who you are keep your spirits up everyone's a human
Roman U R supported!
I feel the way u think man
Is this going to be your movie
Roman you have made me laugh and got me through tough time and I'm sure you did with thousands of other people. It's time for you to just relax and don't worry. Smile more
Worry not my friend. We all love you guys. It's good to have a vent vid every now and again, shows that no ones lives are perfect and everyone has their own stresses and challenges. What matters in the end is that you get through it and what you make of it.
I don't understand why everyone is hating on Roman. Give him a break. Alot of stress can really mess with you. Yeah people have bigger problems but it's hard. He doesn't want millions of people mad at him for not uploading like usual. Cut it out. I hope Roman understands that his real fans don't care about how long the vlogs are. I know I don't. Stay strong Roman ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Roman the main reason why your views are dropping is because school has started and we don't have the time that we did in the summer trust me you are doing a great job multitasking with the big project
Roman is my hero
It's ok Roman. I haven't notice anything bad until you said this. A lot of youtubers skip days all of the time and make little 5 minute videos, but wow, you post almost every day and make long 17-18, more or less, minute videos and it's crazy! Don't feel bad! Real Roman soldiers and great people will understand. It's not that big of a deal! You are awesome Roman! Thanks
Goo for it I'm there....!!!! üòÅ ü§£üòú
dude roman  speak it all out its not fair that you are down when you are the one make us positive and motivated  please let us have a chance to help you somehow when you do all these things for us
Realizing in this vlog that country is just as adventurous as Roman lmao . You guys are made for each other
Don't be embarrassed.  You should not be ashamed of anything. you are doing the best you can.   We are here to support at least the true fans are.
This dude makes me hate hats....he's completely shattered that backwards snapback look.
Like you say Roman, it can always be worse.
It's ironic how his motto is Smile More with all the positivity yet he's always the one complaining about something... man up and keep moving forward
Please you tube don't send me this stuff or anything from trending.so family life is trendy now?wtf.
I think I speak for most of your viewers when I say. You are human Roman! We will be here! Take care of yourself bro.
I heard he‚Äôs deleting his channel at the end of 2017 roman is this true?
We are here for you Roman
You are such an amazing person and your family is so precious in good times and not so good days we are here for youüëç
It is ok we are all here for you we love you and your family
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è your doing great, keep it up Roman
Roman, you are all about positivity in your vlogs!!!\nNo worries. Negative ppl leaving their negative comments are a bunch of wahhh wahhh wahhh!!! Keep it up. You have a beautiful family and you bring Smiles to many!
we all love you Roman x
Thank you for your videos your cool dude... Keep them coming
It's okay roman we understand where your coming from
What is wrong with all of you people in the comments!! Holy crap! Give the guy a break! You and your family are so inspiring roman, keep it up and ignore all these freaking immature kids!
I don't care Roman, I love you and your family! The true Roman Soldiers will stay with you no matter what! You can tell us anything, we'll listen!
Roman, you're my biggest inspiration and I love you!!!
Share everything. If this is really a daily vlog for you then share the good and the bad. That is what I do on my vlog. If ppl love you yhey have to love the whole package and having tough days goes with it. So please don't appologize for being who you are. WORK HARD DREAM BIG Roman. Greetings fron the Huber's Ranch in Switzerland
We are all human. Negative things happen to us all. We can't avoid them. Glad you opened up and shared this with us. Full support!
Sending Prayers for you, love you & your family!!! You can get through this, SMILE MORE. üíôüíúüíö‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ
You will be in my prayers! Also, I caught that pee corner Office reference! That makes me like you thaaaat much more! Keep your chin up!
We will always support you
I'm always going to be here on this channel no matter what Roman.
Wow people are super mean! I've been watching you with my kid I thank you for putting good videos online and not crap! Do you take time off and don't worry about people who hate, they just have nothing better to do the judge others online. Don't watch if you don't like it! I thank you for what you do and you and your family are beautiful!
No matter what, you are amazing and your true Roman soldiers are always here to support you.
Do what‚Äôs best for you, Roman. Focus on YOUR project and worry about the channel later
Right over all the same and it's not going to change anything God made us so we can relate to each other
Every human has problems Roman... So if you kept trying to hide them, we would think you weren't human.. Just kidding all jokes aside, just do what you love. Put your family and yourself first over life and you will find happiness more!
What's happening to Roman's views?
A slight increase in pressure and you are stressed, tired and whining to us. Do your job. Get dancing monkey!
Keep your head up Roman. I will always  watch you vlogs forever!!!
i will never leave roman
Roman, there is nothing wrong with venting. It's good for you, it makes you human and it makes your videos all the more real. Vent away bro, we're here for you.
Don't worry at all! We love your vlogs no matter what! üôÇüòÅ
What do you mean 'WE' need to talk, I don't need to talk to you, u just want views and Money!

Is she from Ireland or live in Ireland by any chance?
I love your vlogs and beauty videos Bubz! Your sense of humour is just <3
Oh my gosh Bubbi I love all your chat about mom life hehehehe!  You look sooo beautiful!
Bubz, please tell us what grey lenses you use here? It looks very natural. I love it
Good to have you back bubz! You look gorgeous with or without makeup :)
Bubz, I love you so much. But I miss this side of you! This is what made me follow you. Hope you and CHILDREN are doing well. üíï
Love the title... Testing the make up out and going to slay the grocery store :D:D:D Also, sooo good to watch another makeup tutorial from Bubz! awesome job!
Love the makeup looküòòüòòüòòüëçüëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
i love it when you talk about mommy duties\ni pickup so many good advices from you\nüíóüíóphilippines
You're still glowing and looking as beautiful as always bubz, I missed your makeup tutorials a lot so this was a welcome surprise!! ‚ù§Ô∏è I was wondering, do you have an updated skincare routine? Your skin always looks amazing!! \n\nAlso, I know you're extremely busy at the moment, but if you have any free time I'd deeply appreciate it if you maybe watched a video of mine? I've followed you since I was a young teen and I've only just found the courage to make a few videos myself. Again, I know you're busy and completely understand if you can't ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nKeeping you and your family in my prayers as always ‚ù§Ô∏è
I Loved the makeup Bubz. At first I was a little bit worried but it end up really cute! Love your family! :3
I love you and your videos so much, but I've become really disconnected with you recently since all you talk about is being a mum and babies, I can't relate to you anymore since I'm not interested in it and I don't have kids. I hope you don't take this as an insult because I still love you and I won't unsubscribe because you've helped me with so much, I'll definitely buy your book when it comes out! I know it must be hard to talk about anything else when you are a mum, but I would love to see videos like your old one, or like this but just talking about something else other than motherhood/children etc. Please don't take this too harshly, it's just something I'd personally like to see!! But do whatever you want to do, love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bubz your a yummy mummy! Would your do an updated hair care vid? Your hair is so healthy looking and with your busy life I was wondering if anything has changed in your routine xx
Book tour! San Diego is a beautiful place and you have so many subbies here! The air is much cleaner than L.A. and the city is much more accessible. Give it some thought Bubz, I'd recommend all the best eats LOL. Love you, this vid was so much fun and WELCOME BACK üòçüòçüëªüíï
this video made me realise how much I missed your videos on this channel, thank you <3 x
I can relate so much. üòÇüòÇ
You had me at grocery store :')
Come check out my Scottish Beauty channel! This weeks video is my high school make-up. üíìüíãüíÑhttps://youtu.be/i3qgrq7c_cg
Haha i also got the modern renaissance a few weeks ago and was like why did i wait this long?
Don't worry about being away. That's okay. Just glad to see you ^^
Bubz do you still selling brushes ? I want to get another brush set ‚ù§Ô∏è
You may want to look into a collagen supplement. It's supposed to be great for your skin! üòä
Everything I have felt with my second daughter! And boobing as you put it does do a number in the skin. Glad you are dolling up to go out! :) Some days you just need that extra zing to get you going even if it's for a few bananas and yogurt! :)
Bubz you wanna accentuate your eye shape so you should drag your eye shadow out a little. I think it'll really make a difference
What's your skincare routine after gave birth Mama Bubz ?
When will the book be available ? :D\nHugs
I remember you said you ran out of things to do for this channel. I suggest just do updates, q&a and reviews, those things never stop. You always need to have updated videos because things are always changing, you always have a new skincare routine, have new favorite products, etc. With the q&a People will always have questions. The reviews, there is always new products that needs to be reviewed & it would be very helpful and useful for people to see reviews before buying the product. Beauty isn't just outer appearance, I think you can include lifestyle type of videos too and just advices/girl talk videos. I think with makeup looks, there always music videos, movies and celebrities and It doesn't necessarily need to inspired you to emulate the look but it can be taken as a fun challenge too. There is many colors that can paired together and create new looks. There is also fashion, that is part of beauty too and there is always fun silly beauty related tags/games or beauty hacks you can incorporate in your channel.
Yay! A makeup video! I watch all your vlogs, but it's nice to see one of these, too. üíñüíñüíñ
It took me 8 weeks to recover down there, but I had a traumatic vaginal birth, would request a c-sec next time!
I hope you do a book tour in London please......
He thinks it's a two people activity Oh boy, the hemorrhoids DEAD üòÇ
omg lol my 18 month daughter rushes to the bathroom when she hears me too! its crazy haha
 where have I been?\n just pushed a child out of my vag\n\nTHIS IS WHY I LOVE YOU BUBZ
Most of the time, I look like an armpit MOST RELATABLE QUOTE :)
That background and the blue one with flowers have been my fave throughout this bubbi journey!
I don't mean to spam but I've been following Bubz for years now and I know you guys - her fans - are very kind so could you please share this link https://www.gofundme.com/jijis-medical-costs and just please remember every little bit counts - thank you so much
THE COMEBACK! Love it and missed seeing your tutorials! <3 <3
Everything you said, YES! Good to see you and glad you are well. My day has been brightened. :)
For a second I had to check the date of this upload because I was like, Bubz?! Oh I have missed your looks. You and Michelle basically taught me how to put on makeup. ^^ But even though this channel has been on a little hiatus, it's all good girl. We love yah, and family is important. Heck, the vlogs are my life, so it's awesome to still interact with ya. But so cool to see you back with a look!:) ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
I absolutely love the Modern Renaissance palatte!! <33 I am too scared to use Cypress Umber though because of how dark of a shade it is but you have inspired me to try using it in my next makeup look I do :D
It's so nice to see another makeup tutorial FINALLY!!! btw, when spongebob appeared. I lost it. No idea why I found it uncontrollably funny.
Hey bubz! You should start doing make up reviews! Would love to see from your point of views!
I love watching your beauty videos on vlogs. I always feel like I'm talking with a big sister.
It was so nice to see a new vid from you! It's ok to take a break from YT. Much love to you and your family ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä
She had another baby???? Omg it's been that long since I've watched
YAYAAY BUBZ!! So so nice seeing you again! I've been staying updated on your vlog channel hheeh‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüíñ
Omg I love your makeup videos!! I mean, i really really love and enjoy your vlogs but watching you doing your makeup is really fun. Btw, smoky eyes look so good on you!
I am new to YouTube and I would love some support - If you sub to me, I will sub to you - Thank you all so much ‚ô•
BUUUUUUBZ!!! I got so excited when I saw you had a new beauty video! It makes me wayyy too excited! Hahaha!
Bubz! How is your book going? Miss you!
Can you do a update skin care video or updated fashion wardrobe video?
Hey! Im pregnang with my first one now, been watching your vidoes for many years now and I enjoy you talking about stuff like this even throughout beauty videos. Be strong, and stay glowing ‚ô• love you! All the best to yout beautiful family!!‚ô•
Is there anyone actually subscribed to this channel that doesn't watch Bubs vlogs? XD
love you bubz !! been such a pleasure watching you grow for about 8 years !! can't wait to purchase your book.  will it be available in australia ??
Please do more tutorials on this ABH palette bubzüò≠
I am really looking forward to your book!!
I watch your vlogs all the time so I forget about this channel lol
Hey Bubz, when is your book coming out? I can't wait to get my hands on it!
It can be strange on the surface, but i think it's a lot safer to have a baby or a toddler with you when you're in the bathroom since they're prone to accidents.
Yes mama bubz ! I always get dolled up  for shopping
always good to hear you talk about your life update, even though i keep up with your vlog channel ;)
At 9:50 you look like a cute little red panda :D Love your vlogs <3 Watching them immediately when I see the post on facebook ^^
Hi~ can anyone recommend any good hair products to strengthen hair? thanks :D
That beautiful post partum glow <3 You're always beautiful. Thanks for the GRWM :)
Hey Bubz) nothing's wrong with getting all dolled up to the grocery store! As a russian woman I say that we're getting dolled up even if we only getting trash can out and getting back home. Even my hubby is the same, today he was getting trash out and put on literally his best shoes, because, ya know, a lot of people could be watching, you want to look your best) Take care, dear.
How do you know whether to apply blush to apples of cheeks of just below, like you have done here? :)
Most of the time I look like an armpit omg xD I'm glad I wasn't drinking anything, cause I would've spit it up LOL
Thank the Lord bubz is back!!!!!
Welcome back Bubz! You are missed! A LOOOOT!!
Hey bubs I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude but I learned that if you apply blush lower than your nose, it will drag the face down. I figured since you wanted to give the illusion of a slimmer jawline, maybe you can try this and see if it works for you? :)
Bubz, I saw your üçí cherry üçí style makeup recently on your story and I really like it!! Can you make a tutorial on it?? üíõ I love you and your fam so much!
Omg feels so good to see u doing makeup again I luv ur all family videos u don't know I been following u since u started YouTube channel u introduce me what is makeup n m a makeup artist n doing well thanks bubzz n good luck üòâ

The 2012 Mac mini is the best one and I have it :)
and yet its still more powerful than my pc :(
Austin why the fuck do you think it still exists.
Looks like a wi-fi box
please stop talking like that
Hai
Hey Austin, this is Vsauce
Im using a mac mini.......
I got a Mac mini last year (Core i5 8Gb Ram).. Really good for iOS app development. I have a Windows laptop for entertainment
Can we retire the this is austin intro already?
File pale before convinced handle feed billion revenue love.
love your new outro austin! good work!
Does he have to talk like that? Super annoying.
I remember when I had one...
Why would you want a Mac mini in the first place?
We use one of these in our office. We are software devs and we use it to build and debug the iOS version of our crossplatform app. We don't need sheer speed for that, only that it runs OSX and will finish compiling C++ at some point (never normally more than 30 mins)
So why does an out dated pc cost 500?
Mac mini‚Äôs are apples line of servers. That‚Äôs why they still exist since apple discontinued Xserve in 2013.
We got a top of the range Mac mini and it's THE WORST!!!
Why does life exist in 2017?
Why does the Middle East exist?
My 2012 Mac mini is still smooth even when editing 4K video. It is actually faster than my custom PC with a quad-core i7 and a GTX 1080 (proof on my channel).¬†\n\nI think Apple should refresh the Mac mini with internals of the new 2017 MacBook Pros + some Thunderbolt 3 ports. That would make it really popular for prosumers and amateur content creators looking to try out macOS. Groups of potential customers Apple seems to be ignoring.
Lol I'm watching this video on a Mac mini
How come he sounds like runs out of battery after every sentence
Why does Austin exist in 2017?
Did anyone else see logic in the back
Stop Dancing in the Videos man !!!!
Which keyboard is Austin using with the Mac mini?
Your voice is so FUCKING annoying!
HEY EVERYONE, PLEASE I NEED YOUR HELP!\n Basically, i was told by my family that i would get a new 8 core processor if i got 100 subs. So please, if you can, subscribe. Everyone helps alot. Thanks! <3\n\n(i know i posted this on another Austin video, but i really need that component ;-;)
They make sleek looking HTPCs, I use the base i3 model for that but it can chug with anything more than Plex running. Which means going for the i5 8GB RAM + version by which point I would say save money and get something else.
I still use a 2014
I still use these in my photo shop class at school.
Watching this on my 2009 Mac Mini lol
slap in 16gb of ram and a SSD usb3 drive ... works fine (late 2012 model)
Why does Austin Evans exist on 2017?
But... who is going to catch me in the next one now? :|
The $500 Mac Mini comes with a 1.4 Ghz Dual Core i5. The 2.6 Ghz i5 you listed is for the $700 model.
Why does this channel still exist in 2017?
Short answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCause apple is brain dead
Lol you can upgrade ram wtf is this fag on about?????
$500, gosh I only paid $79.99 for my 2014 iMac
I would get one if it‚Äôs specs were upgraded.
A Mac Mini?\nMust be a tiny burger from McDonalds then.
Its a marketing strategy, if they pull the product from the market, investors will say its a failure, so they just ignore it and never update it.
Bro i have a mac mini soo....‚úå
Why aren't they using  an m2 drive  insdie Laptops?
Hey Austin if you make A dsi Worth it video I'll sub and share this video to my friends
There's this thing called eBay, it's a magical website that you can find used stuff on like shitty macs. Don't spend $500 on a brand new turd, just buy a pre-owned one. Or just don't buy a turd at all.
Y does the fitbit exist in 2017?? There are a lot more smart bands which are more accurate and wayy cheaper
Apple sucks big time, they removed the easy memory upgrade options, and stopped release updated hardware versions. They stopped selling the 16gb versions in some countries. Probably, Apple wants to kill most affordable Mac, they have!!
Why does he sound like a higher pitched version of Troy McLure from the Simpsons. He emphasised that start of all his words and then falls off on the end. Should be doing tele shopping channels or something
Can you people get me to 100 subscribers
I still use Mac mini today. It is slow but I don't play fast games and I only need it to rec ROBLOX which isn't that heavy! I never lag and I always use the 2005 version. This tells us a lot about how good steve jobs was.
I actually really doubt it's for consumers. It's probably largely still made specifically for developers. We use a dozen mac minis as Jenkins boxes at my job.
Guys voice is so annoying...in the box. Thouuuuu,   In the boooooxxx,   Why does he drop his voice at the end of almost every sentence
i want to see austin evans shirtless
I had to get the $699 Mac mini because I could not afford an iMac or MacBook
where you keep this reviewed items so many omgüòá
Some of these shiny millennial channels are unwatchable because of the stupid fast, high pitched voice they put on. He's like a fucking robot that's been programmed to annoy. Sounds like 'What's up guys' la la la la la...
The mini is currently the best (legal) way to host OS X in a datacenter. There are even special rack trays for them.   The Xserve is dead and gone.
Why does Austin Evans exist in 2017?
They exist to be used as a server that's small and low factor enough to be on 24/7 running Mac os server since they got rid of the XServe.
I don't know what's worse. The Mac Mini or your front teeth.
You enunciate at all the wrong times in your sentences. Where were you raised?
Hey guys, this is Austin.
As a fan of you and Vsauce,that ending was super cute <3.
And yet a 3 yr old mac is still infinitely better than most pc trash coming out this year.
His shirt matches the HP Pavilion Wave.
Wow, you don't even get a mouse and keyboard.
I bought 30 of them this summer to mount behind large interactive touch panels. I had to beef up the RAM and order them with SSDs just to make up for the extremely dated internals. I have always loved and used the Minis in different types of structured installs, but they are getting to be harder and harder to recommend. There really isn't any excuse for this either. It would probably take Apple engineers less than a month to sort out even just a Skylake compatible board/chipset and toss a few thunderbolt 3 lanes in there for modern connectivity.¬†\n\nAs it is right now, I can only really use these at 1080p or I see terrible overall system performance. They will push 4k resolutions, but they STRUGGLE. C'mon, Apple!
why does austin evans still exist in 2017?
Cool! I want one!!
Hey Austin I'm a huge fan of yours. I love watching your videos to learn new things. I am very interested in learning about computer software and technology. So your videos are amazing. I'm a junior I'm high school and I am very interested in tech but don't have much money for stuff. Do you have any suggestions?
I highly doubt the iPhone X will even lick the 8,700 mark for multicore. I know they are rumors but come on...
I skipped the latest Mac Mini for the 2012 Mini (since it's easily upgradable). I quadrupled the memory and loaded dual SSDs, it still kicks ass years later. Intel graphics but I don't play games anyway, so I couldn't be happier with this system.
i have mac mini and upgraded to 8 gb (2x4gb ram). I watch all steaming . as for hard drive, i backup to  external disk .  had it over 4 years, no issues and no stupid kb monthly rollups from microsoft
Lmao if you never had one, then you won't ever know
Because it's easier to put a Mini where the sun does not shine, than a iMac.
Stop editing out your breaths its extremely off putting not to mention unnecessary
Dear every tech reviewer ever, stop comparing Geekbench results between different architectures (ARM/x86), they aren‚Äôt comparable.  At least in the way you are interpreting them.
Eww a mac
Omfg the 'fewer ports ' joke ...why dude so cringe
Logic albums
Cool vid
is he autistic
How did this get onto trending?
Cherdleys in real life
funny in url
It's trash
Because apple fanbois are retarded
vsauce <3
Curiosity box looks legit
Austin Is Awesome
Better yet -\n\n*why does Apple exist*
Austin looks like logic
I didnt know this existed
Thank you for sharing
Why don't you petition for a better one. Rather than moan it's shit! What a waste of time
Why does Apple still exist in 2017?
Who would you cast as adult versions of the Losers' Club in the inevitable It sequel? We're going to have to go with Amy Adams as Beverly.
How your face should really look
I see Mike Hanlon doing a Mohammed Ali movie when he grows up. He looks just like Ali. Remember this!
If life is strange becomes a movie they should put that girl in it as CHLOE
i think they should make another one in 27 years, the same cast, and since they made that pack that they would come back if Pennywise did, they should fight IT again but fully win this time.
The difference between Bill and Tim as Pennywise is all in their mannerisms.\n\nListen to the way they speak to the kids.\n\nTim's Pennywise is already a supernatural being, that's mastered being a human already. He acts, talks, thinks and looks very human. He doesn't have an eerie voice or design; and he acts actually impressed and concerned over Georgie telling I'm not supposed to take stuff from strangers! My Dad said so! And Tim has that very approving look when he says Very wise, Georgie. Very wise indeed!\n\nBill on the other hand is a supernatural creature that's trying to be human, but fails. His voice, appearance, manner of speaking and actual body stances are very inhumane. Pennywise in this version of something that's trying to be human, but fails miserably. Once again; when Gerogie starts laughing with him in the drain scene, Bill just stops and looks genuinely annoyed. He doesn't understand that getting a kid to laugh is an easier way to earn their trust. \n\nThe scares and attacks are vastly different too.\n\nTim very rarely tried to kill the kids. And often times he'd just stand around, talking about his floating balloons and laugh at them.\n\nBill however constantly made efforts to kill the kids. Even after Beverly claimed she wasn't afraid, Pennywise then proved her wrong and opened up his deadlights.\n\nBoth are too very different incarnations of the same character, but both are equally as brilliant as one another. Which scares you more? The humane one, or in the inhumane one?\n\nSomething that can lure you in by being a master of pretending; or something that lures you in with nothing but pure fear?
the actress who plays Beth and the actor of Pennywise could be brother and sister.
Jeremy's barely even husky
I think they nailed Pennywise. He looks terrifying and I like that they changed up the outfit, it shows he's been doing this for a long time. Can't wait to see it.
Am I the only one that thought Partick looked like Kylo Ren?
Sofia Lillis looks similar to Bill Skarsgard
horrible remake
Newcumber
I think what I find so terrifying about the 2017 Penywise is because of IT's human-like features. There's reality for ya.
If you like this comment you'll float tooüéà
Why @looper WHY are you not using my favourite background music more often?
Wyatt and Chosen are taller than Jaeden
When I first saw Eddie, i thought hes Richie, even though he didnt have glasses...\nBecause the way he talked, he seemed more of a Richie than Richie
Bill Hader as adult Richie Tozier
HEY.   You forgot georgie
Jack is so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
RICHIE TOADJER no...
üéàüéàüéàüéàüéàüéàüéà
The new movie is pretty good,...still love the original best tho
Shane dowson as Ben
Make one for The Dark Tower. ;)
New-cumber. This guy...
You'll float too
Title has me like Caste of what exactly'?
Why would a good looking girl be apart of a group called the loser club
a GAY clown would feed itself quite well in every smaller US TOWN I guess
A bully in marvels ant man ?
The pinned comment at the top is proof of the validity of this video and this channel....that would be none.
No
Did you guys remember the train scene man that was good shit....
Who's seen this ???
it's book accurate...stop comparing it to the mini series.
Looper stop click baiting, for fuck's sake.
dc by Eagles played out late now\n\nPla
Can I just say\n\nGOD I LOVE THE ENTIRE CAST SO MUCH
It was a really really good movie
THE MANSION IS FROM AMERICAN HORROR STORYüòÆüòÆüòÆ
me encanto
red bull clownathon@
Nfk
Scuffed j's
I saw the movie today... and i cant sleep from watching it... so i go to youtube and scroll through trending...my heart skipped a beat.
YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE MOM!? THEY'RE GAZEBOS!!!!
Sophia is somehow 5'0, she looked taller but ig that's editing for you
I get the point of the vid, but the acting is 100x more important than how they look.
bill does have red hair well in certain lights it comes through so probably more of an auburn
Bill skarsgard is hot
Did this guy just say nemesises...?
40 on trending
Me: Nicholas Hamilton! Cool name...\n\nMe: Wait- ALEXANDER HAMILTON
Bill (It) did perfect! The smile is perfectly nerve-racking. I just saw the movie and was terrified. I'm still fucking shaking, I haven't been scared of a horror movie since Silent Hill. Of course most horror movies have good plots, but are never perceived well and are less fearsome.
In the book Pennywise has an electric blue tie. How could you mess that up?
I was hoping for the half eaten bodies wrapped up in spider web more than anything else in this movie...ah well. Too much CGI for the scary parts, but the cast was fantastic.
this video rocks!! love all this IT stuff. I finished the book just two weeks ago and I can't let go, I'm obsessed!
I much prefer that Pennywise look like an actual circus performer  clown instead of a birthday hobo clown.
lol I go to school with jack grazer
I cant wait till this movie comes out on dvd, gonna poop my pants when it comes out
I saw the movie and the fact that it was way scarier then 1990...remember pennywise only comes out every 27 years,and the first time it was 1990,27 years later was 2017 lets wait 27 years for the next it...
Masters of Sex?
Who else just skipped to pennywise?
I want nothing to do with King or anything he is involved in.
I hate this clown appearance I would like to see the orginal makeup
I would like to see IT face of against a kid with actual psychopathy. A child with no empathic functions or the ability to sense fear (as we know it). \n\nWould IT just kill him and be done with it or try to use him? Perhaps IT would see it as interesting as well.
The casting was perfect
I hate colons
In my opinion these kids nailed this movieüôåüèæ
. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's in my second fanny pack
The clown was too good looking because it's Bill
fuck that, i'd rather watch the original.
I LOVED the new IT movie!!
Tozier not Tojer.
This is not the type of clown you would like to see at the carnival anytime soon. I died laughing at that, intentional or not it was funny. (In the book, at the carnival some bullies get angry at a gay couple, which leads to them throwing one of them over the bridge, in which IT takes him and drags him under.)
they did good but the guy with the stutter is way taller than the rest of them and it looked like he was two-three years older than them.
Stan Uris was totally worthless in the movie
*OOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG, can't people every be happy with what they got/get?*
Of the Loser's Club members, you listed the Black kid and the Jewish kid last...was that intentional or merely unconscious?
I think they all look ok
The cast looks just fine to me. I loved the adaptation and so did Stephen King. So changing or wishing changes is pointless.
The movie was a pile of shite
I was expecting for drawings
Patrick looks like Rodrick
i love clowns, I love grapes
Dane Dehaan as older Bill
This I by far my favorite movie if you haven't seen it yet go watch it NOW!!!!!ü§°
Next video idea: *How IT should really be spelt*
Know
Jack Douglass\nShould be Pennywise
Sk√•rsgard needed hella lot more lines
*Beverly was THICC*
üéàüéàüéàüéà\n   üéàüéàüéà\n      üéàüéà\n          üéà\n           ü§°

I Like The Bill Skarsgard Pennywise The Best Also There's Awesome Music While There's A Horror Movie Going On
Buyer hunter violence kcmsmm need crop office musical.
I'm gau
I'm not even American, but this is one of the most beautiful things i've ever seen... Brothers in America, don't be afraid or ashamed to use you national symbols because they were co-opted and used for nefarious anti-white causes by our enemy in the past. That is how (((they))) have been operating for longer than you can imagine, no symbol that you can come up with will stop them from using it. \nDon't fall for their bullshit any longer! Use the field against them instead, retake the symbols taken from you, those that anyone can stand by, and show people what they originally meant. Let the enemy be the ones coming up with their own symbols, so everyone can see them for what they really are... Filthy anti-white parasites!
Dude I'm in tears and I never even stood a step in the USA!
This is literally the best thing on youtube
More goodies for me, more shekels for Murdoch Murdoch, couldn't be happier !
I wish it would happen like that, that all Antifa really needed was a National Pride song to wake them from their self destructive thrashing but alas. There will be a Brother war, and it will be Left vs Right.
Why does Murdoch sound like a nigger ?
A master piece of art.
jared with his paint bucket,that was awesome.
Even if rthedonald is a little bit retarded he is still our brother
Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I saw George Lincoln Rockwell as one of the ghosts of America.  He was a National Socialist.  National Socialists were the first to openly confront/oppose international Jewry.  We are on your side after all.  Just saying.
Thousands of whites from the south died to keep wealth white landowner's black. Keep in mind that the opposition to slavery was because northerners didn't want blacks in the north.  The reason Bleeding Kansas happened was because people in Kansas didn't want blacks in Kanasas. Not defending the aggression on the South, but there was no reason for the south to defend keeping blacks. No more wars for the rich who want to displace us.
We are not machine Men with machine hearts, we are Men, march forth to the song of liberty while we can still fight for it
Northerners just don't understand.\n\nIt's ok, we still love you.
all the cartoon people have funny asian kind of eyes.  Is the animators China?  They look too creepy to watch.  Shame, the rest was good.
good now i can shoah muhmurigans collectively ... fucking jewish cesspool is all the same to me
Hey white man who is that squeaky toy guy fighting for the north?
Hello MM2TR for big orders of supplies can you get a discount because we need abetter way to make merchandise with out so much money needed. If I buy 4 of each can you give me 25 blue/rays and DVD, and  all your video content to date and it will get you message around faster? Most people don't go on YouTube and when they do they only see useless shit. When people have the Back up of your youtube videos they will be happy and not have to pay to watch your shit already. Costs a arm in leg for me to use any data.
Every time the ending gets me. Idk how you do it.
I just want to thank you for waking me up to National Socialism. I was shaking my head at you at first, but I started to understand.
It was Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh.... and Andrew Jackson... the Wright brothers.... The Commander....I've caught some feels.... Hail victory!
Superman is a Jew, he's not better than just man who is a Gentile.
R I G H T  \nW I N G \nA L L I A N C E\n\nBoth the North and South were anarcho-fascist by today's standards.
AWESOME BRO!!! Here from INFOWARS
I love the use of Appalachian Spring toward the middle of the video, Aaron Copland's compositions were phenomenal and distinctly American. Even if he was a Jew.
Get a website so I can donate
I am a FUCKING LEAF but damn if I didn't get goosebumps at that ending.  God bless America.
I love that Fucking based! has become Murdoch-chan's catchphrase.
Who were all the Ghosts? I knew a good amount, but not all.
Murdoch is a Midwestern Chad confirmed
Going to get Shoah'd in 3,2,1...
I'm in the military and I choke up every time I hear the anthem. Also glad to see Rockwell and Pierce in there.
damn, i'm no murican but this made me cry
Does anyone else get incredibly motivated by what Murdoch says at 3:35?
I need to know the recording of The Star-Spangled Banner you used that followed after R/The_Donald's. Wow that was beautiful, I used to hate the national anthem as a child; presumably, because I only ever heard it sung by forlorn drugged out popstars, and not by united patriots.
holy hell Murdoch was that you singing?
Beware of the echo people they are another race white skin isn't a free win when your anti-white..
The symbolism behind these videos just effing brilliant.
Great ending with the jew soros getting impaled!
Absolute Waifu Pillow guaranteed to make you fail your gay little no fap, or your money back.
Has no one noticed they used the Merchant Minute bumper for their news segment???

Fantastic. Now I'm crying over a cartoon at work.\n\nBless you all.
This is beautiful. Is it gay if my eyes watered at the Anthem?
I want my America back :(
Nice one, really digging the minimalist approach you guys use. Kinda the opposite to my style, but it works!
This is making me so sad and im not even american.
Can somebody please tell me the version of the American anthem at the end of the video?
i dont know who writes these scripts for you or you write them all on your own but they are top notch! keep the good work!
The fact that all of us faggots are crying is the proof that there's still hope
damn right in the feels
Wew, lads. Shed a tear at the end. I'm not even American. Yeah, we're going to be needing more of this. A lot more.
hello I swa this on trending and and it is hateful please delete alhamdulillah
I feel bad. Somehow my shitty window movie video got more views then this video.
how dare present before our eyes a confederate flag, this must be one of those white people racist sites
Dude when I heard Copeland's Appalachian Spring, wow. Such a perfect choice.
This was a great episode, you guys keep it up!

#38 on Trending!
I saw one of the guys wearing a murdoch murdoch shirt in a picture of the unite the right torch rally. how does it feel to be the laughing stock of the fucking country?
No, no. This terrifyingly good for such an amateur group. In fact I am hard pressed to believe it. They must have professionals working with them. The writing is top notch, and they are genuinely fucking funny. In fact it reminds me of the humor of the 90s. This shit is incredibly dangerous to the left. I am the first person to point out bullshit when somebody tries to do edgy comedy. I fucking hate it. It is a travesty that the left lost their humor, as they used to hold a monopoly on it and were damn fuckng good at it. \n\nThis is incredibly dangerous to the left. They somehow made white identity sympathetic, funny, and you can relate to it. I do not know how they fucking did it. I am actually flabbergasted.
This video is trending? Holy shiiiiiiit
#45 on Trending! Ha :)
Nie wieder Bruderkrieg.
OH SHIT WE TRENDING BOIS
Holy shit, it's trending
Trending in the UK, YESSS LADDSSSS
#39 Trending in the UK Murdoch. Keep it up, pal!\n\nSome of us Brits want in on this unity. An Anglo gathering for us brothers!
Anyone know the performers who sang the national anthem at the end was? I really want to know
there is no difference between nazis and communists? \n\nnazis: kill all muslims and jews and  create the most advanced country on earth. invent V2 rocket and go to space. \n\ncommunists: support muslims because muslims make good communists. idiot muslims depend on their country to give them welfare so country can enslave the muslims. communists support muslims to take over western civilization.
For all the black people The south  Will take down it's confederate flags and Confederate statues  on one condition if you pull up your goddamn pants no one wants to see your crusty black asses
someone should do a compilation of Louis saying Aiight i got a cheeky little coffee :D
John O'Groats
It's funny cause Matt and jp are just like the bosses and Louis is like there little servant

Nice video man
That freaking castle!
i enjoyed this
he needs to stop saying little plane
CHEEKY LITTLE COFFEE COUNT: 10234091230491234123412346725367682352231
This made scotland seem like the north pole
Louis! What's the type/model of this plane? You've said before but I can't find it now.
I love this world series, so inspiring, I even started my own channel after seeing this, but I made it my own. I do vlogs about events in London, and all that.
I am really enjoying the videos. & the three of you are getting on so well and todays video. WOW that drone filming of the castle in Scotland. Right on the edge of the sea.& all the farmland and livestock.¬†Amazing
Someone should make a video of all of the times Louis said just grabbed a cheeky little coffee
Hi I have best deal for people who loves to travel around the world at the same time to earn some money with it. Email me at parth_upadhyaya@yahoo.com to know further.
I live in Scotland and Wick is my grandparents local airport (they can only really get to Edinburgh from there)
great to see you loving Scotland/Caithness!
Am I the only one who thinks after the world tour he should visit every state in the plane, or every European country or Asian country
The Scotland castle actually made me cry, what a beautiful place!
Yay another pleb visiting the UK lol. Ah at least they aren't helping fund a dictatorship on this visit lol.
Whats will all the static popping noises?  Heard it on two difference devices.
Woop woop! My home town of Wick!
Love you bro! I want to show you around Sydney Australia !!! Even better, fly into a small coastal airport in NSW called Albion Park and leave the rest to me!! Peace out BOOM!
Have JP review theses video's. You guys are in baller heaven.... or is still on a bicycle in Idaho. https://m.youtube.com/user/streetattractionuk
I got excited as the arrow in the thumbnail pointed to where I live and I was like WoAh you live in Caithness\n\nAnd then he said england.\n\nLies\n\nOnly lies
both planes are awesome in their own ways but if you were in his Bonanza JP and he would be rubbing shoulders anda cpl hundred pounds of useful load would be left home for maybe 3 to 5 knots advantage\n\na Bonanza is lighter on the controls but having owned both types i'll take a Centurion any day in weather and IMC conditions..much more stable
Scotland reminded me of game of thrones scenes
Louis has such a peaceful attitude. Even when they dog on his plane and say little side comments about changing GoPro batteries. If this is the personality of pilots no thanks.
If would love to do this. But you need lots of money to do it.
What part of Scotland is his mum from??
Funforlouis where abouts on Scotland are your mum side from??
will there ever be a place where louis can get just a cup of coffee? wherever he goes the little cheeky one seems to follow
This is by far my favourite set of vlogs on this channel so far. Pure authentic adventurous content. Keep up this kind of stuff up, don't work yourself too hard and thank you infecting the world with positivity
Great stuff, love that castle!
Their staying at the Norseman hotel because I go there a lot it is kinda expensive but not to expensive it's called the Norseman Hotel in wick
Is he going to Scotland??
Like if you're from Scotland
Yo i love your vids. Avid follower. Im from London but living in jakarta for a couple of years. Any plans to stop over in indonesia?
You should have landed on the Faroe Islands - so picturesque there
loving these vlogs so much! Dont worry that theyre not up to date!! It is not a problem :) :)
6:19 Guy on the right looks like scout from tf2
Love the beats in this episode!
I'll take some cashews. I like cashews. and then you wip out a banana.  :-)
Sightseeing is just a BIT better in a 210 (high wing, no struts) than a Bonanza, Matt!  (But Bonanzas do fly better :) lol)
Everything about this video is top notch, Great Job!
OMG THE TREE HOUSE SUPER COOL! =)
Simply put this series is legendary.
Thanks for promoting our beautiful country. You are welcome home anytime.
Nice to see the guys smiling in unison! \nGood vibes!\nShout out to the pilot/s ‚ô°‚òÜ‚ô°
Why did you leave Scotland in the first? *draws Tesco discount shank from north face puffer jacket*
Just wondering when is Louis' coffee not cheeky and little ahahah ;P
freaking out that my little home country is in your video Louis! you should come and visit the Faroe Islands. It's a very special place with unique nature :)
The music remind me of samurai champloo lol
I ONLY FOUND OUT IT IS IN 4K NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please do a tour of Scotland and come to Fife üòç I didn't realise you were half Scottish. We love you üòÅ
Yoooo most my dads family lives in wick and Thurso I knew I recognised that castle üòÑ
Louis...you don't come to Scotland enough
Haha, here on my up next video queue there's a video from CBS about Matt's flying around the world.
Pretty cool to see that castle and can't wait to see the abandoned one!
Experience is by far better then 2D sofa riding
OMG!!!  That Castle!!!!   Amazing!!!!  Love these videos!!!!
this is so inspirational - i would love to travel the world some day‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Awesome video. Seems like the drone camera is a bit wonky though, horizon is off in all of the clips
Welcome to Caithness. My home countyüòäüòäüòäüëåüëå
Great Vlog bro. Loved that castle.  Don't stress yourself over getting the vlogs online all the time. We're all human and travelling round the world can't be easy - make sure you sleep and get enough rest. We can wait - your health is more important Sir.
I just came across your vlog by accident and you landed in my home town! So cool! A little bit homesick now though üòÇ your whole trip looks so awesome, gonna have to go back and watch the rest üòÄ
why did the route change from islamabad to mumbai?
On my word!!! I agree with Louis that tree house is is awesome! I have never seen anything like that with the trees coming out of the roof. It definitely looks like something out of Lord of the Rings or something. Someday I want to go to Scotland too because I am Scottish as well.
What plane are you flying
Love it! I just started my own vlog, I'd love for you to check it out. Keep up the amazing work!
what are the fuel prices for planes like this ?
I live in wick.
https://youtu.be/Eupd8Nu1h3o pretty cool from cbs interview with Matt when he flew around the world.
Wow amazing inspiring video. Keep sharing. Love and support!
I want to know whether or not the coffee I'm drinking is a cheeky little coffee or not. I don't know how to tell the difference.
Fun fact, Matt ended his around the world trip at High Performance Aircraft at Gillespie Field in El Cajon (San Diego), California. I work one hangar away from that and watched him during his press interview when he landed.
Great music for that epic drone shot!
Gosh, this is amazing!
Oh hey it's the North Korea dude
wow this is very delayed. Alfie made his vid when you arrived 2 weeks ago. You must be in spain or something idk! xd loving the vlogs
Was waiting to see the people from a couple days after Matt joined were like he's a jerk, now they're like Matt's such a good addition smh hypocrites
why didn't you interview @DaveErasmus for your upcoming Aftermovie ? ü§î
No mention of the poor guy who fed you coffee and snacks through the nights, thats gratitude for you ;)
Food for louie
Omg I remember watching Louis' vlogs a long time ago like years and got reminded of his channel just now and couldn't remember his name so I searched vlogger with incredible dreadlocks and Vlogger who hurt himself on a skateboard cuz I remembered that video where he fell and hurt himself bad I'm so happy that I found his channel again and I will make sure to subscribe :D
Omg my ex is in this video at 12:45 what a coincidence
Those suits are cool and so smart your being safe.
Can we all acknowledge how extremely unfit Louis is. Like he is out of for 85% of this video and thats from walking from the plane to the car. Kind of worrying.
hello all, come and check us out
Can everyone subscribed to me please I do gaming videos
Louis spends half the flights asleep, what's the point of flying round the world if you just sleep through it!!
Three white males, this triggers me so much. And the way Louis says guys rather than gender neutral people.
I'm FROM SCOTLAND üòÅ

gg samwell tarly
This is UK trying to leave the EU in Brexit
I fucking missed you Crystal Maze. I fucking missed you \n\nNo show in history could make an entire nation wet themselves laughing at a tool being unable to move off a planet. This sent me over the edge laughing in pain while my Dad went absolutely mental at him being unable to do this \n\nThat wasnt even the best part. In the Aztec zone, the thick cunt kept the helmet on, then fell on the fucking stairs. I needed CPR by the time this was over. \n\nNot one element of this show has been changed. And yes, only Richard's can host this show lol
That‚Äôs the funniest thing I‚Äôve seen on tv in ages! The buildup to that last ditch desperate attempt to leave the red planet was brilliant! ü§£
So agile it's astounding!
0:40 Even at this early stage, Jacob Rees Mogg knows his team mate is doomed.
Almost pissed myself laughing, funniest thing I've seen all year. This deserves millions of views.
Can someone put Daft Punks Around The World on this clip please...!
The thing is he looks genuinely terrified üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ funniest thing I've seen in years
One of the funniest things I've seen in my life.
physical master on a gameshow where you need a little bit of skill
This episode has me in tears of laughter! This guy was so funny! Hilarious he fell again at the next zone too üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The epic fail was hilarious, as was him continuing to wear the helmet for the rest of the show. Him falling over in the next zone made me cry tears of laughter.\n\nWhat a legend! (not to forget of course his cell joke as the team left the futuristic zone, complete with a cheeky wink)!!
that was painful to watch.\ndon't let him have children ffs.
What is this garbage? Where's Richard O'Brien?
I thought the part when he tripped over the stairs was hilarious tooüòÇ
Doesn't help the fact that he's carrying the weight of three people
I searched Crystal Maze furry and this was the first result. YouTube knew exactly what I wanted.
What others think as Rob falls \nAw no\n\n\nWhat I think of when Rob falls \n\n\n\n\n*SHOOTING STARS* music
He's going round the rings ha ha lol
funny clip, but the revival of this show is an absolute joke.
Not exactly built for physical activities the tubby little virgins lol so funny and fell arse over head in the aztec zone just walking up a step lol gravity is a bitch!
I laughed when I first saw this and I'm laughing again now üòÇ
heavy panting on the first planet? this was never going to end well.....but comedy gold
Oh god please don't use interlaced video.
Me and the wife watched it and cried.
I pissed myself when he was on, didnt laugh justed pissed myself.
Omfg he is actually absolutely fucking useless piece of shite
an A+ athlete, a true inspiration.
Aw these are the loser squad the cosplayers
This chubby fellow will forever be haunted by this experience. He shall pass the local chippie and go straight to the gym.
I knew this would trend when I watched it on tv. Poor lad, but it's just physics in action, his own weight moved the thing he was standing on out of reach of everything he tried to step towards. Not a good game for people who like a pie or three, I fear!
And that children is the reason why you exercise.
Why is he out of breath?
As soon as there was hint from the team that he should turn back, he was like - 'fuck this I'm heading back' üòÇ
Check the nick of that fat desperate cunt
Change speed to 1.5 and you may just cack your pants.
This is why aliens refuse to visit us.
Joey Essex managed to do this.
Gotta go down as tv gold.couldnt stop laughing the other day when we watched it.
In a way I don't really expect much from someone who dresses up as a furry!! x'D And he was doing some weird pedo panting in there too on those planets.
One of the worst things I've ever watched! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ poor fella
Ground control to major Tom?
I was wacthing this last night and laughed so much I woke my family up
Some say this is lost NASA footage
That would've annoyed me being his team mate..I'm frustrated easily and his heavy breathing and failure at something so simple would've infuriated me..I'm a bad team player when it comes to having weak people in my team.
I know this man, he works in the same place as me. aww bless him.
the team were fun but...and i'm sorry if you reading this team..they were not the best physically built for the job...not very athletic for the physical challenges..the best Member being Martin IMO\n\nthey were there to have fun though i'll give them that and the beard dilemma was daft yet noticeable...if they ended with 5 seconds they could have been the new  team of..rubbish but loveable\n\nstarted strong and then...ohhhhhhh dear
Hes a dragon right so why doesn't he just fly over?
I keep thinking this is nick crompton
I feel like he was this bad on purpose, to leave a legacy on the show he likes so much.
This moment is going to be on best tv moments next year. This episode was hysterical
When did this show start again and Richard as the host brilliant.
That fat fuck s a retard... he doesn't know how to control his own damn body
This is what happens when you don't keep fit.
10 seconds in and it sounds like he ran a marathon. Wrong guy for the job
Wheres the mad bald gay bloke in the tiger jacket?
Don't make me shave your captain  ~ the human race 2017
I feel sorry for the guy because there is no way he's running away from this
Thank you Rob for the laugh, you really are a donut going round and round
Let us not forget that when they were running into the next zone, the same contestant you see here fell face-first into the ground.
Fact: they really do lock them into the rooms on the crystal maze and since being shut into the planet room Rob has had to become a pole dancer and put his new found skills to good use in order to generate some income for himself.
I was laughing like fuck when i saw this on Friday
Just watched it again, and it's still hilarious, just noticed his laboured breathing throughout the ordeal, the ludicrous advice from his team ( do the thing) and the girl snorting with laughter towards the end. Pure class. Afterwards he was trying surreptitiously to get his gloves off and couldn't even manage that !! Please put the whole thing up !!
My parents said it would go viral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were right
That's what happens when *real panic* sets in - you end up going round in circles!!!\nLucky the game wasn't a 'timeless' one.  Rob would still be spinning...
I am REALLY Hoping this Episode & this Moment is Highlighted on This Week's Gogglebox...
Who on earth gave this fat fuck a Physical game?? And how the fuck did he pass the medical for this gameshow?? His breathing sounds like he needs a fuckin' ventilator because the fat is pushing in his lung capacity.
Fucking lol
Oml!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Griffin brothers & Jen look like teenagers & children
Next time... On interdimensional cable 4!
HAHAHAHHAHAA!!!¬†¬† Poor ol' Rob.¬†¬† Funny as fuck tho'

LOL hahaha  2:20 bloody brilliant!
Well done Rob
Lmfao !ROBBBBB
Reminds me of James corden
Can he swing it towards the green one?. He's struggling with the orange one right next to him mate.
Christ this was painful to watch. That guy was so shit he shouldn't have been let on the show.
Genuinely haven't laughed so much at a tv program. Not only this jem but the fall in Aztec zone... amazing. Best episode of CM ever!
Why did they pick the fat guy ü§£
Did someone say autism.... On a side note, every single one of them wanks at least twice a week over that 'bird'.. FACT
I refuse to believe that this is not a satire.
This team looked absolutely on fire to begin with, like they'd actually studied the show and were going to boss every single challenge, but it went downhill pretty quick. I mean they were entertaining enough, but not quite as clever as they thought they were unfortunately.
When that other guy tripped on the fuckin stairs as well, priceless team
Cucktestant's are feeble :)
Now imagine that fight for his stuff when he's gone
Child number 9 is so hot I want him to donate his sperm to me.
humans cannot do it?? No they cannot bc any time at all sat while faze rug n the other played n rich with no jobs some ppl got lied to places while waiting
It feels like just yesterday I was putting all of you in a small cup
My dad was a sperm donor. I spent so much time wondering who he is and knowing that I will probaly never find out I have sent myself into a deep depression. This video made me cry. I WANT TO KNOW MY DAD'S NAME AND IT WILL BE ANOTHER 5 YEARS UNTIL I AM 18 AND CAN FIND OUT. :'(
So only 13 showed up
This is so messed up
k. These r all the people affected by Rachel testing if im gay
I'd natural inseminate all his daughters, hi 5 Mike.
I donated quite a few times myself :)
Reminds me of that family guy episode.
1:48 the girls with the snapchat filter killed meüòÇ
He was bustin all kindz of nuts!
This thing is a little bit cringy and hilarious at the same time
üôÑ why did we do this? Science like this should not be thing
there is a movie like this what was it!!
Im avaliable if any cute girl need to get pregnant im nice and cute.!!!!; )
I don't want to tell you kids this but your dad likes jacking off
I'm so against sperm donation. Far greater chance of inbreeding.
I'm not gonna lie. I want to bone all his daughters
This is great, bringing them all together one big extended happy family!\nSo good to see vids of happiness instead of hardships & fights.\nHold on tight to each other!
Oooooh So this was the family guy joke üòÇ
I hope my dad sees this and maybe decides to reveal himself..
Well that's fucken weird. GOODLUCK DAD
FAMILY GUY
Cum
They're low key all gorgeous lol
he has good genes hahahaha
Very amusing!
Cum again!!!
üòâ
Wait\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*YOU WHAT!?*
Dafuq
*Why would you hug the man (the sperm donor) whom you never met in your entire life? This video is very odd...*
Dad is like this is my creation, this is my army.
Awee it is kinda sad they don't really know their dad or sisters and brothers
Bring your dad to school day he tells the class he beats off for a side hustle
he needs to pay his back child supports to their mothers.
Damn, the girl in the grey shirt and blue jeans at 0:32 is thick as hell.
This is weird lol. And they're all half siblings to each other.
I dont know This is just adorable to me lol
This is so weird... it shouldn‚Äôt be like this
and that's how incest happens without knowing. sooner or later we're all going to be brothers and sisters
sweet ending   every child should have their father
He jacked off 19 times FOR SURE
WE WANT OUR BACK CHILD SUPPORT PAY NOW!!
1:54 thinks his son is Tom Cruise
I wonder how is his dating life hi I'm Mike I got 19 kids do you want my 20th
why was their only 13
The girl in white pants looks like she give good head
As you can see, none of them shook hands with him.
Why does this remind me of the CSI Miami episode with the twin boys and the sperm dad with over 100 kids üòÇ
I wouldn't want to meet my donor babies. It's not like he paid child support and tolerate their cruel succubus of a mother for 18yrs.
White people almost extinct: that is what every white guy should do- overpopulate, give birth to 100 kids each!
This is or endows no ethics no love.
The Brady bunch theme song is playing in the backgroundüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Reminds me of that one family guy episode where peter has around 100 kids because he's a sperm donor
I wanna donate now. He have grown kids that never spend dime
when i read about a lesbian couple who used a sperm donor & then the couple split up & the custodial lesbian parent  sued the donor for child support & WON, i realized being a sperm donor is a baaaad idea.
they look like serial killers to me ))
This man is a sperm donor and is more involved and caring towards to his children than most other fathers
Was it worth the 1900 dollars
Jon Snow and the 7 bastard dwarves
I think it's nice that he helped other people to have children and those children appreciate him enough to visit him; he'll never spend a lonely day in his life. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Thanks Mike
Mike's been keeping his hands busy
how do you feel when have an unsupportive family who always want you to work for others while you internally insist on creating your own empire? i am done with life
........Incest?
I keep thinking that episode of family guy where Peter meets his sperm donor kids, who knows what i'm talking about :))
Most of his kids turned out beautiful/handsome. I don't blame the moms for picking his sperm, good choice. But i did hear about some women picking a sperm donor who was mentally insane and lied on the papers.
If I had a kid every time I masturbated, I would populate a whole continent by now.
We came from your semen\nHehehehehehehehehhehehe\n\n\nIts from Family Guy
Well, I guess you get what you pay for...
Family guy did it
just because your a sperm donor doesn't make you their father.. what makes the media.. and these kids.. and this guy think its ok to pretend he cares.. He donated sperm for quick cash.. not because he wanted kids..
saving the white race, one sperm at a time
he should do incest
Lucky man
OML 19 KIDS AND COUNTING #2????
Lol
:( he made 19 ugly kids.
all ugly next
lmao they all have his nose
Well... This is the future guys.
hmmm he's a sexy dad
Now I can just imagine like a boyfriend and a girlfriend in the morning getting ready, and the dudes like ''Jessica I'm going out to see my dad'' and then Jessica's like ''yeah me too!'' And then they get there and go in the door and they're like ''JUSTIN?!'' ''JESSICA?'' And then they have really incest kids
Did his kid just call him mike? 1:45 I'd be getting a can of whoop ass if I called my dad by his name lol üòÇ
This Guy Must Be Petter North.....
Promotion, thats all.
Family guy?\nAnyone?\nNo? Hahaha
MR. STARBUCKS!
Aww
Family Guy Predicted this
„Å´„Å¶„ÇãÔºÅÔºÅ
now thats 19 kids and counting
lmao
19 kids and counting
Nie jednƒÖ by wyrucha≈Ç jeszcze :v
Dayum i feel bad for the mom sheesh
There were no conception problems, their mothers were all so ugly, no guy in his right mind was going to throw the hotdog down the hallway. That's why the donor is so handsome and his kids so ugly.
This is disgusting.
Bejay looking dapper af with his stylish suit, working hard, making connections, and making things happen at such at such a young age. What an *iconic* man. I have a feeling I am going to love this series.
Love the concept of this new series. I need new inspiration. Well done guys X
What a fantastic idea this is, I can't wait to see where you take it. Bejay was a pleasure to listen to. Would you consider, maybe, releasing this as a podcast as well?
I LOVE Lucy for exposing the yt world to a wider variety of people especially a black male who aren't always represented on this platform - so nice not having to see two middle class people talk about makeup\nYa done good girl x
do u know any archaeologists ? i would love to hear about their job
Whoop love me some representation
Omg what is this?!! I fucking love it üòç super interesting #yeslucy #golucy
Bejay has such a calming voice
This was really fun to shoot - thank you for having me on Lucy :)
How he just brushed over how you and Hannah met!
As a person who doesn't listen to podcasts all that much, this is super interesting.\n\nAlthough, the auto-focus kept focusing on the background which got kinda distracting from time to time. Sooo, take that as you will.\n\nI'm looking forward to more of your Sunday Socials!
can you please do one with an immigrant? preferably not white. thanks!
New drinking game - every time Lucy says 100%
YES IM EXCITED FOR THIS SERIES\nthis is so so gooooooood also love the positivity you are bringing\ni just love listening to long chats\nalso does anyone know what mic lucy uses?
It would be cool if you could bring some people you studied with in uni and tap into the more academic side!
I thoroughly enjoyed this Lucy. Loving the podcast vibe and how in depth you get in conversation. Bejay comes off as such a cool due! Really looking forward to what's in store for the rest of the series. Thanks for sharing, much love üíú x
Wow, it took my a while to get to this, but I found this super interesting. Great work
would there be any chance you could upload the audio somewhere as a podcast?? id love to listen to this on the bus to sixth form!! xx
this is like a youtube podcast. i love it!
I love your videos so much. You should definitely do a Brandy Melville haul
Omg this is so great already- can't wait for the next Sunday social !!!
Really enjoyed this. I find it so great to hear from people with like a different life and different perspectives in life.
I love this so much!! Can't wait to see where you're going to take it
I rate Lucy moon and I'm a chav from London
You need a better microphone the volume is very low because the microphone is a long way away
what a great conversation! i can't wait for the series lucy !
i could listen to his voice all day
For a young person trying to make it in some sort of creative industry I find this really interesting looking forward to other videos in this series
I love this !! Excited to see who you chat to next
Please don¬¥t be discouraged by my watch time. I¬¥ll return and watch it till the end. :D The series is going to be lovely, but what about some music?
This is really good Lucy, thank you!
could you do a video on what to gain the confidence to start creating stuff, like a blog or a youtube channel pls? overtime i watch you i'm inspired to share my opinions and create something publicly but i'm scared and don't even know where to start and how do you deal with the people in your life's opinions or judgements on it.
I love this - Lucy's changing the world on vid at a time
I love this video I cant wait for more of them, hopefully!
this is so great and refreshing, can't wait for the next episode!
Am i the only one that thinks the sound is bad?
loved this, I found it really empowering, aspiring and super Interesting. Definitely helped with the motivation boost I needed!
People in publishing??! Xx
This video wasn't in my sub box for at least four hours.
Really interesting chat. Great to have a high-powered guest.
Found this so interesting and enjoyable, i really love this concept already (plus it's great to watch whilst doing art coursework would recommend)
This is a bit of a breath of fresh air on youtube, not that I don't love the rest of it! However it is nice to have something that inspires you to go do something, and that great things are achievable - not just watch youtubers do them. So thanks Lucy and Bejay :)
I really enjoyed this Lucy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm so excited about this new series!
Great video! Your videos are so original and interesting!
i thought it would be great if you have a podcast, i love when you're talking about some issues or anything randomly like I'm attending Lucy's-mayor, i don't know your way of thinking kind of addicting.. üòÇüôå #golucy 
I'm glad you're doing this!
long Videos from Lucy yas I am SO happy
This is so interesting for those of us trying to pursue a creative career! Bejay was a sick starting point too, dead keen for the rest of the series x
really enjoyed this video!! i think this is an awesome idea for a video series :D

This is a great idea for a series üôå

We‚Äôre still we waiting for Simply Nailogical....  Greatest HOLLLOOOOO Hits  VOLUME 3
I've found a better way to apply loose glitter. Way easier than burnishing. All you gotta do is use a rubber stamping tool. Roll it in some glitter, the glitter sticks to the rubber stamper laying nice and flat and then you roll your nail (with sticky base coat on preferably) across the glitterfied stamp and bam. That's it. Glossy taco and done. Easiest shit ive ever done.
This is why I love watching Simply Nailogical.
Stop this cant be a nail channle this has to be HüíøLüíø
Christine Holo+Glow in the dark polish=Awesome!

Make a aquarium nail like this! Wit holo!  Plz https://youtu.be/S1LsZ8HuOq4
He beat him like he stole something.
TAP TAP TAP
Rock hold is the best middle weight ever
At least cm punk didn't tap out due to strikes \nBranch cannot be called a black belt!!!!
1 minute with a guy like cockhold at your back. brain damage or tap?
Imma beat you like you stole something.
I recall Bas Rutten stating that tapping out to strikes is the quickest way to lose respect among fighters! Respectfully, I disagree. Branch was trapped, had no where to go. It was only a matter of Few seconds and a few more punches for his lights to go out. Tapping was the smart, veteran move! At 35 years old, he doesn't have that much time left.
Great fight, but please stop telling me that Branch has earned a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under Renzo Gracie. Please stop! Maybe Ebay, Etsy, Target...I don't know. Surely he hasn't 'earned' one.
IMO It's between him and Anderson Silva over who's the best MiddleWeight. That'd be a good fight too btw.
Nothing wrong with tapping from strikes against Rockhold. Branch was probably thinking about what happened to Weidman when he got pounded on for a minute straight.
This was a boring fight ... Anything else???
He does not have a heart to stay in the ufc
Really hope all these comments aren't serious. Luke needs to beat Bisping and also give Weidman his rematch. Robert is also next in line, there's a lot for Luke to do to be called Best MW.
All the trash talking and now this? Tap from an arm bar or maybe a choke..but this? Lots of other champions got beat up a lot worst, a lot worst and didn't tap
Kinda disappointing to see him tap to strikes, I thought this was the guy to at least to fight go until the end to try to make a statement. Also feel like Luke's hairline is still much better than it might seem, I'm sure it would just look a lot better if he grew his hair a little.
Cormier needs to go ahead & retire so we can see what Luke can do at 205 since the weight cut is killing him now.
Rock hold won, but still had an awful performance.
Rockhold looked a little sluggish to me when the fight started but i guess he had no choice since branch was chasing him down like a hungry dog. I thought branch had him when he let off that flurry of punches in round one but rockhold ate the shots and stayed in the game. Can't believe branch tapped from strikes. Never thought that'd happen. I had rockhold knocking this dude out
I want Uriah hall to destroy Luke that's a fight that I wanna see
I ate unicorn meat. - Jon No Steroids Jones
this was a gimme for luke
Wow Rockhold! What happened to your hair??...
Since the cornermen wouldn't throw in the towel.
Khabib and what he taught you!
David on Wednesday- imma do dis kid dirty\n\nDavid on Saturday- ........
way too similar to the recent weidman comeback. fixed like boxing.
wth???? ive never seen a guy tap out like that. intresting
Rockhold slowly going bald ,   how's he going handle that ,   i mean ARCHER is going bald
Better hope the ref doesn't stop it\n*30 seconds later*\nBranch: tap tap tap\n\nClearly he WAS hoping the ref would stop it
JESUS is  real!!!!!! Did u know that? Look it up... The time is now
Geez, what do u even call that? Tko by tapout?
The move of the fight was, let me gently lay you down right here.
Rockhold cruzou as pernas, foi um erro mas que passou despercebido pelo oponente
essa cara n√£o tem f√¥lego pra 5luta
that was a nasty body triangle
Rockhold is really good looking, perfect physicque  tbh. Ripped and aesthetic but also with functional muscle that works in fights
Figures. First card I miss in a while, because of Canelo vs. GGG and the card turns out to be stacked with a bunch of KOs and Subs instead of decisions.
You see how he checked out his work as he walks away. this is hilarious.
Ground n pound from the wesssssssstside
David Ill keep this fight on the feet if I want Branch
Can't wait until he gets revenge against Bisping.
he will never be champ again.
Tapping out to strikes... Bob Sapp looks like he lost a lot of weight...
Lol, this is more humiliating than getting KO'd stiff.
He was finished, exhausted, no point in taking damage to look tough only then to get a busted ear drum or broken bones
What really is disappointing is branch was pretty vocal about this fight and it went this way. It makes branch look totally foolish now especially since he tapped to strikes. But branch lit up luke with a combo that landed clean and luke took it like a champ so either his chin aint so bad or bisping hits harder than we thought
Gonna go back to Brooklyn like a bitcheckc
When Rockhold gets top control it means big trouble. The athleticism keeps him there.
He tapped out with strikes wow talk to all that s***
Good job rock you beat him like he stole something lol
always bet on black lol
needs more volume, thanks.
What a beast!
Even Weidman didn't tap from strikes
Steroids
brownsville style tap
Cruz.  Great sportsman sip 
Ref shoulda stopped this
Luke I'm going bald Rockhold
To much to handle
Bisping stared him down too lol
Ref didnt save him he tapped brah
andersons not on my level, he never was LOL
Shogun rua \nTap too !
get back on track Luke
Anybody notice Rockhold's new stance?
ima bet you like you stole something
this guy needs to fight yoel ramero
Bj Penn
Luke The Dbbag Cockhold!
Luke cuckhold is losing his hair yikes
Branch is a goon
Boring commentary
David branch is one of those lying cousins...he lied to his aunt to this day about getting her UFC tickets ....hes just a scumbag who says he's going to be something when everyone knows he's not ...
Actually,I'm glad cuz he talked even more trash then Rockhold! And he's the one that said I'ma beat you like you stole something.' He ate those words.
This was a horrible match-up. No way did Branch belong in there with a guy ranked as highly as Rockhold. Period. We're getting a second helping of this farce when OSP does the same thing to Okami.
Luke roidshold
Listen mothafucka!!!
GG
Bisbing would have ko rockhold again
Sporchmensip HAHAHAH
Branch pulled a GSP
Insecure black men on suicide watch! XD
im gonna break u son
Artem Lobov is the GOAT
white genetics
Branch told rockhold in the weigh in his gonna break him. Demented mofcker lol!!
...Tapped to strikes tho??
go get bisping
Luke outcold
All shoulders
After watching Mayweather/GGG/Canelo, mma striking looks so rudimentary
Luke has a lot of potential but needs a better camp.
So does this count as a submission win for rockhold?
Luke Rockhold wrestling looked like Khabib style !
God I hate that cocky, arrogant fuckhead.  Hope he goes against romero or another 185 killer and gets ktfo again
Luke luta veia da pouxa
Rockhold has the best body among MMA athletes
Tapping from strikes, you just don't do it at this level, ever.... Forever know as the Branch (tapping from strikes) don't pull a Branch, ever lol
Either Rockhold is back or Branch is one lousy fighter.
...if Adalaide Byrd was there, she'd have given the fight to AJ Carter somehow...
dubois needs to step up in opposition for his opponents sake.
Fuck me, he went down quicker than Khan's missus on AJ.
118-110 in favour of Carter
I understand they want to build up boxers confidence against weak opposition but why the fuck are they putting fights against factory workers and cab drivers on fucking telly
Bad call from the ref. Should have called it at the 2nd knock down
Second knock down he was clearly unfit to carry on bad call ref
Good lad. He looked genuinely worried about his opponent after the KO
DD is gonna dominate in the future!! üëäüèªüëèüëèüëè
BEAST !
This boy could genuinely give AJ some problems in a couple of years time! üôÇüëç
This was my first ever boxing match, sat close to the ring, wasn't expecting to see someone pulverised within 60 seconds
I counted 22 punches thrown by the victor. Am I right?
Mad respect for the coach
He's only 20 incredible
Wow what a talent..needs to be looked after..
This is the new Mike Tyson trust me
Shouldn't of been in there
why put him in the ring against such weak opponents... mike tyson was world heavyweight champion at his age.... they will never get a shot with bullshit promotors like frank warren
I love this kid! Defo would lead in the boxing ting! Only 19 or turned 20 ! Hella young
id get KO'd for a pay day too carter its all good
giving a fuck about the person lying k.o'ed on the floor potentially seriously injured just means you're not a psychopath and not much else, just saying
This man here takeing alot people out aj Joshua will get it promise ye
Ref shoulda stopped it after the second knockdown - something horrible about refs letting fighters get knocked unconscious unnecessarily...
DB needs to be fighting in the mortal kombat tournament with liu kang and sub zero not fighting in a boxing ring
is the Referee not fired yet?
Has some solid power but as always, knocking down weaker opposition doesnt really give me an idea of how he is going to be. Against menudo he was rocked in the first round, so I want to see him take some shots against live opposition before making a call. I wish him all the best though, seems like a nice lad and still got tonnes of time to develop.
Beast! Will be champ one day for sure.
Uk boxers are on a lead
No disrespect to carter but I have seen a few of his fights and he's an awful fighter, DD is to stiff, going no were
Didn't realise that guy is British.
Rumour has it that Dubious banged out Joshua in sparring
put this guy againts failweather :D
Hearn won't be letting this guy anywhere near Joshua's dodgy chin.
Dubois got real heavy hands.
Chin meet TRUCK!!!!
Uk's Sonny Liston ü§î
definitely a future champ
happy bday aj
Well done for trending!
Newcomer.
Dangerous fight
Let me guess, stepping up the hype against nobody's, if he's that good put him in with someone worthwhile.
he will destroy joshua.. :)
Lol.. stepped into the ring.. looked at the opponent.. didn't understand what happened next.. went to bed... Zzzzzzz..( the movie was so boring that I opted to sleep instead)
You do not belong in the U.K any longer
Steroids
Ref was a scumbag for allowing it to continue after the second KD. He was on jelly legs. \n\nMismatches like this and incompetent refs like this will eventually result in an over matched opponent being killed with one shot in the ring.

#ForzaInter
Forza inter
Worst game all season, including pre-season, still winning tho..
The home side fought very well
Ci stava il pareggio , l'Inter non meritava di vincere , il Crotone ha fatto una grande partita e secondo me ci salveremo üî¥üîµüî¥üîµü¶àü¶à
Nice Hat-trick! Handanovic
Brasile vs Sfinter... che culo immondo üòÇ
forza AZZURRI
A shaky win
LIGA SERIE A TIM,presenta nola seriea tim
Il Crotone ha solo un buon portiere. L'Inter ha forse il migliore portiere del mondo (√® tra i pochissimi in lizza per esserlo). Forse a portieri invertiti il risultato sarebbe stato diverso.
Ecco guardate bene questa prestazione che una partita cos√¨ il Crotone non la fa pi√π
That line-up might be full of talent, but the midfield is way too offensive, it looks like a team Zeman might field. They'd get relegated immediately, especially in considering how tactical Serie A is, but they'd be a lot of fun to watch.\nAlso, can Kjear and Glik play in a three-man defence? RCB and LCB are not the same as a regular CB.
Ma che partita ha fatto Crotone? Non merita la sua posizione nella classifica, ne del Benevento
Inter caralho
Solito ci lo inter
Ci stava un botto il pareggio 2-2/ 1-1
Solita Inter fortunata
Solita inter ladrona

Since when have uber drivers been dangerous? heard more weird shit about black cab drivers. Don't get them twisted. The comment sections so dumb; fighting amongst each other when tfl has only banned them to get more money.
I'll be switching to Addison Lee then
I don‚Äôt see why there isn‚Äôt anything like a special ‚ÄòUber London‚Äô app or something where black cab drivers can also join the service and get the best of both worlds. TfL need to start listening to the opinions of everyone, not just the people who are directly complaining to them all the time.
Just because the idiotic board leaders of Uber decided not to comply by the law, doesn't mean 30,000+ Uber drivers deserve to lose their jobs.
Does this mean other cities in the uk get too see uber fuck off also?
Why not get a British company set up that offer the same service but without the shade. We have one in Belfast. All local people so you know you can trust them.
Sub to me i will sub back
We have Addison Lee, calm the f***k down.
Uber is the best
BLACK CABBIES are one of the very last British institutions. (They've already done away with the red phone box). Black cabbies are the eyes and ears of the the British public. To the point that the British public consider them the 5th emergency service. However I won't elaborate on standard of service between the BLACK CABBIES and the Uber service because I want you to do that on your own.
Fucking walk ffs or use the many other ways of transport in London.
Uber users it's time to get back on the bus where you belong.\nCheepskate tossers.
None of the drivers are English and dont speak English and rip you off im happy they are going
Shame on you London!!!!!!
TfL they helping there people that is u lose only English man can drive taxi in London
Uber is a much more cheaper, safer and more convenient app than most, offering details about the driver, car, route etc for the whole journey followed by the digital receipt showing all of those details. It is a helpful service to people of all ages and in many locations. \nIn London especially, this service thrives because of the appalling rates typical black cabs and transport systems charge.\nWithout Uber, lots of people are going to struggle whether it be to make it to meetings on time or to get home safely after a night out. People don't need to be waiting around and searching the streets for black cabs with drivers who know the area and charge extortionate amounts to show that knowledge, all they need is a willing driver who has GPS and a license.\nI just wish for once, when something is good and functioning, it wasn't taken away to try and rip people off by making them revert to an old outdated system.
Why just London Now the north gets 40.000 migrants
Wanna see the London everyone is talking about WATCH THIS  ‚á®‚á® https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGLPFC_tP78  \n\nMake sure you leave a comment !!!
Oh no the poor rapists err I mean uber drivers
I don't like how people just say deal with it when things happen around us that could bring us inconvenience/changing our lifestyle(or maybe people said it because they never use uber). Uber is popular in London for a reason and I think we should fight for what's better to the city instead of just saying deal with it, when you said it it is not showing resilience but indifference to the society.
Yes me too am freaking out i need uber to continue it's cab service it helps me.  I entemded to use them this coming week. GOSH Tfl
Uber has been convenient. Oh well back to that crowded bakerloo line it is then. This ban won't last though. 40,000 uber drivers in London. Enough said.
well it saved me a couple of times cheers uber, people in the comments say get over take the bus take the tube, or black cab idk man last time I took a black cab from central just remember wondering why I was paying a deposit on a house for this journey bt idk its done now
There r other taxi company's like uber u know
There's all these people complaining that uber is unsafe but no one's forcing you to use it. If you're happy to spend the extra money on a black cab, sure, go for it, but if someone else prefers uber who are you to say they shouldn't be allowed? Next they'll be banning private couriers in favour of royal mail.
SUBSCRIBE OR YOUR MOM WILL DIE IN 2 HOURS\nLIKE OR YOUR MUM WILL DIE IN 2 WEEKS
and life goes on.
Don't worry we have taxi drivers
LMAO at Londoners moaning about public transport... Try living in the North - two buses an hour, if you're lucky enough for them to bother turning up at all.
Looks like we're all gonna have to move to *england*
NNOOO I HATE USING FUCKING PUBLIC TRANSPORT, SO many creeps and nutters, I refuse to go outside ever again.
Black Cabs have become irrelevant. \n\nThey're just delaying the inevitable.
uber is evil and have piss in there balls
There are pros and cons but I would not rate Uber above average. High cost is one thing, unreliable app and also there have been safety and security issues with customers traveling with Uber and their data privacy. Uber drivers themselves have been abusing the system. There a lot of things wrong with it under the covers that customers don't even know about, too long a list to write here. As Uber has been prospering in London, there has been a drop in service quality i.e. poorer unclean vehicles, Uber drivers with an attitude and also very unhelpful sometimes. I have experienced many issues with the app which has caused me grief and incorrect charging. Uber charging structure is always changing and customer costs increasing i.e. surge (x5 sometimes !) fares, drivers don't take the short and cheaper routes, they follow the app and so more costly to customers as they know customers are charged for both time and distance. Until Uber can ensure these things are fixed, I do not welcome them back. I went back to private cabs and black cabs a while back especially during surge pricing ... its cheaper and you will find private cab owners are also working for Uber on the side in peak hours with surge multiplied :-) The customer comes first in my eyes ... not the big companies huge profit margins and their tax evasion tactics. PS. I am not a taxi driver, I am a consumer :-)
who am i:\n\n\nI'll be back in 27 years to play with your fears.i like little kids,when I see their tears\nI should be in a circus, but now I want you, \nif you come with me...you'll float too
Yeah you haven't been using uber in London unless you've had a one eyed Somali driver who lost his bus licence for too many accidents but could still pass the Uber medical. They need a fucking kick in the dick to sort out their shitty practices, this victim white knight shit they're trying to pull isn't going to work from a company we know has a frat mentality and blatant disregard for regulation
HAHAHAHAHA BLUDDY IMMIGRANTS UBER ISBANNED TAKING THE JOBS OF ENGLISH PEOPLE AND NOT GIVING BLACK CABS A CHANCE BREXIT WAS A GOOD TING\n\ndo you like my cabbie impression
TfL is clearly in the pocket of the taxi drivers. I swear next time I catch a black cab I'm not paying him. Fucking ripoff merchants.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdErj8TjT5M\nGuys please check out my friends channel he works very hard but I don't feel he get recognised \nThanks!!
I dont even use uber (because I live in my bedroom tbh) *but this is fucking stupid*
The issue with Uber is that the don't treat their driver right with pay. There is also the issue of killing business for black cabs and cab companies. The advantage of Uber it's easy to book. There are other similar alternate like kabbie
I hope the 1% that reads this will follow their dreams. My dream is to become a successful Youtuber
Why r ppl being so stupid. IT'S DAVID CAMERON'S PALS...WHO CARES
View my channel , rats in KFC video
Its just a Taxi  for goodness sake  . Some of these drivers Moonlight , for Mini cab companies when they are not Ubering!!!
As a foreigner who had to stay in London for more than a month for medical reasons, thoes cabs were a bless to have (I used Swiss Cottage), I had to pay ¬£10 to go from my place the hospital every day, while taking the black cost me ¬£50. I didn‚Äôt know how the buses and subways work there, but the cabs saved my time.
lots of twats in London
There's always Addison Leeü§∑ü§∑üí≠
The problem is, they don't like change. Change doesn't always look good, but it's necessary because it can be improvement. Fuck TFL.

More unsafe? Hahaha, dumb cunt. I've never used an uber. Life wasn't so different before they were about.
I wouldn't mind if black cabs WEREN'T SO FUCKING EXPENSIVE
Take the tube you lazy cunts
OR instead of complaining, go out and get a driver's license maybe?
To many dodgy uber drivers who shouldn't be allowed to carry passengers ( Uber's fault for been greedy and pumping out any drivers, even uber dodgy ones where welcomed
get a manual car you bellend
They focus on the fact people have to switch to different modes of transport when the real problem is all the Uber drivers that just lost their job
There's a thing called the London Underground
There are rules and they broke them, so now we get to see the repercussions. That's all there is to say.
Glad I live in Manchester, thankfully don't have to put up with this bullshit.
considering the net losses they're building up they won't be around much longer anyway
This is what people freak out about? Just hang them, damn useless.
Show some love to my recent video
Who's freaking out? I've not heard anyone freak out? Social media into meltdown? What sensationalistic bullshit.....
how is this number 1 on trending fuck off
Remember that time about 5 years ago when nobody had heard, nor cared about this cut-throat, greedy company? How on earth did we cope then? This is gonna be hard having to actually call up and book from a taxi office, like the old days.
The last comment is soooo true
CLEARLY THIS IS OPPRESSION AGAINST MINORITIES THAT WOULD BE TAXI DRIVERS TYPICALLY
tbh i only care cos what about uber eats??? i need my mcdonald‚Äôs man üò∞üò∞üò∞
So? Uber is like getting a taxi with a fifty percent higher risk of getting raped or worse.
So the London Underground and cabs aren't a thing even the bus? What about other underrated driving apps!! I swear our world is so childish lazy and self centred

Fucking good uber smelly cunts cant drive
pahaha
Fuck uber and fuck black cabs, both as bad as each other. Uber is nothing but immigrants who can't drive for shit and black cabbies are soft southern dandies with big mouths and nothing to back it up.
Ever heard of train and buses? Smh.
Wow that‚Äôs crazy! Although a lot of Uber drivers smoke before or during driving and I can‚Äôt stand the smoke :(
Oh no the basic white girls can't go to Starbucks by Uber! Even though it's a 5 minute walk away
uber totally destroyed a part of Britain, black cabs. this is good news
Funny how there is no mention at all about all the foreign uber drivers that have been sexual assaulting customers.

#YIAYBasic I went to school and barley graduated. I then put myself into crippling debt to get a higher education I never used. Next I got a dead end job and married a woman that I barely loved. We had three kids but I was always too busy to see them grow up. They never came to visit, and I ended up dying without leaving anything to show for my 70 years on this planet.

Honestly, this could be the official video and I wouldn't complain <3 Such a beautiful song :)
I found a love for me\nDarling just dive right in\nAnd follow my lead\nWell I found a girl beautiful and sweet¬†\nI never knew you were the someone waiting for me\n'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love\n\nNot knowing what it was\nI will not give you up this time\nBut darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own\nAnd in your eyes you're holding mine\n\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\nWhen you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath\nBut you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight\n\nWell I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know\nShe shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home\nI found a love, to carry more than just my secrets\nTo carry love, to carry children of our own\nWe are still kids, but we're so in love\nFighting against all odds\nI know we'll be alright this time\nDarling, just hold my hand\nBe my girl, I'll be your man\nI see my future in your eyes\n\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\nWhen I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful\nI don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight\n\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\nI have faith in what I see\nNow I know I have met an angel in person\nAnd she looks perfect\nI don't deserve this\nYou look perfect tonight

How can someone dislike this masterpiece?
Gonna play this at me and Ed Sheeran's wedding
When I first heard this song I fell in love with it right away.. ed makes perfect songs
What a lyrics......awesome and I like most is barefoot on the grass....... I don't have a girlfriend but when i listen this song I felt like someone is waiting for me Barefoot on the grass
This will get a billion views because it's soppy and people are weak and needy and useless.
1:55 \nWell ain't that hygienic?\n\n\n\nAlthough very good video, hats off to Ed!
She will never love you. She can't.
im going to sing this at my wedding
the 2K dislikes are from the people who are bitter and/or don't have a lovelife
I love this song ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
..
This music video is very cute üòç
You know your love life is f* up when you get emotional over this song while being single .

First time I was like eh. Then I kept listening to it and like huh this song is guud asf so now it's on repeat ha!
Fuck I'm in love with her and she doesn't know
It's really good song. I wish this happens to every couple lovers!
My boyfriend sang this to me and I almosted died üòóüòöüòçüòÇ
Do You know why nowadays most of singers release lyrics video first then an official video?\n'Causeeeee they make lots of money with it for example Ed Sheeran's shape of you song , songs ' lyrics video got almost 800 million viewers while its official video got 2.4 billion viewers \nWhoever idea this was, he must be reach now
oh i just love this song ... love u ed shreen
Wish someone could sing this for me lol. Be it my brother or friends lol

This so is not amazing it is perfect

this song makes me cry
If you're saying, Maybe someday, but not today.\nNo worries. You're not alone out here.
I am surprised that the Mad Hatter video by Melanie Martinez has more comments than this lyric video
Perfect Wedding Song ‚ù§
Who listening this perfect  song at 2017 ?
I'm too young to sing for my girlüòÇ
all his song are soo perfect !!!!!
You can't be a feminist and hate this song.
Ed Sheeran really is an amazing artist, his music is not like any music these days.
This is quite possibly the most beautiful love song ever written and my favorite artist sings it.
PERFECT The Perfect word for this song!
Scrolling through the comment section and all i see is people planning on using this song as a wedding song
This was my first guitar song ever, glad it‚Äôs getting some recognition

Lol to the people who don't get why tom has someone's watch, if you were a good enough fan you would of watched his vlogs from months ago and not when its most trending to realise he met someone called ron who he is now good friends with, Ron likes watches and has been taking this one watch which tom has around the world and he gave it to tom because tom keeps going to  different locations or city's around the world, once tom feels like he has took the watch around the world he will return the watch back to ron
Tom my dude üòé

Welcome to Asia Tom. :) Come to Singapore you will love the food here
Comment deleting prick
Did anyone else see the cat at 50 sec into the vid XD
Well.........you can certainly tell the videos trending, the influx of idiotic trolls is off the charts. I would say ignore them, but you likely already do.
Just give that cat a mild beating :/ Cats are dicks and so you also have to be one from time to time.
You look so much like James Franco in the caption!!
WHERE THE FUCK IS ALEXISSSS
Congrats on being 6th on trending
Buy another litterbox and see if that changes anything.\nI have 2 cats and 1 of them wouldnt poo/pee in a certain litterbox bc her sister uses it. so idk that might help
Are we going to ignore that he said he forgot his headphones and then is wearing beats a few cuts laterüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Aww thank you for mentioning my vlogs üòò Im so glad you like them!! üíó
I really like your pale complexion too, looks very elegant. I think your really pulling it of!
U should do some videos where you recreate some of those foods you like. Like the tomato and basil soup. See if you can find some recipes online and try to make it yourself. U can then tell us if it's a dupe or the recipe is a fail
I got the glasses video in my sub box!
I feel like gabby one of the only people who don't rip people off with her merch love you gabs‚ù§Ô∏è
Waaooo good
It breaks my heart to see you cry. Keep your beautiful head up , I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hope you feel better soon dear!
Hey gabs I had a question, why don't you drive?‚ú®
I use to get called Velma as well and ugly Betty in high school it put me off wearing my glasses but you look so good in yours
O.M.G I can't believe that Gabby watches Sophie Louise's videos üòÅ I'm shooküíú
Hey gab, I was thinking maybe you could give Nelly one level of ur house and bean the other, so they both have their own territory. I would hate to see u seperated from bean!
Where is Gabby's fluffy chair from?
I'm glad you found out the reason you're so tired all time. I just came home from a 12-hour blood transfusion because I was severely anaemic too - my iron levels were around a quarter of what they should be and it got to the point where even just standing up wore me out. It's super stressful and scary but it feels so good once it starts getting sorted out and you'll start feeling a lot better emotionally and physically. I don't know if you'll see this or care at all and I don't mean to come across as condescending or know-it-all, but you're not alone and it gets better! Keep being amazing! <3
Anyone wanna help a small YouTuber out?! Currently have 23 amazing subbies ‚úåüèºüòÇ x
hey love! Where's your grey jumper from? It's gorgeoussssüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
I had the same exact symptoms as you and the same exact diagnosis. It's horrible! I was a zombie for like 4 weeks.
i have pernicious anaemia and I feel like shit all the time. I get an injection every 8 weeks and feel ok for about a week but then I feel shit again. One doctor then diagnosed an underactive thyroid, put me on thyroxine and I started to feel normal. Then another doctor took me off it. I am so frustrated and tired so I feel your pain Gabs and hope you feel much better soon. I feel like women are not taken seriously with issues like this. xx
So sad to see you so upset over your health :( I just had some blood tests back cause I was feeling like you are, and I had bad iron, folate and B12 deficiency, along with some thyroid issues. They put me on iron tablets and i'm on an intensive course of B12 injections of 3 a week for 3 weeks and then one every 3 months. I had my first one yesterday and honestly I feel so much better already! Things will work out and I hope you feel better soon, I know how scary it is! xxxxx
I love funko pops, I‚Äôve got a Mary Poppins, Belle, Amy Winehouse, Agent Carter and Raymond Reddington. I completely understand when it comes to the fatigue, I have a chronic illness and now I have something wrong with my blood and being exhausted 24/7 is horrible
Hi gabs, I hope you're okay it makes me so sad to see you upset I'm keeping up with your insta and snapchat and ovbs YouTube so keep us updated!!! Also I, really loving your jumper where is it from?? All my love xxxxx
Sorry about your anemia, i can sympathize as i had bad anemia too, below 7 whatever that is!! And i remember crying while at work ( dog training) i was so exhausted.. Hope you feel better soon.
You could try adding some more spinach to the creamy one. It shouldn't change the taste too much, but it'd add some more nutrients :)
Might be daft but have you been tested for coeliac because I felt exactly the same as you, had anaemia and was deficient  in folic acid before I found out i was coeliac. Hope you get better soon X
Gabsss, how much was the fluffy poof? I need that in my lifeeeeeee üòçüòçüòç
When I was little my Mam used to make mash with spinach and cheese blended in, was the only way we‚Äôd eat it üòÇ
Gabbie can you do a makeup look whilst using and reviewing the iconic brushes üíì
You're videos always brighten up my day :)
Do the yoga challenge
That tap clip was really satisfying. I've watched it like 5 times üòÇüíó
I'm doing 30 days of yoga too! I'm on day 15 so halfway there and really been enjoying it, hope you are tooüòä
Hi gabbie I really feel for you maybe it's your B12 that is low or you are aneamic sorry for spelling but you know what I'm saying hope you feel better soon üíóüíó
I love it when you add P.O Box hauls to your vlogs. It's one of my fav things to watch ‚ù§‚ù§ xx
if anyone know where she got the pot her brushes in as I love them ? please help
I hear my BAB Conan üëÄ‚ù§Ô∏è. Also, I loooove Funko Pops. ‚ù§Ô∏è & I really hope you get better Gabs. <3 I hate seeing you upset.
Your make up looks amazing and with the glasses
you always make my day!!!!
This was a great vlog Gabbie! Just wanted to tell you, Funko Pops are not just little kids things. My sister and I are a few years older then you, and I have around 20, she has over 100. It's kind of an addicting thing to collect üòÇ.
Gabbie please check out TravelBlogBeauty‚Äôs YouTube they put so much effort into there vids, it‚Äôs so good, (like your videosüòò)
23 mins of Gabbie!! Nothing better I could wish for‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I hate seeing you so upset! I love you much gabbie! Have been watching your videos for years! Xxx
omg your cats are to die for so flipping cute I love your videos
Girl I relate to you so much !\nMary Poppins and Pocahontas are my absolute 2 favourites ! I already own the Pocahontas Pop, now I want Mary Poppins.\nLove from France
I hope you‚Äôre feeling better xx love you lots xx
Does anyone else have a marathon of Gabbie's videos to make themselves better? I know I doüíó
#yiaybasic writing a comment about how Starbucks is basic
I just sat through a 3 min ad before the video started .. your welcome gabs
Where are the Funko Pops from? üòçüòç
Absolutely love your vlogs gab ‚ù§Ô∏è Is Jeremy still going by Jeremy or is he now bean? üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Do you have mono? Saw Hannah is recovering from it and similar symptoms. It makes you very very tired and lasts a long time.
When I heard Conan gray in the background I was shook
I thought you were plant based? I haven't been watching for ages so im probably just behind
Love this vlog Gab!! Hope you are doing okay now! Just wondering is Bean staying with you? Love you! Xx
Tbh I don‚Äôt think funkopop are childish because they‚Äôre not really toys, they like collective things..(lol) so it‚Äôs more likely that older people are gonna buy them to collect them right?ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ
My husband stepped on my ghd's, needless to say they no longer work. This has just reminded me how much I miss them. üò©üò≠
Omg Nellie's stress eye üò≠ I've never related to a cat so much üòÇ
I'm so glad you're getting sorted! B12 deficiency is horrible üò¢ I couldn't even hold a knife and fork at one point.  The injections are so good though, they make me feel human again üòÇ Hope they sort you out, and that you feel back to your old self soon! ‚ò∫ Xx
My cat gets stressed like that, she used to lick parts of her fur off her back, you can get a plug in from the vets that releases this calming smell and it stops them from getting so stressed, we did that with my cat, Mouse and it just calms them down and it's really good.
Where is your grey jumper from?? Hope you feel better soon Gabs üíó
I had SUPER bad anaemia at university my haemoglobin was 4.6 and I had to have 2 blood transfusions. It came back again this year, but with iron tablets I can keep it under control really well. I know exactly how you feel it is absolutely EXHAUSTING :( just walking up some stairs is like running a marathon. Big love xx
Babe you might have pernicious anaemia - that's exactly how I was! regular b12 jabs helps I have mine every 8-10 weeks but still suffer! thinking of you :( xxx
I have the same toothbrush as you ‚ò∫Ô∏è

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME THIS IS THE BEST GIFT
Gabby ,honney ,calcium from the cream dont let iron to digest .i dont try to down you but wish you all best.soo i think you should eat your spinach other way,,üíü
Gabbie where is your grey jumper from half way through? Looks amazing xx
Gabs, I eat spinach with every meal and its so easy. If you chuck it in an omelette, a smoothie, soup, pasta you can't really taste it and it's a good way of getting extra iron. Just a tip :)
I didn't know how much I loved cats until I seen NelsonüòÇ‚òπÔ∏è
Hi Gabbie! I'm so sorry you're not feeling ok. I had the same problems after my surgery and i've found my way with pills and super foods. I've found some books on amazon and found the right amount of everything i was missing on my diet!  I hope you can solve soon all this problems and came back healthier than ever!Wish you the best and sending you big hugs!Take care ‚ù§\nRobby

Gabriella!! You should read this! Maybe it helps you, Nelly, and little Bean!!\n\nI'm sure a lot of people have commented this, but Jeremy might be marking his territority (they are both males, and cats are territorial beings.) Have you had them/ him neutered? Tomcats (and some she-cats) will start to pee once they become sexually mature, especially when there are other male cats around and there's little space. At your parents' place there may be more space and he may feel less pressured into marking his territory. It's just a guess. But it doesn't have to mean that he must leave you to live with them. Neutering is a personal decision regarding tomcats, but it can be an option.\n\nAlso, if you can, try to fit in another cat toilet. We have two cats and two toilets (because it works out fine), but normally they advise you to have 1 toilet per cat + 1 extra toilet (2 cats, 3 toilets). \n\nLastly, I once had a cat with kidney problems. He peed all over the place until we found out he had renal failure. Should little Bean continue to pee (nevermind where) despite having been neutered, have the vet check his kidneys! Be thorough about it if that remains one of the last options, as some vets are reluctant to do that (especially for young cats, but British Shorthair cats are at an increased risk for kidney problems like PKD and you only detect it in the cat's behaviour after 2/3 of the kidneys are already beyond repair).\n\nI hope this helps you solve your troubles. To depart from such a sweetling would be heartbreaking (even if it were for the better, and then that couldn't be changed and you'd be doing the right thing)!\n\nLove :-)
Cream doesn't have lactose in it so the spinach is probably fine as usually it's the lactose in dairy that people react to. My mum doesn't eat/drink dairy but she does have a bit of cream sometimes x
NO HATE but that bookcase looks like IKEA for 20 bucks

It breaks my heart knowing that Tim is considering in giving Domo away. Imagine how betrayed and devastated Domo would feel if he knows.  Please treat Domo and Chubbi like how you treat Issac and Ayla, to them, you and Tim are basically their whole life!  Domo and Chubbi love you two unconditionally, you should also love them with all your hearts.
My son refused the bottle all of a sudden at around week 10 as well! We were giving him at least one bottle of expressed milk a day from day 1. My dentist told me to try warming the nipple up before giving him the bottle. So I tried it. I dunked the whole thing into hot water in a bowl from the Asian kettle, and he took it! (Of course make sure it's just warm to the touch but not hot.) I think making it warmer makes it feel more like the boob. Also, if you are like how I was (with plenty of milk and a fast let down), the baby gets milk faster from us than the newborn bottle nipples. So warming it up also makes the milk flow faster. Hope that helps you and Ayla! You guys are all too cute :)!
Maybe Tim not as good as it looks. Once I heard him want to give Domo away. I JUST HATE TIM. I started to look Tim as ugly, fat and sissy person
Poor Domo. I can really understand Tims frustration though, I felt the same way about my dog when she got out and bit another dog and I was verbally attacked in the street for it. It was for a split second until I got her home and saw how guilty she looked about it and I gave her the appropriate scolding and spent the rest of the day cuddling her. It's a feeling of overwhelming frustration at something you've been trying to train out and tackle for so long and nothings working. I'd never give my dog away. Ever. But in that moment I was so upset and frustrated and then having been verbally attacked I was very shaken and your head just goes it's own way.
This too shall pass, have patience and faith! I'm sure the little guy is just stressed out at moment and everything will be fine soon!
I feel sad for domo.. I feel the dogs are very well behave and domo need time to adapt to the new changes.
I'm not taking Tim saying he wants to get rid of Domo too seriously because I've grown up with my dad being dead ass serious when he said he wanted to get rid of our animals all the time, but in the end he never does. Yes it's not a nice thing to say but trying to take care of two dogs, a toddler and a new born baby is a hard thing to do. I'm pretty sure if I was in their situation I would be thinking about that all the time. Bubz is being an amazing mum and is looking for solutions to help Domo. So please, please, please think before commenting something hurtful because I'm pretty sure it helps them in no way possible and it makes them feel like shit.(excuse my French) Bubz keep being an awesome parent, you're doing wonderful <3
Mommy's Yucky Eyebrow lol... I literally laughed out loud. You did say kids don't lie.
My advice - don't give the human baby cows milk because it's meant for cows üñíüòä
Try change the bottle teats.. I had the same problem in the beginning too.. oh btw, Ayla and my baby girl share the same birth month and year üòâ
Guys, let's try to not be so negative about all of this. Yes, that's very harsh of Tim but I 100% trust that Bubz will do the right thing! Let's not paint Tim as a monster just because of it, I bet he is in a lot of stress right now and everybody here is a human who made mistakes before. Let's all unite and appreciate Isaac's mommy yucky eyebrows.
Calm down everyone with the Tim is wrong comments. If you've been a loyal Bubscriber for a while, you'd know that Tim has favoured Chubbi more than Domo BUT he has gone out of his way to love the dogs. \n\nDon't you all remember when Isaac was born? The dogs were made to stay outside the room for the sake of the baby. Tim slept outside many times to help ease the dogs into the new no inside bedroom situation. Obviously Chubbi would not have shown that much issue with the situation as much as Domo as we know he is pretty needy and will cry outside of the bedroom. \n\nI'm sure Tim would have slept outside the bedroom for the dogs this round with Ayla too, but they now live in a double storey house and not an apartment. It's easier in an apartment for him to keep tabs on Lindy and the baby as well as on the dogs. He can't do that here with the kids and Lindy upstairs and the dogs downstairs. He has to keep his priorities straight and make sure that Lindy always has a helping hand with Isaac who is running around and Ayla who's not really taking the bottle. This means Lindy has her hands full with Ayla. \n\nSo please keep your comments about how Tim and Lindy handle their household to yourselves. It's their choice how they want to manage their home and who is in it. Lindy probably shouldn't have worded it the way she did, but y'all as Bubscribers should keep an open mind. \n\nWe all know Tim wouldn't just get rid of Domo. They'll certainly explore all their options before choosing one. So please, leave Tim alone. Don't give him grief about him being irritated at Domo. I would be pretty pissed off too with kids in the house and a Domo that poops everywhere. Heck, we all know Domo poop is usually everywhere and it becomes a scary battlefield making sure all the poops are taken care off to make sure Isaac doesn't touch it. \n\nI wish Lindy and Tim the best.
Poor Domo, this is a disappointing vlog.
Im legit unsubscribing if they are letting go domo (or any dogs!!!) \nOther than babies, dogs give us humans life! Fkn tim.
I am not a mommy, but to make the baby drink from the bottle, all you have to do is heat a knife and dump it in  the milk and then take it out. That's what my ancestors have been doing and it actually works.
When Isaac says 'eyebrows' with a Northern Irish accent üòç
Ayla is getting so pretty and omg she is so so so sweet <3 Isaac is such a good big brother too!!! Kudos to you and Tim for being such great parents to 4 kids!
Maybe you should give Domo away to a family that will love him more then YOU BOTH DO!   Remember when Bubz put Domo in the shower and shut him in there as punishment.
I'm unsubbing if they give Domo away. I like Tim and I understand that he's tired and frustrated cleaning up after Domo (an extremely anxious dog) but I hate HATE people who get rid of their pets just because they're tired of caring/ cleaning up after them. And Bubz said so herself that Tim was serious when he suggested giving Domo away. I am appalled.
I think you guys should just let the dogs sleep with you,it's not going to hurt the baby.it might fix the pooping on the floor problem.
Have you tried the minibie bottle? I've never tried them but they advertise their nipples as mimicking the shape of the breast in the baby's mouth. Worth a shot in ayla's case.
Hey bubz, I'd recommend having Tim feed Ayla for a day with expressed milk. She associates you, your smell and body too much with feeding and comfort. Getting her accustomed to another set of arms holding her and feeding her will help. Try to have tim hold her in a similar way you do so that it isn't too big of a change for her to adjust to. She is still pretty young so she should adjust pretty fast. That's my suggestion. Hope it helps!
For Ayla, I would suggest finding a bottle with a nipple that almost feels more real if that's possible. Or maybe, bottle feed her, but keep her close to the boob?
Bubz,  Looks like it's time for a new intro now that Issac is so big and we need to see Ayla. Can't wait to see what you guys come up with. :)
I can't wait to see a new Intro with Issac AND Ayla üòçüòçüòç
i agree don't give your dog away. domo is already your pet giving him away shouldn't be an option but i feel sorry for Tim though! you're so lucky to have a husband like Tim! ü§óü§óü§ó
I am not a mother, but i have watched a lot of babies and a few of them rejected expressed milk. Mostly the kids take it because it taste like their mothers, but other times the babies will reject them for either the bottle itself and not liking the top of it (i forgot the name xD) or they just refuse in general. We try to give it to them even when they refuse it and tell them that is all we have, which is literally all we have and in most cases they take it.
Try a different nipple on the bottle. Some babies are particular since they‚Äôre used to the actual mom‚Äôs nips!
have you considered crate training domo? i think putting him in a large crate would be like putting him in his bedroom and it would contain the nervous poo onto a pad. it eventually would become familiar to him that the crate means bedtime. you can put a bed, some toys, and a treat in there too.
I feel like I missed so much, I stopped watching for a little and when I come back you're already on baby #2 . CONGRATULATIONS BTW <3
Maybe try a different bottle for Ayla. My son is 7wks old and we had to try different bottles for him to take my expressed milk as well. We are using bornFree breeze bottles
Crate training really is a blessing. IMPORTANT : Make sure you give them a big enough crate to lay down comfortably in, but not too big where they can poop everywhere. That way domo learns you take him out on a schedule during the night time and he is less likely to poop, and if he cant hold it unfortunately at least its contained. \n\nI use to be stressed a lot with my first dog pooping everywhere when i was younger, this time around I crate trained my fur baby and he is perfect hardly no accidents unless hes sick.\n\nGood luck Bubz!
isaac is such a sweet and cute boy! And ayla is just so cute, my heart aches from too much cuteness
Try crate training the pups. As far as the bottle, try a ‚ÄúTommy Tippee‚Äù it‚Äôs rounder like a breast, and has a more natural nipple.
Look for the Munchkin Latch bottles! They have a nipple very similar to a natural one. It helps with gas as well. We used them with my son and never had a Latch issue. Also make sure the milk is at a nice warm mommy temp! My son wouldn't drink it even if it was a little cool!
Bubz! I am a teacher still in Uni studying to get my full degree! Do you think you would ever upload interviews (Basically just asking certain questions) conducted between maybe daddy and Isaac? Or you and Isaac? Or even with Ayla when she is old enough to speak? These are very cute and helpful when studying children! Just a question:)
you can put Domo in an enclosed area like a play pen or something covered with training pads. That way at least it is contained until they are allowed to interact with Ayla.
Have you tried different bottles? Sometimes it is purely trial and error. I think I went through 6 different brands of bottles before finding the ones my daughter loves. The wider bottles with larger nipples seem to be better as breastfed babies  get nipple and areola in their mouth and wider bottles/nipples give them that good suction. Also, try sleeping on one of her blankets so when you go out,whoever is trying to feed her can wrap her in the blanket so it smells like you too.
Need to get a large dog cage for their beds at night. Put both in same cage with newspaper in one end and large bed in the other end
Why don't you just get a kitty litter tray?
Lindy please try breast feeding Ayla exclusively until she's six months old, that way you will be giving her extra nutrients that the formula milk won't give her. If you need to leave her you can storage your milk in the freezer for two months! And the end this is an advice from an stranger and I believe you are free to do whatever you want with your Family. God bless you and your lovely family ‚ù§Ô∏è love from Mexico üá≤üáΩ
My dog was bad for peeing on the floor when left even though he was let out lots of times. I decided to crate train him and he's never done it since. Dogs don't like to pee/poo where they sleep.
My baby is as chubby as yours! He's 96 percentile solely on breastmilk üòÇGlad to know I'm not alone!
Bubz I think we need an updated intro with Ayla >_<
My 2 year old nephew went through a stage of taking the blame for everyone elses farts.
LOL bubz's calves at the end kind of look like a naked butt
I'd give heaven and earth to have my old boy Max back.  I had the same problem but he was 13 which is a good age for a German Shepherd.  I never told him off because he couldn't help it.  I'll have Domo if Tim really doesn't want him, he's never known any difference in his life. Surely Chubbi would have terrible anxiety if Domo goes?  I'd rather pick up poo for the rest of my life just to have him back üòü
My son was 9months old when I had to stop breastfeeding suddenly do to his health. He was in hospital and he was reacting to proteins in my breastmilk. It took him 8 days to finally accept a bottle. This was after 4 days of NG tube feedings. Finally we were discharged and the next morning at home he accepted the bottle!!!!! However, in your case if she is still accepting breast then try your best to just keep on nursing. If you must leave a bottle she won't starve herself. If she is hungry enough she will take it. Also try a bunch of different bottles and nipples. She may find one she likes. :)
You can pump your milk as you need it and then refrigerate it. It only last a few hours but\nYou can use it as much as you need it. You can add rice cereal or wheat cereal when she gets older..6 months. So it would last longer.
NOOOOOOOOOO PLS DON GIVE DOMO AWAY PLS aft a year when Ayla gets her own room, everything will be fine :‚Äô)
Maybe you can consider transitioning the dogs from sleeping on your bed to the floor of your room for example and then to the door of your room and then slowly to downstairs. This might be a better transition for them instead of all of a sudden being pushed to sleep downstairs. Though i'm sure you possibly have your reasons for not wanting to keep them in the same room anymore now that Ayla sleeps in the bed. But might be worth trying. Domo is probably just pooping everywhere somewhat for the attention because he feels neglected.
ur skin is so amazing
Maybe crate domo and chubby and put them outside (or maybe even inside) your bedroom for a few nights and then eventually crate them downstairs? Slowly adjust them to it. They've spent ages sleeping in your room and now to suddenly have things change is bound to be stressful :( I hope it all gets sorted bubz ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I've always liked Domo over Chubbi. He seems like such a sweet soul.
Regarding the Domo thing, maybe get him a dog house and put him outside overnight?
Poor domo! : ( glad to see Ayla is healthy! Have you try nipple sizes for bottles you used when Issac is a baby?
When reprimanding Domo, be sure you are not doing it later in the day long after he has done it. There is a prime window of 60 seconds between the action and the reaction where it will make sense to a dog or even a child. If you catch him in the act, immediate reprimanding is the best way but after that 60 second window, he doesn't understand why he is being punished and will think that is just what you are going to do to him when you wake up.
Please don't give him away! Having two kids around the house must not be easy for Domo... You're all a family and can definitely work this out! :)
Please give domo some extra loving he needs it
is it possible domo is sick? bring him to the vet and get blood tests.  he's getting to be older now and seems a bit less energetic than he used to.
Honestly, if they give Domo away they are not the people who I thought they are. When your family member needs help you don't send him away because he annoys you. You help him/her.\nYour dog is acting this way because of you.
Tim is such an asshole for wanting to give Domo away instead of trying to fix the problem. The poor dog just has separation anxiety.
I understand many of you who are concerned about Domo and feel that Tim is an a**hole for wanting to give him away over the whole poo issue. But I hope you guys can be understanding and try to see from his point of view as well. There is more to a situation/story than what is being told. I hope everyone can be understanding and whatever choice the Bubz family makes I hope everyone respects that as well. \nThank you :D
Why not put a doggie door in the back door, then they can go in and out whenever they please. They usually get the hang of it in one go!
Don't worry bubz I've had the same problem with my dog! At first my family was very frustrated and even considered giving the dog away, but after a few weeks of leash training and adjusting to a new routine, my dog rarely ever goes in the house. When he was a puppy, we didn't put him in a crate, but we did leash him down so he wouldn't wander around at night. He sleeps without the leash because he's knows where he's supposed to go. (I was one of those families that yelled at my dog...not proud of it and I don't do it anymore, but I see where Tim is coming from with domo)
It's the fact you now have two kids and probably don't spend time with them the way you did before. He's stressed and anxious. Tim's a jerk for wanting to just give him away. Shows little interest in actually wanting to solve the issue.  Probably doesn't help yelling at the dogs. Or making them sleep away from you when they're used to sleeping with you all the time.
:( Poor sad Domo. At the end of the video when he just walked away he just looked so unhappy. I hope he adjusts soon and can be the cute smiley dog we all know again.
Full offence intended (only to Tim because hes an asshole) And I dont mean to say all this just cause I just am blunt and am so frustrated after watching this lol. I know Tim is bubz husband but hes a pretty shitty one. Lol if its not the fighting from taking care of Isaac in the beginning to being away from bubz and making her juggle two kids or a kid and a pregnancy alot, its him ALWAYS on his phone (extremely disrespectful) around bubz, him not wanting a daughter, him not seeming  to care much when she had a miscarriage to always being in his mancave lmao now not wanting domo cause he cant even be a responsible owner and pick up after his own pet. \nBubz. To a person, a dog is only a part of their life but to a dog you are their whole life. How can Tim so easily toss away a best friend that has been with you for so long!! If you guys get rid of domo i dont ever know anymore :/ thats getting rid of some happiness to your life, to Isaac's life, and maybe to Ayla's life. Idgaf if Tim dont want him. Please don't get rid of him. A person has to know loyalty. Ive never heard a single damn person getting rid of their dog because it poops too much LOL\n THATS RIDICULOUS. If hes so good building shit, he should build a doggy door. And if its cause you guys are concerned for the dogs being out at night, it just takes a little damn commiment to take him out before you guys sleep and wake up just a little early to take him out. Sorry for the rant.
Pls don't give away your dogs. They would be very sad without you. üò≠
Now now guys, theres no reason to hate on tim. They're working something out so why be toxic about it?
My son was the SAME way! He would NOT take a bottle at all. It made getting out of the house hard, because I was too self conscious to breastfeed in public. It caused me to not leave the house very often at all. I tried several different bottles, but he just never took it. He was also very reluctant to use a sippy cup! It was crazy lol. I'd say test out a couple different bottles and hopefully you'll find one she likes <3 I know that's not really advice, but just saying my son was very stubborn about taking anything other than the boob Ôºº(ÔΩÄ0¬¥)Ôºè LOLOL
I hope this doesn't worry you or your following but my dog did the same thing. Come to find out, my dog had addison's disease and he almost died. I would take him to the vet to rule out any weird underlying issues. It could be just separation anxiety, but it never hurts to get blood work done for domo and chubby!
If she sees that ur not there and u give her to tim she will get the idea that ‚Äú ok mommy is not here i guess im going to have to drink this ‚Äú thats what my mom did with my little sister and it worked for us but u have to stay away from her for a while so she can see that ur not coming back anytime soon
To all the people being negative towards Tim, I think ya'll are not seeing it from Tim's pov. It's not that Tim doesn't like Domo, it's that they may not have the time to put into training or giving him the correct treatment Domo may need. Giving him away to a family that can care for him maybe a better solution (not the only solution but I think Tim would be open to suggestions).
Poor Domo... plz don't get rid of him. He's family.
plz dont throw domo away !!!! be patient with him
I'm heartbroken at the Domo situation. Poor little mite. I've been watching your videos since you started youtube bubz and I love you so much and will support you to the end but the thought of Domo with separation anxiety and probably being nervous all the time along with probably not feeling as loved as everyone else in the house really does break my heart. I honestly hope you get the situation sorted soon for his sake.
Call a dog trainer. ¬†It's not sanitary with two small kids around, everybody barefoot and you have dog poo smeared on your floors. ¬†Cleaning that everyday has got to sux. Doggie is crying out for attention, he looks so sad walking away.
Sorry, but resenting a dog/person/living being for not being perfect and having psychological issues is just horrible

Disappointed with how Tim thinks
About domo! My dog used to go all over the place when she was alone because of separation anxiety! For me it worked to just let her stay in a small enclosed space, like a cage or a very small room. Since I did that whenever Im not there she hasn't had an accident.

So glad J did this again! Saw that he did it live, and it's still sad that Chester can't be there to sing with him...\n\nRIP Chester ‚ù§
:'( I appreciate Jay Z did this; still made me cry though. I miss you, Chester </3
I SEE HIM SINGING FROM DEEP DOWN HIS SOUL.... RESPECT J
No disrespect but the way he moves with the mike one the stand looks like he has stomach cramps or something. Not sure why he does it but it¬¥s just distracting.
Im sure Chester was hanging around here watching the performance in spirit.

I love jay züò¢üò™ I'm a Jamaican artist please let's do a song together JüíØüôèüèæ
I'm so glad that he chose to do this song, very surprised on how few artists have covered Linkin Park over Live Lounge Month when there's probably a good number of them who were influenced by them in some way. I know that some artists might not have the vocal range to be able to do LP songs but still would be nice to have a few of them do it.
When this mashup had been released I was listening it like 10 times everyday.  And after more than 12 years it's still actual, deep and toughfull
I remember this mash up with Jay-Z and Linkin Park. Hearing it for the first time in years is quite haunting now that Chester is dead. I would put this on repeat while hacking and slashing through Fomor Prarie in Vindictus.
I remember struggling to get the ‚ÄúNumb‚Äù remix from Limewire since the file said ‚Äúerror‚Äù... time is just bittersweet RIP
It felt like he was backstage singing.....Miss u Chester!!!
I really wish I could've seen Linkin Park and Jay Z perform together :(
this song sound better when u galf drunk like me riht now
he closed his eyes all the time...
The 161 people who disliked this video don't have souls
For one last time I need y'all to roar.
That was powerful. My heartstrings are no more.
Them 158 people who dislike this need  a slap in the face!
Og Legendary Jay Z still killing it! But Chester's voice forced me to shed a tearüò¢ bittersweet melancholy!
So much respect for Jay
Never seen j do a whole song with his eyes closed, respect for Chester emotion shown
Chester you will continue to live in our hearts forever!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I remember when Jay and LP decided to do this, and it flew by the music world so fast, cause they made you appreciate it quickly. One of the coolest things being a fan of music was their mash up.

Doesn't TFL realise their affecting the Uber drivers and their families. Just wait till the unemployment rate go up.
Most uber drivers are poor migrants from eastern europe and middle east, it makes sense to ban Uber so locals can do traditional cab jobs for higher pay.\n\nThis also reduce the number of jobs in that sector so the migrant workers can go back to their own country.
If the people over in the UK want to ride in uber taxis, they should be free to do so. If the women fear being raped by an uber driver, they will stop using their services and uber will go out of business due to lack of customers. From what I understand, there are actually less rapes and sexual assaults reported against uber drivers than there are with your black cab drivers. This shows it's all about money and power. Apparently the owner of black cab has influence with the government to shut down his competition that is offering a service at a lower price.
Uber had 32 allegations of sexual assault or rape, but there were 122 allegations of sexual assault and rape against black cab and other taxi companies in the UK last year. Why are they not renewing black cab's license? It's all about big money and influence. Black cab transports the Royal family staff and the owner has friends in high places. They're shutting down black cab's competitor, uber, ¬†which is unfair trading practices and goes against free market principles. Competition helps the consumer by offering them lower prices.
First off all....what about all these uber drivers...their jobs???
So Uber are paying Youtube to put these stories on trending? There's 3 of them, come on. This really isn't a big deal. \nI would say it ucks for the immigrant Uber driver, cuz they will have to go back maybe but to be fair London seems a seperate community to the rest of England so maybe they can stay and just claim benefits like their wives probably do. \nLet's hope this gets sorted out, we wnt peoplpe from wherever working
Wait, we are the customers, why can't we do something about this? Theresa May kill TFL off now. Why do we even need this stupid agency? If there's a problem with the company, get a class action lawsuit (that is ALL you need, and some investigators - THAT'S IT), if the company is surcharging somehow or abusing its power, then do the same - prohibiting somebody is just screwing the rest of us while the black cabbies get to charge us through the roof because they don't want to actually work for their money.
Feel sorry for the diver this happened is Austin and lots lost there jobs
uber got 20 million customers and 800k drivers and staff but their petition signed by 300k .
Boo hoo. A tax dodging company with a multi-millionaire at the helm doesn't get the rub of the green for once.\nPersonally, I'd love to see them go out of business. They're basically a loan shark company. If you want to be a cab driver, apply for a licence, learn the knowledge and be a proper cab driver.
Islamic migrant uber drives rape and assault woman.  I think we know what the real problem is.
Fuck black cabs they over charge and con customers that's why people use uber because they are cheaper plus tfl say that black cabs are safer but there has been more sexual assaults by Cab/taxi drivers over the years and they say black cabs are safer my arse they are just as bad as each other
Comunist propaganda media BBC is happy that London dropped the license for Uber, what a surprise...
Peng Ting Call Maddison Come Jump In My Addison Lee, Because you can‚Äôt take Uber
Damnit I‚Äôll be in London next month
fck TFL and Fck Black cabs mafia, scums and while you at it fck sadiq khan another crook
fuck you england you pig ass country. you're bullshitting. you just want to exploit people for cash the same way uber does. black cab drivers can sexually assault as well.
Now the can work in supermarkets  they need trolley man's?
Comply or confiscate 10% of the company. Next non compliance take 30% of the company. Next non-compliance take 50% of the company and send in government representatives to work on their board. First job to sack the CEO.
Black cab nothing else ...but black cab is soul of london
Tfl just mad that they‚Äôve not making enough ¬£¬£ due to Uber being cheaper and more efficient. Just get better cabs and better rail service and you won‚Äôt be hated by the consumer...
There's both good and bad to this
How can they justify the government putting all these drivers out of a job and somehow frame it like it is Ubers fault.  Ubers drivers should understand the risks of going into debt when you buy a new vehicle and that there are safety concerns over picking up strangers.
Let the public decide whether Uber is a responsible corporation not tfl who coincidentally will make more money from this...
What does this mean then... can we not use uber in london anymore
Yes. London, courageous move.\nShut them down. Not good for anybody. Except Uber.\nNasty company.
Get a bus pass you bunch of moaners.
Interesting like to dislike ratio.ü§î
Not a fan of Uber.  Drivers are so bad at driving often dangerous. Cars in poor condition. Prob not the case for everyone iam sure. I do believe they should have the same training as a black cab. But the black cab prices needs to be regulated. Iam sure TFL needs to work on running the Tube 24 hours giving the black cab more competition.
The Mayor of London has a memory problem.\nJohn Worboys known as the Black Cab Rapist attacked almost 100 women over several years right under the noses of the police and the Black Cab Drivers Association
Don't worry everyone it's only London!.......the rest of Britain don't give a fuck about them!
THANK FUCK. literally a terrorist could be an Uber driver.
Im glad for the black cab drivers
How much is the bribe ? How much did the local taxi company pay the city to kill their competitor ?
TfL Just wants money that‚Äôs y
I guess more nights where I have to wait till 5 in the morning to catch a train home
Why the fuck is this even news? Or it affects the centre of the known universe, my mistake. Londonistan the shit stain on the rest of England.
It's so shit there's a body above the average person that can make decisions like this, if people chose to use the service because they like and trust it, it should be left alone. Just as much dogy shit would go on in a taxi, it's just because Uber is new and taking money out of other areas they want any reason to shut it down. Uber has been the first demonstration in a long time of a service mad for us, the everyday person, and to see it being removed is going to be a massive step backwards for the future of technology.
the sexual assaults are a muslim problem not an uber problem, i've taken a lot of ubers and only ever had two non muslim drivers who were very nice. the rest are creepy shady fucks with poor english and terrible manners
My guess is black cabs, taxis and after transports in London are feeling threatened by Uber and they're trying to find a way to shut them down.
Don't worry another similar  mob will step in to satisfy the penny pinchers.
Looks like we'll see more faketaxi videos on hub...
government double standards?  say it ain't so!
I don't get this.....someone plz explain
Serial users of the app shouldn't fret As a serial rapist I am glad to be able to continue operating.
Why anybody would want to live in London I do not know.
Please can someone start a counter-petition so¬†that London can be rid of this¬†Uber scum forever!
Tech firm at top, lots of money, small people at bottom looking for scraps.
what the f*ck I live in the UK and I heard about this
Uber had plenty of chances to conform and follow the rules that all other Private Hire companies follow, but they chose not to. The victims here are the Uber drivers and the culprit is the greed of Uber and TfL. TfL, from the start, allowed Uber to bypass laws that all other PH companies had to follow by law. Once the numbers of drivers started coming through, TfL saw Uber as a great way of raising money. 100% increase in PH drivers in 4 years? Really? Think about it. All the points that have led to the refusal of Uber's licence are things that other PH companies are doing as a matter of course. But really, TfL allowing Uber to use their own company to do DBS checks and then they are wrong ones? Uber convincing passengers that complaints should go to Uber first? Not TfL or the Police but Uber? Even sexual assaults. I honestly feel for their legitimate drivers but I'm sure that a lot of PH and Taxi drivers in Brighton and Welwyn Garden etc, where TfL licensed Uber drivers are illegally plying for hire and stealing their living, are glad to see them go.
This is conspiracy,Uber try to avoid responsibility,they had four mounts to resolve the problem with TfL,and they didn't find any solution because this is theatre ,even they don't prepare the drivers about this because are irresponsible and they must be convicted to pay conpesations to all this people
I want to know how many Uber drivers have been involved in sex attacks. Where are the figures? They must be bad.
The public transport (tube and buses) in London has to be buffed then, Uber was great for saving money but not great for emissions, if they can improve public transport then its a win win unless you're an uber driver
Losing too much money from cabs. Simple as that.
Good job by TFL...Uber do not play by the rules...It's a matter of preference though , some people like to be driven round on the cheap by a third world muslim sex offender who could not drive a carrot up a bulls arse¬†and has not got proper hire and reward insurance , and¬†some of us do not..
So the reason we can't have the cheap uber option is so we can protect expensive black cabs?

What about every single taxi driver cheating on mileage by taking their cars to cousin and make a 120000 miles disappear from the clock - every single one!!!!!!
luckily there is other company's that are cheap, ¬£10 for a ride so...it's not that bad
Excellent Brexit now uber. Its a big v from the British to capitalism. Can't be brought by money any more. The dog is finally wagging its tail and not the other way round
üòäone very happy black cabby , who is looking forward to higher earnings now that uber have been given the shoulder
Bloody good job too. TFL please DO NOT back down. These parasites don't need to do the knowledge, they have just walked in on a market and they think that's fine, well sunshiners it bloody aint. Too many complaints about them.
I like how EVERYONE is bashing on TFL for taking precautions over people's safety, I wonder how you'd feel if you got sexually assaulted and Uber never did anything to help or support you. Yes it's an inconvenience to you guys, but where there's money to be made someone else will pop up.
I'm too sure why people are so annoyed, if Uber hadn't been cutting corners for years they wouldn't be in this situation
As a Londoner, I NEVER use the expensive Black Cabs. Fuck TFL always increasing their fares also & Uber must be allowed to operate
From ex Uber driver: GREAT DECISION.  UBER TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES LIKE SHIT.
Isn't is funny how I got and uber ad before this lol
In London I've seen multiple times Uber drivers and black cab drivers talking to each other having a chat. And they both get the same amount of costumers. I just don't see the problem. Uber isn't even that big in London
My dad's an uber driver and he's working so many hours 6 days a week because we need the money . We're already struggling but I'm just scared about how he's gonna cope now . He's been trying for Addison Lee but it's hard
The ‚Äú we are iconic‚Äù argument does not wash either. Red telephone boxes were iconic too but with the advance of technology they had to be taken off the streets. \n\nRegarding the environment, all the Uber cars I have been in were hybrid, new and clean. Black cabs I have been in have been the old dirty diesel engines. I thought Sadiq Khan was hot on the environment and emissions?\n\nRegarding money, black cabs for years refused to take cards but thanks to Uber, they‚Äôve realised they need to step up and embrace modern practices.
UK is becoming a joke, London doesn't have 24/7 public transport and now they remove the only affordable choice for night transport.
a lot of you aren't women who have got in ubers by themselves
Totally crazy to restrict consumers choice. If Uber is 'Unfit' then shouldn't 'Black Cabs' also be 'Unfit' to run a taxi service????? They make it sound there are no rape cases with black cab drivers when in fact on average is reported at least twice a month for sexual assaults. There are a lot of rape cases with black cabs so how on earth are they 'fit' to run a service and not Uber? Do they mean Uber has not been extended it's license because black cabs are 'Threatened' by an innovative business? I've had such bad experiences with Black Cab drivers, it is beyond unacceptable. In fact, I will find the video to post it on youtube as I recorded this on video- a black cab driver almost hit me & my bf, then he puts the window down to shout and swear at us, then he got out of his car to punch my bf just because he shouted back how unfitly the driver was driving. And there are many more stories to tell.. So are black cabs really 'Safe & Fit' to provide a service??? Some people cannot afford to use a black cab. And ever since Uber's existence, women feel safer to go out in the evenings because they know they can get home using uber as is much more affordable for everyone in London. If there is no Uber, I'm sure there will be more rape cases in the streets of London... Thanks to the selfishness and profit driven black cab shitty services who's been constantly protesting to take Uber down
Uber will do something, they can't just let UK money go..
Well Shit

Uber deserves to get fucked.
Brexit Uber. Just shows England is winning the war against terrorism. Great decision!!!!!! üëèüëèüëèüëè
I think Uber is one of the most safest transport services in London because you get the drivers name, picture, license plate number AND you get to share trips with your friends. This is just another ploy for TFL to get more money out of us... leaving 40 THOUSAND people jobless and us Londoners paying more money just to get around an already expensive city.
I think Uber is the best and cheaper than others black cabs .uber need to stay in the UK . Especially is safe for Young people uber is the best.
In all honesty as a young person I hate this. Every other taxi service in England costs an absolute fortune especially on a Friday Saturday night out Uber has saved me countless times both financially and in emergencies calling regular taxis takes too long for them to arrive and they charge double what uber would charge I have lived in London all my life and the city is going down the toilet
Uber is the wild west of taxi cabbing
Why are people loosing it? Can‚Äôt you just call another taxi?
Someone at TFL just got a big brown envelope from the unions running the black cabs that rip us all off for double the price of UBER. So a win for the unions and the little guy gets F%$&ed again! :( and they wonder why the average guy thinks that organisations like TFL are just out of touch!

Sad that this is what most rap and music has become. You don‚Äôt need any talent, just a lot of money so you can get someone to write you lyrics and make a beat.
Music really is dying, We've got all sorts of great inspirations dropping like rain here courtesy of Chris Cornell, David Bowie and Chester Bennington. And now we have delinquents like this bitch getting famous making...This.

You have to admit she rap better than TS

My God My Lord! Why have you forsaken me
I honestly think she doesn't know how to spell these words
I'm sorry to say but she does sound bad!  Plus she is pretty . She won . Unfortunately this is the generation of music and behavior it's coming down too
I forgot what she even did In the first place

WHAT AN AMAZING SONG!!!!!!!!!\nCANT WAIT FOR THE ENGLISH VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She's not singing she's just talking with some weak beats....
Get mad all you want folks. This young lady is playing the classic heel and getting paid for it.
It's a porsche, not a porsch.
Video is just stolen from 'can I get a witness'
Thanks Dr.Phil look at what you have created.
She literally got famous from being disrespectful... H O W ? ! ?
She doesn't deserve her fame either, it makes me mad that there could be so much potential in someone but the world chose her instead.
This #12 Of Trending. Tbh it was kinda lit.
Hook was decent. She is taking full advantage of her opportunities. Can't event hate
I can't tell what's worse, this or Jake Paul's video...
This video is literally a landfill because it just garbage stacked on top of garbage
Too heavy on the base there bich
Not understanding the outrage when she is just mirroring what's popular in hip-hop at the moment. At least you know her blaccent is not fake. By today's standards...ignorance is common sense and censorships the norm. Like our POTUS, this is your fault America...accept it and move on.
i'm not biased.. this some good shit.
I need to say something stupid on Dr. Phil
I love this so much
What is the meaning of this?
Girl version of lil pump

So I assume the cure for cancer is still in search
Thumbnail of the video shows where she will end up in the future.
You know what?! You guys would actually not talk shit about these songs if someone else was rapping/singing... She's got potential and talent. If this was anyone else, you guys would be commenting differently. Ya'll just jealous. She sounds good and these beats are dope.
Slowly lose interest faith in humanity not fucking kidding
Disliked for the sake of humanity
All the people in the comment section are in denial because this song is actually catchy. Y'all just mad because it's Daniela's song.
Everyday I question why she has fans.
She really do look like lenny the shark
Why does this video even have likes? Is she using bots?
Trash
Sounds bad even with autotune. BITCH

Ghost in the shell flopped cause of whitewashing
C'mon people this looks awful, be reasonable!
Watch Fantastic Mr fox from this director before this movie. U wil absolutely love it.
Doesn't come out until MARCH?? Are you kidding me??
Thank you Wes Anderson for being living proof that the most out of touch, patronizing racism originates from the liberal camp 
... Is this strange that this animation scares me?????
this looks cute. I think I'd watch this.
I want to live in Wes Anderson's brain.
this reminds me of fantastic mr fox and i liked that movie cause it was good, but it freaked me out, and i can tell this is going to do that same
Anyone know what song is playing?
I knew as soon as I saw the animation style it was by the same guy that made 'The Fantastic Mr.Fox'!!! <3 (That guy-being Wes Anderson)
This is what im here for
Is this trailer showing the end of the movie?
This reminds me of mr fantastic fox so much
This reminds me so much of fantastic mr fox!
I'm having a hard time figuring out who the target audience is. It looks like an adult cartoon, but at the same time, it doesn't look like they are going for an R rating. PG-13? I really can't tell.
Goddamn i can't wait for this movie so BORK BORK BORK
This looks fantastic doesn't it MR Fox?
Looks like a great movie! Good thing I don't need to go to a theatre and spend $30 because I saw it all in this trailer :)
you had me at Wes Anderson
He's a 12 year old boy. Dogs love those.
THIS IS SO REMINISCENT OF FANTASTIC MR FOX OMGGGG
Totally going to see this, was a huge fan of the style and story of Fantastic Mr Fox!
Isle of puppers sign me up
New season of Robot Chicken looks great!
Wes Anderson solidifying his reign as king of the furries.\n\n(Nothing against furries).
Why don't they just eat them all
I love these types of movies :D
This reminds me of Mr.fantastic fox
Nope, nope nope nope. I have a phobia of stop motion and claymation so nope
Anyone else not gonna notice that Chief is a chimera? Or at least I believe that's the name.\nHis coat changed from black to white, at the beginning-ish he has white spots and becomes progressively whiter.\nOr, that is just a completely different dog in general.
This is it and I'll watch for sure
Super intresting! I might watch it.
I've never been this excited to see a movie
Those japanese dogs sure have japanese names.
Save soldier Ryan remake is not what i tought it would be like.
Bryan Cranston sounds like George Clooney for some reason.
wow that looks pretty cool can't wait to see it. but I thought the Japanese didn't like whales and dolphins oops I mean cows or chickens..  who knew.
Hey, that's a dog shampoo I use. good stuff
Wait, what's a 12 year old boy doing flying a plane like that in the first place? Where are the adult pilots- oh wait, it's Japan.
I saw the thumbnail and immediately thought of Fantastic Mr. Fox
Well I'm having nightmares tonight
The thumbnail of the video scared me, but this truly looks amazing
If this was a real depiction of a dog disease, that island would be full of dogs fucking and eating each other.
I am so exited for this movie! Fantastic Mr fox is one of my favorite movies.  Also this is five days before my birthday!
this is the most beautiful stop motion what in the heck i cant wait
Silly me, I thought this was the one written by Patricia Cornwell.
Ok, off to watch Fantastic Mr. Fox for the 800th time.  C ya in March.
Can someone please link me the song at 1:19 because I want to listen to it so much
I don't think there is a way I wouldn't watch this. Beautiful animation. Dogs. Interesting plot. Dogs. Well made. Dogs. Etc.
i‚Äôm so excited for this!
I've watched this trailer so many times already...I'm so excited for this.
I have no idea what just happened
The music sells this movie so brilliantly
Those people look so scary not because thier asian
honestly from this trailer it looks a lot like the movie of Fantastic Mr. Fox.
I WANT TO WATCH THIS SOOO DAMN BAD BRO
I think I could have guessed the director if I hadn't been told.
Im watching just cause i know how much time was put into this
I wish somebody spoke his language XD
Just by the stop motion style and way the characters act, I can tell this is being made be the same people that made Fantastic Mr. Fox
*in head* Isle of Dogs\n*out loud* I Love Dogs\nOH!
Why I want to see this:\n1) Dogs\n2) The animation\n3) These people made The Fantastic Mr. Fox which is one of my favorite movies and I'd trust them with my life if I needed to.
Bryan Cranston voices a dog named Chief? And he takes charge in the pack? This is too beautiful!
This animation is just like fantastic Mr fox ü§îü§îü§î
o this looks so good
OKAY CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW YOKO ONO IS PART OF THIS MOVIE
Fuck me. This is so cooool.
0:55 XJ-7...... 50\nMe: I swear if you said XJ-77 (adventure time)
I'm digging the retro clay animation. I bet this will be a good one.
White peoples obsession with animals is getting really annoying & sickening now.

next thing you know there's going to be a leak of a dog forced into water and everyone's going to hate the film makers.
People always worked up on how other people use their money. BRUH!! It's not your money!
I know it‚Äôs not really my place to say but, Eduardo really needs to know that he can‚Äôt get everything that Emilia has and giving him a pound when Emilia lost her tooth, that could take away that specialness of the tooth fairy coming. Yeah I know Jonathan said that he would get upset if he didn‚Äôt get one but  I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right. No hate though! I still LOVE you guys so much üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ
Poor Emilia, must be confusing to a 5 year old, you are the one that lost a tooth, your first tooth!!  That is the only reason why the tooth fairy is coming is because a tooth was lost and yet your little brother gets a coin too for not losing a tooth. You can see it on her sweet adorable face, confusion. She doesn't get it. Meanwhile Eduardo gets a coin for no reason at all, which should be confusing to him as well and probably was, then excitement took over. So I guess confusing the child who lost the tooth and thought it was about her won over letting a child who didn't lose a tooth wait for his time/day. Which is probably not at all how it was explained to Emilia when she was first told about the Tooth Fairy. She is so smart and observant, this undermines trusting what you are told.
Anna honestly don't listen to the negative, I know it's easier said than done but as parents we do our absolute best for our little people and that's all that matters, if no one has told you today; you're doing an awesome jobüíï positivity is easier to spread xx
Eduardo did not lose any teeth , he did not deserve money.. that's the whole thing about the tooth fairy, its for kids who lose their teeth.. they are just confusing him and his sister as Emilia knows that the tooth fairy gives money to kids that lose their teeth... i think they did it so he didn't feel left out, the same to when they give Eduardo a gift on Emilia's birthday. its not fair.. he just needs to learn that its not his birthday so he doesn't get gifts, he didn't lose teeth, so you get no money. and his time will come. its Emilia's special days not Eduardo , Eduardo got money but he didn't lose his tooth - Emilia lost a tooth, Eduardo gets a gift on his sister's birthday, its not his birthday its Emilia's birthday..
I'm curious why Alessia isn't in a crib yet, and why she isn't able to do what average babies her age are that I care for and have raised? She isn't pushing up on hands and knees, she cannot sit up alone, her stroller makes her lay down, can she even roll over? Itsn't my business maybe, but Is that just normal for Europe. Please no hate guys. I'm not a unicorn mom I promise.
Hey Anna, About the breast milk: it contains all sorts of good stuff for your baby ;)\nImmunoglobulins, which are compounds that 'catch' foreign substances in your body, but also good bacteria from YOU. Through these compounds you can make your baby more resistant to diseases you're also resistant agains at the moment. ;) Jus thought I'd share this. Thought you might find it interesting^^
I think 6 is a good year to have your first sleepover
Anna don't worry about the keyboard warriors! You and Jonathan are amazing and the fact your children are SOooooo happy proves that! Xxx
i know you guys can parent how you like to,i just feel as though giving a coin to eduardo aswell took away that special moment for emilia, and gives eduardo the impression that he will receive something from the tooth fairy aswell when emilia looses another tooth. i just dont think that type of milestone should be taken away from emilia or eduardo now that he has already received something from the tooth fairy, when it wasnt his tooth. \n\nsorry if this sounds mean, thats not my intention. just sharing my thoughts on the situation. x
When babies have cold symptoms and runny poop is usually means they could be teeting so that's why it's seems like their getting sick but notüòå
I love you guys, I really do. But I honestly feel bad for Emilia. It was HER tooth, HER special moment, not Eduardo's. I am sure she will not get a coin when Eduardo looses his first tooth. I think Eduardo should understand that he can't get everything Emilia gets all the time, she has her moments and he has his moments. It is SO unfair for Emilia.
So sweet!!! ¬†UH, OH!!! ¬†I think that Eduardo is in a bit of trouble!!! ¬† XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA
I absolutely love watching your videos and honestly I hate even partially scrolling down the comments section because 90% of it is teenagers thinking they know everything about parenting and telling you both how to look after your kids and it makes me so annoyed. Don‚Äôt feel like you have to justify yourselves to those people, clearly you‚Äôve raised 2 beautiful kids and are about to raise another so everyone else‚Äôs opinion is irrelevant xxxxx

Bloody Eduardo aye
Hey guys!
Okay,  I just have to say...  You really should consider what people are commenting about Eduardo.  I never go out of my way to write a negative comment but this is really bothering me, as well as a lot of other people I've noticed after reading their well-meaning comments.  Eduardo really does seem to be becoming spoiled rotten.  It's getting really hard to watch these videos anymore because I cannot stand to watch his bad behavior.  And then seeing him always get unnecessary rewards like him getting a coin for Emilia's lost tooth.   I felt so bad for Emilia,  you really could see the confusion on her face,  and the smugness on Eduardo's.  I wonder what she thought when he got a coin as well, which you are only supposed to get for losing your own tooth, which he did not.  You just didn't want him to get upset.   I'm sorry but what is that?  What is that teaching him?  I really pray that you stop allowing this to continue and that it doesn't come back to bite you (or others) in the future.  Yes he is little now, but if nothing changes he's likely to become an arrogant adult, manipulating everybody in his life,  because he wasn't taught properly as a child.  There's already enough of those people in this world and this is how it all starts.   It just infuriates me.  And it might do you good to consider why an overwhelming amount of people are noticing and commenting the same things, instead of calling them crazy.   It's of true concern.  You're no better than the rest of us.
Eduardo, you are going to have to live in someone else's house...lol! OMG, the throw...and worse, the ruin of the Modern Renaissance Palette. Please let us see/hear about Anna's reaction!!! Hilarious!!!!
Anna don't worry about what people say. My first child was weened on everything organic and fresh, my second, mostly wotsits and magnums!  Don't sweat it! You do you!
Mommy loves this throw more than mommy loves daddy. - I laughed out loud with this one. ü§£
Yep, explosiones and situaciones are actual words in Spanish and you're using them perfectly Anna üòÇ
I would've loved to see Anna's reaction to Eduardo's art! Lol
Hahaha Eduardo you are going to have to go live in someone else's house! Bahahaha my stomach hurts from laughing so much. This vlog was wonderful, but I wish we could have seen Anna's reaction to the throw Situationes
When I saw the modern renaissance pallet something in me died I swear then he opened it and I thought oh know Eduardo you're dead ahahaha
Beautiful, thank you for sharing
It's so sad that people try to bring your family down. Of course you don't vlog every minute of your life.
Dear Scallywag can you please flag me so I don't see your videos coming up in my feed. Reason being, I have no interest in your videos. Thanks üëç

I liked the video!
Yes! ‚ÄúSituaci√≥n‚Äù is situation in Spanish ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Jonathan, I laughed out loud when you told Wardo he'd have to live somewhere else... mommy loves that throw more than she loves daddy.... so funny. I cringed as you pulled the wipe to clean. Vacuum it next time lol coz you know there's gonna be a nest time. Too funny.
That dog in the car looked ridiculous!!
Put some shaving cream for the duvet. Rub it in first then throw in the washer.
Mummy loves this throw more than she loves daddy üòÇ amazing

Not the modern renaissance palette üò±üò±
Has Anna saw the make up mark on her throe blanket yet???? Love you videos xxxxx
You are the best parents everüíûand the kids are so adorable
As a makeup lover I had to pause the video when I saw the state of that Modern Renaissance palette, take a couple of deep breaths and swallow the tears before I could continue watching.
I've got makeup on a throw before and it was really hard to get off...‚ù§
ui hope that whereever eduardo lives now, he keeps us updated with vlogs.
I think Eduardo did a great make up look with the modern renesansse palette :D oh god I would be so sad if that happened to me but you know life happens and at the end of the day at least Eduardo had some fun and this is just some make up that can be repurchased  :)
It's so funny seeing people get worked up all over a fallen out tooth. PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT DUMBASSES.
Anna, you do an amazing job! All of you do including the children. I don't have children myself but I work in a very busy nursery (the baby room) I totally understand how hard it is especially like you said when 1 of them is screaming, fighting or crying. Don't let the haters get to you! Usually their more jealous of you and try to put you down because they don't like the fact that they can't cope and they can see you all can at times and are an amazing family... I watch your vlogs daily and I can see that you all have a bond like no other.. embrace the love and support and forget the low lifes..love you all xxx
Alessia was like just change my nappy already while Anna was talking to the camera!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I cringed when I saw Jonathan with these wet wipes on the throw smudging it all, brrr...
‚ÄúMommy loves this throw more than mommy loves Daddy‚Äù üòÇüòÇ I died
What happened with the bed did Anna go mad i know i would
The song at the beginning is so beautiful. Does anyone know the name of it?
I would love to have seen  Anna's  reaction to  Eduardo  destroying her   Make-up
This is so adorable i can't handle their cuteness <3
Not the modern renaissance palette! Ive never cringed so hard üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Not the Modern Renaissance palette D:
try not to cringe challenge while watching Jonathan try and get rid of the stain
My face though when Jonathan opened the eyeshadow pallet :0
OMG üò± How I wish to have a modern rainaissance palette üôà and then EDUARDO üòÅüòÅüòÅ‚ù§
Why doesn't this channel have more subs ü§ôüèΩü§ôüèΩü§ôüèΩ
Anna tell the haters to flip off and for all the haters anna is a amazing mum so back off we are so lucky we se their cogs they choose so yeh leave anna alone
https://youtu.be/2QE1vLUgGzk\nTry not to laugh
Why are they losing subscribers? they don't deserve it
Bless Emilia xx she's so cute and Eduardo xx
You guys are amazing.  wow this video made me tear up x
I was hoping to see Anna reaction to that make everywhere lol
These vlogs are so real, makes me love them even more:)
Emilia is so sweet. omg Eduardo with the makeup. Lol what a mess. Alessia is such a cutie. Obviously we don't see everything, I don't get why people think they know it all. Hope you are all having a good weekend. <3
Shame the limelight was taken away from Emilias moment by Eduardo - he will get his own moment one day. You use the words he will get upset far too much. He's going to find the real world very tough if he thinks he gets everything he wants constantly and is never disappointed. You can't protect them from that all the time sadly, if only you could.
both anna & jonathan are so amazing at engaging with their audience whilst talking to a camera! feels like they're standing right in front of me, comes so naturally to them ‚ù§Ô∏è
There was so much Anna sass in this vlog and I love it. You tell 'em, Anna. There are no perfect people out there. Also, my heart might have broken a little seeing what Eduardo did to the Modern Renaissance palette and Anna's throw. It might be time to teach that boy about brushes. üòÇ
Omg Anna Alessia is absolutely gorgeous so chilled a reflection of you for being such a good mum xxüíñ
I just love how people get all up in Anna's grill like they were invited to the barbeque. Mind your own business. Anna is doing a great job as a mother of three and both she and Jonathan are giving all three children the attention they need. \nIt's just that sometimes, a toddler needs a little more attention because they actually run around and could get in trouble, which a baby cannot do. I'm positive Anna knows what she's doing and does not need to justify her parenting.\nStay in school kids!
Who agrees Emilia probably has more money in her piggy bank than themselves hahah
oh my goodness, Alessia's smile melts my heart. It's quite possibly the most beautiful smile I've ever seen on a baby. (That is, ofcourse, until I have my own children haha) You two make lovely children. xo I think you're an awesome mum.
ANNA YOU DON'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY YOURSELF TO ANYONE. YOUR THE MUM YOU PARENT HOW YOU WANT TOO! YOUR AN AMAZING MOTHER.
No hate so dont attack people but i think bubs is too big for that bassinet her head always seems to be pushed up against it .
I wanted to see Anna's reaction to the bed situation after Eduardo got into her makeup.
eduardo makes me laugh so much ! he reminds me of what my brother was like when he was little
TOTALLY got your back! I was like that with my second üôà god knows how I will handle a 3rd...if it ever happens üò¨‚ù§Ô∏è
Alessia is soooo cute
14:21 OMG HOW IS SHE SO ADORABLE
AWWWWWWWWWWW THIS IS SO CUTEEEEEEEEE
OMG Anna's palette...............

omg so real and cute hahahahahaha
Omg Edwardooooo nooooooooooo!!!! Hahahahahahahah was laughing so much at the whole makeup situation ü§£üòÇ
I can only imagine what Anna's reaction was!!! üò∞üò±
My little boy is 5 months old and his been in 6-9 clothes for about a month now. He‚Äôs growing so quickly üòì
I love u I cried so mutch it's so cute

Mommy loves this throw more than mommy loves daddy üòÇüòÇ
I don't get why Eduardo got a coin from the tooth fairy? It wasn't his tooth? So will Emilia get one when Eduardo loses his first tooth? Very strange. Not a good way to each your kids that they can't have everything.

she called it the iphone X.. it‚Äôs iphone 10
Clickbait title, BS fashion reasons, iPhone sucks, Samsung is the best.\n\nTyping from my iPhone 7 red
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre messages are green! Not blue!‚Äù
Looking rather cute wearing those glasses Ms Justine.... I'm left handed as well but wear my watch on my left hand, Usually people will wear their watch on their dominant hand aka the hand they write with..... Always enjoy your vids :)
Your messages are GREEN! not BLUE!!!
So cute!!!! Good choice!!!!! Never thought about flipping the watch. Am a southpaw too.
The Belkin looks better for me
But Justine, Samsung has had wireless charging for years
yo what does justine do with all her apple products
*PUT* *YOUR* *LEFT* *HANDS* *UP!*
justine's color grading and exposure looks too bright on an old TN panel like mine, its painful to watch T_T
Lol, it's not really wireless when you still need to plug in the charging pad...
Yup there u go. Keep sucking on apple's cock.
Where did you get your necklace?
I‚Äôm left handed too! Omg I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who has people calling them out on having their Apple Watch upside down
I don‚Äôt get what the iPhone dock is supposed to do.
Now you have to choose between charging your phone, using your headphones, and using the home button
I came for the iPhone 8!!! Not just chargers!
Get out with your trash dogs
You have to be mentally ill to buy the regular 8 and not go for the x which is actually different
LOL AT 5:32 THATS ME TRYING TO ROAST PEOPLE
the background music sounded happy thru my Solo 3's
I feel like she gives really good head.
What if you stack wireless chargers on top faster charging? Sorry for my stupid question
It's just a faster iPhone 7
I like the belki one much more
U look so good in glasses

For some reason I want the iPhone8 and not X I don't know why though
you're so spoiled, and lucky, i'm jealous.
‚Äúyea well guess what your messages are greeeeenn NOT blue‚Äù me too justine lmaooüòÇ
Every time apple release a phone i came to this channel
Like the Apple event, these things are not impressing me. I'm not a fashionista so a new color to an otherwise bland case or watch band isn't going to merit my money. Wireless charging isn't for me. It's easy enough for me to plug stuff in when I want to charge it for an extended period of time (overnight). And it doesn't charge fast enough (<5 mins) when I want to get a quick charge up to go as I'm getting ready to head out.
Not a fan of those glasses on you. Your more square glasses, ‚ÄúI like them a lot‚Äù
You look like AJ from Aly and AJ
Look, this is iPhone 7. Wait... No, is not iPhone 7... It's the new iPhone 8! WOW! I m impressed!...

Did ya get it , im waiting Justine <3 HOW IS YOUR WHITE CASE HOLDING UP?? I picked up the Rose Red case, since I thought the Pink Sand case would get pretty dirty.
I‚Äôm a lefty also! I also have my watch on my right hand!!!!
i just got my new iphone 8 in gold today so i‚Äôm binge watching all justine‚Äôs iphone 8 videos
Dosnt matter if your left handed - watches are designed to wear on your left wrist.

What type of subscribers are you? She has over 4mil of y'all and you guys can't even get her 1mil views regularly? That's not even mentioning likes...\n\nThis is why it's disheartening being a Youtuber at times.

when you live in australia and the spiders eat birds..
YOU KNOW IT'S CLICKBAIT WHEN THE THUMBNAIL & INTRO DOESN'T HAVE BLOOD OR THE TITLE HAS A QUESTION MARK.
alright mark, now I'm gonna need you to slowly...calmly...agitate the hell out this spider!\n\nOh hell nah
Another reminder this fool has got BALLS. F that lol
My wife actually refers to her walking stick as my spider stick.
im glad theres non in the uk
This is just a damn orchard spider here in north america. orb weaver. people are so out of touch with nature. walked into a web bow hunting early season. unwittingly carried one around in my hat for half the day. no it doesn't bite.
Like &SUBSCRIBE  to our channel everyone!!! We will do the same!!! Stay BLESSED!!!
I‚Äôm not really scared of spiders, but my stomach was turning when that spider was crawling on your arm. It made me nervous
Of course a spider had to go missing in my room right before this video.
If I ever....ever see this spider....I'm running the opposite way üòÖüòÇ
hi, im coyote peterson and supposedly this insect can kill you with one bite, so today im going to see just how bad that bite must be.
All his videos end up being on trending lol wish i could fo that
Awsome
oh wow you got bitten by a spider,a snake,and stung a million times by bees??\n\nseem legit
6:39 the little spider in the corner got flung üòÇ
I‚Äôm about to throw up
I killed a fly and it landed in a spider web and the spider ate it and stared at me
come to Australia and you have one of these kinds of videos every day.
2:10 It kinda looks like the spider from the Spider-Man movie (2001)
Stop the intense music it makes me really nervous
Checking the comments to see if he is bitten before watching the video.
You are so brave and CRAZY
Oh look a skulltula from Zelda
only for spiders though
Why do I do this to myself
Here in Philippines we call it Gagambang Kuryente in English Electric Spider because you can see it in Antennas üòÅand its green in Philippines
Can u scash it after ur done with it. I wanna see whats inside that large abdomen...
Does anyone else want to see him get stung by it????
I just thought of how Coyote would react if he was ever in one of David Dobrik's blindfold prank. He'd just be so chill, start talking about it üòÇ
Strangely enough, coming from an aussie, that spider was tiny
5:32 Wanna hear a spider horror story?  When I was about 14 years old me and my friend were walking/ running threw the woods and my buddy ran straight into a spider web.  It surprised him so much he breathed in quickly and somehow inhaled the spider.  I didn't be leave him at first (never seen someone chug a Pepsi that fast trying to wash it down) it bit his throat multiple times and he had to go to the emergency room because his throat was closing up.  It was super scary for me I can only imagine how he felt.
Anything with 8 legs deserves to die.......
My fan is blowing and my hair moved and I jumped sooooo hardüò´üò´üò´
How do I get over arachnophobia??
That's the kind of spider I want, I've been wanting one for that past 3 years
When I watch things like this I just get very unsecured and feel scared and spiders I hate most so I look around a lot
I thought he'd turn into yellow spiderman.
I am not scared of spiders AT ALL. I‚Äôm not even kidding, I can just let crawl on my skin and not worry about anything. \n\n\nBut I am afraid of snakes. Ugh, those teeny tiny worms as well. I wonder what it‚Äôs called when your afraid of snakes/worms?
Dude says he wants to help us get over our fear of spiders, when every motherticking second of the video is *meticulously* engineered to make you more scared of spiders. And we see that very clearly.
You should also talk about wolf spiders, those are common around houses too
This song make me wanna bite a spider
animals only attack when they feel threaten or hungry or scared
Whenever I see a spider I go ahead and just get a flame thrower instead
1:23, how do you not hit the spiderwebs? xD
what a beautiful creature <3
I'm moving to Mars, anyone joining? I'm building a spaceship out of my fears
Crazy m-fer. I love your vids and hope you stay safe making them.
The spider would have died soon as i saw it it would have got drenched in raid
and im from belize
One of theses days you will be like the alligator man coyote
Is everyone going to ignore the fact that he's so handsome? üòç
That‚Äôs a banana spider
This dude is playing with his life

Seriously the way you have the music playing makes me more nervous than anything!
Why are most species usally females the bigger one and the males are smaller XD
So I trapped the spider right?
Banana Spiders are beautiful and numerous!  I have no fear of them, lol.
He is crazy I would not have the guts to do that and I want him to make a video of him working with a boa. comment if you agree
In the Philippines we play with Spyder

I heard they ate small birds and bats how crazy is that don't know if he ever noticed but that rhymed
These video titles are definitely losing quality _very_ quickly...
ok
Coyote bite by a crocodile
Wtf Danny sounds like an Angel and a Demon.
Fun song, but why is the video like a sin city promo video
This song is so fucking good
'The new album will be heavy' ..... where?
hate to say it but Denis took the band back to its metalcore roots but this song just sounds like post hardcore. i'd rather just listen to their Debut album instead. its way better anyway. imma go do that right now
THEY ARE ON THE TRENDING PAGE
The best  song ever <3
Asking Alexandria about to make a comeback from hell üî•üî•üî•
hmm. different but i like it. better than danny's last record w them so im happy
Danny back in the rows = big time
The AA Family is finally back!!
I think Danny just ruined the sound of AA. Yes. I said Danny, not Denis. Danny made the whole band change it's direction, so he (Danny) would stay in AA.
What is this... asking Taylor swift to the danceia nonesense.
Danny you name Asking Alexandria what it is. Without you there is no Asking Alexandria. Thank you for coming back
I like the Worsnop voice than Shaforostov voice, Worsnop is better, it's mature than Dennis
I'll be there in the morning with a smile on my face ass boy
Not a fan of this type of music, but mad respects to homaging Sin City. like the cinematography is pretty brilliant
They're still around? I remember when I first heard their alesana collab
Does the noise of car machine also happen on the original audio track?
asking back to alexandria ..
This slaps so hard. \nFuck that last dude.
This is so much better than The Black! But... I don't like the video concept... It was slightly distressing seeing the band members dying. :o
Danny destroyed the band so white Coated Danny had to stop him before he killed himself aswell
wow didn't realise danny was back man did i miss his voice
*Any AA's songs that'll be great  for a potential a fan (like myself) because damn, this song is amazing!! I'd only listen to AA once (listened to The Black and wasn't really a fan of it) and didn't bother to do more research on them. But now I really want to get into them! The singer's voice (Danny right?) voice is so unique and powerful that I'm simply blown away by his vocal skills. This song is amazing and raw and I'm glad that It's trending (It's pretty rare when a metal rock/any rock genre trend in the U.S). Anyway, sorry for the long paragraph and hope y'all have a nice day* üòÄüòÄ
my brother listen this music and reggaeton, is that correct?
ohhh shit , i need more of this ,thanks for came back Worsnop
wow he can really use his voice. incredible!
Dude honestly this is so fucking good! I never really liked AA but the way they evolved is so good, you are on the right track my dudes, keep it up! Solid release!
This band has grown so much in the past decade
THE N√ú METAL IS\nBACK !
What is the opening line? Sounds like Take your mouth back. The lyrics on AZ lyrics don't sound right.
I really knew this single will be so good! Danny is better than ever. They rule the scene and you know it. They grow bigger and bigger everyday. And this is just a song, the whole album will be amazing I think.. welcome back Danny :)
Welcome back Danny! This video, in my opinion, is about Danny watching himself turn into something he's not. He is hurting everyone around him and he hates himself for it. I like the Sin City vibe. Keep rocking on ü§ò
damn danny how u gonna leave ben on the floor like that. i'd atleast give him a beer before he goes. damn. selfish much
This video remind anyone else of Assassins Creed Revelations?
HOLY FUCKIN SHIT YES!! they have to drop at least one more single cause i cant wait 3 months for the album
This song is FIREüî•üî•üî•üî•
Was not expecting this
I think this music is supposed to show how the band felt after Danny worsnop left just my opinion
This isn't so bad at all, but it would have been so epic if they had went back to their roots üò©
GOD DAMMIT STOP BEING SUCH A BEAST, DANNY.
I've loved these guys sense 2013, I've loved everything they've ever made, even with Denis, but this HAS to be one of the saddest  music videos ever fucking made..I absolutely love it to death! I can't begin to explain it! üíïüíïüíïüíï
2011: Danny, Danny where the fuck are you? Danny, DAnny, DANNY! \n2017: Ben ben ben ben ben ben wtf have the evil me done
Bring on the new We Are Harlot. This is just ok
Cheesy video, but still more realistic than fast and furious
Ford's are crown killers
This song gives me strength
What is better than tea and the new single of AA in the morning
Fucking sucks... shows they gave into Danny's radio rock sound.
ALSO THE SONG IS FUCKING SICK!
Anyome else get a sin city vibe with how the video is done?
So we can assume Danny and Ben made up?
the one whos on the exploded car is the former vocalist, oops sorry
I love it and i love this new path . Sounds clean , lyrics on point danny looking good ;) lol i see a better family stronger band . alot of people have to also understand that screamo is puts a toll om youre voice in fast time . Reason why i didnt start a band because i know it will hurt my voice badly . The way i was looking at this thing with AA is danny needed a break test his voice again on his own try new thing's . At the end their back. What got me pissed is dense walking out i wont lie but i liked the guys voice but i guess he chocked .\nPast is the past time to move forward
Btw, good to see you Danny.üôÇ
I listened to this over and over after I first heard it. I‚Äôm fucking addicted. I missed you, Danny omfg welcome back!
People change. Let that simple fact sink in for a minute. Got it? Okay moving on. If you keep making the same sounding music for years nothing will stand out and I don't know about you but me personally I like to see bands grow and evolve and try new things. I know some are afraid of change and hate it when their favorite bands try something out, I mean, god forbid right? Sarcasm. Sometimes you gotta quit being scared that something new won't be good because you don't know unless you try. These guys are passionate and put everything they've got into their music and I applaud them for doing so. Oh and by the way, you really need to stop comparing Denis and Danny, they both are talented musicians who have left their marks on AA and have given us something worthwhile to listen to.
For some reason it reminds me of sin city
Why does Danny look like Jack Black? ü§î
I HEADBAND TO THIS BAND WHEN I WAS 1!!!!!
It brings a tear to my eye knowing your back Danny n this song was fantastic glad to see that fuck boy Denis gone anytime the black album came on it made me sick
lost me the second I heard the shitty generic ooohhhhhhhh pop thing, this sound sucks and bands need to stop copying it
This is honestly so amazing. I loved it.  I had stopped listening to them for a while but I'm glad I started listening to then again especially now that Danny is back. Not that I didn't like it when Denis was part of AA but I liked Danny way more ‚ù§
This is amazing!!!!!
Danny's backüò≠üò≠üòçüòçüòç

OMG! Love your hair!
Wtf
You look nice
Hi jrffestar i am your huge fan
do u ship to brazil?
Love this look on you!
You look like an exotic beautiful mermaidüî•
This look reminds me so much of old school jeffree. I love it.
you look like you keep getting thrown into a trash can and keep crawling out looking more and more like smeagle with a wig
I can't wait for the minis!! Will it be limited edition?
ofc your friends are only there to help you pronounce shade names on lipsticks lmaoo
She must be on the rag.
To all the haters coming in new to this channel from the trending page, Jeffree star is NOT transgender, he‚Äôs just a male who does makeup tutorials on YouTube and he‚Äôs been on the internet since the early days of MySpace lol! He‚Äôs not trying to shove any sjw, anti-trump, anti-white people, black lives matter, transgender propaganda down your fucking throat! He literally just do makeup tutorials! Nothing about trump, politics or transgenderism!
OMG THIS WAS UPLOADED ON MY BIRTHDAY ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm living for this look
There are literally like 25 omg the comments are so hateful to every actual negative comment. You young kids have mastered the art of perpetual victimhood, haven't you?
I am living for the hair and the make up!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have to say, as a straight male. All the hate on this video is sickening. Does it make all your insecurities feel better when you type out all that hate? SHE has more drive and passion for what she is doing then 99% of you in any aspect of your life. You can learn something if you would stop being so closed minded about other people in this world. Grow as a person and appreciate everybody. What fun would life be if everybody was the same.
You look like a clown, and a guy
Why does YouTube allow creatures to trend,...hideous man women creature
Think I'm in the deep web
OMG I'm loving this hair color!
You know how you meant it you fucking degenerate
I made the mistake of scrolling too far and read some of the nastiest hate comments I've ever seen. People really want to kill someone just for being different. Wtf.
His mouth is tired but when he swatches all his summer collection.. gurrllllllllllüòÇ
I Heard You Say 7 Lippies ! Then corrected to 8 ! üòÇ Still LOVE YA THO !

Jeffree can you please review the new lip countour lipsticks cause im not buying it before I hear your oppinion
That's a fuckin dude. Wtf.\n\n\n\n\nAlso kill it with FIRE, LOTS AND LOTS OF FIRE. maybe even a few nukes.
That thing up there (or to your side if your not mobile) looks like a fucked up super saiyan blue. This is why gohan decided not to try getting this shit, i bet this is what he would turn into.
throughout my many years of experience, people like this man woman thing don't want to be told how to live, even though the bible clearly states that this kind of shit is wrong. We're all sinners, but there's a very clear line with this and if you don't see this person as evil and disturbing then there's something wrong with you, because THIS isn't normal and this isn't how we as men are supposed to function in society. Also to educate you, the aids virus is primarily transmitted through gays and transexuals, a disease which has destroyed many people, and families lives. Here's a scenario for you, a bisexual man unknowingly has sex with a man that has aids. then, without telling the next girl he's about to have sex with that he's bisexual, he gives an innocent girl aids when she could have just been trying to find the love of her life. Bisexual man never speaks to girl again. And in the quest for a new love, this girl eventually has sex with someone else a few months down the line with someone she's fallen in love with. She now has a broken heart and accidentally ruined another man's life. The girl now battles depression and (for the sake of my story) commits suicide because her life is ruined. These types of things that I just described happen every single day and it's a sad reality. People need to wake up and stop being blinded by the media telling you it's all okay to do these things...and how much damage it can actually do to people. With a disease like aids you would think the world would wake up even more. But something is really wrong with our society right now where people think it's okay to do this or act like this guy when 9 years ago it was a completely different world. This shit doesn't happen in Europe either.
i wanna curb stomp this waste of human life
We now have the same hair color! ¬†I've been rocking that blue for months. ¬†LOVE it on you!
People are talking about people hating on Jeffree, but I can't see it üíÄ
It would definitely be great for you to create a permanent bundle deal that has a lipstick and a matching liner .
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this hair honey.. the hair, the brows, THE WHOLE LOOK
Oh Jeffree I came here cuz I thought for sure you'd have a review on the Boscia Charcoal Jelly Ball Cleanser.  If you see one in Sephora can you please do a review?  Thank you gorgeous!
OMFG Your Hair Is So Beautiful I Miss My Blue Hair
What was the price of the last one??
I AM LIVING FOR THIS LOOK FUCK IT UP BOO üê¨üê¨üê¨üíóüíó

im LIVING for his hair, eyebrows, and eye makeupüò´üòç
The real question is... what would my boi Donald do, to HIM????
He/she is a nice person but wtf is that look it's scary
Idk wtf everyone's problem is. His reviews are on point. He is very informative and thorough. I really enjoy watching him and his videos. Yes, His face is masculine for makeup but that's not a bad thing it's just different for people who aren't used to it. His makeup style is from what Ive seen always flawless and he knows how to rock the shit outta it. He is definitely bold, and doesn't give a fuck what you pricks think and I admire that. I never thought when I heard his music back then that I'd be sitting here watching him do tutorials and reviews but damn girl I'm soooo happy he does! I've never had the opportunity to try your products but I hear they're pretty damn amazing and can't wait till someday I can! Keep working it!!!
He reminds me of a marilyn manson mixed with chris motionless from motionless in white band!üçí üéÄüíÄüéÄüçí
What the actual fuck did I just find. Fucking lizard people are real holy shit
If you actually watch this shit then you need to go to the doctor
you better work!!
You a trans?

Yesss...a rockstar mermaid!!  I LOVE that hair color üòç!
I love how people can't stand to let people live their life how they want. Is it your life? Is Jeffree hurting you in any way? No? Then shut the fuck up.
I'm a straight male (AKA in the closet) and this look pushed my artistic ass to try make up
God I wish I was your dog sitter :') I love poms!
I need to go but some smash box omg
You look like a 6th grade desk
Alright you gotta tell me what you used for those brows!!!

Why the fuck did they recommend this for me? I mean I know I watched the video of the dog trying to fuck the cat but that didn't mean I was hungry for more weird ass shit.
Why is this trending and who watches this garbage?
Testing makeup is #17 on trending.  This is sad
Scary shit... I dont hate people with mental disorders but damn....suicide is in your future...
I know I'm all disgusting and lovey dovey but gimme a break HE'S THE CHANDLER TO MY MONICA, PEOPLE! Also I just wanna say - *TRIGGER WARNING* for a section in this video discussing sexual assault, something discussed in my book...as soon as I get asked about what was the hardest thing to write about maybe skip ahead if you don't want to hear about that kind of stuff. Really missed you guys, thanks for dealing with less videos for a while as I worked on the short film and got through the book launch and then went on my holidays! BACK BABY xxx

My bisexeual self fancies you and your boyfriend. Gorgeous and *iconic* couple xo
ya fantasy is my JAM
After literally holding my sister's hand when she was dying of cancer last year and the trauma that came with it (plus I'm an ACoA) I went to therapy. My uni has free counselling (üíö). After six months of tough work (coz therapy ain't easy!) I finally got better. For THE FIRST TIME in my life I feel like I am myself. The Marika I was supposed to be all the time, had I not suffered from depression. It's like Is this how other people feel ALL THE TIME for most of their lives?. I couldn't believe it. I hate the thought of having a bad mental health day. I discovered alcohol is my big trigger so I just stopped drinking altogether. And fell in love with the gym. Started lifting weights, it's like a I've got  proof of getting stronger- physically and emotionally. And now I am a proud member of Aberdeen University Weightlifting Club too üèãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíö I am a big advocate of spreading mental health awareness and I'm very open about me getting help. Coz it's normal, you're ill- you get a treatment, let it be therapy or medication. THERAPY IS GOLD, your uni, college, school or GP WILL have some sort of mental health support. I can't thank my therapist enough, I was in a very very dark place for years. Love from Aberdeen, Melanie üíö
Oh wow please write some YA fantasy!!  I'm 27 but still so in love with this genre  üòÑ it's always a perfect escape when adulting is too much...
okay. okay I think I have caught my breath. Your boyfriend is absolutely GORGEOUS you are both so attractive I need to see the babies! But for real...I really hope you talk more about long distance stuff and maybe vlog with him he looks so sweet and this whole story is like a romantic movie!!!!!!!!!! he is so lucky xxxxxxxx
Your hair is so gorgous üò≠ You inspired me to chop mine short!
yes please! write fantasy <3
I understand that what happened to you was horrible and I am so sorry that you ever had to go through that - but as a person of foreign ethnicity living in Ireland for nearly 2 decades and having been bullied and prejudiced my whole life for being different, the fact that you specified that the two men were Polish had me taken aback. I love you Melanie, and I've been a fan of yours for a long time, but I do not see why you had to say that. If they were black, and you would have said these two black men... there would be an uproar, I don't see why specifying that they were of Polish descent was necessary. They're scum of the earth because they're scum of the earth, not because they're Polish.
What's the difference between a pilot and a neurosurgeon?\nThe neurosurgeon doesn't think they're a pilot!\n\n(I dated a commercial pilot back when I was far too young to be dating someone like that haha so the joke comes from a place of experience and love. They tend to be verrrrrry interesting people I'll give ya that! And nothing like that uniform and the feeling of flying in the Boeing 747 you're partner is literally driving haha MMMMM ENJOY THE RIDE MEL)
Girl! Giirrrll! YEESSSS! enjoy all the fabulous feelings. So so happy for you :) xx
I would love to see a fantasy book with bisexual characters! Haven't gotten to read your book yet but is on my to do list, but I love your creativity and would love to see that type of creativity in fiction!

Im happy for you having a boyfriend !!
Congrats on new bf!! Also, food video please! üíöüíöüíöüíö Love ya Mel!!!
Rape and the way people see it like oh you'll get over it üôÑ makes me very anxious and i feel like i really can't trust guys since you can't really tell witch one is a rapist or not..i just wish i could be gay üòï
i went cruelty free, it sucks that more brands don't fall under that category i.e. benefit
Hey Melanie, I'm a university student on a budget looking to treat myself to a medium coverage bb cream- something really easy to wear and uncomplicated. What would you recommend? also I live for these chatty videos as its my first year at uni and I still haven't managed to make any friends yet :( the way you talk reminds me of listening to one of my own friends chat with me- so honest and comforting. Wishing you all the blessings xxx
You seem very well atm I am so happy for you!!! Xxx
Can I date u? Plz? ;u;
that new man of yours is GORGAWS. just like you ;)
About open mindedness and perceptions of others bodies: youtube has made me an even more accepting person and I believe that as long as someone is happy and healthy both mentally and physically then it's definitely none of your business. I was watching some Strictly Come Dancing with my family tonight (first episode of new series) and my dad would not stop making disrespectful comments that he thought were hilarious. It was after a dance done by Chizzy (actress from Holby City I think). She is a beautiful, but larger lady with a very full bust and he made sure to point this out-oh she's the larger one of this series (usually there is a 'larger' woman on each series, I guess for 'body diversity') every time she moved my dad would laugh and after the dance, she ran up the stairs. I was genuinely furious with the way my dad was acting-there are bits flying in all directions!  Also Darcey Bussell (she is a judge on the show and also a family friend) commented on her dance, saying that she has a natural boogie in her body. However of course my father takes no time to think she was about to say something else steady on Darcey! Also on this series there is a gay female comedian contest and a gay male (priest?) contestant. Upon hearing that she has a wife he acts all confused and surprised-just really irritatingly ignorant even though we have family friends who are gay and happily married and I went to Pride this year and he kept complementing me on my outfit and asking how the day was. When the (gay) man had finished dancing-Craig Revell Horward (a quite camp judge who I don't think is actually gay but I'm not 100% sure-he has a wife but he could be bi) commented on his dance saying I LIKE you dahhling (he is the strict judge so this meant a lot) but again my dad makes a snide comment-in what way?! I actually wanted to scream and make such a scene but I know I couldn't-I'm angry with myself for not saying anything. He's not even a horrible judgemental person or homophobic usually. Also, last week I was watching a dating show called Naked Attraction. The contestant was a pan girl and in the lineup there was a trans man and trans woman (neither had fully transitioned yet) and my sister and dad kept saying I'm getting so confused now, what's going on? Are they a man or a woman? Even though the host was clearly stating male/female pronouns for the corresponding person and their faces and hair styles reflect the normal gender stereotypes of society. Any ideas how I can subtlety convince them that how judgemental they are being is wrong? I have said multiple times to my family that they should be so judgemental but then they just got angry at me for 'bossing them around' and for judging THEM!!! (Extra info: I'm not straight, my sister knows and so does my mum but they seem to have ignored/forgotten or not believe it, and my dad knows about my interest in and support for the LGBTQ+ community-he even told me about how his workplace had won an award for 'acceptance within the workplace' or something.)
Please do a video on intuitive eating!!
Melanie the fact that it almost happened to you must have been scary as hell . I am so sorry , and I'm very glad that those people passed by when they did . Ugh , I don't know what to say, sorry you went through that.
I'd read that fiction book over and over üôãüèº
im also in a long-distance relationship def hard but its all worth it id say :)
Hi Melanie, Im glad you had a good break :) I love this video as always, I have recently entered into a long distance relationship and it is so reassuring to know that other people can make it work. Also your openness is inspiring <3 xxx
Sooo another subject.....Yeah!!You're a great writer so.... Maybe you could write novels, I think that would be great. Anyways, keep being yourself, and share your experience! You are a great model to many people¬°
The new man is just Gaawww-geous! Congrats on your happiness!
Just want to say I'm more muscular and talented and better looking than your man, and I donate all my time and money to non- profits, so can we date now?! Just kidding, So happy that you are extra happy. Thanks for being a role model to deal with life, you always give solid honest opinions. This was a great video!! Wish you the best 5/10/100 year plan!
loved this video sm Mel! You are just so honest about everything and I really appreciate it! I seriously can't wait to read your book because I know it will basically be like watching one of your videos!
Congrats Mel üíö I'm delighted for you! ‚ò∫üíìüíìüíì
Usually when I watch YT videos I'm pretty straight-faced, but whilst watching this I actually found myself sustaining a smile for ages (I noticed because my cheeks started to hurt lol). So happy to hear the lovely news ^_^ at the same time... Bloody shut up about being gross and lovey dovey. If you want to be gross and mushy, then you bloody be gross and mushy :P\n\nAnother great video, love your Q&As :) xxxxxx
An intuitive eating video would be so helpful üíúüíú
Honestly what a brave and strong  girl ! Go you. Need more open and honest videos like this spreading awareness on these topics. You seem to have awful things happen to you but yet you're so strong and funny and beautiful! Was glued to this video and really good advice for anyone . Hope it all works out for you with your man Melanie. Best of luck xx
I'm so happy for you melanie and you man! Right now my best friend is dating the guy I really like the only guy who I've liked and didn't have shitty personality and cares a lot about people but even more about her he never stops talking about her (CHIPPY'S not chippers) but if you guys go farrrrr then I support you all the way like support my  boycrushfriend and best friendüíöüíöüíö

Oh my god, your boyfriend is gorgeous! You look wonderful together.
My best friend has just been diagnosed with anorexia and although I understand that what she is going thru is 10000x worse than what I am. I am really struggling. I constantly feel so helpless cuz Ik nothing I can say or do will make her better. Any advice ?
Melanie when are you going to do a meet up? You are my type of woman and I'd love to meet fellow Melanie lovelies xxx
I'm really scared of not being this happy was me two years ago. Regardless you will end up absolutely fine due to your incredible strength but I really really am rooting for you for this to be It. Enjoy every minute  ‚ù§
‚ÄúLadies never come on to me‚Äù\nExcuse me what are you talking about I‚Äôm a lady and I think you‚Äôre hot üòÇüíñ
Awww you and your boyfriend are cute üòä My fianc√© and I are long distance (4,500 miles apart) and are making it work through communication and dedication. It's challenging, but he's worth it ‚ù§ I wish you both all the happiness üôè
You must be an awesome friend.
i LOVE U! Everytime when i watch your video i'm in this amazing mood! Thank u!
I am confident enough normally, but when I go to school I find I start to think negatively about myself. Any advice on how to snap out of it?
YOUNG ADULT FANTASY IS MY SHIT
My lesbian ass was so excited cause I thought you had a girlfriend but oh well üòÑ very happy for you!
I've been long distance for over a year and we're still going strong! Love will prevail!
i enjoyed this video
I'm only 14 and haven't been through what you have been through but you give me the motivation to live life to the fullest every day even when i'm sad, and you give me the hope that if something was to happen to me someday I will be ok, so I guess im trying to say thank you for making life a little easier, more fun and more inspirational. I love u and your videos soo much Mel x
It's so, so amazing seeing you so happy and vibrant. You look absolutley gorgeous, Melanie. X
Ahhh I love seeing you happy, Mel! And your bf seems like a nice guy :)
Having a pet die is so much worse than I thought it would be before it happened to me. When I had to put my 16 year old cat down I was absolutely devastated, and kept breaking into tears in the weeks afterwards just thinking about her. I could barely see through the tears driving home from the vet's office, and I still get choked up thinking about it. I've lived a fairly sheltered, happy life and I find that it's so easy for me to underestimate the pain of other people's loss until it happens to me. When people used to put up pictures of their dead pets on Facebook I always felt bad but also thought it was a little bit of an overreaction (harsh, I know), but now I truly understand the sadness that comes with losing a creature who depended on you for their entire life.
omg i really need a gay book from you that would be amazingggggg
Welcome back! Hope some of your happiness rubs off (I need me a man too!) :D
melanie, don't be so scared about losing your happiness that you forget to enjoy it.
oh my god?? He is so gorgeous I am so happy for you!! Seems like a great match!
you must watch Jess and Gabriel's  channel. long distance couple married now.
It's so awesome seeing you so happy <3 My boyfriend of 3.5 years (3 years were long distance) and I recently ended our relationship. NOT because of long distance, so don't be scared! I honestly thought long distance was amazing for us to learn more about independence and better communication. But, breaking up was the hardest decision we have ever had to make and even though we know it's for the better of our own personal growth, it is so hard to be without him. Seeing you so happy like this is inspiring and it is helping me find new reasons to be happy every day.
Is there any chance that Your book will be translete to other languages and puplished in other countrys? Love from Poland
you seem so in love üíïüíïüíïüíï

Congrats I am so happy for you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I cannot wait for your merch!!! Still waiting for your book to be released in South Africa, but if it takes much longer I'll just have to take the online route. Love you! Love what you do! üíöüíöüíö
The best example of a long distant relationship is jess   and Gabriel conte \nShe is from Australia and he is from America and they are finally married now\nThey're so cute together I can't deal‚ù§üòÑ
I WOULD LOVE YA FANTASY WRITTEN BY YOU MELANIE
This video is so pure and touchingüò≤üíö Makes me feel greatful and blessed for everything in my life right nowüòä Thank you Melanieüíö
if you like YA fantasy I'd say you'd love Sarah J Maas' Throne of Glass series and her A Court of Thorns and Roses (!!!) series, if you haven't already read them üòÖ
You look so freaking in love! I'm so happy for you! I just broke up with my love a month ago and I was avoiding watching people in lov, 'cause it was too much for me, but with you... I'm just so glad that you found someone who makes your eyes so sparkling <3 I can't stop smiling right now :D
Awwwww adorable, so happy for you üíã‚ù§Ô∏è

Hey Melanie! I'm not big into YouTube or anything but for some reason I stumbled onto your page over the summer and it has changed my life. I'm a junior in college and have been struggling with so many of the things you discuss in your videos and I just wanted to let you know that you have helped me become a better person and you never fail to make my day better. Much love xxx
I havent gotten to the assault part in the book yet... I am so sorry Mel... Especially that I am Polish. I am so sorry...
A podcast by Louise and Emma would just be the best thing üòç
‚Äúi already have this mug‚Äù *goes to put it back in the back* üò≠üòÇ
I‚Äôve always been the ‚Äúplain Jane‚Äù simple, non fashionable mum. I‚Äôm proud of that now, whereas before it was a huge paranoia issue for me. Xxx
He's fit isn't heüòÇ
Well I am in my matalan pyjamas on my bed after eating a huge portion of stir fry in my slightly untidy room which I tidied last week. And I am really enjoying my jolly self (-:
This video cheered me right up after a bad day of headaches and other health crap. \nI have a friend who is over from Australia. Being disabled and having chronic fatigue, sometimes my house is far from instagram worthy. She always talks me she's come to see me, not the house. \nI might just have to start thinking about starting/ restarting my blog, and start vlogging. I know so many people in the same situation as myself, and we all discuss how there isn't really anything or anyone out there telling it like it is. Today's normal is being in bed since lunchtime, lots of co-codamol and sleep in my oldest and most comfortable nighty. Tomorrow's normal might (hopefully) see me in my craft room making a bespoke greetings card. On Sunday evening, we are off to see Suzanne Vega in concert. Normal is such a diverse range of scenarios, depending on your view point.
I love you two together üòÇ Emma is such a legend! Had a bit of a rubbish day and just got into the bath and started watching this, was immediately cheered up by ooh he's fit isn't he üòÇ xxx
very good points and all but sometimes louise is so out of touch that I can't take her seriously.
I loved what Emma said about how normal isn't just 'white mums in their 30s' - was such an inclusive and validating statement that addressed the lack of diversity in the mum online community.
My favorite saying is, I don't want to wear real clothes.  I dress myself decently when I have to do things at my kid's school or if I am leaving the house.  Otherwise, I am wearing yoga pants and a shirt.  I have 5 kids, and I can certainly agree that life is never perfect.  We are normal people here too.  My other favorite saying is, you either get hair or makeup.  I like the idea of just being the average person.
I just wanted to let you know, Louise, that I quite enjoyed this chatty vlog.
I love this video ,, there needs to be more of this no social media
So refreshing, not the usual unrealistic, copy and paste YouTube chat that we see by so many others!  Loved this! Xxxx
no not fleek, they say lit now
My normal is a day in my pj's looking after my nephew letting him mess my house apart and being a normal messy 1 year old, my living room consists on ride along diggers and a massive toy box that hardly contains toys as there everywhere elseüòÇ
I love this so much üòÇüòÇ
Why do i see u on the trending tab so much to the point where i want to throw myself off a cliff
You 2 together are just bloody awesome xxx
do you pay to get on trending or something?
All have a look at Brene Brown on You Tube, most popular Ted Talk of all time. She says the same thing.I am enough is her mantra, gratitude is her way of life.
Words all of the words üòÇ
my Instagram bio is; a random selection of things I see, things I do and when I feel like it also my face. it's as real as it gets posting literally when I see things I like, when I go and do things, and when I think I look nice of funny a picture of myself. sometimes I post daily sometimes weekly annd other times it takes a month and it's all okay.
I love this video and the message behind it! You girls are fantastic\n\nBig Hugs and Kisses xoxo Sharon
omg the pink hair is such a throwback!
I love you both such inspirations and amazing for keeping it real xx
YES MY LIFE IS COMPLETE.
Louise I think you should name your baby Ayla it‚Äôs very unique and not many people have it also not to mention it sounds very cute with the name Darcy!\nAyla and Darcy!!
Confidence comes from within and my mother always told me , no one is better than you - they can be the same as you but not better .. i have never felt less than because of this and I am raising my daughters the same.  my house is neat because i have OCD that's me.. you are messy that's you . i don't judge and normal is used incorrectly.  don't judge me because you are insecure or feeling less than.
Oh my god I LOVE THESE TWO SO MUCH.
Feeling super anxious at the moment but this video was really comforting thank you
Love this, honestly made me feel so much better
Any other mums wish Louise was in your mummy group ?!
Yr friend is lovely just my sorta person bubbly like my self x
Grey blazer and that hair. LIFE
This is such an empowering and inspiring video ladies üíï I love it. It's okay to be normal ‚ú®
Love this. This is what my whole mantra is: you do you. Oxox
This cracked me up so much üòÇ I love you two ‚ù§Ô∏è such fun for this Friday!
i heart you two! <3
My normal is bed with 9 chicken nuggets sat on my breasts. In a box. Obvs.
watching your videos is my after-college treat.. so relaxing!!
Emma: Take a picture of yourself right now\nMe: Im in the bath! üòÇ\nI love you both so much üíóüòá
Excellent video from excellent ladies. Thank you for putting this up.
I love Emma so muchüòª
Completely agree! Love you both!
i love both of you just the way you are! dont change üòä
Aw fucking love you two! Average is so good!
I could watch a good couple of hours of you just talking about random crap Louise
Louise and Emma I really bloody loved this video. More of you two chatting inspirational bollocks‚ù§Ô∏è
As a mom of three kids, four dogs, and a full time RN.....I just love stuff like this. My house is often a huge mess even though I am constantly cleaning. There's just not enough time in the day for everything to be perfect all the time! And I love y'all together! I have tons of ordinary pictures on my Instagram kimi_lynn if you want to check them out! Lol
Aww you could really see the friendship between you two here üòä
I love your pink hair so much omyyyüòçüôÜ
Lost it at ‚Äúmy face isn‚Äôt pregnant‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
I could've watched 3 hours of this, tbh.
Really ladies think you are just doing anything to get a vlog out !!!!
You have the prettiest eye colour!
This is amazing! I live for little chatty videos like this. I feel like I'm sitting there with you joining in with your conversation. Keep up the great videos Louise! üòäüíï
I watched this video tucked up in bed with a galaxy hot chocolate and marshmallows and it really cheered me up because I have laryngitis and feel like crap! X
I'm getting better about comparing myself to others but 100% yes to all of this!!
I wish I had an Emma, or at least a friend as great as Emma. I just have a dog that gives me a shady side eye when I talk to her, or glances at me judgingly when I have ice cream for dinner.
True, there are no painting walls in Birmingham üòÇüòÇ
Thank you so much for making this I love the bit where your talking about social media and not caring about what people think. I found it really inspiring x
I was watching this while opening my new xmas tree x
Dear Sprinkle can you please flag me so I don't see your videos coming up in my feed. Reason being, I have no interest in your videos. Thanks üëç
I love this video! I love how casual and sweet it is. Please do more collabs! <3 you
Louise you are looking absolutely bloody stunning in this video, that hair/cardigan combo is a treat never mind that glow you've got going on. Can we also take a moment for when you went to do the ' west side' sign & simply just held your hands up üòÜ my kind of cool mum! x
This average chat, about being average, was way far up above average!  Well done  :-)
Haha an example of my normal yesterday was my toddler running round clutching a box of tampons, as she wanted a snack! Note: tampons aren't a usual snack! üòÇüòÇ
Emma: Where you're sat now, just take a photo. \nI am literally sitting on the toilet while watching this.. that really doesn't sound like a good idea now, does it? üòÇüòÇ
Can that sofa handle you two fattys
My normal right now is eating hummus with my finger! I was dipping crisps but ran out of crisps and still wanted more hummus.
I love it be the average person ‚ù§Ô∏è
i just think people can take me as they find me but that doesnt mean that i dont make an effort to look nice sometimes and other times i dont have the time to make an effort. i have a baby at 19 so i think ive grown up fast and not only that who have i got to impress? xxx
I did not know what to expect from this title but this was very enjoyable and comforting!
Loved seeing Emma in your videos recently, totally relate to her personality üòÇ. I've had to subscribe to her! üíó
good video my daughter has the same mug
Bloody love this vid!! I wanna be friends with you both lol x
Wow I love this so much. I'm a nanny and I follow lots of nanny pages on instagram that post these BEAUTIFUL pictures of themselves wearing nice, trendy clothes and taking their nanny kids (who are impeccably dressed with their hair beautifully done) on expensive and exciting outings where they somehow manage to get the kids to sit still and all look at the camera at the same time. Meanwhile I'm over here with my yoga pants and frizzy ponytail which gets drizzled throughout the day from having stuffed animals rubbed on top of my head, and the living room floor is covered in train track pieces and race cars and dinosaurs and the three year old is wearing one of only three articles of clothing I can get her to wear - almost always her Elsa dress or her Sophia dress - and they're arguing about buckled treble seatbelt faster in the car.  Nannying is a lot like motherhood: it never looks as perfect as people make it out to be, but I LOVE my job and I love my girls, even when it's very, very average. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
If im being honest, i dont really like the look perfect looking people, they kind of remind me of dolls. im sorry perfect looking people, you are still beautiful but i guess i'd just prefer uhh lets say dodie clark over kylie jenner? like they are both pretty but a different kind of pretty
Love this love you guys together love the message
Why is this on trending?
l'm loving your sit-chatty videos and loving todays chat‚ù§

Let's not forget gurrrrrrls - you are the exception to the rule. Most of us norms don't give a crap what brands think. Cos we have normal jobs and use social media to BE SOCIAL. You know. Like actual normal folk.
is that a british thing? does kids sound more unpolished or lower class than children? i'm genuinely curious. i sensed a mutual understanding between the two of them that suggested it was a cultural thing.
What's the song where Liza is playing violin?

Where do you get your Adderall?  Scrip? Friends? 3 minutes of you is intolerable.  Why do you both have handles on top of your heads? Then you are probably offended when a guy uses it, even though it begs to be used.

Do a one piece episode
This is the power of a soul........determinaton
so how does a dragon ball radar work?\nfood for thought.
Almost skipped this video cause the opening song plz consider changing man.
ppl on the market go up to about a million and the gov values us around 7 million
Yo bro you move slower running like naruto but look way cooler running like naruto
I'm at episode 532 in one piece... Am I there yet? No? About halfway? Ahhh shit.
Calling manga comics... That is going to make some people more salty than a taco Bell dinner.
How he has referred to Hiroshima like 20 over the amount of theories he has made.
Hey Matpat,  I bet you wouldn‚Äôt make a theory on The Shining or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Those are movies for REAL theorists.
HI MatPat I have a film theory.How big is Grus lab from despicable me. I got this question when i saw the rocket  that was about to steal the moon.Pls do this
Make a video of ghosts rider
my my Edward is such a short fuse if he doesnt stop his hair color will be short lived
but true physicist do not believe in soul existence, which is related to God that most people nowadays consider as pure bullshit, that is why physicist believe human life it is just brain electric network and chemical reactions, why don't you a person who almost relate any theory to Einstein theory call it soul?, why not call it complex electric and chemical reactions
2017, and people still say nah-ROO-toh even though his name is pronounced NAH-roo-toh in 700 episodes of both the English and Japanese dub. Watch any clip of Naruto where his name is mentioned, they say it thousands of times throughout the series, so why do people STILL say it wrong?
I'm guessing another life, maybe an arm and a leg. üòï
I don't watch Chinese Hentai but it was on trending so why not
I just had a thought that Brian actually dies saving his son in the explosion in Furious 7 and Toretto is seeing a figment of his imagination and fueled by rage. This gives him the Edward Cullen syndrome as he keeps pushing stunts to be closer to and see Brian. I.e. Just driving backward off a GD mountain and tumbling down it... Or the building to building jump. It even kinda makes sense if he imagined the last goodbye. Though in a good way. But hey that's just a theory..
uh matpat I think you forgot to account that half of his souls went the homonculie remember.
waiting for that sao theory
would actually be even more energy per soul, since Lust is... about 300 years old when she's defeated by Mustang? And, clearly, that wasn't her first fight.\nAlso note that Father does not use exactly half of his soul energy, as he is shown taking and giving energy with Greed and Gluttony, respectively.
Don't worry mat pat  people are triggered over anything üëç
>listening to film theory in background while talking to friend\n>mention that they could gain exponential growth in number of friends, exceeding dunbar's number after 8 generations of people\n>15 seconds  later, hear MatPat say dunbar's number\nAre you a psychic, MatPat? This was way too crazy of a coincidence.
Did he do (IT) yet if not PLEASE TO A VIDEO ON (IT)
In summary: You need the energy of a nuke... And more to account for inefficiency losses.
There is going to be a new saw movie and i have a great theory idea:is Kevin from home alone is jigsaw from saw
I think your theories are based on a single universe. like say a single movie of that universe. two of your theories I really like. the matrix and full metal alchemist theories. but what if the human soul  can produce enough energy to start a new big bang to reset the whole cosmos that a necessary evil has to be done to control that power. Wouldn't that be logical for the machine of the matrix. but again that's two different theories in two different universe and each theory you do is based on that movies universe, right? I just like to think that there is a bigger picture her than meets the eyes.   thinking outside the box, way WAY outside the box,  everything is one and based on the singular theory of our universe. which is were every story and movie and science is based on, I don't know. just saying üòé
My soul is worth nothing, beacuse I clicked on this video...
Ok theory idea, \nThe blue car with three wheels is getting hurt. I want to know, would the driver died or if he did how many time did he die\nPlz DO
Lust has definitely died way more before her encounter with mustang plus they get their power from the souls so they'd be constantly draining them of their energy.
Irl souls have infinite energy. Something infinite has to exist in order for something finite to come to exist. Go figure.
Hey mat pat This is going to be a bit weird... but did you see the missing halloween short fun thingy ma bob? If you did, could you perhaps do a theory or something like that...?
I know this has nothing to do with this video but in the last Rick and Morty there was a memory marked Stanford
You can't make a theory out of nothing ... Yes you can.
One problem with this theory though. Lust has been around for a long time and have most likely regenerate her body throughout that time. The amount of souls left should have been lowered
it's naruto not narudo
You forgot to take into account past damage that lust has taken
hmm father now kinda reminds me of the emperor of mankind from warhammer 40k if the whole he divided his emotions into his 20 primarchs theory is correct though his power is equivalent to a thousand suns compared to father's
One Piece took me 2 years to get to episode 440 when I watched 20 episodes per day.
Matpat. You need to bring Austin into the fold for this episode. He came across some research theories discussing about pulling matter from outside our universe. I think it was the portal episode. He talks about Einstein a lot too.
I really feel like some will try and get one of these stones so how lol
you pronounced naruto wrong and i was on the brink of suicide
‚ú¶ Anime based theory: Boku No Hero Academia ‚ú∞\n‚ú¶ Netflix series: Stranger Things or Better Call Saul ‚ú∞\n‚ú¶ Cartoon based: How To Train Your Dragon (Race to the Edge) ‚ú∞\n‚åÅ ‚åÅ ‚åÅ
Does that mean if I eat half the worlds uranium reserves I get to be immortal?
it'll take roughly 13 days to finish one piece with the latest episode being 806,that is if you watch non stop.\ngive it a go its many peoples favorite(including me).plus its ongoing and there are alot of theories about it,someone like you would love it!
Good timing I just finished watching Brotherhood a few weeks ago
Who remembers when the narrator of the intro asks  what does a human soul cost  and in episode 1 or 2 Edward gives his arm for Al's soul so he can put it on a suit of armor
6:50 didn't Hoenheim say he memorized their names? He didn't say he had a stable relationship with all of them, so Dunbar's number is meaningless.
The whole time passing thing is thrown out by  Pok√©mon
I am a good boy
Hold on, though... on the episode where Edward, the prince and Envy get trapped inside Gluttony, Edward realices that Envy is very powerful and has a great mass, due to Envy's (Can`t be sure if to call it's/her/his) footprints... so assuming that an equal distribution of souls is appliable here, might be questionable. Besides, you're not solving the variable that Pride represents, since he's The only hommunculi that can age (In both versions of the anime... although has different names)... also, you're forgetting the canonic basis of the anime: ALCHEMY, which allows the characters do transmutations and such... so yeah, it`s a nice approach... but I think it's a work in progress... Keep at it!!
When is he going to  update the theme song
Why not try making a theory on the original fma? They're different universes. Alternate timelines. Everybody always focuses on brotherhood when the original was just as great. Unpopular opinion, but I believe the original is better. Especially since it was all based off a whim. Off the top of the head. It's so great for an anime to be done in a timely manor, yet on such short notice.
FMA is the one anime I can watch over and over and over and never get sick of and because of this video I have the craving to watch it again thanks
Mat pat thank you for this theory, i loved full metal Alchemist and please make more anime theories in the future. And hope that you obtain a philosophers stone for your own use.
I knew a guy who sold his soul for a milky way...
With all those Soul Eater souls in the video I now want to reread the whole Soul Eater manga.
It may be more than your estimates given the years that she has been alive for. Much of that energy may have been consumed at an earlier point in time, Although it is possible that souls are a power generator and are able to regenerate their energy over a period of time.
Who's to say that we even have souls and not just a bunch of electrical and chemical activities
MatPat you should do a theory on High School DXD about how powerful the Boosted Gear is or if it is even possible. Though censoring would be needed.
I sold my my soul but they lied and gave me $10 instead of $100,000,000,0000,000
That's  weird their was one ‚òùÔ∏è episode I full metal alchemist when ed and his brother meet that doctor he said fine the truth within the truth I watch the episode  but I didn't get it  what did he mean the truth within the truth and I think you're theory just solved it
I wish you would stop ruining shit for us. For the last 2 or 3 vids you made, you've done a great job pissing me off. Especially when you ripped Wonder Woman.
watching dark souls and ended up in this...
Please make a code geass video. Lelouch is one of my favorite characters of all time
MatPat could you please consider creating a My Hero Academia theory? That would be absolutely stupendous.üòÄ
I accadentally skipped part of the end and this is what I heard; We have proven definitively the value of a human soul isn't JUST A THEORY- A FIIIIIIIILM THEORY.
But what if Ed and Al's dad had more souls
You do realize one human soul is equivalent to one nuclear bomb let me explain If a human lives to be 90 to 100 years old then that would mean one human soul has enough energy like a nucleon bomb
Hey. Now that you're into anime, Make one on Metal Fight Beyblade. Like, maybe the fate of ryuga.
I read the title as ‚ÄúHow much is YOUR soul worth‚Äù like, ok, _JudgePat_
your probably gonna end up offending people saying your gonna offend people
I binged watched one piece from ep 1 to ep 800.. it took 4 weeks..

Mom can you jerk me off?\n yes.
History will remember you Jimmy, because of this effort
No one's gunna make fun of that Kennedy guy's blinking?! Dude blinked like 100 times in like less than 20 seconds.
Jimmy crying about Obamacare when nobody in his family is using it.  I doubt he even knows anyone on it.
This is not about being a democrat or a republican, a Trump supporter or a hater! This is just common sense! I don‚Äôt understand why some can‚Äôt understand Jimmy‚Äôs point! It‚Äôs very straight forward!
You get your heath care from ABC and you seem to not know how much obamacare is destroying the health care system. Stop bringing your your personal life into a political argument.
I rarely watch any TV and I don't watch late night tv at all because it stopped being entertaining. Jimmy Kimmel's monologues are the perfect example. WHY ON EARTH would you turn into these shows to watch politics?  These late night shows used to be about entertainment. This is NOT entertainment.   It must be horribly boring to watch these shows.  BTW, he's getting help from the democrat party for these health insurance lectures.   WOW SO ENTERTAINING.
I live in England so is there a petition I can sign?!?!
Thank me later click the link
jimmy you are my hero!
jimmy should have ran for pres.... a politician is suppose to look after the people something they've forgotten over the years.
Thank you for naming all the major health institutions people trust and respect who oppose this bill. (The Mayo Clinic just released a statement: http://www.kttc.com/story/36434307/2017/09/Friday/mayo-clinics-dr-john-noseworthy-responds-to-latest-healthcare-bill.)\nYouTube skews to a younger and healthier audience, primarily 35 and under. But almost everyone has a relative or community elder who's given them passing familiarity w/the American Cancer Society or Diabetes Association. Or they've seen the March of Dimes box at the supermarket. Or participated in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge (donating to the ALS Association). They're woven into our community. It's more familiar and less intimidating, easier to feel like you know enough and have a stake. Thank you.
Still can't afford health insurance...haven't for years now...glad I'm the only one..
Jimmy Kimmel ma boy! I'm sorry about all the thing your son, your family, and your self are going through! Thank you for being your self and for looking out for people who need medical care!
David Letterman please come back!!! At least he was funny.
I get it but being someone never under insurance and well paying a bill for zero coverage plus a bill on top that's 1/15 my income plus my house 2/3 my income lets say my income is well tight. fix health care but don't give me a bill a penalty for being a broke ass in the grey! i give away another $ 700 for no health care. I LOVE MY COUNTRY BUT MY COUNTRY HATES ME!
I'm a Type 1 Diabetic, since I  11 years old. \nAnyone who doesn't believe in guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions can EAT ME. \nüíöüíõüíúüíô Jimmy Kimmel! ü§ò Stay strong... Best wishes to you and your family. \nTHANK YOU!!!
When you realize that jimmy kimmel obviously doesn't have Obama care
When is the time you have you sign up for health care if you plan getting coverage next year? And is Blue Cross Blue Shield any good? Also is healthcare expensive?
What kind of scum dislikes this video?
He doesn't know what he is talking about. Obamacare was a screw job by the republicans, insurance companies, and the democarts to wreck American healthcare. Who honestly likes Obamacare?
He just handed out a massacre to the Trump administration and his party. Good!!!!
I'm for Charlie's winning health care approach
Hey yo Jimmy! You're supposed to be funny. Now dance clown!
Who is Donald trump fans here and going against jimmy kimmel opinion
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Jimmy should invite Bernie Sanders to talk about Single Payer.\nAnd please, do not waste time talking about Hillary's new book like Colbert did.
America is screwed because idiots like you think that healthcare is a right. Healthcare is a service just like everything else and when government gets involved, it becomes more expensive.
If you comment you call
Healthcare for all would be cheaper that's a fact conservabitches try to ignore
Jimmy Kimmel has the money to pay for expensive healthcare.  We in the middle class are being crushed---high premiums and high deductibles ($7,150).  You suck Jimmy Kimmel for being so dishonest to the public.  Shame on you, and you act like you really care.  The poor already had government healthcare and Obamacare was the biggest lie to the American people.  I know because my health insurance went from $740. to $1,440  for 2 adults and 2 children.  Jimmy Kimmel is not funny any more just a puppet for democrats.  He just wants to keep whining because his good friend Hillary Clinton didn't get elected.  Wake-up America!  Everyone should boycott his show and tell all their friends and family to do the same.
Jimmy talk to Ben Shapiro, you might get your facts. Your facts needs fact-check. https://youtu.be/O3v30jVtXMI
It‚Äôs not Obama Care, it‚Äôs Affordable Care Act.
Shapiro 2024 for President, book it
Health care is not the governments obligation just like daca and welfare aren't either so stop bitching #MAGAüá∫üá∏
You are such a paid hack. Regular American middle class can not afford Obamacare. Sheeple will listen to your bull crap
mr. Kimmel Obamacare priced my wife and out out of our old tried and true health care ins.. 380 per month 6,000 out of pocket deductible per person becore ins would start paying anything.\nI truly feel bad for your child and pray for all children. They are truly innocent.\nwe dont all make talk show host salaries, just keep that in mind.
Please stick to comedy. Make late-night entertaining again instead of misinformed political lectures every 5 minutes. It's better for people to be uninformed rather than misinformed.
Under Obamacare my health care deductible increased from 1000USD to 1200USD and I was mandated by law to have health insurance -- not to mention that Obama also raised my FIFA by 150USD that same year. Fact: Obamacare sure as hell didn't help me -- not only did the leftist policy raise my rate, but it literally forced me to have health insurance. The  _individual mandate_ was supposed to bring policy prices down, but it did not do such for me. Also, they lied when they pushed it as a 'commerce' amendment when the Supreme Court interpreted it as a 'tax' amendment. If they pushed the amendment as a new tax from the get-go, it would have likely received less support.   \n\nIt should go back to the way it was -- and  if  the [state] governments want to help out needy peeps making under 25K or so, then they can decide to do so out of their budgets, without forcing me to have health insurance -- much less one controlled by a non-efficient government. For example, when I was younger, with more certainty about my health, I could decide to put more money into college than into health insurance; the choice should be the individual's.
My mom who is fortunately in remission from an aggressive form of leukemia is making sure I call my senator.  (202)224-3121 is the number to call. She definitely would not be alive if she didn't have medicaid and medicare. Please do it for your mom!
Don't tell people how to spend their money. Socialism destroys freedom.
He‚Äôs still on TV? He is quite irritating.
Whatever will poor Kimmel do with his millions without govt healthcare?
Jimmy , You on the other hand don't like ANYTHING that does have a Trump sticker on it. No matter what it is. Do You really think that Obama Care is so good?
They don't like it cause it reduces their excessive billing!
Anyone in a suit can go!
Jimmy is a blessing as heartbreaking as it is if his son wasnt born with problems then none of this would have even begun so thank  you jimmy with helping all the families and people who cant afford heealthcare
I wish more people that had a platform would¬†speak truth¬†like Jimmy Kimmel who doesn't seem afraid to take on the wrath of idiots.
All the vice did was quote done words. He didn't answer nothing
People are fed up of Trump they want healthcare not it being stripped away from them and giving the money to private healthcare companies.
He's so brave
Why did kimmel have to collude with schumar, youre gonna remove the curtain on oz for everyone man!
I'm glad someone finally has the balls and power to speak up against things like this
The only people that benifit from obama care are people who dont work , the rest of the people have to pay high costs for insurance ! how fair is that it sounds like people bieng punished for working.
I like that John Oliver has lent out his balls for the week to Jimmy Kimmel, he has used them well.
This guy is a joke.
America first...... Send all foreign aid back to America and pay for health care
See what Ben Shapiro had to say about JK
Why does the left need ignorant celebrities and sport starts to push their failed policies?  These millionaires with no business or political experience have no idea what the average person is facing.
The swamp feeders are going to get screwed when the government takes away their existing health care benefits!
Love Jimmy! This is hilarious!
He's not wrong about Florida. It there's no law against it, it will be done, and i wouldn't be surprised to go back to Florida and find stripper alligators
Jimmy is the MVP
In the words of Adam Corolla What a Blow Hard.... I wonder why no one ever ask Adam what he thinks of his Former partner now? I can understand why Adam would stay away from that question
I'd say whatever big gov agenda they wanted me to say too if I was making as much as this guy.
AMAZING! So, you don't have the income to handle the cost of insurance?  Your a flat out liar!  It's one thing to be  mislead but you can have someone actually do research to learn the truth!  Shut up or leave your bubble!  You should be replaced with someone who is actually interesting!  Your a swampmonster!
If jimmy didnt support the democrats he would probably find his son dead on a hill by natural causes.
Comedy and politics shouldn't collide.
One Love
Killary for Prison  ! !
Jimmy = clown
I wonder what dnc staffer writes his talking points?
Ignore scientists on gender.\nBelieve Jimmy on healthcare.\nüôÑüí©üôÑüí©üôÑüí©üôÑüí©
Thank you Jimmy!!!
Gov. Healthcare doesn't work
Liberal snowflakes
Kimmel... just stop man. Youre ruining late night
Kimmel's on fire
thank you Jimmy.
Thank you sir!
Thank you again, Jimmy Kimmel.
Thank you Jimmy!!! <3

Keep at it!!!

Kimmel was coached by schummer.   Damn socialist.  Why work?
Love jimmy
SHOTS fired lol ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Jimmy doesn't care about the hard working middle class American People.   Plain and simple.
So many whiners complaining about Obamacare, but nobody can provide a better option. Seriously, make better healthcare and the best idea wins. Otherwise the rhetoric doesn‚Äôt help people. Give an idea and move forward.
Kimmel needs to retire I'm tired of hearing his crap, if you don't like trump you can get out of the u.s. to hollyweard.
Stick to what you do best...comedy...not politics.
Why is this ducking clown so preachy about politics
Hang on a minute folks....Kimmel has got to check on his notes and talking points he got from Scmuck Schumer.....what a FRICKEN FRAUD Kimmel is....prostituting his sick kid like a 2 bit hooker.....DISGUSTING.
Is this CNN or a talk show?
Watch Vsauce 3 Video here ‚Äì Do it now!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d9i_0Ty7Cg  : )
Here's a better question:\nDoes it really matter?
I don't get it
Yeah but who is going to program this shit.
What if we all are cereals in milk on something's plate and he is trying to eat us? Seems like I got an new theory for you!
Simulation with pain. Sadness, senses, cant be a simulation man.
Slow down! Looking good. My man! Yes.
I bet we're just used to power some aliens car.
wow this is a subject i had in mind in my 14 's... its great that u still suprise me :)
Are you a simulation m morty
A simulation is a part of reality because it simply exists
what if simulation is reality?
My take on this is what if our idea of a simulation is actually reality at it's most fundamental. What if all of reality is just information in a pattern, how the pattern is generated or how complex it is doesn't really matter. We interpret it as we can and make of it what we will, as will every other part of this pattern of information considered existence. I think this takes away the need for some 'omnipotent programmer', which is really the biggest problem i have with this idea. What makes that entity exist outside of our system? It seems like if they were outside of it ,they couldn't really interact with it without being affected by the creation (us) right back, so does that make the simulation just as real as the 'omnipotent programmer'?  And in the spirit of that old show Reboot, WHAT IF ALL THE SIMS I MURDERED DURING MY BROODY TEENAGE YEARS  WERE REAL PEOPLE?!?!
Now playing:  _Human Music_
i already knew that
Simulation - Why one computer with all that power? Why not a network of computers all over the globe plugged in by the last humans and each computer imagining it's a human
Time to kill my 'self'
What if our life is a simulation and what where seeing are halagrams
After this video was made the creator was deleted from this virtual simulation . Do not speak of the matrix god.
What if God considers reality a simulation?\n\nThe simulation argument is untestable, and therefore is not a hypothesis. Just as the question I just stated here is untestable, and therefore not a hypothesis.\n\nEffectively, this argument is portraying a new metaphysical worldview, that you either believe or you do not - independent of any scientifically testable data. What each of us has to live with is that you have a choice of what metaphysics to believe - with the key consideration being that what you believe deeply shapes your actions. Which ultimately leaves you with the real question this video summons: would believing this worldview cause you to behave in a way that you want to behave? The answer to this question speaks most deeply to whether or not the simulation argument is one you will adopt as your own, or not.
That's Deep Thought!!! The supercomputer from Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy!! So.... 42 simulations?
people believing this are flat earthers descendants
Well good thing the Lord God is real XD
When will the end of the world be? When Windows crashs.
you are\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\ninside a simularion\n inside another simulation eavrn more bigger
All it requires is an Asteroid to hit the earth.
The matrix come into reality?\nThese are theories after all and they're seem to be pretty accurate in my opinion.\n\nWe could live in simulated world and simulate other humans and the cycle goes on forever.
The video is nonsense
Pls no more of that vsauce 3 guy.
What is a live action human doing in my cartoon duck video?! ;D
You don't need a computer that fast. The simulation doesn't know how fast it is running in actual time, it can only operate using it's own time.
You already did this... just like litrly every other sience chanel on you tube
Your music and overall soundscape is getting more and more on point with each video.
No matter where we are living,\nLive and let live
What if it isn't a computer?
We are both creators and creations, just not in the way most scientists expect.
I don't think I am simulation because there don't seem to be any glitches in real life.  Everything is very consistent.  All our best computer programs get glitches and stuff every so often that gives it away that they are computers.  And the only other simulated reality we know of, dreams, are glitchy af.  \nBut, I do actually hope that life is a simulation because if it is, then that means that technology has already progressed somewhere to God like levels.  I feel that the ultimate goal of the universe is to become totally conscious of itself, and manifest its absolute potential.  Such a thing would only be possible through incredibly intelligent beings so advanced, we might think of them as Gods because they pretty much would have the ability to do almost anything.  Maybe that is what God is.  Maybe the God of this universe started out just like we did... in ignorance.  Maybe it just found itself existing some day as a single cell, experiencing death, and didn't know how it came to be, but then after billions of years, it evolved to such a thing that it had the power to create a universe.  \nBut I don't know.  Things like the fermi paradox worries me.  I worry that maybe EVERY civilization just gets wiped out eventually, before ever having the ability to transcend biological limitations, or travel the universe.  Whether they destroy themselves, or just every planet gets unlucky eventually, and gets hit by asteroids, or gamma ray bursts..... constantly destroying millions of years of evolution.  If that is the case, we may never know the full potential of the universe.  I WANT there to be advanced civilizations.  I want this to be a simulation made by a super smart thing.  But at the same time, if this IS a simulation, I would want to punch my programmer in the face for making this a shitty one.  WTF man!?  You couldn't have made this a little better for me?  Asshole.
The biggest problem is that a simulation made solely to fool it's conscious inhabitants into believing they're real wouldn't have much use as a scientific simulation, and, so it's only purpose would be as entertainment, and, well, people are boring. ninety-nine percent of people spend ninety-nine percent of their time just doing the same routine over and over again in order to survive. This is true for all of human history. Sure, we have wars and sports and media of our own, but why would they bother simulating the rest of human life? And if it is scientifically accurate, a species intelligent enough to produce the amount of computing power even close to simulating the entire universe would most likely already be so intelligent that they wouldn't find anything that would broaden their horizons by any amount that would be worth the effort in their simulation.
1970 i hope we have flying cars in the future \n2017:
want to hear a joke :3 windows
My life is a lie.
Honestly if someones gonna make simulations of human history, why make EVERYONE, why not just the people in history books and shit like that, not every person on the planet
What if the things simulating us... Are being simulated.....  And so on
We're in a miniverse
If there were simulations, then yes it would be nearly impossible for us not to be in one. However, I've thought long and hard about this in the past, and the chances of another life form existing to make a simulation is nearly impossible.
I think there is a glitch or something cause im doing my homework but its not showing up on my grades.  Fucking lazy devs fix your shit pleas
this is impossible because we're all gonna die from lack of natural recourses before we can develop a computer that can simulate said worlds
It's #3 that lets me sleep soundly. In the words of the poet Hetfield, We're so f*cked, shit out of luck, hard-wired to self destruct. \nThe Fermi paradox says it all: eventually resources become so scarce in a large population of a high technology civilization, that they'd sooner risk accidentally detonating a doomsday machine, if not war outright, or even slowly bake to death in their own filth. \nBest case: all civilisations continually cull themselves and revert technological advancement, long before building such a computer.\n\nAnd if by fluke some species manages to overcome the socioeconomic forces that inherently lead to self destruction, they will be like the beings in assumption #4 - completely uninterested in studying dog-eat-dog species and their ingenious methods of killing themselves.
a human being starts when the sperm fertilize the egg. Think about it.
I think that is incorrect to say 1 vs 1 billion universes (this assumes that for sure there are billions of simulated universes) because if we are real then there are no simulated universes.
Blueprints for our enslavement. Honestly guys this is kinda bs evil crap.  Get out while you still can from the technocratts
Maybe aliens were simulating us and forgot to turn us off, maybe we weren't supposed to be this advanced in technology...
1:34 I am triggered I'm sitting on a stool not a chair ima file a lawsuit :P
I always believed that whenever something abnormal happens in my day, it's a glitch in the system.
Does the universe simulator computer *really* need to run so fast? It doesnt need to run real time, not like the inhabitants would notice if one second is actually one hour in the real world.\n\nCurrent computers could probably do it, if we had infinity time to wait for all the processing each frame.
So this is the latest conspiracy theory out there.
Ahh, this is one of these render distance crap
Is it a perfect simulation or is there....bugs
I guess all of you forget about dreams?
This explains why the socks keep disappearing\n\n\n*Server*: deleting cache files\n\n*Server*:\nFile detected: *Socks_file.exe*\n\n*Server*: Deleting file Socks_file.exe\n\n\n\n\nNo? Only me?\nOkay.....

What if the Christian god and angels, are the aliens that are simulating us?
U can never test
i just feel depressed now
not so long ago, I was so confused and inundated with endless philosophies, there is nothing worse than to live the life of a philosopher. A philosopher is someone who in his pride seeks enlightenment, while refusing instruction. His pride is suppressed sadness, because he failed to find someone greater than himself. He walks the world as an orphan, because he abandoned the teachings of his Father. He finds weakness in the ignorance of the meek, but fails to realize that God uses the ignorant to humiliate the prudent, so that no man may presume before God. A  philosopher dies a philosopher, with a big question mark in his tomb, because he never found his answer.  Everywhere he looked he found vanity, because he boasted in his mind and threw away his heart.. vanity is the opposite of purpose, knowledge without application, existence without utility. He who does not live to serve, does not serve to live.. \n\nBrethren meditate on the Word of God. Read the New Testament, read about the life of our Father Jesus Christ. Accept him into your heart and life and he will reveal himself to you. He is the almighty God, our loving Father. He created the universe, the heavens and the earth, everything that exists was made by him. I used to be a lost philosopher in an endless search for the truth, this search almost took me to the grave.. Until one day Jesus Christ revealed himself to me.. He is real, God is very real, and he loves all of his children.\n\nIf you are a philosopher, this message is for you... \nA mathematical problem is solved using the mind, a  poetic love riddle is solved using the heart, and a potentially dangerous gas leak is detected using your nose..  \nEach unit of consciousness has a different and unique domain of perception, all serve unique and different functions. All units must work in harmony in order to discern the genuine, from the illusive...\n\nPhilosophy comes from the mind's perception, Faith comes from the heart's perception.\n\nSo why are we searching for the Spirit of God with our mind instead of using our heart? Just because the eyes can't see thunder doesn't mean thunder doesn't exist, and just because the ears can't hear lightning doesn't mean lightning doesn't exist. All units must work in harmony.\n\nJust like your eyes can't hear thunder and your ears can't see lightning, neither can your logic perceive what your emotions can.\n\nListen to your heart. God is very real. We have numbed our hearts and pushed him away from our lives.. be of humble hearts and seek God... Allow me to make it easy for you brethren...  \n\nJesus Christ is God, seek him, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\n\nCall on God with a humble heart and he will answer, you will see his light, and hear his voice, and feel his Holy presence. You will witness the very essence of God's undeniable existence, Invite your Father Jesus Christ into your heart and I promise you, you will never in your life doubt again,  because you will see for yourself, that he is the one and only Truth, and there is no other God beside him. Brethren, leave this world of destructive new age philosophies, this world will take you into chaos and oblivion, you will fall into the snares of the devil, insanity will consume you...The world is against God. Flee from this world of evil and look for the light. Everything is full of purpose, God has a plan for humanity, and has a plan for each and every one of us. The Father will bring judgement into the world and will sever the wicked from the just. He will reveal all that was hidden since the foundation of the world. peace be unto you and to all whom the Lord has called, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.

6:25 missing of in the text.
The question this video is trying to answer is a question stoners would ask.
How would the computer know we were looking at atoms, molecules, or anything invisible to the naked eye. For all it knows we are always looking at everything invisible to us. So, if it is always simulating everything that we can't see. What's the difference between that and an actual physical world? Who cares about 1 in a billion if the 999,999,999 are all basically the same as the one physical world.
So...  this is quite a new thought experiment that has gained much attention.  And you have done a pretty good job of explaining some of the very basic philosophies of the existential crisis it can cause for the non-science people.  But don't fret.  As Dr. Tyson would probably say, We got this.  (Apologies to Dr. Tyson, but hey, he actually friended me on FB after meeting him at the great planet debate for a couple of days, then realized this guy is a nobody and I was quickly unfriended.  At least I get the street cred for saying I was unfriended by THE Dr. Tyson...  But I digress..)\n\nThere are valid, deeply mathematical, physical, and cosmology postulates being debated deep in basements and cluttered offices of the current Hawking generation of quantum physicists - some with scary possibilities.   One I personally like is the Heisenberg quandary.  There's only so far we can go down to in our current theoretical, experimentation, and observation  capabilities.  The more energy we use to smash particles together at CERN, the more weird things get.  It is starting to appear that the higher power of our proverbial microscopes, the more granular the quantum foundation of our universe looks.  No more linear somewhere between X and Y that our Newtonian world understands.  Position and momentum are stepped with no in-betweens.  Hmmm. Someone threw out the possibility that these could be the smallest limits of a simulation, similar to the highest number of digits our computers can handle.  What if the Heisenberg quantum states are the minimal processing limit states of this massive computer you speak of?  Similar to just how much an i7 processor can handle, what if every quantum particle state in the universe is actually a dedicated processor register in this theoretical simulation?  (string theory, for example - my Apologies to Brian Greene for my poor attempt that may butcher his excellent explanations (I'm only a lowly engineer - but a very curious and happy one  :)  )  This is an intriguing idea that the biological processes and physical world we live under ARE ACTUALLY being simulated at the sub-sub-sub atomic levels, and therefore we are actually blobs of proteins and lipids evolving FOR REAL in this simulation.  Seems to me a lot of trouble to cover conscience awareness of each being if you can simulate the real universe down to whatever the real truth is (23 dimensional strings vs 10 dimensional, closed vs. open, vibrating vs. whatever)\n\n The same argument you made for the very big, Godlike civilization would also apply to this thought experiment.  But there are already some heavy hitters on it.  Several publications of proposed tests have been written, and are quite entertaining to even this lowly engineer.  (But still a science geek).  My personal favorite so far is the holographic paradox.  How does this quantum-level simulation stand up to what we know of black holes, where quantum fails? (Still working on that unified theory thing).  If we are a simulation, an outsider would see it in n-1 dimensions.  Can they observe without affecting it?  \n\nBut that's where my feeble attempt to understand cosmology becomes something like Roy Batty wanting to live a few more years.  I go into a depressed nihilism mode where I don't have any friends to discuss this over late night, fire-lit, drinking evenings.  Seems to me this simulation is doing a good job of trying to kill us with asteroids, radiation, GRB's, genetic defects, and not to mention several thousand megaton fusion warheads (each) pointed at each other with a hair trigger of nervous and tired command and control crews.  I personally don't like the aging thing.  Would be great if I could get a second degree for fun and learning instead of putting food on the table...  Biological decrepitude is getting in the way.  But I digress again.  Nice cartoon BTW!
Change the fucking name lads
Get the fuck off my simulation, Jake
Y'all think the sims think this way?
All of these videos absolutely changed the way I think about the universe
Burned my house down, i can say there were no glitches
Donald trump is the glitch and the virus.

Clara is so damn good at her job
Gotta shout our the pretty and well spoken, chocolate goodness, Clara Amfo. Never seen her before but glad I'm seeing her today.\n\nAs for the interview, being a big fan of Hov, I've never been the biggest fan of Jigga when he has spoken in interviews over the years but I liked the way he sounded here. Very introspective and the logic behind his thoughts were pretty dead on. \n\nGreat interview, all around.
I just realized I haven't heard him speak before? lol
‚ÄúHave you got anything written down?‚Äù .......you don‚Äôt know jay z very well lol
The üêê himself!
I feel bad I stole a lil episode - Jay Z on Game Of Thrones
This girl is good well done Clara
Clara is very beautiful AND a great interviewer!!!!!
Clara is an amazing interviewer, Always really knows the projects of the person she interviews, genuinely cares about their answers and doesn't make anything awkward or cross lines by asking things too personal. :) loved this
I really love Clara, she always listens so intently and is so keen, she obviously does her research and gets personally close to the music beforehand and has relevant, interesting questions. Love seeing these interviews!
Jay is intellectual and from an early age knew exactly how to promote his image to the world. He is an icon in my eyes.
JAY-Z top 2 DOA and he's not 2 üêêüêê
Shame he didn‚Äôt do a cover tho
I'm a fan of Jay Z, and i must admit this interview was great, wasn't just about music but also talks about the other Shawn Carter. Flexible interview well done
What a legend
444
These streets school us to spend our money foolish.
Great Interview but Clara you shuda known that Jay doesnt write shit down. He does it all in his head!
I think Jay is finally being the artist he‚Äôs always wanted to be. He‚Äôs clearly stated in his music that he sold out and made pop records on purpose. ‚ÄúI sold 5 mil and ain‚Äôt been rhyming like common sense‚Äù I know it‚Äôs early but this album will be looked at as another classic in his catalog.
Jay-Z bought a lot of project buildings around Brooklyn just to give back to his neighborhood and the rental rates are much lower than the government rates. He doesn't make any money out of it after all costs but it's simply a caring gesture for his community.
14:47 I'm surprised all of you sheep didn't catch that. Well..actually, I'm not surprised. He's trying to justify a burglary. If I'm being oppressed and you have this big nice mansion with all of this, I'm coming inside there. That's gonna happen, that's just how life is.\n\nI have a better idea Jay Z, let's break in to your home, rob, and beat your ass because as you like to put it..that's just how life is..........smfh.
Her skin is glowing!!!!!!! Radiant as fuck! Beautiful!!!
Can't believe he declined to perform at the SuperBowl, I always envisioned him doing that.
Wonderful interview. I have so much respect and admiration for Jay.
Keep doing what you're doing Jay Z. Many have so much opinion about what you are and what you are doing.  Until you are no longer here only then will the world and us as a people ( black ) overstand your importance. \nPeace my brother
All U pervert guys luv him\nHe sold his soul to d devil and he got twins this was done by the Satanic ritual\nHis a devil\nSatan worshipper facts
Is Jay-Z doing a duet with Angie Stone?
Ego yeah all you fools feeding into satan spawn, this guy is a Freemason and part of mind control with crap that coming out music industry! Don't touch real artists like Marley Hendrix. Bb king Dylan Clapton. Just a piss take with and samples other tunes. BLM BLACK ON BLACK CRIME IS BLM FOR YOU and black always resist most of time are thugs anyway. All bunch of pricks to me.
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!\nI LOOOOOVE that Jay-Z watched the leaked GOT episode like the rest of us!
Yeah... lol this is a sophisticated person that I want my 6 year old listening to...\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=jay+z+middle+finger&client=ms-android-att-us&prmd=ivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjkqMPS-rrWAhUM4SYKHf83CUMQ_AUIESgB&biw=412&bih=652&dpr=3.5
definitely you can see the condensed jay z...
I'm on the side of right. I don't have no alliances to anything that's not on the side of right. lol
Some people are just made perfect, example jay z
this was wrong that was wrong let's move own
When things are darkest, light is on it‚Äôs way.
Im so glad that they used a reg title and not a headline title
Peace in the name of Christ. Somebody please get the following short vid in front of Jay Z: https://youtu.be/pFb0Xu2xJYg
I figured he was still working #noHaircut = #AlbumMode
Capitalism and freedom read the üìöbook
Can't concentrate when this guy talks.
historical some agent store rent heart alive respondent dog.
Lol i lost my 444 album CD , now im bootlegging it . I have every right to do it . Especially after what i just heard
Jay Z ‚Äî I have no idea what that show is \nJay Z ‚Äî I think I've been on that show, yeah, yeah
everything he touches goes platinum
*7:04** to **7:34* respect!
Pure inspiration.
obama ass licker
Barrs
üêêüêê
Marcy's very ownü•É
Spits truth

Hov üôå
Jigga jay z
yet another great jigga interview
Goat...üòçüòçüòç
All hail king Hov üêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêêüêê
Y'all think small I think BIGGIE
Great interview
Big up Clara.
We won't see another interview with Hov in a long time. Appreciate this one! The greatest of all time Jiggaman Jay HOVA!
We can't afford any mistakes at this point
Fuck Jay Z- Ether Voice.
2027
AMAZING interview
Nice speech üíôüéµüé∂üé∑üé∏üé§üá¨üáßüá∫üá∏
Never thought Jay never an introspective human being. He solidified that in this interview. He just cared about himself, that's how he got to where he got to. That why Nas won that battle, but the idiocy of America let Jay won. Nas has always been the better hip-hop artist, the free styles and human soul survivalist. Jay, always has love from me, but Nas is always King on that battle.
Clara grinning bare teeth
I'm telling this for just to people know that this guy may look like humble and shit in front of camera and shit but he isn't this deep shit is a pedophile, satanist and a part of that illuminati shit... some people may not believe I will tell them to look things up..
She must use a lot of cream for her dry skin and that hair wow how bad must some1 feel with hair like that
He just gets better with age!
I'm guessing Hov was here for the Basquiat exhibition.
Damn Clara is Fine! With a capital F!
He is here to be on the right side yet rapped at a Hillary Clinton campaign, errrr ok Jay, obviously doesn't know much about the Clinton Foundation, background and crimes!\nAnd then basically says its ok to rob people with mansions, so next time anyone sees Jay its ok to rob him, what a moron!
Give the man a glass of water he keeps apologizing about his voice...
G.O.A.T
They say if you love it you should let it out its cage & fuck it if it comes back you know its here to stayüëÄ
Never seen a ceiling in my whole life Yeah, of course Jay Z's 5 year old daughter wrote/freestyled that. Jay Z is my favourite rapper, but damn this man talks some shit!
Waal love this tune so much.. thanx Jigga
GAY Z
Chipmunk cheek asshole
Great interview. Well done Clara!!
https://youtu.be/VDvr08sCPOc
HOVA
Great interview
Enjoying this interview
Legend üíØ
Thank You,smart men
was waiting on a question about chester tbh
Mr potato  head
Damn that black bitch is ugly as hell !
Hes fucking adorable
With all that money and he can't even fix his ugly face?
I just realised I've never actually seen what Clara Amfo looks like. I can now categorically say she looks as annoying as she sounds.
j-z do you have any guilt for selling poison to your people?
Shame the album isn't that good though. The one he did with kanye was his last great one.
jay z you're a legend but please stop talking bout politics cuz you know shit
interviewer is fucking shit

I love the bobble hat and travel mug, but I don't live in the UK so I can't get hold of it :(
It said five minutes ago and I was like I HAVE TO WATCH THAT
Kendall is so Boring and Un-inspiring...
Now I have a fucking headache
I love this song!!!! ‚ù§
so beautiful way too good and worship!
Did they have to edit it like that because Kendall can't dance?
When you find out about the rewind and forward buttons for the first time and think it makes everything looks cool.
I like the song, catchy, specially the Fran√ßais part but why put candle gender on it? I think that's tacky and low although I must admit it's a clever marketing plan. They could've used someone with class though.
I prefer her in black eyed peas
I love this song¬°¬°¬°¬° ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I cannot stop listening to this. The beat is so catchy. Loved it. Thank u Fergie.
Can someone smart explain this weird video üòë
This should obviously be her next single

Fergie has gone downhill so far since album #1, that now she cannot even give her tunes away for free. So sad.
I love this huge boomerang <3 :P
I love this song
Imagine if this video was just Axls voice and Kendall dancing around
For those wondering - Axl Jack is her son.
I really love the song and kendall is amazing, I think the effects are great too, but it makes me feel a bit, uncomfortable? I don't know how to explain it but yeah, is that just me?? Probably is. Great video anyway ‚ò∫
Who watch this because kendall?
I love this song and I think Kendall is the only one out of that mediocre family that I can moderately tolerate.
THIS IS THE MOST ANIMATED I VE EVER SEEN KENDALL....LOL
This song is so good! i like it a bit better then all of ur other new ones but still keep up the amazing work fergie ;D!
I‚Äôm obsessed w this song and video ‚ù§Ô∏è
This video is like the boomerang application from Instagram about 1,000 times in a row!
those who give thumbs down i can only think of 2 reasons for dislike. A Jenner and bad editing.I like kendall but the editing made me dizzy.
i love Fergie song's ...üòöüíÉüíÉüíÉüíÉüíÉüíÉ
Kendall's modeling skillsüòç‚ú®üëåüíØ she did great!!
This almost makes up for the Pepsi Ad
This is the best song of double dutchess
I couldn't finish this. it's too much Kendall Jenner for me
Kendall, you were beautiful in this video:)
It's like playing the Sims
What kind of Instagram Boomerang is this?
This video reminds me of Dannii Minogue's You Won't Forget About Me, for the video editing effects (which are so annoying at times). The song is great though. And I couldn't care less for the Kartrashians, but if her appearance makes the younger generation listen to this song and Fergie's album, well that's a win. Because it's been 11 YEARS since her last album, and most of her old fanbase don't care anymore, sadly.\nLol at people giving her credit for having worse acting skills than Kristen Stewart by the way.
I can't believe people don't realize she is just a little boy, crazy what these rich people do to their kids. They transgender them at birth, no lie
Guys stop hating lol. This song is great without a music video.
nice to meet you too
Everybody in the comments is giving props to kendall and I'm here just wondering what hard work or work in general has she done??ü§î üòÇ
This video have me a seizure
Give the Editor a Fucking pay rise!! Asp honesty
just hand them a pepsi
I'm definitely having a headache after this video! Nice song though
kendall didnt do a bad job at all im just tryna figure out why WHY  besides the publicity why would fergie waste such an effective music video concept on someone else and not on herself!/!!??? damn shame
This gave me a seizure
What does she say in French and at the beginning
This video' s a fkn head ache, specially the start !
Looks like she used one of our vegan product for her face @corporesanctum
This should really be a single
I only come here because of Kendal

In love with this song. Good job Fergie. I'm buying this one.
Fergie should have picked a Fashion Model instead of a reality star.
This song/video is my new obsession. XOXO

Love it when a song pulls on your heart strings right from the start and doesn't let go.
My good days aren't even old enough to buy cigarettes
You know what a good collab would be. Mackelmore and singer of FUN. Or sam smith, or john newman. Look em up if you havent heard they are all a good listen
Damn macklemores voice is great, so balanced and kind of raspy
Got my new favourite song üòçüòçüòç
How is this hip hop?
Being I know it's just a music video but I totally think they look like a good ass couple
Such a lovely song that I ever heard! Good collaboration!
How could people dislike this type of music!?!
You might not TRULY UNDERSTAND THIS UNTIL YOU GET INTO YOU'RE LATE 30'S....
Anyone else after watching this, just really wanted to go have an adventure with friends???
Remember, teens and twenty year-olds of today. These days WILL be your good ol' days. Make the most of them.
The reference to First Ave hit me close. I'm an old club kid from the 1980s.
Did u know I farted 8 times watching this video....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic ü§§
They were some good old days üòè
Who's here cuz of kesha
Love the depth of this pop song. #longoverdue
Kesha looks so much better with some healthy weight on!
Can anyone tell where this video was filmed? I'm dying to know.
Beautiful, love the turquoise jewelry... And love the music
wow i used to like her as a kid.
Love the new album
Thanks for the reminder. What helpful words to get on the right side of perspective.
Loving this song?, enjoy the karaoke version i did on my channel!!! Greetings =)
Bruh why does he have to copy twenty one pilots... \n\nIf I see that quote in the comment I'm so done and I'm a fan of twenty one pilots.
Kinda boring I'm gonna be completely honest
Wow this is a really beautiful song..
kesha always looks like a magical fairy, i love her
Did I saved this music or this music saved me? <3
I want them to be togetherüòôüò≠
This makes me so happy ^^
Even though im tired of being a kid, its songs like this that makes me appreciate only being 15
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Macklemore, you're my inspiration. I love every song, but I love Glorious. The videos touch my heart. I hope you read this and or reply. From your biggest fan,\n\nIndichu. <333333333
I started to listen to Macklemore when I was 8. I'm 14 now. His music has helps em through a lot of tough times. I don't know what it is, but his music and his voice has some magic quality that I haven't found any where else. I love this song and hope he keeps it up.
The pop of repeating the same verse and the rap of saying whatever threwout the verses... but everything was flat... no emotion... its just boring.
I have know words.. really. Amazing. Glorious and now this masterpiece. I am blown away.
I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. Someone should write a song about that
This video is absolutely gorgeous. Kesha's voice is amazing when paired with him too. 10/10
I love this song so much. It's just so beautiful
This is music. This is what we need! The video the singers the song all perfect.üíü
[Chorus: Kesha]\nI wish somebody would have told me, babe\nSomeday, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\nSomeday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of these good old days\n\n[Verse 1: Macklemore]\nI was thinkin' 'bout the band\nI was thinkin' 'bout the fans\nWe were underground\nLoaded merch in that 12-passenger van\nIn a small club in Minnesota\nAnd the snow outside of 1st Ave\nI just wanted my name in a star\nNow look at where we at\nStill growin' up, still growin' up\nI would lay in my bed and dream about what I'd become\nCouldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be some\nNow that I'm here, wishing I was still young\nThose good old days\n\n[Chorus: Kesha]\nI wish somebody would have told me, babe\nThat someday, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\n'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of the good old days\n\n[Verse 2: Macklemore]\nWish I didn't think I had the answers\nWish I didn't drink all of that flask first\nWish I made it to homecoming\nGot up the courage to ask her\nWish I would've gotten out of my shell\nWish I put the bottle back on that shelf\nWish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought\nAnd felt comfortable in myself\nRooftop open, and the stars above\nMoment frozen, sneakin' out, and fallin' in love\nMe, you and that futon, we'd just begun\nOn the grass dreamin', figuring out who I was\nThose good old days\n\n[Chorus: Kesha]\nI wish somebody would have told me, babe\nThat someday, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\n'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of the good old days\n\n[Verse 3: Macklemore¬†& Kesha]\nNever thought we'd get old,¬†maybe we're still young\nMaybe you always look back and think¬†it was better than it was\nMaybe these are the moments\nMaybe I've been missin' what it's about\nBeen scared of the future, thinkin' about the past\nWhile missin' out on now\nWe've come so far,¬†I guess I'm proud\nAnd I ain't worried 'bout the wrinkles 'round my smile\nI've got some scars, I've been around\nI've felt some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now\nThose good old days\n\n[Bridge: Kesha]\nYou don't know what you've got\n'Til it goes, 'til it's gone\nYou don't know what you've got\n'Til it goes, 'til it's gone\n\n[Chorus: Kesha]\nI wish somebody would have told me, babe\nSomeday, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\nSomeday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of these good old days
Never liked Kesha, but damn I'm loving her now.
123k likes and 1k dislike\nthis music is very good..
Why does YouTube always recommend this kind of stuff right after a breakup?!?!
This isn't music. It's art. Amazing. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ So proud of Kesha.
I love this song \nI love this music video\nI love Macklemore \nI love Kesha \nThis is amazing
I have been waiting for this video! I love you guys SO MUCH. Your music makes me feel ALIVE.üíú
Kesha & Macklemore.... LOVE for people and treasuring each moment comes beaming through in this video.... thats my tribe !
EPIC AS USUAL #MacklemoreForLife get me out dark Depression!!
THE PERFECT COLLAB, IM IN LOVE
What a peaceful melody. Amazing song!
I think Kesha has came a long way since the beginning of her career. Her voice has grown and I appreciate her using raw untouched vocals which is rare in today's pop genre. She may not be number 1 or the biggest star but her unique style sets her apart from the rest of her peers. ‚ù§
Wow.  Beautiful!  Kesha, you are a Gem!!
Please Collab with Eminem
This sucks...
Wow kesha looks so different..
Macklemore looks like Clayton from tarzan
Macklemore has beautiful music videos. Kesha has beautiful music videos. Together?\n\n\n\n\nInstant nut
She sounds like this, WTF
Ayyyyeeeee Minnesota represent!!
Love this !!!

EVERYONE IS THE MURDERER
The mustache is ridiculous. Poirot would have never worn such a monstrosity. David Suchet got it right.

what is it rated?
Another movie ruined by the idiot Johnny Depp.
The black guy did it.
Another worthless remake of something that was already done. Let's do something Original. Just show's lack of talent and imagination.
Does anyone know the name of the mustache who is wearing Kenneth Branagh?
The butler it‚Äôs always the butler
This looks so good and I can't wait to see it in November! Plus I love the remix of Believer!
Sergei polunin in this is all I need
Josh Gad and Leslie Odom Jr?? Daisy Ridley and Michelle Pfeiffer?? Johnny Depp and Dame Judy Dench?? guess who's going to see this movie
Who could have guessed that a bitter divorce would make Johnny Depp become a great character actor?
DAISY I GIVE YOU MY HEART
i'll watch this for Daisy Ridley...
I saw Brando in there.
Whoever decided the music for this trailer needs to be sacked
I'm looking forward for this movie! But it's a pity that Johnny Depp plays the murdered...
Adventure Time Mystery Train episode got a live action XD
I'm gonna have to buy the book now
Nice to see the only black guy in this trailer get killed ...some ole Hollywood
Looks nothing that the novel ...
00:29 i see a black guy here aka the doctor... i hope that scene is not the crime scene because it will spoil everything...
The best part of the book is the page that contains the map of the train :)
Looks like Anderson style has influence people!!
Does anyone know what this is rated?

Its always the Butler
IT WAS THE BUTLER!! ITS ALWAYS THE BUTLER
I love a good sleuth üïµÔ∏è movie!
im glad I read this so long ago I dont remember who the murderer is
Johnny depp looks old. It‚Äôs like Michelle pfeiffer is having a ball with this role.
Hugh Grant isn‚Äôt in it anymore?
A good ole who done it movie
I've never watched Clue, but this kind of gave me Escape the Night vibes
Finally did the trailer justice. That first cut was a joke.
When you already know who killed the guy because you've probably read the book or watched the older movie
They need to change the ending. One of the most unforgettable endings ever in the original story
The Butler did it.
I think the train did it
You can't fool me, that's McCree's riverboat/gambler skin
I know who the murder is already! I figured it out within the trailer. LOL!
The butler did it.
Now THAT is a mustache.
Oh my god I'm reading this book for english this year. THANK YOU GODS OF LAZINESS
Is that background music 'Believer'??
Too bad about the overplayed music.
The music choice is still awful for this film, but it looks pretty good so far.
I think it looks good, but stop us by that music for your trailers! It doesn‚Äôt fit at all and it‚Äôs just annoying
I love how they took Agatha Christie's books into movies, so far there have only been show adaptations. If only they made ... and then there were none.
Remember what Dwight said it is some one you least suspect but Most Suspect So they are in the middle
Assuming this is the movie adaptation of SpyParty, KILL WHEELS
stop putting music that barely matches the movie, u ppl did this in the last trailer for this movie too
Too bad this can't be an interactive movie, where they give you a list of suspects and a small notepad at the theater to jot down clues and make assumptions. Before the ending, they pause the movie to have everyone vote on the suspect before the big reveal. I love a good murder mystery.
Nobody is better at Hercule Poirot than David Shuchet!¬†And that mustache.....is just...wrong.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcdbyFzZHHY
So many good actors, but we all know at least that Judi Dench is gonna be AMAZING
this looks gooood! I'm sure Johnny Depp will ruin it...
I clicked this because it reminded me of that Doctor Who episode..
Spoiler : the butler did it...
EVERYBODY IS THE MURDERER
*when the polar express takes a wrong turn to the hood*
For a minute I thought imagine dragons believer was the background music,imagine how nice it would be though!

And there is a PARTY going on in my mouth! Ben you're such a dweeb in the best way possible.
Chorizo James... perfect name for a luchador. Career change? ;)
This is why they bully you, Ben. Because you loudly proclaim about parties in your mouth.
I see mac & cheese, I click. Simple as that.
Before summer ends *everyone is wearing jackets*
How are you not all fat by now? Tell me your secrets!!
I'm so happy James is in more videos! Love these kinds of videos, I can't wait to go back to London.
I've liked this video but really its only half a like cos Mike's not in it. hashtagteamhuttlestone
Hahahhaha can't stop laughing how in this video Jamie widens his eyes everytime he's talking üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I was in London earlier this summer and NEEDED THIS THEN. y'all are killing me with all these London recs, when I'm NO LONGER THERE TO TRY THEM.
Am I the only one or is umami Ben's favourite flavor
for a theme week you guys should really do a cheap week. and maybe for a battle give each of the guys like 20 bucks or something and get them to actually shop and create a dish.
Sooooo who is organizing the Sorted Food Oktoberfest meetup??
Ben sometimes sounds like a wife. James being the husband
hey i just really enjoy how furiously ben said theres a party going on in my mouth!
YAS JAMES YAS
I got distracted in church by this\n...
Fellas, I'm sure the food is great there, but it looks like a mall food court. Wanna go to some great looking rooftop bars -- try Los Angeles.
Beach on a rooftop??? Sounds cool üòÅ
‚ÄúCentral London‚Äù.. Brixton is zone 2. üôÑ
I just saw an ad of this place on this video XD
Erm.... if it‚Äôs in Brixton, then it‚Äôs certainly not central London. It‚Äôs South London. Please don‚Äôt confuse people. Thanks.
Thank you for the suggestion. Will definitely keep them in mind when I visit London next year!

Jamie... come by Indonesia for super spicy food!!!!!
I don't think I'll ever tire of commenting this;\n\nTch oh - ree - thoh\n\nI don't care how you pronounce the rest of the word but please, PLEASE  use an English th, not a z. Thank you. 
James hopping over the bench and saying 'i'm very tall!' honestly made my day
U lads ever gonna actually get back to cooking again?
Yum! Thanks for taking me along on that great lunch trip! :)
wasn‚Äôt it mike who made the ‚Äòand there‚Äôs a party going on in my mouth‚Äô comment?
That place looks super cool!
Good to know James is at least willing to enjoy less frilly things occasionally.
First 20 seconds Ben it's A What??!?
YOU GUYS!  I'm seriously loving all the outdoor/on-location stuff you've been doing lately.  It's really been so fun and interesting, getting to see more of where you live and the places you can get to, seeing as how you're in England and all.  I've been a subscriber for a long time and I love the channel and you guys to bits and can't wait to see what's next! :D
Love this video, it's also my birthday today I'm 20!!! üéâüéâ love u guys üòòüòò
GUYS GET A DIFFERENT CAMERA MAN AND GIVE MIKE MORE SCREEN TIME PLS
my mum went on a complete padron pepper bender this summer. honestly sick of them now, she just took it too far.
You guys should check out GrubMCR! They are amazing, and such a great vibe. I've been there about 5 times. Look them up on instagram :)
Shouldn't an Oktoberfest be finished by the time it is actually october?!
God Did u see Jamie munching on that pepper!! he grew up in my eyes!
You should really make your own version of stuffed naan, for example nutella, pizza, cheese and sooo much more
You should do the same thing at Pergola on the roof in Shepherd's Bush!
Please go back there for Oktoberfest!!! If it's authentic food you will love it!
oh god, why am I watching this when I'm just about to go grocery shopping and I'm already starving. There's no possible way I'll make responsible decisions.
I love the exiting things you see and do. I would like to go there if I go to London again. Cheers!
Slightly disappointed that it wasn't called mac and chorizo.
I love whenever you guys do a food adventure video!
Man if I took a shot for everytime one of the lads said umami I'd end up in the hospital,
Am I invited to Ben's party?
For a second, I thought Ben called James a dick\nturns out he called him ridiculous\nclassic bennuendo
I see Brixton has been gentrified.
There is no spice in this what so ever!!! Dying
I'm not so lucky, so I have to take your word for how amazing it was.  Not that I could afford it, or afford going to London from USA... I can't even afford to go to KC, and you were there recently.  I laughed that you had taken my advice, though.  Not JUST my advice, I am sure you had a LOT of people tell you the same thing.  I liked that you did the bit with the fountains.  I shared all those videos you made in KC, hope they got you a few more fans.
4:21 we love you Ben XD NEVER CHANGE
Jamie's hair reminds me of a certain dictator...
Always looking for exciting new places to eat, brixton has so many hidden gems when it comes to eating outüëèüèº
I really enjoy this concept of testing lots of food in one city. It changes it up a bit ! :)
The thing with padr√≥n peppers is, as the saying unos pican y otros no which mean some are spicy and some not. The funny thing with eating them (aside from being really delicious) is that there's the chance that you get a super spicy one and makes you want to die! :D
Thanks!  What a treat!  Loved the critical commentary.  Wish I could have been there!
So this is great and all, but what if you don't have much of a kitchen or a kitchen at all, how are you going to make mac and cheese? I'll tell you how, go to my Mac and Cheese recipe on my channel. I'll teach you to do it without even having to boil the noodles.
Oh my gosh, you were in Brixton?!?
I thought this was gonna be a video on how to make charizo Mac and cheese but I'm still not disappointed.
Ben... I'm sure people would love to join your party in your mouth or wherever(I mean house) now that you've offered.
Sorry Ben, once you put it out there there's no taking it back... Party in my mouth üé∂üé∂ sing it!
really like these types of videos! keep it up boyssss~
I've GOT to visit London! British food isn't just Bubble and Squeak! I'm drooling!
Jamie's laugh üòÇ killed me
Am I the only one who noticed that Ben has a beard and moustache starting\n\n\n\n\nOnly me? Ok
Ben is the Harry Potter of Sorted...
 pimientos de padr√≥n, unos pican, otros no. that's what we say in Spain.  padr√≥n peppers, some are hot, some are not. That's the funny thing, u never know if you will eat a super hot one but in general they are really tasty and mild.
loving that james is getting more screen time
I want to hang out with you guys! Some incredible sounding food! Could talk about them all day!
is it wrong I said 'helloooo' same time as Jamie.
James is a legend. More of James in the future please
Ugh. London is just one huge pretentious hipster paradise :/
wtf is this shit lol
Padr√≥n peppers!!! üòç
pimentos padron, uns picon outros non <3
Do another shocker recipe
Where's Barry?!
Watching your vids always ways cheers me up!
Bens two favourite things:\n- sprigs of mint\n- umami (oo-maa-me)
Chorizo mac and cheese...I'm weeping.
again KAAK WARKA make it !
Macarrones con chorizo de toda la vida bye
Ben's 5:00 shadow goatee is lovely
Padron peppers omg
Food.
mac & cheese wins every time!
*The BOURGOIUSE*\n\n\n\n\n\nhowevr u spell that

Ben, you can't just take that sentence back! As per the Chinese idiom: ‰∏ÄË®ÄÊó¢Âá∫ÔºåÈ©∑È©¨ÈöæËøΩ, once you've said something, you can't take it back :>
Loving all the James and all of the exploration videos!!
I miss the OLD sorted food..... I'm a foodie and is here for the recipes and not the show.....
I am confused... titles says mac & cheese, but video is of chili cheese fries...
Do padron peppers ever have heat?!
Your channel never fails to make me hungry üò©Thanks!? Lol
Few beers deep were you boys
you are heroes....for 37 years!..... cause we're lovers....that is the fact!\nthank you for the bottom of my heart
Ooooooo Legendary Depeche Mode! COOL!  Dave Gahan He's great! He's the coolest person I know. ‚ù§ That is still a Great song, and it's a perfect ballad!  ‚ô™ ‚ô´ ‚ô© Bravo! ‚òÖ
I'm from Ecuador üá™üá® DM The best band in The world ...
MY BAND!!!MY HEROES!!! THANK YOU!!!FOR EVER  AND EVER MY ONLY ONE LOVE!!!
How tf did people willingly dislike this ?
Beautifully done.  I really hope DM stays at it for years to come.  Genius musicians who were always ahead of their time.  So glad Dave is stronger than ever and fought through his darker days.  Still does I am sure but he is an inspiration to those who suffer with addictions and mental illness.
You are the heroes üëçüëè
I knew this song will be my best since I heard second 1 intro‚ù§ I love depeche Mode
We miss you david bowie
This song is better without watching the video.
Amazing hearing it Live in Austin!
Nothing could have prepared me for Depeche Mode covering David Bowie
Absolutely adore this...Thank you, Depeche Mode, for honoring such a brilliant artist.
Gahan's still in good voice!
I'm stunned. Wow. This is so good.
In love of DM since a long time üáπüá≥üáπüá≥üáπüá≥ Tunisia
It's been a few comments since someone mentioned this, so I will do it now: This was the song that Dave sang to indirectly audition for the band. He was singing it at a jam session with another band as a guest, and Vince Clarke (and possibly Martin and Fletch) heard him. The rest is history.
Great cover though wasn't expecting less from DM! The guitar sounds amazing.
Power on! Finally, DMs back again!
That's rare I like DP guitar so much
I remember early 80's when I was 12 and knew only few English words but this song hit directly to my heart. This cover is a own like, in good way.
Well... Guys - I'm impressed.
BEAUTIFUL! I'm crying here!
is the 2029 t-shirt related to the ASI theory?
251 people with no sense of taste
Depeche Mode, you guys have been hero's all of my life.
a great tribute from dm to david bowie,rest in peace
Dave is singing brilliantly!!! ... into the hair dryer :D
It just feels so good,so good it soothes your soul.
Look how he handles The microphone. This versi√≥n Is beautifull.\n\n If David God would be alive, he will cry as when Morrisey cried when he saw David singing I know its gonna happen some day
Amazing cover from an amazing band
WHY did they had to change  lyrics, Bowie's original fits best
much better than the U2 version
They should release this as a single!!!!
Thumbs up if Richard Spencer brought you here from twitter..... lol
264 idots don't have sense of music
David Bowie would be so happy to hear this and I‚Äôm sure he would approve! This is THE BEST COVER I‚ÄôVE EVER HEARD! X
And it is because of this song that we have this band. :)
Dave definitely put 200% into this.

Dave Gahan is purity
Superbe !! et Dave Gahan, cette classe, c'est dingue
es hermoso‚ô° como todo lo que hace DM‚ô°
No entiendo a la gente que le da no me gusta 
Amo a Depeche Mode y es una linda versi√≥n del tema de David Bowie, pero igual me sigue gustando m√°s la versi√≥n local de Richard Coleman (Fricci√≥n, 7 Delfines, y la versi√≥n con Cerati....) https://youtu.be/5CrfIL5sSSQ
absolutamente explendida version ,  vamos DM los esperamos en Argentina !!!
Que gran tributo, Grande Dave
Excelenteeee una de las grandes canciones de David Bowie
Gracias DM , nos vemos en Stgo Chile el 21 marzo 2018!!!
Por eso heres unico depeche mode le ases homenaje a otro grande el mudo deve de estar orgullosos de tener a una banda como tu depeche mode eres grande por siempre depeche mode .devoto
BON SANG !!  Dave Gahan plus il vieillis et plus sa performance vocale est magnifique.
David Bowie himself hat das net SO gut gebracht ! AMAZING DAVE GAHAN ! His best Song ever ! Brillant !!!!!
Dave kommt an David nicht ann√§hernd heran

Heroes, es la canci√≥n que le abri√≥ las puertas a Gahan para integrar Depeche Mode. Hoy 37 despu√©s de ese casting, lo interpretan juntos. Que mejor homenaje a Bowie, que mejor homenaje a ellos mismos.
Dreaming of me deluxe
Excelente para una fan√°tica de David Bowie y seguidora de DM...
sucks big time David would approve, and Dave stop holding dick in your hands its a microphone
Who needs that?dM covering sb else? WTF?! Once I heard that I thought YT skipped to different song;it does NOT match their level, it is rubbish!
at depeche mode music did not become interesting!monotonous sound! disappointed! your sound was not interesting!Return back to 80 x!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Incredible. There is more reason to this song selection than most know. Not just their admiration for Bowie. Prior to being Depeche Mode, when Vince Clarke discovered Dave Gahan, he was singing this song at an informal jam session and they offered Dave a shot in the band based on that! Deep historical roots for Depeche.
It's a nice composition of sound!
Obviously rubbed off on the lads when they were growing up?......Nice.
*I‚Äôm still alive, if anyone cares...*
Anold its so funny

I don't mind all the animated torture and shit, I've seen that countless times in Tom & Jerry and worse, but the way the narrator talks about Arnold just seems way too shitty. Like, the creator relishes in being awful.

I enjoy this, it gives facts in an enjoyable way
I love this channel so much
He lost a finger every episode
what if arnold tried to survive a tornado
What if Arnold goes to a level so deep in the ocean that the pressure makes him die? (or no)

My god I just love Catherine, she's always so happy and just likes and accepts everything! We need more people like her in the world.
bless you Catherine for being so damn nice and giving me hope there are other accepting older folks beyond just my grandma
Catherine is my favorite person on this show ever. She is so beautiful and understanding. I love that she just loves everything and everyone.   She is an inspiration.
If you can't enjoy RuPaul's Drag Race, then figure out what is wrong in your life.

GO BACK TO PARTY CITY
Honestly this was a great idea to expose this particular generation to this show. That said I did hear alot of closed mindedness from some of the elders (not all) . Forget about the drag part think about the masses of people that can relate to the stories and how much positivity it has brought to the LGBTQ community via education on the real stories that happen and how Rupaul himself has helped all these individuals succeed in their lives and because of Rupaul hundreds of Queens currently have successful careers and can provide for their families. Also not to forget how many people that have taken their own lives for not being accepted. Now they feel like they have a voice in the real world (people going through the same thing) . I have more to say I'll just leave it at that.
Catherine is so nice!
This is my first exposure to this show, and I honestly want to watch more
Elders react to Cardi B Bodak Yellow
Cathrine:OMG RUPAUL. Same cathrine   That's how you should act when you see momma ru

I like that drag shows do benefits for charity.  That said, my brother did drag and I met many drag queens when I was young.  All of them were very self-centered and lived to create drama.  It was entertaining to watch but not to be involved in.

*What was your favourite of these 10 amazing goals? Let me know in the comments!*\nFollow me on *Facebook* where I post my old videos that have disappeared from YouTube! https://www.facebook.com/LilWizProductions
The Giroud goal has to win it for me.
I'm just imagining internet going full troll and the trophy going to 2:49 chick goal
swear that chilliean teamis always scoring long rangers.They at high altitude or something?
Definitely the gk scoring double kick at the end of the game
hurtado goal was beyond fucked what the hell
Did not know 16 year old girls could kick that far
It's gotta be Mandzukic, but so many wonderful goals. Thanks for the compilation!
Mate, you don't know how to make a bad football video, I love the emphasis on the commentary.
boateng or the goalkeepers is the best
Either boateng or mandzukic for me
Wtf that girl amazing stunning the goalkeeper
Why there is Matic goal? Great goal but not special.
Amazing so much choices
Boateng's is the best, but I want to see Dembele win üíö
if you change Mandzukic goal's commentary to Tony Jones...
Reported
maticcc
That's a dislike
Why is Mkhitaryan not nominated
Any more replays?
Stop playing each clip for like 1 30 faggot
Hey, everyone! I'm Liam, the creator of this video. I've been working on this one for a heck of a long time. I hope you all enjoy it. Special thanks to Julian Eggebrecht, the founder of Factor 5, Inc. for letting us share footage of WeFly for the first time. If anyone has any questions about the video, please let me know.
Factor 5's employees should start kickstarter. They would be one of the very few that I would support as much as my wallet would let me.
They even lost out on the chance of a great pun title .... Pilot'wii'ngs
Why is series so heartbreaking? Why are all the actually good sounding games cancelled? Why is the game development industry so cruel?
If you've seen some other episodes of Unseen64 you already know how its gonna end when he says Factor 5.
Why is this making me want to cry? I would have been so happy if it this came out, and it deserved too, but it didn't and I never knew
Drinking beer at work, I'm jealous.
Honesty this game seemed way too ambitious and probably would've flopped had it saw a release
I want someone to leak what they had of the game on the pirite bay or something. I would love to download and play this
Factor 5 was the best, fuck Disney for ending them
why is everything you talk about on this channel in regards to factor five? There's nothing wrong with it just a question lol
oh Factor Five you are and will be missed
Every time Factor 5 is on this channel, I end up feeling sad.\n\nWe lost so much when Factor 5 went down. It is a damn shame.
Factor 5 were awesome! RIP :(\nSame for Criterion software.
And Factor 5 continues to be one of the biggest gamedev tragedies.
That thing with the IR Glasses is the one that I was expecting to see if the 3DS had it but looks like it doesn't have it.
As someone who loved the flight mini game in wii sports resort i would have loved WeFly
So... Is this video about Pilot Wings or Factor5? Title could use a change...
PPLLSS REMAKE IT ON THE SWITCH
I've been into flight simulators since I was a kid, so this legitimately disappoints me that this never became an actual thing. I LOVED the 'Island Flight' minigame in Wii Sports Resort and have also put some time into PilotWings Resort for 3DS. \n\nMan, I wish this was released...
Ah, the injustice of capitalism. An incredible passion project brought to an end by a lack of money, as always
Is it just me or when he says Factor 5 it sounds like Fuckto Five? xD
WeFly would've been the only ZOO digital game I bought.
I just get depressed everytime I watch a video in this series. So much wasted potential
Factor 5 seems like such a smart studio.  I really wish they could have survived their financial issues.
A game that processes local weather/time of day to simulate the world in real time? It is a *travesty* that these guys shut down, that's an awesome feature.
I wanna play this game
We need people to try and finish this game somehow. Yes, many features will be made redundant, but it looks too good to be left to rot. Someone needs to get in contact with people from Factor 5 and somehow conclude development on this.\n\nIt is such a shame.
If anyone remembers the one-off series, Go Vacation, on the Wii -- I've always thought how Pilot Wings (and also the Wii Sports universe) would be like if the game was similar in approach.
At 2:20 He says porn instead of port may wanna do somethings about that!
F A C T O R 5
These videos always make me sad.
Personally, my favorite gaming studio of all time has got to be Platinu-\n\n\n\n\n\n*F A C T O R F U C K I N G 5*
The weather thing surprised me. Small and creative.
It's painful how WeFly was cancelled so far in development. It would've been one of the coolest Wii games ever!
I swear the stories in unseen 64 is like a modern day Shakespeare tragedy
someone make a game like this for Switch! it looks fun!
That potential is actually depressing I‚Äôd love to have played that game
I would‚Äôve loved this. Pilotwings Resort was one of my favorite 3DS games
Do a Marvel vs Capcom video already. Smash Bros got several!\nAnd please DON'T only focus on the recent ones
Is this guy's accent partly Welsh?
I wanna play it so bad
Wow, wefly looked like a phenomenal game! I'm sure I'm not the only one who would have played a great deal of it, I loved the free fly mode in Wii sports resort!
This game definitely seems like it would've been a lot better than Pilot Wings Resort.
fuck I'm so sad that it was never released
God I miss lair \nI would die to see a sequel
Man .. i would have loved the game. Great video.
Factor 5 was awesome and I love these videos
1:33 Aaaand there's their first mistake.
Best soundtrack in video game.
Jim Moore has a desk full of alcohol at 5:50. Someone felt they needed to blur the Jack Daniels bottle.
no that is a shovel ware game
Where are the staff of factor 5 right now?
seems like lucasarts is often the deathnell of ideas when their dealing with other studios then themselves.
I can't be the only guy who really wants a Pilotwings game for Nintendo Switch. It could combine a ton of new areas to explore with Wuhu Island and surely take advantage of the Switch's HD features. I hope it becomes a reality. Make it happen, Nintendo!
Every fucking episode of unseen 64 has something to do with Factor 5 were they cursed or something?  God damn!
that head tracking thing is kinda cool, probably the first time I've ever really seen 3d since I can't see it normally
That's so disappointing... sounds like it would have been such an ambitious Wii game with some of its best highlights.
I always found that idea a tad bit crazy. End exclusive partnership with Nintendo, who are we going to chase next? The ORIGINAL xbox, a console that didnt fair that much better. I say a bit crazy because, the idea of breaking apart a partnership and not going to Sony at the time seems ludicrous. Yes, weakest system sure of the big 3. Massive install base.
the factor5 starwars games on gcn  had 60fps... now its 2017 and 30fps are normal... i miss factor5, wizards of gcn
It is truely saddening to know that a game like this was being made for the Wii and no one will be even remotely likely to enjoy what there is of it. This game is one that I know I would have loved to death, and it's truely sad that it and it's developers never got the success deserved for such a feat on the console.
Goddamn this could have been a watershed moment for the Wii. A game to appeal to the casual and the hardcore alike.
Geez why does Factor 5 end up getting dragged into so many of these unreleased games x.x
Man, I miss the Rogue Squadron games...
This Johnny Chung Lee guy was on to something with that improvised VR headset. Truly ahead of it's time.
Damn. I still like that desktop VR tech. I hope somebody manages to do something with it someday.
Nintendo needs to scoop this up, slap a Nintendo label on it and release it on Switch. Make it happen, Reggie.
damn, im looking at the video with starwars and then see a video of lair and im like damn starwars graphically look better. Gamecube hardware was crazy. imagine if more devs took advantage of that hardware.
I see this series loves Factor 5
To be honest this is one thing I would pay good money to play
Why did this technology never catch on in any other video game?  Ya it would have probably costed the consumer a bit more, but surely it could still have some use somewhere.
Why have Factor 5 had such bad luck making games? I swear, every time you make a video on this channel, the cancelled game was headed by Factor 5
Factor 5 should really release a build of this. It looks beautiful and feels super realistic which makes me want to play it so badly
This game would have been amazing
Unseen64‚Äôs channel = the history Factor5
That's too bad, it would've been a really cool game.
I would love a new Pilotwings on Switch with some of the open world type aspects of WeFly....BUT, I'd also personally prefer a more unique & creative world or even a Nintendo World to fly over/explore. Imagine getting to fly by Peach's Castle, Hyrule Castle, Corneria City, a Pokemon Gym or the Big Blue race track. Or unlockable vehicles like an Arwing, Samus's Gunship and the Falcon Flyer. I loved both 64 and Resort, though I still can't wrap my head around the time limit in Resort's Free Flight mode....give us an open world with true free flight mode and I'm SOLD!
Pilotwings Resort was so underrated. Not a ton of content but it was just so relaxing. Amazing soundtrack and atmosphere.
Too bad :( I would have liked to play this game. It looks cool.

Defending: 27\nThat's Lovren\nLooooollllll
8:17 he said vitesse and he's a Chelsea player predicting his future...
get mendy please he's 78 overallüòÇ
Make sure you start as well üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Vuj your a G,Igor Biscan on his back hahahahaha love from Croatia
Honestly, I am being honest one of the top personalities in football. Him and Sturridge are top 2. I would put Sturridge top though as I am a Liverpool fan and I am not being biased but I have just seen him use his personality more, compared to this one video with Mitchy. Haha.
Lol with all the shit this man chat on Twitter I don't believe this. Thought he would be fluent in English.
Aren‚Äôt people from Belgium meant to speak good English?
Are u guys trying to win the league and champions league\nNo there trying to get fucking relegated
He definitely tweeted after seeing his card
Fifa and chill with son heung min
benjamin mendyyyyyyy we want it now
This dude is tripping. Honestly nothing special. And I'm a Chelsea fan
Awesome to see footballers getting more interactive, be it with the game or people on Twtitter.
He is bit like drogba..good personality and funny
If DRI stood for driving Marcus Alonso would have a 0
Delusional lad. Should get off twitter and put his head down if he wants those stats because he can easily get to that level. says a lot when ur known more for ur twitter banta than ur actual proffesional day job
He‚Äôs a straight up baller
Hazard would be joke on fifa and chill
Haha look on the bright side, atleast you're higher than Rashford. üòÇ FIFA always get it wrong, man should be 82 at the least.
The thing that annoys me most about copa 90 is everyone in the comments trying to talk like poet and vujanic because they think it will have a better chance on getting on comments below.
Does vuj realise he speaks with the accent of whoever he's talking to, even though he speaking English, going full joey Barton üòÇ
FIFA 18 rating is a fucking joke. Like seriously a fucking joke
It's funny how these footballers always overrate themselves, just shows that in their direct surroundings there are only people that kiss their ass and are never honest to them.
Hold on am I missing something? Is he not Belgian ???
he seems like the only real footballer irl he swears when his pissed any other players would be scared for there deals
Favorite player on Chelsea believed in him the second I heard he was coming to Chelsea
No wonder he don't play, can't speak fucking English , then again, with Chelsea you probably won't get in if you're English , they've got like 2 English players, most of the squad probably can't speak English lol
It's funny because he's actually shocked that he's shit..
Go to the Ravens and Jaguars game tommorow
Got a bit disappointed that he only spoke French who else ?
Do with Liverpool players
Poet probably spends as much time with Vuj as his wife.
Diego costa in the starting lineup? üòÇ
Wait so can he understand and write English but not speak it ?
Passing 59 haha I laughed so hard when he saw that
Batshuayis friend runs his twitter account for those of you wondering
0:47  Make sure you start as well LMFAO
this is the 1000th video ive like n my channel :)
I'm not English and I can confirm it is quite easy to write but the pronunciation is hard because it isn't the same!!!
Poet doing the typical British speaking to a foreigner tactic of just talking very slowly.
Died when he said fucking shit for pace loooool

Hi Poet &Vuj, Batshuayi is almost as funny as you two. Please get Pep Guardiola next. Love the show.
Vuj bare wants to laugh when his just chatting in French üò≠
If morata is an 84 sitting on the bench all season, this guy should be an 83 at leaat
French is a dope ass language lol Batshuayi is the man. Chelsea fans who dont rate him should look at his goal to game ratio. Top notch. And he barely ever starts. So how would you know he‚Äôs trash
Pretty sure he from belgium
At 0:50 Poet says make sure you start as well  then takes off his glasses ... üòé
i laughed so hard when both of them tried to go to team management and then both if them try to go back and they just started the game #relatable
poet you could do with some more random shit on your wrist mate
I support Liverpool, so I will choose Everton.
Mitchy sick hattrick against forest

Batshuayi will get 20+ goals this season.
Lol he deserves 65. Hes utterly useless at Chelsea
Kim needs to F-out of kourtneys airtime always wants the attention on her
YOU CAN CUT THE SEXUAL TENSION HERE WITH A KNIFE
Scott was telling the truth. Its been all over tv how she loves him when he's bad and when he tries its not good enough. That's why she laughing. Realest man on the show üòä
God I think Scott is so hot!!!
scott is so hot .But she seems like a nag
Scott shut Kim up with the quickness üëèüëèüëè
The way he shut kim up was amazing!!
Scott is funny as hell..
That hoe gonna come back when she want to have another baby. Y'all know he aint nothing but a walking sperm bank to her anyways
Where can we watch the full interview?
Scott so cute as he ages
I think that they have such a genuine love and connection with each other but, Scott has probably hurt Kourtney way too many times that although she wishes he'd change..she knows it's never going to happen. I honestly haven't seen anyone make Kourtney laugh and smile, and bring out a different side to her like Scott can. They are so different but there's so much love there. I believe that Scott has no real direction and his energy is misguided. He's a grown man and still hasn't matured yet! I don't believe he's found the therapy he's honestly needed. He needs someone like Tony Robbins to coach him honestly and I can see Scott transforming. Once he's found who he is and learns to become whole within himself, and learns how to be in a monogamous relationship, who knows what could happen. I loved them when they were together though.
Lmao It is true what he says. He treats her nice and she gets bored and it happens so women like the bad guys i have done that and i get dumped when i am too nice
Scott shut Kim all the way down üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæ
Scott is cute to look at, but when he opens his mouth- its like STFU.
FAKE tit family. They all have FAKE boobs, lips, and butts
When They called out Scott Kourtney moved because she wasn't right there
If Scott would truly get his life together..and be a Man, and if he stopped messing around with 19 year olds maybe he and Kourtney would have a Chance ü§î
The Sisters Of Satan strike again! This time around Scott Disick will turn into a woman like you know who!
I ship them so much
Kourtney only smiles that big when Scott's there...that has to say something
I lo‚ù§e you, Scott!!!!
PLS kill all the Kardashians stop for tv
Hmm wasn't he just pap'd kissing 19 year old Sophia Richie and Bella Thorne (also 19).. they're younger than Kylie ffs and now he is here saying he still tries to fk with Kourtney. This man... üò©
She still looks in love with him....
Only the kardarshians would have a set like this üôå
Hahahaha scottttt
GRADEAUNDERA *loves* this lot..\nThe Kardashians..\nLol... https://youtu.be/_qu3F3cZjC4
Kourtney is so pretty
Get back together!!!!!!!
Awkward
Now Scott found a new girl to date
Kour is classy!!! She's the best Kar
I love how real Scott keeps it üòÇ definitely my all time favorite person on the show
I use to hate Scott Lol. But I think they r so cute together
Wow. He's not lying. That's how men get us sometimes. I'm happy she's moved on.
We all can find this kind of relationship almost everywhere. \nLoving each other but can't be together.

Thank you Scott for shutting KIM the transvestite up !
Scott is sick of Kim I'm sure
As much as I dislike these folks, I think this one is the most normal of the bunch. She looks natural and normal and a bit like me. And it's true that women are attracted to broken guys. Especially women like her who grew up seeing nothing but dysfunction.
Scott Disick is a wanker. Why are they laughing and patting him in the back for his bad behaviour ?  He abandoned his kids & kourt a hundred times to get drunk and sleep around. Now he is sleeping with Sofia Ritchie who he watched grow up as kylies friend. Its disgusting.
Man this is so awkward do I need to watch it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Scott is telling the true and she hate that shitüòíwe all know she fell in love the fucked up Scott not the Good Scottüëé
Scott: I try to fcuk once a week. \nLmao I believe him too üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Why Kylie is not there geez
Its crazy how much people like scott with her. Hes always cheating on her. Im so glad she left him
Majority of long term relationship if they make up and break up many times will never be the same as it once was..too much history and bad memories even if they're being adult about the whole situation now and co parenting their kids.. have loved for each other but not in love things just isn't the same anymore ever again.. speaking from experience üíØ
Scott: can we let kourtney talk??\nAlso scott: *starts cutting off Kourtney wehn she's trying to say something
Will its Sarah guess o what no its kourtteny
I COMPLETELY Agree with Scott!  I think they are too cute 2gether, I miss them 2gether, just wish Scott cud get his addictions under control and also not cheat.
scott is nigga in a white persons body
KUWTK actually sems interesting for once after watching this
theres still something there for sure it shows the way they looked at eachother
I relate to Kourtney.. She is the oldest and realist of the bunch. Watching her family woes playout seems more realer than anyone else on the show.
She looks great especially after having all those kids :)
Why do you ask them theese questions? It's personal, you can see on Kourtney that she was not so happy about it. RESPECT PRIVACY!!
I've always thought Kourtney was the prettiest one, even at her shadiest annoying moments. She is strikingly gorgeous and doesn't need to try. She's a natural, but with fake boobs üòÇ
Scott is right he is telling the truthüí™
Why do minorities lead prostitution and destruction of morals??!
They both look great. Scott looks healthy
The separation doing scott good he actually looks better than when he was with her
Scott is my favorite! He's a savageüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇalways making me laugh üòÇ
I understand that Scott has made some mistakes, but Kourtney is pretty hypocritical. For example when he was dating Bella Thorne, Kourtney was disturbed by their age difference when at the same time she was dating another man with the more of an age difference (way younger than her). Everyone thought Scott was a sicko but no one criticized Kourtney. They aren't healthy together, but Scott is at least aware that he's messed up. Kourtney doesn't have the faintest clue of how messed up she is because of her entitlement and that's even worse.
Yea,vi would agree with Scott on his point but I still love them together üíñ they both look great
Lol Scott to Kim can you just let her talk! Way to go Scott!!!!
kim no one was talking to you
One of the most cringiest interviews of all times
I love the fact that Scott is so real. But he isn't right for Kourtney, I feel she deserves someone loyal just like everyone else.
We already know they fiina be back together. they just need some time apart to do their own thing with different pope. But they're clearly meant to be together. you can seeeee it. not to mention they look hot af together.
I never noticed how beautiful Scott is wtf
I love scott hott
Scott is looking so hott!!
Haha Khloe looked so shocked when Kim opened her rude mouth
Shes so hot

tf is X doing in this song
holy shit xxx‚Äôs voice when hes not rapping is so smooth and good kaksna
This is horrible, I'm sorry. She really can't sing. X is the only reason this is remotely listenable.
The song sounds like her sister Miley Cyrus helped her compose it the song Miley Cyrus was saying about Liam pretty cool
The post Chorus with X and Noah both got me like üò∑üî•üî•
They both killed this! Nice collab ü•Ä
X part is the only reason i like this song. Even the beat sounds better during his part.
Be careful with your voice.
Lol her career is over
XXX made it to Vevo at least
D O P E N E S S
Did she say stole my dick ? Tf
XXXTENTACION didn't come out cause he shaved his eyebrows off and bleached his hair

Bro I ain't ever in a million years think I'd be slapping some girl music haha. Nope look here I am went from gangster gangster rap to whatever this beautiful masterpiece is. She has such a memorizing and soothing voice
Bro x is one of the best singers regardless if he is singingüî•
X part almost brought me to tears damn...
I was waiting for xxx in this video
OMG XXXTENTACION IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SINGER
I've always hated Miley Cyrus and came here for x. Noah is way better that Miley
X is a completely mentally retarded shit, but this was üî•
Who came to watch the video just because xxxentacion was in the title
I feel like it tried to be a great song and wasn't a genuine great song.  You know what i mean?
Idk why I thought this was gonna be trash
Is she related to Miley?
Only here for X
Only popular because x is in it
Who watching after beating their meat
Damn the auto tune on xxx part is real ffs.

X is such a try-hard with his look and his ‚Äúpersonality.‚Äù I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, he‚Äôs trying way too hard to be deep and ‚Äúgrunge.‚Äù Lame. LOL.
I actually love the lighting of this video! The conversation is casual and very real, so why would the lighting be overexposed and unnatural? It looks like they're having a girls night in together chatting about makeup, which makes the viewer feel part of the conversation. Well done to you all! xo
Answers all questions with her products üôà
My three role models in one video.....wow!xx
Love how it went soo smooth nothing awkward such nice ppl!‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh gosh, her makeup is way to expensive,  there is better and  way cheaper makeup out there, I can't stand her,what a joke!!she thinks she is high class!!
I LOVED this! So lovely to see a nice chat instead of a scripted advert!
Three of my favorite ladies! I adore Victoria Beckham and her designs. I especially love when you talked about your kids!
She seems unable to just answer questions , royalty eh !!!!!
I never knew Victoria was friendly as she always seemed snobbish.
Nic. Girl. Please. you gotta lay off putting the contour and blush too far into the interior of your face. Otherwise you just keep on being awesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
Twilight teaser was a Rimmel  lipstick  I had one!
Thanks for the interview girls! Three amazing women!!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏èüå∫
I wonder if the Stygian gloom was a request from Victoria, so the viewers can't see her properly. Couldn't watch to the end, I'm afraid, on account of this and her facade. I don't have any aspirations to buy her collaboration with Ester Lauder.
Although I have watched many video's reviewing this new product line, I appreciated the personal and authentic interaction with the creator. Very nice.
I think that Victoria Beckham is absolutely fabulous and a all-around Class Act. I do wish that not all (or nearly all) questions led back to makeup, but hey, this is what the interview was supposed to be about.:)
Love you all and i love Victoria make-up collection stunning to look at. Xxxxxxx
WAIT I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE TWO OF THEM wtf
Blooming love the women!! Yes she smiles, yes she is nice! Big fan ‚ù§Ô∏è
Really enjoyed this interview!!! Never seen Victoria look so at ease, lovely nice to see.\nLove the sound of the mascara too!\nWill have to purchase if its anything like my holy grail sumptuous extreme üòç
Best footage of Victoria Beckham by far. Relaxed, fun, natural.
Too much Class, Beauty, women goals:! Victoria is seriously a Godess, shes amazing, if I had money I would buy alll her makeup line, but sadly :( cant afford it, but still Proud of you:!
PACKAGINGGGG!!!!!! Thank you for caring for your customer ! I hate those high end brands did those cheap ass plastic or cardboards packages even sometimes they do not put a mirror for god sake it is a mirror! so thanks again beautiful collection beautiful interview
loved it ladies :) this is great, well done x
Such a nice video. Thank you. And Victoria is a real inspiration, I really admire her. Really loved this interview.
Love this and love Victoria üòç
Loved absolutely everything about this video ‚ù§Ô∏è
She is such a beautyüòç
Honestly this is such a great interview, great job!!
Weird. Didn't answer the first question on the first makeup product she ever purchased but then goes on to say that in the first meeting with EL there was an entire table of makeup she has collected since being a child. ü§î
LOVE how she swerves the beauty icon question. Because she is her own beauty icon!!! üôåüèºüíÅüèª
Love Sam and Nic, love Victoria! Fab, inspirational ladies üåπ‚ù§Ô∏è
Loved this video!! I could watch you three all dayüíóüòÅ
Hands up if you're going to watch This Is 40 right now
Victoria is so natural and down to earth. LOVE HER!!!!!!
I love Victoria!!! Great interview! Thanks :)

I really like the lighting in this video. I have an app on my phone to make the screen even darker because youtubers always over expose. My eyes are very sensitive to light. Lovely having a dark video to look at, much more soothing.
Beautiful lighting and wonderful interview ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you ladies ‚úåüèº
Boys wear make up too.. just sayin' ‚úåüèº
OMG I love all their accents! üòçüòçüòçüò≠üò≠
It was really  nice to see Victoria so relaxed and at ease. She was very kind and lovely. I wish the lighting would've been a bit better and that we could see the products more up close though! Thank you so much for this wonderful interview!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Nic, your nail colour is AMAZING. May I ask what you have on? Love your videos ladies! xxx
Oh, how I love this British accent... Can listen to you for hours :-D
Three of my favourite women ‚ù§Ô∏è
I do love Pixiwoo when they interview people.  It always comes across as ladies having a good chat rather than just questions being answered! Xx
Hmmm VB obv doesn't get the word icons she's clearly done it all on her own üòÇüòÇüòÇ...dont think so!
So happy to see this! I know she's promoting her products but she really is an interesting and hard working lady. To have a solid marriage, lovely children and such success in the fashion and beauty industry and look so amazing all the time! You two smashed it! xx
Such a joy to watch!
This is incredible, girls. Loved this chat, so casual and felt natural, I loved watching it! x
When I went to Buckingham Palace to get my OBE, I wore this blue over black liner... more interesting. oh, please...
LOVE you Vicky!! Def going to support my girl and have ordered some of the collection, its had such great reviews. Really enjoyed watching you 3 girls talk, can't wat for more #pixiwoochats
i love victoria beckham so much!!!! just wish her collection wasn't with estee lauder...
I'm pretty sure Victoria always decides which side she sits on.
I love Victoria. I think she is such a classy lady but I struggle to find her personality. On interviews she is constantly talking about David or her kids but very little about herself. In this interview she was asked about her favourite music but she replied with what her kids listened to and went on blabbering about it. I know she loves her kids like every mom does but I wish she opened up more about herself rather than talking about David and kids all the time. It makes her look like her only achievement till now is she married a famous guy and had kids with him.
Haha heather shimmer I had that too
Come check out my Scottish Beauty channel! This weeks video is my high school make-up. üíìüíãüíÑhttps://youtu.be/i3qgrq7c_cg
Wow-incredibly real stuff here. Not just one big ad. I respect her & you both, tremendously.‚ô•
I'm so, so happy your doing these videos too again. The two of you are great in interview sits, and I love watching you as much as I do your awesome subject! Your killing it, as my granddaughter says! Lol!‚ù§Ô∏è
Victoria is such a girls girl - great interview x
You are all such beautiful women!!! Great time watching!! I would have loved to see more makeup use and tips and tricks! I LOVE makeup!!!
Love love love. You are 3 very inspirational women and I only expected it to be a buy it now video. Loved the natural setting, honest Q&A and the human touch. Could have listened to you all for much longer. Although I'm the same age I still have no idea about makeup and having a disability means most days makeup is the last thing on my mind - I desperately want that to change after watching this and want it all. Fab x x x
Her voice is soo relaxing, imagine her reading bed time stories üòç
How ironic is it that Brooklyn has moved to New York
I loved this video seemed so honest and effortless!!!
Nic getting a bit fan girl there üòÇ
This interview is fantastic. It's such an intimate yet still lighthearted look at all three of you and it was certainly a privilege to watch. Thank you!
She‚Äôs so nice!!! Xxx
she seems so easy going and down to earth! <3
Classy, stylish, and brilliant women! What's NOT to love ?!!
I wonder if Victoria maybe misheard the question about the style icons or kinda started with a thought and then forgot the what the question was üôàüòÇ because she doesn't come across as rude or too self centred, she was happy to chat about things other than makeup. Ever been in an interview and had to buy yourself some time to think of an answer but end up forgetting what the question was - I have üôãü§∑ no biggy! All 3 ladies looked lovely!
Sam,Nic,love the questions that you asked were real and not practised.the price point of the collection is above me,but good on her for formulating a great Collection.xx
beauty,brains and ambition she really is perfect.
I love all 3 of these ladies!! Victoria Beckham is my style icon!!
Victoria seems like such a lovely person! Great interview x
Love love love. Well done ladies x
Great interview, Victoria is lovely. When they ask her about her beauty icons, and she answers what she wants... hilarious, she sells well her products. I love when she talks about her kids.
This was so real. Well done Sam and Nic. You two were so open and natural with her, like chatting with friends. Victoria is a classy, humble and down to earth lady. Wonderful interview - loved it!
I enjoyed this interview so much. All three ladies looked fantastic. It was such a treat to listen to Victoria talk about makeup. She seems very passionate and dedicated to her work. Thanks for bringing us this special treat.
This is such a great interview. Victoria is so natural (it really surprised me)  and you are truely respectful but friendly at the same time that you made it seem as if Victoria was the third pixiwoo and you were just there, hanging out, having a casual chit chat about makeup.\nSo good.
Why can't she make it more affordable for us working Mum's ü§î
What a gorgeous video! üíô‚ù§üíô
Heather shimmer yes!

Best Victoria interview!
Wonderful interview! Victoria is such a classy woman, I love her style and she seems really down to earth too
hmmm she's got a pre-rehearsed answer for everything. I get you have to prepare stuff before interviews but just saying things to hit those promotion marks and not actually answer the question seems disingenuous to me.
Has nic had a breast reduction? Would love to see a vid on her experience if so...!
carry on eating salads you skinny bitch
She didn't answer your question about who inspires her

two true masters of ventriloquism together! great presentation by Darci and Terry
How on freakin' earth can they do this!!!!Its amazingggggg. Loved it!!!!
2:53  *Drinks water bottle with the cap on*
Would have been better to have had Terry having a face microphone like Darci...
now wait a minite is this seame street or agt_
Omg, I just found out that she lives in my town and goes to a school really close to me.
They should have all past winners come back again to create a harder competition
I voted for Darci all the way. The right person won.
waiting for the fanfict of that bunny and turtle
fun fact: Selena Gomez can also sing while barely opening her mouth.\n\nüòÇ‚úå‚úå

Why does Mel B look likes she's trying to impersonate Storm?
From a distance he looks a lot like Bryan Cranston
Did she mess up the lyrics at the beginning?
That was crazy and amazing! That's talent! ‚ù§
No idea, they're talented
So proud of Darci lynne!! You're pure gold!üëåüòç
Darci Lynne is great. What an amazing talent.
Some day, Mirage is going to replace Terry Fator with Darci hahaha
After seeing her for the first time I wanted her to win! So glad she did!
WHO else got old school disney flashbacks from that duet!

Terry fator when ever hi is about to talk with puppet he puts his hand in his pocket like if u agree
I wish this would still be trending ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh wait it is
Congratulations Darci Lynne on winning AGT 2017!!!\nIt must have been really cool meeting your idol Terry Fator and Jeff Dunham.
What a good girl.
Jon cozart. All I could think of
I can say anything softer than you!
Did she mess up at the beginning cause she saved that really nicely
The girl has a gift. If she keeps this up she could be famous some day
SHE IS SO PRETTY! I wanna date her. But it will never happen :( She has the best talent ever!
Terry Fator was on my cruise ship in July he was pretty good üëç
Wow. She can sing like that even when her mouth's closed. What more if she opens it fully?!!!! Amazing!!! üò±
Ya know, it'd be worth flying to Vegas just to see her perform.
Simple Q&A\n1) Did she mess up in the beginning?\nA: Yes, it's a live show, anything can happen.\n\n2) Tech Issue?\nA. Human issue, she sang lyrics wrong and stop singing.\n\n3) Was votes affected by this mistake?\nA. Not at all. It's additional performance asked by AGT,\nand it's NOT FINALS (you can see which clip thumbnails with FINALS with it)\n\n4) Was these show all live?\nÔº°. No, Sara & Hero's dog training is pre-recorded drama,\nalso Preacher with Howie.
Is their microphone broken

2:22 my fave <3 Congrats to Darci, for winning AGT 2017 Season 12!
OMG Sing it girl\nGo Darci
YES I CAAAAANNNN
If anybody has any doubt about darci's actual talent purely as a singer go to 2.25. That was simply unreal! I believe she never displayed her full singing skills on stage because a lot of her focus went into the ventriloquism and general acting. But had she entered as a singer I think she could still have given Angelica a run for her money!!
1:46 you what?
YYYEEESSS IIIII CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
So wowwwww...nice talent
WHERE IS PAUL ZERDIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg petunias face when she saw Winston was hilarious
Shes so talented happy she won
Backdrop opens up. REVEALS SAME BACKDROP!
Amazingly hard
She forgot the words at first üò¨
*tHAT* IS FREAKING TALENT.
Hmm.  She's sweet and good.  But this just isn't winner material.  We already had a ventriloquist winner.  Mandy Harvey is far better as a singer, a talent and a story.  Sorry to say it, as Darci is a child, but I mean c'mon.  Really?
This is the best duet ever!
She messed up at the beginning
The Internet is going crazy over what this 14 year old wrote in her song about Charlottesville --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdHHyiZv5c0
Wow. This is just... bad.  This won a million bucks??  Incredible.
Yeah she's talented but smh im not happy that she won. Their was better talent like mike who sanged in the subway and wad in this show like whats so special about a talking puppet coming from a girl mouth
I know that the bunny is fake cuz the girl is moving her nick
Angelica was robbed.She is talented but come on...she flubbed this performance.
I like that she won but I don't think she was the best. Like she can only do one voice and her mouth is open slightly. I would've waited a few years before coming on the show honestly.
That was cheesy. And lame.
I find this a bit unsettling
I'm sitting here after reading someone congratulating Darcy, and people Called the voters to her Racist Why?\nBecause the other girl (Who I thought should of won too) was another race.\n\n\n Now, Not ever person is Racist\nYes, Racist people might of voted, but just because someone who was maybe Asian, black, etc. Lost to someone who was white,\n\n Doesn't mean that the voters are Racists as they might of thought Darcy did better. Respect what the voters choose or take your hate, Away from others who don't wanna see that.\n\n\n\n\n ~Mysterious Girl

So trash
It's fake
Booooo this is bad
I don't know why. ANYONE CAN BE TRAINED AS VENTRILOQUIST. There's lots of books and tutorials on how to become ventriloquist.
This season was probably the most disappointing, i dont think darci was the most talented, she moves her mouth way to much, messes up alot, and overall just lacks experience. I know shes young but its supposed to be the most talented person wins not the youngest person whos kinda talented
I'm sorry, I know she's talented and everyone loves her, but she didn't deserve to win. There were SO many better acts.
I love Darci but I have one question. Did she mess up in the beginning when she started singing??
How did she win? I know she's young and it's pretty impressive she's able to do this, but the other contestants deserved it WAY more. She was pretty amateur in her performances. I mean really, all she did was sing with a puppet, that's it...
2:41 Her voirce cracked\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to be rude.
Ventriloquists are honestly the worst
dont get how she won the competition
Angelica Hale is the real winner.
1:45 did she mess up?
you should make a video of trying girls gymnastics
Nile - Could you explain why a couch puts a pad across the high bar when you are practicing.

funniest and best one was Danny's
Loved these fails üòÉ I think my winner is James.

Voting for Danny that always fails the intro and almost killed the judges ¬†XD XD XD
Falling on top of the jugdes has got to be my favorite one lmao
Aw you missed the best part about purvis fail when the judge grabbed his thigh and wouldn't let go for dear life!  Haha
The one that fell into the judges was the best fail! üòÇ
Never clicked a video so fast

what age were you when you started gymnastics
Do you ever get told to stop filming whilst your at these places training ??
Why was Nile wearing a mask
What's the mask for that you're (Nile) wearing at 2:48?  Great videos!
Nile what are the biggest benefits of taking a ice bath?
2:50 what's that huge Bane-style mask thing?
hey professionalgymnastnilewilson does it hurt your biceps when you catch yourself on the parallel bars like you did at 0:32?
if the voice actress from the newer video game hadn't shown her tits on californication she'd be in this movie
Am I the only one who thinks this looks good?
Looks fun. I see the misogynists have checked in.
I'm not familiar with this new Lara Croft at all, I haven't even played any of these reboot new games.
I don't feel Lara Croft in her, I was low-key hoping it'd be Gal Gadot, this one looks like a teenage girl that spends most of her time in their school detention
The only thing that bums me out is of course, no Sam!
I remember when lara croft used to have nice curves
30 years old tiny Sweden woman playing 20 years old English student... Hollywood what the hell is wrong with you? This not just a miscast, this is bullshit!
Lets be honest.¬† The whole point of Tomb Raider was to have a character that's extremely sexy and with slightly larger than average boobs.¬† The actress in this movie is sexy, granted, but doesn't quite meet the Lara Croft standards.¬† That being said I like action movies with hot women, so I'd probably still go see it lol.
Looks really good, and Alicia Vikander is a far superior actress to Angelina Jolie. Plus the TR games didn't start getting good till the reboot so yeah all and all this is an improvement.
OMGOMGOMG\nI HAVE TO SEE THAT
All these people complaining about it being cliche, when that's the whole point of the remake in the first place.
Can't wait to see this! But they should have picked Angelina Jolie again.
I thought it would lara croft origins about survival like in the game instead this is bad game movie shit all over again
Vikander has big shoes to fill.  Angelina Jolie was hat af in this role.  See what happens.
*I see a huge flop coming..*
I would have liked to see daisy ridley play her
Wonder women and now this ! She'll be great! Angelina seemed to  be a bit  more bad ass but I'm sure this will be just as good!
She is not rocking that tank top
I like¬†Alicia Vikander ever since I saw her in Jason Bourne.
Am I the only one interested a video game series, and Movies based on her father? He seem rather interesting.
I can't believe how bad is this shit omg
Looks like this is going to be ab exciting action adventure! Looking forward to it!
Definitely needs more shots of her jumping in or around water.
My god, people complaining about the size of the tits, when in fact they've never seen a pair in real life...this is Wonder Woman all over again.
I'm just here for the comments.
she has quite large combat boots to fill...#AngelinaIsLaraCroft
Does she remove her clothing? No? Then I won't be watching.
Cum down guys! The next film she will have a money enough to do breasts surgery.
And the war between the rationals and the feminists has found more fuel in a shitty movie reboot
Going by the thumb nail what's this? Chick Rambo?
She is not Lara Croft looks nothing like her. Sad they are trying to make this into a video game wtf is wrong with them they should have used the person that they modeled the game after if they were going to make this a game movie they should have used Ellen Rooche bad casting at play here!
ugh, the cash out, trying to mix both of the new tomb raider games stories, with trinity as the bad guys from rise of the tomb raider, but put on the island of the first of the new series and the boat recreation from the first game
Remember that in the new Lara Croft video games, especially the one this movie is based on depicts an origin story. They are trying to make it accurate to the games so chill.
Is that the asian guy from into the badlands?
This will be bad, no offense but yeah. Also they could of found someone much better than this chick to play Lara Croft
Thank God it's not that nasty looking cunt hag from the last two disasters!!!
Disliked the second I didn‚Äôt see Jolie .
No offense but I still like Angelina Jolie‚Äôs version.  She looks fierce even if the story is over the top.  Buts it‚Äôs a video game story made into a movie so it‚Äôs expected.  Vikander looks good though.  She looks like she worked out. You can see her muscles.  I like the fact you can show women be muscular and strong and still look attractive and feminine.
The thing is people complained about Wonder Woman having small tits in the latest film but it wound up being a hit.  So maybe this will be too, but I wont be supporting it.  It looks wack...
Honestly, as bad as this does kinda look... I like their direction with Lara. The one in the new games is a little too vulnerable and kind of boring. This one has that vulnerability, but also a great bit of confidence. That's my Lara.
I liked the games, especially the newer ones... but I don't know if I like the idea of this movie, nor the main actress. I might give it a shot though. Idk, maybe I'll just do another play through on the games instead.
It looks just like tomb raider (2013)... And that was a pretty epic game imo.... Hope the movie meets the standards set by it
...Absolutely pathetic LOL...I'd rather lock a Butler in a fridge than watch this.
Wack ill just stream this for free
WHAT'S YOUR NAME ? ... The no-boobs new action woman.
Should have used someone who looks more like her. Hopefully this will not be another Batman vs Superman.
Flat chested Lara Croft, if you are going to make a shit movie based off of a video game, at least be faithful to the main character.
I was really excited when I learned they were going to re-boot this, but after watching this I'm so appalled, omg... it's going to suck sooo fucking much!!
Yea just show me the sequence, that's cool.
will I ever see an actress with some meat on her. Tired of skinny women pretending to be strong women. Get someone like Ronda Rousey or get some meat
the actress is is kinda ugly but still has that full of herself look, so i don't like this already.
Played both Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider. You can't compare games to movies, sure, but this trailer is absolutely rubbish. WB, this movie looks like a complete flop. Still, one can only hope for a miracle. Now, I'm going to play TR again just to get this bad taste out of my mouth. What the hell was up with that fake-ass, shitty CGI storm? Is this actually a parody???
This trailer borrows a lot from the 2013 video game, there's so many similarities.
BUTLER : A LADY SHOULD BE MODEST \nANGELINA/LARA : IM NOT A LADY\nthat scene is engraved in my mind\nI hope this new movie is by some miracle better than this trailer
its kinda more based on the 2013 xbox TR game?\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1797530/videoplayer/vi4004490009?ref_=tt_pv_vi_aiv_1
It looks promising, but personally I would've casted Kate Beckinsale as Lara.
Why does it look like they took half the plot from the 2012 Lara Croft game? Boat crashes, stuck on an island, they even had the plane bit in there.
But I already played this game and it was 94% falling.
she doesn't have the TITS or ASS to be lara croft. massive fucking fail warner faggots.
she is missing the iconic jewels of Lara , she looks as flat as a board
Too much BAD CGI. And that was just the trailer.
No, she's not Lara Croft lol
Yeah-no, this ain't gonna work. Warner Brothers are gonna fuck this up somehow.
This is gonna bomb so hard
Hope this movie doesn't suck like Assassin's Creed 2016.
I so want to watch this movie.
Hey, I remember this game! I think I'll go play it right now instead of waiting a year!
This looks promising.
Uwe Boll still making video game movies?
Alicia Vikander cosplaying as Lara Croft? You stole my dreams W. Bros.
Hollywood writing another remake , no origiinality anymore , no creativeness no talent , no skills no art fuck Hollywood MAGA MAGA TRUMP ,PENCE
Ghost busters remake?
seems legit. prob will suck tho
More hollywood bile?
Nope.

Screw this where is uncharted?
RICK GRIMES???????!!!!!!!
It looks terrible.
She doesnt look like Lara croft
More like Lara Rand
Wow
Doesn‚Äôt Lara Croft have big boobs? :(
0/10 Boobs not triangular enough
I'll be the first to comment a positive opinion and say I'm excited and lucky to even get another tomb raider movie cause I'm a huge fan, just hope it's good.
When you can tell the movie is gonna be trash just by the trailer. üñïüñï4.9/10 on imdb. Just watch. üñïüñï
Lemme summarize the comments:\n-People whining that she doesn't have big ass or boobs\n-Criticizing that this is going to be a bad movie\n-Saying that this is a bad trailer\n-Saying that Angelina Jolie will always be the best Lara Croft (I agree with this)\n-Saying that the casting is bad\n-Funny comments
I want the tits of Angelina !
1:27 he betrayed Leonidas!
Please stop
Where are the Frigging Boobs , blasphemy!
I have my thoughts about what the movie can and cannot be, but some of the major shots in this trailer look very low-budget. If this was done correctly you could undoubtedly have the successor to Indiana Jones, but from what I see it is just guns and the occasional jump over a large height. I expected a company like Warner Bros. to know no bounds, but I expected wrong.
Is this supposed to be like the new one that came out?
Continue the simulation by entering the Kurzgesagt Reality: https://youtu.be/tlTKTTt47WE
You're in a simulation, inside a simulation, inside another giant simulation
Your mcm thinks this is deep
This is depressing you wonder if you really exist and where will you go after you die
How can we have the ability to think that we are in a simulation if you are already simulated?
What about video and audio recordings? ...
Does it even really matter where we live? Created by god, programmer or just coincidence. If we have free will, use it to create a better world around you.
My dear jake... your German still needs a lot improvement, its Kurzgesagt not K√ºrzgesackt!^^
I think my simulator stopped loading halfway through making my junk...
lol i kept on wondering about this when i was little
Could the person programming or simulating me do something to make me stop the war? If your reading this whoever is programming me, Thanks.
So if someone kills someone, just say don't worry they didn't actually die it's a simulation. \nAlso, does this mean that there this a god/gods or a great creator/creators, if it does, then doesn't that defy most or some science this channel comes out with??
Anyone Remember that Rick and Morty episode
Omg The Christians are going nuts
We are all here just to power ricks car.
If were in a simulation... Why are we able to think we are in a simulation? Who is controlling us? Are we just brains in a jar? Being Expermented on? Would if Recarnation is just the results of our Last life, than we became a Animal or have a good life or a bad life when we die???!! WTF is Life!!!????!
Also can somebody just delete school and work already
Not science, but pseudo science. There's no null hypothesis. Just like the multiverse. Can never be proven, but I'm supposed to accept it as fact. Sounds like a religion.
@vsauce3 in order to prove or disprove this theory you have to look for what all codes carry glitches.
If we are in a simulation why did they waste some processing power just to give me nearsightedness and glasses
I wanna respawn as an eagle
What If the world was made by humans not nature
If the characters in the subsequent simulations starts making their own simulation, then the base system where the initial simulation is running will take exponential hit and will bottle neck at some point. So I think simulations inside simulation is practical only to a certain degree.
I am absolutely surprised the double slit experiment wasn't mentioned and this video. The channel riddle by far has the best video regarding this virtual reality/simulation concept.
Bruuuhhhhh, quantum particles are just unrendered until we view them.
Who else thought of Rick and Morty when they saw the title
So whoever programmed our universe was super detailed and precise and thought of everything.
It makes no difference if we are simulated or not; and that bit about the evidence either way possibly being simulated is a non-falsifiable cop out.
If you're alive right now, how do you know whether you've lived a past life before this or not? You don't...
I always wondered that what if we died but when we died we'd wake up in front of a game in Rick and Morty when Morty played that real life game in the arcade
No, you're inside a simulation inside a simulation INSIDE A SIMULATION!
If we were in a simulation who created the simulator and if the simulator(advanced people) is in a simulation who created them(infinite created people) and so forth; it is an endless cycle and could not happen. Infinity+infinity=infinity and infinity-infinity=infinity. Something has to have a beginning to exist and since infinity has no beginning and no end, then an infinite amount of simulations could not happen from nothing.
In the simulation hypothesis its obvious that our worlds programming is what creates out laws of physics and behavior, and not out atoms. The programmer of a video game would not code every single pixel in the game, they would just program objects with behaviors and properties. If us humans built a wall it would be impossible for our computer gods to have programmed each atom in it.
What game is that at 1.42?
Wouldnt the simulation have a failsafe to stop us from knowing its a simulation
What are the odds that i was listening to vangelis blade runner ost inmediately before watching a video that questions my reality and uses that same ost to emphasize that feeling. the simulators are getting lazy
Could we be in a STIMulation?\n\nAnyone?
that's not the complete story of the allegory of the cave, omitting the rest completely changed the moral of the story
The monks from doctor who are running our simulation.
Rick and morty was right WE LIVE IN A MINIVERSE!
I was thinking about this all my life!!!!\n\nAnd then Saw the tremen show,\nThen i saw this,\n\nNow I am scared
The universe is a mathematical structure, but surely even the original parent one would have to be? Or what if just as a simulation would lead to the events that would cause a simulation of itself (leading to further repetitions indefinitely), what if the same were true backwards and there is no true real universe?\nAlso, shout out to Susskind and the holographic principle lol
So the election was rigged by a rigged sim
Why wasn't I notified?????? A NEW VIDEO IM HYPED
So what happens if you would play the sims in the sims? Would it be possible to render in a simulation? If so what if you went a level deeper? Or another? Then at what point is it not rendered anymore? This truly is thought provoking
I do not like his pierced face...
You're worng about Plato's prison, it's been proven that at birth babies are not just a blank slate, they do have some knowledge of how things are supposed to be and how the real world is like.
Not a very good video
Does anyone think of the Rick and Mitty episode
You are always the most creative with your video effects.  I like it so much.
So we are in a simulation of reality, and are capable of simulating a simulation of reality? Sweet!
I think therefore I am. This was literally solved hundreds of years ago. Now make an original, actually interesting topic plz
If the world was simulated over again with the EXACT same start, would we be born, would everything ever play out the exact same because all influences would still be there
Nice West World fan theory. Keep it up!
If u didn't have any senses you would even know that you are if that makes since lol
If i remember right the allegory is by Sokrates and not Platon but then again Platon was his pupil. I might be wrong
Every layer of simulation must be less complex than the other. In just a few layers you would have simulated universes that are too simple to have anything resembling conscious beings. \n\nJust to simulate the Earth on the scale this video suggests, even when you only render things the characters can see, it would require an extreme amount of complexity, likely far outside the realm of what's physically computable. If you ignore that, and assume we can build a computer like that, then any simulation that emerges within the simulation we created would have to be less complex. There's no way around this other than making the simulation run at slow speeds, which defeats the purpose of an ancestor simulation in the first place. \n\nThere are way too many assumptions you have to make for simulation to be plausible, let alone true.
*Blames the simulation for his imperfections*
technically when Madden of 2k is in demo mode it's a simulation with free will.
Can the person simulating me press the ~ button and type ‚Äúmotherlode‚Äù about 20 times please?
What if we are an alien race and we are a simulation to test if our solar system was any good. Like they just run the sensor to scan all resources and run a simulation of their ancestors to see how they would evolve starting on earth. The simulation is super quick but to us it feels slow.
So, what you be sayin' is that after I die, the person simulating me will just hit *Respawn* ?
So from my understanding the meaning of everything and all us being simulated means that something from outside the universe whatever created or made the universe...is controlling everything we do...the universe is a Brain cell
That transition w pull effect from the desktop. .... man !
So What Is Real if infinite realities are simulated?
Michael Stevens has already covered Solipsism and the simulation theory
You videos are nice to watch but your pierces lol
we just read allegory of the cave in english
I should have taken the red pill when I had the chance.
If that's true then Islam is the Trojan that has a deadly virus killing us off!
This topic has been touched on over and over.
Sounded like Neil DeGrasse Tyson watched Rick and Morty's episode with the micro and miniverse that powers Rick's ship when he was talking about the simulation thing in the beginning.
READY PLAYER....ONE, TWO, THREE......INFINITY PLUS A GAGILLIONAIRE, AS PETER GRIFFIN ONCE SAID......GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY GIMME MONEY!!!!!!!!
What if we become advanced enough to make simulations like the ones we supposedly are then our simulants make simulations, it's simulationmania
Wait, there are 2 part 2s. Glitch in the simulation?
You're inside a Simulation, of a Simulation inside a Simulation, of a Simulation.
Solipsism is kind of a flawed concept, imho.
Would it be possible to reason what an afterlife would be like if we are in fact  living in a simulation?

They're adults, they're screaming like little Georgies, I'm 13 and I'm quiet as giant pennywise
I'd pay extra for a movie theater to have set balloon pops and physical thrills like this :D
funny if it was me I would have scream and then thrown my soda at him and tackled him
It's just the loud pussyass women screaming
The only creepy scene was the flute lady
It was not that scary....went home n slept like a baby lol but movie was good
We all float down HERE.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll float, TOO.
I swear to god if a nigga start screaming like a lil bitch at my theaters imma have to beat his ass
This movie was scary but these people are wussy lol.
the movie was amazing but not that scary. I flinched at a few jump scares but mostly i laughed cuz it was so funny. I don't think anyone in the audience screamed
Let me be he first to say that I saw the movie and it was actually really shIT.
It's not even scary üòÇ
I'm 7 and i w
Where i saw it no one screamed at all
Watched it today...it was shit...no plot...
Lmao this is so fake. When I went to see it, everyone was laughing at the way he runs, jumps, etc. Especially during the dance scene.
If someone sat infront of me whit a damn balloon they'd fucking float too
How are they screaming?! Like. The only time I screamed, was when I was laughing too hard.
It was a great film, but it wasn't that fucking scary
Mate. The only time a genuine and freaky reaction ever occurred in a movie theatre was when the exorcist was out.
These white people are dumb

I did not find this movie the least bit scary it was funny af. However, these reactions are true. People next to me in cinema kept screaming at every scene. Girls tend to get scared more easily I swear -.-
Does it show how he kills him ?
I haven't even watched it.... but this is on my recommended
It would piss me right off if i had to sut through a film with that lot freaking out & screaming like thatüò©
Well, I guess my voice was the only thing you heard if you watched the movie with me... *Screaming like crazy*
I would hate to watch it with these people
Tbh it wasn't that scary
I'm the only one who will not see this movie üëçüèªüëçüèªüò≠
dear god! that'show i felt when i saw the movie yesterday
The  it  movie was not scary what so ever more so comedic
Seen the film and the reaction was nothing like that.  This is way over the top!
Oh my God my little brother is 12 and he didn't scream or piss himself
25 seconds in you can see a clown scaring people at the back
Obviously none you know what the purpose of IT is. IT is not meant to be scary or have jumpscares. IT is suppose to completely freak you out and make people go home to not be completely scared, but more aware and to have nightmares. Movies nowadays has got it stuck in peoples head that since it's a horror movie it has to be scary and it has to have jumpscares, but what IT does is totally separate from any other horror movies out there and that is that IT makes you wonder and the crew knows that the unknown is this scariest thing to alot of people. Just wanted let most you guys know what IT was created for, the director and creator of IT says this.
I hope the movie is scary because I'm seeing this tomorrow and it will be my first time seeing a horror movie in theatres so I hope either a clown scares people in the theatre or the movie is really scary plus it is already scary because I hate clowns.
God, fuck you if hold a balloon up in the pictures.
You'll float too you'll float too you'll floats to You'll float too YOU'LL FLOAT TOOOOOO!
The movie want even scary
The film was scary but it wasn‚Äôt to the point where I or anyone would audibly scream so either this is fake or they got a bunch of easily scared people and said we will pay you to see it
I think they were paid to scream.
Standard film over hyped money spinner this film wasn't one bit scary these audiences members must live sheltered lives to be scared of that shit
When I went to watch this movie last week,   there was at least 35+ people in the cinema and literally no one screamed. The movie isn't really scary just abit jumpy and really creepy.
Bruh the movie wasn‚Äôt even scary it was funny tbh
I'm 9 I watched it didn't jump
work at a IR for a minute and you get more experience of horror that that
Like ever other lame horror movie, this one used loud noises to make you jump, but it wasn't scary. It would have been a better movie if it wasn't trying so hard to be scary.
Can clearly see them look behond themselves. Obviously someone having to force a scare out of them
You do realize they are all screaming cause a clown is running round in the cinema. E.g. 27 seconds you can see a hand reaching out trying to grab someone.
Best thing I've seen in a while
Cinema full of pussies, looking at the audience in this film makes me want to reel back in fright, bunch of fugly cunts.
I mean I jumped a couple of times but that was it
sombody should of told them it's a 12a for fuck sake
great to know what a choreographed crowd of a premiering of the movie looks and sounds like
The get scared of my big black cock
I haven't yet seen the movie, but personally, I just don't think it will be scary. It may have a a few jump-scares and instense moments that leave you feeling anxious, but I doubt it's scary; although, I guess it does depend on the individual.
Watching this tomorrow for my birthday, I'm so excited, I'm actually hoping i shit my self üòÜ
I bet your watching this on your bed
Either this is fake or the people in the vid are the biggest pussies ever
Fuckoutahere
Before they sleep : Shit I am going to have nightmares...
Wtf I admit it was a really scary film but calm the fuck down the whole cinema wasn‚Äôt screaming at the top of there voices this is a load of shit
0:18 one of them is litterly smiling
It wasn't scary, it was more creepy. \n\nThese people are clearly over-reacting, like fuck.
This was a funny film
Ive been to many cinemas in my day.\nNever ever seen anyone react like that, jumping out seats and crap.\n\nBit ridiculous over the top really.
I was the only person in the cinema when I watched it lol \n12pm on a work day! Now that was creepy af
I still think The Exorcist(1973) is the scariest movie of all time! Damn, that movie gave me the chills!
id walk out of the cinema if the crowd acted like this, get a grip
Got to b Americans over reacting to a film that's not scary bunch of muppets
This movie is not scary. These people have clearly dug themselves a hole by hyping up a flawed movie to such an extreme that to be seen not enjoying it or not reacting as expected to the ‚Äúscary‚Äù scenes would make them look as retarded as they must feel after walking out of the movie pretending to have loved it
The problem with adults watching horror, is that most have been exposed to so much horror in movie, tv and games, that they become immune to it. Horror only really works on children, so while I loved this movie, I found it more creepy than scary. I watched the tv mini-series when I was 8 or 9 and it was affective then, as I'm sure this movie would be if I was seeing it now as an 8 or 9 year old. People think they're to smart for horror, so once they start putting the pieces together, they can usually guess what's coming next.¬†\n\nTo me, this was an affective horror movie and I think that whilst there was blood and violence, I think it would have been suitable for a 12A rating in UK.
You'll float down here if your either supernatural or lighter than water
It wasn't this scary lol
Americans are always so over the top
This is as fake as Donald trumps tan, people were probably screaming cause some guy tried the cock in the popcorn box trick
It wasn‚Äôt that scary, this is massive over reacting and all fake
What an over reaction!
wow! its almost as if these people were trying to be scared. So happy i watched this with a standard crowd what a bunch of exaggerating buffoons.
um this is fake i went and saw this movie and not one person screamed
Thanks to everyone that didn't watch my video, you've avoided cancer!
This is why i don't watch horror movies in cinemas
wasn't that scary tbh lol, Amazing film nonetheless.
People are pathetic

Mortals LOL
I completely agree about Pulp Fiction.
IPA is gross.
Big labowsky was a dud agreed
SHUT THE FUCK UP DONNIE!!!
citizen Kane dude
God, youre fucking awesome man.
Review broke back mountain. ....buhahaha
i've never seen star wars and have no desire to. it just looks silly to me and i'm not big into space movies
Casually, I'm one of the few that does not like star wars
you have to smoke weed for the top 2
I have the same stance on pulp fiction
Wow. I have never agreed with one of these lists so much before. Sadly have not watched Citizen Kane. I kind of agree with Batman but for me it is some kind of guilty pleasure :). Fyi I really don't like Star Wars...
A great deal of all of those superhero movies doesn't do it for me as far as I'm concerned. I mean, apart from the setting, characters, etc., a great deal of them are all too much alike.
Who the fuck are the Coen brothers? James Rolfe 2017
For  me the most important factor of a movie is the characters that are in it.\n\n I can hate or love a movie solely based on the characters.
I agree I love how professional James sounds in this video too. I never got why Big Lebowski is so loved or even considered funny. My roommates all loved it in college but I never found it funny or even rewatchable. It was just another watch and forget about it movie to me. Yet still I have friends who watch it every year
I agree with almost all of this hear but you've given great insight as to why from a film students perspective which is fantastic.
Totally agree with Citizen Kane..but you nailed it head on when you said some people might not like Star Wars. I watched through them again in the machete order and my friends were still disappointed when I finished it and was completely underwhelmed. I just think nothing really happens! I do not understand it!\nBut just my opinion of course
i really get a kick out of reading one star reviews on imdb for movies i like. people are so funny. one guy was mad at the lion king cuz he claimed it made people hate hyenas. another guy was mad at the wedding singer cuz it got the 80s all wrong lol cmon man
I get it totally. For me it's remakes. Now some remakes are great and some not so much. I lie it when they  give a bit more back story to why the characters are the way they are. I like that.  Then there are the movies that just go to far away from what it was meant to be. They  turn it in to something else. I had really good example on a good remake but when I was watching your video I forgot what it was. if I remember I'll edit this post or leave a new one. I do get what you were saying though.
Interstellar. Everyone I know loves it. I feel like there's nothing original about it and it's a bit gimmicky and predictable.
This aggression will not stand man!
I love Sci-fi, always have. So when i finally got round to watching Blade Runner, about 15-20 years ago i thought it was a mediocre film. Was a letdown to me.. But it is a much loved movie by most!
Pretty much James isn‚Äôt a normie.
I was with you til Pulp Fiction. Also you aren't wrong. India pale ale is not great.
for me this will be The Exorcist while it does have some good scenes, its just seems heavy handed and it has that weird type of datedness (is that even a word? XD ) that many films from the 1970's seem to have, No offence to the many fans of this film, but it's just not for me.
I agree with all of these, except for Donnie Darko. I mean, it's not as great people thought it was, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it sucked.
The Godfather part 2??? I know it was you, James. You broke my heart! You BROKE MY HEART!!!
One of my friends once said something that has always stuck with me. We were talking about secret, guilty pleasures and he said:\nMine would be watching The Big Lebrowski with people who haven't seen it before and are expecting it to have a plot.\nAwesome!
I know these are not movies but i didn't get the hype over  Lost and True Blood I have tried watching both shows even finished them till the end but i thought they were overhyphed for what they were
I am actually surprised that Scarface (1983) was not only NOT on his list but he mentioned it to contrast The Godfather 2.  It's a good movie but I think it's overhyped.
I agree on half of them: a specialy Citizent Kane..
James, I kinda wanna kick your ass in some Street fighter 2 because of this video. I agree with the big Lebowski but you gotta just chill and enjoy the films you watch for what they are. PS. Come to Erie PA and I'll pay for you to go to our arcade here
Most of these that are popular are because people want be a part of the bandwagon and this is my opinion dont get butt hurt guys you shouldn't be even reading this comment go on now
This happened to me when Avatar came out. It was just a ripoff of the 1992 animated film FernGully: The Last Rainforest, which I watched as a kid. But hey, you know Hollywood, ripoff + a bunch of millions + easily entertained audience = best selling over-hyped movie.
Couldn't agree more on The Dark Knight. I've watched this movie again recently trying to keep my mind as open as possible to understand its appeal, but nope, still just one of them good action movies, not a masterpiece or anything.\n\nedit: I can see some people mock or pity you for having to speak so carefully, but I for one really appreciate that natural humility of yours. It seems almost archaic nowadays.
I don't like some of the games most people like. And sometimes that pisses people off for some reason. I think Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever made, some people don't agree with me and I think  that's fine! It's not a game for everyone. \n\nBut for some reason, when I say that Uncharted is way too linear, game with all of the games having a bit of throw away plots, where combat isn't something I find very much fun and exploration taking a back seat. It's a crime somehow and they lash out. \n\nI wish people would be more tolerant of other's opinions.
I think a lot of being part of the This is the greatest movie ever! crowd is being on board when the movie is released. For example, when it came out Citizen Kane was probably a very ambitious movie, and the years that followed probably failed to produce anything remotely as moving or groundbreaking.\n\nIt seems like it would be tougher to appreciate these movies when watching them outside of the vacuum of their release and the years where they became known as critically acclaimed.
I agree with pretty much everything except Donnie Darko. I enjoy it for it's oddness and sad gloomy atmosphere. Plus I'm a gigantic Gyllenhall fan so... haven't seen 1 or two of the others you mentioned but as far as the ones I have seen, I completely agree minus Donnie.
citizen kane was ridiculously overrated, it's not a bad film but it is not the best movie ever or the best american movie, not even close....maybe for it's time it was. but now movies have advanced so far ahead of that film's level, that citizen kane can't keep up anymore. only ppl blinded by nostalgia still say it's the best film ever. i don't even consider the godfather (yet another overrated one many ppl say it's the best) to be the greatest film either but atleast it's a little bit closer to that than citizen kane. ya know what, if u guys want another film that's kinda similar to kane but did it much better, go watch pulp fiction, that movie fucking destroys citizen kane effortlessly.
I always find it hard to believe that James is the AVGN. It's amazing that such a chill and cool guy created the most aggressive, constantly pissed off character on the internet.
I was enjoying this until you dissed Godfather II.
Did he purposefully choose the creepiest picture of that kid?
For me Donnie Darko was about feeling disconnected from the world and lonely, which could i relate to. I imagine it's the same for others
Lord of the Rings 1
I don't like Star Wars never understood the hype
That was Dunkirk for me
Any film with Batman, is the best movie ever!
Fiinally someone else agrees about dark knight, decent batman movie but not a great movie
for me its Frozen, I've seen a lot of disney movies and I didn't see really anything special about it, and that 'let it go' song didn't really stand out to me either, but they played that fucking song everywhere, it wasn't that fantastic of a song,
I'm just glad he didn't say Fight Club. I got scared after The Matrix. How do you not love The Matrix!?
You mentioned Alistair Simm's Christmas Carol?! DUDE! That's my favorite version of that movie. üòÅ\n\nYou just gained a subscriber!
Ya man, The Big Lebowski I totally get what you said, never saw it or had any interest to see it until recently, it's just one of those films I guess, I thought it was good but probably won't watch it again, it's kind of like one of those party's your friend went too, but you didn't attend, they still relay every aspect they found fun, but in the end you don't really care.  What your saying in this video I totally agree, some films are just mostly hype and maybe what's in at the time, not too sure, regardless awesome video, and finally someone that has a different opinion and is not a zombie like most people.
I freaking LOVE The Godfather (original) but I totally agree with Godfather Part 2. I thought it was really good, but the whole greatest sequel ever...
I could never understand the appeal of E.T myself. And my love for Big Lebowski started to plummet after I saw the documentary on the Lebowskifest, it really hit me how overblown the popularity of it had become.
I never heard of #2
Even with the disclaimer people got butthurt in the comments, fantastic internet, shiny as always.\nI agree with the Dark Knight and Darko, they are special, but not THAT special.
I agree with all except big Lebowski. Donnie Darko is garbage. I don‚Äôt get it either.
Totally agree about The Dark Knight
Most loved Christmas movie has gotta be Home Alone 2 :D
I've seen eight of these movies, and seven of them multiple times. There's two I can agree about. The Dark Knight is absolutely overrated and could easily be a generic crime drama sans Batman. A Christmas Story I love, but it's definitely not even in the top five best Christmas movies I've seen. I've never seen Pulp Fiction and I've never seen Donnie Darko (at least completely). Of the seven I have seen multiple times, I've seen them multiple times because I love them.
Now You See Me is my recent one.
Agree. But i also dont care for star wars.
I feel this way about Deadpool and the Lego movie. They're good, I just don't think they're amazing, especially Deadpool.
You're taking the imdb top too seriously. And thank you for Donnie Darko.
Donnie Darko is a movie you have to really think about it, it's kind of a movie you watch a few times before you get it. But if you don't like it it's not going to be an enjoyable ride for you. I personally love that movie but it's all personal preference.
Gladiator would be my main one.  I've seen it three times and it doesn't improve.
My goal in life is to be the ONLY person on the planet that NEVER seen Titanic...
God I agree with pretty much all of this! A Christmas Story is so dull. The Godfather was better than the sequel. Reservoir dogs is so much better. Donnie darco are for dim people who want to seem clever. The matrix is beyond overrated. But I do love the big lebowski. Part of the reason is I found it before it got popular.
Citizen Kane is the greatest film of all time, but rarely is it anyone's favorite film.
Everyone knows the greatest Christmas movie is Die Hard
Dually noted: Christmas Story shouldn't be played for 24 hours too the exclusion of others, Big Lebowski is quarky weird and doesn't have enough mass appeal, Donny Darko is an eerie weird story (which I like) and finally...HOW CAN YOU CHOOSE Godfather 1 over Godfather 2 and THEN put GF2 on this list!!! Arggh the reason I like Godfather 1 is because of Godfather 2...pulls hair out...now look what you made me do!
I've never seen most of the movies on the list
I can't stand E.T.
Yeah well, that's just like, your opinion man.
It's The Dude. I just knew going in that it would be at the top of your list, lol.
I don't get the big hype over Spirited Away, jk it's a f***ing masterpiece.
Die Hard is the best Christmas Movie!
To be fair most of these movies are more cult/fan favourites instead of masterpieces of cinematography. Some people love the movies and some people feel like they know a movie that is better. All opinions.
i havnt seen lebowski i avoided it on account of seein the poster at house patries.and stick dusk till dawn on it aswell.great list.
Matrix is a pile of garbage directed by two mentally ill homosexual brothers
Saving Private Ryan (great on the beach at D-day sequence, everything else is sappy, ham fisted, overly long & dull)\nEvery Cohen Brothers Movie (they all suck except Fargo which is merely a good film not a great one)\nEvery Christopher Nolan Movie (all his movies suck expect maybe insomnia, batman begins is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and the dark knight is one of the most overrated)\nPixar (everything they have done is overrated expect for toy story it is amazing)\nJurassic Park (a good decent film but not a great one all anyone ever talks about is how good the speical effects are and if that's the best aspect of a movie it probably isn't a very good one)\nFight Club (haven't seen it in quite some time but I thought it was horrible)\nForrest Gump (decent but damn is it overrated)\nHeat (it is an awful film)\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail (it's garbage)
He's Italian? I always thought Rolfe was a of German descent
Thanks for throwing some common sense into the intro....yes it is okay to have a different opinion and no just because you don't care for something does not make you a troll lol. Sad this has to be stated.
I can agree with everything but pulp fiction. Although I don't quite understand what the deal is but I do find it Hilarious.
Awe shit James I loved the matrix pulp fiction and TBL. But I do understand your opinion on these. They are on my top 50 but I do understand (pulp fiction is in my top 10)
Yay!  I'm not the only one who thinks The Big Libowski is overrated!
I didn't know the Dark Knight was one of the best movies ever made? I don't even say its the best Batman movie. Maybe because of Nostalgia, but I really like Micheal Keaton Batman movies a lot better. Micheal Keaton to me is what Kevin Conroy is to the animated Batman. I do however like the Nolan trilogy.
Sometimes, I like to watch watch garbage
Honestly I don't really like heath leadger's portray on the joker
My list would be:\nForrest Gump\nScarface\nFull Metal Jacket\nThe Englƒ±sh Patient\nSeven Years In Tibet\nFight Club\nPulp Fiction\nTitanic\n2001 A Space Odyssey\nBladerunner
I love James reviews my favorite movie is lost boys his review didn't praise the film but I agreed with his review and I was still able to love the lost boys people are too sensitive your awesome James!
I'm so happy Jurassic Park wasn't on this list.
#6\n\nOh, man, I was afraid you'd pick that one; ow, my pride.\n\nAlso, was there really such a low amount of marketing for it? I find it hard to believe people weren't raving about it the day after its theatrical release due to the rise of technology, the Internet, and the Y2KMania that were very prevalent at the time.
Some of the best films are not popular Like The Friends of Eddy Coyle Great Film Way Better than Titanic Dark Night is such a cult As far as crime Drama The movie Heat is way better There is no way Godfather II is better than Godfather I But in my Opinion The Big Lebowski Is a Hilarious Film I think its one of the top 10 Comedies but its not the best film of all time
Love The Big Lebowski!  I also Love Clue!... Am I wrong?... NO, and fuck anyone who says so... you have an absolute right to your opinion!  The Dark Knight is a Fucking Great Movie!... but so is The Changeling!... which no one knows of...  :(  Die Hard!.... Die Harder!!!  But do people appreciate 48 Hours?.... or The Last Boyscout?... Clue is an Excellent Comedy but does anyone give Oscar a 2nd look?.... In the RPG world everyone Extolls LOTRs but do they also love Dungeons & Dragons: The Book of Vile Darkness(IMO the best D&D film that exists)... NO!  Best Ever?!?... I'll leave that up to my betters(yuck yuck), but I know what I love and those films are the ones I'll own... more than 500 films that I think should be examples of what make cinema Great!
Thank you! I agree with the matrix!
I haven't watched the video yet, but I'm not a very big fan of The Shawshank Redemption which a lot of people seem to think is the best film of all time.
Eh. I reallly like pulp fiction and the godfather part 2.
When james said: Your favorite movie might be on this list Subconsciously thinks Pulp Fiction will be on the list *it shows up*
I literally just experienced this the night before you posted this...
Bitch you trippin this video wasn't relaxing! Straight disliked and unsubbed now I cant sleep
Lucid dreaming is the most incredible experience ever. There's techniques on how to practice and be able to control it.
shes the best asmr person ever i mean just watch all of her videos you start growing affection on the videos
I actually have sleep paralysis. It's scarier than you think
Sleep paralysis is probably the worst/scariest experiences I‚Äôve ever had. \nI wouldn‚Äôt wish it upon my worst enemy. \nI‚Äôve had it a total of 5 times \nAnd all of them probably took a few years off of my lifespan due to pure fear
Bro I literally watched this video before bed last night and this morning I experienced sleep paralysis for the first time. Idk if it's possible to have been a trigger but just a little warning for anyone out there.
I never open my eyes when I wake up during the night because of this!
it's always a guy without a face or a witch woman when I get sleep paralysis
I have these at least 6 times a week lmao I find it fun in a way Idk why
I remember having it \nBut i always could move my head and for some i always started sucking my hand and that woke my hand up
Hey Taylor, I don‚Äôt know how you would go about doing this, but if you could make a video revolving around thunder and rain, I would love it. And I‚Äôm sure many others would too. Those sounds are very soothing to me for some reason.\n\nI loved how there was some of that in this video and it definitely added to the mood. Another thing I would love is if you were to make another Stargazing video. That video was one of my favorites so far. Anyway, thank you for the great video again! Keep ‚Äòem coming üòä
I've had sleep paralysis.. I woke up suddenly to a noise but I couldn't move any part of my body except my head and I looked around quickly and saw a dark figure staring at me. Stared at the ceiling for a few minutes and the shadow was gone. Oh and also this sounds stupid but when I was little (I was awake) whenever I stared at a part of a room in the dark for too long these 'wasps' and 'mosquitoes' would start circling me and 'bite' me, I swear I felt little pinpricks while as hearing buzzing.. D:
Who else is hiding in the comments XD
I watch this last night when I was trying to get to sleep I got to a black then I quickly turned it off because I was terrified, I tried to get to sleep without thinking about it , I closed my eyes and my body couldn't move I thought open my eyes thankfully nothing was there but I still couldn't move I was so scared
I also enjoy ur videos keep it up
Sleep paralysis can be interesting. Ive never had one where i saw shadow beings but i had one where i was hallucinating my mom and my cat coming into my room. When in reality that never happened. Its so weird considering how real it all felt and i saw them with what seemed to be my own eyes. What is life!!!
That's funny because I also sleep with the TV on for no reason and the fan blasting
Luckily I have many lucid dreams and have never stumbles upon sleep paralysis
I wish there was asmr for schizophrenia
bizarrely the third story was exactly what happened to me last night for the 2nd time in about 2 years earbuds in ears falling asleep to asmr and all.. thank you for sharing your story with us
I always have this. I don't go to sleep if there is no light or without music.
When I first started sleep paralysis, I learned very quickly to keep my eyes shut during the process. I'd get it so often, once or twice a week for months. I used to be so scared about going to bed, but I eventually learned to coach myself to ride it out. I would get auditory hallucinations though, so bad to the point I wanted to hold my hands to my ears because of how loud it was in my head. Finally the paralysis just stopped in January, but then made a reappearance last summer. The paralysis that summer was the one that trips me out to this day. I'm a lucid dreamer, so I feel that I'm perfectly capable of distinguishing dream state from reality. So this one morning I'm in my room and my brother walks in. Right as he's walking in I feel my body tensing up, signaling paralysis. I lifted my hand in my last free moments to signal something was wrong. Then I tried something I remember I read online. This article said that if you scrunched your face three times, you'll snap out of it immediately. So I test out the theory, and it works. I'm out. \n\nMy brother is gone. \n\nHe was a hallucination. \n\nWhat trips me out about this, is that was the first time I didn't feel fear during paralysis. I was so sure he was really there with me. It shook my reality completely.\n\nAdvice wise, try scrunching your face three times. After successfully breaking from sleep paralysis, get up, and splash your face with cold water. If you just go back to bed, you'll go right back to paralysis.
The one time I watch your video and say to myself. Nope not sleeping tonight
I never experinced a black Cloudy person in sleep paralysis but i remember waking up couldnt move my body and i was like ok Why can't i move so i tried to move but couldn't so i freaked out then tried screaming and nothing then suddenly i feel someone whisper in my right ear that was The edge of the bed and i tried saying something back but no then 10 Min later i Get in control And move my body up fast and as i do that i catch my breath on the way up and felt like i didnt have any air in me for a second it was nuts and i gained more control over it this happend 2 times a week bit i Only had it 5 times its an insane  feeling
That is the same thing that happen to my mom she said theta when I was a baby she saw someone staring at me in my crib and she also said that she could not move and the back figure turned and looked at her and disappeared and she did some research and some people believe that is the devil riding your back it so creepy but it's never happened to me
Has any one else seen the show haven? She looks like Emily rose in this video. Maybe just me idk.
i got sleep paralysis for the first time the night after i watched this video
I did experience that before and I was also in high school too. It was scary until I figured out a way to wake up. Your body is just helping you wake up so my mind was imagining bad scary stuff to scare myself away but I finally figured out how to make it Day time while I'm having sleep paralysis I relax into it take deep breaths and wake up! But this is also why I leave my light on
I suffer from sleep paralysis too, it's honestly the worse. I really like this video, nice to relate with a YouTube personality about something like this
Interesting story. I never experienced anything like that thank God. Glad I now know about it. Thank you.
Thunder made it seem like you're about to tell a good scary story.
People this days get a punch of likes can i get 10?üòÅ
I just watched IT and now i'm here at 2 AM
Girl you need help you need a cleaning
Sleep paralysis...yeah I just finished watching Get Out sooooo Imma watch this later
i would LOVE a college themed vid! maybe a role play maybe just some advice or some encouragement :) love u taylor!! your vids always make me so happy
Sleep Paralysis I think is linked with stress
I once woke up and swore I saw a figure standing over me but I was able to punch it - which of course turned out to be air.  I guess technically not sleep paralysis since I was able to move.  But it was a sudden awake and things were blurry situation.  I would say it looked more like an alien than a human - but yeah could have been a generic black figure.  Wonder why it's always that.
i really liked the story time tbh and would love to see more :)
The figures are called shadow people
I've experienced the exact same thing a few years ago. I have also trained myself to have lucid dreams.... I had no idea that the two were correlated.
I like your hair :)
I haven‚Äôt experienced that but I did have a lucid dream, its the worst!!! For me it was like being in a dream aware i was dreaming but the dreaming didn‚Äôt stop, it kept going like i was stuck and I couldn‚Äôt do anything, i could control ‚Äúmyself‚Äù in my dream (does that make sense?) but I couldn‚Äôt control anything else
I‚Äôve had sleep paralysis before. I was awake but I couldn‚Äôt move my body. My brain was functioning but I literally could not move. It is very scary. And sometimes there does seem like shadow looming over you.
I enjoyed this very much. Please do tell more stories. The one where you were Wendy telling a story to Peter was great too.
I liked the mood and things but it made me really scares throughout the night and now I'm afraid to get it. I think I had it once but it was already morning and I didnt see anything but I fell back asleep and in my dreams I was trying to wake up so I jumped into lava and see if maybe I die in my dreams then I would wake up or something. I know it sounds really dumb probably lol but it was crazy and I hope u or I don't go through that
I'm glad I just watched this in the morning, and not before going to sleep at night
I had a real scary childhood thanks to sleep paralysis
I have times where I wake and crawl out of bed without realizing that my legs are asleep\nSo I fall and get hurt sometimes.... gud excuse to skip school
Ur voice is so soft c: (don't worry imma girl)
when you wanna watch a nice ASMR vid before you go to sleep but also don‚Äôt wanna be terrified...
I remember a very similar thing happening to me about 2 monthes ago. I had no idea what it was until now! One time i went to sleep in my bed, and at about 3 am, so like 4-5 hours later i woke up and i was in that half asleep state where I didn't completely know i was awake, and I ALSO saw black figures that looked like demons!!!! I squeezed my eyes shut and i could hear like a roaring noise and i couldn't move my body at all! It stayed liked that and i can't remember if i fell back asleep or got up. But i thought it was a demon, because i felt like I definitely saw something and I for sure couldn't move my body. It was terrifying. Glad i saw this video to know its happened to others! Kind've hope it happens again so i can go into it knowing what's happening.
i would like that to happen to me once just to experience it
I remember when you haved 16k, I Remember to, when you was so sad because the people don't believed on you and I see now and I'm so happy for your success üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëçüèº sorry my English
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT UM WAIT NO YOU DONT KNOW BUT DID YOU GUCK YUCK
Hi, I am not sure what your name is but is this a true story? \nI am Gus by the way? I am curious to find out. On the other hand, I love your videos!
I experienced the same thing 3 times in the same house as a young teen.  Still the most terrifying thing that's happened to me. I still remember that shadow figure that was pacing in the kitchen but not being able to move or scream. Terrible terrible stuff
I can‚Äôt stay awake to hear the storyüò≠üòÇüíÄ
Please do these storytimes more this was so relaxing
This exact thing happened to me but rather than sitting there with my eyes closed I forced myself to get up and fight back until I finally beat the paralysis and when I woke up again the black figure was gone
I've had sleep paralysis for two days in a row. Basically I saw a shadow over me and I couldn't breather or even move I tried to get up from my bed but it felt like something was pushing my chest down
Oddly enough, I had sleep paralysis a few nights ago for the first time in several months. Hate it
I‚Äôve experienced sleep paralysis when I used to take sleeping pills. It was so scary. Needless to say I stopped taking  sleeping pills.
i've experience sleep paralysis a few times but can't recall ever seeing the dark shadowy figure you described. I have however had many lucid dreams in the past
Lily James I think she looks a little like her.
It would be funny if she dropped the candle and she started a fire
If you're scared of getting sleep paralysis don't be. During the REM stage of sleep your body releases a chemical that prevents you from moving your muscles. This stops you from actually acting out your dreams.(sleep walking)  And all sleep paralysis is, is waking up in that stage of sleep. So in another words, sleep paralysis is good because it protects you. You may wonder why there are so many stories of people seeing scary things and I personally believe it is caused by us waking up with fear which causes us to hallucinate fearful things.\n\n      I've had many sleep paralysis experiences and still do sometimes but I am never scared when it happens anymore because I know it is there to stop me from acting out my dreams.\n\nSo if you ever have it, here are some things to help you...\n\n1. Keep your eyes closed just in case your brain wants to play tricks on you.\n\n2. Like she said in the video, you can try to wiggle your toes or you fingers to get yourself out of it. Or just try going back to sleep.\n\n3. You can control your diaphragm in that state so if you hold you breathe, your body will automatically wake itself up.
I'm only small ,but this video has helped me a lot...
I fell asleep watching this my phone died
Once I had a dream that I couldn't breathe and I was like I hope I will never go through that dream again
I had sleep paralysis two times in a row by a 10 minute difference it was very scary.üòûüòû‚òπÔ∏è
Her hair looks good like that
Me at midnight: hmmmmm I need to sleep and not get spooked, welp
Take a shot everytime she says..\n\n\n\n\n..MY EYES..
Any lucid dreamers in here scared to go to sleep now?üôãüò£
It's happened to me in the 5th grade
I'd hold my breath and kms is this happened to me
Am I the only one who likes the feeling of sleep paralysis?
This scared me more than IT lel\nEdit:IT is a amazing movie tho if u love to be scared then I think y should see it my new favorite movie now just gotta wait for chapter 2!
i've had sleep paralysis maybe twice, but one particular time was horrible. i thought i was awake but i could move. and i heard all these whispers. it would mumble and suddenly say my moms name and my little brothers Name. and then i felt a knife or claw slash my legs and arms. but i wiggled my toes and soon actually woke up. y'all don't know how scary sleep paralysis is until it actually happens. i hope y'all don't get it!
I'm scared now... I don't ever want to experience sleep paralysis it sounds scary :(

*Superfruit* scores a hit with this one.  *Hurry Up* has to be a radio play;  it is bouncy, catchy and has a great hook.The vocals are of course perfect and the beauty of Mitch Grassi and Scott Hoying truly dancing is incredible.  On top of it all, the music video has a plot.  Look out next year for a Grammy and maybe even an Oscar (LOL).
I LOVE THIS VIDEO CONCEPT
I gotta say, I appreciate the diversity In these actors, it really helps everybody connect with the song.

Mitch. Shave the moustache, mate. Doesn‚Äôt suit you.
This is my new fav on your album
This helps so much. I know nobody will read or care or respond to this, and that's okay. But I'm going to comment it\n\nI eat less than 500 calories a day, and I'm losing weight. I still feel ugly. I have people tell me I'm hard to not like because I'm always so happy, but they don't know that I'm crying at home. My parents tell me that I'm beautiful along with other people. I still tell them I eat. I eat enough.\nEven I know it's a lie. But thank you for making me feel beautiful
these fags can sing pretty good!
Not rich enough to pick that person up?
Hey that's Janis from The Good Place!!!

When you think they finally gonna come out but they don't and you're likeüíÅüèªtf \nAlso we know who's Mitch type
Pentatonx?
Hmmm. I was enjoying the Superfruit music for a minute. But it appears to be more and more just a Mitch spotlight with Scott practically playing the role of a backup singer. Not cool. I keep hoping to hear  his phenomenal voice by he's hidden under Mitch's high pitches.
My cats 17 and still gets playful from time to time
My 15 year old kitteh loves cardboard boxes.  Every time I bring one home she claims it as her own and will play in it for hours.
My cats are not interested at all in the red dot...but give them a box with some type of wrapping paper in it and the party is on.
hey nice video
1:15 ... a cat called Nigel ...?\n\nYay!\n\n... and he is a cutie ...
My cat, Eleanor, has a fishing rod toy that she loves. It has a stuffed Millenium Falcon that she loves to pick up and drag around when she wants to play, or cuddle when everyone is sleeping. :)
My cat, Minnie, used to love playing with the laser pointer. Her favorite thing to do was when I would circle it around her and she would spin around and around so fast that she'd lose her balance and fall over. Once she stopped being dizzy, she would run after it.
Oh, I shouldn't use my hands when they're kittens?\n...\n...\n.... I think I just like to suffer.
Always supervise play with a string. A cat can swallow string and injure the intestines as it passes.
Love all of the Cat Logic pieces.  Thanks so much for educating us!!!  Purrrrrrrrrrr
My cat loved crushed up bits of foil.  Used to throw them up the stairs and she would chase the foil ball as it fell and bounced down.  Really enjoyed this video Simon, thanks.

My cats are gumps
Simon, I thought you knew better. If a cat swallows a string it could kill them. You should have said to be sure to put all string toys away when you are not there to play with your cat to make sure they are safe.
My cat loved pens! I would just leave them on the bed/floor/chair and he would grab, play with and carry around, the other cat I had love foil sweet wrappers crushed into balls. She was even trained t fetch them.
also please have an indoor-only cat :(
I just like how in the end Nigel just rests on her lap lol
I have the exact same white string.  I can get all the cats to come running if I start dragging it around.
Nigel looks like a cat I know named Airies.
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
What if the cat just isn't interested in play/exercise? Our cat will play for a few minutes sporadically, but usually just looks at us as if to say: Really? What are you doing? He's an indoor Maincoon/Norwegian Forest (very large normally), we have several different style/types of toys, but still just... nothings. Tips/Advice?
Be careful with the laser pointers! Cats have very sensitive eyes! They also can get frustrated because they can't catch something. See here: http://www.einfachtierisch.de/katzen/katzenhaltung/laserpointer-fuer-katzen-gefaehrlich-oder-grosser-spass-id37737/
my kitties love the little plastic strip that comes off the dry cat food bag. there's a piece of string that i throw away because, as they do love the string, they tend to try to eat it, and i don't want them to choke on it. but, the little plastic strip is fun for them because it makes a little sound when i wiggle it on the floor, and they can play with it by themselves and have a wonderful time. the only thing is, with more than one cat, they can sometimes 'fight' over it. they also love those little mice that have catnip inside them.  =^..^= *meow*
My cat LOVES empty toilet paper tubes! He shreds them and leaves bits of soggy cardboard pieces for me to pick up later. Also, he loves watching me play find my toys he hides them, STARES AT ME FOR HOURS.... until I get his toys from under the couch or fridge!üò∏üêæüêæüêæüêæüêæ
The laser pointer WAS Hugh's favourite toy?¬† Did he pass away?
My cat loves to attack my computer screen whatever moves, including this video.\n\nBut, her favorite toy is probably a straw. That's about it. xD

Both my ragdolls love to play with wand/feather toys, ¬†small mice shaped toys and brown packing paper. ¬† With the wand toys they jump really high.
Once,  when  folding  the bed sheets the cats thought it would be  fun to jump on to them while being folded by two persons. Now we have to hide to fold them or else they'll  want to jump onto them. So now we have an old sheet and sometimes we take it out for them to play. They love to jump into it and run all over it and climb it as well. We hold the ends up high as if it was a hammock. They just go crazy.  I wear  thick working gloves cause they turn mad climbing right up to my hands.
My cat Syd is amazing he follows me absolutely everywhere in the house and does the same thing with the laser pointer the button on it rattles  and the second he hears it he goes bananas
Very nice video and wunderful hints. Our cat maja love strings as a toy also. Here is her video. https://youtu.be/_MJkkgRg240

It was very easy to teach our cats to play with us directly and not damage us. As soon as they use their nails, stop, say ow! with a crying lilt in your voice,  and touch the paw that caused the problem. They learn very quickly. Now our cats even play rake (with their hind legs) our arms using only their pads when we tickle their belly. Same with biting: just stop moving (don't pull away) and say Ow!. Obviously it requires overriding your immediate response as well; pulling away from a claw or bite does more damage (to you) than just freezing. It makes play much more enjoyable for both of us rather than simply using a toy.
Why do I attract lunatic cats that look absolutely crazy
Ah! My cat loves most play but her favourite is also a piece if string or the laser toy! She reacts just like Hugh! :-) I rattle the key ring & she comes darting out from wherever she has been! If it's not playtime & I'm just trying to move the toy from one place to another I have to pick it up super carefully or the smallest little sound from it has her darting ahead wanting to play! :-D
No need to buy toys for cats. They will play with just about anything.
OMG My Siamese cat LOVES to play with string, but once he swallowed one and puked it back up, so we rarely let him play with string anymore. It was kinda funny though, but he possible could have choked or other bad things could have happened so that was sad.
My cat Popper found a small strip of foam weatherstripping when we were insulating the house for winter. He was obsessed with it..we nicknamed it Mr. Strippy and Popper played with it constantly.  Eventually it got lost, but when we offered him a new one he was not interested.\nAnother cat of ours, Blackbeard, was absolutely terrified of an stuffed catnip mouse we had. One of our other cats managed to rip it open and pull out the catnip and stuffing. Well, once it was no longer stuffed, Blackbeard loved it. He would carrry  Flat Mouse everywhere, even when he was eating or sleeping. One day I was vacuuming and got a little too close to Flat Mouse and sucked him up. Blackbeard sat by the vacuum and cried until I opened the bag and retrieved Flat Mouse.
My baby loved her loose fur. After brushing, she started play with fur and it would become hair ball. I found tens of them under the fridge :-)
*i love cats*\n-I love cats-\nNo dogs\nWait.....\nYou know what?\n*i don't know*
During the winter when my cats can't go outside, Jasmine likes to take a ball with a bell in it, drop it down the basement steps and chase after it. She'll carry it and bring it up stairs again until she's bored.
My cat started having brief seizures from the quick movements of the laser pointer so we no longer use it. Also, always put string away so your kitty won't swallow it.
dear simons cats dad !!  my cats are indoor cats ans have about 40 toys !!   can you tell me why my male cat who has been done  likes to hump me every night on my arm befiore he goes to sleep !!
My cat is weird the fishing rod cat toy my tuxedo Bristol doesn't like the furry end he likes playing with the stick he will actually grab it out of my hand and start wrestling around with itüôÑü§î
SIMON...PLEASE PLEASE ...make more of your cats adventures videos...I do like the ones with the vet, but I have rewatched all your oldie goldies...thank you for all your videos
Can you address socialization for cats in the same home? When are they fighting, when are they playing, when are they the same?
Your cat behavioral expert is so hot! Please show her more!
My cat takes litterally anything, string,dust,ANYTHING! Its best. toy. EVER.
Buster¬† liked the clear bic pens the made a lot of noise on the wood floor.
I love this cat
I taught my cats no bite and no nails....they either use no nail or bite or do it very gentle. All 5 do this!
keep up the great work
String / shoe lace with the know works well doesn't it?! My cat likes ribbon too.
My 1 year old black cat, Samantha (good name...she's a terror...lol) absolutely loves a yellow stuffed dog toy. She carries it around in her mouth, and when she wants me to play she drops it on top of my foot. Then we play catch the moving toy. She tugs on it like a dog, shakes it like a dog, and fetches it. Then her other favorite toys are marbles! She LOVES to chase marbles (she has about a dozen scattered about) and in the middle of the night I hear her chasing and hitting the marbles. If one goes under a dresser or the fridge, she meows and meows until I get it out for her. we also play the hiding game. When we lock eyes, I quickly hide my eyes between a chair or my bed, and she sneaks up on me to lock eyes w me again. I hide my gaze and she jumps up on the bed to attack me playfully. She is SO much fun!
My cat Loki loved a rolled up piece of foil. Eventually I had to take it away from him because I noticed sparkly poop in the litter box. Oops!
Our ferret's favourite toy was our tabby, Loki.
My 7 month old Zaya loves to play. She likes most toys but she seems to prefer homemade toys. And she loves to play fetch!! My Meeka doesn't play with toys. But they both love the red dot from the laser toy! I have a video on my channel of my kitties and the red dot. ‚ù£ üêæüê±üêæ‚ù£
My cat loves feather toys the only problem is she trys to eat them to much
My cat tickles um well he likes to cuddle with only not anyone else and also he  rarely plays but when he does his rlly cute because hid cheeks give his cuteness away he is part British shorthair
I've spent lots of money on cat toys. Jack always winds up playing with the rubber band off the news paper. He doesn't chew it, he just bats it around until he's worn out or my wife makes me pick it up.
Get a cheap hollow plastic ball that is the same size as a table tennis ball. Cut it in half and it's the perfect shape and size for a cat to pick up in it's mouth. Start flicking it around and see if your cat will play fetch.
My cat is evil he plays with mice till they die then leave it alone
OMGosh  Laser toys...I always ended the game by putting the toy on the carpet to let HarryHat and sister MinnieCat watch the light go inside its house. Then they knew the game was over
I know it's been a long time but I'm still sorry for your loss of Hugh. I miss my Kewpie very much.
What if my dog plays with my cat? She would just be on the floor waiting for the dog to follow her, when she gets tired, she simply leaves. Is that ok?
my cats are very lazy But they still play!
My cats prefer a string or a piece os paper, although sometimes they want to play with the curtains or tablecloth
I have 3 cats but only one has any real interest in laser toys.  The last laser I had also had a little chain and boy she got excited when she heard it.  One of my other cats does this cute little 'jiggling bobblehead' thing sometimes when she gets real into whatever toy she's stalking.
My cat loves one of those plastic poppers, since its like a half ball it moves weirdly. He loves it!
I always have played with my cats using my hands to teach them to be gentle with their teeth and claws. I teach them to be gentle by giving them a command as soon as they bite or use their claws and even more better if you can catch it before it happens. Once i know the cat understands the command i slowly stop using the command until it becomes second nature to the cat not to bite down hard or use their claws on humans.Reason why i do this is sometimes even thou you may watch them very carefully around kids, accidents do happen. So i've taught every cat i have owned to be gentle. If you do not introduce them to be gentle with hands, they will not learn how to be gentle when kids or stranger hands touching them.  \n\nAlso i suggest to put away any string or fishing rod toy that dangles in the air or any small toys when you can not watch your cat. Fishing toys can be dangerous too. I had one experience with my cat who love fishing toys. One day i was holding her fishing rod toy it in the air. She jump down from her cat tree running full speed and jump for the fishing toy and the rope accidentally wrapped around her front leg. I am glad when i felt the tug in my hand i let go. I could see her licking her front leg and shoulder blade for couple of minutes and shaking her front leg. I brought her to the vet just in case. Vet said nothing too serious with her leg. Probably just a slight pull but nothing to be concern about. However since that incident she never wants to play with any type of fishing rod toy, she runs away from that toy now.
I had a siamese cat who loved to play with hands but was very gentle when biting etc. Never used his claws.
My cat likes to hide in the garden and do suprise attacks, she jumps out and pats you on the leg. Sometimes it can be a real jumpscare.
My cat loves play time. She has toys everywhere. No matter what toy I'd buy her, she always uses me as her post still. Her favorite toy is, bottle caps, and small rubber balls. üòªüòª Bella is my profile pic. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have two kittens, 5 months old, brother and sister, and I never bought any toy, rather make some. Scratching post with a log from the garden nailed on a plank from a disused wooden furniture and some thick rope around it; old shoe laces hanging from book shelves from little balls of wool at the end; old Tesco shopping bags and damaged cardboard boxes...They love everything, it's brilliant! Especially used tissues for some reasons =^-^=
Did you know cats can see into the ultraviolet, but not much into the red. This may be why some cats could care less about red laser dots. They may not be able to see it very well. They do sell them in blue and green too.\nOur cat's favorite toy is a bird (feathers) on a string on a stick with a string on the tail.
Ivy used to pinch little baubles off my miniature Xmas tree.
That's so funny! And interesting facts!
In my school I just watched this and it's still school I my mom said I cant go to school
poke a hole in a bottle cap... and add.. fishing line.\nI would roll the bottle cap down the hall... and with the line I could bring it back and easily roll it again.. \nCheap and kept my cats busy for hours of great play time.
Best video in youtube
One of my cat loves straws... we always get an extra straw when we go to mcdonalds to take home for him. He LOVES it he will take it away from the others¬†and growl if another cat comes over to sniff at his straw. Haha!
My kitty for some reason LOVES LOVES LOVES tissues! It can‚Äôt be just any tissue though it has to be balled up, otherwise he‚Äôll completely ignore it!
My cat loves strips of toilet paper. His eyes just light up!  I may give him a whole roll just to see what he does!
My cat loves strings (or shoelaces), too. But I always have to closely supervise when he plays with it, because he always want to swallow it. All of it... üôÇ
Cats are just dumb!!!
I tried to pet a cat once,  got like 10 scratches on my hand in like a sec...... The reason I prefer dogs.
My cat ate a bee what do I do?!?!
Unfortunately, my cat ignores the string/sock/rolled up paper and thinks my hands are the toy!
A laser pointer is neat in that it allows the owner to be lazy. Unfortunately it doesn't work with my cat: she watches the dot on the floor, then the hand waving the laser... and aims for that instead.\nHer favorite was a champagne cork: it rolles, bounces, and moves irraticaly. But my mom's dog destroyed that, so she plays with paper balls instead.\nI'll have to buy (and drink) champagne some day... It's for my cat's good!
I've stopped buying my cat toys bc she prefers balled up pieces of paper to play catch with. She recognises the sound of me balling up paper and gets ready to play. I love her, she's so playful :)
I had a cat who learned within a minute where the laser pointer was coming from and if you turned it on, he would look at it and promptly walk over and smack it out of your hand.
Thanks for using fitting rock music for the trailer and not some shitty ring-tone rap! This looks awesome too.
damn Shane, what happen to you
I already know the whole storyof punisher, He became Anti-hero kills people, in the end Marvel Heroes beat him, sentenced to Jail, completed his trial, In New Life he changes his name to Shane to leave his past behind, then he again stuck in an zombie apocalypse fucks his bestfriends wife, and he again became Punisher in Zombie Apocalypse, but after three years his bestfriends Son shot him in the brain in some Farmer's field. Happy Ending.
so they're obviously using the 2004 comic  series as a starting point. great. do Barracuda. best Punisher billion ever
Dc aint got nothing on this
Perfect song. I Cannot Live... His family is dead, he can't move on and live. I Cannot Die... Can't die until those who suffer are punished.
If only he had Vivint.üòí
On 1:45 he like the fucking John Wick)
After the failures of iron fist, the defenders and inhumans. This should be marvel getting it's mojo back.
When does it start?
Yeah oh yeah man I'm so fuckin hype about this shit fuckin yeah
Song fits the trailer, but all metalheads know that it should've been Megadeth's Holy Wars...The punishment due :-)
I couldn't understand him, but I liked the trailer.
This looks amazing, the Metallica style one is amazing as that song is about a soldier with PTSD who is damaged just like Frank. Great trailer!
This trailer is everything, I am so ready
as I remember correctly this guy's from daredevil series correct me if I'm wrong
Bernthal is completely unconvincing as Frank Castle. He's not brooding enough. And not physically imposing at all. Maybe 160lbs soaking wet. Ray Stevenson was a better Punisher, and that's not saying much.
Not too big on Marvel, but after seeing this, I think I'm hooked.\n\nAbout time we get someone who's cleaning the criminals up and not letting them re-offend. \nKILL KILL KILL
How the fuck could anyone dislike this epic ass trailer!!
What a terrific song for Frank.  It matches him so perfectly.
You made the right move, Netflix. You made the right move.
Um going to watch the shit out of it
Netflix is good at making trailers look nice but then the show sucks. I'll give it a shot but fuck you if you mess up again netflix
My first view was in mute. I had to read the comments to understand what i was missing.
Fuck yes, they're putting in the special forces vs Frank scene from Punisher MAX.
When does it Start ??
This movie will also be shit as Deathnote by Netflix
Him firing that massive gun while screaming YUUUUUUHHHHH!!!!!! made my shoes shoot off my feet!
After the snooze fest that was Luke Cage, Iron Fist and the Defenders, this is the first Marvel Netflix series I hope stays self contained and unaffiliated with those other shows.
SHANE!!! I thought you was dead.
- The Punisher (1989) cast by : Dolph Lundgren\n- The Punisher (2004) cast by : Thomas Jane\n- The Punisher War Zone (2008) cast by : Ray Stevenson\n- The Punisher tv show (2017) cast by : Jon Bernthal
I hate the whole 2017 thing, but i love it at the same time. Just drop it and people wil be like whaaaaaat?
If the show is half as good as this trailer it will easily be the best show ever made.
Jon Bernthal is knocking this character out of the park, man.
is this like the work of a dead man to you ?  :)
Ami i only one who came here for metallica?
This Punisher is going to be hardcore!!! I like so far what I'm seeing! $alute!!!
I saw one in my recommended so I'm like ok I'll read the comments and now I want to watch this show and go learn the solos and see it live again and yeah. I'm I die hard Metallica fan
what Luke Cage did with Hip Hop is what Punisher should do with Metal
No sequel based on this character. I mean what does he do next, take out Jimmy Kimmel in the next movie?
Metallica makes the Punisher trailer 10000000x's better!!!!!!
Hope he's as badass here as he was in season 2 of daredevil because he was the only reason worth watching it
This is going to be a serie right?
This music is the type music for sweet revenge
Such a bad ass trailer. I've been waiting for this show for so long!
Marvel and Netflix are a match-made in heaven
This show is going to be crazy
Now this feels like a marvel production
The punisher with the best song ever made!!\nFantastic!!
Perfect use of One!!!
Fuck yeah. No mercy, He is coming!!!
I love how well Metallica One goes together with the trailer
I love how the gunshots lined up with the music.
Another marvel character to fuck up
I thought in this version his family got caught in a crossfire?
The weird thing about this trailer is that how come everything else is restricted at my school like to the Thor Ragnarok trailer but how come this in not restricted I watched it all day at school.
This young man will be as unfeeling as unthinking as the dead, until the day he joins them.
This looks so so amazing! I just hope this music doesn't permeate throughout this show.
I hate rock, gross. Music killed the ad.
yall im ready for kastle to be canon
All we need now is a series for blade.
Don't you mean the PUNisher
FUCK YEEEAAAAHHHH
Punisher? I hardly know her!
FAMILY family ...famliy
Punisher vs Power
Oh hell yeah!
METALLICA
marvelicous
Awesome
Fuck yeah!
Best trailer ever
Fuck Yeaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stinks of low budget
Release date?
1K dislike NYPD
Soooo many views already
Metallica BABY
Metallica ayyye
f.i.r.e
METALLICA ONE + PUNISHER= EPIC TEASER TRAILER!
When fucking shit WHEEEEEEEEN!!!???üò≥
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssss!
Fuck yes dude.
Shane üòç
Obviously this is going to be the new favourite series because this is finally a show with an emotional background
Other trailers can learn from this trailer, how to be a trailer.
AHHHHH you mean Netflix made the Punisher into a badass vigilante?  keep it R and full of epic gory violence then I am in.
More action more punisher more love
The Punisher > The entire Yakuza
Who else was headbanging during the trailer
Frank is going to get his revenge on those who killed his family (family family family).
So kinda the marvel version of batman
Hope there are some hardcore rapes and bit of ahhh. Candy.
I hope this focus more on the action and less on the talking, I'm looking at you Luke Cage and Iron Fist
I'l PASS!! Damn MARVEL!! no better actors?
Hype
The Punisher,  with the super power of severe brain damage from being shot in the head.
Guys its coming out on OCTOBER 13th . Clever bastards
So Frank Castle is actually killing law enforcement and Federal agents in this one??? If so, then that's a pretty drastic departure from the source material (after all, Punisher as a general character archetype is basically Batman, but with guns and he kills criminals) Punisher still had his limits and did not kill the good guys.
Looks like people missed the point of this video. This video is NOT a persuasive video. It is an informative video. It provides solace for those who willingly do not want to have kids by providing science behind why their decision is sound and/or beneficial. It is not bashing on people who have kids, nor is it telling you, you shouldn't have kids, it's saying that if you do not want kids, that's cool, here's some science to back you up. I honestly do not get why everyone is getting worked up over this.
I'm not against not having kids, but we ought to stop immigration of non-whites to Europe first.
So migrants are encouraged to have as many as they want on our tax money and we are encouraged to have none.
If westerners don't have kids then the replacement generation will throw people like you off buildings. Sad but true.
You ladies are just jelli cause you can't reproduce. By the way thank god for that.
We shouldn't have kids, but we also need immigrants to fill our jobs?
'We are insecure because we can't have kids.'
I am bisexual, now I am conviced to have 10 kids and a loving wife.\n\nThanks.
Make a video on pedophilia! I would love to know your opinions
Two pedophile-looking fuckers such as yourselves shouldn't have kids in the first place.
Whats Greg and Mitche's Last names? I have a....a certain feeling..... im not sure what it could be.....
i love how /pol/ went balls to the walls on this comment section
You garbage selfish man... you are disgusting
1:36 maybe because women are traditionally the caregivers and we're making 'progress' because now men care for kids too???????
I am baffled as to why two unmarried gentlemen with zero child-rearing experience are opining on this subject of children.  It is well known that children are costly and cause sleep deprivation.  What these fine fellows cannot possibly understand is the joy and satisfaction that parenting brings.  Not to mention seeing ones progeny, and, dare I say it, the NECESSITY of bringing sound, intelligent tax-paying citizens into society.  Otherwise, who will pay in to the system to ensure the non-child bearing citizen's lavish retirement benefits?  Additionally, if the gentlemen in this video are serious about overpopulation, they would best head to Africa and start preaching birth control.  Either that or they could off themselves, for the good of the environment.  :)
Kids just seem like too much for me. A small human depending on you for 18 years sounds stressful and expensive. Small children are adorable but then  they turn into asshole teens and start talking back and shit. No thank you!
homosexuals are a genetic and evolutionary dead end. the future belongs to those who procreate.
Okay but when did they ever direct this solely at white people? They never said white people should stop having kids but everyone else go ahead. In fact, they didn't say to stop having kids at all. They were just pointing out the reasons why it's okay not to have kids.
*Coming from homos who can't have kids*
This is like a recruitment video for ISIS/the alt right.
Don't have a kid: you have to be an adult if you do.
Very informative video for people who don't want children!!!
Lol science from YouTube \nYou people are incredible ignorant.  Your science is flawed of course because every single thing you said in this was incorrect.
Holy shit it's Charles and Rudy from Archer!
Q-why --some of my wording is crossed out.. please explain.
Trying very hard to be polite. This is a devious way of making yourselves feel better or anyone else for that matter. Why not just stick to the reality of it. We can feel ok with or without kids. Life choices take us in many different directions. The worst of it all was the carbon footprint nonsense. I hope you enjoy your good night sleep with all your fancy gadgets and clothing, and hair gel, and all the other crap you use in your free lifestyle that makes you so virtuous and role models of citizens because you can prove there‚Äôs more than one way for people to live their lives.
People in general don't (and shouldn't) have children to improve their lifestyle. The question isn't whether it's fun or easy, but whether it's meaningful & worth it. Fact is, most things worth pursuing are challenging. Including raising a child. If your parents followed the philosophy you put forward in this vid, you wouldn't be here to vlog.
If this is supposed to be solace for people who don't want to have kids then don't frickin title it in a way that's aimed at more than just those people.
I really liked this video and am not butt hurt at all (unlike almost this entire comment section). Thanks you guys, great stuff as always!
Greg's comment about being grumpy killed meüòÇüëèüèº
I don't understand these comments. What does the video have to do with white people? So what if the white gene dies out? It was probably meant to die out anyways. Humans are being more widely socially interactive than ever and since dark skin is more dominant than light skin it's more likely that all humans will become the same shade of brown in the future. It's just the way evolution works. The climate gets warmer so more dark pigmentation is needed. That's a good thing, you know (not climate change but pigmentation change). Do y'all wanna look like boiled lobsters when spring arrives? Overpopulation is a real thing, but still if you decide to have a child (or even two) that won't contribute much to the world population as the children will just replace their parents and well, not all children will grow up and be able to reproduce themselves. But adoption is a good alternative if you want to have a child because they're already in need of a loving parent. Also this topic has nothing to do with feminism or homosexuality wtf why is every comment section a war zone these days?
Where has this video been all my life.
C U L T U R A L  M A R X I S M\n\nGoogle it (watch out, Wikipedia and other fake news call it a conspiracy theory). And have as many white babies as you can.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2occ7m/wikipedias_cultural_marxism_article_now_redirects/\nShow less\nREPLY
Don't have children goyim, bring in immigrants to supplement your low birth rates
Two homosexuals telling heterosexuals not to have kids......seems legit!
The guy in the glasses has such a punchable demeanor, jesus christ I couldnt stand listening/watching him for more than 10 seconds, that was rough.
I wonder if it ever appeared to you that you can say all this shit because someone had you as their kid.
To the guys in this video... go green and kill yourself. Oh did I gender you right?
So don't have kids because... you're stressed and sleeping less and you have to spend money... HOLY CRAP NO ONE KNEW?!?! But hey no counter points for the fulfillment of having children or raising a family... that'll be just chocked up to personal choice unceremoniously while science (aka a select unverified unfalsifiable surveys is science now) proves why you shouldn't procreate because reasons say all satisfactions are equal... or something... when we're railing against a topic. Sure.\n\nAh well... kiddo number 4 is on the way. Screw your carbon footprint garbage, I'm more than happy to have more too since I can provide for them and I enjoy having them. All this is is a set of lame excuses to get people to leave you alone about having children... and if THIS is your response then you were never equipped or capable of being a good parent in the first place. /shrug\n\nNext up: Why you shouldn't swim in the ocean.... ITS WET!!\n\nFollowed by: Why you shouldn't stick your hand in fire... ITS HOT!!
Childfree people use basically the same logic as MGTOW. It is sad
You guys should totally grab a fucking knife and repeatedly stab your insides until you see the light and then spring towards the light so that your soul completely obliterates into nothing. That's why.
I can't take these two guys seriously lmao üòÇ
@Greg and Mitch, \nFor your next video, please enlighten us on how to minimize testosterone levels so we can be flabby and weak like you.
I've never wanted to dislike a video twice until now
stellar job mr.goldberg, but thankfully people in this comment section arent retarded
Being grumpy as fuck. How about you should have kids because it's not just about you.
You either want to have kids, accepting the responsibility, as well as the positives and negatives\n\nOr you don't\n\nThat simple
You shouldn't have kids because you might wind up with an Eric.

13 000 dollars for year ? That is +- 285 000 Kƒç, i must work 2 year to just earn so much money :D. That is ridiculles amout of money for one kid, here you could be caring some small orphanage with so much money for whole year :D.
Let's be honest. If the ONLY reason you're having a kid is to further your race/species or to spread your ideals, you're a selfish piece of shit.
How is anyone unaware of any of this?  Bottom line, having a child means devoting everything you are to raise a new human. If you are not ready both emotionally and financially for this huge responsibility on ....then don't.  Having a child means you need to stop thinking of yourself and/or your spouse first and switching to the child being priority number 1.  It's a huge burden but also a huge joy. And if you do it right you will help to shape someone who will be a good person.
Well, not having kids will greatly reduce the Carbon Footprint. \n\nThink of all the disposal diapers that won't go into the landfills.
I don't plan on having kids so I wholeheartedly agree with this video. I think childbirth in general is a moral issue as the life that you create never consented.
This is the only video yours that I disliked. Your audience doesn't need excuses why they shouldn't have kids (which is what you gave throughout the video), they will be making the decision on having a child based on emotional factors. All the reasons for not having a child are pretty superficial. I'm childless because I want to enjoy my life. 99% of my friends and co-workers are parents and they simply have no life. I want to have the freedom to go wherever I want, read a book, go study a new skill, play games, socialize, travel.... having a kid is detrimental to all that. The parents I met that tried to claim otherwise were REALLY deluding themselves. But most importantly, I don't see a child as some end-game goal for life. I'm living for myself, not some future kid. No wonder countries with superb living standards have negative birthrate, they know there's more to life than having kids.
0:20 This was kinda true with my parents.
tl;dr - Kids are expensive and challenging.\n\nHaving children is extremely rewarding if you have a stable relationship. Nothing in your life will compare to the day-to-day gratification that exist in a functional family
You know what, if you wanna halt climate change and resource draining, we have to kill welfare programs because people are just having kids in order to get free benefits.  That's a MASSIVE resource drain and will only hurt the earth.
As homosexuals you should be encouraging white people to have more kids, because Islamics and Africans are not exactly known for their tolerance of homosexuality and as more of them are imported the worse your lives are going to get.
1. Don't marry or have kids with someone who has a vastly different idea about how kids should be raised, and this won't be an issue. I mean, if only there was a way to talk to someone about what their ideas of raising kids are like before you marry them, right?\n\n2. Oh no! Not a little bit of sleep loss! I've probably lost more than 6 months of sleep in the last few years just from my education. Are you honestly trying to tell me that a little sleep loss is a good enough reason to not have children? This seems like an extraordinarily selfish reason, but then, you seem like extraordinarily selfish people. So that's not surprising.\n\n3. It has nothing to do with how hard you work? Are you fucking stupid? Do you not understand the consequences of the double standard you yourself have pointed out? Employers see fathers as being legally OBLIGATED to provide for their children, whereas they see mothers as people who can put their children first because they'll receive government assistance if they don't feel like working those extra 20 hours this week. So, yes, it has everything to do with how employers see you, because they've learned from experience that the parent who is legally obligated to work for their childrens' benefit is more likely to be hard-working.\n\n4. Of course a child is expensive. Why in the hell do you think people have to work for their living? At least, if you want the child to have a certain sort of lifestyle. On the other hand, the vast majority of the people in the world who have children aren't the kind of arrogant middle-class suburbanites that gave rise to the types of ideologies that produce the kinds of self-centered selfishness that you two are displaying.\n\n5. So your argument is that people who want to have kids and then have them are just as happy as the people who don't want to have kids and so don't have them? Your argument is that people who get their way are happy? How is this an argument? What about the people who are forced into having children when they don't want to, or the people who desperately want to have children, but can't? How does your argument affect them? Have you even considered these people, or does the idea that someone might not get their entire life on a silver platter so very alien to you that you can't even conceive of it?\n\n6. Sorry, but the environmental argument doesn't hold much weight for me. First off, we don't actually know what the carrying capacity of the planet is or could be. New challenges (in the form of higher populations and population densities) have triggered adaptations to technology before that have resulted in increased carrying capacity. There's no reason to think that that process will actually stop. As far as trying to go green go vegan and so forth, I'm not trying to do any of that. Most of us in the world aren't trying to do that. It's a very arrogant and very bourgeois set of ideas, but I guess you can't tell from your lofty perch.\n\nAs for the beginning of the video, you say no one should be telling you whether you can or can't have kids or whatever, but that's clearly what you're trying to do. And as for the people moronically arguing that this is an informative rather than a persuasive video, the title says it all. The title is the thesis, and you can't have a thesis like Why you shouldn't have kids if the point of your argument is not to persuade. Shouldn't is the key word, if you're wondering. You're smugly telling people how they shouldn't do something based on nothing more than some very flimsy and easily-countered arguments. It makes you come off as extremely immature, and generally morally bankrupt.
>overpopulation\n\nLiterally every single race other than white people are at fault for this statistically. Don't tell me I am doing something wrong when, by the numbers, I am not.
If 1 white kid is the equivalent strain on global resources than 100 Sub Saharan African kids, then surely we should slow the industrialisation of African countries before shit really hits the fan right?
hey, yea, why not weed yourself out of the gene pool?
So on the one hand you have propaganda for not having kids, and then use low population growth rates as an excuse to import Islamic migrants in the country. And then you wonder why the alt-right is gaining so much traction.
The next time someone asks me why I don't want children for the 1000th time I'm going to show them this video
Historians are going to look back on videos like this as primary evidence of why the Western World collapsed.
I'm not about to take life lessons from a guy that paints his fingernails.
Women are being fed this idea that it's somehow demeaning to want to be a mother and the truth of the matter is a very small minority of testosterone driven women who have careers (not jobs, a subtle but important distinction) are great at what they do and would probably suck at being a mother. Fair enough. However when you claim people who voluntarily choose not to have kids are just as happy as those who do I don't believe taking people on their word is reliable.  Most women over 35 with dead end jobs and no kids are miserable. How about making a video a video on the benefits of having kids as a way of staying consistent by offering both sides of the debate.
I G N O R E    (((S O D O M I T E)))   O R D E R S
So how about all the people in Africa, the Middle East, and south east Asia stop having 5+ kids.
The only babies these two genetic dead-ends could ever make are little turd babies.
Okay douchebags, a few things.\n\n1 - the whole overpopulation thing has long been discredited but still gets tossed around and believed by idiots\n\n2 - while there is no arguing whether or not raising children is difficult and pricey, and no one should have kids if they don't wish to; your whole video seems to miss the point that life is hard at times.  It is not a continual fun trip of parties and vacations on the Med Coast.  It took people striving and working to build the prosperous society we have today.  It did not just pop into existence.\n\n3 - I'm gonna take a wild guess and say both of you guys are staunch libs..... very likely Bernie Sanders supporters and   surely voted for Hillary.\n\nAs such, I'm certain you just LUUUUVVVVV all those free social programs Bernie and the Dems push.\n\nBut, in your short sighted and hedonostic thinking, fail to ponder the question of demographics.\n\nSimply put .... money.  All those free programs require, or will require, a fuck ton of money to pay for them.  That means society needs a solid base of working age people.  \n\nAs it stands now, the worker to retiree/beneficiary ratio has been  declining fir decades as a greater % of the population is over 65 as well as being enrolled in Medicaid.  That means an ever higher tax burden on those in the workforce.\n\nSo...... in closing ..... if you really LUUUUVVVVVVVVV all those free programs you should be encouraging people to have even more babies to support both of you in your old age\n\nCheers

Genetic dead end want to lecture me?
>We're mental defects who can't have kids therefore nobody should have kids\nYeah, nah fuck off
Super Cucks #CulturalMarxism
Speaking of health probs, teach us about distended anuses.
I still want kids...
Fucking degenerates kill yourselves
Two ugly losers.
You guys shouldn't have kids because you're an evolutionary failure that shouldn't reproduce. The real issue occurs when two degenerates with genetic error such as yourselves are allowed to adopt children that have healthy genes and brainwash them into biologically dysfunctional beings that refuse to do their main evolutionary purpose - to reproduce.\n\nAs for all Western Europeans and North Americans, ask yourselves what your state and the media is doing to you. Videos like this are on Trending but everyone who talks against obvious attempts to exterminate our race is either censored or marked as an evil racist who refuses to adapt progressive values and is therefore a danger to society.

Sodomites should NEVER have kids
Fuck off beta males
Fuck you
So fudge packers are now telling women whether or not they should have kids
Crazy how white people are so quick to call racism when they don't even know a thing about it...
2 homosexuals who cant have trying to rationalize why not having kids is a good thing and tryign to destroy tradional marriage.
Jesus, why is this entire comment section flooded with antisemitism and white genocide fears? What the fuck is going on with this world?
Better cast too
Movie looks awesome. Too many people dealing with that nostalgia I see
I was on the fence about this movie, but after seeing the trailer all the pieces are coming together. This will be great.
With Dwayne and Kevin in this movie I expect this to be great..
This looks wayyy better than the old one, what a step up!
2 o my fav peep in this movie Dwayne and the girl from doctor who and the circle
Noooo the cake scene could of been AMAZING but they spoiled it come onnnnnn cuz!!!! üò´
The Rock + Karen Gillan + Jack Black = Take My Money
This was a good idea
the board game was left on the video game for 20 years, and the magic was transfer from from board to the system. soooooo same magic jungle with update game world
Something tells me Nick Jonas character is also stuck in the game and have been for a long time.
Amy pond? Still getting into trouble...
Way to ruin a classic. You combined all the cancerous elements of modern day hollywood and wrapped it into one movie. And you wonder why people flee the movies in mass.\n\nFuck you, Hollywood.
Ain't the same with out Robin Williams.
I saw the trailer Lready it was the add at the start of the video
Hey Rock, how do you like that Illuminate cock?
there's 3 lives in each characters and im guessing there's one character will be doing some tragic scene with only 1 live left
Black Guy: Am I still black?\nGirl: yeah \nBlack Guy: Then I‚Äôm fine! \n*explodes* \nMe: *dead laughing*
So this is going to be a very different kind of movie than the Jumanji of '95, and that's a good thing.\nHMMM
This is better than the old jumanji
Wait your still alive?! My mom said you were dead HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE
Not good not cool I would just watch the original and the cartoon
First one was way better, seems like writers and producers, can not be creative, always have to use someone's else's ideas, if u only had a brain
Rip Robin Williams from the 1st one :/
So. What the fuck? It looks so bad it looks great!
For two decades it went untouched, until THE IP RESURRECTION WARS!
I'm really confused at this movie, but I guess the rock is in it so really can't be that bad.
Guessing Kevin has the cheat codes on hand
Ok don't get me wrong! Kevin hart, Dwayne Johnson and jack black are pretty cool but honestly this makes me really depressed and ticked off.. jumanji was supposed to be left alone and never remade.. that movie was a true classic.. and now they're literally making it into a big joke üòêüôÑ  Robin Williams would not be happy about this if he was alive.. just saying
Sees friend get sucked into tv.  Cool let's all try
amy pond thats all i care about
Sony\n\nI already don't trust this
Who's good at staring and not blinking..\nKevin Hart has a blinking seizure lol
Who see the end  ?
Kevin Hart is in it, pass.
still looks like crap to me
lmao, are there seriously people here saying this looks good? Jesus..
Just don't call it Jumanji.
This could go well or horribly considering it‚Äôs now a video game instead of the traditional board game and it can go well because it has an okay concept that will sell to many many young kids but it‚Äôs pretty unoriginal tho
Wonder if this movie is any good?
Does not look anywhere near as good as the original.  Might check it out to see whats up, but I was hoping for like somewhat of a remake or some shit.  Kind of makes we wanna relive the original Jumunji.
That will suck a huge donkey dick.... with some heavy ball cupping.. but good music..
So they wouldn't use this GNR song for Black Hawk Down ... But  this movie was ok?
What's up with all the simulation topics on trending lately?
to be honest they rouind  the movie ...
Jack Black is the only thing in this movie that looks good.
First complaint, There's nothing that connects it to the original except for the jungle. Its just a jungle with not enough animals running rampant. \n\nThey had a large number of animals in Just one scene. What kind of zoo-budget bullshit is this? Is it set in the wild, or the Bronx zoo?
Embrace for a 30% on RottenTomatoes!!
Bruh they turned a board game to a video game
This move looks horrible. An incredible mock to the amazing Jumanji movie.
Looks good but why would you call it Jumanji and ruin it?
Just becoz Kevin and Jack are in it am gonna watch it Bonus da Rock
Don't care what anyone says. Watching this because I love the cast with the exception of that Jonas douche. Why... just... why
Nick Jonas? Fucking Nick Jonas? Holy Shit that surprised me, love it!
When are you coming back to the wwe
I click this cuz I saw Kevin Hart in the thumbnail
Dont let this new body get yo but whooped.\n\n'Smack'\n\n*Smack*\n\nAaahhhww What the hell!\nLmaoo
I guess you can add cheating to Kevin Harts weaknesses...
I FREAKING READ THIS BOOK IN THIRD GRADE

Meh.

OMG IM SO EXCTED THIS IS SO COOL
This looks Cool lmao
No no no no what NOOO! But maybe yes?
Jumanji is an Eldritch Abomination.
About time
ha ha ha, very good !!!
2.31 Oh Shit.
Amy pond!!!!!!!!!!
Yessss do it
HOLY SHIT
SHAZAM
:)
üëå
Retarded
Looks amazing to me
I saw the first part which was great. This one looks quite boring. They shouldn't have named this movie Jumanji. Completely different format from first.
God awful! Yeah Hollywood just keep making the same shitty, poor quality CGI filled garbage you've been making eventually you'll strike gold üòë...\nThis is why movies are at an all time low. Just get um to the theater, fuck you you'll pay to see itüí©.
You ruined this movie.
Fuck the tomb raider trailer and this FUCKING HOLLYWOOD REMAKE SHIT!!!! You people are blind! Kill yourself's.
Straight up fucking up a classic. The idea is great exploring jumanji is fantastic. But shitty actors paired with lame new style Hollywood storyline fucks the whole thing up. I hate what the movie industry has become.
these fuckfaces really can't come up with anything decent these days can they‚Ä¶.
Pass. This looks utter garbage, three actors will have to try again in other better movies to recover from this monstrosity to be.

Sorry kev gonna be a bigger flop than soul plane
Ewwww someone tell me how this turns out. Im going to go watch the original to wipe this from my memory
So unnecessary and cliche. The Rock? Again? He keeps popping up in these cheesy remakes with his one-dimensional acting. He literally acts no different from one more to the next. Let's face it, it's his muscles that Hollywood wants, not his mediocre acting. We have the usual random black guy making an appearance uttering the yo /sarcasm .... Maybe it's my age. The original was so good especially with David Alan Grier and of course Robin Williams. This new one looks like a lump of slimy stinky leftover elf shit with a big shiny Hollywood red bow.
Jesus have these kids even seen the original!?
Didnt this already come out
hey piece shit say how is satan doing these days
It's really peaceful and so beautiful pain
My heart cries when he goes like ''Oooh love, do u feeel this rough, whys it u I am only thinking of.' DAYUM SON

niall went from being in the background to be in the forefront. finally his vocals are being showcased, his voice is a perfect harmony alone

Tyler: Why'd I get tagged in a picture of a shoe\nRachel: You look like a shoe\nTyler: I look like a shoe?\nVeronica comes in
Can you do more collabs with the merrell twins cuz I love the merrell twins and you Rachel
She should have said that she has a tide to go pen so he still wouldn't have noticed
The reason I don't watch ur vids no more its bc the other nd was better xD
I knew the coffee stain was gonna give it away. But part of me didn't think Tyler would even worry about the stain after he called it out like I thought he would just forget about it. That was so funny ahaha
One was wearing black nail polish and the other was wearing white
Haha he was hurt when Vanessa said she didn't want the s'mores
Please do a room tour
Who else has been writing for the merrell twins to meet Rachel . BEST DAY EVER!
Honestly I would've noticed because I am tell them apart
TBH people want a twin but I don't I only want one of me and no look alikes and what if she steals my boyfriend and my stuff and Idk I just don't want one

All the bad ones.
Banana Bread Recipe\n\n    Prep time: 10 minutes Cook time: 55 minutes Yield: Makes one loaf \n\nNo need for a mixer for this recipe! Clean-up is easy too, if you want, you can mix everything in one mixing bowl.\n\nThe best bananas to use for banana bread are those that are over-ripe. The yellow peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.\nIngredients\n\n    2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled\n    1/3 cup melted butter\n    1 teaspoon baking soda\n    Pinch of salt\n    3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)\n    1 large egg, beaten\n    1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n    1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour\n\nMethod\n\n1 Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.\n\n2 In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.\n\n3 Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.\n\n4 Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour at 350¬∞F (175¬∞C), or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.\n\n5 Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)
-I hate the way they minimized Mike's story in the new version. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the new adaptation, but Mike was basically the historian of the group. As well as the racism plaguing Mike and his family, it should have been included. It was a vital point in the book and film and explained why Henry targeted Mike a lot more and made him more than just the token black kid for diversity points.-
6:06  to be more blunt in the book she gets ganged banged by the rest of the boys willingly
My favorite is 2017 IT movie It got better graphics and Cool stuff\n*And even more scary*
Stephen King is such overrated garbage. I've read five of his books and he is not the horror god he is made out to be.
I just saw It today and I thought it was amazing! I had my doubts but I'm happy that the movie was better than I thought it would be.
This movie was so amazing. Like wow. I just saw it today.
It sucks him dry wth that's is weird
do Top 10 Moments in Alabama Crimson Tide Football
hey It why don't you just float
I just watched the full It (2017) and I'm now watching this video an hour later\nHope this won't make my Coulrophobia even _worse_ as I was terrified of clowns to begin with. Watch It and it's worse. Hope this won't make me stay away from _circuses_
The bully in the 2017 version\nHella looks like my old neighbor.
More gruesome doesn't mean better. The TV version did fine by fading out at George's death. We knew what happened and it was still terrifying.
I like seeing that I'm not the only one that thinks this movie is a fucking beast
In Canada it is rated 18+
The killer clown trend better not start up again
I wish the newer one and it's so cool it doesn't even give you nightmares Pennywise is not even mentioned they just call it and then spoiler alert one of them breaks their arms and then they never going to be with them ever again in Georgie if you come you'll float too all of it everything will float even you
Despite many changes, I did enjoy the 2017 movie except for when (and how) the losers get to the sewers and how Bowers was handled. The movie really fell apart in that last quarter. :P Even cutting out the 'gang bang', they could have played that out the same way in the book, with the bullies following them as well.  Regardless, still enjoyed it and look forward to part II.
We all float in the dead sea
Just saw the 2017 version yesterday. They also changed some of the fears the kids had to deal with. I actually liked the idea of being afraid of water, and the movie, I Was A Teenaged Werewolf. I think the only thing they could've done better w the 2017 version is slow the progression of the movie down. That's what made the mini series great. You, as the audience were investing more time w the kids as they bonded together, but what I watched yesterday did feel a little rushed.\nThe other thing about the 'timeline' idea was the mini series gave the backgrounds of the adults as each character was introduced. I absolutely loved the dialogue that Ben Hanscom has w his lover - I was a butterball. As kids we all have those awkward phases we go through, and like Ben, I went through that same phase in high school. I always had that pudgy extra weight that I carried around. Now, I'm not extremely fit, but I've done better than some other guys who've struggled w their weight, so I best identify w Ben Handscom. I'm not married yet, but if you saw the mini series, there's a little something about two certain people, w/o giving the ending of Chapter Two for next year.\nOh, one more thing, I think if you've read the book or saw the mini series, this is a plus, because some horror movie fans will walk into the theater to watch this year's version and have no clue as to what they're watching,......
How did they get to say the N word on the tv series.
I don't know why but i loved when the clown popped right out of the screen and became huge.
Why is this cunt still narrating the videos?
The kids fucked in the book
The 2017 version is more terrifying and a truer adaptation of the book overall. \n\nIf you polish a turd it's still a turd. It was farthest from an adaptation as you could get in my opinion. The dynamics, the characters, any sense of subtlety that the book had was lost to modern horror movie stereotypes and lazy writing.
Then mike #7 came back as candyman...see why you have to fuck with him üòÇüòÇ
Man, I haven't seen this channel in ages. These guys have gone this desperate for ideas? Damn.
IT 2017 was not a remake of the 1990 one!!!!!
It 2017 is the best horror move ever
I‚Äôd float for an early copy of Super Mario Odyssey.
Got to read the book
Top 10 things that what did differently?
The character of Pennywise is an allegory for the homosexual pedophiles that prey on young boys. You'd be shocked just how common this type of behavior is within the homosexual community. Scary. üò∞
This IT clown doesn't look scary, looks like a chipmunk or rabbit. Maybe they have bubonic plague.
You guys fucked up they did have Georges funeral in the 2017 movie
Why is this on trending?
Moito loko
I dislike IT videos not because I don't like them but because I feel I need to even it out because people are freaking out over it like calming down people.
Watch mojo logic\n1. Clowns appearance\n2. Actors for the loser\n3. Actor for Pennywise\n4. Actor for silts\n5. Directer\n6. The movie length\n7. Time of the movie
The top 1 thing IT did differently. \n\nRobbed me of 135 minutes and $23. This movie is gayer than 8 guys blowin 9 guys. Waste of time and money. If you have not seen it yet, but intend to, i suggest buying a pack of razor blades before you go, so you can open a vien after the opening credits. HAVA GOODN
Here's one thing they did differently, actually made a good movie
sorry. went down another rabbit hole.....  didn't like the first one... won't watch the second..... I thought it was a waste of time.....
I watched the new It film, I liked it.
So are we just going to ignore the fact that the balloon is a different color 27 years later?

Lmfao found a leak to the whole movie https://youtu.be/1Oq5Q2G9rj8
So Beverally had an orgy with the losers club?
The old It was more scary
The clown‚Äôs run is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen...
I thought the original IT was a horrible film.
The new one was pure shit.
I want this comment to float to the top please.
What happened to the orgy scene?
1990 the clown is kinda scary but he looks nice
I'm not watching IT! It was a nightmare when I was when I was a kid, it'll be hell now I'm grown up trying become friends with party clowns -- never mind, until I meet a clown with a beautifully made-up face, I'll just stay away from them again.
I just got home from seeing it and I was blown away! it was hands down the best and most SCARY movie I have ever seen. I cannot believe how well made this movie was. a must see!!!!!

Saw the movie the first time it was announced to theaters. You won't believe how many people were there, the whole building was packed. But the movie was lit tho, so was the actor for Pennywise. He fits the character so well.
My sister: How will we float? Me: We lose gravity bitch
What did differently?
i enjoyed both old and new, but I still prefer the old one, I don't think the child actors are that good in the new one, all the child actors in the old one were just perfect, and the new one over exaggerated the profanity, what are these kids like in 7th grade, it just sounds ridiculous hearing them curse every other sentence. I also prefer Tim Curry's performance over this new guy, as well as pennywise design also the soundtrack was a lot better in the old one, the only thing i liked better in this one, was that they actually showed what each kid was afraid of, but the old one, they just showed pennywise, also the cgi was garbage in the new one.
The losers in 2017 adaptation looks alike everything... Execept the losers.
*Check out my Remix of Pennywise!*  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GoRXJ-GzUM
For me the scene with the Paul Bunyan statue was very terrifying. Don't get me wrong, this is my favorite Stephen King adaptation by far. I just wish they had put that scene in the film (especially since I spotted the statue in the background).
I decided to watch this movie on my phone at night, alone. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWtf is wrong with me?üòÇ

Hey was upppppppp!!!!
i swear i adore tamera üòç she's honestly such an inspiration to me she's‚Äã such a strong independent woman a great mother and brilliant wife like she's so wise and intelligent she teaches young girls like me that being intelligent and having morals and being classy is sexy as a 16 year old girl I think she should be a role model to any young girl she's my sista sista üòÇ‚ù§üëè
Only 1 minuteüò¢ I really want more real
What words of wisdom ? You just cut her off tf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
:/ I wanted to hear the rest *^*
haters only have a problem with certain interracial couples. e.g.\na black man with a white woman rarely gets any hate.\nbut a black woman with a white man brings on a lot of hate.\nit's pathetic.
This is the kind of girl chat I was looking forward to this season but these seconds long video urgggg stopppp
Dang Tamera's hair style thoooo
When are they gonna upload the whole segments like Wendy Williams? üòí Just upload the damn thing.
Im in an interracial relationship and I can relate to tamera and adam when it comes to people saying racist things on both sides. It really takes ALOT of love to overcome all of the hate in the world.
Dang, Tamera looks so good! üòç
I like how she made the point that she heard racist stuff from both white people AND black people. Some people swear that black people can't be racist.
Teach em mama
she is biracial so no matter she dates black or white its still going be an interracial relationship anyway....
Haha Loni is making sure they stay right on schedule! 0:45 Thirty seconds
Even if she married a black man, wouldn't it still be interracial?
Her mom is right. Some white men are fake and only want to experiment being with a black or Asian girl and not actually take it seriously. Her mother was just being protective. Tired of these 30 second videos though. Glad I unsubbed
I don't really understand why her mom would be against it since she married a white man?? And I know it's because they had a hard time but if she chose him for love then wouldn't she trust Tamera also chose Adam that way.
You guys are ridiculous with these clips... you didn't even let us hear the end of her sentence. This is not gonna make more people tune in to the live show... people work and don't have the luxury to record shows!!! HELLO!!
people in the comments section be so annoying, I swear yall always want to fight
love Tamara in white
Jasmine curry: I agree with you about tamera. She's an honest woman and very classy. I love her words of wisdom, and although I'm not in an interracial relationship,  I'm married to a black man. I can understand where her mother was coming from, BUT, I also believe that as a woman, or man, it shouldn't matter what race the person is that you love. If that person treats you with respect and loves you unconditionally,  a mom or dad should respect that.
It's freaking 2017, are people really still bitching about interracial relationships???
this was real disrespectful, y‚Äôall couldn‚Äôt let Tamera finish her story tho üò©üò≠
I love The Real and I've been watching since the begging here on YouTube cause I can't see it on my tv in Brazil, but now the videos are too short and out of context...what's happening? I wanna see the real talk, their opinions, their beliefs and their discussion about something and not only two sentences
ok, i need to see the rest NOW!!!!!!!
Su rude to just cut off the video where it did...we didn't get to finish hearing the message. Smh. :/
I'm a black female but I love every race and colour
That's awesome advice. I met Tamera's dad...sweet guy!
The editors at the real youtube are really not professional! WTH can we do with a less than a minute of the show?  \nThat's really annoying, and for that reason why I unsubscribed of this channel
Tamara put love before what people thought. .like every should! Go Tamera
Tamera looks so pretty
black women love dem white boys
She's already biracial so either way it would be an interacial relationship! So why when you are biracial black is ok but white no?? Why does the black takes over the white??? (Because of the one drop rule??)
If you going to show us short clips the least you can do is let Tam finish her sentence ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
dang, y'all couldn't even give us a full minute?
Wow I Felt This One
Are Tameras parents still together?
I refuse to date/marry outside my race.
Why are the videos coming out so short?!
that last part is dope
I'm so confused is this the episode that aired today? Because this isn't what I saw on tv. Can someone please explain that to me.
I was about to get in my feels until I realized the video had ended , lmao y'all play too much:,(

Lol her mom sounds super narrow minded. Is she forgetting that Tamera is half white??? Ridiculous! Your own people are the ones who create racism (this applies to every race, mostly)

Great video Girl
Use glitter glue mannnn
Loooove this eye look ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Yeah that concealer looks so cakey
Good job... NAIL. üòÇ
Try out fenty beauty
Love this ‚ù§Ô∏è
You have beautiful natural lashes!
i thought she looked so great after she finished her foundation and concealer!
Where did you get the shirt at in this video?? Loveeee it
Hands down the best foundation out there! #becca
I found that sponge-tipped applicators are best for laying down finger only shadows. The texture is similar to finger tips.
personally I don't mind using my fingers but I would prefer the option of a brush. I LOVEEE this eye look... made me want that palette :)
Omg love that new huda beauty palette, I've been wanting a review of it for a while but I freaking want it and I love the eye look on you Casey good job with the video and keep up the good work üëçüëç‚ù§‚ù§
I love when I use shimmers and glitters with my fingers. I just think it's easier. As far as the Dermalogica primer, I hated it. I have dry skin, and it made my skin oily. My foundation looked like a hot mess at the end of a few hours. üò¢
Your face when the doorbell rang üòÇüòÇüòÇ I love this eye look on you, it's gorgeous!
i have the huda rose gold pallet..im not crazy about it..the mattes are okay..the two pearl shades are beautiful..the textured shadows i found difficult to work with..and generally i prefer a finger application for my lid with any shimmer shade..i like the richness of color i get from finger application..i found the light shades in the textured shadows very patchy and difficult to distribute evenly across the lid..and i found the deeper shades in the textured shadows..the deep red and the bronzy color much smoother and easier to work with..but overall..i never reach for the pallet ..there is something in the formula of the textured shadows that the skin on my eye lids dont react well to..my eyes burn and itch all day while wearing them so i dont use the pallet
Love and miss your dark hair! And the natural hair waves! Looks sleek when you put your hair at the back!
Casey you look amazing and that top is so cute!!!!! üåª
You should test out the dermacol foundation! I think you'd really like it!
I know I personally always use my finger to apply any glitter eyeshadows because it makes them pop more (but I have the same issue, can‚Äôt be extremely precise, so then I go in with a flat brush to clean up)
Hi Casey! I've actually been challenging myself to use one palette for the work week and I recently used the Rose Gold Palette! I really enjoyed this palette a lot! I really hadn't used it since I purchased it, so its been awhile. But wearing the Rose Gold Palette worked out in my favor this past work week!
I prefer finger and then go in with a brush to add more or to perfect the lines since fingers are not precise when in comes to a good line on the lid .
I can't use my fingers to apply eyeshadow. I don't think I get it on my lid well, and I hate when my hands are in my way! Haha
I ALWAYS use my finger for my shimmers all over the lid. Way better payoff and i find it pretty easy and fast.
Was literally at ultra today trying to remember which essence mascara you loved üò© what was it called?
The color schemes of both of the palettes are pretty similar or the price!
looooveeeeee it!!! btw you don¬¥t pronounce the N in monsieur
Casey, I think your Smashbox highlights look so much nicer on your skin than the two in this video!
Lmfao at the fact that ppl voted no for the kkw review lmao
Does anyone know what Huda lip strobe she was comparing the Ciate one to?
what essence mascara were you talking about?
I love those milk makeup lippies! I wore cream and wifey for my wedding in August! It gave me a very subtle ombr√© lip!
Can you try out the Mac eyeshadow pallet x 15? I would love to see what you think about it!
I'm obsessing over that mascara!
I tried the rose gold palette and had to return it, I just didn't like it
I love Casey and she's my go to YouTuber but I can't afford anything she likes üò≠
Always love your eye looks!
Girlllllll!!!! I am not in to the super sparkly shadows, but you don't this look makes me want to try it out!
That satisfaction you feel when you hear the packaging like rustling, is called ASMR. There lots of people who do asmr videos on youtube. They range everything from eating sounds to different kinds of paper crinkling, gum chewing or popping, haircut sounds (like scissors cutting hair) or coloring in a book or whispering while reading...so many things its insane! Alot of people even enjoy makeup videos because they find it gives them asmr aswell. Its not the reason i watch them but hey, whatever floats your boat lmao
I wouldn't buy a palette where you had to use your finger to apply it. It's one thing to choose to do that and another to get no pigment unless you do. Pink Eye is realüëÄ people.
do you still use the bumble and bumble shampoo and conditioner?! your hair is literally always so pretty even when its not done!!And its so hydrated lol. Love this look also! xoxo
When daisy and rose started barking my dog started barking and freaking out üòÇüòÇ
Granted, I don't use NEAR as concealer as Casey, but I use 2 or 3 dots of Tarte Shape Tape, and 2 dots of the Milani she used on my under eye.  This combo for me, covers and brightens and does a great job.
Literally I freaking LOVE the eyes their so insanely beautiful üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I want that eyeshadow palette so bad üò≠
Yes i would 100 percent buy a palette that required you to use your fingers, sometimes your fingers are the best tools and there is always baby/make-up wipes to clean your finger up after :) x
FYI the MILK makeup lip in the color C.R.E.A.M isn't new... I've had it for over a year.
Laying down, eating a large cup of italian ice... my guilty pleasureüò≠ \n2 videos wont hurt.. i said\n5 videos later.... \n4:00am... oh boy...
Img your should do a collab with Chloe morello. U remind me of her
Your lips are like perfectly filled in this vid like they look so pretty here <3
Ok I'm so sorry I love your channel but Omg you low-key look like Allisa Violet in the thumbnail, sorry for being annoying but no one has seemed to notice.
I always apply any lid eyeshadow with my fingers, it's the best way to apply shimmers. I love both of Huda's palettes ! üòâ
Yes to more throwback throwdown videos! The YSL babydoll is still my favourite mascara üôãüèº
The entire video I could NOT stop looking at your eyeshadow!!! Now I need the Huda palette
That lip combo is beautiful!!!  Also, I enjoyed seeing a look sans false eyelashes.
Using my finger doesn't bother me for the lid. I always use them actually. I wash my hands first though. And I never break out from it! Xoxoxo
I wish I had your makeup skills girlüíú so pretty!
Your videos literally give me joy!! Thankyou for being super amazing at making YouTube videos and super amazing at makeup!!‚ù§Ô∏è
I pretty much always apply my lid shade with my finger. I just feel like it's so much more pigmented that way. But I also don't have fake nails. And what someone said earlier about the cheapy foam applicators is so true!
I really enjoy applying shadows with my fingers
I love how you've been coming out of your comfort zone and using vibrant colors on your eyes! The looks are GORGEOUS and you still look like Casey lol. xoxo
I don‚Äôt mind applying eyeshadows with my finger, sometimes it‚Äôs the easiest or fastest way to get some color pay off. Also I love your honesty in all your videos and the fact that you can be yourself! Thank you girl for the video!
I love this video so much üòçüòçüòçüòç
Living for that eye look.
Your eyes are stunning in this video!! Love the look
Hey:) does anyone have the lancome and the becca highlighter and could tell me the difference between these two?:) bc i think about purchasing the lancome one but im not quite sure since they look kinda similar and i already own the becca champagne Pop..ü§î
Who else thinks she looks like alissa violet?
I love this look! So pretty. You're always gorgeous Casey!
i REALLY like that foundation on you !
Going to pass on this palette but since I use a lot of Colourpop I don't mind applying with my fingers because that is the best way to use the super shock shadows. Tfs.
My favorite makeup is becca the only makeup I use
Using an old school eyeshadow sponge works like your finger. I can't use my finger bc I end up looking crazy.
I usually apply my lid shade with my finger
Girl you do great.... You make it look easy! I have a feeling i would get annoyed with it. üò¨
That moment you realize Casey Holmes is in a movie on netflix üòçüòçüòç i pretty much died inside.
‚ÄúI feel like I look like I lost 10lbs‚Äù üòÇüòÇ I love these kind of videos! Love you Casey! üíï
I must admit I never use a brush for my eye make up and I use my ring and pinky fingers for application, I know that can be really difficult with nails and a lot of people say it will mess up my shadows because of my oils. I still do it. lol make up is for fun and what ever works best for you is what people should just go with :) love you miss Casey!
I like applying shimmers with my fingers bc it gives me the best results when i want it super shimmery. i usually use a brush to touch it up or blend it in with the mattes but i think using your fingers in makeup in general is a great tool.
Do people just choose random names for eyeshadows like how does it work lol
I absolutely love ur eye look! Now I want that palette üôÑ
Ok I think that the bronzer / contour looks amazing on you üò©üò©üò©
Casey I love you so much! I need advice. Huda beauty Palette or Natasha denona. And if so which one!?! Xoxo
I use a glitter glue for ANYTHING SHIMMER/glitter. I just makes that sparkly sh*t look so much pigmented and there's no fall out
Have you tried the new fenty foundation?? How did you like it?
I hate applying shadow with my fingers. I have long nails and chubby fingers, so it is not at all precise. I know people hate them, but the cheap little sponge tips are the closest alternative I can find to your fingers. They apply these types of shadows wonderfully.
I prefer fingers for the lid because the shadow is a lot more pigmented that way and pops a lot more. Brush for crease.
You‚Äôre stunning casey üò≠üíñ i love your videos so much!
Please do a full face or as close as you can get of throwback thrown down!
Anyone knows which essence mascara she is talking about? Thanks
I apply almost all my glitter shadows with my fingers instead of spraying my brush
The eye look in this video is EVERYTHING wow
Casey you could try using a sponge applicator to put the shimmery/glitter shadows.  Loved this look you've come up with today xx
Casey you have to collab with nikkie, I love her and you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Stupid question, why not try one of those foam eyeshadow brushes for the glitters? Like the O.G eyeshadow brushes that come in the cheap palettes.
Wow I love that eye makeup!!
Ooh I love that gloss on you!! So pretty

I once heard this story, not sure if its true, but it was about some dude who barely ate anything in prison so he could slip through the bars of the cell and escape. When he did escape his gang threw a big party with lots of food, but the guy died due to eating too much right after having not eaten anything for so long.

I think she will be a good mom. The way she treated King and loves on all her older friends and sisters kids, you can tell she genuinely loves children. She's not a huge party girl, shes kind of a homebody. This is obviously what she wants in life lets be happy for her.
She's single white female obsessed with blac chyna, wants her own baby dream only thing hers gonna look like a ballsack.
wow. the fagness in this video is out of control. fuck off perez hilton you fag
Kylie will be a single mom sadly
I honestly don‚Äôt believe she is pregnant. In my opinion, I think this story was made up for their upcoming 10th anniversary season and to hype up Kylie‚Äôs second season of her show. Kris is probably the one who called tmz lol but If Kylie is showing and her family and friends knew about it..then why share it now?! ü§î And if for whatever reason this is 100% true, then I wish nothing but the best for her and that child
Lol Perez! I agree. I just would have liked for her to do have done something unpredictable. Like we didn't see this coming.
This guy Perez is so feral, so false in his opinions and insane. Listen to his voice and that should tell you about the substance of the man. He is the perfect product of a society gone mad and would be branded as weird and disgusting by any other race of people not living in these self loving, self interested times. Disgusting human being who has climbed the cherry tree for being exactly that.
Obv the dude here has no moral fibre anyway .\nProb operates a gloryhole for guys to put thier dicks through so he can suck them
i hate to agree, but.... that was the first thing i thought. good for business indeed. sad part about all of this? all her fans are going to follow her lead.
Who are you again? I guess you're just trying to stay relevant, you washed up gossip column writer. You have no right to tell someone to have an abortion.
YouTube unsubscribed me I think.....but doesn't matter I follow u on twitter! Lol great video.
Thanks Perez for telling the reality, and giving your true opinion and real advice. I am glad this video isn't about praising and supporting Kylie not everyone is perfect. This is something I dont support many people dont support and she will lose fans over this. Selena Gomez is the real deal she is the real talent and needs to be talked about more.
If this is true there ain't no way that guy will stick around. He'll be there at first and I'll bet he'll be out banging some new girl. They always do that.
She's 20 and she has all the money anyways and she have her famous rich family to help her out.. young and not ready to be a mother but she can afford it so good for her.. Don't hate congratulate..
One notices that the maker of the video had a mother that didn't have an abortion...more's the pity.
Drama ..a lot drama will happen with those two...she is so stupid to get pregnant,  poor baby
she is not a good role model as I thought for young women
The video was only 1 sec in and the cringe escalated so quickly.
She's having a baby, yet she doesn't know how to do laundry, and still acts like a teen who's love struck. Good luck to her.
Apparently she's had a few abortions already so if she had another one it could affect her having children.
She's an adult, a multi millionaire, and has a supportive family.
Took a glance at her snapchat ig and saw several videos of her just staring at herself while eating, driving, etc..... I dont have the best impression of her. ..\nBut she's said she's wanted to be young when she had kids. Early 20's young. And shes constantly alluding to how bored and depressed she is with life at least in interveiws..people just dont understand me. My IG isn't me. then adding money doesnt make you happy...  yes, Im able to buy 500 cars and cant decide which to drive on sundays...but....that joy doesnt last... I want to find myself etc etc.. Im more inclined to beleive shes bored and depressed an  thinks slapping a family together and having a kid with joe schmoe might be interesting; rather than it being an accident. (I just realized thats actually what Rob and chyna did. She planned wanting another kid. and he thought it would help him get his shit together..) we all know how that turned out.
Who let this faggot on a loose
what if kylie's actually kim's surrogate?
You remind me of the gringe I love it !!! You are soso fucking real !!
It's an opinion y'all take shit to the ass
I'm glad my mother was never too permissive. This is the result of excess of freedom. Her mother was ok with her dating that Tyga. Now she finds it normal to date this thug looking individuals. She will hit the floor really hard. The girl is very insecure, doesn't have a job or a purpose in life, no wonder. Her father wanted them to go to college her mother was against it. Very sad
Being a mom is the most or biggest responsibility but also rewarding at the same time. It's a privilege having a child and he/she deserves a loving,kind, and patient  mother to nurture her/his up bringing. It's a beautiful process if you appreciate being a mom but if you're a spoiled brat like them, having everything in life, a baby will be the biggest struggle in her life specially guiding that baby without proper guidance.
your faggot self is jealous that a woman can do what you can not do. who are you to tell  her what to do with her body
If you were... But your not Kylie's mum so the cheek of mentioning abortion. Who are you to judge the relationship between Kylie and Travis. Who are you to talk about her life being pregnant at 19. People get pregnant at 19 its normal üòï
Is there any kind of retroactive abortion for the whole family?
I love you Perez. You're so honest.
Why he is Yelling??? Dude Stop! does people still go to perezhilton anymore, he is so 2010..LOL
Everyone should just mind their own business and leave her alone. Only she knows if she should have the kid or not.
shut up not all young moms are irresponsible!Talking about abortion because you mad adam and steve cant make kids!Go adopt another dog... filth.üòí
.. And hes so ugly eww?!  All that money and no taste! üòùand yes Abortion!  I agree
You don't even sound pro-choice, you just sound pro-abortion. I'm pro-choice & that means I respect a women's right to choose, no matter what that choice is. I had my beautiful daughter when I was 19 & I'm a great mom. I also got married when I was 28 & have two children with my husband at 29 & 33 & it's rough when you're older. Obviously she's rich & can take care of this baby that I'm sure she wants, it's not like she has to wait to finish college or save money or get married, so who cares?!?!
Another addition to the freak show. Who gives a shit about as much important as this ass talking
Tyga dodge a bullet big time ... Travis Scott + The real Kylie = ugly baby.
you need a xanax big-time Perez.. .far too wound up....
The best hair transplant result I've seen. Who was the doctor, fue or fut? More than two rounds? Share.
Your child should have been aborted so he wouldn't have to be raised by you. See how that's messed up to say a child should be aborted?
Go kill YOURSELF, you snotty little cunt. ¬†Who the FUCK are you to tell anyone to kill their baby? ¬†I hope you die of rectal cancer.
Kim was pregnant with Kanye's baby while married to Kris Humphries.  Kourtney was pregnant three times while married to nobody.  The only reason Khloe hasn't gotten pregnant out of wedlock is because she's physically unable to get pregnant.  Kyle pregnant after knowing a guy 4 months means she was pregnant after knowing him for one week.  Rob got Chyna pregnant after one week.  The only one left is Kendell.  Please Kendell, don't follow in your siblings footsteps.  PLEASE - for all children's sakes.
Thank youuuuu Perez. You're so right. I've read that her family is thrilled. Of course they are. They also say she's a businesswoman who runs her company. They're the definition of willful blindness. \n\nPerez is right about Blac Chyna too. That bitch gets pregnant five minutes after meeting any guy with some money. Then she's never with them. She's so gross. üëéüèª
True. That girl dates the ugliest rappers and ghetto looking!! She just ruined the whole family;s race lol
Blac Chyna isn't broke, she just doesn't have Kris Jenner millions of dollars..ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
She's too young.
I hope this is just a publicity thing and it's not true! I just can't believe that a 19 years old girl could have a baby üë∂! She can't even drink alcohol at 19 so how she's gonna make it with a kid?????
perez you‚Äôre such a bad person, she shouldn‚Äôt get an abortion.. someone should push her down the stairs it‚Äôs a lot cheaper!!
As much as I hate North Korea. It wouldn't be a loss if LA got bombed first.
If ppl don't think this is a pr move your dumb.
I don't think she's really pregnant
there dad must be turning over in his grave ,,sins of thy father fall on thy children,,,there a discrace too white folks and the black folks dont want them either!!  there all going to hell for there love of money
shame on you, you are not the parent of the year, how dare you say that and you take baths with your foster daughter, just because you adopted some kids does not mean you know it all
I do think Kylie planned it. These women in that family treat having children like the next accessory. It's very sad.  Does she realize she can't have all the synthetic beauty treatments while preggers? This girl is too young to know what parenting is but she is so rich she can pay others to do the brunt work. SMH
Porn unborn child? The only poor children here is yours like imagine how disgusting would be calling someone like you ''dad.''
He just says what we're all thinking..  but Perez she's 20.. lol so technically she's not a teen. \nIf this is true... it's scary.
no abortion let her have it since she wanna be grown

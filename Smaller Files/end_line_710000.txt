Excelente, la voz de Dave exquisita y sensual y la música oscura pero muy fresca. Me encantó más que los singles de spirit
peccato per un video cosi' fuori luogo e truce
Bellissima la musica è la voce di dave sempre grandiosa e sensuale!! Questo pezzo è  travolgente! Lo adoro dal primo ascolto! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Słucham i słucham całkiem to dobre
LYRICS pleae. I love this song
I WANT THEM TO DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE..  or another song like fragile tension or in symphony they really need to go back to that sound or speak and spell to bring the 80's sound back at least one song like dreaming of me that was a real good song
This Sound is very deep. \nThe Beat is very dark.  \nSometime we need dark and deep things in our Lifes.  \nBut if you sell yourself into the Darkness, you will never be the same Person anymore. It's your Choise, when you even sell your whole body and soul to the Darkness. Sorry Dave Gahan, but this is not my music and not my World. Satanic, Diobolic, whatever. Not every deep music is so dark like this Song, but l will only listen to the beauty of music itself. You have dissapointed me.
worst song of 2017
Yay, Ryan's Cooking Show! 10/10!!
omg Ryan's Cooking Show pls make this a thing!! with cheesy music and everything!
is there a specific recipe Ryan followed, or did he just wing it? that pasta looked sooooo goooooood I want to make it!
ryan's so funny :D
I am REALLY impressed by that transition at 5:07 Grace, well done!\n(I genuinely love you guys' creativity and content in general, but this one just really stood out to me...)
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Big spider??  It's so spindly!  Just a cellar spider; totally harmless.
I see Ryan likes spices, garlic and basil. An handsome englishman who likes mediterrean ingredients?\nActually that nice pasta is some kind of Amatriciana, rather than Carbonara. They both have bacon inside but they are totally different; i adore them both anyway.
I think He is good at cooking. Great
Good day to you madam
Mmm, I want Ryan's cooking
Love you guys! Xx❤️\n\n\n\n\nAnd your vlogs! Xx❤️
Ur vlogs r so cool
4:00-4:08 vibes 😂 same

Wow!\nHow old is the building?\nLooks quite old.  Lots of work.
Yay, food! but what is 5:23?

colinfurze in a nutshell:\n\n\n\nslap a random cheap remote on a random thing available to him and outcomes a object you can CLEARLY tell it took more than 2 sec to make... also if you do it wrong, it make just go everywhere
You mixed up normally closed and normally open...\nClosed means a closed circuit - so current can flow.\n\nAlso, those abbreviations... NO. I mean, that's literally a word :D\nAnd NC... I thought that was No connect at first, lol.

YOU SHOULD MAKE THE ATTACK ON TITAN MOBILITY GEAR
Unsubscribed because I keep getting your youtube red garbage in my feed. Not to mention half of your videos are ads to begin with, having paid content makes your content no longer worth my time.
Hi Colin,\nJust wanted to let you know that because my subscription feed is now full of previews for your Youtube red channel I will be unsubscribing.   I just want to see your cool videos and not very interested in the tease.\nThanks, goodbye.

Hey I got an idea for you to do I'm making a real school bus that looks like it can fly but it does hovers in there but a bus can I see in the government apartments in to the scenery glad you are where I live
What the hell man, relax.
Chewbacca's face actually looks raw and unfinished
How about in the ground
I'd like to see a video of Kylo going to see the movie.  At the concessions stand, the phrase 'You know I can take whatever I want' seems appropriate.
what about in the ground XDD
Dr. Emmett Brown: There's that word again RAW! Why is everything so raw in the future, is something wrong with our ability to shower?
What's Christmas?  I lost it
That right..there be no making up or saying I hate so cause i ducking hates you, hide and run away to my apartment and never call you again and only text for money which mine anyways and my mom trying to change me back into the little girl I was and I say no mom..you don't know Dad
yep Kylo Ren your my boy I'm rooting for you man
Why is this trailer so raw?\nBecause that's how the Old dirty bastard likes it.
I need someone to show me my place.\n\n\nYeah in the ground
Every time he laughs I lose it
1:41 Who’s that handsome devil?
Kylo Ren you are the second character to break Star Wars tradition.  Don't say the actual title in a sentence in your own dimensional universe.  😂You only use the title at the introductory of each story without actually saying it unless it's an audiobook.  After that keep it %101 anonymous while the stories are being told.😅
1:42What the hell man relax!😂😂😂😂
When I first saw the force awakens, I hated kylo. Now due to you guys he's my favourite character!
Yes I love these
*THERE WILL BE NO TRUCE* more  evil laughter *WHOA TICKETS AVAILABLE NOW?*
What's christmas? Lost it. XD
this is my new favorite thing on the internet
I thought Kylo would be a Reylo shipper. In the ground not in my bed?
These are the greatest videos ever 👍
Hey a good idea for the future would be to do a 10 things that would make star wars better like you did with the hobbit
Tyrion kills his father????? WTF KYLO THANKS FOR THE SPOILER
I mean you say it's 100% certified raw...but is it organic too?
Star Raws:  The Last Jedi
I can't wait for Kylo to see Blade Runner 2049 and go you're still alive!?
Please let *_RAW_* turn into a meme
I really  enjoy  the Kylo  Ren, I  would  to  see  how  the Hitler reaction  to the Last Jedi  is going  to be  like.
THIS STEAK IS SO RAW, SUPREME LEADER SNOKE WANTS TO TRAIN IT TO USE THE FORCE!
How about in the ground? Lol 😂 (extends hand) what!?? Hahaha
I'm more excited for the new Jedi Party than the actual movie
This is a good gimmick you have here. Might as well have Kylo Ren reactions to various trailers and commercials; including outside of the Star Wars franchise...if you can let us vote or decide in the comments sections then you can draw real hype to this channel.
The Auralnauts are 100%  Absolutely Positively Without a Doubt Certified Midichlorified Gugu Mbantha-RAW!\nWhat's Christmas? Lol\nAlso, is that Baby Time playing in the credits?
3:00 Thumbs up to all the pervs who saw this little bit of humor. Apparently our boy Kylo likes some Suicide Girls action.
This shit is so fucking good holy fuck! CLASSIC!!! THUMBS UP!!
These vids never cease to get a giggle from me lol 😂
I'm so raw!!!
2:48 is the part you want to see.
This reaction is raw
This video was so RAW
I hope he still reacts to stuff unrelated to Star Wars after Star Wars is over.
It's baby time
I'm really disappointed that weenie doesn't seem to be in his helmet for most of the movie.
The Suicide Girls at the end....so raw!
That was so Awesome and funny.  I liked how he said this was in the future.  My favorite was when it first switch to Rey.
lol!!! i love how he shouts out Whaaat?!!! and that laugh
2:44 ''How about in the ground'' LMAO
Gordan Ramsey is super pissed at how raw this trailer is.
I need someone to show me my place...\n*points to the kitchen*
The only react videos that matter are from Kylo.
I'm glad you like it Kylo
It's baby timeeeeeeee
This sucks
*Raw<>War*
WHATS UP EVERYONE ITS YOUR BOI KYLO
RAW!!
Fresh.

2:04 what's Christmas?
“What’s Christmas?”

Cho kawaii .. *dies repeatedly*
Everything is RAW!!!

Doesn't Anna just seem so healthy and happy recently? 💙
Eduarados little laugh when Anna was going after him was so cute 😂xx
How beautiful is Anna guys??!! And hilarious too!!
Love watching u guys! It brings a smile to my face!💖 alessia is so adorable, emilia is so kind and clever ,Eduardo is so cute and happy, Anna is so gorgeous and Jonathon is so bubbly and sweet! I'll always watch your lovely videos! Xxxxx
As soon as he said #nevercopyanother I Started to copy someone
if you go to bing type in yotube and search at the nside there is a little picture of you guys the saconyjolys
Eduardo's laugh is the best !
Hahaha I love Anna’s bianca voice they are sooooo funny
When Johnathan was talking about those muffins all I could think about was that scene from mean girls; would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin? 😂
Love love love Anna doing that voice over for the dogs!! 😂😂
Alessia might be the happiest little human on earth 😂❤
Omg anna you kill me with the dog voices it's hilarious! Really looking forward to meeting you guys in Milton Keynes in a few weeks!
I love you guys so much! Such amazing parents ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a big inspiration Jonathan! Your story will help so many people. I love your family and have watched for over a year now 💗💗
Hahaha I love them their so Funny 😂 Jonathan is so brave also
I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
It's really cool that your teaching them Irish
That voice and clip though.... genius !!!!!
loving the photo in the background at the start, little squid.
So so proud of your bravery, Jonathan ❤❤❤
Anna is so funny, she had me dying in her Bianca voice
Jonathan you are so brave! Anyone who knows you is lucky to have you as a friend
Eduardo is THE sassiest little man and I am in love.
I love love love when Alessia flaps her arms and makes that joyful breathing noise! I just LOVE it and it makes me so happy. #precious
Anna, why don’t you just take an umbrella with you!!
You are such an amazing human Jonathon xxx
I want to see Eduardo take over the vlog for a day!
Anna needs to do a whole video just in the dogs voices. I love it !!
The fAct that you told people what  happened is incredibly brave, inspiring...and shows a LOT of strength...i hope it helps others who have sadly been in your situation...even if they don't feel so alone 💚💚 my heart breaks thinking of how many people have been victim of sexual assault 😢💚
I like how that, despite the fact that you probably had a rough day when you released that video, you remained positive and happy for your kids. I know how hard that is. I have severe anxiety and it’s sooooo hard to be happy for anyone or anything. I don’t have kids but as hard as it is for me to remain happy during anxious times as a single adult with no kids I can only imagine how hard it must be to remain strong in front of your kids when you’re feeling crummy. I’m so sorry about what you went through Jonathan. I’m so happy that you have Anna and the kids to remind you that you’re a great person and Dad and to keep you on your toes and help you get this off your mind.
Alessia seems like such a happy well behaved baby all the time ❤❤
Anna is literally the funniest woman in the world! Love her to bits! I aspire to that woman!!! 💕
Anna couldn't look more beautiful 😍😍
I'm so proud of you for sharing your story. It's so important to open a dialogue for men to discuss their stories too.
Jonathon you helped me with that video you put up as a survivor myself... I admire you so much for speaking up ❤️ I’m coming to see you guys at the baby event at olympia next weekend 😀💙
Hahaha that was the best promotion for innocent 😂 Anna's bianca voice is my fave thing ahhaha amazing!!!
I'm glad you told your mom. I am very sure that the video you posted about your terrible experience helped so many people. You are brave And supported by so many.
Omg lmao Anna's accent for Bianca was everything lol so funny!!!
This video proves that some viewers jump to conclusions way too quick and it proves that no, we viewers don't really know anything because there's so much going on behind the scenes so who are we to speculate. I'm saying this because I was scrolling through the comments of yesterday's video and I saw people being mad about him not telling his mom before putting out the video. So this is for all of you. In your face.
Anna doing the dogs voices is the best. Dying for an episode of the dogs voiced by Anna.
I love when Anna voices the dogs 😂😂
OMGosh, I love that exasperated little breathy laugh that Alessia does when she's excited. Its much too cute!! 😍😍\nAwwww, ballet with Daddy!! How fun!! 💚💜💛\nI love the ending, haha!! When you talk for them its hilarious!! The little Bianca knit was so cute too.
It could be the newer food you’re feeding the pups, that’s causing the staining on their faces.
Jonathan  we can all\nappreciate your courage! Your a wonderful example of strength and character. Your family respects and adores you as do hundreds of viewers. So thank-you for your bravery and bringing another truth to the pitiful silence of sexual assault!
Your story was very inspirational Jonathan love too everyone 😊
Love to the Saccone Joylys and all your subscribers!
Jonathan, you are very brave!! Your family is really lucky having you!!  😘
So proud of you Jonathan ❤️
The voice she did for the dog hahahaha she should do wee puppet shows it's so good hahaha
Jonathan you are an amazing man, husband, father and friend to all of us. You are a brave brave man because not any man would have the guts to tell the world something like this. We love and support you. You are amazing because you didnt let this awful experiemce take over your beautiful peronsality, your ability to love and be happy. You are one of the few most amazing husbands a girl could ever want so loving and thoughtful to your wife, kids and friendlist friends !! WE LOVE YOU JONATHAN !!
I'm sure your story will help some other people☺. Peace to you.👍
What a coincidence, I missed these videos because I was on a cruise as well.🛳
Suí síos 😂😂😭I love how u teach them some Irish
Wish was as brave like you 😑🤐
how is it that I'm in second year and Emillia and Eduardo have better irish than me ...... lol
Jonathan I work in an EYFS class and reading a lot at home DEFINITELY helps kids in their school progress! Emilia and Eduardo are both very smart xx
We are all here to support you Jonathan. You were very brave to post the video. Well done Jonathan

Guilty Eau de parfum by Bianca Neve
Well done for speaking out Johnathon, that can't have been easy to do. Anyone out there who sees this and has someone in their life making them do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell someone, a parent, a friend, a teacher, a sibling, a doctor, anyone and don't stop talking until someone helps you
I don’t even know what the dislikes are thinking!!! This is so brave of you Jonathan 🌎
I AM FROM GERMANY.PLEASE TALk SLOW.LOVE THIS FAMILY.KISSES
I was also sexually assaulted at the age of 6 I’m 13 now but I’m just wondering if I ever have kids wether I would tell them, so are you ever going to tell them?
Wow Anna...you look that this is such a struggle to get you child.  Whine...Whine...Whine...oh  my head hurts...  When are you going to be a nice person and parent?

lol chloe did you just wing this tutorial? especially coz you kept rubbing things off? even if you did thats amazing coz i wouldve needed multiple practices before putting it on camera. also ,why would your video be demonitized?
You're so great. Loved the vid
hahahah i particularly love the gratuitous cussing at the beginning. such fucking bullshit that vids now get demonetized for swearing. just one of many ways for them to ultimately control content.
Love this makeup and I look forward to all your videos😍
love this look! so original and you're videos always make me laugh!
You are the best Chloe!
love thiss look, and you more!
Why goodbye to monetisation when using fake blood?
Adore this! Love that you went for a full gore look but still managed the glam as well 😅 also noticed that you sound the same as you did in your early videos (maybe you were shyer then) probs because you could hardly move your mouth 😅💕
This is great and from what I have seen, original. I thoroughly enjoy your videos.
I laugh so much with your comments!!! You rock!! Xoxoxo
You are great! And always so fun!😘
you are the best 🙌🙌
This is legitimately the scariest Halloween tutorial I've come across so far! 😐😄 Chloe can you pretty please bless us with a 3 looks 1 palette tutorial with your new palette? ❤️❤️ K thanks love you bye xx
your videos are like the only reason i go on youtube!<3
You always have the most creative tutorials!
Honestly best intro I've seen in a while pahhahaha
we love you MP
Without Eriksen Tottenham are nothing trust me. Any striker who plays week in week out will score plenty of goals for that team, maybe not as much as Kane but Eriksen just runs the game.
One can understand why, the players like him.. He is a very normal and clever guy on football..
Keep ArseAnal under keep Wenkar IN!
I love u please get more tottenham vids out!
Why is this on trending
I loved Logan and Children of Men is one of the best films ever made, so I had a lot of fun putting this one together! *What films would you like to see me tackle in the future?*\nAlso, if you happen to be looking for stock footage for a project and want to help support LFTS, check out the 7 day free trial of Videoblocks: http://bit.ly/LFTSVideoblocksTrial
Logan is basically the X-Men version of The Last of Us (award-winning video game). Not that the endings are nearly alike ;) so don't think you know it if you choose to get into it, folks. LoA's ending was better, but I, someone who tends not to like superhero movies, loved loved *loved* Logan.
If the lie is that bad things happen to people Logan loves, he is spot on it actually. Charles dies because of this whole thing and x-23 while safe for now lost the one father figure she could ever have and is going to die on the same fate as him because adamantium.
What is the last song of the video before you talk about videoblocks by story blocks?\n\nBtw, your videos are awesome!
On the surface Logan and Children of Men may not seem that similar. I thought it was pretty blatantly obvious. Granted most people compared it to The Last of Us.
This was brilliant! Thank you so much! Indie film maker and actor here.
Simply, beautiful.  These 2 films epitomize the craft of story telling...and elevate it. Brutal, poetic, universal.
This is fantastic work Michael. Thanks for making us smarter about film!
I know this might sound overrated. But, can you do Godfather Trilogy?
Please do one on 2001: Space Odyssey cinematography or ambiguity, or even effects.
I knew I would love this video
Two great movies. And here's why.
Would love to see a video on you tackling any component of any one of paul thomas andersons films
I feel like The Last of Us can also be compared to these two movies in the same way
I didn't like Logan.  All the characters felt dull
I enjoy your video as much as the movies! Thank you for your time and effort.
Awesome video man! They're always better than the last.\nCan I suggest something about the build up on War of the Worlds (2005)? :0
Hey Michael loved the video I'm very new to your videos and since I go to an acting school your channel helps. I was wondering could you try to tackle ether Foxcatcher or Fury? Cause I know there's incredible things in both films.
Very similar to The Last of Us, the three are amazing stories
Children Of Men is my favourite film of all time along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, would love if you did one on them? Or anything by Charlie Kaufman, the man is a genius! Love your work!
I'm a simple man. I see Children of Men... I click.
I’d love to see you tackle something with minimal dialogue like Shame or Hunger
I never noticed the similarities between these two movies before. Another great video as always.
Do a video of the new Netflix series Mindhunter, pleeeeeeeease
Logan immediately became one of my favorite comicbook movies after seeing it in theaters (and with time, will probably only get better).  Children of Men is one of my top 5 favorite movies to date.  Alfonso Cuaron is a brilliant director.  The cinematography is superb, and all of the actors really flesh out their roles.  I've watched it numerous times, and my enjoyment only increases with each viewing.
so glad i found your channel
Hey Michael Great content as always\nI want to ask you something\n\nI'm having a plan of making a film essay, and i want to ask you what method do you use everytime you analyze a screenplay ? Did you watch the film as you studying the script ? Or you just read it first and then watch the film ? Because i found it really hard for me watching a film and read a script at the same time\n\nThank You !
I absolutely love both of these films. Thank you for the lesson here: as a writer and as a movie lover it makes complete sense.
amazing video as usual, for your future videos, I'd love to see your analysis on The Room by tommy wiseau. i'm sure you love that movie lol
Hey! that was a pretty analysis. But I do have a small disagreement: Logan's lie. At the beginning of the video I thought it might be a bigger disagreement, but you do address part of it when you talk about the initial attitudes both protagonists have about the future. The thing is: I'm not sure Logan's lie is some aversion towards family in general.... I mean he does go to great lengths in order to take care of Xavier in his very complicated decrepitude. I'd probably say that Logan's lie has to do with where he thinks his family exists and what he should be trying to save. His lie is that his family ties can only exist in the past and that the debt he needs to repay to professor X can be repaid by taking care of him. But the truth is that his debt must be payed forward, that his obligations are towards the future, not the past.
Your analysis is amazing as usual. Also, I couldn't agree more on how ridiculously underrated Children of Men is. Truly, a masterpiece!
man Logan really took me by surprise. I knew it was going to be good but it was amazing
24 ways Children of Men and Logan are the same movie.
As Charlie Kaufman says in Synecdoche, New York The end is built into the beginning.
My heart leaped out of my chest when I saw this in my notifs! AAAAAA!! I love both films- Logan is the best X-Men film out there, and Children of Men holds a special place in my heart since it's one of my favorite films ever! And I agree with what you said about it- that it's one of the best films ever made!! GAAAAHHHH--\n\nThat aside, I really love watching your vids 'cause they teach me a lot about films, story telling, character analysis, and etc. Thank you so much for them, and I hope you keep doing your thing! <3
Now I must watch Children of Men.
I was waiting for someone else to make this comparison!  So glad you did!
I've just rewatched The Breakfast Club - pleaseeeeee consider doing an episode on that film.  I'd love to hear your take.
Amazing. You make my comparison film reviews look amateur. Great video man.
Whether or not you do a video essay on it up to you, but if I may recommend a film to you with a lot of themes and ideas to unpack, you should check out The United States of Leland starring Ryan Gosling, Don Cheadle, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Malone, and Chris Kline. Very heavy film.
Hi Michael, I love your video essays. I've been learning a lot. I'm writing a story sort of like wonder boys (by Chabon) and Sideways. And although i kind of see the comparison, i would very much like to see your take on it. thanks a lot!
I love your work. Seriously. I'm a aspiring writer/screenwriter and your essays have helped me a lot trough the process. Here's a suggestion: analyze Chinatown. Why is it so important? Why is it so baddass screenwriting? Thanks again and keep up the good work, man.
Now I want to view both films back to back. Fantastic work.
One of the best analyzing videos I've seen. Great analysis on my favorite movie of all time. Keep up the awesome work.
One could say Han Solo could fall into this category
One of the two favorites movies of all time
i really loved both of these films and I was blown away by this great comparison and analysis - great work!  very inspiring!
There are two types of people whose choices/actions defines them as true heroes: Those who endure all the pain, suffering, and sorrows of the world, so no innocents would ever have to feel them. And those who no matter their desires to protect the innocents and to see justice is served, by the book and nothing but the book, are hated, look down upon, and whose names are ridiculed by same innocent people they fight to protect. They continue to protect them nonetheless, without any regrets. :D
Another amazing video.  Thanks for the incredible content, it's serving as much needed inspiration as I battle through my screenplay.
Best video I have ever seen
I guess you can add The Last of Us to this as well and I love all of them. I guess I'm just a sucker for this type of story.
This video is beautiful. Thank you
Great vídeo !! I wound love to see you talking about The handmaids tale 😃
This is like a video essay. Thesis and supporting evidence.
The Beginning is the End is the Beginning - Smashing Pumpkins
Great video, can you do The Prestige?
Verrrrry well done sir! Keep up the good work!
I will buy those books!
You have such fantastic content. I watch your videos multiple times bc they really get my creativity going. Thank you so much for the work you do!
When you brought up the protagonist believing in a lie that reflects the problems with society, my immediate thought was Bladerunner 2049. What a beautiful character arc for K
I didn’t even have the language to articulate it at the time, but I knew Children of Men was the most powerful (and probably best) movie I had ever seen the first time I watched it.
Great topic.  I'd believe this idea more if you started the explanation with the beginning of the stories instead of the end.  Better proof to just see how it is before the persuasive links are made for the learners.
This video is great. I’m definitely subscribing and definitely binge watching more of your videos
Another piece of media very similar to this is the Last of Us. Identical narrative composition.
Please do an analysis on La La Land! Though I personally think that the screenplay is mediocre, the execution is spotless, and I would LOVE an analysis on the this aspect.
I've never thought about this but soon as I read title of this video I (internally) screamed: Of course!
Wow, The Last of Us follows this formula point for point as well.\nI was joking when seeing the Logan trailer that it would be the Last of Us movie we didn't get but I hadn't realized how similar the two stories actually are until watching this video.
I'd never realized it, but the Matrix fits this structure to a T as well.
It is hard to believe how young your channel is. You went so far, so fast.
I appreciate your work so much. just amezing work.\nmuch love from Denmark
The last of Us is heavily inspired by Children of Men and Logan is basically The Last of Us  but with mutants.
One of your best essays yet, Michael! I love both movies, and you've communicated why they are so effective so eloquently. Really good job
The Last of Us is similar, I think
Whatever you do, whatever you make, I always love all your videos :)
Really wish this was longer..I love these videos so much
how about... THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, please? You've need tackled on a comedy, besides GHOSTBUSTERS and American Beauty, although the latter film isn't exactly a comedy...
Love this channel! I used your advice from the Star Wars LFTS to make the protagonist of my short film more active! Thanks for making my writing better.
Never seen Children of Men but it kinda reminds me of V for Vendetta. Why are the British so convinced they will be the last country standing(and why do they need to turn Fascist to do so)
Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't figure out why tho. DO IT PLEASE :-D!
Fuck man, I love this episode
We really need an analysis on Acts 2 and 3 as well.
I wonder if the academy has the guts to give Jackman a best actor Nom for Logan?
Okay, I would pay you to do a full analysis like this of your favorite movie. These videos are insane.
I love how, even though I'm a writer and not a director, most of the lessons you cover are applicable to my work. Big thanks as always.
This was fantastic!! Man...thank you for making these.
You are great at this. Thanks you for this. I love your essays. And also, your voice is soothing.
(sorry about my english) I've never watched CHILDREN OF MEN, so I've watched only for watch this video. Amazing movie and analysis. Thank you.
It's almost been a year since I started the 3rd draft of my novel for NaNoWriMo. I finished it in the summer time and have been taking a break from it to build my business, and I am often contemplating revising it soon.\n\nTHIS video essay has inspired me to come up with way better revision ideas than I had thought of the past year. Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel. It truly helps a lot!
Show me more.
Bravo.
That was aweomse!
Amazing job! Keep it!
Very informative video. Thanks.
fascinating as always!!
Excellent video.
fantastic stuff
review rudderless
I'm sure you've been asked this before, but is there a resource list of all the books you reference in your videos? Would love to add it to my reading list.
I love your videos. Do you keep a public list of the books you mention? I would love to read them.
To be honest this kind of ruined Logan for me. Now I cant help but see it as a discount Children of men.
Woah am I the only one who just noticed that the “girl” laying on his lap is actually him? 😂😂
I guess we gon ignore the fact he sound like lil Wayne with that auto tune
I got so hyped when this popped up in my recommended
This is the only artist my high student sister and I share a love for.
ok bjt is no one really gonna talk about the fact that the song is describing meticulously his producer?

Straight up has a naked girl on lap
3:10 and 3:53 are the best parts
0:11 WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT
The first part in the video is disturbing
Song at the end🔥🔥
This vid is freaky, but in a good way
very good song. and very catchy. banger. good job amine, make sure to always keep your beats upbeat like this and caroline. because red mercedes was a little bit not like you.
He’s like the Matt Healy of rap and I love it so much
I rarely ever use this but 🔥
That bathroom scene is so tyler
what song is playing at 3:11
pretty sure he was high in the making of this video.
Best thing he's released since Caroline he's back on track esketit
I need a spice girl 🎶
whats the song at the end???????
All I really want is spice girl😇😇
So did anyone else notice amine's wingspan?
Song at the end was incredible
said she on a diet so she only eat bannas there's the bannas again lol
Who’s that hottie laying on the couch👀🔥
When theres a ripoff fast and furious and ur on low budget\n0:16
If he wasn't singing, this beat would be so nice. I really don't want to hear about how all you want is a girl that knows as soon as you get home from work it's sex time. I don't want to hear how annoying he is. All his beats are really nice, but the lyrics are so unrelatable. Some people don't like having bad words and sex blasted in their ears while listening to stuff. Aka the majority of people. Half the kids that listen to this don't even understand wtf he's saying. It's gross.
i left the video at 0:06
The song at the end tho
He is so fucking weird and creative. I love him!!!
LOOK WHO'S BACK BOIS

he has that surprised face expression

Why is there no support from fans of Man City ?, Why do not they sing? Why a quiet stadium? It's like a friendly match.
No Aguero, No Problem!
Wow, I did not expect this to be his voice, it's a lot more feminine than you would expect
Turn on subtitles and watch the end of the video...

Lisa I love your new ring!
She is the most beautiful woman in the world!
Amazing ! Claudia looks pretty she seems so down to earth , and her skin is so flawless.
Gorgeous, Lisa!! 😍\nHave you ever thought about doing a video on men’s makeup?
So happy you're uploading new videos!!!😁💄💜
Loving your new rings in your ‘ring family’ Lisa! Thank you for continuing to share your expertise and soothing voice to the world. It takes a lot of effort and time to make these videos and we ALL appreciate that!! Much love from Australia. 👍❤️🇦🇺
is her makeup line available in the US?
Lisa, please do a make up tutorial with christy turlington!
She lives in a palace
Amazing video as per usual ! Can someone tell me where does Lisa get her rings from? Every time i watch her videos I can't help but stare at her jewelry 😍
i think i've never seen claudia schiffer without black eyes make up and from such a video angle!
That is the way you should use the shape tape concealer!
Can you please do Edie Sedgwick make-up ? I think it really stands out from the classic 60s make-up and many would appreciate it :) Love your art!
It's good to know she's human like the rest of us going to bed with her makeup on .
I don't know why it makes me so happy that Claudia didn't do major work (maybe no work at all?) on her face! It's so refreshing to see real, thin, unaltered gorgeous lips! ♥
Lisa, I love it when you have these icons pop by your studio and share them with us.  Thank you so much for this gorgeous makeup, and a peek into Claudia's life.
Don´t get me wrong, pleeease. I just took a look on Claudia´s make up line. And I really had the hope, that she, as a german will pay attention to the ingredients (I mean, if I were her, I would have). But just like the Hunington-Whiteley products, they all look amazing, still are fully packed with mineral oils and very questionable ingredients. WHEN- I ask comes somebody who takes care????
I love the lipstick, what brand ? Which colour ??
Lisa! Can you please give a María Félix makeup tutorial! She was one of Mexico’s most beautiful women. With very characteristic makeup.
Pls pls pls pls pls a tutorial with Doutzen Kroes :p one of the most flawless Beauties ever
when other youtubers are collabing between them and Lisa is collabing with top models from the 90's you know the difference in caliber.
can you please do make up on an asian person without a crease?
Claudia always was and still is LOVELY!!! :)
I will say that I'm not the biggest fan of the quick fire questions -- I love the natural process of getting to know the person through Lisa's conversations with them while she's doing the makeup. Having the quick fire questions makes it seem more jarring and less integrated with the video.
Beautiful job on the Legendary Claudia! Anything Bardot is fantastic
Lisa you make the rest of the 'beauty gurus' looking and sounding incredibly sad and cheap. Video like this one are an example of what a real professional should be. Thank you so much. And thank you for bringing a beauty icon such as Claudia.
I love Lisa's laugh at the end! So adorable! Fantastic work as always <3
Finally, a makeup look done on a true hooded eye- nicely executed. Her crinkly laugh lines are just lovely!
ANY SUPERMODEL that works purposes with you is a great person as well! NOW, if only Christy, Naomi, Kate H. and Linda could be next!!! Love these beautiful women!
So wonderful! I love the whole interaction, just so genuine and sweet!
Fabulous tutorial 😍 I cannot use eyelash curlers ... my eyelashes are so long and naturally curly and my eyes are hooded .. I actually try and straighten them out a bit with the mascara wand lol.
What a fantastic tutorial. I love Lisa. She's a true artist and leagues above the other self-centered 20-somethings flooding YouTube. Genuine class and style! And Claudia is so timeless. <3
That Golden Circle makeup bot was quite amazing!
Lisa you and me common thing is rings love
Her skin is everything
Fabulous video Lisa, I loved seeing Claudia, she is amazingly beautiful and natural (meaning no botox or plumped lips). Great idea to show us how you did her make up!!! Wonderful!!! Thank you !!! Cristina M.
Lisa, this was so much fun, with a great match of look & model. And I do want that lipliner color, I've been loving a light nude lip lately.
Hello Lisa Eldridge ..I would love to do the smokey effect underlining the lower eyes with liner or eye makeup..but I suffer from puffy eyes/ slight bulge quite near to the waterline...so how do I tackle this issue with make up...
Lisa looking gangsta with all those rings 😄. Love this makeup look. It isn’t easy working on mature eyes but I think the trick is not to overthink it. This smokey eye still works 👍🏾
Gorgeous!!  Both of u!!  Thank you for sharing this moment in time with us!!
Great video, thank you so much for sharing this! You both are gorgeous & talented. It's wonderful to see two extremely successful women supporting each others work. LOVE!! One minor point, pizza cutter?!? How 'bout modified ball-point pen instead? <
She does have lines, but she wears them well and she's still gorgeous.
What a lovely guest and a wonderful surprise!  A favorite of mine since the 80's!  Beautiful...
LOL I hit like before even watching!
Please please do rose makeup look from titanic... You seem to know exactly what celebrities use for their roles and real life.. I wana know what Kate used in makeup as rose and what hair colour was used and hair cut... Please do that video!!!!
I'm pretty decent with makeup but if I tried that dark of a smoky eye omg I would be a mess! Seriously talented! Goals dramatic but still minimal
2 wonderful women sharing a wonderful moment with us! Thank you ladies you’re both so inspirational.
Claudia had a few Chelsea Handler angles for me in this...
So beautiful! Loved the quick questions
She´s an archangel.
Make up look with Liu Wen, please! There are not so many make up tutorials with asian beauties. It'll be amazing!
Love how Claudia allows her face to have frown lines and crows feet, instead of botoxing everything away like what happens in Hollywood. Ageless beauty!
I have been waiting my entire life for this.Thank you thank you thank you.I love you Claudia
I didn't think Claudia would be like this, I have never really seen her talk much before. She seems really smart, down to earth and just a cool chick to hang out with. Great tutorial.
I love the 60s looks! Claudia has the most fantastic skin...stunning!
Such a cute video!
Brigitte Bardot is a beautiful woman but let's not forget she's also a keen racist.
She still looks like an angel. That skin!!
Yep! As I suspected, Lisa's rings reproduce
Hi Lisa, I really enjoyed this with Claudia, I’m a massive fan. I also made a video the other day on Claudia too. It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.
just look at this beautiful creature =) no botox and fillers... just plain gorgeous in and out ..   the most beautiful woman in the world!
Anyone know where Lisa’s rings are from?
Claudia looks so sweet such a kind person
Yes, what a treat! My fave model of all time with the best makeup artist ever!
She is the most beautyful creature in the world. I adore claudia🌹❤️. Thankeyou, Lisa
It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)
I saw one of the OG Supermodels, I clicked
OMG how do you get one of the biggest supermodels of all time in your video?
Black eyelashes and blond hair... isn't it weird?
Funny intro! Really loved the energy between you two Lisa. I did notice the new ring additons. They are so beautiful. Always wondering where you find those dashing rings.
I gave away a fragrance by Agent Provocateur to a free box.  ehehehehehehe
What a goddess she is
I am not familiar with Claudia Schiffer but you can see from the bone structure of her face that she is beautiful, with or without makeup. She looks like a doll, big eyes, slim nose and shapely mouth. Not sure if she had plastic surgery, but if she was born like that, she was born to be a supermodel. And she seems so nice and kind, which is a rare in these day and age with supermodels.
Do you have a new ring or two?
I really love how she is ageing gracefully.
I love all the great 90s supermodels....! wow! despite the fact that they´re older now, they are still so stunning! Bravo, Claudia and Lisa!
Of course it's gorgeous!  So sad that Claudia's makeup is not available in the US :-(
Thank you for sharing the video, Lisa! I love how Claudia is so natural & classy and looking after herself after 30 years in fashion. She is comfortable & confident in herself that she doesn't mind showing us her lines, which we all have!!! Great to see her amazing self after being her fan for 25 years!!! Love Claudia!!!! XOXO
she aged wonderful
toujours si délicat !!!
That intro, sooooo funny !!!!
Nooo waaaayyy claudia schiffer!!! Amaazing!!!

Thoroughly enjoyable, Lisa!

Wow does Claudia  ever age???
Claudia looks unbelievable
<3
Wow, incredible!!!
Lisa, I doubt you’ll see this comment but on behalf of all of your subscribers, we LOVE you! I just cannot get enough of your videos. I swear I watch each of your videos at least 3 times! 💜 I love that the looks you showcase are elegant but simple; simple meaning the amount of products you use and application method. You aren’t afraid to use your fingers, and you don’t feel the need to slather on a ridiculous amount of foundation & concealer. You highlight the natural beauty within, including any “imperfection”, which makes the client look even more gorgeous & authentic.  It is so refreshing to see your content!  I realize that you are a very busy professional make up artist but please continue uploading your amazing content when your schedule allows! ❤️ Jaimee in the US

WARNING! Carry on reading! Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning!\nOnce there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the More-government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up aSPECIALROOM to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died.\nNow every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.\nNow send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. apparently, if u copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have the best day of ur life tomorrow. u will either get kissed or asked out, if u break this chain u will see a little dead girl in your room tonight. in 53 mins someone will say i love you or imS
Anybody just watch their battery life slowly drain and wait till the last few minutes of life to find the charger. But you can't find it and just wait for the end to come.\nI'm at 10 percent, and the end is near. R.I.P

Whenever Kurzgesagt and I get together the topic of life extension comes up.  A lot.  Go watch his part 2 video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJsr4IwCm4
If death is concerned, humans will overflow the earth, and make people wish death us back
You know when you hear a word for the first time, and then the next day you hear it. Or when you watch a film for the first time, and then someone says have you ever seen (the film you watched). I don’t know but I just don’t want to watch this
Complete garbage video.... death does not age you moron, what death does is set you free from your inevitable ripe age in wich all you do is suffer. You biologically  can live for ever but the reasone you ripe to a soon rot I guess? Is because  of many factors  the sun gamma rays,carbon dioxide  and many  many many more factors  that ware your body  down even the acids in your stomach  ware your to Mach tissue  down. What I'm trying to day is that living for ever is not a good thing it's terrible unless you are alive forever young. So death is just a favor to not suffer once you can no longer move\nEdit - it's 3 am excuse  my grammer  to lazy to fix
It all would be nice and sound, if we wouldn't experience time logarithmically. If we'd manage to live from say, the age of 81 on to 243, we'd be experiencing as much of subjective time, as we did living from the age of 9 to 27. As you said, we are constantly at the end of our time, looking backward to already unreachable memories. If we would live forever in real time, we would be experiencing death, that is, our last moment, forever, denying it from ourselves – forever.
Bro stop dreaming, you are doomed to die like everyone. I can't stand those people who are so scared of death that they think that somehow we're gonna find a remedy. Even if you find a way to be immortal EVERYTHING in the universe is decaying, It's the law of entropy.
When you closely observe the world, you see that everything is cycle, the seasons, life, happiness, everthing has a start and an end, and it's start over again. Thinking you could avoid death is just not understanding death. Everything is about transformation, the cycle won't stop. Flow with it and accept it. Death is part of the cycle
What about the bad side of eternal life? Like... Dictators that rule forever.
Sword and shield won’t defend against a car going at 50 mph
I disagree with your statement about happiness and how death doesn't give life meaning. Although the people who try to make these statements come true with their own individual actions are monsters, these statements are naturally true.
Once they figure out how to upload the human brain onto a hard drive of sorts (they are working on this)human will be able to live forever.
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee \nMighty and dreadful, for thou art not so; \nFor those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow \nDie not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me. \nFrom rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be, \nMuch pleasure; then from thee much more must flow, \nAnd soonest our best men with thee do go, \nRest of their bones, and soul's delivery. \nThou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men, \nAnd dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell, \nAnd poppy or charms can make us sleep as well \nAnd better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then? \nOne short sleep past, we wake eternally \nAnd death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.\n- Donne John, Holy Sonnet X
reading this comment section is just... i'm convinced, living for any amount of time among these people is definitely not worth it.
Oh come on. I can get behind doing away with old age, I can't get behind immortality. For one, world is overcrowded as it is, and we do have limited resources. So if we invent the immortality pill now and distribute it to everyone somewhat freely, life will become a nightmare a couple centuries later. Mainly because society won't be able to catch up. And because the planet could support only so much of humanity before everything goes sour. And don't let me start on the possibility that we don't distribute the immortality pill somewhat freely, that would also lead to a pretty grim outlook.
paying for death insurance is da pattern of early death.........
They say that it may be possible to tranfer the brain of a dying person into another body and prevent death in the future.
I think we should. imagine all the wisdom people get over time but never get enough time to share. Most of the profound people we have learnt from are not much older than ourselves but imagine if we could have the wisdom of someone who has lived a 100 years, 200 even. Someone who has actually seen the changes. I believe, it would be great.
I want Humanity to conquer aging itself. Who wouldn't want to not age and live indefinitely? We'd be free, free to pursue our hopes and dreams without worrying about the limited time we have. We'd only go out on our terms. Why let the reaper dictate when we have to go out?\n\n I think mankind would mature faster as a species as too often we repeat the mistakes of the past because we forget them with every passing generation.
Appreciate the hard-sell, but no thanks, it's better to have an escape route back to the father - back to paradise, than it is to suffer as a slave under the tyranny of a ruthlessly plutocratic, corporate dictatorship, forever, with no real hope of ever being free from misery & suffering in your life!!\n\nI'm human, i want to stay human, i don't want to become a machine, so you can take yer dodgy nanotechnology and stick it up yer own ass.......send this ideological monstrosity back whence it came, so to speak!\n\nWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead.\nThen he placed his right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.\n I am the Living One; I was dead, and now look, I am alive for ever and ever! \nAnd I hold the keys of death and Hades. - Rev 1 : 17-18
I've been a longtime fan of yours, but I am unsubbing from you today. The reason being is your delivery of this topic. I disagree with your viewpoint. However, I don't think life has meaning BECAUSE of death. I think life has meaning because of a lot of other things unrelated to death. You deliver this topic with an us v. them mentality. Like, I'm wrong and regressive because I'm okay with death and not on board with the idea of immortality. Like, I'm some kind of monster because I don't view death as a disease, as you do. Your closing line is especially what bothers me. Implying that the difference of a day makes me responsible for the death of others, simply because I don't agree with mortal people being immortal? Maybe I'm wrong by these implications, but those are the vibes I'm getting from this video, and that is why I sign off of your channel today. I hope nothing but the best for you, but I cannot support a channel with a delivery like that.
When do you want to die? Right now
death is a release. We could end aging, but we cannot put an end to immorality. a lifetime as a slave, or being tortured or any number of evil thing happening for eternity does not sound like anything i want a part of. Imagine if hitler had lived forever, for ever experimenting in horrific and grotesque ways. Imagine the madness in the minds where death means nothing, the psychosis of men who were driven insane from time. It would be a literal dante's inferno on earth. It would not be a good place. Death maybe the end of life, but it is also the end of evil and suffering.
As people don’t want to change death is a way for bad old ideas to fade out and humanity to progress.
I think about death almost constantly.\nI'm sure there's developments in science that can help people but I doubt they will go so far as to eliminate death.\nTo my mind people who can't accept the reality of their own death are more easily manipulated.\nEnjoy today because you are not special, you are not important and you will be forgotten.
Out of context I'd assume you were gonna commit suicide CGP.
Ehh, can't agree with everything here. Suffering undoubtedly makes pleasure more pleasurable. Of course, you shouldn't chase suffering in order to attain better pleasure, but it often works out that way.
I'll take the abyss please
I suspect dislikes are from religious people. Sad pathetic beings
Actually bad things do give good things meaning\nWithout bad there is no good
Viva la Trump! \n\nMay his reign go on FOREVER!!!!!! \n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone tweet this video at him right now. If anyone can afford to push the science through to live forever, he can  ☺
I want to die
IT'S OK I WATCH IT  CAN YOU STOP NOW ?!??
The deaths I witnessed all of my grandparents go through due to disease and the wearing out of their bodies tell me that I shouldn’t look forward to getting old.  It’s kind of terrifying actually.  I look forward to making it to that age. Not the physical state I’ll be in when I get there. Knowing my luck, millennials will be the last generation to not see a benefit from this sort of technological advancement, or we’ll see some benefit; but not enough to avoid the abyss.
2:45 Immortal generation? There's no such thing. I mean, you're talking about aging. More strictly, aging-related illnesses. As Aubrey de Grey well pointed out, even if we beat aging people will die of traumatic injuries and all sort of non-aging related diseases (remember only 70% of all deaths in the world is caused by aging-related illness.)
Would be nice if this video covered the logistics of how the earth has limited space and drastically less deaths means that we cannot support the current rate of births etc
Interesting argument, but there's one little problem with it: Death and age are - in fact - inevitable, and what's more, we can prove it. Our universe is going to become uninhabitable in 30 billion years or so and will eventually run out of energy due to entropy. And this is perhaps the simplest argument that demonstrates that nothing lasts forever. It may sound nice and poetic to say that age is a disease that should be eradicated but it is inevitable. Age is simply a process governed by the physical laws of the universe that state that nothing is free and nothing lasts forever. Even if we succeed in prolonging our youth and live longer and longer lives, we will still break down and wither and age and eventually die, assuming of course we escape mortal injury from both our own hands and each other. And even if we can get through all that, we are STILL going to meet our end because with everyone living longer and dying less, our population will further explode. We are overpopulated as it is. Our numbers increase by the milliions each year and we are using more and more resources and eventually, they will run out. We're already responsible for the beginning of the next mass extinction our planet has seen, and if we don't take steps to reduce our imprint, we may end being responsible for our own demise. \n\nThere's another flaw in your argument, concerning the idea that humans have 'romanticized' death to where we seem like we might almost accept and embrace it. News flash: religion is still a thing that exists, something that demonstrates without a doubt that humans still fear death and try to do anything and everything to escape it's embrace. A VAST majority of the world's population believes in life after death, that death is not an end but merely a transition into another life that will last forever. Most people are willing to believe in anything that comforts and protects them from the knowledge that they will eventually die, and what's more, they're willing to ensure they're children believe the same things to protects themselves from any scrutiny they might face from a child's innocent questions. People have romanticized death, yes, but most of them probably didn't do it in the manner that you suggest.\n\nI'm all for minimizing pain and suffering and increasing happiness and well-being, but I recognize that at a certain point, the returns begin to dimmish. You are correct in calling anyone who promotes pain and suffering to help one appreciate the good and the health one has (or for any other reason for that matter) a monster. But to suggest that it's possible to end all suffering is absurd. And it is so for the simple reason that we as a species like to differentiate. We compare and contrast just about every aspect of our lives, our environment, and our fellow primates. Good without bad just is. There's no way to tell one without the other because it is a result of how our minds work. There are certain things we will tend to like and there are certain things that we will tend to not; that is our reality. Everyone is going to enjoy something in their lives, and they are also going to find things that they will not. What helps us appreciate the good things in our lives isn't unnecessary pain but the memory of the pain and suffering that does come to us. It something for us to compare to and it helps us realize and appreciate the good things we do have. Death and age aren't good or bad, they just are.\n\nI don't want to die, and I'm not certain I will ever want to die. I fear dying, I fear ceasing to exist and missing out on the future of my family, my friends and the overall future of our race. But I do not fear death, because at that point I won't care because my brain won't be functioning to experience death. I see no reason to view death as good or bad, it just is. But just as romanticizing death is madness, fancying oneself as capable of being immortal is just as insane, because eventually swords and shields wear out too.
If immortality can be done it needs little support. At the very least the scientist will want it for themselves and if they achieved it would be eternal fame and fortune. It would take a moron beyond measure to not leap on such an opportunity. I don't think it will happen, people are still waiting on jet packs and hover cars. Big promises that will become past ignorance/hopeful optimism.
There's nothing more horrible I could imagine than being immortal.\nThe mere thought of life *never* ending scares the hell out of me.\n\nAging I could do without though.
What about reapers for stars, galaxies, universe?
We could cure death but that may be baaad
I love these collaborations
You're saying there's a chance Donald Trump could live forever?
151,200 died in the making of this series
Fuck. I should not have watched this before bed
Where are you getting this crap about brains being preprogrammed to accept death?  Stop hanging out with stupid people.
But over crowding, not enough food for everyone, disease spreading through everyone. Life would be horrible. Would you be allowed to have kids or not? So many more problems rise up.
Is this a poem?
Grey reading this script out loud, over and over, while thunder sounds play in the background, and a very scared motivated business man talks to China nextdoor.
A lot of people are saying ''it'll cost billions and be hoarded by the rich and I don't see how the manufacturer's costs will actually be that high. Its just that they'll Charge as much as they can for it, A drug that adds +100 years to your life will cost 99 years of average wages.
Wait for it... i can sense  religious people comments  lol
My mum died yesterday and this video was surprisingly eye opening, death is inevitable. You've got to remember the good stuff, although it doesn't make it any easier it still gives me the proof that I couldn't do anything about if. I love you mum.
This is retarded enjoy what time you've got in whatever star you are in!!
Lets get a rip in the chat
This video attacks reductive depictions of a very narrow opinion apparently in support of death and suffering. I've never met someone with such a view, but when you extend the basic physical truths of entropy to the matter that enables human life then there becomes an inevitable *even if distant* endpoint. I suggest we not dismiss points of view that try to acknowledge and deal with that.
I want to live forever
Anyone else think there was a smudge on their phone?
If the Reaper is dead who killed the Reaper. Dun dun dun!!!
That Crash Course reference thou gj
This video is a perfect response to your own argument.  Your channel's been around for a while and it's successful enough that there's no threat to its continued existence, so instead of thoughtful commentary we get low-effort promotional material like this.  Rather than the well-cited science of You are Two or the philosophical rabbit hole of The Trouble with Transporters, we get a video of you shouting NO IT ISN'T for four minutes.  The channel has outlived its purpose, and now it exists merely to exist.
Don't mind fuck me
Well immortality or a super long life span are things I wish for. But I doubt anyone will share their miracle drug for free or on realistic bases.
Well no because death does give life meaning. If you thought life would be endless then you wouldn't care or value it.
Wait wait wait, you're talking about death like it's a disease, something with a singular starting point like cholera. But death is an outcome. You can't focus on preventing death, unless you focus on preventing everything that can kill you. \n\nIf you're talking about dying of old age then you're talking about kidney failure, heart disease, blood clots, Alzheimer's, and a litany of many many other factors that play into wearing down the human body. But then you're still prone to accidents, or other ways of coming into harm. \n\nAlso, what do we know about the storage limits of the human brain? Say you solved all the medical sides to the equation, is there no point in which the brain will stop holding information? As we get older our memories fade, would this endless life fix that problem too?
But death is literally necessary for life to continue! Everything we eat requires sometimes to die in order to give us nourishment. Our outer layer of skin is made up entirely of dead cells, and the constant rotation of cells is enormously important to the functioning of the epidermal organ system. Cancer is a disease that is literally due to cells not dying like they are supposed to. Death is absolutely necessary to life, and I'm sorry but when you factor in how much humans have fucked up the planet, on top of overpopulation creating horrifying quality of life issues, plus the impending threat of automation eliminating a slew of jobs and leaving most of the world's workers obsolete with no means of making an income, I really can't see any reason why humans not dying would be even remotely close to a good idea.
Death could be necessary, but you need to die to find out.
Sucks we can't just work together for common goals right?  People want to be lead, some asshole always wants power, the cycle continues.
Atoms decay. Even if now we stop aging, we will die in the end, because matter decays. Only thing we can do is live... hundred years more? Thousand years more? Million years more? \n\nBut indefinitely? Not as long as the matter decays. Atom decay is there.
This man is scared, he is very truly scared. And there’s nothing wrong with that, to face death is to face true nothingness. And that’s scary. How he deals with his fear is ultimately up to him; but he’s not a new age Nietzsche. He’s not destroying some sort of old belief system and creating something new and radical. But that’s what everyone said about Nietzsche too and hey see how famous he is. So in a century or two maybe, just maybe, this guy will turn out to be right. But as for me, in a century, I’m planning on already taking my eternal nap
I disagree, accepting death and accepting that there is nothing after this life is a necessary part of life — it does shape your life for the better. Knowing that your life is short (~100 ‘max’) helps to reinforce the idea that life is about living, and your life is what you personally do with it. If your life was say, 200 years than what’s to stop you from living in the present? If I know that I only have ~60-70 years before I become disheveled than the choices I make today will be with that knowledge. Conversely if I know I can live another 160 years, why not just say “I can start ____ in 20 years, I have plenty of time”. \n\nAccepting death can allow you to enjoy your life
CGP Grey, I see you're either out of video ideas or you've recently felt your own mortality.
We are here for a good time. Not a long time.
Personally I can’t wait to leave this earth.
I think to the death from I was 15, Now I am 17, It's enought (to pass on the good side) ??
Neither video really addresses the effects on the world of having humans that live for hundreds of years or longer. Just having humans that average more than 50 years or so has lead to exponential population growth. How unfortunate would it be to conquer aging only to see the world collapse logistically under the weight of 50 billion, 100 billion, or more people?
This video is autistic, even if you hypothetically slowed aging to a halt completely. The chances of you dying on any day, accident or any possible way is definitely easy. Its also funny you think governments would allow humans to live forever. Populations would be ridiculous. Also what are you going to do just work for an eternity without getting bored? Most people are bored only like 25 years into their career.

It's happening. https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sens+research+foundation
nothing is forever. even the best inventors know that no matter how amazing the technology is or how well it was crafted, it will never last forever. And it's possible that we'll die trying to figure out how to be immortal. we're already running out of resources for creating more technology, or making last. that's why you shouldn't waste your life on something that will never even happen in your life time to begin with. you can't just immediately jump to immortality when we can't even make it to Mars. if you want to focus on the future, focus on tomorrow. think of how you can make tomorrow better than today, cuz there's alot life left to live.

Damn I remember when jack had hardly any subs. It’s nice to see him come this far now. YGS was always my favorite 😂
Not hating on Jack but YouTube is really sucking his dick by first putting his videos on trending, i think others deverse be the there and now damn biography about him. Whas Casey a failed attempt since now he is criticizing YouTube.
Do the report of the week next
this guy is ducking g hallatious\n\n\n\n(only OG fans will get it)
haha this is coolest video i seen so far!
i've been watching jack since 2010-2011, and for so long he was so underrated and barely anyone knew him. everyone was gaining millions of subs, and he'd be stuck at 700k. now he's at 3 mil (should be over 10M tbh) and gets over a million views EACH video, not just the sketches! he's one of the very few o.g youtubers that i still watch now, and has always been my favorite channel <3
3:14 look at the commenter name, thank me later
lol what is youtube without that forehead
aha you did make one of these 4 years ago i wasnt making that up
y’all keep calling him jack when his name is actually john
Everytime he said 2006 and showed MCR I was so triggered 😔😧
Oh my god your on trending
Wish I learned this much in history class.
I went to the same high school and had the same english teacher as him!
I'm from Columbia MD too! Jack used to be my camp counselor at one of the Columbia Association day camps at lake Elkhorn. All I could remember about him was his obsession with Batman and Harry potter. Weird dude, but we all loved him
Never heard of this guy... until now...
Why does jack in the thumbail look like he had enough of the emoji movie
Where is Nepal 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵. \nIn jack history 😊
I hate to be the guy who says I prefer his old stuff.\nSo I won't be.\nJack's changed alongside Youtube and it's still really great to see him find new ways to be fresh on here. Sure, his comedy now is a bit more low-brow, but the whole world is more low-brow now.

I cant tell if Jack is being serious or sarcastic?
You should show some good albums for the year
How come I've never heard of this guy
Jack doesn't deserve to have a video made on his history. His privilege points are WAY too high for that kind of recognition.
He should do game grumps next
Yay for being one of the original 130,000.
Just how important it is to change things up and try new things.\nToo bad he's been milking YGS, Jackask, and YIAY for a few years instead of making original content like he used too.

OMG i'm starting to like Tay now
This song probably the best i hear this year 👼
Who wants a music video for this? 🙋🙋🙋🙋🙌🙌🙌
I like the background music 🎧 straight away. It’s very 80’s music. But I’m not sure 🤔 on the vocal tune - it doesn’t match with the background music. I not saying the vocals are bad though. 😘
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong\nWell, if a human has a strong magnetic field (which, according to the video is in, towards himself), then a negative EMF is induced to any metals nearby whenever he moves... However, that would mean that he wouldn't be able to live with metal around him without moving... This is actually an interesting one.
who wrote thi song. taylor and selena?..
I think broke the replay button.
i like this lyric video though lol
ooh ifeel gorgeous my self after listening to this song.

Watch part 2 by CGPGrey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qzDhGLx8 Also, if you for some weird reason don't know his channel you should feel bad for a moment, watch a few more videos and subscribe.
We should not find immortality.Everyone would fight over it and in the end only the rich will come out in the top.
Don't get hung up on the religious aspect, but more the historical relevance possibly or possibly not But the Bible states people were living upwards of a thousand years, and I don't see how that would be bad. If we adapt more technology we can feed everyone on the planet end starvation end disease end a lot of things, and still have plenty of room, the worlds population can fit inside of Rhode Island shoulder to shoulder, so we have plenty of room if we as people can adapt to the future. If we could live even half of that Imagine what could be accomplished. If we lived to be a thousand 100 years would still be adolescence, how crazy would that be? We can do it!
what about the unsustainable population growth
Thank you for the amazing video.
I am sorry to brake it for all ya outthere but max a human can live is about 400 years, cause there is little way you can fix a brain, I mean there is a way but you ainot gonna be human anymore. For 200 of those years your would prob have bad memorie loss basicly a veggie.
Men were given the gift of death by Eru Ilúvatar, they will always be the second children of Eru Ilúvatar not the first as the everlastinf Quendi are.
Well if death becomes optional, we will need either very harsh birth control or should encourage people to end their lives. There is enough of us. If i could just keep on living like i am right now, i would. Until I dont want to.
How about just live for Jesus and actually have no disease, pain, or stress when you die and go to heaven?
Fuck it if I can be immortal I'll take that bargain anyday of the week
I want to live forever.
I want to live forever.
I would actually like to die right now.
The goverment and leaders are pretty evil people, they will find a way to kill off population anyways to keep a balance in the Country.
Imagine being able to choose what you die for, instead of being caught in some disease you never wanted. People's lives could have so much more meaning, you could fall where you stood. What would the world be like if everyone could have a good death?
Maaaan if they fuckin cure aging right after I die of old age imma be so pissed
People need to age and die in order to free up space and resources for the next generation.  In a world where nobody grew old, the planet would be plunged into eternal world war.  These wars would be necessary in order to secure more of the dwindling resources for your people, and to kill off the excess population who won't die any other way.  Sure, you may live forever, but the world would be a horrific hellscape that you wouldn't want to live in anyways.
Sure, I'd like to live forever. Then I could become an astronaut and discover the entire galaxy if I wanted.
I'd like to stop aging around 5-10 lol
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 light years so i can travel to other planets out of the solar system or is the not enough?
If it wasn't for modern medicine I think 50% of people wouldn't be here today.
I'd like to live maybe like 10 more years. 35 sounds like a decent end.
Never. I never want to die. Id spend eternity bettering myself through changing my body with science. until I am no better than a synth who will have enough knowledge to save the universe from its own death.
We cannot end aging. Accept death it is everyone's destiny, but delaying death is possible. Death is inevitable you will die i will die your kids will die your grandkids will die everyone will die accept it and live the time that you have.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I want to live for 90+ years and leave this realm.
Overpopulation would be a huge problem if people started living even longer
Hey, I loved the video, but you shouldn't sell out your intro for sponsored content, even tho the video is great or well paying. Plugging your Patreon is way more respectacle than this weird sponsored content...
My grandma is turning from a fun-loving eccentric to a cranky old bat and losing her senses and memory, it's been really hard to cope with...
I would like to live 230 years
If I could I would live forever. I don't see why not.
And here it comes the concept of the biological waste
Most people won't want their aging to stop, religious people in particular. The notion of living without aging is pretty much blasphemous to them, a clear violation of God's plan. The religious people I know become very defensive whenever life expectancy statistics are brought up, much less biological immortality.
I will live until my lord god want me home to him. 👍
I wish i didnt have to age,  lol maybe i could just make a time machine for my cells lol
Pleases add some good video about '' when will world end 
we would have to be careful if we could live forever think of all the murderers that would be alive during this time
I plan to live forever, if possible. Hope I get it.
IF, if they can engineer an aging reversal on me back to my prime state, ending aging forever don't seems to be bad at all. After all, as how STEM progress exponentially, I do certainly wish to see how it will go in the future, my curiosity for this is endless. I DO wish to stay with my family longer, wish to accomplish things even further, there are simply countless things that an individual could do, yet unfortunately limited by our current aging process. \n\nThen again, immortality =/= invincibility, still gotta be careful m8.
My only issue with slowing down/stopping the process of aging is that there is a limited amount of resources on the planet, and less people dying is just going to overtax them even more then they already are
I think at least one thing will change. The terrible effect of existential crisis. One of the reasons why its so terrible is the time we have to do whatever it is we believe we were meant to do. It is way too short. And yes, we would be more responsible and would take better care of our home. Earth
Two people will not see each other’s funerals.
i feel like people would want to die if they live forever.\nfor example as a kid, i wanted to keep eating sweets and not healthy food but if my dream comes true then do i still want to eat sweets?
Live longer?!?!? Oh helllllll no, that’s my worst nightmare
The process of each generation growing up and then eventually dying off is important for the species... if not for the individual.  I'm fine with getting rid of aging.  I'm not fine with extending the life span of humans beyond what we've already done.  \n\nAging is resource intensive, as was pointed out in the video, and it'd be great if we could rely on preventive maintenance instead of what we have now.  It wouldn't be so great if stuck-in-the-past older people get to stay in power for longer periods of time.  We have a hard time advancing now, imagine if the Strom Thurmonds of our generation get to stay in their seats of governmental control for centuries.  We would halt, philosophically, as a species.  Technologically we'd advance, but that's about it, as technology zooms forward, all the people using that tech would just freeze in place because they will not be people who have been growing up with the newer tech.\n\nOr we eventually starve ourselves out of everything.  Let's not forget that resource management would be an even bigger problem than it is now, and it's pretty bad *now.*  We are not ready, as a species, to live for centuries at a time.  So yeah, keeping people from suffering due to old age is nice but the trade-off of having people live centuries is not nice at all.
7.6 billion years i wanna see the sun swallow the earth weeeeee
If everyone lives forever, than earth will get over populated. At least 200+ years
I'm sad now
Would I? Yes. For how long? Forever.
Hey kurz. I realise you really just wanna live forever dont you :P
The thing is, if this does happen.. only the 1% of rich up the ass humanity will have this, that's how the cookie crumbles and how the government makes their buck.
We'll overpopulate the earth
Disappointed. I came here for bird watching. Got to see only one
I've always said that I want to live at least a thousand years. Not because I fear death. I'm quiet interested in what comes after. I just want to see what our future holds. We live in interesting times people, observe it and enjoy it. Because so far we only get a glimpse of our history.
I'd rather not live longer in my fleshy body make me a cyborg so I can upload my conscience and awareness to a block and live forever without actually doing so
Severe lack of birds in this video.
We only want to grow old and dir because we are taught we are meant to, and because it has always been inevitable.\nPersonally I would love to live as long as I can, forever with my loved ones who do the same until there are no more loved ones alive, no more people to make into loved ones, and no more things to experience.\nI want to die when humanity does, because then the world would no longer have anything left for me and I won't have anything left to give it.\nEh, maybe I'll stick around for a year or so if I was the last person alive, just to see how the world be without us.
I would probably KMS as soon as iv'e done whatever I have always wanted to do, so I guess live till 60? Maybe a little longer, sharing what iv'e learnt/entertaining people until i'm ready.
Until I want to die I suppose.
Is monoatomic gold any good? I read some books about that and apparently the consumer only needs to take a tablespoon once every hundred of years or so. This is said to prolong life.\nThe same book says the elixir of life does exist and only gives you around 2000 years tops. Also, alchimists created a device that, once tuned to your internal frequency and kept around you, will extend your life to around 700 years
Why is this a question?  Are most people actually suicidal?  If you can live essentially forever with no negative consequences, then duh, of course you choose that.  If you feel like you'll get too bored, you must have a very limited imagination.
I'd love to live forever as long as i stay in my 26yr old body 😏
probably muslims hate this video 'cause their religion is full of shit and they are brainless
it'd be cool to live forever just to see how humanity advances and changes throughout the years. i'm curious to see what space exploration technology we've invented in a couple hundred years, or how popular music will change, or what video games will look like in 100 years.
I'll take as long as I can get to be honest...
I love living and  playing video games with my family but every beginning has a ending
I would want to live forever I don't care about any of the cons. I just want to live forever. I die when the earth dies.
I’d ask for another 350 years, very curious to see what the future of civilization and society holds
If the technology to become immortal becomes a reality, it should only be made available to those who agree to make themselves infertile.
People were meant to die nothing can change that I honestly think our timelines are perfect, any longer and we'd be in terrible pain or people who had loved ones killed would be more pissed than ever for all the time taken away and who knows what could happen, and plus it teaches humility and respect something that is very much lacking nowadays and what if Fidel Castro was alive for a few more decades or terrorists or dictators that wouldn't have been killed, people need to die good and bad, the stupid people who think we're are too advanced and will be able to be immortal when they get old need to grow up I've been perfectly aware of everyone dying since I was a child and never thought I wouldn't die, plus this also prevents people from being good because they could survive long prison sentences and wouldn't worry about going to hell
I want to die from wounds in a sword fight with another long aged, strong person. Preferably my best friend at the time, and lying next to each other. It's sad we have to kill each other because we disagree on stuff, but our fight will be the stuff of animes and movies.
This reminds me of the movie called In Time.
The comedy of this is dry, and awesome. Or this is a cheap, horribly obvious con.
This isnt a good idead. We will overpopulate the earth and we will kill ourselves without killing ourselves
So you're telling me we could be immortal beings if we didn't live on Earth?
I would like to live until my wits give out, not a moment longer
I think we would want to die? My theory i wont get into because it would take too long is we really are all the same. We believe our life is so special because we dont know any better. We all share the same experiences, all the exact same emotions, everything just in different quantities or orders. The truth is you have been here before and will be here again. Theres a cycle set up for aging. Being in my 40s now that thrill i felt as a kid is gone, i dont really enjoy hardly anything anymore. Ive watched movies to death, played all the video games, ive seen it all before and am bored. Every time i hear of a shooting i think how lucky that person was and when will it be my turn. I want to die in shock, looking at the sky not of old age or cancer. Its odd like running into bears or other life threatening situations its not bravery but more like i dont care, im dead inside. What i wouldnt give to go back and do it again though, to be young and have so much new but the only way to do that is to learn it all again and start from 0 again. If we lived forever we would become so bored/frustrated/upset it would over ride our natural instinct for self preservation.
Curing aging is not actually directly about immortality.\n\nI want eternal youth not because I want to live forever, because I want to take control of the pace that I live at. I am 19 and I hate the fact that in over a decade my body will begin the degrading process which will start to slowly cripple itself. There are too many factors in people's lives that are out of their control which may ruin the years of their prime. Didn't go through your youth well because of stuff like family issues, depression, missed opportunities and tragic events? You can salvage the time into the middle ages and still live well, but there will always be a feeling in the back of the mind that repeats what if [this didn't happen] time and time again.\n\nHowever the realist in me tells me the world is not ready for the cure to aging. We have far too many social and political problems to fix, and just who wants to see a Kim Jong Un or some ass rule a country for 500 years? Better for physics (not biology or nature) to take its course there.
Well this is depressing as shit
Forever
greek subs please!
Sad
You need Jesus.
Wow very interesting
I wanna stop ageing at 25
I member those babbling grapes
10000 years
Interesting...
130 - 160
Aging is good
Obviously not
Good massive over population.
Finally I have figured out a formula to dilate time and I am going to the MIT to prove my formula .Hope i'll be awarded with a noble prize. I think this will totally be a life changing for all the people of earth .
To be honest, I'd rather not even try to answer that. Who knows what life has in store for me, who knows what my future is? 'Yes' or 'no' both are equally meaningless to me right now. I have a sweet dessert in front of me right now. I think I'll just eat that and make my present me happy. Maybe I'll save some for the future me of tomorrow, but not for day after tomorrow. I don't think I need to care about that RN.
There is something so beautiful about the way these videos are put together.

Macht auf den Deutschen Kanal auch Video......wir sind DUMM geworden!\nPls!!!
But do we REALLY want eternal Trump?
Lets say if human ends aging in the future then we must cease regular reproduction as well
No wonder the black guy committed the most crimes.. hehe
Have these people ever actually played the fucking game ? Bruh I used to play the game 100% legal back when GTA SA was out .
Course black guy is the most criminal like
How to not to break law on gta v ( my way )\n\n*siren* GET THE FU#K OUT OF MY WAY , POLICE CHASING BAD GUY HERE ! GET OFF MY WAY !!!!
Chicks don't play video games. Well, chicks wanting to be journalists _SAY_ they do
I always follow the laws the best that I can when I play it
that gray hair lady looks like a sloth the ones that are slow and sleep all the time .
Is it me or I find satisfying sometimes to be a good citizen in GTA.
*Life Behind the scenes*
Admit it all have us has just played gta 5 without breaking the laws atleast one time just cause we was bored
This is what my mum does when she plays and it all goes wrong.
Bro sydnee hot af kinda annoying but could definitely catch this d any time she want
hmm who lost the challenge?
That how we should play the game
Garrick broke so many laws because he's used to going back into jail. Ok don't kill me please :'(
Women can't drive\nBlack people failing to resist from breaking laws\nI thinking SJWs were against stereotypes
Is it racist to say that I predicted Garrick would have the most crimes committed?
Lmao sydnee is a noob 😂 It's like Let's pretend there's no rules in gta Let's pretend theres no cops
5:28 I laughed so hard, please agree with me
I've been playing without any rules for ever I've played GTA V. They make it look difficult.
Why does she looks like maria ozawa
This whole video, I was thinking, Don't diss because you broke the damn law annnd they did
I like how that they gave Garrick a point for the fucking taxi drivers fault and if any reads this and ses ow u probably don’t play gta lvl254
7:50 *during flashback* Man sorry about that.
Who tf says grand theft auto we say gta v
What's next, riding a bike without pedaling?
Knew this would be hard lol
Who is Sydnee and why is she so cute?
Already messed up at the beginning:jaywalking
Its funny bc the black guy had the most crimes lmao!!!!
It's anonnyng how they can not act normal wtf
They could use the taxi.
They took it easy on Sydnee her crimes committed were close to double what they totaled.
When I play gta 5 I follow the “rules” when I’m bored 😂.
Of course the black one committed the most crimes. Doggone it man!
Black guy broke the law the most.
Are they brain dead
GTA were made for breaking laws even they
i like it how the black guy broke the most laws
How much jail time/fines would they get if this had been in real life Los Angeles?
*THIS GAME JUST APPEALS TO THE MALE FANTASY*
There's actually a video on this? Everyone knows what this is like because every GTA player has been bored playing.
Why did the black guy get docked that many times when he was punching guys? Buzzfeed racist?
Sydnee is me\nHost: don't break laws\nMe: *breaks all the laws*   They didn't see that
I do that for fun some times
This is supper racest make the black guy have the highest number of crimes.
Hasn't everyone done this at least once?
This is like trying to live without breathing to me .
When she said today it sounded auto tuned
The girl with pink hair seems to be a fun person to play online with.
“I think I broke only one law” - Garrick
They can't even ride the car properly, fucking noobs
The guy had me dead the entire video
Guys, just turn your character white and you literally can massacre ppl and get 0 stars...
The black guy has the most crimes out of all them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDah Fuq?????
Of course the black guy has more laws broken
I roleplay as a cop and this is a dessert with a cherry on top for me, so easy to drive normal
Y’all really ran out of ideas
Hey look at that, there playing the game not just saying is sexist.
RACIST GAME! BLACK GUY DOES MORE CRIME THAN WHITE PEOPLE!!! BAN THIS GAME
Girl with the pink hair has to be Sara Gilbert.
You guys are so bad at driving in gta 5
I dont think assault works like that. I punched him 5 times. That'll be assaultx5 for you
lol Garrick! My money was on you! 😂
Lol that brunette is a total psycho
bro, this isnt literally the easiest thing to do...
I break laws a lot it’s hard for me to not I be rolling down the street in my buffalo s aka Dodge Charger in online mode
i thought this was a misogynistic game that objectified females
You can’t play gta 5 without breaking the law, you can put on your seat belt
honestly, why does this video even exist.....
How is hitting a tree a crime i geuss if I go in public and punch a tree infront of a cop will put me in juvee
*1)* Driving a yellow light is illegal only unless it is unsafe to stop doing so\n\n*2)* Sydnee and Garrick look like they're actually trying to break the law on purpose\n\n*3)* I tried doing these things and it wasn't that difficult to get the tasks complete without breaking a law, it was pretty straightforward and easy
Isn't Trevor the worst?
Is it really surprising that the Negro committed to most crime?
How is it illegal to be in a taxi when it has a accident you are not even driving
Wtf a black gamer
Really fun video idea!
Just taxi everywhere easy
garrick played it properly
Vehicular manslaughter ahahsdfkdf

Hi
Simplyactuallydoinganailartlogical
I actually prayed to the ghosts when Cristine started writing *Ouija*
Oh we ja oh Christine so innocent it we ji 😂
You can use dry erase markers to set up the lines before you paint on the nail.
my mum just asked me if I was watching the Kardashians… apparently because of the word glowing
Ask the spirits if they are h💿l💿sexual.....make a vid of that
U should do extreme Japanese nail art
Please don't ever completely stop doing nail art
When you see this on your feed and laugh cuz u legitimately think this is click bait
Was literally just looking up ouija board nail art 5 days ago and now I've already done my nails a different way bcuz I didn't like any of them now u make this smh
Chris why didn't you do this for you scratch nail art!?!?! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps cuz chris dumb jk\n\n1 peel off base coat \n2 holo base Color \n3 taco \n4 black/white acrylic paint \n5 make a picture \n6 DONE!!!!!!\n7 original comment if anyone says the same to get Chris to notice them and not me 😞
Has anyone seen Cristine I'm do confused 😕
CRISTINE HOLY FUCK!!!! THESE NAILS ARE SO GOOD!!!!!! JEALOUS. YOU GOT SKILLS.
Christine is the most savage 29 year old I've seen
I think it'd be cool if you collaborated with simplyfacelogical and did nail art with makeup
Has anyone watched this with headphones in...idk if my headphones are just fucked but I shit you not the video played creepy music instead of her voice 😱👻😱👻
I want to rub the magic ball
I remember back when Cristine only had about 100k subscribers and now her channel is massively growing😭 I’m so proud, we came a long way my friends
You know the pentagram is actually not a dark and evil symbol it's a Wiccan symbol that represents all the natural elements
Who else just watched just because of her pinky finger
How long Has it been since your last nailart?
Holy crap, not only is it nail art, it's FREE HAND.
I LOVE THESE!!! Seriously your best nail art yet!! I think your freehand is getting really good Cristine!! ^_^
That is a pentacle not a pentagram....
Every time she says ooo eee juh I wanna die. It's supposed to be like Fuji but like weeeji
NO PEEL PORN?!?!? I'm disappointed
...Did...did you just...\n\n*YOU DID IT CRISTINE I’M SO PROUD OF YOU*
im so proud, she finally did nail art
Holy sHIT YOU MADE NAIL ART?! I MISSED IT SO MUCH ;0;
Get the board out of your house please I dont want another youtuber haunted, thanks Sam!! X'D
lmfao from the thumbnail i thought it was supernatural nail art
What's the name of the song that plays when Christina covers up Ouija on her nail?
girl, I've been watching since u didn't have a voiceover, I did miss the nail art haha
When I first saw the video's title I thought to myself Did Cristene do her nails HERSELF? Or did she hire a Russian Nail Artist??
When Ben says he missed Cristine doing nail art 😭😭😭😭 ugh my heart! Where’s my Ben?
What have we come to christine... its now big news when a nailart channel does nail art 😂😂😂🦄
That “pointer” is called a planchette Cristine holy shit no wonder it was a bitch to you 😂
I’m so proud of you- these look amazing!
Thank the Lord something I wanted to see
She should do acrylic nails with a peel-off basecoat so we can get ACRYLIC PEEL PORN. Also because she would hate herself for it and apparently she likes doing videos where she hates herself.
THANK YOU BEN FOR SAYING WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING
It's like she forgot how to make a nail art tutorial 😂
How many times do you reckon I could like this vid?
When i saw the thumb nail i was like...Did she actually do that?....Naaah she didnt! \nBut oh my goodness Cristine! WHAT AN ACCOMPLISHMENT! *claps* I AM PROUD
Girl I have been following you for 2 years!! I love your vids, what ever the heck they are about!
K but what does your other hand look like
She still made a trolly video after 😂😂u gatta love her 😂😂
That flaky holo nailpolish was soo cool i really want that!!
Corinne from threadbanger would love this.
Honestly I am so glad she’s making nail art lol
I love everything that you post, doesn't matter if it's a nail art video or some other random shit
Do a basic white bitch nail art video, you can put like Starbucks and Uggs on your nails
You forgot 'What's on my other hand?'
6h hour? That means 6h on an hand so 12h if you are a normal person and you do both hands!😂 Or 1h20 each nail...
Wait is Cristine actually doing a nail tutorial?! I am shook because now that’s scary
Daaaamn. Ben's got some shade! \nHe probably misses her doing nail art because she leaves him alone for a few hours.
I can't tell if you're joking around or if you really don't know how to say Ouija😂
I love you Cristine but it's WEE GEE not uh wee ja love love love love you
can u please do a graduation nail art tutorial because i have a lot of friends who say they r your fan and i would be amazing if you could do a tutorial PS:your #awsome
L💿L  very sp💿💿ky bu,t the holo protects me ish
The Ouija ball is kind of like bubble nails. hmm... interesting
*My nails say, Trump will release the CIA secret papers on JFK  in a day!!!*
The Ouija ghost kidnapped her! I mean look she did nail art
its a fucking christmas miracle y'all
I WAITED FOR SO LONG IM CRYING!

Nail art? What the fuck is this, a nail art channel?
Yaayyyy she is doing nail art now 😂🙌
OMG SimplyNAILlogical IS DOING NAIL ART! I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A MYTH (I’ve been watching you for years now #truefan)
The thing is with this and pretty much all your nail tutorials is that I'm allergic to acrylic paint so plz help me by making a vid with only water base stuff or oil or just anything without acrylic it's highly appreciated!👍  I don't want to sound desperate but like if you like this idea, plus trust me water base things are liquidy good luck!
Am I on the wrong channel? I thought I was on simply.... uhhh. Wait what????
IM REALLY FUCKING PROUD OF YOU
You are not good at nail art because you are amazing at nail art! just your intelligence alone makes your channel worth watching. You are witty and funny and amazing!
I love how she pronounces ouija😂
Can you make another video with Jen. Y’all are hilarious together
*simplynottrollingusthistimelogical*
Very good
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
I have been here since will it hot pocket
Rhett grow your beard out longer!!!!!! Like it was before you let link shave it off!!!
That show is too weird lol & I dnt understand how someone belching so much is funny...  I rather watch Southpark
I legit almost threw up watching this
Lol he says 2030 because of the UN 2030 agenga
You guys should do a Will it cereal this is great.
please don't say that again link lol

Somehow I'm jealous about eating eyeholes and simple rick wafers
No... this isn't happening
OH MY GOD ITS KATIE AT THE END
OMG I GOT TO SEE YOU GUYS IN AUSTIN!!! IT WAS SUCH AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE! LOVE YOUUU 😂😍🌈🦄
could you explain that?\nDoes lightning strike from the sky down, or the ground up?\n\nThe answer is both. Cloud-to-ground lightning comes from the sky down, but the part you see comes from the ground up. A typical cloud-to-ground flash lowers a path of negative electricity (that we cannot see) towards the ground in a series of spurts. Objects on the ground generally have a positive charge. Since opposites attract, an upward streamer is sent out from the object about to be struck. When these two paths meet, a return stroke zips back up to the sky. It is the return stroke that produces the visible flash, but it all happens so fast - in about one-millionth of a second - so the human eye doesn't see the actual formation of the stroke.
i'm a simple girl, i see rick and morty in the title i'm clicking the video.
Link with that weak morty impression. Good video though. Keep it up!
Cool video! but since you said you we're being accurate witht he foods then why wasn't the inside of the eyeholes green?

Nothing better then watching to grown man eating together and even better puking together I love this channel
I SAW GMM LIVE IN DALLAS TX AND OMG I LOVE YALL SO MUCH.
I just wat to say the show in Dallas was awsome and there was a couple that got engaged if you are reading this congrats!!!!!!!\n\nAnd rhett and link if u actually go to there wedding you need to tell us i want to know!
YOU GUYS SHOULD DO A BOB'S BURGERS BURGERS TASTE TEST. I BELIEVE SOMEONE MADE A RECIPE BOOK FOR THEM.
He opened the book to the exact page I am on
Do the Krabby patty taste test now.
So is every youtuber releasing a book now? I swear every single guy/ girl on youtube is releasing their own book. What are these even about?
I love this way too much, man. WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB
At 6:07 that’s what she said
Honestly this was a great idea for an episode. Even if they're riding on a popular show (which really like that's what they gotta do this show isn't just for every day viewers) they did a good job with it and it was interesting. Also really nice they gave credit to YouTubers that make the nice food versions of these treats.
You should have used pickles like pickle rick instead of pork brains
Who else is a “rick and link” and “Rhett and morty” fan
Lol y'all could've made them some chitterlings 😂😂😂😂

Is it weird that I found Chase's voice to be the most disgusting thing in this video?
Omg... I just went to a festival today (oktoberfest) and I saw Link's shirt there...
What gmm episode is it when Link puts water in his nose but plugs it and then plugs his ear

To be honest, you need a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is very subtle.
i’m liking this so that chase gets paid more 😂
Rhett and Link, I love you but please...please don't ever make those Rick and Morty voices again
There iq must be over 9000
Hi I was just wondering if chase is dating anyone in your circle???💋
They should a SpongeBob one !
It’s been awhile since y’all did a “will it” episode
You guys didn’t actually create an accurate replica of what it is you set out to replicate so... not that great.
PLEASE do a rhett and link make slime! like if u wanna see
This is my favorite show because it has quality content unlike the rest of YouTube.
Loved it!!!!! Props to the eye hole maker.
I bought their book
Rhett is Jabba the hut and Link is Princess Leia.
Why are some people getting so offended by the book promo specifically? They always promote at least one thing each episode. Especially when it's new. What's the difference whether it's the book or lip balm, beard oil, the mug etc.?  When it's not new they'll switch it up again.
This was too funny 😂
WTF IS WRONG WITH THESE GUYS!
I’m about to get dinner, why am I watching this?
I clicked hoping for the Szechwan sauce
Never in my life have i seen Rhett react so violently to them eyeball doodads.
You should get Justin on the show
now you have to have a high iq to watch gmm :(
thats an eyeball Morty, it doesn't melt in your mouth, it doesn't melt in your mouth Morty. \n                                                                                        \n                                                                                     – Rett 2017\nAnd I find it funny that Rett is Rick and Link is Morty
No Szechuan sauce? Excuse me?
Do Milk steak and jelly beans
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwww
Wy did you not try PICKLE RICK!!!!!!!!
The beginning was so cringe lol lmao omg haha

OMG....I see pizza skulls in my life soon.  Ok, my eight year old walked by and asked me why I was watching Corrine light hot dog candles. LOL. I said....nooooo bloody fingers....she said...ok...now I see it. lol. We <3 U. ;)
me: *at home alone with my cats on a saturday night eating leftovers*\nCorinne: “You don’t have any friends so you’re gonna be sitting at home. Alone.”\nme: damn Corinne you didn’t have to call me out like that...😒
You can’t say a whole paragraph without swearing in your videos
Please do a butter beer!!!
For the sugar skulls you should mix the sugar and water with cornstarch and wait at least 24 hrs
Def leppard, Queen, Harry potter and your aesthetic I think I love youu
ROB needs to do fruit caviar. Please. Fruit caviar?
what's with the extended outro? You tryna make a couple extra bucks or something? weak.
Not going to lie that shit at the end was relaxing af
You put too much water I the sugar cubes and didn’t press hard enough
What is the song at the end?
Honeydukes sells a bunch of brightly colored sugar skulls in Prisoner of Azkaban.
I like President Trump.
is it me or corinne looked pretty af while she was eating pizza
I HATE when youtubers mix Vlogs and Instructional videos together. Just upload a separate video and stop wasting 12 minutes of my time.
Always go to the dollar store first, you never know what shit you'll find in there
Let's be honest, you don't have any friends. Yeah, pretty much.
Idk if this would work, just a thought though, try using warm water for the sugar skulls. I just thought because sugar dissolves in warm water and can melt cause candy and junk, it would work better in warm/hot water.
Why the bad language?
NOT A UMPA LOMPA ITS DONALD J TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\ndid anyone read this comment. no ok
For the sugar skulls, put less water and let them harden longer. Some need to sit for days before the water fully evaporates. I let my large one sit for a week and it's still holding together a year later.
You should have used Ethilic alcohol for the sugar skull instead of water
DECORATE GALAXY PUMPKINS CORRINE LIKE IF YOU WANNA SEE THIS TOO
I bought pre made dough because we're doing 5 projects and I don't feel like making my own dough ummm I wouldn't even make my own dough if I was doing 1 project 😂
BLESS YOU CORINNE FOR THE CANDLE BIT AT THE END!!! BLESS. YOUR. SOUL.
You should make the Harry Potter uniform or the cloak
Fun fact. I can’t put up Halloween decorations because they are installing new windows and doors on Halloween from 8am to 8pm. FUUUUUUUUUCCCKK
CORINNE!!!!!!!!!! YOU HAVE TO BAKE THE SUGAR SKULLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Rule one: Always go to the cheaper stores
Did anyone else catch that she said “this should be pretty easy to finger out” while she was making the finger candles
I think what's wrong with the sugat skulls is that she put too much water
Corinne, everyone would agree that pizza is more important than rocket science. It's a well known fact.
HAY CORRINE, I-i like your necklace 😊      my birthday is in 10 days I know you don't really want to do math right now so my birthday is on October 30th 😎😎😎I know it's soooooo cooool
You should make a brain cake!!!
I miss the old Threadbanger..
Girl you know you have to re do those sugar skulls!!!!!!!!
Are we getting spooky in here?
Holy crap. She be wearing a philly d shirt
maybe the pins sugar cubes were really just ice cubes maybe. who knows with some pins you know
Was I the only one offended when Corrinne said pizza was more valuable than rocket science?😂😂
I love her hair 😍😍😍
Love you guys so much
Is... Is that a reference to Low?
I USALLY don't freak out or get grossed out by DIYS but the kinda burnt skeleton video scared me
Watching the live stream now saw you were reading comments
corrine for the spider web ide suggest you stand back a couple feet from the web and spray paint it
You're hilarious. Love it!
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE SONG AT THE END OF THE VIDEO? PLEASE HELP ME
For the next pin you should do carved candles based on candy corn
https://www.facebook.com/696404450522454/videos/2007448926177956/ CAN U TRY DIY HALLOWEEN SOAPS? THESE LOOK COOL
This should be pretty easy to finger out. Anyone catch that??
Corrine I love u but your candles look like carrots
Corrine you need to flip the sugar skulls over onto a baking sheet while there still wet and let them dry like that I made the same mistake trying to make mexican sugar skulls
I listened to all the music at the end and I loved every second
Do this do this DO THIS\nhttps://youtu.be/T1JaB2jtajo

@ 7:38 Not cool man, you look like a duffus . only thing cool is sign on your tshirt
How you have a Girlfriends
With the experimental look I think you should drop the button up and tuck the shirt in really tight. That would look really good.
What reaction was that for the addidas stuff?
I don’t like any of those clothes

Edgar clearly has a hard life lol
Something seems wrong here. Pewdiepie is trending. Ok the adpocalypse is over, the apocalypse is about to begin.
Where did she get the jeans, camo pants and shoes??
The experimental outfit made Pewds look like the guy from PPAP
I Love brown felt !!!

HER VOICE I LOVE IT
Cav Empt is a streetwear label in Japan, you're in for a treat Pewdsssss

THIS IS ADORABLE AND CUTE😭❤️
In ever video I've seen of people buying each other's outfits nobody ever likes the jeans like wHaT Is YoUTuBeRs PrObLeM WiTh JeAnS they are stylish and comfortable dammit
Well now we all know Marzia has great fem style but can't style men.
the japanese outfit makes him look gangsta or japanese drama.
When Marzia hosts the video it's in 1080p instead when PewDiePie Hostess it in 720p XD
Pewdiepie has more subs then the population of Australia
Is that really her voice??

☝How to waste your life away by watching dumb videos.\n\nThis world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained trying to be famous and shopping in strip mall's and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. Its a Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place. \n\nToss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \n\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!💛💛😘👏👍😊 \n\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek
my name is austin\n\nsteve austin
Finally, I’ve been wanting to waist $200 for a long time now. Thank you
Seriously that's some bullshit from Jitterbug/great call, as I recently went to the Cricket store and had them switch my unlocked Moto G4, and they had it up, and running with my existing phone # in about 30 mins and it only took that long because they had an issue porting my number from Net10.
i really wanted to see how the karaoke thing worked :/

The yellow coloured sky was due to the hurricane which brought up Saharan Dust which made it look yellow, and made the sun red coloured.

Thought Jake paul had made it onto this show for a second there
I'm so happy people are worried about this cause it's not like our co u ntry has serious problems to worry about.
Two of my favorite artists! I'm glad they worked it out!
I love this girl 😘
they are both extremely talanted and strong women.  they should be embracing each other no petty fighting
but imagine Christina swinging on P!nk. The imagine really is funny
This guy is the biggest tool ever
If I heard him right he said ''pig the time has come for you to plead the fifth''. Just putting that out there. Lol😂 speach fumble that's all it was.
Pink likes to get physical. I can't believe Xtina swung on Pink.. I gotta see that 😂😂😂😂
PINK LOOKS LIKE A PIG.
Why do pop acts have so many problems in the genre?  Christian and country genre are like drama free.
OMG why can't anyone teach Andy how to pronounce Aguilera
does this man always stare into the camera like that? o-o
I thought that was Jake Paul
And she is a BUCKS COUNTY GIRL, A suburb of PHILLY, NOT THE CITY, I USED TO GO TO RAVES WITH HER IN THE EARLY 90s
love pink - all day. she's the best!
so i couldnt help but to hear the Wargame red dragon game music in the background..... umm did that really happen on the show?
Pinks has to answer to her daughter.
If you want some beef...\nThen don't come to *JENNAS BASKETBALLL GAAAME TOMORROOOOOW!*\n\n*SHE'S A VEGAN VIRGO*
I’m pretty sure they have both eaten each other’s beef.
Pink USED to be risqué
Pink, Xtina, Briney and Beyonce are the REAL OG ❤️❤️
I never heard that song Sips Tea
Aguilera is talented, West, please explain how?
Why is this trending? Who paid for this?
thought it was jake paul in the thumbail
The untalented always need to live in denial
Pink you suck and I bet your down there department is real steaky
I don’t like pop music, or whatever she does, but I love her
I love Pink so much! She looks stunning and I really love her hair.
Why is the next button not working on this video?!?!
Why would anyone wear their hair like that? LULLz
He's asking her very invasive questions.... :/
life isn't traumatic, people are fucking mentally fucking unstable.
This guy had the same surgeon as Bruce Jenner.
I love how far their relationship has gone, it's very endearing and now I see both of them in a new light - now if mariah can get to know jlo
i'm not really sure if she grew up as a person that much or she's much better in playing the game
Can we address whether she is a transgendered woman?
was this the taylor and katy feud back in the day ?
Damn shes even uglier than i thought. Bet she spends entire days drinking and sitting in the sun
Sorry, but this whole thing is a waste of space on the Internet.
I wanna give a shout-out to the 2000s generation that grew up on Britney, Christina, P!nk, Jennifer Lopez, Avril Lavigne, Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Hilary Duff, etc
I thought that was Jake Paul in the thumbnail
I love pink, such a good person.
who. gives. a. fuck.
This is trending because of the Kanye mention.
Just by the hair i thought it was jake paul
If pink was a chick id smash
It's P!nk ... did you honestly think she wouldnt be honest? P!nk is super honest
Imagine if Pink didn't find it hilarious, Xtina would have been wrecked.
You know singers are desperate for promo when they go on Andy Cohen....
Only Pink I know IS PINK FUCKING FLOYD.!!!
Pink looks so hot with that hair style.  I would bang her while her husband went out for cigarettes.  Pink is the epitome of cool.  She has been fearless since childhood.  She is a self made millionaire.  She doesn't take shit from anyone.  She reminds me of Leah Remini  but with a more feminine, less confrontational personality.  That balance is what makes her cool.
I love Pink's subtle, passive-aggressive shade. It's interesting that Christina swung on her, I can only imagine it the other way around. Pink did not take that seriously AT ALL lol.
Of all of the horrible things coming out of Hollywood and the music industry lately, Pink is one of the good things.
This guy is an idiot
today i found out pink is still biologically alive
Can P!nk address her humiliating Christina on her try this tour
P!nk like the crazy high school mom who fucks all her sons friends
Really glad I watched this. Still love P!NK. :’)
Taylor Swiss
her hair is traumatic
P!nk is a badass
Click Bait!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mad respect
Pink Rocks!!!
gay
Haha. Cool hair though ;)
#whocares
*YEEZUS FORGIVES YOU*
nobody sings like aguilera
xtina didnt even know about the beef
Just another ugly Jewess...
Pink has an Adonis belt... Weird...
celebrities are pieces of trash idiots.
Pink has elongated clit.
Love you pink!
Check it out!!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyKs-DJJFvY
300k views is trending?
❤ Pink ❤
Hail Bitchina!
She looks like a dude lol!
Her hair it wack
Big Pink
wishing you success pink
واہ واہ alien written
Just shite
Boring. God damnit.
I love her. Unapologetically herself.
Pink hair is gorgeous
Pink looks pretty good..
Shes so cute
https://youtu.be/AWDE7XnMi4w
What's even funnier than that is that this bleached blonde imbecile has some delusion that she's tough. lmao
Pink is a very handsome man
Pink got heavy.Wow any more weight and they will call her pig.
Pink SWEARS she's talented but isn't and is essentially a spoiled bish who was tailored for fame bcuz of her nationality
Cristina is gross
Why are you taking so long for a video? It used to be one video every two days.
*I've been subbed since you were at 24k*
So happy to see this channel doing well, well deserved, you awesome fellow
Romans themselves became an endangered species. The irony.
Why do you have to swear?
Your drawing of a crocodile fucking terrifies me.
sometimes they would rub the pussy juices of female animals on humans, then they would release the male animals and watch them rape the humans, pretty interesting  stuff
What were kids games like back in ancient rome or whatever ancient civilization?
So fucking glad you put something up.   Needed that tonight :)
There's stick figure hosts all over my Trending rn *and it is glorious.*
#17 on trending and it has only 500,000 views YouTube is censoring right wing and conservative / even provocative ideas are being censored and this is being peddled at us I love Sam but this is bullshit to the fullest just come from a video with a million views no trending been up one day wtf dude
I'm all in for that super bowl idea
He’s got fucking dragons
Well...this was the opposite of charming and entertaining. I couldn't even finish it.  There's enough shitty stuff to endure in the world right now without watching shitty stuff from history in doodle form.
2:14\nI cannot unsee that now... thanks?
Where’s the real Sam
Thanks for the great videos.
I can tell his voice got deeper now
Sam O'Nella Oups... I eared Salmonela the first time
Wait but why is the content totally irrelevant from the title?
You should upload more often!
White people are evil... Just. Savage
Does his voice sound different?
As for suggestions... unusual phobias or -mancy or -cracy. If you use any be sure to link my channel too..lol.
Fame is Lame. This world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained trying to be famous and shopping in strip mall's and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. Its a Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place. \n\nToss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \n\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!💛💛😘👏👍😊 \n\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek
Where's the source?
What's wrong with people? How can see such beautiful and exotic creatures and have your first thought be to kill them? What's wrong with people? What's wrong with humanity!
THE STARS HAVE ALIGNED SAM HAS UPLOADED

Why can't you upload more, your so awesome!
Here before this channel blows up big time.
Since when do you have over 400k subs
This should not be as funny as it is. I kinda feel bad for the monkeys
i can't believe even the most violent culture ever known in europe back then cried after an elphent, i would cry for a criminal suffering like that too.
Omg I thought you said “I’m salmonella”
Glad to see you active & also trending. Good job
You should do a video on how Hernán Cortéz legit destroyed the Aztec empire
I hope one day this channel gets so popular that more than a few videos come out each week
Well this was a dark and depression video...
You are as funny as a fart in a SCUBA tank.
Food in the French Revolution
Who the hell is Sal Monella and why is he fingering my chicken??\n\nYes, i know that it's Sam O'Nella.

Already watched this video three times, and I still love it!
He's back ladies and gentlemen
Where the fuck have \nyou been
Yes praise the Sam O'Nella Memedaddy God. He has blessed us with his presence! Wait why is their better editing...I don't really like this new format...the older one was more enjoyable
Sam! I thought you died.
Can you pleaseee do a video on the 13 levels of Hell!!! I would love to see your version of it!!
Some random person: What school do you go to?\nMe: Oh i go to Sam O'Nella Academy. It's a really great school, you should go there.
finally a good content creator on trending
You should definitely make a video about the crusades. Especially the 4th one - it's such a historical fuckup, it would fit the style of your channel perfectly.
He's finally blowing up
Is this the new GradeAUnderA
This is what humanity has come to..
*Books flight to Rome to decapitate an Ostriche*

I liked Sam before it was cool to like Sam
4:06 the humanity of Romans to kill bananas. 🍌 🍌 🍌 Without bananas their would be no banana republic which means no banana republic video.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe people that died because of banana republic are important too I guess & no minions.

Ok, I feel really bad for asking, and I'm not being offensive or rude, but is James gay? Not trying to be rude, just asking because his babe looked like a dude
It's not plagiarizing if the title is school stories because you removed the my(right?)

Sorry man, but Euler's Identity should read e^(i*pi)+1. The 1 term is not located in the exponent of e.
He wrote the identity wrong, the plus one isnt in the exponent... but I'll forgive him
0:48 That expression is not zero. It's negative e.
We have essay for MATH

Do people not get that the whole point a lot of schools teach you math and make you comprehend Shakespeare is not just in the literal sense, like you’ll have to be able to find the area of a ferris wheel in the real world, but because of building cognitive development in growing brains? The reason you do a lot of things in school is not for necessarily learning a lot of information, but just for putting yourself in many different situations which require you to work on critical thinking, so in the future you can think rationally and independently for yourself
DUED TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD SHOWS ABOUT THE GIRLS DAD IS A LAWER FOR A BLACK DUDE WHO DIES BECAUSE THEY DIDNT BELIEVE HIM GETTING RAPED

Jaiden is by far one of the worst youtubers I have ever seen.
The Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends! \n\nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Him! He LOVES you! \nHe is NOT angry at you, so please don't listen to the lies of the devil. Jesus died so that you may live! Let this truth bring you comfort in knowing how much the God of the universe LOVES you. So please call upon Him in sincerity today. You may not get another chance, and to die without Jesus is very dangerous. \n\nHe is waiting on you to come to Him. He promises to NEVER drive anyone away when they come to Him, so don't let nothing or no one stop you from seeking Jesus while you still can. You will see Him. Hallelujah!\n\nShalom, friends.

Definitely Ali's grandfather checking out the ferrari! That was a lovely moment :-)
I just love your positive attitude in ALL your videos, including this one and the love you have for Ali and Lumi (lumi is the Finnish word for snow btw) makes me on such a good mood for the day! I always save your videos for the next morning to start my day right! Apart from this video - I would love you to do either a blog post or a video about planning your wedding, after the wedding is totally fine. Like what did u do first, I know about the flowers and dresses and Jo Malone scents but I have absolutely no idea where to start with our 2019 wedding! We are meeting our wedding planner but like knowing what u did is prob as important as what the planner has to say. And I totally advised my maid of honor to watch your hen party video as an inspiration..... the weekend looked incredible! Lots of love from Finland!
She is your manager
They have the pyjamas in marks&spencers in white for £35!!
This Vlog was fun! Loved to see you drive that Ferrari... that motor sound 😍

Always enjoy your interactions with Ali in the vlogs actually. Also your flawless makeup sheesh! Fav part of this video is seeing how much joy spending time with your friends and families brings you
Carrie is the cutest person in the world!
So sweet Lydia💞💞💞💞
Ali’s Nan’s house literally made me feel cozy while watching in Ohio! Lovely vlog, Lydia! Looking so forward to Vlogmas! xoxo
When you describe your reaction when people turn around to see whats going on 😂 hope you get your own Ferrari soon
Love all the dainty diamonds in ur ears, so pretty 💎 I think a little diamond would look gorgeous in ur nose too. I love nose piercings. Thanks for another great vid, they could all be 4hrs long & it still wouldn’t be long enough!! 🤣 xx💖
You driving the Ferrai was the most dope thing I've seen you do this month (let's exclude any makeup event cause by Terry and reaching 500k was also epic) ❤❤
Honey chile diamonds are my birthstone! I love the piercing. I love family! The piercing in your with the gorgeous earring, what is that called? Visiting Ali's people!
Didn't realise you had a sister? Would love to see her in one of your vlogs. X
Love your videos, but please stop saying autumnal! You have said it way too many times over the past few weeks. Died laughing when you said, You know when nothing tinkles your fancy? However, Lumi is the total star always. Love her so much!!! ❤️
ALRIGHT whose buying me the jacket
fab video, love your channel! x
What was the nail colour you had on before you changed it? It was the perfect burgundy!
Favourite part of the vlog was when you were outside the house and was like look you can see my breath made me giggle!
Is that security camera at the top right corner of your mirror at the beginning of the vlog? LOL
You are a joy to watch! Plus your autumnal swag is muy fuego 🔥 Loved being apart of your experience as much as it was ours too. I’m living vicariously through you! love from Toronto! Xoxo
I loved it when you were explaining how people turn when you start the engine of this car. Especially the way you said Helouu HAHHA died!
The cutest sloth. Loved seeing mom light the fire, her voice is the cutest and Lulu is bae for sure!
10:11 that was my jam growing up lol
definitly Ali's Grandpa seeing the car is my favorite part   :) :D
+LydiaElsieMillen Are you still doing Vlogmas this year with your wedding and all? I still watch last years especially your visit to *The White Company* so christmascee! xxx
Fabulous blog. I've just ordered a couple of watches and over the moon with the discount code 👍👍👍 thank you! What couloir are your dark nails, they look amazing..?????? Xx
OMG that green coat is amazing, it looks so good on you  😍😍
Definitely Loulou the dog 's my favorite part of this vid coz it looks exactly like my dog lucy🐶🐕
I'd say I like all of it. it's my quick down time when my baby takes a nap. makes me wish you did daily videos. Also, you totally inspired me to use all my other ear pircining. I had a bunch of then done when I was a high school and as I got older I just used my main holes for studs. but seeing how cute your ears turned out inspired me to put some of my ear piercings back in and honestly I Love it! thanks for bringing back the trend it's really chic.
I never enjoy anyone else’s Vlog as much as I enjoy yours! I’m not sure if it’s because of your laid back personality or the accent.. or a good mix of both😂 I’m from the States so I am always intrigued by your tone of voice! We’re a lot less well spoken here in Louisiana haha! Xoxo
Loving all your videos..you ve got a  lovely vibe. I wish you the very best and hope your grandma recovers soon xx
Lydia!! It’s international Sloth day today and I thought I would let you know that this fact made me think of you 😂😂
Is the Coat warm?
Side note I love your energy. I'm definitely subscribing to your page .. check out my pg ✨
Your vlogs have changed so much. I used to love watching your videos and always was excited when notified you uploaded but the last month or so they have been very slow.
I love your vlogs! But a tip woman to woman,, pop some foundation on your upper ears as well :) Better color match xoxo
You are so lovely Lydia. I'm sick in bed today and your videos make me smile xxx
also want to have my third hole piercing on ear like yours but I am a bit afraid that it hurts
Another great blog!!! What breed of dog is lulu??xx
Lydia your House Number is 17??? Mine too! I believe number 17 means a change of good things!!!
I really like u showing new styles and just making me laugh 🤣
Hello Lydia,  where I can find your pyjama ? Is absolutely lovely ;)
Where is that red turtleneck sweater from?😍
Love your vlogs! what camera do you blog with?
Lydia - Can I ask when does your promo code for Cluse watches expire? I'll be going on holiday soon until the 31st October so I won't be able to order until I get back home. Kinda sucks that they don't do next day deliveries otherwise I could have ordered one today.
SO FUN!!! Love your coat and love your pretty makeup!! Can you do a new tutorial on it? So great the makeup for everyday!!
Lydia.. I love you and allie..I think the two of you are great and I still don't know what kind of car you guys have. Pliease let me.   Know..By the way, I absolutely love your green coat! I mean I still don't know what kind of cat you have😻
I always liked your ear rings Dior and the silver hooks you wore but these you can't really see anymore. 😟🙁
Why not buy bug spray... I hate spiders as well.
i love the piercings!!! I didn't even expect it, such a nice treat :D
This has literally made my day. Snuggling with my sloth mug and giant bar of dairy milk. Recovering from being in hospital having had a car accident feeling a bit crap but just watching your vlog has cheered up my day! Thank you Lydia xx
Just finished watching the vlog and loved watching you drive the Ferrari but most importantly what you said about being able to share moments like those with your family because of your job ❤️ you’re my inspiration Lydia 🤗
My favourite bit was definitely seeing you driving the Ferrari. Already saw it on Instagram stories and was so excited to see the vlog!
The part I like the most was when Ali's grandpa seeing Ferrari he seemed to turned back to his young age again with those  sparkling in his eyes...👍👍👍...such a memorable moment
My favourite part of all your vlogs is when you just sit and chat, it's usually at the end when you say your waffling on but it's the part I love the most ❤️ Also the longer the vlog the better, so KEEP WAFFLING!!
I ment have lol
저는 대학교를 다니지 않아서 대학축제분위기가 어떤지 정말 궁금했었는데, 조쉬와 조니덕분에 저도 현장에 같이 즐기고 있는 느낌이드네요😁😁
한국인 BJ가 영국 대학교 축제에서 저렇게 했으면, 영국술병으로 처맞았으려나..
우리나라는 외국인들 진짜잘해줘서 재밋게놀다가는대 우리나라는 유럽가면 인종차별당하고 필리핀가면 돈가방이라고 납치당하고 딱히환영받지못하는듯
영국애들 술마시면 워낙 사납고 무섭게 변하면서 인종차별 욕설 하는 애들이 많아서 나는 영국에서 밤에 길다닐때는 펍에가서 술마시고 나오는 애들 피해 다녔는데 영국인들은 한국와서 대학가서 대학생들이랑 같이 술도 마시고 참 재밌게 사는듯 진짜 한국 비제이가 영국 대학축제 취재한답시고 저렇게 돌아 다녔으면 뭔일 나도 났지
한국관광홍보대사라는 말이 믾은데 사실 영국남자 시청자의 99퍼센트는 한국인 ㅋㅋ
만약 동남아에서 온남자가 동남아남자라는 채널을 만들고 이렇게했어도 이렇게 잘됬을까? 영국출신 백인남자는 이렇게 한국대학에서도 잘어울리지만\n반면 최근 한국 동양인남자가 길지나가다 영국에서 폭행당한사건 또 수많은 인종차별들 잊지말았음하고 한국에서만큼은 다른많은인종들 다 차별없이 평등하게 대해주었으면 한다...
Your channel is always so uplifting and fun. And Johnny's attitude added is a plus. Thank you
I loved this you could feel the energy of everyone having fun so awesome, it was an amazing video can't wait for the next one 😂😂😂
That's incredible. I would love to experience something like that.
Lolololol this is so fun
ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT
I CANT FIND THE LOVE BUTTON!!!!
talking about living to the fullest.. this is sooo fun to watch!
omg next week looks insane! i've never seen a festival like that! i'm so exciteddd

영국 누구는 한국인을 병으로 후려쳐서 이빨을 다 날라가게 하고 누구는 그 한국 와서 축제랍시고 즐기네
지금 한국은 물론 전세계에서 주목하는 쇼킹뉴스인 이번 영국에서 있었던 한인유학생이 영국 학생들에게 당한 인종차별적 발언과 폭행을 당한 사건에대해 아시나요? 영국남자님 덕분에 영국에대해선 좋은 이미지와 신사같은 이미지들만 봐왔던 우리 구독자들에게는 많이 쇼킹한 뉴스 였습니다.. 그사건에대해 영국인으로써 언급이라도 해주세요
샴페인병으로 맞은 한국인 어캐되었나요? 궁금합니다.

영국인이라서 부럽다~^^인종차별 당해서 쳐맞을 걱정도 없을거아니야ㅎㅎ
먹고살려면 이래야한다는건 알겠지만 한국좀 적당히 빨아주세요 영국남자님...하나도 보잘것없는나라 너무 띄워주니까 보기 불편합니다
와 예고편... 우리가 바로 고대다ㅏㅏ다아아ㅏ아아아ㅏㅏㅇ악 하고 아우성치고 포효하는 느낌이네요\n고대 가겠습니다 꼭
Your content is so unique and original!!! I appreciate everything you produce on this channel & I love Jonny, and Ollie's featuring!!!!!!!
조쉬는 한국남자 싫어 하시나요? 인종차별 있으세요? 뉴스에서 보니까 영국에서 영국인이 한국인한테 시비걸고 맥주병으로 얼굴쳐서 이빨 1개 나갓다던데...영국인 으로써 해명좀 부탁 드릴게요...
Hey Guys I really enjoy your channel it is so lovely. I want to ask some favor.  For the sake of Korea's recent cleanings of old political shit, would you be the journalists who investigate this MH group from Britain of which lawyers are Rob Dickson, Haydee Dijkstal? They are totally insane to help Park based on false assumptions in the UN human rights council with our national issues(but we have the legitimate and legal systems based on better democracy ).(You can watch it at one of the JTBC's main news) As S.Korea's candlelight citizens, we want to know how much money of Korean people were paid for that company for our ex-president s*** Park. If it were paid, we didn't even start to investigate illegal moneys from her father the dictator Park in the 60's because there still are a lot of shits to be probed. So we don't like taxpayers' money to be paid behind the curtains like that. They should know that Park paid for her sake with our money. And we want to know exactly how much it was paid. Any guess or help?
영국에서 한국인 유학생 위스키 병으로 맞아서 이빨 10개 나간거에 대해서 어떻게 생각해요? 영국남자님

Mobile users beware his voice will activate Siri
Congrats on #31 on trending
Peta watches (IM TRIGGERED!!!!!!)
wtf
Doggo
Haahaha!
noice vid m8
both are cute
2:23 I DIED
I want your dogs
MY ALEXA ANSWERED YOU!
IT'S THE SAME FUCKING DOG!! I WANT A REFUND
When he said hey Siri at 1:40 Siri actually turned on xD
When your out of content.
What kind of dog is that?
All you had to do is follow the damn dog franklin
get a hamster and do a “$1 dog toy vs $1000 dog toy”
You made me laugh, have my like sir
that green toy sorta looks like a dildo. Either that, or I have an excessively dirty mind.
what motherboard is the expensive dog using?
Reply To My Comment And I'll Show You My Peepee.
Who else expected the $1 dog to be Kermit?
I was seriously expecting the $1 dog to be one of Jenna's dogs. Damn missed opportunity for a roast!
Ain't gon catch no nigga with dem white mans dogs.
Snowflakes in the comment section.
I haven't seen a single Will it blend? comment. Now I feel all old..
1:07 looks like the dog is in intense misery and wants to die a quick death
Omg. When he said “hey Siri, high five” my actually Siri thing came up and said “hello, and then my name”. Wtf 😂
What model type is that dog
If you really want a cheep dog, you can get one for one cent. Videos of the product are available on Jenna Marbles channel.
That Will It Blend reference brought many memories back.
You can even see how the $10000 doggo is in a smiley face box and the $1 doggo is in a downy face box
Rename this video Buzzfeed in a Nutshell
The $1 one looks like a fluffy version of Scrat from The Ice Age
1:10 when i was watching this I have an Alexa in my room and when jack said alexa give me a kiss two seconds later she said I like you as as friend  ...... W-wait WTF I SAID NOTHING ALEXA
Damn I miss will it blend
i was expecting one of them to be jenna's dogs
The $1 is disobedient as hell, money well\nSpent
I tried rebooting I tried upgrading the software\nMe:I am dead
i expected the $1 dog to be one of Jenna’s dogs
Wow he said hey Siri and Siri went off.
My Alexa heard “give me a kiss” and said “I like you, as a friend...” i got unintentionally friend zoned by my Echo
All i want to know right now is\n\nhow do you tell which one is klondike and which one is sundae\n\nis klondike the one with those lines near the eyes?\n\n\n\ni lowkey need help.
Who else Siri came on when he kept saying hey Siri?😂
100% expected you to open up the $1 box and take out pictures of Kermit or Marble...
It would have been great if one of Jenna Marbles dogs was the $1 dog. Probably Marbles, if he's still alive. He seems like a $1 dog.
China :-  .... but which dog tastes better with Szechun Sauce? 😁
The one dollar dog was adorable
For the 1 dollar dog you should've photo shopped Kermit jenna's dog
28.567% comments is people saying my echo, iphone, android went off with command! Lolololol. *sigh*
The 1 dollar dog look me fuck off
i was expecting a joke about jenna's dogs
If both are boys then the one dollar comes with a gay package
I'M WHEEZING--
1:13 should've tried Bixby. smh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9je1vixeGo
Nice video, John!
You have to be carful when you open it\n\n\n\n\nThen stabs the box all over the place
Have you tried turning it on and off again?
Guys im not sure but i think my dad has a crush on my mom
Holy shit I didn't realize how many retards are in this comment section
You currently have both a video on trending, and a video about you on trending, we made it reddit!
Haters will say it’s fake...
Give this man his $1 BACK
10000$ dog vs 1$ dog.                    Vs 10000$ dog is more like it
STOP SAYING HEY SIRI FFS IT PAUSED MY VIDEO EVERYTIME
https://youtu.be/ok2vu7Ukea0
I think he is just making fun of price comparison videos and he just bought the dogs for the same price
Why he push boxes (in boxes dogs)
Is this a spoof on buzzfeed's worth it? Please pardon my slowness.
Your copying idubbbz you shit
WHAT BREED ARE THESE GLORIOUS CREATURES? Pomeranian? Spitz?

I think I'm going to try and cook along with the steak episode. It'll be my first proper steak, so happy it'll be based on a recipe that Babish is using!
This series is so great- It makes me feel more confident that I know a lot more then I think- and JESUS LOOK HOW YOU CUT THAT ONION -  MY ONION CUTTING HAS IMPROVED 10 FOLD!  Im always trying to keep the onion together with my hand whilst making sure not to chop a finger off. Now I KNOW HOW TO DO IT PROPERLY! (Also holy god you have a good knife to cut that tomato the same way- Need to buy a fancy knife T_T)
Your voice is so soothing. Your boyfriend/girlfriend is lucky.
I didn't know Tim Howard moonlighted as a chef
Started watching you on facebook and then well. Bing watching your channel on youtube, when I should be doing other things. So I decided to check out your website. But it wont connect. I would suggest take a look at that.
What ingredients should I have for the live stream?
Please do Minny Jackson Pie from “The Help” please!!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Man, your commentary sounds so educated.
Why not try something from the HANNIBAL series? \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrFMEAWRSZ0
Are there any non alcoholic alternatives to the wine you used for deglazing? I'm not quite the drinking age but I would really like to make the sauce you made for the steak.
Why dont you like cilantro
“if you ain’t got no sauce, then ya lost. BUT you can also get lost IN the sauce.” \n\n\n- gucci mane
You should make some stuff from Charlie and the chocolate factory like if you agree
did i miss where you made the fond?
Made the Mac and cheese AND the steak with that red wine sauce. Delicious!!
#FATJOE NEW SMASH HIT https://youtu.be/AvmOC-SwnhU
hfs..holy fkn shit man amazing
Everybody say it with me...... RGOGSH!!!!!
heya! I really like your content and would really love to see your livestream succeed and become a regular thing just like your youtube channel already has! With that being said, being a fan of yours as a european makes for some interesting cooking-adventures at 2am (including angry flatmates). While I know this might be a lot to ask, i suspect actually a rather sizeable chunk of your fanbase is located around europe, and while I know you can't cater equally to every timezone, I'm quite sure the *occasional* Basics With Babish at 2pm EST will be very much appreciated by the whole lot of your european fans
Please do foods from Asian Movies
i thought you were gonna stuff the salsa into the peppers. I would have eaten that like that. Love me some peppers.
9:27\nMe in my head: *FOND FOND FOND*\n9:33\nMe out loud: WOOoOOOOOOOoooO
yummy! make halloween cake #JcvtpWQ75mI
wheres that mac and cheese recipe
Definitely making all of these
I have irritable bowel syndrome and cannot tolerate onion or garlic. Is there anything I can use to give a similar taste?
Babbish doesn't like cilantro..... I love this man.
When I deglaze, I use balsamic vinegar. Gives you both the flavor notes of red wine and the lemon.
Amazing video. The color tones of the different cameras are a little off though.
Wait, this is not how to basic
Bruh you should make the sloppy Jessica from Brooklyn Nine-Nine
Oh man, feelings great to know a real Chef despises cilantro as this mere mortal! I've heard of the  butter in red sauce but don't know if Nona would approve. 🤔
Bechamel is a lot better if you add just a little bit of nutmeg to it. Don't know why it works but it makes it taste a lot more cheesy.
When I was living in the carribean, I learned to use a glass to peel a mango. It blew my mind and I will never go back. Try it!
Great video. Is your cutting board plastic or glass?
Bechamel, hot roux, cold milk no lumps!
I love the subtle Nat Sounds you had in here!
Ello, ow are you? What's an erb?
Babish! Should the milk for the bechamel sauce be cold, room temp, warm? Or does it matter? I've always struggled with this!
Mrs lovettes meat pies!
Wow I'm always blown away, you're an absolute delight to watch :) <3
That garlic press can automatically remove the paper.
Your knife is so sharp... 😢😢😢\n\nI use a small serrated knife for mine 😂
Trying the mac'n' cheese right now and damn does the sauce taste good.
Just in case anyone's reading this before making salsa, you USE GLOVES because the only other way to get hot pepper oils off your hand seems to be degloving it. So I hope I saved you from a day of agony whenever you accidentally touch your face.
You're fucking amazing. The recipes from films and TV was such a fantastic idea and I really wanted you to start a series and explain other elements of cooking, this is perfect. I can see this channel going on to some amazing things.
Killing it man. Loving the expansion of your domain. Keep it going!
Make Steven universe food!!!🌟
good work on #45 in trending!
Is there a substitute to red wine I can't have any due to my religion but I wish to try it
Make Mole from Chocolat!!!
Always remember for the Salsa to use a special word with the initials of the ingredients, like RGOGSH
Your hatred of cilantro is genetic, some people have it and cilantro tastes like soap to them. \n\nTo me horseradish and wasabi taste like burning plastic.
Intro song is a bit busy
You hate Cilantro too? I've read that hatred for Cilantro/Coriander is a genetic thing—there's studies where they found that if one twin hates it, the other will too. \nWhat do you do when you come across recipes that call for it? Do you replace it, omit it, or just force yourself to stomach it?
THE TING GOES SKKKKRRRRAAAA
Can’t believe he had the audacity to mention knife skills after watching him cut like a 5 year old.
I really appreciate the knife skills tutorials. Great episode, Boss.
How much Macaroni?
Hi! You're probably never see this comment, but you never know so here goes- I just discovered your YouTube channel approximately 17 minutes ago. I can't stop watching your videos, they are amazing, informative, and funny (in a good way obviously). I am an aspiring pastry chef with one more semester of school to go. I also have interest in the Savory side of the culinary world, so your videos are very helpful. Keep up the good work!
So relieved to learn there's another out there that hates cilantro as much as I do.
Way concise. Thanks for your take Dr.
I cant wait til your holiday vids
Are you a tits or an ass man?
Binging with Babish is just Food VSauce
raw sauce
You should make a McDonald’s McGriddle
Is it just my screen or does the red keep appearing yellow in some shots?
Cilantro gross?  everyone has a dislike on something not terrible. Where you kinda lost it was at wearing gloves to slice the pepper, it gets hot a bit the first times but you build up resistance. Great video.
Hey Andrew, I'd like to see a technique video on 'temperatures.' As in, how hot to have the stovetop for particular dishes, when to reduce heat, when to have high, when to have medium high, low, simmer, so on and so forth. Could also toss in oven temps, and why you would cook say chicken at one temp, beef at another, veggies, you get it. One thing I struggle with in the kitchen is how hot that pan actually should be!
These are the greatest instructional videos!
am i the only one who thinks that mango looks like an avocado?
Instantly my favorite cook tutor
This is the greatest series to ever hit YouTube. Bless you.
#13 on trending !
7 months, gone
I found your videos and loved them but now I'm learning how to be a better cook thank you
love your video, it was very instructive
Butter in sugo?
Just tried making your Mac and cheese recipe and oh boy was it tasty. I used fairly cheap ingredients for a trial run too so next time when I use fresh shredded cheese I'm sure it will be even better. Thanks! I started cooking more seriously because of your channel.
Give me a recipe for four fried chickens and a coke, and dry white toast.
What brand are the bowls and plates you used for serving?
word of advice on cutting round objects (mango, carrots, etc) - cut a small slice off the bottom edge to give you a steady surface to cut on so the produce won't roll around and you don't end up cutting yourself
I thought you didn't include garnishes that were not meant to be eaten, like raw herbs.
is the mango suppose to not be ripe ?
I feel dizzy watching this. I dripped drool onto my shirt. I'm leaving it there to remind me to make that mac & cheese for dinner tonight.
all good, but the way you chop peppers is very wrong. you should check gordon ramsay how to chop bell peppers video it is efficient and simple
Dude I love your content you make the best videos.
it was so wild watching your voice come out of your face it was like talking to god for the first time
I am really looking forward to this series of videos on basics, I found the brief lesson on chopping to be the most helpful :)
Hey, Babish, i have a little tip for a killing bechamel sauce, try adding a hint of nutmeg as seasoning, it is FANTASTIC!!! (for me it solves the rather bland taste of the sauce)
the livestream is at 2am were i live
Pls make H-white cake from django !
Take notes Gordon Ramsay.
The true sauce boss.
Bechamel is the southern mans cooking foundation! If you build it, they will come :)
What kind of knife do you use?
He should make Rachel's English trifle from friends
It’s like he made the salsa just for me. I love mango!! ❤️❤️❤️
If Gordon Ramsey Was There:\n*WHERE IS THE GOD DAMN LAMB SAUCE?!?!*

I finally found a YouTuber who is just as weird as me

Horse face at it again with her fuckery
Constant references to whites being stupid and racist.....makes you racist...constant remarks acting like men are idiots at cooking, but like most things men are better at that too...even make-up and doing hair men are better...that makes you sexist. Basically you are a racist sexist bitch.

LIZA I GET SOOOO HYPED WHEN I SEE YOUR NEW VID EVERY WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY/FRIDAY😂❤️
HAHAHA look at Liza at 1:35 it's sooooo funny😂😂😂😂😂
more more more!
big Louis CK fan, even bigger Woody Allen fan. sure the film looks Woody Allen-esque, but still looks like a great movie. can not wait to watch!
Wait wait wait.  I'm a pervert, you're a pervert we're all perverts. If that was true then the word pervert wouldn't exist. But it dose. Which means there are those who abuse sex. PERVERTS.
This is fucked up... if you can't see why then I have news for you
Looks like it’s trying to be retro and modern at the same time
I thought this was an SNL skit at first
China's a minor\nA minor at what\n\nhahahhahaha
Smh... Hollywood is nothing but a cesspool made up to look like the fountain of youth.
where is the colors
Why is that dark haired lady in basically everything Louis CK does. She's annoying.
It's saying something that even Louis CK, Charlie Day, and Chloe Grace Moretz saying daddy isn't enough to make me want to watch this.
It's like a drama channel movie lol no thanks
I KNOW, SHE'S GORGEOUS.
What the hell is this?
This almost has a Woody Allen feel to it.
Mainstream condoning paedophilia plus copied all the style from Woody Allen... get out!
Louis accidentally made a Woody Allen
chloe grace moretz is a combination of untalented and hideous.
Am I the only one who is loving this? Like very intently?😜
The acting looks so bad aghh
*Is this a real film or a joke?*
This looks like shit
Chloe Grace Moretz killed it for me.
oooooooooooooo
....Ew.
Uhhhhh wtf
Looks ass. :(
Daddy Bear
Hollywood Pedophilia: The Movie
Why black&white
Harvey Weinstein and Woody Allen much?
This looks shit
Watch this trailer because of the title, i'm not going to lie........daddy actually means daddy :/
Lets be honest we are only here to see her in a bikini.
Can I masturbate to this?
Is that Chloe Moretz ?\nDamn look old so fast.
If my kid dated an older and successful person, I don't know if I would get upset or happy that I know that they will be taking care of.
Came here just to here Chloe say fist me daddy
Is that Cirus the Virus?
Am I the only one liking the black a white film look
This reminds of the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's Daddy's boy for obvious reasons
If it wasn't for the Weinstein shit, this movie wouldn't be getting half the backlash it's receiving. CK is the victim of poor timing.
......so is this about weintstein or some one like weinstein
This looks like a porno
Is the movie gonna be in black and white because I’m not here for that
A young girl wants to date an older man and her father disapproves. Originality at its finest.
Why does this seem like a massive disturbing porn build up
hope someone comes forward about him.
Wait what even is what what
Okay... That, was disturbing for TOO MANY reasons.
The beginning had me.. then the rest lost me xd
None of that is my fault, you divorced me when I was a loser so you lost\nLMFAO [XXXP]
Why is it black and white, but still modern? It bothers me
Manhattan 2: This Time It's Personal
That one weird movie that keeps on winning film-festivals.
what a bullshit, I even watched trailer bcoz of Chloe.
Is the whole thing in black and white?
Woodie Allen's next of kin
I'm a C.K. fan,  but I can't help but to feel creeped out by this movie.
I hate that its black and white
Looks interesting but the trailer confused me
This movie will be weird.
look cool and all but I'm not gonna sit for over an hour pretending to never heard of Technicolor
What is the plot of the film?
Chole moretz is not a good actor!!!! There i said it!!!!
i love you daddy sound  wronge out of context
Did I see Charlie on the couch? Awesome!
I think this movie was directed by Lana del Rey
Do the roar, I love you daddy.
what is the song in the end ?
This seems like a skit parody trailer
So what is his movie about ?
That's one way to be tone deaf
Charlie day is in this dam love that guy, Horrible bosses and Always Sunny in Philidelphia
This is just another pedophile joke from LCK, I guess the more he makes pedophillia mainstream the easier it will be when he's finally busted.\n\nEdit: this is the third time I have made this comment, it mysteriously keeps disappearing. I will be back every day to ensure it stays , or type it again and again until the comments are not allowed.
I'm so confused
we all know we clicked for the thumbnail.
This has a 1% chance of being an original arthouse cult classic? But if not its probabaly just going to be a really gross dumb film.
hi
A
Ew
wtf is this
Harvey Weinstein: The Movie
Black and white really motherfuvker?
Pedophile watch
Ummmmm start of a pron?
WTF !!
Produced by Harvey Weinstein!
wow!
This confuses me
Normalize
wtf did I just watch ?
Scary me out
Huh
Well this looks shit
what great timing
This shit looks fucked
Filth
Esto es un chiste, verdad?
It makes me happy and more comfortable with my body when I see actresses with a normal weight and are not underweight, I don’t know just Chloe’s body makes me happy
The black and white doesn’t suit this
if you are offended by this then fuck off you sensitive faggots
Been a while since faggot was a homophobic slur.
So what fuck u I don't like McGregor but nothing wrong with that
You are a pussy
whoever gets offended by this is a faggot
SJW's don't try to ruin this sport like you ruin everything else yah faggots
How dare a cage-fighter use a homophobic slur!!  What is the world coming to?
a Faggot is a type of food. so it's ok to punch someone in the face or choke them unconcious but god forbid you use the word faggot. Get the fuck outta here
Who gives a fuck? Seriously. More importantly, this video lasted 13 secs like Aldo.
I really don't think anyone gives a fuck
It's very simple. When you say you cocksucker you faggot maricon, you're just calling a guy an asshole, and SJWs can stick it up their ass calling those people homophobes. However, Conor said He's a faggot. I never knew he's a faggot. THAT's homophobia, so fuck Conor the homophobe faggot cocksucker maricon. I guarantee Conor is probably gay or bi and a self hating gay at that, how the fuck you show up at weigh ins in your panties with another guy in his panties, surruounded by a bunch of men and have an erection. My dick would refuse to show up at this scenario, he's like catch ya later you faggot, call me when theres women around.
You're a faggot Nick Baldwin
Who gives a fuck? Homo's get over yourselves.
Faggoty Fagging Faggots.
Well, now we know Nick Baldwin's a faggot.
You can call someone a bitch or a cunt, and that's OK, but don't call them a faggot. The west is a bunch of cucks. Soon countries like China, Russia and India will control the world. There people work their asses off and don't curl up in a corner if someone says a bad word.
So? Stop being a faggot.
This is a sport where the objective is to psychically hurt your opponent and people are making a big deal about a naughty word? Fuck off.
People in todays PC world are far too easily offended .. With so many restrictions on what to say , is there really freedom of speech at all ?
It seems to me that Connor has been drinking a lot whilst having time off...he will loose his next fight and the belt
WHO GIVES A FUCK!
faggot as in limp-wristed sweaty palm dead fish handshaking weak ass bitch, like calling someone's car gay, woopty fuck, let me know when he calls a gay person a faggot, or is andre fili gay? remember when mayweather called conor a faggot and no one really gave a fuck? anyway bad habit to say it, but he picked it up from mayweather lol
Sensitive pathetic little people complaining.\nWho the fuck cares.\nGo get a hobby or a life.
who gives a fuck
Faggot is to God a word to be stolen from us ... I will never give it up faggots
thats our 'word', so we can use it - mcfaggot\n\nlol
I think it's a reference to the amount of take downs he was doing... not insulting homosexuality.
If you're offended by this you're a complete faggot.
The response to this video in the comment section gives me hope :)
I can't hear shit
TMZ is owned by a faggot.  Im sure they will capitalize on this.\n\nIn another note, crackaz are the most despicable scumbags on earth
He's showing his white trash roots. he was just butthurt that his bumchum got whipped lol\nLobov was still staggering
Pls don't get offended by a faggot using the word faggot.
It's funny because he's holding Artem so close to him hahahaha while using this word. Ppl need to chill, it's just a f*cking word.
oh what a bunch of fucking faggots. let the guy say whatever he wants, especially in backstage
any faggot offended by the word faggot is really a faggot
I don't care that he used the word faggot, I just find it funny that he had the audacity to call Fili that because he was whooping Artem's ass. McGregor has proven once again how much of a sore loser he is.
WHO THE FUCK CARES!!! FUCK all you whiney little faggots, keep crying.
holy fuck now the left-wing beta cuck virgins are going to ruin Conor's career over him using the word faggot?\nWho gives a fuck ?!\nGood that he said that!, LGBT are all filthy degenerate sodomites that are trying to break out Traditonal White Christian Society.\nR.W.D.S FUCKING WHEN ?!!!!!\nAlso HEIL HITLER!\ndid that trigger you faggots?
Bro, the hyper-sensitive pc sjw shit was so pre-November 2016. This is a new America you faggots. MAGA!
Loyalty... Conor is ride or die
A lot of meatheads in the comment section.
Any man that's willing to roll on a mat half naked with another man for 3-5 rounds is a faggot..So even Connor is a...
McGregor seems well informed! Has he been doing his doing his research on his Grinder account?
fucking idiots, around the UK and ireland calling someone a faggot means you're calling them a bitch/pussy
Yall are Faggots if you find this offensive
Who gives a shit? This is how people talk with their friends. It's always been this way. Only now people are oversensitive faggots.
So are we going to report every person who uses the word faggot at a UFC match? or just people with a bank roll... What a bunch of sissy ass little children, quit looking to be offended and just watch the damned fight already.
Oh shut the fuck up and everybody stop being so sensitive!!
If this offends you, you're probably a faggot
Conor was clearly shit faced and it wasn't meant in that context. I can't believe we honestly have to go over this.
What you can’t say the f word no more? How about we say what the hell we like.
SJWs are faggots
He says maggot not faggit
Omg words hurt so much these days. Fucking pussies everywhere
Maricon - Conor McGregor
A bunch of slackjawed faggots...
Fenian faggot!
Disgusting behavior by Conor. What a faggot
Haha
lol
And???
So he said faggot, boo-fucking-hoo.

Who fucking cares... Stop your fucking crying.
mcnuthuggers are up in arms ready to defend their lord haha
I'm Welsh. A faggot is a mix of bad meats and breadcrumbs, not a fighter, so  if you re-appropriate my cultural term; I'll be offended, and who else has the right to be?
Damn I remember the good ol days when everyone wasn't offended by everything.
If your a liberal PC faggot don't watch UFC youre going to ruin it just like you did the NFL
I use fagot the whole time, it's not that bad in the British Isles.
Whiteys are bastards!!! Stop saying the f-word its offensive and homophobic
Fucking nigger fagot what is the problem with that...
faggot also means a bundle of sticks bound together as fuel , this is what mcgregor can use to defend himself against the sjws and snowflake generation !!!!!
Yeah what about when Floyd called Conor a faggot at the London press conference. Who gives a flying fuck that somebody said some word to someone?
i love it we're seeing the TRUE Paper champion as he really is, a bigot, homophobic no good useless tit,  a guy who holds belts but is too afraid to defend them because then there's risk of losing. I hope he gets crucified for this, he's a shitty individual who has no respect for anyone else but himself, for a guy who came from the dirt streets, he sure as fuck forgot where he came from .. now he's a McCuck. I just started reading all these McNuthugger comments saying that what he said wasnt a slur ..haha of course not, he's your idol lmao .. might want to find a better class of individual because that guy you worship so, wouldnt cross the street to piss on you if you were on fire, one of the most fake people in the UFC.
HELLO FRIENDS!!! hope u guys enjoy this adventure into 80s fashion! who's ready for 77? lmao
Tyler must have ran so far away when saf told him that hair idea.
can you do a day or a weak, where you wear mens clothes?
saf can post any video and i'll still be watching it
When I first saw Tyler's hair I thought he was supposed to be an 80s Wolverine
i am absolutely in love with every aspect of the third outfit, especially the hair
Okay but why do you look like Winona Ryder in the 80s. It's uncanny lol
WERE GOING TO THE MALL!!
anybody get sandy from grease (when singing you're the one that i want) vibes from the first outfit?
quality and entertaining content :)
Example of the perfect woman......
You look like an extra from San Junipero :)
Thank you for a great effort to re-create the fashions of my youth. You deserve a Trapper Keeper!
These videos are so unique. The history lesson done in a very interesting way tied in with an entertaining video about clothes from a different time period. Saf you are rocking it as much as you were rocking that hair 🖤
She looks like Veronica from Heather's in the second outfit. I love it.
THE SECOND LOOK I ALMOST SCREAMED CAUSE SHE LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE VERONICA FROM HEATHERS AND THEN SHE SHOWED THE COVER I UGH JUST UGH
I was born in 1987! Ugh, I'm old. I remember my mom wearing the shoulder pads and almond toed shoes well into the 90s. Also, she had a perm more than once.
Tyler looks like astro boy with that hair style
Heathers was the first thing that came to my mind
I loved this video! Great job Safiya!
Okay but the business outfit is actually super cute ❤️
My son thought your office outfit was me... I dress like that to work and my hair is naturally curly like that 😂😂
The second look makes you look like Veronica Sawyer and I love it!!!!!!!!
I could totally see that 1st outfit in today, just without the hair, gloves, and some different jewlery
I never regret clicking and watching every videos of yours! love every one of them and you you look gorgeous!! keep your channel growing and LOVE you saf 😘😘😘
Can you please say where you bought your clothes from
I am so excited to see the 70's!
I love that acid wash bag! Where is it from? ❤
Make a video of you buying slime off etsy!!!
Go back to buzzfeed. You do the same thing now that you did before.
No, this is some of dat gay shit. Ya know what I'm saying girl. Hail the Confederacy
Until you said Tyler's hair was flock of seagulls, I thought he was going for a x man wolverine look
Hey Saf, you should check out the newer comic Paper Girls. The fashion is amazing and it takes place in 1988. Also, the writing and art are both incredible.
Great video! 👍 Cracked up when Tyler walked in. Awesome job again
Don’t forget about Brendon Urie!! Brendon Urie was born in 1987!!
I loved being a teen in the 80s.  Thanks for the flashback.  You nailed it.
she is so fun to watch and she knows her history fairly well.
Let's try to make the shoulder pads happen!!
2nd outfit you look like Veronica Sawyer from Heathers!
Very informative and fun!
I really enjoy these videos. All your research is so fun to see!
Loved this! 80s can you please make a comeback so I can enjoy you? Ok thanks.👌😂💜
I feel like these outfits were just various incarnations of Winona Ryder. Just one big Winona tribute (aka 1987)
I was 15 in 1987 living in Southern California.  Most people couldn't afford that leather outfit and it wasn't worn by many people.  It's more of a characterization.  Denim outfit was pretty close.  The off-colored patches in the acid wash were off.  And, most girls choose to rock big hair rather than wear hats.  Hats were worn by the mildly socially awkward, those more easily influenced by the 80s movie's interpretation of 80s style.    Your boyfriend's flock of seagulls hair style was about 5 years too old in 1987 and not many males wore it when it was popular.  Again, more of a characterization of 80s styles.  The metal hair was very spot on!!!  However, there were much better peacock style of feathering to the side, which was more preppy.  Some girls really had it going on.  Metal girls often had sloppy big hair.
I was an 80s teen and loved this nostalgic trip.  You really nailed the looks!  Loved it.
the second outfit felt very veronica sawyer if it were blue
Are you just going to add 7 to every year
If I had seen you in that acid washed outfit and the hat, I might have done a double-take and said, Wait, what? Is that... Debbie Gibson? LOL Great fun with these looks! Very nice vid!
That first outfit makes you look like one of Uncle Jesse’s girlfriends on Full House! 😂
I'm lowkey wanting her to do it but with 1910 or 1920 fashion 😂😂 please
She looks like the mom from stranger things
Go to any online shop and order the first thing from each category.. I think that’d be fun
4:53 I didn't know Saf is secretly Heather Chandler
i would wear the heck out of that last outfit.
Okay but is that you in that icebreakers commercial seriously
Why do I love all three of those outfits lol
If you say ok Google, what should I where? She will give you a whole outfit to try. I think this could be a really fun and cool video!
Where are all the How I Met Your Mother fans?
this is so so so fantastic you did such an amazing job, the information, the research, outfits, and not to mention you look so good
Safiya is such a good bean.
Safiya is slayin' all of those outfits! Who else fell in love with number 2 ?
And once again you make these outfits look flawless, as per usual♥️😂
I'm really excited for '67! Please go there.
This is not my motorcycle, but it could be!
What did you do to tyler 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The girl at 6:28 looks like saf .. SOMEONE EXPLAIN!.
The first look is exactly like what my mom wore when she was 16 😂😂
Omg with the second outfit she looked exactly like the girl from Heathers
Saf’s third outfit she looks REALL GOOD WITH BANGS and her earrings and hat and whole upper body look is giving me Selena Vibes🌹
Bring back the 80s please!
Yay the year I was born! Good job nailing it even though it is all cringe worthy! Lol

Just got to ask how much did you pay to get on the trending page with only just 4K views? I was thinking about doing it myself k cheers thanks bye
The biggest organ is your skin
I can't look at a mouse anymore as I always seen a kidney...

Factual error : It's true that auditory bones help in hearing but balance is maintained by the semicircular canals in the inner ear.
Poor baby at the end😂
Why are the guys nips censored in the thumbnail?
is this video aimed at people who never been inside a biology class . geez
It's soo amazing how they classified drugs being different from alcohol :P
U ever have to poop and u get a dizzy headache
So if the liver is so good at regenerating itself, why do people get diabetes?
Ugh. Channels like vox and this have well researched content, but they are way too politically correct.
Why wouldnt you be able to balance?  The tiny ear bones are only part of the sound transmission part of the ear, not the balance.    The Auditory and Vestibular systems in the ear are separate.
Your hair is the second fastest-growing part of your body\nOh I know which one is the first ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

My science teacher told me the reason poop is brown is because of dead red blood cells. So yah

Why are the guys nipples blurred out too lol
why do you block the nips of the guy?!
This is such bs😂
Why is this exactly what u need to know for gcse biology
We all know why this is trending.
0:22 The ossicles of the ear are NOT part of the vestibular system, and so have nothing to do with balance.

Why are we fascinated with our own body?
Why are people so triggered about a man's nipples being censored..? It's either censor both or censor none
Did he just say guys hair grows faster? I thought the reason girls have long hare is it grows faster
Can you make a video about Hereditary Spherocytosis?
I want part 3 very soon! You just killed it man!

Why did you censor man Nipple in the Thumbnail
Salamander Man does not approve the thumbnail.
Allah created the human body and creates everything
Get to the genitals please!
Why are the nipples censored? But just the male's but the female's as well
I’m deaf so I have to read the captions.\n\nCan you guys describe the guy’s voice?
do people who are obese have more blood than people who weigh less (7% of body weight) or does their blood weigh more?
WTF is that thumbnail and if you liked it I have no words
Why did they censor the guy's nipples on the thumbnail?
The thumbnail is creepy
My hair grows way faster than 6 inches a year. I constantly change up hair styles from long to short because my hair grows around an inch a month.
Why is the male chest censored? Stupid SJWs
And here we are, destroying our bodies with food that are junk.

Fuck Beverley!!!! Lonzo just played ball and this big mouth BIIIIIIIYATCH kept on running his fucking mouth while Lonzo just ignores him. Typical bully mentallity from a no name CLOWN! Beverley Beaverly whatever the fuck your name is Fuck YOU, BITCH!!!!!
Black people.....
Black People play dirty.
he said ..my shit....and all you daddy haters that would sit back and let these vampires stick their fangs in ur kids...ya blind to the fact.....
Did anyone notice Lonzo wasn't reacting to any of Beverly's insults? Good job Lonzo, and then next game Lonzo gets 29 points and almost a triple double :)
Clippers look like a deeper team this year, not bad.
2:50 “I guess everyone that said that ugly jumper... yeah it’s ugly!”  LMAO
Like lavar said, Beverly better enjoy his only interview of the year
He clearly said “gimme dat shit” when he took the ball lmmfao
This is how bball should be played. Fuck all that buddy buddy hugs n kisses soft shit
iT LOOKD HE SAID TO BALL yOU PLAY LIKE S&^5
I hate this video because why would he talk that way to a kid anyway
@1:05\nBeverly already flopping? Come on now...he didn't push you that damn hard.
Patrick Beverly always be trying light skin dudes Lonzo is a better person than me cause i would of played patricks game of playing dirty right back i would of pretended to fall into him then i would of bit a chunk of his flesh clean off so he sees his own fucking blood and comes at me, give him something he will never forget! then see if he ever does that shit again.
He clearly did not say bitch
They call that 'cookies' where I'm from
It takes away your grip...
Will he go down in NBA history as one of the worst top drafts? We will see.....
Patrick shouldn’t even be talkin he’s the one that tried to block a free throw 😂
Balance this: Lakers will probably not make the playoffs vs. Clippers go fishing after the first round.
this was funny but dude got poise he’s his own man
Damn my bruh it's just one game and the nigga getting trashed by a lot of people who gone be on his dick later on in the season that's the funny shit to me.😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lonzo going to get picked on a lot all because the mouth of his farther...
he needs some swagg...he'll be fine... Kobe had Grace. Basketball is an art.
Beverly did it for Nas 😢
notice how Lonzo is being hated for things he never said.
Patrick is such a pussy, I woulda put my foot behind him and pushed him so he trips on himself like a retard
Glad rockets got that annoying mosquito out of Houston
Patrick beverly coonin....
He crossed one leg bruh
We need more trash talkers.
Snowflake lonzo at work :-)
How come Lakers havent retired Derick  Fishers jersey?
Zo2 les' t do
fuck ball he sucks
Lonzo you pussy ass half breed do something lol ...
I hate players like beberley, they stay acting cocky
Lonzo dad his making his career a nightmare
I have a presentiment Lonzo is going to be injured this season... (Btw not a hater)
If every guard shows no respect to ball like Beverly, he's gonna be out of the league very soon. Shove the guy a few times every game. Break his confidence.
The way mfs hate lonzo smh Passion and Christ need a sequel
You guys all acting like this is actual beef. Did you never play basketball with people who play like this every game? It's just how they play and get themselves going.
knowin how much beverly is a cheap shot artist.....he will try to injure lonzo ball next time they play...thats what he does....thats all he does.....hes a chump.
If I was lonzo I would knock Patrick Beverly out. That's why Houston don't need him.
Beverly is one of those nigggas that you absolutely hate when your playing against him but love when he’s on your team
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Best bounce back of all time probably, like a big FUCK YOU to all the haters lmao
Lonzo thinking fuck wish I was a lawyer
Y’all chill on Lonzo I’m not a fan of him but he got sum serious talent this was his first game against the best defender at the point guard position in the league I expected nun less from pat he locked him up like he should’ve
Just look at lamelo everybody hates lamelo because his dad boosted there intelligents
Dude needs to put on some weight he has talent but he has no weight to throw. So going inside the paint isnt a really good idea
Lonzo is not ready for this these are grown men competing.
One thing is defense and another thing is this fucking clown with his cracker face fuck beverly...
Beverley is the type of dude to play street ball just to foul.
lonzo 2nd game, 1 assist away from a 29point triple double.  that alone surpasses anything beverly has done his entire career.
That shot form though....
uh the ref got in the way
lonzo need to hit the weight room asap, looking like a child out there playing with grown men
another case of a dark skin nigga hating on a light nigga
He is too old and too black... to talk to lonzo like that... lonzo is like 19 wtf dude
if beverley can do this... irving gonna F this kid up.. cant wait
Then dropped 29, 11, and 9 on they ass 😂
there is a difference between playing physical and playing dirty.  I grew up playing the game physically, but I never had guys actually trying to hurt me.  i don't like players like beverly as they actually try to hurt players.  I guarantee you if beverly hurts another superstar, he will be out of the league.  This league is about money first and the league can't afford to have scrub players like beverly trying to make a name for themselves off of injuring superstar players.
Why is nobody throwing shade at Beverley? That dude's acting like he's hot shit, when in reality, this video is probably the most relevant he has ever been in his entire NBA career.
Why did everyone expect lonzo to come in the nba like another stephen curry lonzo just getting started he humble now with answering the question but down the road his interviews he going be asking them questions and playing more aggressive
Don't trip lonzo ball that fool beverly just a hater that your gonna be a light skin star while he in the ghetto.
Looked like the true bitch was Beverley. Can't control your emotions where the kid did tells all you need to know.
Patrick Beverly needs to shut his nappy head up, he’s trash
Add me as a contact on YouTube. https://youtu.be/addme/8Rijzk3TzUQy_ZgWsAiElby-Ee_32Q
That's an obviously misleading title. Kept waiting for an altercation, but alI I got was lame highlights from two shit teams and a little bit of jawjacking. From your channel, I assumed you were fairly well versed in the game of basketball, but it seems something may have eluded you. Trash talk happens (and is in fact integral) in every NBA, NCAA, pickup, Hoop it up, or chickball game. Beverly gets under everyone's skin; he's a relentlessly annoying slap-happy defender that everyone hates but would love to have on their team. I saw the title of the clip and assumed he riled up the hotshot known more from his blowhard loudmouth dad than his abilities and some shit went down. Pretty blatant false advertising, amigo.\n\nWhatever. Just maybe next time put some shit like Battle of LA: Lakers-Clippers highlights. Otherwise, people like me, and I'm sure I'm far from the only one, might just come to associate your channel with sensationalist clickbait garbage and eschew it altogether.\n\nJust a little non-confrontational constructive criticism for you. Feel free to tell me to go fuck myself now.
Beverly is a classy guy. Grant Hill like
Fuck you're black ass Patrick player
Of course they're gonna be rough on the rookie! They wanna see what he's got! He'll be a better player because of it. People in the comments are soft lmao
Lakers should trade for Patrick Beverley.. If Lonzo had his presence everyday at practice it would definitely speed up his development.
After watching this, I realise how shit basketball is. What a bore fest, you in America really don't do good sports lmao
Y'all remember when Rudy Gay bodied beverley?
my man wheelchair jimmy
Beverly is trash
Lonzo is over hyped.. he garbage
Lonzo should've been like.  Nigger
Sit the FUCK down bich
This kid ass who in dafuq draft him
Sorry Fuck
WOW That was crazy..not.
Lol Patrick Beverly highlights
There's a bunch of mf on here with no dads so they hate on lavar because they have no fucken clue what it's like to have a supportive father...haha...fucken losers hating on a dad for believing in his son....you bastards!..lol...when you sorry ass mf have kids just be that weak as dad that you want lavar to be
my nigga Patrick expose that nigga
magic johnson is going to regret he let go of Dangelo Russel. he is like larry bird, a fucking stupid team president.
both these players r retarded, but beverly look like a fuckin middle aged crack head.
Pat is a good defender but he needs to chill tf out on zo damn what a dick
Beverly was the perfect person for Lonzo to play because he's one of the more aggressive pgs' in the league. Hopefully he realizes this is where the big boys play and can adjust. ...oh yeah the nigga dropped 30, 11, and 9 on the suns last night!!
I coulda got more done than that and im 5 9
Got eeem!
zo crossed the shit out this garbage ass nigga😹
Lonzo's defense is horrible!
Weak ass intro stop that shit
Chris Webber is annoying af bruh. Stfu
Beverley pussy frfr
Good unbiased
Lonzo not gone fare well against the Darkskin niggas in the league 😂😂😂😭💪🏾💯they savages
if he cant do good against beverly hes gonna be crying against lebron 🤣🤣
Since us Americans are too dumb to know what Philosopher's Stone means, I'll rename all the titles.\nHarry Potter and The Secret Room With The Evil Snake\nHarry Potter and The Guy From Jail\nHarry Potter and The Hot Cup\nHarry Potter and The Bird Club\nHarry Potter and The Guy With Only One Magical Parent\nHarry Potter and Death
I think thestrals will have something to do with how they get there
Flannel and Dumbledore were gey together and they got married on a unicorn
Seamus looks so small compared to the brothers
Why wasn't it ever called the Alchemists Stone? It's even cooler cause it's accurate!
um... you guys are way over thinking this. Albus' Frog Card says he worked with Flamel about the 12 uses of dragons blood... dragons which are fantastic beasts... and sorta up Newt's alley. Also, in the books, the stone has no color, the movies colored it red so it showed up well against the dark robes and grey back grounds equally. \n\nGood Colab tho.
I think I know how Dombeldor gets the elder wand. Dombeldor needs the stone for the dule. Grindawold uses the killing curse on him. Has turns around Dombeldor dis-arms him and gets the elder wand. Let no what you think. PS I know I made a few spelling mistakes.
Actually it is called the philosopher's stone
I love Seamus! So happy to see him on SuperCarlin! 😄
Hey brother(s)! ...Sorry you probably hear that alot. But I have a theory idea from the live action beauty and the beast: When belle is in the west wing the portrait we are shown the princes family. His mothers face is untouched while he has destroyed his own and his fathers. Mrs Potts says his father took a sweet lad and twisted him up.... just like him.What happened to the prince? He clearly has attachment and trust issues; and in alot of ways he is still a child. \nCould you look into the beats childhood? What happened after his mother died?I love your videos. <3
4:27 this turned me on. Anyone else or is it just me
Dumbledore does do a perfect breaststroke, but i was thinking more about forks
I like this theory, but my gut reaction is that you have it the wrong way around. You don't need to use a phoenix to make a Philosopher's stone, you need to use a Philosopher's stone to make a phoenix
ben hate to break it to you but everywhere but america calls it the philosopher's stone, deal with it dude
How the stone was made? Countless amounts of human souls, that's how.
ironiclly, I still have no idea HOW the stone was created...
... there's also the fact that Dumbledore found the 12 uses of Dragon blood
Where my Hufflepuff’s at ?!\n💛💛💛💛💛💛
If Dumbledore helped make the sorcerer's stone, would he have donated phoenix feathers again or something? Cuz phoenixes are basically immortal and just rise from their own ashes
ok ok ok interesting i like your idea also i found this Hagrid says in the book that he never thought he'd live to see the Triwizard Tournament played again. However, the Tournament was supposed to be cancelled in 1792. This can be assumed to be another unsuccessful attempt to resurrect it.I found this on the wiki page and i then searched up when Hagrid was born, 1928 so that means somewhere between 1927 and 1944 there was a failed tournament.This leads me to think of two possibilities one the 1927 tournament went somewhat well and in five years or so they held another but it failed and they stopped hosting them or my second thought which would make much more sense for the movie Grindelwald attacks or sabotages the tournament and it is cancelled and then they never host it while Grindelwald is in power. now 1945 Grindelwald is imprisoned and the wizarding community says hurrah now we can celebrate so they host another but this time something goes wrong accidentally or it is sabotaged (secretly) by Tom Riddle now with a split soul as the wikipedia states ,The First Wizarding War[1] was a major conflict with foundations as early as the 1940s, and true indeed 1945 is in the 1940s. Anyway thats just some food for thought thanks for taking the time to read this.I wish you a good day a good week a good year and a good life.Byeeee
Me : Looks at date for this video published - Wait, where addressing this first Harry Potter movie in 2017?
Why do Hufflepuffs get so much hate yes they can be idiots from time to time but being a ravenclaw I teach my hufflepuff friends things all the time in the beginning they had problems but not any more not all hufflepuffs are idiots just the ones who act before they think.
The Philosopher's Stone is made from magic.\nJK\n\n\n\n\nRowling
I was DYING to watch this collab and now it happened!! Oh my goodness!!
Now we need a collab with Seamus Ben/jay and thebakeey
He used magic? I figured it was pretty self explanatory.
You guys should be on Film Theory
I have a very sad explanation of how a PHILOSOPHER's stone is made, and that is by the death of a phoenix.That is, if ever any phoenix actually dies, it burns and the ashes become a stone.
Uhh.... Hogwarts train? Apparating? Port Key? I have no idea
Shame it was so scripted as made the 'jokes' appear forced and therefore I kept getting distracted by it instead of being able to focus on the points you were making.
Who da fuck took the S of maths what was the point
Not gonna lie, I thought the thumbnail was a sparkly liver at first
I have a theory that the inferi army were made by dementors who sucked the souls out of muggles on voldemort's orders (already known they were muggles who were kidnapped)... haven't actually looked into it but popped into my head when I watched the half-blood prince :) Also, hypothetically, me and my friends pondered what would have happened if harry received a dementors kiss in prisoner of azkaban, would they have sucked out voldemorts soul, or his own and voldemorts soul took over his body, or both. Fun stuff!
Oi silly American start pronouncing it correctly.\nSorry just had to say that.
Okay I love all the British vs American things in this video😂 I love both of these people, this is an amazing collab. Also distance plunging.
I liked the book series Nicholas Flamel as in like the one with the twins and the learn the four elemental magics
Thersals and to the people we look like we're floating
Quick question, how could Nicolas Flamel have attended Beauxbatons? I thought it was a female school in the same way Durmstrang is a male school, with Hogwarts being the odd one out by being co-ed.
Im gonna make the obvious joke\n\n\n\n\n\nThe philosophers stone is made from human souls!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWow i feel bad for doing that. I didnt even watch the video
Obviously Hogwarts would travel in the Thestral carriages?? I mean Thestrals can fly so it makes sense to use them for long distance travel...I imagine it would also look kinda impressive to the other competing schools to see these apparently horseless carriages just dropping out of the sky :P
What about Dumbledore's dragon blood discoveries? That might relate to Dumbledore, Flamel, and Newt!
Okay okay, wasn't Beaubaxton a girls school though?!
I think Hogwarts would either\n\n1. Bewitch the train like you said.\n2. Ride on/ride in something pulled by thestrals\n3. If there’s water then something pulled by the giant squid
Another theory is the pheonix is in the Harry and Voldemorts wand. Therefore is about making the wands
7:04 what is this, a child show?
All Hufflepuffs cringe in the first three minutes!
Oh my god... I thought it was the only person that says nobody says po-TAH-to
This was wonderful, even though I couldn't keep up with the maths (any of them). 😂 Love to see Seamus do a collaboration with you as well!
Leviticus 19:31\nRegard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.\n\n\nDeuteronomy 18:10 \nThere shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch.\n\n11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.\n\n12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord: and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.\n\nExodus 22:18 \nThou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
From the blood of muggles...
Don't watch this. Go watch Full Metal Alchemist.
Everyone knows, the stones were created from people during the Ishbalan civil war
They would obviosly use the thestral carige (sorry for spelling)
I know nothing about Harry Potter but I watched this lol
I say, a fleet of brooms.
JK Rowling changed it to sorcerer because the word philosopher doesn't sound magical to American English speakers.
Transmutation circle and many human sacrifices that’s how
I wonder if there will be anything about Dumbledore finding the uses for dragons blood in this movie. Like somehow a dragon gets injured, Newt helps to heal it, and Dumbledore bottles some to experiment on. Humane, and would explain that he didn't abuse dragons to get the blood for research, while still tying in the theme of Fantastic Beasts.
Only a Hufflepuff would have his house insulted and reply with a polite copliment :)\nSeamus is awesome <3
im a american and i say philosipher stone
Maybe the Stone is a Phoenix egg?
This was uploaded on my birthday!!!!
i kinda like his videos but the execution makes me feel retarded
how'd you guys collab? did seamus fly over from britain just to collab? if he did, yes i love it
Hogwarts probably get to the triwizard cup by train. Or portkey. I could also see Hogwarts saying get your self there
OMG!!!!!!!!! THIS VIDEO, I'VE ALWAYS WANTED IT TO HAPPEN!!!!!!!!!!! YOU TWO ARE THE BEST HP THEORY YOUTUBERS!!!! OMG😂
Well if they use trains to travel to France then what are threstrals for????
this is my FAVOURITE video!!!                                               \n\n\n\n\nHave A Nice Day :)
Flying trane
Philosopher stone
PHOLOPHESERS!!!!
Hogwarts would travel by thestrals
Dream team
Seamus sounds exactly like Tommen Baratheon
Fullmetal Alchemist Anyone?
Philosopher's stone.
OMGGG MY FAVOURITE YOUTUBERS ARE COLLABING
#32 on trending well done!!
Very awesome theory bro
*bow-baa-ton 😂
Do more videos with him
Me: Uh new video \n*klicks it*\n*sees Seamus*\nMe: SEAMUUUUUUS \n\nHis dream came true  xD
I have a feeling that Dumbledore wouldn't let the school travel in something as common as a train he'd probably enchant the beds to fly to France while the people who wanted to participate were sleeping #Dumbledore
Ben!!!!!!!!!! Seamus!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Harry Potter theory!!!!!!!! Book 5, Page 171, chapter: 10 Luna Lovegood. It sais (and I quote) and Anthony Goldstein and Padma Patil for Ravenclaw. This is referring to the prefects in book 5. He is also a part of Dumbeldor's Army and is mentiond on pages 301 (chapter 16 In the Hogs Head) and on page 349 (chapter 18 Dumbeldor's Army). He has to be related to Tina and Queenie!
Hogwarts would travel by Thestral, UH DOI
It's PHILOSOPHER'S stone! COME ON AMERICA!
Could you explain next why in the movie the death eaters fly without a broom? When in the book they say the only one to do it is, Voldemort, Snape and Dumbledore?
guy on the left had probably been raped repeatedly throughout his life....
.
i like eggs
*sniff* I'm a Hufflepuff *sniff*
Hogwarts have thestrals!!!
⚔️👃🏼➕🖕🏼💋👃🏼
BEST VIDEO EVER!!!!!
Wait, but ivthought beauxbaton was ladies only?
But didn' Dumbledore win Fawkes when duelling with Grindelwald?
#IMBRITISH
OMG CROSSOVER HWBEDKANE DB
Damn Seamus is cuuuute
Seamus with SCB
MARBLE LOOKED SO CUTE IN THAT BEAR COSTUME!
Marble is literally my spirit animal
At 6:00 when marble can't right his paw, that is a possible sign of ataxia in dogs and actually one of the ways they test for it. Might be something you talk to your vet about during your next visit. https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/ataxia-in-dogs
My boyfriend and I’s puppy is so weird and creepy sometimes. She’s a corgi puppy named Ava, and she’s about 3-ish months old. She follows me into the bathroom to get to my underwear, and she steals it and will shred it. She somehow manages to get them from out of our laundry bin sometimes. She only does it to my underwear. She’ll still my boyfriends socks, but she doesn’t really chew them. But for some reason she’s obsessed with my underwear and wants to tear them apart. She doesn’t care about my boyfriend’s underwear at all. Haha she is the only dog I’ve had that’s cared about any of my clothing at all.
MARBLE SHOULD BE THE DINOSAUR!!!!
marble in this video is my mood evryday
7:10 ahah ha aha ha Kermit the dog 🤣 great name for him, at 7:10 he does look like a puppet 😂
I like the spooky skeletons.
In every costume marble looked like he was melting 😂
Shame on Jenna! Can't get over her grief of Marbles's death and dresses up his corpse
You can tell when Marble's soul is leaving him and when it comes back before leaving him again
You should do the three little mice
I seriously love how Marbles literally deflates every time you put a costume on him 😂😂😂
Kermet's Where's the Waldo costume is amazing. And those three matching costumes are very cute too. Also, Jenna, that makeup looks great!
You should dress up your dogs as Jack's dogs for Halloween. So at least they'll know, just for once, what it's like to be the superior dogs on youtube. \n\n💗
Alternate title: Kermit being the problem child for 13 minutes straight.
I haven’t laughed that hard in so long! Marbles in that Dino costume. Dead! I literally cried I was laughing so hard. Poor guy lol
This just proves marbles is dead
i reckon peach should be the bat, Marbles should be himself cause hes already dead on the inside, and i loved kermit as waldo the glasses suit him so well haha
6:08 another NFL player kneeling and disrespecting our nation's flag. Smh
Peach should have the bat head while wearing the wedding dress.
*waits for Jacksfilms to make a similar video with his superior dogs*
That Waldo costume made my entire week
peach as a bat looks like marbles
the dinosaur just looks like a big red crab haha
Kermit has to be fucking Waldo 😂
I hope the video where Jenna announces that Marbles has finally passed away doesn't come for many, many years. 😣 I hope it doesn't come for any of her dogs any time soon but mainly old ass Marbles. 🤧 Life will never be the same.
Marbles dino look just makes him look liked a cooked lobster...
marble makes me laugh so much that i can't breath. why is he so awkward that its funny
t-rex costume is perfect for marbles since they're both extinct
Love you jenna but these wont make them cuter.
he should be a grandmom
the best looking for peach were the bat and the bride; marble was dinosaur; kermit was waldo\n\nbest overall was the matching set at the end for all of them though
Marbles actually made me worried with how dead he his like I know that's a big joke but honestly he looks like so old and tired and sad :( I know he's so well loved and cared for but he looks so sad and dead omg!!
It's a bit morbid to put costumes on a corpse.
Okay but wats the what do u have in your mouth meme bc I neED to see it
Peach can't move, Marbles is sleepy af, and Kermit just wants all the attention.
The Princess Leia costume is super adorable. You should hem the pant legs lol
marble in the dinosaur costume looks like me trying to stay awake in history class
Honestly was just waiting for Kermit to cry the entire vehicle 😂😂
jenna...you dont dress up a dead fucking dog
I'm fucking dying.  Marbles is so funny.  xD
Wasn't too exciting that was hilarious
I was hoping you would've put a sombrero and poncho on marbles 😫
I got my god s unicorn for Halloween
Fossil Marple at the end
I love how Cermet is the main problem of the entire video
Why are you dressing up a dead dog
this is it. I've found my passion.
Omg marbles is so fucking cute just wanna take him a cuddle up with him 😭😍
12:40 the iggys are legit dog tyler and josh\njoshler is real\nso is Kerch\nim\nS H O O K
The waldo one was hilarious! Idk if it was the best one, but it was funny.
why is everyone saying that marbles died?
Marbles is not helping his case. He literally was fuckin dying while being dressed in Halloween costumes
I love the part at the end where all of them are standing and the dead dog just lays there
Meebles literally makes me cry laughing. I love that stupid rat! 😂👌🏻
To be honest I feel sorry for the dogs because she forced them clothes on them and they don't give a shit.
I personally really need peach to wear the bat costume
Jenna is going to be the first big YouTuber to catch her dog dying of natural causes on camera on accident
I've been joking along with the RIP Marbles thing for awhile now but I've never been so convinced that Marbles is actually dead until this video. RIP Mr. Marbles. Dink dink
I think Peachy should for sure be Leia, and Marbles should be the football player (or the dinosaur if he doesn't care about moving!) and also Kermet should DEF be Waldo wow....also when he wears that Waldo costume, he looks like hes stoned outta his mind! so thats a plus
is your cermet going to grow
This is the deadest Marbles has ever looked
I literally forgot Marbles was still alive but it doesn't matter anyway cause he was pretty much dead the whole time ...(jk I love Marbles)
At this point the dinosaur is more alive than marbles
Has marbles lost his marbles?
2:19 Y E S SNATCH THAT WEAVE
Marbles is like my Grandpa
Favourites:\nPeaches - Leia\nMarbles - Dinosaur\nKermit - Sushi
Marble taking the knee, 10/10
WAAAAALDOOOOO!!!!
I laughed so fucking hard when peach walked sidewaya
Who puts clothes on garbage?
10:50 - wherfs waldo
Bat dog!
Bat dog - CUTE 🍑\n\nTeddy - COMFY 🔮\n(Dammit that T REX tho)\n\nWhere is Waldo ?!? - 🐸\n(Beach dude 8/10 😅)
my trash tries on halloween costumes*
shoulda dressed kermit as snoop dogg
Is marbles okay
Where's Cermet!?
Trash dogs
Marble always laying down 😂😂😂
Kermit & Marble are my two alter egos battling for dominance
is marbles dead?
why is marble so fucking miserable
Princess!! Omg that T. rex costume tho!
https://youtu.be/Uyw5iH0Nock
Pls put eyebrows on peach
i'm worried about marbles
WALDO WINS
10:49 where's Kermit
That's amazing
Where Ad’s costume?????
Peach : Princess Leia\n\nMarble : Dinosour\n\nKermit : Waldo
that nose contour
happy potter wins , awesome dog
Rachet salon your Halloween look
the bat dog!!!!!!!!!
Marble is literally me
shortly after this video, marbles tragically passed away.
If you can't quite crack it, then that's depressing, but once you're on the inside, mmmm that's refreshing! 😂😂😂
I fucking love this haha. It's actually a decent song though. Love you guys
The song is actually brilliant, though...
4:59 that guy in the pink fuck me he's moist under his pits
When will this be on iTunes?
Maybe we'll have a son. Maybe we'll have a daughter. Come and swim with me in the coconut water.  that part killed me.
the bosses have like no emotion 😂
plz release this song, its wicked!!!!!!! and bring back Andy by Hamish
This guy is a hell of a talent to polish that turd
COME SWIM WITH ME IN THE COCONUT WATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRR
When he got to coconut water in the bridge i had actual tears streaming down my face i was laughing so hard 😂 god Guy's got a good poker face!!
Yeah but love really IS a coconut
Its a good song. Please release it.
When this song is better than most songs these days
Straya, we need to make this an actual Aussie hit. Cmon lets do it :D
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Coconut Love. The lyrics are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of musical theory and poetry most of the lines will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Sebastian's nihilistic outlook on love, which is deftly woven into his song through a coconut analogy- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realize that it is not just a fun beachy song- it says something deep about love. As a consequence people who dislike Coconut Love truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the line, Come swim with me in the coconut water, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Guy Sebastian's genius wit unfolds itself on their pitiful radio executive panel. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Coconut Love tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand and are capable of being MY coconut lover. Nothin personnel kid
Guys getting on to the Tropical House wave early.
because nobody has balls to really say how they feel, this is how meetings go in real world
lol buncha yes men
I love that one guy who is just looking around the room, wondering, is no one hearing what I'm hearing. X'D
Because love is a coconut.....definitely laughed out fucking loud
Am I the only one that actually really liked that song? 😂
Dude that's a POWER PLAY by Eggo to call that
I kinda liked the song though...
Ohhh Guy.. you're such a good sport for doing this! The song is actually quite catchy!! hahaha!! You could sing your way out of a paper bag dude!! Bring this out on iTunes and I reckon it'll be a great success!! Creds to Hamish & Andy for their songwriting skills lol!! Love ALL you guys!!
hamish and andy are back.. this is a good day
currently refreshing Spotify, awaiting this upload!!!
sweat patches at 4:58
Just proves that Guy is so talented he can make anything sound amazing!
I could barely handle the cringe. Respect to Guy, though, for doing this.
Funny but if you like good music check out some of the videos on my channel. Enjoy!!!!!
This video is over 24 hours old and hasnt hit 100k views yet this shit is on trending??  Let me guess...Hamish and Andy both suck on Kosher Cock? ya,....
I loved it!😂😂😂 Supporting Guy Sebastian for 5 years strong from America!
Love is a coconut - someone reddits
it's actually not that bad lol
Please put it on Spotify. I would listen bahahahahaha
sooooo, when does Coconut Love get released?  Because I totally dug it
He did a good job with the music and vocals but the lyrics were just so bad lol
It’s not a bad song with Guy Sebastian singing it......
It’s identical to NCS  except you have to pay for it.   This should be free it’s so bad
That song is horrendously generic, shame on you.
We all want this song. please make it accessible so that, we ,the community ,will make it viral. Please
Polish it up a tad more - I'd keep listening to it
Who knew that the song was actually good?
This says a lot about the state of most pop music.
Please release this song
Hey I’m in my 30s but I don’t think it sounds like something only young people like. I love the song so much. I really hope they make it a single. 💖
--- I want to hear the song, too please! 20OCT17 ---
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2NqNwRQ8hQ&t=205s firts slow motion PUBG
This would already be a number 1 hit if it'd be Shannon Noll releasing it.
This song has been in my head ever since yesterday
Stupid sells so of course the execs said yes.
Why isn't that rug in the middle between the tables
Is this how music works now? You pitch a song to a room full of executives?
It's great what he made in just two hours but why are people praising it so much, it's a pretty simple, repetitive song. (Although some people might just be used to that)
such a great song! needs to be released on itunes right now!  #tropicalhouse
There's a very fine line between a shitty song and a popular song, matter of fact, they are the same.
So you have a central committee that approves music?  No wonder modern music sucks.
The four chords win again !
Release the single! Lets make it go number 1 and don’t tell the rest of the world!
Aside from the actual lyrics, this song is actually so catchy and great!!
Can we get it on itunes please?
this fkn song is actually in my head now hhahahha
Seriously, please release the song somewhere!
one of the most amazing things I've ever seen hahahahha
i loved listening to this on the radio...
Why'd you change it from terd to disaster?
Next song: Youtube is a Coconut
Brilliant! I loved this so much
Lol you're so lucky he's like one of THE most talented singers in the world 😂
I listened to this song on the radio !! It was so funny! You guys are awesome !!😂😜
https://youtu.be/LKfc6lL74og
cringe
plaese release this song!!!
Sounds like a legit Jason Derulo song.
Hahaha 😂
So many frauds, SO LITTLE TIME.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5i8bMVyKpw
Who else feels like getting a c-nut?
Two aussie icons
love it.
This guy 😂😂😂😂
Sounds like anything else on the radio.. Don't see how this is much different.
Buncha 'Yes Men' cocacunts. \n\nThe guy was the only smart cocacunt out of the bunch.
Come swim in the coconut water... bahahahaha
I want Taylor Swift to date Eminem, and then to break up, just to listen to these two's dis songs towards each other.
who's the guy in the white shirt?
Better than any song I could write
Very catchy and I can sing it already lol
This shit gonna blow up, calling it now
It's so sad that people are saying this is a good song.....for a comedy album, yes this is good....as an actual song its complete crap and this is hilarious.
And this is on trending with 89k views in 1 day, because?
First
Hah, cheeky Auto-Tune at 0:46\n\nNot that I'm hating, most vocals nowadays are tuned to some degree. However, that's not a bad thing, autotune and plug-ins like it are great tools to help achieve the desired result, especially in this situation where he has such a short amount of time to record the vocal
I like it bro.
was I the only one who wanted to see the ball drop at 2:20 and the other balloons to break too at 2:24
joderrrr the best song in the fuck vidaaa
I don't know why... but my ziam heart aches listening to this song...
Is no one going to talk about the stereotypical bad boy image this person shows. I'm lovin' It!
FALSETTO HIGHER THAN MY GRADES, LIAM, WHAT THE HECK
2:32 - 2:34 - 2:36\nThe voice at the back sounds like Zayn ;-;
This one is way better than Strip That Down!Way way way way way better
Ur voice sounds better than Zayn's nd Charlie Puth's...
I am so proud
I AM NOT OKAY AFTER LISTENING TO THIS SONG!!!
I like this, for some reason this gives me a Drake vibe
I need ziam's collab right now
This song has good vibes ❤️
Damn this song is good.
You're reading this, Liam??\nI need you to collaborate with Zayn in future! No, I meant NEAR future!\nI'm calling for a petition for Ziam collaboration!! \nXOXO from Indonesia!
Pure love from #INDIA 😍😍😍😍
Oh my God this is so bad, what garbage. Yikes
THAT HIGH NOTE KILLED ME😰😰😰😭😭
I got Notifications When He Said \nmy iPhone Rings
ALL THIS NEW MUSIC FROM THE 1D BOYS I CAN’T KEEP UP AHHHH
I LOVE the song but I thought Adam Levine was featured...Then I realized it was Liam just Liam. I never knew he could sing that high. Impressive 👌😇
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU BABY😍😍😍💕❤\nJUST GETTING STARTED 😍🙆💕❤ \nI LOVE YOUU!#
Please subs my channel! For more lyric video. Help me to build it up! Thank you so much
I broke my replay button \n\nFirst Louis\nSecond Niall\nThird Liam \nFourth Zayn\n And uh where is Harry's new song???\nYes of course Liam Payne do sound like Adam L from Maroon 5 and I'm in love with this new song and did a great job on this one and I am not ready what will the video be like!!!!
What is it with 1D and dirty laundry???
Oh no, but this is gonna get so annoying to listen to because it’s quintessential pop: repetitive, unnecessary falsettos, and overwhelmingly shallow...just what the DJs love to play.\n\nI really liked “Strip That Down” and “Get Low” though.
Liam looks like the next David Beckham.
in love with this song after \ndusk till dawn \nim just like you \nflicker \nand \nbedroom floor 😍😍😍
Lyrics are quite  poor tbh like love everything but like iPhone iPhone........ Sounds like something someone would write in a 2000 song
Don't fucking say which phone k it's not fair

harry also has a new song so\n\nyea (just look up 'girl crush' its so good) it's a cover but stilll
the vid tho... so flippin' awesome.... they're all so damn talented
Written by Charlie Puth - and it is about a relationship between charlie and another girl
Why is he using autotune? He doesn't need it. Unfortunate that he's endorsing that.
How do I love you so much like I normally don’t like newer songs but yours 😍👍🏻👍🏻
Its just me or that flag is the same as Rita Ora’s YOUR SONG lyrics video
at first i didn't like it bUT THE BEAT AND THE BEDROOM FLOOR PART FUCKED ME UP

SOPH YOU'RE 28 ON TRENDING!!
that makeup bag is gorgeous
full face of pr makeup????
****QUICK TIP**** the PERVERSION mascara has a more watery formula at first. I didn’t like it for a bit because of it. Then I went back to it about two weeks later and something must have happened when it was introduced to air but it’s now my favourite mascara. Also the formula is more NATURAL and you won’t get intense clumpy looks with it. It’s amazing for the everyday person who wants really long looking lashes but it doesn’t really volumes them. It’s good for an everyday natural makeup look:) I hope this helped!
I got your palettes as a birthday gift for my sister and she loves them so much !!
Can you please do a video on the beauty bakery eyeshadow?
Now I really need to get one of those aurora glow kits! So pretty!
No hate, but your eyebrows look a bit red, warm brown. Could you try something cooler?\nI am really not hating I just noticed it, I watch all your videos! ❤
first trailer was better
what is the song?
I'm sure this'll be cool but I'm so fucking burnt out on comic book shit that I won't watch it.
Billy will surely turn into Jigsaw by the end of the season.
metallica makes anything better\ni still think they are THE metal gods
His cameos in dare devil and the two trailers have already been way better than the best parts of the three movies combined.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I see Diamonback( Erik LaRay Harvey) in there at 0:04. Good connective tissue.
sic vis pacem para bellum - If you want peace, prepare for war
1st trailer: The Punisher and what he's best at. Shooting without hesitation.\n2nd trailer: Revealing the rest of the Punisher's backstory and human side.
Can't wait!! Hope it is good.
I'm so excited to watch Netflix's CoD Modern Warfafe.☺
might be a hint at Moon knight at 1:42
Holy shit... released same day as Justice League... when Justice League loses money opening weekend, it's because everyone was home binge watching Punisher...
With the Nov 17 release, Do you really wanna compete with Justice League
Best Character in the Netflix Marvel universe so far IMO.
Punisher is now much darker while Justice League becomes childrens show.
And 4 days after my birthday.
Punisher in Jammies.... I've seen shoes more interesting than that.
I'm stating right now that Frank Castle and what made him into The Punisher  is the best ''personnification'' of Metallica's One song.
The hype is REAL
I think Dinah Madani (the woman in they grey and red suit) was close or in a relationship to the man being tortured in the video files (Ahmad Zubair) and that's why she's after the punisher. Just a guess
The punisher's battle van along with the weapons at 1:31. Damn!
ONE was a perfect song for this. Im so pumped for this show
Fuckin hell. We got some good shows and movies coming up. Mr robot, vikings, punisher, star wars, justice league, thor and many more
This is gonna be sick \m/
I bet more people will binge this than justice league.
Ok so old can someone explain to me when frank was in the military and posses them off enough to kill his family. Cause I grew up on a completely different story than this crap
This looks incredible. Hope it's not as disappointing as The Defenders and Iron Fist
Yes a metallica song in a movie trailer
1:36 sounded like Jon Bernthal for a second
Perfect song for the punisher
Shit is like drinking a pint full of absinthe and burping and farting at the same time with heartburn ❤️ 🔥- painful but you fucking love it
They have Metallica's song. This series is goona be the best Superhero TV show
He won't be the Punisher until the end of the series.
This ONE remix should get a proper full song release, then win a grammy, then an Oscar and then be the fucking national anthem
Do any of you guys thing that Liev Schreiber would’ve played a good punisher or no? (Sabretooth in Wolverine Origins)
What are you, some kind of........\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPunisher??????
these filler and side characters are pissing me off.
Punisher vs Thanos That s a Battle
I hope his shirt has meaning on how he got it.
Finally a Netflix Marvel character who is not a pussy.
Yay. They didn't delay this amazing shit.
I hope this is good, I really do.  I am a little disappointed though that the second season of Daredevil already dealt with a corrupt US military member as Frank's central plot and now that's pretty much the central plot of this one too.  Sigh.  Hopefully they won't go back to that well for Punisher season 2.  Also, hope they sneak in something like a Marc Specter reference.
I'm So Glad They Show How He Served His Country & They Used Him. Story Of His Life Is Tragic With Him Losing His Family But His Revenge Is Epic! #FrankCastle #ThePunisher
Well..it seems John is the punisher...too excited for this..
I absolutely love the use of One in both trailers. I mean, I know Castle still has all his limbs but I still feel like the song fits him amazingly
Shane from the walking dead? 🔥🔥
It's about damn time that they finally put the punishers van in a punishers movie! Where the last three punisher movies his van was not in the movie.
I thought the Mob killed her family, but it was actually his team. Interesting
I still can’t trust Shane since the Walking Dead
finally has a release date
I'm guessing everyone here loves films as well so, check out the short film on my channel! Let me know what you think, critiques etc. Thanks
Hope that whiny fucking lawyer Karen gets killed with her moral bullshit such a boring character get fucked and die please
OMG! This is premiering on my birthday!
Steve Rogers: I see you have a very impressive resume Mr. Castle but I don't think you're a good fit for our team because it requires.......uh......teamwork.\n\nFrank Castle: One batch, two batch.......\n\nSteve Rogers: (panicking) Uh Av.....Avengers assemb.....\n\nFrank Castle: (headbutts and knocks out Rogers) Penny and dime....
I love sense8 miss you ❤❤❤
Who would want to watch a finished revenge? This shouldn’t be the prequel. Show us what happened to him, what he did AFTER the daredevil.
what is the name of the matallica song thee playing
So thats it huh... He just some kind of punisher?
So glad they made the punisher after having him on daredevil.
Can you tell me the song used in the trailer??? Please
https://youtu.be/L8FSBPfWnM4\nYou do your part?world need you
Is it just me or does it look like Karen might get shot and possibly die?
f this world  and awesome ,no more dc and marvel  LOL
I'm a little sick of this shared universe thing. It's great when rationed, but now every movie and show has to have characters from every other movie and show. Does Karen Page need to be in this if all she'll do is complain?
Did they have to fuckin show her dead???...
November 17th I see what you did there Marvel.
These guys are going to need a much bigger army.
Wow!  Looks awesome! 😍
Jon Bernthal owns this
*Foggy?*
RIP justice league
Shit I’m so psyched!
oh *hell yes*
Lmao looks like a school shooter
Awesome trailer!
Shane before TWD
Let’s Rock
Awesome
*WAKE ME!!!!!*
One batch two batch penny dime
oh please god wake me tattoo worthy quote
Damn this looks sick!!!!
Hell. Yes.
Kill them all
*Rick tilts his head*
*Shane? :O*
Can't wait!
Marvle’s: Jason Bourne
man the camara angles suck
Moon Knight show next?
Boss ass trailer yo.
Two words.......Battle Van.....
Definitely just ne
I am a simple man, I hear metallica..... I WILL BLOODY WATCH THIS!!!!
I'm sorry. I don't want to be that guy, this looks awesome, really. But it isn't the Punisher.  Frank's family was killed by the mob, not the CIA. I'd be fine if it was the CIA who used the mob as a sort of pawn to kill his family, and then as he worked through the mob he discovered that the CIA hired them to do the hit, but this doesn't look like it. I know that not everything can be the same as the comics but this just doesn't seem like a Punisher show. I'll probably still watch it for Bernthal though.
This trailer sucks. Seriously hire a better trailer director.
Explosions.
Lmfao, this is the shit they said would compete with justice league? Lmao. JL had 3 times the views that this has after 3 days in 1 hour.😂😂😂
Oh.  Joy.  Yet another movie attacking the US Army.  The people who put their lives on the line daily, who die daily, protecting you pathetic civilians so you can make this trash that attacks us.  How brilliant you are, attacking the very people who allow you to live your life the way you want to.
God, Anthony are you ever not attractive ?!
I always love the intro🙄 Its weirdly awesome (like the music and stuff)
lol when he was a vegan wearing a leather jacket
That’s not fair I’m gay
Why is a vegan wearing leather??? 😂
I honestly would wear the La Brea Tar Pits one.
My favorite kind of dog is a lab
As soon as the quality of the video dropped, he definitely looked like Brendon Urie.
1:33 Ofc u dont look like Brendon, ur forehead is too small
The Onision shade at the end.
He is wearing the same shirt as the guy in the sims 4 pets live stream the shirt is the future is female
Tbh I do think he looks like Brendon a bit. They are both attractive.❤️😁
The brawny man one wasn't half bad
Oh my god he kinda does look like beebo
It seems everything used to be fun!  The left can wreck anything.

Every time your wear your Stuart Weitzman over the knee boots, I swoon so hard! Seriously so timeless, but so incredibly out of my price range! One day! So beautiful on you!
“Noo too depressing” back to sam smith song and sing along 😹😹 you are literally me Amelia 😹
I usually don't give in to hypes either!! Buttt Fenty Beauty foundation is AMAZING Amelia! Please try it and let us know :)
Really loved your stuff that you ordered from US. Pretty pretty 👍🏻 Get well soon duke ❤️
Oh estee needs to watch all of friends lol
The CT palette is soooo good..x
Yes to Fenty foundation
The yellow Fenty highlighter is not Kilowatt, the whole range of highlighters is called Killawatt, but the one you're both referring to is called Trophy Wife ;) And I agree about the hype, ultimately, Riri or no Riri, it's a brand riding on another brand. The only cool thing about it is the range of colors for darker skinned people, which is worth the praise!
Lovelovelove your new Autumnal wear and love it when you and Estee hang out, that park looked so beautiful. Sweet blessings Amelia 😘🙏😘✨
Touches hair every 2 seconds yes we see it’s there
What car do u own?
girl this video is on #29 trending..xx
Why dont you try the tarte shape tape concealer ? It is really amazing
I LOVED that skirt!!! Ahhh ❤️
Such a cute vlog💗💗
Cute!!
No, too depressing lmao
My favourite parts of this video are Duke looking sooo cute under the table at 6.52 and the manic bird in the background from 11.42 LOL.
I was like yessssss yesssss it looks like Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
anything with you and estee is a must watch! :)
The cone of shame 😩
you should try the shape tape concealer by tarte, it is the absolute best!
There is a back applicator. I got mine at the beauty supply store
Nice
How did they not acknowledge that crazy squeaking/squealing sound at the park while they were talking?! My dogs went mental 😆
I miss seeing you together!!!!
The Mac and Cheese reference!!!
The skirt looked great with that colour of jumper!
love the dress & new pleated skirt you got!!
Would love to win the bag very much:) love your all videos 😍😍😍🤞🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🎉🎉🎉
Tarte shape tape concealer 👌🏻
About time!
Love love your videos!
haha! autumn smurf <3
I just looooove your vlogs :)
Love the skirt!
❤️u though 😘😊
Omg those burgundy heels tho
I loved how smiley Duke looked with his cone! He's really cute and it is great to see him in a good mood specially because every single dog feels miserable with it on.
The long skirt is amazing on you!
for correcting i use born this way radiant concealer - it has a yellow undertone. then i use nars radiant creamy concealer.
What nail polish are you wearing?? Love it!!
Not used my bourjois healthy mix in ages, it looks so nice on you so definitely going to reach for it next time! Your new hair looks gorgeous 💇🏽🌸
YES MAC AND CHEESE FROM FRIENDS YESSSS
I was literally just watching the MAC and CHEESE episode in friends!
First: this comment isn't because I have watch the video. But I missed Amelia and Essie Button vlog ... seeing this combo it's a rare now.. but thanks again for making the good video, full of real beauty stuff etc... 🤗🤗
have you ever tried the tarte shape tape for concealer?
Hands down that dress was amazing!!!! You looked gorgeous in it!!!! Love youuu
How did you both stay chill whilst that bird was squawking in the tree hahaa
Girllll your fringe looks so cute!!!
Press that button so fast when i saw that video  on my feed lol such a huge fan !!! those clothes are giving me major autumn envy but on my island we only get two seasons: summer and winter ( it is a tropical island !) i would kill for your wardrobe ( like not literally tho !) Lots of love from New Caledonia x
You where right about that song in the car, you where singing the chorus tho so you gotta wait :) loved the vid A x
Try the new Diorskin Forever concealer. It’s even better than Nars Creamy x
Love your vlogs 😉 p.s. I'm on instagram kaprizina_style
Re:  fake tanning your own back. You can actually attach a tanning mitt to any long-handled implement, even a fish-slice, so you can reach down your back. It's a bit awkward, but it works!!
Dear Amelia could you please send me your Eyeglasses link, if you have it. Am in love with them 😍😝👌✨
''Like Mac And Cheese in Friends!''  Amazing, thank you Amelia xD <3
Whats the brand that mimics other clothing? The pink top brand?
Amelia I love you!! Ur fan from SaudiArabia
Miss u both together...love your friendship hope to see more of you too together and also I miss your sister in your blog 😘😄
Loving tan and a good self-tan back applicator!!
That pink top is Joanna Ortiz vibes totally
Amelia that WAS the Maneater song you thought it was on the radio lol

Loving the hauls! Now I need to get a pleated skirt in my wardrobe.
What brand of hair straighter you use?
Love your vlogs ❤️your new hairstyle looks amazing I want to get a fringe soo bad
try the Tarte ShapeTape concealer! its the best and lasts all day! and comes with more product for your money spent
Yaaaas!!! I missed vlogs of you two hanging out 😍😍😍
I know mac n cheese!!!
the bare minerals bareskin concealer is pretty good for a more natural look! :)
The songs she played during her car ride reminds me K109 in GTA IV in The Ballad of Gay Tony.

I am new to your channel & I love our videos & loved the but of you in your car, lol
Why did u pass on hall & oates :-(

I love your style so much! The bangs look beautiful. Very classy. ❤️
Omg, I never liked fringes BUT you changed my mind! You look amazing 😻😻✨✨✨
When you say something from Friends and people know what you mean. Instant bonding :)
So nice to see you guys hanging out in your backyard and not on the run.  Jackie
Cheap zip replace it if worth it.... Love the skirt, love the long dress perfect for you, perfect sweater, jumper and wear thigh hi boots...

GRACE TAYLOR SAW YOUR INSTA STORY ABOUT GORGEOUS ON TUMBLR A FAN POSTED IT AND SHE REBLOGGED SAYING SHE LOVES IT
“I don’t love you guys that much” -Grace Helbig\nme with my “loved ones”
Aaaahh. What is that?! \n\nGet rid it with fire.
Whoa. They actually turned out great. XD
I feel like you would be trailer trash if YouTube wasn't here.

i LOVE you.. this is my everything
Please, let us know via Instagram what outfit was the chosen one LOL both are really good
How does it feel to wear a bodysuit backwards lol 😂

Get prepared to get sued by Taylor Swift
I want Grace to sit on my face.

Hey guys! I just posted my first video, and I’d really love some support on my channel! \nThanks!!\nH
LOL! I love you Grace!
You did such a God job at the makeup wowowow what
Pretty darn good job. If someone else does the lettering, they might want to do it in a document first, print it, pin it to the material and then cut it.
You look so ugly compared to Taylor Swift
Two successful DIYs in one video !? Who's channel am I watching !?
grace's body looks disproportionate with that...outfit.
I love this video.
Another awesome video, Grace!! I make videos too. If you want to you can check them out ☺
We're just going to lurve on the Gracie for this one ;).
watch at half speed and wonder wtf was in those brownies
ehhhh work on it maybe with some help
I'm...genuinely angry at how good those letters came out after watching how annoyed she was with making them. \n\nDamn Grace. You're great.
I keep replaying the vid when you hit ur leg I'm deadddd
A stump\n\n\n\n\nPatrick stump\nEmo fandom where you at

I was surprise how amazing grace's font making by hand skils are and also her ability to make something out of face paint
Looks like The Mask

i think i have seen this video like 8 times and it's still funny.
Hey Nile. Well I just got a suggestion, in the equine world there is a sport called Volting. Volting is like gymnastics on a horse. I reckon you could be good at it! Love your videos and goodbye! ❤️😊
Would be the best video ever if you did a collab with logan or jake🤷🏼‍♀️
I've never made a comment on YouTube before...but you got me with the Castaway Wilson soundbite. Well done! 😂
Why is this guy always trending
2:05 what can you listen to this on
What does that mask do? I'm an inter club level 3 and next year I'm going to be a provincial level 3😜
Tbh I just come for the video cuz I saw him shirt less

My friend got more push-ups than that on the push-up test and he is only 10

Need to see Logan
I’m a logangster and a wilsonite I guess. Love you both
6:34 That's not doing pushups, that's headbanging towards the floor. Many of you pushed your numbers by doing 1/2 and 1/4 pushups. Elbows in, chest touches the floor! Come on.
What in the hell was that push up form of the dude in the black shirt (First one)
Do a collab with a subscriber and try teach them how to do a back flip. I did gymnastics for about 1-2 years and never learnt how to do any type of flip 😭😂
You look soooo happy in this vlog! It's heartwarming😊 keep smiling!!!! 😆
I can do 64 dips-it's me record
Cheap out my motorbike stunt please on my channel it's crazy  ❤️
Your videos are so packed that I always have to watch them at least twice in a row! :)
This vlog was hilarious! I’ve been having a particularly bad week and this just made all my stress melt away. Thanks Nile! 💕
bitta patrick topping in the back ye ye forget
Mentioning the Paul's cost Nile 1,000 subs,you do you Nile but personally I don't think they're good people
Editing was on point in this vid 👌🏻
why would you like to collab with those two stupid idiots you probably dont know what im talking about because your in the uk but the paul brothers are on the news in america for doing stupid things and are known for being fucking ass holes
How has Nile not got more followers
I know you've spoken to Marcus Butler about collabing so he's one suggestion. My 2nd is some of the diversity boys :)
The Girls Just Want to Have Fun montage was wonderful.
You should definitely collab with Jake Paul and teach him a backflip
you think 59 is good? my dad used to do 80 when he was 18 and now he can do 110
pick LOGAN insted of that joke Jake
I can't stop looking at the nipple now
What does he have on his hands, the red stuff? Is it to stop his hands overextending?
Do a calab with Roman Atwood
One of your best blogs so far :) cheers from Colombia ^_^
Collab with the Dobre Twins not the Paul's
You should try to do a collab with Zack Merrick. He's the bassist for All Time Low and can do like two minute handstands and trains on rings. His Insta is zacharymerrick  you should check it out
Nile, why don't we save ourselves some time and just get married right now? Love your videos and you're so talented and sweet!
Love your blogs.  Keep it up.
What's wrong with Jake and Logan Paul? I think I've been under a rock.
So amazing! Best blog yet. I was laughing so much!
Don't collab with Jake Paul please.
Am I the only one in the comments who likes Jake Paul ?

Hi I go gymnastics class at general and want to join the squad what should I do
He's a whole trash
This dude is retarded. As lavar said, this will likely be his only interview 😂😂
Lonzo will top beverly over the course of the next 3-5yrs. As of now.. \n\nBeverly - 1\nLonzo - 0
One dimensional defensive players who have garbage offense aren't supposed to trash talk....  He's no Gary Payton .  His defense means nothing when the opponent ignores him on the other end of the floor. Ron Artest said it himself, to be able to really make a big  impact as a defender, you gotta be able to score as well.
Lonzo is going to be a HOF. Beverly is not even going to be a foot note in the history of the NBA. He's just salty that Lonzo is getting a lot of attention while Beverly will be forgotten in 5 years ala Ruben Paterson.
Beverly is just jelly because lonzo's hair is curlier than his.
Damn beverly coming from an htown fan, stop being such a dick
He just wanted to read to you😭😭
If anything Patrick Beverley did Lonzo a big favor, like he just said he gonna have a lot of people coming at him, and since he's one of the best defenders in the NBA Lonzo just got a sense of what he going to compete with
And that’s the definition of a Nigger.
I was a “fan” of pat bev..not now. His ugly ass look like he drink 40s wit a brown paper bag on it....bill Cosby son lookin ass
Beverley is a dick
Won't let the guy read the comment.  He's jealous cause he can't read.  I can't read, nobody reads near me!
A lot of people taunt when they play defense...Beverley does it a lot against Russell Westbrook and look at his mentality😂
This guy needs to stop flexing 1st team all defense. Ain't nobody give a fuck about 1st team all defense after Avery Bradley didn't make it last season who is a better defender than Beverley. All Beverley can do is guard point guards, any player who isn't a PG would drop his ass off
So whaddisay\nWant me to read it to you?\nNo. So whaddisay\n\nThis guy is a bum lol
Why he acts like he’s good for?
Beverly be acting like a petty ex bitch over Lonzo... damn he even doing it to reporters, why you mad bro lol. He low-key love Lonzo 🤣🤣🤣 LONZO GOT BEVERLY PUSSY HURT
Patrick Beverly, I have strong words for you too..............\n\nGet a new barber
I already didn't like Beverly, and after this interview I really don't like him. what a prick
He is not even that good. I think lonzo is way better thank him plus he is still a rookie
Patrick is a G.  He checked that nigga.
Why are you so mad bro...... your filty rich
He is a clown.  I like to face this kinda of players,  I will show he they truly are, but I play soccer.
Nigga don’t even ball that’s why he got traded in the first place😂😂😂
His dad put a target on his back from before he even played a game but Beverly is the biggest douche in the nba for sure he’ll be traded again before the season ends lmao 😂
What a bitch.....can't back up his own words.
Pat Beverly look like a truck driver.
He really did lock down ball in that win though, but he looks like he's cloutchasing after lonzo's fame (watch his previous video on snapchat talking about the game ahead).
Talking all that shit and you still lost Hahahaha
Patrick Beverly is a NBA jump-off. You got famous for hurting Russell Westbrook knee. #StayInYourLane
Why do these journalists have to be such duche bags?
Lonzo Ball's IQ and court vision will allow him to last longer in the NBA than this dude. Get your shine on Patrick coz it's ticking away. Next thing you know, you'll be watching Lonzo from your couch reminiscing about that one time. Mark my words. Physicality has a short shelf life my friend.
Terrible attitude and rude as hell.
News flash, Lonzo is going to see more Patrick Beverly's, so that's to be expected.\nThis guy DOES NOT SUFFER FROM IBHF(Iso Ball Hog Fever) and he seems NOT to suffer from BIG HEAD CELLULITIS, so let him play about 40 more games so that we can see what he really is made of.
Hey dude if Beverley won’t let you read it to him , Then put it in the comments so we can listen lol
Man ball is a grown ass man stfu saying picking on a fucking rookie shit...💯 man tf up grown man sport you gone have words with ppl y'all sound like soft as school teachers in these comments
All these Butt hurt laker fans hahaha probably not even laker fans just ball family dick riders
Bev is an agitator, he gets into the heads of his matchup, calm the fuck down defending the new kid, hes a grown ass man, the lonzo fanboys are out here way too strong
Lol why are people mad at the way Patrick beverly played Lonzo he plays most top PGs like that, and if anything its better for Lonzo to understand the type of competition hes playing
He thinks he’s the shit now lmao
I kinda felt sorry for Lonzo but hey his father brought this on him and Lonzo shudda told him to chill. Nonetheless i think Lonzo will do fine
Lots of soft ass Ball groupies commenting on this thread... damn. Over the course of the season, Ball will improve and learn valuable lessons. Stop crying like a bunch of bitches. Beverly did his job. Wow...
Pat Bev a angry dude lmao Lonzo will get better over time playing against lockdown defenders. At least I hope it will make him better.
lonzo should tell his dad to shut his fucking mouth... if his dad wasnt trying to be a celeb he wouldnt be getting picked on... beverly is just the beginning... a ton of players are out to get lonzo... cant wait to see curry school him
Enjoy interviews now cuz in a week everyones gonna forget
Pat Beverly is going to jail after his playing days.  There is no way he isn't going to be involved in crime.
Beverly is a clown. That kid is 19 with his first nba game. Foh
I feel sorry for this generation that's coming up, sofTT with two T's. Women sports tougher than men sports these days and the fans/softsissys even worse. God Bless.
Learn English More with Rosetta click Here ==> \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FulwcE1bjY8&list=PLO9xLvlNItnELoUYQ4nXQDuailx7rsrZz
Overrated defender...plays physical but DOES NOT LOCK anyone down. All good PGs in the league give him the biz.
Bev is the Definition of a Junk Yard Dog. Welcome to the league rookie.
Now if he can shut down curry and Westbrook.
all these people saying beverley wrong for picking on a rookie.... what was he supposed to do, hold his hand and offer him an autograph?  this is the nba, not some pickup at the park
Beverley look like the type of niqqah to fight a 16 year old and tell all his niqqahs he be whooping niqqahs asses lmao
Patrick is a punk bitch
Am I the only laker fan who was happy to see Lonzo get whooped, it's just gonna make him better and more focused for the next games. Beverly did him a solid
Rude AND ugly - that's a bad combo. SMH.
He's the Tony Allen of this generation, good defender but not much else. he's entirely irrelevant and should feel lucky he even gets interviews considering how average he is as a player.
You can tell Pat too real for this 😂
this guy must be so proud of himself...
This guy is SAVAGE. Love it
Patrick Beverly you ain’t shit you’ll be back home watching the playoffs in no time
This nigga ralkin like he shut down Jordan or somethin😂
This is lit. He's like Tell me what I said then 😂😂😂
Yeah. Have your fun now because you is 29 years old. Lonzo is going to own your lil shyt one day. Karma mofo!

As a big fan of bugzy and walking dead this is 🔥🔥
Yeah its a dead riddem thats for sure
They’ve only approved the positive comments, what is this lads flow though?
I like Bugzy, but this was shit. Just 3 mins of bullshit and spoilers. I've seen the walking dead btw. Season 7 waa dissapointing. The whole season was a fucking filler until I saw the tiger. Season 8 better show more pf the tiger and negan dying
Bugzy Malone is getting boring now
Who ever disliked this doesn't have a life

This mans a pagan but he killed this
I love his accent
Has any one seen my barber ?
Isit just me who thought this was gunna be a chip diss lol
Shouldn't this have a spoiler alert in the beginning....I mean some people may watch this really...really...late.
Sounds like some real fan , he called Carl car and said Tara was in the line up when she wasn’t and he also said it’s all a dream but it’s not
Here before it blows up! Holy shit. #22 with just 1.7k views

So this is trending but Bugzy's channel isn't? Quarter of a million views in 2 days
Shit accent
He's boring me,where did the storytelling bugzy go?
This is actually legendary!

Walking dead obsessed really. What show you watching because Tara isn't in the line up
Nice production, trash song
This song is just too beautiful <3 <3 Niall has an amazing voice <3
I AM SO PROUD OF NIALLLLLLLLLL <3
I play Odette in Rangked game and i use flicker
Every sentence makes me want to curl up into a ball and cry. Such an emotional and touching song!
This song is so beautiful like omg 😭😍
These lyrics got to me so much... maybe not just in a way he originally put the lyrics but... my brother and i lost contact with eachother, as we had a lot of problems going on in our family, (too complicated for explaining), but yeah, it's really sad for me coming home like i'm some kind of a stranger...now he is planning to move away from home and i'm afraid that it is gonna be even worse if we ain't gonna see eachother for a long time...\nAnd yes, can you also interpret it in a way that she is dying and he is praying for her not to leave...?\n(Sorry for bad english)
I WANNA CRY HIS VOICE SO BEAUTIFUL
to whoever hurt niall i just wanna talk
never regret loving and believing in them.... proud to be a directioner
I'm so proud and in love with you❤ you are amazing
It' s so Beautiful this song niall ❤😢
Someone who has put so many feelings into the song has to experience it
This deserves more recognition than some of the other trending songs.
This song makes me cry
Nialler, you were so right about this song.  You said that the orchestra, men who do this daily for a living, were wiping their eyes after playing this song.  I have lost count how many times I've played it, but I still get emotional, knowing that this is your creation.  Niall is such a beautiful soul, I can't imagine what is coming from him in the future given that the album 'Flicker' is such a phenomenal accomplishment.  You bring such light to everyday.
This is so beautiful
I feel like a proud mother
proud of you nialler i love youuu 😘
The chords for this pleasee
im in actual tears niall is a flicker of hope that i wanna keep
I cannot stop crying . May be something fell into my  eyes
*please* *don't* *leave* \n*My* *heart* *goes* *out* *for* *NIALL*
Sorry but song is too slow and there is no rhyme he is just basically saying words and idc what lyrics says.
This song gonna make me cry because its full with emotions
amazing 😊I really ❤this song .well done nial
I wish I was that mic
This song is so beautiful that i actually cried :') I'm so proud of you, my boy
Omg i really love this song

We're still waiting for the shawn and niall collab
REALLY, THIS IS JUST SOOO DAMN BEAUTIFUL!  THIS WILL BE MY SONG WHILE I'M MARCHING THE ISLE.
Wow.. this is really good 💕💕
He used to be my least favourite in One Direction, but now WOW❤ Not that I thought he was a bad singer before, he was just never given the chance to show what he was capable of. Love that we get to see what he can do all on his own
Why am I crying in the club right now?
Honestly this song is helping me feel when I’ve been numb all night 🖤
I'm so so proud of you  Baby Penguin .I know, you are perfect,and I love you. Thank's for change my life and my thoughts too, thank's for all that astonashing songs and thank's to Maura for give me the best human ever...
Lets get this to 3m :)\nWho agree's ?
Just one word can describe this song : Art. 🎻💕
I love how it goes from low to high pitch... (starts at 2:10)
IM NOT CRYING. YOU'RE CRYING. WE'RE ALL CRYING
his voice makes me feel so greaaaaat 😍
I love his sound....he's come very far since X Factor days.
This is just beyond beautiful..
The best song in the world I’am crying 😢😭😭
i am sitting here just balling how do you expect me to be ok after this!?
This made me very emotional.
I'm crying, Niall's voice is really smooth,comforting; i always knew he had an incredible voice 💕💕
Niall's solo career really is brilliant. <3 <3
It sounds like one last time at the beginning. nice song
Im always captivated with your voice and lyrics..so cool to listen..

this is beautiful, niall. thank you for sharing your talent. i love you.
I can't stop listening to this. I don't want to stop listening to this. I'm so very glad I did listen to this, because I think it may just be the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. The composition, the melody, the accompaniment, Niall's soft pure voice, everything about it is, well, beautiful.
Flicker & Two Ghosts will be a good remix
The 1D ray is scattering!!!!1D Rules!!!!!
Sounds like a 1D Boy
This song is ...zjxjansbsbsbssbb!!\nDirectioners only you will understand my feeling💜

Amazing
3:37 THATS WHAT SHE SAID :D
Jemma looks like my ICT teacher
13k views... on the trending tab?
What if i don't want to use a golden syrup or i just don't have it? What adjustments should i do?\n^^
i love baking too!!!!
Yummmm Jemma u are a genius
My grandmother used to make very similar caramels and 10/17/17 was the one year anniversary of her passing. This was perfect timing. Thank you for sharing.
USE CORN SYRUP INSTEAD OF GOLDEN! I didn't know golden syrup was LITERALLY no where else but England. So many confused people hahah. But there is a substitute. Do not use honey
Like before watching for obvious reasons :)
Would compound chocolate effect the recipe other than taste? Does coveture chocolate set up better? This looks so good!
MashAllah
That looks so delicious! Yummy !! A very nice recipe. Have a nice weekend. Lena
could you make the Blondie's w/ this please!!!  And show us how you come up w/ the recipe?
Please make your favourite chocolate cake that yoh can layer x
I miss the Halloween videos so much 😭
What temperature does chocolate burn at does anyone know?? And I like this recipe
Your english accent is SOOOOOO charming. We love your channel
Hello Jemma, I can't wait to see what you come up with for Halloween!!!!!
I love how you aren’t an ordinary chef. You’re just one of a kind.\n\nI love your channel
I love how these easy, at home recipes are always anything but.
Hi Jemma, thanks for sharing this recipe with us!
Hi Jemma, you're awesome. thanks for all the lovely recipes you are willing to share. \nOne request, can you do a recipe video on black forest cakes or cupcakes????
Caramel are definitely one of the best thing to have ever existed!! Other than that, nougats! Can you teach us how to make them Jemma? Your recipes are all fantastic and I'd love to see one from you! xo
Omg I can't wait to try this
Is it just me, or is anyone else waiting for a halloween episode to come out? I hope she does one this year but no mention of it yet :( i just love themed bakes.
Could you please bring out another cook book with this and all your other great recipes in...Please
I’ve had a think about this before but this recipe confirms it, I genuinely want to marry you.
Get ready to hear a lot of deep, loud inhales.
what happens if u omit the golden syrup?? i think i've seen recipes that don't require it!!\n\nand i guess it wouldn't hurt to add the salt while the caramel is still hot?
I have been waiting dor another caramel recipe!!! Thank you
i subbed and i'm trying to get the best recipe that you have. I'm doing my  cooking assignment, i made up (getting ready for high school) thank you!!!!!!!
This shouldn't be trending at only 12 thousand views -_-
What is this «give it away» thing? Never heard of it, nor «share». Is this what the young hip kids are doing these days?
Would be amazing if u could do a vegan recipe with chocolate!💙
What spray oil to use Gemma
i wish you had a crumbs and doiles in los angeles i would love to taste some of your sweet treats
had to remove the sounds and go with the subtitles because the music is so overwhelming again, too bad - great video and recipe otherwise, looks yummy
i wonder if this could be considered chewy salted caramel chocolate 🤔
Jemma when’s your merch coming out ughhh I really want it ASAP bc it’s so nice xxx
Can you make fudge pleaseeeee! Love your videos
I feel like we should substitute dark chocolate (72%+) instead to cut the sweetness a bit.
Can I use compound
Can you make a upside down cake❤️
Droolin in the night cuz of thizz!! 😂😂😂
as soon as your started wrapping them I knew I wanted to make some for a gift!!!
This had me drooling all over my keyboard
Me:\nWhy am i so fat wtf?!\nAlso me:\nYes that will be 6 quid for those ingrediants!\nSmh.
Who was here before 100 likes
Yum! Can you show us some fudge recipes?
What spray oil to use Gemma
What can be used instead of golden syrup?
Hi Jemma, I'm wondering what exactly is the golden syrup you used, under what other names might I find it? \nThanks and have a great day!
Golden syrup does not exist here in Portugal. how can I substitute the golden syrup?\nBtw, I love your work and you. Thank you for all the delicious recepies that you have been making for us  <3
Jemma likes her chocolate sticky and Salty,   Aroused!
Hi Jemma. Love your channel. I just want to know if it's possible to finish cooling this in the fridge?
can I use a 99% dark chocolate bar? Someone gifted me two bars of 99% chocolate and I have no idea what to use it in!!
Hi Jemma, I am sure this will also be another big hit but I don’t think I have quite enough Golden Syrup. I wish I knew why this was such a difficult item to find here in the USA, the same with Clotted Cream. You would think it was a State Secret! The last time I was in Ireland, I just happened to bring 2 jars of it Home along with a couple packages of REAL SCONES! The scones made here are just biscuits, even the ones at the famous State Fair in Washington. I think they pass as a scone because most Americans haven’t had a true Irish Scone or even British scone for that matter! They don’t know what to look for in texture or taste. It is my goal to get a true Irish Scone into the hand of every person in the State of Washington, (I don’t want to be greedy and say the world, at least until the state is fulfilled then I will move forward from there) hehee. Must make realistic goals right, I mean look at you? You did it! Quite Impressive! I am awaiting an invite to visit to tour your facility and work with you and learn from you and your friends (employees) it would be great craic when and if I came home!
Looks delicious but my teeth hurt from just looking at it
These would make a great edition to the Christmas gift boxes I'm making this year :) I can't wait for your Christmas vids btw! Know you'll have some lovely things for me to make :) x
Hey Jem, where is the best supermarket to buy couverture 53/54% from? Or do you order yours through a whole sales?
Hello Jemma can you please tell me. . Can I use a mini rubber molds to cool the caramel and get deferent lovely shapes of chocolate caramel?
double cream is the same as heavy cream right?
Love that you use non-retard units! 😁 seriously, been loving your channel since the beginning
Does anyone know what the American equivalent of golden syrup is?
Hello everyone, do me a favor and subscribe to Greg Hodel,  once you do it comment Done on his last video and I will susbcribe to you
She doesn't look like she'd be a tattoo person.
Never been so early
Hey Madam Gemma .From where I come from its very difficult to get your hands on  heavy cream. I was wondering if there would be a substitute to that . If there is please inform me. Thank you 💙
Vegan pretty please?
Why do u have those tats
This made me cringe a little
I loved these two vids!  \nShane is a cutie!
aw she's such a sweetheart i'm so glad they reconnected this was genuinely so inspirational ❤️
Listen... I know you will never see this comment.. But.. I related so hard. I fully am with this journey. Good for you for being brave. Here for it. I love you
SHHHAAANNNNEEEE I'M SO PROUD OF YOU DOING THIS VIDEO! I loved it ! Keep on making these amazing videos ! You are so confident and inspiring !! 💝
The part at the end with the music..the sound of the cars.. And can we keep hanging out..? I go cookies! The ones that we used to put on paper and cook, remember? Is just beautiful
Shane is sitting on the left side of the screen instead of the right what the fuck is this opposite day
I’m loving these series 💕
please make this a series
do you wanna keep hanging out? we can like watch documentaries or something together\nok\nok\nok\nok\n\nTHE WAY SHE LOOKED AT YOU AND AWAITED YOUR RESPONSE AND THE PURE HAPPINESS AFTERWARDS AHDJFSDHS IM SOFT I LOVE FRIENDSHIP
This, 18:00, is where I can't hold back my tears anymore.
1:06 is literally me when i see my crush. I already miss him and it's only been 2 days since i last saw him
Good lord lol Just rip his heart out & stomp on it... it would be less painful!
i was in a somewhat similar situation about three weeks ago. i dropped out of school about 2-3 years ago (grade 12) because i've been depressed since about 2010. and i have been in no contact with anyone what so ever. till i found out someone i went to school with for about 10 years committed suicide.. i went to the funeral service. saw so many people from my classes... i got so many hugs that day. i never got that while in school. i hated the fact it was on those terms that i was seeing everyone. but everyone was together again. most were surprised to see me haha. i've been emotionally messed up since. especially because the same night/next day early morning (2 am) my boyfriend attempted suicide while drunk. luckily he lives here with us so i can keep an eye on him. but as im sitting here, i feel this numbness. i keep re imagining that night and i don't know if its pain im feeling.. but its something.
I LOVE THIS IDEA BRILLIANT
you weren't exactly a great friend to her lol...
I honestly think they could be soul mates in a non romantic sense
I love everything about this
I fucking love drama. Like, I know this is a serious thing but I was way too excited to see this video. I watch a lot of dramatic stuff. I love it and I hate that I love it. Y’know?
Why am I the one crying
Oh my gosh i loved this so much h! I couldn't stop smiling through the whole video.
The last clip was so adorable
1:31 for the actual video
I don't know I love Shane but this whole thing to me reeks of use I hate to be that person and no one will see this stupid comment anyway, but the way this has played out feels very manufactured and I don't trust YouTube at all anymore
You shouldn't have posted this yo
Me during the greeting: you can do it shane, beat the fears, be the queen!
i have those nuggets in my freezer
People talking about her “leading Shane on” is kind of ridiculous to me. It sucks that women and men can’t be friends without someone expecting something to happen. She clearly liked Shane as a friend and really misses him as a friend. Shane clearly developed feelings early on but she didn’t it seems very simple.
THIS WAS THE BEST FUCKING VIDEO CUZ I CAN RELATE!!!!
I have always adored you both as youtubers and we never really knew you were friends. And I'm really sorry you guys went through that. But I truly hope you guys can grow a friendship from this now. \n❤️❤️
i always thought he was incredibly gay hahaha
shane u fucken player she's hot as fuck
She's so cute
the end was so cute
Gosh I know how this kind of situation feels from both sides. It’s amazing to see that they are mature enough to reconnect and talk about it. I wish I was  that brave.
Omg that was so cute!!  I hope I see her in more videos ^^
OMG I loooooooved watching blaire's videos when I was younger. Her and Shane were some of my first favourite old school youtubers. Its so strange to think they had a thing together lol
This is probably my favorite video on Youtube haha!
Can you reconnect with the person that you made your break-up vid about?
shane is dad like if agree
I live in Tennessee
Bottom line always be up front with someone period. It's NOT OK to hold hands and be flirty with someone guy or girl if you are NOT interested. That is WRONG and leading someone on. Period.
i swear if they end up dating (which i dont believe will happen) im going to lose my shit
This was so cute and sweet. Looking forward to more ^_^
We all know the real reason Shane cut the video is because he saw ryland coming with a shotgun
Her jacket from old navy 😂😂
Freeze 4:11 both are like yikeeesass what do I do?!!!
At first I thought she said you wanna keep making out?
I’m already emotional cus if what happened to me earlier so I’m already crying on this video. I’m being a little bitch 😢
HIS SHIRT IS MY EVERYTHING YES QUEEN
OKAY BUT THIS WAS SO GOOD AND SO WONDERFUL TO WATCH YOU GO
Me and my best friend (he's a boy) we like to call each other brother and sister just because everyone in school always calls us boyfriend and girlfriend and when someone comes up to us and asks us are you guys dating? And he always says that I'm his sister and then the person thinks we're related and I tell them we call each other brother and sister because I'm an only child and he only has only two brothers and we hate when people call us it because we've been called that for 2 years now and it's like 6 times a day.\n\nThanks for reading I know it's not related to the video but it's just a story that I wanted to tell :)
SHANE YOU CHANGED YOUR NOT FUNNY ANYMORE AND I LOVED WHEN U SAID BAD WORD IM CRY YOU ARE MY LIFE ;(
Blair is THE youtube legend
By any chance........,.....,.,......,..........\nIs he,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, gay ???\nJust wondering.\nIm thinking that if he was to savage-up , he could most likely get THAT back
I found the end really cute 😭
I felt very uncomfortable throughout this video. I wonder how Ryland is feeling.
React to the Google search image results for Shane Dawson memes 😂😍
My life:\n-Overweight throughout childhood (I'm fourteen, and still overweight)\n-Daddy issues\n-Close connection with my mother and grandma\n-Self Esteem Issues\n-Fell in love with my best friend and she didn't return feelings...\nI'm generation 2 Shane, I swear.
18:00 Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who????
SHANE SNAKE PAUL IS COMING FOR YOUR BRAND EXPOSE HIM
I relate to this video so much. I've had a huge falling out with my ex best friend and its making me rethinking of trying to connect again... props to you Shane!!!!!!!
*shane looks like that dad who works at target*
Honestly, I’m not sure if anyone else can agree on this but I don’t see them meshing well together anymore (on close-friend terms.) \n\nI feel like their personalities don’t compliment each other. Maybe I looked too far into it, but I thought that Blair seemed rather uncomfortable when Shane made a majority of his jokes. She often didn’t catch on to his sarcasm (much like some of the people in the comments), or just flat out didn’t like them.\n\nBuuut that’s just my thoughts on it.
I like how after you said don't catch feels you had to literally spit it out of your mouth lololol
What a tool
she is jealous
“Okay...” “Okay” 😭
Yawn
i love this ❤❤❤
We’re gonna fuck... lmfao 😂
I SHIP
Shane's shirt though
There so fucking cute together!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍
WAIT...There's Dolly Parton documentaries? 🤔
Oh. My. God.
this feels so nostalgic???
Skype onision lmaoooo
Shane: We're gonna fuck Blair: Wait what? \nShane:What? \nBlair: What???\n XDDD
FRIENDSHIPGOALS!!
Dead💀💀💀💀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
God, I love Soup Plantation...

11:34 show them show them 😂😂😂
We're gonna fuck ?
This is amazing Shane, I love seeing this side of your life. I can't wait for more! 💕 I love you!
wait ew is he gay now??
kay.. shane is lowkey getting fat again
Finger me like your manually rewinding a vhs tape and throw me like a grenade into the grand canyon
I’m going  watch this video everyday of my life
Looks like many more people embraces the rainbow🌈🦄.
Anyone else get that Michael Jackson Feels in this video it's kinda similar to his The way you make me feel video or is it just me no?
I love it how Hayley looked at her at the phonebooth. Lucky bish. Soooo gayer than ever Hayley. I. JUST. LOVE. IT. Love you my President Hayley, for you I will remain gay for the rest of my life.
if i wasn't in love with her already
THIS IS SO FUCKING GAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE IT!
This video makes me so happy
Looks like The way you make me feel by Michael Jackson, but female version. I love it!!!! Great idea.
Love her style so much!!
yes... this is excellent... very gay...
I just love hayley kiyoko and this song she never disappoints me with her songs!
reminds me of the michael jackson music video for “the way you make me feel” since she was chasing her
This screams Michael Jackson's The Way You Make Me Feel music video vibes! That ow! at the end had to be on purpose. I see you Hayley! Great idea!
Hayley gives the gays what they want and i'm so happy about that😍😍😍
03:11 look at their shoulders.  The way they walk/dance it's synchronized 😍😍 love it
Wow! Well done Hayley, I love it!
So are her songs always gay? I mean don't get me wrong I love them,  just was wondering 😂 lol
HOW IS SHE IN MY GAY ASS BRAIN LIKE THIS
WHY IS THIS SO CUTEEEE????
God I missed u, FUCKING AMAZING SONG
I like the dancing. The song was great, as was the video.
This is one of my favorite Hayley song! I
Robots after people because golem's and sterotypes and there's bases who you are who you could e and how we fill in that shadow outline.....foreight.....my views evil dot believe me....
I wanna have the same hair cut as her ❤️🔥🔥
All I know is that SHE THOCC
This video was nicely shot. But not going to lie - I got dizzy and nauseous after a while from watching it from all the spinning around and around.\n\nOverall really impressive video. Good work!
LEMONADE MOUTH IS Q U A K I N G
Omigosh I can't with Hayley kiyoko rn too talented and amazing for me to handle rn
Every new video she has a new girl... and I'm here single since 2014.
i love being gay
Every time I watch a hayley mv I question if I'm bisexual or gay
Everytime I do or say something lesbian I congratulate myself
shit hayley went from solving mysteries on scooby doo to solving my sexuality
THE SEXUAL TENSION I CAN NOT
I can't get over this video, I swear at least 15k of this vews are me 😍
I'm very gay rn
YES GIRL YOU'RE AMAZING
Remind me The Way You Make Me Feel, from MJ
I can't handle this amount of gayness
this song and gravel to tempo are my favorite songs of hayley i love she so much
i love this video and the song so much
I will be very honest, as a lesbian in a VERY Straight High school, and almost in college it's one, easy to catch feelings , two hard to express those feelings without being judged, and three hard to find a song that expresses those same problems. THANK YOU HAYLEY KIYOKO
This is so good oml
Anyone else get mad when they never kiss?
why are you blue balling us
MY BABY JOEL WORKING WITH QUEENS AND LOOKING LIKE A DAMN SNACK 😭🙏🏼
IM SO PROUD OF HER IVE LOVED HER SINCE LEMONADE MOUTH💛🍋🍋🍋💛
That chick she was with isn't she from that show East Los High 🤔
Producers: So Hayley, what are you requirements for the actor that's going to be playing your love interest in these videos?\nHayley: *don't say Gay and Available don't say Gay and Available don't say-\nHayley: um, Available and Gay?\nHayley: dammit
The girl with the black hair takes out her cellphone when she's in the phone booth....*thinking*
can't stop this feelings 😍😍😍😍😍😉
I love how she ends the video by leaving the girl to enjoy her night. It leaves everyone wanting more and I think it's very artistically done. Great job Hayley!
This is so gay i love it ooooooh
THAT FUCKING SMIRK SHE DOES AT 2:57, MY ASS HAS PLUMMETED
the lesbian icon is back I love my life
Why didn't she go with Hayley at the end 😭😭
I love this video, but I also have so many questions.\n\nWhy does she go into the telephone booth with a mobile?\n\nWhy is Hayley following a person around it what looks to be a deserted gas station at some early hour in the morning? Where is the rest of humanity? Who is this person? Do they know each other? Are all of Hayley’s friends just hanging around waiting for her? Is there a reason they stopped?\n\nAnd why are there two people standing up whilst the car is moving? What about seat-belts and general safe driving? \n\nActually, why are they all there in the first place? Where is this video shot? Is this all in some other dimension where camera angles are just slightly off and everything is not – quite – right?\n\nAnd why did one of the people jump out of the car, grab their skateboard, and then proceed to just stand there? And why are they all wearing headphones? And what’s up with the matching fabric patches? Are they in some kind of gang?\n\nAnd where did Hayley's headphones go?\n\nAnd why doesn't the person put the roof on their car before they go off? AND WHY ARE THERE BUBBLES? AND WHATS UP WITH THE SMOKE/FOG? AND THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING LIGHTING?\n\nWhat are the other stores selling? Why is the road all cracked?\n\nWhErE aRe ThEy????????/?/?/?/??????/??/?
queen of the gays has returned
My gay ass has been blessed
I'm so in love with Hayley Kiyoko that it's insane 😍
that girl seduces me with her eyes alone

It's like I found this at the exact moment I needed it. Like right now, it's speaking personally to me.

I’m sorry but I think Hayley has made me go from bisexual to lesbian 😂
To the 502 people who thumbs down on this\n\n\n\n\n*FUCK U*
I love the song so much! I replayed the video like 8 times and it's the first time I heard it today!

I’m not gay or anything but I would love to have Hayley pin me against a wall and kiss me
What's in the boooox
Who do they think they are pushing him away from talking acting like the boos or something.
This better not ruin the midfield; it's our strongest asset.
It’s like the pig in shreck let meee ggoooo
Let me talk is a new meme now!!!
The other MC PLAYERS are shiter than De Bruyne so they can't really chat
I think he wanted to talk.....
They never let him Talk
stormzy said dont tark , i always used to wonder who tarks and not talk , now i know
He Sounded Like a Girl.
This is the problem with working for Guardiola he tells his players to surround the referee with lots of noise, he did that when he was with uefalona and now he's doing the same trick with Man City. Every player surround the ref with nonsense talk but when KDB wanted talk it was too late, the ref was saturated of seeing players around him and if KDB had approach him to complaint he  would've seeing a card for complain eventhough all he was trying to do was make his point across....
I feel sorry for him
i think de bruyne wanted to talk
The ginger strikes again
Well it is on the channel that said its good too talk.
0:11
He sounds like a baby
Will Kevin De Bruyne ever talk? Find out after the break.
Let the man talk, jeez
I wish these muppets would retake their English O'levels (GCSE's) and learn how to talk.
Just LET HIM TALK!
De bruyne should leave city and go to a better club lol, just angry cuz all city wins are cuz of him
who else came for the comment likes???
I think he wanted to talk.
Rio Ferdinand is a bright lad, isn't he.
Word on the street is that he’s still wanting to talk
Arguments with the wife .... let me talk
Considering how events like these can unfold De Bruyne did at least manage to demonstrate a degree of restraint in his behaviour. While he may come across as having a tantrum, in the context of being in an emotionally charged situation he shows some restraint.
Let him to taaaaalk got damn it 😅😅
Kevin de brune has just signed for real Madrid
Alright De Bruyne dont have a baby cry... USE UR WORDS MAN

Can he talk at Stoke on a rainy night though?
I know that feeling when someone gets in your way.
When the misses starts on a night out
When they don’t understand
All Kevin wanted to do was talk for gods sake
I like the part where he says let me talk
He needs to call childline, I'm sure they will listen
And this is why footballers should never be allowed to speak.
I missed the part where he wanted to talk
This is difficult to watch...
I think he wants to talk Cheers Gary
Something tells me he wanted to talk
Come on now.....let's just sit down and talk about this.
I actually felt bad for det bry
Gary at the end killed me  I think he wanted to talk
Much more dramatic at 0.25 speed
Typical man city no unity built on money no room for passion.

Nice to see the woman in the video being credited in the description. I can listen to the song on my iPhone; I watched the video for the girl.

This interview is FANTASTIC
Didn't realize I could like Gabbie U. more than I already did.
She is truly a Man's woman!!!! If a man likes having his ass eaten by his woman....and she enjoys doing it.. wow let me tell you....she's truly a one in a billion woman. I'm a STRAIGHT man.. who loves women and my lady eats me....lawd... that  feels AMAZING !!!!!! I as well eat my lady's ass...and she can't get enough of it.
I appreciate Gabrielle Union, by why does the world need to know about her booty eating habits? Now if I’m playing D Wade in a game, I’m trash talking the hell out of him. There is something called discretion! SMH
Some of ya'll men need to grow up. SMH
She's a real freak I heard she be tossing d wades salad like a mother fucker
the whole point of this is for whoever is running hollywood to continue to push towards the normalization of child sex and incest.  Why the fuck am I hearing a grown black women WITH A FAMILY WITH YOUTUBE ACCESS get on national radio and talk about when she was 5 she used to fuck teddy bears.... just slowly pushing the idea of children and sex together, the agenda been happening
My name is Sway and I go down. Lolol
You know Oakland niggas were running train on her back in the day.
Gabrielle Union face look like a butt eater.💩
I'm sooo glad Gabrielle touched on the point of sexual repriocity because for so long I felt like I was just a vessel and never needed to really enjoy sex but over time I learned myself and my body & learn what I like. I used to feel ashamed that I was so sexual and wanted certain things, but as a woman we need satisfaction too and that's so important! She speaks on real issues! I just love her! & also people would say that Gabrielle is Bougee but she is not, in the interview it brings to light why she is the way she is and growing up surrounded my mainly Caucasian people she wanted to fit in so bad, but as she grew up she realized BLACK IS SOOOO BEAUTIFUL & she owns it! Especially with Being Mary Jane she brings to light so many issues black women deal with on a daily basis! I look up to her and am so inspired by this woman! ❤️❤️❤️
Reading the title it took me a long time to understand masturbating at 5. I really thought it was a new tv show or something lol. Then it finally hit me oh she masturbated at 5 , then I click on it. I guess I was taking back by that being an actual topic especially at that age. 😞
I love her!!! I love her honesty and realness!!!
That's the Scorpio in her coming out. D-Wade is a fortunate man!
This interview inspires me 2 love Gabrielle Union even MoRe 😍😍💯❤
Amazing how she can be so open about her life and experiences to such a big audience...Very inspiring and influential woman 🙌🏽
She's human. There's crazier 'secrets' out there. It's just shocking to y'all that she's laying it out in the open. Because 99% of us never would, not even to our best friends.
u people are disgusting...christians do anything say anything no rules no ethics..then u say u are going to heaven.......its not wise to worship a dead man........foolish people.
After games she be tellin Dwayne to bring that sweaty ass here boi !!
would eat her for church..gotta stay away from my ass doe
Gabrielle needs a podcast or something.
my name is jordan and i only go down cuz i get to go up
No wonder my man D-wade's knees be shot lol let's goooo D-wade I see you
Once again everyone is soooooo fascinated on what people do behind close doors.\nI guess I'm old school and I keep my privacy.....private.\npeace.
so what she saying is she been low-key eating Dwayne ass
What about the women who lie???????? I've had women who lied on me several times and I didn't try to do anything. I could've lost my life and everything........
Gabrielle Union is a role model.
A dirty spirit is the reason why she can't produce children...I'm just gonna say it.
I feel like she's referring to Waste Deep's audition lol
Gil is also pro whore and pedophile!!! He is trying to justify in the comments!!! See passed this weirdos lies!!
All these prude people in the comment section saying, ewww gross yet they have never tried it before, hahah how can you say something is gross when you have never tried it before... Hmmmm
Great interview! I am gonna miss the show Being Mary Jane.
The ONE of most stupid,boring,uninteresting,unexpected subject I heard on radio
Lmao so basically she was a bop 😂👌🏼 still bad af
hold up...whatt!!!....alotta west indian man dont do what..lol...i dnt no not 1 west indian man dat dont.....dey kinda hafto we caribbean girls demand it..lol....vc..784
Love Scorpio Women in the bedroom, but outside the bedroom, not so much.
50 cent was talking bout his show is better than empire
I hope ppl don't get stuck on her sexual fluidity..when given the floor to really talk about relevant issues she was spitting knowledge especially towards the end of the interview..Much respect.
this #metodd or in my case #tailgrabb to #nosebone you been raped with out BAD outcome for the rapsit YOU NOT MY KIND OF GIRL period
Fawwwwk noooo I'm not eating no grown ass man's ass. Wtf any man like his ass played with SUSPECT. Industry niggas weird.
I literally stay in Pleasanton now that's crazy
Gab is a SAVAGE....a lovely, beautiful, incredible SAVAGE
Babies explore their bodies and they usually find their places of pleasure. No big deal. Relax people.
Damn, Gabrielle is a freak!  I would love to hit that shit!
wow im in awe of this lady
Gabrielle Union is my new crush her intellect and wisdom is awesome
Gabrielle can't get it like a repeated driveby! Just thought I'd put it out there 💯
Thank you for that Awesome segment..
Did I read that right??
Women seem to be a lot more exploratory with their bodies at an early age than men
She could pass for Monique's little sister.
SHE WAS A  LIL HOE
straight up, doin that type of thing at such a young thing isn't even a surprise, i think people just don't like to talk about it
love love love Gabrielle U... Keep speaking and walking in truth.  You represent the beautiful intelligent successful black woman well... Continued blessings in your journey!
Great interview, I just love her let us know what you will be working on next.
NOT A BIG DEAL MASTERBATING YOUNG. I HOPPED ON A COUCH AND IT FELT GOOD. NOT ASHAMED LOL STOP FRONTIN FOLKS
Sway you eat pound cake?
Sway hit the Benny snake eyes Wilson groan😂😂
Poor Michael Eley is kissing D.W.s ass
I like her.
This interview was good. I love garibella union, I didn't until I watched being Mary jane. She played a what being a black woman is about. So real. \nI judge union when I didn't really know her. I am getting that book. \nSway's questions were great
She out here eatn booty.. I can't believe this crap! I don't wanna hear that shit
She's 45
15:56 sway was serious asf 😂😂😂
FUCKIN WHORES. MGTOW IS THE FUTURE!!!
Outstanding interview
How sway
Sway funny😂😂😂
Good Interview
GREAT interview!!
So Dwayne wade eats ass
😂🤣😭😭😭I’m FKN 💀☠️
I love how open and honest she is..  But I have to ask..  Are there any actors who had a kissing scene with Gabrielle looking at this video crazy when she talked about eating booty..😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
A woman taking about sexual things in public just makes her look like a hoe
Dwayne is gay! and Gabriel is a freaking weirdo! Aint no way shape or form, a man want's any kind of anal play! PERIOD!
i don't know rather to be erect or turned off at her masturbating at 5
Gabrielle seem like she was a hoe growin up i bet she fucked madd dudes jus cuz they liked her and they were black cuz she wanted black dudes to like her do bad
Gab is beautiful and confident ❤to be so open and honest is the greatest thing to be. Only few people can respect her maturity and   as a black women on a platform. She is AMAZING and she knows it!!!!!!!
Scorpio Behavior - Gabrielle Union..😝😝😝.  Suburban parents ...if your child is the only black child at his/her school....listen to her words about invisibility....
Y'all hatin niggas acting like you didn't touch yourself at a young age or eat some booty low-key. 😂😂 That ain't nothing new, she just got the balls to say it.
My name is JAY .. & I go down 😂 \n\n#Liberated
my name is sway, and i go down i'm deaad
Wtf is wrong with this world!!! Americans😪😪
Bay Area Love <3
#209 #Stockton... carry on.... ✌🏾🖤
I Love her
Bosssssss!!!
Amazing interview. #BlackGirlMagic
“As per the prenup” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Team Gabrielle
Real talk Gabby
IDK why people are surprised about masturbating at 5..Little kids hump things all of the time...it's awkward af when you catch them though.
This is truly sick and just sad. The world wants you to believe that everything is alright as long as it feels good NO this os just wrong! People out here need to get saved! At least read your Bible to see what's really right & what's really wrong. DO NOT LOOK UP TO THESE PEOPLE IN HOLLYWOOD! Instead look up to a righteous one. This world is sick & I cry for it. :(
Gabrielle Union lived the normal life of a suburban black person, specifically suburban black woman!
Plastic silverware when eating at the Wade's house
so were all here for the same reason then
That’s natural at that age. You don’t have to witness anything “inappropriate”. Your body reacting to maybe playing on the playground and the feeling was liked. Y’all know baby boys get hard in the womb... we all know in the womb they aren’t seeing anything sexual.....
D-Wade - Celie,  LeBron -Netti
This is why western society is churning out whores like a conveyor belt. The sexually immorality being praised in this comments section is hilarious.
uhm...who would ever date a man that doesn't go down???? lol or is embarrassed by it? wth!
It's good to know that joe rogan would put his dick on his son's face. Dont believe me? watch this video ;)
The joe Rogan fantasy factory , does that mean that redban is coming back 🤔
The wisdom tooth thing he’s so right. I had mine taken by cook county. Just ripped it out with a Novocain shot. I was eating same day, talking with only a slight lisp for a day
D Fitzsimmons have Parkinsons or something? He's shaking like a 90yo :/
That whole story about the fingering lady needs to get animated.
Great Podcast, except you're wrong about 'bots'. Educate yourself about Shareblue, the ACLU, etc. etc. and come back to me about 'bots'.
Jamie u gotta tell joe to stop looking at the camera. So weird
Whatever you gotta do Joe... get Tosh or Chappelle to sit down with the almighty master of conversations. Its about time man.
Charlie Sheen is most likely one of the main guys feldman is after. High up producers etc, yes, but Sheen was the one to rape corey haim when he was just a little boy on the set of Lucas. Haim and feldman said JUST enough over the years that people could easily figure it out.
Joe I got rid of my Elvis and Hendrix wallart for some reason Rogan
maybe there's a little toilet paper next to it!
Joe has apparently smoked away his ability to sound out words.
Greg Fitzsimmons just came off as a massive hyprocyte by claiming those people should be naming names to save other children but won't name names himself, good game bud
@32:55 I love how, eeevery once in a while, you get to watch a joke go zinging right over Joe's head.
Not wanting to talk about it for fear of getting sued is part of the problem. These people need to be exposed. Fear keeps them in operation.
Joe Rogan is amazing. Dude is so smart. My new favorite show to listen to.
Purple is associated with royalty because originally the dye was incredibly expensive, and so it was used as a symbol of wealth. In England there are a few schools with royal charters from centuries ago, and they are (or at least were) the only ones allowed to wear purple uniforms.
People who accuse others of cultural appropriation are essentially admitting they themselves are racists. What they are saying is You don't have this color of skin therefore you aren't allowed to do this and that is exactly what racism is.\nYou don't have this color of skin therefore you have to sit at the back of the bus = You don't have this color of skin therefore you can't do this with your hair or clothing. Exactly the same.
Love your show joe!!!! Keep it up!!!!
finally there's some slack on the mic cords, they looked so tight around the bending point before it stressed me out.
That room looks like it’s a cold temperature 🤒
Joe he found his mom dead when he was on acid Rogan.
Joe prince played a major part in my life Rogan
what the fuck why would you have your prostate removed
POSTER'S , WHERE THE POSTERS , OR PICTURES OF GUESTS , FROM THE NEW POD SPOT , SO THIS WOULD BE NUMBER ONE GUEST , WITH A STAR FOR GOOD , GREAT AND CLASSIC .  JUST THOUGHTS , DEFINITELY SOMETHING ON BACK BRICK , MAYBE A COLOUR DIFFERENT IN EVERY BRICK .
I have a male Silver Catahoula Leopard Hound. He's the best dog I've ever had but he is mischievious as hell. You ought to check em' out they are cool dogs. Greyhound, Red Wolf Dog, and Mastiff mix.
What happened to the studio? Is this a new place or they redecorating?
It's called competitive job market they don't care about benefits for the employee.
Some veterans with PTSD use emotional support dogs.
Greg I'm not ready for a dick,but I'll take a pencil  Fitzsimmons
Cultural appropriation is literally anti-liberal. It's a very tribalistic, conservative inclination to segregate.
Women use to be fired for getting pregnant. That's what the maternity leave was to protect against
sumaehs thought so king... is a bitch!!
Devil's Advocate: What if those Russian accounts are left accounts trying to basically double agent? I mean think about it, an account spreading fake news about Hillary, and conveniently leaving its location on. Just enough to be obviously suspicious, but not enough to be blatant. \n\nReally, it can go either way in my opinion as I don't know what's going on, but it's just something to think about.
... I need to go there LOL i died
Doesn't Joe looked stoned?!!! lol
Joe human poo stats rogan
Joe WOAHgan
Coyotes are’nt wolves Joe.
Found coyote was a hoax. https://www.snopes.com/coyote-given-bath-mistaken-dog/\nFunny tho.
Joe  its not cultural appropriationrogain
Who would watch a Joe Rogan VLOG?
1:24:28 McCaulay Culkin?
Pedo joke? WTF??? Joe Rogan ...not cool.
That brickwork is awful
(((greg)))
boring brick wall is boring
I like the SoberJoe Rogan.
Joe I got this puppy Rogan
1k dislikes? must be reverse discriminasche
I thought he said he's been having good sex lately..
no female on here is going to point out the fact that Joes eyes are pretty when he's sober? fine. ill do it.
Support the 2nd Amendment!!
Joe Joe.. You bore me Joe!
Can we get a tour of the studio when it's done?
Rogan always likes to carry himself like a well educated philosophical man but he's just another bum most of the time, why must they go on about how they think this guys weird when he was raped and molested as a child. Did they expect him to magically grow into someone similar to themselves even though they experienced tremendous trauma while their brain was developing and while they were learning what the world was and what normal is. Fucking idiots , the whole hide behind hey we're comedians we get a pass  or it's a joke line works when you have common sense but for fucks sakes don't ponder as to the guys behavior, let him be, seems like a decent guy, why shit on him, he doesn't need grown men acingt like children talking about him
Fake Ai people are the root of the problem Joe Rogan.
(referencing the gender wage gap and risk taking/injury on the job)  I am making gross generalizations, a lot of women are MMA fighters no Joe, that's 0.0001% of women in the workforce and  I am overestimating.
gillary sold 20 % of us uranium to russia... yet somehow trump? wtf joe wtf.
wait can we go back to where he just skipped past 'its like your first orgasm after having your prostate removed' and joe nonchalantly said yeah and transitioned like it never happened?
Joe  there's for sure  Rogan
joe your gonna be high as F***! lol
Need to soundproof that room. The echo. With headphones. Don't like. Also have an amazing day. Bless up from the feet up.
he actually said it
Joe please get Corey Feldman on the podcast
We respect you, but you’re a piece of shit if you don’t expose the person.
Hi Joe, this is kind of a random comment and I don't know if you'll ever see it. Have you ever seen the video of the guy who was hunting deer with an original Civil War musket?
Joe just couldn't  remember  the pedo ' s name!? Oh darn they never can remember  the names, didn't  even try to look it up or anything. You think  something  that important  he would try a lil  harder, these people
Your falling off the podcasts bro need more content !
greg has almost the same laugh as bill burr; not just me right?
Does Greg have early Parkinsons? With the shaking. Am i off on that?
Who had that laugh first Bill Burr or Greg?
Get Ido Portal on the podcast!
where's elvis? where's hendrix & co. ?
Chris Stokes is the other pedo.... he banged Marcus Houston and B2k 😂
If you think the bots are one sided you are retarded

I'll go nuts if he doesn't show us round the new pad! Hyping it up but no show..boo ! 😚
In regards to the n word statement and word. Irish people were originally called the Green Niggers and Lepracoons, because the Irish were cheaper slaves than the black slaves!
Watch Unacknowledged on netflix it's a conspiracy that claims to have proof about aliens and stuff , Eddie Bravo would love it , you might like it too
goodness... this podcast is so much more funny whilst heavily stoned on gorilla glue
Would be cool to see a tour of the studio
Joe dropped straight Truth Bombs this episode!!!! Fuck outrage culture!!!!
Greg The Titty Man Fitzsimmons
Tom hanks wtf sort your kid out lol

Joe _Anti-inflammatory_ Rogan
1:33:47  lmfao
Fuck these niggers
I agree with Joe regarding the type of “cultural appropriation” complaints he cited.  There however there is a real evil and methodical cultural appropriation going in the world and beyond the stupid superficial shit worn or eaten.  Sometimes it’s a life or death battle for certain groups and peoples.  Fir example, Israel claiming Palestinian/Lebanese/Syrian cuisine and calling it Israeli.  There is nothing wrong ng with Jewish or even Israelis cooking and selling Hummus but to call it Israeli food while at the same time staunchly claiming that the was never a Palestinian people or culture is a completely different thing and that is what the term cultural appropriation was made for originality, not a fucking hair style or stupid earring or a food.  Nobody is trying to burry Mexican people and history after they took their land.  I like Joe Rogan calling stupid shit out, but I was he was informed rough or cared to find out cases when the concept is legit.
where the fuck did Joe go to school, some of his knowledge is on the piss!!
2:27:46 😂😂😂
Greg looks like junior soprano
My GF says its a proper Cracker...
Great video! We miss you George
Tris is my unofficiai video I have make first, do u like? https://youtu.be/rmo9BCoHCkk
love it. still love you George. as much as ever x
Interesting compilation of clips. Like a thumbnail of the TwentyFive DVD, which showcases the many sides of George. Think I'll put that on now!
I still miss you George.
I like it though
Wow this video is fantastic ❤️❤️❤️
❤️GM. Makes me sad he's gone. This video was lots of fun though
It's about time!
Love George Michael but this is not one of his better songs....r.i.p.
Coolest video ever! \nLoved every second!\nTotally George! \nThanks SOOOOOOO much GM Vevo! My heart is so happy!\nBRAVO! perfection❌⭕️💋
Love the classic vibe with modern dance sound
Died too soon he had so much more to give we lost an icon. Not many icons left in the world.
This is the best video I've ever seen. Period. Such energy!
amazing.\nGeorge is missing you.
I miss you George 😞
this is on trending a dead man is on trending
I’ve only really started listening to George’s Music after I heard his death but I knew of his music because my mum was a big wham! Fan and I have become a big fan of this legend and his legacy will live on R.I.P George 😭 #Freedom #Withoutprejudice
December 25th 2016 will always be the day George Michael forgot to wake us up to tell us, in a single, careless whisper, that he had to go go. We'll remember him through his beautiful songs that made the '80s and still help us on our way from the living room to the bedroom so we never need one more try.\nGeorge, through many flawless December songs to come, have faith that we will never let the sun go down on you, whether you became a cowboy or an angel. Please heal our pain, as you go through the white light to become a star.
There's no other way out...even now...his energy is contagious and makes my life! Glory to George!
it does show on spotify that the song in that playlist is from an album by george michael, released october 20, 2017
Love it,love you george Michael
OMG I LOVE remix ....made me cry like he was still alive making more music
George Has Been,,and Always Will be My Favorite Artist, 35 years ago I was a kid hearing Wham U.K.! Fantastic. My life was happy knowing his music would always be there,.LOVE You George💞💝🌹❤
omygoodness ! the world has lost a very special man . I still cannot believe it . Lots of love George , we all miss you
💜💜💜 this. Miss you George ❤
You will always be in our hurts big bro lets get to 1k likes
Pretty much one of the greatest singer songwriters of my generation. Thank you for creating this, I know it truly must have been difficult after George’s passing. For those that haven’t watched it. Watch the latest movie of George Michaels life. It’s amazing. Full of pain and love
Wait, this isn't the George Michael Bluth I was looking for...
And what is clear you just couldn't believe I really didn't want you anymore in my life.
I want George or Carrie or Bowie or Chester or Chris or Prince or at least SOMEONE to come back from the afterlife and be our Honey Mustard from Sausage Party who’d try and warn people why no one is coming to save them from impending WW3
Am I still in 2017?
Such a awesome version.... Nile has done a great job
Everyone loosen your arsehole with poppers this is gunna be good.
I JUST LOVE THIS! Thank you David, Nile.. everyone who obviously worked so hard on it. Love and miss you forever, Yog xxx #georgemichael #georgemichaelfreedom #listenwithoutprejudice
Have you heard of Rob Lombardi?! I think they made a clone. And I'm not kidding folks. And he actually did some fill-in work for George when George wouldn't do the promotion. They hired Rob Lombardi
I like this a lot, thanks Nile, I wanted to listen to more George after watching his film tonight on TV, he had his troubles but what an artist, one of the best voices the UK has ever produced,  you will be missed Rest In Peace George xx
I have just watched his film on TV, and feel very sad for us all we have lost a great talent far too soon, Rest In Peace George x
This is edited very well. But it's just to sad to think about the fact that George is gone. I'm only 21 and I don't think there will ever be another artist who can match what GM accomplished in the music industry. 💔
That Nile Rodgers always adds that bit extra,with his CHIC sound.....
It's like he's alive!
2:16 (from Spinning the Wheel) is so badass cool. He was so gorgeous. He just didn't see it.
he will never be gone.in are hearts and minds forever. as he said this will never be repeated so for him is dream as come true. we love and truly miss  one special talented man. GM for history and future xx
Aww love it! Will love this man forever. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ 💋
Love it, miss you George rest easy up their in heaven
My mum said you died but your alive 😱😱😱😱😱😱
How was this made if he’s sadly not alive?....
So he came back to life
Some things are better left alone
I think he's stuck in the 90s
Beautyfull man George!!!!brings always joy to me ...R.I.P. my LOVE, you live in my heart
George will always be number one for me...I love his music, she is immortal♥
I took a shit near his house
This video would have been great with just a medley of live performances throughout his career  :) He used to say himself that from time to time it's good to have one like that (Monkey, Everything She Wants).
Nostalgic!!! There is only one George.  No one like him, now and forever.
I watching this 1mio in replay😍
OMG This so cool I fan girl let get this to trending to 1
144p video quality for full nostalgia effect.

this fudgepacker not got aids yet..
wait how they do this he dead the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
This is retarded. Who do you think will be paying the government to do your taxes for free for you? You! The government only has the money it steals from you in the first place, dummy.\n\nSo instead of just paying some company for a service, you now get to pay taxes for government buildings, employees and infrastructure in addition to paying for that service.\n\nGreat job not accounting for the cost of government like some idiot socialist who thinks free shit just falls like manna from the sky, Adam.
Weird thinking how the guys who created Bonzi Buddy also created Tru TV.
No one can tell me Taxation isn’t theft at this point
That's it. I'm moving
Wait... I'm supposed to pay taxes?
Wow. That's informative. And depressing.
That pizza delivery analogy would be more accurate if it was a pizza you never ordered.
They don't have to suck because there is actually no law written stating one HAS to file income tax.
I feel like all of the problems in America would disappear if lobbying wasn't a thing
I ship Emily and Uncle Sam
Yet another reason not to live in the USA...
Taxation is extortion
Taxes suck because taxation is theft
Holy shit I hate this goverrnment\nLobbying being legal is reason alone to move out
Let’s sum this up in 4 words: \nThe government sucks balls. \n\nI believe the federal government should be as small as it can be, without having a revolution. \n\nA quote I heard somewhere: \n\nGuy: “We need the government because people are evil and we can’t rely on them” \n\nOther guy: “The government is made of people.”
We are just modern day slaves. The government owns us and has and always will.
adam, can you just shut up?
That free tax filing program has not been around that long. What prevented this idea during Regans time? Taxes are bullshit anyhow. I Adam was going to do the whole taxation is theft thing.
wait a video that has nothing to do with race gender or sexual orientation god is truly merciful.
Lobbying is the worst type of cancer you Americans have to face. It poisons and cripples down almost anything I can think of that can be exploited by rich corporations. Start a revolution, you guys have more than enough reasons to.
I will do my own taxes. They can’t do shit right.
Owh god it seems college humour is lost.
I thought you were going to actually spread some real truth,  like taxes are wrong in almost all instances and everyone is charged by the government entirely too much.
it would be easy for the government to caculate a basic w2 income but for people who 1099 or own llc it be alot more complicated. and also I write alot of shit off that thr irs doesnt know about untill i turn in my taxes
Dear Adam Conover,\nYou're not funny, you're not informative and you have the wit and wisdom of an televangelist preacher or an employee of Info Wars. Everything you say is a painfully poor and cringe-worthy attempt at humour as spew a bunch of half truths and facts that you probably memorised from a cereal box. How your insufferable nonsense ended up trending on this website is beyond any semblance of reason and comprehension. It's people like you that are that the reason why this channel has competently gone to shit these days.
Hey cool an Adam ruins everything clip that's doesn't call me a racist. Nice
It's only difficult if you're a complete idiot
Or... we get rid of it because it's FREAKING THEFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not to mention that when you get money back on our taxes all that means is the government took too much and screwed you out of the money you could have made investing that for the duration they were stealing it.
Wow, a whole video about why you're too lazy to do your own taxes. Interesting CollegeHumorless, interesting.
Dagnabbit this is why we can’t have nice things
This is why I don't bother getting a job. Taxes. \nWhy do something if you have to give back to the same people you are trying to steal from?
The United States also has a gun fan club making decisions regarding firearm laws and regulations. Is every political sector in the US controlled by fan clubs and companies? You guys need to get your government straightened out.\nMaybe having too many freedoms is a bad thing when it means the freedom to screw yourselves. Hey, maybe some of those old government documents written before electricity and modern civilization are wrong too. The sooner these silly American values are discarded the sooner you'll start looking and acting like a modern developed nation like the rest of us who made it out of the 1800's.
I don't trust a paper pusher in D.C. to do my taxes. Just look at how well the VA works. I want to get it right the first time, and you get a deduction on whatever you spend on your tax preparation anyway.
ummmm, this is the dumbest thing yet... The IRS does not have all my information, they have no idea what my deductions are.\n\nI bought new cameras this year, I did maintenance on my vehicles, I took multiple business trips, tons of packages were mailed out, I added on to my office building, hired 2 staff members, ran ads online, etc etc etc....
Adam Ruins YouTube... This needs to happen
Taxation is theft. The government claims it owns my hands, my mind, my work, my property and success. It does not, only I own those, hence taxation is theft.
The easiest solution is to have no taxes!\n\n\n\n\n\njk, thats a terrible idea
In the Netherlands, this Return Free Filing has been introduced a few years ago. The first year they were messing numbers up, so you had to double check. But the following year (and so on) are spot on. Filiing tax returns takes about 10 minutes. Not the 5 as Adam suggests.
It is funny why out taxes go to supplement car companies like GM after we bailed them out and lost  billions when government dumps there stock while the same government will kick an 80 year old woman out because of late property taxes. Real funny ?
Nothing for our interest just theres
come on man I work at a tax store don't tell em its a scam XD
*The Federal Mafia, by Irwin Schiff* - read it. A book which explained how federal income tax is technically illegal, was banned in a country with free speech, and resulted in the author dying in prison over it.
In austria taxes are payed before you get your money...so you get your money after taxes are already withdrawn. at the end of the year you can check your taxes at an online site and tell check some boxes and fill some forms to get some money back.
Wow. Lots of people don't understand the purpose of taxation under a fiat currency. Look up Moser and the Purpose of Taxation here on YouTube.
i'd rather do taxes myself, i would never trust the gov/IRS to decide how much i overpaid them. i'm pretty sure i would get hardly anything back.
Yet another reason why capitalism is fucking bad!
i think theres just a little disregard for what is actually free in this video, even if the government did it for us wouldnt that involve increase in irs budget? (sell that one) if you just want to be socialist you can just say it lol
It's easy to say the government could handle it, but the IRS has been losing talent and receiving reduced funding for years. They need money, but they are really easy to hate.
Wow this one really got me upset, so much so that I had to contact someone about it.\n\nSo I spoke with an enrolled agent, and while it sounds great to have the IRS do your taxes for you, the big issue isn't the income, it's the deductions.  Because of the the varying deductions people can have that the IRS knows nothing about (charity giving as an example) they can't figure out exactly what you owe.  \n\nI know the end of that part of the segment kind of suggested that we could correct it, but that is apparently why audits happen, because people take deductions they can't prove.  The filing is to make you prove your deductions.\n\nJust wanted to add some additional information from what I learned talking to someone about it.  Really wish it was that easy.\n\nAnd screw the companies lobbying to keep it hard so they can make money.  That is BS.
I asked this question like 15 years ago when I did my first taxes.  Why is the US so ass backwards.
Meh, this isn't the real reason why taxes suck. Taxes suck because there is way too much taxation going on and IMHO, Income Tax is theft.
This show is depressing. Literally everything is a fucking scam or other corrupt bullshit. We all fell asleep at the wheel. This country is on its way down. Be sure to high five a Roman emperor on the way out
And nothing is going to change dope.
And Americans are shouting to the rest of the word : You're a bunch of corrupt people, not me. Ah! The foul stench of double standard is in the air.
This comment section is full of dumbasses, we need our taxes, if we didn't play taxes then how would we keep our roads in good condition, buildings wouldn't be up to code cause the government can't pay to inspect, we wouldn't have police officers fire fighter, and welfare for the illegals. We need taxes
Trump's new tax plan actually could help solve this issue. Simpler taxes could lead to businesses like H&R Block going out of business.
Thought CollegeHumor would go libertarian there for a second \nBut no they're still dirty statists
The guy in the thumbnail looked like Gordon from Sesame Street
you know, there is a price to pay when you're a greedy person. the price you might pay is your life. my question is. how hungry is the government for money? enough to start a war?
Turkey used this system up until 2008. US is still using that shitty system? Funny
Sorry Adam they just want you to make mistakes so they can kick your ass all through the justice system and fine the shit out you.
This is one of the few episodes I like, and agree with.
This would also massively cut down on fraud since a criminal can't file for you.
Can we just kill all of the lobbyists? Please?
The only things Adam consistently ruins are reason, sound research practices, and masculinity.\n\nHere are a few reasons he's wrong (as usual) this time:\n\n1. Government preparation of returns would require payers of income—employers, financial institutions, even governments writing benefits checks—to incur costs by significantly moving up reporting deadlines for the IRS to get the information in enough time so that tax refunds are not delayed. Advocates of return-free filing conveniently ignore these third-party costs. A study or two has suggested that third-party costs would range from $500 million to $5 billion annually and would fall disproportionally on small businesses and therefore indirectly benefit the bigger corporations with which small businesses must compete.\n\n2. The IRS is a lumbering behemoth. Its computer systems have long been plagued with problems and cost overruns, as pointed out by the Government Accountability Office and others. A 2003 Treasury report found that under the current complex tax code, providing taxpayers with pre-filled returns would add to the workload of the IRS. Clearly, additional investment in staff, equipment and facilities would be required... which would require, you guessed it, higher taxes to pay for.\n\n3. Checking your government-prepared tax return for accuracy would take about the same work and time as preparing your own from scratch. Unless you're going to just trust them to be 100% accurate and honest, what's the point?\n\n4. He looks like just like the Adoring Fan from Oblivion.\n\n5. Taxation is theft.\nlolololol i said it too XD
People wonder why people are kneeling for the anthem. Shit we do everything wrong in this country😂
Taxes were never fun to begin with
The govt doesn't do anything for free.  It pays people to do things.\nDuh.
probably wouldn't work. tax laws are just too complicated. it could work for simple employees but not for the other groups
Why don't you Americans just move to Europe? It's easy here in Denmark.
Anonymous takedown of Freefile and Turbo Tax please? Destroy their business around the end of March and get a big deal made out of it :)
I live in Japan. The government sends me my taxes by post, I go to the convince store and give them the money and it's all finished.
Do Adam ruins wheat
V
Less taxes = smaller government
Ha ha ha Americans...
Taxation is theft.
don't vote Democrat.
Boycott, Boycott, Boycott.
Taxation is theft
Jejejejeje
Taxation is theft
Taxation is theft.
Taxation is theft.

Libertarian heven)

Next: Adam ruins feminism
L\nLl\nK. .
Adam ruins income taxes... oh wait, income taxes ruin EVERYTHING!
Shithole US 😑
I swear I already seen this
kill em all .....
Taxation is theft.
This is the process we have in the uk. Unless your self employed the government just takes your taxes automatically. If u pay to much tax once a year u will get a tax rebate. It works just fine.
There is no underlaying law that dictates a person has to pay taxes.  Yet you are forced to pay taxes to the IRS so they may be able to pay national debt to the Federal reserve.  The Federal reserve is a privately owned bank that works like a corporation, but has the legal ability to print us money, but in turn, charges the US to do so.  In turn, this raises the debt owed.  The US is not allowed to audit the Federal reserve for any means or reason.  \n\nI'm truth, the modern tax system is theft upon the US individual.  There is no reason for there being tax codes being more than 74k pages.  You are forced to pay a tax amount against your will even though there's no true law stating that not filling your taxes is against the law.\n\nThe Federal reserve is part of this issue.  \n\nTaxation upon our populace caused a war once before.\n\nA president caught the mainstay of Banks and one.\n\nIt will happen again.
TAXATION  **IS** THEFT!    \n\nour natural rights precede the powers of government.  Therefore if you have property, like a paycheck, it belongs to you.  For anyone, including government, to take any part of your property without your full consent is theft.\n\nAnd for them to threaten your life, liberty, property, or pursuit of happiness unless you give them what they ask for  (sounds like organized, crime, ya?) is extortion.
I love the UK more and more each day
That is one fucked up Country you yanks have. In the UK it's entirely automatic unless you are earning income from investments, even then it's really simple.
SUCH. A. GREAT. TRAILER. Can't wait!
1:59\nThis guy is ridiculously excited to be featured in Blue Planet II.
Footage looks unreal, beyond excited to watch this.
Thank you so much!!!
The photographic quality is incredible
I wish our planet was actually this peaceful...
Thank you to everyone involved in making this
I love this! The BBC and Hans Zimmer deserve such kudos for an amazing piece of work! I can hardly wait until this arrives!
This kinda looks like the short film on my channel. Check it out and let me know what you think
kinda makes you feel less siginificant, we really don't own this world, there is way more than our 7 billion + lives going on around us
Marine biology rules! I can't wait to see this!
Amazing. How is it that we can't seem to protect and preserve all of that ? Ridiculous...
I NEED to know if this will be available in 4K UHD
Such an amazing planet we live on. May we always push ourselves to keep clean and healthy. ✌ 💘 🌎
Love the diverse colours! Looks excellent on my new TV. Could not imagine what it looks like in person!
Is the music by Hans Zimmer? I am watching/listening to it on repeat since this video was published I absolutely can’t wait to own the music too.
I will never understand humanities need to destroy the natural world. We truly are unredeemable in a lot of ways.
Lest we forget about one particular species while we appreciate many others, only one species makes such wonderful films (and makes all the technology & energy that makes the film possible--and our free time possible): the human species.
when will this feature?
Blue Planet was beautiful to watch & even listen 2 so this will b as breath taking as the 1st one, cant wait 😀🌹
Hopefully you guys redo the BBC The Planets documentaries as well, I still have the VHS box set somewhere lol
Your videos are the best.. Hands down.. 😍
Having just spent four years studying the environment at university, I know that my awe of these series’ will be slightly diminished by the devastation of the losses endured since the first time around.
*B  R  E  A  T  H ... T  A  K  I  N  G*
Thankyou for putting a disadvantage nonbinary transgender homosexual democratic minority sea lion of color in the thumbnail.
Just got goosebumps from how amazing this looks!! Thank You Mother Nature for creating amazing creatures!!

They Call me David Arranborough for a reason he's my mentor and this shall be added to the dvd collection, the best thing to happen this year :D
I had chills throughout this entire video. The music combined with the footage is simply awesome, in the literal sense of the word.
This trailer reminds me of the Planet Earth II trailer. So beautifully filmed.
Awesome picture, can’t wait to see the whole series
As long as David Attenborough is narrating, I'll be happy.
Send pictures of star Turtle
When will you telecast it in India?? Can't wait to watch it.
It’s incredible thanks BBC
This is so amazing😊

Did anyone else go “nemo!” when the clownfish showed up?
I just love life in the ocean
Just wow... cool trailer.. can’t wait...
Movie quality all day! How do they do this???
U can take a screenshot on any of the scenes and use it as your wallpaper
This video felt like it was an hour long, it was amazing
this trailer has me so exited!
Absolutely amazing! This will be in 4k or full HD?
Biology meetings about to get lit!
Its so Terraiffic, I can't wait two sea it. :D
Our planet is truly wonderful. We take it for granted all of the time. The life residing here is truly amazing.
The sponsor for this better be Kleenex. Outside of seeing our planet from space, there is no better view than this. Outstanding!\nPeace!
This trailer makes me wanna be a marine scientist, and I’m terrified of the ocean
SO STOKED I LOVE THE ADVANCEMENT IN CAMERA & UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD
Oh hell yea am I ever hyped for this.

Y deseo y espero que Ella mi tierra,\nSiga siempre siendo así de hermosa.
El único canal que veía en tv. Y une me lo quitó ya no lo tiene disponible.
Thank God there isnt any biring radiohead music in this one. I prefer hans zimmer
Let's hope it wont be half CGI made like Planet Earth 2 this time.
I don't think this could have come at a better time. I think I'll stop worrying about politics for a good while now.
doesn’t look like climate change to me
Now let's see Bruce do a Billy Joel impression.
Omg. I LOVE Joel dictating chords to Paul. Wonderful!
No Billy we're good tonight - Springsteen
I like that song too. That and Jungleland are OPERA.
All hail King Joel
Meeting Across the River is the prelude to Jungleland  off Born to Run.  Atmospheric indeed.
Billy Joel out here lookin’ like Walter White after his first Mill.
Don’t you hate it when someone puts a comment up you wish you wrote
and remember, just dont smile.....change your shirt...cause tonight, we got style
I'm a little stunned that Paul couldn't find Meeting Across The River in his memory. An epic piece only for piano.\nSadly, that moment from JK played out more like the boys from Spinal Tap trying to recall Heartbreak Hotel!
Billy Joel has turned into my 👴.\n\nLove this guy!
Its was a good thing DJ Whoever was not doing the music or he would have been schooled by Billy Joel.
Meeting Across The River is probably the best crime film never made. Such a great song. A noir rock song.
Billy Joel is a legend
1:49
it's surprising that Tunnel of Love is so rarely mentioned among the best Springsteen songs... I'd be honored if some Billy Joel fans would check out my acoustic piano & vocal covers of his classic compositions ALLENTOWN and VIENNA on my channel in tribute to the master. Real live acoustic with no autotune. Thanks and please excuse the promo.
I want to know what he said after he said he didn't pay for tickets - not a good spot to cut it off!
Watching jimmy try so hard to make his uncomfortable audience laugh is why this country doesn’t work anymore
First
I saw Bruce Springsteen two nights in a row on the Born in the USA tour in 1985. We loved the first night! We were completely disappointed the second night when it was word for word, note-for-note, step-for-step, identical to the night before. I know that was 32 years ago but perhaps Bruce is still scripting his shows. This is not criticism, just an observation.
HOLY FUCKING SHIT WHAT IS THAT THING
I WISH THE SATANIC JEW TUBE WUD STOP PROMOTING TRANS SHIT
Which drugstore makeup for eyebrows like pencils are best (Australian brands)
I’m over it bindi
I prefer NYC. I'm not really sure why, I just had a better experience there than LA
New York for shopping
I just started watching Michael, can someone let me know who Bindi? Is? 😭😭
Those sponge applicators a brilliant for cleaning the Dyson out!

MY THEATRE LOVING HEART IS SO FULL! MY BODY IS READY! I AM BEYOND EXCITED FOR THIS BOOK!!! (Can you tell by the all caps)
This is the best idea ever! I'm so excited for this!
OMG ITS COMING OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY! Yay!
Could you do a video on your writing process? Like how you go from idea to fully formed novel. I'd be super interested to see how you do it!
I just watched your show today in wolferhampton u are amazing
This is actually the most exciting thing ever
just saw the last adams family show in wolves and I was left with goose bumps at crazier than you. what I lack in depth I make up for in shallowness.
I know how crazy busy you are at this point in your life... but I really miss Letters To Autumn! x
Never stop doing theatre ever please
Yay! Can’t wait absolutely love your books 📖 ❤️
Hopefully I'll have finished all that she can see, by then!😂😅
Its coming out on my birthday!!
Omg, for a second I thought that heading meant you were quitting youtube ^^' glad you wont ^^
Carrie - how did you begin your writing career? I haven't written a story since I was very young, but it's a desire  that has grown stronger and stronger. I don't have that much background in it and feel hopelessly in love with the idea.
Can't wait to read it!
I am super excited for your new book. We have got something in common because I love theatre and books too. I am hoping next year to do a acting course so I can do what I love and that is acting. Theatre is my life as well my parents took me and my sister to the West End when I was little and  since then I just love the theatre. xxx
Will there be a paperback version available?:)
It’s being released in the US? YES! MY BODY IS READY!
Omg this book sounds so good
I like the story line! Hoping to see it in my country Philippines next year!
Omg!!! I'm so excited it will be available internationally!! I'm from the US and I finally got On the Other Side while I was visiting England!!! I refused to leave the country without it!
OH MY GOD YES YES YES! I am an American Carrie lover/theatre nerd and this is the book I can finally get?! This is the greatest news ever my heart is overflowing.
IM SUCH A SUCKER FOR A ROMANCE GHOST STORY SET IN THE THEATER. ITS LIKE MOST OF MY MIDDLE SCHOOL SHOWS
Sounds reminiscent of phantom (but like, i haven't actually seen phantom so idk what im talking about)
I've noticed a cool pattern with your book titles: On the Other Side, All That She Can See, When the Curtain Falls --all 5 syllables. Is this intentional? If so, why?
YAY IM SO EXCITED WE U.S. RESIDENTS GET TO GET THIS BOOK!! I've wanted all of your books but this one sounds so interesting and perfect fit for me! Very excited!!
So glad that they are offering the book in America... not that the absence of this has stopped me from acquiring her books in the past. I love how Amazon provides when publishers are slacking. Congratulations on the wider distribution, Carrie!
AHHH IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS CARRIE!!!!!  I've been waiting for a book about the west end for so long now
Can I just like have it now please
Not going to lie, I paid for international shipping and got your first two books from Bloomsbury even though I live in the US! So worth it!
THE IDEA OF THE SPLIT TIMELINES REMINDS ME A LITTLE LIKE THE DROWNING OF ARTHUR BRAXTON! :O VERY EXCITED TO READ IT!!
I can't think of anything to say except... wow and soooooooooooo excited!!! Fab news Carrie x
I'm so so ready!!!
I. Am. So. READY!\n\nAnd so relieved that you're not leaving the theatre 😂
Make money on your own time ! \nhttp://5kformula.com/sq/Sippel5k/
My hear stopped because I thought you where going to stop youtube. So I'm REALLY excited for your book!
This has a sort of The Night Circus vibe about it!!!!
I am so amazed how you can have a full-time job and write a book alongside it, you must have some sort of will-power
Yay! This sounds so exciting and can’t wait to finally be able to read one of your books!
When you were reading the blurb, I got the vibe of Phantom meets Moulin Rouge. So the addition is definitely accurate! :D
It comes out on my birthday!!! And its about musical theatre which is like the best thing ever so I'm happy!
I'M SO EXCITED!!! I CAN FINALLY GET ONE OF YOUR BOOKS!!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!
How are you so cute gah I love it! Can't wait to get the book!
Yay! Congratulations, Carrie!! I’m so excited to read it!
Oh wait... does this mean a US book tour? ;)
Can we preorder in the US? I'm so excited this one's going international! Congrats, Carrie! I can't wait to read it! ☺️
YESSSS the all the times Carrie and Scott have talked about ghosts in the theater is being brought to life!!!
I'm so excited!!! This sounds like such a good book, and of course a perfect book for you to write!!!
CARRIE YOUR BOOK SOUNDS AMAZING I CAN NOT WAiT 😍😍
Can it be July right now please? 😍
So excited for you cnt wait to read it! Hope u do a signing in Leeds one day!😊❤️
how fitting would it be if this became a theatre show
Oh Carrie I swear I have never been so excited about a book. I am a theater actress too, and during all my life I think I have read just one book with this theme. And to know I will be able read your book. This is amazing!!!
Ugh I CAN'T WAIT and so glad it's being released in the US!!!!
😍😍😍😍
I AM TOO EXCITED. I NEED TO CALM. BUT I CANT. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIM CRAZIER THAN YOUUUUU
Any lesbian characters I will be able to relate to??
Was this book perhaps inspired by yours and Scott's ghost hunting adventures in an older vlog???
You honestly never stop working, this is amazing! Go girl ❤️🔥
Will there be an audible book of this as well? Cause' recently I haven't had time to sit down and read, so audible books are so much easier for me. :S
I was gonna comment that it sounds like a blend of Moulin Rouge and Phantom of the Opera and then she actually said it!
So excited to read It!! Even better as it comes out on my birthday!!!!! Eek
I love you so much! I saw you at the Manchester Central Reference Library book signing for All That She Can See 🌹 you won't remember but I told you that you inspired me to play the ukulele! That signed book is my prized possession. Thank you so much.
I can't wait. It sounds great!
This was uploaded on my birthday
I am so excited, I burped writing this! Can‘t wait!!!!
last year i was in a show that our director wrote that was called when the curtain falls !!  it was about a young brother and sister who stumbled across an abandoned theatre and characters from previous musicals came to life. it was about their journey and all the characters they met. \nthe story perfectly intertwined songs from musicals; i remember part of the story where the little girl was separated from her brother, so she sang 'On My Own' from Le Miserables, and then she met Ursula from The Little Mermaid and the witch stole her voice with the song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls', and then the girl was the puppet in the ventriloquist act from Chicago in 'They Both Reached for the Gun' because she couldn't talk, and she finally met Maria and the children from The Sound Of Music who taught her how to talk again with 'Do Re Me'. she was reunited with her brother after singing 'Home' from Beauty and the Beast. we finished the show singing 'Do You Here the People Sing' from Les Miserables because we (as the forgotten about characters) had been rediscovered and were loved once again, and we were dressed as the characters from the shows. it was such a good story line, and so great to perform because there were so many different musical numbers. \n\nmaybe this could inspire your new book carrie !! it even has the same name, after all. Congratulations !! x
The book isn't out yet but I'm ready it's musical to hit the theatres 🎭
Yay! Finally an international distribution!! Moulin rogue and The Phantom of the opera are two of my favourite musical, so I can't wait to read this book!!\nI wish you the best of luck, but I'm sure you won't need it 😉
So it's like a romantic supernatural thriller? Sounds good!
OMG it’s out two days after my 21st birthday!!! What an amazing prezzie to myself ❤️❤️❤️
New book comes out on my daughters birthday! She kinda shares your name...well, your middle name is her first name 😊
good
I cannot wait!!!
It sounds awesome 😀
Immediately ordered! Cannot wait!
YES YES YEEESSSSS!!!!!! THIS IS PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Omg I can’t wait!!
Love the mug!

I AM SOOOOOOO KEEN!
Ok this sounds, so amazing!
I'm only scared about the names you've chosen because when you and Oliver Ormson fall out, you'll always have his name in your head when you read these character names
I was actually interested until you said ghost 😒. I thought it was going to be a realistic fictitious book.
THIS IS SO EXCITING!!!!!! I can't imagine a better book to come out of your mind - it's PERFECT!!! xxxxxx
I’m so excited, and I’m also called Olive!!!
Carrie must get so annoyed at all these comments about Oliver 🙄🙄🙄
Are the characters in any way related to Oliver? 😌
Are Oscar and Olive a gay couple??? A gay couple and ghosts??? I need this book right now!
Coyote: LOOK OUT LOOK OUT LOOK OUT \nMe: GET AWAY FROM ME JUMPING SPIDER
That's my favorite spider and the most venomous
How do you handle these stuff 🕷🕷🕸🕸
I'm so afraid of spiders I can't even look at one without getting chills so this video was hard for me to watch :p
Can you search for IT next in the sewers
I been saw the snake
Coyote should look for the giant huntsman spider
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS,\n\n\n\n\nBc I waz cold I had the fan on all day
They could hide in your boots, under your sheets.\n\nNu-uh, don't do that. Got me cold at night and checking my shoes. Why would you do that?
That spider gave me the chills and got me so paranoid 😵😵😵
They are also known as Banana spiders
I want to see him catch a cobra.
You guys should go to the island of Borneo...one of the biggest island in asia..there are many rare animals there..very recommended
7:55 could totally be a meme on me day
The way Coyote handled the box STRESSED me out.
Coyote! You forgot to list the symptoms of this spider's venom despite saying how much more dangerous it is than the black widow!
Coyote I thought the wondering spider was the most deadliest
Why did he have to say in the sheets I'm not even near there and yet I have checked my bed 3 times and I still feel like things are crawling one me
Hi people scrolling through the comments
This was scarier than the movie IT
this is why I don't leave my house
I want a video of bull frogs\nPlease
This will make me have nightmares, but it is worth it.
What am I doing here? I’m scared of spiders
This video scared me so bad with these huge horrible spiders
You should try to find a Goliath bird eating spider next like if you agree
This is my favorite YouTube channel right now. Keep up the awesome work, Coyote and team!
Won’t be going to Costa Rica. Thanks, Coyote!
Yeah that right there is a Leavearight spider, Leavearight there.
Other : That is a smaller one.\nCoyote:We need a bigger one.\nMe: Why The F***!
Thx for saying that they can come in my house during the day and go in my bed sheet or my shoes
Coyote what happens if you see a wondering spider 🕷?\nlike in your boot 👢 do you kill it or die?
I actually puked watching this! I’m so terrified of spiders!
It should be noted that this is a different genus than the dangerous Brazilian wandering spider. A bite from this one is unpleasant but not likely hazardous.
In the beginning I think it was a Phoneutria nigriventer, it's common here in Brazil.
Find the Brazilian wandering spider aka most dangerous spider
Any T keepers know if that was a Theraphosinae sp. in the video?
Get bit by a spider 🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷ok from Adam.
You sunk the entire continent of South America right?
The jungle is an extremely interesting and frightening place.
That awkward moment when you check all around you because you think there's a spider near...
Did you come to my house today
Heck to the naw are they in the south
Do you think you can do a video on hour glass spiders?
I best in that into that spider was like “nope I’m out”
LAst time I checked meh boot there was a dam spider and i was like OMG 😱 then I get it out and get meh bat squash it lmao
The wandering spider is considered the most dangerous spider in the world
But the bite from this one is much, much worse!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid I hear that from a guy who got stung by a tarantula hawk?
Snakes are cute :3
Spooder
I like spiders
NO WAY
The American, muggle equivalent of Newt Scamander.
Warrior wasp?
Can you do a vedio ebout dol fense
*checks for spiders*
COME TO BRAZIL
Let it bite you.
Please be carefull,GOD bless
I have creepy crawlies on ma skin
1:12 he say pit biker?
Ah yes, indeed. The Costa Rican NOPE.
Ok... im not afraid of roaches, snakes, worms, sharks, but if u put me in a room with any type of spider i swear i'll scream my lungs out
5:05 dic* on the back of the spider
Nice Job by getting the spider
I don't like spiders very much but this is awesome!
I wants to see it kill something!!! ;-;
In the beginning the music in the background sounded like hard bass, CHEEKI BREEKI
Mark: Is this that cabin\n\n\n\n\nMe: Noooooo, it's a really big modern house.
3:21 put your finger right in front of the spiders fangs :D
Welp I'm done......
How are you not dead you have been bit lots
One time a wolf spider was in my shoe. It was not pretty. I never forgot to check my shoes again.
Roses are red\nViolets are blue\nThe moment your looking for is 6:22
You should look for a spider one of these days I don’t know the name but there’s viral videos of them in houses and there Massive like insanely lare
Hey guys think of this.\nHunting for one animal in the jungle, came across several animals different from it.\nKinda reminds you of Pokémon right?\nIdk, it does to me
Are you sure it is a Brazilian wandering spider it could be a red thigh wandering spider.
It's face you guys😠😠😠😭😨😖😵😭😱😱
Costa Rican tourist board wishing this video would disappear.. 🕷
'you guys got okay shots?' That's all j care about when there is a deadly spider near you. 😂
great video Coyote please do a ... the tide with steve
Coyote: talks about that wired posinus snake he says about another snake\nMe:I Thought u were talking about a viper!\nJk I luv it channel
*Biological land mine*\n\n\n\n\n\nYou mean if i step on it it'll explode? Or will i just squish it...
6:57  I don't got gloves so your own your own
How on earth do you have the courage to catch, much less go near, a spider like that?!
never moving to costa rica
#creepycool
Yeah I hate bugs
Hide in my sheets!?
*Quintessential*
That looks so spooky AHHHH
Nope, with a capital nope! Awesome vids tho!
Remind me to never go to central america
i have Tarantulas as pets lol, luckily mine are all quite shy
Wait how about the Brazilian  jumping spider
Isn’t this the same spider that gives you painful erections for hours.
You are crazy
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
#biggestsetofballsever
Can you caught  a stone fish
This is amazing.  Love how connected Grohl is with the fans.  Pierce kicked ass too, talk about a dream come true
I was there last night with my wife. I saw you holding the sign all night but had no idea what it said. You rocked it. Was my favorite part of the night! Congratulation!
This is so FUCKING sweet, in every possible sense of the word.
Pierce rocked it out!  What a cool moment at a very cool show!
Dream maker Dave, making dreams come true one fan at a time! He probably just changed this guy's life!
You did great man, that concert was siiiick. GO GAMECOCKS!!!
I had a sign for Pearl Jam wanting to play drums with them 19 years ago.  They were less receptive.
Oh, selfie! Hahahaha get the fuck off my stage. LOL :D
Wtg, Pierce. This world doesn't deserve Dave Grohl, but what a time to be the fuck alive
I was there last night .Pierce killed it.It was awesome
Hey there! This is Ian Cross, the Digital Content Manager at WMBF News in Myrtle Beach, SC. Do we have your permission to use this video on air and online?
Hey @wpoteet! My name is Kayla Binette & I work with WLTX, a TV station in Columbia, SC. I just interviewed Pierce Edge about his performance with the Foo Fighters. Would it be okay if I use your video? We will give you a courtesy.
Holy shit!
That guy probably went home with 3 chicks that night
real or not.. that non stop selfie is fking annoying.
And that was the day that dude drowned in pussy xD
Pierce was fucking amazing ..talk about having balls to achieve your dreams!!!
Dave Grohl is *THE PHUCKING MAN* FOR letting kid rip like that..Gift of a life time!!!! +10,000 karma points....
That was awesome!!! What kind of shirt Pierce had on??? I couldn’t tell what is was.
when a fan realizes the dream that every fan has had a day. Well done!
Pierce you fucking beast!
Someone is getting lucky tonight!
Damn son. You lucky bastard.
WOW
Way cool
What camera / lens or phone did you use to shoot the video?  (Great Quality)
SO U GET A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH FOO FIGHTERS ON A LIVE SHOW ON THE FUCKING DRUMS WITH THOSE TWO LEGENDARY DRUMMERS AND U PLAY QUEEN.
So staged, but cool.
I also knew nintendo was founded in the 19th century and made playing cards cuz it was on a snapple bottlecap
I like how she tells us how we don’t know everything about our favorite plumber, yet she called peach the “peach princess”
Saving the peach princess \nShe said that all wrong its saving princess peach
And o thought princess pech was a parody character
Is it mustache or moustache?now I'm confused
how mario got is mustache! ... he's Italian ... duh... why is this a video?
Peach princess,there are literally 2 words that have to be in order and you managed to screw it up
*P e a c h  P r i n c e s s*
I was born in 83
As somebody who grew up getting a new Mario game every Christmas, this video gave me great joy. All the memories and cold winter's spent on my consoles with endless hours of joy ;)
and saving the peach princess
Whose eyes reflection did I just saw in thE begining of this video?
He grew it wow you guys are hella dumb
Can't wait to show this to jin 😂😂
You just never know quite know what'll hold the world together at times.
What its the song
He got his mustache from puberty
They put in cartridges for super mario bros 1 2 and 3, mut the footage for all of them is just super mario bros 1. One of them has a vector filter on to smooth it out. Why?
This makes my gamer heart happy
What was 0:01 song name?
What's the music they used in the beginning
Stfu hes a dankey kang playa thats how he gor it or should i say his mother gave him dat name and he grew his own mustache
Next. Kirby the pink glutinous rice ball. The laziest character design in the world lol.
God, Mario is my childhood he was my idol, my hero, and he still is today. Thx for the memories nintendo!
Shigeru needs to learn English.\n\nNot saying he's bad
Not exactly accurate (as its ignoring mr. Game And Watch) but great vid!
What's the background song?
why tf were you using a kart in mariokart wii when bikes where the superior race in that game
How Mario got a moustache:\n\n\n\n\n\nHe grew it.
Can someone tell me the theme in the background?
Answer: he grew it
0:18 Actually I do. Trust me, I'm a pretty big Mario fan.
Shigeru Miyamoto is a living legend, with so many amazing titles like Mario and Zelda under his belt. He should be considered a national treasure man!
mario is't a plumer anymore stay up to date\nalso when you said you never knew this.i knew it all you cant read my mind sorry ;)
I learned all this stuff a year ago I even read a book on Nintendo
Nintendo was founded in 1889. Did anyone fact check this video.
My mom played Super Mario on the NES when she was little!
I guess the whole land lord thing inspired hotel mario
*PEACH PRINCESS*  And they say the fake gamer girl is a myth...
its not 1886 its 1889 do your research
Time to waste $60 next week (for good purposes)
Was I the only one who was kinda disgusted when she said peach princess?
The video is pretty fitting, considering Mario Odyssey comes out in a week. It's hype!
Fun Fact: one of Mario's original names were middle-aged guy
Peach Princess\nThis video instantly lost all credibility.
Jump man Jump man Jump man that boy up to somethin
Im pretty sure we all know he got his name from Mario Segali
The first thing you don't know: Princess peach is the peach princess.
That's not mario, thats FLINSTONES.
0:11 YOU HAD ONE JOB!
uh you werent exact it was 1889 not 1886
I thought he got the name and mustache because *_He’s a god damn italian_*
Why didn't you show Mario 2 or 3 when you put the cartridge in? The best ones!
1889 actually, get your History right, great big story
Remember when Mario was Still  Plumber. Good Times.
THE LEGEND HAS SPOKEN!!
When mario breaks up with peach\nMario:were breaking up\nPeach: way?!\nMario:its not you it's a me mario
it is not a mustache it's a dirty sanchez
bro I been knew all this shit
so the lack of art skill to draw hair is what cause mario to wear a hat lol
5:53 IS THAT GENIUS ADVERTISING OR IS IT A RANDOM NAME?
I actually played sonic the hedgehog as a child
Luigi god his name from GASP LEO LAIGI LUIGI
Lueeeeegeeeee, you gotta go save the *Peach Princess*
Oh, I know mario cuz matpat told me so if you wanna know who mario really is, go watch his videos at his channel game theorist
One of the first
IT'S A ME- A-MARIO
What's the intro song? That's fire
I've played Mario karts However as an Italian I've always found it very disturbing
Don't like my comment
I love how Miyamoto pronounces Luigi as WEEGEE <3 YES! The meme lives!
why do you have to get sponsored by cnn
Trending omg I’m so proud of this channel \nLike if u agree
*oh boy this make me so happy*
Super nintendo dirty as hell
Name of song?
Yawnssss... Old news.
*sAvInG ThE pEaCh PrInCesS*
Long Live Mario!👏👏👏
The Peach Princess.
Mario san savingu pirincess peachu......ohhhhho
Saving the peach princess!\n\n\n\n\nYup thats it!
Good hype for oddysey
begining song plz
CNN 10
Nice #44OnTrendinh
Lets'a go
Peach Princess?
I already knew
He grew it
Music used?
Do a movie
Mario fans come right away...that’s meeeee
NOT first!
0:20 *your favorite not-so-plumber anymore italian.
Yea I already know this....
Whoa...

Hahahaha I love Clara too much I'm already familiar with all the clips... WE NEED MORE OF CLARA
This kid is too cute.
she really goes along with trying pretty diverse food even made up her own grading scale. she's just perfect for this. Love Clara!
Clara makes sure she tastes everything first before judging it aww So adorable and precious!!!
I never see my name anywhere, and seeing this adorable little girl makes me so happy omg
She's the best 😊
If you disliked this video  *F I G H T   ME*
Clara gives me life! She is the most adorable little sweetheart! Her parents should be so proud!
If Clara doesn't like it no one is gonna like it
She's an extremely cute kid ever! Grading system lol
my favorite kid in Hiho i love u Clara
Is she a British or something.\n? Her accent is so cool. I love her! 😘😘
do your parents feed you lol
I love how she’s not a picky eater. She’s honestly past good.
I probably would have been like her when I was her age
I dont care its stuff ive seen 100x she is so precious and cute!!\nKid goals
Clara is my favorite :D <3 She is life.
The flying lettuce definitely takes the cake for me
That montage at the end though
What a smart little girl. Adorable
When she was eating lettuce I was like that's me 😂
Her facial expression give me life
It’s free now
omg i love her she’s my favorite, she’s so funny 😂
Sweetest little thing in the world. Claras videos are past good!
This almost makes me cry
Her face when something tastes good kills me everytime she just seems so happy 😂😂😍
She's adorable! I also wonder if her parents feed her though 😂
Clara is my favorite kid to watch on here! I don't understand how Drippy Chocolate is #5... It's higher up for me! She's so much fun and very goofy... definitely joy. :)
I swear she takes a blunt before these videos 😂
Clara is my fave🍄

What is there to dislike about these vedio.\nHeartless people.
Where's the moment that she says I like the spoon , though
I’m obsessed with the flying lettuce part, I can’t.
50,000 views and trending gets a big thumbs down.
aaaah drippy chocolate... oooooom ahahah so damn adorable =D this is what I needed, she put a huge smile on my face. i can sleep in peace now ahaha
Watching children eat food on YouTube in 2017 guys. What a thrill.
She reminds me of the little cute girl in despicable me
So great videos published on my birthday!!😆😆yayyy
By farrrrrrr my favourite kid on the channel. Love her!! So sweet and sincere
I'm stealing her food grading system.
I love her facial expressions! If im gonna do animation in the future i will definitely study her for references hahaha!
She’s my favorite kid!

KIDS TRY VENEZUELAN FOOD!!!! Pleaasee!! Venezuela is in a tough place and it would be nice to show how beautiful Venezuelan culture is, buzzfeed PEROLIKE shined some light into the situation in Venezuela. Please make the kids try traditional Venezuelan food!! Chicha, arepas, tequeños, empanadas, pastelitos, cafe con leche y pan dulce, mandocas, torta de tres leches and more!! I am Venezuelan myself and really like watching this kids learn about other countries through their culinary perspect.

Gotta have the seritcha
placenta, RIGHT?!
louise is going to be literally the best mom ever
I love this they are so cute and comfortable with each other and it makes me so happy
Being a twin I can confirm that, we don't come out at the same time...I think we'd be a bit broken if we tried coming out of such a small space at the time? Being a twin is difficult guys don't do it!
“You’d be great dads” awww together
bless you for making this happen
one time in 10th grade, someone asked don't some mom's eat the pancreas of their baby after its born? and we all looked at him in horror bc he forgot the correct word was actually placenta and not pancreas.
Dan and Phil legit look scared and are probably scarred for life
You guys would make great dads. LIKE, TOGETHER??? :D
i really wanna know where dan got his shirt from
I'm totally still in love with Dan :) -his wavy hair is a plus-\nand the video was super fun! I think Phil and Louise are super fun too! They'd make great friends :D
2 men and a baby... IM
i actually thought a Doula was a person that helps with the birth. It sounds like it came from old timey births
“You two would make really good dads” \n\nMe: *falls off chair*
I just learned of new terms I've never heard of before and I have a lot of new Mom friends. Also, a Doula in England is a Midwife in America. Weird translation but it means the same thing.
_the blue lava lamp in the background.._\n\n\n\n\n*_if you've been in the phandom for awhile, you'll understand_*
Its past midnight, i was watching doll repaints, how did i get here?
the information and description of childbirth didn't bother me, the thought of the pain did.
WHEN PHIL SAID HE’D PUT A TOWELL DOWN I LITERALLY FELL DOWN ON THE FLOOR IN LAUGHTER OML
There’s a picture of my mom being pregnant that weirds me out and the fact that you might tear and you have this weird ticking warm time bomb attached to you that you cannot remove and you’ll probably smell weird and it’ll be scary
I love how most people here are like.. I'm gonna adopt.\n\nI've known all these since I was 12 and I still want a child 😂
My sister is pregnant and when she first found out, she said Oh, Hannah, you can help me eat me placenta!
i learned a lot more about pregnancy than i did in health class
This was really awkward but also really hilarious to watch
proof abortion is wrong, babies are alive, she said herself the baby could hear in the room
I'M VOMITING. Never having kids. NO THANKS
Dan and Phil are overwhelming Louise with all the questions during water birth
I had a water birth at home
When Louise said doula who thought of Gilmore girls
hearing dan say alright babe followed by a snort and an adorable laugh is all i could ask for and more
i only knew two of these and my mom is eight months pregnant
Dan: Right babe?\nPhil: *looks over and then quickly looks away*
The fact that she would've named her baby Daniel is so heartwarming I love them
I have a really sore throat- potentially tonsillitis- and this video made me laugh so much I'm in SO MUCH PAIN 😂😣
I feel like I should know more of these things since I'm a woman
You'd be like great dads
Why was this so funny 😂
‘Not many people have alien babies’ \n\n\nDil
Dan looks so soft in this video I love it
imma laugh when its a boy and we already know the name
I’m scared of giving birth now
Next video with louise is them holding the baby??? Please???
You have my dream hair!!!
they genuinely enjoy each other so much this is forever my favorite friendship
Alright, that's over. Make an omlete.\nDAN LMAO, THAT'S NOT HOW PLACENTA WORKS.
dan saying babe is my new kink
Dan saying babe is now one of my new favorite things
We just started our pregnancy unit in my school health class and honestly that coupled with this video have thoroughly convinced me to not have kids 😂
I love how willing they actually are to learn about it all
omg i was excited that I knew what a doula was bc of brooklyn 99
she looks so similar to my mom
You have officially put me off having babies Lou. Lol
CAN SOMEBODY GIVE ME THE TIME STAMP FOR  DAN SAYING BABE.\nalso this was amazing???
Doula isn't that a pop star? Oh no that's Dua Lipa OMG DANIEL
love Loise, love her hair, love Dan, Love them being in a vid
SHE WOULD’VE NAMED HIM DANIEL I’M NOT CRYING
This is everything I have ever desired and more
Hi I'm never having a child
CONGRATS LOUISE!!!!!!!!!!!! THE BABY WILL HAVE AN AMAZING MOTHER
I’ve had a baby and I’m on my second and I still didn’t know some of these. Lol
i love how the boys are totally fine with this
Btw when you first give birth you should kiss the baby as much as you can because it will make it healthier I forget why but I saw it in my health text book.
doula sounds like a nickname for that devil wears prada ceo like it sounds like a devilish bitchass knowitall diva
Phil: so that's technically a really long nose\nLouise: yyyyyyyyeahhhhhhh (why have I done this to myself)
I actually have a biology exam next week and pregnancy is one of the top is tHANK YOUU
I'm not having a baby, ever, nope nope nope
I love Louise dan and Phil omg
Is that dan or a tomato?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists can’t tell. 😂
Dan what's with the babe
Louise : neonate (idk how to spell it)\nMe : neon baby?
never heard of any of these when I was pregnant. wahh Dan and Phil 😂😂😂
I freaked out a bit when she said Hey Liam.
Hahahahahah i freaking love this video. It is both educational AND hilarious. Plus, all amazing peeps are together in one video!
I love that Phil is so offended that Doula wasn’t easy
I answered almost all of the questions right. My mums a labor and delivery nurse, iv has a scaring life.
Is no-one going to acknowledge:Dan's extensive vocabulary Dan's reference to his depressionLouise's boy name choice being DanielDan and Phil knowing more about it than many femalesThat dan would be a great doula\nPhil looking at dan when he said babe\nI mean seriously!
The baby craves that mineral 😂 i love that meme
How big are the gouches Dan has seen!?
“Its a pop star” \n“Oh no that’s Dua Lipa” 😂😂
I’m 14 and am choosing not to have kids when I’m older but this video was still very informative lol Love you all 💕
This is why I am never having children
DANIEL
Louise: Doula\nDan: Thats a popstar isn't it\nDan: ohthatsDuaLipa
alSO BOOB NECTAR
My mum is a Doula
Dan:alright babe\nMe: *iCHohEReNt ScrEAmiNg*
THE PLACENTA FIC😭
Llllllowah
Aw 😄
i literally only knew placenta lmfao xD
how did I pass health wtf
Daniela?
I love this👶🏼
Placenta. *flashback to dani snot on fire* 😂❤️
Pink hair 💖💖💖
GREAT DADS
Dan knows all about placenta...
PLACENTA
Phil looks so good!
MY NAME IS PHILIPPA

Love love love love this song!!!
Love it! I still remember when I used to listen to Breakaway back in 4th grade. Kelly's music was one of the main reasons why I developed a passion for music. There was something about her style that just drew me in and inspired me use music a way to express myself. Now I'm working with my best friend as a music duo to create authentic music that really describes who we are. We are doing a live album project right now where we are releasing a song once a month. If you have a moment to check out our channel, we would really appreciate it! It's really insane how music can affect someone's life and I want to create music that has the same impact that Kelly had one me. Peace!
You're right. This song IS the meaning of life
She is absolutely killing it with these new songs. The vocals are just untouchable. Jesus. I can’t wait for the album.
Omg love this song her vocal are so strong I think this will be her best to date
My new favorite song. Can’t wait for release 😄
why some people hate her???? bcuz of her weight FUCK u people.. shes awesome cant wait for the album
That G5 is all I ever need. Damnnn...
Stunning... and the live version is even better... she is truly amazing!
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN!😍😍😍😍
VOCALS.
Love it
I missed this kind of song the lyrics are so meaningful
Completely shooketh to the core. 😭
What the fucks wrong with the views? is youtube trippin'? she definitely deserves more than 30,000 views!
I got goosebumps everytime i play this song...the best ever... I just cant wait for new album
I can't wait till next week for your new album dropp !!!! 💥💥💥💥💥
ok this is the best song so far from your new album!
Love this! Real talent. Real voice. Just pure talent and soul! Love you Kelly😘
Girl Power\nQueens  voices Aguilera ,Kelly,Demi,Adele.
https://youtu.be/InfbZaf7dTg
Ooooo Kelly girl. You make me wanna write. #Soul #YasQueen
First Kelly Clarkson and then Avril Lavigne... 2018 will be awesome !
Oh I thought this was an old song
search the title of this song on Google
This is like the 100th time listening to this song. IT'S SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!
Kelly is churning out the soul. This is magnificent. Blow up big girl.
I'm living for Kelly's new music. ❤
Oh yeah! The beats and the lyrics are just 😍👏
Life is like a pigeon, crapping on your heart.
what the f, why isnt this song on the radio?????? I like this song better than the other one on the radio.  No offense but i just dont like that one segment where you sing monotone
We already know whos gonna get all the Grammys at home.
show to the newbies the new crappy singers of today what is real singing
This is a GREAT song, very haunting and unforgettable.
I'm in tears of happiness. Kelly, if I had to chose a song to describe my relationship with my boyfriend, THIS IS IT! I've struggled with severe social anxiety, since I was a kid. I'm 21 now. When my boyfriend came around, I pushed him away, since I wasn't used to receiving kindness. He was always patient, and kind, he showed me unconditional love since day 1. He always shows me love, and lifts me up when I start to have anxiety or self doubt.
You don't have a soul if you don't like this song... I mean come on! THIS IS LEGIT!!! Kelly my girl... whatever does people says... YOU'RE THE BEST!!!
Please take a moment to pay tribute to those who suffered so much on Oct 1st in Las Vegas.  This video will tug at your heart and bring a tear of happiness to your life.  youtube.com/watch?v=dlQTUVlXFLY
Can we give her a GRAMMY already?
Hey guys I'm trying to be the next Kelly Clarkson (in her honor) and if I could get a quick like, comment, subscribe, favorite, follow, retweet, revine, facetime, and kickstarter donation from each of you that would be dank FAM. \n\nSeriously, I've been trying for years my dudes. In fact, I remember when I was 7 years old, my daddy told me go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely\n\nIt was a great big world but we thought we were bigger, pushing each other to the limits we were learning quicker. By 11 drinking herb and smoking burning liquor. But seriously guys I'm on Spotify if you could give me a follow I'll love you have a great day <3
Great performance...Kind of reminds me of Josh Stone  : )
This song slayyyyyy big time... This need more views ^_^
Yet another piece of pure art.  Love this talented gem!
wow Hitler was right about the jews
Another amazing song from my favourite singer! <3
Ive never heard a more powerful song. This song brought me to tears in the middle of my shift hearing it the first time... Its like she got inside my head and wrote a song about how i feel about my life/wife! Thank you so so much kelly! You are amazing girl!!!!
now THIS is kelly. <3
Surely this a grammy award song x
Give me goose bumps all the time!! AMAZING😍😍😍
*now this is real talent.*
Many old artist are coming back because they realize there is too much crap being called music and lyrics. Many more should come back! This song is beautiful!
Another awesome song off an album not yet out.  Killer.
I know this is over dramatic but OMG I'm crying right now! This is the type of music my soul craves for! I'm so beyond musically fulfilled right now!
Thank you God, we were all in need of a good album in the midst of so many crap.
big love for you kelly
Epicgasmically amazing! I can't wait to hear the rest of the songs!
I love this so much❤️❤️
Thumbs up, sounds old school. Guess that is why I like it.
The beat kind of threw me off at first but wow *applause*
Kelly i would have kild myself without you

Bit like a nonce
Now this is REAL music. Disappointing when Taylor's new song has more views and is number 1 on iTunes when this is 1000x better.
Yaaassss!
Socorro ! ♥

Aca... Kelly Clarkson siendo MARAVILLOSA que pedazo de voz la puta madre!
♫❤♫ LE CANZONI PIU’ BELLE DEL MOMENTO AGGIORNAMENTO CONTINUO \nNELLE MIE PLAYLIST ►http://bit.ly/2jBttS1\n►http://bit.ly/2jxK2OI (Classifiche Mtv & le più suonate in radio-2017)
You are the best singer!!!
Unfortunately, I'm not a fan. The vocal production here is weird and the way she talked up the album, I thought it would be something more than Adele B-sides and Motown karaoke. Everything she's released so far is just so bland, which is disappointing since I've been a fan since day one and think she has an unbelievably good voice that's only sometimes been showcased the way it should be.
living like a flopping washed up fatty can be so tough
The album is falling short. I still think Breakaway was her best album. My favorite song was Behind These Hazel Eyes.
YouTube will throw anything on trending these days...
Everything about this song screams Kelly Clarkson.  Her life and loves and this song are mirror metaphors for one another.  The song is Kellys love and happiness radiating thru her art.  It's raw and real and what we all want.
Kelly's meaning of life is shoving food down her gullet
Why is she not using her vevo account anymore? haha just wondering
Lol she is still fat.
omg kelly clarkson has like no talent , taylor swift would  make a way better album, haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate and kelly cant lose weight weight weight weight wight , work it off work it off! lmao  taylor is the queen of music, nice try to stay relevant kelly clarkson lmao
Lose some weight before creating a album
You kidding me?...Islam isn't a race...why did she need facial alterations?...honestly, this is embarrassing
Keep stirring the pot Channel 4 👍
Channel 4 can fuck off with this Political correctness, liberal lefty bullshit..
FUCK OFF WITH YOUR ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PIECE BULLSHIT.
Why I don't hate Muslims themselves, Islam as a religion is disgusting. It is a horrific, barbaric religion of a bygone age that would belong more in the 11th century than the 21st century. If Muslims had minds of their own they would realise that they are involved in an oppressive, pointless regime.
What about the thousands upon thousands of young girls raped and groomed for being non muslims and white all across the country each year? What about the hundreds of acid attacks? The thousands of Female genital Mutilation or the honor killings? The extremism and terrorism? What about the over 100,000 estimated islamofascists in this country and the over 52,000 jihadists potential terrorists? Not to mention the majority of british muslims when polled think homosexuality should be a criminal offence and support sharia law which is theocratic fascism. It's so disgusting we are normalising theocratic fascism and the subjugation and oppression of women under Islam
This is in very poor taste and has an obvious agenda. Come on channel four, you’re meant to be one of the good guys.
they darkened her skin and gave her a bigger nose so she could look more muslim am i the only one disgusted by this rn??? there are so many white muslims this is literally so fucking unnecessary fuck you @ channel 4
Hahahahaha just no.
My life as a Christian in Syria there you go
Fuck channel 4
Tries to make a show about tolerance.\nUses brown face and forgets white Muslims exist.\n*Curb Your Enthusiasm Theme plays*
I am not suprised in the slightest. Heck why would an English tv channel/media journalist paid for by the citizens of this country actually do anything to show the Muslim religion for what it's really like. That would be being honest which the media are about as much as cancer. My opinion the media worldwide all politicians in this country & Europe are as much the enemy within as much as the majority of Muslims. A prime example of the enemy's within is how many of them were allowed to return back after going abroad to fight for terrorists thousands. America wouldn't allow that Donald Trump is far from perfect however his orders on immigration especially Muslim country's is outstanding again the media hate him for it but they do love to hate honesty especially if it conflicts with their weak ass views that Muslims are peaceful & want the same as any other religion. Any Muslim who hates this county is about as welcome as cancer & should be deported along with every illegal immigrant. Who ever this bitch is she's a disgrace to her race & embarrass me. Anyone who's ok with all Muslims being allowed to do & say whatever they want while every Caucasian Catholic or Christian is shouted down as racist the second we open our mouths to stick up for our beliefs fuck you !. People like you wouldn't be allowed in America a proud nation who fly their flag you shouldn't be allowed in England you people embaris me. Fuck all media politicians & Muslims your all the true enemy within
The the 90% of people saying wtf why did she have to black up and dress up. Yes its ignorant to think that all muslims look like that. But you have to understand that the other half the world lives in ignorance. The first thing that comes to most peoples minds when they think of muslims are the dress and race, regardless of your knowledge.\n\nAll people and religions one way or another, whether they like it or not, have painted themselves a picture to be recognised by.
they gave her a big nose smh
She doesn't even look like a paki.
Hey let's all masturbate a pig over a Koran to celebrate being a Muslim, it's a lies in the Koran any way, Mohammed was  schizophrenic , and a slave trading pedophile, and a war monger too
Might as well wave the White flag and surrender to Islam, as it seems the West has given up as what a shame. Truly disturbing as to where we are heading as a Western society, it's enough to make you sick as the way things are going.
How the fuck is this trending at 49 with only 495 views youtube I doing dodgy stuff definitely
Channel 4 and specifically channel 4 news has lost a serious amount of credibility in the past few years, the coverage of Trump and constant race baiting will be the death of them
My week as a terr....muslim
You missed the part where she was executed for apostasy at the end.
look at this : \nSheeva V\n3 days ago\nWhy not do a programme called my week as a Brit living as a minority in my own country and see the shit they have to put up with hmmm? the west needs to know how to be a person like everyone in this world.
Sadly people have been greatly mislead about Islam. I hope people do not judge others by their prejudice. For the sake of humanity I ask all people to have patience & research the facts; we expect this for ourselves in our own courts of law.
A fake  prosthetic nose and tan to  look muslim. WTF
Ban all Muslims entering the UK.
My week as a Muslim, then a terrorist attack happens... Coincidence I think not, great planning channel 4 👻
Fuck all Muslims, and fuck the media for always trying to portray them as the victims.
England is a Christian country, fuck off with this PC bullshit
Pro muslim propaganda feck off channel 4
Did she have her clit removed as well?  I hear that's a thing for some of them. 0_o
Vermin scum taking over. invading and breeding on our country. Fuck right off! Paedophile worshipping terrorists
Why doesn’t she walk in their shoes in the Middle East? Or does she not want to be subjected to being treated worse than a camel? Typical channel 4 pro-Islamic propaganda defining British white’s as racists or xenophobic or Islamophobic as per usual. \nIf you want to be part of a religion which thinks that women are inferior, dogs and pigs are dirty animals, Jews and Christians must pay extra taxes in an Islamic caliphate because of their religion and brutally slaughtered (which is sectarianism at its finest) gays and people who have sex out of marriage are thrown off rooftops and children and women can be temporarily married to a Muslim man for him to fuck then you are not a human being. You belong in the dark ages. Islam is cancer.
Honestly I think this will be more educational for SOME people than actual Muslims just talking about their experiences. For some reason that shouldn't be there i feel that this strategy may manage to stir more feelings to the surface
I thought Muslims can be white, so why did they paint her face brown?  Channel 4 own goal?
Tell ya what. Do a documentary on a 20 year old Woman disguised as a 17 year old Woman walking through Bradford.  You will get the same outcome and were in our country ffs.
You could just visit muslims and talk to them about their experiences and opinions, we don't need this extra bullshit.
the comments under here are vile.
Ugghh this show is so stupid
Channel 4 leftist bullshite false news. Bet there's nothing about tax avoiding, child grooming, or planning mass murder
I’m starting to believe we fought the wrong side in WW2.
She looks like a witch
All over you tube are videos of Muslims   abusing people  in  what they view as their areas. These people  getting abuse and threats could be: Polish , British, ,or anyone  being  seen drinking,  seen as gay,  or provocatively dressed (usually women). Or maybe just a few young kids out to enjoy the evening   Comparatively Muslims  get away with far more  abuse and  actual racial attacks than any other bigot  you could think of. But these facts of course will never be seen as  the makings of  TV programme  because it would offset  the narrative that likes  to portray  Muslims as  a religion of peace. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/_SK7To4gSr0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ra45nX9JmW4\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SukEnAQ_ebE\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lkCTGiyrD0k
What does the guy shout at 0:33 ?
Why did they brown face her????
What a load of bullshit why does she have to be wear the bin bag to be Muslim. It’s choice to wear it. Plus most Muslims just wear it to be different or to stand out from white people. Silly cunts
Why don't they just get actual Muslims...? Fuckin hell- always have to get a white person to be the victim, in this case dressing them up with brownface! Stupid.
kate your sick. this actually brought tears to my eyes. why can’t people just accept the fact that not everyone is white or christian. not everyone in england is english?
Could anyone tell me what the name of the song is at 0:15? I've been trying to find that song for weeks. Thanks.
Maybe we should start enforcing our own laws, the government is taking the absolute piss put of us.
Well done Channel 4, yet another documentary to try and make us feel sorry for Muslims, and make us believe we're the problem for all of the problems. Such a tolerant religion, with the children getting taught to stay away from us because we aren't Muslims, and they're a disgrace if they don't have a fistful of beard. And don't get me started on wife beating, and child abuse. \nIf they want to live somewhere that's tolerant towards them, they can go back to a islamic country! \nWe wouldn't have any terror attacks then, although I suppose they're all part and parcel of living in a big city even though the Finsbury mosque attack was unacceptable. GET THEM OUT!!
Next time can you go to the middle east so you can have a real feeling of it.
in 2017 how many muslims believe muhammed flew on a donkey and he split the moon into quarters? Those that answer yes need urgent mental health check ups.
I'll still proud stand as islamophobic! and I was born in Indonesia.
trying to portray muslims as the victim then a terrorist attack happens during filming.\ngo walk around pakistan as a christian.. you wont be ashamed to live here
Try walking around as a white Christian or as a white anything for that matter in Pakistan.....See how long you last!
Make Britain Great Again. Britain was a great and hardworking country back in the day. Now, the media sympathises with the most useless group of minorities who live in Britain as if it was Pakistan.
Ahh yeah never mind the deaths of innocent people in Manchester, due to Islamic terrorism, immigrant muslims are the victims here... what a fucking joke.
Next, My Week as an underage white girl who got raped by Muslim rape gang and the police never did anything about it and allowed them to continue doing it....No? Oh yeah I forgot Channel 4 are a bunch of leftist Muslim apologist fags
I love how they make her a pakistan muslim not just a white muslim.
please make my week as a child who got their legs blown off in birmingham
Why does everyone think Muslim=Pakistani. We are not pakis for fuck sakes. A Muslim can be black, white, Chinese etc
Channel 4 ... yeah, I'm gonna stay away from that obvious trap.
Islam has got nothing to do with Islam.
Did they put a big nose prosthetic on her to make her look more Pakistani? 😂
AND at 10 hate white people its not racist its away of life 2017
WERE NOT TERRRORISTS FGS
Remove Kebab
Divide your country....import muslims...🐷
Wow, sorry I scrolled down. jeez.
I would love to know why they thought they needed to brown her up and give her a comedy nose. I'm white, English, atheist (from a christian family)  and get these comments every day of my life. In the the last 5 years i have had these knuckle dragging benefit scroungers tell me to fuck off home you paki bastard about 50 times, i've been called a terrorist on the train, a dirty immigrant in the bank, a muslim pedo, had the boooom bombing noise shouted at me, had retards going to the gym say i've got a bomb in my rucksack, you name it i've heard it or been called it. In pubs i've had people say i didn't think paki's drink, in the street i've had people say it's like pakistan round here, a few months ago i passed a group of young (no doubt burger-flipping until they're 70) sluts going whoring on Ecclesall Road, Sheffield and one said to her friend he might throw rocks at me. Not quite sure what part of my white face, rock band hoodie, jeans and converse made me look muslim, but the english are that uneducated these days you get used to it. They probably think Bin Laden played bass guitar for Metallica on his days off from musliming. A lot of these incidents happen in the evening, clearly the vast majority of this country's wonderfully educated citizens can't quite grasp the concept that things (including people!) look darker....when it's dark! Durrrrrr! \n\nThe english are obsessed, they think everybody is an immigrant and a muslim. Most English people these days would think Ozzy Osbourne is a muslim. My great grandfather died in WW2 fighting the Nazi's and to be honest if i could go back in time, i'd say don't bother let Hitler flatten the shithole. I call England a 5th world country and it's entirely because of the natives, otherwise known as brain-dead benefit-scrounging neanderthals. I would love to fuck off back home, but unfortunately i was born in this cesspit and until i semi-retire (hopefully in about 5 years, thanks to my degree in engineering), i'm stuck with all you cavemen and cavewomen. I can't wait to take my money elsewhere and not have to pay for all the working (that's a laugh!) class whores to push out babies to score a council house.
Good
Fuck off
This is disgusting
Fuck. right. Off.
Oh fuck off channel 4
The fuck...
Bruh
Damn.. those white guys are fucking racist
Fucking idiots
People are so ignorant
Islam is manufactured bullshit
You should do a show called  My week as a gay person in a Muslim country However it will probably end in death.
All these people forgetting about the KKK after saying *all Muslims are terrorists.*
Scum bags. Get the Muslims and Islam out out if England.
Wait hang on? They made her face brown? Why?
Fucking white scumbags always gotta mock other races first it was black face now it's brown face. Stupid cunts.. Muslims are victims of terrorism in the Middle East and with the U.S fucking white cunts sending fucking drones and killing innocent people. Lmao non Muslims think their the most victims fuck outta here stupid fucking pagan dickheads.. Non Muslims commit the most terror in the Middle East and in Africa!
LOL , I love the hateful comments here. It's interesting to see how low class people meant not to ever learn to write or read. Get them back in the farms. :)
These people are fucking racist as fuck. Especially the woman doing it.\n'You expect them to blow something up'\n''Doesn't even look like England'\nFuckin sweaty ball bag
This is propaganda at its finest. White ppl can be muslim too. This world is disgusting, they want to promote hatred between ppl and make ppl appear different from each other. Last time i checked we were all human. Don't buy into it guys cause the minute you do that's when it will be easy for them to impose their evil laws on you and wars will happen even more. This program is utter trash cause the real victims are all of us. Those who cause attacks to create fear in us so that we will accept their war on terror facade are the real enemies. Never forget this guys.
Channel 4, on behalf of the United Kingdom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland:\n\nKindly piss off.
Channel 4 going full cuck mode again. Eat shit along with the bbc 🖕🏻
FUCK ALL OF U HATING ON MUSLIMS FOR NO REASON \nPISS OFF UR GONNA GET NOWHERE \nA WHITE PERSON KILLS- HAS AN ILLNESS \nBROWN PERSON KILLS-AUTOMATICALLY MUSLIM AND A TERRORIST \nU RACISTS NEED TO GET AN ACTUAL GRIP OF URSELVES
I dont get the comments, Why would Channel 4 address social issues in Arab countries, its not an Arab channel. Its the responsibility of the Arab media to address social issues in the Arab world.
Probably all the people that voted leave are the ones being racist silly fucking northen twats
As a Muslim, I find this appalling. Channel 4 are trying to tell people that all Muslims are, are people who look Middle Eastern or Pakistani; Muslim women are just people who wear a hijab. Disgusting.
Throw bacon at them
Don't look . These Comments are full of racist cancerous bigots. I warned you.
Islam is the future of Globe \nTakbeer Allah Hu Akbar

I get so many goosebumps when i fight with my husband this video pops into my head and i just end up hugging him so tightly idk what i would do without him i love this video and this song 💕💔😩
Honestly I thought she was doing all that because they broke up but its just grief.
Well done Gabbie!\nThis is an amazing song and it gave me the chills when I listen to it😘😘😘😘
i relate to this
this is so sad, now I see how my mom felt 10 years ago or maybe even now..
Just listened to this for the 1st time, I LOVE IT! I expected the funeral becuase some of the lyrics I heard.
When did she change her name
I love this I can't stop listening to it
Don't know why but somehow this reminded me of the novel 'Ps. I love you'😅 \nWhich is also a movie.\nBtw i love this song very much💖💖💖💖its on repeat💝💝
Please youtube...add a reply button so I can have this on a loop while i'm playing video games or do other things.

Oh my gosh!!! Gabby, this is SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!!
Omg. I didn't know that the boyfriend died! I saw Gabbie with a flower and in a black dress and I was like,  oh she maybe going to a funeral for her gma and her boyfriend will comfort her.  BUT NO! DRAMA!!!
Gabbie everytime i watch this video i wanna cry iys awesome i love it.  U dine so much u are like a role model to me.  I remember watching ur snaps talking about how ur anxiety and everything but u are doing amazing and look incredible keep it up boo 😉😘😊

she change her name it was:gabbie show, know its :gabbie hanna
THIS is so sad I'm crying 😭
I wanna do a cover of this so bad
Well I know what I'm going to listening to for the next three months

Freaking addicted to this song!!!! Damn girl!
This better not have been real because its too sad
THAT WAS SO SAD AND HEART WARMING AAAahhhhhhh
This is so good that I'm actually shaking.
Funny enough me and Gabby have the same kind of singing voice , our natural talking voice is peppy . But when me start to talk/sing its quite deep ( beginning of video ) then when we do song its pretty surprisingly loud and cool . I personally cant sing high but , yeah , just wanted to point this random fact out ! Cheers !
this song is amazing and i so thought it was a breakup song but the plot twist!! you're so inspirational and your voice is amazing. ilysm <3
I thought he left gabbie but the guy died
I'm sorry The Gabbie Show can't come to the phone right now Why? Oh, cause she's dead
Love everything you've been up to lately! I'd love to share some lyrics with you and see what you think so if you're interested let me know! I'm just looking for feedback and I'd love to hear your opinion! 💖

Gabbie you really have a beautiful voice I love this song I have it in my playlist the song made me tear up you’ve done fantastic job I am so proud of you & your such a beautiful girl God Bless You
I love how she can sing so low; a lot of female singers struggle with the lower octaves, but she gets them so effortlessly, and without straining. It really is a gift.
Ok so I guess he died sad

i started crying Gabbie. I can't!
Thank you for sharing your story Demi! You are such a pretty, talented and fun person .... all that raw emotion you felt going through what you did came out in your music and reached us x So glad life is on track for you now!
I love you! 😍 You're such a beautiful wonderful soul!
This documentary made me love Demi even more... I didn't think that was possible ❤️
This is honestly amazing I love it I love how real she is she's awesome the fact that she opened up herself airing out everything good and bad I honestly appreciate artists who does things like this to show that there not perfect and it's ok to have flaws and no matter what never give up on you're self and be who you want to be. It's ok to have flaws and no one is perfect No One
Yeaaaaaa not a good person.
living your best life!
everything about this was just so inspiring
Anyone here for a cheeky tug?
This has made me love Demi a lot more than I used to! She's a beautiful person in and out and I'm so proud of her for overcoming all that she did and be the strong beautiful woman she now is ❤️❤️❤️
Sorry but the very first thing you learn in rehab is once an addict always an addict. I love her to death and I'm so glad she's doing much better! But she's definitely still an addict though and always will be because this is something she's gonna struggle with the rest of her life.
im so drunk rn and i thought she sung complicated (by avril lavigne ) and i thought 'thats cute'
Wow. This is such a powerful message. So proud of you Demi! 💖💖💖😘😘😘😍😍😍
absolutely beautiful and completely inspiring... thank you Demi ❤
I was inspired by Demi being open about all her disorders from the very beginning instead of giving us an image of perfect celebrities living perfect lives; that and the way she see her disorders as milestones to staying strong are one of the reasons why i consider her a role model. I feel like she is being thoroughly honest through this documentary and was shocked to listen to her talk about all these signs she experienced that i actually relate to, and it made me realize that i can't conquer all my demons alone like i thought i should, and that i should seek help. Thank you Demi, you are a role model by just being you; there's no pressure for you to mold yourself into anything, just being you is enough. Thank you.
why didn't they talk about self harm??
I really enjoyed this
Idk why but I've always looked up to you as a person and I haven't know you that's well but the fact that I found it more about you made me love you more than I already do. You are the most gorgeous bravest and strongest person I know you inspire me sooo much to be stronger and believe that I can accomplish something
my goodness. i can’t even begin to describe how much you inspire me demi. i’ve watched you since barney and friends, and you have been a major part of my life. everything you’ve done to improve and get better reminds that my story is never over no matter what i go through. i love you so much. ❤️
Omg demi!! You have an extraordinary voice, and you're so beautiful!! This documentary gave me so much goosebumps!! Love you!!
This gives me so much hope.. I have bulimia and bipolar and Demi's someone i've always connected to on such a deep level. Very proud of her.
Demi and her sister sound the exactly same!!! Omg!!
This was honestly such a great story, and so inspiring ! It takes a lot to open up and share stories and I know this has and will impact a lot of people. I love you Demi, your a great role model
You are a beautiful person,  inside and out ♥
She is the most honest and humbled celebrity I've ever seen. Everyone else wouldn't talk about issues as deep and dark as hers because they don't have the balls. She is truly amazing in every single thing she does these days. We are so proud of her ❤. She is an inspiration in this fucked up world today. Keep shining gorgeous 🌟you have all of us to keep you grounded if anything did go wrong again ❤❤ lots of love
You're a truly fighter... my respect.
oh my God I'm crying Demo you're a great woman, person and artist. I love you so much you're the best in the world I do not have words to express what I feel I love you Demi
Loved this so much 💕 youre such an inspiration 😍
Some Demi Fan help me please. What songs did she sing in the documentary, they all sounded so good
oh my goodness. when the credits hit so did the tears. omg this documentary is so important and im so glad that she's thriving and taking better care of herself. a demi - hayley williams collab would sound great
I want to describe my feelings but I just. Can't. I am speechless and in awe. I just love her so much
Damn.......like really DAMN this made me cry so much but lightened my mood af, I was feeling down this whole week, crying everyday, skipping school to stay asleep and cry until watching this, this gave me a boost, exactly how Stay strong once helped me through my struggles but I had no idea she went through this much after that, she is a REAL rolemodel, This woman right there is amazing inspiring and astonishing apart from her immune talent, i've always been and will always be a Lovatic since day 1.
This doc brought me to tears.................. luv u Demi !!!
This is the fake it shit I ever watch lol
Astonishing how young to have been thru life so fast but it made me grow up fast too Thank you for this its good to be proactive with these struggles and face them right on girl sadly my story ended up with a child after drunk days and drugs at 17 but working in the health field futhering my education even with four kids at 24 and a husband with PTSD now 29 my life is good we have so much in life to live for keep being proactive and sharing your story it helps helps you grow every day i promise you
Thank you for sharing so much with us Demi. During this I felt so much relation to you even though I've never met you.I laughed. I cried. I don't know what else to say besides thank you.
I’ve watched this 3 times through ahaha xx
Wow ,Just wow this was the most incredible documentary of your life and battles you still continue to deal with Demi but also it's just showed me that your an amazing and strong person for going through all these things.. But also it's makes me have this new respect and admiration towards you and I love your music it's so inspirational to me ..I send you a huge hug but also all my love Demi !!.. Your such an inspiration to me and Stay Strong you will get through these tough struggles and win them like the warrior you are .. Hugs and kisses Thank you for sharing your hard journey with us your fans ... xoxoxo
Wow im just so shocked i loved her before and just the beginning upsetted me not in a bad way just made me sad seeing her scared. seeing this side of her made me realise she is a bigger and stronger person and  how she needed help. i glad she seeked help and she came back bigger and badder than anyone celebrity i've seen. that's why i love her and this documentary
I liked her better before
it is so sad to see how Demi's childhood was destroyed
Wow. I ran out of tissues. I love you Demi. My heart is full of gratitude for you. Thank you for being a wonderful woman.
Literally this whole thing is just about demi feeling bad for herself lmao I hate stupid privileged bitches like this
WHAT was the song at 58:09
Watching this made me care about my life the way I didn’t see it before, Demi Lovato is such an amazing strong human being that I want to be like. She’ll always be my role model 💕 I love you Demi 😢❤️🏳️‍🌈
WOW, what a amazing voice and its great she has turned her life around, and can now use that as fuel for her songwriting  and she is a stunning woman
Excellent  Demi, your honesty & candour is rare to see.\nYour So talented, Beautiful. & A fantastic role model for your\nAudience!\nSending Positive vibes your way!\nPEACE LOVE & DREAMS! 🇨🇦\n💝🗺🌐📷🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟✔🎃🍃☠🍁😱🕊💞💭❣🎬
this shows you can never judge a book by its cover!! & this is beautiful ♡
Demi’s voice always gives me chills. And her story has kept me going through out the years. She is so strong and amazing and used her voice to help everyone. She is my idol and i’ve never been happier for an artist than i am for her.❤️
She's truly unreal.. It didn't matter that she fell apart, it was how she put herself back together.
Finally I accompanied him and singing :)
So much Respect for you Demi Happy to hear your smashing your demons! Very brave to tell your story and important for others to hear. God Bless xx
a QUEEN in every single way possible! THANK YOU for being such an inspiration! xoxo
I had no idea... So much love for you girl♥️ You're an amazing person!♥️♥️
I love this and her so much!! Such an inspirational!!
I’ve always loved Demi. But this movie gave me a whole new level of respect for this women. Simply amazing 😍
So inspiring, I love you 💖
Im glad youtube recommended this for me.
Watched this twice in one day . So honest and raw. Loved it ! You are my role model Demi 💕
Demi you are such a beautiful person.  This was a great look into your world and the ups and downs.   Your music makes me want to dance and sometimes cry, you really know how to sing and capture an audience.  I hope nothing but the best for you. Your friend from Buffalo NY
I dont understand english flawlessly can someone tell me from when exactly to when she used cocain and Stuff ? Ty
This was absolutely incredible - I don't even know what to comment, I'm just so SHOOK!
Demi, you're a great inspiration... Just, WOW!!
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, MY LITTLE ANGEL<3
Omg!! What an inspirational woman... just wow!! I've never had a woman crush until now, with Demi...
So much respect for you girl. I know telling your story was not easy. And going through all that was not easy. But you are truly a strong person. To have fought the battles. Especially the ones going on inside your own head. You are a inspiration. You are someone who should be praised on coming out of this strong. Very proud of you and will always be a fan.
One of the absolute best things I have ever watched ! I'm so proud of Demi for overcoming what she has overcome and fighting so hard to get to where she is today. She is bold. She is beautiful. She is an absolute inspiration to all us young girls. She stumbled as a teenager but she got back up and proved that no matter where you are in life... with hard work and perseverance you will make it through.
I wanna give her a hug 😊
I'm happy for you. Know that I am.
hello i am dejaah i am 13 years old and i struggle w/ depression this is something that few know because i hide it so  well. You have become so much of an inspiration to me. I love u. I am not a great singer but i can sing i am an alright song for my age. I adore you. Your story has reached out to me and holds  me so tight. My best friend and i we have this amazing thing in us that we are trying to share we feel destined to be great to be stars. But, due to the area we live this is so hard. I slit my wrists, not the main vain i dont slit that deep. I do it because i want to die but i want to live to prove the people that tell me that i am worthless wrong. My family and i we work so hard, Sometimes i get worried that my parents will die from stress and i don't know what to do. Your music truly helps me. I make heavena songs but i haven't gotten to the demi lovato point. That is a place i wish to be. I love dancing but again where i live it's hard to pursue american like carers. I live in jamaica btw. So demi if you c this it would mean the world to me to have you just reach out to me and help me. I know this is  a long shot and i probably will just go unnoticed in the crowd of comments but I wanna try. Please don't pass over my comment please. I am not asking you to take me to america and basically make me i just want help and it would mean the world to me to have help from my idol. Just listen to my story. Find me on Instagram @highoffjhay I might change my user name so just search my name if you can't find it. My name is Dejaah. Please like this comment so that demi can c it.
This is actually a very inspirational story, which tells that life is nothing without experiencing struggles
Wooow! I love you Demi! You're incredible 💜
Holy shit. Speechless. :') 💕

My nigga kneeled on the table! Lol
This needs to be its own show on ESPN

“He said he was my twin brother from my step dad” 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Will the real Stephen a please stand up
😂😂😂
Lmaoooo Jamie foxxx 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We need Cleveland A. Smith, Stephen A. Smith & Stephen B. Smith on all the same time. That would be hilarious
To the people saying he's not wearing pants do you know how hard it would be to kneel on that table with slacks on like he did.
Stephen B. Smith was better
Hahahahahahahaha.... LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO.... Cleveland A. Smith hairline sitting in the middle of his fuckin head.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂....Jamie you're a fuckin animal for that one!!!!
It was all funny until the nigga didn't have on no pants on the table
Cleveland A Smith is the best thing that has happened to First Take since skip left. Hilarious Fox hilarious.
Ay Cleveland A , ain't known you long enough to_0_uHHm know u with no pants & a cereal bowl haircut...(heh), bro...no want, to ever, ever , ever see you in ya undaroo's. You n Jaime need to quit showin ya legs n whatnot to the world. You did'nt even make Stephen A nothing, but a paycheck, remember bring more laughs next round.
I'll kneel pulls up his suit jacket with no pants on 😂😂😂😂.  The hairline and impersonation is dead on.  Man Jamie is a living legend.
I'm not afraid, he's a sell out....See I'll kneel, in front of everybody
LOOK AT HIM ...GET OUT ....GET OUT .... I'LL KNEEL
Lmfao, my sides hurt!😂 Cleveland A. Smith needs to comeback.
lol. that's new.
Couldn’t get past the first couple seconds
Jamie fox went in on S.A.S hair line 😂 he needs a spot on first take !
That was gay ass fuck
It’s nice to see someone making a joke about taking a knee, because that’s exactly what it’s become.
Man Jamie Foxx has SAS impression down to the T!!!! I love it.......
Funny but where are his pants
This s***'s gay as f*** Jamie Foxx and even funny nowadays maybe like 15 years ago
What kind of racist shit is that?
What happened to his hair line 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂\nOh i think i get it!\nJamie Foxx didn't wear no pants. because he wanted to #APPEAL to the #GAY COMMUNITY!\nDam these comedians will sell out their own gender LITERALLY! lol
I would replace Stephen A with Cleveland A on the show
How did Stephen a smith keep a straight face?
I am the 1k like! 😂
the tears will simply NOT stop streaming down my cheeks.  lmmfao!
I was waiting for Cleveland to tell SAS you were wrong bout Kwame Brown, hes better then Jordan
I couldn't tell which was which XD
This nigga song got no pants on...
Is this like that Rock and Morty episode, where those bacteria from another planet created new memories of people that never existed?
Cleveland A Smith is a better smith than Steven A.
Jamie foxx isn't funny, stop trying to make him out to be.
The A is for Asian!!!! rofl
I think this impersonation is starting to get played out. It ain't that funny anymore!!
As annoying as stephen a coon is...this show >>>> the show skip trollis is on
Jamie Foxx has been gay for so long now
We're gonna all just act like jamie aint light weight call him a coon...by the kneeling thing
PLEASE DO A SEGMENT ON MAX KELLERMAN'S RAP CAREER FIRST TAKE
Stephen A. dresses like an upgraded Michael Jordan, thats not sayin much.

Umm, not funny.  Good wardrobe, but yea, not funny.
The more I watch Fleurs videos, the more I want to meet her for a cuppa and just chat!  Xx
Love your colourful scarf!😍
Is this a shopping channel?
a very nice haul
Is anyone else giggling thinking she's so pregnant it's adorable?! Because I am. \n\n\nit's..blue... Hehehehehe
That coat, omg! I love it so much! The colour is fab and it suits you so well :)
Awesome outfits! I make videos too. If you want to you can check them out ☺
I love how happy you look at the moment, being pregnant honestly suits you so much, it's like you've got your youtube spark back 💞
Nice
wow that pink-red scarf is amazing!!
S
Cute, cute, cute!!!   Looking fab, Fleur!
Airforce blue maybe? 🤔 xx
Fleur, you must try Common Projects sneakers - so comfy!!!
Get it girl 👌🏽👌🏽
Шо за піздєц?
What is your nail colour 😍
Hey Fleur, where’s the black t shirt you’re wearing from? Love it xxxxxx
Love the Nina Kendosa stuff! Lots of nice things on their website.
Love this haul, I need that Zara scarf in my life! Where about's is the love me t shit from that you are wearing? Hope the pregnancy is going well, you look great xx
lol I feel like your thoughts on the pains of dressing when pregnant are just the same as my everyday pain of dressing when being a fatass. \n\nStill, you look awesome and your style 👌
Where can I get your tragus earring please?
Next time your in Chicago you should go to the all saints outlet...unless they have one in the UK?
I can tell you have changed sense you've been pregnant, in a good way. You are much more laid back and seem  genuinely more content.
Like this view better!
That all saints dress though😩😩 I think my bank balance is about to take a round house kick to the face 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ I LOVE it!!! Looking gorge too Fleur x
Hi fleur I like the video setup really like the cardigans on you.you look amazing and so happyxx😀
You're amazing! I prefer the main set up but this was still so lovely to watch :)
vans waffle gum sole designed to grip your skateboard consistently... but you knew that
I kind of love he less professional camera look but both are nicr
You're looking so beautiful I know everyone probably saids it to you but you're glowing! Your hair looks so thick, shiny, healthy and pretty
you look beautiful in this video, fleur :)
You guys are talking about 3-4 children. You will use the black 2 piece if that is the case!
Fleur, I've been watching you for years and I've JUST realised what it is about you -- you smile like Ariel. How charming.
What do you use to curl your hair? Your hair is amazing!!! Xx
You're looking beautiful as ever. X
Fleur, your necklace is lovely. Where is it from?
natural light is okay with me, cause it's more real street looking when you tried on many clothes.
I like this for hauls and the other for more close up, like for tutorials, makeup, etc.
The dusty cardigan with the waist cinching suites you really well! 😊
I don't think this camera looks less professional! Works great for haul videos!
You look so pretty and your hair so shiny!! You should definitely put down what lipstick you're wearing in your description box, I always look for it and its never there!
🌸 awesome 🌸 but would be less distracting if you'd look into the lens instead above it  😉 since you don't need to check if you are in frame all the time..
I don't mind this set up for a more casual vibe but prefer the usual set up x
I like the set up with the vlog camera! You also look stunning in this video!x
Please could you look into the lens rather than at yourself in the viewfinder with these types of videos? \nIt's just a little off putting having you look up rather than directly forward.
Love the All Saints 2 pc. However, you won't wear it after. Trust me! So enjoy wearing it now and for the rest of your pregnancy. You look gorgeous! x
The All Saints two piece set is so pretty!
You should try and invest in maternity clothing that doubles as nursing clothing.  You'll thank yourself when you've had the baby and need clothes to wear when the relatives/friends come over in the first month and you're still in pain from the birth (when you can't go out or don't have time to online shop haha).
LOVE this camera! Also it's fun seeing you in slightly ditzy baby brain mode :'D
I must say I prefer the normal setting to this... Love watching u!
Need more lighting it’s a bit dark
I never wore maternity clothing while pregnant  not even jeans
Great Autumn Haul....love your purchases!  Thanks for sharing with us.
I think the two cardigans you got in Paris will look very nice with a plain tight white t-shirt tucked into jeans (for non-pregnant wear in the future). 💖
Which vlog camera do you use Fleur? Loved this! Xo
Love this camera set up, I  feel more at home visiting you when it is less Professional....
the jumper/dress is amazing! you look so so good in it!
I like this camera a lot! X
Grey Scarf from Asos looks more blue on camera? I love my chunky scarf too in winter and a less chinky material mix polyester and cotton when there is a chill in the air. I love like a wine colour coat or a deep green during winter season's. Also knee boots and ankle shoes. And wouldn't be winter if you don't have chunky jumpers too which i love to wear when the cold weather comes in.
Love pregnant Fleur! You're so chilled and spacy LOL
Oh my god!! That All Saints dress!!! 😍
I think you have the best style, always feel like I need to do some serious shopping after I watch your hauls!
Those Vans sneakers just reminded me of a boy who was lying to me and was a complete jerk, and he always wore those shoes and nothing else, he just liked them so much. I did have a crush on him at first because he seemed so nice, but eventually he showed his real face. I hate being reminded of him, but oh well... xD Love the scarfs though! <3
Pregnancy really suits you - you are truly glowing xx
I love the setup.  And all the sweaters!
Loving this setup! As well as the fun extra comments from the pregnancy brain haha x
I'm sick of seeing this Toni and guy ad before every YouTube video!!!
I love this video, and I prefer this camera, it's wonderfullly sharp.
Your love of scarves will come in handy when Bub arrives, cover breast leakage if you breastfeed and vomit or poop if it gets on you. Love the grey scarf.
I loved this! Its great seeing autumnal pieces that can be used during pregnancy because I think a lot of pregnant women just want to feel like they're in normal clothes. I liked the camera too, personally I would just used it for the rest of your pregnancy if it's easier 😛
I’d call the cardi towards the end “denim blue”
you look so beautiful, Fleur! love the hair...it looks amazing!\nloved all the pieces...especially the scarf from zara and the coat! \nthe setup is just fine! go with it!❤️😘
What lipstick are you wearing, Fleur? Love the video ♥️
I really like the “less professional” look! I liked youtube much more 5 years ago, so a video that is (still very well made) not like a professional TV production is refreshing:)
Love this video too and your set up is very good - nothing to change Fleur. Could you also make a video at some point of your preferred brands for basics such as knitwear, scarfs etc. Thanks!
The two piece black dress is beautiful on you!
If you like that floaty style, there’s a brand called “LOGO” on QVC that is all lovely and comfy like that. You might find a few more pieces that you’d like!
Love the new setup!
You look fab and loving your hair
You have such a nice voice, I want you on my sat Nav 😀
Yes keep using this camera~ its loads better (no blurry back ground) woo hoo x
If u sub me I will sub back , let's help each other out xxxxx
1: your hair is AMAZING\n2: I like the normal set up for tutorials and favorites, but this is ok for first impressions and reviews - it's up to you anyway.\n3: I love the fact that you mix pregnant clothes with normal clothes. My friend is pregnant and she's had enough of pregnant clothes.
I'd like a mix of both camera style :)
I like both of them 😊 but this is way more cozy😄
i like your necklace Fleur! i like either set up.. the cut aways with this one it was kinda hard to see good. like was that a high low sweater? or was a longer piece attached? also, buy yourself a nice clothes steamer! changed my life girl! xo editing.. buy the steamer and then say In your face Mike De Force! LOL xoxoxo
Fleur you need a handheld steamer!!  It is seriously life changing - no more ironing ever!  Works perfectly on something like that top you have and you can travel with it as well.
You should totally do a trainers / tennis shoes collection video! 😄
Both set-ups are great. It just depends on the type of videos you're filming. It's also nice to switch things up every now and then.
Love it Fleur!!!! You are by far my fav youtuber 💝💝💝💝
Hold the phone.....'soopergus?!!'\n\nI thought they were called super-gas?!!
I think the setup is great and you look so beautiful I cannot stop smiling to your video 😁sending lots of love from Denmark 🇩🇰❤️❤️❤️
Pregnancy brain is a real thing medically! All your blood is going to the baby and not your brain! (;
Aww what a lovely haul and absolutely love seeing you so happy :D
Ha ha so confused - reading the text on the screen for the white sneakers as Super Gas and Fleur is saying Supérges what even is that name? 😬
Like vlog setup and if it's easier then do it - you're gonna need all the shortcuts in the world to make life easier once the baballoo arrives.  Be kind to yourself honey.
Number 3 on trending! Wowee. I like this camera, I like the informality for a change. It's like Skyping a friend. And bless you for looking so happy with your lovely bump xx
Fleur you look amazing pregnant! So glowing and your hair grew loads too! Good luck and keep posting these videos, love your vlogs with mike, you too are such cuties!xx
I need a new cardigan...I had a really nice white one but I spilled permanent paint on it (I didn't know it at the time) and it's in a really obvious place. Totally heartbroken.\n\nGreat video! I have an awesome color block scarf from Anthropologie that reminds me of your Zara one!\n\nI like the vlog camera as I think it is the best at capturing natural light (which is also easier on my sensitive eyes) but I'm also not picky. :)
If ya'll like our accent so much, you should come to NZ and hear it face to face. We sound awful, lmao
Omg! What a perfect specimen of a human being! 😭❤️
I can’t get over how adorable he is & when he laughs it’s so genuine and so cutE
Wait what why’s he’s voice sound like that
He's so beautiful wtf 😍😍😍
wow don't you love when everything that was making you not lose hope in a show is crushed in under 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
I just noticed that his eyes match his hair
Omfg when he said he hasn't seen stranger things..... DEAD. WTF KJ?!?!?
THE STRANGER THINGS REFERENCE THEORY GOT ME SHOOK
I WANT TO LOVE HIM BUT HE HASN’T SEEN STRANGER THINGS\n\nAlso 6 Days I am so freaking excited anyone else??
IT ISNT TONI FUCK IT, i have a feeling hope it could go to josie
it hurt me heart when he didn’t get the stranger things reference but i still love kj
My names Toni and to hear him say it made my heart melt 😭😭😭❤️❤️
His reaction to Cheryl maybe being Archies twin is saaaaaaah cute! 😍
i’m so down with resurrecting jason\ni’ll even do it myself\n(winc)
Jason being Archie's twin would be cool, but I think even the cast and crew forget that Jason and Cheryl are older than the rest. If Jason was supposed to be a senior so would Cheryl. The rest are sophomores
The cast agreed in an interview that people with magic powers would make the show seem unrealistic and make the issues in it seem less important. unless they be trying to cover up some shit cause if sabrina comes i'm gonna flip my shit I already didn't like that teacher boo boo \n\n*sits flipping out now thinking of peoples theories you know becoming an emotional wreck like I was when the first season ended with Archies dad being shot and hearing bughead might end next season you know the usual)
THE TEA YES PLEASE
hey not ALL of these were absurd though. a couple were actually really great
nothing cuter in this world than this video.
My best friend has a little girl crush on KJ hahahaha I love her
I’m in love
Can't stop staring at his face he's so gorgeous wow
I didn't realise his ACCENT!!!
he feels so different regularly than the TV show\n\n\nbut damn hes hot
He’s so cute wow
Has anyone heard kjs stomach growling at the beginning
I stopped smiling when he said he doesn't know what Stranger Things is.
I’ll cry if Sabrina the teenage witch is in it I don’t want herrrrrr I don’t need anymore supernatural shows
His hair reminds me of fried chicken.
IM TEARING UP VUX OF THE FP THEORY CUZ THATS LIKE THE BST FUCKING MVOIES EVER AND I'm now in deep thought about it
Oh God he’s so happy at 1:35 😂❤️
« I haven’t seen stranger things either » shut yo mouth Ik you did
I ship Archie and Betty DONT @ ME
I feel like Cheryl Blossom's love interest will be Chic Cooper (Betty's older brother).
I love his voice sm his accent is amazing
I stg if Archie and Cheryl become a thing I'm gonna run into a bottomless pit
The first one is from Pretty Little Liars😝
HOW HAS KJ APA NOT SEEN STRANGER THINGS!!!!!
I WOULD LICK EVERY SINGLE INCH OF HIS NAKED BODY 😂😂😂😂😂😂
he's so different from archie, i'm not sure which one i love more
Is it just me or does his hair look more orange this season?
I love that I live like 20 mins away from Auckland home
1:37 oh shit they got it
This guys really nice in real life.
so I’m like obsessed with pillowcase in the sky and he sings it and I’m like yoooooo what?
HE'S FROM NEW ZEALAND?! I'M FROM ZEALAND!!\nNZ SQUAD
0:57 imagine him looking at you like that
I love you kj
I love the fact that he didnt get the fp is billy from scream reference
I love his laugh
I love the stranger things theorie
He has such a perfect all-American accent for the show, I love hearing him speak like his Kiwi self!
1:40 I had the same reaction... I LOVE IT AND KJ!!❤️😍❤️
FP's name is Forsythe Pendleton Jones II (or Jr.) so that theory is a no
1:38 i love the way he reacted 😂😍
How has he not seen Scream though!!? 🤦🏽‍♀️ Bad KJ! Real Bad.
the only paper he didn’t crumble up is the one that said archie is actually jason’s twin!! which would make sense as to why archie is the main character which I didn’t understand so much last season... ugh I hope this is true!! it would be so twisted & unexpected!!
Could he be any more hot?!
1:42 he's so cute
I really hope that Sabrina the Teenage Witch doesn’t come to the show. I like the fact that this isn’t about supernatural events and things that don’t exist.
RIVERDALE IS THE UPSIDE DOWN. BARB IS ARCHIE'S MOM
*what a beautiful, pure, soul <3*
KJ JUST SAID CHERYL AND TONI WON'T BE A THING I'M DELETING MY NETFLIX ACCOUNT AND THROWING AWAY MY TV
He is so good looking 😍😍
Okay but why is no one talking about how on point he looks...
I love how he’s just casually giving out spoilers
Is it odd that I love KJ but can't stand Archie at times? I guess that's what good acting looks like 🤣
its weird hearing him without the american accent
I love how his eyes changed from dark brown in the show to light brownish hazel in this video
noooo the theory about Cheryl and Toni is considered absurd
His laugh I can’t.
KJ Apa is an passionate actor.
MY LOVE X
Hes so fucking hot god damnnnn ❤👅 hes a really good actor too like shit Riverdale was LITTTT
gnarliness
fp is actually billy 😂

Is this promoting beastiality in some way?
Fuck YA KID!!!  I saw you play a portion of that during your interview w/ Dan Rather?  Sounds good, and good for you man!!!  A guy can only bust his ass for so long, until he buys into the BS or moves to a mountain top w/ a bunch of real folks!  God Bless ya man, but don't run for Congress...they'll fucking slaughter you during the Campaign, let Uncle Ted handle that shit!\n\nOH yeah, Fuck Marshal, the only good song he ever did was w/ you on Devil w/o a cause!  PEACE
It's amazing how Morrissey can make the most mundane things sound so intelligent. This is the 4th time I've visited this video today. I cant get the song out of my head. <3
You don't love someone for their looks, or their clothes, or for their fancy car, but because they sing a song only you can hear.
Squirrels jump and do interesting things, but nobody seems to notice.
Loving the new track Morrisey!! I try an acoustic cover of this song, really easy to play, lyrics are superb! Go on, Giveitashot. 💣
is joey barton the one who suddenly got a french accent when he went to france
Pure songwriting craft--which so few artists have today.
This is shite for Morrissey
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig-\nChop Top, he says I'm gonna win big\nChoose not a life of imitation\nDistant cousin to the reservation!\n\nWait, wrong song?
Why's Joey Barton in the video?
am i watching the sopranos?
I tell you what there all coming back Morrissey Paul Weller and the Gallagher brothers there keeping proper British music alive
Nice of Marilyn Manson to appear on stage!
my 14 year old son clocked joey barton straight away lol
Pick em up and set em down!!! Do you feel dizzy? Do you feel faint? ....Jesus h Christ!!! I think you got a hard on !!!
He is still the man peeps, if himself and Johnny marr could just bury the hatchet and get on the road one more time....not that he needs to, Moz is amazing live! Viva Mozza!!
I've literally only just woke up at 2 PM so i thought it was only right to play this amazing song
Not the greatest Moz tune, but good to see something new.
that smirk when he says no castration. me too
great brave record. i dont understand the significance of the bus train etc.
Time do as I wish...oh time do as I wish!
Universal credit .......rolls out with  apathy from The Tories.
He is so handsome!!!!! I love him. God saves Moz. :P
443 people have been brainwashed by the news.
This is sooooo good....got me addicted....no bus no boss....
The king is here💖
Still the man .great lyrics .makes me smile !
I spent the day in bed\nWatching meme compilations\nI love my bed \n\nAnd I recommend that you stop, watching keemstar \nBecause the news contrives to normifie you
EXTREMELY relevant song for our times. Thank you Moz.
One of the very few I'd describe as an idol of mine, but his albums since years of refusal have been shocking. If he still enjoys it fine, but world peace was a terrible record and if this is anything to go by, the new one won't be any better...
Cool keyboard intro. I wanna hear that sampled soon
New music: very Good.
love this ! i like the way he falls of the seat at the end lol, your the one for me fatty xx. what a great message to send out as well it reminds me of timothy leary turn on - tune in and spend the day in bed
I love this song so much!!!
I'm guessing somebody confined to a wheelchair will be offended by the opening. Par for the course.
Yup ... I love this song 😊🎧
His writing is not as impressive as earlier days. Lyrically he has become too literal.
Write your own music. Then we can talk. 🙂
I love this man 10 out off 10 class Morrissey
MORRISSEY I LOVE YOU GOD
the famous macunian is back,at last!
What is that man doing here?
Wheel around the fountain.
I'm late to the party but I love this
Such a good tune and lyric, as only Morrissey can do
Remember when Morrissey’s music was garbage ?\n\n\nYeah me neither
Wonderful!  Uplifting..for him.😊
Does morriessy is gay?
lovely
Love love love. That voice has always made me completely fulfilled.
Where is the Rock?
me
Possibly the best song he has done solo, and close to the best of Smiths songs.
Listening to this while I'm un bed hehehe
Stop watching the news!\nBecause the news contrives to frighten you\nTo make you feel small and alone\nTo make you feel that your mind isn't your own\n\nthanks for this, the brainwashing continues but we can stop it by stop watching the propaganda day in day out
Mega this
Vaya basura le salio
3:24 say that word again
Love this 👍😁
Verrie happy❤️🙆🏻
Good
Welcome back Moz!
I like Robbie Williams
lovely stuff
Fly planes into CNN, bomb Fox News.
Oh damn
Divine David brill!!
Hurrah! Words of truth! Well done Supermorrissey
Relatable song title :')
НУ , ТАК И Я УМЕЮ!
Nice.
Terrible and generic.
I love this!!
Joey Barton? wats he doing here??
Dead whish
Fucking class ma g
great, great video
🇲🇽 viva México, grande morrisey
hes gonna b playing soon people.. Hollywood!
My plans for tomorrow)
Brilliant
Lenda viva \n\nViva Moz!!!!!!
Awesome
Joey Barton?
Love you Morrissey greece
Looooveeee
Morrissey on top form!
me encanta
Une voix pour l'éternité
The Moz still is the boss  Capo di tutti lei capi  oigan
Questa canzone é fantastica, Morrisey la scritta per me
i hate this it is so sh*t
wasn't too crazy about the song when I first heard it but then he got me..heard it again..now I can't stop!!! dammit moz!!
Very good advice in regards to the news.
Ah good old Morrissey - by which I mean from 1986. No interest in a sad old man that announces he nearly voted for Nigel Farage/UKIP, and thinks the UK should cease all foreign aid packages. Black on the inside? He's an assh*le on the inside!! Kids should stop paying attention to his easy-listening charisma, and the fact that the Smiths are a good band with that one song and realise what a horrible person he became in middle age.
I can't listen to (or defend) this bloated racist anymore.
Holy shit this is good
The more compressed the imagery the better
This dude is cool any other songs worth a listen?
Joey Barton.\nThe thinking man's twat.
Btw.if Manchester is dreary,you should try smacclesfield!! , However wot kind of coffee does J B partake of??? .....ATB from soggy south Macclesfield..,# sk10 2hn ..... Cally dreamer no western Pennine precipitation....,🤡🤠😇
Loving these business videos :)
I worked for Amazon for a while. It was the worst decision I ever made. They treat you like slaves, will fire you for any reason, and are generally way too demanding. And they pay lower than pretty much everyone else. I regret every second I spent with that company.
Its a good thing in the long run that chain stores full of cheap shit are dying out.
You also forgot to mention that sex toys are also big sellers of amaZon
Walmazon or Amamart will control the world.
amazon is way better in my opinion but when is either of these companies going to get into the selling market
Walmart and Amazon are kids compared to Alibaba.
You guys should do UPS vs FedEx. I think that would be an interesting video
37 of these 2.3 million employees are cashiers
What do u call a gorilla in a suit? \n\n\nRead more
Walmart has like 20 check outs but only 4 are open.
1992 was when we elected Clinton too. Just saying that Wal-Mart is the dredges of society. There's a reason things are cheaper there. Subsidies for the company for hiring people needing social assistance, but only giving them enough hours to shop in their stores.  At least Amazon is full of many retailers and it's own company's distribution centers.
Ohh maybe a video on how costco for comparison since it seems that they pay their employees pretty well for retail/more employee retension?
When you know nothing about Walmart because you live in the uk
Elon Musk did not make paypal
Uss zumwalt vs type 055 destroyer
Wait. How about Craigslist?
amazon pays near twice as much as walmart. I dont understand how the ending could be true.
I've worKed at Walmart, their management is lackluster but Canadian working conditions aren't bad. The wages start at minimum but I got $12.40 an hour after a store renovation. Not bad.
When only one company dominate the market, we gonna pay more. Wait to see it!
Walmart is expensive for groceries. Aldi is where it's at.
Imagine if people woke up and stop buying from these major contributors to climate change..
disorder suburban his project orientation save inevitable acceptable guidance out.
pretty sure sam walton's 10 business rules really are:\n#1 MAKE MONEY BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY\n#2 - #10 repeat #1
Amazon’s warehouse was definitely a sweatshop
As much as I know, both are scams.
That's like sounds like  how rich people argue.
I’m a amazon worker and yeah it’s true\n\nFor the 10 hours we work we get three breaks two 15 minutes and one 30 minute lunch time.after working for 2 and a half hours. But the sad thing is it takes around 4-5 mins to get to the break room so at the end the 15 minutes are only 5 minutes of sitting down\n\nAnd then the 30 minute lunch time. \nThe lunch canteen is located on the 2nd floor, I worked on the 4th floor so it took around 6 mins to go to the canteen and get food and it took the same time to get packed lunch from floor 1 lockers. So at the end you only got around 16 mins of lunch time \n\nAnd for the first few weeks they tell you to work faster everyday and will keep on telling you if you’re work rate isn’t 100 percent (250 items per hour). And if you do get a good rate they don’t really tell you about it unless you had the best rate on the whole floor which are usually the more experienced ones.
Ok this isn’t the best topic to say for this video, but can you PLEASE make a video about Australia 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺\nBtw, nice video 👍
The video I did not know I needed.
So much money is involved, it's crazy
What about E Bay?
Please Make a video on  what if the ants where size of humans\nIt would be very fun to know
obviously, because Walmart didn't sell sex toys, Amazon this more bigger and productive.
Key: Amazon is the future.\nWalmart will have no choice but to bow down in the long run.
I work for Amazon in a big warehouse. They do try to make us work hard and do like twice as much work sometimes. But otherwise it's a great job.
How you make videos so fast
I work at Walmart and the reason why they are not on top of Amazon is because they are not innovative at all
Actually I am not supposed to say this; but I work for Amazon and it's true. Yeah they have great benefits, the pay is decent and with all comes a great cost. Every day you are in an Amazon warehouse; they make sure you are there to work, no cell phones are allowed in the building and they make you go through security every break. Which also adds to the fact that you're being heavily watched with cameras at all times, no matter the hallway, corner, shelf, station you are on, they have eyes on you and you can easily get written up for any reason. Customer satisfaction and customer demand for fast packages every day only gets worst as time goes by, every day new internet users are buying more and more and more, and Amazon can't keep up to be honest, hiring people constantly to fill jobs up, sitting is never allowed unless it's during break. They LITERALLY make sure you are worth what they're paying you for a while shift. Not to mention you have to reach limits and number expectations per day, and if you reach them and your shift is not over, you better keep working because the computer tracks every single minute you were not active and if you are inactive for more than 30 minutes on the job, the managers job is to come by and talk to you about it and then decide to wether write you up or fire you. Amazon's expectafions are at an all time high. But somehow Amazon is still such a great place for me to work at and feel like I'm doing something in this world seeing a different package go by to different parts of the world is the best part.
Bilka! any danes..? no..?
Profit and earnings are not the same. The fact is Amazon has no profit because it keeps investing all its money into itself. Not sure where you get your stats but you may want to check them again or re-educate yourself before you get sued for spreading misinformation.
I work for Walmart and we're gonna keep tearing Amazon apart!
Amazon is way better than Wal Mart.
Average American vs Average Mexican Please
amazon because they sell items that walmart dose not
Amazon is the future, considering the fact that they always do good by me and the majority of people I know of. Positive service leads to return business. Reliability leads to return business. Amazon will get all the business then.
I work for Walmart DC and can say I am paid quite generously. But... I can also say that you earn every penny by the amount of strenuous labor you put in each shift.
I really don’t care which is more successful to be honest, because at the end of the day it makes no difference to me financially   because none of them is putting money in my pocket. As a prime member I simply must say this though. I do not think it’s worth the prime membership fee just to get free two day shipping because 99% of the time I have to go and stand in line at that sorry as US postal station for two hours just to get my fucking package because they always come to deliver when people are at work and claim they attempted delivery which is not always true. I took a day off from work just to wait for my package and they never came and claimed they attempted delivery. Happened more than once by the way. Amazon, please stop using the US postal service if you want to keep me as a prime member because they really fucking suck.
Amazon has a higher ceiling cap than Walmart, unless Walmart completely changes their methods. Amazon just needs to pay their employees a little better if what this video says is true.
Well I've worked for Amazon and never had a problem
If you have noticed, Walmart employs nearly 1% of our country's population not counting people worked there before, it's ridiculous
Hate walmart.... They do a lot of shady things to the people that work for them in the us.
This is a dumb question.
Which Manchester soccer team would that be?
Has 2.3 million employees but there’s only 3 registers open?
Idea:how much tv people watch in a live time
And do you know why Amazon makes more? But they can sell sex toys. A buddie if mine works in the factory and says that's all they sell
I am 17 Syl. I just wanted to make sure if you know. Feel free to tell me if you'd like to hold off on the relationship until I'm 18.
Millenials couldn't remember a time when they can't purchase online? First sentence couldn't get more wrong, for a channel that apparently sells information.\nMy windows 98 barely could handle a floppy disk, dammit.
Walmart master race it’s close by my house and I don’t want to wait weeks the get my product
You should do the Average North American vs the Average South American
you forgot to start that Walmart now sells mostly Made in China goods.
Amazon makes more because Amazon sells sex toys and Walmart can't or won't sell sex toys. Amazon does. A friend of mine works in the warehouse and he says they sell a ton of them!
Jeff bezos is the second richest person in the world. For 1 day throughout the summer he actually reached #1 but Amazon's shares fell.
Walmart has been around a lot longer then Amazon has. Amazon is catching up very fast and will soon take over Walmart. I’ve worked for Walmart and I’m currently employed by Amazon and amazon is far better to work for in my opinion.
Sam Walton started the Walmart practice of busting unions, instead favoring having his workers air out their grievances within the company system where they can either be ignored in favor for the company's interests or solutions (often bandaid) can be sloppily implemented at a snail's pace due to the highly bureaucratic nature of Walmart's system.
Amazon's quadcopters will bring along so many laws. You wouldn't even be able to look at the things wrongly
People will always want to shop.  Walmart won't go anywhere.
Can you make a video on who would win if a world war broke out between the United States and North Korea with their respective allies?\n\nlike if you would love to see this video
Unless and until they perfect GPS, drones will never be a viable alternative for delivery. I use a GPS everyday and a GPS can be off as little as 5 feet to half a mile. Not to mention the kids that will be knocking these drones out of the sky for fun.
For that you require poor desperate people lol, so true, so true.
Do modern USA v.s ancient Rome and Greece combined
Manchester isn't the 2nd largest UK city
Please do UK vs France!!
I worked at the international wine center, and one of the main share holders of Amazon came in and spent $20,000 on 5 bottles total of wine and liquor. Paid with the amex black card. Was crazy because he was just buying them as gifts
Did someone say destroying small businesses😂😂
When you buy something on Amazon, you support rape culture.
Predatory capitalist tax evaders. Both companies destroying jobs and other small business. Two monopolies that need each other
You can't use CNN as a source, r u dumb?
Nice
You mean Gen Z.
I like Flipkart
Walmart
So....Walmart
alphabeth>amazon

👍🏽Walmart online has come along way.
i really hate walmart.
Pff, easy. Publix.
Amazon doesn’t send me my groceries? So Walmart
How about Sams Club vs Costco?
I like Target better . Less crowded.
Canada vs North Korea
Walmart will vanquish.
I prefer Amazon cause they have kpop merch 😇💞❤
Meijer.
Amazon.

Some people who don't know much about iguanas would say that they could swim under water, they kind of could but this one was NOT a water iguana, they would be a blue/ish shade
Thanks for the ride - very funny 😂
💥👍🏻👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️🎈
WILSONNNNN!!
AWESOME
You're alright man.
Bless youre heart
✋ high five.

Haha funny guy
Lizards swimming are adorable

Thank you Mr. Nakano! Iguanas are amazing. 💕
Awesome dude.
Sweet video :)
Way cool dude. Way cool.
omg nice save👍
This guy. This guy is awesome-sauce 🤗❤️
He just wanted to take a journey across the ocean but his dreams got crushed all thanks to the meddling human and his silly boat. 🙃
GREAT JOB LOVE IT
He was please to come across you out there. Lizard life saved . I think he kind of no's you helped him
That’s was to cool bro! 💪👏🦎
Great video! Really one of a kínd
Been in Florida Keys 4 times, fun place.
There is still some hope after all
That was great, You are a good person
Someones lost pet. Thank you for saving him.
Way Cool !!   It was not by chance you found him.
Ima go swim with some sharks, I'll delete this comment when I'm done. Brb in 5 minutes.
Please save me because I-guana go home!
Stop talking to it, you weirdo.
When lizard people overthrow the world \nYou will be saved \nYou made a great decision that day
Iguana: I was on a quest to colonize new land for my people.
You are awesome,love the commentary,it reflects a good life.
You sir are a badass!
You are one truly honest and blessed man God bless you for this video
Question is what were YOU doing that far
This was more entertaining and fun to watch than some multi million dollar production blockbuster films I've seen.
For all you people who thinks this is fake let me ask you something. Why would this man take an iguana way out of his way 4 miles from shore while fishing and then just let him jump off and go back to the middle of the damn jungle? Morons! Its legit quit hatin
If it can get 4 miles out, it can go 4 miles back. You should have left it smh
How tf is there a iguna in middle of the ocean..
This video is b******* this guy seen the video of a guy on a boat saving a dog so he threw his own iguana in the water
“Or do you just want a breather and keep swimming to Cuba?”
GREAT SAVE!  I guess that if the boat had been a little quieter You might have been able to get the animal to shore? OUTSTANDING!
Iguana ...4 miles off shore...no way it swam there it prolly fell off a  boat it found itself on earlier
3:03 what is that in the background
Can you show us the video where you take the iguana 4 mile off shore then throw it in the water and the rest we have seen
Thanks for saving her.  She would've drowned after exhaustion.
Best vid I've seen in a while ! Good on you for saving the little bugger..!\n\nCheers
Yay. You saved an out of control species that doesnt belong there and is destroying the place.\nOh wait... one could say that about the humans too...
Selling boat insurance is a lot harder than car insurance
bro there was a Finn in the back ground on the side there was a shark I'm glad he made it
Coolest thing I'll see this week
I salute you fin sir
This video was awesome!! Youre a hero lol
Poor little guy must have been exhausted. Good save! Made me smile:)
Just for that bad ass video im subscribing nice job bro
Does he know there are species of igunas known to go swimming and hunt fish underwater like the galapagos one for example, but it's the thought that counts at least
This the coolest video ever
Thank you for being a decent, compassionate human.
Cool vid man! I did not think he was going to stay when you turned the motor on. Awesome
Good job man, next time your in water and need a boat, you know who's coming for you 😂😂😂
HOPE HE HAD HIM CHECKED FOR ANY PARASITES THAT MAY UPSET THE Ecosystems OF THE U. S. A. YOU KNOW THATS WHY TRUMPS AGAINST IMMIGRATION,FILTHY DISEASE CARRYING LOWER CLASS HEALOTS. 😂 LOL
Damn Steve. I was on Facebook and saw your face on my feed. Nice job on the viral video!!!!
Something else was stranded in the water too at 3:01 in the back rigbt
this is cute yet im curious how the hell an iguana goes 4 miles into water
Thats amazing that u did that❤️👏🏽👏🏽
Appreciate the rid champ , but this is my stop
Go to exactly 3:00 and look in the water on the right
lol that's cute i love the conversation lol
Wow. What a story .. good man
Too bad iguanas are invasive in Florida but at least you saved him
LOL that's funny I thought I was reading your introduction wrong
3:18 you got that gas money?
You’re going viral !! Gonna be a Star now buddy... my girlfriend just asked me if I saw the video of the guy saving an iguana out in ocean lol! You’re a star lol
What a great save!  It was the iguana's lucky day.
Great Job Little guy knows you have something in common we both fear GOD!
Good job man you saved it’s life :D
That's an invasive species. It's probably why it was all fucked up
A great experience I will say...for both of you. Definitely, a lucky iguana.
What a good dude this made me happy
You're video has been stolen by someone on Facebook and it's viral
He earned a subscribe
Cool guy with a kind heart.
You are an amazing person. Thank you for saving the iguana! :)
They are very good swimmers  I bet current got him?
lol - that was funny. Wonder what that dude was doing 4 miles off shore
Great save man!!! Thank you for taking the little fella back to shore👏🏾👏🏾🙏🏾
Amazing video.. only question is .. what in the hell was that iguana doing out 4 miles at sea in the middle of no where and what are the odds of all that space in the ocean and how relatively small it is, that you ran into it? It was a date with destiny my friend. Destiny had you, Key West Fisherman, with.. Iguana.
How did he not get eaten?
I feel like that was god zillas kid and he just kidnapped it.if so we are fucked
Fake the iguana obviously called an uber.
Iguana man take me by the hand lead me to the land that you understand, Iguana man the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
Silly land iguana thinks he's its bigger cousin Marine iguana,you belong the the trees not in the seas\n\n\nOh hey that rhymed !
Not even a thank you... Ungratefull iguana
What a gentleman, thank you!!!
Only 86 miles to Cuba. This is an American Iguana that wants to come back and Make America Great Again.
I bet he threw the iguana in the sea and staged the rescue for the video.\nIguana wouldn't last 40 minutes in the sea. and he magicaly found one in the middle of nowehre? Please
Unfortunately as much as I want to like this because of the cheeks thing that you did it just doesn't look good  he started off right and then you just added too much

Video not available..... whyyyyyyy 😭😭😭😭
There is only two dudes better than me and I'm both of them
Lavar Ball is a great father!
this man is a legend.
5:08 is he talking a bout his own shoes?
Kobe not even in top 5 damn magic even said Kobe is the best laker ever
lmfaooo he threw shade at LaMelo with that hair question they asked
Kinda fuckin stupid that you never actually have these celebrities tweet anything. You just make a new account each time and have an intern write the tweet after-the-fact for editing purposes. Laaaaame. Don't do the whole tweet thing if they aren't actually gonna have the balls to tweet it themselves.\nSecondly it's pretty stupid that you didn't actually have Lavar answer questions directed at him. Some of the questions were asked years ago, before anyone even gave a shit about Lavar. Did you guys really not find enough questions for Lavar, so you had to go back over 4 years just to find some lame ass question? Pathetic.\nThis whole Answers Questions show is utter shit. Just stop trying, you dont deserve the views you get. For anyone telling me not to watch it, I didn't choose to, Youtube recommended this through autoplay.\nAlso, I don't use Twitter, but always thought the tweet bit of this show was bullshit, so thought I'd check it out. And it was indeed bullshit. Their account for Lavar only has 19 followers haha. And they only follow one person - which happens to be some random guy called George Wasgatt. Hahaha that must be their intern.
Worst hair???? I dont know but is not Jaylen Brown. Hahahahahahahah. But seriusly how much can someone admire March Simpson?
For the defense chant question, I would answer this: because if offense is the best defense, defense is the best offense.
At first i thought this was key and peele skit...
I like this side of him lol
W E L C O M E  TO  K R I S P Y  K R E M E
How could anyone dislike this? Haters, positive black role model right here
you cant have 2 centers in 1 team dipshit
He need to clean them teeth
why don’t this guy get his teeth fixed
I love this guy
I thought In the question, Pick your historic Players. I thought he will say,\nLonzo Ball\nLamelo Ball\nLiAngelo Ball\nLaVar Ball \nShaq
This guy is smarter than Albert Einstein lol
This is a very different very sensible side of lavar ball
Too busy being weirded out by his yellow front tooth
I really thought he was gonna say lonzo in all 5 positions or all the ball bros and him
But if offense is quick thers no defence without offence so why is there time to chant defence🤔
I honestly thought for his starting five dream team he was gonna say his family and himself lol
When you realize that he said offense takes less time than defense but if one is quick than the other is quick 😃👈
This guy is a terrible influence on his kids
HABS....Haha this guy don't know NHL hockey!
This guy actually seems pretty cool
This actually made me respect him more than I thought I could lol.
This version of LaVar is the best. Put him on ESPN and he’s unbearable. I expected his top 5 to include himself after hearing all his crap when he’s with SAS.
Bruh this man just used his son for fame....wow smh
Here before a million views.
So much shade being thrown in this video
Lmaooo LaVar said If it's nappy you happy. OUT OF POCKET XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
This guys a piece of shit. Using everyone in his life to get rich
I’m suprised he didn’t put him self in the top 5 all time list or lonzo😂
T H E G O A T
This is the first time I've actually seen him talk some sense 🤔
Wtf he really said shit that actually made sense
I bet his breath smells like mint sauce I dunno why
Everyone make sure you SHARE and SUBSCRIBE to my Channel TheRealSamSmith. I was the one that ran on the field at the Pro Bowl and got tackled by Ezekiel Elliott. #JoinTheFamily #FollowTheJourney
Lol they taped the apple logo
The raptors are one of the best ft shooters! Wtf was that dude talking about. Sixers are the worst
Who else thought this was key from key n peels pretending to me LaVar ball?
I'm surprised lonzo wasn't on his dream team
This is the most normal we’ve seen him.
That motherfucker looks like Admiral Ackbar
I love this dude 😂😂😂
Fuck he shoulda said where he been-at hahaha
🐐
Habs is  hockey thing
That starting lineup tho...
Lavar is a GOAT
Oh those kpop icons
Did he say boner support
I love this
Really lame.
Lavar ball can roast .
*CANCER INCOMIMG*
Lavar almost sounded intelligent...
Lavar Ball for 2018 NBA MVP
“Welcome to Krispy Kreme Donuts” DEAD
what about kobe?
stop giving this clown attention
Ngl he was spitting facts tho
Awesome person man
2:29 2007 Patriots????
LaVar lowkey cool and funny af
Typical coon
Lavar a legend.
This dude gotta fix his teeth
This was fun
I love Lavar😂
Anyone think he sounds like Obama?
the blocked the Apple sign on the laptop lol no promotions unless you advertising me
Lavar how do you take so much care of your teeth?
Only people who don't like lavar are the people who just read headlines and don't actually listen to the man , he's the goat 😂
For all the shit this guy gets he actually seems chill as fuck..
The worst attitude was Rob Artest
I love this nigga, no homo tho.
The ball family’s combined iq is -100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
I'm surprised he didn't pick Kobe Bryant
He ain’t say no dumb shit for once wow
I really appreciate him in this video. He was honest and wasn't like, the loud, crazier version of himself.
Suprisingly the more I listen to this man talk the more I'm starting to be on his side for some reason lol
Dude, his top five is actually perfect. I was surprised that he didn't say himself 5 times though lol
What? Why tf wouldn't he say Lonzo for his dream team
2.2.....
Laver you need to buy toothpaste
For question number 1 I thought lavar was gonna say 1. Lamelo 2. Liangelo 3. LONZO 4. Lidicky 5. Lavar
The offence/defence thing goes both ways so you really do have time to yell offence if you do defence.
Is it me or did lavar actually sound believable in this viy
Check it out when you get a chance thanks🔥https://youtu.be/bNDuEQkDVC8
Lmao lavar 😂
tbh Lavar Ball is a cool dad
Actually, kawhi Leonard has no attitude
Select medical car civilian encourage title tablespoon chemical acquisition.
Surprisingly, this wasn't terrible
Surprised he actually gave sensible  answers
Goat🔥
i feel exactly, like EXACTLY the same way you feel about your nose. i have the same nose as my mum and I’ve gone through ups and downs of not wanting it but ultimately i want to keep it because it reminds me of my mum
Totally relate to Hannah. I am 5'2 and an H and ALL the weight goes to my boobs when I gain. It's insane. And big bras cost a small fortune! So , so frustrating beyond belief.
my biggest insecurity is my stretch marks. like im only 19 and i have them all over the back of my calves, thighs, and hips. they're very dark too. even though ive only gained a bit of weight. i guess my skin is just very prone to them. it makes me not want to wear shorts.
Definitely relate to Hannah on the boob insecurity, I'm not as big as her( for reference I was like a 36E, at the time) but always thought they were bigger then I wanted and had a guy comment they look like two beach balls on your chest.... Beach balls!! I've never been able to think about them positively since
Self acceptance, finding and keeping a balance is a life long struggle. The schizophrenic mind is constantly trying to fit in and be different at the same time. Pressures of social acceptance can be destructive. Finding your own self acceptance within yourself is a fickle, tricky challenge. Brilliant share! Thank you! Cheers!
I have Onychotillomanie, which is heavy nail biting, picking and cutting. I only have half a nail left on my foot because of this, and my fingernails look straight up torn and digesting. It falls under the umbrella of impulse control disorders like Trichotilllomanie (pulling your hair out). Recently it's been classified as a type of OCD swell, which actually helps me cause most therapist don't know how to deal with Onychotillomanie, but they might be able to use some OCD techniques. On top of me feeling shit about then and feeling like it makes me disgusting (it's most certainly nothing anyone would find attractive), random people have addressed me on my nail in public transport. They try to help, they tell me about the bad tasting nail polish or how their niece just stopped after this or that, but I have tried everything that might help on someone who doesn't bite because of OCD. And I don't want to justify and lay open my mental disorders before a random fucking grandma. I will not just stop trying, but it is a thing where therapy (and the right one aswell) is necessary.
I need some advice on being a lesbian. You guys rock
Hey Riyadh, sorry that this won't specifically help you (although there could be a similar reason for men I'm really not sure) but to all the ladies out there who hate that store of fat at the bottom of your tummies, let me tell you something. I hated mine, it's always been there no matter how big or small I've been and I hated it UNTIL I found out one day women naturally store fat there TO PROTECT THE WOMB. When I look at my body as a functioning thing it helps me stop hating it and start appreciating how magnificent it is. Xxx
I have a pacemaker since a month old so there are old scare marks on my left side and recently on my right shoulder. I always try and hide it. Xx
I used to bite my nails. The nasty tasting nail polish didn’t work for me but I decided to wear normal clear nail polish and every time I went to bite my nails, I felt how thick they were and it made me want to keep trying not to bite them. The more I didn’t bite them, the stronger and thicker they got, and now, even if I don’t wear polish I think twice because they feel thicker when I try to bite them
It’s such a common one but I’m so insecure about my weight, I’ve been overweight for my entire teenage hood (maybe even since I was 10/11) and it still bothers me, not as much as it used to but I definitely think it’s held me back , especially when it comes to romantic relationships because on some level I’m like how could someone be attracted to me physically. But like a lot of insecurities, rationally I know that no one would notice or be bothered by it anywhere close to the way I am and it’s something I can change if I want to but that doesn’t make it better when you’re just feeling really low about it. Seeing Hannah put on weight was actually really helpful to me because she is still so gorgeous and I feel like it’s rare to actually see young people put on weight in any noticeable way (in my life anyway).
i have very small boobs (which i don't mind) but i also don't get much from them sexually :/\nmy biggest insecurity is cellulite on my legs and butt, and it keeps me from wearing shorts.
You guys are the best!! Hannah I feel you so much about the boobs, im a 32 G and I swear finding clothes is a nightmare - the majority of high street clothes literally  are for D cup and under!
Thank you both for talking about this! x\nI also have the big boob and short thing (among other stuff, and am about to turn 25!
I thought you said what my birthgiver gave to me in my mum's mouth so I was like wait what @_@
This is so lovely, made me feel better about myself knowing I’m not the only one💜
I have the same insecurity as you Hannah and I totally feel for you and your large breasts! I’ve always been a smaller than average sized person but with larger than average sized breasts and they really grew when I entered college. I also like to dress androgynously so I always hated how my breasts affected my clothing options and like you I often can’t fit into clothes just because of my breasts. I really commend you for talking about your insecurity with Riyadh because it made me feel like I wasn’t alone. I hope to one day get a reduction as well. Also I totally feel you about the horrible back pains!!
I was about to write the thing with your dad and the nose in the comment. There are things on our bodies which are maybe a bit too prominent for our liking or bother us in a different way, but theycan also be things we have inherited from our parents. Therefore they will always be a sign of where we come from and what our history is, that made us who we are now. (Really shitty if you don't have a good relationship with your parents)
His name is Riyadh : Saudi Arabia capital city
Skinny shamed....now it has a name. I'm god damn skinny and everybody feels qualified to tell me that I should eat more, because I'm so skinny aaaand not always feeling great with my body and still having insecurities....
If we are to believe Darwin then everyone alive is best adapted to the environment . It was sad to me to see the change in my daughter when she started reading teen magazines . The fashion , make up , entertainment , snake oil medication industries , etc , rely on pressing buttons in the minds of the insecure to generate huge wealth from people who have little money of their own . Not much morality when it comes to making money .
Is everyone supposed to have insecurities? Cos i can't think of any. I'm going bald, i'm fat and i'm hairy, but simply means i don't need much shampoo, but i have to wear a hat not to get sunburned or cold; i should get back in shape because it's not healthy and i leave hair everywhere and get annoyed by everything that promotes hairlessness. I don't understand why men and women shave, wax and do all kinds of crazy stuff to get rid of body hair. \n\nHonestly, all the insecurities you mentioned, i would never notice, except for Hannah's boobs obviously. \nI'm into small boobs, but i didn't think Hannah's boobs were that big. \nbtw Hannah, i knew a girl that had small boobs and said the same thing you said about not feeling anything, maybe it's not just a size thing.
You guys are amazing, this is the conversation that need started
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE NERVE ENDINGS IN BREASTS but everything makes so much sense now, omg
I have so many insecurities, they make me really upset. It's my weight, stretchmarks on my thighs bum and boobs, my actual boobs, my thighs my hands and my arms. I also have a bump on my head which is a scar and will never go. So yeah
I don't wear 'normal' bras cause I hate the size of my boobs
Another awesome video! Thanks for sharing. Wouldn't even know where to start with my insecurities. Several nose jobs, a chin implant/removal, genioplasty, ear pinning, and scars from the above! I still hate pretty much everything, and hate going out in public. Surgery doesn't always turn out the way one would like, and can end up making you feel even worse than before. I definitely think talking openly is the best way forward. So much pressure to look good these days, and the gay world can also be very difficult unless you look a certain way.
I really want to get my teeth whitened, does anyone know how expensive it is?
I've been a lot less insecure about my body since I had a skin graft after a really bad burn last year. It changed the colour and texture of the skin on my whole left thigh and it doesn't look great, but it's kind of put all the other things I was insecure about into perspective, because now my body will never look perfect anyway it just doesn't feel worth worrying about. And I figure it's character building
I am insecure about my small dick. I hate it and it keeps me away from dating.
I really need to get to the gym I have that flab thing even while standing up
9:14 NOW KISS ME YOU FOOL IM SCREAMING
Riyadh you have the exact same tummy as my boyfriend and it's sooooo cute I love it
50 k views 12 on trending\nYouTube algorithm promoting boring ass channels with no humour at all. That's why lots of funny and edgy youtubers are getting demonitized
See 'How YouTube’s stars are shaming the issues affecting their own fan base' for a look at the opposite to this great video : http://nomajesty.com/youtube-stars-shaming-mental-health-issues/
I've just found you Riyadh and I love this video! Thanks so much for doing it and I'm going to subscribe :)
My biggest insecurity are my Teeth.\nI hate my teeth because they aren't white and shaped correctly, It effects my day to day life because I now cover my mouth when I'm too close to someone talking or if I'm laughing.
I'm insecure about my belly also, I am 23 and am the heaviest I've ever been (fluctuating around the 9 stone mark and am a size 12). I know Im not the biggest person in the world but as someone who as a young child was neglected and severely underweight until I was adopted at the age of 3 where I slowly put on weight (I was still a very skinny child and even through to secondary school where I was a size 8. being negatively impacted that way puts a lot of emphasis on your weight when you realise that you are the biggest you've ever been its quite a lot to take in. Especially when you pair that with the way my stomach is shaped, it literally looks like I'm a couple of months pregnant and no matter what I do it doesn't go away. So from being skinny shamed as a teen to looking like Im 3 months pregnant (and having a couple of comments on it) really gets you down you know? Anyway, this video is fantastic, thank you for this.
Good for you guys! This is such a cool thing to do and share. Owning those parts of us we don't like makes us feel so much better about them. \n\nHow about a video of the parts of your body you LOVE, for balance?!
It's interesting to see that you two are such positive people on YouTube saying to own our bodies and you're here having the confidence to talk about your insecurities. It shows how human you guys are, a lot of the time people don't realise that everyone isn't indestructible especially on YouTube, it shows how real you guys are and it's lovely xx
This is just the worst thing I've ever seen. My insecurities are my balls are too big, this that and the other. Fucking narcissists
Are you 2 for real??? You are what's wrong with the world, snowflakes bitching about fuckall.you ain't making people feel better.i just want to smash your heads together.god dam,some people make me sick.
Had a blast watching this One! Thanks!
Why the fuck is this trending this is a waist of trending space
Its kinda difficult listening to such perfect people talking about them supposedly looking bad when i'm here like help im ugly
Really wonderful video that will impact anyone, as we all have our insecurities. But, I have to say, the comment about being able to look in a mirror and always being able to see your Dad...that was a really beautiful thing to say!
Don't worry everyone has insecurities. Mine is well large LOL. I'm a real heavy-set guy and I was bullied a lot because of it and well I developed a very big insecurity plus it doesn't help much when my doctor says then I'm going to die of diabetes pretty soon just because I'm big. Funny right?
oh i have the nose veins too... i hate it.  my grandfather had them and thought the same thing. Then the doctor tells stop drinking that will help stop progress. like really... so understand your insecurity.
getting it off your chest
I have a condition called Pectus Carinatum, aka pigeon chest, and because of that I always hated my body. I was always skinny - which made my chest even more proeminent. This issue made me never get shirtless in public and even have some back problems as I was constantly trying to hide this proeminent chest. I would just get in a swimming pool wearing a t-shirt and this made be so so uncomfortable. My parents and friends would always ask me things about my body and this only made the situation get worse. I never talked to anyone about this, as in my mind everything was so obvious. In my mind, everyone was starring at me and thinking how weird it looked.  I got to a point that I would refuse going out with my friends because I knew they would go to a swimming pool and they would pressure me to get shirtless. Urgh, awful times.\n\nAs the years passed, I got more mature and stopped worrying so much. I realised that everyone feels insecure about their body, even the ones that we look up to. Besides, my condition is not that bad. My chest is just a little proeminent. However, because I thought about this so much, everything in my mind was so much worse than it actually was. Nowadays, I regret not being myself and skipping so much fun I woud have. I still don't post pictures with my top off, but now I totally accept who I am and I feel it only gets better. :)
Irish boy with perfect muscles, perfect teeth, perfect jawline etc: “I have body insecurities”\nMe without all the above: “Well fuck me, I might as well kill myself”
You two young folks have nothing to worry about. My pal Ben once went out with a girl, who got on top of him as they had sex. When asleep and alone, later that night, he likely had a nightmare that centred on Africa, particularly on vast elephant ears, if you get my meaning. OK, nobody's perfect, but Jesus, I HATE those !
Dear Hannah,\nI have had a breast reduction/breast lift and it CHANGED MY LIFE.\nI went to see this top-notch specialist in Paris and she did an a-ma-zing job. \nI would definitely recommend it! \nXx
Just have to say I love your nose. It’s like my fav feature of your very handsome face.
I didn't knew the boobs thing! Oh dear :O\nI'm like him, i like nipple stimulation <3
Abdullah Khan's human rights have been seriously breached. Please view and share. Thank you.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Abdullah-Khan-has-human-rights-430391800679249/posts_to_page/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU5i5klLQ9o
Ears are apart of your face/head n they're all meant to stick out a little it helps shape your head n face. You look so gorgeous and pretty with your hair slightly back to show your cute ears. Believe it.
you two are cute
Why is he talking like that?
I quit biting my nails by realising what it was doing to my teeth. I read later that if you want to get rid of a habit, you need to replace the habit with something else. I chose to look after my teeth and my nail biting habit(of 20+ years) couldn't exist in symbiosis :)
I completely understand what Hannah said after talking about her teeth . It's okey to change parts of your body if you don't feel good about them, but when you change them because you're pressured by society's beauty standard it just adds to the huge problem we have now a days with companies exploiting insecurities that they create. Loved the video by the way!
Litereally everyone has those roles, that's like saying you're insecure about having feet.
Your nose is great! Never change!
I had the same realisation as Riyadh about my nose too. All my life I hated how big and round it was, but after my granny (Who had an identical nose to me) died I started to appreciate that it was the thing that made me resemble her, and that made me love it. My dad has the same nose too, so it now makes me happier to think that we all share this trait together.
Also, Riyadh's nose is one of the most attractive things about him (in my opinion)!
i love you guys!<3
I have what's known as gynecomastia which is the growth of breast tissue in men, a.k.a. man boobs.  They grew when I was going through my puberty.  I was bullied for having man boobs by multiple people throughout my school days.  I would always wear clothes that wouldn't show them too much in an attempt to hide them and, even though I'm less conscious of them now, at the age of 24 I'm still insecure about them to the point that, for example, going swimming is a no-no.  I've always been a bigger than average guy however I've lost a significant amount of weight this year and they have gotten smaller but they'll always be bigger than that of an average guy unless I get surgery.
THIS VIDEO WAS EVERYTHING!!! LOVED IT
If this guy thinks having short bitten fingernails is a reason to be insecure..he wouldn't dig stretch marks like I've got lol wanna trade?
Great video guys..really fantastic and you guys are gorgeous.\n\nAlso I want to say lets all be careful of what we say to our significant others...some things can be really damaging
I was bullied for my freckles, because they are all along my nose and under my eyes, i used to cover them up when i would go to school, take pictures or just generally go out i didn't feel that they were a problem until someone said something about it, it just shows how people can affect you. You guys are so brave.<3
Kiss Me You Fool IS THIS A LARRY STYLINSON REFERENCE RIYADH?!?!?!?!?!??! HELLL YEEEEEEA BOI
Riyadh's videos make me so so so happy
For me it's the same for my nose cause I don't really like it and I thought of changing it but it's the same of my grandpa and he is not here anymore so it's something that I have of him
This was such a great video :) \nI’m really struggling with my teeth too, I hate how they look and how they look in pictures and I’m recently engaged and panicking about my wedding photos! \nEveryone else has told me that they’re fine and look good but I just cannot get passed it! I’ve been to an orthodontist to get advice and they have offered Invisalign but omg is it expensive! I’m looking to go ahead with it in November but I feel SO GUILTY about spending so much on a cosmetic procedure because I could do so much more with the money. 😭 it feels like such a vain thing.\nHaving a crisis of the mind.
This was amazing. Thank you so much for being open and honest. It’s so refreshing to hear this kind of dialogue. You’re both absolutely beautiful.
Riyadh is such a sweet cinnamon roll.\nlmao at his reaction to Hannah whacking her boobs...
yeah I have a little Rosacea near my nose that I inherited from my dad.. I'm really self conscious about it as well but nobody ever notices it but me..
Honestly Riyadh , you are so stunningly beautiful! I understand the whole find imperfections attractive thing though. I'm the same.  I hate muscles on a guy. Keep up the good work & thanx for your honesty x x

getting it off your chest PUNNY RIYADH
y is gay stuff always promoted, yous r satanic
I love your stomach
ewwwwwwwwwwwww
Get a grip

Ok then
FAGGOT & A BITCH PERFECT LOL
I got no rolls haha
11 on trending !!!
Brill video; love you guys, justvas you are 😘
Hanna your ears are so fucking cute wdym
Hannah's fun bags are gorgeous!
MY FAVES
She is NOT insecure about those boobs as she never stops talking about them and always draws attention to them. For such a source of discomfort she doesn’t half like them looked at by other people. And no, she won’t get a reduction as she would be a lot less interesting without those gifts from god👍
remove the gay dude, and it can be female insecurities. Not Female, and confused male, who doesn't have real male insecurities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first guy to die when the banks go down.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHIftZVfrQ
Riyadh would say anything if he thought there was a BBC documentary in it. He should do a documentary on narcissism and humble bragging. (This guy recently posted a video of him in budgie smugglers slowly running into the ocean. Yeah, thats the sign of someone with serious body issues).
Insecurity: When a 50 year bitch told me I am too short when I was 7...\nInsecurity II: When your bitch 12 years class might bully you look for 12 years\nInsecurity III: When you don't have muscle definition and  a body of a typical Asian (extreme thin)\n\nTherefore, I always feel ugly and disgusting all the time in school. I hate being on the spotlight in front people that i don't want to see. And I injured my knees because I play figure skate as a leisure sport for 13 years and I know when puberty hits me emotionally in the face I won't get tall. Sad fact to know, but there is nothing wrong to be short. Sometimes I ask, do I have to be look a certain way to be reassure the social norm? Nope.\n\nWords of wisdom: Stop fucking bully people because of something that they can't fucking change. You shit people who bullied me.
He reminds me of a fish but i cant remember its name...\n\n\n\n\n\nOh yea, Faggot.
I can’t believe my King Gizzard made it on the trending tab. I wonder how normal people will react to this?\nEdit: Damn! The trend only lasted for a couple hours.
Why the fuck everyone just talked to stu
I imagine the viewcount of this video as 35,000 tiny lizards congregating from all corners of the earth to a singular location where this song is playing and they are hypnotically fixated on it.
Get this on Spotifyyyyyyyyyyy
What kind of castle was it?
This band and oh sees get better every time I hear them. Love tripped out music.
Holy fuck 8:24- 9:00 is perfect, Galea and Stu created a masterpiece
So, Gizzard now is into Macedonian folk music? :D
King Gizzard and the PROG wizard
28 envious people 'cause they're not altered by the beast
please, come to Brazil!
Does anyone have any insight as to how Jason Galea achieves these sorts of visual effects?
Thank you guys so much
Fuck that was brilliant ..... I can listen to it over and over...... to my ears it is the culmination of all the best periods of experimental music from the 60's and 70's made modern.......... all that is missing are vocal harmonies..... that's the next step boys... keep on cracking it..... It's great there's more than a few bands ploughing this field these days which is great... BUT it's sad not many are really listening.....
This video is such a beautiful work of art
These guys could do a gospel album and it would be amazing even.
I don't want to be a crumbling crumbling crumbling arsehole
oh my fucking shit this is SO GOOD
hi there - we too are an aussie 'psych' band with a new video - check it out if you like. shanti <3\nhttps://youtu.be/d7E1LUtk4b4
My room is soaked in foulness from my guts,  a stream of shameful remnants of meals past.  Brown notes came from the internet and my sexual peak reached beyond the reach of my earthly gaze.
I can already see the crowd going crazy  to this song, can't wait to see them live again.
Beautiful.
really cool video\nreally cool song
Ehh... they need to mix up their vocal melodies a little more. This is a retread. The ending is cool though.
are they joking. they're really doing it fuck. aaaaaand 4
Uma banda, uma música e um clipe para as viúvas do Tame Impala largarem o luto e virem  direção à luz.
Fuck me! This band is life
this band is fucking unstoppable
i still can’t get over how amazing this is
🅱 r u m 🅱 l i n g   🅱 a s t l e
Shit, i'm Nonagoninfinitystucked in this!
My boys. Yes thank you.
I fucking love this band.
So many awesome visual ideas stacked together with the music. I can't imagine how long this took. \nOh, and the song itself is epic.
When is the new album coming out?!
Anyone know how he made this video? Looks like a video synthesizer but some of it must be programmed...
King gizzard should play in jersey (UK) as there is no good music here and we need good music
The two months more longer of my life
Awesome boys,  keep up the drugs
Best video of the year so far, this is on another level!
This is next next level. WOW thank u Gizz, y'all rule so much
They were just in Albuquerque I'm so disappointed I couldn't go
it's alright, but I'm not that into it. it lacks that infectiousness that I typically associate with the rhythms of mr. gizzard. hopefully multiple listens will prove me wrong.
That's gotta mean there's another Lp coming out real soon....cool track!
7:33 - 8:00 It's a fig wasp?
Instantly liked this. I like me some calm, meditative songs too.
new song and we sure new album coming soon :) https://goo.gl/WWUhVU
How was the video made?
perfect for a cup of tea and alphago reviewings
This makes my blood lizard temperature and im not getting any warmer!!!!
This amount of talent... These guys just transcended silly mortals
Cavs is getting a solo calling it now
this gives me the big benis
This song was literally designed for people high out of their fucking mind. I watched the entire 10 minutes twice fascinated by it.
Can someone PLEASE tell me how can I do similar visuals to these? I'm totally lost, my guess would be analog editing or some kind of circuit bending editing method but I just don't know
does anyone else hear the billabong valley melody at some points?
Maybe one of my favourite Gizz tracks yet! Stoked for this album
out of the 4/5 albums kg released this year:\n\nPolygonwanaland>Microtonal banana>Murder of the Universe=Sketches
The most psychedelic experience I've ever got from watching a music video. What just happened?! All hail the mighty Gizzard!
How on Earth does someone make visuals this trippy
This is fucking incredible
I see \nLittle bugs\nCrawling in\nYour dirty asshole
Damn, King gizzard goin for that 10:00 ad revenue 😩

This is a pleasant comeback from Murder of the Universe.

I’m so confused
Girl's name? anyone
Some how the fear of the American orge seems still 🎁 maybe it's me.........
nice videos and music
Alright !!!!! its about time :)
Shit! They are back and i have just knew about that lmao
This song fits perfectly with Halloween in the 80’s
best song ive heard from this band
I think this is them reconciling their initial success, and subsequently moving towards making the less pop-friendly music that they really wanted to make, ultimately seeing a dark period in their musical development but taking it in stride to not hide in obscurity but come back strong and with a great new album that is both more conventional and says what they want to say.
This song is fucking great!
I love this song, can't wait for the new album!!
The best song I’ve heard since I was born
intro reminds me of Cherry Hearts by The Shins
the 80s aesthetic is a hit !!
Connan i've a big crush on you
That is Connan Mockasin isn't it?
Ok. I got it. Drugs helps you write.
This 'The Cure' tribute band sucks!
My people have returned 😏
Thank you for being weird.  Thank you for being awesome, and thanks for coming back.
Ben whipping the patio should become a gif
Policemen swear to god\nLove's seeping from the guns\nI know my friends and I\nWould probably turn and run\n\n I enjoy seeing lines like these in songs. Reminds me ahh there are still people who understand and can see through the blindfold.
Living for the early cure aesthetic!!!
It's been so long holy shit
Artists of the dark age
So forced gothic and amazing ❤
How the hell dose he not age
Just glad there's still new music which I can enjoy
I'm hallucinating with this song
Great song, been a fan a longtime. Hope Melon doesnt shit on it and if so meh lol
so dope!!! waiting for the album
Meh not for me maybe the other songs will be
I love the dark, sinister vibe with thriller elements, nice treat for Halloween.
do you like music?\nof course you do!\nvisit my soundcloud to listen to some (hopefully) great music!\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-108304695
It's 80's retro day on youtube. Obviously Cure inspired, with a little Smiths melancholy and Ben looks exactly like Ben Stewart(Eurythmics). I just wish the song had a better hook, and was catchier.
reminds a lot of new order
This video has everything.  Sith Lords blowin' fat vape clouds and David Blaine preforming magic tricks for weird white people.
I fuck with this track so hard.
The music video is so good 😱 ❤️
Also, who's the chick playing with them? Didn't think they had a female, or at least they didn't when I saw them years ago.
the fuck they went?
this is so cool!
would love to see a making of this video
lucy liu s making up with connan mockasin damn

Also, idk if you would be up for including this on your channel but it would be fun to see some cooking videos since you're so into it right now!
Love from Denmark❤️🇩🇰 Your video was really hyggelig
I think its great that you did this video! you should definitely do more books hauls because I'm always looking for new reads! #BookwormsUnite
GIRL! YES! COME TO COPENHAGEN!! You will love it.
Books and candles are my two favorite things!!!!! I got so excited just from seeing the title! Ahhhh yessss!!!!! Thank you for making this video! I’ve missed you! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
If you end up going to Denmark, you should really take the time to visit Aarhus as well as Copenhagen. Both have their own charm :)
glad to know that you're interested in cooking Rendang! it's a traditional from my home country, Indonesia :)
Such a good video idea :) I love your lifestyle content! Also if you're looking for another dreamy plant book, House of Plants by Roco covers a lot of different types of plants in their care section (also the photography is to die for)
It makes me so happy that you´re so into Scandinavia and especially Denmark, because thats where I live. Please visit Copenhagen and if you´re into nature and small cozy islands you/ your family you need to visit Bornholm in Denmark. I love your videos and it makes Me so proud of my small country when youtubers like you, from Britan or USA is inspired to visit. Sorry for my english, im just so happy that you want to visit us at some point. ❤️
Love from Denmark. Do you have a crush on us? 🇩🇰✌️
I'm not vegan or vegetarian but I have also been trying to include more plant based foods in my diet and cut down on my meat, and would recommend The Plantiful Table by Andrea Duclos
I am very interested in the Ready Player One, I'll definitely be checking that book out! :)
Hey Sammi, I'd really recommend L'art de la Simplicité by Dominique Loreau (it's in English!), it's also about decluttering your home, beauty and health. Could you please do a video on your plants? I've also really gotten into plants recently and really want to know what the plant behind you is called!
Ah so much inspiration in this video... adding practically everything to my shopping list!
I love all of these danish mentions (im from denmark!!) AND I just got eat beautiful too!
I saw the Eat Beautiful book in a store the other day and was very disappointed to see so much dairy in it... i mean, dairy is just terrible for your skin. 😓 More like Eat to get pimples.😳
I love that you’re so into Scandinavia/Denmark! Whenever you book a trip to CPH and you need help to what to see/do etc, then pls DM me - I’ve lived there for ten years and while studying I was working at the tourist information! :) I’m Sanneproi on instagram
I love Ready Player One!! Keep doing these hauls I love them :)
If you're into Indian culture, I recommend you read Shantaram :) xx
Hello! I am doing a campaign to collect money, to give books to children who can not buy, so here is the link https://igg.me/at/d2EpHGl7zvQ if you can not donate, share it with your friends and family, this will make the children very happy, the donation is $ 9 dollars onwards, thanks for your collaboration.
Love this video idea!
I love books and candles :)
You should try woodwick candles, they're gorgeous, smell amazing and they crackle while they burn like a real fire! They are unbelievably relaxing!
Yes please more video.
if you come to Denmark, please have a meet & greet :D pretty please! would love to say hi to you guys. you are the cutest ting, the way you explain things is just too much <3 I am quite the same when I explain...but can`t really express it properly into words. I feel like you are also a very humble & grateful person which I love so much in a person. hope to see you in Copenhagen :)
I love how ready, player one takes place in Columbus, OH, USA which is where Im from lol
Yes! I'm so with you on bookshops! Loved the video and can't wait to hear about more books you love!
Bookstores are amazing! We have one by us that I could just spend my life in there!
This video was soooo relaxing and cozy to watch :))
Come to Denmark, we'd love to have you visit us! 😁👌🏻
Now I want to get more books. We're going to have a book case in our living room so might as well. Might purchase some of the ones you have there.
Do you eat a lot of Guyanese food? Would be fun to see you do a cooking video on it 😊 have been watching you for years now (I consider you one of the OG youtubers😂) and I like how you’ve adapted while staying down to earth. Reminds me of the simple times when YouTube wasn’t so much of a money making machine xxx
I desperately want to go to Copenhagen too! PS, your hair looks absolutely stunning! TOTAL BEAUT! xxx
Rendang is delicious! My mom makes the most perfect one
Ready Player One is a book that my husband read and told me that I HAD to read.  I think I love it for the same reason you do.  It really is immersive! This video makes me want to search out a bunch of books to order!
I LOVE this video!!!  What a dream- books and candles.  <3 You are the greatest :)
Love videos like this, Sam! You have some awesome picks there 😊 If you're ever looking for some similar-ish book recommendations, I have a bookstagram that I just started! It's called LevinesReads. Not trying to plug, just trying to share some resources! ❤️
I can lost in a bookshop for hours and not realise the time..
My plants are my therapy... its very grounding taking care of them. I have 2 that are 15years old.. I got them when my Mom died..and just nurturing & watching them grow helped me through grief. I now take cuttings and give them to my friends 😊🌱🌿 x
This was so cute - I really loved this video. I always get more into cooking around this time of year so can't wait to take a peak at some of these cookbooks.
LOVED this video! Beautiful books, yes! Thanks for sharing.♡
OMG Yassss Ready Player One! It really is immersive! I hope they do the film justice. Love ya Sammi xx
Please DO come to Copenhagen - it would be so cool !\nYou should do a family trip in December if you wanna experience some real Hygge and Lykke ;-)
Haha, that is kind of nice to hear someone obsessed about Copenhagen and Scandinavia :) It's easy taking it for granted when you live here. I'm obsessed about London and go every year! 'Lykke' is Happiness :)
This is off topic, but I want bangs now. Also, I read The life changing magic of tidying, but I'm not tidy at all.. I am good at tossing things I don't need, and folding my clothes, but I'm still a clusterfuck. Loved the video!
Can't wait til ready player one comes out in film. Read the book a couple of years ago, loved it.
I really appreciate your love for our little country Denmark! It's very rare that I hear our country being mentioned, so thank you <3 Everytime you buy books or clothes from danish brands (like Gestuz, Ganni ect.) I get so happy and excited! When you are going to Denmark one day, try to visit Aarhus as well! Aarhus is the european capital of culture and the city is absolutely beautiful. \n\nOh and the book you got called Lykke means happiness. It's also my middle name, haha!
I love that we have a very similar taste in books. Half of them i have, the other half is on my wishlist. :)
Please visit Copenhagen! I live here and it's such a nice city!
Cozy video💛 Thank you for sharing, the books are so interesting!
Ur cardigan is awesome .... where did u get it love?
love the books and plants! more videos like this 🙌
ugh god the dog eared pages kill me
love your cookbook haul!! i got so many inspiration from this video, thank you!
Can you do a video about the makeup and hair of this video please?😭❤️
Great video! A video of your style books and cookbooks collection would be 👌🏻
You are actually very good at styling your HOME as well // I always love the pieces you pick out and how you put a room together!
For plants, check out “What’s Wrong with my House Plant” by David Deardorff and Kathryn Wadsworth
I really enjoyed this video! I love books & candles. Especially cookbooks & home decor, plants etc. I recently found a great cookbook. ( 'Oh she glows every day' By Angela Liddon. You would love this book. Thanks for sharing. 🥑
Don't wanna be a party pooper but the last two candle brands are ridiculously expensive for a scent that can be duplicated by any other brand. It's like Tom Ford lipsticks; the aesthetic of the brand is lovely but it's not like you're buying a couch, it's something that will run out soon... I personally love my ZARA Home and H&M Home candles (some secret ones that only exist in-store are the best ones!) as well as any other random brand!!! Truth be told I'm very picky and stingy when it comes to candles lol
Glad to know I'm not the only one obsessed with candles 😊
I was just as obsessed as you are and I learned a little bit of danish during 4 years of fandom, and then i got to live there for a year. I'm an expert, ask me anything. hahah PLEASE GO
What’s time secret to have a healthy relationship? Like my boyfriend and I have don’t together for a year and 8 months... and there are times I feel fuckin frustrated when I tell my point across. I do understand where he’s coming from.. but I’m trying to get my point across without sounding like a bitch... and how can we make time for each other? Btw I love your videos!! ❤️
The Urban Jungle book sounds and looks amazing Sammi. I need to get it asap lol!
I love this idea!! Two of my favourite things
Ready Player One was SO GOOD! If you like it then I have a few recommendations!\n Anything that Neil Gaiman has written is great, Neverwhere Anansi Boys and American Gods are 3 of my favorites.\nCarry On by Rainbow Rowell is a spin on Harry Potter and it is GREAT!\nAnd then on the power women note Roxanne Gay has a couple out that are very good Bad Feminist and Difficult Women are faves. Shrill- Notes from a Loud Woman by Lindy West was funny and enjoyable and anything Chimamanda Adichie writes is gold. \n\nThat was a lot but I love audio books, I challenged myself to finish 50 books this year, currently on number 35 so I have a lot of suggestions lol. This was a great video! I love your fashion content but this was a lovely switch up.
Love going into bookstores. Currently reading Child 44- Tom Rob Smith (crime/thriller, set in Russia during and post Stalin's regime), easy to read, fast pace flow and gripping storyline. What I would say about this book is that the main crimes that are told through the story can be upsetting for some. \n\nI've read the book The life changing magic of tidying and the way she spoke about objects as if they had their own life and purpose like a little human, how all the items should be treated with respect with each use and to be placed back correctly.
Hi Sam.. can you do a what i eat in a day video.. would love to see what u've been eating lately from those interesting cook books
Books and candles are my obsession! Too bad you didn't have more psychological thriller buys I need some new recommendations! 😊
i just came to listen to your voice lol, loooove your accent!! that kondo book is a life saver!!
your videos have been FANTASTIC lately :)
Absolutely loved this! I am reading Greatest Hits by Laura Barnett and loving it, her first book is wonderful too! xxx
I love it. Please make more videos like this. # bookworms United.
Please come to Copenhagen! I live in Denmark and looveeeeee you. I have followed you for years and years and i would be so cool to see you visit the country where I am from!
I love this video. One can clearly see that you enjoyed filming it.\n\nThank you 🤗
I feel the same way about bookstores. I can honestly roam around a bookstore for hours, even if I don't buy a book. Being surrounded by books is the best feeling!
There's going to be a ready player one movie next year BTW!! Let us know how the book is! Also any interest in doing a book club?
Feeling different when not eating meat isn't strange at all Sam :) i felt such an huge difference in my health and daily well being, that i would never believe it if didn't experienced it myself.\n\nDo your own research if you are interested and if you need some help with that just say... It can change your and your family well being sooooo much.\nLots of love
I've had Fresh India by Meera Sodha for a while now and the food is incredible. A lot of the recipes use the same ingredients over and over again so it gradually becomes quite cheap food to make after your first bulk buy. I would 100% recommend to anyone who is thinking of getting it! \n\nAlso, whilst I'm here - does anyone have any other amazing vegetarian cookbooks they'd recommend?
I'm an English teacher so loveeee that you are representing the book worms!👐
If you go to copenhagen (which you really should! It is a truly lovley place), you should also pop into Malmö in Sweden over the day! The train over only takes 30 minutes and it's a real gem! 👌🏼
Hi Samantha, books recommendations: Life lessons, by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross and David Kessler (great book!!), A mother's reckoning https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mothers-Reckoning-aftermath-Columbine-tragedy/dp/0753556812/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1508613647&sr=8-1&keywords=sue+klebold, The Gut by Giulia Enders, 'It's All in Your Head: Stories from the Frontline of Psychosomatic Illness', by Suzanne O'Suliivan, this one I haven't read yet but it sounds good.
Loved watching this video. Books and candles was a great idea! Thanks for sharing 🙏🏽
Yes love candles and books thanks Sammi
Loved this video
🖤🖤🖤🖤
The autumnal vibes 😊
❤️📚 and candles!\nThanks for sharing:)
Omg YES! Please come to Copenhagen!❤
Cooking video please! Love bookstores:)
PF. Candle Co is the besttttttttt soy candles! Teakwood & Tobacco aaf <3
This was lovely ❤️
Love the hair. Love the lipstick. Love the cardigan. Love the background. 😍😍
Love from Copenhagen ❤️❤️
You reeeeally need to stop buying paper books! They're so bad for the environment. Especially because you have a Kindle already...
sammy please address why you're not going vegan. i've loved you for years but i really don't understand this - i feel like even if you just took the time to explain why you're not doing it would be a big improvement that just avoiding the elephant in the room. please don't take this as hate - i love you and that's why i've been thinking so much about this!
Love books too. Hair looks great today!
the way she pronounces hygge 😂
If you are in love with Denmark, you really have to read The Little Book of Hygge, by Meik Wiking. You will want to move country straight away! :)
You were right the first time! Eau is pronounced oh not ooh :)
I like how they had cameras there to capture it.

Why am I here?
Can imagine someone putting minecraft music over this
the alien ship I went on had stuff like this to keep humans entertained.
Why isn't this my screensaver??
I wonder if it sprouted out a sperm and an egg to form an animal that will soon evolve into a humanlike species??
Slow the settings down to 0.5 or 0.25 looks cool !
Is space related to science?
I'll take your word for it.
What's this music?
Some stars burn out and die, bigger stars burn out and die with *passion*
Disney animate too...what's the point?
So if I spin two round balls and when they collide, earth will be destroyed under the sheer impact?
And why is this trending?

I wonder if god farted or burped and it made this happen
If we where gonna die the burst would have been toward us , we wouldn't have been able to see the stripes
Who thought this was about that strange orange glow in england a couple days ago
since the two black holes last year, lost a significant amount of mass, due to producing so huge an amount of gravity wave distortion universe wide. several solar masses of energy was lost. the question, and I may have to figure it out myself, is, how much mass, over this length of time, 200 miles wide, was lost here. this would reduce the equation of state, because the end result may be much less than the 2.1 solar mass neutron star already seen.
Would those colours actually be there if this event happened in real life?
Watch this while listening to Neutron Star Collision by Muse
The aliens are coming!!
Lol all the simpletons saying the earth is flat XD
And that's how babies are made.
This is the magic of reality
Just pretend we knew what this meant and didn’t just think look at all the pretty colours
What dose the mean anyone?
well that's hot

NASA is my space station
Have we entered a new era? An era of light and gravitational waves... An era of neutrons stars. Something we can now see that we couldn't detect before
I recall Brian Cox  theorising that the energy produced from this collision will scorch the earth, and that’s how the world will end
Why are people so excited over this speculative simulation. Relax it is not real.
Just another nuclear bomb testing in north korea...
The earth is rectangle.
Is maths related to science?
I don't believe gravitation waves travel at the speed of light... If they did the entire mass of the universe would be in constant collapse right after the big bang but studies prove this isn't the case...
I saw this live, was crazy.
It’s pretty cool we got a talk from the people who detected it a week before
Is there a name for the song?\n\nIf so What is it?

Knuckle Puck has the best videos 🤘

Looks like a lit ass time

Did Richie let you use his kidapult?
You guys didn't even feature Echo and Ivy.
This video made me so fucking hungry
That looks like a dank birthday party
I want the same FUCKIN  birthday's Gift ( i live in France, i'll pay you the famous jambon beurre with chateauneuf du pape as wine)

So cool!!!
eskettit
One word. LIT!
best birthday ever!! awesome footage
happy birthday
I'm in love with this band <3
This makes me so incredibly happy I for real can't stop smiling
This is awesome!
Still found Copacetic to be an all around way better album. Even the strongest song (Double Helix IMO) doesn't beat out the weakest song off Copacetic.
I wish my parents would buy me Knuckle Puck for a night :(
Knucle Puck demuestra que el pop punk nunca murió ni morirá jamás!
Yes akhrnya rilis juga vc nya ,ayo donk ke indonesia ,pasti banyak yg suka band pop punk
yes!! pickle rick is my favorite pop punk band!!!
Bet there wasn't a single pit
I like the song but this is way too hipster for me.  Just seems like they are making fun of Middle America.  Doesn't fit the song at all.
could never get into this band... pop-punk is not for me!!
I miss Rise old band like SWS, Secrets, and Emarosa. Rise used to be big on Posthc scene. Now they put whatever sells the most like PVRIS
Knuckle Puck is an American pop punk band from the south suburbs of Chicago. Gone AWESOME SONG/VIDEO!!!😉😃😎😆🤔

Missing you Lily! ☹️
Lily looks so cheerful 😀
Missing Lilly!!!! 😏
LILYYY!
loved seeing lily!
loveee you two together!
That was great! I always really loved seeing Lily...I’ve missed her, and I can’t wait for her return.
Where’s Lili’s coat from?
I really like this type of video, Anna. Do more of this! 😊
We slept like logs, except for the time that I woke up and I thought I was in a sauna. lmaooooo
So great to see the two of you together, you make me smile and laugh out loud. You give off such positive energy. I have missed watching your channel Lily, have a great break
Please please please do a review on The Ordinary Foundation !! I'm so intrigued and ready to buy but want to know how the colour matches up as I'm buying online !! Loved the video, miss you Lily xx
I felt like I was on holiday too! ...from the comfort of my couch while I procrastinate from writing a paper for UNI. Lovely vlog though, couple and friends time super sweet and v relatable. Nice to see parts of London too. Lily seems/looks light and happy, she should take all the time off she needs to refresh/reset, her fans aren't going anywhere :) xx
Miss you Lily!!! Great video Anna : ) x
Loved this - makes me miss London!
Lovely to see Lily's face xx
Definitely go see Lily and Rich more! So nice to see you all together.
I moved from South London to Cornwall 5 weeks ago and the noise of Southern Rail trains has brought back so many memories, both good and bad ahahah!!  Loved this vlog xx
Check out Ryan Forrest Composer for epic piano music!\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXVKc5zLjE\n*this guy's so underrated!*
how I wish I live in London
Squatting when you wear jeans is actually a great idea tho
Great vlog! Missing you lily but it looks like you're having a well needed rest! Love the fact you were doing a mini haul in this haha!
China Town!!!  😆 I miss the food there
You guys seem so happy, im really happy for lily if she feels a break is helping her, i think you guys are so great together
lovely to see lily! your double dates are always fun to watch xx
Yai!! Anna & lily. Love these vlogs. I missed lily so happy to see her. Love you Anna.
Your friendship is a lovely thing in a world full of not lovely things.
Hi Lily, uhmmm can you come back to YouTube now?!? LOL
Ooh I read about the Gingerline only a few weeks ago as I’m heading to London soon.  It looks great but sadly it’s only for over 18s and I’ll have my 16 yr old daughter on this trip.  I love This Works extreme moisturiser for winter.  I find that brand really good but it doesn’t get too much interest here in Australia. Their pillow spray really does seem to work.
Don't speak. wow. one of my favourite songs.
Lovely vlog- the two couples together is always a good time! Nice to see Lily! I want to try that foundation also!!
I could watch your vlogs all day!
Around 3.50 I paused the video as my 12 year old walked in and asked me something.  When I got to hit play again, all we could hear was when he farts!  My daughter was cracking up!  The best breaks are the ones that feel like you've been away for ages and like you've been on holiday!
y'all are cute.  looks so fun!
I loved this! I missed Lily, I missed the couple vlogs, I missed the London weekend activities. This filled so many voids I didn't know I had!! xx
Wish The Ordinary would launch here
Ahhhh I miss Lily! This was a nice vlog, you all are so funny together! It’s a shame you don’t get on very well 😂
Looks like you guys had a fun weekend! Just adore you two! So funny, boys are shopping and you two are tagging along... Love it!
You are such a joy!
So glad to see you two together and Lily looking so happy ❤️ can’t wait for her to come back!
Lily seems so happy - happier than she has in a very long time. The break is obviously doing her a lot of good x
i want lily's coat  , great vlog xx
Half watching this just to get a lily fix  🙈 obviously so much love for anna too ❤️
did viewers really think Lily was preggers... never crossed my mind.  but i knew she wouldn't be away too long from youtube...  i saw someone w Lily's coat the other day :)
Great vlog, looks like you had fun!! x
Always lush to c u hanging out together guys♥️♥️♥️♥️

Totally loved this vlog ❤ So nice to get some tips for our next trip to London 😃
Thanks for taking us along, Anna! It was lovely :-)

How lovely to see Lily. The time off is suiting her, looking happy and relaxed. Come back soon!
Love when you four hang out together (even though it doesn't affect me at all lol)
Lilyyyyyy i miss youuuuuuu it madré me so happy to see your precious face
I miss Lily so much :( Great video as always xxx
Great to see Lily again. She really looks like she is enjoying her little screen break.
This vlog is so amazing! Love it so much 💕
This is exactly why I LOVE being on YouTube - the friendships you can make xx
I miss Lily so so much! It's taken up til now to realise why YouTube isn't the same, and its cause my sub box is lily'less *cries* But she is SO happy, can see it in her face, happiest she has looked in a long time, so if this is what she needed then fab! I just hope she isn't gonna come back unless she actually wants to!
Loved this mini vlog! I really want to stay at The Hoxton , looks so cool. I must buy that foundation at some point. 💪🏻
Aw its so nice to see Lily again, definitely missing her videos! xxx
Can’t wait for a review of the ordinary foundations!!
Using my the ordinary foundation while watching this....
I rarely (if ever) comment on videos, but this was so lovely I can't resist! I love how relaxed and authentic this vlog feels, a pleasure to watch. xx
I miss Lily so much!
What is this bs
OMG!! NO2 ON TRENDING! 😱 you go girls! 💪 Missed seeing both of you in a vlog 💓
Could you do a review of the ordinary foundations you purchased? Quite curious. Love the vlog!!
So nice to see Lily again 😉 Great vlog!
This was the perfect little vlog to watch on my lunch break! Was lovely to see Lily happy too.
Lovely vlog Anna! And so nice to get a glimpse of Lily again. You are more then welcome back to youtube/internet when/if you feel ready for it @lilypebbles ❤
I stayed at the Hoxton in London and it was awesome! The lobby is like a collaborate workspace in the day and a nightclub at night! It was crazy. They also give free breakfast every morning
Not only do we get Mark, but Lily and Rich! 💙💚💛💜
Your handsome husband, irons!!! Love him, even more!! I always look forward to when you and Lillie do a video together!!
Paused the video to comment and say HOW MUCH DO WE MISS Lily??!!! But also let’s note how happy and refreshed she looks. Take however long you need Lily but come back to us soonish... thanks for this great video Anna. I smiled thorough out the entire vlog!
Absolutely love this video! Do they sell all of the 'The Ordinary' skin care range at the deciem store? I really want to try it out, but I am not the biggest fan of shopping skin care online. \nx \nOne happy subscriber
Why are you trending ?
Mark looks like thom yorke!?
hoes
Pls pls follow Kris Aquino!! Her youtube chanel is  @Theaquinos, shes very famous  celebrity in the philippines and she likes and watches your videos!! She acknowledged you in one of her videos. Thanks :)
How does bullshit like this kind of vlog even begin to trend ?
How the fuck is this #2 trending?
I don't understand why youtubers all buy the same clothes as each other. A minute ago they were all spending £500 on gucci loafers so they could look the same and now apparently tartan jackets are the thing. And for some reason English people seem to keep calling that pattern check or plaid. It's so uninspiring when everyone is buying the same clothes and no one seems to have their own style.
who the fuck is screaming? why the fuck?
Ah, white trash at its best...
I guess a lot of people like attempted homicide. This video is scary.
looks like they build cars out of trash and try to race it... am i wrong ?
How about boxers racing cars? Anthony Joshua races Deontay Wilder in the Indy 500! And then they can fight at the end with Jimmy Kinmel as special referee.
If this was hockey the show would of stopped for a fight !  Inmates racing  cars is always gonna b a taze fest when shit goes down.
This is Trump's America.
Who the eff is that girl screaming like seriously calm down nobody died.
What will ferrell movie is this clip from again?
Hahaha he tasered him with gas and oil leaking everywhere. This could have become a much bigger story.
Prooobably didn't need to smash into his car. Probably.
What the guy in the black car did was pretty much vehicular assault, perhaps attempted murder. The man who got shot with the stun gun and handcuffed had full right to be upset at the driver of the black car for potentially having killed him.
One of the best fights ever as u don't see any fucking great keeping it pg
what in the bucknekked hee haw tarnation is going on here???
Lol if nascar was more like this than it would be much more exciting
This is what happens when you pay people a bunch of money to win games
If it was NASCAR he will be dead   That guy is so fat he need 2 hand cuff
Lmao! Probably the funnest part of the night.
*This video's the perfect example of why Formula 1 Racing is for idiots!*
the other driver got cuffed to 4:53
stupid motorsports made in US
Hey cops, do this the next time Antifa or Black Lives Matter members open their mouths.
Idiot screaming female in the background was very annoying.
F'n tards, both of them.
The fighting is more entertaining than the race.
Why is everyone so pissy?? This was hilarious! 😂
So why don't the Arrest NASCAR Drivers when they do this?
20 years ago they would have just separated them. That driver definitely deserved an ass beating.
Wow! This is crazy is that who we are now, instead of giving them a hand we throw a punch, this isn't funny at all. God please help us, we need Jesus in our life.
He took his job!
Soo only baseball, basketball, and football players can fight on the field with no repercussions. I'd like to see that happen on a NFL field.
What the hell was that dumbass in the black car trying to do. Deserved to get his ass beat
I'm ashamed of my country
Both drivers should be arrested and the driver in the car that ran over 33 banned from racing.
Why are people screaming like crazy in the audience wtf... stop it...
I'm surprised the cop didn't kill em.
im impressed the black car was able to drive up onto the other one 10/10 would watch again
Well, they did sign up to put on a show.
I think car 33 is going to need an oil change.
Basketball: pretend to get tripped and ref lets you win game\nRacecars: Smash someone elses car and they get tased and arrested\nHmmmmmmmm
Lmao fucking rednecks. Ricky Bobby and his buddy are at it again. Shakin and bakin baby
Y'all wild this is lit!! 😂
So the dude almost died from that guy almost Crushing him with the car, so obviously the guy was gonna kick his ass
At the dirt track this happens everytime
Well. Nice to know there’s unprofessional asshats throughout society I guess
you know that CSI reverse camera angle bullshit? - how do we use it here? LoL!
These same people yell and scream that other races are violent.
Guide Lamp has been gone for years, but the cheering trash remains. Wonder if they keep The Lamplighter in business.
Rednecks watching other rednecks destroying each other's property and beating the shit out of each other. Only thing missing is someone fucking their cousin in a corner and we'd have the perfect Redneck paradise.
Well done Law Enforcement officer. Let's hope this criminal doesn't have access to Children.
top tip drivers don't take your helmet off when you fight
typical fat guy tough when the guys stuck in the car, you WANKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
American Motorsport is shit. The USA F1 GP is on this weekend :/
anyone remember the nascar south park episode?
Yep, the stupid mericans just watching how someone kills another human being.... Everyday same shitty story! Fooking retards, instead of separating them they are watching...
if you're still wondering how trump won after watching this, there is no help for you.....
thats the most american video ever lol
You’d be hard pressed to find one person there with an IQ over 90
look at all the acceptable racism going on in this comment section.
what is this, Nascar for rednecks?
The policeman should be arrested for trespassing on the track
Were they related? I bet they were related. Or they they share the same cousin.........If you know what I mean!
If fat boy weighed a bit less his car would have gone faster
How much do you want to bet they voted 'Trump'?
Anderson..
These guys are disrespectin' 'Merica!!!
Well that escalated quickly....;)
‘Murica
Muriccaaaa
Stupid rednecks....
Trailer park spawn.

They were both hammered.
1:22
Dumb
Don't tase me bro
酷
Stupid Show
He deserved a beating
mad max
Typical Trump supporter
This is so fucking cringe
Great camera angle 😊😑
Mario Karts gone wild
idiots being idiots.

Low iq 'murikkkans
1:20
Sounds like a fucking monkey enclosure.
Can somebody please taze the screaming chick?
ustawka 33
Great entertainment :D
This is fake....
Scumbags
Too much ignorance or stupidity in many of the comments! The driver was NOT almost killed! These race cars are built with several roll cages & cages around the engine. They're built safer than anything driven on a public roadway! The driver of the black car drove over the hood...that has a cage around the motor. Other than ripping the guys carb off & damaging the sheet metal & left wheel, he didn't threaten the other guy's life at all. If he'd drove into the driver door...still protected by a cage, it may be another story, but NONE of that happened. \nHillbilly comments...wow! People making these silly comments apparently have never taken a drink of alcohol in their life! A quick history lesson for you... Moonshiners & bootleggers had fast cars to transport their liquor & get away from the police. They would race each other to see who had the fastest cars. Hence, the birth of NASCAR. When the cars were wrecked, they'd use them in demolition derbies to destroy the cars. The birth of another sport. \nIt's sad that people who don't have a clue about many things in life, feel the need to show just how ignorant they are by making idiotic comments. STUPID is why the world is in the shape it's in right now!
I can't decide who the bigger pussies are; the cop who waddles in and goes straight for the taser, or the six guys standing there waiting for a lone cop to break it up.\n\nJesus Christ, just pull him off. They're redneck wannabe race car drivers,  not X-Men.
Most exciting thing to happen to this sport since Ricky Bobby....
Adam check if the machine *runs*\nThe machine has snow *blades*\nAdam = *Blade Runner*
cross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now
2:14 That laugh 😀
Adam: Visits Blade Runner set\nTalks half of the time about a sci-fi snow plow
Do androids dream of electric geeks?
GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW PEOPLE!!!! It's that fucking mind blowing and game changing!!!!
Adam, your enthusiasm makes my eyes tear up. Honestly, I rarely feel that way, but when I see how genuinely enthusiastic and happy you are about everything you do, I get choked up and cry tears of joy. You are an amazing person. Thank you.
How awesome is it that we get another Blade Runner movie? Not a remake but a sequel!
They should have released all the BHTS stuff a month ago.
Blade Runner 2049 was a fantastic film, probably my new favorite movie up to this point. Though it makes me sad that relatively few people have the patience to appreciate it.
Blade Runner 2049, one of the only US movies in recent memory where they don't use the default available typeface for foreign languages.
if this all isnt for in the movie what it it for?
hey adam, are you a white male? reee! what happened to you? I guess somebody started whispering in your ear. hope you get help.
I was pushing the refresh button 2 weeks till this video appeared
So awesome. Such a great movie too
Really cool. I'm going to see it next week. Can't wait!\nI'm going to be able to say cool, Adam drove that thing!.\nThanks for making me laugh yet again, you're great Adam!!!
All I want to see now is the memory maker's controller.
Adam Savage's Tour of a Street Sweeper from Blade Runner 2049
i'm going to go watch the new blade runner movie and in the background see Adam walking around with a camera man just looking at stuff 😂
Half video for a vehicle, I would have liked to see other stuff as well ...
I didn't see these scenes in the movie
reminds me of the amount of detail Weta put in to LoTR. Kudos.
Well, if they need to make it match many of the outdoor scenes in the new movie, be sure to digitally colour correct the the crap out of it until all those meticulous details turn to monotone background mush.
now all us blade runner fans can spend the next 30 plus years re watching this and always find something new with each viewing . now that`s movie magic !
I want to see a video in which Adam Savage is depressed and smashes everything up in futile despair.
I love the way that Adam is almost like a little kid in a sweet shop when it comes to anything like this- sets, props, costumes; he gets giddy and super excited over the tiniest of things! :D I'm vicariously living out my geekyness through Adam :P
I love the ambience so much in this movie
Is that Ben Kingsley over Adam's left shoulder in the opening shot?
background music sounds ALOT like ghost in the shell original score!
after the vid he was told that snowplow was just a regular hungary mining truck
@5:42, I guess Smirnoff is still a thing in 2049 😂 Not sure how I caught that one lol
first counterpart maximum communicate olympic fade boss practical.
I wish they had released a bunch more promo like this leading up so more people would have seen this true work of art.
Is it bad that I want to live there?
Like a kid in a candy store.
0:16 okay but can we talk about this man's swag? Mr. Savage is fresh af
Amazing! That level detail done in 2.5 days.
When people think of Cyberpunk...Blade Runner is one of the first movies that people think of. Also I would really to to see that street sweeper/snow plow Adam drove on the roads for real..legit that thing would be fun to see doing work and I'm pretty sure the spinning blade is for large chunks of semi frozen snow.
Saw 2049 in IMAX yesterday, and wow it was great!!!
You lucky son of a gun!
Would that happen to be the same quarry the scene from expendables is filmed in?
I'd love to see interviews with the set decorators, explaining all those little details we glimpsed in this video.
Ugh payday is on Friday can't see it till this weekend.
What is that cool music called 5:10?
The Original Blade Runner Kinda Sucked. How Will The New One Fair Any Better?
I have purposefully suspended my disbelief so I can geek out with Adam. Too fun!
What's the name of the prequel he talked about on his podcast?? I've looked but to no avail!!
Adam's behind the scenes coverage of alien and bladerunner has been the sole reason why i want to see those films, i love it!
This is the set of the short with Bautista.
fuck it's cool
Damn Adam is lucky litle bit of hard work  to get his fantasy real
isnt that the same quarry that they used in hellboy 2
When you said, set dressed in two days, I pooped my pants.\n\nThen I realised that fabrication happened beforehand. I felt better.
I love how no matter how much in-person bts Adam has seen through the years, he still nerds out like every one of us would. Never change Adam
I want to see Adam try the Spinner.
Adam Savage. Youre the man sir
I've been to that rave
I would love to drive one of the street sweepers
They should have Adam in every SciFi movie set. It would make for awesome content and I'm sure he wouldn't mind
He has to be jumping out of his skin being there.  Everything is state of the art which he knows intimately and the crew are top level.  How does he hide his nerd boner?
This whole set looks like a german post apocalyptic Larp. :D
Thank you very much for bringing us with you on the set of what seems to be my new favorite movie. I'll have to go see it again just to make sure :)
Will it be ready in 2049 too?
Yeah, the cryptic opening doesn't work in youtube where you have to put Set Tour of the Blade Runner Universe in the title of your video.
The blade runner franchise, -especially 2049- has some amazing set design. The people who make the props and character designs really know what they're doing and have a very specific vision.
lucky little fart !!!! I'm so Jelly !!!  -_-
01:33 I use to have those exact same *orange swivel cassette tape holders* .....coooool
Love this stuff. Love this channel. :)  Unique high quality content, plus they also cover he exact mix of topics that i like. Also really nice to see Adam freak/geek out over cool stuff. :D ^^
I'd love to be an extra in one of these films, just to wear costume and walk around in the settings
Your are the coolest guy ever! Awesome child-like enthusiasm! Just like me! I love these sets!
It's sad when a Transformer or Resident Evil movie blows away Blade Runner at the box office.
You know, that's an interesting comment Adam made about the increase in resolution of modern films and modern digital projectors (not to mention BluRay on your TV at home). Some 20-odd years ago, I did the Universal Studios tour in southern California. The tram took us through a set that was being actively shot for some movie at the time, and we noted how it looked completely trashed and destroyed - it was just a street scene; some back alley. The guide told us that the set decorators HAD to exaggerate the filth, because once it made it onto the screen, between the lighting methods and the lower resolution of actual film, it would appear normal to viewers. If they dressed it normally as we'd see in real life, on film it would appear unrealistically pristine. Now, things have completely reversed.
I had no idea so much production was put into the 2048 short film.Sometimes behind the scenes takes away from a film.This definitely adds to it.
Man that's what I would call the realm of the Savage Nation?
Your editor hung a frame at 6:02 and change.
Awesome. Adam has become one of my biggest heroes.
Stepping where Ryan Gosling stepped? Jealous.
auto rickshaw in Hindi
5:32 LOL Edda kazetta :D :D
Yes please
Too bad the movie flopped
I came kipple.
2:46 I maed dis :D
love this video
you want eyeballs... <3 <3 <3
2:14 Evil laugh.  😈
BLADE RUNNER Full HD : https://plus.google.com/+ThoeWilcentMovie/posts/Pw8qnHSsJ7D
So the sequence they were shooting, what was it for?
Wait... who’s idea was it to have a snow plow in Los Angeles? That’d be like having air conditioning at the South Pole
My reaction during the opening scene of Blade Runner 2049 @2:12
The movie was bad, face it. The koolaide is real...
shame that the movie sucked though.
This movie was given way too much money. They gave Ridley very little money to do the first one and it turned out well. Its not about the money. Yet the sequel cost $150m + god knows how much for marketing. For a niche sci fi movie thats insane. But because it fit Hollywood's anti capitalist narrative the money spiggots were set to kill.
So so cool......I'm a professional Graffiti artist based in the Uk and Ive just spent the day painting the wall and front of a flat boring bar in a nightclub  to look like riveted sheet iron that's all dirty,rusted and dented ..I work freehand with spraypaint and I know for a fact I could do this type of thing on movie sets ..I'd love to paint a vehicle or something for something as timeless as a Bladerunner movie.....Any production / Set designers out there ? Give me a shout.... Insta- @Hull_Graffiti  -  Si2ttk@Gmail.com  -  fb/Nick Horsfiled
So what are they filming here? A short film? Like the anime one but live action? Or a commercial? If anyone knows let me know 👌🏼
It's entirely possible this is not as much a fictional vehicle and it's not all that fictional dirt. Maybe they just told Adam so that he's happy...? \n\n(I live next to Hungary, i know they are capable to pull that stunt)
who gives a shit? this is just for the promotional short. it may as well be a fan production, hardly even official.
This movie is a disappointment compared to the old Blade Runner.
Sorry Adam, this movie sucked.  Like a fan film that did not understand the important things of Blade Runner.
blade runner 2049 = garbage just admit it already, stop pretending.
I never seen Karen before but ...hmmm..whoa....ok....
I want to jerk off now🐶🐶🐶🐶
I agree with Donna Karen. The way women dress these days, they're practically asking for you to break into their room, pull down your pants, and start masturbating furiously in front of them. I mean, when I go to the supermarket and see a hot woman shopping, the first thing I think is that woman is just asking for me to masturbate into a potted plant in front of her. See, Donna's smart. She knows that according to her logic, if she just looks ugly, she's never going to have these problems. Genius.
Donna Karen is one scary looking disgusting person
Condescending, morally bankrupt progressive hypocrites like Oliver call  decent people stupid, nazi, or white supremicist... then try to take the high ground?  Your days of influence are waning...
What does liberal hollywood and the republican party have in common?  Perverted sexual appetites.
I'm shocked the liberal cuck john oliver said anything bad about harvey,  he should have defended him by calling everybody against harvey a nazi, saying he was born that way.
Only broke the news to get the focus off of Las Vegas.
You know Weinstein has been disavowed by the elite when their tool of the state, Oliver, was given the blessing to attack him.
What's more appauling is that everyone is up in arms about this guy but half the country thinks it's perfectly ok to act like this towards women and be president of the United States.
Screw them all they all still took the money and stayed quiet they are all complicit. What i wanna hear is about the pedo sex rings not the willing whores
The gay mafia controls late night comedy
I'm more concerned about the children's casting couch. Women are grown adults capable of making their own decisions. If someone/anyone makes an unwanted advance, ladies, say no. Let's not be misdirected from the rampant pedophilia in Hollywood, much of it homosexual.
What happened to innocent until proven guilty?
donna is right
Holy fuck!!!! That Donna Karan he/she scared the shit out of me. God damn it!!! She is one hideous fucking thing.
The same bastard you guys were praising! Now look at your backs turn as he gets caught. We know YOURE ALL LIKE HARVEY
I would clock Oliver so hard id send him back to mock the week
Donna was asking for it!
Donna Karan is the ugliest female  ever !!!
Damn, that bitch who was talking is both very ugly and very stupid
Anyone notice the doug dimmadome owner of the dimsdale dimmadome hat was stolen?
Hillary got Obama daughter an intern job for Weinstein. She knew intern means sex slave to Her men.
This is what democrats do.  They lie and cover.  Harvey learned from Obama and Hilary and vice versa.
I can't believe they are treating this guy with kid gloves. He absolutely needs to be in prison. He has been terrorizing women for 30 years at least. We can't let this slid by....He is everything that should be in prison THIS is exactly the type we need to save space for in prison not the guy who doesn't prey on, manipulate, embarrass, bully, coerce, be crude to, degrade, extort, threaten, retaliate against, trap them in place they want to leave or felt uncomfortable being, abduct, physically restrain or blocked doorways/ take keys, cause terror, fear and panic \n, touched inappropriately, assaulted by physical fight, assaulted sexually, raped, begged enough or promised enough so she gave in finally.... especially when a man or any person is in an important position of power it makes it even more sicker. This is disgustingly sad AND UNACCEPTABLE.
Though Hollywood was pro woman's rights. Only against Republicans I guess.
I always do my very best to treat women with respect, kindness and compassion. I know that while both genders are capable of mistreating others, in this case, the heart of the problem is the men. The best way to work towards solving a social issue is to raise young men up to value others and be respectable in the way they conduct themselves. Encourage a culture of excellence among men. Women also have a responsibility to behave honorably and with modesty, but in general, as with sexual harassment, the solution starts with the men.
It's Hollywood ..... this asshole tried to blame the Right for rape culture ...... hmmmmmm no wonder California wants to be their own country ...
This is hillarys man though. I thought u liberals would cut him a break
Only men are surprised by the pervasivess of this, and how others are reacting. I didnt see any woman be actually surprised by the fact this happens.
It's Hollywood. Sexual misconduct is implicit. We're talking about the most corrupt human beings who have ever walked the earth.
wow, the woman behind her...tits, down open, out...ok ms karan? is that your dress?
Women have always traded their sexual attributes for personal gain.  Some marriages are based on that.  The man provides security and money, while the woman provides the sexual favors or is a trophy wife.  It works the same in all walks of life.  Why else do women spend so much on plastic surgery, revealing clothes and make-up?  Many women continued sexual relationships with Weinstein for years because of what he could do for their careers.  Others kept quiet about him for the same reason.  Weinstein is a horrible person for what he did, but women are not without fault in this.
Leave Mel alone
These women perform sexual acts to get movie parts and become rich makes them whores. Any woman can say no to being paid for sex. Some just choose to be whores.
Harvey Weinstein, the new face of liberal America.
Ohhh, it's just a cancer.
FYI DNYK is in debt to the the money leder/media racial mafia that runs occupied America.  If she does not go along and justify the exploitation by the nongentiles she will be ruined.
Ah the veil is dropping. Maintaining the casting couch mentality is patriarchal and disgusting. \nMen , could you just evaluate your thoughts and behaviors towards women already? Catch up so we can all love together equally. Ciao!
STFU SNOWFLAKES ALL THE HOLLYWOOD KNEW AND SO THIS CUNT JOHN OLIVER ..
Are all american democrats deviants?🇬🇧
Hit it on the head. Weinstein is a scapegoat. There is a far greater foundational problem with the morality of hollywood.
Let's See who is rich here paypal.me/UMukhiya
Every guy excuses this shot behavior
Fuck Donna Karen! Dumb Bitch!
Bruh wtf if he showed up in my room I'd cut his dick off
FACT: All men are potential rapists, and all women are potential whores.
Angie Everheart told everyone but the police.
This guy is not funny
western culture  in a nutshell
Now I know why DKNY reminds me of a word-jumble version of the word donkey.
Holy fuck he's not talking about trump. That's shocking.
Donna Karen is a disgrace. GFY Donna
This is what happens when you are on the outs with the Illuminati.
My only question is why haven't we heard from Gloria Allred yet? That ambulance chasing, media whore is conspicuously absent from this train wreck.
The chick with the pony tail looks like Alice the Goon from the old Popeye cartoon
Kinda proves what a lot of people have been saying... Everyone in hollywood seems to be hiding shit.
If Donna Karen's right, then I guess she's asking for some fucking saddle soap, because her face looks like a weathered scrap of leather pulled over a skull
Did nobody speak out because he was Jewish? Did they fear being labelled an 'anti-Semite'?
john oliver reads a script beautifully
Yeah it's just rape, assault, sexism and other locker room behaviors, so it's ok... Just relax! WtF!!!
You knew Oliver...and you're making jokes out of it, not funny. Go home to the UK
You complicit depraved person, how long did it take you to cover this?

Donna Karen is one ugly bitch
Donna Karen is right though your dressing procacative and slutty you're clothing is saying come fuck me and turning men on. Don't be mad when you attract some nut job who will act on his animalistic instincts. Eat a dick sjw and liberal retards facts are facts
Jews protecting other Jews criminal behavior...color me shocked.
This. Thank you, John. They are trying to teach us to accept the unacceptable, tolerate the intolerable, let them dominate the indomitable, and subjugate the adamant. Thank you for standing up.
John the cuck oliver has probably given Harvey a handy.
Wow Harvey Weinstein looks like Chris moyles in that picture
Jesus Christ, I thought I was hideous. Donna makes me look like a work of art!
Who fucking cares! Get a damn life you sad cunts.
Harvey Wankstain
wtf is that thing!!! @ 1:25
Hollywood going down finally.
Wtf did Donna Karen said???
Of course all these Hollywood liberals are nasty and sitghusting... Stupid ass holes,.. Liberal American Jews who run Hollywood and the music industry need to go!
How do you find a jew\n\n\n\n\nFollow your nose\nNose\nNos\nNo\nN\nNo\nNoo\nNoos\nNoose
This behavior had been going on since Hollywood began. Even as these people come forward about what Harvey did to them, and talk about what other producers and bigwigs have done as well, no other names are being called out. They're still being complacent about this sickening behavior to protect themselves. Makes me wonder who Harvey pissed off to make it all right to come out against him.
Just look up images of the dresses Karen designs, dresses slashed to the thigh, low cut, tight shiney materials. \nSHE is dressing women in the way she is suggesting makes them legitimate targets for letchers like Weinstein!!
support Harvey Weinstein is under now way excusable, but it really does not make sense to me why men dress code is full while women show a lot more skin. Practically a short wind blow would make The Modern WOMAN naked... should men also start dressing with their members out or a small cover on it..... what will that say to the society....  I say stop displaying WOMEN and problems will be solved.
I'm going to have nightmares after seeing Donna Karan. There should have been some sort of warning.
i dont want to be an asshole but..... before watching the video i REALLY didnt know if oliver was going to side with weinstein or not, he opted for the smart approach though, good for him
The academy are a bunch of weasels themselves. There are stories coming out that this Jabba the hut looking mofo has been doing this for years and people knew of it I'm sure the academy knew too. They only say that statement now to cover their asses, there are probably more people like Weinstein in the academy as well.
John Oliver is a traitorous piece of talentless crap. He can only read from a Teleprompter, not even his words, the words are put there by his masters
I really love how John Oliver only spent 2 minutes on this. While in literally EVERY ONE OF HIS SHOWS he manages to spend 10-20 minutes on Donald Trump alone. EVERY SHOW! Stop pushing your democratic agenda you fuck.
Donna Karen is a transexual, observe the male shoulders, collar bones, male gaze, brow ridge, inset eyes etc.  Trannys rule hollywood.
Yes, amillion accusations the moment the story hits... Hmm, funny.
Roman Polanski.
This guys voice is annoying as fuck
If this guy doesn’t go straight to prison everyone needs to take a hard look at themselves, the justice system, the rich, the powerful and modern society.
Celebrities, including talkshow hosts with all their contrived innocence in not knowing anything. What a bunch of hypocrites.
HW's predatory behavior was an open secret in the industry. There's supposedly more, including paedophiles.\n\nThe code of silence needs to be broken.\n\nI hope more get exposed.
I really get a kick out of leftwing cannibalism!
John, this is like Hillary attempting to shame Washington DC, so get fucked you phony. :)
He's a virtue signalling man-gina.Spineless.
And his victims didn’t speak out to “protect their careers” but are now coming out in droves and are called heroes. Shame on you ALL Hollywood
john oliver, left wing faggot that probably has taken money personally from weinstein
Hes yours libs
over a thousand dislikes... Good job proving our point guys good job. Probably think rape should be legal, fucking alt right human filth.
2002 ARTICLE: CROWE'S RACIST INSULT LEADS TO FIGHT \nBy Christine Sams, Eddie Fitzmaurice and Jim O'Rourke\nNovember 17 2002\nThe Sun-Herald\n\nActor Russell Crowe's altercation in a London restaurant started after he made racist remarks about the New Zealand Warriors rugby league team, it was claimed yesterday.\n\nAnd the Sydney-based Oscar winner faced more trouble last night after allegations from a fellow guest at the Japanese eatery that his behaviour had been despicable.\n\nGeorgie Calder, 21, claimed the star had been acting like a total and utter pig moments before violence erupted at the trendy Zuma Japanese restaurant last week.\n\nCrowe, an ardent supporter of South Sydney rugby league club, described the Warriors as a bunch of coconuts or darkies, according to The New Zealand Herald.\n\nIt was about the skin tone, he was calling them COCONUTS or DARKIES, an insider told the Auckland-based newspaper. Crowe's comments reportedly angered Eric Watson, the millionaire owner of the grand finalist Warriors, and led to the punch-up between the two.\n\nThe insider said one of the women at Crowe's table began to cry after his comments, and Watson asked Crowe why he was behaving so irrationally.\n\n[Watson] left the table to go to the bathroom and while he was there, Crowe confronted him, the insider said.\n\nFrom what I can figure out, Eric defended himself well, but the fight was broken up by one of Russell's minders.\n\nAfter the men were separated, Crowe was confronted by a distressed woman, who clutched at his cheeks.\n\nShe has been revealed as Francesca Guise, a New Zealand-born actress who has been in Britain for several months searching for her 15 minutes of fame.\n\nCrowe, 38, was questioned by police after trading blows with Watson on Tuesday night, but will not face charges.\n\nMeanwhile Miss Calder, daughter of British record producer Tony Calder and former model Karen Richardson, yesterday told London's Daily Mail the brawl followed a night of appalling behaviour from Crowe.\n\nShe told the newspaper how the actor had approached her table after their eyes met across the crowded restaurant in a crude attempt to seduce her.\n\nAfter introducing himself, Miss Calder claimed, Crowe suddenly kissed her and licked her face.\n\nShe claimed she tried to push him away, but the Gladiator star asked if she would like to go back to his hotel room. He was utterly revolting, she said. He was acting like he owned the place and everyone in it - including me.\n\nDescribing Crowe's dishevelled appearance, Miss Calder said: He was wearing this crusty old shirt and trousers that he hadn't appeared to have changed for several days - and he smelt.\n\nIt has emerged that Watson, and companions including Guise, were invited on to Crowe's table by the actor, and exchanged pleasantries before the arguments began.\n\nWhat was said between Crowe and Watson inside the men's toilets at Zuma is anybody's guess, but the actor came off the worse for wear.\n\nThe Warriors' owner regularly trains with Kevin Barry, the coach of New Zealand's heavyweight boxing star David Tua.\n\nCrowe has just completed filming Peter Weir's Master And Commander in Mexico.
He said he saw him carrying her out from where he was sitting. But did he not just say he was in between them? RZA is a lying ass coon. Azealia has stayed true to her story, detail to detail to this day.
who would've thought the founder of the muthafuckin WU TANG CLAN would grow to be a coon??? crazy
Damn riz...smdh he apologized to you??? White man spit at the earth bro! I can't fuck wit you no more. #Boo..... you transformed into a coon.
Fuckboys don't check people
BUT EVERYONE SAID AZELIA  was lying. Fuck this coon. The nerve him to defend a white male spitting in the face of a woman and no one comes to her defense.
RZA is the same brutha who responded to Black Lives Matter with the comment Animal Lives Matter. After he said that, I was like this brutha is so OVER Black people. Wow.
Bending over backwards to defend his mass, lost all respect for this nigga.
RZA Why didn't he speak about this when it happen? She trusted you she thoughts you was the homie. Then you don't even defend her or come out to at least confirm her story. He didn't do Shyt because she's a female that's Why!!! If it woulda been one of the dudes from wutang he woulda jumped in and they woulda beaten Russell racist crowe
What's funny is that Damon wayans segment was ahead of its time because lil Wayne said those exact words lol
He took his side.. goes to show Hollywood mother fuckers ain't shit!
This is no longer Rza... its the  We Love You Rakeem dude
You gets no respect RZA...you punk as need to apologize to Azelia...you a coon, a you a liar and a filthy loser....captain coin
He played up to the crazy black woman stereotype and left her out to dry. Smh. so much for solidarity.
FUCK RZA!....COON!
The first time I heard this story I knew rza bitched up don't get me wrong AZ BANKS be tripping but in this situation I'm riding with her FUCK Russell Crow who ever that is
RZA can't be trusted tho, he got two left shoes on, and trying to walk right
No this Negro did not resort to the Bill Cosby  pull your pants up, no hoodie style coonin. Both these negroes must remind themselves in the 60' s, black men wore trousers, not jeans, dress shirts, overcoats, brimmed hats and hushpuppy dress shoes and can be seen wearing these things in clips where they are being sprayed with fire hoses and having German Shepards nipping at their ass.😒
RZA fucked up (although in his defense spit AT vs spit ON is a big difference - spit ON means we fighting, spit AT means you got lucky your spit didnt hit me). But if you notice Azelia didnt show as much vitriol at Russell Crowe when he's the one who actually spit, its easy to go off on the black man but why she aint go off as much on Russell Crowe?
That Girl is always looking for a fight, wtf should Rza have to clean up Her ghetto ways, she’s known to have a foul mouth and she should have got thrown out,  Now Russel Crow if he is a racist why work with his Bitch ass??? Ain’t no way I would, I would never work with anyone like that, Rza should be ashamed for working with that pos, I just lost all respect for all 3 of them Mfs!!!!!
Defending the white man who gives no fucks about him!!! Bottom line is he is a black man who did not defend a black woman regardless of the situation, Rza is a bitch ass nigga!!! And he defending the police? Fuck outta here!!!!!
RZA..smh....
Open up those butt cheeks wider for Russell RZA.
UH RZA?? she was spat on and called a nigger are you really gonna defend that white man?
You cant let some wild ass bitch fuck up your money. What do you call a bitch that keeps  months old chicken blood and guts splattered all over the closet in her bedroom that she probably sleeps in? Fucking crazy thats what you call her.
Right now he wanna tell the truth cuz he trying to promote his moving starring who Ms.Banks. He clearly lied on her that he didnt have to do. Crowe could have put her out without the nigger name calling...considering other blacks was at that party. Fuck Rza. If that was a black man doing that to a white woman it'll be a whole other thing.
Beautiful! This is excellent! Thank You Heza!!
Right poor innocent lil black girl Azealia was simply at a party, and this big bag white man came and spat at her. It wasnt because poor wittle Black girl didnt threatened to cut the throat of guests, and was acting erratic at all. NO WAY! Azealia has been the poster child of someone who is clearly sane and always even mentally. So how dare anyone react to her with violence or aggression. Its just so... horrid. Azealia is an angel, and its merely the white people serving her with the  angry black woman'... she is an angel, and was an angel at this party and did nothing at all. Just an innocent young black woman. Riiiggghhhhtttt..... No way a black woman can act deplorable, and not be attacked. It's just now how social online justice works these days. It's systematic racism. It has nothing to do with her behavior at all... It's the system. Not her. She is and was an angel at this party.... And I mean even if she wasn't, still I mean who gets spit at? I mean yeah she threatened to slice throats AT A HOLLYWOOD party...  but I mean... come on. Trying to find elderly white women guests... I mean... no. Its the system. Not Azealia's behavior at all!
RZA a damn liar. No way he checked Russell Crowe. I can tell by his response that he let that white man spit at Azealia and didn't do shit just because Russell is a big name in Hollywood.
Fuck Banks, she talks shit all the time. She took it to far and she suffered the consequences.
At first I was thrown off by you adding movie clips, but that bloomberg clip and Damon Wayans clip are wild.
Black men watched white men RAPE BLACK WOMEN on slave ships. Black men can't protect their own and they sell drugs and murder other black people in the community.  THEY DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT BLACK WOMEN OR CHILDREN! ONLY THEMSELVES! !!
Fuck you RZA, you lied the first time they ask you, you are a fucking sellout don't ever say you are the real deal or that you're an OG... Fuck you RZA
Fuck rza
ALL - all - A L L - these so called underground rappers who made it to the top - are nothing but media designed actors and sell outs and nothing about real or real HipHop  . All of them are contributing into making Blacks in America and worldwide look stupid. Men who discriminate black woman to the fullest are not better to anyone else - not even to themselves. They are a bunch of people who - without - the respected-sellout-way-called-HipHop - never had enough knowledge to make it to the top anwhere - only very few who make clear and logic remarks are smart - but actually neither WuTang not DasEfx or KRS or any of them were actually smart or wise. They would all be nonsense fools. Sorry but true - there was never anything that was really mindblowing - really except from a very few and they did not even last of course. all these fame bitches in HipHop were nothing but moneyhungry, soulselling, character selling, liars, fakers and cowards. Actually what did HipHop people expect? When 19 year and early twenties guys were trying to teach LOL! And now people in the times of social and digital media get to follow the dudes on their lifes and realize that those PR-images are nothing but real life cowards, liars, assholes, busters, sell-outs and all the bad things -and represent nothing cool. What did the society expect? That behind the criminal praising, foolish acting, omnipotent feeling early twenties something idiots with rather nonsense rhymes and discriminating words - would be some great real life personalities? LOL! A good person can not be or stand behind an asshole statement and spill it - a good person can not discriminate other humans and then be against discrimination on other areas. Thats impossible for the brain to achieve. Such individuals cannot even stop at themselves and are hardcore self hating people as well. The brain aint made that way and those rappers do now get exposed and people see they made a bunch of fools rich who just embarressed the Black society and culture as a whole and are a big part of the problems Blacks face today. Stop letting musicians talk for us - and involve politically and real and stop acting as these dudes are to be tolerated. Its time to admit a mistake when anyone thought these dudes were about something real they were not! Period.
RZA didn't check that cracka!!! I am ashamed of him.\n\nBut Azalea Banks have been acting up ever since she got into the music business.
Jigaboo Rza is a buckdancing sambo!\nhttps://youtu.be/UodDyjyyOIg
That's why I stay away from crakkkas... And from HollyWEIRD!!!
Yall really don't know how much bullshit Azelia been doing over the last few years huh
dont nobody deserve to be spit on tho
I believe Rza
Fake ass nigga!!!! Smfh....
Who gives a shit Azelia Banks I.S fucking crazy
Tats wen I lost mikes
Bitches get horny, niggas die
Wow, RZA! 😢
Wow
Coon talk the fuck man yall people are the reason we may never get passed that shit #equalityforall some of you may think we never should but why you driving the wedge further on the actions of the past new times are coming stop being are cunt and let's just all be human
lol @ white man spitting on a black woman, you better check him fuckin racist trash
Half the people on this thread would spit & polish crows mushroom tip for a red carpet ticket TRUTH! ! !
Damon Wayans was portraying Lil Wayne!!!
So what if a white man spits on a black woman? if u have a problem with him spitting its fine but what does race have to do with this?
I don't care about the video but why don't Americans understand the past tense of spit is SPAT!\n Russell Crowe spat on Azealia Banks or Russell Crowe will spit on Azealia Banks, but Never Russell Crowe spit on Azealia Banks
Its nothing racist about that... Azalea Bankz is a cunt
Nope.  Azealia is certified nuts.  If her past history will give you more than a clue as to her character.  I believe RZA when he says she went after Russell like a man.  So he had to correct her.  Many of you guys would do the same.  The only reason why it pisses you off is because he is white.  I've seen plenty of Black guys manhandle white girls just for not calling him by his street name.
LMAO PLEASE. AZEALIA WENT AFTER RUSSEL CROWE LIKE A MAN, TRYING TO FIGHT. WTF.... GTFO!!! YALL JUST WANNT SOCIAL JUSTICE THE SHIT OUTTA EVERYTHING!... BYE HO'S!~ SHE TRIED TO ACT LIKE A MAN....  Yall act like someone calling you a Nigger is the worst thing in the world that can happen to you in all of history... It sucks. But dayum... our own behavior is what people judge us on. Banks aint working with a full deck.
Can’t blame Russell Crowe on this one.
I guess I'm the only one who watched the video. \n\nI'd do far more than spit at someone if they threw a glass at me (in my own house/party??).
this is nothing new. I don't ever recall black men coming to our defense. Malcolm X even said black women are the most unprotected pple on earth. rza did what most black men do, defend his controllers and holler the black woman is guilty. sadly black men can't even PROTECT THEMSELVES against whites,letalone somebody else.\nthat caucasoid spit on AZ cuz he KNEW HE COULD.
Russell spits at a nigga bitch, so what. This bitch fucked up a humble gathering and fools are calling Rza a coon. Fuck that. She is an embarrassment like most black women, today. Don't sacrifice your shit for a nigga-bitch. Az is a buffoon and black men should not cape for low level women. \nAs for Rza changing, yes, he is a grown man now. The God is about refinement. You can't carry all of your thoughts you had when you were 20 something into your 40's and 50's unless you're a damn fool who hasn't be cultured. I bet Damon Wayans don't even carry the same sentiments placed in the clip.
Russell Crowe is cool.
Azalea Banks = Scum Worker Retawded Witch
That chick was outta line
She Deserved getting spat on !! That itch !!!
I'm offensive and I find this black !
Why you gotta pay that much for avacado?
It's funny how this show is actually intellectual and no one get it....
“Now do a lap” lol
true why BPs can swin ?
Is Frylock secretly an Uncle Ruckus?
RACIST ...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fucking hilarious
do a lap
Do I look like a duck?! \n\nxD
here drink this hell noooo  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 its milk lmfao 😂😂
BOOOOOO GRIZLIES!!!
ha if only salt lakes' hockey team was that violent. then again be nice if the jazz was
LoL Yeah, that's real talk. When I'm wearing a Polo shirt and Dockers, white people at the grocery store ask me for help too.
Wouldn't the avocados turn him Latino?
PUT 'EM ON THE GLASS
Can confirm. Avocados are expensive.
Yo bra this be racist
How To Be White For Black People 101
Daaayum those expensive! XD
I'm offensive and I find  this black
i just like the case it comes in gotta go trash diving for them containers for that 5 cent recycle value.
Why are black people on Adult Swim if they can't swim?
Once you go black, you can't get credit 
I just like the case it comes in I pissed a little in my pants first time I heard that lol
Wait, so black people can't swim?
I didn't know about the swimming stereotype O.o
I always thought Frylocke was black.
WHY YOU GOTTA PAY SO MUCH FOR AVOCADOS??
did this predicted the #AltRight
i like how frylock makes sure to say that the hockey team is from salt lake city. whitest city in america
lol oh God
lol the goalie is just spitting out blood.
No video. Just a black screen.
Squeeze those organic avocados
I love how the goalie is bleeding profusely in the background.
is this the predictipn of the #AltRight
aw naw I ain't hearin that lmfao
Isn't Frylock black?
LOLOLOL His afro caught on fire
gets thrown into water, comes up on fire. lmao love this show
Say what you want, avocados taste delicious.
Swim!....Aw naw, i aint hearing that
0:19 hockey is not that violent 😂😂😂
Bai DA hawt sawse
I would _so_ do that woman in the produce section if she gave me a chance. Healthy - looking, & probably an animal between the sheets.
R.I.P. Shake's big sneakers :(
niggers
Make America White Again
The goalie just got decapatied
As someone who works in a grocery store, I can confirm the joke about the avocados and white people being obsessed with produce isn't that far off.
HAHA that was one tough hockey game. It was a damn warzone out there.
Now do a lap, damnit!\nWithout my expensive sneakers?!
HE NEEDS SOME MILK
Oh my god, when it showed him on the pool...
Do I look like a duck?
Ah naw, I aint hearin that, do I look like a duck?
What episode is this looool
Was that lady wearing a tube top or a sports bra?
This is a new level of racism.... I fucking love it!
ha ha ha ha haha ha ha!
i ain't hearin' that!  what do i look like a duck? omg
Lol, they could've said NASCAR instead of Hockey. I know some black people that like Hockey. Also, who the fuck doesn't drink milk?
its where u came from
Classic
I thought the joke was once you go black you never go back
what about Boxy Brown?
Too white
Satire is funny.
that hockey player got decapitated
My hair caught fire when i fell in the pool too
jilatmemek
Man...this episode. I think the Amazing Racist is funny...and this episode still made me uncomfortable.
 The man who voices Frylock is a black fellow in real life, so I wonder how he must have felt trying to 'change' that crazy Shake into White?!? I know it's just a comedy show, of course.
Swim goddam you, swim lol
The way he said avocado.\nwhy you gotta pay dat much for a avocahdoh\nlmao.
By the hot sauce
Damn ATHF always has the hottest women
Shake when Black LOL  I never sceen this episode
BUT MY BIG SNEAKEHS!!
Isle 2, now put 'em on the glass...
Its a professional hockey game...the team is from Salt Lake City XD TOO WHITE
Hahahazz 
smh
0:40 So, she doesn't want the bbc?
if anything this is mocking white people
Hel naw DO A LAP.lol
The way Shake says avocado cracks me up.
Deliciously racist
Esay to see why Frylock would want an asshole like Shake the hell out of the black community, hard to see how they got this past the censors. And yet, the owner of the Clippers has to give up his team just for not wanting his half-black girlfriend hanging out with notoriously horny, AIDS-infected woman chaser Magic Johnson. Cause THAAAAATS RAAAACIST. Even though he made no comment that disparaged Johnson's race, merely his person. If only we could all disparage people based on the content of their character rather than superfacialities such as skin color, oh the glorious insults we could fling.
lol, it's ok cause it's making fun of white ppl
WHITE POWER

Be a man, and fix the damn thing yourself! Jesus, do you also pay a mechanic to put washer fluid in your car too?
That's why I hate the city.
You would have to pay if it was duck tape.
This is why Trump wanted mexicans to build the wall
New York, America's shit hole :)
The reason i dont pay contractors is because im broke
Best I can do is 25¬¢
Looks like fake. However anything can be spected. That work deserves a big facepalm( and to look for the 4chan's cams).
So how come you didn't fix it yourself
Something tells me this guy did not call an actual contractor. He probably called an unlicensed handyman because he didn't want to pay for an actual tradesman to come out and do the work. At least I hope that's the case.
Congrats on getting on Trending. I‚Äôve been watching you since you were at around 25000 subscribers. Keep up the good work!
I would hand them the traditional payments of my people. A banana shoved into a pile of my own shit. There is nothing more sacred than this as payment for good deeds.
Probably be easier to just get waterproof duct tape and tape the leak
cheap, fast, and good. Can't have all three .
Russian Hack, we call it in Germany =)
Contractor was dumb ass you can't fix that.
Oh yes...this only happens in NYC.
Put your contractor on blast!!!
You New Yorkers have the coolest accent in America.
I'm from PA and see this in the warehouse I work in... lol
*watches one DIY video on YouTube*\n\nI think I could start my own business now!
As a contractor from washington, this makes me sad...
That was pretty creative not going to lie.
From the A.C....to the wall...till the ac drips down my ballz..ooo these contractors foul.
Crazy. They couldn‚Äôt even bother to use duct tape!! üòÇ
That ac is in a shitty location and a window unit to boot. Cant place a condensation line cuz it located above the entrance. Someone will sue you for slipping on the water on sidewalk.
who puts an air conditioner above a door? that's my question. looks like a safety hazard without angle brackets.\nplus it has to drip somewhere.. on customers? guess that's the city for ya!
Sounds like you need an appliance repair person. Not a contractor......
Looks like something a Mexican would have done,you know those brilliant border jumpers we must have here because of their talents
Well you cheap bastard , shouldn't gone with a licensed contractor!
I would of attatched a tray to the bottom of the unit, with a pvc connector funneling the water to a pipe running down the wall to the sidewalk. Itd work and look much better!
Well, I guess those claims that Trump didn't pay contractors might be for crap like that then
holy shit\ni should move over there if contractors over there are so shit lol\ni couod do good just by being able to do a normal job lol
please, save your money next time and buy yourself a better camera
You're telling me you don't have a spare iPhone to record this with, Louis? Yeesh...
This guy sounds like he should be eating a calzone and grabbing his vick
That's highly unacceptable.
Did the video quality go from ok to potato for anyone else? Looks like minecraft
Didn't they show you the repair before they left ? Not all contractors are the same. Just do your homework next time on the guy you decide to hire. Be responsible and you will have better results.
If it is stupid and it works, it ain't stupid.
yikes how much did they try to ask for that
Think of this as trumps health care if it passes
Look fixed pay the contractor
Take that shit to Judy, judge Judy.
Hope you didn't pay for this.
Well Louis being that this is window Air Conditioner unit \nCause 1: Clogged Condensate Drain Line\nCause 2: Damaged/Rusted Drain Pan\nCause 3: Broken Condensate pump\nCause 4: Dirty Air Filter\nCause 5: Low Refrigerant\nCause 6: Excessive Pressure (Dirty Condenser/Evaporator Fins) \nCause 7: Frozen Evaporator Coil\nWhen was it last full maintenance cleaning schedule done 10 years age? LoL
hahahaha... Louis, that was so funny!
Wow, just wow no other words.
Looks fixed to me.  I love NY
I'm not sure what else could be done. AC pulls moisture out of the air, and this particular type of unit releases the moisture out of the back. Some allow you to hook a hose, but that water does have to go somewhere. Many have no connection port as the water is condensed onto the coils and just drops out of the back.
You look like you need some fucking sleep bro
Why in the hell would you put a condensing unit above the front door of your establishment? It's called a Condensing Unit for a reason....it produces water from the heat and humidity in the air! OMG!!! Spoiled city slickers!
Nobody cares if your a real New Yorker
Don't air conditioners always leak water alittle bit?
Fuck, this is like Hong Kong.
If you want to pay 15 dollars for a fix. This is what you deserve.
AC's drip water. That's how they work. Your car AC does the same. What is your proposed solution for this? The guy could have routed a pipe along the glass hidden in some material but then you'd be paying a helluvalot and still complaining. Given the location of the AC, what's your solution?
Jokes on him, the AC is supposed to leak from there.
eeeh, foget abooouut it!
Nuke New York
Truth
Seems legit
25 cents for trying
WtfüòÇ
Trending?
Sue those assholes
bra
memes gone too far
BUT It WORKS !!!
Unions
it works tho
we trendin bois!!!
Louis you're trending :D
fugetaboutit!
Which contractor? Expose him/her!
No FUCKING way!!! Jesus.. CHRIST!
I've been in the HVAC industry since 2002.  This was a hack job.  But in their defense it's a window unit, they don't make an after market drain pan for these units.  What did they charge ?    I would have installed a auxiliary condensate pump below it then ran the vinyl tubing to a downspout or corner to drain.  The purpose of an air conditioner is to remove humidity from a location.  The moisture leaves the evaporator coil and sent in this case to the condenser then flung into the condenser dropping head pressure and discharge temps.  Increasing efficiency whatever is left drips out.
It's New York, who cares. Everything is trashy and dirty there.
That's quite a liability having something THAT heavy sitting above a doorway
He got what he was willing to pay for. A hack contractor at $40 to fix it. \nGood ain't cheap and cheap ain't good. \nThe only solution I see is building a shallow drip pan, instal, seal it and hard pipe it down to the ground. I guarantee they wouldn't want to pay what that would cost to stop the condensation drip.
He does realize that those wall units do leak condensation and your head is not supposed to walk under them, it's not his fault you installed it into a stupid place.
Well, this is what happens when you go cheap. Rather pay an actual contractor or some guy who says he'll fix the issue? You're just a bigot blaming contractors, reminds me of someone who blames a whole group of people for something committed by an individual.
license and unlicense contractors. Don't hire a unlicensed contractor and bash real license contractor.
No uploads in a year and then you drop this gem.
Do you hate scousers.. erm... haha I love the hesitation.
Nice interview. Gracious of him to take the time.
that moment when you leave Gary Neville hanging
Lifelong Liverpool fan and have always liked Gary Neville ... he hated us and we hated him ...a born winner he was a top quality player and very solid guy
Gary being interviewed by the British Seth Rogan!!!
Lol how'd you manage this, nice one.
I like Gary but he's wrong about Suarez, if United ever signed suarez it'd be a disgrace to the legend of Uncle Pat.
Love listening to him
Can not believe neville has actually just said he would love suarez at united might be a really good player but after what he did to evra i would never want him anywhere near man united
Best football pundit at the moment
The hairdryer question...I swear I could see Gary's fear coming back onto his face.
The intro made me skip to another video.
Well done Gary - always talking sense as usual
Man Utd have always appointed british managers? Tell that to Frank O'Farrell Gary. Man Utd have traditionally had non-English managers, because, in the football world, there is no 'british'.
Confused when seeing the thumbnail; thought it was prankster EdBassmaster pulling one of those funny faces.
lFC  you'll never win the league  ha ha ha come back when youve  won 18 ha
manchester city will win the league
Yip, Jose has never hung around that long at clubs. \nBut he's never been manager at a club like this and all that we encompass ‚ù§Ô∏è
Legend
that table though
Amazing work. Been awhile since you uploaded anything, that was definitely worth waiting for! Happy to have one video a year if that video ends up being a sit down with a United legend.
Really enjoyed this, cheers.
Thank fuck you're back. Also quality interview.
Great Interview!
Cranium Giganticus
Absolutely
Great interview
Gaz.. get the guitar
Brilliant vid
amazing interview
Peroni   lovely  lager
city winnin the CL is a bigger deal than LFC winnin the PL. im a man utd fan by the way
Manchester is being destroyed by savage immigration.
I am a Everton fan and a Scouser Gary would have been a great central defender he was to short though but Rio was quality .
This guy fufilled every manc kids dream. \nFair play to him, always stayed humble and loyal. Respect
Don't want Suarez. Thanks.
Quality interview
Gary Neville is a true United legend, bless him!
Corona is Mexican Mr Neville ;-)
I'm still salty Steve didn't die horrifically
Wait, did Netflix just make a fan video of their own show???
Can we please get a version of the show in this filter!??? Make it happen Netflix.
This came out 1year ago and I still haven't watched it.
Let's face it, what we all really wanna focus on is eleven and mike's romance in this season/show.
If nancy and johnathon get together il kill myself cya
I ship Nancy and Eleven üòä
Is it just me or the one that Elle Mills made was so much better
Like So 80s Man. Can we call it Strange Love???\nAny way the trailer Rocks and one more month left for Season 2!!!
These characters are my favorite part of Stranger Things. Just set this to some 80's music - Tears for Fears or something. :)
Come on October 27th. I can't wait to watch one of my favorite Netflix shows
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A HINT THAT THE LOVE TRIANGLE GETS REAL NEXT SEASON. Because Hopper and Joyce is where the real action is. damn.
*Beginning: He was a jerk.* \n*Ending: He was my favorite supporting cast.*
Lmaoo at 0:12 who thought that was Barbra?
i think the fuck not
Why this doesnt even have new footage!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is probably Netflix's best series of all time. All time!
JANCY JUST GOT A NEW SHOW. AWESOME
I'm a smidge a creep and a perv, and he even freaks me out; but, I am the goofy lovable perv.
so ready to see barb back on the stream :)
Mike: What was your test on? Human anatomy?\n\nMe: SHOTS FIRED OHHHH CRAP DANG OHMAGAWD FIRE ALARMS GO OFF
This was so so so so cute!!!! Loved it!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
NANCY AND JOHN SHOULD OF GOT TOGETHER! STILL PISSED üò° üò§
Netflix when is the 13 reasons why season 2 coming??!üòÖüòÖüòÖ
Feels like a John Hughes movie.
>-< I thought this was another trailer XD
Nancy belongs with Johnathan not Steve, bottom line cut and fucking dry
The funny thing is, of this was an actual trailer, I would never watch it. But I love it in Stranger Things. I think it's because the rest of the show provides enough that I can avoid thinking about the romance when I need to.
Anyone who hasn't seen Stranger things and you don't like spoilers please don't watch this, it's not a trailer. It shows basically all of the scenes haha
Johnathans my fav i love him so much
JANCY IS MY FAVE! And can't wait to see them in S2
The power of editing lol
Roses are red\nViolets are blue\nI thought this clickbait shit was a trailer\nAnd so did you
why did I watch Barb asking Nancy a question and think this was a season 2 trailer when I know that barb is dead?
God bless you Netflix for making this happen for me
I still think Nancy should have broken up with Steve and gotten together with johnathan but NOOOO. (At lest Steve saved their lives when the demagorgon almost freaking killed them)
Now do Mike and Eleven.
This show isn't a ROMANTIC SHOW
Plot twist- Steve and Jonathan  love each other
I think love just got stranger!
I don't know about anyone else, but I kept being distracted by Steve's hair, thinking how could she let that get close to her.
Can NOT WAIT!!! I‚Äôm in the upside down!!! üôÉüòçüòçüòçüôåüî•‚ù§Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüòòüòáüòàüòâ xxx
Anyone know what the music is?
This is great. I want this to be a cheesy 80s movie now.
I thought the way Steve attacked the Demogorgon with a bat was awesome but I'm with Team Jonathan.
That would be the worst thing ever.
I NEED IT TO BE OCTOBER 27TH.
I want the whole series with photography!! Please rel√©ase it like this! üò±üò∞üòÜ
A love triangle is in the works can't wait Season 2!!!
Please don't go deep in this love-interest subplot. Just stick to the original genre.
I love Steve as a character but I hate that he got Nancy in the end. One of the best moments of season 1 was Jonathan beating the shit outta Steve. Jonathan and Nancy seems like a compelling relationship.
lol first thought: Why is Netflix on my Jancy playlist of fan videos???? It's like they know! #TeamJancy
JANCY WILL RISE, I'M TELLING YOU üôåüôå
GIVE ME THAT SECOND TRAILER
bitch, barb is still in the upside down and eleven is dead but sure, focus on some love triangle bullshit.
now replace steve_strangerthings with steve_minecraft and create some memes
If Stranger Things is a teenage fantasy film
Fuck off Netflix you are not creating your own fan fiction that's our job
I love this fake trailer like it's some 80s cheesy romance drama and not science fiction
The marketing for this show is brilliant
Will it get stranger in season 2
this is the cutest thing ever
Fuck Nancy,  Steve and Jonathan should be in a relationship and be the first openly gay couple in the 80s , that will be hot
The title cards should have been a voiceover narration.  That would have felt way more '80s
i never seen this show is it good?
I feel like I‚Äôm the only stancy shipper here
I THINK TF NOT AGHHHH
WAHHHHH IM SCREAMING üòçüòç
WTF THIS WAS SO PERFECT
This is so hype
OMFG MY JANCY HEART
NANCY AND JONATHON !!
when netflix deadass ships jancy
justice for barb
I ship Jancy sooo freaking much!!!!
Fuck Steve.
stupid VHS filter
One Tree Hill
AWHHHH STOP.
*Jonathan or Steve? Nancy üòç*
Johnathan deserves someone better~
WTF?
Brilliant.
Jonathan!
It makes me cry
WTF is this ?
RIP Barb :(
Jancy foreverüíñüíñüíñ
this was so awesome.
Barbs !
BRING\nBACK \n*BARB*
BAAAARBS ‚ô°
nice
MORREEEE
IF ONLY
Season 3 looks neat
this is like one of those romance movies from back in the day
*I love how everybody is involved in Will's missing but nobody gives a fuck about Barb*
Love is always strange
I love this show more than I love my own life.

Have you tried First Vita Plus GUYABANO Gold or Platinum? It is 10,000 stronger than any leading chemotherapeutic drug..

Haley was speachless cuz Coron was so beautiful...I have seen you speachless also when Alodia was by you...her kindness and compassion are apparent to us viewers too even if she may not officially be your soulmate
I just wanted to say that I saw this woman on chrisbestcancer who had colon cancer and she cured her cancer by juicing carrots everyday., She juiced 5 pounds of carrots everyday and otherwise didn't change too much of her life. I think she is a famous author.,
My Friend's chemo took effect after the 4th session. She said that the pain is too much that she can't barely move even though she is just laying down on her bed. I hope for the best Wil! I know you are a strong chonggo and you can overcome this! Praying for you dude! :)
I'm praying and sending healing vibes to you!!‚ô°‚ô°

Cancer cells lives in an acidic body. Alkalize your body by drinking alkalized water. Check on KANGEN Water. Its a japanese machine you install at the faucet that turns tap water into healthy drinking and all diff kinds of water. It will help you, Will! You can buy it anywhere now, I guess.

Hi Wil, I am Anne from LA California, a proud kapampangan, we have the best kapampangan mom, they have same kapampangan traits.. hi mudra, me and my husband literally watch your vlogs by number. You inspired me to do things that am afraid to try. I am not an outdoor person but watching your vlogs, I realize it's not too late to try and enjoy. I am praying for you. I know you can do it coz you are a nice person. Get well soon. Hi to mudra, pudra and hailey..
Hi Wil, i am happy if your happy and condition is good. Thank God. You are one of the inspiration to all especially those with cancer. Keep up the spirit, may Almighty God will heal you in Jesus name. Amen.
Dose it hurt when they access the port
Look up Vitamin B17 and start taking CBD oil. Please make this top comment so Wil can see it.
Tsonggo are you gonna shave ur head also?
Good luck on your chemo! The worst  effect on me was the 4th session which makes me feel tired, sleepy and irritable. But after that, everything will be normal again. And also I have to bring the pump home for two days and return on my next chemo. Make sure you eat properly and take this one day at a time. Before you know it, you're done with your session already.
Hahaha wait, i have to pause to comment the ‚Äúlights on‚Äù üòÇüòÇ  omg

I was by chance watching this show when her performance of this song blew me away. I immediately had to learn to play it on the piano and sing it. Could not get the song out of my head. There is a certain sadness about it. Love her interpretation and I am now a huge fan.
Love this song so much and her voice is everything!  üíó
And suddenly my girl crush on her from when I was 12 is back
AND THE BEST SONG EVA I LOVE IT ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüî•
Why is no one mentioning it sounds like Same Old Love by Selena Gomez?
Same cookie cutter shit every song sounds like these days
SOO much better without the RAP part.
you should get the band why dont we to perform
I think this performance just turned me into a fan of hers! Loved the choreography and direction and her voice was killin it!
Watching as a person who doesn't know who this person is, the song sucks.  I only got in about a minute and already had to click the X button.
I‚Äôm I the only one focusing on the sax guy
can someone take her to havana and leave her there already? please and thank u.
The guy dances in the background is my spirt animal
My guuuurl :3 Her voice ahhhhhhh i'm dead üòçüòç‚ù§‚ù§
i cant stop looking at the guy in the back *yelp*
This performance made me like her a tiny minuscule bit.
I love the second part of the song. It's not a part of the single but I wish it was.
great performance..however i do feel her n the dancers could've shaked more with the Latin spice..they seem a lil stiff but I understand it's not easy to move in heels.
Her outfit reminds me of britneys oops I did it again and I'm not mad at it haha . She's like a sexy devil/car racer üòÇüòà
I wish she wasn't wearing that because the loose pants make her look old and when she dropped low with the backup dancers the pants just it was bad I wish she was wearing something different everything else loved because I love camila cabello

I'm obsessed with This, like fuck she slayed she's my queen, icon, fucking amazing.
Who‚Äôs fifth harmony? She‚Äôs slaying
But the fact that this video already has more views than fifth harmonys performance on James corden üëÄüëåüèº
She is indeed very talented‚ù§üëç
why the yellow stage? Omg \nred clothes: obvious Havana\npromoting two songs\nI love you Camila
Definitely a damn good solo artist!!!!!! She has never needed fifth harmony!!!! Still much love for them though!
this presentation It reminded me of britney spears wing in the vmas 2016 ...\nGood song
For some reason......I reeeeeeeaaalllllly want to see her in a movie. Something like Man on Fire..idk lol
I danced while humming to Havana ooh na na~ be it on the streets, in the bathroom or in my workplace.. This bop stuck in my head üòòüòòüòò
Can we have this version?! No rap just you!

Me encantaüòç Y ese trompetazo al principio me hizo recordar a mi hermano que tocaba la trompeta :(
Su espa√±ol es tan Sexy
El Outfit se parece al de Demi cuando estubo en ese programa hace unas semanas.
No hay que vestirse como zorra para triunfar y ser sensual.
I like her but I have no idea what she was singing.
the background dancers entertained me way more than Camila did lol
I like her voice not the song
Camila looks a little chunky!!!!!
Lord that dancing SUCK
Camila was always meant be a solo artist. I always felt like she got held back because of fifth harmony. And NO I‚Äôm not saying that I don‚Äôt like the rest of fifth harmony. They‚Äôre an amazing talented group, but I just feel like they do better as a 4 piece group. I would definitely love to hear a Fifth harmony ft. Camila cabello song
Camila and demi lovato has the same outfit when they both performed in the tonight show üòÅ
oh shit that voice is so good! I just cant stop with camila and zayn music is just to good!
That wasn‚Äôt a hit
Hey Estee, I‚Äôm a 27 YO guy (probably not your usual demographic) and I randomly discovered one of your vlogs maybe 5 years ago during a break up. It was a rough patch for me, it really sucked. Your videos helped and they were a great distraction. When the pain of the break up finally passed, the love of your videos remained! You, Aslan and Reggie became a part of my morning routine. I feel like I‚Äôve seen you and your channels grow, and I‚Äôve grown up with you too. I‚Äôve travelled so much the last few years and I think your travelling videos are to thank for it, keeping me motivated to see as much of the world as I can. I even introduced my new girlfriend to your videos and we watch them together as often as you upload haha! I‚Äôve just listened to your first podcast and I love this new direction. I wish you all the best and good luck. Anyway, just wanted to pass on some love!
It is great to understand what happens in the background & who is working (which roles) in order to get a podcast. Thanks!
I was smiling so hard watching this!! So nice to see how it's like behind the scenes :D wishing you lots of success! Excited for the Mum episode!
Hey Estee, I love your podcasts and your more serious side! Don't get me wrong, makeup and beauty are awesome but it's great to know there's so much more to you. And the podcasts are really well produced as well (shoutout to the team), I SO look forward to hearing more! Subscribed already, keep it up!
YES GIRL! x
sooo proud of you estee!!! can't wait to see you grow even more!
No! You weren't lucky to win! You won because you were the best. Girls! Don't be afraid of your own success!
The recording room definitely makes a difference!! Totally heard the quality change once you walked into the room and at the outro. I‚Äôve never been a big podcast listener but I listen to a lot of NPR so I feel like I‚Äôm properly prepped to delve into yours! üíï
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU üòò Been subscribed to your podcast for a long time and bam! 2nd ep just got released and I'm stoked to listen to it on my way to work tomorrow üòúüíì

Thank you for using your platform in a meaningful way, Estee! It's been incredible to watch you evolve from makeup tutorial and clothing haul videos to this beautiful podcast!

Congratulations on the new podcast! I already love what you and Aslan are doing with the current affairs videos, so I'm really looking forward to diving into this. It's very exciting to see how you and your content are evolving. I've been watching you and other lifestyle YouTubers for years and honestly, these days, my subscription list is looking stale/repetitive (not another PR unboxing!). Thank you for being so brave and pushing yourself to create new kinds of content as you and your viewers mature. Sending my love from Singapore!
I have so much respect for you Estee. You are a modern day maven - you work so hard, but it's your warmth and authenticity that is at the core of everything you do. Brava x

Dammmmmn commitment ‚úåÔ∏èüòÅ
You should have shown us the projects that failed. would have been nice to see what went wrong.
Man that looks amazing!! Congrats on your wedding and welcome back!! Im actually going to shoot my Brothers Green BGBQ video today!!!! I can't wait to get that out!
Congatulations on your wedding!!!!   I would be so scared to eat moldy food even though I would buy it.  LOL  üå¥üíñüåπüå∏üíöüòõüå∫ü§óüåªüòÄüå¥
Mike looking like he just finished a 2 hour sex sesh
I literally had no idea what miso was made of! The things you learn on this channel. However I have 0 patience so I think I would just buy this
Next time: homemade tempeh? :)
Nice! I was wondering about this. :) Ps. Congrats!
PORNHUB
You are not supposed to cook the miso for minutes. It actually looses flavour the longer you cook it. You are suposed to add it disolved at the last step and then turn the stove off inmediatly or ideally just before adding it. You'll realise like that that a little bit of miso will add more flavour than a lot of it cooked for minutes
I woke up to find a Brothers Green Eats and a SortedFood video in my subscription box. Is today my birthday or something? Anyway, congratulations on your marriage!
Congrats bro!
He's alive
Heck yeah, glad to hear you're married and well! I'll step up my miso game too and abandon my stores soup packets
Congratulations. Just subscribed to your new Instagram. Are you still living in New York. I see your brother has moved. Wishing you much success
Great vid! Would love to see a full length video on the miso fermentation
Cilantro üòç
You guys, uh, *sigh* really love your cilantro...
I really thought this was going to be you trying the Chipotle queso hahahaha
Song at 6:40 ? someone bless my ears please
Why do I watch these videos when I'm hungry...?
I would love to see you guys do a video of recipes using matcha!!!
Koji rice is so cool. I keep meaning to start a miso...I‚Äôve done the steak aging
finally, glad to see you, seen very much awkward bad and vegan food while you were gone
Hey you should embarrass your self and sign up for master chef season 9, lol

misoüòã
this soup looks incredible! i love the simplicity --- definitely making.
I remember that episode, it's soo exciting to see the finished product and seeing you enjoing it. So happy for you!
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Made this for dinner. Amazing
Anyone know where to get his spice jars???
3 seconds off of that extra ad revenue. \nRespect.
does anyone have a count on the word miso ? lol \nall jokes aside,  great vid. Miso is the shizz.
well Hey, Lets meet the Mrs.............
Think maybe YouTube Red would take your show?
What's the video about?
He is so much different when he‚Äôs not high
Do you have any recipes with Tofu Noodles. i've been making it sort of like a Pho.  Curious to see what else there is to do with it.
Thought I was watching cheese
Congratulations, Mike!
Gz!!!!\nNice Ring \nGoood luck from Germany
Wow this looks incredible!!
Congrats bro!
Yay! My favorite BG brother is back...
This is so cool! I didn't know that miso was made like this. Could you try making tofu?
how long can you store the ready miso paste, and where would you store it?
Welcome back! Missed you and look forward to all your projects. Thank you for sharing.
miso is kinda halfway to soy sauce. so try making soy sauce next?
Where's the link for  the koji rice?
Wooow, i'm from Spain and I appreciate thaaat :3 crongrats for ur wedding. I watch eeevery v√≠deo and I LOVE the channel
Congratulations! Was afraid we were down to one brother. Lots of big changes for Brothers Green. Now we need some cooking challenges every now and then. Test tasters would have to travel -- almost sound like a perfect job for your parent (grandmas will want to visit more when grandkids come along). Of course, Mama Green may not be the best judge for two of her own. LOL.
Thats a lot of miso. I could take some off your hands if you want
I've made miso soup about 5x's now & LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è IT!!!!! A lot of Americans are unaware of it, it seems.
That looks so warm and comforting.\n\nCongratz on ur marriage‚ù£Ô∏è
Hi! I'm from Spain and I'm really glad you have enjoyed your trip here in Spain :)
You should make some asian style grilled cheese with that misomato soupüòù
Guys if you can't find Koji rice, you can make miso paste by combining store bought miso with cooked soy beans ( yellow peas work as well) and salt. Leave it ferment and don't forget sprinkle a layer of salt to prevent mold.
Watching this as I'm eating my 90¬¢ ramen and pretending I'm eating this instead. Looks so good!
I didn't know I was a type of rice.
Nice idea, this miso tomato soup.\nBut first you cook your soup and then you have to add miso at the end of cooking. Miso shouldn't get boiled. The mother of my husband is from Japan and told me so.\n:)
Yayyyyy, the boss is back!
Freaking love you alls channel. I have been watching y'all for a few years and I just love the content but yalls voices are soothing AF as well üòÇ
I'M FROM SPAIN, PLEASE RECOMMEND SOME RESTAURANTS/ PLACES TO EAT
So is Brothers Green going bye bye since they're both doing their own thing?
thank god. I've missed you!
this looks great! i've been wanting to get some koji from japan  (natural import company http://www.naturalimport.com/ --it's where i get ume vinegar, tamari and toasted sesame oil, etc.) but i wanted to try the korean method where they don't use koji, it takes a year and you get soy sauce and korean miso: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGhKwCq7SZk
You got married? Oh you poor fool. I hope it's a painless.
You got some doo doo in that jar? Good for you, finally a chef who can cook a good doo doo dish!

Palm sugar and other palm products aren't sustainable, man. Smh
I dont usually eat in the morning, but watching this made me hungry for this recipe. I can definitely see myself doing this.
Went to Spain. Sucked being black.
where is the other bloke?
All of Europe is pretty chill from where i visited. America only seems to be in a rush.
There is more people in that one shot than at my entire wedding, is that sad? :P
First of all ... Congratulations! üíçüíç\nSecond .. That miso looked ammazzzing\nThird... To get all the benefits of miso you should only add it at the last minute and don't let it boil.\nBon appetite üçúüëåüèª
Just made this soup...It's absolutely incredible. Mike, you godsend fucking genius! The soup is so rich and somehow creamy.I've been watching your videos for a while now but this is the first time I follow one of your recipes to the letter. I was mind blown about how simple and yet how delicious this soup is. THX
Bros Green... how is it that you guys are so ambitious and hard working yet so chill at the same time?
I can easily make this vegan, thanks!!
congrats on your wife achievement unlocked :)
I got assassinated in the comments by your subscribers just for mentioning homeless people in Denver. I'm unsubscribing. Not the kid of people I want to associate with. Hope you have  a wonderful experience here in Colorado though. üëãüèæüôèüèª
Yeah, the younger generation...\nHow about making dead sure you do NOT miss your flight instead? )))\nThey usually come to the airport a couple of HOURS before the flight, you know...\n–û–¢–í–ï–¢–ò–¢–¨
Hi.. what app did u use to create the video?
I was at an airport once for 24 hours - on Christmas Day - on the other side of the world - the person who was supposed to pick me up - didn't - was unreachable - glad you had a good time (seriously, this was awesome) I did not.
Great job taking a bad situation and making it fun that's soo cool üòäüëçüèºüëçüèº
Great work Mahshid.  May I suggest changing the title to 'An Iranian Girl All Night at the Airport'? That may change the wrong negative image of Iranians around the world!!!!!
I have no idea who that girl is but I really want to be her friend.
That's awesome! Way to make the best of a bad situation :-D
You look like Kangana Ranawat...don't know if I spelt it right
Wow she's good!
This made me smile and I needed it today. Thank you! :)
Damn..that man in the suit...has got some moves...I wonder if he is single...yum. I wanna be stuck at that airport...looks like great people...compared to jersey or berlin.
I usually write down some really off the wall comments, but I like the video. Great job!
You are SO beautiful and funny and such a great dancer! this put a huge smile on my face :) You need to have your own show...you need to have your own 24/7 channel!!!

Welcome to manchester  united #mo10 #kingofasist
I watched this video with shitty internet.
I hate the buffering so much.
Rural Co-ops funded by the REA built power lines the private companies wouldn't, Remember folks, socialism never works, but Capitalism will always have your back.../S
I think that it isn't that unemployment is high because of no internet, but that internet is low because of unemployment
so blame it on the wifi huh?
Sorry but coloration doesn't equal cassation since rich areas have broadband  not poor areas describing the divide in health, education, and poverty
this is a really really interesting video! i've never thought about this before!
What a false equivalency at the 30 second mark
............We. Need. to. consult. Europe! How did they fix their Wifi proplem
Simple fix dont live in the rural areas. At my house a have fiber to the premises cuz ive 30km from Brisbane
This video buffered 4 times on 240 quality. Rocky Mountains.
Wow here 9$/month for 25/6 mbps in Kolkata,India
Getting 90 mbps with 250 GB download and 250 GB upload for $20/month from my ISP in my rural home in India feels much better than rural America
In Syria, it is around 500 KB for the people who fortunate enough to have internet. I could not have watched this video if I was still living there. BTW, Stranger Things sucks. The worst series I have ever watched. Neither story nor good characters. Please, somebody tell me why everybody else seems to like it.
01:19 This correlation does not equal causation.\nYou're grasping at straws here.
Come to Australia, where they are forcing us to move to 'faster' internet, (trust me, it's not) otherwise they'll cut our already existing 'slow' internet and where we are rank 53 on the list of global average internet speeds. (The U.S is 9) http://www.speedtest.net/global-index
Although I agree with the sentiment of the message, it leaves off several details that are of extreme importance.\n\nFirst, Satellite Internet at Broadband Speeds is available to essentially all Americans today from multiple providers.  It is not a great tool for gaming but does meet the Broadband Requirement.  Thus, the first mistake is that the map shown is, in fact, a wireline map.  It does not include any form of wireless - including Satellite.\n\nSecond, there is an entire part of the story left off of the REA story.  That of the RUS - Rural US Telephone service.  Many of those same communities had started telephone service and under the REA the RUS was formed to help subsidize rural phone service.  There are around 1,100 local incumbent telephone companies in the US.  The big names (Verizon, AT&T, Frontier, Centurylink, Fairpoint) you probably have heard of.  But there are plenty of companies like TDS or East Otter Tail Telephone, or Copper Mountain Telephone in the US.\n\nThese small companies tend to have very good networks because they are subsidized by all of us.  If you see a charge for USF (Universal Service Fund), that is where that money goes to the tune of several $B per year.  Many of these companies are Co-Ops and are owned by the local town.  The biggest problem areas are rural properties of the large companies as they do not receive these subsidies.  They base their builds around their Return on Investment (ROI) and Rural Broadband falls behind Data Centers, Mobile Networking, Enterprise Fiber Optic Networks all the time.  They will simply never be built based on their value.\n\nThird, Wireless Internet (WISPs) exist and are good in some areas.  We are struggling with spectrum and line of sight issues and it is difficult get permits to build towers.  It can be a solution a bit, but most of the residential WISP connections that exist today do not meet the 25/3 definition of broadband.  It is not likely this is going to change soon.\n\nFinally, the solution hinted at existed in the Phone World that came about as part of the Telecom Act of 1934.  POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) was made a Universal Service.  That means that if you build a house, the telephone company must bring you a phone line.  Not might, not should, but must by law.  I worked on equipment that supported a cabin that had a 100 mile distance to the CO that served it.  That line was not cost effective, but that is why the subsidies exist (and are under the gun to be eliminated).  If we want Universal Broadband, then we need to legislate Universal Broadband.  It is the only way.
I refreshed the page at the start, I thought I was laging.
What's the point of giving rural areas faster internet? So they can get their brain washed by facebook fake news faster??
Why 1.3 billion Indians don't have decent internet?
I'm watching this video while having really slow internet and whole lot of buffers.... üò£
25/3?\nI'm just gonna run a speed test\nI got 12/1\nNailed it.
Good at home WI-FI and Amzazing Mobile Data you can even get download speeds of up to 1gb per seco nd with in home wifi but I think only from AT and T
Screw this! I live in a populous suburban city (Roseville, CA), and even we don't have affordable broadband!!!
I have 5m down, 1m up\n\nDo you wanna know where?\n\n...\n\nNo, I'm not from the U.S.A, I'm from Colombia. Yes, there is better Internet services available, but they are too expensive.
Vox, if you're going to do a story about internet in rural areas you need to mention the High Cost Program, a support mechanism of the Universal Service Fund (USF).  The high cost program is a $4.2 Billion fund that subsidizes Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) for providing telecommunication services in rural and high cost areas.  This is how people in the areas in this segment get their broadband services.  This is also the program, managed by the FCC, that is working to cut the broadband gap.  People need to be informed of this if they want to change the current status of broadband build-out in this country.
10mb/s is fine i lived with that because my router was sucky it is enough to watch videos and download stuff this is ridiculous
I get 119 Mbps per second download and 30 Mbps upload in the suburb of Kansas City
Eh, in Utah the internet is alright. It ain't super fast, and losing wifi is super easy but it ins't terrible.
meanwhile, in sweden..Fiber is the most normal here. 100 down and 50 up usually.
Funny how they put down 4G even though it seems to be be really popular in those poor rural areas.  Those Kenyans sure must be way wealthier than Americans are because of all that fast internet they've got, right?  Right???
I need sources for this video, because I live in one of those areas that you claim can not get 25mps download and I pay for 200 and my google speed test says I get about 150mps and about 30 up.......
Took em 5 minutes to get the the point their video's, bashing Trump.
I love the music.
I'm hearing internet is intrinsically good? Meh, difficult to get on that boat.
Superb channel.
my pc cant be broadband speed but my moms can why? my pc cant pick up signal ez
The video falls just short of talking about BPL: Broadband over power lines. Seems to me like an obvious and complimentary solution to balloons, drones, and/or the use of radio white spaces.
When I heard the noice I thought the nuclear bombs were launched
Upper Peninsula of Michigan gets very little internet üò¢üòû
I get 50mbs for 55 bucks a month
MY VIDEO HAD TO BUFFER DURING THIS AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Too bad they won't ever see this
believe it or not where i live i have a 2Mbps{250KBps} broadband connection
You are more successful thus you chose to live in a wealthier (broadband) area. The wifi doesn't determine you, you determine the wifi.
The graph showing germany having high speed mobile makes me sick. \nMy mobile connection at home is faster than my wired one, but they all use data packages, which are expensice, and its not reliable.\nJust give me fibre already.
28kbs download here, watching from school because the schools guest wifi is better than my own. thanks, cheap grandparents
Whats up with the Dakotas at 1:14? Anybody know why theres such a difference between those states and Nebraska?
AT&T has low signal all the time
I play my games on a WiFi mobile extension
Americans have got it good in terms of internet speed. Come to the land down under and you will see what slow internet is like
10 miles from London. 3mbps. Download speed. Get wrecked.
2.2 Mbps.One day it hopefully will be fixed.
I thought I had fast internet until i went to NY lol
Honestly, 4G speeds are enough for learning....it's the caps on data that's hurting. It just seems like Vox tries to politicize everything nowadays.
The funny thing is most of the areas that lack broadband are in red states where they support limited government candidates. Now they want the government to subsidize their internet infrastructure? You want me, who lives in a city where broadband is economically viable under the free market, to pay for your decision to live in the middle of nowhere where broadband isn't economically viable under the free market? I'm not saying that the government shouldn't do it; I'm just saying that it's hypocrisy.
200meg speeds I've got in the UK, haven't had slow speeds for well over a decade, ¬£30 a month
Tfw I can get gigabit in Canada with no data cap.
Why does Trump think this is a good idea?
Kenya and Greece are also a fraction of the size of the US
I'm from a nowhere small town in the north of the UK and I get 36mbit/sec with the option of upgrading to around 70mbit/sec. That is using Fibre to the Cabinet tech. No caps either, but I use VPN for watching shows lol.\n\nVirgin Media finished ripping up the pavements here a few months back and now offer Fibre to the Property and can offer up to circa 300mbit/sec, but their 'gamer edition' is a bit too pricy for now.  http://www.virginmedia.com/shop/broadband/vivid-gamer.html\n\n>Totally unlimited for unlimited downloads and streaming\n>Faster upload speeds (Up to 20Mbps), for sharing wins with friends and followers\n>No traffic management for non-stop online action\n>Ultrafast download speeds of up to 300Mbps
Rural CALIFORNIA, I get 300 kb/s, 50 kb/s up. It's agonizing.
Dear Vox, please stop calling the U.S.A. America and people from the U.S. Americans.
Didn‚Äôt mention the possible effect that 5G will have. Wireless tech is cheaper than wired infrastructure.
Please before you make comments about liberal blah blah blah. Just stop, this isn't a political issue. There are many countries around the world that have cheaper internet than we do that is faster. This is the modern era people, we need internet. Work is done online, school is done online, everyday things are done online. America needs to catch up, this is why we need to make utility within the coming 20 years or so.  Plus why would you hate the idea of it being a utility? Set a  current standard for 1080p since that is currently what is being widely used, then upgrade it to 4k usage. \n\nWe need to catch up. Too much greed in these monopoly ISPs
The government just needs to enforce that all building connections must be 500mbps fiber. That will get all ISPs moving fast to get that dark fiber up and running to each house and business across the country. They can't possibly squeeze that much speed out of copper. I'd like to see them try.
I would rather go without internet, even if it means dropping out of college and being stuck at a minimum wage job paying off the debt, than use Facebook's service and give them access to spy on everything I do in my life. The targeted ads are creepy enough as it is, and there's no doubt that Facebook will try to double dip on this, charging for the service while spying on its users so we're both the customer and the product. I don't need to have anything to hide, what if I run for office, and Facebook has pictures of me they took while getting dressed? If I refuse to add data privacy policies friendly to Facebook to my platform, they could threaten to sell them to my opponent, who would run attack ads saying Sean has weird birthmarks that might lead to skin cancer, could he die in office? Probably not, but I guarantee I won't, vote for the safe choice.
Is anyone else just sad about how much better speakers the three presidents before our current one were?
Compare that to Australian internet :)
Hahaha inner city Brisbane, Australia, 200 m from an exchange, I get 10 Mbps/1 Mbps if I'm lucky. Just checked and it was 2 MBps/0.3 Mbps.Australian internet sucks.
We live a little ways out and internet is barely an option. When we moved in our options were dial up (yes still a thing) or satellite. We ended up with satellite and paid ridiculous prices for very slow speeds and unreliable service. We have since canceled the service and simply live off our old unlimited mobile plan! No WiFi, but not paying through the nose for garbage. Our electric co-op is offering a FIBER service and it is awesome! Hope to see it out at our place very soon!
middle east has the fastest internet
Well my isp in greece say that my area \nWill have fiber optic\nSOONtm
No games for kids too!
Kids in africa couldve ate that broadband
While I think there should be a push to incorporate rural areas into the wider US broadband network, the reason it has failed is because of the mass movement of money and people into cities over the last generation. How many millennials move into those rural areas? Almost none - so no money flows in, no kids are raised in the area, and companies remain un-incentivized to expand and incorporate in an ever decreasing populated area.\nWant to link rural citizens into a better network (internet, roads, and healthcare)? Revitalize non-city occupations from farming and mining to subsidizing land purchases for small families and farms. Conversely, as population centers in the US expand and grow denser, it is easier to fund and support public transit, health care quality, and school systems. So, it's a priority call in the end.
I mean I hope countries 1-9% the size of USA would have better/faster coverage considering probably the biggest issue with this is the vast size of the USA makes it a lot harder... I mean maybe you could argue we don't divert enough money towards it but that could be said about a lot of things here.
Damn. I live in NYC and I want faster internet *cough* google fiber better come through. I have 200/30
literally first world problems
25Mbps is super fast enough!
me:sees title\n\nMe:WHY 24 MILLION AUSTRALIANS DONT HAVE WIFI\n\nHELP USSS
Because they're poor. /video
lmao @ nashville lmaoo @ Iowa
Meanwhile in Australia...
Ofcourse Trump cant do anything right.
0,4 Mbit/s Download...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you Germany
Another Trump hitpiece
100/10 - Sweden bby!
Enjoying  0.6 mbps  download& .3 Mbps  upload in India
5:04 DID VOX JUST SAY SOMETHING GOOD ABOUT TRUMP?
This video presents no support at all for its central argument.\nThe health, education, and financial differences are much more easily explained as a rural\urban difference than a fast internet\slow internet one. Faster internet will not make hospitals and schools closer for rural Americans.\nI absolutely agree every American needs affordable access to the internet, but 10Mb\s is much more than enough. \nHeck, 1Mb\s would be sufficient for streaming low-def video and education\banking purposes.
Proof that libertarians are wrong
10 mbs is perfectly fine for accessing government sites. This video is completely bs
Just waiting for the movement were sjw demand free internet
Internet should be a publicly operated utility, like water or electricity. Having said that, if your dumbass rural shithole county voted for trump, then Im glad you get to stay trapped in the 20th century. Just like you like it.
I'm betting people without internet are healthier than the rest of us.
All American internet... is not equal.\n\n*Vox logo appears*\n\nDamn right
The US is soooooo far behind it's laughable.
In the Philippines we only have           \n2mbps to 3 mbps internet not like other countries little faster but we still survive even if it is 2-3 mbps
One thing. Living in those rural areas EVERYTHING costs less. So internet being expensive is not that big of a deal. We pay 1300 for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment and a lot in taxes here in California so yeah...

You're right to worry Zoe, I've had fleece sheets before... never again! That being said, I'd still use the main sheet from the set as a minimalist duvet in the thick of winter! It looks good with a fur throw, but has to has cooler sheets underneath...!
SUCH AUTUMN VIBES üòçüòçüòç

I wish envy was here to say put your mouth up to the mic üòïüòé
Nothing about this interview was awkward üòÇüòÇ y‚Äôall are weird.
did Lee Daniels wipe his sweat as if he has a wig on.... watch it..
Lee Daniels is smashing that dude on the low
It's 2 minutes in and i feel like this video was going to be boring... I'm out
Why did Lee Daniel laugh like that when Charlemagne asked brishe what don't you do.. @11:39 this interview hella suspect
Man this a dry ass interview
Lee Daniels has an awful personality. You can see that he has many unresolved issues.
dope ass interview. Lee was cool to me
Lee is a classic narcissistic. And he's fucking the shit outta Hakeem
Charlamagne had me dying laughing at 47:56.  He's a straight up fool for real. lmao
What's up with the folding of the arms between the both of them üëÄ
Y u make those comments about black women being aids patients
The scene at 7:27 has me dying. Especially when he sips the water at the end. Idk, but something seems off with this interview.
Not watching empire no more that show going be like the show . the game
DAMN. Did Bry not want to be there or something? It is so weird and offfff to watch lol..
Lol So I'm convinced that if I see that gay flag in any other vids niggas sweeter then C&H suger!!!
The black community is everything but civilized, educated, or industrious people but yet they're a bunch of hard-working drug dealers, whining booty twerking ass thugs, who will never amount to anything but government assistance an mooching off of the next person, looking for handouts.The only thing that matters to blacks is guns, money, cars, and rap music
is Byshare high or he just woke up ?
This nigga super gay I'm out
lee stay strong and leave the haters in the dust
empire better have ratings through the fckin ROOF with all these commercials\non here today. üò©üò©üò©
Is this shit old bruh? Niggas acting like this season 1
Bryshere look like the donkey from shrek when i was looking at his teeth.
Oooh, Bayard Rustin! I remember there was a documentary on him called, The Other Brother. It was on cable LONG ago. He definitely deserves a widely released film. Yeees üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ
I love Lee Daniels, but this was the one of the hardest to watch interviews I've ever seen on the BC.  Lee's interview on the Marc Maron Podcast is really good.  Lord Bryshere should have been left at home.  I couldn't get through this mess, way too much effort to get through..
breakfast club, y'all FAKE... why you ain't tell Lee to stop cursing? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I am I the only one that thinks both Lee and Bryshere were high off something
That was a really, really great interview üôå
The look on Mr Lee face when yaz exposed saying he on a 360 deal LMAOOO!! 13:15
Niggas on the thumbnail look like two dragon ball z villains jus arriving to earth before the show goes off
Man Yazz if you don't get yo whisper song talking ass out of here!¬†¬†TALK...lol... Still watching Empire tonight :-)
This whole interview feels like i‚Äôm watching an episode of Law & Order SVU, and the child is so scared of his abuser,  he looks for approval before completing his sentences....  \n\nCharlemagne is the abusers attorney and Angela Yee & Envy are Stabler & Liv trying to catch this dude in a lie to book him....\n\nand the back glass is the 2 way interview room mirror where the captain and the child psychologist watch hoping they slip up in their story.. *Queue up dramatic music*
Interesting. Lee, quit playin'. You are definitely still gettin' high. And you have something sexual w/ Bryshere. Hell, any foo' can see it. Bryshere is so numb to it all (figuratively). It's best that you keep yo' shades on, Bryshere. Yo' eyes will say something that yo' mouth won't. Lee, I had no idea that you were on crack, powder and crystal. Again, interesting...
Say what y'all want about CTHG he is a star and culture mover,This nigga wild asked Lee Daniels to do For daüçÜChallenge man that's just Genius ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Let mr lee live people ..he is great he is changing peoples lives
i wish they wouldn't whisper i have my volume up and i can't hear well
Someone shud of asked yaaz how it felt f***ing his tv brothers real life wife üòÇ
I thought this interview would be a little more interesting...
They doin the nasty for sure
this interview LITERALLY put me to sleep while listening at work..omg get some energy guys
They really didn't know who Khandi Alexander or Bayard Rustin are!? üôÑüôÑ
Meh. When is POWER back on
Bru I been stop watching this show  fucc  Empire #power
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
it doesn't feel like they even wanna be there...way off!!
Why does everyone think that this interview was akward? I'm lost..
Loved the interview.  Lee Daniels is very real transparent.
Y'all need to start having practice interviews with some of the people before goig on air..This dude on here whispering sounding all weird and awkward..Then Charlagmne tellin him he sound weird on air is extra awkward..This whole interview was weird and awkward ..Hakeem got thrust into the spotlight extremely fast then come to an interview with shades on..seems like he is going to have a weird relationship with Lee Daniels and grow up on set ultimately creating an identity crisis.
I'm crying at the comments üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Y'all so ignorant! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
This interview is weird and I think Lee is messing with that young boy!
What's crazy is how people are here insisting that there is a homosexual relationship going on between the two just because Yaz's boss is a homosexual man. Smh... You guys are exposing your own perverted minds.  I work with gay people, they don't want you they have their own lives. They come to work and do their jobs just like anyone else.
Yall complain when a black director makes movies about slavery.. yall complain about white directors making movies about slavery.. yall complain that theres TOO MUCH movies about slavery and yall complain when theres not enough movies about slavery... CAN WE CHOOSE ONE THING TO BE UPSET ABOUT DAMN! \nAnd I felt like Bryshere had the loop of the teacup being stirred playing in his head this whole interview.. anyway much success to Lee
Something is off about this interview,, I'm catching gay vibes from Bryshers
I Enjoyed the interview I was not fond of Lee based on What Monique was saying bout him. But He seem Mad cool. But Ummm Yaaaaaz seem still young and impressionable..He hasnt truly found his voice as a Man alot of still kid like ways lacks confidence. Or maybe cuz Lee was there he felt he didnt matter. But I would hope Lee aint bothering that boy like some comments been saying. But Lord in this World who knows. SMDH.
Being gay is mental illness...it was listed in med journals
Charlemagne pretends like he is okay with gay people but you can tell he is uncomfortable.
Lee Daniels did hakeem hair b4 the interview
We watched this on a flat screen I look around and everybody in the living was frowning like they was about to throw up shit ain't natural
Very weird. .. I'm out !
He had Bryshere screaming oh big daddy all night long when he was blowing his back out..
I‚Äôm so use to seeing Hakeem so aggressive on the show it was weird watching him ok here he seems socially awkward
Well Big Daddy Lee call auntie Mo Mo and tell her how you really feel lols
I love The Breakfast Club but I can't watch this. Empire is garbage. LMAO!
Majority of the people commenting did not even watch the interview.
I've never seen BG so strange in interviews. What's going on between him and Lee? What when down before those cameras started rolling?
lee daniels aka lil sweet defies the laws of gravity...it's the sweet one!   hakeem  has already laid pipe lee to daniels it's obvious
Beyshere lying ass. He ain't get kicked out. I can tell by his phony ass story.
Lee was being honest.. but you can tell when he lies.. Nia Long, and Mo'Nique... those were lies.. you can tell by his actions.
Why is¬†Bryshere acting like that?! He's been on the breakfast club before snd he came with energy and a great personality. What happened? I hope Hollywood didn't get to his head
Bryshere just high y‚Äôall lol
i like freaking Charlemagne....lolo
Ackward AF
I love my kids He sound like Michael
I Pray someone is not using their hollywood powers to sexually extort and control this young man,,shame on you if so,, the vibe was very uncomfortable to watch!! Something is very wrong with this pair. Love you Bry
This interview was cringeworthy.  @ 22:48 bryshere caught hisself tho, he almost slipped up So the Miami trip where we fell.......  Both these niggas suspect af.
He got a potty mouth lol
The ending tho üòÇüòÇüòÇ
lee fuckn that lil boy!
https://youtu.be/qKXmawcTQbo
Mom kicked u out 4 wut that story sounds bogus 19 clean yo room rigggggggght
Boring ass interview
Awkward.
Bryshere calls Lee ‚ÄúBig Daddy‚Äù.
45:37 Charla's laugh floored me LOL
I apologize...good interview
Faggot lol
Lee Daniels seems obnoxious and he keeps interrupting ppl
Tight fade Bryshere! Dope!
Hope you're alright Hakeem !!!
Y is he hitting Charla ... omg
This seemed awkward. Mane speak up young nigga
these two dudes are HIIIIIIIIIIIIGH AS KITES

Finally I been waiting since the last movie didn't end that well
Please kill off Teresa I really hate her
So this is where Littlefinger went after he died.... 0:15
I have waiting for a long time for this and finally it's here!
Lol Newt such a savage ‚ÄùAnd I get shotgun‚Äù
I never clicked so fast in my life.
Wow,I was just waiting for it.Mazerunner has been my favourite after Avatar
How bout we talk about how they took out HALF the scorch trials?
I'M SO READY FOR THIS MOVIE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BOOK
YAY, I'M SO EXCITED! I've been waiting for this for too longg. :D I really enjoyed the second movie and it went above and beyond my expectations. I hope the third one impresses me just as much!
I'm so glad they didn't split this in two parts
No! gosh no! please, no! NOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n\n\n\nSo innacurate. I bet Dashner didn't even read the books.
I should've known Lord Baelish was behind all this.
Okay, I read the books about twice and I know this is bound to be inaccurate but I'm still PUMPED AF!
I'm sorry but there's just something about that girl's face that pisses me off every time I see it.
Finally, he got his legs working
These characters are so selfish. Saving themselves over humanity.
I know the second movie was so inaccurate but it was still good
I LOVE MAZE RUNNERS LEY ME SEE THIS LET ME SEE THISSSSSS
y'all gonna catch me in the cinema for this show. I'm here for Dylan O'Brien
Movies like this is why I stopped reading the books
That girl needs to go. Ugh can't stand her. Not the actress herself just the character
since when has the maze runner turned into bo3? 0:46
Dylan O'Brien is making bank
Whats Little Finger doing here? Didnt he get his throat sliced open?
The movie looks good but I do not know if I'm going to go and see the movies  xD
If i remember right that train stunt was what put Dylan O'Brien in the hospital, could be wrong though
this is going to be soooo bad. its just too different from the book
Now I can see how Dylan injured his leg in a car stunt!
The other movies were terrible, the books were so much better.
thsi isntn one of those fake ones is it
Who else read the books?
I'M SO READY,I AM WAITING FOR THIS MY WHOLE LIFE\n\nRemmembers Newt\n\nOh I AM SO NOT READY,SOMEONE HELP!!!!
I have been waiting so long. Still kinda have to wait long, but i wish it didn't take so long lol
OMFG I thought Maze runner fans were extinct looks like 4.5 million just showed up üòÇ
Nooo dang it just from this trailer it's already 78% inaccurate  D:
THERE IS NO CURE!!!
Anybody want a Kill Order Movie?
Prepares to get ready\nRemembers page 250 \nGoes in corner,cries,mentally prepares himself
I can't wait for this movie ü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô
0:58 You really think he's crying over shooting Ava Paige or his he crying over shooting... someone else?
SUUPER HAPPY¬†ITS NOT SPLIT INTO 2 PARTS
Is this even maze runner anymore???
None of this scenes happened in the book :D
*This is going to be aMAZEing*
I saw every part I am so excited
I had this trailer and the trailer for the new Tomb Raider movie loading at the same time and they both started playing, but I didn't really realize it because they both start with someone running and breathing heavily while dramatic music plays. Like every trailer ever.
Come on.. this is gonna be completely different to the books.. the 2nd movie was different enough.. though it doesn't look too bad I wish they would stick to the original.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
I‚Äôm curious how this one is going to play out considering the screen writers of the last one didn‚Äôt even bother to read the source material.
Been waiting for this a looong time and this is what I get..... disappointed

Okay, this is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay off track from the book. It is its own thing now. Good luck with that XD
There is no maze anymore
I didn't read the books so my opinion won't have that big an impact but I feel as if it is drifting from the uniqueness that the first one had,  and even the second one was pushing it. It's a no from me
this trailers more fast and the furious then fast and the furious
I'm fan girling so much right now and I just sent the link to all my friends. I read all the maze runner books as well. The books are amazing and so are the movies. üòä

WTF is this!!! ... come on Noel stick to some awesome ROCK N ROLL .... Too many years in London ... come back to Manchester and learn your roots and where you came from!!!
HOLY SH***************T!!!!!!! I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME!!!!! SO THE NEW ALBUM CAME TRUE!!!!!!! THANK YOU FOR SUCH GREAT MUSIC!!!!!!!! IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT YOU RELEASE NEW ALBUM, I CAN'T WAIT FOR IT!!!!!!
It this Noel Gallagher HFB Feat Brandon Flowers? Bc at 1:20 the voice sound like Brandon. lol
sounds different.. looking forward to it..sounds like a rock/electronica mix.....hints of primal scream..
Any idea when the first single will be on the radio?
Love Noel Gallagher, but that sounded absolutely terrible.
The Gallaghers went full pop.

Liam vs Noel
ÎìúÎîîÏñ¥ ÏπòÌîÑÍªòÏÑú Ïï®Î≤îÏùÑ ÎÇ¥Ïã†Îã§!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is mega!!! It sounds even better than last two great albums and it's fuckin unique
When you dropping a single or two
1:00-1:05 sounds like All I Can Think About Is You by Coldplay....
Been hanging around with Damon too much rkid
Sounds like a really bad Super Furry Animals cover band.
Good Christ! noel's had a fucking relapse
I'm not overly impressed but I could never click dislike on anything done by NG. üëéüèª
SOMEBODY HAS BEEN ON THE LSD TABS!!!
started off a bit cotton eye joe then went tame impala echo bunnymen jesus mary chain
0:58 is giving me psychedelic Eleanor Rigby/I am the walrus vibes
Name of the first song, please???
I guess this is what happens when you start hanging out with Damon Albarn.
good sounding spacey tunes, Noel's back-up vocals are good.  Can't wait to hear the final cuts with Liam's awesome lead vox!
Hope that fucking alarm clock doesn't make it on to the record.
gonna have to pull 1 out the bag \nto beat Liams For What its worth
sounds like blonde, u2,chemical brother's, etc,Original? sounds like a dance band with noel singing, could he sing it live?
This is fucking amazing.\n\nIs this the chemical brothers back in with noel again??
Where is the single?!
Holy shit Noel, these sound good so far!
Being a huge fucking oasis fan, this won‚Äôt even compare to his previous albums. If the album follows this theme, could be a disappointment. However it could be a Piece of genius, we are yet to find out
Really dig where Noel's taken his music! Oasis was the paradigm shift in my taste in music, it's what made it improve haha..and things haven't been the same since. Can't wait to see you live in NYC!!
The Chief has returned,cannot wait for this to be released.\n\nAs to who built the moon...it was Keith Richards. He made everything.
YEAH-ah! I always wanted this Bloody fucking good day-!
Tremendo! Parece que va a tener mucha psychodelia y post punk. Hay mucho de The Charlatans, Happy Mondays, New Order. Genial le tengo fe
finally leaving his safe place and I love it.
Ok. Stop the world. We need Liam and Noel together again! We need ROCK again!
Omg I didn't like that I am gutted üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Kinda tired of Liam big mouth... He was more inspired years ago to say brilliant stupid things... but now Liam words are (most of the time) just stupid or frustrated words... this man seems unhappy and angry (to go solo?)\nLiam 2 songs in music videos just do not convinced me musically\nNoel is just another beast... he deserve all my attention... this trailer sound a little bit like psychedelic dance rock... sound really really promising & ambitious
Sounds like a Fifa song
First 30 seconds sounds like U2 'Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me' intro, live version
Pretty bad compared to the other albums hope the rest of the song are golden
potato is on heavy drugs apparently
stop wtih psichidelic, come back to rockanroll, u re not made 4 this bro, it sounds disco pop
Stoked as hell, just don't make it too long man
I only pressed the like button to spite Liam.
sounds like something to take acid to
Who Built the Moon? Peter Hook, by the sound of it.
As you were potato x
Think it sounds really promising, glad he is finally pushing the boundaries a little!
Twice ive watched this with headphones  and twice i looked up thinking a plane was about to bomb us üòÖ.. searching the sky an everything ... took me a few seconds to realise it was the first 30 seconds of this vid ü§î thick \n\nSounds great !
it's gonna be something!
If I need an Alarm clock, I'll buy me one. Super annoying that noise in the background. Not for me, thank you!
Yeah, I liked Noel's first two albums and I love Oasis, but I'm not digging this. It's probably just clips of different songs, but I'm not digging this so far, I'm enjoying Liam's new stuff more.
Oh dear me.
m.o.r. pap, sad
I came from the Liam Gallagher - Greedy Soul Live At Air Studios song and now i'm listening this and shit... both are fucking amazing :O
Fucking class. Fresh air. I couldn't bare another Lock All the Doors, You know We Can't Go Back, type album.. Love both of his first 2, but glad he's changing it up. This is gonna come with harsh criticism, people fear change, but people would criticise him for being too repetitive if he stuck to the same old formula. What I hear here is Noel Gallagher. Liam can stick to singing songs written FOR him in the style of Oasis; Noel is moving on up!¬° He's worked on this for some time and grafted for it so fuck anyone who says that he's bringing it out like a month after Liam to take the spotlight away. Write better fucking songs then if it's that easy to take the spotlight away with an album you claim to be shit after hearing 2 minutes, 30 seconds preview.
I WILL BE UPLOADING THE LYRICS OF THE COMPLETE ALBUM - SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL AND DO NOT LOSE IT
Great to see Noel is developing new styles and continuing to push the boundaries. I'm sure there will still be some classic Noel masterpieces on there too! Can't wait!!!
This is a result of what happens when you hang out with Bono for too long.. FFS ..
Cannot wait!
Potato vs goat
Biblical?
Can I downlaod now?
Psychedelic as fuck! Pink Floyd influence?
Esa tipograf√≠a como de Bob Esponja tho
NOEL GODLLAGHER IS BACK
EVERYBODY JUST FUCKING CALM DOWN
Fookin shite. Who built these tunes???
GENIAAAAAAAAAAL !!!!!! \nGREAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üëè
Dublin may 2018...see ya there!!!
Fucking amazing üòçüòç
Sounds like trippy Madchester
Sounds Immense!
Think you need Liam Noel!!
Definitely Mediocre.
HOOOLLLYYYY FOOK IT TURNIN INTO COLDPLAY!!!!
Sounding a bit like U2üò¨
love you
Prefiro o Liam,o noel √© pop √°goraüí©
Pinche Liam ni las manos va a meter !!! Qu√© culo Noel te hubieras esperado 6 meses m√≠nimo
Quien destruy√≥ el rock and roll?
God forbid an artist tries to explore something new, or do you want that same old song again and again every single time.
I'm a huge fan of Noel, but this sounds terrible.  Is this a 70s dance pop record!?  An admirable but mistaken attempt.
Fuckenell this is some Coldplay shit at best the mans sold his soul to the devil
I‚Äôve not doubt this will be classic Noel but I‚Äôm looking forward to Liams more. Lyrically its as if Noel wrote Liams and Liams wrote this: \n\nWe got to get ourselves together. x10
I built the Moon!
Just got a feeling it's gonna be one of those annoying albums after a while üòÇ
I hope amorphous androgynous sue the shit out of Noel for this
To be quite honest with you Noel, I'd wish nobody buy your solo's career albums, first of all 'cos they're $hi%, sound like a big pile of $hi% and second 'cos if ppl still buy those album there will be no oasis reunion at all 'cos you don't really need any money nowaydays aren't ya. I like a few songs from your solo career but not as much I do like the entire oasis discography. Music taste is subjetive, you don't give a ##uck what ppl think... as long as they buy your music of course =)
Shite
You've to get your music together  LGs stuff pissing over it atm .
Well done NG. A change is good. I don‚Äôt understand why people want him to keep churning out middle of the road shite.
Very promising. He needed something different after all these years, this sounds great.
U2 Zooropa with Hooky on Bass..................\n\nOh & guess what......Paul Wellers on it too...........Fuckin Surprise, Surprise Eh????\n\nNoel Gallagher????.................As you Fuckin Weren't.................
This sounds wrong.
Klopp after listen you never walk alone. Oh my goddddd. ‚ù§
such an emotional video.. thank you very much.. love it so much...
I was smiling and I didn't even know
So Beautiful!!!  Warms my heart to see such kindness!
9YNWA6
fair play Jurgen lad, fucking boss
Kill it before it lays eggs
Made me tear. Tq make a wish
Respect from Manchester United fan
I'm not a Liverpool fan who is gini that people are commenting about
Well done Mr Klopp and Liverpool. Good luck this season from a Millwall man.
Loyd is probably the real incarnation of the spirit of this club. so devoted, and never giving up!
I'm a United fan but this is really heartwarming. Massive respect to Klopp for making eye contact with Lloyd when answering questions. He showed genuine interest in the questions and in Lloyd. This is what football is all about, lads.
That Gini bit brought a tear to my eye
You have no heart if you dislike this
Now I hope all the idiots that haven't got Klopps back get behind a genuine manager who cares. He will end our drought but, you can't undo 27 years in 2 years
I love make a wish just because they give 'disabled people' {sorry i dont know another  word} a lovely oppertunity to meet someone or to  go somewhere.
Now I don't get emotional over videos but I have to say I nearly started to cry.Fair play to make a wish and to Lloyd for going through all of that and still standing tall
Wijnaldum might be by favourite player now. What a man.
Brought a tear to my eye. Makes me put life into perspective.
is this our new centre back?
I love what kindness Klopp, Solanke, and Gini gave to him, this is a great treasure in life. This has really made my day, #YNWA
How could someone watch that and dislike!!! Also new found love for Gini that smile and embrace üëå
Arsenal fan here, just wanna say what an absolute geezer Klopp is! Much respect.
Absolutely amazing love this so much he is an inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
what a great lad c:
Im an arsenal fan but that is great of jurgen to do this!
God I love Gini so much
i smiled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor all the wrong reasons
I love Jurgen klopp, he is just so humble and nice\n\n- Chelsea fan
Wow! great and very touching video. It made me cry,  this is why I love Liverpool fc so much. Love the vid. Liverpool fc supporter here from the Philippines.
People visit the support channel offline, happy everyone happy day
Makes me happy to see people get a wish no matter how small the wish it's just amazing to see
Enough of the charm offensive, Klopp is a dreadful manager, top 4 perhaps and no cups.  We dream HIGHER.
Klopp is so nice
I am a man in Thailand. I love Liverpool because of this.
Lovely young lad and very kind of Liverpool.
Class act from Klopp, this coming from a United fan.
Who the fuck disliked this video?
He brought smiles and onions with him.
United fan coming in! Klopp seems like an outstanding person. You are very lucky to have him as your manager.
This is just amazing !!
That was a  overwhelming so nice doing things lika that  makes him happy and smiley  interact with him man makes me happy too üëçüòÄ
4:00 You`ll never walk alone kid <3 x
God praise loyd
lmfao Jurgen has such a infectious laugh xD
*J√ºrgen Klopp* üëèüëåüëç
Every time i was close to to a tear klopp would make me laugh.great video. Hope the club offered him tickets for a game.
He likes Salah for some reason ..? why didn't he choose Coutinho?
Who could dislike such a nice video
thumbs down to those who didnt smile after watching this......
Im a united fan but youtube bought me here ... fab video, great stuff from klopp, a very genuine hug from gini and what a brilliant charity
Loyd also had a wish that Liverpool could score more than one goal with 80 shots on target
This has genuinely warmed my heart! Can not believe that there are people out there who have disliked this video!!
Make my wish come through and stop wasting chances to score. Fucking head wreckers to watch
i wish klopp would have a shave and brush his teeth...
*Get that kid a free season ticket in the kop end this is the kind support we need in the stadium not the mumbling cunts*
I'm not crying. You're crying
People who disliked this video should honestly be ashamed of themselves üòîüòîüòî
J√ºrgen Klopp is genuinely the most amazing person and leader for Liverpool. He loves the club and should be backed 100%.
I was feeling really miserable today but this has really cheared me up and made me feel warm inside.
Ahhh, bought a tear to my eye üòä
make a wish great initiative
Love the way Klopp talks to him like he's a normal human! Some people feel they need to speak to disabled and mentally slower people like children which must be so patronising! Klopp spoke to this lad in the same time he speaks to everyone which is brilliant!
This kid is probably a better keeper than fucking loris precarious karius
This is what football is about respect. Klopp your a true gentleman. Well done to Liverpool F.C. #YNWA
I'm so sad for the kid when klop get the sack ü§ß
O my god when he sang YNWA that was amazing
I thought the Proclaimers were Hibs fans?
ŸÉŸÑŸàÿ® üòç‚ù§

When Gini hugged him:)

What a good lad Klopp...
Never sack Jurgen !!!
Beautiful, good man Klopp!
Awwwwwww just the best LOYD YNWA üëäüî•üí•

4:50 Hahahaha Blake the DUDEEEEEEEE
This is properly terryfying!
Get blake invited here
Excellent video
Incredible!!!
i cant even do a 2 foot gap
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE DJ THAT WAS PLAYING THAT DAY?!
Thought Blake brought his hair dryer
Metrics Blake..use metrics, its 21st century O_o\n(thumbs up for postedit adding conversion)
WOW!! Huge drops, and massive gaps!!   I watched the Hardline the other day, epic track!!!
Cmon blake you could pin those!!!  Make sure gmbn has good insurance for ya though b4 u hit it!  Lol
I think Blake is trying to copy Finn Iles hair..?
How many times did he say sweet spot
its insane they have berms right after the huge jumps!
I do 40ft gap jumps rather often. but these hardline jumps are not only long, they are technical, in the way that they boost the riders up, and the run in's are crazy rough
I stay Up to 3am Singapore Time Just To watch GMBN Videos When They Get Released
Would love to see Blake and The Don take on this mega-beast of a course! Problem is, could GMBN afford the insurance?!
I wanna see you ride it.
I want to see Blake riding THIS! :-D
c'mon we all want to see Blake clearing those obstacles...
incredible! \nthanks for the numbers. i know that most of the real life look of things is lost over film so hearing just how big the features are makes it just that much more crazy
I could listen to Blake saying trajectory all day.
It's by far the most gnarliest
Leogang DH course had longer jump in the bottom, until Remi Thirion heavily crashed
Dan Atherton. You are a nutter.
All the talk of sweets makes me hungry
Blake's hair is looking SICK!! You crack me up every video Blake, keep up the rad work. \n\nGAGA WHOOOSH!! üëå
I was wondering whether Blake ever tried the track himself. And if not would he ever see himself actually trying this?
Yeah you really need to get your tradektry right for that road jump.
This video is like the Wasp Factory.
You need courage to ride there.  Thanks for the video.
Can Blake ride this stuff.
I like the way he says here.
Where's the sweet spot üòÇ
Blake looks a bit like Charlie Hunnam in this video. That course is insane.
Wow, even bigger then I imagined!  Blake needs to hit that
please forgive my ignorance but what exactly is red bull hardline? is it like red bull rampage?
That's insane! I love videos like this
would be interesting to see how the WC tracks measure up to this beast...
You should have done this in LooseFest, where the jumps are +25 meters long :P
I went 45mph on my road bike, and when I became conscious of just how fast I was going, and really felt the way my bike was controlling, I felt my stomach drop and became hyperaware of everything.  To think that I would hit a 45ft gap after obtaining that kind of speed makes my knees shake just thinking about it.
Yeah! Was looking forward to this video from GMBN!
Gwin did not have an invite eh?
He said big 10 times, and he said huge 5 times
Is Blake gonna send it?
Wow you should do more like This it was very interesting to watch
a few extra feet could be added to the measurements to account for the arch of most of the jumps too
Do a video like this at Rampage!
40 MPH on an MTB. What the heck!? Insane.
Come give our edits a watch any constructive criticism would be really appreciated, want to hear what we can do to make our stuff better!!
Would any of you GMBN guys have the bottle to hit any of those features?
Excellent edit! And¬†thank you for the metric values!
*Rob Warner voice*WHAT 2 GMBN VIDEOS ARE ON TRENDING OH MY GOD
Bike vault photo in the making at 6:19, love it
wow... im humbled ... i dont think i could hit ANY of that!
Nope... Nope and more Nope.  The fact that so few riders even make final due to injury on the course shows how hard it is.   Anyone who gets down in one piece - especially given it was wet this year - is a bloody hero IMO.
And Adam Brayton rips a tear-off off his goggles mid-air into dirty ferns\n\nThat is even more impressive!
and this kids, is when you need math to know how far the landing is, simple pythagoras.... 5:10
Remember back in the day doing 8' drops and thinking we were champs! This is just mad!
Awe where was my shout out for making you a brew at the top?!!!
you need someone at rampage this year
Another great video. Now Blake should shred it!!!!!!!
#askgmbn I want to ride megavalance next year but I'm not sure if i should ride with flat or clipless pedals
Getting a ton of merch for Christmas
Blake, are you going to do a claudio caluori of the track in your next vid? lol
I really wanna see the bing bong shreds this trail.\nI know you capable doing this..
I love the concept of this video, it really shows how crazy big those fearures are
I thought this video was sick
Speed gun and tape measure at redbull rampage
#20 on trending how many more videos can you get on trending
Red Bull Hardline 2018 Blake?
Your R sound is coming along nicely, dude.\nLol, such a chiller, love this guy.
4:45 thank me later
This is trending ?
But could/would you ride it blake/scott/Neil ?
Hey Blake do you think you could survive it? Just curious
Did they skip that huge drop during race? I can't spot it in winner's POV video.
It's a very funny thing when you watching POV from this and it looks so easy... and then you looking at this pack of numbers... . Confusing :D
I love you so much, Taylor!!
Taylor  is so amazing
I was surprised that the music video wasn‚Äôt at the end of this one this time. But either way. I‚Äôm loving these bts videos! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Taylor is the greatest musical artist of this era!\n\nKaty is but a speck in her rearview mirror!
I thought for a second the girl on the thumbnail with a blue sweater was Lili Reinhart
so she is dissing jay z whos having a streaming company`?
Why is this video not available
First thing I looked at was how long the video went for, to see if the whole music video was at the end. üòÅ

That blonde lady wants some of 50 for sure..that body language and flushed face üò∑üò∑üò∑üò∑
anyone know what the 50 song playing in the beginning is?
Whoopi looks good
don't look in 50s eyes, he'll charm you
What's the name of that 50 cent song playin at the beginning?
What's the intro song called
...if I was the president by accident...\n\nSee, I'll ALWAYS believe Trump wasn't serious when he ran and he didn't think he'd get voted in (by electoral college).\n\nRepublicans f*cked up big time.
What song played when he came out?
This was a great segment with 50 and the ladies!
What the song called
why don't you talk to a veteran's family that lost a loved one and see what they think oh and what these guys put out is not music it is noise just like listening to to lady's cluck cluck cluck shut up already who cares about any of you and your opinion good luck I don't think after seeing this pilot show you will make it
Curtis James Jackson III is super amazing.. He's such a charismatic man! Sweat suits, hoodie, two piece with shoes, braces, No braces.. Yo, this brother is fine! Always the best to him and his family! Whoopi, go head mama!!
i like 50 but he probaly loves trump.. cant say it
What song is that
haterssss
Come on, Sunny!  What was the point of your question about Power, other than spoiling a major plot point from the finale?  That was a really dumb question that was super unnecessary.  I understand that the season ended a couple weeks ago, but there is a way to ask a question like that without naming the character or at least ask something interesting like how will that impact the characters and have you already starting working on the scripts for next season instead of asking if your going to bring the character back from the dead.  You're smarter than that girl!
Trump is Not anything by accident, he's a DEPLOYABLE by chose he was put in the WH with Vladimer Putin help NOT by accident ! Putin knew what he was doing and so did TRUMP! He was grinning from ear to hear all the time, he knew he didn't have a chance, toward the end you could see when he changed I guess he got word his buddy was going to help. He really started bullying folks in the public square, lying about Hilary Clinton, ripping her hard worked, hard earned lifetime reputation to bits with Putin's help! I hope it's provened what he's done with Putin's help and he's chased off the face of this Earth! Putin will continue to be Putin but there should NOT be room for Vladimer Putin or his partner in CRIME DONALD JUNE TRUMP in The USA!
I wonder how the ladies would react to this man, if they had him on their show:  https://youtu.be/4i-6u_ZCKSY
@the view. You should have Brandon Tatum on your show... maybe get some common sense on your show. Whoopi i have always liked you...sister act and Ghost two of my favourite movies growing up but its sad to see how you are selling out our race. Democrats only care about black people to get our vote. The states that have the worst crime rates among blacks are Democratic states...Obama made things 10 times worse. You pushing the liberal agenda is not helping your community at all...trying to destroy trump is only destabilizing our country and driving everyone farther apart
Will he teach his son to IGNORE entirely the verb to be and mis-conjugate almost every word in the English language? He gonna do that?
i wonder if the white lady husband be hatin on guest like 50 cent
50 cent still looks the same after these years
50 cent was one of all time best rappers. from the 00s. one of my favorites.
Blondie wants that BBC.  Peep the body language üëÄ üç´ üçÜ her panties filled with lust üí¶üí¶ #forbiddenfruit
Does anybody know what kind of training watch Sarah has on?
What song is at the beginning?
did you catch the shade from Whoopi,..........you hear that ABC
why are you and other MSM outlets NOT reporting on this      https://youtu.be/FEbtrlYQuzk
why did   the fat  one  wearing  the  blue   assume  he has  couple  of kids he  only  has  1
What's name of song he walk out on
You are more likely to be killed by aspirin then cops. Just saying. What a waste of energy
what's the song playing when he's coming out?
Those are not dreads , there just really tight Shirley temple curls!
Am I the only one who realized that they did not talk about 50's other son/children?
Anyone know the name of this song?
Anyone know the name of the intro strong for 50?
I swear 50 ain't no fly guy.  But when he puts on clothes------
If you ask someone what their opinion in on a subject let them answer before pushing your own pathetic narrative lady. You're clearly one of those people who aren't accepting of other peoples view points.
Hi F!
gross
**Curtis RATSON!!!**
50 üòç
U Made It My Man......LOL
Addicted to POWER!! what a fucking good serie!! Well done!!
HEY WHOOPI I HEARD A GREAT MINISTER FROM MOBILE ALABAMA CALL HIM #45...THAT WAY WE ALL CAN CALL HIM HOW WE FEEL ABOUT HIM ..AFTER 45 COMES 46üëäüëäüëä
This got me thinking: Are there things that I don‚Äôt like about America? Yes. Quite a few, in fact. Violence against the unborn, the highest violent crime rate in the industrialized world, sordid social agendas, the destruction of the family, high taxes and a creeping socialism are all high on my list. With these things in mind, perhaps I should take a knee, too? Maybe you have your own list of things you don‚Äôt like about America. Shall we all kneel and stick it to the man, as they say?No.The national anthem is about unity, not division. Think on the words. They tell of a perilous night through which a battle raged. Our nation was on the brink of extinction. When dawn finally came, the sun shone brightly on our tattered flag, giving proof to the fact that we had, indeed, survived as a nation. The story appeals to our better selves by reminding us that we are a people who unite and persevere through troubled times.By contrast, not only does Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs decision to kneel during the national anthem do nothing to advance the cause he advocates, it further divides an already deeply divided nation by unnecessarily offending and alienating people who are in no way guilty of the offenses he decries.
what was the song he came out to
It's Fiddy!
does any know what song he walked out too
Name of the song at the beginin'
does anyone think that 50 looks like Matt Damon?
50 cent would make a good/better President....
According to her career, Whoopi is the BUM.
If Trump is so sensitive about the Flag:\n\n--Why does Trump not show his tax returns of he is so devoted to the flag and America?  I mean he loves the flag and the country that deeply,  why not be open with the American public like all former Presidents did.\n\n--Why did Trump insult so many people under the American Flag, including veterans? \n\n--Why are so many in the Trump cabinet associated with Russia, if he loves the Flag and the country that much?\n\n--Why did Trump defend the KKK and neo-Nazi who he called  very fine people, while  they killed a woman and attacked clergies, the folks who defended the confederacy (traitors to America) and the confederacy flag (a flag appose to the American flag)? Yet, at the same time he was outraged about Anti Fascists (abolitionists). And he doubled down on them!\n\n--Why is Trump so concerned with a entertainment game?  And not with the 900.000 false arrested black lives that were made between 2007 and 2015 by NYPD? Or the 50% of exonerated black lives, because of false incarceration? Or the almost 90% of clearances of black lives in FBI stats? \n\nAll this happens under the American Flag. \n\n--Why is he not as concerned with the 3 million Americans at Puerto Rico who are without water and electricity, but instead spends his weekend tweeting about athletes who exercise their right???
No doubt.
I love 50. xoxo
Lol. Dumb.
Niggas
Making those forehead gains
White Woman Love 50
Whoopi 'it's not rape rape' goldburg

Where's Ja?
Love whoopi from iran
https://youtu.be/TKZ2N8Hj-2c
This is such a stupid protest i swear to God what is wrong with you people?
He didn't really say anything poignant abt the kneelingüôÑ what a waste of a platformüòí
Trump is WEALTHIER then any of you will ever be, and The Worst President will ALWAYS be OBAMA the trader you all voted for JUST BECAUSE HE IS BLACK!!
You liberals we gotta get rid of him lol üòÇ stupid
This group has no Idea what the American flag stands for.\n www.youtube.com/edit?video_referrer=watch&video_id=fDDESRkAQlo
The Hollywood left, The MSM, College millennials, The NFL, ANTIFA, BLM, and the 65 million who voted for Hillary are echo chambers of themselves. They are heading down a path of self-destruction that they are too blind to see. If given good sound advice they just laugh in mockery. Their minds are too far deluded.
So we're just gonna ignore the fact that 50 has publicly denouced his other son?
I think we should get rid of poopie Goldberg and 0 cents.
Ask an ape a serious question, and you get an ape level answer.
I got here from watching NFL anthem protesters . Fuk these feminist hos especial the racist red head .
Just goes to show you, you can be a billionaire and a president and YET still be a big fat BUM!
So now the view has only one view....they call the President a bum....but we couldn't even mention anything about Obama.....that would have been racist, but when a black woman says things like Wooppie does it OK and not racist.....really ?
Well here is a Great Look at FEMINISM, all of these rich women that hate and cant keep a man.
That black guy is dumber than a box of rocks...50 cent isnt very bright either.
he worried about peaceful protest, celebrity apprentice is real without camera
Did you know there are 1.8 billion Muslims in the world! Now that's a lot of pubey beards and crusty sandals!
you mean he is reproducing!   God help us!
The bum. in chief,  sounds great,lol
The players that take a knee shouldn't be played - the NFL ratings have gone down - over 700 black people were killed last year by other black people however only 16 unarmed black people were killed by cops
50 shouldn't be talking bout father hood when he not a father to his oldest
This guy can't talk without smiling.
Fuk you View ,i was in the Vietnam war and lost 2 Brothers, to the war , so leave the FLAG LONE
The view sucks. So do it's followers. You're all retards.
Wait a minute,why they blocked out the conversation about Raina???
50 cent has definitely lost his street cred!  Can't believe he's on this show with these moaning, whiny hags.
What an absolute wanker
Did she say Bum in chief?
50 aint got no eyebrows
One ugly dude. Close your mouth
50 Cent has shot people before but never killed anyone. He was one of the biggest drug King Pins in Queens, NY at the age of 19 and had the whole hood where he‚Äôs from working for him.  And this is who black people look up to for 'fatherhood'.
Having Respect in this country is so important. This is so disrespectful to the families that had their father's and mothers killed in the line of duty. If you do not like American. You have options to leave. If you ever traveled to another country. We are so blessed to have what we have. Spend time in another country and look around and see. Thank you for reading!
Why l dont like blacks
I'm a bit disappointed, he seemed bashful and out of place. I wanted to hear more from him. I wanted to hear him speak on serious issues, to know how intellectual he is...or isn't. I already know of his degree in pettiness and attacking trolls and other celebs on social media. Intellect is very attractive, not looks and smell good alone.

3:24 omggg the artic monkeysssüíóüíóahhhh!!
Hey, Tom, you know what really gets numbers on YouTube? Videos about financial minutiae. (Prof. Rouwenhorst is spectacularly overqualified for this interview; he's one of the world's leading experts on finance and financial history, and I'm really grateful he was able to take the time to talk about the original bond!)
Guilders already was obsolete currency. So isnt that mean this bond was already void???...
What...default the debt...dude they only pay like ‚Ç¨11 a year....geez
Tom, you have the funnest videos
Are you still in debt for to your old hairdresser? That might explain why your sporting a hairstyle from the 90s!
I know one debt that still keeps paying. \n\nColonialism.
I am disappointed Tom Scott neglected to explicitly mention a pregnant point: governments that control their own currency can inflate their way out of debt. That is not financial minutia. It is a power that many in governments in Lisbon, Madrid, Dublin, and Athens likely miss dearly.
another channel that has a percentage of the followers it should have...
This just reminds me of Brady Haran's ridiculous ¬£2 house payment.
Ahh, I love stuff like this! I've never watched a Tom Scott video and found it boring! Just wish there were more!
Why didn't I know you were coming to Yale! I go to school here!
You just didn't bother with trying to pronounce it correctly, did you?
So my dutch tax money goes partially to yale...\nHmmmm.... not to fond of that
It's very bizarre really, youd think the water board would buy the bond themselves and in effect nullify it. Whilst ‚Ç¨13 euros isn't a lot, it's still taxpayers money, bare in mind the arrangements for preparing and paying invoices often outstrip the debts themselves - sometimes as much as ‚Ç¨50. In this instance it's $1000s of dollars on plane flights and hospitality at the other end.. And if yale are paying that themselves, doesn't it do the paying students a discredit?
If youve got a social security or personal pin number, your born into the debt of your country.
But hang in dint these get adjusted for inflation aswell?
Awesome. What a piece of history!
1‚Ç¨ per month? That ain't too shabby for the money needed to build that dike thing!\nHypothetical scenario: Water authority says screw this, I want to keep my 12‚Ç¨. Yale (like he said, against all odds), sues them for the 12‚Ç¨ of interest.\nThey get laughed out of court.\n\nNos respice ad futurum.
‚Ç¨11 a year?? Might as well stick that up your arse.
Wish house loans were like this.  You'd have more generations of families living in the same home..
Me and my student loans
also, did you know that people from phoenix are called phoenicians?
Sadly, had the bond been cashed in coin, the coins would be worth orders of magnitude more than the inflated paper you would get today.
3:20 but isn't suing someone america's favourite pastime?
Tom Scott, fab video really enjoyed it.
Did the Prof say what the history premium on the bond is?
What was the interest payment value when it was issued?  1000 Euro equivalent?  367 years.  Now that's mind-blowing.
Does the Yale university have Yale locks ?
Keeping the books straight and accounts up to date. That's how I like it.
I wonder how long until they give up on that lettering system (aaaaaaa, bbbbbbb, ...) and just switch to spreadsheet-style lettering (fa, fb, ..., ga, ..., ).
Damn that's something I might not have known, cool.
Talk about a raw deal.
In only 500 years, someone might find the United States national debt interesting.
I thought this was Edd China's channel.
This is the sort of stuff i like to see trending on YouTube.
Britain has been sending a bill to the U.S. every year since 1773 for the tea that we threw into the harbor. Every year we disregard it and don‚Äôt pay it off
It may be the epitome of boredom to watch paint dry, but perhaps it would be less boring if it were drying for over 350 years.
Ok can we do this with national debt but forever?
Tom, you are close to 1,000,000 subscribers. With videos like this, you deserve every single one. Well done, Tom. Keep the great videos coming.
These are the things I'd be willing to pay for. That's just funny.
Dutch water authority goes to the bank We need a loan Have you taken out any loans in the past Well let me tell you a story...
I saw the 12th of January and thought ooh my birthday time to click üòÇ.
hey guys does anybody knows what is the video where tom talks about trumps winning elections (he said something about talking the elephant in the room i think)
If I saw Tom I would hug him so hardly <3
Will they cash in the bond?
All the old timers talk about inflation this, inflation that:  back in my day a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread cost me 5 cents So why did this bearer bond/perpetual bond never rise according to inflation?
When are they next paying. I wanna go. Let's have a party.
Yale has never had a problem propagating fraudulent legal contracts. It's the only way the truly useless in our society can feel as if they are contributing.
Why didn't they pay it all off ages ago, surely it's a lot more expensive to keep paying interest off forever?
The name is bond, James bond.
I love videos like this
I was expecting the bond to be worth millions üòÇ
Why was the interest payment lowered? Was it by the payer or the payee who decided that?
Is it still possible to trick someone into signing a perpetual bond?
While in New Haven, I hope you were able to take advantage of timing to learn about the City's green.  I sent you an email on it a while back.  Intriguing ownership and management of a public space. - and a neat place for a park bench episode.
Idk who this guy is but he looks like Jenna marbles on the thumbnail
plot twist. they pay interest for a Jew Banker
Is this guy 30 or 60 I'm not sure
Does anyone reckon Tom Scott is obsessed with himself? Just go onto his YouTube channel page and count how many times you can see his face. Its actually quite disturbing.
I counted the singular or plural version of the word 'bond' 21 times in 3 minutes and 57 seconds.
Why won't the US government define that this paper doesn't have relevance anymore and the debt is considered paid already?
Next week on can't pay? We'll take it away!...
hehehe lovely... i used to swim and ride bike around that area
Haven't watched this yet: Is this Brittain's debt incurred through Mr. Blunt's South Sea Company?
Imagine if the Darian loans needed to be paid back with interest?
I feel like I just had a stroke and lost my ability to understand what's being said. Confusing video.
But can it be hacked?
Things like this are not as funny as you might imagine - they provide legal example and precedent for much more odious debt all over the world via US Trade Agreements, and Harvard are leading cheerleaders this nasty endeavor.
What's the part that says w w w w x x x x?
I was worried, until he said the bond pays $13 per year.\nThen it is just goodwill thing.\nThank You for sharing.
No Thames bond but there is a British consol (perpetual bond) that was issued to pay for war expenses during WWI and also some from the South Sea Bubble of 1720 that still pay regular interest. They are often mentioned in finance classes as they are a special case of present value calculations. When I was at MSU in the 1970's one of my Finance professors had a French Consol that had been issued to help Napoleon pay for his wars. Not sure if it was still paying interest or not.
Very smile worthy history
Top quality Tom Scott.
Student loan joke! Ha! I'm orignal!
This is why in the Abrahamic religion God forbade interest because it is an evil practice. The Jews came changed that all around and now it so wide spread in all its evil corrupt glory.
So it's a kind of pond bond?
Hahahah Why is the so awesome?
Ma name-a jeb
Amazing!!
(((juice)))
Awesome!! Can someone provide a link to the Water Board that is the issuer of the bond? I can't seem to find it on Google Search.
How to spot a Dutch person: they pronounce full as fool
That's pretty cool, i wonder who owns the bonds to all of America's debts..
This is really neat but its a bit of a waste honestly but neat non the less
They did default by devaluing the currency. Wasn't the currency backed by gold or silver? How much should the payments be today?
Hey Tom
Cool
Did he say lecduck beuvendams?
People are awesome!
Trump's wall?

Makes no financial sense to continue it really. Consign to history.
Miss that squad bad. Specially Cech Drogba and Lampard.
Drogba is a G he is one of the best Chelsea players to ever live
Damn the highlights still give me goose bumps. Even rewatching the semis, how we were one man down, how ramires chipped Valdez, how torres scored, how depsite all odds against us the seemingly blackhorse chelsea made it to munich and damn, this game sure was one to remember. Thankyou chelsea fc, Thankyou King Drogba.
He deserves everything that's good on earth.
Why has he not got a statue outside the bridge
NO WONDER WE HAVE LEGENDS LIKE YOU PETER, FRANK. LOL WHEN I THINK OF MAN SHITTYS LEGENDS  :)
no you're not the bad guy Kind DD.. we always love you and you will always be our legend
The best day of my life ... i love you chelsea and drogba thank you
I love how he looks so focused drawing stickmen üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Like for the penalty technique, Genius!
Chelsea's journey to the final wasn't an entertaining one I must admit but I remember celebrating Drogba's goal with my friend who's a chelsea fan. The reason for celebrating was the fact that Bayern knocked my team ( Manchester United ) out and it was the only consolation for me LOL!!! #DrogbaLegend
We love you big pete <3
didier drogba aka god what a moment i was 14 years old watching it with my dad and when drogba scored the penalty my father started crying ill never forget that moment in my whole life
Wow! This just shows how intelligent Frank Lampard is when Drogba spoke about the equalizer,  he says how he was scared when Frank was in front of him and it was a perfect ball for him, most footballers would have probably gone for the ball/glory yet Frank knew the big Dog had the greatness to score that magnificent header and left it. No wonder these two were so telepathic :)
At 1st i thought Drogba has hidden talent in drawing. Pftttt... Lmao
stay up all night to see the result \ni couldnt stop crying when chelsea beat munich \nnot only this game before we reach the final every moment was magical to me we were losing and we mange to win at the end \nfootball is fuckin unbelievable
Didier, I will love you till I die, my absolute favorite footballer of all time.
Drogbaaaaaaa.....Its a goal of destiny.
Legend!!! Really miss him at Chelsea
Amazing...its great to remember that moment
How can you remember so vividly?
Still brings a tear to my eye
Drogba my Hero until now You Gave me the greatest Bliss day ever in my life
This bring tears the thought of this moment and then the penalty best ever Chelsea forward will always be seen as a legend Didier ‚ù§Ô∏è
Draw the 2008 final next üòä
That was a moment when I was starting to cry. A tears of happiness after The Blues finally claim their 1st UCL Trophy. #GoBluesArmy
3-1 down to Napoli in the R16 first leg.... to eventual CHAMPIONS!!!!! It was written in the stars for us that season.
Tears are rolling down my eyes whenever I see champions league 11/12 nostalgia.
One thing we also tend to forget is that if we drogba doesn't concede the penalty, ribery doesn't come off injured, and olic probably doesn't take the 4th penalty
hey drogba ur my  best striker ,as a striker  y u werent wear no 9 jersie
and i'm still get goosebumps, Everytime i watch video about final UCL 2012...
Who's cutting onions over here?\nThe best day of my life. üíô
I will forever be grateful for what I've felt in that day. Till today I still feel the affects of it and I'm thankful to that entire squad of Chelsea legends. And king Drogba thank you, much love, respect and profound gratitude for being who you're. Not only a great footballer but even a better human being, a fighter and loyal to the end.
In India, the final started at 12:30 am, me and my brother sneekingly turned on the TV started watching the game! My brother was real Madrid fan and we both were supporting chelsea and hoped for an underdog win. Muller goal and we thought it won't even go till extra time but drogba's header was so magical that we both screamed and yeah we got a nice scolding but it was really special and we watched the whole game and slept at 4 am.
We need a statue of King Drogba oustside the Bridge
Drogba! the good old days....\nCome on Chelsea! salute you from M√©xico.
A night all us Chelsea fans will not forget !
That was so beautiful... Amaazing!!! Amazing!!!
The moment still makes my eyes moist!
Absolutely respect drogbas words for Cech both heros on the night legends always.
Every time i saw this , i cried out , because of this moment i came to know that football is a not just a game 22 players playing for one destiny , actually they are repersenting trillions of fan like me ! Every player who played for chelsea or playing for chelsea is the legend Always !!thank you DD, And big man PC
The first time I ever cried with happiness over a football match...

Best header ever. That look on Drogba's face after the penalty as he runs in victory. I get teary eyed every time. Thank you Didier. Legend. KTBFFH

DROOOOOOOOOOGBBAAAAAAAAAAAA i miss ya mate, there will no one like you ever again to wear the Chelsea blue with pride \nAs watching you made me a fan of Chelsea Footbal CLub.
Big Pete won it for Chelsea that day.
I remember that didier penalty, when it went it I just went mental and I screamed WE WON!!!!!!!! Ps his drawing is ten times better than mine
I was not looking at Robbens Penalty i hear my Dad screaming YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES and it was at that moment that i knew we were gonna be Europes Champions!!! #ComeOnYouBlues
THANKS DROGBA, THANKS CECH , THANKS ALL THE BLUES¬† BEST MEMORY OF MY LIFE
If Samsung is still sponsor, I think the drawing tools would be changed to Note 8.
This is the best drawn I've ever seen! So much respect for Petr Cech, you're trully a Blue Legend, Drogba!
I was the only one getting goosebumps?
Didier that goal of yours in champions league means a lot to me not only as a Chelsea fan but as a man who truly realized that everything is indeed possible with hard work, dedication and faith!!!
I actually cried while remembering this
I have to admit, I still get a bit teary eyed thinking about that.

*THUMBS UP IF THE WATER MOMENT HAS YOU SHOOKETH!!!* üò±üåè‚ú®
I honestly am so blessed with my brows lol They are SOOOOO thick üòÇ
Would you try the Luna Highlighters üòû
What brush do you use for your eyebrows normally?
My auntie has this and I tried it and it worked
I tried this producs a few months ago. It works much better for me when i put it on my actual hairs, like a browgel
A friend of mine has this product and when she showed me I was shook! So when you weren't convinced in the beginning I was like oh you just wait honeyüòπ‚ù§
Niki has never been so proud of a productüòÇüòçüëå
Thank you for having music playing in the background. I know it's kind of a weird thing to be happy about. I feel more comfortable and pay attention better when a makeup video has that. It makes the video less dull in my opinion. I wish everyone did that. So thank you!!
you look really pretty with just brows on  <3
My eyebrows are non existent, i need this product in my life! Is the eraser the only thing that will get the wunderbrow off?
Can u please do Halloween makeup tutorials x
I need this!!! I always sweat my eyebrows off üò¢üí¶
I‚Äôve used it all summer, diving ,swimming, on the yacht days and nights! It was 40C plus for 2 months straight and I only applied once a week or lessüò≠üôà It is really a perfect brow product if you don‚Äôt want to get microblading done xx
SushigushiushimushiüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Girl...your lips
I see your lashes, Nikkie!!!
Loving those reactions of yours @nikkietutorials
I love the WUNDERBROW2, Nikkie. Life-changing... such a confidence booster. It does have a little learning curve but once you get familiar with it, you can actually make it look more natural. It doesn't smudge, doesn't move, it stays where you put it. So lovely! You have to work fast(er) because it dries easily and it wipes itself off once you go back, but you'll get better at it each time. LOVE IT. At night I take my make-up off with oil first - so this comes off as well - but it is so worth it. It stays put all-day-long, rain or shine!!! Excellent for the beach and/or if you want no other make-up, just to frame your face while at home. I even get compliments now on my brows, never have I ever gotten any. I have the Blond one and use it very gently (soft colour indeed) with a guide. Superb! Haven't used anything else, since I ordered this. The fact that you can trust it, is priceless. xxx
What lipgloss is that? I'm in love!!
I was waiting on a review for this
She's gonna cry after this
perfect brow in less than two mins...that no üòÇüòÇüòã
Hi so I'm new to makeup and I was wondering if you could a video about what to have in your make up bag. Or like the necessary brushes and palettes one should always have when doing makeup. Thanks in advance!!
can you do the eye look you did for the fenty review i know it's so simple but i want to know exactly how you did it !!‚ù§Ô∏è
YASS girl but about the brush you ended up using? Inquiring minds want to know!
if u don't want the dark one can i have it?
I seriously needed this in high school! Brows would always come off during sports üòÖ
I loved it when you spoke German üòÖ wundersch√∂n üòç
hiii dear im new subscriber  your channel....im watching your videos and i love it....you are awesome....like a doll im big fan of yours...love youüëç‚ù§üòä
I feel like this product was meant to be used in a way to feign natural brow hair and draw short strokes as if you are drawing on individual hair rather than outlining and filling the area in like with a powder product
I've been staring at your lipgloss!
Your top üòçüòçüòç where is that from omg *heavy breathing*
I haaaaaated this product, I was so so disappointed because I was expecting it to be amazing
I‚Äôve been using this for a year and I CANNOT LIVE without this!!! It‚Äôs magical üòç
I want to see u use it after a day.. üò≠üíßüíßüíßüíß
girl, that top is beautiful! or dress.. either way, i'm obsessed!
Makeupby_alo make me love this product
I'm shooketh to the core üò±
Loved the video on the brows !! You are so animated üòÇüòÇ
I play soccer and do wrestling, I use Elf eyebrow gel and like the powder duo, I swear and while my face and they literally stay on
I love how many times she went back in to remove because she couldn‚Äôt believe it üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
what brush do you use to apply highlighter?
this really freaked me out because my mom sells the wunderbrow on HSN and i showed her this video today and right when i showed her this you went on hsn selling your lip and highlighter products!!!!
she literally DRENCHED that spray on herüòÇüòÇ
üòâ Amazing! I need this for my full and sparse brows!
I want to know how you remove the product üòÇüôà
This product is from iceland!‚ò∫Ô∏è
Hunney Hunney Hunney. WHAT IS ON YOUR LIPS. I need that
I just discovered this a few weeks ago and without being dramatic it's changed my life!
I always spray a little hairspray on a finger and dab it in my brows after I fill them in or draw them in. You can swim sweat and be active
Can You Do Tarte first impressions
bruh your piercings are killing me they are bomb af
wundersch√∂n :D its amazing to be german
You should do a challenge where you put your make up on and dont blend it at all
Where was this product during high school in P.E.      üòÇüòÇ
I'm seriously hating you right now girl! AHHH I've struggled with no brows for so long with the same fears as you! Now I am convinced that it's definitely worth trying and I wanted to hate it Lmao! I love your videos bt dubs you're fantabulous!!! üòòüòò
What you mean?! You have excellent brows. They are very blonde (I know that struggle) but they are really well shaped and you can definitely see them. I love your natural brows, and I'm crazy impressed when you do your brows!
OMG! You're seriously the best!!! I've been using this product for a while now, but the first time I ever used it I felt almost exactly like you... Only you said it better! lol
This is the first video I ever watched of you, and you are amazing üòÇüíú
I'm so happy you reviewed this!!! Im wondering if this is part of your make up routine now? As a brow gel ? or how you applied it here
I just watched this vidoe on speed 1.5 because I am on a time schedule but I still made time for you nikkie... watching your reactions on this speed made my day!!!
The only thing is I would have love if you zoomed in on the finished brows. Looks good on camera but brow products don't always look as good with a close up.
I own one of these and it sucks x.x
i use this stuff when i plan on spending the night over someone‚Äôs house. don‚Äôt wanna wake up browless üíÄ
That blows my mind how it didn't come off on your finger or the Q tip üò±
What a blessing
u make me cringe HARD
aids shot. 2nd time tonight that scatch puuk noise
Don't touch the brows!, omg same
Her face: *I AM SHOOKETH*
WHAT LIPGLOSS IS THIS NIKKIE????xxxx
OMG OMG OMG !!!!!!!!!!! I need it xxxxxx ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±

‚Äúwhere was this during PE for high school??‚ÄùüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I love Nikkie so much! I died laughingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Any new youtuber wants to support each other ?
Girl. You HAVE TO BUY ReVitabrow. It's a serum and it works!!! I use it and have never seen longer darker brows on myself. This is not an ad--I just swear by this product. Dermstore carries it. Try it.
I like it lol üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I have been watching all your new videos ... since I've been sick
Now you can gym without your brows melting off if you're one of those girls haha, I've been there before but I grew back my brows so best decision of my life üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I over plucked my brows in high school and I regret it. I wax my own brows because I don't trust anyone especially I have thin brows.
lmao üòÇ that‚Äôs how i reacted with it said while is wet!!! i use it just define my eyebrows and use the gel ardell to finish it off
What brush are you using to apply the product?
Where can I get this
You need to use baby oil to scrape this product off your face
I love wonderbrow, been using it for almost a year.
Like if you are German üòÇüá©üá™
I love wunderbrow! You are safe girlfriend!! I went cliff diving with this and my brows didn't budge. It does take a bit of work to apply but it's definitely work it.
I use a brown shadow lol
But when you fucked up your touch up in a public bathroom and you have no makeup remover, then youre fucked
girl, depends pomade is atleast as good!
have you thought about microblading
Your nails üòç
Nickie : prrleshaa hmm\nMe : oohhh, understood!
loved your Wunder üòÇüíï
Do the maybelline Tattoo brow!!
You should get your own brow song 'Brow wow wow yippie yo yippie yeey'
üë∏ü§¥
wish you would be in canada this week with us man!! Miss you!! Killer footage as usual!
your videos make me want to quit my job and explore the world
Cinematogography is another level. Killing it, Ben. Ever since the Arctic vlogs, I always celebrate when you upload. üôåüèº\nThe subtitles on the boat though. üòÇüòÜ
Fantastic vlog Ben! Thanks for sharing this trip with us! Keep uploading!!!!! Cheers!!!!
Amazing photography, loved the intro, watched it as an outro too!
LIke before watch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sik intro, Ben! Keep em coming üëçüèº
probably my favourite vlog so far!! I can't wait for the Visual Vibes the quality of this trip's footage is just INCREDIBLE!
What‚Äôs the song at 13:40?
These vlogs are awesome, just a shame they are so spaced out
First minute was a visual vibe dude\nGreetings from Germany :)
Got my prints ‚ô•Ô∏è but wanted a tee shirt too!
You are fortunate you did not catch the grass on fire. Sometimes with that high grass gets into the exhaust system and starts a fire.
He always seems to have the best jams during car rides
might be time to update the youtube profile pic haha
Really wish Ben would daily vlogs again he was one of the best at it loved his contents and quite upsetting to say he‚Äôs gone from daily uploading to hardly ever uploading I‚Äôve been watching him since he was on around 150k subs and he would be well over a million subs already if he still daily vlogged
Lovely intro, good episode. Amazed by your work. PLZ HIRE ME.
You and Nicole are brother and sister goals!!
Love the subtitles. Honestly, if you keep up the snapchat or insta stores up, I think most fans will be content with those as vlogs!
that was so incredible Ben! Now all I want is to go on a roadtrip and explore the nature <3
Ha! I just got that same headlamp. Aren't all those settings confusing? Love the visuals in the beginning Ben.
4:45 Oh... that's a real place, I thought you were Joking! ... haha looks nice!
Awesome Ben! I'm a photographer living in Zimbabwe, check out my instagram! @harry.randell
i must say... i'm having a bit of a crush on cam.... ><\nwish the video was in 4k for the intro bit the visuals are SO BEAUTIFUL!
The wait is so worth it! So glad that you take your time to put these incredible images together. Great job on the colors. The croc in the beginning is a killer. :)
Best way for us to live that trip again.\nHow did you get passed the column of ants? Did you drive through it?
What was that animal at 00:50 ??
In Argentina when in 2009 they introduced the bus ticket machines / dispensers on buses, they would only accept coins so of course, the shortage of coins began. People would queue in banks to change notes / bills into coins to pay for the bus fare. Some banks would reach their quota of how many coins they would give out a day so you'd have to go to stands around the city to get change and in some of those places in order to get 10 one peso coins they would ask for 12 pesos or even more and many had no choice if they couldn't wait in banks for a 10 for 10 exchange.  Then in 2011 they brought in the SUBE card to pay for transport fares; you put money in your SUBE card and then pay your fare using that. \n\nIt's sad when some people take advantage like that because in my eyes it's the same as stealing and the people who suffer the most are those who are struggling in the first place because if you're loaded, you're probably carrying the cash on you so you can avoid being ripped off or you know a guy who knows a guy who can cut you a deal. \n\nWe have a saying Hecha la ley, hecha la trampa, meaning as soon as there's a law or a rule for something, someone is going to come up with a smart way to break it for their own profit. I think in English you say Every law has a loophole.
Thumbs up just because of flume
Dope shots in the intro! You are the best and I really want to visit Africa after I've seen your videos :D
be careful with parasites in african rivers, discovery channel made me paranoid with that. lol
I love Hyppo and you just get awesome shots of them. In my mind I am already thinking how to do a similar road trip than you guys!
Who else liked the video before even watching it?
utube should really promote such channels. Good stuff Ben! Keep em coming
What lens did you use for that intro? It was sick
Amazing visuals like always! Cheers Ben. Crazy to say but your T-shirt that I purchased from you I haven‚Äôt worn it once.
I‚Äôm from Zim! This vlog makes me miss it so much
Hey Ben, another great video! Was wondering how all these lodges in the middle of nowhere power themselves?
Please watch my videos i have no friends :(
I honestly don't know how you haven't reached 1 million subscribers, quality video as always ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
You're visiting my home Country ... You need to see Matopos National Park, about 50km outside Bulawayo
such good vibes bro!!! Your the best!
I would have been nervous on an overgrown road like that...  as w found out, it means people don't use that road.  Amazing that it actually did end up going somewhere!  Cool croc and hippo shots!
Looking forward to tomorrow's vlog. aka 3/4weeks. :) Keep up the amazing work Mr. Brown!
Beautiful and wonderful as always :)
Yohhhhhhhhh!!!! Ben this is incredible and I cannot wait for the Kenya film. It's going to be another level. Don't let people pressure you into editing the vlogs in their time. This is a special trip and the fact we can even see/be apart of it is special.
Hahaha the captions when the mic wasn‚Äòt plugged in xD I love your videos Ben, you‚Äôre the biggest inspiration for me! Made it to 640 Followers so far üí™üòä
This is what YouTube was made for. Not some crappy diss tracks or boring videos. Thx for being you Ben and always producing quality and beautiful content
Can we just get some appreciation for the depth of field in those first shots, sharp shooting B.B \nAwesome work üëåüèΩüëåüèΩ
Wow the quality of the footage is amazing!!!
Savage Pumba!!!  üî•üî•üî•
i feel bad those days and seeing that video made me feel peaceful for a bit thx
Great video Ben. Need a defender in my life
Great Vlog, beautiful footage. Cya everyone until next month. :):(
Rockin that old school music by KAASI from your old vlogs hehe. Great video as always Ben, cheers.
The Zim cash crisis isn't Mugabe's fault, at least not this time. He's too old to even function which is why his wife is running the country now and she's so much worse! She's the reason Zimbabwe's going through another cash crisis right now just like they did back in 2008.\n\nIn other news, This vlog is siiiiick! Man literally cannot wait for the Visual Vibes to drop!
Thanks for visiting where I come from
Karibu Kenya ‚òÄ cant wait for the visual vibes of the trip
classic KAASI song :) it reminds me of your old vlogs
Ben you're the OG! Love your work and cant wait to watch another visual vibes
When the visual vibes coming out
Nice one bro , cheers for showing our home Zim in a positive way.
Love the vibes on the intro and always love seeing you post a video. Just curious how behind are the vlogs right now? Because I know you aren't in Africa anymore. No biggy love the vids!
Hey Ben! I think there is way more potential for the `Kenia expedition` Pumba logo type of thing! I bet there¬¥s someone out there that can make you a animated intro, which in my opinion would fit the professionality of you videos in general better than just a fade/in fade/out logo. Please consider this if you wanted to use it in your Visual Vibes. Keep killing it :)
Can you please bring back your old outro's I miss not being told to work hard, be nice to people, and try not to get lost or killed.
I can't wait to watch 'tomorrow's vlog' whilst tucking into my Christmas dinner
Man one day I'll do something like this!!
Very very good video man keep going \nI love your channel sooo much üòçüòç
Got that Isaiah Rashad blasting. I see you!
Ben. I love your positive attitude, your amazing eye for photos, your badass editing skills, and the fact that you share bits of your life with us! Nicole is fantastic and Cam seems cool too. Watching your vlogs just feels good!
loved it!
Yes ben! the intro looks like a little visual vibes!
Whoop whoop whoop what I've been waiting for a vlog can not wait for the Visual vibes üòÄüíØüî•üëçüèø
Amazing intro. Can watch it over and over again, it‚Äôs hypnotizing.
This is amazing content Ben. I appreciate you sharing your vision to the world.
I love my country man! Hopefully things will change soon.
You really need to see the south of botswana in the deep kalahari instead of just going to maun and the north keep up the good vids anyway though ‚ö°Ô∏è
My home country!I miss it so much!Thank you for showing us the beauty of Africa!
So good to see you happy
Hope you guys had fun, Steve and Wendy are family friends. I know they really enjoyed having you guys there
Aww u didnt take picks of the kaffers...

Wow, my country is sooo beautiful. Cinematography is A1! üëåüèΩ
Beautiful intro
Yes, bro!
also those are monstrous ants dude.
Luv your stuff!
the focus and depth of field at the start is pure sex fml
The cash situation is not all that bad for the general people.  Illegal activity is conducted in cash.  The more the general population conducts its business electronically the better.
How much fuel does the Defender hold?
EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?........
I've been a Norm MacDonald fan for many years. Had the pleasure of seeing him live in the Tempe Improv. I suppose Adam Egret was working there back then.\n\nTim Allen has never once made me laugh.
What an enormously and profoundly stupid fellow (Tim Allen, that is)
One of your worst interviews Norm.
SHE WAS A HOOKAH!!
Bring back Otto and George.
All great comedy hosts have the laughing jack ass side kick \nAlthough they all don‚Äôt jerk off punks underneath the bridge like eget
Thank you, Norm, for having the great Tim Allen on your show. Very refreshing that you took a break from the progressive fruitcakes, transgender queens and bull dyke lesbians.
Gotta remember these guys like Tim Allen needed a lotta cash to keep up his homes, cars (and a hell-ova lot of em!) I mean who that was born say in the 1990's ever really heard of Tim?Example: In 25 whos ever going to really remember Sandler? And thats fuckin sad! Robin-Will, dying the way he did and a perfect example of what I'm tryin to say! Prob. couldn't perform or even go on stage without the drugs?? Don't really know but my fav of all time comedy/drama/ or dramedy; the f-in best out there in my opinion!
Amy Schumer steals her jokes and gets rich is that FAIR?
34:15 THE santa clause holy shit what a blast from the past
Too much joke analysis, brother. Just read em, like everyone else. Trust us...we get Norms humor.
Staring at 1:00:13 Adam Eget makes a joke that was three years in the making
Tim Allen looks like a 50 year old Dave Faustino
LOL, there's not a chance in hell Tim Allen was ever paying a 50% overall tax rate as a nightclub comic. He's funny but also a goddamn moron.
six-hundred and fifty grams of ideas
The only one that didn't laugh at the where do you get your ideas from Egret fuckface question.
Once in a while I catch Norm burping on the podcasts. Cracks me the fuck up! https://youtu.be/WYkil1tblt8?t=2780
finally a good one
Aw man, what happened to the super zoom independent French cinematographer?
What in all of hell has happened to Mr. Norm ? Please dear Lord bring back politically incorrect Norm  ! Please .
man i love every episode but the best are when jokes is the guest actually having fun.  or norm having fun.  this time was both.  great discussion and awesome end.\n\nalso laughed my ass off that tim answered where do you get your ideas and they skipped like 2 or 3 break attempts
Tim Allen:  Who is Adam Egert?  -  haha, truer words were never spoken
mate this¬†is a classic..............well done....
Tim is a J dude for sure...
So Hugh Hefner gets to hell, and the devil says to him:\nThere isn't much room for new people in hell, so you'll have to replace one of these three baddies as he gestures to three closed doors.\nThe devil then shows him through the doors one by one.  Behind the first door is Mao Zedong.  Hef notices that he is getting a hand job from a Playboy bunny.\nThat looks ok. says Hef.\nThe devil holds up a finger sharply. Not so fast, you haven't seen the other two.\nThey leave and go to the next door where they find Stalin who is getting a blow job from a completely new Playboy bunny.\nI like this one even better! he says.\nThe devil smirks and raises his hand in a just-hold-your-horses gesture.  They come to the third door and find inside Idi Amin pounding violently into a very cute Playboy bunny from behind.\nNo need to think this one over. Hef says. I'm going with door number three!\nVery good. says the devil, who claps his hands and loudly proclaims.  Playmate Vicky, you are released from hell.  We have your replacement.
Tim allen is in great shape, fair dinkum
Love Tim Allen and this episode, but In order for you to be an atheist there has to be a God is some pretty stupid logic.
You guys are brilliant, BUT...Sen. Joseph McCarthy had nothing to do with any\nhearings on Communism in Hollywood. His was a completely separate Senate\ninvestigation into Communist subversion of the State Department and the\nArmy in the 1950s.
Great interview & my first Norm Macdonald Live. Norm was great on SNL, especially with the Weekend update. I will be watching more interviews in the future.
This was a great episode. Tim Allen is a better guest than a lot of the others recently.
I'm so glad there's a joke segment!
It was interesting until the stupid fucking lame joke section.
Nice stories about Rodney. Made me realize how much I miss him.
54:48 Adam Egret is my hero..wonders never cease
Holy shit this guy can talk .
That atheist debate was painful. If someone like Richard Dawkins was there, he would've died laughing.
i love norm.. but who told him botox was a good idea...?  wow.  sooo   so weird.  brows are fixed and its quite strange.  poor guy
The Mr. Rogers story would have been badass
I want to hear that drunk carpenter joke. That's twice it's been burnt.
Tim Allen = worst joke reader of all time errrrr?????
Archie Bunker loved his daughter and wife and grew to care about his son-in-\nlaw. But the writers had him give his opinions about women, homosexuals, race,\netc., in a stupid way so we could laugh at it in a joke he wasn't in on.¬† He\nwasn't right about everything.¬† Someone tell Norm.\n¬† Why aren't I surprised Tim is a Trump supporter?\n¬† I've liked either for humor but judgment isn't their strong suit.
You can tell that Tim is a well season pot head and he smoked right before this interview. Hot off the press obv
Adams, where do you get your ideas from joke got taken seriously
easily the best episode since Sarah Silverman....
I LOVE Otto & George! I have the distinct pleasure of being the last comic to have opened for him in Kansas City just two months before he passed away, he never got the respect and notoriety he deserved. Also, John Belushi held the title for having the #1 movie, show and album at one time.
tim has listened to exactly zero norm macdonald shows
Its almost certainly been said before , but i hate Adam Eget.
It's telling how posters are only listing the essential services Government should concentrate on instead of the million other useless things it incurred a $20 trillion debt doing,
Man i haven't seen norm macdonald in a long time and he looks super freaking old now. Crazy.
The very first guest to fall for Adam's Where do you get your ideas from? question. Flagship moment for the show.
Great show!! :D only complaint is that Tim tried to normalize that fucking insane cult. made me puke a little. Moham-head was a vicious warlord & pedophile. #banIslam
Tim reminds me a lot of George Carlin  he seems to have the same mindset about the world around him ..........
why is Tim Allen yawning so much???
Norm, dude. Sober up, stop slurring your words (your diction is attrocious) and stop constantly interrupting the guest when they are in the middle of a sentence.
Love the show but get some sofas
Tim is a big hunk of man .
Bring back the makeup girl already!
tim allen went from selling cocaine to doing it
Alex Jones came up with fake news.
I still can`t believe he is dead!
Is everything Adam Eget does a bit or is he really a dildo?
I miss the old episodes. He used to interview and kinda troll his guests, which in return made some of the funniest and interesting episodes.
Adam Eget looks more and more like shit with each passing episode.
Finally, the show is funny again!!\n\nBut that atheist comment was the dumbest I heard in a long time.  Poor Tim Allen's daughter lol that one of the highest levels of cognitive dissonance I've seen in a long time. Lmao.... But good episode none the less. Glad norm came back with the funny. Seriousness really ain't his bag.
The discussion on atheism might well be the dumbest conversation ever had by human beings. Fucking hell, the ignorance on display here was dumbfounding.
They brought up coke so much
Does anyone know what Tim Allen meant when he kept saying ''wow, you do feel better'' every time Norm started doing the candy-man bit? It's also weird because when he first says it Norm says ''We aren't supposed to talk about that''. I think It's somewhere near the 50 minute mark.
Two comments from Tim about Norm feeling better. To what is that in reference?
H3 Podcast unintentionally brought me here
Caulk not Chaulk.
Go Wings!
Allen was/is an underrated standup
BASED TOOL MERCHANT.
Charlie Chaplin AKA Funny Hitler
cool podcast!
*slowly turns into a roast..
Tim ''the Candyman'' Taylor ...
The frisbee joke; genius.
24:56 from Super Dave
Does Norm have cancer?
Norm needs to interview Harland Williams
GALAXY QUEST 2!!!
There has to be a god for you not to believe in it.  What a dumb statement.  Obviously his daughter was referring to not believing in an existence of a god.  By Tim Allen's standpoint, there has to be flying spaghetti monsters too.
Conservatives can't be funny
Tim Allen is an unfunny scumbag. \nUnwatchable. just like the Tyson,Cho & Jenner episodes.\nThis season has been brutal. The days of Gilbert,Swardson & Super Dave now seem like a distant memory.
On October 2, 1978, Allen was arrested in Battle Creek International Airport for possession of over 1.43 lb of cocaine. He subsequently pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges and provided the names of other dealers in exchange for a sentence of three to seven years rather than a possible life imprisonment. He was paroled on June 12, 1981, after serving two years and four months in Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone in Sandstone, Minnesota. \nI mean this guy is a real jerk!
Tim Allen is dumber than I expected.
Crybaby wouldn't take a pay cut . Yet he made more than the other 190 employees combined salaries. \n\nHollywood Left or Right are all selfish shitbag hypocrites.
You can't say Jay Leno is the best joke teller in the world in front of Norm fucking Mcdondald, i don't care if you are mr. Candyman, you just can't.
157th in the country lol keep at it norm
Tim Allen can go F himself!!!
Great episode! I like Tim Allen's stand-up, though I've never really been a fan of his sitcoms. Still, the way ABC screwed him over was a shame. He and his crew deserved better treatment. And while I'm not an atheist, the refutations of atheism here are piss-poor, guys. Come on! If you're going to discuss a topic it's helpful to know a little about it first.
remember last season when this show was funny? Ahhh, the good ole‚Äô days.
This is the best episode since season 1, I think.
Tim Allen: You DO feel better!\nNorm: You're not supposed to mention that!\n\nWhat the hell does that mean??
Two washed up has beens babbling about Dangerfield, cocaine and religion for fucks sake.
Tim Allen made shit tv
Does Norm like Hitler, or does he find him to be a bit of a jerk?
Norm road that hey candy man joke a bit too long.
You are only *just now* making an effort to keep people from using Velcro as a generic word? Probably a little too late.
yeah good luck with that.  talk to Xerox
Hook and loop - 3 syllables\nVelcro - 2 syllables\n\nSorry, sticking with what's easier to say.
Funny video but I'm still gonna call it velcro lmfao
I didn't even know Velcro was an actual brand till now.
This video is clearly meant to be humorous and tongue-in-cheek. Nobody at Velcro thinks this video is going to change people's vocabulary.
I'm still going to call it Velcro. And if that makes you cry, grab a Kleenex.\n\nNow where did I put my Vaseline...?
It's funny I haven't seen Hoover make sarcastic youtube videos.
velcro sounds better
This is hilarious. I had to check to be sure, but I'll tell my customers we sell Velcro brand hook & loop. Or just Velcro for short.
The sneaker heads will be like\nAhhh he got the hook and loop\n\nSorry guys. Doesn't work.
lol this marketing is actually pretty good, it's just a hit or miss thing, next time just get a few bots to get that initial positive reaction so the community follows. or u know, hire me.\nanyway, peace.
How to backfire, John Oliver Style.

Get better at marketing then??
Apparently people on YouTube are very bad at recognizing joke videos and picking up on when messages are tongue-in-cheek. How can you watch this and think Velcro is doing it in earnest?!
I love VELCRO¬Æ Brand hook and loop.
Not sure why everyone is so butt hurt. This is a clever and creative video with a hilarious message. I dig it.
Not only will I continue to call it velcro, but this song has further persuaded me to purchase non Velcro branded velcro.
My Velcro didn't hold up now I have to get some Kleenex and Clorox to clean the spill and probably use some Germ X after.
I'm calling it velcro anyway just out of spite. That way, your trademark with dissipate as it becomes common name. Just like  all band aids are band aids, so now the brand has to call it band aid brand.
It's too late. Velcro is already common parlance for that type of fastener. Just like band-aid, and kleenex are common parlance now. Give it up. And no one cares if your trademark goes away.
this was actually fun
This is one of the best things I have seen all week. I will try very hard not to call it &*^!@# and share this to anyone who will watch it on ... that social media site.
No worries guys, nobody even heard of you in Poland, there won't be any infringement.
I wanna work there
Brilliant song, very catchy, well made point, very funny, and yet... it's still fucking velcro. The difference between Velcro (R) and velcro is the logo and the (R). If you didn't like it you shouldn't have waited 60 years to address the problem.
This is like trying to tell me Plato isn't a planet.
That's just glorious. Thanks for the link, Reddit.
I actually love this! and the song is so catchy!
Comments are full of idiots who don't understand satire.
Guts, it's obviously a joke, calm down
should call it ssrrcccctttccchhhh one word and its the sound it makes
Hook and loop? Nah, velcro.
overly expensive - generic velcro far more economical.
What if lawyers from companies all over just tried to get trademark laws changed to reflect the way that information spreads and adapts in a society with social media?\nThink it was bad before the internet?
I'm going to find some off-brand velcro, and just stick it to things. I may the Hoover up the mess, when that fails, i'll go Google the way to do it properly. We don't get to decide how the world uses words, stop being a cuck about it.
Whatever the hell they were trying to do with this video, they failed.  Also, this message is at least 30 years too late to change how people talk.  Probably more.
Redditor and legal enthusiast here (I once beat Phoenix Wright Ace Attourney). These lawyers are right, it's wrong to use VELCRO¬Æ as if it were a common word. Social Justice has taught me that cultural appropriation is very real and harms creators of that culture. Therefore, we are appropriating the company culture of Velcro Brand Companies when we use VELCRO¬Æ outside of its intended legal context. Please refrain from velcroing this video with your ignorance.\n~Bertie Gallagher, moderator of r/legaladvice and r/INTELLECTUALPROPERTY, IQ of 172
I suppose they want us to stop calling shirts with collars polos, referring to mopeds as vespas, and assuming all pregnancy pills are plan B also.
Internet and people's mind 101: I don't tell people what you don't want them to do. Cause it's gonna be worst
Do people actually call bleach products Clorox? I've not heard it personally as common for bleach. The others? Sure
Velcro shoes is using it as an adjective, not a noun or verb. Editorial my friends, editorial.
Honestly you should called yourselves Hook and Loop so that you won't have to worry about that stuff
Saying, velcro shoes places the word velcro as an adjective. It describes the type of shoes as a noun modifier.
It is and always will be velcro, no one would even know what I'm talking about if I said hook and loop get outta here.
I think I've just been velcroed...
from the same people who brought you the yo yo and the slinky
Ok so wtf is up with this INSANE 90s NOSTALGIA CRAZE and NO ONE has brought back blading or even talked about it? MAKE AMERICA SKATE AGAIN
Inb4 video is deleted.  \n\nThis company that makes velcro has goofed up.
Ok i got go now lemme get my velcro shoes and my velcro wallet and my velcro socks and my velcro car and my velcro jacket
Tell that to Hoover. :-)
Working as an aircraft mechanic, EVERYONE in the industry will call it Velcro, so it a WAY to late to change the naming
Okay okay I won't say it anymore!
Sorry, no one is ever going to call it hook and loop. Thats just reality
ok i wont, do I get a cookie
I found this hilarious lol\nUnsuccessful.... but still very funny
It is like Band-Aid too
0% chance of hook and loop taking off, but a damn catchy song nonetheless.
ok this was hilarious well done, from now on if i see it i'm saying  that fucking hook and loop
They are my velcro to the other velcro part....
lol why are so many people getting butthurt about this video. yall a bunch of virgins. thumbs up for pissin off reddit nerds.
kys
Can you guys just become a company that manufacturers music videos of interacial lawyers singing.
Velcro.
omg ha
Velcro\n\nTrademark (TM) 2017 Velcro R company.
velcro
Velcro right?
Velcro for president
Dang. Velcro Lawyers harmonizing something fierce at 1:44
Self-qualified lawyer here. I absolutely *adore* this video, for it reinforces the belief that we should protect the very best of our society, including multi-billion dollar corporations. It's sickening knowing that people are appropriating VELCRO¬Æ, knowing fully they are diminishing the real brand. As an upstanding Redditor, I'll upboat this video for visibility, so reap karma VELCRO¬Æ, you deserve it.
*Velcro.*
I'll stick to velcro..
Velcro.
VELCRO!
If you own or work for Velcro you are making bank. This is how corporations control you. Slowly and surely.
Maybe it would be cheaper to just give up the trademark.
No.
no
this is bad
justin mercado wasted the first comment, then edited it, then wasted second comment and edited that one too, then ten minutes later he came back and wasted third comment. Now I'm sitting here getting 5th when I should have 3rd.
And if you make a mess using Hook and loop remember to hoover it all up.
Marketing: We make bags, straps and bookends now. TIME FOR A REBRAND!
I just took time out from hoovering the inside of my JCB to google that. I was so distracted I walked straight into a dumpster, and  now I need a band-aid for the cut on my arm. I wiped some of it with a kleenex, and smeared some vaseline over it.
I didn't waste my time watching the whole vid , or reading all the comments, but didn't you 'lawyers' steal this song?
sorry but your annoying bleep filled song isnt going to work. Its Velcro. Deal with it.
I don't care. It's called velcro no matter who makes it, just like band aids, roller blades, kleenex and myriads of other things.\n\nI will not let some corporate stooge tell me what nouns I should be using.
for doing this dumb video,  I will always call it velcro and I hope you lose your trademark
This video gives exactly the reason why to call it velcro in the first place. Trademarks are stupid. Nobody wants to make lawyers richer. As soon as you have an idea and share it, it should belong to the people. Making money off of an idea is wrong
This video straight up made me cry for some reason. Like this is a hook and loop kicked in and I sobbed.
Generocide is a thing layers.
Velcro
Can I replaced all my nouns with VELCRO¬Æ?
This is amazing! More name brands need to be like this!
Hook and loop? Maybe if you had a shorter, catchier name for it we wouldn't have been calling it velcro to begin with. I'm not going to call it hook and loop.
I can't tell if this is supposed to be funny. But with so much going on in the world, and the local all-news station deeming this important enough to mention, all I can say is: Boo-Hoo! What problems we rich folks have to contend with.
I was with you until the censored swearing.  I would have shown my kids, so they could learn the right way, but you had to make it dirty.
Women now have bigger balls than men. lol what a time to be alive!
Much love. fuck the NFL. bring a team to San Diego!!!
I salute the LFL
awesomeness...
Oklahoma needs a team !!! We‚Äôll take 2 !!!!  Best hits this century!!
LFL about to get popular, fuck the NFL
I spent 8 years in the Navy. It was 19 hour days and no weekends ever for low pay. I served so people could enjoy the Republic in which we live. So people could buy or sell, come or go as they please. I didn't do it so people would be forced to stand and sing a song though. As a Veteran I support people's right to take a knee.
They act more like men than the pussy NFL players with their fe fees.  Thx LFL.  Subscribed.
You go girls! Love you.
America !  haters gona hate...
lfl is more american then the bull shit NFL
Good for you woman , unlike our crybaby men ! Ty
Thank you LFL
Nice. Good to know sports players will stand.
Well I'm switching to the LFL...and good for them. The women play a better, harder hitting game too !
You summed it up perfectly. Honestly, I never heard of LFL before seeing this video.\nYou ladies just gained a new fan.
I'd like to raise my flag across their nations.
Subbed.
Bless you LFL!
There's a time and place for protest, your workplace is not a great choice!
The people have the balls to stand for their own country, oh wait they don't have balls.
Why was i not told this exists !
THIS IS FUCKIN AWESOME.\nFuck the NFL, bunch of cry babies who made millions, some of them get 1 mill per game - , mostly blacks who can't stand the fact that Donald Trump is white and he's a Patriotic President. They  are used by Zionists, Liberals and all this is Pushed by mass media owned by Zionist Jews - CNN, ABC, NBC or ESPN.
LFL rocks!!! I'm buying tickets to watch the LFL!
What kind of butthurt liberal snowflakes downvote this vidya?
Well looks like I found my NFL replacement
The only ones that agree with this obvious racist I Stand bullshit are the ones proud of the murdeous heritage. If you took a second to read about the history of how America came to me, you‚Äôd understand how the flag doesnt mean the same for everyone. \nI find the flag completely offensive because I had to learn the history that was denied to me. So fuck you Trump, LFL, and any other stupid incompetent dumb piece of shit who refuses to acknowledge that white supremacy is the root of all things evil and why this country has flourished. WE built this country so YOU get the fuck out.
and yet somehow the dislikes are super high . I do not believe people actually dislike this stance the LFl is taking and trolls have infected the dislikes on this channel post .  People who support the flag of this country make sure to hit like to stop the losers who think it is cool to disrespect our nation and its symbols!  LFL football sounds like a gimmick but watch a game and you'll see more than just sexy women in pads ! This is really football and it's a pretty good football game  to watch and the women are beautiful on top of that .  They hope to reorganize my Green Bay Chill and I hope we get that team back on the field soon because with the NFL screwing us over Wisconsin is looking for another football team to back !
Bravo!!!
MLAR
I cant begin to describe how proud of the LFL for standing up FOR the Flag of this great Nation. Thank you so much!
Good 4 the women's league..a new fan !
I am NOW officially a fan of the LFL!!
You just improved your stock market value by double digits!  A CLASS ACT, for sure!
Please!!! Have games at the same times as the NFL!!
Subbed. NO MORE NFL.
lfl should be come America sport
Any LFL player, no matter how good or sexy, who refuses to salute the flag or national anthem should be banned.
LFL Rocks - The men from the NFL should be humbled by your patriotism and honor you give your nation. ¬†Thank you!
I live in Scottsdale Arizona and would definitely support an AZ team if they eventually have one.
They got bigger balls than the NFL pussies
I support you even more for this, but unfortunately their are a lot of Anti-American people, who think protesting the Flag that give's them the right to protest, will do something good, it won't, it will just destroy the county that gave them that right in the first place, and then they'll have nothing.
üöÄ
FOR AMERICA
Awesome thank you!
hey NFL take a look at your replacements! Ironic that these ladies have more cojones than the so called men of the NFL (No Fans Left)
LOVE this! Very well done LFL.
It's amazing how everyone is an American until they bare their right to freedom of speech then all of a sudden they are not Americans anymore. Nice.
I would rather watch LFL ANY DAY over nfl!
This makes me happy!
Muy linda presentaci√≥n de los equipos  son lo m√°ximo en el deporte.
TF LFL!!
‚ù§ dina
I guess I WILL be watching football...  Just not thr NFL.
I dont know if you are trying to gain more fans or something but this video is pointless.
Beautiful women!! Great video here!!üèàüëßüë±üë©üá∫üá∏
I can't wait until the police starts shooting black women, so when Adrian Purnell is shot we know the LFL won't give a fuck.
Only asshole democrats think the American flag only represents only white Americans. America is a country where any race can be successful because every race is a American. So many rich black men yet they think they are oppressed. Screw you anti American pro criminals democrats....
The anthem says One nation under God with liberty and justice for all. Its a good idea that America never applied into unbias action. You stand and place your right hand over your heart quickly for a peice of cloth, on a song about war. When was the last time you stood up and placed your hand there for God? THE GOVERNMENT'S OWN STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THAT ALL DO NOT GET LIBERTY AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT JUSTICE!!!\nIf you love your country, drop to one knee. Tell her I love you baby, but your wrong and work on getting her right. If you love America stop feeling love for a damn peice of cloth and feel the pain of AMERICANS around you!!!! The athletes are doing it for AMERICANS, and GOD! Would you place your hand over your heart for a LIE?
Statement of LFL supporting the protesting of the National anthem\nhttps://youtu.be/7AhJsVTgnq0
 >when women have bigger balls then men\nwhat a world we live in right now. 
WOW!!! A league of hot ass bitches more American, more Patriotic, and more Respectful than the pathetic, over-paid, premadona,  useless asshole NFL'rs. AWESOME.
It's just a flag stop making such a big deal over it
Are you ok?
Lingerie Football League is now the Legends Football League?  That's.....that's a bold name change.
To be honest I must be living in a bubble because I have never watched this football league here but I respect them so much more then I do the NFL players now. Thank you ladies for being tougher and more patriotic then these coward NFL players and owners.
HAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHHAH! What a fucking joke! I served our country, and I can tell you SOB's right now! I have not met one former soldier that thinks the NFL is disrespecting our flag nor the national anthem. I think this is more about a few Americans that had mothers that never breast fed them. Or if they were breast fed, their mother's titty milk was horrendously sour, thereby causing them to grow up to be a bunch of miserable bitches... Bastards... Whatever! HAHHAHH!  Or maybe some of you are simply a bunch of ignorant TRUMPHOLES! Either way, you sort of stink when it comes to being an American! btd
*Let's talk to them individually.  Anyone can edit/put a song over some old footage.*
Ok.....
this divide is getting out of hand.once again,people are kneeling not to protest against our troops but protesting b/c we are not upholding WHAT THEY FOUGHT AND DIED FOR!!!!!üòß How can we fight for nations to have democracy when EQUALITY and JUSTICE for all is clearly still a problem in our OWN nation.i will kneel because this is not what they died for when a cop can stop a 10 year old boy and shoot him in cold blood and get away with it.THINK. AMERICA.THINK.
Screw the N F Hell, I respect those who show respect. LFL > NFL
These ladies are true patriots.
Lol... what a joke.\n\nOf course they're standing... they're 97% White.\n\nDuh.
Thank you
Wow. Thanks bruh. This helped me in _so_ many ways. I‚Äôve _never_ watched a dark circle video like this one on YouTube before. Really. _Thanks_
A sink plunger works wonders doncha know.

Arsene Wenger reportedly interested in signing him
A beastly finish from Payet's big brother

I hate semi's. Especially when the car you drive is small in comparison. People who take on semi's on the free way are stupid.
Love your videos donut media <3 keep up the good work!
What happen to the movie of Gone in 60 seconds? The part go baby go??
On this episode of watch mojo...
That chase from Cobra is, easily, the most absurd car chase I've ever seen in a theater.  I mean, really.  Here's Stallone, in a wildly modded and totally sweet custom Mercury...with nitrous injection, a stonking motor, the whole shebang.  He can't catch a stock Dodge Aspen.  I mean, those guys are driving what you'd pick up at Alamo as a rental in 1985.  They outrun him.  I remember howling at the screen, as Stallone flails.   He struggles to keep up.  And then he crashes.  They escape.  In their Dodge Aspen. That's the chase.  Some action hero.  Cobra?  Hah.  More like...um...Slow-bra.
I think you should've added Dirty Harry - The Dead Pool. ¬†Awesome car chase with a remote control car that has a bomb in the streets of SF
The Blues Brothers, number 4?!?!?! Come on....
No Man's Land (1987) - Charlie Sheen and DB Sweeney are car thieves, more specifically Porsche thieves. The chase scene with the 911 Turbo and the rival car thieves is epic.
If you like old truck movies I suggest Maximum Overdrive or even better Duel
Good collections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evA3_NV7cPM
Great video! Mine has always been the chase in Cobra. I remember seeing it when I was about 10 and it was the greatest thing in the world! That Mercury is so bad ass!
Duel, it was made in 71 so I see it not making the list.¬† As far as car chase by sketchy semi, that's the whole movie.
great car scene from the movie Ronin!
Make a video on the S2000
You should do one for the 1990s 2000s 1970s and 1960s!
The Blues Brothers\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue's Clues
I was hoping to see Blues Brothers. This video did not disappoint.
I know how you feel with the semi truck thing. I'm not afraid of them personally but my girlfriend is TERRIFIED. Even when she's not in the car I still have to floor it past them out of havit
The Semi Truck thing?\n\nIt's not just a phobia, there are some serious physics involved with that kind of mass! \ncare must be taken driving around them! <3 all
now do top 10 from the 90s and 00s!
2:33 ‚Äúfavouritist ‚Äù isn‚Äôt a word
KNIGHT RIDER - like every episode with turbo boooooost?!
Good entries on the list. I got some others for you to check out. Take a look at the last Steve McQueen movie The Hunter. There is some good car stunts in there. Even a chase with farm equipment chasing a Trans Am. Also, even though the movies are not as liked as the first. Smokey and the Bandit part 2 and even 3 were 80s flicks with good car scenes.
Nice to see the Junkman getting some love!
That first clip features a Ferrari 308 GTS not 308 GT (no such thing). GTS in Ferrari terms refers to the Targa Top
The 80's must have been fucking epic
Lets see if you bastards can do 90
You also missed Smokey and the Bandit
My boss worked on the opening chase of mad Max 1
Ronin has an awesome car chase, I think that's 90s though?
Donut Media can you make a list of the top 10 American supercars?\nthank you
A dumb little fact, but the Santa Fe Diesel engine at 5:28 is actually still in service for the Big Trees and Pacific. And you can still see the Santa Fe livery  if you look hard enough. It also wears the same no. 2600 as it did in the film.
YOU CALLED THE MONACO A JALOPY? BLASPHEMY!!!!!
Smokey and the bandit but thats not 80s
so glad mad max made it on here
I came here basically to see The Blues Brothers on the list.\nI ended up with a couple another movies I should watch :P \nThanks! :D
Future hall of famer... The opening scene in Baby Driver.
very good countdown. on the other hand, the echo is distracting, you guys should really record the voiceover in a soundproof room.
Why not a Greatest car chase scenes of all time?
I'd be curious to see your list of the best chases from each decade. This formula works well since it's too hard to make a top 10 of all time list without EVERYONE's list being practically the same group of the most famous chases. They end up overlooking the lesser-known gems like some of the films in this video.
*Every battle from Initial-D with eurobeat intensifies*
Mad Max 2 is in my opinion the ultimate car guy movie, and also my favorite movie ever made.
4:35 Does he honestly think they were actually going over 100.
The whole time, I was thinking of Baby Driver...
What about the Chase from the opening scene of The Incredibles... I mean... it probably took place in the 80s...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJk .... it was probably the 90s
I think Beyond Thunderdome should have been included.  Cars, motorcycles, planes, a train, and a fucking hand cart.
Beverly Hills Cop. Hands fucking down... or the Blues Brothers. Anyone else is just a pussy
You guys should do Top 10 car chases from the 70's next and Smokey and the Bandit better be in there lol.
My favorite car chase from 1980's \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TF8z7h1lhQ
Glad to see 007 represented, but the car chase from For Your Eyes Only (with a Citreon 2CV) was also worthy of inclusion.
Are we going to get one for the 70s?
Movie cops are fucking stupid af
Very nice congrats
im a stunt driver m8
The general lee
do 90s movie chase, pls
Lol for real tho I stay as far as possible from semi-trucks. I either stay 5 car lengths behind them, get over to the opposite end of them or try to get in ahead of them. Idc if I miss my exit I'm staying away from them because of movies like the ones mentioned. Also Great video.
your mic has an echo or the room your in
Don't have a phobia of semi trucks per say, but I do have reoccurring dreams of getting t-boned by one while going through an intersection.
How many times he said Semi Truck ?
Everything should go back to strickly trains for shipping, get Semi's off the road
Interview: why do you want to be a stunt driver? Fearless Candidate: I got nothing to lose but my laifu...interviewer: you're hire!
As a bicycle rider, yes I have a phobia of semi trucks.
Where's The Wraith?
The chase from The Italian job
the movie Who Am I had a great chase including a Mitsubishi Evo. you forgot that one, it was one of the greatest chases in the movie.
i love Semi Trucks !
1970's Gone in 60 Seconds. (1974). Eleanor
The original gone in 60 seconds is the best
Where's Smokey and the bandit 2 with old Buford and his posse of Gaylord and Reggie in the desert... Classic !!
bullitt
the living daylights?
The Blues Bros. got robbed
0:56 that poor Plymouth Duster RIP
The wraith
Awesome list.
Semi trucks are scary
Bullshit how was blues brothers was better then cobra fuckwit bullshit video
What about the car chase in the james bond movie For your eyes only?
fuck semi trunks man i feel you homie
I cringed intensely when that big rig crushed that Duster
I like semi trucks
0:21 shoob
The Wraith, Charly Sheen and the Dodge Turbo Interceptor
awesome list!
1:13. Those are fruits!
Great list!
Please Up to speed: Subaru WRX
Hers 3 moves for you : Smoky and the bandit. Gone in 60 sec. Vanishing point. üòäüñí
Gone in 60 seconds!!!
Gone in 60 seconds.........i know its not from 80's but come on
I would have included CONVOY, and Steven Spielbergs DUEL, i mean cone on both of these films are basically a huge semi-truck chase
Ken Block would be an awesome stunt driver, don't you think!?
And where was Duel? That film was just a chase scene >.<
And the Bullit chase??? For Me... it's the best one
You guys forgot about Smokey and the bandit

If you don't upload I don't sleep or shower.
Hey ReviewBrah, I'm not sure if you will see my comment or not but do you think you would ever consider doing a live show? I know that's a strange question considering you do food reviews but I would totally pay to see that! well I hope you are well and thanks for another awesome video
Glad to be able to take a moment to sit down and watch review brah videos ! Thanks for uploading !
I can watch his videos all day. I absolutely love him; he's so freaking adorable!!
You should start doing workout videos and record your progress and maybe review different pre and post workout meals for optimal gainz. Thatd be a cool twist
Please review the McDonalds chicken tenders
I‚Äôm a Popeyes general manager at buffalo new York I feel weird watching this üòÇ
Yo I like this guy
Found this Gem of a Channel because of a Meme about St Patrick's Day Donuts on Facebook. Truly how reviews should be done.
will u ever return to end of the internet
Can I be your girlfriend?
I really want to see an hour long video in which you just talk about random stuff. Like a rambling video, because I just watched your 20 minute video about cups of water and I enjoyed the whole damn thing.
ReviewBrah is literally the sweetest and most humble person I've ever watched on YouTube! This wonderful young man doesn't deserve all the shit YouTube has given him and it breaks my heart that no matter how much he knows this affects him, he still wakes up, puts on those fly as hell suits & makes the most enjoyable videos for us to watch. My birthday in next month and I'm going to treat myself to this wonderful man's merch! Thank you ReviewBrah for making me and the rest of your followers so happyüíô
You da man.  Fuck Joey's World Tour.  You're bringing class to the game.
Only 10 minutes?! Church is suppose to be an hour long!
Greetings, TheReportOfTheWeek! I have a serious business inquiry, and it would be a blessing if you could respond when your very busy schedule allows it. I have typed out my proposition below.\n\nWhat type of porn do you please yourself to?
Review brah you should do a review on the Hostess limited edition snowball ice cream that just came out :)
Hey there ReviewBrah, glad to know your back in business. I was just wondering if the IPhone case on your website fits the IPhone 6? Thanks
Can we get a video of your tie collection please?
How the hell did this guy get 445k subscribers unbelievable!
ReviewBrah, are you okay? You look sort of tired.
Well damn I guess I'm spending $4 on lunch tomorrow
his hands remind me of Sid
Im waiting for someone to run up, slap the window and scream REVIEWBRAH at the top of their lungs
I watched this un-ironically and now I'm hungry
Does this guy ever remind any of ya'll of that one spongebob episode where spongebob attempts to become normal
Any chance you could start recording in 4K?
I bought 300$ headphones just so I could hear that crunch
Can you review the crispy buttermilk tenders at mcdonalds
You should throw a pool party upload when you get to 500k subs
when did god decide to live amongst us.
That suit of yours looks i bit over sized on the arms and shoulders, in my opinion
love you man. thanks for always being you. your reviews have gotten me through some rough days.
i thought i was lesbian but after watching reviewbrah for such a long time, i'm not sure anymore
I'll let you know what it tastes like......and...I am guessing Iguanadon? Popcorn Crocodile.
Wish I was also eating chicken  bites whilst watching this I'm so hungry
The silence is magical
I actually love this guy, I hope he becomes so famous
How is his face still so flawless when he eats fast food almost every week?
are there higher expectations of fast food in america? also it would be cool to see guest reviewers/passengers, cheers as always
I enjoy the constant chit chatter of your videos, I really do. But I must admit I find it quite awkward when it goes silent during the time you eat. Could you possibly think of something to do to cover this silence. An example of what you could do; shorten the time it takes for you to eat a certain Food item. Once again I love your videos.
I have no friends or life just give me likes for motivation
You should review KFC's Georgia Gold and Nashville Hot Chicken Little sandwiches.  It's the best way to enjoy both the Hot and Gold.
YouTube is garbage to me for taking your add revenue... Your reviews are the best ... Daymon Drops gets adds on his channel.. Why are you being singled out...? You da man, keep keeping on.. Much Peace
reviewbrah! Have you looked into the Hardee's 5$ All Star Box? Keep up the good work

I looked at the merchandise and it's very nice.  I may order something but unfortunately it'll  have to wait until nearer Christmas time.  Just can't do the cost now,  the shipping really is what makes it difficult.  Thanks for the 15% but unless you offer another in December, when I can afford it, I'll just pay full price.  I really love the look of the hoodies.  Anyway, good luck selling the mech and keep the videos coming.  Love you dude.
i love just how raw this guy is
why is it that when i watch the report of the week my first instinct to tell him what a handsome young man he is and that mama's proud
Review-suit looks very nervous in this video. He's always good but look how freaked out he is in this Popeyes neighborhood.
Oh there it is, you should try the buffalo!
Plot twist: what if he just stepped out of the car at the end
1/4?\nThere are 3 remaining parts to that review?
Your reviews are so professional its actually funny. The way you ate that chicken like some examiner, and kept a poker face before vocalising your thoughts and feelings about what you had just ate.
You need to come to Texas and review Whataburger!!!
I don't live in America, so I don't have a Popeyes anywhere near me. Hell, I don't even like watching review channels. I can't stop watching this guys' vids though, they're so damn interesting. Anyone else?
Bought some merch. Would have bought a phone case but I didn't see any fro Samsung phones.
somebody get this man a gucci sponsorship
l look forward to seeing you on a major news network one day keep striving ! podcast in the future ?

Christmas BLOWout.
Hi <3
We're not worthy(bows down.)
please review the McDonald's Buttermilk Crispy Tenders
I always smile when he roasts KFC lol.
For 1300 dollars it would seem Apple could have made a true genuine sapphire watch with no impunity even a genuine diamond coating with pure sapphire underneath just saying and I love apple but come on guys
What I know is that apple sells shit to customers at a premium $1300 price tag. That watch shouldn't cost that much. It's what Trump does with his name. He knows his name is worth more than what he sells. Apple has become the same thing.
The rubber seems to be legit tho! XD
Swiss watches are dope! üá®üá≠
Nice video, but could you STOP SCRATCHING WATCHES!!!
Apple has turned into yet another purveyor of overpriced, over hyped junk err I mean products. The cult of Mac is a powerful drug. The first computer I used was an Apple II in grade school in the late 70's, this is NOT the same company in any way, shape or form, sad.
if you paid 1300 for this yer a fuckin clown.
I really like that watch, where do I find it? I really love that orange.
Please make nokia durability test and drop test
I can probly afford the tissot but not the $1500 Apple watch
But will it blend?
Get an TISSOT and Paste The apple logo... ;) LOL
This is why I watch your channel....TRUST. I trust all of your testings and greatly appreciate you educating all of us to save our hard earned money. Thank you my friend.
For 1300 dollars I‚Äôd better get a diamond screen
Meanwhile, my 130 euro Rodania of 10 years with sapphire glass still has zero scratches. Been wearing this for every day, also during rough work. Didn't mather.
wow, am i the only one cringing at those scratching sounds? youch
Apple is stealing money... Earning more than they deserve...!!
And what about the back glass with sensors ?
You look like johnny sin.. my phone has scratches..fuck me right
Man I have to say, saw this on /r/videos and I'm not really your target demographic, I rarely remember to leave likes on videos even if I love them, but watching you scratch that Tissot and knowing your pain reminded me to like and subscribe.
The sapphire on the Tissot might get no damage. But the case sure as hell does because you can't keep the damn tool from contacting it. Talk about being spastic.
What's a common level 6 that my watch will come into day-to-day?\n\nCar keys?\nConcrete Wall I might brush against?
It‚Äôs very satisfying to see that abomination getting scratched.
hey, i have that Tissot!
I don't like that RED dot.
The issue with using pure sapphire on the Apple Watch screen is getting the corners of the screen to curve back like that. It can be done, but it‚Äôs a lot harder to do it with pure sapphire
GODDAMIT YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN THAT THING TO ME
I havent watched all of the video yet.\n\n\nPlease don't scratch the Tissot watch :(\n\nEdit: NOOOOOOOO
Its an apple product, im not surprised a swiss made watch beat it hands down.
omg apple\nyou really are a genius
I almost saw deja vu when Kyocera beat Apple by miles with the Kyocera Brigadier, while all the rumors of sapphire on the IPhone 6 happened to be false. This is almost similar, only with the [Verizon Wireless] Kyocera Duraforce Pro being the latest one. Speaking of which that sapphire equipped phone will ace that sapphire test as well!!
hurts to see the Tissot getting scratched :(\n\nno one cares about the apple watch
Even OnePlus managed o put pure sapphire on their budget smartphone last year (on the OnePlus 3T) and Apple is cheap enough to not put it on their extremely expensive watch. Congrats, Apple!
just goes to show you how shitty Apple products actually are. they're made to look nice, not actually be nice, they're literally made to break down after a year
This video was sponsored by tissot
fuck apple lmao u dont even get what the tell u..
It was heartbreaking watching this üò¢
Personally i dont really care for apple products and i think apple as a company can be a bit scummy with their products and prices but im not gonna get all pissy about it because hey its your money so i wont tell you how to spend it
Apple is capitalis they want u money
Steve Jobs is turning in his grave
I feel sorry to the tissot :(
Bro next time don't murder beautiful watches, just a tiny scratch can serve the purpose too. It was hard for me to that Tissot get scratched so bad
I love how chill his voice
I've got a cheapshit watch from my local grocery\nAnd I'm happy with that
I've seen gore vids on 4chan.org but never cringed as much as in your scratch tests...
Apple did not come up with the first telephone watch .\nThe Chinese made the first telephone watch. \nThis video just show you how Apple is overcharging consumers for a inferior products.
Appe is saying a lot of lies like this apple watch real sapphire glass
All the Android users watch this video to shit on Apple when they are poor losers who don‚Äôt understand the company and why certain versions cost so much.
how about a drop test to see if these sapphire are shatter resistant?
What Tissot watch was used on the video?
This hurts to watch
First, that's no innovation at all. Way behind on the watch as they are on the phone. Very expensive usual products, sold as premium, which I think is only in the heads of the less educated. There is NO premium, as this type of classification is truly different for each individual.\nAs we aknowledge beauty and good taste differently, the same way we take premium under consideration. So just taking those Apple products as premium, just because they say so, it's only a sign a premature brain leaking :) .
Think I could get that scratched Apple Watch? Very good video!!! Thank you.
Nice to see the scratch test on the ceramic! How does the black chrome fare?
*The* *bed* *is* *lava* *like* *this* *if* *you* *died*
Fucking piece of shit apple. All apple is a rip off and all people that buy apple are morons.
I have to say the level 6 and 7 I can barely see the phones I would see it immediately?
Does the apple watch have an AR coating? \n\nAR coating is softer than sapphire.
Apple are scum. How can they get away with this shit?
Literally the bare minimum amount of Sapphire needed for Apple to be able to say it‚Äôs Sapphire
He said it very well.. buy the base model, and you‚Äôll be fine. Don‚Äôt hate on Apple because of a watch, hate them for having children build their phones at miserable salaries
Which is the best smart watch you recommend to get?
please make. a video for mi a1
Apple we have indestructable screens that crack if you drop them any higher than 2 nanometers

Clearly Apple continues to sell overpriced and overhyped bs. Oh and BTW, that Tissot watch is absolutely amazing. Thanks for your great videos!
It was hurtful to watch someone scratching that beaut Tissot watch
Does anyone know what model is that Tissot watch? I wanna buy it
APPLE HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO!!
The Swiss government wants you for crimes against wristwatches
The dislikes are from butthurt Apple fan boys.
Tim Cook and the rest of the Apple team is really mad at Jerry right now üòÇüòÇüòÇ
They should have just called it flame fusion crystal  just like Invicta does to make bull shit sound fancy LOL! Dude.. congratulations, you literally stopped me from making an impulsive 700 dollar purchase today on a fucking piece of bullshit when it's not even complete sapphire. Thank god for people like you. I'd like to hire you to work for me lol!
i hate you, the fact you have the money to buy an $1300 watch and all that equipment to scratch it. Fuck. You.
Apple out here finesseing
1300$ Wtf

You scratched your 300$ Tissot watch for this kinda impure apple watch!??
Hello from Japan üáØüáµ
cheap tricks by apple
Ok, excuse my rant but you know what really grinds my gears? Why the fuck would ANYONE buy a $1300 watch? And not only that, but pay $84 To unlock fast charge ???? Stupid as fuck.
Or, save an additional 300 bucks and don't buy an apple watch at all üòä it's just an extension of your phone anyway üòä
Tell you what-  I‚Äôll take the scratched iWatch LOL - no really, I‚Äôll take it off your hands...üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏è
Don't know what's worse.. the girl using the Gameboy the wrong way or the guy who doesn't know how to properly record a video.
Sign of the times
It makes me sad the way she uses that gameboy üò≠üò¢üòµüò∑
The kid thinks it is a iPhone, lol
Surprised she even hold it
what is sad about it ?
This is actually depressing.
This is why I won't buy my kid any touch screen devices before the age of 13
This is so sad. God damn millennials.
Ok i want back to 1990 Pls where is my Time Machineüòê
we are no longer young
I am so fucking disappointed that kids now day don't know what buttons are
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
This generation is depressing
if i had kids, they wouldnt be that stupid to know that you need to use buttons to make it work
game boy and pokemon yellow was my child hood
Try to drive a two decade old car before you was born.
some people will feel very old seeing that üòÇ
What triggers me the most in this vid is not the kid. But the guy filming it horizontally...
Dont worry she will learn some day\n\n\n\n\nI hope üò©
Nostalgia and Anxiety is real
This is Sims4 stupid. Even the way she walks away

I used to work in a school and a few of the year 7's that came in last year had never used a mouse before because their primary schools used iPads and their home PC was a laptop.. :|
0:09 when anyone talks to me
Why can't it be called gameboy-girl
Big surprise. Technology changes. \n\nI bet all of you $200 that you don't know how a rotary dial telephone works.
I just wanna press all the buttons for her! ARGH! SO TRIGGERING! KIDS THESE DAYS HAVE NO CULTURE
That is so sad
This reminds me of back to the Future when Marty is mocked for using hands to play an arcade game
Why can't she play it I mean it's pokemon yellow
She‚Äôs like ‚Äòshut yo face dad!‚Äô
I completely understand that touchscreens are what she knows and what she's used to. But...the buttons are right there. How does she not see the buttons....
Oh no a kid who hasn't been taught how to use a gameboy can't play one the human race is doomed!!!! Why oh why has she been deprived of this life saving skill that is so important to her future? What will become of her if she only knows how to utilise the skills she is taught ? I can't even watch this that poor child !!
Who gives a fuck is she doesnt know how to use it.by the time they are 30 they will be more advanced then us.
In another 20 years kids will struggle to play on a iPhone 8..,
This is why kids shouldn't have a tablet when there 2 years old 8 years old minimum, this is getting ridiculous!
The 2000 generation will never know what the 1990 to 1980 was like it going to become the generations of robots and dramalert üò≠üò≠üò≠
There is no hope for the future...
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
People... the video is 12 seconds long. I‚Äôm sure she figured it out soon after. Just because she was mistaken for a moment and tried what she‚Äôs used to, doesn‚Äôt mean she (or her entire generation, for the REALLY ridiculous overreactors) is stupid and can‚Äôt figure things out.
This generation is doomed
Whoa what a surpise, kids are adapting to modern technology. Its sad but this has been happening for decades
Look how far technology has gone
THIS IS TORTURE TO LOOK AT :XXXXXXXXX
I never had a gameboy, I had a Ds.
It's not sad! Would it make you happier if the phone wasn't invented? Then all the kids would instead be smoking cigarettes and rolling down roads in carts? Our world is evolving, and so is our technology. Kids are changing with it, but I do get where everyone is coming from. She's not even listen to her dad.
Basically this generation is super fucked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDont even ask why
I'm keeping my gameboy to show my kids one day
Our Society Is Now Very Young
Lol give her an NES. She will be like screaming at mario to move thinking that it has voice control.
This kind of saddens me. I‚Äôve never owned a gameboy but i had a ds and similar stuff when i was like 6. I guess the world is changing, gotta accept it
She thinks it's a mini Ipad
Giving young kids smart devices..this is where should start
i'm also a big fan of Ethan and Dolan\n0:09
Oh no, what have phones done to the youth? Now they can never enjoy a good ol gameboy anymore. :(
Old people> Doesn‚Äôt understand touchscreen. Younger people> Doesn‚Äôt understand control pads.

*Did she not even SEE the buttons?* seriously.

This was at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. The soprano was 28, not 16. She is portraying a doll, Olympia, with whom Hoffmann falls in love. Sadly, she is only a doll. The opera is Les Contes d‚ÄôHoffmann (The Tales of Hoffmann) by Jacques Offenbach. \nRemember kids, there is no amplification in opera. These people have trained, and have loud voices. I love opera. üëçüèªüòä
Lyrics:\n\nAAA aaaa aAAAA aaaaaaa aaa aaa a aAAAA A A aaaa hahahaha aAAAA aaaaaaa ahahaHahahaaaAAAA aAAAA
She was 28 not 16
I performed this song in my rep my senior year of college! Such a fun piece
she‚Äôs going places
C'mon pop blast stop with the click bait titles. You could of just said Woman instead of 16 year old 16 and 28 yrs of age is some distance apart. Ridiculous
just look at their faces at 0:24, 0:40, 0:59 2:22, 2:36 and 2:52 HAHAHA
This sucks wtf how can anyone listen to this
Oh wow! That must have taken a lot of practice!
It's painful because opera music sucks. Did you ever notice they don't play this kind of stuff on the radio? There's a reason for that
This is from 2011.....
ok this is scary imma have hella nightmares
lyrics pls
Mad respect!!!
Brilliant! Amazing control!
Outstanding!  Nailed it!!!!
my ears are bleeding
Fantastic!  Such stage presence!
Did anyone else here the dude coughing
Nice stolen video

OMG\nImagine a sing off between her and *The Diva* (the blue alien chick) from *The Fifth Element!*\nüé∂üòåüé∂
Fix the title.
Dayum‚ÄºÔ∏è l
Amazing!!!!!!!
This is creepy
Was that Rachel Gilmore?

I keep watching it over again it‚Äôs just so beautiful! ‚ù§Ô∏è
A crowning achievement.
Wow
What are the lyrics to this opera?
When she started jumping up and down I lost itüòÇüíÄüíÄüíÄ
her neighbours must hate her practicing! I use to sing opera in my house 247 lol wow what am amazing voice and talented young lady!! ‚ù§
FYI she was NOT 16 but 28. It takes years to have this kind of vocal control. :)
Mariah Carey, you're nothing now!
She was 28 you morons..
Holy fricc
Ez
She trashed it
Fifth Element Diva!
True talent üòç
Phone screen just cracked.
AMAZING
this is CRAZY
Omggggg so amazing
Id smash 1000000 times
Damn
My would crack, SOOOO BAD
She's not 16.
Isnt this the opera song that girl sang from Spain's got Talent? when she acted like the music messed up and started singing Highway to hell???
I would love it if she didn't dress like that, it just find her look....creepy
Dead performance. Opera is just shit
üëå
Wow just imagine what she will be like in a few years time. An international superstar no doubt.
She absolutely shits on every soprano 20 years her older
Why did you correct it back to 16 year old after you acknowledged that she was 28 years old at this time? Jesus
I don't like opera but that was impressive. \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Honestly why should i give a shit?
All I hear is screaming in a high pitch voice lol my little annoying brother can sing this *makes brother mad*....\n\n\n\n\n\n*brother gets mad screams* and that is how this type of singing was created üòÇüòÇüòÇ
e r o t i c
She usually has black and white hair in the music videos
That was a fantastic performance
Pshhhh...let's see her sing the contra G in Do Not Reject Me in My Old Age. She's got nothing on my boi Chesnokov. üò§üò§üí™üí™üí™
Why do people like opera? I can only take so much of women screaming in my ear before I lose it.üò¨üòâ
Theres her, age 16\nthen theres me... my best achievement is 100 hours on Mercy in Overwatch
Who‚Äôs here from Reddit?
What that mouth do tho
I didn't realize the human voice could resemble a violin so much üôÑ
My dog freeked the fuck out when the is came on
She was actually 28, not 16. She mentioned it in the Reddit post.
I dnt know anything about opera but u can tell she is good by everyone's expressions. They all looked amazed.
okay, now its time for her try at the 5th Element Opera Song.
But she isn't 16.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE BORING ASS PEOPLE LAUGHING AT?! beautiful voice btw.
Why is this making me teary?
Opera equivalent of Through Fire and Flames in Guitar Hero.
She was 28 not 16 she confirmed this on reddit
Is that actually singing? My ears are bleeding, its worst than that heavy metal where screaming people, but at least those don't use such a high pitch to fuck my ear drums
Bravo! Bravo!! üëè üíê  \n\n* Edit -- WTF!?  This is from 6 years ago :/
her singing is amazing and all, but as a dancer, the ballet incorporated in this is terrible
*people laughing*\nMe- wtf is she saying? Lol
wow she is amazing and her acting is in point I love it thank you for uploading this talented lady video you've got a new fan here
I can't even talk without my voice breaking.
She did a very good job. What a good voice.  Best wishes to the new young soprano.
Good singer but she scared the poop outta me
This is amazing!!! If I tried those notes I would just be screaming üòÇ
Wow! Good job lady! She can do that opera singing stuff so well for being a youngling.
Get her for fifth element 2!
Be still my heart!! I'm speechless...
I saw this is music class in school last year.
i'd LOVE to hear her sing Queen of the Night
OMFG MY WINDOWS ARE CRACKING....OMG THE BIRD'S HEAD JUST POPPED....AAAAAAAAAH....OMG I CANT HEAR ANYTHING....DEAD
Except she's not 16 at all.
She wasn't 16 she was 28 lol
She wasn't 16 when this video was taken btw, to sing this song the voice has to be at least 20.
Unfortunately, the title is inaccurate, because she said she was 28 at the time; there's proof from the soprano herself. But, what makes up for it is the fact that she was told she was singing in the concert 4 hours ahead of time, which is even more impressive, I think. AND playing with the MET: arguably the best opera company in the world.
SHE WAS 28 HERE NOT 16.  For god sake this channel is so lazy, cannot even get facts right. Regardless of age she is amazing.
This happened back in December of 2009.  Why is it being shown here like it's a new thing?

Oh my god....I've been to 30 art museums. This is by far the most beautiful work of art I have seen all my life!
Omgoodness that was so Funny XDDD. I recommended this to my Spanish teacher and he showed it to us during class XDD.
Brb, gotta go study fish in case.
So funny üòÇ
cc‚Äôs are cubic centimeters
I LOOOOOOOOOVE U STUDIO C
Aaaaaand now you are Jeremy Limpet.
Wow this is fishy :/
How can he be a beta fish if its a salt water tank?
Let me guess. The kyle fish is coming
omg good job +Jeremy Warner! this was literally so funny!!!!! i love the background music in the beginning! congrats you guys this was so hysterical
How do you do all these props? üòÇüòÇüòÇyou guys are amazingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Worst most boring Studio C video ever.
Who actually thought Cc Was close captions?
Why did he get so eloquent half way through XD
Jeremy did such a good job in this sketch though
This is really silly. 'Not well done.
Hahaha this has to be one of my new favorites. Jeremy's acting is on-point.
I love how he says 'just keep swimming' when a Dory type of fish swims on camera
I like the framed picture on the wall in the background.
When I got my wisdom teeth out, I though I was a robot.
Oh my gosh, I absolutely adore this sketch! I've been having a really stressful day, and this video was the perfect study break. Studio C, thank you for gracing the world with your art. You never fail to put a smile on my face. ‚ù§
Worst Studio C sketch ever. Thought if I stayed to the end it might redeem itself. But nope. Not that the acting was bad. It was the concept that fell flat for me.
Am I a notification viewer?
Studio C has jumped the SHARK...\nI'm sorry, I just had to. But in all honesty, this isn't creative humor, just the dumb kind.
You can see Jeremy's reflection in the glass.
This should also be done with squirrels.
Why didn't he just look around and realised he was making things up?
*Public Service Announcement*\n1. Search - ROFL with Ray\n2. Prepare to Laugh\n3. Laugh\nWhy? Because a day without laughter is a day wasted...\nThat is all.
Thanks for the closed captions Studio C!
Lol and here I thought Jeremy was a bad actor xD great Job dude
He sounds like a retard XD
NEED TO CATCH THE POKEMONS!!
This is one of Jeremy's best sketches.
I love how when he says I guess, just keep swimming? a dory swims into the frame
Nice
Hey , its Nemo and Dory
Rip headphone users
He is Zalmuron, the REINCARNATED!!
JEREMY NEEDS TO BE THE STAR OF MORE SKETCHES
Every fin shall bow! :-D\n\n\n\n\nAnd every gill confess?
wut
just keep swimmin, just keep swimmin, just keep swimmin, swimmin, swimmin!
ZALMURON THE REINCARNATED
O SAW NEMO AND HIS DAD AND DORY
For the record, I HAVE caught all the pokemon. After 7 generations of pokemon stored away you feel like you can conquer the world

The new episode didn't go to season 7
Dang I knew that stuff did things to people‚Äôs heads but this is redundant. XD
I could make a better video with 3 minutes prep time.
It's always so easy to identify a Jeremy written sketch.
This reminded me of my sister when she got her wisdom teeth removed.üòÇ
who else got really concerned for Jeremy XD
I love this sketch, but it was dragging just a little in a couple places.
#32 on trending!!! YES! Now more people can watch studio c!!
Donner, party of one XD Please tell me other teens get this.
This is trending?!\n\nWay to go!
Maybe I should cancel my wisdom teeth removal...
Still enjoy new sketches, but a little too much yelling in this one. :-)
The best of Jeremy! Thanks for the laughs!
Don't do drugs kids
I definitely couldn't open my mouth like that after my oral surgery. Nor could I talk like that. Or move like that. But I was groggy enough to see exactly where the hands of the clock pointed but not figure out the time till ten minutes later.
You guys should make a worst car dealer skit.

The ways I get my nieces to drink water is 1) a special cup (better with a straw because they will drink more), 2) spa waters with fruit or cucumber etc (helps if you introduce it during a 'spa night' then they think it's special 3) if all else fails, we have an ice crusher and they will eat crushed ice ANY time it's offered!
I‚Äôm a big sister to a 6 year old and an 8 year old you‚Äôre not alone, the battles we have getting them to drink is ridiculous they have bottles of drink throughout the day but they just forget to drink, I‚Äôm nearly 20 and find it weird because I never was like this when I was younger
if she don't like water why push it?
I have 2 nieces at darcys age and what I found is that them having a bottle with times of the day w how much they have to drink and they love it always and drink it ‚ù£
32 YEAR OLD single Mummy here. Officially my fave youtuber, she is smart, beautiful and bloody hilarious. The Richard Medley comment had me in stitches! I saw that interview and couldn't quite believe what he said, very tasteless of him but you handled it with style as usual. Just want to say that it doesn't matter how much bump grows, or how many calories you consume, sex appeal doesn't come in any particular shape or size, you either have it or you don't, and you definitely do! Ps I'm straight (just want to point that out).
Hi! I'm new! This is my first time seeing one of your videos as a friend has recommend that I start watching you! Your very sweet and very very pretty like oh my gosh I'm actually jealous. This is one the most awkward comments I've ever typed but I'm just as awkward irl so...yeah...anyways I'm for sure subscribing ^-^
Every time I hear you guys reference Hello World I can't help but think about the travel agency with the same name here in Australia :'D #SozNotSoz
You were at Botley Hil Farmhouse! That is so close to me!
My little brother never drank milk or ate more veggies than carrots. My mum and i sat him down to explain why he needs to drink more and eat a variety of things (not scaring him, but making him aware of the facts). If he had his 5 a day and a glass of milk everyday for 2 weeks, he was allowed ¬£5 to spend on whatever he wanted. We continued the chart format for about 6 weeks and then we scrapped it as it just became part of his routine! Good luck with it louise!
I feel like Louise is a bit self conscious when vlogging. Maybe that's just me. You are beautiful Louise and I love you very much xxxxxxxxx
Glad to hear this week was better for you Louise x
Louise and Jim always have the funniest conversations
I'm new!\n\nAs in, this is one of my first videos from you!! :D
Try finding a decaf tea she likes without sugar or milk and if it's too hot for tea just ice it :)
Congrats on having a good week!üëçüèª
so i dont like drinking milk but so I drank it when i was younger my mum would buy these chocolate milk straws which u can get in b&m and home bargains....there's ones for water too that might help darcey becuase it cookie flavour etc
Cracking up at the bit about Richard and Judy üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My five year old hardly drinks, he'll only drink water if it's volvic lemon! God help us when milk stops in class because other than that I'm pretty sure he doesn't drink at school x
Hahahah weekly nail check ins are an integral part of the vlogs! And those kittens are just too cute üòç
I'm on the p.t.a now hahaha Robin?
I can't wait to see how ignorant Dan and Phil are to all this mummy business, thankfully now they have been enlightened.
Cats dont like other cats in the home. I wouldnt personally bring in another cat..
Hiya I‚Äôm new love your vlogs üíï
I'm new!!!!
DAN AND PHIL!!!!
5:21 let her drink water with some fruits or lemon if she likes them, or some sliced cucumber added to her bottle
I work in a hair salon that does Kevin Murphy and the salon you went to is by far the most beautiful salon I‚Äôve seen in ages!üòç
Omg the shoot footage was so funny! Loved this!!
First let me say that getting involved in your child's educational life is anything but a sad mum alert'. I give you kudos and a gold star on your forehead for joining the PTA and giving of your time and talents to all the children at Darcy's school. Bravo, Louise! \n\nNext, I have to tell you how absolutely gorgeous you look with your no-makeup-makeup look. And even your out-and-about makeup looks seem to have a lighter hand and really accentuates your beauty instead of calling attention to the actual makeup. Love the less is more makeup application. Bottom line, you look absolutely beautiful. Maybe this wonderful week was creating your natural glow. Regardless of the cause, you look amazing!
Have you tried the towel trick with your cats to see if it helps them get on? You just rub the new cats with a towel then rub it on the older cat. And do it the other way. It's essentially just rubbing the scent on them, but it apparently helps them get on because they then recognise the scent so the cats then aren't just strangers ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Please do another book tour for Wilde 2 as I couldn‚Äôt come to the last one xx

I'm so glad you've had such a lovely week! ‚ù§Ô∏è x
This must be so weird but I've watched Lou for six years now! I bloody love this woman even though we don't know each other in real life and it's a one sided friendship but she makes me so happy and she's one of the most genuine on YouTube today. I know I must sound so creepy writing this but she makes me so happy! Hopefully I'll be able to go to an event in the future.
Lol ...Nutella doughnut SHIT ME! Louise you're hilarious that would be my reaction too! Heaven in a doughnut
The water thing, it's ok!!! If she's thirsty, she'll drink. if she's not getting thirsty all day then she's getting enough water in her food and other drink to keep her going. \nI found that giving my kiddo some water or milk right before dinner was good, or with his snack if i wasn't sure if he was really hungry or just peckish.
For your tires, next time check to see if there was any bumps on the side. That can cause blow outs.
I'm currently watching Chesapeake Shores on Netflix and it's so heartwarming and good for my soul
GET THOSE APPS FOR DRINKING WATER AND IT GROWS YOUR PLANT\nI got it on my phone for my sister because she did the same thing
I‚Äôm new-ish. I watched you when I was about 12/13, stopped, and now I‚Äôm watching again as a 17-almost-18 year old. Started again bc your content has changed, it‚Äôs sort of grown with me which is cool! x
I really love the long vlogs!
It was so nice seeing you all together- reminded me of old school YouTube :')
do a rose quartz cosplay hawhaw you fit that role perfectly
You actually get a lot of liquids from foods so it's quite normal for kids who are eating a normal amount to not feel like drinking. I dranks very, very little as a child even when I was playing sports. Also the 8 cups of water a day was mostly made so important by a bottled water company if I recall correctly so that's also a thing :)
I love doughnuts but I can‚Äôt eat them üëéüèªüòû I can‚Äôt eat wheat or gluten or dairy üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Oh your living room is the exact blue I want for my new place!! Absolutely beautiful üòçüòçüòç Please could tell me what colour and brand it is? xxx
My son's 8 and it's still a battle to get him to drink!! I feel your pain! We've just had a breakfast battle over a cup of water! But he loves fizzy water & will drink it endlessly!  I try and get him to eat lots of things like Celery, cucumber & melons or he could go a whole day without water!!! Xx
My foster sister (mum is a foster carer) battled with my mum for at least the first 6 months of living with us. Then my mum found a water bottle with her name on and ever since then she drinks the full bottle each day. Give that a go? X
Hey so with the water dislike, My mum used to use cordial (natural ones like lemon or pineapple ones), or we had drink bottles with diffuser's in them so we could add things like strawberries or kiwi fruits
I don't like donuts... I'm sorry they just taste so weird, especially glazed... The only donuts I really like are completely chocolate ones.
Aw, Dan was just adorable in this. He turns into a kid around Louise, I love it XD
Omggg that tyre thing happened to me on the freeway (In australia about 100kms/hr) and i ended up having a car accident its terrifying!!
When the kids don't want to drink water, I usually told them really excited omg u know what can we do, grab a lime üçã I cut it open and drop like 5 drops of lemon, and tell them that bc we put lemon there it's not gonna taste like water, and I'll have a glass with them, but idk üòÇ
Your weekly vlogs honestly make my day when I watch themüòÇ
I am new! I think you're bloody marvellous though! X
I never comment, but I must know where your lovely necklace is from? The one with the pink stone on the middle! It's pretty! X
Just FYI, I love the long vlogs. They play while I work. I work from home.
ok didnt the whole gang include naomi or no? \nmaybe its me, i just feel a bit weird about that
This video was a crazy mess, just the way I like themüëåüèªüëçüèªglad to see that you got pep back in your steps. Big Love M‚ù§Ô∏è
My sisters never wanted to drink and mum got them these water bottles each and it had like lines and tells them when the need to keep drinking and that and then refill and they would get little rewards when they had drank it !! Highly Recommendedüíì
ok pause video at wilde pre order (tick),, pop on amazon(tick),, pre order book(tick) ,, and continue watching the video,,, (tick)
Im new but I'm gonna be a stayer i just love this
my mum used to color my milk to get me to drink it, just a drop or two of food coloring, might work the same with water? you could even add some fruits and let it sit overnight to give it some flavour (which is the only way i can drink water because i don't like the taste)
you should try flavored water to get encourage her to drink more water
I used to and still really dislike water. It makes me feel ill if I drink it. So I put some sugar free lime squash in it and it makes it easier to drink personally
I'm called Lyla üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èüòª
More Louise and Zoe!!!
Any chance you could do an 18+ meet up? You mentioned it a while back - like cocktails perhaps for those of us who are a little bit older?
Joe not wanting to touch the baby and Marcus tickling Louise is adorable
For Darcy's water intake there's an app called plant nanny. Maybe that's something you guys can do together that will help. Basically it's the cute little app where you log your water intake throughout the day and it waters a little plant and makes it grow and keeps it alive. So maybe you could download it on your phone and she will enjoy coming to tell you when she drinks so she can water her flowers!
28:15 if you guys were wondering
Where‚Äôs Tanya and Naomi :(
I have only been watching for like 3 or 4 months
The Dublin store is the main store, Primark is Irish ! :)
This whole entire vlog was so delightful. Oh ¬†my word
aww, i love how giddy and excited dan gets when he's with louise
I'm a new subscriber to your vlogs. I've also got the audio version of your book that I'm really enjoying so excited to pre order the sequel. Hope you are keeping well x
My sister is about to turn 18 and we still have to nag her to drink more water! :')
Does louise still have her other cats?
I'm NEW! And loving all your videos!
I am new. Lol.
my brother is exactly the same with drinking and he's 10!!!
my 5 year old son struggles to drink his water and whats worse is that he only drinks water or hot chocolate. you tell him to drink some and he will take a sip. its so hard . he comes home from school with none drunk too. üòî x
I'm new :)
I never drunk water as a kid and now I drink it all the time, just put a little bit of juice in it and by the time she's older she'll learn to love it on its own
The Richard Madeley bit was HILARIOUS!!!! x
Your looking really good Louise! Xx
I struggle to get the kids I work with to drink too. I have a box of curly and fun straws for the really resistant children. They're a pain to sterilise but still better than dehydration. We also give a choice between milk or water, so if a child doesn't like water, they have a choice. Putting fruit in (raspberries, lemon etc) can work too for some children.
Dan seems sooooo happy far out!! You do too Louise
Dan was hyperüòÇ
IM NEW
omg rocket!!!! hahahah couldnt stop laughing
Who is Rocket??
Lol hiiii, I'm newww. :3
What does Louise say at 1:57 hahaha
Newww
neww
Should not laugh but oh boy it's so funny. On a serious note though, the teacher was wrong to sit on the car's bonnet.
Teacher should not have sat on bonnet.. but thats not an excuse to  drive through him!..  He should have been reported not transported!!!..
Teacher acting unprofessional by sitting on someone's property = frustration and retaliation= a sore arse !!
Sitting on the bonnet of someone's car is just asking for trouble. A quick reverse would have had the same effect. But we don't think straight when we see red do we!
My sympathy was for the Teacher, but when I saw that he sat on the bonnet, that sympathy diminished, no need to be that arrogant.
Teacher isn‚Äôt going to do that again, lesson learnt !
The driver should have quickly reversed instead.
Hahaha, id have done the same if he'd sat on my car. Prick.
Why you sitting on someone's bonnet if I am the driver I do the same
He is my science teacher and he did that because your not allowed to park in there
Lmao that's my teach Mr.McCarthy XD\nAs you can see, Winston is a great school. That's why I wish I moved from the USA to England sooner :D
stop attacking the teacher- the driver could've killed him whether he sat or not- also, if he just stood there, the driver would've ran him over, so sitting on it made it less painful for him.\nalso, at least sympathise with the teacher, his mum died in the same week as this event and recently his dad did too- do you have no love??
Teacher got what he deserved
Ive  just seen this on the news! Have they pressed charges against the teacher yet? This is an act of aggression. If he got out and pushed him he would be in the wrong! Try sitting on a police car and see what happens!
Mr McCarthy in the Winston school he is a sciance teacher
guys u may not belive me but he is my physics teacher and i am not even lying. He didnt sit on the car, the car went forward a bit and then he drove off. he is my gcse physics teacher belive me
There are thousands of arseholes on youtube blaming the teacher.\n\nTry watching the video in a full screen.  The car is rolling forward.  The teacher falls onto the bonnet.  His feet leave the ground for less than a second.  Insufficient time to take his hands out of his pockets and regain his balance, before the criminal accelerates and causes GBH.\n\nEvery action has an equal and opposite reaction.  Explain to me the effect of a one and a half tonnes car rolling in to you?????  Would you fall on to the bonnet?????  How long would it take for you to get off?????\n\nPersonally I have less faith in drivers.  I would not stand in front of an irate driver and turn my back on them.  Is the naive teacher in the wrong?  ABSOLUTELY NOT
Haha stupid cunt of a teacher. Arrogant cunt got what he deserved.
He shudda reversed and made him fall flat on arse
I was more concerned about the two kids on their bikes who nearly got ran over by that ass hole
Hi Mate could you give Me a lift to the bottom on the drive!!!!! Yeah Mate SIT on my bonnet an I'll take you there, Just wait a min................. WHAYHAY what a ride OR was that just me with that VID??????? LMFAO BUT that said he did wrong and poss hurt the children
Teacher was in Passive Mode (  Noob )
Move please?!\nBugger off!\nWhy?!\nDo you know who I am?!\nWho the hell are you?!\nI'm Ronnie Pickering !!\nWho??\nRonnie Pickering!!\nWho?!\nRONNIE PICKERING!!
Fair enough that the teacher won¬¥t allow him to pass. But you sit on my car and I will fuck you up. It¬¥s as simple as that.
Holy shit everyone in the comments is so serious, lighten up I found this funny as shit
Hilarious! The best laff I've had in ages!!!!!!!
Funniest thing ever imagine being one of them kids on the bikes  üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Whether the teacher sat on the bonnet of the car or not is totally irrelevant, the driver was trying to drive through the staff car park as he was too bloody bone idle to use public roads to turn around. So wants to speed through a car park where children are walking. A total danger to society, 22 and in prison. I suspect he will be returning there often throughout his life.
If the teacher had the audacity to sit on my bonnet id fucking give him a test drive too..
Good they shud have reversed and drove over the twat
Doesn't take long for clips to be stolen does it
If the car park is off limits, why not just put a gate on, rather than just having ferris bueler's teacher guarding like some kind of traffic control cunt?
Teacher is a cunt. \nKid that watches then gets on his bike and fucks off is cool üòéüòé
Serve the jobs worth rightüòÇüòÇ
Humans are garbage. This video is the proof.
Stupid fucking teacher, he looked like a right wolly car surfing
Don't sit on his fucking car then! Cheeky twat deserved it.
For those people denying the fact that the teacher didn't deliberately sit on the car (which it clearly shows in the footage) but the car nudged him on the bonnet. You are delusional fucks that deny the truth and have never owned a fucking car
He'd have gotten the same if he sat on my car's bonnet
Should‚Äôve driven straight into a wall.
He sat on the mans hood .fuk id have .thrown him off my car too then stopped and whipped his stupid ass.
Both are to blame, but the teacher should never have done that in the first place. Should have just let the car in the car park, then ask them to leave once off the main road and not obstructing traffic. Trying to be clever has cost him, could have had a nasty accident if he fell the wrong way too!
the description on this video is very inaccurate... The teacher actually sat on the bonnet of the car, Which in no doubt would have angered any motorist. Serves the teacher right for trying to be really cocky!!
This is my schoolüòÇ
Hahaha that‚Äôs funny!!! But why did the so-called responsible teacher sit on the mans bonnet??? Surely he knew that would only exacerbate the situation.
LOOOL
‚úî
If the driver waited for traffic to pass and reversed, the teacher would of slid off his bonnet and landed on his ass, especially as he had his hands in his pockets. Not a very good teacher sitting on someone else's car. The car had no insurance or mot and if he did that, I doubt the car driver would of been arrested and jailed.
LOL
guys look slowly the car is going slowly and sir loses balance so he sits on it and a school policy is not to let cars in otherwise there would be thousands of cars and if a kid gets hit the school would be deemed unponsable and closed so look over this one more time üòâ
Dramatic footage\nFuck off will yah
I have no problem with the teacher sitting on the bonnet of the car, too many people think they can park and drive anywhere they like. I see this on a daily basis outside our child's school, drivers who don't give a shit and will park anywhere. The teacher obviously told them they could not access this area and they basically refused to move. I personally would not have sat on the car just incase it decided to move, but to have a go at the teacher because he did is ridiculous, what that person did was reckless especially with those 2 kids on bikes being so close to being hit as well. What the teacher did was nothing compared to that driver, yet majority on here complaining about the teachers actions rather than concentrating on the driver. So sad.
Absolutely hilarious that!
why his pride would not let him park where he should and not where he wants .\nDriver decides its ok to risk kids and teachers safety by driving like a prat.\nany one who thinks this was/is ok is a complete and utter arse hole .
TEACHER WHOLLY TO BLAME!!
hermateige Rd
Nonsense the car gave the old man a ride to school totally innocent
The amount of people defending what the bloke did shows that there are more complete and utter twats using the internet than ever before.  And all you fuckin' morons saying 'I'd have done the same if he sat on my car' are just spouting the usual kind of bollocks that your type always mouth off when your gob is bigger than your balls!
Why on earth does science teacher McCarthy sit down on the bonnet of a car? He must know that every action has an equal and opposite reaction! Head of the school Zoe Johnson-Walker seems very keen to completely overlook this - perhaps she has not seen the footage properly......(doubt it). Cynics might say that there is an attempt to manage or conceal any contributory negligence from the school. I do not condone or congratulate the driver. McCarthy seems to have made both himself and his school appear very amateurish.
The teacher didn‚Äôt sit on the car bonnet cos I saw as I was the kid on the bike (on the right)
Cheap car cheap driver
has to be a woman driving ...benefit mum had no dick last night ...Jeremy kyle fcking ppl
He didn't sit on the bonnet - he was forced on to the bonnet when the driver deliberately ran into him. The driver is a lunatic and should have his licence revoked.
So excited for pvp
Now THIS is up our alley üòÉ Can't wait! #StayTactical
I cannot fucking wait to get back into Ghost War! You guys killed it with this, I mean that in a good way just to be clear.
all I want is more ac origins vids
Add Battle royal pleaseüôèüèª
We have a release date! Can't wait to play this, awesome job ubisoft. I knew it was worth the wait!
This is gonna be sweet, can't wait for Oct 10th! :D
How to tie multiplayer into the main story: 4 Ghosts went Rouge with stolen CIA files the other 4 ghosts tracked them down to a place (name of map here).
Fist your so good at ghost recon wildlands
I love it as pvp but i don't love it as 4v4, We want it like SOCOM 8v8 and 16v16, There are some problems i will mention, When the enemy throw the gernade why it's so seen why?? It must be unseen you just hear it sound when it hits the ground only, Please don't make the gernade seen to the players, also why you can mark the enemy why?? please guys make it more reality!! You can't mark the enemy in real life! i don't like that you should make the players can't mark each other.
You got to add a battle royal/PUBG mode. it would be very popular if you do it right and the game has all the things it needs like vehicles, weapons and good map
Oh and take away unlimited revives. Once you're dead, you're dead. Not realistic at all.
can not be 4 vs4 because this game is so easy
This game is one of my favorite shooters for the sheer variety of ways you can approach any objective. Please keep making third person type shooters, I hate Cod clones.
Is it wrong to be sexually attracted to this? BTW, add a Hitman class, with a suppressed pistol and a drone that marks enemies and explode without being detected to make up for it's lack of firepower
Question: am I the only person who really just wants that masks the Assassin had? Yeah, pvp will be fun, but dang it Ubisoft, I want that mask
this is almost like a new rainbow six siege only outdoors
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Make a hardcore version of it with the most realistic version that you can, no markers no noise marker and less health with realistic mag reload
dips on the assasin ! cant wait to fck some people up with the vector lol
I hope this is not regionally blocked again.
If this is 4/4, where's 3/4?!!!
Sounds awesome can't wait to play...however I believe marking is way to easy it takes away the difficulty it also takes away the chance of players to try and lose the enemy when they are found PLS CONSIDER THIS
That assassin mask better be available in single player and co-op...
Did they add flash lights yet?
Does anyone know if the time Standalone comes out the same day as the update?
invisible drone is a bad idea
Beta was decent (no choice but to play seeing as how I've already paid for it) but in a way it feels it will be limited, be awesome if Ubisoft put as much effort in the game instead of these badass videos lol
I just love the customizations that you can put on your own unit.
I had so much damn fun winning and losing playing this pvp I can‚Äôt wait
Okay, the only issue I have. Where is Trailer 3? It jumps from 2 to 4
Can‚Äôt wait! It‚Äôs been a hot min but ready to go ghost lol
Can the assassin climb roofs, leap into bales of hay, and kill people with hidden blades though?
Ghost Recon Is Back In Business !
Release date Finally! So excited for the full launch
I think all the classes in the game are well balanced. Drones need to be limited and they need to fix the marking.
Not a lot of folks played the beta (Xbox1) they missed out. Let's hope we get a big turnout and Ubisoft stays with dedicated servers. This game will not be a sleeper.
Remove Cote to kick on rainbow six
Is this worth the 7 month WAIT? I'm very Salty about this, they are doing a peer to peer like For Honor. What a Joke UBISOFT! Plus there Isn't a Penalty for the RAGE quitters, which hangs you up in a middle of a match at-least 10 minutes for a replacement for the other team. The Beta was Sweet AZZ besides these 2 Major Issues. I'm not saying we are the best Squad out there, Team Infidels. But spending 70% of the gameplay time waiting on Q for replacements of the opposite Team, sucks Ballz Ubisoft. When released we will Share some Videos called WILDLANDS RAGE.
Rainbow Six Siege in 3RD PERSON!
They look a bit...Soft. Like when a Japanese game has female soldiers and they all look like models.
I requested the day off from work for this day under the category Personal Time Off. üòÇüéÆ
very good game would be good each one by itself, and conquest of the same as the previous ghost recon and consider the preparation time add a little more...
Assasin and Pointman.. i'm a fcking ninja
Did you release this before releasing 3? Cause its says Class Trailer 4/4 and I only see 1,2,4 not 3 xD At least on this Channel IGN has them all xD
OH lordie lord please don't let this dlc have achievements on this I've already completed this 100% and I do not want to go back to this game.
This has become one of the GREATEST shooters of ALL time!i couldnt stop playing the Beta and now a release date,CANT WAIT!!!üëçüòÉ
well i guess its about time they release a damn pvp mode lol! looks kinda unique too lol
I am erect.
Meh...
Iam hard
omg omg so excited!!!!
–Ø –æ–¥–∏–Ω —Ç—É—Ç —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π?
Still not better then Rainbow six siege üòè
I hope the start menu for class choice and loadout is different than the open beta was.
Assassin = OP
Enforcer for life
Nice job.

Yeesssss
bruh
ü•á
Did somebody said assassin?
The assassin is my favorite class of all time
Quit asking for 6v6, 10v10, 16v16, or Battle Royale. If you want that, go play PUBG or Fortnite (Free to download btw). Ghost War 4v4 brings in PVP to the Wildlands title and sticks with it's gameplay (4 member squads). Looking forward to October 10th and more additional campaign content after. Good job Ubisoft.
You dont grecee
Amazing mode
Oh
What happened to the third trailer?
Wouldn't want that sniper on my team.
Hello UBISOFT! i saw some problems that ruins the game, First the gernade is so weak and it's seen to the all players so this is so bad for the players it doesn't give excitement to the game, If you make the gernade like SOMCOM no one sees the gernade only you hear it sound when it hits the ground and then you die lol it will be really exciting and great for the players. Second problem is when you see your enemy and start firing the enemy gets marked so this is really bad because the enemy was my victim if the enemy got marked all my team would start firing. I love the game but i hope you fix these problems i mentioned, Make it real make it like SOCOM, Trust me if you did! all the people would play this game.
Do i agree ? That everyone here loves a big booty ?üòè
While I liked the beta I do hope is more modes to keep us playing a bigger map with say a 30min time limit most kills wins.
That mask on the assassin looks cool, wish we actually had that as a customization option.
That drone seems cheap allrdy lol
Can u tell me the release of the pvp?
How about a rebel ops PVP game mode where one team in the building protects the radio from the other team who raids the building... \nüëçüëçüëç
Everybody comment their favorite classes
hello ubisoft where is 3/4
DOubtful i'll drop $60 for the full game, but I'd totally pay $30 for a standalone ghost war game...
Hey ubisoft You sock at all games You make but rainbow six You need to kick all The hackers and all The glichesüò°
I don't like the idea of pvp in this game.
I can not play games , cause I have no GPU.
why not 10 vs 10 ???????????????

Welcome Saudi Arabia to the 21st century. Now it‚Äôs time for USA to progress and invade other people‚Äôs countries.
These women have Barbarian Arab genetics in them, very few are kind or empathetic. Without caning and stoning to death the young ones women will be sleeping around , galloping in their black veils. I do not beliieve in FGM, but female genital mutilation is done for a reason --- that they dont ride around with their ready to burst clitori's. \nMr Trump please stop immigration of Arabs to the USA. Other than beautiful women who may or not assimilate, they have nothing to offer to your country. Most of their women are air heads.
man can't handle women driving next to them (I am sorry what century we are in now?) ... Only dumbest things from FOX:D
you may not know that we actually drive long from long time üòÅ but not in the capital cities which is not really problem there you can get Taxi or Uber simply .
Its not the 20th century, its the 21st XD Fox looking stupid while making other people look stupid, double stupidd
So from next year women in Saudi will be allowed to drive but only if they get a permission letter from their male guardian, for certain times of the day WITHIN their district. *clap clap
Not a good thing.
Yeah, but they're only allowed to drive to the jail to be tortured for driving.
Too much privilege for certain women spoils them mentally....based on observation. The more money you give makes them arrogant. I'm not even a Muslim...
I'm a Saudi Arabian girl and it's not your fucking business America we do whatever we want whenever we want  so\nshut up!
Watch every Saudi woman pack her kids up and drive out of that shit hole country.  Thats why they cant travel without a male guardians permission is because Muslim men know these women would be gone. I hope all the Saudi  women run till they stop in a western country. Congratulations,  welcome to 2017!!!!!
Somehow, I don't trust this. It seems unlikely a strict religious based area like Saudi Arabia  would do this. I'm glad they got the right, but I can't help but feel something is up.
When will Saudi Arabia grant freedom of speech to other religions?
Any ideas on how to deal with women drivers on the road?are they good/bad drivers?i need to prepare myself for the worse
we. are. truly. FUCKED. NOW!!!!!   whatever happened. to. what. GOD. said.  about. women. driving....teaching... going. to. school....working....THINKING.... self. pleasuring?????
Women for Pity's Sake Don't Drive. Lol\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEEWWTV8Xbg
about fucking time you joined the rest of the CIVILIZED world saudi arabia. now if you would stop acting like scum beating your women and covering them up like ghosts and murdering the people of yeman that would be nice as well
All this time women weren't allowed to drive cars in Saudi Arabia, but they were allowed to fly planes. Funny.
Now that they have been granted permission to drive, maybe the ministry will allow them to wear something that enables them to see where they are going.
Am not happy with them
That's cool they should have been done that it's 2017 kinda scary sometimes in the USA driving next to someone with a mask on their face
I thought they were camel riders??
Its the beginning of the end for saudi arabia .... first, it starts with a simple right for women, then it grows into a demand for full equality between the sexes, then it becomes a demand that men give up their privileges while women keep theirs, entitlement comes next, then the victimization complex, then feminism and man hating ...... unless saudi men man up mid process and put an end to it by putting women back in their place, believe me saudi men, once you give in to women's demands and nags, then you will never see the end of it
Imagine a car accident happening between a man and a woman, they would kill the woman for trying seduce the man and provoke sexual connections with him.
Now all Saudi guys pay a Lambo Aventador to their wives (or Bugatti Chiron)
For a transition period the husband with a flag must walk in front of the woman driver.
God created the heavens and earth for Islam - to see who will believe , do good deeds and earn his mercy to get paradise and eternal life . If you are completely ignorant of Islam , that might save you from the hellfire although he still expects kindness from all,  whenever possible.
only if her harem leader allows it
sand ninjas are allowed to drive now?
now i know nxt year No Driving License for Expats Salaried below $800..very nice
Amazing news!! Congrats to all women in the Kingdom. You can find out more here, too: http://l.expatwoman.com/saudiwomenallowedtodrive
The accident rate will climb. How can they drive correctly when they are wearing a blanket over their heads. Add the sunglasses and all they will be able to see is forward. Turning their head will be difficult.
If they want to drive I don't care but I'll not let my family female  member drive car
Finally after all this years Thanx King
A dream come true we've been fighting since forever
As long as they don't get the right to vote.
OH Sweet heart - now we can meet to park my car in your garage!¬† Change oil and filter as often as revenge!
Well that's progress, now if they really want to show that they're evolving beyond what all other nations have, they should ban Asians from driving.
Good to see them join the 20th century.
WHOOOO...WOMEN RULE AS DRIVERS...üòÅüòÅüòÅ....HURTING OVARIES....LOOOOL....ANY EXCUSE TO SAY TO BAN WOMEN
The Nineteenth century you idiot!\nWestern Women could drive in the Nineteenth century \nEmelia Airheart was flying fucking plans in the Twentieth century and a few in space!!\nHe loves the snippy remarks but is an idiotic thinkerüòé\nA bit late Saud... let's step over the next line quicker aswell
NNNNNOOOOOooooooooo!!!!!!!!\nIf they do that I'm sending them my ex-wife's insurance record to prove how wrong they are!
if women were that pathetic... then they obviously wouldn't had been soldiers or able to drive! The fact some women do become generals and able to drive means it shows you that women can do it! Men causes the most crimes then women? Does this mean we should kill all men? No lol!
great they just doubled the chances for car bombers over there...  now we're gonna start seeing twice as many attacks on tv....
That won't last long! Can they rape a car?
A step in the wrong direction for the developing world.. ‚òπ
hhhhh harm woman ovaries,stupid religious men can not see woman as a human being that the truth!!!!!!!
In the Driver's license all the woman would look the same with the barka on.....lol
Allah will destroy you all now ! You have gone against his law ! Oh , wait , there is no god , i forgot.
America seems to support Saudi Arabia, who dislikes America, but Iran has encouraged women to drive for decades and appreciates and strives for peace with America. ¬†Why does America always fight the wrong people for the wrong reasons?
Well now i'll see what people have to say about saudi. Ahhh i love the gulf arab statesüòçüòç. I hate journalism these days...so poor and unprofessional.
Freaking we will regret it big time. Women are stupid as fuck when they drive LMAO. Witnessed it during my 7 years scholarship in the US.
#Trump2020
Wow, this is HUGE!
Sigh... i expect sooo many car accidents
Saudi government must make a separate lanes for women\nWe all know how women drive cars
Happy Independence day Women
Fucking backwards pos mysogynistic culture!
Omg

All of you you are stupid and whoever watch the fucks news is stupid. One maniac stupid person said driving effects woman ovaries 4 years ago and you go wipe all saudis with the same brush. Thats plain stupid.
ALLAHU AKBAR! Allah is so Loving that he let women drive now. Now women can go shopping for husband without husband having to get up off couch and stop eat kebab flavor potato chip! FUCKING YEAH! 'RABIA
Nice job SA! Welcome to 1926!
Before they used to say saudi women cant vote saudi arabia is a backward country then women started voting,then they said women cant drive saudi arabia is a backward country, now women cant drive whats next?
omg please don't¬†let ¬†Women¬† drive.The Horror
This is not freeing women!. Next send your women out to work then take of your Islamic dress and then have haram sex then go to night clubs and then they will get you to leave Islam!!! Next they going to get them to leave Islam. Dajjal
hahahhahahahahahaha
wow..
You do know we have personal drivers right? And your telling me we are backwards üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Head of the religious fatwas Sheikh Saad Al Hajari SAID Women not equal to men, have OLY quarter of a brain, and don't deserve to drive.  So don't do it Saudi Arabia or ur men with full brain will be jobless & useless.. Haha....
But please DONT let them vote!!!
Ladies & Gentlemen,\n\nIt is time for Saudi people to be opened to the World because many countries want to invest there and also we foreigners ask to the Saudi government to have freedom of religion, speech, press, think, drive, fuck without being married and many earth things.
CAMEL NINJAS CAN DRIVE NOW WOW
Hi there! I'm a 24 years old Saudi gentleman \nfor the ones who say welcome to the 20th century I would like to say thank u so much we wish u all the best in life as will as in the afterlife
Insurance is about to go up LOL
The first five years of Car Insurance in Saudi Arabia is a nice business opportunity.\nCan't wait for the dashcam videos to hit YouTube. \nIt will be better than the Russian car accidents.
Yeah, only problem, if they run a red light they get stoned to death.

That's really great news to hear. It is a new positive start for every Saudi women. I hope that 2030 will lead to a new prosperous era.
When we are going to see American women not used as objects in magazines and porn American movies...etc
my favorite way to visualize a woman driving is them locking the brakes while sliding on ice about to hit the rear of another vehicle while gripping the wheel and saying what'do i do?!? and then...BAM! so she gets out and immediately starts texting on her phone.
Many men now mock and say that it is impossible for their women or drive \nBUT wake up it is 21 century \nWomen drive and it is not the end of the world \nThey will learn and everything will be fine
who want suck my dick? CNN or Fox news? one of them I will choose
Glad to see Islam is reforming.
Must be ISIS, new way to mass murder, allow women to drive.
Buckle up.
üëâ THIS IS #FakeNews!!!\nüëâ NO #MUSLIM MAN WILL ALLOW THEIR WIVES, DAUGHTERS, SISTERS TO DRIVE!!!
By the way, I am from Saudi Arabia and I think that the decision is not useful because every Saudi family have their own drivers
I would like to apologize to those who are deaf and/or hard of hearing.\nThe end of the video was NOT captioned, I don't know how it got past at least 3 other people in review but it did.\nI've fixed them now, so you can watch with corrected captions now.

You guys are so great! I've been following you all for 3 years and I love watching your food adventures. Recently I found out I have adult food allergies, like last week, and all the food I love is no longer allowed (like soy, corn, rice, oats, chicken, and wheat as well as anything derived from these products). It's a dream of mine to travel abroad but I'm scared I won't be able to get around with all my allergies. Would you ever consider going to an allergies free place, if it exists? you guys rock my socks thanks!
I haven't watched ya guys in forever... when did Simon have that large of a head
I want to see what you guys think of Korea town in Shinokubo!
post some bad food videos! I want to see some food that aren't good in Japan for a change!
Fuck me. Im OV but didnt know about the the title. This will make it easier searching for recipes.
Yummm! I've been waiting for the vegan Ramen video! So glad you finally found one that made the cut. My favorite vegan restaurant is in Winter Park, Florida and it's called Vegan Caf√©. They have the BEST menu filled with yumminess from Summer special Bean Burritos to Hawaiian Pizza. Sooo good!!
As someone who's Fodmap AND doesn't eat pork I teared up when I saw they had OV. I never knew it was a thing over there :O Time to go back to Japan for a third time! :D
why do I watch this when I'm in a hurry and have no time to fix breakfast?!
There is a vegan ramen shop in melbourne called Neko Neko (Cat Cat) on Gertrude Street. The place is cute with many references to cats and the ramen is awesome!
Yes I have been there. It was freaking awesome!!!!
TAKE BACK THE NIGHT!!!
Bwahahaha! üòÇ Poor Simon.... ü§£
Do people cater to gluten allergies there?
Liking this video just for the 'Simon is too big...Simon is too hot...Simon is too whiny segment üòÇüòÇüòÇ
why do you guys delete videos of places you don't like?? shouldn't you show the good and the bad?
is there a vegetarian place tho ... give me the eggs at least AHHHHHHHH eggs please ....omg and no garlic TT
I'm still waiting patiently for the Japanese bakery video. My favorite is Gebacken in Kyoto. Love ya, Simon and Martina!
Ate Ramen while I watched this
Please do more vegan/ vegetarian food vids in Japan!!!
Vegan is definitely not blan or boring that was totally a misconception I had üòâ Thanks for giving vegan food a try!
@sharmander @taylorr you should visit this place :)
I absolutely adore your videos! I'm glad you guys came back to make videos!!
They also have vegan ramen at t's tin tin in tokyo station!
I‚Äôm so happy you did a vegan video! I have not been able to get into your videos sense going vegan!
Not on my Christian app
Vegan food is soooo good!  Glad you know it now. lol
Can you guises do more videos about OV food? Or midnight cooking the divine pickles you two love? üíú
While I'm sure it's delicious, my favorite part of ramen is the eggs, so I'll probably just stick to the non vegan version, lol but i definitely have friends i might have to recommend this to!
Awesome that you don't promote places that you dont like. I think oriental vegetarian is the same as Jain vegetarian (milk is allowed strange, but no potatoes) im also pretty sure soy meat (daizuniku) is the same as TVP (textured vegetable protein)
I'm hungry now
I hope the chef is going to move to London.
It was meant to be - I'm heading to Japan in little over 2 weeks and I've been thinking abt searching around for some ramen I could eat as I'm vegetarian - and guess what - we are freaking staying 1km away from that restuarant! ahahahahaha thank you for showing this, I will go there for sure.
who can Roman be vegan Roman it's  almost rice as it ia
Oh god this was such a great video. The sweat rag was hilarious
Post some of the footage from places you guys hated! I think that would be hilarious to see what foods you didn‚Äôt like. Throw back to old school Korean toast video XD
NO!!!! STOP RUINING FOOD VEGANS!!!!!! GO BACK AND EAT YOUR TREES!
Vegans aren't making a difference in the world
It.Looks.Amazing! I miss ramen so much, I just moved to Miami FL from Vancouver BC and the thing I miss the most is ramen!! I have not found any ramen restaurants yet ;___:
if they dont like eggs then they should try fake eggs from china
Can you guys do an updated how to eat ramen like a pro ???
You can tell how healthy the oil is by the colour of it.\n\nWoah.
You delete the videos of restaurants you didn't like? That used to be one of the great aspects of FAPFAP, the Korean cheese toast place was an awesome episode.
Thank you so much for uploading a video like this, now i feel hopeful to find a vegan/vegetarian place in Japan.
God I want some good vegan ramen. I settle for pho, because we have a lot of Vietnamese restaurants around here. A significant lack of ramen places, though. :(
May I know what kind of phone casing is Martina using, 1:07? Is it available on Amazon?
Simon an Martinez really you guess remind me and my boyfriend of us. We also giggles in happienss when you post sweats and pastries! So those are our favorites üòäüòäüòäüòáüòáüòòüòçüòö I also share pain maybe not as much as you but I share that feeling of depression and other pain. I understand you don't like pitty party's I do not either they make it hard to get out of the black hole of sadness that is every day. .. So seriously you can't die not yet not by your own cute adorable hands because everyone like us who has pain. We were born for a reason that reason is to feel all life has to give us in return for the suffering.  Even if it's not a good day there will be one and seeing you strive on inspires me not to hit the K.O button on this game of life... So please push on and hope to meet you one day.  Even if I have to fly all the way to Japan to just get to meet you I will. :') I love you Mar-Mar please don't stop being Kawaii and living. And *hugs and baths* for all the bad days!.....(seriously I mean it... You inspire me)... Ugh I am a dork and this was maybe the wrong way to get in touch but I watch every upload even if it takes weeks I do.... Cause I am stuck inside most days... So yeah lol love you lots üòç
You guys help me to imagine the good taste of the ramen. The cold is killing my sense of taste. xD
I eat meat, yet I want to eat vegan ramen now.\n\nI'm wondering though, is it possible to make vegan ramen wrong?
Thank you for making a video for vegans!!!! Much appreciated
Nothing vegan is good except for straight fruits and vegetables. Fuck vegans.
Such a great chef. The food looks delicious and I am on a fast :)
Simon has to get used to using the folding fan. In Japan it is normal.
Still waiting for the peach video... so I watched the ad before the video.
Thank you so much! I love it!
Simon is getting better at pinching food with Japanese chop-sticks and used to Japanese life style such as towel handkerchief. Also eating noodles with putting them on spoon is good manner for those who feel hesitation to slurp.
im suddenly reminded of that time when martina lost a game and threw simon's cupcake on the wall lol
Hey Martina :) is there any possibility to get some pictures of your feet? I would pay for them!
Vegan Ramen is AMAZING. It's my new favorite.  Try it. ;)
YAY FOR BEING VEGAN and actually caring about the worldüòÇüòÇ
Please try the limited edition Halloween cola secret flavor in Japan üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
If its halal ramen places, I can name a few good ones:\nShinjuku Gyoen Ramen Ouka\nHalal Ramen and Dining Honolu (their Ebisu shop)\n\nT's tantan is also good! And also the vegan curry at Coco Ichiban's. I've also heard Coco Ichiban recently serves halal curry at their Akihabara location, but I haven't been there yet.\nsince I'm a Muslim student living in Tokyo, finding eat outs that I can go guilt-free has become a (slightly expensive) pastime.
love your earrings Martina!
yes! Please more videos like this :D love more FapFap style  videos. Gah I miss FapFaps, eat your sushi segments, WTFs and TLDRs :(
Wow the place has halal ramen too? Amaziingg
Burn it
Nope.
Isn't Coco curry always applicable XD
Awesome!  Do more vegan/veggy places üòÑ
Answer: Fuck no
Vegan Ramen üò§üòê boi just eat the fucking meat
You mean Raman noodles
your earrings are so cute martina! ‚ú®
SO PUMPED

Soy meat is delicious!!

Dump the ramen crap, whole grains please
Thanks for sharing!

Boi dis shit looks like normal noodles
You guys make videos you don't publish? How often does it happen that you don't enjoy a restaurant that you review?
what video program do you use for your youtube videos?
Actual question. Is vegan anything really good? Answer- no.
#40 on trending?! Whaaaat
well I still love you no matter what you eat  I personally am against Veganism for the sake of it if it for religious reasons I can get behind it  but my point is we all eat we all consume  we are on the top of the food-chain  .. I have met some really laid back chill Vegan, and Vegetarians that are really cool people  who do  not judge me for my food choices and I have nothing but warm fuzzies for them   I just wish everybody would do that when it comes to it because food is about  community and cherishing your neighbor ... I love you guys and your message so please keep doing what you are doing
Trending on YouTube in UK 47ahhhhhüòÅüòÅüëèüëèüëèüëèwell done guysüòÅ
CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO NOTICE HOW BEAUTIFUL JAPAN IS?? AND THE GORGEOUS PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN IT? üíïüíï
As a vegan this really raises my hopes for travels to Japan! And also I'm thrilled that Simon eats ramen the same way I do - noodles onto spoon
wait, you dont upload things you dont like?
i feel like I've seen this video before... have you done a sneak peek of it?
I've been suscribed for some years now it makes me really, REALLY happy when I see you guys go to vegetarian/vegan places and enjoy the food :) as I am a longtime vegetarian/recent vegan. Keep it up guys and lots of love from Mexico!
Fuck, I have to go to Japan!!!!!!! I envy my cousin since she works for a Japanese Airline üò¢ but I hate airplanes üò™
Not all Vegan Ramen are good üíÅ i have a Ramen store around the corner , it belongs to a Russian guy that lived 30 years in Japan and he knows how to make really good japanese food. He also has Vegan Noodles but they are very stiff. Also his Vegan broth is tastes like Miso soup and is very boring. The normal beef/pork soup is very good even without chunks of meat so it is ~kinda vegetarian for those who dont like meat textures. However vegans will always say sth is delicious even if its hidious üòÇ
Running out of topics? Ramen review....again! How come no episodes with Japanese people about differences/similarities, pop culture subjects (manga, fashion, anime, movies), onsens, talks with other expats, etc....
VEGAN FOOD IS TERRIBLE!\nVirtue signaling liars.
is there a food you dont like ??
holy shit this looks freakin perfect! im saving the info,thank you for the review üòö
Yay! Vegan things on trending videos üå±üíö
yay you guys are on trending! :)
Short answer no. Anything vegan SUCKS
Olans back! Yeehaa!ü§£ you should tell your storys on stage as standupüòã

Wether or not his stories are true they are always funny üòÇüòÇ
Similar thing happened to my sister. One day people just kept calling her and wishing her a happy birthday, when it wasn't her birthday. Someone even called her from jail to wish her a happy birthday.. One of them left a voice message singing happy birthday, in the style of Marilynn Monroe singing to the president.
Romania calls me all the time! I'm in a mid western state in the United States
You're my friend Drew Harrison's boss now! #sodaparlorvibes
I love you so much, Olan. Best YouTuber, hands down. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è And this story is so relatable. Before I switched numbers, I got calls from hotels, insurance companies, debt collectors, scam galore, and the worst was the constant calls for some Robin Walker chick. She also owed a lot of money üòÇ
When I got my first phone, I kept on and kept on getting messages from people in pretty much every state asking if Paul could confirm various transactions or statements, or, a bit later, very concerned messages asking if he had gotten back from his trip yet. I was like: ‚ÄúWow... I think Paul probably got fed up with his mundane, money-counting life and went on vacation to never come back. Good for you, Paul. Go see the world.‚Äù
I watched this at 10:00pm and I had to plug my nose I was laughing so hard and tears we're welling up in my eyes..  HALLARIOUS üòÇ üòÇ
I freakin' Home Aloned the guy! I'M DEAD.....
This is totally a memphis thing. I've had my 901 number for about 10 years and i get sooo many wrong number calls
Low key an ad for PayPal
These make my day. X3
I remember one time I got called by a random number and I kept telling her she had the wrong number then she said no, I got the right number I kept insisting that she didn't dial the right number, then she told me my number and asked me if that was MY number, so I freaked out, hung up, and blocked her, for some reason I kept getting calls from a bunch of people I didn't know
Oh my freakin god, Olan!!! I haven't laughed that hard in a while. This story was so hilarious that I actually started crying from the laughter. I just completely lost it at the part when you put the phone up to the TV while watching Jurassic Park. You're awesome and I always love your stories. Please don't stop telling them.
And then Marcus actually watches this video... xD
XD
I LOVE YOU
funniest since ghost in the stalls lol
This is amazing
This was AMAZING You're going to be the best Dad and Grandad EVER! I always loved to hear my grandad's story's and you remind me of (a much younger version of) him :D Good luck on Final Space sir!
This one was of my favorites...thank you so much, Olan. You never cease to make me sooo happy
This is better then my game of phones story lol
Tennessee Wonderchild, I knew you existed. TAKE THAT, AA

After allllll these years, his videos have stayed the same. He's never changed. Amazing YouTuber. Amazing man.
I started silent laughing as soon as he unmute the TV. Couldn‚Äôt breathe for a second. I‚Äôm okay now...Incase anyone was wondering üòÇüò≠
Promise me one thing hit the text books. Haha.
I'm so happy your back
It's been so long since we've seen you! This was the first time I've laughed in over four months.
holy mother of a boiling spoonful of salt these stories are the epitome of hilarity.
This video was sponsored by PayPal
Ahhh, missed yo face O! The story was a bit of a stretch for me :/...just wasn't feeling it personally, but it's good to see/hear from you...It's been a while, yeah...it's a been while. #GITS
Oh my god this is brilliant!!!! XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD XD
Some random person in jail called my cell phone TWICE! Thank god I was busy and didn't answer, the automated system left me voice mails. üò≤
You never cease to me make me laugh til my tummy hurts. You truly crack me up! Thank you, Olan, for sharing  your crazy life experiences with us. :)
I just want you to know... you're my hero. My girlfriend very strongly believes that you are my spirit animal. Just thought you should know.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST BLOCK HIM!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!
Jack Black? You look so young!
It‚Äôs about time you came out with a new story Bro!!!
I NEEDED A STORY SO BADLY TODAY. I've got an awful cold and an exam next week and crap tons of homework and I just really needed something to take my mind off it all and smile about. Thanks so much Olan!!
Straight up, my name is Donovan and I kept hearing you say my name and I sorta got super stoked. He knows me omg how do I social
did you purposely match your shirt to your bed?
How is it that despite going months between telling stories, it doesn't feel like it's been that long? There must be some sort of strange temporal distortion going on here. Are Starscream and TARDIS messing with the timeline?
You don't mess with the Tennessee Wonder Child and if you do, your name is probably Marcus
OlanRogers you are the funniest person I have ever heard. Hey and good job with the songs
I'm more glad that this man was born
I'm so glad your back! I've missed story time!!!!
Bless
Dude I love youüòÇüòÇ
OMG Love it! Amazing storyteller sir! Bravo
DED
6:05 why tho? IM CRYING
It's been too dang long
I have wanted someone to call me over and over again for this very reason.
Incredible story, once again, Olan.  Thanks for the laughs
This was fantastic! It might surpass Ghost in the Stalls in my opinion but they're both so hilarious it's hard to say!
For someone's name who is Donevin myself, its very rare to hear my name anywhere. Also I had a similar experience, some guy maybe around his 50's called me on my cellular device, and told me Now litsen here mother f****, you better be ready because we're about to roll up on your block. I was just appalled because someone was being threatened that wasnt me. The only response that came out in my confusion was ok. Then he proceeds to say Do you know who this is!!! Im over here just thinking I sure hope not. So I decide to yell back at him  Do you know who this is!! And he says no, who is this? Then I respond in a very calm like matter, Not who you think this is. The only thing that comes out of his mouth is .....oh. Then I tell him yeah wrong number man and he hung up. Im not sure who this man was or whose street he was going to roll down but I sure hope its on a decline hill so he may roll into the sunset forever embarrassed by his wrong number phone call.
I. Have. Been. Waiting. So. Long. For. This. YES
When Olan starts laughing so hard that he starts choking... that gets me more than the story does every time üòÇüòÇüòÇ
W E R E B E A R S
When you live in Tennessee :') I'm shOOk

Peeps, junior It looks for me like really   fur  job evolve   ! !
Chinese small is usually a UK size 6, CN M = UK 8, CN L = UK 10, CN XL = UK 12, CN XXL = UK 14, CN 3XL = UK 16, CN 4XL = UK 18, CN 5XL = UK 20, etc etc!
excuse me but did she ever say if this ia a wig or she relaxed her hair?
they aren't the same websites, Romwe uses a lot of the same designers as sites like soaesthetic and SheIn - so SheIn could have sold some of their own designs on Romwe.
your videos make my day ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
wear the grandma doily sweater with a high-waisted leather skirt.
Love your videos and personality!!!!!
Can you review JJ's House :D just evening dresses or something :))
can you do www.shoppriceless.com please!
Lol, you are hilarious.  As a dancer, you learn which is the front and back of a garment without neck tags.  Secret: when the garment tag is on the inside-left side of the garment, that's the front.
Romwe is actual shit. Has some good stuff but I bought 10 articles and 3 of that fit me
Shein and Romwe are actually the same company. Shein does the wholesale part as for romwe doesnt. If you want wholesale, romwe will redirect you to sheinwholesale email.

Patricia you're killing with these videos üòÇüòÇmy kids come running when they hear your voice on the TV, they think you're funny üòçüòçüòçso I started a channel and we will see if they think mommy is funny tooüòÇüòÇ
I am a budget fashion blogger and been contacted by both brands to work with. Worked with Shein first, then the ROMWE package came in the exact same branded company packaging and even though the PR sign off with different names the wording is pretty much identical like they have a standard set email reply. So I'm 80% sure that same company. Different branding Charlee \nAlso would love a wardrobe tour.
Can you do a haul on pretty little things and miss pap please??
Iv'e got a feeling Rome, shein and Zaful are the same sight

I'm an OG LustreLux follower, and I love your videos.  That is all. Oh! And your background is dope.
THE BACKGROUND HAS ME SHOOK THOUGH
Katy what lash glue are you using , I have really sensitive eyes and I've tried a bunch üò©
Love this look especially the purple vibes you have going on love the @Katy sign to lol
love the new background!
Does anyone know what brush she uses to blend out her concealer? Pls help
Love your background! I hate to admit it but I only found your channel recently ( your smashbox trip introduced me to you) but i am so happy I did!!
I live for the bloopers lol
Loved the entire look, but really loved the eye look. Different than what most have done. üòçüëÅüòç Have to get my hands on that palette. üòç
Your background is everything üñ§
the matching stick are quite hard to work on, i didn't like it myself def going to return it :/
If u want a no makeup makeup look but your actually using products try the no makeup makeup line from perricone md! I love it!
@KATY
No fuego?! ü§î no over the top?! üò≠ lol üòÇ \nLoved the look, I've seen plenty of looks and I def need this palette in my life üòç you're just so pretty!!

You literally look like this emoji ü§î when contemplating the concealer stick üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇlike your facial expression is that exact emoji and you should talk to Kim about your face being the contemplating face for KIMOJIs
Jonye's commentary gives me life üòÇüòÇüòÇ
You never do basic looks, their always so different, artsy, and editorialüòªüî•
You should try the First Aid beauty skin tint for the no makeup makeup!
what was the concealer brush she used when she was buffing her shape tape concealer?
Blinking Beaute is based out of the Bay Area!
I love the moment when you are trying to decide whether you like the matte highlight stick! Hmmm hmmmm hmmmm lol
Your background gives me Bangerz vibes, I love it!
THE BEST FOUNDATION FOR oily skin hands down ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
I wish you would start video bare faced , I like to be surprised with the look üòÇüòò .. loving the Katy neon light üòä
I grabbed a sample of it because I'm not really huge on matte foundations and it looked really nice on the skin but after wearing it a week straight it was just ehhh for me. I feel the same way about my Dior forever foundation. If it ain't dewy I don't want it üôÖüèΩ it's not bad, but it's not my fav. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
THAT NAME IN THE BACK THO IM DYING
No Makeup Makeup: Extended Cut\n\nMaybe the it Cosmetics cc cream? I use that a lot. Nice for no makeup days.

I think the Foundation looks very very nice on you..üòçüòçüòçüòéüòéüòéüòé
Love the Katy sign back there. Not a Huda fan since she does not promote women of color
Love this video!! What I like to do with the matchsticks is use my regular concealer that matches my skin and then I use the concealer stick to highlight a little and it works nicely on my skin. Maybe that could help?
THE KATY SIGN FROM THE UD COACHELLA HOUSE THOO! IF YOU REMEMBER THAT VLOG YOURE PROBABLY JUST AS OBSESSED WITH KATY AND DESI AS I AM üòÇ
What morphe brush do you use to buff out the concealer under the eye?
So if this is Katy putting hot new sh*t on her face, is this Katy getting sh*t faced? ü§î
Not even 5 minutes in but I love joons commentary
what *is* the standard primer you use?
100% castor oil works like a dream for your brows and eyelashes!!! You'll see results after a month.. üëåüèº doesn't sound convincing but I promise it works hahaha
This background is perfect!! ü¶Ñ
Video title for no makeup vid: SOME MAKEUP MAKEUP

I love this background!!! Also please do the kind of no make up make up look!! Those are my favorite and you always look stunning. Also, another video idea! A video about undereyes!! I feel like I have the exact same issues u have, kinda dry and have dark circles exactly like yours. Know you love bye bye undereye but can't really afford it. So would be awesome to hear your favorite drug store options ans also like skin care u think helps u most.  Just an idea but I'm sure alot of us could beneift from your knowledge! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
The setup is gorgeous
very chic
So pretty !!
Come all the way through ssssamanthaa blinking beaut lash!

Do any of you babes know the Morphe brush number that Katy uses allll the time to buff Concealer in?? I can never find a video where she says the number ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®
the green plants + pink chair + blue shirt look so aesthetically pleasing and SO NICE
I don't think 16 shirts makes you a t-shirt hoarder at all! You love to wear them, so it makes total sense to have a few of them (and again, 16 is not like a huge amount!). For me it seems absolutely fine to keep all of them, doing some kind of rotation system, or, if you really want to reduce, keep track of wich ones you wear the least ( and if those are the ones designed by your friends, or having some other sort of emotional value, make something else out of them! Like framing one like a picture, or sewing a t-shirt-quilt (i did that, it's awesome!)) Loved the video, please keep us updated! xx
Do you actually /need/ to get down to fewer than 16 t-shirts? Maybe you do because of limited storage, but I don't think you should put yourself through the stress of getting rid of something you love and do wear just for the sake of achieving an ideal number.
YES LUCY! This video is literally like porn for me X
A channel that you might like all about fashion, focusing particularly on capsule wardrobes is Justine Leconte Official. She's a french fashion designer and her videos are super duper helpful!!
I'm currently working on refining my wardrobe ~ I'm slowly donating or passing onto friends (my local charity shops love me üòÜ). Autumn is just about a big oversized orangey - maroon jumper with black skinny jeans or leggings and a black or burgandy pinafore with tights and boots for me.
Your bullet journal is so nice!
yesssss! more fashion videos! I live for these, I love your fashion sense so much!
Lucy you should do some bullet journal videos!! Like monthly spreads and plan with me and stuff ‚ú®üíò
I make all of my own clothes because that avoids the human exploitation/sweatshop element of lots of popular brands, and also makes me think carefully about what I really need. This season I'm making black jeans, a grey blazer and a colourful blazer, a nice black shirt, and some leggings for layering.
you should do a giveaway with your tshirts that you know 100% you won‚Äôt ever wear
YESSS LOVE IT - capsule wardrobe planning has been such a long process for me (i started about two years ago and I'm trying to curate an all year round capsule wardrobe that works for all seasons) just because I'm super hesitant to buy things and tend to buy just a few things a year. Also in the past two years I've learnt a lot more about my style and realised that ultimately I need to dress in clothes that I feel good in not clothes that I think will impress other people, so I'm not done yet...but I'm getting there! Can't wait to see how yours turn out, I LOVE your style <3
Really like that you planned it out on the paper! I also did a capsule wardrobe video for fall. Check it out if interested :)
I need to do this. I'm moving soon and need to cut down significantly. I have clothes in my wardrobe from 10 years ago and items I've never worn but kept just in case and about 70% don't fit me. I need even less clothing than you do as I wear a uniform to work. So I need 3-4 outfits a week and the rest of the time I'm in pjs. I'm gonna get planning
Try to consider the maintenance of pieces you want to get or pieces you already have. I find it a lot more difficult to wear certain items of clothing because they require more maintenance than some others that get worn almost regularly. \nAnd also, about the 16 t-shirts, just go through and see what really flatters your body type. That applies to all your clothing, anything that doesn‚Äôt flatter or make you comfortable should automatically go into storage, because your daily wear (even formal wear) should be 100% the most comfortable stuff ever ever for you (whether physical or mental comfort).\nCheers üíÉüèº
This makes me want to go out charity shopping, which I love doing. I may use the excuse of 'needing black work trousers' to go do some soon!
I love your comments about mom jeans because I thought I was fooling myself into thinking they were just not suited to my body. Ahh I feel so much better now!!
lovely video but i'm just lowkey crying because here is Spring not autumn
Hey people, would you mind checking out @ThinkingOfThing on Twitter? My goal is just to make this dreary world a bit more positive :))\nThanks so much xx
Great advice! Shop currentandcompany.us to find high-quality, affordable pieces for your capsule wardrobe!
I started this process last night! So timely!!
i swear if i had more money/freedom i'd be drowning in socks, jumpers, skirts, sundresses, sneakers and i'd have a wide brim hat that's actually big enough for my damn head
you said scarfs at one point  - are there styles or colors that you're gravitating to there? winter is coming ;-)
Can you do another bullet journal video?
I love your style! I am someone who also tries to keep my wardrobe down to versatile items but there are one pieces I own which are fancier and can only be used for nice events but I love them so I don't mind that they are less versatile! You do you, I don't think it's a bad thing to have lots of tshirts if you love them- just store them away because you might regret getting rid of them in the future‚ò∫Ô∏è
Storing some of the t-shirts sounds like a great idea. That really appeals to me because rotating them out rather than downsizing outright should help them all last longer, which has started to become an issue for me in the last couple of years. So for t-shirts, I think it makes a lot of sense...because you can wear them, preserve them, and have a streamlined everyday wardrobe, all at the same time.\n\nI definitely need to downsize my wardrobe, but most of that is things that don't fit but I really want to fit into again sometime in the future. And things that are redundant from living at uni _and_ at home.... I think this might actually help me? Which is just unexpected because I'm not a woman and I don't really buy clothes. ^^;;
For tshirts, something that I have done (which isn't for everyone) is made them into a quilt! My friend took my shirts and made them into squares then makes the back out of fleece and for me it's the perfect mix of keeping sentimental shirts but paring down my clothes
I wear a uniform for work, and work three to four days a week. on days I work I dont do anything else (ie, no need for real people clothes on those days) so I really only need 3-4 outfits for every season. realizing that was pretty much life changing.
How do you accidentally buy something?
Love this! Planning my capsule wardrobe nowüòÇ x
if you like capsule wardrobe and fashion channels i recommend justine leconte. She is a french designer who makes quick and concise videos about fashion and one of her series is about capsule wardrobes.
Oh my gosh! WHERE is the pink coat from? ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Have you considered making something like a quilt out if your t shirts you adore but don't necessarily want to wear constantly? Like a t shirt quilt or tapestry? Combine textures and other squares that go with your t shirts into a quilt type thing to snuggle with or hang in a room? Just a thought!
please do a lookbook once you have it organised x
Damn trending Lucy!!!! Wooooo, such a great video so highly deserved x
Could you do a video abt fuckboys part II? im living for those
It would mean the world to me if your could subscribe to my channel!! Xx üòò
Pls pls pls can I beat my brother In a bet and get 100 subs in 2 days xxx
i'm debating whether or not to treat myself to a new pair of doc martens next month... my current pair are over five years old and were mistreated throughout high school, so there are holes in the heels and the leather is all cracked. i'd love a new pair but i'm not sure i'll wear them enough to justify their cost, especially considering they can't function as my winter boots because it's way too cold and snowy where i live. we'll see whether or not i get them lol. i also need to go through my clothes again and be harsh in getting rid of things i don't wear and that don't fit me. i've gained like 20 pounds in the last two years so i have a lot of old jeans and shirts that don't fit at all but are still in my dresser taking up space. that'll be a task for.... whenever i have some time to kill, which lbr is a rarity for a uni student who also has a part time job
A big mistake a lot of people make when doing capsules is that they discard items that do not fit into their capsules. If you are not feeling hot pink right now - put them away and in february, check if you are feeling them for early spring, for example. If you like an item but it does not fit into your capsule *right now*, it might in a year or 5. I bougth a pair of trousers in 2014 that fit perfectly with my FW17/18 capsule... It takes time to find what fits you so you are bound to experiment along the road.
i love this video & i don't really know why
Hi Lucy! I have a few questions :) when you build a capsule wardrobe, does it work for all seasons? or is it like okay this is my capsule wardrobe for winter and this my wardrobe for spring? I've seen people limiting themselves to a number of pieces (like 52, 30) and I don't know if shoes are counted in too. Loved the video, I'm looking forward to the next one! :)
I used to exclusively wear jeans as bottoms, but then I watched Begin Again and Keira Knighley's effortless and supercool way to pull off smarter trousers opened my eyes to a whole new world. Check it out, Lucy!
where's that gorgeous pink coat from?!üòç
With the T-shirts, have a weekly or fortnightly rotation. You'll find you wear those you often don't reach to more often without having to scale the collection down!
If I have too many items that I love but they won't all fit in one wardrobe rotation, I store them then at the beginning of the next season I'll swap out the ones I really love, and if there's any I'm not keen on wearing/haven't worn at all THEN I'll donate them, that way I know I won't wear them and I feel less guilty about it :)
Who says you can't wear all black all the time? lol. \nThis is a neat idea. I'll be interested to see the final result!
Lucy be careful of making rules for yourself. It's your wardrobe, if you want a secret 3 bright pink things, then do that. There's no rules if you think about it.
bro i couldn't get my eyes of her frickin lips i feel like a bird ~sHi~Ny~~
Lucy, I tend to have the exact same problem with wanting to keep sentimental t-shirts. Sadly, because I have a shorter torso, normal shaped t-shirts look really weird on me because they are either too long or too bunchy, so I never get around to wearing them. But I still really want to preserve those memories. Ive found online that some people turn their old t-shirts into quilts! You can still enjoy all of the memories associated with them without having to actually wear them. Maybe that is a possible solution to your t-shirt problem?
PLEASE do a look book
I get if you want to wear them, but you could always frame a t-shirt or two that your friends designed.
i think you're putting unnecessary pressure on yourself about the amount of things you can have. i'm the same way with my tshirts, and that's ok. if it's something that brings you joy, or you feel good in, or means something to you... keep it! and don't pack them away! you love them and you'll wear them, so they get to stay. don't worry about it so much.
i have the same problem with t-shirts! i have so many that have sentimental value to me and for that reason i'm not willing to part with them, but at the same time i don't wear them as much as a person with a ton of shirts should! i've been thinking of making a t-shirt quilt out of them, bc that way it's clearing out my closet, but i still get to keep the t-shirts around in a useful way.
If you could get someone to send them to you, I feel like you could live in these pants https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-italian-goweave-easy-pant-black?collection=womens-bottoms
This video has inspired me to do something about the explosion of clothes in my room, so thank you! haha Also I love the way you organised the whole thing starting with what you regularly do and what outfits you need for those things and going from there. Maybe I will reach that point in my organisational skills someday lol
Have you considered making a t-shirt quilt? You still get to keep the designs and the memories they bring without having them take up much room in your closet
It's 30+ degrees weather over here in Toronto dont ask me how
Not a very interesting video,
I have Nathan Zeds good enough t-shirt in the post too üòÇ
your style is absolutely stunning, you inspire me so much
is a jumper like a sweatshirt/sweater?
if you love them keep them! It's all about having stuff you love and will actually use, not just getting your wardrobe down to a specific number.
u should put some of th ones u dont rlly wear on depop !!!
Fab video! I feel like it would be a bit more engaging if you did some b roll of what you're talking about & the process!\nLoved the video and I hope there's more capsule ones to come xx
I would recommend to be flexible about the item number or pieces. If you really like and use tshirts you don't need to get rid of them just to fit in the capsule wardrobe standard. This is a really marvelous concept but I think one should adapt it to it's own needs and taste. Good luck!
It's so refreshing to see a practical take on reconfiguring a wardrobe/closet! I had to do this when I started my job several years ago and now I like to think shopping is a matter of plugging in holes and thinking carefully before making purchases (my impulse only seem to be things I've stalked for months or years).\n\nI also have had your problem regarding the fit of pants and jeans and learned that a good tailor completely solved the problem so am so happy you've sent some stuff off! I had the same gaping waist/sagging crotch issue and the tailor made them fit perfectly each time. It's annoying that so many pants/jeans seem to be constructed in a way that do not accommodate normal hips, but I'm grateful to have a good and decently priced tailor around. A good cobbler is also life changing for maintaining shoes and boots!
Not to give away my secrets but if you want recommendations light before dark is THE place for semi casual trousers
I love the idea of a capsule wardrobe but it seems like so much work, plus I'm at university so I have zero money for clothes. Your capsule wardrobe so so nice, you should some fashion videos once you get it all sorted. X
Since you have good music taste, what's your opinion about this good track, Lucy Moon?\nThe Midnight - Crystalline\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4iLX7eWwmE
i think with your t-shirt problem you could keep them all at least for a while and even switch them up during the 3 month capsule cycle. this way it might help if you ever get the feeling you want to buy a new t-shirt. cause then you can just go the ones you already own and switch things up. even old stuff feels like new when it's been out of your sight for awhile. after awhile i'm sure you'll notice if there are ones that you never really feel like including into your capsule. and then it might be easier to get rid of those.
wow i'm such a  t-shirt hoarder as well üò© this vid has kinda inspired me to do a t-shirt clear out this week hahah
I just love people talking about style/clothes
I got so many jumpers on new looks sale page! have a look :)
Could we switch parts of our wardrobe, I have WAY too many jumpers (around 20...) but not that many basic t-shirts.
if your looking for good quality more affordable jumpers try pull and bear x
I really like the way you structured this video. The information is specially well divided and chosen in this one. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I so bloody appreciated it.
Love it! So captivated by the idea of a capsule wardrobe... thinking I might need to give it a go!? xoxo, Caylie
100% backing this idea!! It's so good for the environment and your creativity üíï also, can't wait for hauls and lookbooks. And I would recommend a cashmere jumper as one of your three purchases, they are a god send üôåüèª
omg but where is the pink coat from??
Yesss I really needed this! Looking forward to the next video :)
First I want to say I LOVE YOUR T-SHIRT!!!!1 I just brought myself a pinafore and im in love with it!!!! \nAlso, id love to see an overview of your bullet journal!!!
Excited for the sequal of whatever this is :)
Try the pureple app, its a wardrobe app, you add photos of your clothes which helps you keep track of what you own, you can create or be suggested outfits and that helps to see what you actually wear or not, ive had this app for years and i swear by it
I'm sure someone has already said but what about making a blanket out of your excess tshirts? Pinterest will have great examples no doubt!
I've learnt about capsule wardrobing from Justine Leconte (she's an incredible fashion youtuber, definitely recommend) but I've been waiting until summer to do my capsule wardrobe for two reasons: firstly, Australia doesn't really have 4 seasons.... autumn and spring just consists of alternating summer and winter days or weeks (it's not a stable temperature), and secondly, I'll be finished with my uni semester in November so I'll have more time to do it. I also have a new wardrobe which I don't have the space for so when I start sorting through my clothes, I'll ditch my current one (and maybe my clothes rack since I have no space for it) and buy a small chest of drawers.
This has inspired me so, so much to try out a capsule wardrobe. Your tips were so helpful, Lucy. X
I've been working on the same thing! I'm the same way with t-shirts. If they're graphic tees you can hire someone to make you a t-shirt quilt. I had it made with all of my school shirts and memories and things I was holding onto. The back is lined in fleece and it's super cozy! Could be a good way to keep the memories of the shirts but turn them into something new :)
I miss your discussion videos
Want month faves back! <3
Hell yes to period slobbing clothes!
Whats your haircut called ?
Lovely video, Lucy! <3
Lucy üíï‚ú®üå∏
Hey girl! If you're shopping on the high street for mom jeans it's almost impossible to get a good fit, my tip would go vintage or second hand, the quality and fits are way better. I usually go for the men's section and get a levis 504 or 505 but it's really about finding the best shape for you, I'd also size up one or two sizes as the denim is mostly non stretch. Just thought it might be worth a mention because it can be really hard to have jeans tailored in a non obvious way, so excited for this project!!
Does anyone know where the baby pink fur coat is from? I've been looking for one for two years now and this one looks amazing! Thanks for your help :)Great video, Lucy!
If you don't watch The Anna Edit, I highly recommend it. She's got capsule wardrobe down to an art (albeit a pretty expensive one).
get superga's for trainers! v cool but can be formal too xoxo
Slippers for around the house are also the best 10 pound investment that you'll ever make
What's done is doneüíî\n\nGonna miss you guys so much!
Love how limbo panto-esque the name is as well, harkening back to the eras of she purred while I grrrd and Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants
Your split has broken my heart. However this is a great track to drop before the end.
Seeing this pop in my notifications feels like salt in the wound! Still hard to believe they broke up. The crying Boy King illustration is only fitting! :^(\n\nRegardless of it all, I will always love you guys!!!

It sad that we had to wait until you broke up just to listen to another master piece like this one. I'll miss you guys :'(
Today I leasing radio and who's say - it's end of wild bests, this is true?
Glad I was able to see you guys in Baltimore all those years ago! Videos are still on my page. Always remember! Thank you guys for the many great years of music. You were a big part of a good chunk of my life. My 3 year old daughter even knows your music :) best of luck!
Still can‚Äôt believe you guys are splitting up, you‚Äôre the best band in the UK. I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôd end as you guys definitely had so much more to give. Thanks for all your music. X
I'M SO SAD AND YET SO HAPPY OH GOD WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SPLIT
No, Did they split up? But they have to be in my movie, they just don't know it yet...
I still can't get over knowing the next time I see you boys perform will be the last. Thank you for every song you shared with us.
The many songs wildbeasts have made I will always cherish and remember, good luck with your journeys, just wanted to say thank you for your music moving me out of mental health problems when I listened to wanderlust it made me think about my life and it gave me strength, thank you
Immaculate final single.
Nice!
<3 :'(
So Good
It sounds greaaat!
Amazin'
Incredible song as always üòç‚ù§
Farewell guys, gonna miss you
Brilliant song :(
We couldn't go with them, dreamliner
They broke up that's fd up
Lit Boizzz.
Since I've read that they won't be playing together anymore I've been coming to term with the fact that I'll never listen to them live. And seeing this in my subscription box is like a last goodbye. Thank you for being my favorite band since Limbo Panto came out. Enjoined following you on you musical journey. Such an innovative and mature band. It's been a wild ride.
At least bring The Farewell Tour to Mexico, let us enjoy your live music one last time.
They're back!!!!!
Geniales los padres
A Messi le toco bailar con el Maffeo
Que voz tan rica
el marcaje en individiual es una putada para el atacante y el defensor, pero quien haya jugado a futbol sabe que es una opci√≥n m√°s. Igual si no le hubieran marcado as√≠ messi les mete 2 o 3 goles. Al final lo que cuentan son los 3 puntos, y no si juego como me gusta o no
Crack Maffeo porque nunca quiso p√°rarlo apunta de patada \nEn cambio Pepe es mas feo que las ganas de cagar y rajero üòÇüòÇ
QUEDATE CON QUIEN TE CUIDE COMO MAFFEO A MESSI üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Messi no tiene a Deulofeu y entonces le traen a uno mafeo
bien por Mafeo, as√≠ se marca limpiamente y no a patadas
Jugar as√≠ es Maffeo.
Los marcajes individuales es una putada, no le dejas disfrutar al chaval, muy mal Mach√≠s
Los fans de Cristianos son homosexuales reprimidos, lo admiran mas por su altura, su bronceado, sus musculos y por que es guapo.
pues ni yo me le despegar√≠a un segundo
Que le pida la camisa y el aut√≥grafo entonces üòÇüòÇ, que triste la manera de jugar
por qe me encanta su voz?‚ù§
jaja sus papas son geniales xD
Can some one translate in English what the players are saying?
What does this video mean in English??
Messi to man city soon
Me parecio excelente lo de Maffeo,se preparo toda la semana para marcar a Messi y lo logro..ademas no pego una patada,lo anul√≥ hasta donde pudo je.
por fin VIDEO DEL BAR√áA POR FIN
jajajaa
d
¬°Mario sube el camino!
Ojaa viniera al barsa
Y le funcion√≥ por que Messi no marc√≥ aunque igual el Girona perdi√≥ jejeje
Pesiiiii!
Maffeo putoamo :v
Mario sube el camino
Hermoso video.
Maffeo desde colombia te apoyo.. fuerza campeon....
Mario sube el camino
Jajajajaja
Buen Messi üòÇüëëüëèüëèüëè
Ahhhaahhahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahaha
substitle bitches
Zabaleta II
Zorba el griego
Los reportajes parecen novelas jaja
Maffeo tienen que comprarlo
T√∫ eres mi amigo fiel jajajajajajaja
1:11 catacrock .
Jajajaj
City watch = life
Messi, Messi, Messi
Tu voz me da sue√±o ;v
ni as√≠ pudieron ganar
Unos genios los padres. Esa se√±ora tiene mis respetos!
eso es ser profesional...
Pues, si.  Era Messi quien segu√≠a a Pablo a todo lado.\nY hasta quer√≠a su camiseta.\nBravo Pablo. Si fuera tu Abuelo estar√≠a orgulloso de tu buen trabajo.
narraci√≥n mas fea esta. este video no me gusto por eso
Ahora resulta que hay que darle explicaciones a un rival de que seras su marca personal, de verguenza. No me imagino a Maldini, Cannavaro, Ferdinand, Puyol o defensas de anta√±o como Oscar Ruggeri decirle al rival disculpame por marcarte
Cu√°l era el chiste? Evitar que el Barcelona, te golee o que Messi no marcara gol? Porque si es la segunda sabiendo que puede pasar la primera, es un asco.
Yo creo que se combinaron muchas cosas buenas porque as√≠ como Maffeo nunca le lleg√≥ con mala intencion,Messi a su vez tampoco quiso hacerlo,y hay que ver que Messi con su habilidad lo habr√≠a podido hacer,Fair Play le llaman por ah√≠ üòäüòÄ
Estaba cagado del susto ese defensa. Demasiada responsabilidad si anotaba Messi. Hizo un buen trabajo!
A ronaldo los tecnicos no le ponen marcas asi por que nole ponen atencion
Genial que hagan v√≠deos as√≠ (Y)
Pobres los dos muchachos.  Maffeo por ratos casi llora tratando de enterder la magnitud de querer parar al mejor jugador del mundo mision casi imposible.   Muchas veces la profesion te lleva a cumplir roles realmente en contra de tus creencias.  Pero asi es la vida.  Ellos dos cumplieron y el Barcelona casi como siempre gano!
Para jugar as√≠ que no juegue, desde el primer minuto pidi√©ndole perd√≥n a messi menudo marica me dar√≠a verg√ºenza tener un jugador as√≠
A ronaldo no hace falta ni qu lo marque el mas paquete del equipo, total los goles los falla solo
Que presi√≥n para maffeo, hay que destacar eso, te ordenan marcar los 90 minutos al mejor del mundo y sabes que en cualquier momento se te puede escapar.
Despues del partido me parece gracioso hubiese estado super gracioso que lo invitace a cenar con la familia
messi no le hizo gol al poderoso Girona??? que raro
Las dos mejores actitudes para una situaci√≥n tan ingrata y poco vistosa. \nDos caballeros. Chapeau
corre con una cara de la concha de su madre ya se me fue este un padre nuestro y a ver si ocurre un milagro !
Quien es ma feo de los dos? Lo pill√°is?\nüòÇüòÇ
resultado  final de esta estrategia obsoleta? 0-3
Lo triste cuando los dem√°s jugadores no tienes su lugar ganado es que los traen en modo robots/t√≠teres & eso me enfada. Dejen a los futbolistas jugar como ellos se sientan c√≥modos. Dejen el f√∫tbol ser un deporte, olviden el dinero por un rato.
Me gustar√≠a ver a PABLO MAFFEO en el Barcelona... Mucho mas que a la MITAD de la plantilla actual del Barcelona. \nese MUCHACHO SI TIENE TALENTO, logreo PARAR EL 50% DEL PODER DE MESSI, y eso ya es decir MUCHO!\nTiene Buen marcaje, el chico. Y buena aptitud. Para mi un JUGADORAZO!
Hay que ser retrasao para hacer un marcaje individual y hacerte colega de tu marcaje cuando lo que tienes que hacer es intimidarlo dentro del campo, en fin...
Estar a 7 puntos es una mierda
Maffeo marca a Cristiano y este le responde: Y quien eres tu? Yo soy el mejor, Xavi juega en Qatar...
Que estrategia mas mala del entrenador, en vez se marcar a un solo jugador, deberian marcara los que estan sueltos y no solo a uno, se que messi es el mejor y es el que mas peligro da pero bueno...
Jajajajjaj quizas no se vea bien el marcaje personal, pero logro de alguna manera evitar que messi tuviera un mejor partido xd. Me parecio chistoso, no se porque tantas quejas. Al fin y al cabo es futbol y esta para disfrutar xd
Reyna-maradona la original!!! Una copia exacta la de maffeo-messi y si q lo desaparecio!! eso aremos el 5 de octubre pero muchos anos atras mi viejo me cuenta q alguien se la izo al gran perico leon de ahi la copia un venezolano a maradona y de ahi viene la de reyna-maradona!! Increible cambio y fuera!!!
ajajajajajajajajajajaja que cosa mas agradable
Como Reyna a Maradona... Maffeo a Messi... y dicen que el marcaje personal no funciona...
Que hermoso es el futbol. Que conste que soy del Madrid
Jajaja que bueno rollo ese
La verdad .  Messi y ese jugador mis respeto.. Jaajajajja lo disfrutaron..
El no es el m√°s bonito, el es el Ma' feo
Es Messi el que a marcado Maffeo üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Qu√© buena clase tienen los que arman √©ste programa. Excelente. Siempre generan buen humor en quienes lo vemos. Gracias.
Maffeo estaba hasta avergonzado, adem√°s de estar casi todo el partido a su lado, anul√°ndolo, llega Portu y se queja, amos no me jodas! Y muy bien por Messi, por entenderlo y ser agradable.
I don't understand spanish, somebody to translate to me please ? :'c
0:40 Messi Que hago para sacarme a este de encima jajaja Grande Messi, Buen Partido de Maffeo cumpli√≥ con lo que le pidieron!
Buen√≠simos los videos, desde Argentina
La voz de la chica me la puso como brazo de alba√±il üëÄüí™
bueno le dio resultado üòØ Messi no hizo goles!
A Cristiano lo marcan asi porque Messi es mejor üòéüòéüòéüòé
I DO NOT SPEAK SPANISH
Please translate it :'(
DESCUBRE INFIDELIDAD Y REACCIONA VIOLENTAMENTE \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_UNMTjoFvn0
Tas loco , solo en Europa se ve eso. Ac√° en Sudam√©rica sabes como lo matan a patadas todo el partido?! Jaja y encima le tiran un :  ‚Äú lev√°ntate cag√≥n , que ni te toque...‚Äù por eso le cuesta tanto ac√°, porque no lo miran , ac√° lo marcan en serio.
mmm con esa voz y si esta exitada mamu te rompo toda
Ha anulado a Messi, lo resto es conversa. Grande Maffeo
Soy yo el entrenador y se va a la grada todo el a√±o,  le ha faltado pedirle de rodillas lo siento...lamentable
Maffeo fue como si fuera una seleccion de sudamerixa, menudo pecho frio ese frionel xd
Por eso en sudamerica no triunfa;alla le piden disculpas por marcarlo, le muestran un respeto cercano al temor. Aca lo marcan de verdad y le dan le√±a. Es un crack Lio de todas formas
Marcaje personal es el futbol de antes y es efectivo.
QU√â VOZ MAS FEA...
Tus huevos ah√≠. Para que luego digan que es un chulo. ENVIDIA DE NO TENER AL MEJOR JUGADOR DE LA HISTORIA DEL F√öTBOL, LOS N√öMEROS NO FALLAN
Soy del Barcelona pero Ronaldo es el se√±or de la Champions... Grande Cristiano, un verdadero crack, fuera de serie... Hoy es el mejor del mundo...
La cara de imbeciles del periodista garcia caridad (q solo habla de oidas o me dijeron, escuche, me entere) y la del entrenador del mont√≥n, osea uno mas en el mundo, un pobre perdedor como el anciano d√°lessandro viendo como cristiano les cierra la boca cada vez q mete goles y demuestra quien es y ellos calladitos tragandose todo su coraje y envidia, y ni q decir del patetico de soria q tiene el culo mas abierto q un fisting porno de tanto y tan fuerte q le ha dado cr7, llenandole el culo y la boca de leche.
ERES EL MAS GRANDE CRIS
Watch the video now¬† üëá\nhttps://youtu.be/TYRt0N2R66c
Mario sube el camino, lo necesito
4:29, hasta los letreros de titulajes lo dicen, el equipo 1.
Los del Madrid somos felices por ser el mejor equipo del mundo y por tener a los mejores del mundo y al mejor tambi√©n
INCRE√çBLE QUE EL MARKETING TE DE TANTO!!!
El mismo lo dijo ! Los n√∫meros ! Pero son solo numeros
que grand√≠sima humildad...que grande CR7....leyenda viva del Real Madrid....futuro entrenador
Madre m√≠a, a Susana Guasch s√≥lo le faltaba ponerle el culo a Cristiano.
Est√©,es Tipo m√°s prepotente,del planeta y,Pedrerol le hace ojitos,Floren, Paga bien,
Cuando cristiano dice que es grande no es arrogancia, es la pura verdad, de los mas grandes de la historia del futbol.
QUE MESSI DE MIERDXXXXX CRISTIANO RONALDO TU ERES EL NUMERO 1
Mete 2 goles y se llena la boca, Messi mete 4 y no dice nada. Eso es todo.
Un gol donde solo tiene que tocarla a 2 metros de la porter√≠a y otro en fuera de juego ( y jugando de 9 sin aportar mas nada al equipo solo remate porque otra cosa no sabe hacer...).. y ya le dan el bal√≥n de oro y es the best.. mientras otros juegan de 6,7,8,9,10 y 11 en su equipo y deben hacer las jugadas, dar asistencias y meter los goles y se le critica y ponen por encima a este (porque en algunos partidos no mete gol).. Este programa siempre haciendo el marketing a este t√≠o, cuando iniesta y xavi eran lo mejores aun as√≠ la mayor√≠a de vuestros periodistas alababan a este tio antes que a ellos siendo espa√±oles, que verg√ºenza..
cristiano es el mejor que maradona y pele juntos es el mejor de la historia a mi me encanta cr7 mejor que johancruf y ronadhi√±o juntos es humilde el guapo y es rico y la estadistica no enga√±a el es el mejor de la historia crissss te AMO  \n\nJAJAJAJJAJAJ posdata: recontra cabrejos son sus hinchas de cr7 xD
Excelente THE BEST
Este chico es muy humilde y se esfuerza todos los dias para ser el balon de oro
Pero que dos goles meti√≥.. diosmio que el 99 por ciento de los delanteros hacen eso todos los findes de semana en la liga
Yo no se ustedes pero cuando dice lo del equipo creo q le manda una lanza a Messi.
Dedicado al hijo de puta de Crist√≥bal Soria, que vive gritando donde esta zerresietehhh, zerresietehhh donde estas????  Cabron Soria
El mejor, as√≠ de simple. Ha demostrado que es el mejor. Su honestidad cae como arrogancia, pero la verdad no gusta a todos. ¬°Grande,  The Best!
As√≠ es, CR7 es al √∫nico que le exigen. Messi puede jugar mal todo el a√±o y no llevar a su equipo ni selecci√≥n a nada. Pero con 3 partidos buenos y ya es el mejor.\n CR7 todo el a√±o est√° ganando y anotando y con 3 partidos malos ya no es el mejor osea
que √© o Cristiano Ronaldo?.
Mario sube el camino
Es el mejor duela a quien duela y Messi se la mam√° y venir ahora llorando a insultarme üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
eres un fantoche , solo hablas con el tonto de  pedrerol y sus bobitos que te chupan el culo.
Cristiano siempre es grande asta en los momentos donde el equipo m√°s lo nesecita en los partidos claves ..no como otros üòú
Alguien a visto al sub-normal de Soria ..... Que alguien le avise que ya puede salir de la cueva para ser retratado por en√©sima vez ....
que soberbio este pendejo jajaja, piensa que gira todo a alrededor de el, la gente que habla de el en todo el mundo solo es el mundo deportivo, este pendejo cree que sale en las noticias todo los dias jajajajajajaj que payasoo P A Y A S O !!
Mira que feliz La Perrica con CR 14Ôºå7Ôºåy el Piedrerol con esa cara que brillaÔºåvaya los chupaculos de TioFloren y CR14Ôºå7Ôºåsobretodo su RRRRRRRRRReal de Madril
Esa logica de que es el mejor del mundo por la cantidad de goles que ha metido no tiene sentido, hay muchos delanteros que metieron m√°s goles que Maradona y Ronaldinho y no por eso son mejores que ellos, ser el mejor va m√°s all√° de las estadisticas, a mi como Cul√® no me cae mal CR7,  es mas creo que √©l potencia a Messi, es un grandisimo jugador, pero no es el mejor de la historia.
Enorme jugador, sin duda el mejor del mundo. Y lo ha demostrado en las 3 ligas que ha jugado.
El mejor del mundo sin ninguna duda , dentro y fuera
Gran humildad un grande del futbol cristiano ....
Que gr√°n jugador y es ecu√°nime y concreto en sus respuestas, sin falsedad, siempre lo comparan con messy para qu√©? Mejor disfrutenlo, que  para que salga otro como el va a tardar  mucho
EL MAS GRANDE!!!!!  MAS GRANDE QUE EL ENANO PECHO FRIO !!! APROVECHO PARA MANDARLES UN SALUDO Y RECORDARLES QUE TRAEN EL CULO CHORREADO Y NO HAN GANADO NADA !!! A 7 ?? CON QUE POCO SE CONFORMAN , LAVENSE LA BOCA HALA MADRID HATERS !!! HAHAHAHA CR7 SU PADRE !!!
El mejor del MUNDO!!!!
Venga chicos ma√±ana a la pelu a peinarse como el y ha hacerse las cejasüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Cristi para ya de estirarte la cara chico, cada vez esta mas joven.
El que escribe los cartelitos esos del Chiringuito no se entera de la pel√≠cula. Dej√°ndose o a√±adiendo letras jajajaja
Quien cr√≠tica a cristiano llam√°ndole penaldo y eso no sabe de f√∫tbol, soy del Madrid y messi y √©l son los 2 mejores futbolistas de la historia para m√≠, sus maneras de jugar son completamente diferentes, messi distribuye el juego es un todo campista y cristiano es pegada, f√≠sico, desborde, son los mejores disfrutemoslos hasta el fin de sus carreras, unos cracks dentro y fuera del campo.
CRISTIANO ES DIOS ! YO LE REZO CADA CHAMPIONS
duro ahora muy motivado pero este en verano cuando se decia k cr podia salir el dijo que se fuera!!!
q tal tranquilidad
El mejor con diferencia
EL MEJOR DEL MUNDO SIN DUDAS
No veo a porquisoria
Cristiano es un crack y el tandem que forma con Bale es mortal
imenso,grandissimo cr7,el portuguessssssssssssssssssssssssss,mejor!!!!
Su mejor gol esta semana para que ya aprecien los haters ,un video para llevar camiseta y el gesto con El Ni√±o fallecido por el temblor en M√©xico
Los cules de mierda no vale venir aqui a llorar eh
PD;PEDREROL...BONUCCI,AGUERO AL MADRID NO!?JAJA...A VER CUANDO COJONES ACERT√ÅIS UN PUTO FICHAJE.

Cristiano eres una grande,  el mejor 9 del mundo y el mejor de la historia
Vaya mafia. El Madrid tiene a sus cadenas televisivas repartidas en todos los canales. A3media. Mediaset, TVE.... Aborregando a la gente
Cr7 obligado a conceder entrevistas al antimadridismo disfrazado. Otra noche donde se hablar√° del no penalti de ramos, y no del partidazo del Real Madrid. ANTIMADRIDISMO DISFRAZADO.
Q facil es salir a darse importancia cuando las cosas salen bien cuando no.... solo me roban y esto es una inyustisia üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
soriiiiiiaaaaaaa hay lo tienes bocazas!!!!!! que cada vez que abres la boca nos sale todo bien bocazaaaaassss!!!! \nPD: muy bien el Sevilla que va primero en su grupo ole ah√≠
El mas grande carajoo!!!!!
Menudo ataque de ego
Josep sube el camino!!
1:08 Yo le dir√≠a a Cristiano que no se preocupe porque la opini√≥n p√∫blica, no es solo la opini√≥n de la prensa,radios, televisiones, etc comunistas espa√±olas...carentes de objetividad y llenas de odio y envidia hacia el mejor club de f√∫tbol del SIGLO pasado.

+Jaclyn Hill I've been watching you for a year or so now this is probably one of the BEST looks I've seen yet! üíúüíúüíú IT!!!! She's back bitches! Lol! You go girl!
That concealer burns my eyes and skin too! I thought I was being dramatic about it.
Girl you know the mud slingers will always be lurking around, best not to acknowledge them, AT ALL! \nJust another form of bullying. love the look, wish I were brave enough. lol
I had the same burning reaction in my under eye area with my Maybelline fit me concealer üò≠ it was super weird because I have used it for years and my newest one just burned my skin like crazy üò≥ I wonder if they changed the formula recently üò≤
Also, ¬†what brush are you using for the crease/outer corner... same brush for all colors? I can never figure out how to go about that.
I've seen that concealer burn other people's eyes here on YouTube as well. Yikes! üòÆ
Michael finch used that concealer as well and it burned too!!!!!!!
Anybody know what brush she using when applying the color Central Park in the outer corner?
I bet the animals that concealer was tested on felt the same way :(
When the video started, and I didn't see Jaclyn's claws coming through, I was a tad concerned üòÇüòÇ
I never bought that concealer again and I dont have super sensitive skin
I love it üòç! Girl you üé∏ üíÉüèª
About time Jacklyn I miss you so much your my best makeup artist in the world
Jaclyn can you please do a tutorial on your ring leader costume from last year??? Would love to see how you created that. üòò
Girl every time I see you those lips are bigger.  üòò
I think it would be so cool if you did a get ready with me with Hilary Duff. Kinda like what you did with Kim Kardashian. Granted I know makeup isn't as much of a focus for Hilary as it is for Kim, I think you are both flawless and it would be amazing!
Totally in a non creeper way, but I had a dream last night that we were hanging out at your new house and watching movies....So random! Hahaha. Maybe my subconscious just wants us to be friends since we live so close...You never know what you'll get with pregnancy dreams! <3P.S. beautiful look as usual!
I make my own setting powder and it's bomb! Pukey is my favorite natural work color to use. I'm glad that the L'Or√©al has a good brow pencil cuz nyxs brow pencil suuucckkkksss
That burning thing happened to me with a nxy concealer!! I had to get rid of it!! üòí
Absolutely love this look and I appreciate how real you were about the drug store products. Even though I love your non drugstore looks, cause I can‚Äôt really use much when it comes to drugstore.
Please check out Jenluvsreviews video she made about this video. I really like her, but I think the video was problematic and not fair to Jaclyn. I don't think it was her place to tell her how to run her channel
0:07 // when your talking shit about someone to your friend
Can we get an updated house tour! I try to be nosey on snap but I would like to see the entire house(especially your closet) so I can hashtag GOALS all in the comments haha
I watched a review on another beauty youtuber and when she applied the same pro glow concealer she complained of it stinging just the same.....she also noted the pungent odor to it as well. I don't think it's you, it's the product.
It burned my eyes too and Casey Holmes
Smlx0 had the same reaction to the L‚ÄôOr√©al concealer when she did a fall drugstore tutorial. It burned her eyes and made them water really bad.
Does anyone know what foundation she's using? I know she said it, but i didn't catch it.
you blended that foundation to filth and it was for some reason soothing
I used that concealer for a couple of days and it didn‚Äôt really burn or I just didn‚Äôt notice it. When I watched this video & did my makeup this morning I felt the sent burn. Soooo weird
I love your videos! I recently got my Jaclyn hill eye shadow platte and I'm in loveüòç! Love seeing you using ur platte doing different looks.  Please do more üòò.
I've had concealer sting some times. For me I think it only happens if I exfoliate too much. Bc the next time I use it I'm fine. It happens with some gel moisturizer as well. I will get done washing my face, put moisturizer on and it burns. Then the next day nothing.
Can you list the products please?
You are the 3rd youtuber I've watch that had problems with the Loreal concealer burning their skin and eyes. What are the putting in there that is making it burn?? So scary.
I bought your palette yesterday as it was released in the U.K yesterday morning. You probably already know, but there were so many people trying to get their hands on your palette that the entire site just crashed and EVERYONE was going crazy because they couldn't get it for the longest time. But yeah, my point is that absolutely EVERYONE wanted your palette so badly... that's an achievement. I'm super excited to receive mine today!
How many more times are we going to hear the rant during the foundation portion....ü§îüòÖ
I love you Jacklyn :-) I learned a lot from you of doing makeup.
TRY NYX EYELINERS, THEY ARE FATTER AND LONG (THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID), AND THEY ARE AMAZEBALLS https://www.target.com/p/nyx-professional-174-makeup-jumbo-eye-pencil-cashmere-0-18oz/-/A-49113873#lnk=sametab
Love this tutorial but wish you would do more indepth detail about eye makeup. Tips for bringing eye colours out & for hooded eyes, small eyes etc. This would be great help as every1 is different & alot of people struggle with eyes xx
I use the pro blow concealer with no problem
Omg I missed YouTube so much. I live in Puerto Rico and I had no signal on my phone until today. The first thing I did is open YouTube and open your page to see your new video. I was very desperate üò≠üò≠ Ps I love you üíï
I believe that Casey Holmes had a similar reaction that concealer!
Where is your sweater from??? I neeeeed üòç
If I'm every blessed to meet you and be friends and do my makeup I'll forever cherish
i have that reaction to certain eye creams and concealers i think its common
Hi Jaclyn,\n\nCan you please list the products you used? I know you mentioned it in the video but I'm still learning about make ups and I'd like to try all. Hope it's not too much and hope all is well with you. Thank you in advance. Love you girl!
Did you mean Jada and not pool party?? ü§î\nLove this look tho soo pretty!
Pleeeaaasssseeee what shades of the colour pop concealer did you use, I have the same skin tone as you!
yea that happens sometime for some reason with that maybelline fit me concealer but Im low key use to it. The things we do for beauty lol.
Kat Von D available at the drugstore, wouldn't the be nice! lol, good save changing the lipstick.. even though that Kat Von D was such a great color for the look.
Jaclyn you don't need to explain or apologize yourself to anyone! Your fans understand that you have a life & cant be filming & editng 24/7. We all have things that keep us too busy at times. Thanks for this video! It's always nice to find drug store products that work well for looks like this!
both of those concealers burn the heck up out of my under eye! its horrible
You are the fourth person I seen that the concealer did that too so you are not alone!!!
Are we still getting the Kat collab???
I'm not sure what the pink elephant  is because I only follow you on YouTube and I've missed you!! Soooo glad you're back making videos!! I love your personality!! Keep on keeping on!!
Love ‚ù§Ô∏è
The loreal concealer burned my skin/eyes too!
your skin is flawlesssssss
üêç
Loved this look! Can't wait to try this look out!!üíöüíöüíöüíöüíö
Another one of my fav beauty gurus said that burned their eyes and skin too!
Any new youtuber wants to support each other ?
I legit love all of your videos!!! You are so funny and have the best looks! I cannot understand why people watch your videos and make rude comments! I dont get it. Dont watch it. Love your Pallet too!
The actual L‚ÄôOr√©al glow foundation burned my face I haven‚Äôt tried that concealer! With ur reacting I am NOT trying it!
Damn why does everyone gotta be some damn rude. You are amazing, it's good to see your face again boo. F*** the haters.
Oh my god!!!!! People are so shitty!!!! You aren't Jaclyn! Congrats on your palette and keep doing you
I‚Äôd had a rough few days. Thanks for this video. You‚Äôre my favorite YouTuber. This definitely made my day ‚ù§Ô∏è
essence has an amazing cream color eyeliner. it does not budge and i have watery eyes.
The L'Or√©al concealer burnt my eyes too that's crazy I thought it was just me
I've heard a lot of people saying the Lo'real pro glow concealer is burning their skin and their eyes. I have it and I personally haven't had that happen but I don't have sensitive skin. I do have to wonder though since it's common knowledge that fragrance is the #1 cause of skin irritation why are cosmetic companies still putting strong fragrance into their products? I personally love a cupcake scented lip product but I still prefer my complexion products to be fragrance free. And luxury brands need to stop with the overly strong floral scents in EVERYTHING!! I have a powerful nose and I end up tasting the awful chemical rose scent... So gross!!
So glad you're back and to your sassy self!  :)
Amazing eye look! I‚Äôm absolutely in love with it üòç
I still love you and I'm so glad your back to making videos.
Casey Holmes had the same experience with that concealer!! If I am remembering correctly...
The pro-glow concealer also burned my under eyes! I thought it was just me, but I had to return it, it was so bad.
I loved this video Jaclyn !! Continue being awesome !
Anddddd the Milk 'n Cookies is now sold out at Ulta thanks to this video wahhhh üò™
the pro glow concealer burned my under eyes too, you're not the only one lmao
Honestly Jaclyn u have been killing it with the last 2 tutorials!!! When u said u was back bitch u back! Lol! Welcome back Jaclyn Hill. Already can't wait to see ur next video!! Love ya!!! üíú
Your bitches r glad u r back! Including me your number one bitch!
I tried the proglow infallible concealer and it burns my under eye too! You are not the only one.
I'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR A GREEN EYE LOOK I'M SO HAPPY!!!
do more tutorials with your pallet! and also a skin care vid! morning and night in-depth with all of the products you use even makeup removers plz plz plz
That concealer stung me too!! I thought it was just me.
the maybelline instant age rewind concealer burns and stings my eyes like that! I don't like to use it anymore. But the fit me from maybelline is my favorite
I'm new to the makeup community and I absolutely love this look but would you be able to add the name of everything you used including brushes¬†so that I know I'm buying the right stuff :) I know this is asking a lot but I really want to learn and do everything correctly :)
y'all are so annoying, it's not her fault that you have to pay ridiculous duties and shipping rates.. and the fact that it comes down to about $1 per shadow means that it is affordable. stop complaining.
Casey Holmes had the same problem with the pro glow too! And she used a different foundation and everything I‚Äôm pretty sure. You aren‚Äôt the only one!
You look gorgeous girl! Love This! Your lips though üòçüíãüñ§
First - this makeup is everything! So stunning :) But second, with there being so much hate on youtube I wanted to take a minute to spread some love & positivity. Jaclyn has been one of my favourite youtubers for years now and that is because she is truly an artist and so good at her craft! But it is also because of the fact that she is fearlessly herself. In real life, if I saw someone as beautiful as Jaclyn I would probably think she would look down on someone like me and wouldn't give someone the time of day. But the beauty of youtube is that I have got to see that she is a normal woman just like me and that our senses of humor are identical! We will never know everything about Jaclyn and her life and nor do we have the right to but we are lucky that we can share in her talents and see what a beautiful human being she is :) \nSo keep slayyyying queen <3
That concelar did the same thing to me!!!!
You should open the aperture on your camera a little bit, that'll allow you to have a little bit more of a range that's in focus. f/8-f/11 will give you the entire frame in focus so aim at like f/5.6ish. :)
What's with all the Oh my Gods? You usually don't do that. My 5 year old son even looks appalled and he is busy racing and still noticed.
can you list the products you used in the bio pleasssee? :)
THAT!!! SWEATER!!!! <3
You're so stinking cute. So beautiful

Hey guys! I hope you enjoyed today's video! I'm so excited to finally start this years Halloween series it's gonna be a blast! Ps. I realise I said Mickey Mouse instead of Minnie Mouse, not sure why I did, I know the costume was Minnie's, i'm just silly haha!
Somehow you ended up looking good in all of these. #shook
I love all of these costumes!! Which will you wear for Halloween? x
What lipstick are you wearing?? It's awesome!
You call it a thong i cll it a g string
Yaya! I'm a dinosaur now! Rawr! :')
that's a mini mouse costume not a mickey mouse
I think when you're Tinkerbell costume you put the wings on upside down
üíõüíöüíôüíú
It's Minnie mouse
what is with the female costumes including thongs? thongs look very uncomfortable.
It almost pretty fast turned into a thong haul :D Don' t know what' s up with that ebay!
If you do another one of these, PLEASE BE ALICE IN WONDERLAND!! :D
hey roxxsaurus.  please do a fall giveawayüòçüòçüòç
You say mario weird
Its Minnie not Mickey.
It's not Micky mouse it's minny mouse
Jumper?
Thongs, why, just why?
The underwars are for man ho thinks its funny to ware that üòÇüòÇ
November is normally the month when I grow out of clothes and i normally want to wear the costume I wore the year before for Halloween üëª sooo that sucks
That's Minnie Mouse not Mickey Mouse üòÇüòÇüòÇ
She obviously likes very short costumes that are very tight.
You could make the Mickey Mouse ears stiffer by watering down some clear drying liquid glue and painting it on to them. The glue should stiffen the fabrich without making it look cheap.
Great video! Check to win 1 of 1000 halloween wigs here: http://bit.ly/spintowinwigs

I'M SO READY FOR THE HALLOWEEN VIDEOSü§ó‚ù§. also side note: did anyone get kinda triggered when she kept valling Minnie mouse Mikey mouse?

That is VERY DEFINITELY minnie mouse.....\n\nLol whatever
Why do the costumes come with things ??
The wings were upside down
Why are you so cute?! The minnie mouse were realy nice on you.
I don't understand. When did Halloween become a second carneval/ sexy flirt party? The costumes are meant to be scary and creepy! Not cute or sexy! Wtf??
It's not a wonder woman costume, it's super girl! :)
Roxxsaurus u cold put a red tutu on the superwoman costume
The boy that I love is called ibai if you speak spanish you'll understand itüòç

Why..
*is this how to bold things*
I literally thought she was Safiyya from Buzzfeed( who now has her own channel)
Even though eating disorder are serious why aren't people offer more help. I tried seeking help and got turned down because I wasn't sick enough says my doctor. I've had bulimia for 10yrs and constantly being told I wasn't sick because I didn't look like a anorexic, it made me give up because I feel as if I have no problem that bulimia is normal and I'm not gonna be taken seriously until I'm on my death bed.
jesus I had no idea... people need to know about this
I was diagnosed with type 2 at a young age and by the time I was 18 I saw the higher my sugar levels were, the more weight I lost. I eventually got down to the weight I wanted, I was finally skinny  I loved it but my sugars told a different story, I was living dangerously.
I didn't know this was a thing! Thank you for raising awareness.
Just a thought. Maybe these people shouldn't reproduce and pass on their defective genes.
this isn't a new disorder this is just people with anorexia who have an irrational phobia of insulin.
I hope that everyone receives the help that they need.
I think Professional hypnotherapy would greatly help this condition.
I have suffered from it all my life, no one knows or even attempts to understand. I have eye and kidney problems now.
Let them decide.. coz they think they know more than the doctors. These are fucked up white people.. others are wannabe white people
Finally! I've been waiting for a video like this, that spreads awareness and that make people understand. I've been struggling with my diabulimia for years and gotten help from more than one eating disorder clinic. But the thing is that nobody knows exactly how to treat my illness and it always feels like I'm the one who educates my doctors and ¬†psychologists.¬†\nWhen I went to a daycare for treatment I was told by the staff that I needed to go to the bathroom to take my insulin, by my self, and hide it from the others with normal eating disorders. They were afraid that I would scare the rest.. But my anxiety kicks in when I'm about to take my insulin and nobody would be there to support me or check that I would that my medication ..¬†\nWe need to spread awareness and I think that this video needs to be shared ! With more information I hope that clinics, doctors, the psychiatry and so on, will educate och learn more about how to treat diabulimia.
When I worked at a psychiatric facility as a psychiatric technician on the children/adolescents floor, one of my most depressed patients was a girl with diabetes. She tried to kill herself by not taking care of her blood glucose level and she ended up in a coma at least once before I met her. \n\nOn another note, Nabeelah's parents seem like they really care about her a lot, her dad is so open with her and I love it.
Why do they think not taking insulin but still eating a lot will make them skinny? Throwing up or something? Insulin isn't what makes you fat, food makes you fat.
i hope she stops smoking
diabetes needs to be more aware. i‚Äôm tired of people thinking type 1 diabetes is from being fat or eating to much sugar. it‚Äôs ridiculous
I kinda eat a lot and I'm skinny, Idk if I was born skinny or not
Such beautiful lady's!!! I hope they get all the help and support üíñüíñ
And these are the people who get fat-shamed then blamed for their mental illnesses. Sad.
Type 1 squad where u at!
Diabulimia isn't a real eating disorder. The diabetes has nothing to do with eating habits
I have been a nurse for many years, and even worked on the Mental Health units and this is the first time I have heard of this. ¬†I appreciate that you guys are spreading awareness about things like this, keep up the good work!
I dont get how she did this. As a type 1 diabetic, getting more than a 10 on the glucose-level I get headace, bad stomach, dryness in my eyes and mouth, thirsty, sick, fatigue.
Wow I could see how this could be really serious. Because when I was bulimic my blood sugar would drop, like where I would sweat, get weak, shakey etc. and I‚Äôm not diabetic.
You learn something new every day
Thank you. From the bottom of my heart thank you, for bringing light to not only eating disorders, but to the so very misunderstood plight of Type 1 diabetics. I feel a little less alone, and hope that the medical community, as well as the general population continue to gain knowledge of what we go through. It's often hard to talk to people, especially those who care about you.  This was immensely helpful. Thank you, again.
I'm a type one diabetic, and it's awful and hard, but I would never do this for weight loss. If you are doing this to yourself, please stop (or get help to try and get to recovery). Your body NEEDS the insulin. You're beautiful the way you are, don't ever think otherwise. Please take your insulin in the right amounts. Trust me, I know it's hard with all the math and needles and bruises and scars, but it's so so so important to keep your sugars stable and well. My heart is with all other type one diabetics, and I wish you all the bestüíñ
So sad to know people can't get the care they need because the Dr's don't know how to treat it. Most people with ED don't want help because they will gain weight and that's so scary for them. It's a mental disorder that kills so many.
so happy that this video was made for people like myself to learn about this eating disorder - i had not heard about this before, wishing the best of luck to everyone who took part in this video x
the muslim family broke my heart. the mother looked like she was worried sick and the father when he said i love you always and forever, i lost it. so sad for all these people both the patients and the families. i wish this didn't exist ever. such pain and heartache for everyone.
Why can't this physical perfect body/face thing go away. I realize it is hard wired into the human psyche bc that was what allowed us humans to choose the most healthiest partner to reproduce with. So I can see how people can run away with image. However, thankfully, there are a few and it is growing exponentially that realize that at face value, you are not necessarily choosing someone who is perfect for reproduction values. Especially when it comes to modern science and the ability to cure or manage so many diseases. What sickens me in the end is that these medically compromised individuals would risk their lives to be thin bc they think society will love them more if they are.
Thank you for sharing this
Wow I never thought of this eating disorder. Very interesting and very heartbreaking as well. Eating disorders are some of the worst things that can mentally and emotionally happen to you. I've struggled with anorexia and bulimia for close to 4 years now and it's so straining. I hope all these individuals get the help they need üòò
Having an eating disorder while having ED forums to access, I learned about this quickly. Somewhat luckily, I'm not diabetic. I can only imagine what they go through. Eating disorders kill and it makes me so happy we're finally sharing knowledge on this one in particular.
I have watched it yet but if it‚Äôs got anything to do with diabetes and eating disorders then I know where it‚Äôs coming from, I had eating disorders before I was diagnosed and finally got to a weight I was somewhat happy with before I was diagnosed and because of that I was 22kg at age 12, but once I was diagnosed and started putting weight back on it was really hard and my eating disorders got worse, then with being forced to give my medication but having multiple eating disorders and not actually getting any carbs from the food I injected for I ended up in hospital multiple times and I‚Äôve also stopped taking my insulin before in the hopes to go back to how easily I was loosing weight pre-diagnoses
im kind of ashamed to say I want to be as skinny as gemma.\ni have an eating disorder but i feel like food is the only thing i have control over, thus I won't allow myself it.
I had a friend who did this. She was also a binge drinker and the only time I saw her give herself insulin was when she was drinking. She would spend the night at my house often and in the mornings I would see her downing Oreos and cakes because her blood sugars would dip so low. She also had depression and would cry to me often that she rather die than get fat from insulin. her doctor even told her she was starting to lose her eyesight and her kidneys were in bad shape. It was very sad and hard to help her(we all tried), but she refused. She had rage issues so we are no longer friends, but I believe she's still doing this 8 years later.
Oh wow, I'd never heard of this! So glad it popped up on suggested videos to watch. I'll share it now to spread awareness
0:55 aww i wanna take care of you...
U wouldn‚Äôt notice if a morbidly obese person put on a stone so why do these fatties care bout getting fatter when they‚Äôre already so large\n\nGood video for raising awareness tho lol
I'm so glad I got to learn about this, I had no idea it existed.
I have a question for anyone who can help me.\n\nI have a friend who is has type 2 diabetes (she was diagnosed in her 20s) and she was very overweight. she had to take insulin shots as well. However, years back she stopped taking her insulin, started eating whatever she wanted (like, she could eat two whole meals from mcdonald's at the same time) yet she lost a crazy amount of weight. Without exercising she lost about 230 pounds. She became a skeleton. To this day she still refuses  to take her insulin and goes to the doctor only when she's admitted to the hospital. She loves the weight she's lost and doesn't want to go back. It kind of sounds like some of the problems people with Diabulimia have, but she's not a type 1 diabetic. Does anyone have any clues? I know the best thing would be to of course take her to a doctor, but she refuses.
I have type 2... and I need insulin... and I do this to stay thin. It works... but I also now have neuropathy and retinopathy... the trade off.
I've never heard of this, but thanks for the awareness!
Wow. I never knew about this. I'm so so happy I watched! I've never heard of it. I don't have it myself, but I strongly believe in spreading awareness for ALL mental health, and any health issue at that. This was an amazing video!! So happy I know about this.
As a type 1 diabetic for 15 years, I just realized diabulimia is a thing.... and it scares me because I've quit eating/taking insulin all together at times because I'm too embarrassed and scared to inject at work. Everyone always comments on what I'm doing when they know nothing about it.
I did not know this was a thing. Thank you for making this video.
Never heard about this thing before.. but now I know! Great video, learned something new!!
I'm going to be even more careful with taking my insulin after watching this. I knew about the side effects constant high blood sugar but didn't know about the eating disorder part of it.
Wow. I thought I was the only one who has gone through this. Crazy. I went almost two 2 years taking my insulin 10 times total. (Now I do it 3 times a day!!!) I went from 103 pounds to 160 in less than two weeks after taking my insulin again and now I weigh 135..finally back to my normal weigh. I definitely wish I didn't do what I did but in the moment I couldn't stop. My eyesight is worse but I don't have any other problems as a result of this disease.
BBC covers the most random things you've never heard of, it's great, super educational.
I'm not rich enough for this disorder. When I have money, I get to eat.
Why don't they try the pump? The dosage would be automatically administered they would control the amount but it would automatically pump while they're sleeping so they couldnt really skip it for weeks at a time like the injection.
Amazing how I've never heard of this before
Nabeelah has such wonderful loving parents. You can tell how much they care and how scared they are. I hope everything works out for her.
A woman I know, Brenda McBride in NJ, she does this all the time! She's like a skeleton, but eats like a pig, of course she's also bulimic besides having Type 1, but she has been offered meds to help with this, but refuses...a real head case!
Wow i never heard of this, its good to bring awareness to this
I've been skipping my insulin for almost a week now to loose weight, and now after watching this I'm just too scared to anymore. I tried starving myself, but food was just always around me and I didn't want to go hypo and have to eat more. I just feel like giving up, for good.
I have type 1 diabetes. idk how they deal with the pain of high blood sugar all the time.
I really HATE when they try and sensationalize disorders by saying it has a higher mortality rate or it is more dangerous, like it is some sort of race. They have diabetes and they have an eating disorder, they need help like any other poor soul who suffers, it's not about who's more at risk lf dying because Of this and that.
These girls need to go plant based. It has been shown to help with type 1 diabetes and can even reverse type 2 diabetes. Plus, you can get away with eating more food since most plant based foods are low calorie.
never heard of this.. wow I'm so glad I clicked this video.
Sad, I am surprised that don't play on TV :/
i hope gemma was able to find an inpatient place.
I am type mody and have suffered with this for 15 years. It's not only type 1. I don't not hae an earing disorder. I do not look in the mirror and see a fat pwrson.  I struggle with insulin because it makes me gain weight. Therefore I used to noy take it to maintain my current weight. Most of the girls on this video would have an eating disorder regardless of whether or not they had diabetes. There's two very different problems here.
FUCK my mom has type 1 and I heard her complain about gaining weight, now I'm scared as hell! (even tho she knows a lot about nutrition I shouldn't worry idk)
This is so sad and its makes me want to cry, but watching this documentary I wander how common this disorder/disease is the US
I wish those beautiful humans only the best ! They deserve only the best
Ive been struggling with eating disorders since high school. I have osteoporosis and need partial dentures at only 23. The worst part is how cruel and harsh people are to you even though you could drop dead at any moment.
I learned from school this but I think it was called something else. They just skip their diabetes mess. Didn't watch this video because it's too long but dead sure it's going to talk about type 1 diabetes skipping their meds
great show.... this would be relevant for any insulin dependant diabetic.  I know I'd be in trouble too if I stopped taking my insulin as I hardly produce any of my own... I'm type 2 and not type 1.... just my pancreas no longer does it's job (diagnostic tests done to prove that).
I hope Nabeelah can start to be more open with her parents. You can tell they're very caring and want to understand what she's going through so they can help her. Thank you so much for making this documentary.
wow, I had never heard of this
Thank you for sharing. I didn't but even know this exsisted until now. So sad it's not talked about.
Diabulimia isn't a diagnosis. It's just an added complication to current EDs
I'm 20 and was diagnosed with diabetes and kidney disease at 8 when I was younger around 13/14 I used to do this to myself not understanding I was really hurting myself. I'm so glad there is a rise in awareness about this issue cause it's real.
It took me embarrassingly long to figure out why it's called diabulimia
My heart goes out to them!! Keep fighting for your beautiful, young lives ladies!! ‚ù§‚ù§
This is so sad üôÅ‚òπ
This is amazing,  look at how many people have seen this documentary. Awareness is rising
Not everyone with an eating disorder is skin and bone and i love that this video has focused on the mental illness side of it rather than physical appearance
Omg.. Nabeelahs mom is so wonderful. You could tell she was very concerned and loves her daughter.. damn. Touching moment for sure.
My aunt had this. She needed a triple bypass at 37. She's legally blind. This year she had to have a new bypass and stent. She's 45 now. Has never been offered help. The doctors just tell her they can't understand how she's alive. She sleeps all day and has two  children. 16 and 10. The older one is raising the younger.
Wow thank you so much for raising awareness about this, I'm definitely going to talk about this with my community.
Wow I had not heard of this until now. Thank you.
i started crying when that girl was on the swing with her parents I feel so bad for all of them , its hard because you don't want your family to suffer
Nabeelah is the cutest, sweetest young lady. God bless her and her family they are so adorable together. <3
This is just the consequence of the failed medical/nutritional field pushing high carbs/sugar diets into people that can't metabolize sugars. This carbohydrate pyramid nonsense has to stop!\nI to am type 1 diabetic and at 21yo got diagnosed - went from 49Kg to 63Kg in 2 years 'cause my now sick body couldn't handle the sugar in the diet. Only after major research on my own that I found the low carb diet.\nI suggest anyone diabetic, or that knows someone with this disease or even an obese person to search here in youtube for Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution.\nWe cannot wait for these doctors to help us because unfortunately they don't care about us.
this video will probably give people ideas.
13:07 smh
1st world problems hey
That's naughty.
Lots of misinformation
Weed would help.
Gemma sounds like Adele
really good
6:11... are... are they eating with their hands?
Of course you had to include a Muslim ...
*friendly reminder that you can be fat and healthy and happy.* \nI'm not saying it's easy. But a common thing that I find in the women in my life who have eatings disorders and body image issues (which is actually all of them to some extent, including me a couple of years ago) is that the focus of recovery tends to lie on *acting healthy* instead of *thinking healthy,* with that I mean: realizing the harsh fact that you might be forever fat and that this is okay. (I know this term is ambiguous. But for the purpose of my argument I won't distinguish between people being dysmorphic and *believing* that they are fat despite having an average weight and people who *are* actually fat even though I realize that they're two different things.) ¬†It is *okay* to be (your internalised definition of) fat. It is okay to be (your internalised definition of) ugly. You can't look at a person and determine how healthy they are. And saying BUT!!!1 PHYSICAL HEALTH!!! HEART ATTACKS!!22 CHOLESTEROL1!! is NOT a deadbeat argument, anyway. Therefore, you can be fat and badass and happy.\n\nEmbrace is a really good documentary that will prove that point. Bring tissues.
UK seriously needs to get their shit together on psychiatric treatment facilities. Its ridiculous that this woefully inadequate treatment situation can continue on so long. And your healthcare system is so much better than SO many other civilized societies- this complete  failure in the mental health system makes no sense! Its weird because In America we desperately need to go to a universal healthcare system and its disgusting how far behind we are in that area- Its so wrong- but we do have a LOT of treatment centers for so many disorders. Especially addiction\behavioral health treatment centers.

GENTE QUE √çCONE DE STATION
I really love TVXQ!, and I truly want to join the fandom. Bur it's hard for me to join this fandom because everyone is just dissing rookie groups. I get that TVXQ! are the legends of kpop, and I agree! But new kpop doesn't SUCK. It's just different. Different isn't necessarily bad. Don't mind me, just a salty new kpop fan that likes old and new groups.
SM I need this song to purchase!!! WHyyyYYYyyyy!!!?
I LOVE INGRID don't get me wrong but maybe she could recommend us products that are actually affordable I think that would be great ingrid üòä
Can you do an updated, unsponsored, how you keep your skin clear/how you went from having cystic acne to relatively nothing on your face? This would be so helpful for me. We used to have the exact same skin and now yours is drastically different and mine hasn't changed so I would love to know!
Your hair is so beautiful!
I don't remember your brows being this bold, I love them üòç
It‚Äôs official our miss glamorize is baaaaack ! I love that kind of videos that‚Äôs remind me why I did subscribe to your channel years ago since the blue room :p
When is the podcast coming back? I really miss it!! üòî
Just tried the whamisa green tea mask and it made my skin turn red and feel terribly sunburnt üò≠ Has this happened to anyone else?
woooo i love masks! i just got the watermelon mask and i cannot wait to try it! xo from my channel to your‚Äôs <3
I absolutely love Ingrid ‚ù§ and I don't have a problem with her talking about high end products because I do want to hear about good products regardless of their price. I do wish that she would at least mention the price in these kinds of videos because some of those products are extremely expensive for someone on a budget and she doesn't even mention it as a possible con to the product. It's a small thing but I do think it makes me feel better about someone recommending a product when they're open about how much it costs.
Here's another one  https://www.ebay.com/i/371642174655
A lot of clarifying/acne treatment masks try out my skin too much and end up clogging my pores. The sulfur mask sounds promising! Definitely need to check it out.
I love you and I feel like we're friends so I want to say I'm not feeling your new eyebrow pencil! I think your older routine looks more natural. Just a friend to a friend suggesting you switch back üòò
I love how strong your brows are looking üôåüèº
These all have highly irritating and harmful ingredients including fragrance that can actually damage skin.  You should consult a dermatologist Ingrid.
lol I can't pronounce masks either... the s's...
The thumbnail looks like she is ready to cry
My fave is origins out of trouble mask! Feels very purifying but gentle as it doesnt dry so i tend to keep it on when im having breakfast
Thank you!! Such a great video with such helpful content! I can't wait to try the Sunday Riley one!
I've started keeping face masks in my carry on luggage so I can always use one at my travel destination! It's the best
I am a Face Mask lover too!! lol thank you for this video Ingrid!!! Also, can you please do an Updated apartment or house tour?? Miss your apartment tours so much, only like yours lol ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòä
I think people just gotta accept that it will be difficult to see a lot of affordable masks on Ingrid's channel. I mean, look at her skin, it's freaking glowing. She doesn't have acnes, her face glowing without looking oily. That means all those expensive masks worked and they are worth the money. Just freaking buy one high end mask and try to see if it works because it already worked for Ingrid. And if it worked for her, she would want to share to us so we can experience good things like her. Stop with the complaints about her always recommend expensive stuffs and be grateful
i all time like your Youtube =))
my favorite face mask is catastrophe cosmetic from lush, it's sooooo nice!
Ingrid. Srsly. Words like masks, tasks, and asks make me rage. I don't get everyone's hatred of moist, but plurals of words ending in -ask send me straight to the looney bin.
Ingrid, what camera and lens do you use? btw, I also love the Fresh Umbrian Clay mask
My favourite is the HM volcano mask :D I'ts so super good? :O
You have been recamending a lot of product and it would be great to see a skin care routine so we see the products in order
Loving the videos you've been doing lately :D x
Anyone have a recommendation for a mask that hydrates and reduces redness??
I just want fashion ... that's all I care about
I am so excited to try some of these! Can you please make a video about the different skincare ingredients? Definitely would like to learn more about what you know about them! üòä
Ingrid, I totally have the same problem with plural words that end in -sk. Like tasks, desks etc. lol !!! I always ask others if they think it's weird or funny sounding. Most people say they don't hear anything weird, wrong or funny about it... just me lol.
Your reviews are always the best and I love that you're uploading so frequently!
I'm trying to reach 30 subs can y'all please help by subscribing?
My FAVOURITE mask is Caudalie Instant Detox Mask. It's üëå and my holy grail! Definitely reccomend :) Makes my skin so soft and super calms down my skin when I feel a breakout coming on.
I definitely think you should try a pixie cut Ingrid, it would really suit you!
Help  guys. I need a mask that will help me to mattify my face. I have really glowy  skin but i hate it. It looks oily even after i clean it. My forehead and t zone is really shiny all the time and sometimes my forehead is really dry but its still shining. Help? Really need a mattifying mask. üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•
Okay so no lie I was thinking yesterday I wonder if any youtubers have videos talking about good face masks and today I SEE THIS. YOU ANSWERED MY CALL! My face has been a mess I needed this thank you love!üíõ
Have you tried the Moonfruit sleeping mask by Herbivore? It's incredible!!
I had to do a book report presentation on Stravaganza: City of Mask**s** in elementary school and I had the hardest time.
The watermelon mask is one of my absolute favorite skincare products ever. It‚Äôs completely balanced out the skin on my face!!
Ugh I wish I had the money to buy at least one of these products
This is really helpful. My skin is bad and I have some new recommendations.
Perfect timing! I was about to google some face masks. Haha
Check out the L'Oreal clay mask range!  They are SO good!
I hope you could have a vacation in the Philippines! We have a lot of face masks here too! ‚ù§\n\nXoxo,\n\nIya
Thanks Ingrid! It's so cool to see new face mask types I've never heard of before - thy Korean one sounds fab!! Can't wait to get my hands on that watermelon one toooo! üôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüíïüíïüíï

I was just about to stock up on sheet masks!! This came just in time! btw the sk2 facial treatment mask is REALLY good
I love the peel off version of the Egg Cream mask. Super nice to take it off and feel refreshed:)
How often do you do face masks
Yes fill this channel up with videosüëèüèºüòç
So happy that you enjoyed korean skincare!!! üòçüòç
I love how you're getting into Korean skincare! It's amazing!
I love the Aveda Outer Peace cooling masque and The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Clay Mask. The Aveda one is a slightly runny clay mask that is sage green in color. It smells really herbal and woody, reminds me of sawdust. It really helps breakouts and redness. The Body Shop mask is on the thicker side and is mint green in color. It smells like tea tree oil and is very cooling on the skin. It really helps breakouts.
Humm , the liquid one looks interesting ! But i 'm not into sheet mask  :( BISES !
You should check out masks from Ko Skin Box! They have great high quality masks that you'd love!
always enjoy your videos :). tks Ingrid. best to you.
Great video on masks! The DKM Skincare Charcoal Creme Masque is amazing with clean ingredients! Check it out in our channel and on FB and Instagram!
The Whamisa by Glow Recipe Green Tea Clay Mask is not technically a drugstore item. It's a collaboration between Glow Recipe, an online K-beauty retailer and Whamisa, a higher-end Korean brand. They just introduced their line to Target though, which is pretty cool! It is on the more affordable side which is nice but keep in mind you don't get that much product. Anyways, now I NEED to get my hands on that mask! Hopefully it comes to my Target sooooon!!!
I live for her beauty and skin-care videos omg I‚Äôm so here for this

Never really comment ever, but i always like Ingrid's personality and want to show some support. I get why some people complain that Ingrid uses and recommends expensive products while other youtubers can use and rave about way more expensive products. It is because Ingrid's personality is humble, honest, and nice and she seems wiser than her peer; and that doesnt really fit into the category of luxury or consumerism. Like for example, some other youtubers talk about crazy expensive stuff but it fits them and their branding. However i dont think it is Ingrid's problem, it is people's expectation and their idea of Ingrid that make it hard for them to except that Ingrid has grown up and earned her the life she has now. and there is nothing wrong with that. \n\nYou may say it is also because her audience market doesnt need or want to know about expensive products. But i think those audience also follows other youtubers who have even more luxurious life styles. It is all about their expectations. \n\nBut Ingrid, if you are interested in keeping and growing your audience, you can focus more on your branding strategy now. Just saying. \n\nI get you and i always like you. Good day!
WHY ARE U LOSING SUBS?!
You should try Susan Kaufman skincare, it's all natural, suuuper luxurious, and most importantly effective! I'm in love with their enzyme peel mask, but it's more on the tingling side of the spectrum, but I can't wait to try more from the range when I run out of stuff I'm using!
Love u Ingrid. You have such Amazing Skin and hair!
I'm confused. The brands did NOT ask you to include the links, but you *may* make a commission off of them? \n\nI'm okay with sponsored stuff but I feel like you should be honest about which of these things you are making commission off of, and which you just happened to find and love. You can still truly love something that's sponsoring you, but you should be honest about which products those are.
I got a Soko to Tokyo Sephora favorites box and it came w the egg mask and I‚Äôm so excited to use it ...and I‚Äôm soooo tempted to buy the watermelon mask üôÜüèª
Can someone tell me who Estee is? I want to look up her instagram so I can get more reviews on the mask.
Are you still loving the eve lom and omorivizca masks?
I love masks too, so I'd like to know how often you use them? A different mask each night? Thanks!!
Firstly I want to thank you a million times. You are the reason I finally have the skin that I have always prayed for, smooth and pimple free. Every products that you recommend worked for me as well, that's why I am always excited to see your skin routine, monthly favs, and makeup routine. Your review helped me to choose right skin care products. Thank you and I love you
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been following you for 7 years ever since you would film videos sitting in front of your bed. Time goes by so fast
Paused video. Can't stop trying to say masks. It's impossible. Why?! What is happening?!
You forgot the cat woman mask, if you wore that lol I would put on a batman mask with the jumpsuit, black underwear and cape.. then you can whip and scratch me..
Ingrid, is your top Aritzia?
How often do you use masks in general? I read somewhere that you should only do one a week, so how do you decide when you‚Äôre doing which mask?
They didn't need Colin Firth for this movie. Just don't kill Roxy and have her in the scenes with Eggsy OR have Merlin do those scenes! Would have saved a ton of wasted screen time. Also really didn't need Elton John...
I feel like your main critiques are either semantics (the plot holes, the actors, etc) or the fact that the movie doesn't have as much richness in terms of plot/arc. I think you're being too harsh. It was a enjoyable movie imo. They're basically like cartoons, they don't have to be masterpieces, they just have to have action and to make you smile. They did for me. I also loved the Elton John bit, thought it was brilliantly silly. I think that (maybe because you do film studies) you're expecting too much of all movies. Some movies are just fun. Take off your director cap and just soak it in.
Only time I was really disappointed in a movie was pirates of the Caribbean 5
I think I really enjoyed the film and was super satisfied when I left the cinema but I completely agree with everything you say, I definitely do think things could be improved and they dud try to redo all the amazingly choreographed scenes in it over and over again rather than the odd one which blew you away
Is disappointed really the right word? It feels far too strong a word to use....
I did quite like Golden Circle. Obviously not as much as the first Kingsman, and I agree with your comparisons between the two - however I still enjoyed the humour of the film, and the odd emotional scenes (eg. Mark Strong).  But I understand where you're coming from in the fact that this movie didn't need a second instalment - all part of the sequel culture of Hollywood.
Saw it yesterday. I wondered about the direction after the first film (which, let's face it, did have its own set of issues), but there isn't really any, and the laddish humor really got stale very very quickly. Certainly not an all-out bad film, but one of the big disappointments of this year for me.
Completely agree with this review! I absolutely adore the first Kingsman movie, I've always been a fan of Colin Firth from the first Bridget Jones movie so he was the main reason I watched it and ultimately fell in love with it, followed by my love for the Harry/Eggsy relationship. I found the film fresh and interesting unlike any other spy/comedy before and felt quite patriotic about the very quintisentally British undertone. When they announced the 2nd film I was so excited, but was definitely disappointed to hear about the American skew and casting and it definitely felt like a 'get well known cast for the sake of the popularity' kind of casting job. I also agree about the whole 'bringing harry back from the dead' scenario, I couldn't get upset about Roxy and the rest of the Kingsmen dying because in the back of my mind I always thought they'd appear at the end, rising from the dead. I was mainly disappointed that rather than continuing to develop the bond between Eggsy and Roxy as a good duo in Harry's honour under Merlin's wings, they thought bringing in Channing Tatum instead was a better idea. Over all I really did enjoy the film for the continued relationship with Harry and Eggsy (eventhough he should have remained dead), I also really liked the development of the relationship between Eggsy and Merlin and most of all I loved the recreation of the inital bar fight scene which made me sit up in my seat in excitement. However, unfortunately, as much as I did enjoy the film, I can't help but have my reservations mainly around the casting and poor storyline, especially the very questionable Glastonbury scene... I think I would have preferred to pay to re-watch the first movie instead.
i completely agree with this as a critical review... but it was kinda fun to watch
It was an americanised piece of shit.
I thought the first scene (the car chase)  in the movie was amazing and it got me really excited for the rest of it but as the acts unfolded I got more and more disappointed. The villain concept was really good imo but I don‚Äôt think the movie needed the American president to be a dick, it just seemed forced and unnecessary. Also the wedding came out of nowhere and just didn‚Äôt make sense with the plot. \n\nI was excited for this movie and I just felt feeling betrayed
I agree with most of your points- intellectually I know that this is not a great film. But did it pull the wool over my eyes with jokes and action sequences? Kinda, because I still really enjoyed it. Here's my full review/discussion if you want to take a look-\n http://storytellingetc.weebly.com/home/kingsman-the-golden-circle-reviewdiscussion
This was. So true the first one was so good and the sequel was a complete shitshow
I hold Jack's film opinions very highly. I usually agree with him on everything. He is very precise, particular and like any good filmmaker knows what the hell he is talking about. Every point he made was valid and when I saw the film prior to watching this review I agreed. Bringing Colin Firth back removes the consequences, Poppy does fall easily once all her henchmen are gone, and the treatment of women in this film is sub par to say the least. But at the same time I did enjoy the film. I laughed at moments and felt enticed with where the film was going. Apart from style choices like fight scenes and the unconventionality of the villain this felt removed from the Kingsman series. Like it was just some other separate spy movie. It relied more on it's flash of celebs and cgi toys like the Statesman HQ rather than it's jokes on the spy film archetype. That being said I had fun. It won't hold the same place in my heart as the first but it is a film I would watch again.
YES. It felt like they killed Roxy and Merlin unnecessarily just to make up for the fact that they couldn't commit to having killed Harry in the first one. Halle Berry and Jeff Bridges didn't do anything in this movie, and they weren't even in a coma for half of it. And really, Pedro Pascal's character's motivation for turning on them was one of the laziest things I've seen. \n\nI loved the first movie so much, so I'm right there with you in being so disappointed by this one.
I couldn't agree more with ur points tbh I was really disappointed
GOD i absolutely agree with this. i seriously contemplated walking out less than halfway through because it didn't feel like it was going to do anything even remotely funny or memorable.
I really loved Kingsman. Saw the trailer for The Secret Circle and was bitterly disappointed. \nI really respect your honest review of the film and agree with a lot of the points you make in this video. I don't think I'll pay money to go watch this. I legit could not care less about Channing Tatum being in the film- personally I found that in the run up to this film being released he was plugged the most (if that makes sense?). There was too much emphasis on big names than trying to have a witty and meaningful storyline.
Took the words out of my mouth. I am a massive fan of kingsman. Like with no exaggeration I could happily say I've watched it 30+ times (idk how), and so when I saw it I had this unexplainable feeling of disappointment. I put this aside cause like all the reviews are pretty much positive, and the people I went to see it with (who aren't big kingsman fans) enjoyed a lot. But it feels as though they made this one for money and forgot the point of eggsy's character. I wanted to see more of eggsy's past, what happened growing up, and yet all I got was a posher version of him with no other character development really. I'm so glad other people understand this cause everyone else just seems to worship it
Thank you so fucking much for saying everything I've been thinking
The film was fantastic. Everything a sequel should be and it showed great respect to the original movie while adding some new elements/characters. Kingsman 2 is the best movie sequel since Winter Soldier.
I aggressively agreed with literally everything in this review like he literally put my exact thoughts into words from this movie.
I totally agree, so disappointed with almost everything. So sad
Oh man I agree with almost everything, except that I did somewhat enjoy it but the thing that annoyed me most is that THERE IS NO SNOW IN THESE MOUNTAINS IN JUNE, WHEN GLASTONBURY TAKES PLACE, god that still annoys me so much
Im so glad im not one of those people that watch films so technically and so nit-picky. Im not hating, im just genuinely glad because i like to enjoy movies instead of pick out flaws that your average joe wouldnt care about or notice. The first one was better, of course, but the golden circle wasnt bad and i had a bloody great time watching it. Im glad harry hart was back and it was an interesting way of bringing him back. I was devastated when roxy and merlin died because they were like the people on the side who dont steal the show but they were essential to giving the movie the heart and friendship it needed. I knew when i heard about the american cast that they were going to be unnecessary and they kind of were. Anyone could have played their roles (excluding julianne moore because i think she was great). Im looking forward to the third one theyre planning because i cant help but love the movies
Man, I couldn't agree more. My friends wouldn't stop going on about how they GENUINELY LIKED IT MORE THAN THE FIRST and I was like wtf...?. It certainly wasn't a terrible movie, but it really didn't match the first. An okay, but forgettable movie.
Ok but like why do you hate every single film üòÇ
I completely agree with you! I absolutely love the first film but I just didn't get the sequel. There were a lot of moments where I questioned why they were doing X,Y,Z and undoing all the amazing work of the first film. It was just a bit..... weird to be honest
Like everything else these days... it's lazy, leaned too much on the first film, I even felt Eggsy was out of character most of the film, similar villainous plot...  Yeah, the slipping in the tracking device scene was a bit much.  I too think Vaughn messed up here :(
i loved the film, but there was no point bringing colin firth back from the dead. elton was a bit far. taron egerton, in my opinion, is an amazing actor, but the first film will always be better. i liked the references to the first film, but i struggle to see how it was only a 15? especially with the tent scene
I agree with everything you said but I still managed to enjoy it. It wasn't as good as the first one but I wouldn't say I was disappointed either. I think because the first film holds a special place in my heart (I'd say it's one of my favourite films of all time), I had a soft spot for this one too. I always knew I'd hate the American stuff though. One of the main things that made me fall in love with The Secret Service was the British grit. I liked the fact Eggsy was a chav from a council estate. He was rough and ready, but he was real. There's that stereotype that British men are always so charming and prim and proper, but this showed everyone what most young British men are really like. Haha üòÇ I wanted to see more of that roughness here. I also didn't like all the new gadgets. It seemed like they had a gadget for literally everything (just not one for disarming a landmine, clearly). And all of Poppy's robots, ugh. I know it's fictional and anything goes, but the robots felt so fake. One last thing I didn't like (aside from all the deaths, sad face) was Eggsy's relationship with the Princess. I didn't think all that was necessary or added anything to the film. I loved the scenes between Eggsy, Merlin and Harry though. It is weird that Harry is back but he was so great in the first one, I couldn't bare to see him go so early. Their scenes made it feel like the first film again. The humour from the first film is still there in this one, and I think Taron plays the role of Eggsy perfectly once again. I think I'm just going to hold on to the scenes between the OGs, and just hope that they go back to the realness of the first film for the next one. üòä
This video is exactly why I watch you. Completely agree on this film.
I don't get the love for the first Kingsmen movie either.... Found it over the top and unrelatable, and I usually enjoy a good action comedie. Anyone with me?
I normally respect your opinions Jack but I gotta say, I think you‚Äôre being entirely too harsh on this one. I went to see it last night (I was gonna see it regardless, I‚Äôm a huge Vaughn fan) and while it wasn‚Äôt as good as the first (when are they?) it was still a solid film.\n\nI agree that they shouldn‚Äôt have brought Harry back and they certainly shouldn‚Äôt have spoiled it in the trailers. The finger condom scene really wasn‚Äôt as bad as all that. Channing was in it for a fair amount, not just 2 minutes at the start and again at the end. Elton John was a poor choice, I don‚Äôt really understand that one.\n\nAll in all I‚Äôd give it a solid 4/7. Not the perfect 5/7 that the first film got, but good enough. I just wish Matt decided to do sequels before Kick-Ass 2 got wrecked. Hopefully he‚Äôll come back and give Kick-Ass 3 a go.
I fell like because the first one was so amazing, the fact that the second one wasn't as good did make it look a lot worse. If they do, do a third film, I hope they make up for what they have done in the second one.
I completely agree with the whole narrative structure difference of the first film and the sequel. I've seen Kingsman: Golden Circle twice now and I definitely preferred the first over this one. Admire their efforts of making a sequel, it's a ballsy move, but I just prefer the first's creativity.
I found myself laughing at how awful and disconnected some parts of the film were (mainly the parts where Elton John added nothing to the scene...) but I did enjoy it. I'm not sure if this is just because I'm invested in some of the characters from the first film though. I left feeling odd, but not like I had wasted 2 hours of my life.
I didn't feel that Elton john belonged there and I'm heartbroken about the deaths of Roxy and Merlin. But there's another things that's been bothering me and now that I've noticed it I can't stop thinking about it: they HAD to make Halle Berry one of the Statesmen because by the end of the second film she is the ONLY female character whose sole purpose ISN'T to be someone's mum or girlfriend. Even the Kingsman sign est 1848 bothers me because in 1848 there hadn't been a King for 11 years. I realise Kingsman sounds better but then why not just set it in 1836?
My thoughts exactly! Such a disappointment.
Matthew Vaughn produced Eddie The Eagle with Taron as Eddie and it was AWESOME.  Eddie is so loveable and you feel for him.
The Golden Circle sucked. Suck is the key word. The first Kingsman was the best. Please.....no more. This last one was the killer of any future Kingsman movies.......at least I hope.\n\nThe grinding up of humans into hamburgers was Jeffery Dahmeresque. Is eating humans to be funny? The hitting on Colin Firth's character by Elton John was to be funny? It was not.  No naked Halle Berry?  Such a shame. It was a complete disaster and a waste of 2.5 hours.
I liked the movie but idk I didn‚Äôt really like how Roxy and the rest of the kingsman died because surely they can detect a missile before it hits like come on it was just an easy death
I agree so much with this! Like almost everything, except Elton Johns jump kicks. Didnt love them, but didnt hate them, haha. \n\nI actually sat wondering when Roxy was going to show up again because they are going to bring Harry back so she could have jumped away from that missile that erased the whole house from the face of the earth
I feel like this video could've been half an hour long with all the bullshit that went on in the movie
I have never loved a film more than Kingsman the secret service but i too agree with your opinion here. Being a huge fan of the first one and being so obsessed with it i cant bring myself to hate the new one because i feel like i would be betraying myself but it just wasn't anywhere near as good as i had wished. Such a shame.
I haven't seen the new Kingman film yet, but this well describes my fear for the second Pacific Rim film
One of the things I didn't understand was how kingsman and statesman didn't know about each other. They are practically the same organisation with very similar technology. AND they're supposed to be intelligence organisations, surely they should know about their counterparts in other countries?!?
When I started watching this I couldn't think of any reasons to slate this film...but now I've heard your views you've swayed me üò¨
I agree with a lot of the points - especially that the action in this one just seemed to be fighting. It wasn't getting switched up at all. However, I thought Elton John was a welcome difference from the blandness of what was going on. Also, I think Matthew Vaughn pays homage to comics through his shooting skill so slow motion of movement in the fights or a character directly looking to the camera, I think, is a reflection of this. \nIt was an unfortunate film to choose to create a sequel for given how brilliant the first film was
Enjoyed the film, but agree with basically everything said here. I dont really understand why half the story choices made were made, half of them undermined the previous film and the other half were just infuriating. Also Merlin and Roxy deserved better.
I understand its better to have strong views either way but I do think this is a *tiny* overreaction? Yes, the film does not meet up to the first Kingsman, but was it ever going to really? I think the references to the first films and tropes made the film and it felt so nice to be back in the Kingsman world with some new material. As for the fingering scene, I agree it was too much but this did not really impact how I feel about the film. I cried twice, laughed loads and it's the fact it's so ridiculous and nonsensical that makes it so endearing for me. I agree with all that you said, however, there were enough good parts of the film to make it for me an enjoyable and fun viewing experience. I for one would love to see another return of the Kingsman and I would definitely recommend fans of the first film go and see it. Not gonna lie when I saw the word 'rant' in the title of this video my heart sank a bit because I loved the movie x
Just came back from seeing this film and couldn't agree more with your review. One of the main things I couldn't understand was killing off Roxy! Seriously they spent so much time on her character development in the first film and got everyone on board rooting for her as the super kick ass female lead. To then kill her off and replace her with Hallie Berry.. they were like shit we don't have enough women in this film let's throw Hallie in there. Disappointing üòî Also poor Pedro Pascal he was barely in the trailer or on any of the posters but did majority of the acting out of the other big stars... rant over!
Watch Now Kingsman: The Golden Circle Full Movie 2017: https://t.co/ZfdVMIAOws
Welp, glad I just agreed to see this tonight. What's super worrying is I tend to agree with 99% of Jack's opinions on films.
I honestly really enjoyed the movie because the entire 2 hrs and 20 minutes i didnt get bored or tired of watching, but i did find that human emotions were stripped away especially after the kingsman locations were attacked by the golden circle missiles. There was no mourning of those characters who had been initially introduced as important and it felt as though the movie was rushed to include everything so they skipped emotion. I really enjoyed the extravagant fight scenes and found myself super involved in the diegetic effect of the film up until the end
literally i was so so so excited to watch this film as i bloody love the first one but now I'm not sure. I shall demo go watch it. Even before i watched this film i though the same thing about colin firth like i saw him in the trailer or something and i was like the hell man!? but we shall see
I absolutely agree with the fact that they unnecessarily brought back Colin Firth's character. And they didn't even do it cleanly, they spoiled it in the trailers, months before the film even came out. So when it was revealed in the film, you knew it was going to happen and it completely ruined the surprise factor it was trying to create.
I had a feeling this would happen, something about the vibe and construction of the trailers didn't feel like it rang true to what made the first Kingsman brilliant (almost a lack of sincerity? not sure what to call it)
Personally, I hadn‚Äôt seen the first film so my knowledgable friend had to explain the ‚Äòdog bit‚Äô to me later. But I loved it, maybe I would have loved it less if I‚Äôd have seen the first one. But still I really enjoyed the action scenes and the plot. I agree about Elton but you‚Äôve got to admit he‚Äôs bloody hilarious. I really enjoyed all the characters and the progression of the characters. Especially Merlin, to the point where I was crying at his death.
Haven't watched you for a while as you just seemed to pander to film companies but YAAAY intelligent critique!
I enjoyed it quite a bit, there were a lot of flaws but it was still fun, not as good as the first one, I brought my family and they enjoyed it too. Just bring in people that wont take it seriously.
Completely agree! The first movie was so strong! This one fell flat :( such a shame.
As always Jack, I can't help but agree with your points (we must have similar tastes in film!). I enjoyed The Golden Circle for raw entertainment value, but even while watching it I knew it was nothing compared to The Secret Service. Everything that was different and quirky about the first film was lost in this one, I felt. But Taron Egerton is lovely so I'll overlook it for him üòÇ
Sorry, but I absolutely loved Kingsman 2. Will probably see it at least 2 more times in the cinema.
you make a lot of good points! it wasn't as great as the first one but it was definitely still fun to watch. there was a bit of the movie where i was kind of skeptical, i wasn't really sure how i felt about it and it got a bit slow. at the time, i didn't understand why i was just not feeling it but i think your points put it together nicely. that being said, i still think it was a good film and was pretty entertaining. honestly, i walked in expecting it to take the piss out of a lot of things so i didn't take it as seriously, which was part of what made it fun. \n\nalso, just to add! i can see your point about how bringing big name actors just felt like it was for poster, but i also feel like it represented america pretty well. i lived in america for a while and things can be......very over the top and showy....subjectively speaking, it's not my cup of tea. i felt like it was a bit much, and as you said, it felt like it was mainly for the posters, but it was very american of them and i think it fit that aspect of the film? if that makes any sense haha
I think one of the biggest gripes I had was that it felt like the Statesman took the front seat in this (maybe because of the high profile American actors?). Enormous amounts of effort put into the Statesman while (in lack of a better word) devalueing the Kingsman and killing off two great characters to make room for the Statesman (More pissed about R rather than M, at least *he got a decent send off). I'm kinda 50/50 on the Colin Firth thing. I do agree with you that takes away a lot from the first movie but on the other hand the chemistry between Taron and Colin is really good and I love watching the two together on screen. Definitely agree about the fight scenes. None of them stood out to me unlike the scenes from the first one.
This!!! This is everything I was thinking but have been afraid to say, because all of my friends are MASSIVE Kingsman fans and loved the sequel.
I would just pretend that there is no kingsman 2 üòí
Thing is, i actually agree with basically all of your points, but i genuinely did enjoy myself *while* watching it. I was sort of distracted by how fun and high-octane it was ya know? But, now that i've had a few days to let it sink in, i've taken a step back and realized why a lot of people are disappointed. I'm not as attached to the original as you and many others seem to be, which may be why i'm not as gutted by the sequel. \nFor me, it comes down to this: i enjoy both films separately and for different reasons, but when comparing them side by side, i can't help but focus on the flaws of the sequel. \nOne last thought: i love Merlin as much as the next guy but i swear to god, if they bring him back in the next one i will RIOT IN THE STREETS
Completely agree with everything you said, they completely missed the mark and I'm so disappointed! üòî
Personally while I understand your criticisms and actually notices some of those points during the film, I found enjoyment of the film outweighed the annoyance. Mathew Vaughn has a style I just absolutely love, though my favourite of his is probably Layer Cake
i agree with everything you said but i still liked it.\ni just honestly think they could've let colin firth be dead and not killed roxy instead. like would that have been so difficult she was cool, and capable, and alive, and bringing ppl back from the dead ALWAYS takes the tension out of any plot for me. bc who cares anymore?\n\nbut, that said, i still really enjoyed watching it. i wasn't too invested in the first place so it was just a funny movie to watch, even though it had its faults
They definitely amped up the violence in this one which was probably to target the fanboys but the scene at the end where whiskey is thrown in the shredder is just completely unnecessary. I expected there to be a fight but I just think they went a little too far as I don't believe that's what Eggsy and Harry's characters would have done.
Damn I agree with everything you said but I still liked it and I don't know how to feel about that
100% agree. I still hope that if there is another sequel, it completely smashes it, but thats a bit unlikely
Saving this video until I‚Äôve watched the film!!
Nah one of my favourite films what are you chatting
it got hollywood-ed, which doesn't have to be a bad thing but, it means compromises and for kingsman it didn't work. I think one of the best parts of Matthew Vaughn's films is always the balance between well-known actors in surprising roles and relatively unknown actors, but with kick ass 2 and kingsman the golden circle you lose that, like losing a little spark. Elton John i just really don't get
Not hating on the princess but I just don't understand how they could choose to give her more screen time and development over our best girl Roxy? For an action movie, you would think they'd prioritize the awesome partnership/dynamics between Eggsy and Lancelot as Kingsmen instead of a romantic relationship between Eggsy and Princess Tilde that had little to no chemistry and is mostly just used to show us sexy time.
Kingsman Golden Circle appears to be the Cursed Child of the Vaughn and Goldman team...
Honestly I went into this film not remembering much about the first one and really enjoyed it, but now that you mention all this I completely agree :/
As someone who hadn't seen the first kingsman film until after going to see the second one yesterday, I went into it with no expectation... and came out with possibly a film now in my top 10 favourites. I finished watching the first kingsman film about 10 minutes ago and I think they are both absolutely smashing.
I think what really drove the first film was the characters and how much heart they had. You cared about Eggsy, not only because of Taron's acting skills, but because he was more than just a chav people pegged him to be and it was his relationships with those around him that made him a lovable action hero. He cared deeply about his mom and little sister, in fact, you could argue that they were his driving force to better himself, but you get none of that growth or pay off in this film- or only a little of it anyways. The sequel would have been so much better in a myriad of ways if it had focused on Eggsy and his family post-Valentine and all that and how they fared, not on his sudden relationship with Tilde, who while was an interesting character on her own, became quickly diluted to 'spy-hero's girlfriend'. You can have all the fun action, spy movie stuff in the sequel while also having the stakes be laid or around Eggsy's family and his other relationships that had been already established in the first movie (i.e. Roxy who deserved much better than she got and whose friendship with Eggsy was apparently not worth much to keep around in order to make way for big names that only clutter the film, not make it better). It would have been much better to explore these characters more while, of course, adding a big, bad, spy movie-esque villain in another way, but it was so, so key to remember who these characters where and what gave them so much heart and soul and to not just take what you think people loved about them and amp it up unnecessarily. I adore the first film, in fact, I would call it one of my favorite films of all time, but to take something that was so good and to create almost a caricature of it with the sequel is so disheartening.
Fuck them for killing Roxy in such a quick and pathetic manner
While I enjoyed The Golden Circle, I agree that it just wasn't up to par with the first movie. This one had humor and some good fights scenes, but it really couldn't hold a candle to the first in terms of uniqueness and a well thought out plot. I consider Kingsman to be one of my favorite movies, but the sequel is a let down. It's enjoyable, but not something I'd go out of my way to see again.
I watched the film yesterday and felt disappointed with a few things. I absolutely loved the first kingsman so couldn't wait for the next one. I 100% agree about Colin Firth as I think they shouldn't have brought him back although I found it emotional when he regained his memory again. I also think the fight scenes were the same a lot of the time. I also agree with the actors all being famous and recognisable, would have been nice to see a range of different actors. Although I was disappointed with a few things, overall I enjoyed it a lot.
I loved Elton John in it I thought it was so stupid it was hilarious I think you just have to watch it expecting it to be ridiculous and not try and compare it to the 1st one but a agree there was no point in having channing tatum in it
I went with a lot of my friends to see this movie, bc we all bloody loved the first one.... aaaand we all tried to act like we were semi-happy at the end? But it sucked so badly üò≠
There are as many memorable action scenes in this one as there were in the first. For example, Taxi fight/chase, Manners Maketh Man Kentucky Style, Whiskey's Solo, Storming Poppyland on Wednesday, Diner fight against SPOILER, more etc.
Couldn‚Äòt agree more! I didn‚Äòt even go in with high expectations, because you know a sequel usually isn‚Äòt as good- and I was still so massively disappointed :(
I am truly so thankful for your abillity to review films with not only a passion, but in such a respectful way (thinking back to your video/interview with Matthew) \nYou put, to 99%, my thoughts on these films into words and in a much smarter, broader way than I can. So thank you - I can often forward people to your channel if they want a film-reviewüëçüèªüòâüòä \n\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nTo the movie it self:\nThis was one of my top 3 most anticipated movies of the whole year. Kingsman is one of the best films I've ever seen, and truly love everything about it (minus the last 3 minutes...) \nSo when a sequel was in the works I was so excited already. \nBut when I walked out of the theater I felt that feeling you described - the punch in your gut from it not at all being anywhere near as AMAZING as the first one.\nThis feels like a different movie all together, it didnt have any of that spark of cartooney-fun with a dash of english style and class. \nInsted the Golden Circle felt like a bit of a joke. Lets talk about a scene in the very start: for example, when Eggsy jumps down in shit (literally) to get to a birthday dinner for hus friend (who we never met in the first movie) and he brings his girlfriend, the Swedish princess with him. \nShe, a PRINCESS, hangs out in juciy couture in a council-estate, with not a guard in sight or even mentioned...\n\nOR howabout the fact that the Statesmen, who are suppose to be Kingsman's cousins, couldnt figure out during a whole year that Harry was a Kingsman? \nReally?üòëüòí\n\nFor me the story didnt add up half the time, the dialog felt much more americanized and not classy/smart at all, the american actors were wasted, the action scenes were to many and forgetful (like Jack pointed out) \nThe film as a whole was WAY to long! I wanted it to be 30 min shorter, and it would not have made it bad (or worse...)\nThe positives were the look of the film (visually, the cinemotography is great) some of the gadgets/inovation of tech was clever and cool, and I think Mark Strong and Taron Egerton (Colin Firth to some part) played their roles great (but the storyline failed and even their performances couldnt save that.)\nThats it. \n\nSo yeah, unbelivebly disapointed sums up this movie for me.
I'm so glad someone feels the same as me about this
I agree 100% with everything you just said.
SPOILERS:\n\nI agree with the point about Colin Firth but I was still glad to see him back. I actually loved the movie but I see all your points and kind of agree with them on some level. They didn't recreate the magic of the church scene sure, but the final assault on PoppyLand and that one-take (style - I know there were cuts) fight with Whiskey to the country remix of Word Up is probably one of my favourite things from both movies. I will say that I found the first film more enjoyable as a whole. I hope they bring back Roxy and Merlin if they make another too, even though it would further defy everything the movie is. I love Merlin as a character and I think Roxy needs a significantly bigger role in everything. \n\nFinal note: COUNTRY ROOOOOOOOOOOADS!
jack please do one on i.t. mate
I enjoyed it a lot still not as good as the first one unfortunately but still a very good film. With all of these 'flaws' I just look at it like they're parodying all films which I mean... they are. It's all making a joke out of spy and superhero films all of the cameos and silly ways of bringing people back and all the fights its done all the time but they just amplify it a ton more in this. I guess everyone sees it differently.
It's weird. I agree with everything you said yet I still really enjoyed watching it.
I never saw the first Kingsmen, so with nothing to compare it to I thought the Golden Circle was great! I enjoyed how it was different from other spy movies, mostly by adding in more humor, and I was greatly entertained by it. That being said, after watching your video I want to go back and watch the first one and see if my opinion of Golden Circle changes. A lot of the stuff you criticized, like the cheesiness of Elton John, I assumed was in the first one as well.
meh
It needed a hell of a lot more of a build up. In the first one when it's starting to become clear what Valentine's plan is, you think 'oh shit, everyone is going to die' and it's genuinely stressful and there's actual emotional connections with Eggsy's mum and his little sister (the scene where she is bashing down the bathroom door still stresses me), but in this one it felt like nothing was going to happen the entire time? I wasn't worried for Tilde because her part in the film made no fucking sense anyway.
Why is this trending with 1.6k views, seems like youtube has some sort of agenda...
I wish the roof would come down on them..if only to shut up this hysterical pensioner..
i wanna be like him when i get old
Remind me. Labour lost the election, yes? Because I'm getting a whiff of Kinnock here. I think the Labour Party is currently too busy counting their chickens. Never trust a chicken.
Labour doesn't stand for it's old values and is just another party fighting for its own glory ...
So... If I wanted something I couldn't afford like a Ferrari, I should just borrow the money from a loan company? Anyone with any sense would say i''m mad. They'd be right, it would be a stupid thing to do. Lets scale that up to a country size borrowing and suggest its anything other than Mad. The only reason Labour can borrow so much money when they get in power is because of the house keeping the Conservatives do while they're in power. Lets try to be more like Germany and less like Greece. No one wants to be a slave to the central banks once they restrict the money supply. Look at what happened to Japan when they went on a spending spree? if anyone is interested watch Princes of Yen and youtube video:¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5Ac7ap_MAY
Most people on 0 hour contracts are in the types of jobs that will be taken over by AI and machines. They're the types of jobs people don't normally stay in for long anyway.
And all the rest of it!
First?  YES DENNIS...YES!  xx one love xx
Skinner is the only true Labour MP , he puts his constituents first and has never veered away from his politics and views for personal gain unlike the rest of Labours poor excuse of MP's
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
their will only be one Mr. Skinner
Lmao YouTube shoving this sh#@ down our throats
Dangerous party... Corbyn supports terrorism.
YES
Borrow it regardless of being in dept already and have no means of paying it back.\nLabour bought in tuition fees under Blair did he not.
The guy looks like a British Donald trump

Omg, Fiona is the world's cutest potatoe! I love her flappy ears! üòçüòç
I have been watching her videos since  the birth. Though it is thousands of miles away and I will probably never have a chance to actually get to see her, she has and will always have a special place in my heart. Thanks to all the staff members for their dedication for this beautiful water sweet potato. She is growing up be just fitting the name princess Fiona..!!You guys are the best..!
Really enjoy seeing her grow. I'm glad her fan base insisted that the zoo make videos so we could watch her grow

Thank you for never giving up on her.  Thank you for sharing her story on Facebook and YouTube.  Without it,  I would have never known her story and the amazing accomplishments both your team and Fiona have reached.   Hippos are amazing creatures and your love and dedication saved one more!
Fiona has so many mommies!
GREAT TEAM
Adorable üòä

She's wonderful therapy!!
Love Fiona
Horray for Fiona.  :D
Great video, thanks for making it and for caring for the animals.
baby hippos are one of the cutest baby animals out there.
Why would anyone give this video a thumbs down? I am not a huge fan of zoos but they are helping to save some animals from certain death and even extinction in some cases. Yes there are zoos throughout the world that should be shut down but Cincinnati isn't one of them. They put in so much dedication to saving any animal they can. Man has made a mess of the animal kingdom from over hunting, poaching, illegitimate sales, deforestation...I could go on and on so it is up to man to help these animals come back and that is what this zoo is doing. I love Cincinnati Zoo. Great job and great people saving animals. Ty ty ty!
Fiona's story is amazing and gives me so much happiness. You guys rock!
Thanks for showing this progress , I have become a full blown hippo fan...
I just love her.. Look how cute is she! Howsomeone cannot love her? She is pretty quite and a good angel!
They love beer pulp because it's basically sugar.
Well done gals and guys! Thank you for caring so much and sharing it with us! Fiona is MARVELOUS! üëÅ‚ù§Ô∏èüí¶üê¥
She is so Great!! What a beauty. I love the ear wiggles, adorable!
TURN ON THE FLOOR PHONE I DONT WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU 404-393-9786
I remember when I paid $65 for a 30min diving lessons 2 years ago. Fiona gets it for free. LOL
I wish all zoos were like this one! Fiona is in great handsüòÄ
These people are some of the best caregivers on the planet !
She has such a cute tongue.  It was so cute when she licked the side of her tank.  When hippos open their mouths I never noticed the tongue.  I love seeing her sink and jump underwater.  I wish I was that comfortable in the water.
When she opened her mouth to play with the hose >0< I AM DYING OF CUTENESSS AHHHH
So cute when she sinks to the bottom
I'm really starting to love hippos now!
I don't know why I get so nervous when she is in the water...I feel like she won't be able to get to the top in time to breathe ...I'm short of breath right now!!! Lol huff.....
So good to see Fi is doing so well
I've never seen a hippo fly before! She can swim very quickly through the water and she's getting big, too!
More feeding vids would be cool.  I used to live by Lincoln Park Zoo and would try to go by when they were feeding  the big cats.  Always interesting to watch what animals eat and how much.
Very nice video, love seeing the progress and how you guys taking care of her so well! I wonder how old is she in term of human age.. a toddler?
Thank you - great Job - i Love fiona and sing the birthday Song all the day and this here in germany k√∂ln (cologne)  and all Look at me .  Thx for all.  Claudia hanak

CNN Sucks, Fiona Rocks!!
Nice to see her progress in one video; she made an amazing comeback after being born so premature...only 29 pounds; I've seen cats that weighed only slightly less than that. :-) It would be nice too to see how they introduced her to her mom and dad, who have now totally accepted her presence and are very sweet and gentle with her, although they may not exactly realize she is their baby. That's really the best part of her story because it means she can grow up as naturally as possible for a zoo hippo, close to her mom and dad and learning from them; hippos aren't exactly monogamous animals and fathers usually don't do much childcare, but they are social and it's normal for them to live in groups. I like the new movement to help zoo animals grow up to be the animals nature intended them to be, rather than pets. Adult hippos are actually very dangerous and no responsible zoo would ever let a keeper swim with one, so it's good they're gradually weaning Fiona away from human contact.
What's the ratio of Male:Females involved with the hippo? Seems like a female dominated workplace. Time to fire half the staff and make it 50:50 right? Females don't have any issue with this because it's all about equality.
Did I hear that correctly...??\nBee pulp????\nWhat on earth is Bee pulp - or are my ears malfunctioning...
How often does she spend time with her mother can u guys show her with her mother please

And this was how they made minecraft
can't wait for you to make metal tools
I was really surprised to see you assemble the bricks into a kiln as I know it's common to sun dry them in some parts of the world. Did you test how brittle any of them were before firing? I'm curious how they'd compare before and after the fibers have been burned out.

I was blank as I could be, hearing voices telling me, ‚ÄúWalk away from everything‚Äù\nOh I wasn‚Äôt meant to go, far away from those I know, to some desolate below\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe were in the urban scene, where they grind the coffee bean, where the women are oblique\nAnd the boys are paper thin, ragged beards upon their chin, we were on the outside looking in\nRise above the present day, rise above the popular melee\nI see you the way you are, I see you the scar[?]\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful before we got wise\nWe were beautiful with sky and blanket laying low\n\n[Verse 3]\nI am hanging on the line, I‚Äôm on duty all the time, I am your Samaritan on call\nI could try my best to heal, all the emptiness you feel, in the giving I will be a light[?}\n\n[Verse 4]\nWe were wrapped around our roots, nothing on except our boots, we were intimate around the waist\nWe were settling our scores, we were healing over sores, we were living out the pleasure that we lost\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful for all time and space\nI will tell it to the sun and I will tell it to‚Ä¶\n[Verse 5]\nIf you listen to the night, we can heard the madmen fight, hear the foxes making out\nBut the people all immune, sleeping silent in their rooms, growing bodies with their sleep\nMaking plans inside their heads, making love to shallow friends\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful before we got wise\nWe were beautiful with sky and blanket fueling up[?}\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were beautiful before this went down\nWe were beautiful before the years came, turned it upside down\nWe were beautiful for all time and space\nI will tell it to the sun and I will tell it to your face

bayaƒüƒ± iyi geldi bu
Sounds good except for the ridiculously rapid-fire beats that everyone thinks are required for modern music.  It's overload and not necessary.  Just be you.  It's good enough and better than most.  So glad they didn't throw a bunch of whoa whoa whoas in there too just to be trendy.  That's even worse than machine gun beats.
Perhaps you folks should think about retiring & moving on--perhaps take-up painting, or photography; you were great once B&S, but this is just plain awful.
Yuck...pedal steel.
Cool . . . but doesn't really feel like a proper Star Trek intro sequence to me.
This looks like something HBO made.
My thoughts and it could be wrong... There is no musical motif... none that I find appealing anyway. The DS9 and Voyager themes have a great leitmotif. The TNG also has a good leitmotif. Where is the leitmotif? A melody? Feeling very ambivalent towards this new one...
LOVE!!!
Awesome Opening,  I could feel myself building inside one of Da Vinci's pieces and the instrumental music was quite awesome too, and when I heard the Trek theme strings, just after the Star trek Discovery title is displayed on screen, I  smiled and almost cried
Just watched the first two episodes not bad at all I enjoyed it :-)
Looks great to me!
Interesting. I like it. \nNot what I was expecting, but then I wasn't sure what I was expecting.
Na boa, que abertura GENIAL, incr√≠vel!
Se puderem, recomendo os colegas assistirem em uma televis√£o o v√≠deo, a abertura tem muito detalhe e muita textura, tem que ser em tela grande para ser aproveitada em todo seu potencial.
Isn't it a Fringe theme?
This smells like Bryan Fuller.
Guys listen to this opening with westworld theme, it fits so well
What is this James Bond?
I love this show already. Just from this opening alone.
very bad choice of colours for a space sci-fi intro. also, is it me or all the shows have started to have similar openings?
Good theme, graphics don't seem quite right, feels like something HBO would do or better yet AMC that's the vibe I got from it but still at the beginning and at the end gave me goosebumps
Wow this looks cool, but where are the credits?
Faith of the Heart will no longer be the worst Star Trek theme.
It's been a long road....
This has a very Westworld vibe to it. üòÖ
Pra quem est√° perguntando: Sim, essa √© a abertura real lan√ßada pelo twitter da s√©rie. N√£o tem os nomes dos atores/produtores/do Gene Roddenberry porque √© uma vers√£o clean feita pro marketing. No show mesmo isso vai estar tudo incluso.\n\nQue que eu penso dessa abertura: Os visuais s√£o lindos e t√£o de parab√©ns, mas a m√∫sica √© muito silenciosa e gen√©rica. Tirando as partes copiadas do tema da s√©rie original, n√£o tem nada de interessante na m√∫sica.
Est√° ainda sem os cr√©ditos...
00:21 to 00:25 remind of Destiny.
awesome!
Muito bom.
Linda! Linda! Linda!
Uaaaaalll
Not bad at all. \nThough it's a bit Game of Thronesesque, I think.
This must be fake as there's no actor's names and most crucially it doesn't say created by Gene Roddenberry
√âpico, abertura de s√©rie de responsa
Please be good Please be good Please be good Please be good
It looks nice but with the music and all it's kinda dull.
Nice visuals, shit music. No melody, no substance, no direction, no inspiration,  just canned sci-fi muzak. Oh well. It can always get better right?   :)
Just glad they didn't blow it like Enterprise!
Michael Burnham is the stupidest character name ever.
if u can put this in trending, u can put the defenders opening credits in trending..
was waiting for Jack Sparrow to show up with this song
When the violins kick in at 0:30, it really reminds me of legend of zelda gerudo valley: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THdRs7grqhE&t=0m23s
What year is it set 2040??
what shit is this? this is the generic crap we get in a shit ton of shows, doing a Trek intro should be so easy, have the Discovery flying across space with a great, memorable, inspiring theme.
Why is this on the trending page?
at the time of watching this video has been uploaded for 2 hours, has 972 views and is on the trending page........good job youtube.......good job
Where's the melody Taylor?
is it just me or does it sound like a star trek antherm mixed with harry potter ??
looks like the House opening sequence
Feels more like greys anatomy than star trek
Beautiful but feels more like a video game intro ... not particularly star trek. Also the intro music doesn't pull you in ... quite forgettable actually.  The intro music for next gen and voyager immediately pulled you in ... This is rather somber.
It's been a long time... Getting from there to here...\n\nPart of me was waiting for it... Gotta be said.
Spent years watching Walking Dead impatiently waiting for the *insufferable* Sasha to die, just for her to suddenly turn up in the new Star Trek series? Nope, sorry, won't be watching. I know that's a totally unreasonable reason not to watch a show but I just cannot stand that actress.
The music is absolutely wonderful, but I'm not sold on the animation. If we had a traditional TNG/DS9/Voyager opening with the Discovery flying about in space with this tune in the background, it would be amazing.
So that‚Äôs it huh, we some kind of enterprise squad?
Well, at least it's not fate of the heart
N√£o sei o que pensar. √â uma coisa lind√≠ssima, mas totalmente inesperada para a serie. Sera mesmo a versao final / oficial?
Bom hj vou descobrir...se √© a da s√©rie ou n√£o.
total garbage
Shit.
RUBBISH, FORGETTABLE, BLAND
Absolutely horrific!
No. Just... no.
this is bad
Destiny 2?
S√©rio?! Mereceia mais impacto. Lembrou Dr. House
Wrong pallete, space and yellow?
N√£o deve ser essa a da s√©rie! Onde est√° o Based upon.... E na minha opini√£o faltou o espa√ßo....√© s√©rie no espa√ßo ou n√£o? Boa, mas poderia ser melhor, muito melhor.
This show is for nerdssssss
It looks and feels like STD.
You are jokeing, the music is arfull and to put a cartoon title sequence for a big budget show like this, is terrible I can't believe it they might as well just thrown up the name of the show and 10 seconds of music, this is not star trek how cheap, I bet there is moor crap in-store and to show a communicator an a phaser they make it look like a baby's show now trekkers will be laughed at.
This American Veteran Family is Boycotting NFL!
Why are taxpayers subsiding corporations? Pay for your own stadiums! Pay the same taxes I do! This cronyism needs to end.
I'd be very interested to know what those kneeling are doing about the issues that they are trying draw attention too when the cameras are not on them.  Quite frankly I'm tired of listening too actors, athletes, and entertainers take stands when they lead the most privileged of lives that society has to offer and on the whole do so very little to give back or payback.  #hypocrites
Inside these lines, millionaire rapists, thugs and traitors run around and hit each other for the entertainment of castrated cucks. No thanks. Can't wait for the NFL to go bankrupt.
Unity? What a joke. Why wouldn't the NFL let the Cowboys wear a decal supporting the Dallas police?\n\nhttps://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2016/08/10/nfl-allow-dallas-cowboys-wear-arm-arm-decal-helmets-games
At this point all I see is the NFL letting politics get in the way of sports. I don't tune in to watch players take a knee,hold up a arm or anything else. I watch to forget about all the BS going on outside those stadium walls. These players have so many other platforms available to them to get their views outs. The field should not be a platform for these whining ass players to spout their opinions or anything else. They are being paid to do their jobs not give their opposition. Shut Up, Stand Up, and Do Your Job. #RogerGoodell #NFL #StandUpAndShutUp # DoYourJob#YourFired
I just became a NFL fan. Fuck the dotard
Sports is the most unifying thing in the world. You know there's a real problem when politics become involved. These men don't get paid extra or get a bonus for kneeling for that anthem.. so why don't we try addressing their problem? The POTUS is ruining the progress we made in the last 20-30 years.
#TakeTheKnee ‚úäüèΩüá∫üá∏
notice that in the ad, when it shows a team on the sidelines, the players are standing
You piss me off that we cannot share this without having to come back here... fucking NFL
NFL players and owners now acting like Hollywood a-holes.  Just a bunch of millionaire malcontents espousing leftist, anti-American politics.  Take away their money, and the media limelight, and they're nothing more than a bunch of immature, spoiled, wife-beating men who get together, dress up in uniforms, and then play a kid's game.
I have always loved football. I lived out of state from my home team my entire adult life and still felt like they were my team. I'm not fair weather. I'm die hard, born and raised. \n\nI stopped watching a lot of the games and didn't go to any for the last few years. I was very disappointed in the lack of response from the NFL on domestic violence. I was really upset by taxpayer funded and subsidized profits. I was just overall let down. I'm a huge fan. And the NFL is pretty consistent on dgaf about women fans. I was the one bringing friends and my husband to the game. I was the fan in the house and in my friend group.\n\nI applaud and am cautiously enthusiastic about this and the support for free speech that I have seen in the last week. Truthfully, I find it upsetting and typical that owners, coaches, the organization had nothing to say or were negative in their response where it concerned black men dying at the hands of state funded employees, who are NOT hired to be judge, jury, and executioner in a matter of minutes or seconds, but are hired to protect and serve (lack of training and faulty procedure are to blame, in part. Our systemic racism and lack of education on privilege and our history and how it is still happening right now is getting more to the root of it). \n\nIt is upsetting that no one had much to say about unity until the black men they knew were personally and profanely attacked by Trump. He is the President. And he is spending his time in this way, between attacking others and golf games, he's made the NFL a target. He has been this all his life. And doubled down during the election. And many NFL owners, coaches, players, were supporters. How you didn't see this coming is unbelievable to me. But. Here we are. And I am happy to see the NFL kneel for free speech. I am happy to see his divisiveness called out. I'm a bit disappointed you didn't do it until the black men you personally know were called names. The black men you didn't know were murdered and you had nothing to say. But that is the way privilege has always worked. Always. It's predictable. But I didn't expect the NFL to stand and kneel together in the way that happened this weekend and I acknowledge it, despite it's predictable faults. \n\nAs for Trump and his bad ratings rants, I'm watching and I'll get to a game this season. I'm proud of your support of free speech and protest. It was a priority for this nation when it was founded. It's in the constitution for very good reasons. At the time and throughout our history. I'm giving you a chance again. Thank you for standing and kneeling  for what is right. And for not remaining silent when a bully tried to fuck with your teammates. It took awhile. Don't ghost them. \n\nI've loved football for as long as I can remember. It's not more important to me than peoples' lives. So let's see some doubledown on helmet and head injury research. Get your game together on supporting your players and fans of all colors and genders. And keep being a unifying organization. I'm here. And this is a start. It's a really great start.
Awesome! It's about time people stood up for what's right in this country. We are this country. Our flag is us. My father fought in this country for ALL Americans Proudly . He was white but America is all colors under one flag. If you don't beleave that your not a true American. The flag or the anthem isn't the problem. The problem is the President who has no respect for all Americans by being a white supremacist and any one who disagrees with him, well...you see how he has to throw a fit like a three year old who wants his way because he has been told The King is naked. At least he must think he's king because as an American and not an American who's had their blood spilled like my family. Our flag nor our country has been disrespected or instead of a knee down they'd turn their backs. I think it's an awesome way to show the President himself we are one and do not want to be divided by Nazis, KKK or white supremacist or those hate groups who support him including him being supportive to these hate groups. We are still along way from equality for more groups then people of color, transgender, woman's rights and more but we've come a long way and we've worked had toward a better future. Why would anyone support a President who's trying to tear up what bright future moving forward and being all under one flag? He not bringing us together to be one proud country, he's doing everything at every petty opportunity to spew twisted hateful things and looks for someone to stroke his ego. He's more concerned about tearing us apart then all of us working together, respecting our differences and honoring and celebrating that. A good president would se us as ONE nation under God, all of us. To stand united. After all we are the United States. He could put his little pettiness on the side you'd think and help this country. Help those in the Hurricanes, help the people of our great country to not die because of the health crisis. Who cares if it's Obama or something else, figure out a way to help not hurt, divide and destroy!
What piano riff/song is this?
You people who are so gung ho on America please watch the documentary ‚ÄúThe Tillman Story‚Äù. A man and former NFL player who got screwed over and killed for his sincere belief for fighting for this country. He was a man who believed just like you. But never would his family believe that this government, who is supposed to be the embodiment and goodness of what the flag stands for would stoop so low as to cover up and not give straightforward answers relating to his death. And there are so many other examples besides him that I could be here for days. So, you can hype up ol‚Äô glory all you want but until justice is served for him and others by some individuals in government who want to step up and really represent what you think the flag is, but really isn‚Äôt, but should be I suggest you just keep watching football and stop being so gullible about what this country and flag represent. Because at the end of the day when the you know what hits the fan, unless it benefits ‚Äúthem‚Äù it ain‚Äôt YOU they represent as Pat and his family unfortunately found out. That‚Äôs how you know it mostly has nothing to do with race but more with keeping their individual interests at the forefront. Unfortunately, to them for that reason Pat and anyone else was/is expendable. Wake up!
I was used to respect NFL. No more.
Inside these lines will soon be no more players because these morons have ruined the game.  The NFL IS NOW DEAD!
American Football is boring as hell. 5 hours of watching a game that plays for 30seconds then stops for 5 minutes because some geezer drops the ball. The least fluid, most stop and start sports game

This video doesn't say anything that addresses racism. Needs an end title like The NFL is committed to racial equality or a statement like that. Too wishy-washy.
9/24/17 - Just like that, 47 Million Americans said F**K the NFL
Apparently not every one of your employees got the memo that today was disrespect America, cops, and the military day at the NFL.  FYI, today is also Gold Star Mothers Day.  Good job timing your childish sit in on a day that honors the mothers of members of our military who gave all so that these ungrateful scum bags can disrespect their sacrifices.\n\n\nhttps://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/9/24/16357738/alejandro-villanueva-u-s-army-veteran-lone-steeler-on-field-national-anthem
Inside those lines, they are not gods to be worshiped. Most of  these people owning, playing and watching these games, are to embarrassed to praise the Lord Jesus, who created them and died for their sins, so that they would be able to have eternal life, the greatest gift in the universe.  But they all worship a game, and mere men that run around with a ball. Most players and fans, yell, scream, fight, and act like idiots, and they are not embarrassed to do any of that. \nRoger Goodell NFL Commissioner said that President Trump's comments drew sharp criticism among professional athletes, and who called Trump‚Äôs remarks ‚Äúdivisive.‚Äù No, it was not President Trump's remarks that were divisive, no, the kneeling players, have all caused divisiveness, long before President Trump said anything. These players are disrespectful and defiant, just like the protesters on the streets. They can try and hide behind their outfits and the NFL,  but none of that will do them any good. All the one's who are disrespectful, defiant and dividers, have already come out, all over the United States, in every area of life. And the dividing lines are from the Lord Jesus, the King of Kings. Be very careful what you are doing, and who you are following, for these are the end of the last days.....\nMatthew 25:31-46New King James Version (NKJV)\nThe Son of Man Will Judge the Nations\n31¬†‚ÄúWhen the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. 32¬†All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. 33¬†And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. 34¬†Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‚ÄòCome, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35¬†for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; 36¬†I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.‚Äô\n37¬†‚ÄúThen the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? 38¬†When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 39¬†Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?‚Äô 40¬†And the King will answer and say to them, ‚ÄòAssuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.‚Äô\n41¬†‚ÄúThen He will also say to those on the left hand, ‚ÄòDepart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: 42¬†for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; 43¬†I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.‚Äô\n44¬†‚ÄúThen they also will answer Him,[b] saying, ‚ÄòLord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?‚Äô 45¬†Then He will answer them, saying, ‚ÄòAssuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.‚Äô 46¬†And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.‚Äù
Considering the NFL has a contract with the pentagon to promote the RW version of military patriotism, I sincerely doubt we'll see a true philosophical discussion regarding constitutional patriotism from a league that's sold it's soul for riches. I see a conflict of prayer circles on a field devised and promoted by money changers at the expense of it's gladiators. I'm ashamed to have played the game in college.
Congratulations to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Today you protested the flag of the only country to fight a war to end slavery and honored the flag of the very country that brought Africans to the Americas. As slaves. The Darwin awards are going to have a lot of competition this year
Does the NFL really want to double down to fail a straight-face test? ¬†This ad is just laughable from a league that normalizes violence (domestic abuse, crime, etc.), whose execs cover up the brain damage resulting from relentless hits and one with a longstanding history of early deaths. Best to let these out-of-control leagues die their own death, and quickly, I hope. ¬†This latest self-indulgence from players, who probably can't even string two sentences together about the actual history of the Stars Spangled Banner, is nothing more than the loud cry of ceasing to be relevant (can someone say empty stadiums and declining ticket sales). ¬†I am not down on football altogether, my family watches select college games where players have real heart -- funny how that happens when you put love of the game first and don't live in some ridiculous circus born of eight figure salaries.
I'd still like to know how this display has changed anything. It hasn't. We still have people rioting in St Louis two years after Ferguson. So you can kneel, demonstrate all you want but how about take action and go do something in your communities. It seems to me this kneeling is an easy way out and a way for players to get their 5 minutes of fame on ESPN. It accomplishes nothing except for irritating 1/2 of the country. The media does a fine job on bringing racial Injustices to our attention, I don't think NFL players heightened awareness, just irritated people more.
Games > National Symbols\nIf you think that you have played too much football
If people should stand for an anthem, then why shouldn't people stand and pray to God Almighty? Taking God out of everything is where it's all went wrong.üòá
Too bad these narcissist millionaires will never discuss what the protests are supposed to be about. https://www.blackandblondemedia.com/2017/09/23/kneeling-players-need-look-mirror-insulting-trump/
NFL, people won‚Äôt see this video if you keep blocking other sites from embedding it. Fix yourself
46 years ago my first job was with the NFL. I am done watching grown man knelling before our National Anthem. ¬†The NFL just lost my support.

All of these people who are mad at the NFL be mad at yourself for refusal if to grow beyond what you were taught. Have fun bowling, eating, or watching some other shows during football season. Just remember it's only a small amount of you guys. Y'all are dumb as hell if you think the entire world feels the way you do. I also would like to know have you tried your racism ( you know name calling and such) blatantly in the face of some of these black ppl you claim you hate? The NFL will gain more fans than they will lose them. #ignorant #goodbye

This debate should be between the corporations and their customers. I just wish I didn't have to give them a dime. That's why the true answer is to ABOLISH ALL TAX CUTS AND CRONYISM THEY GET. Let them pay for their own stadiums. We should charge them retroactively. No hotel taxes should go to these race enablers. Make it illegal for local governments to bribe these teams to set up shop or do spring training. Take it all away. Let it be a free market. Let the consumers reject these asshole nigger lovers.
INSIDE THESE LINES are a bunch of senseless, self-centered, childish millionaire malcontents who have no respect for the country that gave them the opportunity be where they are at.
Please don't act as if Trump has caused this problem, it has been going on since last year. People have been arguing about it since it first began. It's sad that people don't seem to understand that yes, they have a right to their own beliefs and opinions but what they don't have the right to do is disrespect the paying customer. They can do it on their own time on their own dime. Our home for one will be boycotting the NFL and any other sports league that thinks they can belittle the people in my family that have served in the military.
Inside these lines all view points are welcome and we respect each other. Just make sure your viewpoint isn't excessively conservative or we have to fire you... but disrespecting the flag, praising terrorists, beating your wife, children.. thats all good of course.
Boycott the NFL.
I won't be watching tonight's game or NFL network for some time after what I just saw the Jags and Raven's do during the anthem.  I'll probably just go bowling instead.
#BoycottNFL #BoycottNFLSponsors Disrespecting our flag and country will not stand!!
NFL sucks now
This is good. https://www.facebook.com/newlypress/videos/1891423541122018/
I wonder how many of these America-loving military-loving people supported Trump? The same guy that's a noted draft dodger. The same guy that said of John McCain and other POW's I like people who weren't captured. The same guy that attacked a gold star family (the Khan's). And the same guy that defends the confederacy (a bunch of traitors to the flag that he now claims to love).
Unity?  How are you promoting unity when you allow your spoiled ingrate millionaires to attack the very people who are providing a safe and secure venue for them to play in?  The message they are sending is this: cops lives do not matter, if a criminal is black he can kill a cop any time he wants.  That's the message the NFL has now adopted.  You absolutely suck and I hope the NFL goes bankrupt.
Yeah, NFL (National Felons League), preach unity while practicing division and defending those who hate America, the police, and those who died defending it.  That's certainly a winning ticket.
How dare you put Pat Tillman in this video. Do you think Pat Tillman would condone these people taking knees and disrespecting the flag he died for? Disgusting
Slightly off topic...\n\nCurious. Why is it that many players for the Ravens and Jags took a knee during the playing of the national anthem of the United States, yet stood for the national anthem of the United Kingdom? It seems strange to me that these players would kneel for the anthem of the nation that gives them (and anyone) the freedom to be employed in a multi-million dollar business, and allowing them to live their lives as they see fit, yet stand for the anthem that enslaved most of their ancestors, and most of the continent of Africa. \n\nOn a personal note, I find it appalling that these people are making a spectacle of themselves for misguided reasons at best. These people take a knee for 'police brutality'? Read crime statistics and you'll notice that more whites are shot by police than blacks are, and for the number of blacks shot by police to be equal to whites it would take law enforcement about 40 years at current rates to become equal. If you look at statistics, people of all races get shot by police for not following simple instructions. You want to resist arrest and fight the cops? You want to shoot at a cop? You want to try to run from a cop? Yeah, good luck with that.\n\nFurthermore, why is it that 13% of the population (Which is more like 7% since black women generally don't murder) responsible for 51% of the murders in the US? Why is it that a black man is 80% more likely to be murdered by another black man? In just the city of Chicago from 2001-2010 there have been nearly 7500 blacks murdered by other blacks. Think about that. More black people have been killed by other blacks, than all the soldiers that have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan in the same amount of time.\n\nIf these players were taking a knee as a way of showing the problems in the black community, I would a little less appalled about their actions. \n\nHowever whilst I agree they have the right to protest, the president has the same right to call them out on it. Also keep in mind the 1st Amendment only applies to the government, not private industry. If I did something along the same lines at my place of employment, I would probably have my company lose 50% of its customers, or customers that I dealt with on a personal level, then I would be fired, and for a good reason.  The only reason this commercial is a thing, is simply due to the fact, behind closed doors, the NFL is feeling the heat, and/or beginning to shit their pants. The NFL ratings and sales are down over the last 3 seasons. When the NFL, and broadcasters, (CBS in particular) lose $200 million in advertising revenue alone, in just a few weeks into the season, you know the shit is hitting the fan. Look at the last Thursday night game as an example. There were tons of empty seats. Hell, tickets were being sold for as low at $17. This commercial is a weak attempt at best to try to quell the rising anger many Americans are feeling from the politically left, and the social justice warriors.
Lol... Why is kneeling disrespectful when practicing your right to protest is the American way but waving the confederate flag which stands for treason  is not disrespectful to the America!? We fought, black and white for freedom to express ourselves and now that's disrespectful? A lot of yall need to do yall homework. Yall crying tears over the wrong things. The first person she'd their blood for America was a BLACK MAN. There's nothing wrong with protesting by kneeling. People are actually more upset about these quiet peaceful protest then they were about the confederate flags and monuments being removed. They talk about criminals who hate the police and the  confederate flag celebrates criminals who can't get over that they lost.
Just realize who pays your salaries. Not Trump, you are pissing off the American people, best of luck in your protests, but the fans will decide the fate of the NFL. I can learn to like rugby.
Love that video.  The end was on point.
Ignore the spoiled child that couldn't get in with the cool kids and protest as much as you'd like.
Hello friend I am like and subscribe your video channel please subscribe my channel
Pat Tillman would not appreciate the use of his image to promote disrespecting, anti-American sons of bitches.
All it took was a 71 year old man to turn a bunch of manly football players into wimpy whiny girly boys\n\nI won't pay my hard earned money to be putting up with this. \n\nI want to be entertained, not lectured by a bunch of spoiled bazillionaires.
Football is a form of entertainment. I resent having to put up with political football. There is a place for dissent. It has no place on the field whether it is refusing to enter the field while the anthem plays or as players take a knee. If I wanted politics I'd know exactly where to go. Since it has now entered the stadium I refuse to participate in the division it has engendered.
The NFL is shit!
Worthless if they think that will change my mind about gutless cowards disrespect the flag, the anthem, the government, police and the military the NFL is dead wrong, I am telling my friends all this can be protested before the game or after the game, the NFL does not have to do it during the national anthem. If the want a protest find do it some other time, but since the damage is done and we now know the NFL and their players are anti-American then that leaves this veteran no other choice but to boycott the NFL. After a loosing season of revenues the they may come to their senses and figure another way players can voice their opinion, but not during the national anthem if they hate America that much they need to leave. Boycott the NFL, which will stand for Not For Long.
NFL games are big service businesses.  It is the patrons/fans that patronize their services and products that made them big.  Soon or later the NFL  Team owners and management will realize their bottom line is going down because clients are getting insulted and will become discontent whenever NFL players show disrespect to our Flag and  National Anthem.
After watching the NFL every weekend for the last 30 years, we are finished with the NFL and will never watch a game or buy a ticket again.  They can choose to protest whatever they want, and we can choose to not watch or attend games.  Everyone I know who was an NFL fan is doing the same.  Members of two clubs I belong to have also demanded that NFL games not be played in the bars.  This is the beginning of the end of the NFL.
GO NFL. FUCK DONALD TRUMP.
The NFL doesn't hold a monopoly on Blacks and Whites getting along. Disgusting ad.
Screw the NFL
Trump 2020
NFL disrespects the AMERICAN GROUND they stand on--ANTI AMERICAN FILTH
The NFL is kind of a cultural institution. I don't think that Trump can win a fight with them. Presidents come and go, but football is forever.
Dope üíØ‚ùåüíØ
I just watched this ad & I have to wonder why are these players disrespecting America?\nDo they even know why they are disrespecting America?
GOOD ON YOU, NFL!!  GOOD ON ROGER GOODELL!!  THANK YOU FOR THIS!  Now, let's demand an end to innocent Americans being shot and killed on our streets.
Sadly, Trump seems to have once again divided the poor people in America who need good, affordable health care, education and opportunity. While Trump sparks controversy about statues and anthems, Congress continues to let down the people who need a good government to make their lives better.
TOTAL BS
Inside these lines, we don't have to spend a dime of our money to you arrogant, overpaid, entitled, disrespectful idiots. Interesting that that video didn't show one clip of the players kneeling during anthem, if you're so proud of it, why wasn't it in the video? #BOYCOTTNFL
Trump threw gasoline on a simmering racial fire. The unity between players, owners and hopefully fans can put it out. Don't let him poison sports with his phony flag waving. Real men are not threatened by peaceful protest.
Today is the worst day ever, not only both of my teams lost, but politics is in sports and I fucking hate that, stick to sports. Awesome commercial by the NFL.
Good, let the whole damn stadium sit until that childish, hot head of a president is out of office!
Savage answer to pundits who still don't get it
I just want to take a moment here and say that I LOVE cum
The president needs to work on making America great again! So far, he's not doing such a good job!
I'm not a football fan but I have nothing but respect for the players that are protesting. The way the NFL is backing them makes me think better of them as an organization. #Resist
This is a wise response to the divisive influence of the Man who occupies the White House...who should know better.
What is the song on this commercial?
WHOOOOOP! Will the Demo be on the EShop on the switch????
YES love to see the game coming on can't wait for it be released I'm gonna play it all day everyday !!! Keep up the work !
Wow, looks awesome! How do you play it? Is it twin stick or two player or what?

Oh my GOSH!!!! Geeking out so hard right now. I can't believe you got THE PATRICK TA to do your makeup. He does the most amazing make-up looks and is a TRUE artist. You are such a lucky girl!!
This was so relaxing to watch!! Xo
What was Patrick wearing? Honey??
MY BABY IS BEAUTIFUL
Ugh, just love him! Your makeup was flawless! ‚ù§Ô∏è

OMG he's such a talent! Gorgeous look, babe - your skin looks amazing! xx
I absolutely love how your look turned out. U look amazing <3 And I love your attitude. You're so grateful for all the amazing things that you're experiencing - and it shows!! XO <3
This is sooo pretty! I love high end makeup. And Patrick is amazing!
He so knows what he's doing! Your makeup looks stunning! xoxo, caylie
Omggg I love him! So happy to see two of my faves in one video üòçüòç
I love his work so much!! I have so many questions to be answered by him omg.. haha. Loved the results of course. Your skin looks flawless! (with and without makeup) <3
Wow, your makeup is stunning, totally enhances your natural beauty. Patrick is a very talented makeup artist.
Aaaah this video is amazing! I loved it soooo much!ü§ó beautiful look btw!üòäüíñ
what a cool video! you look Fab!!
I love seeing the contrast between how someone does their own makeup and how another person would approach doing makeup on that same person.
Omg I love his makeup looks that he does for celebs ‚ô•Ô∏è
such a luxe brand and patrick ta? you must have felt so spoiltüë∏üèºxx
Gorgeous üòòüòò
Love it
I was wondering what face suncream you would recommend for wearing in the sun with makeup?
Gorgeous but you look stunning without makeup too üòä
So glad you shared the full thing instead of cutting it for a Vlog!! You look gorgeous!
This look is beautiful, feminine, clean, fresh. ¬†I like the eyebrows, not too dark, subtle, feminine, and not too much contouring on the rest of the face. ¬†Looks a bit more natural, ¬†amazing!
Omg! Patrick ta .. love you!!
La mer is my fav skincare brand <3 ¬†love the look btw :)
Any makeup look, looks gorgeous on you üíóüåü
Stunning :D x
I cringed when he rested his fingers on your face and eyelid to apply makeup. A good makeup artist knows better.  Did he sanitize his hands beforehand and why doesn't he have a type of sponge or cushion to hold between your skin and his hand?\nOf course, you looked beautiful as always.
The make up look so fab!!! Xx
Needs subtitles, no idea what he's saying half of the time
I absolutely LOVED watching this, I found it such a calming & informative chat. I nearly choked on my olive when Patrick mentioned Tom Ford Sable Smoke lipstick, it's probably my all time fave!!!! Doesn't Patrick have the most amazing skin?\nHugs Adele xoxo
His hands are so damn beautiful!
Makeup isn't really my thing, but Patrick had such a nice personality and you're always such a pleasure to watch that I loved this video!!
He looked like he was being so gentle!!!  I think I rub my face off üòÇü§£
he seems so sweet and professional! This makeup looks amazing on you x
You look so prettyyy! I love it!!! I need a Patrick in my life hahah
Omg i love Patrick!!!! Such a great video babe xx
Ohhh you sassy pair you slay, this video is cute as. üòçüòò

Lyrics\nI found a love for me\nDarling just dive right in\nAnd follow my lead\nWell I found a girl beautiful and sweet \nI never knew you were the someone waiting for me\n'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love\nNot knowing what it was\nI will not give you up this time\nBut darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own\nAnd in your eyes you're holding mine\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\nWhen you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath\nBut you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight\nWell I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know\nShe shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home\nI found a love, to carry more than just my secrets\nTo carry love, to carry children of our own\nWe are still kids, but we're so in love\nFighting against all odds\nI know we'll be alright this time\nDarling, just hold my hand\nBe my girl, I'll be your man\nI see my future in your eyes\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\nWhen I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful\nI don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight\nBaby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms\nBarefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song\nI have faith in what I see\nNow I know I have met an angel in person\nAnd she looks perfect\nI don't deserve this\nYou look perfect tonight\nSongwriters: Ed Sheeran\nPerfect lyrics ¬© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC

as a city fan \n. imo  I think our cbs  are OK but they look a bit shacky at times without Kompany \nI think in the transfer window buy a world class cb to parter Kompany. had a decent back up. if Kompany gets injured  or someone in the defence \n also get sanchez if we can get him on a free transfer .\nI think a great format would be 5 city 3.4.3\nthat's my opinion  \npls don't hate
City will win the premier league.\nGet to the UCL finals.\nScore the most European goals.\nCome back after the season to see I'm rightüòâ
6:32 what's that lady doing?\nBeing racist.\nFire her right now.\nDisrespecting Benjamin Mendy.
I'm a Liverpool fan but I think city are the best team in the world behind Real Madrid
City have to get a result against Chelsea next week
City the best.
We were far from our best yesterday but still romped home to a 5-0 victory. Good fuckin signs
Well we almost scored, does that count ?
Grande vit√≥ria City... Danilo entrou muito bem no jogo e na minha opini√£o √© um dos melhores laterais do mundo... CityBrasil !!!!
Come on city ! congrats from a greek fan!
Is it possible to have a cam on the other side of the glass in the tunnel?
I liked the old tunnel better.. this has too many stairs and it's a bit narrow
City 5-0 Liverpool \nCity 6-0 Watford \nCity 5-0 Crystal Palace\n16 goals in 3 games the EPL is ours this year

City r probs top 3 teams right now maybe even first.
Aww, Roy seems like a nice old man. I feel bad for him :(
Kyle walker and Townsend talking about each other going bald 5:50
Love to see the footballers and managers interact with the children like that.

These videos where we welcome the opposing teams and managers is starting to get creepy. It's starting to look like a horror film. Welcome to the Etihad Mr Hodgson you've always been the caretaker here 60 minutes later 5 goal axe to the chest
What is the name of the song at 3:20~3:40??
Crystal palace walking out the tunnel not knowing a 5-0 scoreline is waiting for them on the pitch.
I don't know when or how BUT something tells me you'll crush a bit: I mean have some few indecent results.
Wish United did something like this... The behind the scenes of any major club is fascinating
Sick to see how the Gulf Arabs have bought English football ....
#KDB that pass to Aguero for Sterling goal Dayummmm If Man City keep Sharp and begin to Clinically Finish including half chances they'll continue this #ScoringFeast on Chelsea and everyone else #Sterling how many bloody easy chances do you need before you score?
Look at the man on the left... Look at the top of his headüòÄ 3:11
why aguero always looks like he is forever alone??
Im worried for chelsea man. 5-0 in 2 games. City has some quality signings in arras where wthey were weak last seasons

2nd
City were far from best despite 5-0
Oh yea Ederson #whataguy\n\nAnd wtf was that lady doing at 6:32
The trophy is ours.
The only reason i come to this channel
Everytime CityTV posts a new video, it feels like a Christmas to me. Thanks a lot!
At 6:32 why did that woman push that kid away from Mendy?
I was there when we had the no doubt win

City needs to relax
Wots all this Manchester City rubbish?    It's a team full of foreign geezers, managed by another foreigner...in a league owned by an Australian....so what's wiv the Manchester city rap?  It's owned by Arab geezers...an Manchester don't come into it at all...anywhere. A much better name fer these geezers would be MECCA CITY.
Get mikey burrows back on this
I was screaming that much at the end of that game when the goal went in,  my throat is still hurting
We always do it the hard way dont we üòÇüòÇ
We're on our way, we're on our way to the Premier League we're on our way!üî∂üî∂
What a game! Great atmosphere too FWAW ‚ñ™Ô∏èüî∏‚ñ™Ô∏èüî∏
Unbelievable dive from the Barnsley player to con the ref into giving a free kick from which they scored. Good character from Wolves.
im a sheffield wednesday fan but wednesday night i will be a wolves fan hoping you can give us somthing to cheer about..all the pigs (blades fans ) have been on radio bragging about how they are the best team in the league and nobody can match them...lets hope you can bring them down to earth with a bang
As I said to my father (this is our 25th year as Season Ticket holders together) at full time; this is why we love this game. I owe him a lot for my love of football. I will try to pass it on.
These highlights mek our support look like the bluenoses..
can we return van la parra
If we can play poorly ans still manage to get 3 points like yesterday, shows we have the character to be up there with the best.
What a match! I was on the right hand side, the Steve bull bit.
That second wolves goal may be one of the most important this season
97 likes, one dislike.... one lone Brummie looking up from the the deepest mine to see Wolves in the clouds :)
It looked like Coady came from out the South Bank to celebrate the winner.
I was confident enobakare would get going with his goals, two In two, hopefully that boosts his confidence and he can push on from here!
Never screamed so much in my life #COYW
My throats still hurts
Cough cough *1-2 Cardiff* cough cough
–¶–∏—Ä–∫ :)
That dive
WAW
Im not a wolves fan . But they won me ¬£300 quid on my acca (Squeaky bum towards the end)  so just for that I hope they make it up to the prem

My propaganda ‚Äúposter‚Äù was roasting the heck out of Napoleon. The reason I chose this is because roasting people, in the current scheme of things, is something that is very commonplace and considered humorous by most. I figured this was a good way to connect to my audience, as Napoleon was a pretty easy guy to flame. Bad hairline, ditched his army like a weak niBBa, made himself an emperor, and too many baguettes, if you know what I mean. The list could go on forever, but I simply wanted to make a video comparing him to images that would make the class laugh. If you want to get technical however, then this video could easily be described as a modern take on what would likely be an anti-Napoleon poster, adapted for a 21st-century audience and created with modern flavor. Please don‚Äôt fail me, this actually took longer than you would think. I didn‚Äôt eat dinner either. \n But we all know Napoleon, Obama, and Tupac are time and space travelers that dump asexual boy testosterone chemicals in the water. How else do you think we killed off the dinosaurs? They have been doing it for years, but humans have become more used to it at this point. Kids have been eating these chemicals in their afternoon snacks, one of the largest culprits being Tyson Chicken. Although the way i'm describing it seems harmless but it's not. Our generation had been getting mentally weak, ‚Äútoo liberal‚Äù if you will. #stopTysonChicken @sentedcruz

More videos please!!!!!!!
Who thought that the video was fake?
Ronaldo is such a baller. On and of the park. Reminds me of Les Twins.
I would be red as enything
Chris you are too lucky to meet ronaldo
He puts make-up that dome of him
I could sense the awkardness when that girl said it's running out of time
Where is the mercurial am done üíÄ üòÇ lmao
If this was ksi interviewing half of the video would be him laughing
Me (if I met Ronaldo): I-I just- I- *passes out*
The reference to Allen Iverson is very wrong.
It's a birthday gift
Damn I bet that blew this little kids mind, I would be trippin balls
oh.. this chrisMD that ksi talk about in his little boy song...
Best YouTuber  there is , if anyone deserved that it was you :) been a sub from before 30k
cal looked so fucking nervous in the photo lmao
you are so lucky! im crying to meet him he is my idol
dribbing is good ! the pass.. no !o!  what you gonna do with that now ?!)
That is not him. He dodsnt speak English you rrtard
for those who are wondering  what Cristiano said at 6:03 , he said this guy was cool, he know what he is doing
In the end he spoke portuguese and he said, hes cool nice skills not bad things like that, you welcome üëçüèª
He said in Portuguese to his guys is that you're good and you have talent
A good smell? I'm sold!
You are living the life and we are struggling for a bit of bread here in Morocco
Where's all the Fifa 18?
Messi is better
6:03 probably you understood 0, but I¬¥m portuguese so I got all, what he ment is:  He plays very well dude, he plays well.... that was it, no need to thank, keep up
he said this guy is cool in portuguese
Ronaldo said in portugues:he is fine he a actually cool at football
thats my dream to meet him and to be a footballplayer       oh my ronaldo !!!
What an awkward thing. You meet Ronaldo and you basically sellout on the fragrance and show him things out on your phone.

MY FAV FOOTBALLER CR
Wtf
Are u a freestyle
Ronaldo is the best
Can i meet Ronaldo too?
OMG
Yo shoutout to Ronaldo for mentioning AI
video feels like 20 minutes not 7 wtf
gotta love CR7 man
You from Moldova? I am from Moldova
He is such a good person! And so cool from you, that you was not crazy to see him but just respect him as a normal person and not as a Super-Star! I think that's how to talk with a Cristiano, Messi or any other Football-Star and that is, what makes you at least so cool as Cristiano is!
You make a video with Cristiano Ronaldo and 90% of the footage of you is explaining bullshit to him... Cmon man
go show our sweetheart assistant some love !\nalexandra's youtube channel : http://bit.ly/2hnNP2x\n\nalso, our video 5 HABITS OF CALM PEOPLE is veeeery nice : http://bit.ly/2jUYouR\n\nlove // jenny
First: YOUR ASSISTANT IS FUCKING GORGEOUS HOLY SHIT\n\nSecond: You totally look like a different person with eyebrows. Beauty is different to everyone and I personally think you look so much better with eyebrows. HOWEVER, having no eyebrows is what makes you YOU and you‚Äôve come to dominate the ‚Äúno eyebrow high fashion vegan‚Äù type look lol. Whatever you choose is great.
So here are my thoughts\n1: cute, natural, and kind of pixie like.\n2: boring and lacking personality\n3: bad ass babe
I like the first ones best but I really love no brows c:
2nd one was best. You pull off the now brow look but wow brows make you look younger somehow!
Wowza!! #2 was super pretty! Slightly more neat towards the middle and I feel like that would suit you best
I'd like to request a Brows Pt 2 video!! I was really hoping you would do 1920's/1930's Greta Garbo inspired eyebrows!!
How did she make it look like real hair? Oh gosh! üòçüòçüòç So much skills!
You look so pretty with eye brows! But with or with out your still gorgeous‚ù§ personally liked the first version**
Loved 2 on you but you look awesome brow or no brow!
wowsa, that's a different look for you, that's for sure! the 2nd pair looked good
You look beatiful both ways! I don't know why, but your eyes look bigger with the eye brows, did I just think that?
Holy crap! you look like a totally different person! The first ones make you look softer.
wait whoa she looks like Jared Leto is it just me lol
you look so so pretty and youthful with the first brows! oh my gosh xxx
Tbh they make you look younger.
Such a pretty makeup look
You're so pretty üòç
You should absolutely consider growing eyebrows \nAnd instabrows fits you perfectly
You looked so young, romantic and innocent with the first brows. \nBut initially, the 3. brows really matched your fierce personality in an eminent way. !\n(Instagram brows seem too mainstream for you)
number 3 hands down, you dont look meaner, you  actually somehow look more youthful and joyful..
Agreed - the second ones look gorgeous on you. With them you remind me of Taylor Swift but you look so much better. Lots of love üñ§
The no brows makes you look like an alien hehe I liked the first & second one
lol i  was like where did i see alex before...oh right i follow her on ig lol
You look so nice with and with out brows. You look like one of my high school friends or maybe a movie actress who's name escapes me when you have eyebrows. I like 2 & 3 the best.
I just love your hair in the end !
Number two for real life but number three for youtube!
Hi Jenny, I have a question. Is there going to be a minimalistic calander for in 2018?
I don't have eyebrows either- I feel the pain üòÇüòÇ
I love eyebrow #3. They look really sleek. I don't think others could get away with those brows!
You don't look like a bully because you have eyebrows. You look human.
I like both with and without brows, but with brows you look better as to me.
I love no 1.  I think you look lovely with brows.
i dont think she looks good with brows haha
I liked her with instagram eyebrows and It would look really good with the natural brows with MORE hair than she drew.
You look good with eyebrows, specially the second one..
Kudos to you for having some fun :).
I liked 2 the best but you look beautiful without them
Love #3\nEyebrows make you look more warm & friendly and less cold
She looks so good with brows!  Good with out too tho
You look younger with brows. But I agree that you look really great without them, it definitely suits and highlights your features and aesthetic
Were your natural eyebrows alike to the make up eyebrows? Did you recognize yourself from the past?
Yep, #2 was the best.\nEdit: even tho you are very pretty no matter what.
I love all of these looks on you, but I am definitely partial to your precious alien princess face that you normally rock.
Wow you looked beautiful with all three but my favorite is one and two. Number three should be just for special events. I personally don't like them so obvious and painted on any one. She is extremely talented !
You look so awesome with brows, damn. It seriously makes you look like a runway model.
I am amazed how good you look with eyebrows. BUT the no eyebrow looks is more authentic.  so don't listen to what I like . bahahahhaha
Also you look younger
It literally made no difference the first one. You could totally wear that and no one would notice üòÇüòÇ
You are properly not use to them dear but they look great on you xxoo like #2 as well :)
You look sooooo good with the 3# and also younger!!! It smooths your face and armonize it. I really like your style without eyebrows but their fits you more than expected! Love it!
You look so stupid without brows ... Brows make you so beautifull and young ...
I think you are more beautiful without  eyebrows... you are so special, and you look so pure. \nBut of course even with eyebrows you are very, very pretty. :)
I like number 1 or 2! I think It makes you look younger/ friendlier! Not that you're bad without them, just that with them, you are more friendly looking!
Adore the natural first look! Jenny is beautiful regardless though <3
The second version looked so amazing on you!!!
I much prefer her with eyebrows (I even kinda like the last ones!) but she's more than entitled to do whatever she wants with her face. I have purple hair and people always say I should go back to brown, that doesn't mean I'm ever gonna do it! Everyone should learn to live their lives how they want and not care what others think.
I didn't know what I would think about this... I thought it would look like other people but I think it actually looks bizarre. Not bad not good but maybe normal? But then when I looked again it is actually distracting on you. I can't even put into words that make sense lol you look so good without them that I can't process your face with eyebrows haha
From far the 90s one looks super good but the second one is the best
I kinda want to shave my eyebrows off, cuz you look amazing and I have eyebrows in general
Body art of mock tattoos üò±
so much better
Number 3
u look prettier with eyebrows
number 3
2
You looks pretty without eyebrows!
#3 is beautiful but all of them looked amazing!
You look like a completely different person. Definitely not mean but absolutely gorgeous and forever young. #3 are my fave.
I thought you would look weirder with eyebrows but you still look great! \nI love Alexandras instagram btw, I've been following her for a while. I think I found her in Veganer i Sverige ‚úåüèª
You should have done a poll on the video for people's favourite brows! I loved 2nd brows on you and I hate myself for saying it but I totally preferred you with brows! üôà Live your best life though, Jenny!
shaving eyebrows isn't minimalistic at all, it's an extra effort that doesn't even fit in a minimalistic daily routine, isn't it? Plus it looks better, just let them grow and do nothing to it..
I love this :) I have a question for you: are you vegan? :* Love your channel!
i think a mix between the first and third one would be the best
2nd one looks great! You shoud think about growing your eyebrows back!
You look like a completely different person with eyebrows! I do prefer the second look. Thank you for the video :o)
2.
Three is perfect!!!
2
You look sooo much younger with eyebrows !
3
Are you swedish
Number 3! Idk you look 10 years younger ahah
Jenny, you look gorgeous with brows!!
2
number 2 looked epic
#3 looks amaze!
2
Wowww no eyebrows or eyebrows #3 you slay either way Jenny! =)
#3 !
90's brows would be over plucked thin brows .
#3 for sure!!!
I like all 4
3
#3
2
MY GOD you're rocking those eyebrows!
no 2 :)
The third ones look dope!

Black cabbies go through extensive checks and have to memorize every street in London for their license test. Uber is putting our iconic black cabbies out of pocket. Good riddance.
Never understood the point of this 'Uber'. Taxis still exist, so why do we need some branded taxi to make normal taxis obsolete for literally no reason?
Doesn't London have one of the worlds best public transport systems?\nUse that instead.
I mean in reality ubers aren't really the best service anyways considering how there us usually plenty of issues with uber drivers.  Talk about safety by getting into a car with a stranger. that's clearly safe.  that is if it even fcking turns up in the first place after taking cash
Taxi very expensive in London, taxi driver is racists
I know a white English mum that is an Uber driver. It's a good job for a mum.
Mostly Muslim rapes that got there  licence revoked but you won't hear that on the news will you.
pathetic to apologise for what uber have been doing for so long.
There are TWO Londons & Why it MATTERS\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl-DVgHVzgY
I'm more worried about the thousands of people that lost their jobs
People are freaking out? Fuck off. It's called A TAXI? Yunno them black cabs people used before UBER came along. Half of them were rude anyway. Fucking foreign pricks.
Yeah they do not comply to the law ,
Hi please can some people look at my channel
Hey women will get free rides and pleasure in black cabs in London... If you know what I mean
Isn't there any private hires in London?  Ffs most taxis have apps now and did before we had Uber over here
Time to move to the city of England
At least it's better than Coby Persin picking up uber riders in a Bugatti
Probably because the government get more tax from black cabs I'm guessing?

This is all down to Black Cab Drivers unable to deal with competition.  Black Cab Drivers have just lost the little credibility they were clinging on to.

Wow this is stupid, the dramatic music and everything smh it's Uber ffs just get a fucking cab with your first world issues, dickhead.
Uber is a bad company
There's many other minicab offices that will benefit from this
Search Youtube for Arcade City.  Just saying.
On another note I have tried to take many forms of transport in London and because I'm a panda they won't take me, so I just gallop, like a horse, so I won't look too suspicious. Would you like to come sightseeing around London with me? The one and only Cheeky Panda! Follow the link for the first episode in the series. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfMdXHOIH6I
üëéThis offends me as a vegan transgender hipster Native-American-Indo-Chinese hybrid alien agnostic-atheist German engineer who vapes fairtrade organic decaffeinated compressed and hydrated extra-protein soy breast milk on the regular and does Hindi Kama Sutra naked crossfit yoga 5 times per week. I'm also a nonbinary trigender genderqueer male feminist and identify myself as a pastafarian pansexual genderfluid Apache helicopter dog of mega multi alpha beta gamma delta omega combo god of hyper death who's in a polygamous polyamorous relationship to the chihuahua which helped me cross the border of Mexico because it hates Donald Trump.

Uber is not the only taxi app available lyft , Addison Lee ,hailo and many more .
Thank fuck √úber has lost it . Most of there driver are dirty smelly pedo Muslim. üëçüèºüëçüèº \nLove live the British London black cab driver üëçüèºüá¨üáßüëçüèºüá¨üáß
Fuck uber I'd rather get raped on the bus
These drivers can work for their local cab company, so most jobs aren't lost. Customers can use other app to get taxis such as Kabbie to get a cab for a reasonable price.
It's about time!! I was a taxi driver. You either sign up and be an uber driver or lose out ... uber will put every taxi firm out of business and as a company they should have made certain changes to keep people safe and haven't. I hope they lose the right to do business in every town and city in the UK
Didn't Londoners vote for labour control. It's just the labour way.
I've never used Uber- I'm 19 and much prefer traditional cabs. Same prices so...
Drunk students will be stranded I guess
If you're a student and you can afford a taxi period there's something wrong there
Hahaha long live the black cabs. Fuck you uber
Just take the bus.
Guys it's easy just use Wallington cars and couriers. They are actually a really good service
Britain is a failing country, the government basically own you.
Can we all just stfu about politics and get on? In real life you don't bite each other's heads of!
Uber is getting its arse kicked about time
Great news uber sneaking about not paying taxes all though the back door get a proper black cab
Who else is just relaxed knowing there not in London right now? üò•üôè
OMG GOD how are people going to get around now\n\n\n\n\nbecause humans never moved until Uber was made
Losing Uber is great news for London. Black Cabs are an institution and something we should all be proud of.
jesus christ people just get a car or bike if you can't afford it.
Good. The knowledge beats all.
Please help a brother reach 50 subs!
Uber hasn't paid any tax whilst operating in the U.K. What so ever! And they're being taken of the streets as they're a risk to health and safety after a growing number of rapes and sexual assaults, get a black cab, they're a lot safer, professional and English, black taxi prices are higher but that extra 3 quid ensures your safety around London
Just walk kids, it ain‚Äôt that far a few miles in 45 mins to save ¬£30 by not taking a cab is ez
I love uber. This is absolute nonsense
i see the cancer is thriving in the comments
Its an APP? Why don't they just copy it & make it state run? Put all profits towards fixing the roads etc. Screw Uber's mega rich shareholders.
*Hey you! I have been working on my channel for almost 3 years now and i was wondering if maybe you could check out some of my videos, let me know how im doing, how far ive come etc*
Good when uber drivers trying to kill our police out side Buckingham palace. Rapes extortion etc.
Don't really care about the passengers, but think of all the people in london that have lost their jobs.
I watched TAXI Driver sat in the back of a TAXI whilst eating a TAXI bar once. Whilst a plane TAXIed on a nearby runway. All this typing is quite TAXIng
Uber drivers are not necessary in London due to excellent public transport.
Capitalism at its finest right here... oh wait
They need to employ some female sexual predators other wise there just being sexist , or maybe just top less ones , just start a new company called Boober I'd be there biggest customer
Wanna know why people are complaining?\n\nMost uber drivers shut up and drive
BUT I CAN STILL USE MY UBER APP
London is my country.
Fucking first world problems hahahhaha deal with it ya spoilt cunts
Yay!
Haha they are fucked
One word lyft

Hi
https://youtu.be/NfVcATLVGSI
Shouldn't let rapists and pedophiles work for Uber most of them can't even speak English
So they should be banned.  Cheap ass service.  The drivers don't have the knowledge or passion for the position.  It's a vocation if you do it right.  Half of uber drivers can barely speak English so fuck em.  Go get a job at mc d's.  The drivers aren't qualified in nvq or neither do they have regular crb checks or medicals such as a drugs test.   Cheap ass service for cheap ass people.
To that retards last comment if you want to be safe move out of London living costs are cheaper and crime is lower its not the government's responsibility to make sure your safe everything you decide to go out and piss yourself so badly you can't walk at 3 in the morning grow up
London isn't London anymore its owned by foreign aliens
SIGN THIS ONLINE PETITION TO SAVE OUR UBERS \nhttps://www.change.org/p/save-your-uber-in-london-saveyouruber\n\n\nLIKE THIS SO THAT LOTS OF PEOPLE SEE IT
Now the Islamic state of london will have to ride their goats to the mosk instead
*This is why UK is trash. Theyre always so against capitalism and the free market. Reason why those Americans have made far more advancements than us fucking foreigners. These black cabs need to realize that we are in the modern age. Their jobs shouldnt last forever without any form of change or competition. Entrepreneurs are constantly creating things that will challenge somthing that has been so instilled in our lives that sooner or later, people just have to accept that fact that we must evolve and allow things to take its natural course.   You cant stop technology from further entering and changing our lives.*

I like how she talks about owning a gun and reloading it when she's not old enough to own a gun. She also looks completely dead during this she's genuinely ugly
I don't know why, but there's something about her that I really like. Maybe it's the fact that she does the opposite of what a girl her age normally does or because she just doesn't give a shit about peoples opinion. No matter what it is, I am here for danielle bregoli.
Deji: Yeh bitch, i was the come up, im the foundation for you to go run up.
If you actually like this. There is something mentally wrong with you.
Do a track with Drake??
Idk y people bashing her songs they actually lit af üëåüèæüëåüèæ keep doing your thing girl fuck what others got to say

I thought you were shallow and stupid when I saw dr Phil, not gonna lie. But now that I've seen more of you, I really can see a brain! And a heart, and it doesn't seem like you're shallow. You really are talented! And so beautiful! Keep changing peoples opinions of you like you did me. Wish you the best!
Just when I thought Yahty & all those other Urkel's were the most talentless people doing hip hop, along comes this Dr. Phil reject.
This all started cause of the Dr Phil show lol
What is she saying
WTF.........\nif you're going to ride Don't Ride the White Horse ü•Éü•Éü•Éü•É
She‚Äôs definitely gonna be one of those sell your soul to the devil celebrities. üòÇ
I don't like her personality but her music is goals
I just want to punch her in the face, she has that face you just want to punch
youve heard of elf on the shelf now get ready for girl with the clap trying to rap
Why tf am I bobbin my head to this. Shit lowkey flame
They changed the youtube name to bhad bhabie. So fucking cringy
Ronny J produced this song..........
Don't like her but I'm not gone hate she got some bars #betterthanmalu
So you are 14 right?
How did Dr. Phil's cum taste after his show. And how much of cut is he getting from this hoe....\nLook, now I'm a rapper
Still Better then Jake Paul.
It's like an XXXTENTACION beat
Who remembers when she was cat on victorious....time flies

OMG THE CRINGE IS REAL GUYS

Oh my god bonnie
Where did people's common sense go? Really seriously this is what some people look up to I'm not over reacting but this is just idiotic no wonder why young people these days are so unintelligent there watching these kind of videos and thinking it's ok because a big population of people like it. what happened to when this type of attitude was bad and you never wanted to end up like this but instead now days it's ok to act like this. the biggest thing I can't understand is why people would make this kid famous off of being rude and disrespectful and it's not like she got famous from being talented or productive but no instead she got famous from being a spoiled brat. Why can't other people see how wrong it is for this child to be famous from something so wrong. I hope some people can agree with what I'm saying.
Steven Spielberg is not allowed to die. \n\nSimply the most imaginative film director that has ever lived and a diverse body of work to prove it.
This is going to be the best documentary ever!
I can't wait to see this! :-)
Steven Spielberg is The King of Filmmaking : )
Thats gonna be awesome
Some of my first memories are watching movies with my folks. Born in 1980 in lower middle class rural Kentucky. Mr. Spielberg was my hero. Anything he could dream up was possible I thought. What a great time to be alive
My favourite director, my idol... he is a legend.
When I was a child he was the reason why I started to love the movies. Now, when I'm an adult, he is the reason why I chose working in the movies.
Jurassic Park\nET\nIndiana jones trilogy\nSchindlers list\nJaws\nSaving Private Ryan\nMen in Black (producer) \nBack to the future (producer)\nLand before time (producer)\nWho framed riger rabbit (producer)\nGoonies (producer)\nThis fucking genius was the voice of my entire childhood through adolescence.
Schindler's List is legit the best movie I've ever seen
No Tom Hanks ?
Somebody put this man on a bill.üíµ
It was 1993.. I was 4 years old..and the only memory I still have from that time is that glass vibrating and me asking my dad in the theater what is it?...
Wow I might get HBO just to watch this
Imo When it comes to longevity and churning out top caliber movies over a long career The only director that rivals this man is the other director in this Trailer Mr. Scorcese. Scorcese is a crazy one He quite possibly hasn't had a bad film in 50 plus years
Here's somebody who was truly born to make motion pictures.
Gotta Love Spielberg!
who's that old man?
I will watch it. \nI grew up with his movies.
John Williams music is throughout.  No need I was wrong
Cannot *recall which 'Bruce', went^ *display UK?!? \n\nHope (possiBly foreLorn)., beYond likely yadda-yadda & *Praise this may show a *vidClipüìπ of its *tour.\nWithin 3ft either mk2, mk3 ???
I like what Steven says. A lot of his films come from a part of himself he can't articulate so it shows up in his films. I can kind of relate to that.
Stephen Spielberg is my favourite director along with Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan and Antoine Fuqua.
Excited for this one!
He's such a nice guy
More, more, more, more... Mr. Spielberg you are my idol
Is Spielberg the best director of all time? Perhaps\nBut no one even comes close the the amount of classics he's made
Ferociously tugging my dick to images of the BFG right now. Thanks Spielberg.
After Jurassic park I knew I wanted to be a director
He has some so-so movies, but his work is always top notch. I can't wait to see this.
Will be my fave HBO doc! If not, top 2!
Do Tarantino next!  This looks amazing
Leo should work with Speilberg again..
This is going to be the best documentary ever.
Can't. FKN. Wait. For. This!!!!!
Before he adapts my favorite book of all time, Ready Player One, I‚Äôm definitely seeing this documentary
strangely cut trailer but i love me some spielberg so i'm watchin!
So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked. So stoked\n\nBut why does everybody on camera have a lisp? Even DiCaprio has one.
Inspiration to Filmmakers from all over the World. Institution of Film making. There is no Words for One and only Mr.Spielberg.
About fucking time they made him a documentary! üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
They got EVERYONE for this. Leo Dicaprio, Christian Bale, Daniel Craig, Tom Hanks, Blanchett, Neeson, Scorsese, JJ Abrams, Ralph Fiennes, hoffman, George Lucas, and even frickin Daniel Day Lewis
Our father, who art in cinema
The greatest film maker in film making history, hands down!
I've never seen a man who changed cinema and animation as much as this brilliant person. (sniff!)
One of the greatest directors to ever walk on earth ‚ù§Ô∏è üé•
The Greatest Movie Legend Ever Lived
This documentary is going to be amazing !
Spielberg !!!!!!!!
Filmmaking genius, he is!
Spielberg is movies.
Morons.
Genious.
Eastwood
Superb

thank you HBO!
Wow.
Goosebumps. Everywhere.
Yes!!!!!!!!!üôå
Kudos!
Firstüëåüëç
Schindler's List is, without a doubt, his best movie.
El mejor director de las √∫ltimas d√©cadas...el mas grande e inigualable Steven Spielberg..
Dont make these, start making Indiana jones 5 I can't wait til 2019 or 2020
The Master. And when the other Master JW is scoring, it's perfection.
Liam neeson's movie name..?
He raped Indiana Jones.
The greatest ever.
His films up to the 90s were amazing. Then blah. I will for sure watch this though....
God... so pretentious. He's lost his way as a storyteller. What an insufferable moron.
Fascinating. Never actually got into Spielberg's history. He's a frustrating film maker. Genius at times, mediocre at others. Ridley Scott has this problem too. But for setting the bar so damn high, he'll always be a legend.
Last generation: Steven Speilberg\nCurrent generation: Christopher Nolan
The only movie that DiCaprio was in with Steven was Catch me if you can. I did not like that one.
Check out the Directors Series Video Essay ‚Äî STEVEN SPIELBERG: POPULIST ‚Äî http://bit.ly/2jXrNEL
The first movie I ever loved was Jurassic Park. I've rewatched that movie a million times. This man is a legend of cinema.
Once upon a time his name meant something. \n\nToo bad most movies nowadays have lost their wow factor. Not even Pixar impresses anymore. \n\nAnymore, cinema is just a deluge of annual superhero movies. It stinks.
BFG? Lol
Spielberg (2017) Full movie HD\nhttp://kimechanic.com/2I1x
First
Fucking Spielberg? Even though he's a legend. He's no where near the caliber of Kubrick, Scorsese, Tarkovsky or even fucking Kurosawa. I'm sure they've had more impact on modern film more than Spielberg
Oh look another Jew
It's just a shame that Spielberg today can't create the same great films he made in the 70s, 80s and 90s.
Kubrick
Nah.... You aren't at the level of Stanley Kubrick..... Trust me :)
dirty jew
i feel like when he looks to his left he hopes to see Chester there and when he closes his eyes he imagines the time they were on stage together performing... and when Chester says what the hell are you waiting for at the end when he says its to late it breaks my heart.
muhfuckin killed it.......R.I.P chester......JAY-Z.....hats off to u...
I grew up to this album man. Thanks for the memories you gave me Chester x
Was there even a crowd ?
LIVE ...  livex ... who do they love
For a second i thought he would be trash but ig not
this was a gr8 performance i have heard from any1 in a long time....the sound doesnt tear off at all.....nice....chester was a or is a unique element of voice in this universe.....miss it deeply
Miss you Cheester, rest in peace.
never seen jay perform like this like he really gave it his all for Chester in this one.
Best of both worlds! Rest in peace Chester you are forever in our hearts, and thank you jay z this is epic. Cheers to chesters memory
About time he does something for him
I just couldn't help but breakdown in tears hearing Chester again. I miss him so much.
When he said ‚ÄúChester‚Äù as the numb verse started üò≠
I just broke down
His eyes are closed cause the lyrics are printed on his eyelids
For one last time...
Best colab ever! We really miss you Chester!!
When they do the playback with Chester's voice, I die a little inside every time :(
If I was jay Z and when I did this without chester as soon as I hear ‚ÄúGet em Jay‚Äù I would have a huge adrenaline rush and just snap the fuck off in honor of him just hearing that would make me feel like I could take on anything because it will always be there ‚ÄúGet em jay‚Äù I‚Äôm gone but get em
I really lost it when chester started singing... üò¢üò¢üò¢
This guy is the real GOAT

Great tribute, huge respect for JAY Z that he decide to this and show his respect to one of the world's greatest singers.
I think this is the realest I've seen jayz feel in my 29 years on this Earth ,  you can see and feel how alone he feels performing without chester in this song , and now it's means so much more than it did when first written
R E S P E C T‚ú®üëå
You rock Jay-Z, thank you so much for tribute to one of the greatest man and a legendary rock man on earth, Chester Bennington.\n#CHESTERFOREVER

Gong Chan and Baro was my first biases in this group, but after following them through years I have loved them all. AND BTW THIS SONG'S KEEP ROLLING!
what a good songüòç
Just posted a super appreciative comment about this video below... but let's all agree that baro's blue outfit is a huge no-no, seriously who thought that would look good??!
gonna play it through the night, love this one..
The song is dmn good!!!!
Is it really true that I am seeing ZERO DISLIKES for this MV? or I am just missing something?
I'm LOLLING in the DEAD
been there since debut and they've grown up so much I'M !!! an emotional mess :/
So I heard of B1A4 since last time but I never actually hear their song but ytd night I give it a try and hear this song DAMNNN I'm super duper in love with this song I feel like becoming a Bana now  gonna listen to all their song for surw
this really deserves an award. I'm super proud of our boys. :)
this came out of nowhere and I was so UNPREPARED OH MY GOD.\nsomeone hold me, I'm legitimately crying. this was wonderful ;;
I love B1A4‚úàüåä„ÄÄ„Ä∞Rollin„Ä∞üå± good musicüíùüíùüíù
They always have catchy songs. I love them üíï
ok but like... B1A4 are so good looking...
Its interesting, that long 'oooooh-yeah' in the middle of the song acts a lot like a guitar riff. its just used to the same effect only its with someones voice. I don't know anything about writing or composing music but I just felt that instant connection upon listening to this song. Anyone else?
Omg they are back!! I like the tune, it's very catchy! ‚ù§
Is this another masterpiece of Jinyoung? ‚ô•
I am wondering if they've ever come here and read our comments. I am just going to say, weeks later, months later, years later, bla bla bla later, I am gonna come here and keep watching this MV. :)

I used to be a bana ,but still support some comebacks ,fighting
i like Rollin' and Call Me more~~ which is your favorite song in this new album?
Which one is jinyoung?
I've been wanting to join the fandom since past few years but I keep it all in and still holding on..but this.. üòìüòìüòì gosh
another day of streaming...because i'm rolling in the deep over these lads.
Can someone explain the music video?
I stopped listening when Denis joined but I'm so ecstatic that Danny's back, AA wasn't the same after he left tbh lol
MMMMMMM WHAT THE FUCK I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW DANNY WAS BACK???? THE SONG IS SO GOOD
This song kind of has the vibe of I'll look the devil in the eyes and whisper........'Bring it motherfucker.'
Simply love this, AA is great. Glad Danny is back but Denis had a good voice as well.
There back! Fuck yes. Bring joy back I to my life you guys have been gone so long
i made a video that has aa instrumentals with bmth vocals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF3zW9Jn8bY&feature=youtu.be
They needed three or four albums to write somwhow not tootally trash music. Still got shitloads of samples without whom it would probably still be terrible. All Im saying is that this is better than their previous crap
Fuck me! Enough drunk to give my opinion about this. I've been a fan of AA for long enough. I never was a big fan of the new path that the metal comunity  got into with today's bands, but I always found something promising about AA. I felt to the fucking heart some of the songs these guys wrote. But then came up The Black and I was like Fuck me. These guys are fucking dancers but now we have Danny coming back strong and determined to try something new, something risky. Showing his ability to be a frontman. All I could say about Danny is that I wish him the best. I wish they could dance less and care about the musical proccess a little bit more.
This is the ASKING ALEXANDRIA, keep it up brothers .
Amazing I love you
I'd say a billion times better than anything on The Black but anything times 0 is still 0 so... way fucking better than anything they've done without Danny, still tops from death to destiny, which is a *very* good thing. AA is back baby!
I dig this. definitely not bad like some other metal bands that have totally revamped their sounds into garbage.
The song is good, but the video editor is fucking dumb, wtf is that fake rain it's not fuckin necessary at all !! wtf is these sharp edges !!
back in the right direction again. yesss
First time: Lol, this music is nice // Second time: Hmm, I REALLY like that // Third time: THIS MUSIC IS SO FUCKING GOOD WTF
Am I the only one who gets that type of Dennis feeling. Like it sounds something Dennis would sing.
All I have to say is... that was fucking awesome.
I still wish he would scream more...
They're back and better than ever ‚ù§
anyone ever see the house October built? danny looks like the goofy dude in that flick. lol. so weird seeing these guys grow up.
This hits home for me in so many ways. I listened to AA back when i was a teenager, 18 i think is when i first heard them. It was also around the same time i began heavily partying, doing drugs, abusing anything i could get my hands on. It led to being an alcoholic in my 20's that lasted up until about a year ago. Im 27 now and am only recently getting past addiction and being comfortable in my own skin. I wouldn't take back any of it, it taught me many lessons that few people learn and showed me a path few people see the other side of. As bad as it was it had some amazing moments. In the end i had to face myself and the wretch i had become to find the right way out. Its great to see Danny overcoming hopefully returning to AA but If he chooses to start a new path, i support it 100% Either way I will always be a fan of AA and Danny Worsnop.
So good, keen as for what's next
Once again danny hasn't let me down
Any recommends for a newcomer? I heard my favorite band Black Veil Brides are touring with them 2018 so I'll probably see them live, I know nothing of this band.
Production is a little spotty, but I dig it
Why is James wearing a shirt? I'm confused.
Obi-One  is such a good singer! who would have thought!
His country music must have not panned out
I feel the Tarantino movies influence
Oh man how I missed Danny in Asking Alexandria.. Absolutely LOVE his voice and him üòç.. AMAZING song guys ;) -love from Arizona
... This band has reverse-Metallica'd. I love it.
I like this song cause it really displays Dannys vocals well.  \n\nBut not what I was expecting at all, I was hoping for some heavier stuff like the R&R days but maybe once the rest of the album is out.
This song is really awesome,  I love it! <3
I know the guys in AA will probably never read this but this song was released on my dad's birthday. He's been gone for almost a year now and I didn't realize how much my dad and I had bonded over Asking Alexandria. I've seen them live with him 3 times over the past 6 years and each moment was better than the last. You guys helped give me memories that I will treasure forever. Thank you. Also, I'm 100% sure he would've loved this song just as much as I do.
I love the old asking Alexandria
good song, but, more volume to the next time please!, i like walk with the askin alexandria's music
I LOVE the Frank Miller's Sin City/The Spirit theme that they used for this music video. absolutely amazing
They like Coca Cola. This is the brand new metal-free AA Zero.
is it or does danny look like a blonde version of Spencer from made in Chelsea? xD
Wow okay, that's pretty good
is he officially back in asking alexandria
Why is he killing his bandmates?
INTO THE FIIIIIIIIIIRE
Omg yesss
2k people miss dennis
‚ù§‚ù§
NICE ONE
Garbage.

Let's hit 2M!!

Basically what danny did to the band when he ditched themüòÇ
Nice to have you back Danny
Can't get enough of this song ,Danny's cleans are so fuckin good
This is amazing. I'm happy Danny is finally back :)
Way to make a big fucking comeback with Danny!!!!
I wanna know what they're trying to portray in this video.. is he killing  the lads of what they used to be (the whole Denis Stoff and the black era) can you revive them in the next video? I like the rest of the band too Danny üòÇüòÇ
I'm Glad Danny's Back I Love This Song Can't Wait To Hear More Songs From AA!!!!!!!!
Yes!!! He's back!!!!!! An amazing song and video!!!!
I've known them for a long time but don't listen to their songs so not a fan. But I'm seeing them with BVB in January so I have some catching up of their music to do
Now this, this I can listen to. Welcome back.
la cancion esta buena pero lo q habeis echo con denis no es humano fuck you
Estoy feliz de que haya vuelto dany,pero yo quer√≠a que dennis siguiera.
So much poweeeeeerrrr üòçüòçüòçüòç
DANNY ‚ù§
hell yeahh!! they're back!!
meh
Shook
Top SONG !!
Amazing
Poor Ben XD
Damn. He looks like wolverine in LOGAN üòÇüòÇ
Love him it was the last part of it that caught me instantly god he's such a kick as muther fucker
2:50 fuck me man I haven't been this hard in a long time
and the style of screaming..thats what i used to know Asking Alexandria.
this video is like danny killed his own friends when he left the band and now he came back as another person and find their dead bodies. at the end it seems danny is fighting his own past asking alexandria
I love this song I can't stop listening to it I love asking Alexandria I'm glad Danny is back Denise is cool too but Danny is better LOL but yeah Danny's better AA FAMILY
Guys, this music video is so intense. The lyrics speak for them self. But let's decode the symbolism:\n\nThere are 2 versions of Danny, one dressed in white, displaying vulnerability, concern, and courage. And then there's this dark, sinister Danny, wreaking havoc on good Danny, and his Band Mates. We view Good Danny looking scared, standing over all of his Band Mates on the ground, hurt, struggling for life, but still clinging on out of strength. Then we see all the members of AA challenging dark Danny, speeding next to him, standing up to the car only to get hit, riding along side his chaos only to get destroyed. But ultimately, the only thing that can kill dark Danny, is good Danny. And he does it at the very end of the video. The neo noir film style really captures what these guys are going for I think. We know Danny left AA for a while because it just wasn't him anymore. But what if who he was at the time he left, was Dark Danny ? And his Band Mates did everything they could to help him, even though they potentially could get hurt by it... hence them getting killed in the video. I think this film showcases great camaraderie among brothers, that darkness still exists within light, inside all of us, and that's okay... And that you don't turn your back on someone, even if they are in a very dark place. I think this video lets us know that AA is back with a vengeance, and they are ready for the fire. \n\nI don't know though, just a theory.
THEYRE BACKKKK SO FUCKING AWESOMEEE
üòçüòç
This is AA rebirthed
I've listened to this song far too many times lol it's fuckin' amazing I'm so glad Danny's back
Is it me or I think Danny looks so freaking hot in this videoüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
dany worsnop back again Oh yeah i like asking again
Why is the ceramic sooooo expensive???? $1200 for a watch!!!

Yay some blond screaming about stupid phone, disliked
Love you!!!!
I purchased a couple cases already for the 8 Plus , that will show up in a week. Coming from a 6 its probably a big improvement. Although I do try to only buy clear cases with simple designs. No use going through all the trouble of picking out a certain color phone if your just going to cover it up anyway.

Does the apple watch conects to the iphone 6??
who actually likes this shit it's Apple's awful, overpriced products and here she is brainwashing everyone with her stupidity. and all her brain dead fans commenting down here gtfo
Can you review the new colors introduced? The rose red and olive green?
Justine, put one mat in one room and another in another. Ex: Mophie in your room and the other in the kitchen.
Any small youtubers wanna support each other (say 8 if subbed to me ) I will sub back :-)
Does the iPhone 8 come with the charger?
the black wireless charger sort of look like a coaster
LOL my s5 has too wireless charging and now after 3 years iphone has plus the phone is just like the same just with wireless charging and another number and big price. I just had to change my case to my s5 to have wireless charging without using my phone. Back then the first iphone was like 500$. Yep you heard it 500 and now the price is going higher and higher.
I phone operated by idiots. It is similar to buying a 2 year old samsung.
Most things on iphones we're made by Samsung and burrowed from android
I got the iPhone 8 gold the day it came out I‚Äôm so happy
Why not Iphone 10 like everyone else has?? What-are you busted out broke or something?  Guess being YouTube tool doesn't pay what we thought.
Yeah, but guess what? ¬†Your messages are green... NOT BLUE! ¬†That was great. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

It's a very big pad ... üòÇ
Justine can u at least use a pocket socket?? - Mimi Van Thanks! :D
You should giveaway some of your old apple stuffs so you will gain more subscribers...
that's not an iphone 8 plus case, its an iphone 7 plus case, on the 8 the dual cameras are vertical...
I'm a leftie but I keep my watch on my left hand and it's so dirty..
Android green messeges vs. iphone blue messeges........ this shit makes me angry.. girl you can change the fing color of the messeges on android... which you cannot do on ios... Its time to stop being so stupidly excited for apple products because they are getting less and less innovative every fking year its just plain stupid... Its time to switchhh ;)
lmfao üòÇ android phones had these for a long time already and when i saw this video, i was like LOL
Can you do a giveaway for  the iPhone 8

*It must be fantastic to be able to rake in millions of subs based off of teenagers wanting to cum on your face.*
mugs like this woman are the reason apple are making money for so little changes and innovation
Apple is brain washing every1 with that iPhone 8.  Basically a 7 with a glass back...\n\n\n\nIPhone X is okay.\n\nS8 does everything the X does, AND I STILL HAVE A HEADPHONE JACK!\n\n\nPlus in case u were wondering s8 has a higher resolution than the X\n\n\nIn fact, its a WQHD + 2960x1440 SUPER OMOLED Infinity screen.     Curved screen.  Glass back. Camera doesn't stick out....\n\n\nThe 3 things Iphone X does better is records at 4K 60f.  S8 is 4k at 30F.      But the 60f does a great difference.\n\nAnd X has 3D facial recognition, while s8 has it too but can be unlocked with a random pic of ur face.   :/    unless ur friends carry a life size pick of ur face everywhere,,,,,BUT u can turn this feature off, so ur safe...\n\n\n3rd is face emoji, but why do we need That? \n\nS8 still has Finger scan I.D\nIPhone X DOES NOT.  \n\n\nI mean ask urself this question....what r u doing on a iPhone that a s8 can't already do?\nIf u use insta, snap, YouTube, than why not get the s8???\n\ncost less and looks really really nice.
I hopped of the plane without my Nintendo switch IJustine
but guess what? Your messages are GREEN. NOT blue!\n\n\nI ugly giggled. Thank you Justine. Lol
You can flip the ui for left handed people
‚ÄúYour messages are green, not blue.‚Äù My thoughts exactly.
I think you look pretty cool with glasses. You're cool either way; just a different look.
Ughhh when we thought the iphone 6+ was new... And the iphone 7.. now im behind and people will think my phones old üì±üòÇ

You're so. Annoying with your bought ads... Pathetic.
Justine, you forgot that when you take your iPhone on a plane all you have to do is put it on airplane mode not remove the battery for everyone‚Äôs safety.
I hopped on a plane at LAX\nWith my Switch and my Cardigan.
i always confuse her for being transgender
The iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 r literally like the same thing

Hey, everyone! I'm Liam, the creator of this video. I've been working on this one for a heck of a long time. I hope you all enjoy it. Special thanks to Julian Eggebrecht, the founder of Factor 5, Inc. for letting us share footage of WeFly for the first time. If anyone has any questions about the video, please let me know.
Release the prototype iso online Factor 5, please. Thumbs up if you agree.
As a developer, these are the saddest damn things to watch
Man, what a shame. I'd have loved WeFly.
This makes me really sad. I absolutely love Pilotwings, and this looks like it could have been the best one. RIP
Damn... what a shame the game was never able to be released.
Don't understand why they didn't just make Pilotwings Wii under Nintendo's publishing and supervision.
gauntlet!!!!? Please üôè do gauntlet!!!! Like if you agree
Oh man, this would have been one heck of a Pilotwings game. I would have loved it for sure, as I already loved going into Birdman mode on the Little States Island and going to the miniature real-world locales. Getting a full global version of that was something I've always wanted. So sad that something like this never came into fruition.
That glasses thing looks COOL, It's probably be a pain to set up, though.
Were the factor 5 developers drinking beer while working, or am I seeing things?
I really hope some of the ex Factor 5 guys leak some of these projects some day.
Bummer! That sounds like it could have been a cool game. Scratching the same itch as Endless Ocean, I suppose.
Damn... That head tracking tech could've made for some good First-Person games.
We Fly's cancellation is honestly one of the more heartwrenching examples of a game being cancelled, in that it seems the developers really put their hearts into making it.
This guy has an American /English accent.
This is... so sad T_T
Interesting... And very impressive graphics.

Damn i feel for Factor 5....would have loved a new Pilotwings game the 64 one was one of the most relaxing games I've ever played
now that was a sad story
that head tracking bit was so cool. if i had the talent i'd try my hand at something similar.
Really wish this, and the completed but unreleased Rogue Squadron collection could be released someday...
Did you know? I keep pushing people away, but am really terrified of dying alone.
if they just made a Star Fox game where you fly by holding the wii mote - and fire using - you know - the buttons - it would have been the greatest game on the Wii - there was a mini game in one of those wario ware games where you did that - it was perfection
Rogue Squadron was so good. Factor 5 would have made an amazing Wii game. The name ‚ÄúWeFly‚Äù screams shovelware, but it looked VERY promising especially with the level of detail added for the time.
how...how did i not ever heard about that version of VR? that version seems MUCH more simplified and severely less costly to produce. that looked really cool.
That head tracking thing looks sweet.
Please do Half Life
If the former staff were bought by sony and asking them make their pilot wings version for the VR. \n\nIt could be possible, but its only a dream I can only say
Best game for wii sports resort
That would have been amazing! \n\nExcellent video!
5:28 Holy depth imagine one of those old star wars rebel assault games with a wiimote while on the shooting gallery part of the games and add in where you have to bob your head around to get a good angle on stormtroopers to shoot at and dodge by swaying your body hard to the sides. That would be more 3d then any 3d movie I've ever seen.
So in a sense Nintendo thrown away ther own version of face tracking 3d vr before anyone else had it great job missing that patent guys
This pisses me off. Poor Factor 5. I loved them. Imagine if they were still making games today on current platforms.
Holy fucking shit, WeFlight looked REALLY impressive, especially with the glasses and how they tried to replicate the actual weather and timezones of the real world. It legitimately makes me sad that Factor 5 got bankrupt, this seemed like it'd be a really fun game and I'd love if it got released.
üòîI wish this game existed
It's like every other game featured here had a connection to Factor 5 in someway. It's almost as if they're bad luck
Fuck, this game looks like it would've been awesome. So sad they had to close down. :(
They should leak the roms for us to emulate
Im sad that wefly/wiifly failed,it could have been awesome to fly around london or tokyo,i feel like it could have online with other people
Ah, my dream Wii game! We almost had it. Maybe it can still happen someday....
It's disappointing that this game managed to get off the ground and really take off, but, it was not capable of sticking the landing.
By then Nintendo president; Satoru Iwata\nThat line, and how casually it was said... I gotta say it punched right in the feels. I miss that dude.
This game looks awesome! It's a shame that it had to be cancelled though. :/
UGH, THIS WOULD'VE WON AWARDS!
Man, I wish Factor 5 was able to release this game
at this point with most involved companies bankrupt\nwhy not accidentally leak the unfinished game to the internet\nso others can enjoy the game that had so much love and care put into it
The game looks great and all, but those glasses would've been amazing
Such a shame that this never made it to console. It would of been an amazing and unique experience.
This video just makes me sad. I would have LOVED this game. It looks so chill and relaxing.
GOD DAMNIT! That game sounds so damn promising! I would've totally LOVED to play that!
That moment when a GOOD channel is on trending. Feels great man.
Looks so dank, wish I had this as a kid whould have been my jam.
If only Factor 5 hadn't been killed by the PS3 disaster that is Lair, we'd have had a great return of Pilotwings. -_-
I hope WeFly gets leaked one day, it looks like the proper pilot wings sequel I've been wanting.\nVery impressive looking to, sad it couldn't be released it would have been a quick purchase for me.
We need to dig the game's assets up from the Former Factor5 Management, repackage it, and make it a reality. Anyone up for the search?\n\n#WeFlyRecoveryMission
Can't wait for the day when it eventually gets leaked online
I'd love to have played it.
What a depressing story... Can't believe no publisher bailed out Factor 5, they were such a talented studio, and yet so many shitty games came out on Wii and even made money. Please make the next Unseen 64 about a crap cancelled game that didn't deserve to come out to cheer me up, or I'll be sad about this until the next Pilotwings comes out, which will probably be forever.
I feel like this is the game that would've actually gotten me to play the Wii. Then again, I would've bought this just because Factor 5's name was on it.
Wow. Looks and sounds likes a revolutionary Wii game for its time. Too bad Factor 5 went bankrupt.
Now with Pilotwings having gone on hiatus again for over half a decade (geez I'm having one of those it's really been that long? moments remembering Pilotwings Resort was a 3DS launch title back in 2011) I think now would be a nice time to revisit the series. A game like that seems like a nice fit for the Switch since you can do quick play sessions anywhere you want, and the increased power of the system compared to something like the 3DS could mean more and larger levels, and maybe even new vehicles if they can find a fun way to implement them. I guess the big question is if it'd still mainly use Miis like Resort did or if it'd go back to characters designed by the dev team like Pilotwings 64 (if it does this would be a cool way to bring back Nester given he was in PW64).
[sees headset idea]\nWow that's really dumb.\n[sees headset in use]\nWOW THAT'S AWESOME.\n\nMan, I am SO BUMMED that this was never finished. The only thing I ever did in Pilotwings 64 was explore the island and find all of its secrets while more or less ignoring the actual missions, so WeFly would have been RIGHT up my alley. And the weather channel integration was just such a cool idea!
Factor 5, forever caught in Nintendo's friend zone
Dam this sounds like it would have been good
We need this on the Switch
Xbox, a console of a larger installed base... Sorry, but... no. At the end of the generation the Xbox barely had sold just 3 million more than the GameCube, and I'm sure at time Lucas Arts were putting pressure on Factor 5, the two console had pretty much the same installed. They must have wanted the Star Wars to be ported to Xbox, but not because of a larger installed base that it clearly didn't have, but probably because the PS2 couldn't run those game without some serious downgrade and optimization. So the Xbox was their best option for a port, since it could do direct port without much work.
Fuck, wasn't Factor 5 allowed to finish a single game?
What a sad story... To think that a potentially awesome game, and pseudo VR would just disappear thanks to 2008. Those infrared glasses were freakin' genius, I still want those! If they revive this game and add the infrared glasses to the switch i will die a happy man.
I want this on Switch.
Man, that WeFly would have been fantastic!! N should have brought those people on board to complete it..
This is a *huge* pisser, to me. I know about some of Factor 5's other rejected projects, such as their original 8-player _Mega Bomberman_ demo.. but, the fact that a series of events prevented one of my _favorite_ childhood games from getting another entry just burns my hide.  It was a shame...

Ninoooooooooo

That game looks incredible

Fuckthefive?!
Liam sure does love talking about Fucktor 5
Thats sad
Huh, neat
So much potential!
Yet again fucked her 5
fuck the five
omg :'(
Next time on the Factor 5 show...
Quick, name every Unseen64 video that doesn't involve Factor 5!\n\nI'll start:
Did I hear Fuck the Five?
Unfortunate Nintendo didn't want this game to exist. I see why, but it would have been an amazing title.
Where was the part about pilotwings?
What is the music used in this video's name
Sounds like a very boring Pilotwings. I want a Nintendo 64 Pilotwings reboot made by Namco maybe ? based on Ace Combat 7 graphics Engine 800 P 40 fps would be fine
fuck now i want that game  seriously ubisoft instead of doing stupid sport games or racing why not give us a fligh arcade
Damn this looked like it could have been a killer title for the Wii to really pump some life back into it mid life cycle, however if Factor5 had used data from the Wii's weather channel it would have always been 6 hours old, and I never did get an accurate weather forecast from it the whole time it was active.
what language is the narrator speaking?
Liam, please work on your pronunciation on port. Or don't. It's kinda funny imagining xbox porn of the Rogue Squadron game
Shi-. I remember seeing that Wii Remote head tracking demo video back then! I'm so disappointed that couldn't be brought to market.
Billie just tweeted this omfg
Billie u're responsible on y im here
nut
Im proud of u malone
Billie Joe sent me here!
Holy fuck
Post is pretty diverse in his music taste, he likes everything basically, from hip hop to hardcore music like Infant Inhiliator.
I like Post, even if I don't like his music that much, he's got a nice attitude about him
I love Green Day
Lots of respect for Post, chill dude who has an appreciation for rock and metal ü§ò
Post really should feel like a rockstar because he is one
One of my favorite rappers singing my favorite band's music. Cool
So Post Malone is Green Day fan? cool
I was very skeptical upon entering into this... I actually really enjoyed this lol
THIS IS SO GOOD

Billie Joe sent me here!

Great job post malone

Billie sent me!
Greeeen dayyyyyy

Brilliant come back to Scotland pleaseeeeee
I don‚Äôt like this... it‚Äôs not good sorry... I love Green Day
Honestly, respect to him for making the Cover his own.\n\nA Cover isn't supposed to be a Carbon Copy of the original, that's what a Tribute is for.\n\nHe performed the Song in his own way, and I think he did a pretty damn good job at it.
omg this so bad. I'll stick to the Green Day Version.
Sucks

*What was your favourite of these 10 amazing goals? Let me know in the comments!*\nFollow me on *Facebook* where I post my old videos that have disappeared from YouTube! https://www.facebook.com/LilWizProductions
The Giroud goal has to win it for me.
I'm just imagining internet going full troll and the trophy going to 2:49 chick goal
Where is Emre Can's overhead?
Definitely the gk scoring double kick at the end of the game
Why there is Matic goal? Great goal but not special.
Mate, you don't know how to make a bad football video, I love the emphasis on the commentary.
boateng or the goalkeepers is the best
swear that chilliean teamis always scoring long rangers.They at high altitude or something?
Can't choose between Giroud and Mandzukic. Both streets ahead of the others.
Fucking hate commentators that just scream goal over and over load as fuck or just say it once but scream it out for ages, lazy fucking commentary, glad we don't have that shit in England, it would put me off watching football if I heard that every game.
Giroud all the way, he even started the entire chance from half way down the pitch with a good tackle. The Baroka FC's goalkeeper goal deserves it too.
A goalkeeper scoring a bicycle kick in the last minute has to win. No contest.

Wow. Last year Subri's free kick was the clear winner, but this year for me there's no obvious winner. I could see the Camargo, Boateng, Mandzukic, Giroud, or the South African goalkeeper's goal winning it. They're all amazing, although Matic's goal is a little out of place. I would guess most people are going to vote for the Mandzukic goal because of the time and place, but I'd vote for the goalkeeper just because holy frak he's a goalkeeper.
How old is Kevin Prince Boateng now? Gotta be 30.. He's still such an athlete, feels like hes been around forever.
Giroud and Masaluke.  Amazing goals this year, though.
gotta love that volleying back a goal kick from your own half
Man these girls just love FootBall \nHERE http://bit.ly/2wbJphB
Can i watch the first goal 7 times more please?? holy shit
Had to turn it off due to the shit forign commentators.
Did not know 16 year old girls could kick that far
Has to be giroud! The counter attack, the back heel in the build up, the SCORPION ü¶Ç
Jesus you didn't need to show the goals 15 times
Is this over the top shouting goal for as long as possible commentating supposed to be funny or something? Just seems incredibly obnoxious to me...glad we dont have that in the prem
For me It has to be giroud
I'm only one goal in but wow...
hurtado goal was beyond fucked what the hell
Matic
Aviles hurtadoüëç
That U19 Dortmund 27 player got dullied mate
Wtf that girl amazing stunning the goalkeeper
Dembele
celtics goal was incredible.. but fifa never usually include team goals.. E.g Arsenal vs nowrich
Amazing so much choices
How many times you gotta relay the same goal :/:/:/
Steven Gerrard has won this one for me
Boateng's is the best, but I want to see Dembele win üíö
Has to be Giroud before you even look at the other nominees, he deserves it too. Cant see him winning it though after Aaron Ramsey was robbed with his galatasaray goal. Fifa is corrupt so it probably comes down to the highest bidder!
Would help if it showed the full Dembele goal. Every player touched the ball including the goalkeeper there was at least 30 seconds of build up play missing.
Guys do you think so hit like if girouds goal was better and dislike if mkhitaryan's was better
29 replays later
I don't mean to be that guy but wtf no Emre can over head kick? Like I get they have to go for equality but in comparison the woman's goal is crap the matric goal looks ordinary like seriously wtf
It's gotta be Mandzukic, but so many wonderful goals. Thanks for the compilation!
may be you can add those two goals to the best goals of septembre : \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUfOz3XeWeo\nClub : Raja Casablanca\nthe assist of both goals : Abdelilah Hafidi \nthe striker of both goals : Mahmoud Benhalib
Oscarine Masuluke,for one reason. He is a goalkeeper.....
Either boateng or mandzukic for me
Giroud's goal is the best but Fifa will never give it to him cos the bumlick La liga.
if you change Mandzukic goal's commentary to Tony Jones...
Moussa Demb√©l√© FTW
how the fuck is there no messi goal??
That's a dislike
maticcc
Any more replays?
Why is Mkhitaryan not nominated
Reported
Stop playing each clip for like 1 30 faggot
Director: Her pay is way too much, let's just take a few shots and keep looping them.

At first I think I was getting paranoid with this music video. But boy kendall is really gorgeous and the way she lipsyncs she has another commercial like that too.. right with estee
I think this mv use boomerang aps *lol
Kendal has a fresh beauty like a peace morning.
This is so good, i wish i was Kendal Jenner
Candice swanepoel would have been perfect for this video
Too much of a boomerrang idea :S I Couldn't even finish
I get migraines and literally just got one in the first few minutes.¬† So much back and forth and flashing. ugh. I don't get it. My brain hurts
I like this video
Kendall you good  but fergie WFT IS THIS??? ü§î
I find my head swiveling around with moves, tryna take on everything, and I'm giving myself a really bad dizzying migraine
The fu*k was that ?
This video is giving me anxiety
This boomerang effect gives me a headache ü§ï
seriously so artistic and inspiring <3 I am OBSESSED !!!
I hate this video, nothing wrong with Kendall, its just that annoying editing
Since when we have to understand a music video ? Come on people ! Don't like it, don't whatch it.
It made my eyes hurt ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I GOT A HEADACHE NOW

This video is going to give me an aneurysm
Dislike only because of KendallüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'm having a fucking epileptic fit
How are you lazy at lip syncing, Kendall Jenner? They paid all this money to be in the video and you can't lip-sync but you have 80 million followers. WTF?
Love the song but I think I have epilepsy now.
Lemme just say I love this video so much. I don't even like the song but I would just listen to it so I can watch the video. I think it's so cool

When your lagging in a video game
Wtf I'm SO irritated because of this music video rn.
I am always walking around singing Axl's part in the song now. xD i sing it to my 5 year old son, my cat...myself. It is so cute and catchy!
I hate this seizure inducing/migraine triggering video so much. Love Fergie, cute song and Kendall is gorgeous but they went too far with this artsy jerky boomerang crap on this and it ruins the potential of this song for me.  I will never watch this again for the rest of my life. Make it stop!
What an annoying video.  The back and forth is not only giving me anxiety but also a headache.
jesus who tf directed this
bet u had so many ideas what she could do lol
I can't, just F CAN'T watch it. Stop doing the same thing!
I love U Kendall!!
I don't get it. sorry fergie I m not impressed üòí
THIS AMAZING SONG DID NOT DESERVE THIS HORRIBLE VISUAL
Editing this must've been hell
This music video is stupid. The ‚Äúboomerang‚Äù affect is driving me crazy!
This fucking video gave me a headache
The video so annoying. I am getting headache from it.
I really like this song. The minor key change and the French fusion make this a really fresh tune right now.
Who's here for Kenn?
I love this song but this video gives me an actual headache. I can't focus on it :(
This video is so disturbing , my eyes hurt like hell .
Maybe if we gave her a Pepsi it‚Äôll  save her dance moves.
Kendall even manages to make a music video boring
is baby axl saying the 1st part of this song CUASE PPL SAY OMG AXL IS SO CUTE wich is true <3 ) AND IM LIKE \nWHERE IS HE I DIDNT SEE HIM XD
Casted the biggest model in the world, but somehow the director still managed to mess the video up!
And this is how to get epilepsy...
If Kendall ever starts Life of Kendell it will be the perfect intro song...
forever obsessed with 1:12 üòÇüòçüòç

Always enjoy when you cook with your family ‚Ä¶Thank you Chef
Salt n Pepa. Butta Get your pans really nice and hot. Red wine chocolate souce let the knife do the work
This boy is so lucky! So nice to see them together.
Food tastes better when i watch him cook
Gordon: what about when you cook this for your girlfriend one day? \nJack: Uhh...
That beef is raw! Is that pasta frozen? Did you microwave it?!\nYou should've used lamb sauce. This plate is a mess. NINO!!!!
you can cook this for your girlfriend\n‚Äúuhhh‚Äù\n#ramsgay2025
6,16 :)))) i don't know!!! u go son :)
Mm yes touch raw meat and then touch your son's face. Contamination!
jack do it right you FUCK
Gordon Ramsey the type of man to leave his entire family for a touch of oil.
Gordon: but make sure to tell her where you got the recipe from. Don't want you to steal daddy's thunder\nClassic Gordon ^^
OH-MY-GOD! LOOKS GREAT! I do have to say, I REALLY enjoy these videos, and the ones with his children really seem to make them that much better. Oh, Jack, you just dribbled on your jumper. Great Job and Keep 'em Coming!
IT'S RAW YOU CHEEKY LITTLE TWAT
This comment section is pure gold. It's Fucking niice
1:08\n\nSo how'd you cook these at *OUR* restaurants if they take so long?\n\nJack Ramsay establishing dominance early on.
ya let's just uhhhh put raw meat on a kids face
What are the white things at 4:30 ??
Gordon: what you watching son\nSon: WWE\nGordon: is it smack down \nSon: no it‚Äôs RAW\nGordon: fuck me
Now this makes me hungry
The kid: so I put these raw beef cheeks in the pot\nGordon: ITS FUCKING RAW YOU CUNTY ASS FUCKER!!!!!1!!!111!!!!!!
father and son goals
This is my favourite video because he's teaching a kid but he's happy not shouting :)
Gordon - Youll make this for your girlfriend one day\n\n\n\n\nJack - But I'm Gay
Gordon you're killing me, your food is so gooooooooooooood
What if he says fuck me in front of the kid
His kids know so many things about cooking and im here cant make cereal
I bet Gordan pores olive oil on his pancakes in the morning
This guy looks like he has a knack with food, he should open a restaurant or be on TV or something.
Your sisters are gonna love you even more now      some incest shit going on
Videos like this make me want to become a chef.
Is salt and pepper the only seasoning in his cupboard lol
Your sisters are going to love you even more now...\nDafuq?
Luckily Gordon continues to make these wonderful videos even though a majority of the comments are people being shameless cunts towards his son.
you put olive oil in the pasta water? really gordon? :-((
Little crocodile heads¬†popping up out the water.......delicious
6:40 OMG! Everyone thinks of Chef Ramsay as such a mean person. However, that point in the video proves that he is such a loving Dad
what about when you make this for your gf one day....(son)errrm dad im gay
jack looks like he'd do well at the acting portion of porn
Pretty impressive question about the cooking time from the lad!
Fuck your wife in the kitchen
I wish my dad cooked like dis
where the fuck do i get cheeks , publix said no
Gordon is an amazing father. he loves his kids so much
How man bottles of olive oil do I need for just a little drizzle ?
I can't believe Gordon Ramsey's son doesn't know what a bay leaf is
Gordon Ramsey should make a show where he goes and tastes school lunches!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
3:40 mission failed, we'll get him next time
I like how lamb sauce is a meme and not I mm olive oil
Gordon I'll give your meat a bit of love dad
Just came here to see if people made jokes about cheeks
Gordom Ramsay on screen : *majestic and graceful* \nGordom Ramsay off screen : *munchmunchmuonrhanm* mmmmh tasty
.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................nice
Can't wait til Jack starts swearing.
He is a really great father wish i had a father like him
Me: This looks so fun and good. I want to make this myself one day.\n\nAlso me: üè† üî•
Where are the Indian cow worshippers at??? üòÇüòÇ\nYour god is being eaten by the British people...üòÇüòÇ
Gordon: I have some bad news son....you're adopted.\n\nJack: Nice
he just puts salt, pepper, and olive oil on everything...
His boy should know more about food, perhaps they dumb him down for the show.
What liquid did he add to jam???
After seeing this episode with Jack his son we can see who Gordo truly favors in the Ramsay dynasty...I've never seen him smile so much and be so loving with the girls...I mean I am sure he loves all his children without a doubt...but Jack....oh man he was grabbing cheeks all episode and laughing and smiling...unfortunately I don't think Jack likes to cook as much as Halls or Meagan so it will be interesting to see who is appointed successor to the crown here...
2:01 they're like little shit sausages floating in the sunday morning diarrhea
The fact that Jack is so young just proves how old this video actually is... just posted recently... SAD
That kid's girlfriend is gonna give him sum good pussy if he cooks that delicious shit for her.
At 4:30 camera guy drops camera for a bit
It's so cool to see Gordon teaching his kids so early. They're going to be so skilled once they're at his age.
Don't forget to lightly drizzle your tongue with olive oil before eating your food
Maybe you'll make this for your girlfriend one day? Son: mmhhh.... no.. I like penis
I swear, this guy uses up like half of the worlds olive oil supply.
Gordon: perhaps you'll cook this for your girlfriend one day\n\nJack: *Im gay...*
He puts olive oil on almost everything üòì
Did I just see you use can tomato sauce!!!! #Triggeredlol
Where's the lamb sauce?!
Beef cheeks, get the fuck out of the kitchen
I wanna eat something im starving!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Canned tomatoes...ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?
It's fucking canned tomato!!!!!!!!!
Is it just me or does this look fucking creepy? It's just giving me weird vibes.
Why does this remind me of the Grand Budapest Hotel?
Okay why is there a white woman with an afro I guess people put an afro on anything
Cant tell if this is a charming artistic movie that I should watch or one of those disturbing psychological type movie that I should stay away from.  But bill murray is in it so it's safe right? right?
Oh so they assume all dogs speak English? Smh
Absolutely loved The Fantastic Mr Fox, so excited
I'm so happy right now.
OMG THE LIGHTSKIN BLACK GIRL WITH THE AFRO LOOKS LIKE ME IM SO HAPPY IVE NEVER SEEN A PALE BLACK GIRL SHENAKMRISIEF I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just so nice :) thank you for the representation, in all of my 15 years I haven‚Äôt seen a girl like me
lol I love how Chief says Duke (0:38)
...I'm both horrified and intrigued by this...\n\n...anyone else wanna see the guy who put that order out go down? Cause I do.
I didn't know that Miss Koyabashi's dragon maid season 3 was out.
wow so you're saying a relatively mainstream movie is actually going to be good, and probably even amazing? I can die now, thank you.
AHHHHHHHHHH! I cannot wait for this!!! Fantastic Mr. Fox is my favorite movie and Wes Anderson is a genius!!!
Also known as: Dogs get revenge on the japanese because Araki Hirohiko keeps killing them in his manga.
I swear to god, if they kill off a single dog I'm going to set the ocean on fire. Yes, the ocean.
Oh, yes I am all for this!
Billy Murry is still Anderson's little play thing i see...  there are other actors mate.
Didn't realise dogs that lived in Japan only spoke English. Learn something new everyday.
I saw Yoko Ono, I'm not so sure about this guys...
The stop motion looks absolutely beautiful.
So, let's see, Japanese society expels dog who all have generic American/Western European dog names.... Interestingly stupid.
oWO WHAT'S THIS BEAUTy
I absolutely cant wait to see this! It comes out on my birthday! :D
IS THAT TROIKA I HEAR??!?!?! ~~~~~~\n\n0:36- 1:04
So the Japanese Mayor exiles all dogs, and a boy comes to the island to in his dog? Okay.
im soooooo excited for this . WES ANDERSON BRYAN CRANSTON ANS SO MANY MORE
Who else actually lives in Isle of Dogs
What Marble Wolf says.\n\nPlus, it's great to see a movie that doesn't portray Japan as some sort of utopian, morally perfect weaboo paradise.
Dog island the game movie
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
I dont know anyone who can dislike this.
It‚Äôs so weird that it‚Äôs depressing
It seems that Wes Anderson can do no wrong,
The words don't match the kanji the first character is dog, the last one is island. Just saying.
Does Yoko Ono play the trash island? Perfect casting
It's been a few years since I've actually looked forward to a movie release.   Awesome!
Gotta love how nonchalant the trailer is and how it pretty chill.
Who is the voice of the narrator? I feel like I've heard his voice before in Fallout.
reminds me of fantastic mr fox
I loved Fantastic Mr Fox, so I'm sure I'm gonna love this
I'm offended now; they have a white actor voicing a black dog. BLACK DOGS MATTER!!! Also, the human characters are white washed, KILL WHITEY!!!!!
You guys know Bryan Cranston is in this and he's playing one of the dogs and waaaaaaaaa!
Kobayashi would eat all of those dogs in under a minute.
Do they realise that they got the kanji and the meanings mixed? The character where the word 'isle' is says Dog and the character for isle is says dog.
Isle Of Dogs.....I Love Dogs....I see what he did here. Catchy.
I love this type of art style
It's like Fantastic Mr. Fox kind of...
The premise of this movie does not make sense. Quarantine dogs in a landfill? To avoid the dog flu?? Am I missing something here?? It s Wes A. movie..sign me in!ü§£üòÇüòÖü§ßü§íüò∑üò∑
I need this in my life
it looks terrible, disturbing and it's not funny. i don't like this.  There is no life in these characters. Like bad actors.
This looks terrifying to me.
This looks spectacular, I love Wes Anderson movies so much!
What a cheaply made movie
I know what there doing
I read a book kinda like this
Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of my favorite movies. Super excited to see something from this director that looks original.
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas !
„Åì„Çå„ÅØ‚Ä¶Ë¶≥„Åü„ÅÑ„Åû„Åâ„ÄÇÊòØÈùûË¶≥„Åü„ÅÑÔºÅ

Going out on a limb, but I think Chief may be spot\n\nHear me out, he has a similar facial structure, striking blue eyes, and I see little tufts of white in his fur

what the music in the trailer called
I will watch anything Wes Anderson makes.
As usual the cast is amazing. I'm missing the pastel colors tho.
OMG!! I want to watch this so badly!! This movie has everything I love: dogs, stop motion animation, japanese culture, futuristic adventures and finally, directed by Wes Anderson.
The Mr. Fantastic Fox is my favorite movie and im pretty sure those people made this. I WILL watch this.
I need to see this . I loved fantastic mr fox
I might be the only one but I don't think I'd really like to see this movie?\nIt looks alright I guess (I've never really been one for stop motion) and I do really like the concept, but... eh? No offense of course!\nIt's probably just because there are other movies coming out I'm more interested in :0
Can I watch it n ow
This is gonna be amazing god I can't wait.
Anyone know the song at 1:19
The first song is called Lieutenant Kij√©, Op. 60, IV. Troika, by Sergei Prokofiev.
LOMITOS
Im getting Okami vibes for some reason...

Omg don't understand when uber was launched they made so many cabbies bankrupt and now when they going bankrupt how they complaining so unfair hmm
Fuck black cabs they over charge and con customers that's why people use uber because they are cheaper plus tfl say that black cabs are safer but there has been more sexual assaults by Cab/taxi drivers over the years and they say black cabs are safer my arse they are just as bad as each other
The black cab cartel won. What a crap deal for the public.
The backlash against the government from Uber Riders will be overwhelming.

I'd hate to be any kind of driver in London.  Bad enough being a pedestrian.
I'm sorry Taxi Drivers this is a political decision which myself the customer not happy with and I will not be false or persuade or whatever else to use a black cab. I am angered by the way Uber has been treated - it's a useful service which I trust
Undergrounds just about to get a whole lot busier ..\nI can already barely stand in the tube without having a Chinese man breathing down my ear lobe loool..
what a load of shit, Fuck this country, I'm out. George Orwell is laughing at you all.
More than half of Uber drivers there are Muslim..no wonder
Is there another way ? \nMaybe a less greedy app to start with !
Lol it's only cause tfl are not making money from there taxis
New cab coming October 2017 ¬£56,000 not on the road, old cab was ¬£38,000 plus 4 years to do the knowledge, blame LTC, the manufacturer, their the robbers not London cabbies. Most Uber cars under 10k.
I believe many of the Uber employees are black cab drivers also
All these Uber drivers who are saying we have no jobs, just go back to your country and stop raping women
This is bullshit. Black cabs charge too much. Make black cabs charge a fair amount.
1 rape every 11 days, no valid dbs or medical checks, company pays no tax here, drivers picking up under false car insurance, good riddance
Not fit and proper means they should stay banned,
If you want a decent service you pay a decent price.  You get what you pay for.  If Uber drivers want to be a taxi driver then do it.  If they think buying a uniform is expensive then try licensing a taxi and keeping it on the rd.  There's reasons laws are in place for taxi drivers and uber is just a cowboy outfit.  I wonder how many women have been actually attacked.  I bet a whole lot more than the bullshit media lets on.   It ain't safe if anyone can be an uber driver.  Theres a lot of seriously sick twisted fucks out there that thrive off pesting over women and this company gives them the platform to do it.  Result!
This is fantastic news! Yes, Uber is comparatively cheaper and more convenient than most London cabs but the company does not carry out thorough background checks on drivers & has a lacklustre approach to dealing with criminal offenses. So, this means that you are getting on a car with someone who could potentially harm you. I myself was a victim of verbal assualt by an Uber driver who threathened/swore at me only because I pointed out that he was taking a longer route, and when I complained to Uber about this all they did was refunded my fare and dismissed the case. This needs to change. They cannot be running a business making money off us customers and at the same time putting our lives at risk like that whilst taking zero responsibility for anything. It's high time TFL took action and I'm glad that they finally did.
I asked my Uber driver what he thought about this. \nHe pulled up in an empty street and sexualy harassed me lol
Reading alot of the comments here, i find it disturbing that Londoners are prepared and willing to put their security and safety at risk for the sake of cheaper taxi fares. If a stranger in a car you've never seen before at a train station or airport was to approach you, tell you his name and age and that he would help you get home, alarm bells would be ringing in your head and thus tell the man to go away but put a taxi app on the phone and suddenly this stranger becomes OK, a person you can trust. Are Londoners truly that gullible?
Well Done Transport for London. Don't be frieghtened to stand up to big companies.
They are appalling drivers, they clog the roads, perform dangerous manoeuvres, speed everywhere. As much as it‚Äôs convenient its time the app and it‚Äôs drivers go.
Giving us more reason to not live in this shithole called UK...
Uber is a fraud, a con, a scam and tries to suck and blow at the same time.  Dump this junk.  Only the driver and no one else should profit from rides.  Ubers software can be bought for $700 and replicate anything they do. There is no magic in matching a driver with a passenger.
My dad is James farrar
Background  checks are exactly the same as all private hire and black cab drivers (ENHANCED DISCLOSURE )  and are submitted to TFL not Uber ....TFL then once everything checks out TFL issue the pco licence to the applicant like any other private hire or hackny carriage driver \n\nUber has no power over the application its all done through TFL    all the reporting has been inaccurate
Lol I didn‚Äôt know Uber was a thing in the Uk.
How will we get our drugs ??
Muslim rapists  .  I'm glad they are gone
pathetic to apologise for what uber have been doing for so long.
Latest figures show that Uber drivers are now responsible for one sex attack in London every week, with sexual assaults by Uber drivers skyrocketing by 50 per cent in just a single year.\nThis is undoubtedly connected to the fact that many of the drivers are from Muslim backgrounds, where ‚Äúimmodest‚Äù women are seen as easy prey. Many of the young women who hire Uber taxis late at night are drunk and in some cases scantily dressed.
Wait, we are the customers, why can't we do something about this? Theresa May kill TFL off now. Why do we even need this stupid agency? If there's a problem with the company, get a class action lawsuit (that is ALL you need, and some investigators - THAT'S IT), if the company is surcharging somehow or abusing its power, then do the same - prohibiting somebody is just screwing the rest of us while the black cabbies get to charge us through the roof because they don't want to actually work for their money.
Feel sorry for the diver this happened is Austin and lots lost there jobs
uber got 20 million customers and 800k drivers and staff but their petition signed by 300k .
Islamic migrant uber drives rape and assault woman.  I think we know what the real problem is.
Comunist propaganda media BBC is happy that London dropped the license for Uber, what a surprise...
Peng Ting Call Maddison Come Jump In My Addison Lee, Because you can‚Äôt take Uber
Damnit I‚Äôll be in London next month
fuck you england you pig ass country. you're bullshitting. you just want to exploit people for cash the same way uber does. black cab drivers can sexually assault as well.
Now the can work in supermarkets  they need trolley man's?
Comply or confiscate 10% of the company. Next non compliance take 30% of the company. Next non-compliance take 50% of the company and send in government representatives to work on their board. First job to sack the CEO.
Black cab nothing else ...but black cab is soul of london
Tfl just mad that they‚Äôve not making enough ¬£¬£ due to Uber being cheaper and more efficient. Just get better cabs and better rail service and you won‚Äôt be hated by the consumer...
Boo hoo. A tax dodging company with a multi-millionaire at the helm doesn't get the rub of the green for once.\nPersonally, I'd love to see them go out of business. They're basically a loan shark company. If you want to be a cab driver, apply for a licence, learn the knowledge and be a proper cab driver.
Uber had 32 allegations of sexual assault or rape, but there were 122 allegations of sexual assault and rape against black cab and other taxi companies in the UK last year. Why are they not renewing black cab's license? It's all about big money and influence. Black cab transports the Royal family staff and the owner has friends in high places. They're shutting down black cab's competitor, uber, ¬†which is unfair trading practices and goes against free market principles. Competition helps the consumer by offering them lower prices.
But islam is not a fit & proper religion
I think the tlf need to take a look in the mirror.
Got an uber ad before this vid, no one in India uses uber tho, we use our regional travelling services, and OLA, which is basically Indian UBER, but without any controversies.
Transport for london is experiencing massive losses so they basically decided to give Uber the big finger so everyone would run back to black cabs busses and trains. Really ... great work well done! üòíüòíüòíüòíüòí one more annoyed Londoner
always showing the nice part of london( central london )  when in reality looks like a dump
I agree with TFL that they should be up to a standard set. But don‚Äôt want to see uber go, as it‚Äôs the most reasonable transport on a night out
From what I have seen on video it was the Muslim drivers? Is this bias news ignoring the problem or not?
Seems like Britains self grown black Cab service was going out of busssiness cuz of Uber so they had to do suttin about it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Omg üòÇ  someone said '*how do I get around now?!! If I have to get a normal taxi I'm going throw a fit!!!*'  üòÇüòÇüòÇ    I think that was a real person  üòÇ
Black cabs > Uber\n\nOnly cheap tarts who are desperate to be raped use uber
What are the ex Rotherham taxi drivers going to do now for their pleasure.
Black cabs are overpriced. I've used one once and plan to never use one again.
Black cabs in London are WAYYYY too expensive and this smacks of a powerful lobby at work against passengers best interests.
Weirdos taxing strangers... was bound to fail.. i bet the drivers are all foreigners and rapists
Uber will stay and will win in the court! But the drivers will loose their jobs by 2020, once Uber introduces self driving cars.
London is shit anyways been twice it sucks. Better cities to visit in the UK.
if someone wants to pay another person to drive them somewhere that is their right, why does government have to get involved
Good. Protect black cabs.\n\nAnd feck the BBC - fake newsters.
Now people are going to jump into fake taxi by accident üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠
Lyft still is in London
What makes me laugh is all the comments like will have to get black cabs now who rip everybody off etc, none of the people making these comments have ever used black cabs before uber and wont after uber is gone so give it a rest, have you never heard of a minicab office? uber have only been in london a few years what do you think Londoners was doing before uber? minicab offices and black cabs were coexisting peacefully before uber arrived in it will just go back to that, another thing about 40,000 uber drivers face unemployment no they dont they will simply return back to the minicab offices and work from there. Believe it or not black cabs are actually fairly priced you would know this if you ever used them. Iv used both black cabs and minicabs and i support both, the only difference is a black cab driver is a fully qualified taxi driver and knows exactly were there going and the quickest way to get you there i got quoted ¬£15 to go to my local hospital by a minicab firm and a black cab got me there for ¬£14 at 3 in the morning. Theres many apps out there that you can download such as gett fixed taxi fares and alot more. P.S its not the end of the world.
good riddance, london taxi drivers actually have to memorize maps to get the job\nthey shouldnt have to lose their job to some neckbeard landwhale soccer mom who wants some extra cash to buy herself mcDs.
I kinda feel bad for some of the uber drivers that were in my service but I'm also glad black cab drivers are going to have more of their business back
I haven't used uber, but when sexual assault happens by drivers & they make it difficult for the government. Of course they would be banned. It's uber's fault
Get a bike! I Lived 5 years in London, never needed anything else.
I don't care London isn't even in Britain anymore
True cost of cheap price. Corporations that cut corners and do not abide by the law should be and must be punished.
good!
MadeInTyo would not be proud.
Uber drivers where dodgey
911 = war with Iran \n\n\n\n\nUBER = war with Syria ?
Good
Fuck tfl
Uber is shit. Good riddance
Well Shit

Addison Lee must be delighted
Haha FUCK UBBER
Yes hahahahahaha
Uber rapes
BBC FAKE NEWS
Good
Fake taxi?
Uber was a disgrace good riddance
Most uber drivers are poor migrants from eastern europe and middle east, it makes sense to ban Uber so locals can do traditional cab jobs for higher pay.\n\nThis also reduce the number of jobs in that sector so the migrant workers can go back to their own country.
The main reason behind the ban is the New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. British people hate Middle East people and so is the CEO. Racism at it's peak.
You couldnt pay me to go to London
fck TFL and Fck Black cabs mafia, scums and while you at it fck sadiq khan another crook
If the people over in the UK want to ride in uber taxis, they should be free to do so. If the women fear being raped by an uber driver, they will stop using their services and uber will go out of business due to lack of customers. From what I understand, there are actually less rapes and sexual assaults reported against uber drivers than there are with your black cab drivers. This shows it's all about money and power. Apparently the owner of black cab has influence with the government to shut down his competition that is offering a service at a lower price.
Surely no-one can possibly gain that much power to send 40,000 people into unemployment in such short notice!
So Uber are paying Youtube to put these stories on trending? There's 3 of them, come on. This really isn't a big deal. \nI would say it ucks for the immigrant Uber driver, cuz they will have to go back maybe but to be fair London seems a seperate community to the rest of England so maybe they can stay and just claim benefits like their wives probably do. \nLet's hope this gets sorted out, we wnt peoplpe from wherever working
I liked Uber! Cheaper, better customer service and more accessible than other services AHEM black cabs. This is unfair! I hope they win the appeal!
a step backwards for london

Ma in quale universo la spal si meritava il pareggio o addirittura la vittoria? Cio√® ragazzi, seriamente, la spal non ha fatto nulla, 2 tiri in porta 2 goal, solo perch√® il napoli gioca senza portiere, per il napoli ogni tiro subito √® un goal, ma compensa con lo strapotere in possesso palla e azioni. Con un portiere serio lo scudetto sarebbe tutto del napoli.

Ma voi napoletani come cazzo fate a tenervi ancora Reina. √à peggio di Buffon quel portiere li e ce ne vuole, Buffon con la Juve para tutto in nazionale non fa un cazzo, lo voglio vedere io quest' anno a Buffon   hai mondiali. Cmq da milanista dico Napoli buona squadra ma portiere inguardabile e che coraggio subire col sul suo palo.
La spal si meritava la partita
Nel gol di Callejon c'erano 2 giocatori in fuorigioco.Passivi,ma i loro movimenti hanno messo in confusione il portiere
Napoli merda
Il napoli non meritava la vittoria
Che culo il Napoli \nForza Juve
WOW ! I liked this <3

I have sleep paralysis almost every night. I do fall asleep on my side but I end up on my back and it happens.I don't hallucinate or I think I don't. I usually keep my eyes closed incase. But I try moving and end up getting control of my body again. It's been happening since I was 10 and I'm 15 now. It don't scare me as much but I don't like it and I wish I don't have to go through it again.
l sleep with a knife under my pillow, dark figures be damned!
When your tired and read the comments then your like I was tired before I read that\n\n\n\n\n*I want to go back in time*
OMG I'VE HAD IT BEFORE I'M TEARING UP
Your hair looks stupid and ugly
I‚Äôve had sleep paralysis it‚Äôs not good
I was gonna ask how long sleep paralysis lasts for but I realized that I could just search it up for an answer instead of waiting for 40 minutes for a response
The rain outside helped me fall asleep so much faster than usual in this video...\n\nThen I couldn't move.\n\njkjk, but for real, that candle lid is amazing
More story times please!!! Loved this!!
I used to have sleep paralysis regularly for a while...  Hearing of someone elses experiences is interesting.  I never had the visuals though.  After a while I stopped panicking whenever it happened, and would stop fighting the urge to breathe.  Sometimes I'd just fall back asleep - other times, I'd work on moving fingers, then get up to moving my hand and then my wrist and eventually my arm and try to whack myself in my face to wake up properly.  LOL!
If you think about it you‚Äôre have a bigger chance to get it
I get it all the time its no big deal you just have to try and take a deep breath and throw your self up works everytime i had it the other night where i was lucid dreaming which i can do whenever i want now which is cool but then i went to jump aand did it in real life so i did a jumping action in bed then it brought me out of the dream and i had sleep paralysis and actually i find asmr to give me lucid dreams but some night sleep paralysis so its a gamble
I‚Äôve suffered from sleep paralysis all my life. I used to also have ‚Äútorture dreams‚Äù where it would be the silliest of things like a strand of hair, or a flower pot on a houses window sill, and I would cry and scream for hours. After I had woken up I would still see it and cry for ages. My mum and dad could never calm me down unless I listened to asmr. So I really have watched asmr for years and years now. Also, I used to get out of bed, while asleep, and just point to the corner of my room and scream. Like I was possessed. Mum and dad were so worried but it went away as I grew up. The doctors say it was because of an event that was quite traumatising that I had to witness when I was a kid. I‚Äôm not as bad anymore. But asmr really helps, thank you so much Taylor <3
One time I had sleep paralysis!\nIn the dream I was with my family and we were at a park it began to thunderstorm really hard so I could barley see. This old lady came up to me and bit my arm. She pulled me into the weird truck. In the truck were a bunch of kids tied up and crying. The lady shouted SHUT UP! OR ELSE I'LL KILL YOU! I began crying. Then I woke up and looked around my room. Sitting at my desk was the lady and she bared her razor sharp teeth. She floated over to my bed and her pointy tongue flew around my room. I wanted to scream and run away but I couldn't move. I was thinking about my mom and dad and cat and dog and brother then I opened my eyes. My room was normal and I could move.\n\nIt was the freaking scariest thing that ever happened to me!\nSo thanks for comforting me!üíÜüèºüíÜüèº
follow from france ;)
Tundercats hooooo
HELLO
Taylor: R u done???? \n\n\nThunder: No
Omg, I love your makeup look
Do you sometimes watch your own videos and fall asleep to them ?
This is a video to help with your sleep ye, just tell us scary stories so we get nightmares and never sleep again :D
I've had sleep paralysis but I don't remember if I saw anything but I just couldn't move my lips were stuck I could breath I tried to scream but I couldn't I somehow started crying  and I told my dad the next day and he said it was a dream but I think it was sleep paralysis but idk
For months after Coraline the movie came out I had nightmares of the crazy button eyed people. 9 years later, I just experienced sleep paralysis, these two shadowy figures walked into my room and stopped at my bedside. I was sleeping on my back, so I could see them fine, but I was only able to recognize one of them, those same button eyes, scissors in it's hands, the other one was the same shape, dark and shadowy, a Machete in its hands, both off them slowly brought their weapons from the air, down, an inch from my arm and leg, I tried to scream but I couldn't, and then I blinked... and they were gone.
Taylor you cannot think about it before you go to bed otherwise its gonna happen to you because you thought about it
I think she has forgotten that she is a very very beautiful girl and that there is more than 1 million boys and girls watching her videos just because of that.. That is a shame. We haven't seen her since the cooking video back 1st of june. I actually miss her a lot. <3
I'm super interested in hearing your story! I had an night terror where I could see a big dark figure standing right next to me in bed. I kept screaming at it to go away and that's how I woke up. Whisper-screaming go awaaaay!!!!. Ruined my sleep for a week or so. \n\nAlso, LOL @ are you done? directed at the thunder.
i experience sleep paralysis a LOT from lack of sleep, but noting like this. Now that I've had it so much a try and shake myself AS HARD AS I CAN and it wakes me up, but i've never thought of this and it's now a fear of mine: WHAT IF  GET SLEEP PARALYSIS DURING SURGERY?!! IS THAT POSSIBLE???? plz reply
I love her hair and she gives me tickles
The more you think about it, the chances of you having it is higher. At least that‚Äôs what I heard. Not 100% sure
When I was really young (probably the first time it had ever happened) I was so terrified of everything, but instead of a scary figure I saw and angelic-type one that was comforting enough to lull me back to sleep.\nI also  experience lucid dreaming,  but because it happens so often for I kind of wish it wouldn't (at least not as much, maybe just for any bad nightmares). I'd like to see how things play out with my subconscious in control haha
Geometry as a freshman?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI‚Äôm currently a sophmore and I‚Äôm in Algebra II
WHAT IS WITH THIS GIRL AND MATCHES
It's going down I yelling thunder you better move or you will DIE
I just busted the fattest nut. (Thank You For Reading My Comment)
I know this is quite strange but I've never had sleep paralysis, and I kind of like to have it just to see what it's like then never have it again.
Plz do more of these story times xx love ya
My favorite sleep paralysis episodes involved the feeling of someone or something sitting down on the edge of the bed.
Well i guess i wont be sleeping tonight
omg you look like Lili from Tekken today
I enjoyed it very much!!!!
Did ya boyfriend , Punched ya again
Just experienced this had some weird scary dream and woke up couldn't move or anything for like 10 seconds but I didn't see anything because I was facing my wall
Got no she just described what I was doing and my house and the bathroom homework... and I have my iPad on my lap.... doing homework
I have ADHD and my mind wondered (wonder as is wondering in the woods like walking) to a few hundred years ago, if his happened, what did they think, cause they didn't know
The creepiest thing about this is that it seems to always be the same figure visiting you.
I used to lucid dream and have sleep paralysis like everyday lol. Not so much now but I have it now and then.
I had sleep paralysis too one time. I saw three figures that were whispering something in the corner of my eye (I couldn't close my eyes or move them). They moved closer to me and started pressing my chest so hard that i could not breath anymore. Then i just snapped and woke up and everything was back to normal. But i had read about sleep paralysis before it happened so i knew what was happening so i guess it made it less scary. People who have not experienced it yet, just read about it so that if it happens to you it makes it a little bit less scary.
I believe that you fall asleep easier with quiet sound because it blocks out the sound created by your head when their is an absence of sound
I experienced that many times before and my dream was sponge Bob. its not scary at all. Its not a spirit or something its just like paralyze. The only way to prevent that is to sleep side.
Taylor you should check out The Nightmare on Netflix. doc all about sleep paralysis. scary stuff.
This video always making me fall asleep and if I can't sleep at day I will definitely watch this video with my earphone and fall asleep. So would you mind to make another one? I like your voiceüòçüòç
I absolutely hate sleep paralysis. Instead of your mind playing tricks on you, your body gets in on the action.
I get it all the time. In fact I get it whenever I sleep on my back.
I had a sleep paralysis when I was 7 and I saw a big black cloud near my bathroom door I also had a two story house and I had a Jack and Jill bathroom I shared it with my uncle and my two brothers I hate sleep paralysis it scares me
The first time I had that I tried to square up with it..................I lost
Wtf you got when you have tingles at the title
loved the knock sounds on the video! it almost seems like there's someone on my window...
I suffer from sleep paralysis a for long time. It is truly scary experience. A savior tip is NOT sleep with your head looking at the roof. Sleep right or left. For me it worked hope to you also!
Could you imagine someone had sleep üò¥ paralysis and really had to use the bathroom üöΩ
The lucid dream happend to me i was in my bed and i couldent move i tried to but then bunch of bugs came out of my tv and started eating me
I kinda get this but instead, I get trapped in my dreams.\nI‚Äôm like telling myself to wake up and stuff but I‚Äôm just completely frozen
Sleeping on your back is a common cause of sleep apnea since it can cause your airway to close. Sleep apnea causes you to have less oxygen going to your brain and can cause nightmares and possibly sleep paralysis. Check to see if you are snoring at night which is related to sleep apnea also.
Maybe not a good topic before going to bed
* ive watched the entire thing woo! * ive had sleep paralysis and nothing happened i didnt see anything odd, i had pain in my neck and it was due to the fact i was sleeping on my back and i never do that but i did see a small black figure above me and i tried moving but my neck stopped me bc of the pain... never sleeping on my back again...
You should make this a series, if that wasn't your intention anyway.
This used to happen to me all the time. The best thing that worked for me was holding my breath untill my body would wake up. Anyone who goes through this should try this.
it was hard for me to sleep last night because I kept thinking about this LMAO can you believe it
I'm watching this in the morning and I just about fell asleep.I have school.
Sleep paralysis and the hallucinations that come with it have become a weekly occurrence for me on my sleep in days when I don't have work or school. A trick I have developed when I wake up and can't move is to never open my eyes upon realization. Instead, I concentrate on wiggling my toes rapidly, and try to imagine the same rapid movement through my legs and up into my body. Wiggling my toes while imagining myself convulsing. It's weird and It's a very uncomfortable process but is worth not witnessing the terror I have experienced during waking hallucinations. After enough concentrated toe wiggling I eventually wake up able to move and see without blotches or dreamlike figures in my room. I got this idea from a forum I read close to 10 years ago and it has mostly worked ever since. I am not kidding.Toe wiggling for future reference! lol
I've had this like 3 times when I was really sick but I never saw a black cloudy figure
Please more story time ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
Did anyone who had that kind of experience and has been able to move tried touching that figure? I wonder what that would feel like..
I just realized that, if I'm not wrong, asmrtists get some of the highest pay on YouTube,  watchtime is what gets you more money right, well tons of people watch this stuff for hours (myself included) and alms all the videos on his channel I've seen have at least a million views so wow, keep it upüòä
She looks like the blonde girl from house party

You're so beautiful and full of life.
Yay I'm going to the royal Melbourne show today cause it's pass midnight I have trouble sleeping but u always help
Why are there Spanish auto generated subtitles though
I have only experienced it once and it was when I was quite young... when I was 6 or 7 I had it... i felt like I was being restrained from everything, speaking, moving, looking at things... I was trying to scream for help but nothing came out... as a 6 or 7 year old this scarred me and I was scared to go to sleep for months after... when I finally snapped out of it my dad came running in and I said I couldn‚Äôt move... at that point I could but I still thought that I couldn‚Äôt and he thought I was imagining it lmao... this is meaningling but I guess its good to vent lmao
Go kill yourself

Strongest glass ever?
The most heart touching video I've ever saw!
Man apple really needs to stop charging so much for this phones . Again build it better . Note 8 is crazy strong . I have iPhone and iPad and I hope Apple watches this video . Thanks bro for the video . Keep it up.. üëçüòéüí™
Who really drops their phone that much
I got the same Tech21 Case on my iPhone 8 Plus üòÖ
here comes the flame war based on an extreme test that nobody would go through in real life
surprised the samsung didn't explode
Bloody hall. My s8 got dropped from almost 4 feet and it left a small mark on one corner and after a few days it was spider webbing all over. I never had comfort using the galaxy. I don‚Äôt know how people compare android with iPhone. Just because they can‚Äôt afford
If your only purchasing one of these expensive azz phones to prove they‚Äôll break. Obviously u don‚Äôt need a cell phone. Maybe get cans with strings. Idiots.
the √Ø dont need a phone casestarter pack
My Tech 21 case tanned itself. It was white then turned Brown
Iphone after steve jobs is going to the worst unfortunately
this is why I love xiaomi phones, high end specs, decent build quality for a quarter of the price of flagship phones... they're so cheap, if you break one, you just buy another... you can literally buy 8 xiaomi note 4x phones for the same price as an iphone 8
To all apple fans and apple users go to hell. Galaxy Note 8 wins  no matter what new phone apple makes its always the same and shitty
This is why i left apple for samsung a few years back, and so glad i did. Love my S8+
I knew the winner before the video started. Andriod > Apple
Tysm for being sponsored ! I was literally just looking for an iPhone 8 case
Why u break both üò¶, give me note 8 üòÇ
Stupid IPhone they believe they have best product they r trash I got the note 8 is amazing
the winner is nokia 3310
Buying the note 8 next week
I subbed cause his videos are cool and cause this guy needs money üí∞
ŸÉÿ∞ÿßÿ® Ÿáÿßÿ∞Ÿâ ÿßŸäŸÅŸÜ Ÿß
Phim dai ngoc nhi truong ky
wow...
why .????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
again and again ...Iphone sucks!
Note8> entire iPhone line
It hurts watching!

The evo cases are great. However, they tend to change color.
Notice how the Samsung users never have proper grammar, spelling, or punctuation. They are uneducated. People are saying note 8 is best even though they are probably too cheap to afford an iPhone. They can't prove anything for themselves. If you get an iPhone, you won't be disappointed. Those who never have had iPhones think that it is terrible. But when you actually get to own one, you won't want that boring android cancer ever again.
Are you fucking kidding me, I dropped my S8 WITH A SPIGEN CASE from LITERALLY 2 feet and it cracked the bottom right and right middle of the screen. Fucking joke.
Ok this video seriously hurt my heartüíîlol
I got the tech 21 case vest choice i ever made its tru my s7 still perfect condition
My Motorola gorilla glass will destroy both expensive phones üòÄ
so many people are salty about the iPhone. It's their choice whether they prefer the iPhone or the Samsung...zzz
Strongest glass ever --> Doesn't last as long as a phone that's not even known for it's durability.\nPremium materials (Sapphire) --> Only as scratch-resistant as Gorilla Glass 5, but nowhere near other devices using sapphire, while costing 3-4 times the price they cost.\n\nThose aren't just strong statements, they're staight up lies.
This makes me sad...next phone  they need to work on ONLY durability.  Id like to see apple focus on that aspect of designing the next new thing.  With everything it‚Äôs capable of you would think making it all covered in GLASS...they would ensure it‚Äôs completely unbreakable.  A real bummer...
I think this is not iPhone 8 this is iPhone 7s
if u want to sell the mobile plzz contact me
Why the fuck are there so many Indians typing grammatically incorrect sentences about the iPhone being bad.
iPhone lost it's not the most durable glass it's actually really weak only Samsung is better! Love the Samsung! :D
one of a kind
Helo Sir!You waste large number of phone I want to get free iPhone 6s gift from youthank you for get me a giftif you want to contact me than sent me a mail on following Gmail\nta135897@gmail.com
This seems pretty biased towards the iPhone tbh. When the iPhone survives like the Samsung they are like wow that's amazing
Battery drainage and camera comparisons, please. However, other channels had already done them and the results don't seem alright for iPhone.
Strongest glass on a phone ever my ass @Phill Schiller! Not only apple disappointed 2017. They started lying about the products. Well done.
Subscribe and Like and I will 100% sub back
Iphone users should know that samsung uses gorilla glass which is way stronger than the glass iphone is using. Which is why most of the time the most fucked up screens are iphone users lol
OMG HOW CAN NOTE 8 SURVIVES 10 DEOPS can't believe it's a glass amazing work by Samsung hardware team hats off to them I ve seen previous drop test test of other Samsung phones it is the hardest to crack the screen. I don't wanna speak about apple being a trusted company its cheating the customers.apple don't use the word most durable in your dictionary. A good drop test
This makes me so sad like I drop my 7Plus all the time if it wasn‚Äôt for the case I‚Äôd probably wouldn‚Äôt have a phone.... I go through glass screen protectors so much but I don‚Äôt like the plastic ones look. Will definitely be getting a case when I get this or the X.
Fu‚Ç¨k \ni think it is iphone 7\n$|-|¬°T
Rather than destroying them provide them to the need ones
Once, the dumbass‚Äôs son will ask him ‚ÄúWhat were you doing daddy when you were about 25‚Äù...he will respond ‚ÄúI was breaking phones‚Äù What a dumbass
Bullshit lies from Apple, yet AGAIN.  \nWHY do people buy their overpriced garbage?
i have an idea juste care of your phone and everythings become okay and this video become useless
And this is why I'm never an iPhone owner
Am I the only one getting tired of technology?
Apple team where you at?
Send me both, I'll repair both üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'm sorry but everybody's a loser the moment the glass breaks well there goes a $1000 The only winner I see is the company that gets to charge you to fix your phone
Samsung galaxy note 8 amazing and iphone 8 not good
The phone's glass is not durable
GG SAMSUNG

SS NOTE8 VERYGOOD FOR ME
What's probleme bro
Drop S8 Active
Hello from Japan
Come after iPhone 8 drop test
kind of safety issue if the shards of glass from iphone hit your eyes from the impact?
See this guys, a perfect example of iphone, they hype of their phones and say it's the most durable, and use the most expensive glass and a load of bullshit. But when it gets put to the test against a samsung in the same conditions, it loses. This is why Galaxy is a far superior phone.
Most strongest my ass
Apple is Chinese made what do you expect
Apple thought then have the ‚Äústrongest glass ever‚Äùbut Samsung actually has a stronger glass
strongest glass huh...
My screen cracked on the side with a $50 screen protector
There the same screens
Thank you Michael boy.
This is the most Michael Cera thing Michael Cera has ever Michael Cera'd before
Michael Cera doesn't look like himself.
This shit is fire. Fuck every negative comment. Like we didnt know Cera had the heat tucked in.
Hey it's Jimmy's brother, the singer!
i found this tremendously pleasant
this makes me question everything.
It's like the musical version of Michael Cera and Wes Anderson masturbating in a room together while blank staring into each other's eyes. You know, basically hipster porn
This is a really really really nice way to stark the week :)
That was adorable good job MC
Jesus Christ he‚Äôs perfect
this is white as fuck
Napoleon Dynamight the music video.
WHERE IS HE. WHERE'S MY BOY.
fuck this song is actually so good like wtf
Cera is back yesss
I fucking love Michael Cera
Go Bleeker!
This is what hipsters look like in 2017
i was not expecting to genuinely enjoy this as much as i did
Who the fuck is Michael Cera???
Legit adorable. Had to share with my boyfriend. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
It‚Äôs jus to dam positive for me to enjoy but I can‚Äôt even hate it cuz that‚Äôs me issue
Tanks boi u make my day :D
ive been waiting for michael to make new music for so long!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
I was here in the 500th view rsrs
This is amazing
36 people are douchebags
How the fuck did Michael Cera have an indie pop song in him? This is wild. Song is 7/10 | Very pleased.
This is my favorite dong currently. Can I put it in an indie film I made?
Representation of exploitation? I don't know but this sounds like an ok Washed Out or one of many other indie artists i've long forgotten about. Two thumbs negative neutral.
He's Jimmys brother!.. the guy with the beautiful voice! Sing for us!
Sharon's the fucking greatest btw
Does anyone know the name of the font? Im like obsessed with it!
If he change his name to something and do some plastic surgery on his face so no one could know that It was made by him, I'll love it
This shit is hot af. Mexican gang here, tambien hago m√∫sica si buscan escucharla en mi canal :) .Saludos

This is incredible, so wholesome!!

DJ CERA!!!
Omfg
esto es saber aser musica que gran cancion
for 4 minutes and 39 seconds of my life, i did not want to die. thanks mikey cera
Im so confused. Is this like Michael Cera Michael Cera or a different Michael Cera?
Michael Cera sure is a man of many talents!
This is art
turrible
Using disabled people as a cute factor. Not really into it. Kind of ablest. Disability is a lot more than just cute.
WHAT SONG IS THIS GUYS?????
When i seen Michael Cera i was excited because i actually thought I'd hear some vocals but now i see its more like when you see DJ Khaled on something except,i don't wanna hear those vocals.
Pitchfork usually sucks aids out of cocks but thumbs up on this one!  this song is so legit\n\nthe video was sorta disgusting though.. disabled people are gross. Still thumbs up!

Easily the best president in my lifetime. Mind you not hard with Clinton, Bush and Obama so far.
This is the same guy who disrespected his daughter on National Television\nif she wasn't my daughter I'll probably date her and that's ok ? ....\n\nsame guy who disrespected women  \nflat chested are hard to be a 10 or you have to treat them like shit  \n\nsame guy who mocked a disabled man and that's ok? ....
Trump will go down as 1 of the worst according to my opinion üòÄüòÄ, worse than obama honestly
Another one of Trumps pathological lies to take the distraction off of what he is done with the corruption of the United States of America!\n\nMore and more have joined American football player Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs protest movement against police brutality, a move that has come to be something of direct resistance to Donald Trump after the President weighed in on the issue.
What the hell is wrong with this man child. Shit feels like a bad SNL sketch.
TRUMP #1
MAGA!
These players use their position in society to champion a cause. when asked why protesting? for unity...unity hmmm care to explain....nah we protesting unity. this same player for the others days of the week outside of the few hours the cameras are on him playing will do nothing for unity. he will not contact local politicians or outreach programs unless its a sanctioned team function. he will not fight day in and day out when the spotlight is not on him for the unity and justice he so call desires. all it is now is uneducated buzz words. you might as well start protesting that murder or say rape is bad. the same message you are bringing to the table which is that of a child. things we all know in the world to be wrong. want to make a real protest? stop playing the game. give money back. buy a buisness or two in the town that was so hard to grow up. change it from the inside out. but kneeling against a flag which you know nothing of why it means so much to others seems half assed and you are taking outrage as progress. both sides are just as bad
Donald take your pieces of silver and just go.
trump brought out honesty in  beta whites ppl of color who now openly despise white culture.  ur fucking diseased in the mind and u can drown in ur damn hatred
Trump is the GOAT
What a patriot! God bless you Mr President
Damn everybody be hating on Trump. I'm a #Trumpsupporter , deal with it.
#MAGA liberals are the epitome of hypocrisy.
Respect for the players.
*FAKE NEWS FACTCHECK:* Trump didn't say NFL team owners _should_ fire players in this video - he merely stated a rhetorical wouldn't you love to see what-if scenario!\nTrump: Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'Get that son of a bitch off of the field right now - out! He's fired - HE'S FIRED!'\nCNN's video description: President Donald Trump criticized some in the NFL... _saying_ _team_ _owners_ _should_ _fire_ _players_ _for_ _taking_ _a_ _knee_ _during_ _the_ _national_ _anthem_ \nSeems like CNN just can't stop lying about what Trump says! The description talks about this as if he was making official policy recommendations for the NFL owners, when all he's doing is speaking in an off-the-cuff manner directly to his base! Jeez!
FINALLY a President with COMMON SENSE!
Bro their is so much other shit going on, and here we are talking about a fucking flag
What do you know about respect ????????
I wish US presidents respected Freedom of Speech.
Love all the libtards bitching, ever since you lost all political power thats all your good for,Trump 2020!
And the worst part of it all is this protest has NOTHING to do with disrespecting the flag. The protest is about drawing attention to the huge amount of unarmed black people killed by police and those same police not facing any consequences for their actions. People have been tricked into thinking it's about disrespecting the flag and are too stupid to realize it.
If all these folks don't like the protest why not do something to address the reason why they're protesting? Then they will stop. Common sense. Instead of saying I am going to put an end to police butality like a good leader. But instead Trump and his supporters would rather force them to stand. Welcome to America. The self proclaimed greatest country in the world.
How many kids watched this, y'all talk about respect for the flag so much but the president doesn't even respect professionalism. If Obama said this he'd been portrayed as incompetent
America is the laughing stock of the world, and it's much deserved.
Trump should focus more on leading the country \nThen on dumb shits that don't stand for the flag
Nobody understands Donald Trump's personality like I do he is this kind of person he talks too much and trying to be funny and trying to devise people he likes attention once he goes home he feels totally empty so he has to do it on daily basis to feel good otherwise he's feeling empty 24/7
Pretty sure people wished donald respected American flag also...
Thanks trump for standing up for our country even if i am not a big fan of yours !!!!  This is so disrespectful when the NFL and players stand for this evil !!! i want to see these whining spoiled brats go to another country and make millions. o yes no other country pays for spoiled brats to play a game. people don't get it. we will not have any freedom if we have no  country anymore. where is people's brains go hello !!! If we keep going down this path we are going be broke!!!!
From all the reasoning Americans to the world: We apologize for the nonsense and ignorance of this man, we in the true mayority do not want this guy. Many Trump voters wish they had listened to Bernie üòÇ,  we are working in getting rid of this chump.üïúüí∏üëäüí¢ and to get america back up from the stations of education, employment, and health sectors it is sadly in.
This dude has no room to talk about sports at all, what he needs to worry about is how much time he will have left in the office if he keeps this bullshit up because I already want this asshole out of office right now, I mean who is he to say that NFL players need to be fired for taking a knee during the national anthem I mean its freedom of speech. This guy is a fucking disgrace to this country and deserves to be fired as president. #FUCKTRUMP
IN A DEMOCRACY PROTESTING IS A BASIC CIVIL RIGHT.. HOWEVER, THE PROTEST SHOULD NOT VIOLATE THE DIGNITY OR THE RIGHTS OF OTHER PEOPLE... THE BLACK NFL PLAYERS ARE TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT A WRONG BY DOING ANOTHER...DISRESPECTING THE  FLAG OF YOUR GREAT NATION IS PERVERSION.....I THINK THESE GUYS JUST JEOPARDIZED THEIR ORIGINAL AGENDA.......
Freedom to kneel, freedom for their employers to fire them for it, freedom to boycott the NFL. Period
you know what? GO TRUMP
Beware Alabama voters Trump may have had to do a deal with the devil. Check Bannon on fox news. Mitch McConnell endorses Strange and given millions to get him in.
he said the flag, but not the soil rich with the blood of patriots?
I wipe my ass with the flag everyday. Thats all its good for now that trump destroyed the country.
Chad W , lmfao xbox is not serving our country üòÇ
Fuck that ugly ass Donald trump trying to make life great for white people bitch
We live on a speck of blue in an ocean of darkness - Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner.\n\nHow frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.  Well said Carl Sagan!
Well said! It's completely disrespectful to do that to our anthem
Stupid Americans.......\nRetard nation.....\nPower to Black people....\nFrom Croatia with love.... üòÇüòÇüëç
yall.... you're president is wining over some people excising their right to free speech while we're on the brink of war with N. Korea and a whole ass territory of ours is literally without power and destroyed. Trump is literally a damn joke. His ass was never fit for this job if he can't focus on the real issues surrounding this country.
I'm a vet and have and would risk my life so that people have the right to free speech.  This isn't free speech, it's misdirected and an insult.  Trump is just saying what 3/4 of Americans feel, that this is an inappropriate way to protest and that it's disrespectful to veterans and America as a whole (in his own offensive way).  Arrogant elites don't care and will tell you if you should be upset.  Next they will burn the flag at a game and claim that we shouldn't be upset.  I don't need the NFL or any other sport that has such disrespect.
They're being disrespectful to the flag you cunts. It stands for America. Literally, you're just letting the flag and America down. Leave the country.
I would like to apologize to our President for telling him to stfu. My emotions got a the best of me. Even though I don't agree with him but he's still our President.
ü§îü§îHe missed a great opportunity to try to turn some rich Black guys Republican.üò∂üò∂üò∂ I wonder what would happen if a couple hundred of HIS employees decide to take the knee?
Wow i cant believe people are still on this. Its been going on for years now. Can we as a people just admit americans in general struggle with doing the humane thing and move on?\n\nIts not like that country or its people really care. If they did trump wouldve been removed from office long ago. No instead we do this cherry picking dance where one side goes oh the other is so bad. While the other side does the same. Both sides will find ways to fuck everyone over and americans and america will go right back to being racist at the end of the day. \nJust look up US's history. A disastrous nation that committed to letting the jews die right up till they joined the war  during the world war. And again with its confederate war, placing war-criminal statues in areas that used to sell slaves as a constant stinging reminder for slavery. And again with trying to repeal and replace the aca, 3 attempts to throw hundreds of people with life threatening illnesses off of life saving healthcare (affecting men, women, children, infants, the elderly and the severely sick) for money \n\nThese are just really bad people who pretend like theyre nice but honestly couldnt give two shits about anyones life or death as long as they get money. \n\nAfter a while of that shit you realize, naw its not the american politics thats messed up, its the people! They simply care more about money than any person living or dying - thats why in a democractic nation you get people like hillary and trump running. \nEnough excuses: americans are racist assholes. See there! Now no matter how bad their politics get its just becomes: oh yeah thats to be expected just look at the people.
Says the guy who fled the draft üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ.
Trump is a stupid old fucking airhead as dumb as dog shit !
I try to follow politics as little as possible, but wow this is so embarrassing.
Proper Flag Etiquette\nNever Dip the flag for anyone or anything\nNever place the flag horizontal\nNever let the flag touch the ground\nNever wear the flag as clothing\nNever cover the flag\nNever use the flag to cover anything\nNever lay the flag flat or carry anything on it\nNever use the flag as decorations\nNever tie up or fold back the flag, always let it fly free
I have to be honest. Yeah. I would love if an owner did that.
Why can't blacks get it through their thick skull that whites today aren't responsible for their damn slave ancestors 2-300 years ago and if they don't like this country's history then maybe they should go back to where their ancestors originated from. Everything has to revolve around blacks these days like wtf. America would also be less racist if people who don't support it go back to their home country.
Great speech. We in Germany forgot what is national pride.
Funny, isn't it that when nazis and klans men take to the streets carrying torches, traitorous flags and guns, it's Free Speech.. But if NFL players simply TAKE A KNEE, now that's where the Trumpettes draw the line. That's high treason. Assholes.
Your just a smug son of a bitch always talking out your ass.i can't believe this is the actual president
This man doesn‚Äôt like black or white but he does LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è Money üí∞
He doesn't respect the world ...and he wants respect for a flaggy'', here we go, all the WASP wanna be parroting on
That's a total disrespect... YOU KNOW WHAT IS DISRESPECTFUL CALLING SOMEONE A SON OF A B*TCH  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE THEIR F*CKING POINT OF VIEW BECAUSE YOU'RE SO CAUGHT UP IN YOUR SELF!
Sports is sports, politics is politics, etc. Alot of people don't know that NFL is a patriotic sport, its not a sport that just came out. NFL has always been an American family sport. People barbeque, have parties, relatives together from great distances. Its like the first thanksgiving for the year for diehard Americans. Now you go shit on the flag then you indirectly will cause a shift in the tides. Now live with it and brace for impact from the backlash. You want to protest go on the streets Don't be lazy.
I'm waiting for the day Donald Trump gets fired
crazy country with crazy president u representing a big threat to this world
God Bless the Dallas Cowboys and owner Jerry Jones for showing Trump that we are The United States of America, this is NOT Trumpamerica. Amen guys! That was awesome!
The US must be warned that Trump is a populist. He's not different to Chaves or Castro. He uses people's simbols to take advantage for himself. He uses 'Divide and rule' and wants to create a crack between the people of the United States calling everyone who isn't at his side a traitor. If this trend continues he will turn the US into a third world country.
Punish them Mr President. Time to sanction these wayward owners.
Oh look what you've done now, dotard! Just added fuel to the fire! Oh not to mention, for all you Trump supporters, when North Korea launches a Nuke over here and people are dying, this Stupid Son of Bitch will be in a bunker while America Citizens are dying. Make America Great Again! Yeah Fucking Right, let's start a 3rd World War because our POTUS doesn't know how to shit the fu#@ up and talk to people other than his own base.
It didnt take him that long to talk about this and for some reason it took longer for him to say neo-nazis and white supremacist are bad people
Trump is a racist...a filthy lowlife with an orange face clown hair small hands and no intellect....in addition to being a born liar and a Putin buttboy....a traitor.
Glad to have a president who is brutally honest
Why the fuck are these football players getting all political for! Stupid fool get off your knees and show some respect
You have to respect the flag or lose your job..... coughfeeling like nazi America
Trump is the best and most realistic president that this country has ever had. ¬†:)

Smashbox is literally my life. Randomly came across it at Sephora. I like to have them try new things on me, things that I just never think to try cause im a scaredy cat and stick to the norm and honestly I looooove it. The applicator is amazing. I have very even lips and very proportioned 'M' on my upper lip so some applicators are horrible for me cause im not a pro (but i still wear them because, lets be honest, who wouldnt?)  Smashbox is amazing. Btw I have BabeAlert. So pretty.
I like how his hair and eyebrows kinda look like the shade expensive from his palatte beauty killer
I love that blue on you!

*what a beautiful song ‚ù§
This is so good! Only thing I would change is, instead of abruptly ending the song, do like a 15 second fade out with the beat still going. Song is amazing though, Kygo never disappoints!
Well isn¬¥t that a voice worth of a goddess! On point Sasha.
I love Kygo so much. Every type of song made sounds beautiful
Someone make a chillstep remix of this song! Btw, this song is perfect if you turn the speed up to 1,25 :)

Watch Vsauce 3 Video here ‚Äì Do it now!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d9i_0Ty7Cg  : )
Ehh. what ever. ill just live my life simulation or not.
I don‚Äôt understand anything üôÅ
I love the The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy reference   :D
Please, a video that explains if humans will ever be able to travel through wormholes? What science says about it.
Just discovered your channel and its amazing. Subscribed. Keep up the good worküòä
Matrix or Rick and Morty simulation?
dude you smoke too much pot...kinda a Matrix senerio, right?
If this theory was correct they would delete us
but computers glitch all the time so at some point the computer would have to crash and fail. What would happen then?
What if we are akin to an AI that‚Äôs about to become conscious on the scale close to the consciousness of those superbeings ?
We're running Rick's car/spaceship's battery contained in a micro-verse cube.
I love you Kurzgesagt, but saying no one knows what consciousness is is bull (that we can't reconstruct it yet is something else). Every (not-philosophical-zombie) human probably 'knows' what it is. And it's quite well defined by people like Chalmers (1995) for example.
If you die it is for you Game Over or it continue?
wew it looks like plato's question when aristoteles got interest to become his disciple.
this just ruined my life
That`s exactly what I thought ,holly ,I`m not crazy ,then xD
this topic remembered me  islam concept about world
What this video forgets to touch on is the fact that if live is in fact a simulation, the real world doesn't need to have physics or limits, the possibilities are endless.
You are great Kurzgesagt!! Keep it up
All these people with weak-ass minds are having existential a bunch of existential crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've never had a crisis because I always knew how insignificant humans were but hey, I make the best of what I got.
Hey Kurzgesagt! This is what I call quality youtube content. Keep up the good work to your team and strive for more.\nJust wondering, how do you make your videos?
Why is that post human THICC AF though?
What if we are this post human being that invented those simulations but it has not happened yet but will happen in the future when we are more advanced. This would also explain why there are no other livings in our universe but very likeky in other universes.
This is my existential crisisüòÇ
But what if we don‚Äôt have to simulate everyone? What if we‚Äôre all alone? What if everyone else is AI? What if we‚Äôre AI? :(
PLOT TWIST: We are humans in the popular game for Sims The Humans and The Sims series is a series dedicated to the people controlling us: which are Sims.
What if tripping over the power able is what causes deja vu? The simulation rolling back to a save point causing us to re-live a past experience, but sometimes in a slightly different way because of a changed variable?
Essentially we're all atoms collected together in a certain arrangement, and upon our death we will decompose into another arrangement of atoms (dirt). Which means our consciousness- our ability to self-identify is all because of an arrangement of atoms. Therefore, logically, if another arrangement of atoms were to be created somewhere else in the universe, then you would experience that life.\nAnd, if the theory of a cyclical universe is true, when you die, you wake up and experience a new life based on the organization of atoms of the people around you an infinite amount of times.
If someone trips over the cable we will get to run ourselves
Jake is still traveling to different realities
Oh great, it's The Matrix ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!
Wait... does it really matter HOW we are being simulated? A mathematical model will always work out the same way (or part of a set of ways if we're throwing in randomness) regardless of how many times it is performed, so a simulation is kind of just an interface with that model. So IF our universe can be simulated, then it should be encapsulated in a set of rules and we would be artifacts of those rules - not any particular instance of them.
So we are in a game Playing a Game Controlled By A Gamer That is in a Game?
I've been thinking about this for quite some time man
WHY DID I WATCH THIS BEFORE BED NOW IM NEVER GOING TO SLEEP
Even if we r being stimulated we r doing it ur way so don't care
I'm too high for this.
Really dislike including that guy Chris in the video...
What if civilizations could use simulations to better educate themselves? Such as if we created simulations of our current society, the outcome of each simulation could illustrate what makes a good society or what destroys society. Potentially it could provide different better technology without consequences, it's a stretch but I feel like it's a logical motive
Or we don't see aliens because we're in a simulation. Lol
That what I always thought as a kid
Maybe a life form isn't even needed to simulate our universe let alone advanced technology because whatever created us could have completely different laws of everything that doesn't require technology or life forms to create simulation. Even then, whatever is responsible for our simulation could also be in a simulation from something else. The plot thickens. Although I think this whole simulation thing is bullshit and I couldn't really care if we are in one or not anyway.
Just casually watching this and having my solipsism confirmed yet again. Am I gonna do anything about it though? Nope, too many video games to play.
These birds have been murdered too many times , they better be simulations ...
Okay...put the pipe down now.
when are you going to make a new video
Actually there is no render problem if we are in a simulation. Our time does not have to be equal to the time of the simulating world. If it takes a billion years to render our whole universe for 1 second, for us still 1 second would have passed either way so render time is not a problem...if time exists at all on the other end of the simulation.
what is the 2D animation program you use, as the end result is very fluid and high quality
You don't need to simulate every entity at every point in time. Most people can be described by statistics, there are very few singularities which make the actual difference. Just a superficial simulation is enough to make someone seem to be human if that person is able to articulate a coherent sentence.
I love how this channel will almost always wrap up the video with my exact thoughts going into it. :)\nTopics like this may be interesting and entertaining, but ultimately hold little value, even if we were given a straight answer. Fact is, this is our universe, simulated or not. We decide what to do in it, just as we always have, regardless of some higher purpose.\n\n6/5\nIf God exists, we are most certainly in a simulated universe.\n\nCheers!
Might... Possibility... why the hell would anyone want to dwell on this? Since you're doing videos on things that can't be proven so why not just make an episode on god or unicorns? This channel is to based on what if to collab with Vsauce.
Imma start moving my fingers so much so i can overload the computer lol
This art style though. Beautiful!!
i bet trump is a simulation
Example of being in an artificially encoded simulation would be dreaming. It's not just whether this sort of thing is possible or not, it's already proven to be.
I suggest that you try a podcast. I think it would be really interesting.
Don't make other human come into your videos please. It ruins it.
Well - if this is true - then programmer is god and atheists are wrong? In that case - I'm rather agnostic.
Where does disease fit into this?
Can you do a vidio on how heavy elements like gold formed in a super nova
If this is a simulation they set Ego to the max, just to see what happens. That would explain all the shit going on in the world.
One may not need to simulate consciousness per say, but perhaps, if we are in a simulation, our thoughts are projections of those running the simulation.
What about bugs and such?
Are you from germany?
there is no need for that kind of processing power. maybe the conscious reader of this comment is the only simulated permanently existing consciousness and other people/perceived conciousnesses are created whenever the reader perceives/attempts to perceive them?
Im too high to be here.
PLS NEVER CHANGE UR ART STYLE IT IS AMAZING!
What is most scary is that we can never know, we could become the absolute masters of our universe and hold limitless power, but we might still be a school project in a shoebox of some advanced enought alien!\n\nAlso, even if something pokes throught the fabric of reality and says, -hi there! you are in a simulation! It might still be that it is simply a powerfull enought creature that have mastered interdimensional and what else there is of all physics, and they just had to mess with us reality bound lifeforms for giggles.
You guys play too much video games, read too much books and watch too much TV... or that's what they want us to think and do!!!!?? Oh God....
Well Rick, You've been inside a simulation, INSIDE A SIMULATION.
Veeeeery interesting.... Well, if we are in one, I have to say it's a very good one  x')
aah. my daily dose of existential crisis. funny but I used to worry about this when I was a kid.
What if we have to sleep only to reduce the average load of the computer running the simulation?
Rick and Morty always reminds me of Kurzgesagt. Or the other way around.
The Simulation Argument is pretty nice with the concept of infinite realities with every possibility possible.
What if the 'creators' simply made the simulation because they can. There's evidence of humans doing the same
I came from Vsauce3. I had never heard of this Kurzgesagt-thing before, but it looks interesting and I subscribed.
Knock Knock, Neo.

Complete nonsense.
There should've been more Stanley
It's so weird, it wasn't until I saw this movie that I truly understood the real meaning & purpose of good horror movies in general. IT 's message was that one should 'face your fears' and in doing so there's nothing to be afraid of that can harm you.\n\n\n\n(Spoilers, because Pennywise cannot kill those who are not afraid of him in any form.) I think this movie was so well done and had a good share of thrills and suspense, but I truly liked the message at the end. I don't think I'll ever see a horror movie and actually be legitimately scared again because of this movie's great moral and how well it was executed.
this movie was SO good...IS so good

Is the actor that played Pennywise like still stuck in character or is he just like that? He creeps me out yet he's kinda hot lol
The pennywise actor is cute
1 Million views after 22 hours?! JUST WOW!!!
I live really near a city called Derry in Northern Ireland and this scares the shit out of me
Tim Curry is Tim Curry dressed as a creepy clown.\n\nBill Skarsg√•rd is Pennywise.
Pennywise w/o makeup looks hot no homo
Wheres all the full interviews and behind the scenes of this video?
BILL SKARSG√ÖRD IS HOT
THIS MOVIE WAS SCARY. IDC shit was scary af
The movie was awesome
I would love to see pennywise as a villain in a Batman movie. Like if you agree
I can't take this new Pennywise seriously, he reminds me too much of the Queen of hearts from Alice in wonderland 2010 and Chuckie from Child's play.
Wind blew me away. Blew the whole circus away
I have to say, having watched this movie, I didn't find it scary at all. I did, however, find if madly entertaining and Pennywise is spot on!
At 2:21 you will see why bill Skarsgard was chosen to play Pennywise.
I seriously can't wait to watch this!!!!!!!üéà
I think the originial Pennywise was creepier because he felt more like a regular clown and evil clown whereas this one is just an evil clown.
I‚Äôm a kid fuck you IT
This movie made me laugh more than it did scare me but still loved it
Its gotta feel good hearing that from Stephen King himself
I really enjoyed the movie when I saw it Friday. I was super happy with how it turned out.
I've watched this movie twice now, and this video makes me want to see it again. I have chills. I love this movie SO much.
I saw this film in theaters. Very dramatic  &  gory  in places. Great story of friendships & coming of age.
Please Warner Bros, you can add the option of Add Subtitles? PLEASE!!
Wasn‚Äôt as scary as I thought it‚Äôd be but the movies atmosphere was phenomenal
They did this movie so right! üëåGrowing up loving the book, and the made for tv movie. I never thought it would live up to my expectations. They nailed it!
The animation of pennywise when he would run at the camera...so cringe worthy..like a weird animated pokemon attack...that and how goofy all the CGI aspects of him were...eh.
I felt this movie was as good as the first half of the original. It wasn't better, it wasn't worse. And people always say BUT BUT BUT THE ORIGINAL IS CHEESIE and so? what's wrong with that.
The movie was frikkin' amazing :)
When the featurette makes you want to see the movie more than the actual trailer did.
Bill ten√≠a una sonrisa y cuando dijo espero que les haya gustado la pel√≠cula se puso serio,esa  cara es la de Pennywise xD

The clown trend died last year.
*YOU'LL FLOAT TO*
1:09 awesome
Warner Bros, with FNAF better make it animated. Otherwise it's probably going to look childish and cringe. The story won't even matter.
It looks like the mouse of Chuck e cheese mouse lol it's so creative I love the clown acts and the movie!
Cant wait to see this movie!!!!!! Im so excited!!!!!üòç
won't do you any good to run. Girly boy
Fear is our most primal, of emotions-;#JoeDavola
5 days.... still 5 fucking days.... thank you Germany
Pennywise only needs to tell me Oppa(s) is down here. And I'll go down that suer, no need for long questions.
Here before the million
What is the music in the beginning
Oh well.. I-I'm Mr. Bob Gray or P-pennywise t-he D-dancing C-clown hehe. Georgie, meet Pennywise. Pennywise, meet Georgie. Now we're not strangers anymore, right? \n\nHaha! I guess so! I should get going now.\n\n\nOh without your boat?\n\n\n*instant death* \n\n*we all float down here*
Let's be real here people. The creepiest part of the movie was Bev's dad.
I think one of the reasons this movie wasn't scary enough was because the kids are never REALLY scared. In the projector scene where they first saw Pennywise together, as soon as they open the garage door they are all like Phew! that was kinda scary and they're all having a conversation like they just saw a scary movie. Any kid (specially any kid in the 80's) would have been shaking and traumatized but they get over it so easily so why would anyone as an audience be more scared than the characters?
2:21 So.. I do hope the fans will feel the same way. THAT STAAARE! THAT FAAACE!
1:22 what scene is that???
Stephan Kong‚Äôs opinion on It and Pennywise is the only opinion to consider
Bill was amazing but That fucking painting tho...
Chin down - eyes up, and looks more brutal.
Was expecting it to be cheesy cause movies this year suck bad (I work at a movie theater) This has to be the best horror/thriller movie I have seen in years! üëè
hlo guys i m down here and I'm flooooaaaaaaatiiiiiiiiing
that lip thing gives me the uncomfortable feels
Watching this trailer at 4:30 in the freaking morning is a humongous mistake. Holy shit that's scary!
Anyone caught the reference of the turtle (Lego turtle and when they saw the turtle in the lake)? That's pennywise greatest enemy according to Stephen King
Who else had red baloons tied to drains in their area?
Bill if u come with me you'll fuck too
This movie was fucking stupid. They tried waaaay to hard to make it seem scary but really IT was just corny and too much like every horror movie out there these days.
Why not get someone good to play pennywise cause from what I've seen sneeze guard does a pretty bland, not remotely close to being nightmare fuel. I mean why try doing things that stopped scaring the vast majority of kids and try to play it off as scary? You should have tried your best to get good old Captain Spaulding to play pennywise which would have added a much much much darker aspect to him.
0:47when you go to shit
Now, for all the awesome  success Warner Bros. goes up on the TOP
I would like to see this motherfucker go toe to toe with my boy Spawn instead molesting bunch of nerd kids. He would get fucked sideways.
wow the guy who is talking is so hot
I hate horror movies and I loathe clowns but I loved this movie. It went right up to one of my favorites ever.
Bev is hot
I hope in the next movie about it, so that when the kids are adults and go back to Derry to stop it, hopefully some die (not to be heartless or anything) that pennywise develops new skills or powers that make him stronger, or a other clown could step in and help pennywise kill the fully grown kids. Idk I think it would be interesting. And make it more scary.
It
Penis wise is funny.
Here lol
Bill Skarsg√•rd was a fantastic Pennywise!
Je \nSus \nChrist
To really be honest this movie sucked so bad üëé that I just laughed while watching it then losers say this is better than the original Kill yourself for even thinking the classic it will always be the best because it was way more scary and the cast tim curry played the best It The new one is so Corny to me üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Just watched it today and my favourite scene was easily the final fight
I think I'm cosplaying as Georgie for comicon. Should I do it?
This movie is not scary. For the love of Christ, can everyone please stop saying this movie is scary. Almost every scary scene in this shitty film is Pennywise running and screaming at the camera like an absolute fucking retard. The only, and I mean the only fucking redeeming quality about the film were the kids and even saying that is a stretch. I saw the film the first night of the release and there was a group of teenage girls sitting close to me who were laughing. Fucking laughing. Not being scared. Not going, oh know! But fucking laughing. So can everyone take a xanax and just chill the fuck out. If you were scared by this film you're either a moronic idiot or a 2 year old. Good day.

I'm happy they didn't  ask me to help play the role as a kid. Because I would beat the life out of the poor actor who played penny wise.
I gave the new version a chance and found it very very boring. almost all scenes with pennywise and the kid's fear visions were presented like riding a cheap ghost train and a plastic skeleton appears next to you: oh, so terryfing. this element is also shown in other details like that old house they enter, it is so fucking unoriginal and totally horror-clich√©. \nif it was just a movie about friendship it actually has some potential. but the whole pennywise thing sucked. he has no personality, except for one or two moments when you can actually see more of his character than just jump scare crab but those moments hardly occur.
‚ÄúAuthentic reactions my ass don‚Äôt be talking to clowns under sewers‚Äù
Never seen the movie but,the first makes me realize how dumb the kids are
Wat a fucken let down this film sucked
Now you are just milking the views. Cmon.
Idk why is he called*Penny-Wise*

1:10  I swear the way he rises his head it's enough to give me the chills! But at the same time, aesthetically it looks so good!
Hey you should do an evangelion theory! Maybe something on the plausibility of Evangelions
Only issue is the number of times lust has died previously... as well as how many souls she might've used to live up to that point... and possibly the unknown energy consumption of her claws... but those are incalculable so I guess it's the best that you can get.
No one knows how many times list was killed before there for all your math is garbage...
Come now, the value of a soul is pretty much outright stated in the show; it's worth one arm.
It's also been a long time since we talking about Dr who.  A theory we actually want
2:22\nThe Seven Deadly Sins logo pops up. Is there going to be a theory about this?\n\nBut I really want a theory about Mystic Messenger in Game Theory... Please?
MatPat's talking to me about E=mc^2... A formula I'm using on the chemistry homework I should be doing instead of watching this video... Well then.
Mr. MatPat. I was wondering if you could do a theory on League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003). I can't think up of a theory at the moment, but if anyone can make a theory ¬†use science and math - It's you. If not, then I understand. Have a nice day.
Read the One Piece manga, much faster and not full of filler.
2009!!? Wow do I feel old... on the up side this whole theory helped me with an idea for a fantasy/ sci-fi book I'm working on XD
Everyone else is talking about lust dying or using alchemy. I notice your mistake with Dunbar's Number. Dunbar is talking about 'steady relationships'. Hoenheim merely said he learned all of their names, not became besties
Talk  Code Geass because you should.
The Seven deadly sins is my favorite anime. Please do a theory on it! I didn't know if you knew what it was
Do a theory on the flash!!!
Uh I'm not even done the animae and I know that Lin as greed was imortal to also not saying this as hateful but WHY is there no do the who part three what is the reason? Are you too busy playing Mario and beating it or taking a chip and eating it why? Please excuse me if that was hateful I know you have a rough life
Your theory is wrong. You're wrong around Lust's facts. Basically your whole theory is wrong. So I want the time I wasted watching this back please.
do a theory on the last jedi
nice one mattpat!!! brotherhood is my shit, good legit watch it over and over again and never be bored, already watch about 7 times.
You are assuming that none of the energy in the stone was used before. While I have never seen this show, I find that really hard to believe she was just created. How long ago did she get the stone? What things did she do with it before she died? Sorry dude but your assumptions are to big on this one.
I don't know if you would, but a HunterXHunter theory would be amazing.
I'm sorry MatPat but I couldn't concentrate on your theorizing because the music around 11:29 was so distracting ü§£
Chip the black boy | am I weird? Explained
Are people able to comment suggestions for the series? Because it would be so amazing if you could do a episode in uncovering Stan/Ford Pines actual age from Gravity Falls.
Please do more like this
We don't know if lust has ever regenerated before so the math might be wrong. But ur channel still awesome!
cause physics
yayay
Mmmmmmm souls (soul eater reference)
Spoiler alerts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelim never died
I'm mad
Do a BNHA theory!
Reaper Reaper Reaper Reaper Reaper Reaper
do a theory on Fairy Tail PLS PLS PLS PLS PLS
12:49 Takes suicide bombing to the next level.
what about the energy she uses before that battle
Anime theory, make it a thing
the souls looks a bit like man tears
Do a theory on fairy tail ppppplllllleeeeeeaaaaassssseeeee
Please do a theory on the Naruto run
OMG HE CALLED MANGA COMICS!!!!!! WHERE IS YOUR DIGNITY BRO????
It is impossible to create a theory out of nothing didn't stop you from making the 'ness is sans' theory...
Here's the thing...immortal as can't die(by age) but they can be killed than there is invincible as in can't be killed by physical damaged
Actually, there are only 8 immortal shown in the series, because King Bradley isn't immortal at all he's just a host for the wrath of the father and he even ages, seeing how he used to be a normal man before his transformation into a fuhrer, so yeah small mistake there.\n\n\n\nP.S I love how matpat is still good enough in his Film Theorist but kinda disappoint on how he's still kinda bad in his Game Theory . So imo it's okay matpat take your time to upload video once a month for GT but make it good and backed up by research like you used to do or like what you're actually doing right now in FT.
I lost my shit when i saw Alucard...FUCKING GIVE ME MY DAMN HELLSING THEORY
yall saw they xx_pro_reaps_xx
Quick manga rant: You called FMA a comic instead of a manga. Quick Naruto rant: You pronounced Naruto the incorrect/weird way. Religion rant: You got the wrong virtues. The virtues (and their opposing sins) are chastity (lust), temperance (gluttony), charity (greed), humility (pride), diligence (sloth), kindness (envy), and patience (wrath). I found the website that you got the virtues from which I'm pretty sure is wrong. I'm pretty sure they have a different set of virtues, or combined things from the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (fortitude & prudence), fruits of the Holy Spirit (faith and hope which is basically the same as faith), and/or the four cardinal virtues (fortitude, justice, temperance, and prudence). Sorry for the major religion rant, but great theory.
Do a theory on Gotham
They're not since they're human desires being envied can either be used for good or evil saying its counterpart is like saying tomato vs tomato the exact same fucking thing they're the seven human desires you can either use them for good or bad it's up to you most some people use them for good some people use them for bad if you use them for good you can protect your family you can get a good job you can acquire cool things you'll keep a ton of stuff you'll horde a lot of money you'll be smart with everything you'll take your time with everything you love your wife you love your family you love life and you'll take it all slow at all the same time if you use it evil then you'll steal your kill you'll commit acts of horrible atrocities so it's how you use the sword also on top of that a soul would actually fused together over time because if it's an energy and entity it would be natural that an entity would be like that of water it would mixed with the entity inside the vessel thus there would be no segregated Souls on top of that there is no immortality if it's based off of energy because well just makes sense further more
Do a theory on the movie It please I would love to hear you come up with something for it.
Try to theorize on double king!
I wanna see a Steven Universe Theory! ‚ù§
YES A FMA THEMED THEORY
2:22 I got so excited when I saw that Seven Deadly Sins title lol I am trash
Sooo Matpats entire motive for this video is, how many human lives must I take to live long enough to watch one piece....
not even gonna watch this one (no hate just not an fma fan) just stopped by to answer that question for you. \nthe answer is my soul is worthless.
Yu-Gi-Oh! Darkside of Dimensions... please... cause... WTF happened to Kaiba? D: HOW? WHY?! THE PHARAOH! YUGIOH IN GENERAL. SOMEONE. TELL ME. SHTUFFS!
Does anyone else want a Steven Universe theory?
please make an anime theory
Matpat, have you seen through The Door? You knew everything!  LOL!
He triggered me when he said Hiroshima
*sees video title*\nHa, you couldn't even make a pebble with mine, that's just how worthless I am xD
Can you do a theory on IT?
Just for clarification, Dwarf didn't fuel everyone's alchemy. He could block it by disrupting the connection to the tectonic energy Amestran alchemy relied on.
Very interesting but my dear Matpat you forgot some information, while my maths are completely terrible, I can remember little details of the anime and manga (not related to maths). Father obtained more and more philosopher stone, and they mention that because he was looking for the everlasting energy of the gods. Hughes died because he discovered how many wars were fabricated in the entire story of the anime so Father has much more energy that Hohenheim, I know that you use the hard data given but regardless, I just wanted to point out that maybe you miss more energy, that's why Father was more bad ass that Hohenheim.... but pretty interesting theory as always...
GRRR IM MAD AT THIS VIDEO! WHY? Idk no reason.
so what is the worth of the human soul? i mean we figured out how powerful they were but never got a solid number on the price.
What is the worth of a human soul?\n\nOne wish, if you become a magical girl.
Running with their hands back like that is to prevent the hidden weapons from flying everywhere not for speed
Umm your wrong lust is heavier than she seem
season 4 is coming soon
This is good, but there are a few holes I think would need to be addressed:\n1. We have no idea how much energy she's already used to regen her body before the series starts.\n2. We have no idea how much energy is costs to sustain immortality i.e. how much energy per minute is used from the philosopher's stone. (Though, I believe we could probably get length of time they have lived data. We still don't know rate of depletion.) We're also not sure how much alchemy she uses on a constant basis to form change as much as Lust does. Her rate of decrease may be more rapid. It is never quantified how much energy is required for each of the homunculi' respective powers.\n3. The theory is based on the premise that all homunculi are created equal suggesting that Father has all vices in equal portions; however, some homunculi seem to be by and large much stronger than others. \n4. There is a possibility they've explored ways to recharge their stones since hidden labs studying immortality and soul manipulation are a main feature of the series. We're not sure if any of the homunculi have attempted to recharge. (this point is more negligible).
Should do one on the science, and possibility, of the Wuxi Finger Hold from the Kung-Fu Panda Trilogy.
This episode is complete bs, dosen't count for soo much shit. This episode what basic and only slapping numbers. His work is getting more and more sloppy.
FINISH THE DOCTOR WHO VIDEOS!
You should do a theory on my hero academia (an anime) maybe do something about how strong deku is\n\nKeep up the good work
*How much is my soul worth?* - Nothing
The Film Theorist you should do how far did forest gump run. Like if you agree.
Do souleater
DO ITTT üéàüéàüéàüéàüéà
I want code geass DAMMIT! (or dangenrompa)
Yes! More Full Metal Alchemist!
Hayrowshimaah lol
do samurai x theory
11:40 he said weight *Triggered*
no more anime unless its a good one like sword art online\n\n\nholy crap calm down I know sword art online is crap it was a joke
It sounds like you say olchemist.
do how strong is one punsh man
But you are assuming she has not used anymore before that point aren't you? That is a pretty big missing variable. We don't know about all of lusts life do we?
1. The way you calculated the amount of souls in one of the humunkoli was just genius\n2. Just between the two of us, wouldn¬¥t your theory imply that Lust never used her stone bevor (and we see her using it for exemple to create her nails/claws), so if she just once created a block ten times her weight out of bordem this would already double the engery per soul: Therefore ->\n3. I think the best would have been to try to analyze the energy used by every humunkuli, take the biggest and then continue saying it has to be ATLEAST this amount\nStill awesome theory, bro!
So, were the stones left completely inert after the homunculi were killed? I haven't actually seen the show(yet) so it's a serious question. Because if the philosopher stones were still usable after their deaths, then the amount of energy you figured out was the maximum output of the stones in a given time, rather than the entire reserve if energy within them^_^ really good video, btw!^_^
NOT NARUDO ITS NARUTO WITH A T
I'm affraid MatPat has no clue what E=mc¬≤ means whatsoever. Also, if the stone would contain the energy to regenerate half her body 9 times, the stone would also at least weigh that much initially before energy was used to regenerate (if you would go along that you could actually turn mass into energy instead of it meaning that energy adds to mass). How does a 1,73m 63kg homunculus carry a 283kg stone? Also creating mass (or rather matter in this case) requires more energy than just the energy content of the mass. This theory is just fubar.\n\nEdit: http://www.astro.puc.cl/~rparra/tools/PAPERS/e_mc2.pdf
No such thing as a soul though.
My soul is worth moneyyyyyyy'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:49 just being ash
DUDE! YOU GATTA DO A THEORY OF DARKIPLIER AND ANTISEPTICEYE!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLAESE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maybe a Tokyo Ghoul theory sometime...
that Nobbel cameo tho
2.000 people took anime too seriusly
Does that mean if father or their dad died that energy would be released and destroy everything in sight lol?
Bowie would love this... Electronic, ambient and rock. Just what he wanted to do in 'Heroes'. They just did that in 21century's way.
A great song played for a great band. I love this.
This was a nice surprise for my daughter during the concert, she's a huge Bowie fan.
a legendary song performed by a legendary band
sooo sooo sweet.....Its a pleasure hear this version by Gahan....congratulations wonderful Dave, you are the best.  Love you , from Canada :)
–°over version of the David Bowie - Heroes song.
this IS good.  Pardon my tentativeness...it might just be downright great....
There was just a man who can sing that song after Bowie's death: Dave Gahan.
Love DM, but this cover blows
motorhead version is much better
I can't stop listening to this song!
A fantastic cover. Musically and vocally - a twenty-year old, or even a thirty-year old Dave Gahan, could probably not deliver a vocal this nuanced and controlled. And wonderful guitar work from Martin. Rather than copy the original, they've put their undeniable stamp on it.
Can you add it to Spotify?
I swear to Jeebuz Dave is channeling Ian Curtis for this rendition!
See you soon at Amsterdam ! :D
This cover created depeche mode almost 40 years ago, for the first time we hear it
Brutal
DM = Perfectness!
WTF !!!üò£üò≠üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†
I love DM from Czech Republic!
They have been singing it live on the Global Spirit Tour. Amazing to hear. :')
It's different i surpose but you can't the original
üëçüëç For this üòÄ David will be very proud ‚ò∫
I even didn't  see Istanbul/Ankara/Izmir  concerts in the upcoming concertlist. Other cities even will be good. PLS organize this. Otherwise, i am going to  abroad to watch those guys as a Turkish   Devotee.
can't stop listening. So good
a group of legends making a good tribute to another legend. Loved this video.
In one word.... WOW!!
Everything started with this song ‚ù§
NO PARECIERA DM BUT IT SOUNDS BEAUTIFULL, Thanks DM, its wonderfull cover
his voice is fantastic a lot of singers seem to lose it a bit as they get older but at 55 he sounds as good as he did 30 years ago -after a few listens though i think this is a decent cover but - not very exciting? like someone else commented it kinda reminds me of u2 haha
IüíóDM from Croatia
David gahan and David Bowie, are genius singer
Se√±oras y se√±ores  conozcan el potencial de la voz de dave , se despacho con  toda en esta camcion  , que tremenda voz tenes dave sos un  mostro.
What more can I say but beautiful, David looking down smiling...CatzMeow
Classic song done by the masters depeche,excellent vocals,mr Bowie will most definitely approve
Love the band but they don't do very good covers
as  good.. as perfect ... as the original ! David Bowie is proud
Sorry I don't like it
What can I say just about the best cover version ever totally amazing DM
3:43 We can beat them, foreverrr and everrrrrrrrrrrr I'm crying now.
God, I love DM too much. Sublime <3
THIS IS DEVINE! AMAZING, TRUE ROMANCE
This is the best version of this song, and of course it had to be by Depeche Mode! Absolutely amazing and brilliant!. Gracias DM!

When I have your music all your music think about my past of my summer cause all of it was right there all the time, I wish I was back to see happens again and young again who I believe in love in be infinite be funny be me all day but it's from you I didn't know but I judge by your book cover, and I should just try but good thing is happy now and everyone but not always good luck cause suiciding... I wish it stops and go back in the past but every of your music calm me down for no reason but I like it.
And I ain't  worry bout the wrinkles 'round smile. that was something I had to smile About...this song is such a movement. This song made me realize what I have right now...‚ù§Ô∏èüôå
amazing!!! thank you for this
Ah the good old days whem mackamoore wasn't big in the music industry.
I just dedicated this song to my 50th birthday!!
Super fan of Macklemore üíñ I love you.
I thought i subscribed to Ryan Lewis, i guess this guy took over..
Its not party. Its not chill. Its nothing :/ ..dissappointed
How do I dress like Kesha? She dresses herself amazingly.
What a perfect time to drop this amazing, beautifully crafted.. Nostalgic Track. #ThoseGoodOlDays
Wish we could turn back time\nTo the *good old days*\nwhen our mama sang us to sleep...
Lyrics\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nSome day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\nSomeday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of these good old days\nI was thinking about the band\nI was thinking about the fans\nWe were underground\nLoaded merch in that 12-passenger van\nIn a small club in Minnesota\nAnd the snow outside of 1st Ave\nI just wanted my name in a star\nNow look at where we at\nStill growing up, still growing up\nI'd be laying in my bed and dream about what I'd become\nCouldn't wait to get older, couldn't wait to be someone\nNow that I'm here, wishing I was still young\nThose good old days\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nThat some day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\n'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of the good old days\nWish I didn't think I had the answers\nWish I didn't drink all of that glass first\nWish I made it to homecoming\nGot up the courage to ask her\nWish I would've gotten out of my shell\nWish I put the bottle back on that shelf\nWish I wouldn't have worry about what other people thought\nAnd felt comfortable in myself\nRooftop open and the stars above\nMoment frozen, sneaking out, and falling in love\nMe, you and that futon, we'd just begun\nOn the grass, dreaming, figuring out who I was\nThose good old days\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nThat some day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\n'Cause someday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of the good old days\nNever thought we'd get old, maybe we're still young\nMay we always look back and think it was better than it was\nMaybe these are the moments\nMaybe I've been missing what it's about\nBeen scared of the future, thinking about the past\nWhile missing out on now\nWe've come so far, I guess I'm proud\nAnd I ain't worried about the wrinkles around my smile\nI've got some scars, I've been around\nI've thrown some pain, I've seen some things, but I'm here now\nThose good old days\nYou don't know, what you've got\nTill it goes, till it's gone\nYou don't know, what you've got\nTill it goes, till it's gone\nI wish somebody would have told me that\nSome day, these will be the good old days\nAll the love you won't forget\nAnd all these reckless nights you won't regret\nSomeday soon, your whole life's gonna change\nYou'll miss the magic of these good old days\nSongwriters: Kesha Rose Sebert / Benjamin Hammond Haggerty\nGood Old Days lyrics ¬© Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.
MY FAVORITE TWO PEOPLE IN THE SAME SONG AND VIDEO!?
Where's my Minnesotians at!! Lol
I just love this guy <3 remembering the good old days:)
IM NOT TEARING UP OR ANYTHING
The chorus reminds me of The Office when Andy wishes there was a way to know when you're leaving the good old days
OK, so how is this Not at 1M Likes yet? Love you Mr. Macküòò
Obsessed with this song ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can't explain how emotional this song makes me.
Macklemore please make a song about our political wreck in America!
I swear they said something weird from 2:54 to 2:58
perfect collab, dont think anyone will top this
Who's watching before it becomes famous?
So this is who we are getting at the NRL grand final.
Wow, I love this song.
Look like Macklemore and Calvin Harris are competing for best collab album!
THIS makes me cry because It's telling you to live young as much as you canüòôüôÇ
I KINDA SHIP THEM BUT IDK I THINK HES MARRIED
Do they like each other?
I used to joke about Kesha not being able to sing- But i had to google who sang her part because I was so impressed. She sounds so different - but amazing job!!!
Who knew the singer of Thrift Shop would turn out to be so influential and amazing! I love Macklemore. And Ke$ha's new music is beautiful! LOVING IT!
Andy Bernard got his wish, someone finally wrote a song about that.
Guys now I can see Macklemore and Kesha as an adorable couple
OMG, It's amazing song. I LOVE YOUR SONGSüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Now I high-key want to see a couple as cute as Mackemore and Kesha were in this video. :3
Love this song tho gott share it
Yahhhh finally a new favorite song  üòçüòçüòçüòç
Kesha has a set of pipes on her, she nailed it, that's how good music should sound. Awesome.
this is like my 8th time watching it!!! <3
This video deserves much more views
Congratulations!!!!!! Great music video & song...thank you so much üí´üí´üíû

The chemistry between these two tho.. üíéüíéüíéüíé
Can't say how long I was waiting for this Colab!
Kesha had such a glow up!
Freakin' love this song! My two favorite weirdos in one song!!! And it's so true about the good ol' days.
Please make more music together.
00:53 that reminded me of Crazy Kids
who knew kesha could sing..??...this was beautiful in every way
Not bad not bad at allü§î
Nice song, but the video throws me off as Kesha's passionate voice doesn't match her demeanor when lip singing in the video.
Omg this song it's so fucking beautiful, deserve more succes because it's better than every song on billboard hot 10 right now
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
This song is so fuc**ng relatable. I listen to this every morning. It gives me hope and courage to go through the day. Thanks Macklemore and Kesha
Oh look , you can make good music without being naked or bragging about how great you are....who knew?!
I love that he‚Äôs writing a lot of songs that people can relate too. Not that his other songs aren‚Äôt good they‚Äôre awesome, but just about every thing he‚Äôs saying in this song, I can relate too. Especially his song Glorious, keep up the good work :)
i love this video <3

Congratulations üéâ‚úåüèøüéâ which powder brush was that?! Your skin is so flawless, foundation is lucky to be included in the party.. ha.
So pretty!  Congratulations on your sponsorship!   üòäüëçüèΩ
your skin is so gorge!! Your giving me my life right now with your skin. I took my daughter into mac with me and they tried this color on her when it first came out and they just couldn't get over how beautiful it looked on her.
Yasss face is beat!!! <3 Very smooth skin Beautiful
Awesome video! What powder brush was that?
You don't even need makeup, your skin is everything ‚ú®
DEAR GAWD SHE IS SO PRETTY THAT LITERALLY TEARS OF JOY WERE ROLLING DOWN MY FACE FROM HER BEAUTY WHILE I WAS WATCHING THIS üòçüòçüòçüòç
I'm seriously going to need a skin routine for my skin to look as good as yours!
Congratulations! Well deserved!
NW58 was a perfect match on you. I wear NW55 but I might try out NC55 when I run out because NW is a little warm for my skin tone
God that colour looks amazing on You! Gotta love Mac studio fix!
you're one of my favourites <3 you are absolutely gorgeousssssssss
How is your skin so smooth like wtf
We are sponsored girl üôåüèæüôåüèæüôåüèæüëèüèΩ  love the skin
I mean this in the nicest way but I swear every foundation you try on never looks like it's going to match your skin, it's usually too light or too red or ashy. But then you do some voodoo magic blending and all of a sudden they all match you and it looks flawless and I just don't understand what you're doing to make it work because I can't even make translucent powder work for me but I live for it.
please try bh cosmetics new liquid foundation in the darkest shade
Congratulations on being sponsored! You deserve it! üòç
What brush is that ? I like the fluffy big brush and was curious if it worked for you??
Please try a foundation by pausa para feminices. There is a really dark color and I never saw someone trying the darkest shade
Congratulations on your Mac sponsorship and all that your doing, I saw you on The Harry Show as well...keep up the good work!
I stop using Mac a long time ago cuz it‚Äôs too orange and it oxides they matched me NC 50 which is too dark. Has any thing changed since then?
Short Videos Are There Best!
Love your reviews/tutorials and your skin is beautiful
Mac has an amazing shade range for pretty much any complexion! I have worn the studio fix powder in nw10 for ages.
Is it just me or does she look like Gabrielle Union??
I feel like most foundations you try out are a tiny bit too warm for you. You seem more cool toned
I'm a long time MAC Studio fix fluid user. I'm NW 47. I love it!
I don't know how I've watched so many videos of yours, and I've never been subscribed!!! That problem is now fixed!!!!!
That looks really pretty on you!
Your so beautiful you don't need makeup
I LOVE seeing the collection of such deep ebony shades of foundation in the background of your video! Make-up has come such a long way ( but still theres room for improvement).  Thank you for being strong and confident and bringing diversity to YouTube x
Your skin is GLOWING! even before the foundation! Wow
Congrats on the sponsorship! You truly deserve it ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm glad other make UP brands are catering to darker tones but it annoys me that they're only doing it because the dark shades at Fenty Beauty were selling fast
How is it that, I think, every dark foundation I've seen looks straight up orange in the bottle but then you blend it in with your skin and it looks like a perfect match? Is it the case with every other darkest foundation? What kind of magic is that?\n\nI'm not trying to be hateful, I'm honestly curious.
Yes girl get them coins
I honestly don't understand why you have so many subs you're not even nice
Your skin is so flawless you dont even need makeup, i didnt see a difference!.. #blackisbeautiful#
i like mac for its full coverage but it breaks me out - leaving me with dark marks all over
Just went on the website and the prices are so affordable... I just have a heard time shade matching but the prices are unbelievably cheap... I have spent 45 dollars for a thing of makeup theres is all under 20
So happy for you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Congratulations on your blessings!! You deserve it..
Trying to understand why this is only one of your first sponsorships!! üò©You deserve so much more and cannot wait to see you shine. You're golden ‚ù§
Hi there check out my first vlog:)
Yay Mac is a really good brand to do a sponsorship with because they are a trusted brand no matter what foundation I use I always come back to them
Love this on you üòç
ugh, you always astonish me with how stunning you are!
She's a beauty üòª
You should try the primark foundation! I saw it was about 3 dollars!
Hey! I love this video! What brush did you use to powder your face? üíï
What brush did you use to set your face????
congrats on the sponsorship and the growth to your channel! you deserve it
Yay Nyma! You‚Äôre so stunning inside and out! Glad to see you do so well üòç
Ughhhh you have perfect skin!! I wouldn‚Äôt even wear makeup if I had your skin! (Okay I would because it‚Äôs fun haha) you are STUNNING!!!!!!
MAC studio fix fluid is one of the first foundations I ever bought and it is one of my OG holy grail foundations! I love full coverage foundations and I personally don't mind a thick consistency and this foundation gives me all of that! The color range is sooo diverse as well. As long as I use a good primer and I bake my whole face with a setting powder...I have no issues with this foundation!
You are so beautiful!!!üòç I wish my skin was as flawless as yoursüò≠
You don‚Äôt need foundation since your skin is already beautiful as is!
What are your secrets for such beautiful glowy skin!!! I‚Äôm jellyüò´

Listen, the witty retorts in arguments are snappy and funny, but I'm just not into getting riled up over staged drama. The dance and song bit is my favorite, the touching moments and catwalk are good. I'm just not a fan of the reality TV show world in general.

The Japanese only allow limited immigration and immigrants are always foreigners. I find Japan to be so much more interesting than Britian. Britianstan is meaningless globlalist nothing. Islam will take over in a generation or two in Britian. But not Japan. Their leaders at least protect their borders and preserved their culture. Their kids aren't being raped by Pakistani gangs as they are all over Britian. \n\nAnd its just sick how the Royal Family....does nothing. They do nothing to defend Britian. Hilariously they join their military which defends everywhere but their own nation. But that's how globalism works. Globalist tools secure trade and leave borders open.
this is so cute :D Harry is a man! :)
hey cute prince can you give some popcorn to me it so taste graet hahaha
Shouldn‚Äôt the news be reporting on other shit like the hurricanes.
btw.. who the hell is harry?? anyone?
The Jewish Talmud:\nGoy/Goyim=Non-Jews\nSwartzka=Black people\n\nMidrasch Talpioth, p. 225-L Jehovah created the goyim in human form so that the Jew would not have to be served by beasts. The goyim is consequently an animal in human form, and condemned to serve the Jew day and night.\nSanhedrin 57a . When a Jew murders a goyim, there will be no death penalty. What a Jew steals from a goyim he may keep.\n\nBaba Mezia 114b The goyim are not humans. They are beasts.\n\nBaba Kamma 113a. Jews may use lies to circumvent a goyim.\n\nAbodah Zarah 36b. Goyim girls are in a state of niddah (filth) from birth.\n\nMenahoth 43b-44a. A Jewish man is obligated to say the following prayer every day: ‚ÄúThank you God for not making me a goyim, a woman or a slave.‚Äù\n\nSanhedrin 57a . A Jew need not pay a goyim the wages owed him for work.\n\nBaba Mezia 24a . If a Jew finds an object lost by a goyim it does not have to be returned.\n\nAbodah Zarah 22a-22b . Goyim prefer sex with cows.\n\nLibbre David 37 ¬†To communicate anything to a goyim about our religious relations would be equal to the killing of all Jews, for if the goyim knew what we teach about them, they would kill us openly.\n\nSchulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat 156 When a Jew has a goyim in his clutches, another Jew may go to the same goyim, lend him money and in turn deceive him, so that the goyim shall be ruined. For the property of a goyim, according to our law, belongs to no one, and the first Jew that passes has full right to seize it.\n\nHadarine, 20, B; Schulchan Aruch, Choszen Hamiszpat 348 A Jew may do to a non-Jewess what he can do. He may treat her as he treats a piece of meat.
starving kids in Africa could have eaten that popcorn
Why the hell is this trending in india ??

@10:40 'We want to keep it in the water as much as we possibly can'.... As he holds it above an aquarium with a GIGANTIC ocean behind him. Hmmm....
Btw guys i went scuba diving here a day after coyote went and the locals were really mad at him cause this traumatizes the fish.
I have QI OF 130
It was so funny when he said here‚Äôs something cool and then an ad popped up and it was a man making a sandwichüòÇ

Will you do that warrior wasp challenge?
Ive never really noticed till now but coyote kinda sounds like charlie day

El tema con Beyonc√© No est√° mal ... Pero el que lo edito la canci√≥n le qued√≥ horrible!!  Ni pega ni junta ... Le quitaron el toke que ten√≠a la original Est√° versi√≥n est√° apagada J balvin quiso hacer algo parecido a lo que hizo Luis Fonsi. Con Justin    pero almenos qued√≥ pasable el Remix de esa canci√≥n  la voz en espa√±ol de  Beyonc√© es como la del traductor Google  ._.
But my desire to hear the end of this story is so strong.
Have you tried turning it off and on?
When your Legs don't Work Like they used to before
Good luck casey hope the results are good
hope you never make a video again too
Same. I broke my ankle and had 2 surgery. Now i cant play football or run i can only swim. FML
Well that is a UNSUB video if ever I saw one...
For real though whats the name of that song at the end of the video ive been searching through the link provided but nothing?
pick up a bong, chill out.
Sorry to hear. Do what you can with what you have. Life eventually humbles us all.
casey is one of the most amazing cinematographers i know
Casey is such a motivational person. He did the impossible and did the opposite of what they said he couldn't do!
Song at the end?
You have not done Norseman ?
I don't know why I'm watching this. I can't even stand this guy.
Hello, man! Check fruit diet, your knee will be like young kid knee.
casey where did you get those jeans man, love them
This is life and shits happens!!! You cannot run but you can do other stuff!! It is hard but my dear.....
i guess i will have to say\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit runs through the family
I would like to thank Casey for inspiring me to run. Today was my first day going on a run and it was because of this enlivening video. I so hope this injury doesn't block you from you from one of the things that makes you Casey Neistat.
this is a hoax, Casey is Lazey thats all
Too bad you can still vlog üòû
Real life forrest gump but smart as heck
watched this just after my 7k run, sorry Casey wishing the best for you i know the importance of running and feeling very grateful my body is working well.
Running in the nineties
you don't look like 36. lol
running is all ways good to remind you how good sitting feels some times :-)
im not sure but I think he likes to run
The amount of hate this video is getting is embarrassing. The edit, the intensity of the video in places, the fact that it was drawn out made it great and in albeit shit circumstances this is now one of my faves from Casey's videos
Life excels at humbling you when you think you are in control. It also brings change that is necessary for individual growth. If you fall down get the fuck back up. If you lose your legs get a fucking wheelchair and join a chair group that excels in sports and other activities! Don't be defined by your current struggles, thrive or die. God gave us an amazing ability to rise up when so much negative weight crushes down on you! \n\nI command you to rise up! -Jesus said that just now, I swear! \n\nLol but he would say it heh!!
Hi Casey we have the same pins. My hip. I still haven't recover /-: but still vlogging
Hi man , mabe you should try foods that contains collagen .
Damn dude I didn't realize how fuguly you really are
Its so sad when someone get to know they cant do what they love anymore.
Fuck, I envy people with infinite energy. Laziness gets in my way
So just run away from our problems, gotcha
that accident must've been pretty serious to break your leg like that
No news, is good news, right? Hopefully your knee isn't in too bad of shape!
Do a line of coke before you go running you'll be fine
Casey found the coke again
If you can't run, then swim - better for your joints anyhow.
60-80 miles a week my assüòÇüòÇüòÇ
What about HRT? At 40 it's not a bad idea Testosterone and some HGH repairs all types of shit and they will make you feel great.
He sure makes running sound fantastic, hell it made me wanna get up off my ass and go run. So guess what I did, and about 42 strides in I came to another fantastic realisation, I'm fat and out of shape. So I think I'll have some apple pie instead and tell everyone how much I love to run. Hey guys I ran 12 miles today.
I never really watch Casey but this is just insane. Best wishes from germany.
Have a look at the one thing that you run on. Concrete! Why do you think tyres dont last as long.?
Sorry to hear Casey.  Hoping for the best.
I too, love running. Hoping the results will be good, but I have the feeling nothing's going to keep you from running. You'll just find a way around any obstacles. :)
Walk, don't run.....words to live by

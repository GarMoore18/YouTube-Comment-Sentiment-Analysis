When Johnathan was talking about those muffins all I could think about was that scene from mean girls; would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin? 😂
Love love love Anna doing that voice over for the dogs!! 😂😂
Alessia might be the happiest little human on earth 😂❤
Omg anna you kill me with the dog voices it's hilarious! Really looking forward to meeting you guys in Milton Keynes in a few weeks!

So so proud of your bravery, Jonathan ❤❤❤
Anna is so funny, she had me dying in her Bianca voice
Jonathan you are so brave! Anyone who knows you is lucky to have you as a friend
Eduardo is THE sassiest little man and I am in love.
I love love love when Alessia flaps her arms and makes that joyful breathing noise! I just LOVE it and it makes me so happy. #precious
Anna, why don’t you just take an umbrella with you!!
You are such an amazing human Jonathon xxx
I want to see Eduardo take over the vlog for a day!
God Bless you,  Jonathan.  I can tell how hard that was for you to talk about. I was almost sexually assault when I was 6 by a close relative.  I ran away so nothing ever happened,  however it still haunts me every now and then.  It took me years to tell anyone about it. I'm not sure why,  because nothing happened.  I guess I was just ashamed and that it was my fault for trusting this person.  Just know,  that you're not alone.  I've told my husband and kids what happened and the loved me even more.  Im not sure how I would have felt if I hadn't ran away.
Jonathan is such a good dad
Anna was so funny in this vlog, I just love her xxx
I'm so happy that at the start of the video they gave me an answer to my geography homework and we had to know what Budapest was the capital of 😂😂😂
Don't ignore signs of this happening to your children.
Anna needs to do a whole video just in the dogs voices. I love it !!
The fAct that you told people what  happened is incredibly brave, inspiring...and shows a LOT of strength...i hope it helps others who have sadly been in your situation...even if they don't feel so alone 💚💚 my heart breaks thinking of how many people have been victim of sexual assault 😢💚
I like how that, despite the fact that you probably had a rough day when you released that video, you remained positive and happy for your kids. I know how hard that is. I have severe anxiety and it’s sooooo hard to be happy for anyone or anything. I don’t have kids but as hard as it is for me to remain happy during anxious times as a single adult with no kids I can only imagine how hard it must be to remain strong in front of your kids when you’re feeling crummy. I’m so sorry about what you went through Jonathan. I’m so happy that you have Anna and the kids to remind you that you’re a great person and Dad and to keep you on your toes and help you get this off your mind.
Alessia seems like such a happy well behaved baby all the time ❤❤
Anna is literally the funniest woman in the world! Love her to bits! I aspire to that woman!!! 💕
Anna couldn't look more beautiful 😍😍
I'm so proud of you for sharing your story. It's so important to open a dialogue for men to discuss their stories too.
Jonathon you helped me with that video you put up as a survivor myself... I admire you so much for speaking up ❤️ I’m coming to see you guys at the baby event at olympia next weekend 😀💙
Hahaha that was the best promotion for innocent 😂 Anna's bianca voice is my fave thing ahhaha amazing!!!
I'm glad you told your mom. I am very sure that the video you posted about your terrible experience helped so many people. You are brave And supported by so many.
Omg lmao Anna's accent for Bianca was everything lol so funny!!!
This video proves that some viewers jump to conclusions way too quick and it proves that no, we viewers don't really know anything because there's so much going on behind the scenes so who are we to speculate. I'm saying this because I was scrolling through the comments of yesterday's video and I saw people being mad about him not telling his mom before putting out the video. So this is for all of you. In your face.
Anna doing the dogs voices is the best. Dying for an episode of the dogs voiced by Anna.
I love when Anna voices the dogs 😂😂
OMGosh, I love that exasperated little breathy laugh that Alessia does when she's excited. Its much too cute!! 😍😍\nAwwww, ballet with Daddy!! How fun!! 💚💜💛\nI love the ending, haha!! When you talk for them its hilarious!! The little Bianca knit was so cute too.
It could be the newer food you’re feeding the pups, that’s causing the staining on their faces.
Jonathan  we can all\nappreciate your courage! Your a wonderful example of strength and character. Your family respects and adores you as do hundreds of viewers. So thank-you for your bravery and bringing another truth to the pitiful silence of sexual assault!
Jonathan you are an amazing man, husband, father and friend to all of us. You are a brave brave man because not any man would have the guts to tell the world something like this. We love and support you. You are amazing because you didnt let this awful experiemce take over your beautiful peronsality, your ability to love and be happy. You are one of the few most amazing husbands a girl could ever want so loving and thoughtful to your wife, kids and friendlist friends !! WE LOVE YOU JONATHAN !!
Ur amazing for sharing ur story

Guilty Eau de parfum by Bianca Neve
Wow Anna...you look that this is such a struggle to get you child.  Whine...Whine...Whine...oh  my head hurts...  When are you going to be a nice person and parent?
This video is Clickbate
Well done for speaking out Johnathon, that can't have been easy to do. Anyone out there who sees this and has someone in their life making them do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell someone, a parent, a friend, a teacher, a sibling, a doctor, anyone and don't stop talking until someone helps you
I don’t even know what the dislikes are thinking!!! This is so brave of you Jonathan 🌎
Boring unintelligent narcissist parents parade their children for YouTube views shocker
Ok Jonathan. The hungry - Hungary joke is not a good one and not original. Sincerely: a Hungarian person \nLove you though
I AM FROM GERMANY.PLEASE TALk SLOW.LOVE THIS FAMILY.KISSES
I was also sexually assaulted at the age of 6 I’m 13 now but I’m just wondering if I ever have kids wether I would tell them, so are you ever going to tell them?

How dare YouTube take your money, you're what's keeping YouTube alive 💁🏻
Watching a week after you uploaded and you’ve still got ads playing before the video 💖💖💖
Hahahah Chloe you're just awesome girl. And how creative is this? Loove
I really love the vibe of your videos
Awesome job!! That must've been fun getting off. lol
So creative I love it chloe
That was amazing! You still look awesome in this costume! 👏🏻🎃😁
so good!!! I love how real you are all the time
lol chloe did you just wing this tutorial? especially coz you kept rubbing things off? even if you did thats amazing coz i wouldve needed multiple practices before putting it on camera. also ,why would your video be demonitized?
You're so great. Loved the vid
hahahah i particularly love the gratuitous cussing at the beginning. such fucking bullshit that vids now get demonetized for swearing. just one of many ways for them to ultimately control content.
Love this makeup and I look forward to all your videos😍
love this look! so original and you're videos always make me laugh!
You are the best Chloe!
love thiss look, and you more!
Why goodbye to monetisation when using fake blood?
Adore this! Love that you went for a full gore look but still managed the glam as well 😅 also noticed that you sound the same as you did in your early videos (maybe you were shyer then) probs because you could hardly move your mouth 😅💕
This is great and from what I have seen, original. I thoroughly enjoy your videos.
I laugh so much with your comments!!! You rock!! Xoxoxo
You are great! And always so fun!😘
you are the best 🙌🙌
This is legitimately the scariest Halloween tutorial I've come across so far! 😐😄 Chloe can you pretty please bless us with a 3 looks 1 palette tutorial with your new palette? ❤️❤️ K thanks love you bye xx
your videos are like the only reason i go on youtube!<3
You always have the most creative tutorials!
You are absolutely amazing! Love how this turned out.
Funniest intro ever only made better by your total lack of facial expressions
Fucking love you 😂
Wow, great work! 👏🏻 Love you. 😊
Love love that straw effects you created!
You honestly crack me up so much 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hahahahahaha, I love you girl! Love the way you keep it real
I love you so much❤️❤️❤️
I LIVE for this tutorial!!! 🖤👻🎃 YAAAASSSS BIIIIITCCCHHH!!!! I love it, thank you and thank you for being the beautifully amazing human that you are ☺️
Okay may be a dumb idea...or maybe not but maybe next year (or still this year) you could do a series of like glam looks that you then turn Gory so people can do glam or gory!! Love this look and obvi it inspired my idea but seriously obsessed with this!
u make me proud to be aussie lol
This was just cool
i freaking love this so much
that was hilarious
Omg so much work went into this video! I wish it was monetized, you deserve it!
This is the best Halloween tutorial I have seen yet!!!
Love you girl! I’ve been watching your videos for years! I personally never wear makeup and if I do it’s only eye liner and mascara but none the less i enjoy all of your videos!
I LOVE your Halloween videos so much!!! I think you're on the same level as special fx makeup artists cause idk how the hell you come up with this stuff on your own it's so creative and original!! I wish I had money to buy this stuff cause I wanna try this look! Can't wait for the next one!!!
i’m tryna wear this eye look to class this week
Such a good Halloween idea!
I've never watched a video on special effects makeup that was better explained.  this was great !!
Love you too much
I loved Logan and Children of Men is one of the best films ever made, so I had a lot of fun putting this one together! *What films would you like to see me tackle in the future?*\nAlso, if you happen to be looking for stock footage for a project and want to help support LFTS, check out the 7 day free trial of Videoblocks: http://bit.ly/LFTSVideoblocksTrial
If the lie is that bad things happen to people Logan loves, he is spot on it actually. Charles dies because of this whole thing and x-23 while safe for now lost the one father figure she could ever have and is going to die on the same fate as him because adamantium.
On the surface Logan and Children of Men may not seem that similar. I thought it was pretty blatantly obvious. Granted most people compared it to The Last of Us.
Simply, beautiful.  These 2 films epitomize the craft of story telling...and elevate it. Brutal, poetic, universal.
This was brilliant! Thank you so much! Indie film maker and actor here.
This is fantastic work Michael. Thanks for making us smarter about film!
I know this might sound overrated. But, can you do Godfather Trilogy?
Please do one on 2001: Space Odyssey cinematography or ambiguity, or even effects.
I knew I would love this video
Two great movies. And here's why.
Would love to see a video on you tackling any component of any one of paul thomas andersons films
I feel like The Last of Us can also be compared to these two movies in the same way
I didn't like Logan.  All the characters felt dull
I enjoy your video as much as the movies! Thank you for your time and effort.
Awesome video man! They're always better than the last.\nCan I suggest something about the build up on War of the Worlds (2005)? :0
Hey Michael loved the video I'm very new to your videos and since I go to an acting school your channel helps. I was wondering could you try to tackle ether Foxcatcher or Fury? Cause I know there's incredible things in both films.
Very similar to The Last of Us, the three are amazing stories
Children Of Men is my favourite film of all time along with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, would love if you did one on them? Or anything by Charlie Kaufman, the man is a genius! Love your work!
Show me more.
I'm a simple man. I see Children of Men... I click.
I’d love to see you tackle something with minimal dialogue like Shame or Hunger
I never noticed the similarities between these two movies before. Another great video as always.
Do a video of the new Netflix series Mindhunter, pleeeeeeeease
Logan immediately became one of my favorite comicbook movies after seeing it in theaters (and with time, will probably only get better).  Children of Men is one of my top 5 favorite movies to date.  Alfonso Cuaron is a brilliant director.  The cinematography is superb, and all of the actors really flesh out their roles.  I've watched it numerous times, and my enjoyment only increases with each viewing.
so glad i found your channel
Hey Michael Great content as always\nI want to ask you something\n\nI'm having a plan of making a film essay, and i want to ask you what method do you use everytime you analyze a screenplay ? Did you watch the film as you studying the script ? Or you just read it first and then watch the film ? Because i found it really hard for me watching a film and read a script at the same time\n\nThank You !
I absolutely love both of these films. Thank you for the lesson here: as a writer and as a movie lover it makes complete sense.
amazing video as usual, for your future videos, I'd love to see your analysis on The Room by tommy wiseau. i'm sure you love that movie lol
Hey! that was a pretty analysis. But I do have a small disagreement: Logan's lie. At the beginning of the video I thought it might be a bigger disagreement, but you do address part of it when you talk about the initial attitudes both protagonists have about the future. The thing is: I'm not sure Logan's lie is some aversion towards family in general.... I mean he does go to great lengths in order to take care of Xavier in his very complicated decrepitude. I'd probably say that Logan's lie has to do with where he thinks his family exists and what he should be trying to save. His lie is that his family ties can only exist in the past and that the debt he needs to repay to professor X can be repaid by taking care of him. But the truth is that his debt must be payed forward, that his obligations are towards the future, not the past.
Your analysis is amazing as usual. Also, I couldn't agree more on how ridiculously underrated Children of Men is. Truly, a masterpiece!
man Logan really took me by surprise. I knew it was going to be good but it was amazing
24 ways Children of Men and Logan are the same movie.
As Charlie Kaufman says in Synecdoche, New York The end is built into the beginning.
My heart leaped out of my chest when I saw this in my notifs! AAAAAA!! I love both films- Logan is the best X-Men film out there, and Children of Men holds a special place in my heart since it's one of my favorite films ever! And I agree with what you said about it- that it's one of the best films ever made!! GAAAAHHHH--\n\nThat aside, I really love watching your vids 'cause they teach me a lot about films, story telling, character analysis, and etc. Thank you so much for them, and I hope you keep doing your thing! <3
Now I must watch Children of Men.
I was waiting for someone else to make this comparison!  So glad you did!
I've just rewatched The Breakfast Club - pleaseeeeee consider doing an episode on that film.  I'd love to hear your take.
Amazing. You make my comparison film reviews look amateur. Great video man.
Whether or not you do a video essay on it up to you, but if I may recommend a film to you with a lot of themes and ideas to unpack, you should check out The United States of Leland starring Ryan Gosling, Don Cheadle, Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Malone, and Chris Kline. Very heavy film.
Hi Michael, I love your video essays. I've been learning a lot. I'm writing a story sort of like wonder boys (by Chabon) and Sideways. And although i kind of see the comparison, i would very much like to see your take on it. thanks a lot!
I love your work. Seriously. I'm a aspiring writer/screenwriter and your essays have helped me a lot trough the process. Here's a suggestion: analyze Chinatown. Why is it so important? Why is it so baddass screenwriting? Thanks again and keep up the good work, man.
Now I want to view both films back to back. Fantastic work.
One of the best analyzing videos I've seen. Great analysis on my favorite movie of all time. Keep up the awesome work.
One could say Han Solo could fall into this category
One of the two favorites movies of all time
i really loved both of these films and I was blown away by this great comparison and analysis - great work!  very inspiring!
There are two types of people whose choices/actions defines them as true heroes: Those who endure all the pain, suffering, and sorrows of the world, so no innocents would ever have to feel them. And those who no matter their desires to protect the innocents and to see justice is served, by the book and nothing but the book, are hated, look down upon, and whose names are ridiculed by same innocent people they fight to protect. They continue to protect them nonetheless, without any regrets. :D
Another amazing video.  Thanks for the incredible content, it's serving as much needed inspiration as I battle through my screenplay.
Best video I have ever seen
I guess you can add The Last of Us to this as well and I love all of them. I guess I'm just a sucker for this type of story.
This video is beautiful. Thank you
Great vídeo !! I wound love to see you talking about The handmaids tale 😃
This is like a video essay. Thesis and supporting evidence.
The Beginning is the End is the Beginning - Smashing Pumpkins
Great video, can you do The Prestige?
Verrrrry well done sir! Keep up the good work!
I will buy those books!
You have such fantastic content. I watch your videos multiple times bc they really get my creativity going. Thank you so much for the work you do!
When you brought up the protagonist believing in a lie that reflects the problems with society, my immediate thought was Bladerunner 2049. What a beautiful character arc for K
I didn’t even have the language to articulate it at the time, but I knew Children of Men was the most powerful (and probably best) movie I had ever seen the first time I watched it.
Great topic.  I'd believe this idea more if you started the explanation with the beginning of the stories instead of the end.  Better proof to just see how it is before the persuasive links are made for the learners.
This video is great. I’m definitely subscribing and definitely binge watching more of your videos
Another piece of media very similar to this is the Last of Us. Identical narrative composition.
how about... THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, please? You've need tackled on a comedy, besides GHOSTBUSTERS and American Beauty, although the latter film isn't exactly a comedy...
Please do an analysis on La La Land! Though I personally think that the screenplay is mediocre, the execution is spotless, and I would LOVE an analysis on the this aspect.
I've never thought about this but soon as I read title of this video I (internally) screamed: Of course!
Wow, The Last of Us follows this formula point for point as well.\nI was joking when seeing the Logan trailer that it would be the Last of Us movie we didn't get but I hadn't realized how similar the two stories actually are until watching this video.
I'd never realized it, but the Matrix fits this structure to a T as well.
It is hard to believe how young your channel is. You went so far, so fast.
I appreciate your work so much. just amezing work.\nmuch love from Denmark
The last of Us is heavily inspired by Children of Men and Logan is basically The Last of Us  but with mutants.
One of your best essays yet, Michael! I love both movies, and you've communicated why they are so effective so eloquently. Really good job
The Last of Us is similar, I think
Whatever you do, whatever you make, I always love all your videos :)
Really wish this was longer..I love these videos so much
Love this channel! I used your advice from the Star Wars LFTS to make the protagonist of my short film more active! Thanks for making my writing better.
Never seen Children of Men but it kinda reminds me of V for Vendetta. Why are the British so convinced they will be the last country standing(and why do they need to turn Fascist to do so)
Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't figure out why tho. DO IT PLEASE :-D!
Fuck man, I love this episode
We really need an analysis on Acts 2 and 3 as well.
I wonder if the academy has the guts to give Jackman a best actor Nom for Logan?
Okay, I would pay you to do a full analysis like this of your favorite movie. These videos are insane.
I love how, even though I'm a writer and not a director, most of the lessons you cover are applicable to my work. Big thanks as always.
This was fantastic!! Man...thank you for making these.
You are great at this. Thanks you for this. I love your essays. And also, your voice is soothing.
Once again, congratulations, Michael. I believe this to be one of your finest works yet. It's quite a pleasure to watch such thought and well-crafted analysis every week. By the way, I also consider Logan as one of the best films of this year, but I must say I did not care much for Children of Men after I first saw it, many, many years ago. After this wonderful essay, I sure will give it another chance. Greetings from Argentina.
Beautifully said.  I absolutely adore the analysis in your video essays, keep up the great work!
(sorry about my english) I've never watched CHILDREN OF MEN, so I've watched only for watch this video. Amazing movie and analysis. Thank you.
It's almost been a year since I started the 3rd draft of my novel for NaNoWriMo. I finished it in the summer time and have been taking a break from it to build my business, and I am often contemplating revising it soon.\n\nTHIS video essay has inspired me to come up with way better revision ideas than I had thought of the past year. Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel. It truly helps a lot!
Bravo.
That was aweomse!
Amazing job! Keep it!
Very informative video. Thanks.
fascinating as always!!
Excellent video.
fantastic stuff
review rudderless
I'm sure you've been asked this before, but is there a resource list of all the books you reference in your videos? Would love to add it to my reading list.
To be honest this kind of ruined Logan for me. Now I cant help but see it as a discount Children of men.
tbe films are quite similar; a reluctant hero gets pushed into a dangerous journey that leads to a powerful conclusion... Mate.... That's literally every single movie ever made
Hey!        I was wondering, if you take suggestions?     With the latest feud with the Florida congresswoman, and the gold-star widow; where Trump can't stand them reporting what he said truthfully, and then sending out  Gen'rl Kelly to spin it like calling out Trump for being disrespectful is the greater disrespect.  (Ha)\n\nHave you thought about parodying The Wiz's, 'No Bad News'?\n\nAs in; It's the truth, but 45 wants NO bad news?
Randy I sent This to everyone I know!! This is the best ever!! Keep it up. I love your stuff. 💯😘😂
Does anyone besides me think the guy looks like Jonah from Superstore?
I don't like Despacito but I love your version!! so funny
He's SUCH a desperate cheeto. :3 #DesperateCheeto
I think I have a crush on you, Randy! And I'm a straight woman! Married too! Happily, I might add. But I just had to tell you how brilliant, funny, and talented you are! Not to mention a cutie pie! Great vocals too! You are a ray of sunshine in these dark days in which we live. Thanks for making us laugh in spite of having the Desperate Cheeto in the White House!
Who else has noticed that there not very much hate in the comment section. I think the trump voters learned their lesson.
Came for the Cheetos..Stayed for the musical brilliance that is Randy Rainbow!!!!😆🎼👍
3:51 is when he was talking to a mirror.
this is lit asf 🔥🔥😂
Kys
What about florida
love this! this is so funny
I love this I don't care what others think about it I just love it
I LOVE THIS VIDEO SOOOOOOOOO MUCH I WATCH IT ALL THE TIME BEFORE I GO TO BED AND SLEEP
Weird Al would be proud!
OMG, first video I see of you and loved it.. And coming from Puerto Rico and hating that song, I love this parody
You've had a rough week from about a year now lol
I LOOOOVE THIS!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣\nMy distaste for agent orange to my favorite tune!! 😍😍😍😍
I. LOVE. THIS. SONG!
“You’re the color of the sign outside the store that says Home Depot” I DIED OMFG😂
finally a voice of reason
Calling trump a cheeto is an insult to cheetos
Why isn't Randy more popular????? He's a freaking genius.
This is so funny!
OMG! I just Stumbled on this video the day it came out and literally spent the entire weekend catching up on Randy’s genius! I’m obsessed and addicted! Watching these all weekend made me realize I haven’t laughed since the inauguration.😂😂❤️🌈
I can’t believe that he promised the people less taxes but he hasn’t even did anything except make people annoyed at him and getting people KILLED. Not to ignore that he swears too much and too much Twitter 4 U
I look forward to every song you post. You are fantastic!
This song is the reason why I am still sane
i thought randy was going to do a sketch in a parking garage or on the phone with eminem
Omfg this is amazing. Also love the Desperate Cheeto. Who’s with me
He kinda has a Charlie and the chocolate factory
Definitely the best video ever. My family's firm Puerto Rico too 🖕❤️ thanks randy
Pls put this on Spotify or itunes or something its awesome
Right on! Look up Tillerson's Song on YouTube, guys.
This is a good week for administration burns. This and Kellywise are required reading this week.
My favorite part of these videos is your glasses!  I love all of your other elements, too, but that's my favorite.
Who gave him A+'s? Him?
This was amazing. Thank you for it! Calling out the orange blob on Puerto Rico was necessary, funny, and touching.
Shared on Facebook, well done and keep them coming.  We are Canadian but we still think they are great.
Oh My GOD, Randy this is your best ever, you have really outdone yourself this time!!!\nxoxox
This video is awesome - can't stop laughing every time I watch it.
RANDY YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh
Can you post these lyrics up somewhere?
😆😆😆 this is so hilarious! You sir, just got a new subscriber 👍
I can't stop watching this....it is that good!
😂😂😂oml! I got it to 9k❤
My new favorite song like of you agree
I've now come back to watch this three times. So good
Omg... When I had first seen this I blew water all over my laptop busting into laughter! Like my new favorite song. Ahahaha...
Oh my god I love this so much
IM DYING THIS SONG IS SO GENIUS AND FUNNY
Oh my goodness Randy, I have tears running down my face, that is brilliant! keep doing what you’re doing, you make this administration more bearable.
Absolutely brilliant. On behalf of my Puerto Rican side of the family, THANK YOU RANDY!!
This is amazing! Life saver for those of us looking for some normality in all this mess
Hey, Randy - since you clearly have an in with the White House, can you arrange a meeting between me and Trump?\nI got some things I'd like to get off my chest. :)
Poor Trump. This must be the first time he ever tried to pronounce a word in a language other than English.  Someone must have tried hard to teach him the pronunciation and get him to pick it up accurately.  But they failed.
All those dislikes I will hunt u down and dislike u
Every thing u said is sooo true
Im so happy right now
The only reason there are dislikes is because people are mad that they didn't write this.
Good day,\n\nHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nThank You The tragedies are horrible, but this Yellow Bodied Cowardly LiAR-ito....\n\nThank you for your time.
Randy Rainbow is so pretty.
HILARIOUS..This guy is sooooo talented...great job...and guess what: he is right, with every word he sings
I hope Trump gets to see this. He'll probably try to ban YouTube.
That song describes Donald Trump in every single way
I love this song. It's intelligent, hilarious, and spot on. Plus, Randy, you are just adorable and fun to watch!
I died at you're this color. I went to Home Depot, and the sign made me think about this video. I laughed so hard that I farted.
I solemnly dedicate my golf trophy to the victims of Hurricane Donald.\n\nRandy Rainbow, you're a light in the darkness. And a genius. And I love you.
Priceless...
lmaooooo yasss Randy!!! too damn funny
Lol
😭😂😂😂😂
Brilliant!
Very good towels
This song is awesome 👏🏻👍👍
This.Is.AMAZING!
I Love Randy
best song ever!!!!
Desperate cheeto,why he tryna pretend hes helping puterico
Absolute genius Randy Rainbow xxx
Brilliant!
Yes, bleep-o.
I FREAKING LOVE THIS OH MY GAWD !
Good Boy!!!
DESPERATE CHEETO IS AWESOME
I hate trump
Wonderful, Randy!
You go randy
Awesome!
THIS IS GENIUS 😂😂😂😂😂
My blood still boils and my BP rises at the disregard for human lives by this terrible horrible despicable man somehow elected as president. The nerve of a person with limited language skills and who can only speak one language at 4th grade level to mock those of us with accents and the loving way we pronounce our country's name is 'insoportable'.  Randy's parodies help me put things in perspective and bring my anger to a manageable level and my BP lower. He makes me laugh and I feel better all day.
Randy Rainbow is the heir apparent to Weird Al's throne. I would SO love to see them do something together. They're both such wickedly smart guys and brilliant performers, their shared take on something would be amazing. Seriously, Angels would fall from the sky laughing.
Another great one.  I don't know where you get all the continual creative energy from to do these.  If I had to watch as many videos of him as you do I would surely be heaving over the toilet most of the day. Thanks for getting through this sickness for us.
This why Trump will get 8 years. Thank you
Ah, Randy Rainbow, what was my life before I found you?  Personally, I blame my sister because she's been a fan for ages and never bothered to mention it lol <3
bless whoever carved dat pumpkin at 3:38
YOU  SUCK...LMAO
A bit racist isn't it?  The next time there's a black president, will it be okay to poke fun at his skin?
Whats funnier the song or this faggot liberal. Too bad a total flame ass made this , funny parody but this is last guy/girl to make fun of anyone

These persons commenting that he has a woman's voice do know that was someone translating for him right ?
Is this voice of Rashida Jones??

Why is there no support from fans of Man City ?, Why do not they sing? Why a quiet stadium? It's like a friendly match.
No Aguero, No Problem!
Wow, I did not expect this to be his voice, it's a lot more feminine than you would expect
Turn on subtitles and watch the end of the video...
Damn he sounds like a woman! \nJesus we love you 💙 CTID

Can the interviewer clear his throat?
I love the lipstick, what brand ? Which colour ??
Lisa! Can you please give a María Félix makeup tutorial! She was one of Mexico’s most beautiful women. With very characteristic makeup.
Pls pls pls pls pls a tutorial with Doutzen Kroes :p one of the most flawless Beauties ever
when other youtubers are collabing between them and Lisa is collabing with top models from the 90's you know the difference in caliber.
can you please do make up on an asian person without a crease?
I will say that I'm not the biggest fan of the quick fire questions -- I love the natural process of getting to know the person through Lisa's conversations with them while she's doing the makeup. Having the quick fire questions makes it seem more jarring and less integrated with the video.
Beautiful job on the Legendary Claudia! Anything Bardot is fantastic
Lisa you make the rest of the 'beauty gurus' looking and sounding incredibly sad and cheap. Video like this one are an example of what a real professional should be. Thank you so much. And thank you for bringing a beauty icon such as Claudia.
I love Lisa's laugh at the end! So adorable! Fantastic work as always <3
Finally, a makeup look done on a true hooded eye- nicely executed. Her crinkly laugh lines are just lovely!
Claudia always was and still is LOVELY!!! :)
ANY SUPERMODEL that works purposes with you is a great person as well! NOW, if only Christy, Naomi, Kate H. and Linda could be next!!! Love these beautiful women!
So wonderful! I love the whole interaction, just so genuine and sweet!
Fabulous tutorial 😍 I cannot use eyelash curlers ... my eyelashes are so long and naturally curly and my eyes are hooded .. I actually try and straighten them out a bit with the mascara wand lol.
What a fantastic tutorial. I love Lisa. She's a true artist and leagues above the other self-centered 20-somethings flooding YouTube. Genuine class and style! And Claudia is so timeless. <3
That Golden Circle makeup bot was quite amazing!
Lisa you and me common thing is rings love
Her skin is everything
Fabulous video Lisa, I loved seeing Claudia, she is amazingly beautiful and natural (meaning no botox or plumped lips). Great idea to show us how you did her make up!!! Wonderful!!! Thank you !!! Cristina M.
Lisa, this was so much fun, with a great match of look & model. And I do want that lipliner color, I've been loving a light nude lip lately.
Hello Lisa Eldridge ..I would love to do the smokey effect underlining the lower eyes with liner or eye makeup..but I suffer from puffy eyes/ slight bulge quite near to the waterline...so how do I tackle this issue with make up...
Lisa looking gangsta with all those rings 😄. Love this makeup look. It isn’t easy working on mature eyes but I think the trick is not to overthink it. This smokey eye still works 👍🏾
She does have lines, but she wears them well and she's still gorgeous.
Gorgeous!!  Both of u!!  Thank you for sharing this moment in time with us!!
Great video, thank you so much for sharing this! You both are gorgeous & talented. It's wonderful to see two extremely successful women supporting each others work. LOVE!! One minor point, pizza cutter?!? How 'bout modified ball-point pen instead? <
What a lovely guest and a wonderful surprise!  A favorite of mine since the 80's!  Beautiful...
LOL I hit like before even watching!
Please please do rose makeup look from titanic... You seem to know exactly what celebrities use for their roles and real life.. I wana know what Kate used in makeup as rose and what hair colour was used and hair cut... Please do that video!!!!
I'm pretty decent with makeup but if I tried that dark of a smoky eye omg I would be a mess! Seriously talented! Goals dramatic but still minimal
2 wonderful women sharing a wonderful moment with us! Thank you ladies you’re both so inspirational.
Claudia had a few Chelsea Handler angles for me in this...
So beautiful! Loved the quick questions
She´s an archangel.
Make up look with Liu Wen, please! There are not so many make up tutorials with asian beauties. It'll be amazing!
Love how Claudia allows her face to have frown lines and crows feet, instead of botoxing everything away like what happens in Hollywood. Ageless beauty!
I have been waiting my entire life for this.Thank you thank you thank you.I love you Claudia
I didn't think Claudia would be like this, I have never really seen her talk much before. She seems really smart, down to earth and just a cool chick to hang out with. Great tutorial.
I love the 60s looks! Claudia has the most fantastic skin...stunning!
Such a cute video!
Brigitte Bardot is a beautiful woman but let's not forget she's also a keen racist.
She still looks like an angel. That skin!!
Yep! As I suspected, Lisa's rings reproduce
Hi Lisa, I really enjoyed this with Claudia, I’m a massive fan. I also made a video the other day on Claudia too. It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.
just look at this beautiful creature =) no botox and fillers... just plain gorgeous in and out ..   the most beautiful woman in the world!
Anyone know where Lisa’s rings are from?
Claudia looks so sweet such a kind person
Yes, what a treat! My fave model of all time with the best makeup artist ever!
She is the most beautyful creature in the world. I adore claudia🌹❤️. Thankeyou, Lisa
It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)
I saw one of the OG Supermodels, I clicked
OMG how do you get one of the biggest supermodels of all time in your video?
Black eyelashes and blond hair... isn't it weird?
Funny intro! Really loved the energy between you two Lisa. I did notice the new ring additons. They are so beautiful. Always wondering where you find those dashing rings.
I gave away a fragrance by Agent Provocateur to a free box.  ehehehehehehe
What a goddess she is
I am not familiar with Claudia Schiffer but you can see from the bone structure of her face that she is beautiful, with or without makeup. She looks like a doll, big eyes, slim nose and shapely mouth. Not sure if she had plastic surgery, but if she was born like that, she was born to be a supermodel. And she seems so nice and kind, which is a rare in these day and age with supermodels.
Wow, she seems so sweet , nice and authentic!
Once the Top Supermodel in the World, some 25 years ago.
Omg one of my favorite supermodel. She's the perfect Bardot.💕
this is a beautiful makeup tutorial and really fast haha I love all of the colours and you are my favourite YouTuber.
I slept with my makeup on last night. Take me out back and shoot me. :D
My younger brother was IN LOVE with Claudia Schiffer back in the day-she is still stunning and I just love her imperfectly beautiful teeth!,
Lisa Eldrigdge's videos are the only makeup tutorials I need and want to see. Love your work!
If only I could sleep in my makeup and look like Claudia when I wake up!
Lisa!!!! thanks SO much for featuring the original supermodels like Yasmin Le Bon and Claudia! Just what I needed after a hard week :D
oh Claudia is lovely isn't she - so articulate, warm and gorgeous  xxxxx
Beauty really comes from within...
Whoa Lisa is taking to the next level . Love Claudia . She's perfect !
OMG her skin is flawless i can't believe this.. another lovely collab!
Do you have a new ring or two?
I really love how she is ageing gracefully.
I love all the great 90s supermodels....! wow! despite the fact that they´re older now, they are still so stunning! Bravo, Claudia and Lisa!
Of course it's gorgeous!  So sad that Claudia's makeup is not available in the US :-(
Thank you for sharing the video, Lisa! I love how Claudia is so natural & classy and looking after herself after 30 years in fashion. She is comfortable & confident in herself that she doesn't mind showing us her lines, which we all have!!! Great to see her amazing self after being her fan for 25 years!!! Love Claudia!!!! XOXO
That intro, sooooo funny !!!!
Nooo waaaayyy claudia schiffer!!! Amaazing!!!
She is STUNNING !
Claudia is just beautiful
Claudia is beautiful

Wowzers!
😱😱😱😱😱
She's gorgeous
Wow, she looks gorgeous!
€10,000 raised for charity? That's amazing Lisa! I'm going to go back and watch all your videos + adverts again ❤
Omfg! THE Claudia!
I have really bad anxiety and I've only started to get help this year. You're videos arena of the main things that nave helped me battle it. Thank you. <3
It’s horrible that I relate to this. I just don’t feel it all the time. It comes and goes all the time and it gets bad. It’s like fog is in my mind and it never goes away the fog just occasionally gets thinker and thinner again. If this makes sense go to u I’m very surprised 😭
I know what it is like Dan (my depression is really bad right now)
Unfortunately depression never really goes away. It stays forever. Life however does eventually get better and there are ways to help yourself. I'm sorry to hear that Dan has had this problem, but I'm not really surprised.
They're the meds I'm on! They're literally a life saver, I'm on a highish dose and they allow me to get out of bed and do the other things that help, like exercise and socialising. They don't automatically fix everything, I still have really bad days but they mean most of the time I can be relatively normal. So reassuring to see other, high-profile people have the same issues and the same solutions!
This is the only explanation of depression that I've ever related to...
Thank you for sharing this depression doesn't make you cool
I deal with depression and anxiety and one thing that helps me is something that Simon And Martina talked about called 'Building A Ladder'. It may not help everyone, but it really helps me and I hope it helps others..
I just like how Adults get recognised easily but since I'm a Teenager Depression Doesn't Exist' to me or any Teen even though we get detention for not doing homework because we sit and think about whether to cut or hang ourselves. I just wish others would realise its not easy saying it when people go 'You're Faking it for Attention' 24/7 Stay Strong People!
here we go again, a video where we will discover a bunch of people being depressed. bravo
Video name: Daniel and Deppresion, still gets monetized.
Damn, I recognize this so bad
i am 15 i have been dealing with deppresion since i was 10(i got bullied) i had suicidal thoughts and i was always sick i couldnt sleep and i was sad i always have to take damn  medicine (fuck that) i have to keep talking to people (i hate talking) it sucks but...i have to do it cause i know that if i dont do it...i'll end up dead (ANYWAYS) Its ok dan i feel you
everything Dan has said honestly explains my experience with depression. I had no idea how to explain it, but thank you, Dan, for doing it for me.
well then, i'm in a therapy for years, i'm taking pills, i think now it's the exercise time \: but heck, i hate sports. anyway Dan, thank you so much for everything! you're amazing!
As strange as it sounds, watching your videos helped me with my depression. I would like to say thank you for your help even though you didn’t know you were helping!
You literally summed up how I've felt for years and describled it so well, I don't know how to deal with this video 😅
If I didn't have 2 jobs I wouldn't socialize. And if I didn't have those jobs to help my family, I wouldn't even go to work. I'd quit both jobs. But, because of the obligation I feel to help my family (even though I can't stand them and I feel trapped) I keep going...💔
It's like drowning but seeing everybody else around you still breathing
honestly this made me feel so much better
When im at my lowest i dont even have the motivation to brush my theeth or shower....
make a video about therapy please
Thanks for sharing your story <3
I didn’t cry cause the vid but the lines on his shirt don’t match up and I’m sad
How do you know if you have depression?
Did you get that suitcase I'm debhanams.\n\nAlso I went on sertraline first, but then I ended up like spazing out like muscle spasms and stuff so now I'm on fleuxotine or summut I don't know how to spell it but yeah. I get it. It hurts.
I've suffered from extreme anxiety for years and have recently been getting feelings of depression. Watching your videos have really helped Cheer me up over the years. Thank you!
Nononononno gods this is so me NO
Who could bully this bean? :(
Thank you so much for everything. For this video and  for all your other videos. I am autistic, have crippling depression, social anxiety and anxiety disorder so I'm like a walking mental illness (lol) and I can work on lot of things, with a lot of practice I cancalm myself down during a panic attack, I can force myself to go outside even on the worst day ('cause I have to, schooling system just sucks) I can watch your video and feel a bit better but there are things that I just can't control, like when I have a meltdown I just cannot force myself to smile and overcome it. It usually happens once every few weeks due to sensory overload and stuff like that but after somebody calms me down a bit(I usually just scream and rock back and forth) I watch your videos and all of my 'not good enough' thoughts go away. Tbh I think that you are my special interest. So, uh, yeah thank you for everything
Unfortunately, I will probably have to be medicated my whole life because of depression. Even with exercise and all those things, I will probably never be able to function on those alone. It's really hard to deal with because you feel like something has been stolen from you. Thank you for making this video Dan. So many people just need to feel valid. Thank you for making us heard.
Dan, you are so brave for making a video about this! I'm glad you found things that help you besides just taking something. Depression and anxiety is something I've been struggling with all my life so I really relate and understand how you feel. \nI know I'm just some rando on the internet, but for what it's worth i care about you
this video _will_ probably help a whole lot of people though and that's amazing Dan, thank you for that
We’re on the same antidepressant! High five!
Thankyou so much, I’ve been going through loads of shit lately, I have anxiety depression an Ed and like yeh but I don’t talk about any of it to anyone because it’s an awkward thing to talk about you can’t tell some one who’s having a panic attack to calm down that’s not how it works. It’s always settling to know other people are going through the same stuff as me and that I’m not the only one. Thankyou
Heyyy I'm on Citalopram tooo!! I got unreasonably excited seeing the exact same boxes in your hands. Thanks for this video, Dan. means a lot be so validated by someone so much a part of our lives
the effort needed to overcome depression depresses me.
the God of Serotonin Deficiency
I really needed this right now :) <3
He was being sarcastic when he said that it would be a shock to everyone right? Or does it just take one to know one?
fuck you, dan :)
Citalopram 20mg snap ahahhaah
Thank you.
Nigger
Hi dodie
I've used Citalopram in the past too. It gave me really bad side effects glad you find a dose that worked for you
The honesty and bravery depicted in this video by you Dan, is inspirational. I hope you know that by being so honest and sharing something so personal, you have made me (and plenty more people) feel less alone. You are one of my favourite YouTubers and I want you to know that something I do to lift my mood and motivate myself is watch your videos. Thank you.
When I ever I feel sad I watch dan and Phil because they make me so happy but knowing that dan doesn’t feel happy makes me even worse
it is always a good thing to talk about your problems and open up to others, but make sure you arent being one sided. My advice is ask someone how they are and genuinely show you care and then open up about how you feel, to keep things double sided. you cant be a burden to anyone if you are making sure to care about other people while talking about yourself. im just saying this from experience since one of my floor mates expects everyone to care about her depression while caring about no one
Thank you for being open about something that can be hard to talk about.
Thank you so much for talking about this. I have Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety, Paranoia and Panic Disorder. I agree that therapy, exercise, and self care are important for your mental health. I wish more people could look pass the stigma of what they think they know of mental illnesses. You are an inspiration and have made some of worse days into good ones. I hope things go even better for you :)
My fear is being labelled as my mental illness so i make relatable memes about it to help
I think it’s really awesome that you made this video! I’ve known lots of people who’ve suffered from depression I know how hard it is to explain mental health issues to other people, so I’m really glad you recorded this so that other people who suffer similarly don’t have to feel so alone.
We love you Dan !!!!!! ❤
I have depression, anxiety, and I’m bipolar. My father thinks I’m faking it even though my mother and her mother and my dads mother has it. He is abusive, mentally and physically and if I try to tell anyone they think I’m kidding. “Oh he’s not that kind of person” well guess what fuckers, he is. I’ve gone to a mental hospital because I was suicidal and I go to therapy even though I’m in the process of transferring therapists. I’m supposed to take zoloph or however you spell it, but it doesn’t fucking work and I have no medicine for my bipolar disorder or my anxiety. I’m not trying to get people to feel sorry for me but I just wanted to talk and I’m glad this video exists because for some reason everyone on YouTube seems to avoid things like this, as if it some nasty thing we’re not supposed to talk about
why! and how i'm inside..\nWhy do i find that so funny?
The part where he said that it doesn't matter what your life is like made it seem okay that I was depressed. I had the perfect life according to most people. Excersise kept me sane for the last few years and until this week I never told anyone.
I suffer from social anxiety (I have a therapist ), I often find my self stuck playing the same conversation over and over and analyzing and over thinking it. I often second guess myself and constantly think people hate me and hang out with are only friends with me because we've been friends for a long time and feel sympathy for my awkwardness. I try and be open about in the sense where I just put it out there that I have social anxiety and it gets in the way of a lot of simple tasks like asking to go to the bathroom or where the trash can is. \nWhat I don't talk about is how I second guess myself and and regret every awkward conversation. How I realize how I could made it less weird and more normal.
So like u are cay in your he'd?
thank you dan this video is what i need i've been in the runs for 2 months
i feel that you can understand everything that has happened to me, thanks Dan, i'm glad you doing better
I wish I could give this more likes.
For me depression is like not being anything or having a physical form but im still thinking and have a mental and psychological form. Also its like falling through ice in a lake and then the lake immediately freezes over
I can't quite relate to this because I don't have depression, but I do have anxiety. I hate explaining to people that I'm not just nervous and I won't get over it. I guess it's kind of like people with depression aren't just sad.
He’s being sarcastic about the “i know it's shocking to litterally evryeone right?
How do you tell your parents? I'm under 18 depressed and don't think they'd understand
I like to think that I overcame my depression but lately it's been getting worse
I see a therapist every other Monday and she's helped me more than anyone. I love her so much so I totally understand what you mean.
I've started having deppression since I was in 5th grade. I'm now 14 and my mom thinks that I'm deppressed because I turned pescatarian like a year ago. I've been to therapy and started taking some vitamins because she thinks that I just need it so yeah
I love this so much
my depression is as if i am trying to breathe underwater. sometimes i can but other times i keep sinking unable to hold my breath, not knowing why i can propel myself upwards or why my reflexes haven’t kicked in yet to do so. in the thirteen years of having it i still am riding the waves of above average and worse days.
this video ultimately explains everything. during this past summer/a little of the end of the school year, i fell into my first bout of depression. no matter what i did, there was always a numbing inside of me that shouted, “you’re not happy,” every single time that i was. it made me try to count what i ate everyday, causing me to take motrin for a stomachache, which resulted in almost puking and a panic attack. one of the next days, i had a killing stomachache and went to the hospital. very luckily, i found the right medication and it helped so fucking much. i decided, “elizabeth, this can’t be your life. you can’t keep counting everything and trying to diet when you are only newly 12.” i found social outlets that helped so much, like makeup and new youtubers (sorry such a stereotype). i knew that one day it would all be worth it, that i would be sitting down and truly happy one day. no matter what, i will have those bouts of aching stomach pains and depression, but i know that i will wake up the next morning and continue. all you have to do is tell someone, like your mom, dad, sister, and even dog or pet. im telling you, even though it’s cliche, it will help one day. thank you dan, for uploading this video and all of us that have struggled or are struggling. thank you so much 😊
God, I love you.\n\nThank you so much, Dan. You're absolutely wonderful. And I'm so proud to hear about all you've been doing to keep fighting against this. I'm very glad you're at a better place in your life. Thank you for giving so many people hope and support through your video. We really appreciate it. I hope you can realize how much you've done for us and what you mean to us
I just want you to know that your not alone. And that you can get through it. And I am suffering from depression and anxiety and I used to cutt myself. And too me depression is  like feeling nymb
I loved this video, it was wholesome and I've suffered from clinical depression for almost five years, I am so happy that you decided to bring up such a serious topic, this made my day a little better !
I suffer from OCD, and I've been on meds for three years now, and this video made me feel a lot better about my disorder and more confident about it. Thank you.
I'M SO PROUD
Anyone one else depressed cause dan is now Daniel Howell and not Danish not on fire? Xxx
all of this is so fucking true
I don’t understand how people disliked this video
This is so important for people to hear, whether depressed themselves or not. Thank you for sharing, Dan!
I think Dan is the only on who can make a video about depression serious and funny at the same time.
I take citalopram too!!!!
Night owl or Night Howell ???
' *YUP YA DADDY* '\n\nME
Thank you.
Thank you Dan. ❤
You really don’t understand how much this has helped me.Thank You.
I'm so proud of you, Dan
Daniel Howell, I love you.
You are Daniel freaking James Howell. You can get through anything just look at DAPGO
For me, when I'm going through a depressive episode, I literally don't shower. Like for days and sometimes over a week at a time. I sleep when other people are around, wake up when they go to sleep and then retreat back to me bed when they get up
thank you for sharing and for repeating htat it is an ILLNESS, not sadness.
I just feel alone/lonely even when there are people around me..I always try to get myself busy so that I don't start thinking
Don't be scared/feel ashamed to speak up. Coming from a small town I know that there is still a stigma around mental health but keeping it inside is not worth it. It is real and can be serious. Get help if you need it. Glad that more people that have influence have started talking about mental health. The first step to get rid of the stigma is to have conversations.
That remindes me \nI also fell i that black hole and stopped eating \nmy parents and my sister keept telling me i should eat but i did everything to not eat anything\nand now i can't eat a normal portion of food because i feel sick afterwards\nand i'm just fucking 12
Thanks uncle,don't worry he's dead
Gosh, I needed to see this. \n\nI've been to see a psychologist twice now, and after testing, I was told I might have anxiety or depression. And though I've been experiencing symptoms--I'm tired all the time, life doesn't feel real, and even though I love my friends and socializing, every time I hang out with anyone, I develop a major migraine in trying to keep up with the reality that I don't feel a part of--I didn't want to believe it. I didn't get how I could be depressed or have anxiety; I didn't know how I could live the way I wanted to, pursue the career I wanted to if I was depressed. \n\nThank you for sharing about your experience, Dan. I'm still scared and a little worried about what the future holds, but this was a major encouragement for me <3
YAY daniel my smol bean who deserves all the happiness in the world

It took 2 goddamn years... But gosh, I'm so happy for this man ♥
sincerely, i cried watching this video. but then when he started dancing i thought there would be a sick twist where he danced and fell into the pool. \n\nso glad i was so wrong.
I almost cried 😩 This is a good video for the song. The song deserves a Grammy and the video, an Emmy! ☺️I never expected something like this!
In Chile and other latinoamericana countries, TKM is used as an informal acronym for Te k(q)uiero mucho, which translated means I love you so much\nThat's exactly how I feel about Michael McDonald, Kenny Loggins and Thundercat... and the video of course :)
So disrespectful. He doesn't even open the brochure at the beginning smh 😔😔😔😤
This video and song had me in tears. I have limited use of the left side of my body, limbs are pretty much useless. You can become so bitter, you struggle and ask yourself why. You can become so poisonous and toxic to yourself and those around you. The samurai shows me its possible to heal, for that I am grateful. \nGrateful for this wonderful work of art.
damn thundercat mustve found the most soulful sounding white ppl ever. almost cried
BRAVO SAMURAI!!!!
I love this song
I've loved this song since it came out and to this day, I get chills whenever Kenny Loggins comes in and when Michael McDonald hits that high note before his verse is up. So damn good.
Your heart is strugglin', baby, try to believe. There might somethin' you just couldn't see. What about the torture, baby? It's so, so easy.
Nice to see Toro y Moi help the samurai get back in his groove.
If I make it to heaven, This is the song that I want to play when I arrive.
Happy birthday to the goat of the bass
One of the best album's out today!
WAIT HOW DID HE DRIVE THERE
The hug scene gets me everytime
1:21-1:42 when the bitumen is struck and separated out of the poor, plagued man. Thanks for the art, gentlemen. I loved that. Bit(umen) slap!!!
I swore his arms were gonna grow back.
Liking this guys music.. gotta love bringing those two legends back together again as well!
Anyone knows other artists that do this kind of music? I love the chord progressions, bass, floating retro synth XD... in this song
Now if he does Lava Lamp, I can die in peace.
Amazing
00:29 what kind of synth is that
Kenny, Michael, and Thundercat....on a track. Wat??
I didn't know who Thundercat was, but his powers of smooth music are great enugh reunite Kenny and Michael! Damn I'm a fan! Check out Yaght Rock for the whole story. Funny ASF!
You know you've made it when you sing on a miniature cathode television with freakin' Kenny Loggins and Michael f-ing McDonald! Glad to see them up and running :)
What a song! But a very weird video lol
The chorus is so
He will get his arms back in the future.
i follow the truth JIMMY ..
I was at a ramen joint waiting for my bowl when I saw the video on my feed I clicked on it and the first thing I saw was the samurai and I had to really keep myself from screaming so I had to pause the video and wait for me to leave the ramen joint and watch video at home, lol
This song is beautiful I can’t stop listening
This is some GOOOOD ass Music!! DAMN!!
Dude with the glasses look like Toro...
Is this a real family and he is actually missing his arms ?
damn stop abusing my experience with my now disabled mother and squeezing out my tears 😥
this song is so beautiful and magical
Coco would be proud of such smooth music
I heard of him from some Kendrick songs and I'm happy I accidentally stumbled upon this.
I really didn't think we'd get a continuation to the armless samurai's story. Strangely glad we did.
This was actually far more uplifting than I expected it to be
3:57 At the end of it alllll...
I love this song.
0:54 That was the Sonic 1 twinkle.
I been listening to this song alot! Love that he released a video for it
Why does Booker T have no arms?
did tyler the creator shoot his music video for answer there?
I absolutely love this! 😍
So glad to see him all positive and happy :)
I absolutely love seeing black cinema that transcends the trite bullshit that typically comes out of racist Hollywood.
Thundercat is a genius this has me crying tears of joy
Never thought I would see a music video sequel to Them Changes.
He slapped the black off of him lol 1:40
I thought this was KRS-One in the thumbnail
Call video. I thought for sure there was going to be a moment when his arms would sprout out after he got the crap out of his head and let his demons free in the sky. I’m not sure if this was supposed to be symbolic of someone shackled by depression or addiction, so I kept seeing the metaphor of the crap released from his head and the black birds flying away. Way to play the whole cheesy Loggins McDonald cheesy angle in the sky. Thunder is very cool. And is on my #selfiebucketlist
Wtf this is a phenomenal featuring
So, in the last instalment, he's gonna get mechanoid arms, right? Then Evil Red Lobster Samurai's in the shit... 🤣
if he falls in that pool he's fucked
Fuck yes I waiting for a video for this song, THANK YOU! Lol
Michael McDonald & Kenny Loggins are so legendary, so nice with Thundercat.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Loll this video already iconic. Thundercat always has the best videos
The samurai is back and mentally better. Now this makes me wanna go watch them changes. Hope there is a part three for this story.
how far does this samurai story arc reach to?
Walk On By should be about the other samurai
Im sorry but I cried. Healing the wounds of this brother the metaphors are overwelming- thanks T. Wellness = Healing.
The world is so depressing at the moment, thanks for giving the samurai an ending he deserved!
It's so..... Smoooooth.
OooOooh Kenny Loggins
Kenny Loggins!!!Yasss!!!
Excellent.
Nice

I love you guys
i'm in love with this oh my god
I need a Rose Coloured Boy or Fake Happy video!!! 💖
Zac back in the band should be reason enough to any atheist to start believing in God. hahahah \nMy love for this band only increased, and I listen to them simply since they started. That perfect divine melodic and energetic vibe remains in the band independently of any circunstancies the band go through or any new ideas they add. It can only come from God. I actually was growing up as they were also growing up, so you can understand how important they are for me. And notice, I am a person who thinks it's very unhealthy to idolize any artist, so you can see how much my love for this band is not just a teenager idol hysteria thing. hahahah I'm not even a teen anymore. Lol\nGod bless Paramore.
i've never related more to taylor york in my damn life
This will never not be the cutest thing ever

Jessi said she's posting videos since 'as soon as you could make youtube videos' and I thought 2005, and then she says 2013 and I'm like that's just 4 years ago. That's not that long ahahahaha

WHY WERE YOU A BLONDE KIM
Why did I picture high school Jesse as chubby and nerdy looking when she was actually tiny and really pretty 😂
High school Jessi was Jennifer Lawrence before Jennifer Lawrence was Jennifer Lawrence.

FETUS JESSI
I love your music! Can you play Welcome to the Black Parade by My Chemical Romance? Please, or because Halloween is coming can you play a song from Nightmare Before Christmas?
This is one of the first times I've actually enjoyed a song that was inspired Bollywood and made by a non Indian person because it's actually pretty accurate. Some artists who try to have Indian influences end up doing something that is an assumption of what and bharatnatyam is.
she is still so amazing
Lindsey transformed what has been considered nerdy and something kids thought was restricted to only the dorks and smart kids, into something COOL!!! My 12 year old son is probably considered a jock by his peers. He's just a natural all around sporty kid that always seems to have a ball in his hands. Never in a million years would he ever consider playing the violin because Orchestra isn't something the football kids did... But after seeing one of Lindsey's videos, he found her so Awesome and began asking if I thought he could ever be like her. He was so enchanted that he stopped caring what his friends would think and say about him if he played the violin and because of this, he opened himself up to so many new possibilities in his life. As a parent, that is something very special to see and I can only credit Lindsey for that. So thank you for taking the dorky and making it Awesome!!
I'm always listening to you in the car \n\nhttps://zrzutka.pl/jagoda
I wanna see her play devil went down to Georgia so bad, she's so good.
hi lindsey please mi name is joseph and my birthday is this 26 please please send me a greeting
One of my favorite L.S. musical pieces + one of my favorite L.S. videos. What an awesome combination.
It’s so good😊😊😊 ur an amazing violinist
You inspire me so much to follow my dreams everyday! i love ur music. This was one of my fav songs. glad you made a video its amazing as always♡♡♡
Wow Lindsey you are amazing, i love your songs 😍💖
wow crazy to think she's about to hit 2m. Subbed at 50k. What a journey 😘
wow it's just perfect
Please do A cover for descendants: rotten to the core ❤️🍎
Just an amazing artist with so much talent!!!!soulful woman!!!keep up the great work and never stop doing what you do!!!much love from a cypriot girl❤
Love this so much <3
do you can dance hip-hop?
When the song first came out I imagined what the music video for it would look like, and this is SO CLOSE to it! The only real difference is that mine had a flying carpet and life-size castle out of sand in the desert. I LOVE the video, thank you Lindsey!
Yet another amazing video where Lindsey proves she can do anything she sets her mind to. Really inspiring
You made me like violin
*Many thanks for an great videos, please see my channel, subscribe and be a part of our channel for hear relaxing music..* •2
I can't stop watching this
Oh, Lindsey. Can you break my heart any more than you already have?
I love her music video's. Her best ones are where she tells a story, example Roundtable revival!... I love this song and it ethnicity but the video was blaaa and disappointing. Could have been so much more.
I love all your videos but i absolutely love love this one, so beautiful!! So much talent🎻🎻❤
wow! She is so beautiful like a goddess of earth <3
Loved all the costumes and always a fan of your work. Thank you for being you and sharing your talent with the world! 💛
wow i guess linsey does go through dimensions...
This is awesome!! I love it!! X3 Lindsey Stirling is amazing!! EVERYONE VOTE FOR HER AND MARK FOR DWTS THEY HAVE TO WIN!! Also, how does she manage to pizz so fast? I can barely do it! *TEACH ME YOUR WAYS, VIOLIN MASTER!!* XD
Wow, nice!  I was just thinking i hadnt seen much violin&dancing fron yiur last few videos, more violin&acting/costuming, but you not only brought dancing back, you brought it to another level!  Looked great, sounded cool, keep on rocking it!
M E R A V I G L I O S A
so glad that someone has taken strings to new heights
How do you not drop your violin
I'm from France, I can't vote for you... so I vote in my mind. :( Good luck !!
i was finally able to sit and watch this and i have to say wow. great quality <3 this is really amazing and i cant wait to see what else you have in store for the future. i hope one day i can see your live performances ^.^ i had a friend tell me she went to a concert and loved it.
Her music videos never stop getting better and better
Lindsey, this track is 🔥🔥🔥 loving the nod to Indian music 😁
Girl, you are an idol to me.  I am rooting for you during DWTS, and I am giving not so subtle hints to my parents to get me tickets for your Christmas tour.  Woot Woot!
Skimming through youtube, trying to find something I can just listen to as I finish this math quiz. Hmmm, Lindsey Stirling? And she has a new video? Works for me! Ok, press play, switch tabs, and start question number 1. Not even 5 seconds in, I had to put down my pencil and switch back. The violin was just so enticing, I loved it!!!
I loved this new video Lindsay
This is gold, quite literally.
When u mix music in Indian Style, It always will be Great like this, Keep going Lindsey!, Next time try to play ur Violin against a Tanpura! and get a good musician from the music industry and try it with Tanpura,  or u can play Indian Raagas using ur Violin, Just wondering how will it sound Tanpura and Violin and An Raaga. Try night Raagas Like Kirwani or Shivranjani or Marwa!
Yes!Dynamics,energic and spiritfull.Thank's Lindsey Stirling.Bless You!
how much is the clip  LIN
I don't think.. I remember it having a featured artist?
Questions.. Are the lyrics.. A real language?
Woow my idol 💖👍💖👍💖👍💖👍💖👍💖🌹🌹🌹👍💖👍💖👍💖👍💖👍💖👍🌹🌹🌹 who want to know me?
Didn't know u could make those sounds with a violin
Welp now I know we're Taylor swift got her idea for the song oh look what you made me do
One of my favorite tracks, and now a fantastic video.  Just wish we could have seen your featured collaborator in the video with you.
Listen to this song  Lindsey, so beautiful! You should do covers of his songs: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYZOnIEUdYU&list=PLfx5HmJqhpo-Iwkw8Ti4bQSdWcadmiAHz&index=3\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoqetjCskXA&index=1&list=PLfx5HmJqhpo-Iwkw8Ti4bQSdWcadmiAHz
God every time she touches that violin my heart melts because of her music she is really amazing and very inspiring with her music and I thank you Lindsey Sterling for making me the person I am
I'm at a restaurant and they're playing your video at it 😃
Another AMAZA-BALLS vedio. Keep up the good work Lindsey Stirling.
It's amazing how you started off from scratch and made your way up. Can you give my channle a shutout I know you don't ever give shawtout,s bit please...if ya want!
I don't like it as much as some other videos, but it's good. I think it could have been more. I would have loved a real story.
I love Raja Kumari! Was her name just added in the title, or did I miss it before?
Who is this Goddess?  She plays and dances?
Hmm I  do hear a lot of  Phantom of the Opera in this.  any others the same ?
10/10 would use as battle music for a D&D / Pathfinder campaign set in Kaladesh
1 jungle 1 palace

Another AMAZING track!!!! I didn't know if it could get better than Elements or The Arena but....Wow. This is beautiful.
Cultural appropriation at its best
when is warmer coming out
my nigga 6lack looking faded as fuck. mad cover
Dayyyuummm
6LACK got soul!
Aye im not gonna lie to all y'all haters, in my opinion i think this shit is fire
This is 6lack putting his touch on the song, reason why it's a cover!!! I say flamessss!!!!!!
I heard dis song all my life... But he made me LISTEN. Badu was kicxin some REAL SHIT bac in da day...
Greatness will always be critiqued by those less qualified. Bless 6lack
Not the biggest fan of dude's music, but I really don't enjoy just watching you guy shit on this cover. It was obviously from a place of appreciation and respect for Badu. This genre is similar but not totally his. And dude did his thing on it. Stop the hate spread love.
This cover is pretty good!!!! Wtf are y'all smoking. 😂😂😂
I already know I'm gonna like this
Great voice. Soulful af
Straight Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I already New it was going to be fire had to like it before he even started
6lack is my guy; great music, but this wasn't wow at all. more like an 'oh, aiight, that was cool, I guess' lol
I liked it, don't understand the hate, he should've been more vocally flexible he needed more range
Its a cover smh. Its supposed to be a lil differant.
So In Love with his voice! 😍
I love this!! So soulful ❤ 6lack you did so dam good.
Not my style of music, but solid cover. 6lack has a strong set of pipes on him.
IM FUCKING SHOOK OMFG
Unenthusiastic has a face
So proud of 6lack and him getting the recognition he deserves! He's a gem.
That was delicious! Hmmmm...that vocal texture is other worldly👏🏾
DOPE...🔥🔥🔥
If You Don't Like This Then Kys
tidy!!!
A guy with a Sade fucking Adu t shirt singing a Erykah MF Badu.... I just can't ♥
They should do a collaboration 🔥
This is literally so so good, vibing.
why do i feel late
My day has been blessed :)
1000 level up from badu, sick !
Can you just cover all her songs....thanks
Damn beautiful low tone
😍🎧🎤 #6lack #vibes
i know it's probably because Ben and Liam get a lot on unsolicited hate in the comments but I miss the little intros at the start of these videos it was always cool to see a bit of what the artist is like
Cant wait for the show in Atl!!! Zone 6 baby
🔥
hoolyTv
The way I love this guy’s voice
Beautiful. \nGave me goosebumps when this was on the radio this morning!
Not my style of music but i love it
6lack lookin like Hall & Oates in the She's Gone video
Amazing 👏🏽👏🏽
Fam killed it
Loved it ❤️❤️
I honestly love this
Huge! So well done xx
🔥🔥🔥
1:29 my favorite part 😍

HETDClwTAuA,\n► http://mibik.ru/sex?x=HETDClwTAuA 😎
6lack did justice baby, yasssssss. fuck it up 6LACK
Best Like a Version in awhile
Lethargic
*yawn*
6lack makes really good music, however, this cover should not have happened...like, at all.
Six-lack never fails to amaze me
Shit sucks
Best thing since they found heroine
Bring john butler on again
Not bad at all
It sounds okay I guess, maybe because he looks so uninterested in everything it kinda puts me off, haha. There is a girl on Youtube who does a cover that's really nice, her name is Mudi
Yawn....
i can'tttttt<3
Definitely respect the nod to Badu. But this wasn't a good cover of On & On to me. No disrespect to 6lack though.
There's nothing remarkable about this.
This cover is trash lol this is disrespect lol
how did he fit that rat on his head under that small ass beanie
who is this sixlack?
Terrible voice
Crap
Erykah wanted to call him after hearing THIS ? Sounds lifeless to me. No feeling. #DontBelieveTheHype
Follow me on Insta for behind the scenes: www.instagram.com/thefoodranger\nWe are continuing our street food journey through Sichuan and making our way to the South of China into Yunnan. We found some incredibly delicious street foods you’re going to love in this video! And one of the SPICIEST things I’ve ever eaten!I would love to hear from you in the comments below too! Thanks so much for watching, and I hope you’re doing well and eating well!
Ugh...u make my mouth water.
That chili sauce dipped pork baozi looks SOOO good.  *gasp*
First time ever seeing ting ting eat anything lol
how the hell do you finish all that food? especially if its hotter than hell fire?! \nIt's kind of wasteful if you ask me. Just ask for small samples of each dish instead ...
what does trevor do with the leftover food?
Whatever happened to being about to drink milk straight from the cow?  :(
我吃藕😂
let's eat Pork, and let the Halal go to hell.
I've been watching your videos for a while and I really enjoy them. Watching your videos has actually inspired me to become a chef and cook this kind of food. It's like an art. I love the variety of spices used and I love the many different flavors that are provided. Not to mention I love spicy foods I love the way it's prepared. I've been making things from home and found that I have a passion for it. Piano is my main thing but this will be my other goal. If you have any tips on where to start in becoming this kind of chef it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your videos and I look forward to many more!
Where is Chu Chu , tell her I want to eat  her feet.
嗨，最恨看美食频道，满满地想回国
Congratz Trevor! Love your FOOD-DOCU. My tastebuds is longing for those delicious foods!
When I saw 凉虾, I almost cried man. Such a homey desert for my childhood memory!
saliva flowed out
You should've exceeded your spice rating with a tag that says extreme, hahaha love the videos
*you might not be able to eat the raw yak*\n\nwatch me wolf down this raw yak!
Again a fantastic video Trevor;-) The last dish, Chicken feet/lamb dish was really spicy i could tell.. Steam came out of your ears.. ;-))
Do you ever miss a western breakfast ?
much love!
I love all your videos man , you are the best , will you visit Egypt soon ? you will like the Egyptian food !!!
Really nicely shot video food looks great
U have great videos and congrats on 1M subscribers, I m wondering why don't u go other countries to do video on different food,,,,,
Your poop was probably Tai Hao La burning the next day
Trevor if you like spicy food you should go to Hunan! It's supposed to be even spicier than Sichuan food :)
Lol I'm born n raise in Zigong, and now living in Toronto, you are like a half countryman to me now. Lol This video has gone viral in my wechat. Thanks for creating such a mouth watering video to show the world my hometown food.
Thank you for the information you gave in the video and the description box, it is handy for people who want to know the information and follow where you go. All of the menus you tried looks amazing! I'm living in Bangkok, Thailand and I really love street food. I hope one day I have a chance to travel to Sichuan and try their street food too :)
why arent you fat? why
“ OHHHHHHH “
真不应该晚上看这个，而且是在我减肥的时候
omg...chili overdose...looks very good
gave ti u big fkn dislek
This guy's voice just soothes me
dear brother i want to know about the big give away prize to come to your trip i am from lahore pakistan i hope to win that dear trevor i want that
why u put 包子into the chilli sauce? I think the老板娘 just wanted u to put dumplings into the chilli sauce. Unlike Shanghai, in Sichuan，we usually just eat 包子without any sauce. However, if u like it, then eat whatever u want! lov ur videos in Sichuan, they make me homesick and I really want to go back to Chengdu and enjoy those delicious food❤️
It's amazing to see everything so fresh and colorful in even the tiniest of shops. America should take note.
Ting Ting 🙋
Do you bring your own chopsticks to restaurants?
they put cats (catmeat) in those buns...not that i have a problem with eating cats...but some people who may be squeamish, just a heads up
Are these Sichuan videos old? Trevor's Mandarin seems to be worse than recent vids...
Hello from Trinidad & Tobago Trevor. Keep up the good work
GREAT VIDEO, I WOULD LOVE TO COME OVER AND SPEND A COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH YOU. I'M A CHEF AND LIVED IN KOREA FOR 13 MONTHS AND IT WAS GREAT. I'M WORKING IN A RAMEN NOODLE SHOP AT THE PRESENT, JUST WONDERING HAVE YOU BEEN TO SINGAPORE I HEAR IT IS THE BOMB.
How do you manage to poop? You eat chillies like everyday but I mean how does it not burn all the time? I ate fresh chilies once and it was nasty going to the toilet,felt that I almost had instant hemorrhoids!
Was those last dishes hotter than that one dish that the bowl was IN the table?
Shokugeki no Soma?
very nice sir
It is supposed to be zì gòng, not zì gōng. The second sound means you gonna cut off your little buddy.
chilli 🌶 😻
Actually my hometown is ZiGong lol
how i wish you visit Yunnan a little bit earlier, it's mushroom season, locals love wild mushrooms. it's a little bit late, but try to find ji zong, niu gan jun, gan ba jun, they are local's top list.
OH ! I miss my hometown ZIgong SO MUCH.
Jiaaaaoooozi baaooooozi lol
Spicy
msg again! 😅
That blade noodle salad looks so good
Lots of chilies..love it
15:27
nee haaa
So what do you do with all the large plates of food? Do you eat all of it? Seems like a huge waste of good food if you don't!
This is a great video, I love the spicy. Keep up the good work.
😍😍you make it seem so easy.you eat everything and not hesitant to try out whatevers offered.. Some food you eat i just squint my eyes while watching bcause no matter how yumm it tastes or cooked i will never eat it especially with some of the food you eat like organs ,frogs etc like damm you must have great genes to handle that😂😂😂
Why do they put MSG in everything?
I only look at the people in the background... they are the best
so wonderful, so good, thank you so much
Have you eaten dog meat?
I KNEW YOU'D PICK LOTUS ROOT
what you are doing is so cool
Hi James. You getting fat!😂
Just one question. How do you use Facebook in China? I heard that is \nblocked there. :)
love from india trevis nice work come to india pls
hope u enjoy living and eating in China!Ur video is so amazing!
isnt it disrespecting ordering so much and only eating 5% of it ??\n\nI mean thats not america where customer is the king... lol\n\ndid u miss that part in your chinese studies ? this is like really derp
Just watching this and feels like my @$$ is going to fall out.
Please also start documenting where you stay and how you travel like Mark Wiens does.
Bhai Trevor, enough of China yaar. Why don't you show us that side of Canada (ur home) & US street tours. More than 70% of Ur vids are China.
Hi man, have you ever think about posting your video on to some China video website like Bilibili. I think many Chinese are willing to watch your videos.
Plz be here for Nepal too...we have got numerous delicious food!!! Excited to welcome you in the Land of Buddha and Everest.
Who won the 1 million subscriber giveaway? I gotta know it was me!
The camera work should receive an award for this video. It is outstanding.
Hi,Trever,I just happened to see your vedio on the weibo of Chinadaily,and started following U on youtube.:) Cannot wait to see ur new vedioes:D
Do you ever....finish your food? Seems such a waste
Why following the Pennywise look?
We have been watching you for so long, your part of our home. What a cool show.  Keep going to all those cool places so we can visit some day!
Trevor, have you made any videos where you go to a big city, like Shenzhen, and go into a nice restaurant? Not street food but in an upscale sit down restaurant.
my boy trevor getting a little thicc
your video are very short...and seldom too..not unlike before
I'm glad there is still real food somewhere and not the commercial factory produced food in the west concocted in the lab instead of a real kitchens as shown here.
well, I see a certain Trever put on some weights over the last few months ;)

When Food is too spicy it´s not fun. Eating should be fun and joy.
Just 2 days of net problem in my home, made me miss your videos so much
It's good that you rate how spicy the dishes are, can you do that for the rest of your videos plz?
I think it's not that spicy for me. coz I can't eat without chilli
I think ur fav place is china
Amazing! China is a place full of great things to explore with exotic foods to savour. Sichuan just makes it top notch.
oh look more sechuan cooking, yawn
...Just for one day to experience,  what you enjoy every day there!
Hello! This AiYe Chicken Feet is fake.The original named LiLin Supper(立玲夜宵).As locals of ZiGong I don't think that you've got the most famous food In ZiGong.

Wait until this vindictive a-hole decides to talk. Right now he's feeling like a lot of his allies have abandoned him. I think he's going  to expose alot of a-list perverts and prostitutes. For all we know he's probably got recordings as well.
This model rocks for wearing a wire and trying to catch him.  Way to go, Ambra!
I support you Harvey, who wouldnt go at daughter of Dario Argento when shes young.

Hollywood being a dark place where women can be sexually assaulted ....\n\nAnybody seeing the 'Beast and the Harlot' music video?
i had been raped by a old women 10 years ago.\n\nwomen False accusations movement without evidence.
At the end of the day Mr women respecter don't get no pussy. If you got money and status women will come around.
Is fame and getting movie and television positions worth these incidents with Harvey Weinstein?  Just like the Bible says, is gaining the world worth losing your own soul!  I think not!
Just as digusting is most of the commenters here, using a man's actions to fuel your political views or jew hating rhetorics.
Its also George Clooney, Ben Affleck, and many others.
The only person harvey weinstein would not touch is whoopie gold berg fro. the view
WHAT A DISGUSTING PIG! THE EMBODIMENT OF TOXIC MASCULINITY THAT POLLUTES OUR SOCIETY! MEN YOU MUST RESPECT WOMEN!

if he doesnt go to jail , then we will see the power of the money , if anyone of us do that , for sure we were on jail already.
Ewww. I guess he has to pay the karma debt by going to jail and get f*** by the Mexican mans

Harvey Weinstein
YOU'RE SO DEAD IN PRISON
Typical dirty jew
Stop sucking dick to get parts in Hollywood all of you ladies.
I want justice for the potted plant!
Liberal Hollywood is being Exposed 😈👿☻👻
I know I am going to get heat for saying this, but the fact that so many women stayed quiet rather than call out this predator is truly sad and upsetting. Their silence perpetuated his deviant behavior. In his sick mind, there wasn't anything wrong with it... Why? Because most of the women shrugged it off or were afraid of losing their career. What's more important, values and standing up for what's right or money and Fame? It seems for many the latter, smh.
But he looks so nice and sounds so nice. (Not about the creepy bit)
A perverted freak exposed and uprooted Praise the Lord
Harvey Weinstein? Hollywood?\nThis happens in every aspect of American business.\n\nThe gambling company IGT is just as corrupt and disgraceful.\nThey protect racists, deviants, con men and would defend paedo's if it made them a buck. \n\nPatti Hart, when she was the CEO of IGT, and former General Counsel Johnson, oversaw and concealed: \n1) The bribery of staff to lie to cover up management criminality \n2) The blackmailing of staff to cover up management criminality \n3) Non-disclosure of evidence in direct contravention of court orders\n4) Perverting the course of justice \n5) Forcing staff, by mandate, to commit perjury in court \n6) And other breaches of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act relating to some suspiciously odd adjudications by equally corrupt judges.
I just have a question...why now ladies ? Why not when it happened ? Or is it because you liked what he was doing to you ? You all went to bed with thim stop playing victims...
Who taped the conversation between he and the model?
Oh common people. He is not the only pig in the movie industry.
The year of the Weins. First Anthony w...../carlos danger/mr abedin. now HW....
I dont understand why did they wait so long to sue him and report those facts.
Hollywood seems to be full of very *strange* people , can you guess what group they belong too ? ..Here is a clue ' You can't talk about them '.
Desperately pleading is NOT what Weinstein was doing, you jackasses. We can assume that headline was written by a man.
Hollywood has always had this kinda rep, this isnt anything new.. Why do young people keep trying to knock down the doors to get into a corrupt and perverted industry??  What do you expect??
Nothing will happen to him because he's a Jew and Jews run Hollywood
After we had a mutually agreed rough and an extremely perverted bukake, anal, foot fetish, food fetish, hentai - like, fisting, footing or feeting, he stood up, looked at me with his devilish eyes and said: \nCan you massage my shoulders, please! \nIt was terrible, massaging that grizzly bear. That massage request was very offensive and hard for me.\n(it's a joke!)\nImprison that hungry perv!
Isn't that that fabian guy from channel one?
Well, you gotta admit -- he had good taste in women.  Only the best...
No arrests made.....JOO pigs covering JOO pigs !!!
Who the hell would watch some old fat dude take a shower? Lol
execute harvey for his crimes
So gross. Has some fetish with being watched taking a shower and beating it. Very weird the way he begs for it. Smh.
So now it seems clear to me that any so called actress who was in his films has revealed themselves to be a PROSTITUTE No MAN would ever sleep with a fat ugly woman no matter how rich or powerful but women on the other hand......
He made all this people rich
Can he even find his penis beneath that belly?
Grab her by the pussy.
Maybe he''ll be having a shower with big bubba someday soon.
Weinstein is a sexual predator but the ALMIGHTY HOLLYWOOD protects him and their fellow sexual deviants goyim.\n\nThey thought the Satanic Cult is just a crazy Christian Conspiracy. But this is a hard evidence that several A-listers accused him now.
Don't ruin your friendship with me over five minutes... How simultaneously sad and needy, disgusting and manipulative.
No one should be surprised at what the culture of permissiveness and near naked women and power created. It is also no wonder at the more than 100,000 rapes in this country due to the bombardment of everything having to be sexy.  Virtually everything in the movie industry has an element of sex thrown in and giving something a PG-13 rating will not stop young viewers. Make the ratings and warnings much stronger. God, family and country.
Throw the book at this pervert.
THAT demanding insolent voice is THE DEMON Thats ON HIM TALKING! One demon on him -opens door for lots more. HarveyW IS TOTALLY OVERRUN WITH DEMONS. This guys lord is SATAN. AND NOW satan IS DONE WITH HIM. Devil COMES TO STEAL KILL AND DESTROY! 👎💩👎💩👎
When women singers like the one who used to be Hannah Montana sexually harrasing males none bat and eye, but when a Male do same thing, all of you start complaining about it like a bunch of little kids.
How's the power over women goin Harvey? How's it going?
Yet you all support Hollywood from Woody Allen barely legal adopted Korean daughter to Michael Jackson molesting young boys.  Corey Feldman so messed up (some kind of victim syndrome).  Even Bill Clinton molesting interns as govenor to President.  You all gawk at celebrities as role models?  Why now with McGowen?
No woman is going to have sex with that ugly mug on purpose unless she is blind!
Disgusting Hollywood kike. Deserves to be removed from this planet
If the devil had a voice, his is what it would sound like
What a disgusting deranged jew
look at that, I cant blame him for trying ;)

A few flat earthers die of heart ache after each spacex video :)
wow Echostar 105? I worked at the company way back when they launched Echostar VI and VII.
elon is actually a Martian just trying to get back home. :(
I love the drone ship names...\nOf Course I Still Love You\nJust Read the Instructions
Gotta love the names of the stations “of course I still love you” and “just read the instructions” or something like it. Makes me giggle.
thanks for building the future
I dont understand how people think we can colonize mars soon when we only been to the moon a few times and alls we did was collect rocks
Wow! Kerbal Space Program has great graphics since the last updatr
Can I suggest that when you make your rocket to mars that you create a component called The Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator?
Like 2 more Elons and we'll be set.
Great work! Congrats to the whole team at SpaceX.
Steady for a while at max speed at around 8000 kph. With this speed, we can reach Mars in 2.85 years. Not that long...and worth to wait
The technology and equipment are good...
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Why is it on fire prelaunch? What was it doing?
the real one crashed they switched cams to the other barge with the prop.
Why don't you ever show a launch from the camera of a satellite or satellites? So we could see the whole operation   of launching to landing.
SpaceX makes NASA look like the overpaid old timers afraid of change they are.
ArianeSpace and ULA are toast! \nSpaceX ate their lunch with Falcon 9. It's a very successful launch technology and SpaceX is already leaving it behind. \nNow Elon will show up the SLS with BFR! \nI cannot wait to see those things coming out of the sky and landing on a launch pad.
This is not Russia vs America... This humanity vs extinction  ... We are all brothers and sisters... Indian guy here going I could be a part of space x some day... :D
The Russians are known for their secrecy.
Reusing rockets: what's the big deal - I do it on Kerbal all time, and with a real short turn around time: you say this is not the same thing???? ;) Congrats Elon - and people say: What can one person do? Well how about changing the whole world and much for the better?
2017 and Space companies are still using potatoes to record :/
Anyone wanna explain the space-blizzard at 41:00?
13:49 t- 10
WoW was this fastest re-entry  ? Fins glowing white and plasma show up..... WoW
what if it flies over north korea and they get the wrong idea
what the hell is that camera doing ? seriously? you send rocket to space and you cant tilt the camera steadily?
Point of order!!!! You are not launching from Cape Canaveral. KSC is technically on Merritt Island. ;-)
İ Choice The Blue Pill   Morpheus  Musk !!
Subtitles seem to be about 11 minutes behind the audio(!)
SpaceX  you need a concert like TOMITA Live at Linz in Austria 2 as you send off  :)
Its weird that Tesla cars actually accelerate faster, if you compare them side by side. The rocket just keeps going. I imagine the time when we will launch stuff to space from huge magnetic cannons, made out of hyperloops that then ignite while already hundreds of meters above ground and going just a little under speed of sound already. Could save alot of liftoff fuel payload.
Every time Tom (the host) comes on and says he is a Firmware engineer all i here is, I am a Former Engineer and my first thought is WHY ARE YOU HOSTING THEN!?
Saw it from my back yard, 168mi south of the Cape. Awesome!
It's really wonderful. When I'm watching when this rocket is returning from space and landing, I feel like I'm watching the next chapter in space exploration. Congratulations to SpaceX. Elon Musk, I do not think you have time to read the comments, but you know how to inspire people.
How I love these starts.. more please! Also: Mars! I hope once the crew is on it's way there are daily videos of how things going - will watch it! Nothing boring in pushing the boundaries of mankind :)
You are the best
I recently flew on a 4 engine 747... can't imagine 20 engine's and how I would possibly survive, LOL!!!
I can understand camera getting screwed on re-entry, but surely the barge camera can have better than potato quality/connection. Still, awesome work. Look forward to much more and oneday seeing 31 raptor engines firing in all their glory.
Its so complicated to do, yet this video makes it look so easy.  Musk is a force of progress.
Elon Musk is the greatest foreigner to come to America since the time of Nikola Tesla. Bravo Mr. Musk.\nWish you lots of luck on your endeavors.\nIf you take advantage of everything America has to offer there's nothing you can't accomplish- Geraldine Ferraro
if they develop this rocket any further they might just go to the moon some day!
i cannot wait for the BFR
It's a bit strange that it cut out on the landing.
@23:40 In space, they play techno.
Watched it live couldn't comment at time shame visuals were lost of rocket landing but seen most of its journey well done
All bow down to Elon Musk our savior. What I would give to work with him....He will save the world.
Best\nName \nFor\nA\nDroneship
I just love SpaceX! What an extraordinary gang! They just do it :D.\nWould have been nice to see some telemetry data from the 2nd stage during its long flight.\nBut a great presentation anyway. I love watching these launches!
Is it just me or did they attach new cameras, way better quality this time around
I would like to see G forces too in the telemetry section. Would be a nice thing to visualize acceleration.\n\nThumbs up if you want it too! :D
This should shut thunderf00t

Super décollage, bravo à vous.
@spacex is that the first stage landing at 22:12 on the left side one the screen?
What is on the horizon at 22:12? It looks like a nuke detonation.
Why is the drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You?
every day seems they send something up...the elite moving out?
Thanks for a very interesting and informative video. \n\nI am curious.. After the satellite has been released, what do you do with the part of the rocket, carrying the satellite? Do you fly it back into the earth' atmosphere, so it burns up and falls into the ocean or that happens with it? \n\nIf that is the case, how much is left when it hits the water. Are we talking parts of a few centimeters or more?\n\nKeep up the good work. I love what you are doing to the world.
I bore my other half to tears alot of the time when I talk about Elon Musk and the whole Space X operation... Not to mention those phenomenally stunning Tesla vehicles. He is a true visionary willing to risk his own wealth for mankind to step foot and even reside on Mars... Obviously it would mean a stupendous amount of wealth WHEN it succeeds. Would love to sit and have a coffee and chat with Elon. I admire his focus and drive on getting us to the red planet. I'm 99.999% sure Space X will get the first structure on Mars ahead of NASA.
others can gripe but SpaceX is showing the way forward efficient to the point of 2 launches in 3 days 2 returns in 3 days multiple satellites launched without drama, they are a trucking company doing what they do best, and by developing their own equipment they control quality, remember the plan for BFR is the equivalent of launching a decent sized 4000 ton ship into orbit and reusing it as well multiple times, we really are at a crossroads
weird looking rocket. lot of fancy paintings but still less than half as good as Russian rockets which take off so beautifully, very safe and reliable, unlike this american junk. here's how a rocket should take off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzsRjru86s
@43:40 can somebody please explain why the speed of second stage is decreasing? Shouldn't it remain constant?
Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\n\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\n\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.
I wish they would display m/s instead of km/h
SpaceX should send a new rocket to space everyday

Lots of space junk visible on the left camera as the 1st stage is prepping for return to earth. That's going to be a problem pretty soon I would say.
Why did they land on the barge instead of land?  I thought land was preferable now that it has been figured out
Excuse me, I've got a question (and maybe a stupid one, because I don't know what could be the answer). Instead of focusing and spending so much money on reaching Mars, wouldn't be better to focus on asteroid mining technology? I think that once that we will be capabel to gain materials in the space, we will be able to build our rockets directly in space, so that the ammount of fuel needed will be much less becouse we will have no more to escape our gravity.\nHope that someone could clarify me that point.
Where does the second stage end up going? Does it just drift endlessly now?
***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!! Shouldn't have a continuos movement as there is no friction!?  Thanks to all for answer
What's the nuclear bomb looking thing in the background at 22:12
The most amazing transportation vehicle and its formed like a penis

is there anything in your rockets with batteries? like the most normal AA batteries. it'd be so hilarious...\nlike Energiser, the Most Space Batteries Ever Made (Elon Musk award) and stuff.\noh the agony of my normal side.
20:59 Damn is this plasma ?? Good thing the first stage survived reentry

imho the test shouldn't give instant feedback, to be academically clean (unless it measures other things too). Anyway, what happened to alternatives like OGG Vorbis, and I am sure there were others since?
Question:\n\nAre not sample rate and bit resolution stuff that affects signal processing when/where you are recording and mixing totally inside the box?
Meanwhile, some people are prepared to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars on gilded wires for their speakers and (sic!) gilded Ethernet connectors for higher connection speed. Some people just have more money than sense.
I'm actually surprised Rick presents the results of that test the way he did. Literally, she was right by a *majority.* It seems really clear to me that there is *some* amount of audible difference. It's also of course legitimate for him to put out his music how he wants, certainly 320 mb/s mp3's are great quality. But he's also insisting on something that his own test proved is incorrect. 🙄
All three of these digital formats sound VASTLY better than vinyl records. I've been a recording engineer since the late 60s and I couldn't wait for vinyl to die the horrid death that it deserved, now those stupid things are back! Way too many compromises had to be made in the mastering step and I never released a vinyl album that sounded like I intended for it to sound. Don't get me started on ticks, pops, rumble, and surface noise...
i did the same score as her, with 1 % of her ability musically.
I think it doesn't matter if you can really tell the difference or not. Storage is so cheap and plentiful nowadays that it's probably just worth it to get flac/uncompressed wav files just to have the peace of mind that you aren't missing anything. Maybe it does sound better maybe it doesn't but if you want to have the best audio experience you might as well get as faithful of a digital file you can.
depends a lot on your hardware you are playing it on and your familiarity with the track.  It can make a difference to some people.  Listening to random pop music in a test is only proving that at first glance the formats seem the same.  Run that same test with some Shure SE535 or even 425's on a decent sound card doing a raw decode, and see if test score changes.  Audio Technica on a PC is alright for casual listening, but you can't expect to differentiate those tracks with that hardware.
This is probably hardest audiophile test  on Mp3 vs WAV / FLAC - as I totally agree with you that the good quality mp3 sound as good as WAVs - but could you use bit higher-end Headphones for such a test? I am honestly surprised that Michelle got 4 answers right with such HPs. Good video though!
High sample rate (above 44.1) and high bit depth (above 16) increase editing accuracy. Like taming actual cathedral reverb tails from a choir. Or for easy locking to video frame rates. You are a complete fool to think you can hear the dif between high sample rates and 32 bit audio when it comes to mastered mixes. (I'll concede some sense dynamic range I don't and have gear I don't always have access to so 24 bit is real-ish.) Perhaps that oxygen free cable you got suckered into buying has affected the oxygen reaching your logic center. I actually think the bass has way less punch and stereo imaging starts to suck in low rate MP3's.
Katie Perry and Coldplay are mastered w/ compression and sound great at 128kps.  Piano and obsessive guitar tone shine without compression.  4/6 is good enuff evidence.  Maybe just being a young, condescending whippersnapper
Hello everyone.  I applaud this video but I can definitely hear the difference.  I believe I could always hear a difference.  I cannot tell which is the better quality however because there are many factors. When down-encoding some aspect of the sound may be amplified or altered and depending on the listener that might sound better to the person for example if the bass is enhanced or some other aspect such as the strings stand out more or human voice S sounds are less jarring and many factors.  I took the test with these results: 320 320 128 320 320 320 which is 100% wrong!  By the 2nd song I was happy not to be selecting the 128K although I picked it out one time.  To me it seemed the WAV version was the most muted sounding and the least remarkable. There are two other ways to take this test and one is to try to pick out the 128K which is supposed to be inferior and the other is to try and guess all 3.  In this way it's like taking the test with twice the data (not 3x since you're deducing at least one of the 3 choices).  Were my results as good as random?  You tell me.  Note that each are different types of songs and the same encoding algorithm could result in different areas of the sound being enhanced or otherwise altered.  I had the hardest time picking out the differences in the classical one with piano.  I don't think it matters if the listener is young and can hear higher frequencies or if the person has perfect pitch, I don't think being able to hear the differences is tied to those although it might help, it could just be the number of neural connections being used in that part of the brain(?)  I don't think you need high end equipment either but I'm sure it will help make the differences more discernible, I used bluetooth headset for part of the test and later just the television.  Asking which is the best probably is less meaningful versus asking can you discern compression artifacts?
you are the greenest dude I have ever seen ,-)
You asked her at first which sounded best not which sounded like it had the highest data rate. She probably knew what you meant, but I'd still throw out the first attempt because she hadn't had anything to compare the samples to yet. I'd say she got 4/5, and then the last one she somehow got wrong even though she guessed the crappy mp3 version which she definitely should have been able to tell was not correct. She said she liked the song, so maybe she was used to listening to a crappy version. Regardless, out of 5, you'd expect her to get 1.67, and she got 4. So it sounds like it is definitely possible to tell the difference if you were worried about that sort of thing.
31 Years old and just tested my hearing range.... I can hear16k but can't hear 16.5k or above, is that normal? \n\nand while i'm at it I can't hear 22hz or below either.\n\nEdit: i have a headache now.... :-/ (coming from someone who gets like 1 headache a year)
The only time I was actually able to tell the difference was when I canceled my Qobuz streaming abonnement (CD quality) after 2 years, to come back on Spotify (320kbps). It took me a few days where I really felt like I lost something in the sound, mostly on acoustic or non-saturated music, before I got used to it. After a year of lower quality now, I wouldn't make a bet on being able to tell the difference with certitude.
The main advantage to the WAV format is when converting to other formats MP3's can leave artifacts. Also adding sound FX or slowing down the recording instantly reveals the poor quality of MP3. Same with trying to clear up background noise with software, it works much better with WAV. Admittedly, the WAV advantage is mostly in manipulating the recording. For just listening to music 320 bit MP3 is fine, even 244 (I can't tell a difference) however at 128 bit, I can hear a big difference on songs that have a lot of cymbals: they will have a warbly under water sound. Also something else to consider, listening to 128 bit MP3 at loud volume for for a few hours may fatigue the ears faster (I have no proof of this). But consider the notoriously ear tiring Metallica album Death Magnetic. Even hardcore Metallica fans have complained about the brutally painful way that album was mixed. I crank it up and 4 songs later my ears have a mild ring and I feel a headache coming on and have to turn it off. So it might be possible that low bit MP3'S do the same to some degree, though I doubt hi bit MP3'S would have that effect.
I have engineering at electronics and singals and I can tell you that MP3 was obsolete 20 year ago. And With 44 kHz sampling you get like 5% Total harmonic distortion already at like 15 kHz ....
i can definitely tell the difference between a song downloaded from youtube after its compression compared to a cd. but ive never really noticed a difference between a song in daw vs after its been exported to mp3 320kb/s
The most sensible explanation I’ve heard in a long time. I’m 52 and have been listening since I was 16 with the first system I purchased back then. It is always is the mix like you said whether they can hear super high or not, it is a gift to make a recording blend right! I just laugh anymore that people post in these forums that they can really hear such great differences in 44k and 96 or 192... and if you can then sit down and take a shot like the gal did here and prove it. :-)
Dear Rick, the test would have been more trustworthy if you had chosen highly complex orchestral music (inc the applause) and try listening through good headphones and not through a 'pc out'. Thanks
Um... you realise you're listening to a streamed, chrome eq'd wav file right? Try through a DAC and it's night and day.
Meh, I got 4 out of 6 too. Also I am a professional drummer, with damaged hearing for sure, and I don't have perfect pitch. (Actually, not sure what the heck that has to do with this anyways). I could hear the difference. Hardest one is the vocal only one, because it doesn't have a huge dynamic range.
Very good video! Loved the quiz too. Could hear 1/6 only on speakers, 3/6 on my (cheap) Bose computer speakers (100 euro pair). The differences were between 320 and the WAV files. 320 kbs files are perfect.
Hearing comes with experience, if you dont know what to listen for then you just feeling it as a human being by pure intuition. In other words most people feeling the music but cant put specific words on it. An Experienced engineers can see what behind the matrix and see how the universe works so he can create the sounds to make you feel a certain way. And that is how it works we create the world for the new generation who will hear things for the first time, because we ourselves was a virgin at a point.
What we really want to know is will you be releasing your new album on Edison Wax Cylinder?
where is sleepy eyes come from?
I got someone to test me and anything above 192kbps was more or less guess work. More to the point, I played them back on an 7k HI-FI so this made my job easier, and it did show up the differences. Saying that some old 128kbps files were better than their higher kbps counterparts but this depended on what recording or pressing they were taken from so it's not always the compression rate that's to blame. I've got two pressings on CD of 'Thriller' and they are world's apart in terms of quality. I could take the great pressing and convert them to 128's and they'll sound so much better than the .wav files of the crappy CD! \nSo many variables in this experiment. \nMy girlfriend can't hear any difference in any file and can't tell the difference between BluRay and SD so I guess we're lucky!
I think you did a bit of moving the goalposts... you started the argument with 'audiophiles can't hear the difference' and then argued that it didn't matter that they could hear the difference.
In the end... wouldn't it be easier to say that each of us has a different hearing capability whatever the age and that each of us likes such or such music that has its own specificity? If yes, then each each of us should test and select which format makes him/her happy and that's it. With today's computing power, formats availability and low cost storage, I don't see any limitation to enable anyone to choose.
maybe the mix from all these old geezers is why pop music sucks..... lol
I did the test with some crappy angry birds mini speaker and got 4 out of 6 but some were more luck, the real thing is I could differentiate more between 128 kbps and 320 kbps than between 320 kbps and uncompressed. \n\nStill I'd have to re take the test with a good pair of headphones which I don't have currently haha but it's true the difference is minimal although when I downloaded and listened to FLAC files compared to mp3 the world changes.
You’re right about this too! As well as the apple rant
I’m pretty sure I can tell the difference between an mp3 file and uncompressed wav... by listening to cymbals... the way they sustain is obvious
This can also depends on the soundcard of the computer, and on the player you are using! (i would especialy not trust an online player) A neutral curved (monitoring) headset is required in order to get convincing results, and well... not a headset actually but a good loudspeaker would be better. And at last you need to get several people pass the same test! \nAnd i'm not saying that as an audiophile but as a scientist... You need to make sure that your conclusion is really about the human ear and not about the audio material you are using for this experiment.
Anybody who makes music should ace this
Only able to identify 4 out of 6? That's decent.  I did this test and got 5 out of 6.  320kps is close but if I listen to records recording intimate acoustic instruments especially, I can absolutely hear the difference.  Why not use the best quality you can?  Sure, if I am making a punk rock record, I just care about the mid range.  But quality matters.  What's the point of using an mp3 at this point?  Storage is so cheap and internet speeds are at an all time high.\n\nYou are right about the 4k.notch though. I am 15 to 20db down there at 33 years of age. I need to slow it down.
Weĺl done. The thing with audiophiles is that they are usually obsessed with cables and gear and not so much with good music. Somewhere on earth a producer used pure functional stuff to record an album, gear that would give audiophiles a heart attack. And then they start playing it on a record through a 'warm' tube amp. Post-Coloring everywhere. Others like colder high pitched coloring and in reality it doesnt matter how you play it as long as you can enjoy it. It's their search for a personal nirvana similar to recalibrating a TV to get more satisfying personal  colors. Like gamers who hookup their tv's to old black and white screens because it creates a new dimension or something. People like these don't seem to enjoy music / films / games anymore. They enjoy their brand x amplfier for whatever reason. And if people reach that point in which gear becomes like a glass of wine... it's time for them to take a long holiday.
I'd be more interested in the whole musical 'picture'. Pitch only seems a very limited approach. Furthermore I like more and attitude of inquiring instead of making a statement. And you can't deny the subjectivity of the matter.
You're talking nonsense; I reserve the right to spend 1000 dollars on speaker wire, thank you very much...
Right now I want to go back to listen to what I'm into now when I'm 9 that would be cool.
also she a had 33.3% chance of guessing the high quality file.
I just took that quiz before they transitioned to her taking and, without an amp, I got 4 out of 6 right. All the Katy Perry samples sounded exactly the same, but you can parse it out better on all the remasters
I can tell the difference between lossless format and mp3.\nLossless format treble sound so much crisp, sharp,clear and details. the soundstage also sounded much wider&live than mp3. listening on my nw zx100 Walkman player and xba 300 sony iem. Lossless format + Good player + good headphones = high quality sound experience.
I had a hearing test at work last year in the little van that they pull into the  parking lot and cycle us through like cattle. While sitting in the little booth, I could see the reflection of the small laptop that was actually running the test. I noticed that when I could hear the tone, a red bar popped up on the monitor. It went off when the tone stopped. So I just pushed the button on the pickle when I saw the red bar and ignored the actual audio. I got my results and of course it was perfect. I was hearing things only dogs can hear! Like tones in the 18k range. This year I took it and just did it the old fashioned way, and the results were piss poor. But the funny part was the letter accompanying the results telling me that I have suffered dramatic hearing loss and I should see a hearing specialist
Great video, as always! :)
woooahhhhahahhahhhoooaaaawww hold on a second there buddy, let me tell you (before I've watched the full video) that I've compared a 320kbp/s mp3 of my own recorded track side by side against the lossless Wav version and the difference I hear through my beyerdynamic DT150's is that the mp3 has some softening around the edges giving off a very slightly yet noticable dullness to the high end. The Wav version has more clarity. Also it's going to be very difficult to prove your point through a youtube video when that itself is a compressed format, even on a hd setting because otherwise we'd have to somehow stream a 50GB+ file in lossless over the internet which just isn't going to be happening.\n\n*Back to watching video*\n\ncontinued: Alright so I'm seeing how you're testing which is cool, the website seems to test Which one sounds the worst Which for certain genres is easier to tell than others, I feel the recording methods play a role in this too though. For each one I could pick out the worst sounding but between 320 and wav was pretty damn difficult. I will say however people are a sucker for quality and when you know digitally recorded sound which is then compressed doesn't give you a perfectly smooth transition from fin to fin on your waveform you'd much rather resort to analog specifically for this, which you defeinitely can tell the difference on. Digital amp or tube? Tube usually wins hands down too so while we strive for the best quality we can get, digital can do just as good a job while also emulating the analog warmth and smoothness but if we know for sure then we'd choose the more authentic version which I believe this boils down to in the end. Authenticity over a compressed piece of trash, even if we can't really tell the difference ;)
I am so glad to hear your opinion on this...  I've never considered myself an audiophile.  I've never needed to have that recliner sitting exactly in the middle of the room with the best speakers in the perfect orientation, etc.  I have never been a professional musician, but I've been actively around music for 45 of my 48 years, and I do think I have a good ear for what sounds good, and what is a well produced recording.  I tend to be able to pick out and appreciate instruments that are deep in the mix and add to the rhythmic complexity or harmony in a song, and am constantly saying to my wife Dont you hear that <whatever> doing those 8th note triplets softly in the background? That's what makes this song so cool to me..   to which she ALWAYS says I was paying attention to the lyrics..  :-)  I notice noise gates kicking in and out, I notice harmonizers and auto-tuned tracks, and other things like that, but GENERALLY dont know or care what sampling frequency or bit depth something has been converted to.  The ONE exception that has been bothering me recently, which I would LOVE to hear your comments on, is SIrius/XM.  I have noticed recently, especially on their special/temporary Billy Joel channel, that it seems the allocated bandwidth is SO BAD that it sounds worse than an old cassette recording, even on stuff I KNOW was studio recorded DDD.  I've been wondering if anyone else has been thinking SXM is perhaps trying to stretch their bandwidth across too many available channels these days??   On a semi-related note.. I still remember the first time I heard Dire Straits Brothers in Arms CD.  I think that was the first DDD CD I had ever heard, and to this day, it's my go to when I want to hear how a system sounds.  So well produced and noise free!
Where you can really tell the difference is the low-level information as notes reach the end of their decay (such as is the case with reverb ring off).  Data compression on soft passages is completely obvious.  While this is moot point for most popular music, I imagine that most audiophiles concern themselves more with classical, jazz, world music, folk, etc. that has a much broader dynamic range.
Whether you can hear a difference or not, people should keep in mind that if the difference has reached a  conscious awareness to the point where you can actually pinpoint things like cymbals sounding different, the difference in the ineffable or unnoticed factors must be HUGE. It's not as if music - or any other enjoyable experience, for that matter - is composed of merely these easily identifiable and noticeable aspects. Listening to a little clip and just trying to pick out some difference is pretty far from a test that makes any sense if what you care about is the full lush experience.
I love this
Please stop comparing sample rate with bit rate, otherwise great video.
well, if I request download tracks in 24bit 44.1khz, it's simply for DAW compability. I had a freeware DAW once, which enabled me to only record and export in 32bit floating point. My phone couldn't handle those files porperly, so that's why I prefer 24, 44.1, it just works.
No one uses CD players any more? I guess I'm a dinosaur.
Coincidence or not, the song she said she loved, she got wrong! probably because she was playing more atention to her memories than the song itself...\nThe things I have against MP3 is that some audible artifacts remain even at 320kb/s and it doesn't have native gapless playback, that is the reason I use opus at 200kb/s\nI can't tell the difference between a 128kb/s opus and the uncompressed WAV, I use 200kb/s just to be on the safe side\nnewer lossy format have noise-like compression artifacts, so even at sub-90k bit rates it can be pleasurable to listen to... if you enjoy music more than the specs of your system, of course
Hearing and listening is not the same thing.
i remember electro harmonix 2880 looper rendered recordings wavs and I thought ok I'll convert all my saves to mp3, 100+ 10 minute x4 loops takes a lot of space. I was scolded for it, by a friend who claimed i'd ruined the lot including some of his work. I just converted his loops back to wav and claimed I had kept them aside but had forgotten about it. He didn't notice any deterioration of sound at all, so yeah Rick's post resonates with me.
it's not about kHz, it's about artifacts in the sound. Even watching this video in youtube, i got 4 out of 6 too
People should shut the fuck up, if they don't have a clue of what they are talking about. The difference between compressed and lossles audio is huge, everyone with decent gear knows that.  Only someone who has never heard a lossles file on adecent gear would ever say that mp3 is enough. \nNnot to mention people generally agree that 44,1khz is not fast enough, for the cd to obtain anywhere near the sound quality that a master tape or a vinyl has. \nOr do you also think that any device capable of 44,1khz will sound the same aswell?
Perfect pitch does not enable someone to hear difference in audio quality.
What's the name of the track at the end?
I would like to see a version of this test where you arrange the samples based on your perception of which is the best, second best etc. That would be interesting...\n\nThat would show better if there's any difference between them.
Thanks for a great post Rick. I just happened to be testing my own hearing 2 hours ago after a day of tracking guitars. I'm 53 and I can comfortably hear up to 13.5K then it gradually drops off. 15.5k needs a 15 db boost but I can hear it as the cat dives for cover. What is this 4k notch you mentioned?
In Photography, It's important to shoot in RAW format, because RAW format records more info about the captured image, in the dark, and in the bright parts. But photographers deliver compressed JPEG images, the RAW format are only helpful during post-processing. I think it's somehow the same with Audio recording.
I don't know if I'm missing something of the discussion by Rick (which I always appreciate and follow), in this case, sorry. It seems to me that we are not talking about WHAT GEAR you are using to play the music. It's out of question that with a cheap computer playing the music you are not gonna hear differencies between different audio formats. I'm surprised the girl succeded in telling the right ones 4 out of 6. But if you have a correct hi fi system (which by no means it is a cheap computer!), you're gonna hear the differencies more more clearly because a good hi fi system enhances the differences like a microscope. I'm talking about CD reproduction (and of course vynil, but we're talking about digital files here). With my system without any difficulty I can tell the differences between different editions of the same music in cd format, ... and an MP3 file would sound terrible compared to an original CD audio file. It's out of question, I made this experiment several times. Even a semi deaf man could tell the difference, my Dad in his seventies clearly tells the differencies and recognize quality files from the less quality ones. Thanks
I agree with all of the points made in this presentation.
Great video! Comparison tests are extremely difficult, since we'll mix the information of the different files with each other. Differences will become bigger over longer time.
This is not very accurate. The girl doesn't have a clue what an audiophile listens for. And the Yamahas are used for checking the balancing between the instruments and to give an idea how the recording will sound on a more common (crappy) stereo equipment. This is how commercial record industry produces records. They ought to have used well produced jazz recordings instead. There's no compromises on those recordings. This is just a fraction of what's wrong with the industry.
I think we should still consider frequencies outside of our hearing ability range because it's not only our ears that responds to frequencies. Our entire body does.
Of course the right answer in the listening test is the one that takes longer to load!
i also got 4/6 right but i REALLY had to listen closely like i never did before XD i took the test with Beyerdynamic DT-990 Pro and it was HARD i would say for average listeners 128k mp3 is totally fine
Great video, but for me, NOTHING sounds better than a CD or LP, specially when you´re holding the booklet/cover, reading the lyrics and watching the photos or the art. (I think I´m in the audio-fooled category, hahaha).
I've been recording my latest releases purposely in 16bit 44khz.  I find it easier and more comfortable to mix. Than 48khz 24bit.   And it goes down to MP3 formats fairly easily.  Sounds fine.  This could also be just in my head.
Fun fact : youtube's sound quality is 192kbs-mp3 and people are typically completely fine with that
What's your take on Roger Nicoles?
Unpayable information! Thanks for this video.
Finally someone saying it in a forwardable video.
The Yamaha NX 10 has a frequency range from 60Hz - 20Khz, 60 Hz is really not deep enough for mixing, the deepest Note a normal E-Bass can play (E) is about 40 Hz.
This video is another reminder that bits & data are for the machines people...the machines..
First, I still listen to CD. Second, people who care enough can hear the difference between CD and mp3.
I agree with everything said in this video (especially regarding the quality of 320kb/s MP3), however MP3/AAC is not an archival format. When I purchase music, I want it in a future-proof format that can be transcoded without causing further harm to the audio. For that reason, please consider offering your music in lossless formats such as FLAC or WAV.
Do frequencies that you can't hear still interact with frequencies that you can hear? So even though a person can't hear above 14k is it necessary to expose the ear to the entire frequency range in case the inaudible frequencies impact what you can hear?
Can you hear the difference between a vinyl record and an mp3?
Can't tell if the following applies to her, but I've noticed that frequencies above like 10 kHz become drastically more difficult to hear when my hair is stuck between my ears and headphones!
I did the test, got 2/6 (although I did misclick one of them), which really just suggests I performed no better than randomly picking. Weirdly, I normally picked the 128 file over the 320 file.\n\nMy earphones aren't the greatest, but given I use these for casual music listening that really doesn't matter too much.
This was my first time trying something like this, I've always listened to mp3s and have never been dissatisfied; people who claimed to only listen to high quality audio seemed pretentious to me, but I suppose it's worth it to investigate. Thanks for making this video. \n\nI took the test multiple times and found I was able to get the Jay-Z and Katy Perry songs almost every time; I could hear the difference in the sub-bass. The other ones I missed almost every time. \n\nIf mp3 works as you described, cutting inaudible/nearly inaudible frequencies above and below the human hearing spectrum, then shouldn't only certain instruments be affected? I feel like the human voice one would lose the least when compressed, cause the voice literally evolved to be heard by the human ear; there isn't much to be cut, is there?\n\nMaybe DJs ought to use uncompressed audio to get a little bit more top and bottom out of big sound systems. Seems like classical or acoustic music wouldn't really benefit from being uncompressed, but these are just guesses.
Another brilliant, insightful and helpful video. Thanks for dispelling the myths, Rick! Love it!
hey thanks thats cool
Best explanation ever!
Hello Michelle, notice me senpai!
Subscribing!!!
Flawed test
Surprisingly, I earned 4/6.
Useless!
I'm sorry.. I'm an audiophile and I've been all about music quality for as long as I can remember. I can say yes, I can tell the difference in quality. With good headphones, the difference between WAV and mp3 are noticeable when you listen for it. The difference I hear is that the high ends get washed out and there is dramatically less bass. Also, with the mp3 file, there is far less spread; It sounds narrow. Hearing for the spread is kinda the only way to hear any difference between 320kpbs and WAV.
It is an interesting video, however there are a few flaws with your logic. Firstly from a technical standpoint, there is a measurable difference. You can subtract the output from the MP3 file from the WAV and have a file that contains the 'differences'. Play this file you'll here quite audible stuff. Certain things like string sections and cymbals do not compress welll you'll hear the echoes of those. So there is a tangible difference especiallly to people who know what to listen to. Secondly, from a business perspective just because someone else can't tell the difference in quality shouldn't mean I deserve worse quality? Apply that logic to a restaurant or any other business. Finally, the problem with the test is that modern music is now created to compress well and is therefore harder to spot compression. This was not previously a constraint, so depending on the listener you need to restrict the content of the test to pre/post MP3/download era music.
You know this proof is rock solid with that MASSIVE sample size
you are making this up as you go along and you look like a fool.. if you cant hear the quality differences with compression you probably should learn to accept your perception is blunt and stay out of the debate.. Mike Shipley used to say he could hear the difference between a gold and standard audio cable.. I cant hear that at all but then I cant pull a mix as good as Mike used to so I shut up and accept he has something I don't have.. instead of making noise on youtube and looking like an ignoramus..
Just to be clear, you're doing the test on $50 headphones? Get some Audeze LCD-X & try again ;)
You are comparing the data bit rate (320 kb/s) to a sampling frequency (44.1 KHz).  These are different things.
Okay then, the movement in this game looks super cool.
You can hit the bombs back at the Broodal when she's dropping bombs everywhere. It won't knock her hat off but it will end the phase sooner.
ONLY. TWO. WEEKS.
They should just give you a free copy
Oh shit watching these demo speedruns are my new favorite thing now
I can tell this was at target from the walkie noise
Awesome speed run! The hat throw is going to be really broken!
You wasted so much time waiting for the Broodal to finish her UFO phase. If you throw Cappy at one of the bombs she drops, it will hit her and knock her out of the sky, ending the phase like 5 seconds earlier.
Well done... can't imagine what you'll accomplish with the final game.
I love learning how to master how Mario controls in 3D Mario games and watching this speedrun only made me more excited to play Odyssey.
Holy shit\nThere is already a speed run of this game
In Super Mario 64 we had long jump spamming. In Super Mario Sunshine we had dive spamming. Now in Super Mario Odyssey we have rolling spamming. History repeats itself.
My target had the demo, and when I started it, the TV was at like max volume or something. Mario yelled “SUPA MARIO ODISEE” on it, and everyone within 30 feet of me stopped and stared at me
When you're an expert at a game that hasn't even come out yet.
i love how mario is sonic now
This was from the Gamecity in Vienna right?
Jesus, the game isn't even released yet.
He was born here
The speed-running potential for this game is insane and it’s not even out yet
Make an eshop demo Nintendo!
From power stars to power moons, cool.
I'm getting some serious Galaxy vibes from the gravity section in the pyramid. I don't have any clue why.
Wow how often did you play this demo?
3:35 THAT MOVEMENT THO
0:21 Mario jumping Trump's wall.
My target has no demo ;(
I already like how this Mario handles much more than in galaxy or any recent Mario games. He seems like he's more like 64 or sunshine Mario that was a lot quicker, and the dive is back!
Oh boy I can't wait until TAS videos of this game begin to come out
Tbh target has their demos too loud.
That part where he ditches the path and takes the bullet bull to the moon fragment killed me!
this guy did NOT set up a tripod in the middle of Target... did he?
Excuse me but where did you play this at?
How can you rush such a fantastic game :(
Definitely one or two things that could’ve been done a second faster, but overall this is pretty good. As someone who wants to speedrun this game myself, I can’t wait to get a hold of the game and start learning the controls. Also want to test a few things to see what can and can’t be done for skips, glitches, and overall time saves.
There's actually a demo of this game out there?
SO. FUCKING. EXCITED. I mean fire emblem warriors will be good n all. but odyssey is where it's at
THANKYOU for this content! good movement was all I wanted to see but it's nowhere
There are no bad points in this game now!
Speedrun of demo...
This is giving the game some really good publicity
I think ground pounding on her head would've wrap the broodal fight up in just two hits.
So far the game isnt out and I can see the speedrunning possiblities are going to be amazing THUMBS UP!!
Nice run dude! Looks like the rolling is super efficient as I've thought!
Dang the game isn’t even out and yet people are already speed running it.
Idk if this is true but I noticed that when you get close to her she’ll back up then attack a lot faster than just waiting for to attack
I can already see this will be great for speedrunning from this alone
this game is going to be so awesome to speedrun, especially 100% run
When you hang out all day at Circuit City playing the demos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4OYXpKxHT4&t=7m52s here is the bomb reflect people are talking about.
I hope speedruns like this stay a thing when the game comes out. 10 min challenges and what not. It'd be fun to watch lol
Basically it's Mario spindashing at sanic speed.
The game is not even out yet and there is a speed run of it XD
I hope this starts a trend.
Holy fuck you are a psycho at this props to u
Damn dude. Great job! Where did u do this?
wow fast make new video
Rolling around at the speed of sound. Oh wait wrong series...
i subscribed & i turned on the notification bell on, when you buy the game when it comes out speedrun it, your gameplay was smart af.
ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF WAHOO.
Ohhh god, I actually can’t wait for this game to come out just for the speed runs
Holy fuck you’re really good!
And 3:29 SUPER MARIO GALAXY RETURNS
CoolCat Moon Get CoolCat
Congrats on World Record.
lmao
guiijiii!
Amazing speedrun!
Why do  you Always throw cappy before a Dive  even  when you are not Diving into cappy?
What?!
Dude\n\nWhat the fuck
12 days til' Christmas!
daaaaamn man. Nice!
Awesome!
Nice run mate
0:04 sanic gotta go fast
Nice
But first we need to talk about parallel universes.
Kool
Not fair! The demo at my target ended at 2:25
What buttons do you press to do the rolling move??\n\nAlso what buttons allow you to get back to your hat once you have thrown it?
This is so damn absurd and I love it. This game is gonna make my year.
How do you get the demo
How do you do the constant rolling?
Great.\nNow do it in 0.5 a presses.
How do you get this demo?
These speed runs make this feel like a true successor to super Mario 64. \nI'm sure some would prefer Galaxy or Sunshine, but this takes the cake.
you odyssey this game its amazing
america is so lucky damn
I'm worried that the game seems rather empty due to the expansive landscapes not being more filled with objects.
I hate how they nerfed the long jump, I was fine with it in Galaxy but its called a long jump for a reason
And how did you get the demo?
this is a record that cannot be broken after the demo stands are beeing removed, you set an unbeatable world record! :D good job
Imagine the poor souls waiting their turns in line behind this guy
Why can't they have a demo on the switch?? Not in target or Best Buy of Walmart or anything...
These demos being speedrunned only makes me realise that if the 3D mario game after Odyssey DOES NOT HAVE a cappy equivalent (in terms of jumping toolset), the game will be automatically inferior.
There is an imperfecto ruler right now and nobody gets it either.
Omg I love this Cliff guy so much! So full of energy and you can really tell he loves his work. I wanna be like Cliff when I grow as old as he is.
In practice, most teachers would label you a smartass and grade you down if you pointed out that the sheet wasn't perfectly rectangular or that you have to subtract the area of the holes, etc.\n\nI think back to when I was a teenager and I would be really eager to point out that the surface of the paper isn't perfectly flat. It has a bunch of fuzzy fibers if you get in real close, so depending on the granularity of your measurements you could come up with an area that's arbitrarily large.\n\nBut of course, I wouldn't actually do that. That sort of thinking is a one-way ticket to detention. School was an exercise in obedience, not in rational inquiry. Your first and only goal is to determine what the teacher wanted you to do, and then do it.
As an adult, I see the wisdom of that experiment. As a just tell me the answer kid, I would have wanted to throw a book at his head.
Where would I be able to get that ruler? I'd love to give this homework to my physics students!
This guy is a perfect teacher. he conveys enough enthusiasm so that you feel the thirst of knowledge
How do I buy a class set of those rulers?!
TOPOLOGY SNOOP DOGG BACK AT IT! WHAT A PIMP
If every number times zero equals zero and every number times infinity equals infinity, what is zero time infinity?
3:25 Not only double 17, the ruler also less 1 mm mark.
NUMBERPHILE PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT\nCould you do a video about the number 672? That would be amazing
Is there somewhere I can print off the offset sheet and ruler?
What is an iphone guy?
Infectious enthusiasm! Love teachers like this. This is how to make learning fun.
Who is this guy? So funny! :D
This guy is straight outta the creed. Nothing is true; everything is permitted.
We must know, we will know. I could not agree more!
**goes to my locker to check if my ruler isn’t duplicating numbers**
For some reason this guy reminds me of Scott Bakula.
what is 1110 to the power of 1111 ?
You are cruel! I love it.
He missed a couple of assumptions:  Even if you caught the two 17's on the ruler, whose to say the ruler is calibrated correctly?  And if you're using the other sheet of paper to check squareness, you better know that your source sheet is also square.
I've got a question, but first let me set the scene. \n\nSo, I was calculating the limit of x->4 of (x²-2x-8)/(4x-x²) this would equal -1,5. Of course if x=4 there would not be a y-value because you would divide by 0. So wondered what it would look like if you zoom in on the the point A(4;-1,5). I took my calculator (TI-84 plus CE-T), put in the function and started to zoom in. Eventually I started to see something that looked like random spikes in the line.\n\nSo my question is: why does this happen?
Legend has it that his brain is a Klein bottle
Awwwww, Metriiic!  Do I have toooooo!?\n\nI don't know how I would have handled this as a student.
I would conjecture that the likely enduring memory of his students would not relate to mathematics, but rather be something along the lines of, Trust less.
theres holes in the paper
I think if you get Cliff Stoll and Matt Parker together, tell them go off come up with something together in secret, you have 3-12 months, as needed, the result would be *spectacular!*
Hey Numberphile, so I found this geometric puzzles called Euclidea. You can feature some problems there. It will be interesting to watch mathematicians doing that game.
That guy is a beauty
Make a model of the paper and measure the paper with photographs and electron beams and write some simple software to measure the output and report on surface area. Measure model map I always say. Thanks for the Hilbert quote. We will know!!
Can you fill a klein bottle with watter?
Great video! Having that sort of mentality can get you into trouble at work sometimes, people just want instant results these days and consider curiosity a waste of time. I just had a shitty day at work because of that and I feel better now knowing there are different people out there.
I don't really know about doing an integral, but couldn't I just measure and subtract the area of the triangles that are made when the papers are lined up? 1:45
HOW DID HE EXPLAIN OWNING AN IPHONE I NEED TO KNOW
I would use a scanner to determine the area. Would just need to determine how much area each pixel is.
I feel like noticing the trapezoid paper (and the innacurate ruler) is one of the few things that would be easier in American units, because our papers are all 8.5x11, so when you start measuring and it's 8.45x10.9, something's wrong. If it's 8.45x9.9, there's something very wrong.
Can numberphile make a video on infinity - infinity =π
I looked for this ruler on google. Haven't found anything. Does anyone have an image of the ruler, that can be easily printed? Thanks!
Cliff both looks like and has the same speech patterns as Rick Sanchez.
My first thought was the ruler tbh.
It was Hilbert: Wir müssen wissen, wir wereden wissen, in response the the Latin maxim igroamus et ignorabimus (we do knot know and we will not know).\n\nI hate not being able to solve a puzzle. It will consume me until I know. This is a trait I have in common with a very large number of scientists and engineers. I think it's innate rather than taught. Some people are happy not to know.
Paper size nerd. The second he gave the measurements, I knew something was off.
How on earth can he forget Hilbert's name?
Cliff, if you teach a math class at school, I would gladly drop everything and go back to school, that school to be specific
This was exactly how I got a job as a sound tech in college! They asked why I wanted the job with no experience, I just said, every time I walk by a sound board, I want to know what all those knobs do.\nThe real answer was that I didn't want to work in the dish pit, but I got in regardless.
This guys brain is wired just like mine
I like that feeling
I want to ask that guy a question
Is the Earth pear shaped?
Why don’t more teachers do this? You know, make students think. This man is brilliant.
So enthusiastic about his work.. I Really like him...mathematically speaking..
have he done a video about everyone is 7 handshakes away from the president? i found that odd
i love this guy
This man looks like Einstein on weed
Acting outlandishly can get you a fair bit of mileage.
I thought that one of the interpretations would include measuring the depth of the paper by folding it and using the depth to find the area of its edge-like sides.
He should be collecting royalties off Dr. Emmett Brown.
Clifford Stoll is a Ph.D. astronomer. But back in 1986, while employed as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker, one who stole $0.75 of computer time (back when you had to rent computer time-no one owned computers back then)—later identified as a KGB agent—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. \n\nStoll was tenacious and needed to KNOW even then-I mean, how many people would devote months trying to find a $0.75 accounting error?\n\nAfter identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. It is recognized as one of the first examples of digital forensics. He described the events of his investigation in The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which was a huge international best seller, and is an excellent book that I highly recommend.
For a moment I thought I was watching Julias Sumner Miller. Those were the days.
i was a little sad about my future, but after i watched this, it encouraged me.
This guy is what indiana jones would look like when teaching
Cliff is great, would have liked to have had him as a teacher for sure. Enthusiasm is important
This is beautiful, Cliff
I want to be his student
Great advice for youngsters, and others too.
I actually hired someone not once, but twice for two different companies because he said in the first interview “I don’t know, but I know I can figure out the problem if I had more time and the right tools.” This was after he tried to trouble shoot a timed, and impossible to solve, hardware problem (yes I rigged it).
I love him so much 💗💗💗
His students are lucky.
I loved this!! What an awesome guy! And super interesting
This guy should have a TV show only for himself
How is this man still not knighted?
I still don't know how to meassure the paper properly now.
This guy is AMAZING !!!!
I knew he was probably gonna tell me that measuring a piece of paper may not be as streight forward as I think... but this.. I didn't expect this..... awesome.
and no students notices that with that definitely Trumpfakish ruler, the usual 20x27cm sheet of paper measured... 20x26cm ;-) (check on the video)
This video probably had a larger impact on me than 4 years of high school teachers. Education is so much more than standardized tests and memorization. It's about learning how think and feel and react. This was beautiful.
This 5 minute video conveys a sense of scientific rigor so amazingly well!\nI love this so much, I emailed it around the intro physics lab department at my university yesterday morning.  This morning, we're talking about maybe using this as the first lab of the fall semester for next year's program.\n8th grade?  The lessons in this video apply at all levels of research.
o didn't think you'd be an iPhone guHILBERT DAVID HILBERT
That's really educational!\nBtw, I was unintentionally expecting a cry of Great Scott lol
He goes on about the desire to know things, only to go all around trying to find that mathematician's name. That's one way to show you stick to your philosophy!
3:50 This is something that comes natural in CERTAIN areas. For some people its science others its math, others its English.
Find the minimum value of (10a+13)^1/2+(10b+15)^1/2 given that a+b=10
bless this man
Just like Doc Brown: kinda crazy, totally enthusiastic. Lovely.

Fantastic
Yes.
This is sooooo cooooool!!!!
What a delightful person.
Cliff rocks!
YAYYYY CLIFF!!!
Amazing! :D
great advice! I was caught.\ner. why two '17' on the ruler? lol. about the wrong 'tool' to use?

Someone did something this cool with one of my most favorite old games of all time? What a first impression. Immediate subscription earned.
wow you went viral. to bad you can't monetize it. did you expect to get this many views?
Why is it so amazing 🐢

This is honestly so great! I didn't realize the music synchronized with the drawings but when I did I was likeholy shit what!. \nAlso just a little advice, because like other comments has mentioned, different sources have stolen your work without giving credit to you, so I suggest maybe adding a watermark somewhere in your next video (corner?). People can still crop it out, but most video stealers simply just want to share the video quick and easy without editing it. So yeah, anyways love your work! I'll be sure to credit you if I come across a non-credited video of this in the future. Looking forward to your next project! :D
I don't think that's how sheet music works
Wait does whenever he hits sometihing it makes a sound if so that’s amazing
Wow that was great
I can watch this whole day, amazing :D
I really loved this video, I just hate to point out that a musical staff has 5 lines and the one you had at the end had 4. Besides my little ocd tic, I loved it. Good job
YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE MADMAN.\n\nTHANK YOU.
more of this please!
I think there are two words that best describe this video:\nHo-ly shit
Why the hell was this in my recommended
You have crossed the line.
Dont click read more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI cant believe you
Oh man, I remember this game\n\nNow Austin needs to make a The Science! vid of this game with this clip on the background
Holy shit I'm in awe
It would work in a movie. I'm thinking something among the lines of the christmas ghosts putting you in this
HOLY SHIT PEOPLE STILL PLAY LINE RIDER?
This must have taken years
Hands down the single best thing i have seen today. I look forward to reliving this moment when my life flashes before my eyes
I used to play this game all the time!! Awesome work! Really brought back some nostalgia too
That was spectacular. Grinned like an idiot the entire time.
I dondt know why, but this is really calming and nice to watch... thank you! No shit, it really softens my anxiety :)
this is 2017 and the level itself is almost as impressive as a new line rider video coming out
amazing do more vids like this!!
Okay. Pretty good i guess, but can you do Master of Puppets by Metallica?
Dunno why this is in my recommended but AWESOME!  XD
Missed a few dynamic changes. And a few crescendos and decrescendos. But overall, good job :)
If you were a doctor, for the amount of effort you have put in this, you could have cured cancer.
0:48 to 0:58 is just too perfect 👌👌👌
Why is this so entertaining??? I loved it! That seems like a lot of work! Good job!
1967: I bet in fifty years we'll have flying cars\n2017:
Gods I used to waste so much time on Line Rider as a kid. This is heartwarming. Thank you for taking so much time for this labor of love.
omg lol i loved this game haha! i forgot it existed
this reminds me of happy wheels
Brings me back to those days where I would play Line Rider in computer class rather than the actual work.
This was the best thing ever
love how it syncs up with the music perfectly
I'm am jelous of your skills! Make more!
You are a Genius
Aww I thought this would be Savatage
Fuck me that was impressive
I remember playing this game. I've been looking for the name for so long, and I found it in the most amazing way ever!
What are the numbers? Measure numbers?
This is what YouTube stands for
A Facebook page called 8gaming stole this video
why is this in my recommended ????
Can I get a tab for this
Job interview: so what are some of your proudest achievements?\nYou: uhhh.. how do I explain..
how is he still alive 😂
Took an acid trip like this once....
Just imagine, your the little dude with a scarf on him, getting thrown around and flown into the sky. Then crashing while your body is being dragged into a small endless pit.
Nice recommendation.
WTF? XDXDXD NICE WORK
This... is.... amazing
Whaaaaaaat???

*Camila's crew seem like such fun people and I'm so glad she is having such a fun time on tour. She is such a talented and* *amazing artist and I can't wait for her album. We covered her new song Havana on my channel, hope you will watch it.*
PLEASE READ TGIS CAMILA AND RESPONDHey camila. I know you may not read this, but I wanted to tell you how Mich you inspire me. I first heard of you from your song bad things and now i can't stop listening to your music. I thought I liked you in F fifth Harmony, bit I personally think you're a way better solo artist. Ohh before i forget i wanted to tell you that the other day while i was at school, I was in p.e. and the dance class is right next to the p.e.anyway. So we were listening to our teacher when all of a sudden Havana came on! I was so tempted to jump out of my seat and start singing but I stopped myself. I play the drums but I also love to sing. I only sing to myself though. I have really bad anxiety and ao i can't sing in front of a large group of people. I can barely talk in front of people! Anyway, I just wanted to say you're my inspiration and I love you. I wish the best for your life and I hope to meet you someday
I squealed with joy when i saw PART III coming soon.. 😍❤ yaaassss
She's such a captivating and beautiful person, and the sweetest cutie-pie on this planet!
There is a video I want you to see. It's is called Goodbye Camila Fifth harmony will always be fifth harmony.  Search that exact thing on YouTube.  Plz reply back saying u saw it.  It isn't my channel tho.  But it is just to remind a few important things you might be forgetting.  You should save this before you lose it all.
It's so short I can't wait for more

JUST DO A FUCKING DOCUMENTARY, WE NEED MORE OF THIS
The dancer Justin is hot 🔥💕
did no one else see the tr*mp tower at :20 cause that shit doesn't belong here
So much fun !  They can be all friends but there is always a limit! She is their boss and they have to respect her as a boss and not as a friend... many singers go through the same stage of life that she is going... although she is having fun and she seems to be pretty cool
This reminds me of high school musical
I love her so much😧😭❤
omg this was in Atlanta. I've been to both of the places she went to, they were fun asf
She’s so down to earth and keeps it real
The happiness I felt watching this
I love her voice I love her songs !!!! She's perfect !!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍
i love you camila\nso much
I wish these videos would be longer
Every time this Havana starts in her documentary I go so emotional
I LOVE U AND I HAVE UR BACK ❤
So thanks full to god. Thank you so much to make this angel real, she's talented,  pure, amazing, beautiful, she's a true artist because she feels what she sing every time. I love you Camila ♡
I feel like this Toshi guy and Camila might... I dont know maybe  PR??
Man vids so short but u still get so much emotion out of it 😫💕
I love how the vids are SHORT AND EXCITING!!! 😍😍
Best 2:22 minutes of my life
this girl really never fails to inspire me so much. first, to just reach for your dreams no matter what happens; that it is scary but you just have to do it scared. now, to never forget to live because one day you'll look back at life and it's not the riches, fame, your occupation or your degree that will matter but the memories & relationships you created. im emo. i love her. 😭
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💜 🙈 , PERU PRESENTE Y APOYANDOTE 🌹 🙆❤❤
I felt like in a Grey's Anatomy episode lol
I love you Camz you make my life so worth living and girl I can't wait for the Havana video

Havana music video
Youtube y la ctm que no me aviso del video >:v, vIVA KMILA WEONNN❤
es por eso que te amamos!! Buscas las cosas que realmente importan la felicidad, el amor, el respeto y no la fama que desgraciadamente a  muchos cega. Tienes valores y tus fans lo saben te queremos!!❤🌹❤
I have a question for camilacabello \nCan I make a mashup with your son Havana
Who tf dare to dislike this vid?!
that chick had THE WORST golf swing i've ever seen in my life.
So mila talked about how she felt when she is surrounded by those people and she said how much she loves them but...did she not have the same feelings in 5H? Did she not feel as if the girls had her back? Did she not feel as if they loved her? And b-4 yall talk...i like queen mila and yes shes not in 5H ik... it was just a thought 😙😙
you wanna be quite precise so 8,9 or 10 minutes
Can we make a Swiss roll with a giant raisin on top?
I'm gonna have to veganize this and make it.
Ricegum took the L
#FindJeremysDairyFreeGirlfriend2k17
Why is someone who is dairy free an idiot?
It has to be nice to have so few allergies in one's circle of acquaintances that dairy free poses a problem. I once made a birthday cake that was nut free, egg free, gluten free, chocolate free, berry free,  stone fruit free and that did not contain lactose, in order to accommodate all the allergies and intolerances within the party-goers. Wasn't the BEST thing I've ever baked, but 1000% worth the effort to see everyone's delight when told that No, there's no gluten/nuts/eggs/etc in there, so you can eat it.
Is vanilla paste different from vanilla extract?
every time i watch this channel i get so hungry and want to eat what they made
Now technically... none of us should suck the tit of another animal into adulthood (or ever).
I live in Switzerland but never ate that
Hiya guys love your channel. Would you be able to make baba ganoush at some point? I love it and would really like to see your version. It's good as a dip but I love it with spicy roast lamb too thanks 😉
Yep, I'm gonna hold off for another five seconds cause I always end a little... too... early. Oh, look look look, nearly nearly nearly. Nuts are going in!
Thank you for the dairy free recipe
Where on earth do you find hazelnut milk!!!?!?!!
in Chile we call that brazo de reina, which means queen's arm
Any chance of you guys making Wagamamas Firecracker Chicken one day?
my name is Jeremy But no girlfriend hard r i p.
You're knocking off my nuts ;)
You come for the recipes - you stay for the puns
“And then you wanna grab yourself (long pause) a tray lined with paper.” 😂
JEREMY YOU IDIOT i died
Stoked to see your flavour choice!  Hazelnut and coffee is one of my absolute favourite combos. Thanks for the shout out :)
Love how he explains the reason for each ingredient/action!
Did anyone notice the head-wiggle Ben always does while or after saying sorted?
Any suggestions if you can't have eggs or dairy? 😥😥😥 I've the worst allergies :(
I’m Jeremy’s girlfriend literally
Huh that's how I roll my joints 🤔
Mike, you can totally be Jeremy’s girlfriend if you want to. You can be anything you want if you believe hard enough.
Keep up the dairy free desserts/ food! 👌
What? didn't understand girlfriend explanation >.<
I love the intro it's so funny
Is it possible to substitute hazelnut with macadamia?
Please temper your hazelnut coffee mixture or you will scramble the yolk
What if you can't find hazelnut milk? Will other nut mills work??
u're knocking off my nuts\n\nthat sounded damn wrong man XD
You're knocking off my nuts\n\nMike, 2017
Dairy free recipe but you used eggs......
Mike just wanted to put his nuts all over that roll but Ben kept getting in the way
But I’m a girl and I can’t eat dairy
Wait it says coffee st the start and hazelnut in the title
“let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll”
Love the video, but I'm allergic to hazelnuts :(
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
i must try this, thank you.
Hey Mike, you are acting a little strange lately, are you alright?\nBlink twice on the next video if you need help!
Ben almost said Dairy Free Girlfriend at the end don't even try and hide it lad
You can make this vegan by replacing the egg yolks in the cream with silken tofu and the eggs in the cake with aqua faba for the volume and oil for the fat!
Mike''s looking better than eva... so YUMMAYY :)
Ben wins for the first minute with that nose pinch over the glasses...
You're knocking off my nuts \n-Micheal
Could I replace the coffee with something else? Dairy free but I can't stand the taste of coffee..
If he waited until cake was cooled off a little I don't think it would've stuck to the parchment. Can't always cover bad bits with powdered sugar
Oh my god, that looks soo good... I wanna have it!
oh my god Mike don't ignore it >:C
Looking for Jermi in the commnets ;)
That looks yummy even for people who can eat dairy.
I've already become obese watching this. Eating it will kill me for sure.
Swiss rolls are awesome and super tasty so it's awesome that you made a video with this recipe, but you can tell that it's def not perfect. Swiss rolls should be round and the spiral should stand out well otherwise the cake part might not have been made right which is totes fine for just eating with family, but you want to impress your mates right? ;)
Wow it is on trending!
Have you guys ever tasted woodruff before? (or in german Waldmeister) If not you have to try it its a unique taste that i never found somewhere else.\nI also would like to see you come up with a recipe for it.
The best things about dairy-free and/or vegan recipes is that those can be enjoyed by everyone in the family together!
Hmm...reading a comment I had an idea.  These things rarely escape so I hope this is a good one.  Here goes...How about an education week?  Teaching a class or feeding the 5000 in a dinner school or students restaurant.  Best foods for learning etc.  I'm sure that students will love it.  Well, how did I do?  Oh...OK.   Sorry, I think I'll just go off and disappear.
I'm sorry but you know Mary Berry would say that the roll is not tight enough!!
Looking good, Mike! Lots of jaw line definition!
Which is the better method for making marshmallows using egg whites or without egg whites?
I understand how weird this is going to sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway.\nWatching Ben roll that pastry was like, oddly sexual? Just me? 🤷
Looks a bit like it's filled with cold pork gravy... So my challenge for you is this: Make a savory pork swiss roll with gravy!
 You're knocking off my nuts \n*Ben giggles silently*
Beans brushing up against nuts. SAUCY

Eggs are dairy...
Wowzer.. so trendy.. \n\n..\n\n-_-
I thought eggs were dairy... 🤔
nothing like a mild, unnecessary transphobic comment when you're trying to watch a recipe video, thanks so much Ben

I love how people talk shit and then say “no shade”. Excuse me but you’re just being a bitch NO SHADE gtfo
Katy have you ever had that mole on the left side of your chest checked out? asking bc u my girl
Great work! Funny how you look like you have a permanent frown 😅
your lips make me want to eat powdered donuts 🤔
U look like Kim K with that blonde hair! 😳 Love this Katy!!! 😍😍😍
I love when you do colorful and creative looks! They just look sooo bomb on you. 🙌🏽💕💜Like your face charts omg I dieeee, keep it coming @Katy! 💗💖
What you said was holo was NOT holo smfh
Ok I love this n all, but is it weird that I like you and Desi's hands? Like weirdest comment ever js tho🤣🤣 like the hands have posture haha
i don't get the dots on you forehead?
Can you do a fortune teller Halloween look
What other holosexuals got trigger when she said holo when there’s no holo on her look?
I'd like to skull fuck this girl.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
I thought to myself I can do this, lets check the video out.  After watching a bit,  I would definitely never ever be able to do this. Very cool!
You look like Kim Kardashian in the thumbnail.
I love it, but I really love the eyes. I'm going to wear the eyes as an everyday look lol
You should have done your neck as well! 😊
How is this video advertiser friendly? I thought your immense beauty would trigger some kind of a red flag.💕
How do you look look gorgeous with every hair colour 💁🏻❤️
This is how you do a pretty skull look for Halloween without appropriating another culture.  Love it!
So dope K A T Y 💜💕
Girrrrrrl how is this even easy, it would take me a thousand hours and would come nowhere near as good as yours lol.
you look like Kim K with the wig on.
Am I the only one that think she looks like Kim kardashian???
Dam! I feel so inspired now! Thanks Katy!
Love it purple is my fav!! 💜
Can't wait to recreate this 😘😘😘
I think this look would have looked a bit better if the contour section were a bit more anatomically correct.  You put too much of the pink on your cheecks when it should have been lighter in the front and darker(more pink) towards the hollows. Overall you did a great job Katy. Practice makes perfect.
I love the eye makeup so fucking much
Barbie 💕💜💕💀 I love this
GIRL!!...IF YOU DONT BRING BACK THE MALFOY HAIR!!!😤

I have officially given up on the youtube community, These people can not take anything seriously!
I want a video about modern Neo-colonialism in Africa!!!!! Nobody talks about it as though it were a shunned subject!!! But there's a growing movement to get rid of the FCFA and all of it's impacts!!! No one cares about the constant infringement of independent nations by foreign powers and their corporations as they install puppet governments to attain their resources. France depends on foreign resources to survive. They have ever since the 17th Century. They needed their colonies and slaves more than ever after WW2's destruction. Why do they teach us then that France would give them their Independence in 1960 then? If Congo DRC is one of the wealthiest natural resource filled countries why is it so poor? And if it's all due to their corruption where do the natural resources go? It just bakes in the sun? Who benefits from Africa's misery? How do they stop it from growing? And what is the war in the Congo jungle really about?
Please do a video on Kenya politics.

Whenever Kurzgesagt and I get together the topic of life extension comes up.  A lot.  Go watch his part 2 video here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoJsr4IwCm4
Amusing. Humans get lost in their own self importance. We, like all things are a part of the universe, we are not separate from it. You are simply the universe consciously looking at itself.\nWe all do not have a ‘life’. We are life. The one life. The life of the universe.\nWalk into any forrest and see the trees and plants that have ‘died’, see how they are intricate to the thriving forrest.\n\nTake the billions of cells in the human body, consider that ever cell was consciously aware of its own existence. Every cell clinging to its ‘life’. \nThe egoic mind is a self deluded, dangerous thing, clinging to its identity.
I didn't accept death until lately(Although at the age of 150 :P). Way to bring me back!
I wander what happens when we die?
cancer is good for the world as it keeps the population from growing larger than it already is...
But then the over population would be mad!
Dead & alive, it's the circle of live.
This doesn't settle anything Grey! What about the millions of problems you have not addressed in the vid?
But why live forever? Death doesn't have to be an unhappy ordeal. It may me a needed closing chapter to somebody that has done enough in his life. It may be a way to humillity. Mankind's biggest flaw is thinking of themselves as gods, thinking they can do as they please and treat everything else like garbage. I'm not making this a religious issue, I'm talking about the ecosystem. And if we don't die, the world won't have room for us. Death IS a natural thing. You leave room and you become food for the ground that gives food to the living. It's a cycle. It used to work well (nature) until we started messing with that and started to want to live forever. Every living thing dies, and it's fine. It's our iinacceptance and fear of the unknown (death) that moves us as human beings. But don't be fooled thinking it's a matter of changing things. It's a matter of embracing your fears. And yes, ACCEPT. There's nothing wrong with that. DENIAL is the problem.
This is a gross oversimplification on the implications of senescence -- an idea that is not as simple as this guy puts it.
If their was something on earth that would let me live forever. I would murder the world for it. Become the smartest person or something I could be. Be there to watch what all happens, to be there when it does. To watch where It's all going.
Why did you rap this video?
Interesting video. I find it really worrying when people suggest that we must suffer in order to experience true happiness. It seems like a manipulative way to justify abusing people. Sure, people without lower standards often appreciate things more, but do you really want to be the starving person would is grateful for bread crumbs? Lowing our standards does nothing but make us blissfully ignorant and naive.\n\nSo yeah, an eternal life would be very nice, so long as we had infinite resources and space to accomodate infinite people. Or alternatively we find a way to life without eating/drinking/breathing.
So your saying that death is life
Wen I was a kid I was scared of death now I'm older its the only thing that gets me through the fuckin day!
how about over population if no death
Nobody deserves to live forever. Humans are scum and a pox on the planet
God is life forever
Gotta love all the pro-death rationalizations from dimwits in the comments section. Some people so eager to die that they will conjure up any justification just to preserve the status-quo.\n\nBut what about overpopulation?\nWhat if bad people got to live forever?\nWhat if it got boring?\n\nOh, I see - because there *might* be some problems, the correct option is TO LET EVERYONE FUCKING DIE. Seems perfectly reasonable. \n\nOh, but you'll die anyway.\n\nSo why then bother treating people with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and so on? They'll just die anyway. \n\nListen: support anti-aging research. Deal with the (merely hypothetical) problems when they arise. And if you don't want to stop aging, don't avail of anti-aging therapies when they arrive. Simple. It's your choice, and you can die if you want to. But don't you dare be so arrogant to make that decision for other people.
Life without death is cancer.
I'm not sure if I'm feeling optimistic or pessimistic right now
Number 1 on trending! YouTube is finally promoting good content!!
A bit longer life is, in general, good; great even. Life without death, not good. Infinite life means infinite suffering, infinite boredom as you do everything there is to do an infinite number of times, infinite misery. Zero is greater than negative ten; even greater than negative infinity.
I would love to be able to die whenever I want instead of set time I would truly have no destiny and could choose my own path
This is some half baked, unreasonable, far fetched crap a school kid thinks of while staring out of the window in a maths lesson they don't understand...
The peaceful pill / nembutal should be made more available for severely depressed adults
This video is similar to a round earther watching a flat earther video
Death is good and necessary.
Give me immortality with a suicide button
Imagine the amount of incest if you never aged. would no longer have to look at old black and white photos to get a glimpse of grandma's fine ass
Blessent mon couer d'une languor monotone.\n\nThat's eternal living, in this world.
This is a hypothetical but what if we do implement this immortal society and with all the time on our hands figure out that there is in fact an afterlife what are the justifications for figuratively spitting in [put god name here]'s  face and saying screw you we dont want to follow your great plan of life
Those two episodes are terribly lacking sources and examples on how whe are going to beat aging !
This is what happens when you read a science blog for a week and start thinking you're a scientist.  You have no idea what you're talking about.  If you have any understanding of human biology, you understand that death is literally built in.  You can't live forever.  Your body is designed with the expectation that you have a max lifespan.  You're organs only work so long.  Your brain has a max capacity, it's a fucking meat computer for crying out loud, you can't just keep filling it forever.  You just can't accept death, and now you're making it everyone else's problem.
Does anyone know the name of the soundtrack that's playing?
How about let's solve depression first - aka, don't put the cart before the horse
subscribe to me please! !!
lol The parents over the sick kid saying Isn't nature amazing? got a morbid chuckle from me... I think... does that make me a terrible person?
The duo between CGP Greg and Kurzgrsagt is so strong and logical that it never failed to enlighten and usually convince me of their point of view. It is such a shame that at some point they will pass on alone and eventually be forgotten like everyone before and after our time.
You're going to give a lot of people a God Complex. Of course, with the innovations of technology, we'd do anything to live as long as we want. But life is suffering. People is suffering. Knowing more is suffering. Sure, you can turn the sufferings into positives but the world is in an endless debate on what the right thing to do is. I'd like to embrace death when it's ready to take me because I'm satisfied with the life I have chosen and the choices I made and the people I'm with. There are so much people you can meet but every moment is fleeting and they are technically dead until you meet them again. Then what? Over populate the earth? Stop children from existing?
Long-term effects on the planet from undying humans that will kill use because we destroyed a natural order of life and death balance systems i don't see the price of living forever worth the mass killing of all life and nature just so humans can life forever this well just enhance are parasitic nature that leads use to using more of are limited resource on this planet and replace Other life as a food source because will keep giving breeding human to the point were cow and other animals Can't feed humans. So the gift of undying life is a universe taboo for intelligent life for a good reason for biology life like humans. Just because it possible does not mean it should be done
But CGP Grey, without the grim reaper, who will force bad politicians to resign?
People die if they are killed
Shallow, arrogant, but the right way to think for this degenerate age.
But then when will we ever recycle our bodies and start anew?
Comments are so full of bullshit. Guys, if you want to die - you'll have plenty of ways, but don't stop me from living a longest possible life, ok?
people have been trying to conquer death for as long as there have been people.\ni think the answer will lie with transhumanism, why try to make our flawed meaty bodies last forever when we could instead focus on replacing that flawed meaty body with a synthetic one that actually can last forever?\n\ni often stumbled with the quandary of what happens if you replace your brain with a synthetic one with all of your thoughts and memories, would it really be you? \nor would you be the meaty dead brain that they discard, \nand would the new entity instead be an exact clone who thinks its you.\n\nthe solution is quite clear, partially replace the brain bit by bit, \nso at no point are you ever not that entity, you merely transition to being synthetic!
i lOved this video. really concise, good points, well placed imagery -thanks cgp grey :)
People, please stop mentioning overpopulation. Wouldn’t you rather deal with that problem than a 100% chance of death?
well aren't you a debbie downer CGP?
Solution: Accept the love of Jesus and become a Christian, then, live forever in a perfect eternity.
you are actually sick...to totally miss the point of the real reasons for death and the sheer dysfunction of wanting to live forever you are a typical product of the pathology of centuries of Judeo-Christian mental and moral weakness and that of Judeo-Christian so-called 'scientism'.the fact that the majority liked this video is pretty damn depressing and shows how many are weak worms begging and scraping for reality to support them like an unthinking parasite and an indication of just how far cultural marxism has infantilized people.because of your moral and spiritual poverty you fail to see the psychological implications of the issue... talk about materialsim and egotism... death is absolutely an essential and welcome part of life for very obvious reasons. if you know you know.if you don't you are pretty much already dead.don't make videos on topics you clearly don't actually want to think about.
The world would get over populated...
That does remind me of the Sims were you could play a game with the reaper to keep the person alive
Death is good life sucks. Even most religious people think like is a test.
Imagine a dictator got a long life because of this advancement in science, future doesnt look promising does it?  I believe this video is a one sided theory. Think of it this way, sure it would be nice for us to live a long life, longer than of the current standards but the world isnt all rainbows and shit. In some case for people who living in a very miserable condition, say for example a country with no human rights law, death is their friend while the dictator that runs that country death is their enemy. It is easy for us to say it sure is nice to live a long life. Of course it is you are living in a highly developed country with a  comfortable life.
If you are about to comment about overpopulation, please stop. There's a concept called scaling people tend to forget about.
Nice quote from Thomas Hobbes “Life is Nasty, Brutish, and short”\n2:03
Whoa man I'm sober and I'm too high for this shit
Multitudes of men have walked on the surfaces of this Earth, they all had 2 things in common\nFirst, they were all delivered from their mothers womb.\nSecond, they all tasted death.
They shoulda called this vid Dont Fear The Reaper
You're just stagnating our evolution. We will forever remain the dumb inefficient beasts we currently are. Not to mention the fact that you'll be a complete burden to newer generations, if they ever come. You're also a product of your time, if you have hundred year old farts with primitive beliefs and outlooks on life you'll end up stagnating our technological and philosophical discoveries. We need new minds that are shaped by the future age. You have to be incredibly selfish to stink up the world with your primitive filth forever
if the reaper took a hol all insurance agencies would go bankrupt. as would many govt pension programmes. lol
Now I want to die now
Hey you got to 1 on trending. Congrats.
im stuck in a loop\n\n\n\n\nseriously
stopping the aging process is almost certainly out of our reach for decades....but.....what isnt out of our reach is virtual reality....that is where true immortality is achievable, the only organ that contains your consciousness is your brain, so aslong as we can keep that running, we would be immortal (and im not talking about uploading a copy of you, although a backup isnt out of the question).....however, what really creeps me out sometimes is, could we already be in a virtual reality? most people would come to the conclusion that their life is too boring, why would anyone choose this as a VR? Well, imagine if you were immortally maintained in a VR, after thousands of years surely the game would eventually becoming boring, maybe just maybe your life is the HARD difficulty. but, me personally, i want to die, because i am human and im curious and i really want to know what happens next?
CGP Grey: When do you want to die?\nme: now
There is nothing bad about death. Death is just the thing that will eventually end all of the suffering life has made you go through. You seem to confuse old age with death. It is also important to address the overpopulation issue which would worsen if people no longer died. If a person wants to live forever, then so be it. They should be permitted to become immortal but if that actually was possible there should definitely be restrictions on procreation.
For me, life is a nightmare.\nThe amount of effort required to just feel okay or mediocre becomes more and more as time marches on and happy moments are further apart.\n\nI can’t say I’d be okay living forever. It brings comfort understanding at some point this will end.
Death is a fate our universe itself will face one day.\nNo one can trully become all immortal, but we can improve both life's quality and quantity by a great measure, perhaps even not only halting but reversing the aging process. \n\nNatural causes of death can sieze being natural in the future.\n\nWe may start to fully control our biology. \nPhysics though is a different beast! It is equal and universal, it governs above all.
Always thought this. When people argue you can't do this because you are playing god I argue\n\n1. Is God actually real?\n2. Wearing a bandaid is playing God by your definition. Let the cut get infected if it was meant to be. Stop playing God :)
Everyone who has a current net worth of more then 3 to 5 Billion USD will be immortal.
I would like to be immortal
Wow this is depressing and inspirational at the same time
I want to die now
Complete immortality sucks. But immortality from age? Please hell yeah? I want to live to the point when humans can fly to space and meet aliens...Or to the point when we get super realistic VR and we can have digital aliens. Either or.
I was watching Final Destination before this video LOL
I am ready to meet Tupac when I die
Dear gray, I want to die, how can I get the reaper to bumb me up the schedule, and what mindset should I be in when I meat him?  This seems like a good follow up to maximizing unhappiness.
We cant stop aging, but we can live longer and healthier, but we will die at all cost, life is dark, we need to face it.
please, subtitle?

I never think of death as something bad the only thing that makes me hate death is the people around me because I love them :).but like he siad we all die
Why are all these people in the comments section acting like they're experts in all fields and know how the world works ? Some even are commenting edgy anime quotes. Wtf?!! I feel like this edginess will be the end of the human race, imagine if an edgy cave dweller stopped people from ever leaving caves ? Or An all knowing edgeLord telling people yes we can tame fire, but should we?
Jesus defeated death. He holds the keys.  I dare you to talk to him about it.  After all, he did say I am the way, the truth, and the LIFE!
How is the old Taylor dead if she still makes these same love songs?

This make me remember the story my fake boyfriend in wattpad
The old Taylor wasn't dead ? 😆
For which boyfriend did ya write this one, T?
The song is okay, but I like the previous singles more. Also, it is annoying that she first makes this huge 'show' about changing completely and then behaves the exact way as before. Still excited for the album tho.
she is the same Taylor !
I cover taylor swift song look what you made me do piano version. Check it out.
I loved this song ❤

The old Taylor is dead... Because the old Taylor wrote love songs about what she thought love is and the new Taylor writes about what she knows love it. Gorgeous.
Definitely an upgrade from Look What You Made Me Do that scared me..
Ocean blue eyes 💙🌊 lookin in mine\nI feel like I might sink and drown and die.. 😍😍💞💖❤❣💟❤

If we end aging, how should the medicin be divided?
TO all the cretins who disagree with curing this shi - you can shoot yourself and experience death any time u want.
Great video! Do you guys know how advanced preventive medicine already is? Mice live 35% longer when the root causes of aging are addressed! Here is the blog/newsletter about rejuvenation research: www.leafscience.org/blog and you can join public discussion of the ways to live longer healthier at Lifespan Discord chat https://discord.gg/4gNG9q4
ending old age would be terrible for prisoners, honestly inhumane😶
got here from do the mario
Now imagine people like Kim Jong Un, Hillary Clinton, George Soros or Vladimir Putin living FOREVER. Scary scary...
Neither you or cgp issued the main issue- population growth! Totally skated over the real problem, which is shocking considering the title of the video is should we end ageing! Very misleading title.
Whether there is an actual afterlife would never be known, and it also wouldn't matter. I'd rather chug along until it's my time.
I want to die before 30
I would live with my family and friends for 1000 years
i want people to leave me the fuck alone, and let me go to my own rythme but i dont expect people to do that in a hundred years so i need life extention technologies
You can tell the *Trending Page* is rigged when the 3rd and 4th videos are 2 word questions.
There needs to be a trade off of some sort or we would overpopulate the planet in a single generation (made sterile if you get treated for aging or something)
Living 250 years would be nice
*The main reason I don't want to die is because I want to see how much the human species can evolve. :D*
People with Biology degrees get triggered. XD I'm joking. :P
Yes we should extend life if we can. Then let the individual decide when and if they want to die.
The relative brevity of life and inevitable death is the single driving force for us to reach further while we still can. Without it, I know my motivation to do better would be lost. Something could always be done another day, or another decade.
This opens a dark path for humanity. Religious wouldn't want eternal life. Scientists could change the future of mankind but the super rich would control the technology. Death by violent process would not be removed and specific paths of humanity would develop with a new era of violence from religions toward science is inevitable. What I believe is saving humans from an eternal end is someone else's opinion of destroying a chance at a paradise finale.
Why can't we make an entire organ system out of automatic parts and all we need is to be refurbished once in a while? Surely that will stop people aging
Ending the aging process should be illegal.
Seeing cgp grey was so unexpected that was really cool
Live longer because I want to and its better
fuck yeah we should, 500 years for me please.
Live longer or forever? Fuck that, I don't want to live more than 55-60 years.
Quite the intriguing concept, illustrated wonderfully.\nI think it's important to note that life extension does not mean the end of disease, but rather the end of our ever reducing resistance to disease as we age. Obviously, some diseases are strongly related to aging (cancer, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, cataracts...etc). Life extension combats the very essence and causation of these conditions. Other conditions however, like infections and auto-immune diseases are not strictly related to the aging process. Life extension shouldn't affect the development of these conditions and as such doesn't necessarily entail being healthy or disease-free, but rather being able to resist them as well as the healthiest and most resilient version of yourself.\nP.S Zeus is a colossal asshole.
If their was something I could take that would give immortality. I would murder the world for it. Honest brutal Truth.
Imagine if you lived forever it’s my 104,385,204,240 birthday today yes I still feel the same grandpa
The robots where right kill everyone and stop all ageing!
Well, for all of those who say overpopulation is gonna be a problem, you all have to keep in mind; There will be numerous attempts to colonize Mars in the next couple of decades, starting from mid 20s . Experts say we might have 1 million people on Mars in the next 60-70 years, let's give them the benefit of the human error and say 100 if you'd like, still that won't be a problem if it's true...so given that we already plan on moving, I don't think overpopulation will be an issue...for a long long time. And by the time it is, if it ever will be instead of us getting extinct, we will have the techonlogy to move on further by then.
How can one even do this...
I say Yes to Halt aging process
Maybe we can download our minds onto computers and live in our own virtual worlds..
One of the few videos that made me say “hmm...” out loud. Well done
The music in this video was especially beautiful
If we stop ageing I think we would pass our carrying compasity for the human race and might go extict because we would run out of reasources and ethier starve or move to mars.
To everyone who's complaining about overpopulation in reference to this:\n\ni. having children serves the evolutionary purpose of passing on genes and keeping the human race alive\nii. being nearly immortal would lower the need for repopulation down to a fraction of a percent of what it is now\niii. being nearly immortal would eliminate the things driving us to increase population size constantly\niiii. we could then focus on only having children when necessary and practical
A reality where you're essentially living forever, excluding outside factors... And if my aging also stopped or reversed with this, then in theory, I'd eventually do everything there is to do or one can possibly do.\n\nAt the same time, I suppose dying is in that list of everything though. But if anything, I would put it at the end of my list.\nAnd with each thing you do, that list at the same time would keep on endlessly growing too... With every question answered, I guess more questions would pop up in it's place, just adding to the list.\n\nOr not, I don't know. I'm just some guy buried in the youtube comments.
I have witnessed death a couple of times, it was not a nice thing to see and didnt look painless to me. That being said, i still dont want to live forever. I would rather have happiness in my time for a few decades than an eternity of watching humans be cruel to each other. Heres an idea, its not ageing that kills us, maybe its a scale of happiness and joy. Over a century, does the sadness and cruelty of existance outway the happiness and joy to the point our souls / energy can no longer tolerate the proximty of humans.
200, thats hiw much I want to live
It is very likely that life extension and indefinite life is going to become reality in the coming decades. \nI think humans could live indefinitely in a young body, if they are able to manage their psychological problems that come with it .\nThere are going to be downsides to this, imagine greedy CEO's and dictators living indefinitely, where there is power, there is greed for more power and power corrupts.
Hey there great vid! But please bring the old animation back! This was in no way sub-par but I adored the old one!\nPeace.
Roughly 5:20 :\nAnd if you want to die, everybody want to stop you from thinking that.
How long would I like to live in good health? Long enough to do everything interesting, how long I think I'll live is a very different story😂I do too much crazy shit
Well I'm already immortal...
“It is He Who has created you from dust then from a sperm-drop, then from a leech-like clot; then does he get you out (into the light) as a child: then lets you (grow and) reach your age of full strength; then lets you become old,- though of you there are some who die before;- and lets you reach a term appointed; in order that you may learn wisdom.” [QURAN 40:67]
I wish we could end stupidness forever.. then again Kurzgesagt wouldn't have anything to put on youtube...
So, in other words, go vegan!
I myself await my glorious robot body! in the mean time ill accept this fleshy meat bag living long enough till that time can come. Give me the years! I want to see how the world turns out, to see space travel become real and everything else humans are capable of!
I wanna die at 500 years old, and not on the planet earth. So I am looking forward to this.
Solving death should be the second highest goal of any civilized nation, beaten only by developing means of sustainable energy production. There is no such thing as too many people, only insufficient energy. Luckily, there's a star right next to our planet. Might want to look into that.
I hate the Idea of living forever, and being able to determine your own age.  Just enjoy life to the fullest while you can, there's nothing wrong with dying, it a natural thing that billions have, and will experience.
A virus is to humanity what humanity is to earth. Being able to stop aging would just make us a more deadly one. Now if a virus kills its only host ...
Why doesn’t he bring up that this would cause over population?
If I was offered the chance to live an immortal and an impervious life, then I would accept it immediately.
I think Nature/God/Whatever you call it gave us humans a limit on age for a reason. One of those being how screweed up the species and and realizing Holy $#@! we can't let these things live any longer! Can you imagine how much worse they could do?!!?
to look and feel young and healthy for 100,000,000 years
It's a terrible idea.
@6:20 'bout damn time....collaboration is the key to immortality...f**k I love this channel
its not a good idea because the world will be overrunned
My wish: die peacfully in the age of 99\nThen I will reach 2100
Legit 5 billion years, longer if we can find another planet to live on, and even longer still if we can find away to contain and recycle the energy of a star.
I'm not sure I want to live another 5 years never mind 40
I want to die
I want to live forever man wym, there’s nothing more you can do as a corpse other than lay there rotting.
No way , the most beautiful part of life is its finiteness and fragility if we eliminate aging and delay death then we remove the motivation to improve and accomplish the most we can before the clock runs out because why do  all we can do today when we can do it tomorrow ? If we have 200 years to master a talent is it still as impressive or will everyone be able to paint like divinci as a baseline.
Ayy anyone want to live till the turn of the century??? Speaking @Millennials
i feel like anyone who think they wouldn't want to live forever are so limited intellectually. It won't be soon after we discover how to become eternal that we will be able to put ourselves into virtual realities and edit our consciousness. We could even put ourselves into a VR and make us forget we're in one and live potentially an infinite amount of lifetime. Oh and btw at this point you will also be able to make so any moment in life is as exciting as the first time someone kiss you. \n\nI know i won't ever feel like not playing the game of lifes anymore.
I would love to live for hundreds of years to watch how much we advance and develop.
And this supposedly heavily philosphical video starts up with a dire contradictoin. \n\nPhysics IS biology. and biology is physics. The aging process is dependant on population capacity and death rates. A rat will only live two years even if perfectly healthy and in captivity because its BIOLOGY is built for that existence as a species. It is nature creating a balance. Otherwise the world owuld be filled with rats taht lived for decades at a time.
Ignorance is not a bliss.
I would want to live forever, but not necessarily on earth. Being able to live until true space travel is possible would be cool.
Humans being mortal is one of the factors that allows humans to evolve. (Like all other animals and plants). With longer life expectancy comes lower fertility rates. Making us immortal would freeze us in time. Not only in a pure biological sense but in socially and culturely aswell. Compare the your grandparents world view with your own. What is important for them, what is important for you? What is acceptable, what is not? How do they feel about change, what do you feel? What are you willing to give up for change? What are they willing to give up? I'm not claiming all change is good, but willliness to try (alot of) new things is, in my mind, without a doubt good. With all this said fear should never beat curiosity.
If the mind continues to age, if there's more to our consciousness than biological processes, this could lead to a bunch of young, handsome folk living forever with dementia. Also, if you never age, your chance of dying from an accident jumps to 100%.

Nobody can fix it
weekly deathmatch tournaments would be mandatory
Good idea because I exist
If everyone was able to live forever,the world would be extremely dark as evil people won't die,crazy people also won't die and the list just goes on and on... Nothing can stop the evilness of human nature.If we could be immortal the world would not be happy and cheerful... but instead like hell.Human nature is just like that;corrupt.Dying is a blessing in disguise.So please do not think of living forever.I just hope that is impossible on earth...
Suicide is the only option to kill ourself if we get an immortal drug to cure aging.
I'll cautiously say that I think most people are being selfish here. I see many comments from people who want to live eternally with their loved ones, but they seem to forget that everyone has that same wish. Now, what would happen if we all were immortal? \n\nSimple: our world would become a chaos. Considering people would proceed to make even more babies, our world would be overpopulated in no time. Food and water resources would become extinct, and many people would die due to famine or drought. \n\nDeforestation would accelarate and we would run out of fossil fuel pretty quickly. Our only chance at survival would be colonizing Mars, but still, only a handful of people would make it there. \n\nConclusion: we would ruin our world even more than we're doing now if our selfish wish of becoming immortal would ever become reality
Wait! Didn’t the Bible say that people were living a few hundred years during 100 A.D.?
Even if we succeed in stopping ageing entirely, you would still die at around 100 years because of cancer. This is because cancer is not directly linked to ageing, but chance. With increasing time, you have a growing chance to develop disease. Even if your body is young and healthy!
accept jesus and you'll have everlasting life

This tune songs COLD in the studio Krept and Konan did their thing, if you NEED Beats like this shout me.
this song so lit
Cadet up in the vid fucking right
He just repeats don't talk too much, mans become a disgrace to the scene where my og's
How can man have cadet in the video and not have him spit a bar maaad
Americans won't understand half these bars
the tempo is too high.
I love how uk rappers usually just wear casual clothes which is pretty cool
Punch you out of your accessories lemme that clear (Claire) 🔥
Uk music really has become terrible give me wu tang any day fuck this shit
They wanna take shots like Barca but don't wanna say my Neymar \n\nFirst of all, Neymar plays for PSG
Played this at least 50 times today haaard tune
Wow, flipz don't talk like he got no mouth :/
oh lord what's Lucas doing here 😂😂
Big Shaq would be perfect for this jam
You wanna play like Barca, don't even say my name ma(Neymar) 🔥🔥
Been wait for this!
stormzy with a dead verse and a gay dance routine
But flipz don't talk like he's got no mouth??????
Now I’m in business class talking about the economy.
Oh my god this is overly HARD beats on A NEXT TING. #ILL
Here before a mill
I thought Akelle was locked up. Whats he doing in this music video?
My shit ain’t flames like this but I’m no rookie https://youtu.be/EC2k2YtywCc
Featuring stormzy yet hes in most of it
Bet Flipz gets gassed when he bangs this at home on his ones 😂
Should of got inch from section to likkle verse!!
Got your bird on my balls ..Spurs 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nYou wanna take shots like Barca, but don’t want to say my name-huh (Neymar)\nLike how do people even think of these lines. Too many punch lines from Krept & Konan. Stormzy came with that hype flow💥💥
Punch you out of your accessories, let me just make that Claire 😂😂
9/11 was an inside job
This video’s like where’s wally I swear 😂
sick beat but these lyrics i'm not feeling it
Here before it hits 1 mill
I'm seeing Stormzy getting a lot of shit in these comments! The dude did the hook for the track and put in an above average verse on top. Ya'll acting like this is his track!! The man was just featuring 💥💥💥
i want to like you Stormyzy coz you seem like the coolest guy in your interviews but you're so shit. Your lyrics are terrible and your flow is wack as fuk as u constantly sound like you're out of breath and you're not even rapping that fast. Fukin hell
Made the car dash like kimberly
I would actually like this more if stormzy wasn’t on it still a fucking banger
Goood music the first one sounds like Skepta
Takes me back to the shut up days.
Definitely didn't expect a Claire's bloody accessories reference
So i'm assuming they're advertising for Puma 😂
This is a lot better than bugzy new one lol go see walking dead (shit)
Stormzy,Skepta and giggs, these 3 are famous in the US but K&K are unknown... Thats all about to change, The Uk Scene about to kick off worldwide!
MAKE THIS 'ASK FIPZZ'... CUZ THIS HAD NO SINGLE L

Pewds is number 5 on trending? What happened?
edgar is so damn cute wtf, I couldn't stop looking at him.
the cool shirt + orangey-things outfit would look better if the pants were torn jeans yaknow
Second outfit was great!
When pewdiepie becomes too  Christiany, he lands in the YouTube trending list
#5 on trending. the trending tab is so bad.
I think that you already married but not
its time for a shave young man
Who else noticed Edgar was biting pewdiepie's finger in the beginning of the video?
The tag of the first pants hit the dog in the face.
am i the only one who stares at Edgar reaction n look for Edgar n gasp when Edgar out of the video while listening to them talking n then repeat the whole video to really..really watch the video..\n\n_ignored_                                                                                                                                                     + *buried in comment section*\n\nok.
Marzia looks healthy; that makes me so happy :')
Trending? This must be super kid friendly
Actually, that 2nd one looks REALLY good on you felix. Maybe it's your casual body language.
Around the experimental outfit Edgar was madly chewing that sock.
1:59 my life right there
in the 2nd outfit, if he took the matching collared shirt off and tucked the cool shirt into the pants it would look way better imo
Who else hates her voice
The outfits are horrible :o why Marzia :( I had high hopes
He looks like my PE teacher wearing the Adidas
Shes absolutely stunning,   wtf is she doing with you Felix?
McGregor Is that you ?
“Do you know that you think you’re way bigger?” That must hurt a lot

I've never seen Edgar act that adorable!😍
Nah man the jeans were the best.

Damn! i hope its not his real girlfriend.
1st outfit: nice top, terrible pants\n2nd outfit: terrible\n3rd outfit: 8/10. Need adidas shoes or slides\n4th outfit: nice top, terrible pants\n\nFinal verdict: your girl has a bad eye for fashion. Time to get a new girl buddy.
They get you on trending when you with her

I noticed that Keith Ape Damn Ra reference pewds

I love Rick and Morty but man, GMM has really gone downhill the past year or so.
So crazy to hear you guys give a shoutout to Binging with Babish. I seriously remember when his first video went viral on reddit and he only had a few thousand subs. It’s crazy how much he’s grown and so inspiring.
For some reason I just knew from the moment they said we have our own Top Hat Jones, let's bring him in that it was going to be chase.. haha
um is it me or link just eat drugs in the bigining of the video for the voice
This was the most disturbing thing I’ve ever seen
I clicked on the video before reading the title and that intro activated my fight or flight response
As a fan of both R&M and GMM... this episode was terrible.
They should have tried to make Szechuan sauce.\n\nBtw... I thought this channel was family friendly xD
Eating brain tissue alters your protiens and could kill you
How about a taste test of snort fe ski dm mid JIMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYY
Rhett complains about his vocal cords, then proceeds to do a rick impression. Genius. 🙄
for future EPs: washing animals' organs with vinegar help that inside smell go away, taste a lot better too
omg i <3 rick and morty type in type in wubbalubba dub dub
Where was that bug ice cream though?
Get on out of here with mah eye holes
My boy Chase needs a raise.
if you eat you own intestine are you count as a cannibal? or something else? (sorry for bad spelling)
Good job Ro!!! Looks really good for Halloween too
do other people pronounce fondant like fuhduh or just them?
I dont know about that morty impression -_-
Ah yes i see more normals have been sent to the beyond superhuman level of intelligence by watching rick and morty
If the voice actor for Rick ever dies, I can sleep well at night knowing we have Rhett as a backup.
If your comment sucks and lacks originality just do\n\n\n\nThis.\n\nbecause if people have to click read more they are 3x as likely to click like *heavy ass eye roll*
Wh...what happened to family friendly gmm? God help us....
Cow intestines are good af, especially in tacos
Literally JUST ate a wafer cookie. I also was eating peanut butter on the peanut butter episode, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE???!!
Binging with babish is great btw. Check his channel out.
What a sport you are Chase!
Mind your own god damn business jean
Am I the only one that always Google what they tell not to Google??
This was GREAT!!! Please do a Bob’s Burgers version! That would be epic.
This episode makes me so happy
This show is not for vegans.
Wow with the creativity here! Well done crew!
What happened to the fall décor. I guess this is not a fall episode. Lol
I hate how they say we we we we,  when it's the crew an they just do as they're told
Do dragon tail next\n(for all yall weebs out there)

This episode took a weird turn.
This video is way too smart for me
I'm going to have nightmares tonight!!!!

Watching this Rick and Morty video made me smarter.
O.o glow in the dark DSL's!
Hi I’m back sorry didn’t get a response on the last comment but here it is.were Rhett and link the Wright brothers in epic rap battles of history ?
Hey how about you guy try food from the anime call food wars and the full name is food wars shokugeki no soma.\n\nEdit Note: they tell the ingredients that use to make the food in the anime\n\nAnother note: Hope your clothes explode
*has almost thrown up, skips to the end as fast as possible, drops phone and runs to go throw up, sobs* poor chasterbunny leprechaun. *is now scared to watch GMmore*
2030 is only 12 years away 😲
I love how they are running out of ideas and need more views so they put the hottet tv show out there as there video topic
There is rarely a #GMM episode that does make the #trending list
Wow. You guys are such conformists omg...\njk love the show and R&M. Keep it up boys.  \nAnd does Chase get paid enough for this?
0/10. unrealistic. nobody burst in to stop them eating eye-holes.
Anyone else think this should have been a collab video with Rosanna Pansino (Nerdy Nummies)?
can't you do will it toothpaste ?
You Should Do A Will It Poptart, Please. 👍👍
GJ, my kids wanted to eat dog food....now If I buy lucky Sharms they want to eat me.  Please do more episodes where you eat dog food.  It was saving me a lot of money on kid food.
you guys need to do something about the chewing noises
this just makes me feel uncomfortable

STOP ADVERTISING THE F****NG BOOK!
Link is such a sad example of a man
The impressions in this episode are so cringe
Who else got a rick and Morty ad on this?
I knew there would come a day when this show hit rock bottom. \n\nBottom, meet rock.
I don’t think they watch rick and morty
i can now die
Excuse me, no Szechuan sauce?\n\n\n\n\n\nP.s I know I spelt Szechuan wrong probably

crystal is defiantly a lesbian
Crystal was the only one who actually tryed not to break the law lmfao.
Pretty sure traffic accidents aren't illegal
Crystal is having that patience that i’m looking for in a girl ;D that’s like +3 out of the fictional “10”
It was not that hard but, probably for entertainment.
Did you steal this video as well?
Crystal won the best citizen award.
Black guy lost of course
Garrick broke a law for his Taxi crashing?
I wrote a blog post a while ago about why I fucking hate video games. Because this is what it does, it like appeals to the male fantasy.
What happened to gta being the worst game ever
Sydnee is such a moron she is a down
@ 4:00 is that the background music from Funhaus videos?
So they learnt nothing and still into violence. Pretty good game i would say.
Are they even trying?
Play Mario without breaking any laws
the brunette is fine as hell
I don't know what he called me, he said somthing 😂
Lol on trending page this has 666k views
The black guy done the most crimes\n\n\n\n\n\nWow
Of course the black guy committed the most crimes
dam sydnee is so beautiful future wife
There is a mod that forces you to obey traffic laws by spawning police cars into traffic and fining red lights, speeding, any kind of accident and in general any misbehaviour. Combined with the mod that enables using steering wheels  you get a pretty near realistic driving experience.
This is a very timely video, coincides with the game's release 4 years ago.
This wasn't trying at all
Not sure if Crystal is 42 or 24
Some of these shouldn't have even been counted, like when the car crashed into him and the taxi hitting someone, he doesn't control the AI, so why did he get penalized?
5:54 is me whenever I try to do anything. 😹
Am I the only person that enjoys obeying the traffic laws in GTA?? 😂😂😂😂
Nice try but not so good
Wow, nobody has ever done this before! Great, original content Buzzfeed!\n\n\nFucking cacks.
making my way down town walking fast faces past and im homebound dodoododoodododo (hits person with car) um sorry i was listenng to mah music
I play like this on a daily basis.
Admit it we all did this when we got bored
I could probably do that. It would be difficult, but not impossible.
crystal could totally be a model. cute face n eyes.
How da f hasn't done this?!?
That’s how my sister plays lol
I know this idea has been done so many times before. But I still find it funny every time people do it 😂
Of course Buzzfeed makes a video about not breaking any laws when they support Antifa and all they do is break the law.
I did this all the time in midnight club
Crystal was the only one atleast trying
Its not that hard to obey the law in this game. There is definitely a reason these people are being complete and utter idiots.
I usually play gta without breaking the laws cause its fun
Wonder how much crap they would get if they had all colored people playing lmao
Lol a black man trying to not break a law.
Your black you already broke Lifes biggest law
Crystal is too good for this earth
You didn’t obey the law actually
Get the peeps from the rp servers over to buzzfeed
drive safely and don't kill ppl
mom, how many times have I told you that you can choose what you want to do!
Honestly it's 1 of my dreams for an open world game like GTA to be alot more realistic like following traffic laws & such yet it's still like a crime game of course lol the more realistic & immersive the better! Tho I do think it should be a separate difficulty like just making the entire game life like realistic aka a true realistic difficulty!
This is why I hate video games, because they appeal to the male audience🙄
“Somebody, I know somebody did this in the video, don’t.. don’t do the stars”
when you saw the score at 3:27 what should you think about at the fist?
So she played the game, but doesn't even know that the white car is franklin's car? 🤔
WHAT IS THIS VIDEO TRYNA SAY HUH, BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE MOST VIOLENT!!!????? jk
They're hella doing this on purpose
Admit it u have tried it.
I wrote a blog post a while ago about why I fucking hate video games, because this is what it does! It appeals to the male fantasy!
It's not his fault if his taxi crashed dip shits
For some reason I thought they meant not breaking irl laws while playing gta
You broke the law  Much in gta that even of you walk, your just breaking the law
Oh and of course buzzfeed the black guy gets all the crimes
Why did you guys give Garrick a strike for the  taxi driver breaking the law
should be watch a movie right....?
See? The black man committed the most crimes.\n\nJk it was probably just a coincidence
We tried playing Grand Theft Auto 5 without the male fantasy.
WHY CAN'T YOU USE TURN SIGNALS?!?
The Black guy break the most rules . What a surprise
is that even possible?
http://checkgirlxxx.info/13_bimretug88.html
Good job crystal
Crystal won.
Omg you guys are so bad

The kid who peed with both his pants and underwear down happened to me too
Today the teacher was teaching us about anecdotes, and I didn’t know what it was so I was like James probably knows, so I went to your channel and I was like, “woah James can read my brain.”
or how to pick a good president oh my god
that first anecdote. is so weird cuz think its something not veryone comes across. but everyone does see that type of person
0:30 this was a conversation with my math teacher irl :P
One reason I hate math because of the Show your work thing. Like, in school I'm learning how to find the answer to an algebraic expression or whatever (Idk it is boring) and you have to do so much work to find an answer you could get in first grade! I hate school, I'm gonna be honest, I f*cking hate it..
Who was here before this was on trending?
I had to write a 5 page paper on a math-related book for my AP Stats class when I was in high school! AND I had to do it over the Summer before the class even began! TAKE THAT JAAAMESSS!\n\n<3
WE HAVE PASSED DOMICS IN SUBSCRIBERS, I REPEAT WE HAVE PASSED DOMICS.
I...I thought you liked math and were good at it ?\n\nYou'll know how to find the curve of a graph or know old timey Shakespherean works.\n\nPssh. I won't remember any of that in a week. Or the next day.... till test time... maybe.
Oh it was never about whether I used it or not, it was Why do I have to be treated like trash just because I don't like to study?
I almost got detention for yelling out “SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!”. 😂
btw once this guy said he needed to go to the toilet in my class and on the way out he pee'd his pants!
Math is like sex the more you do it the better you get...always distrust what everyone says & you last longer
oh boi here I go shipping again
THIS ViDEO IS ON TRENDING!!OMG!!3 million views!!!
Is it just me or do you think that TheOdd1sOut could do a dope Morty impression if he tried xD
WTF  I SAW SANS!!!!\n\nEDIT: oh it was just my loading mouse.
I'll tell you how to use trigonometry!Gimme ur phone' says some muggerNo good sir, for I have the power of triangles!!
I SCREAMED INTERNALMY WHEN I SAW DAVE AND INMEDIATELY UNDERSTOOD THE JOKE I NEVER THOUGHT THIS COLLAB WOULD HAPPEN THANK YOU SO MUCH JAMES AND DAVE AAAAHHHH
Actually in every math test we have,we are always required to write essays 😒
I use the math I used in school on a daily basis (mostly geometry) and I also have to know all the Shakespeare plays that I read in school too... But that is cause I'm going to college to be a costume designer for theatre.  Also congrats on being on the trending page!
1:20\nI see what you did there, James. \nThat earth has some suspicious looking green things....
Are we just all going to ignore the fact that the girl at 3:25 has a speaking part, but no mouth?
I live in AZ too and our detention is called care too
Can you please stop hating on Trump in your videos, kinda unprofessional
How the fuck does Dave knows every single person in this platform?!?
Math sucks it’s just terrible I’d rather write essays.
Why are all the recommended vids about the Old Testament?!? Lmao
Dave’s face, though. 😂
Hiiii, please react ❤ (love)  in the original video!☺ Your love reaction will be much appreciated. It's for our grades! Thank you. God Bless!😁\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2381319982093428&id=100006463473665
If you pull down your pants and extras just to pee (if youre a guy), youre being a horrible human being and no one is gonna like being around you.
I did a really loud burp  once.in class.the class had my class and another class in it.and it was quiet
Id' rather write essays than do math o.0
Another one of jaidens ideas got taken from james and it's trending
Its true that you don't use the stuff you learn in school cuz the other day I dissected a FLOWER
3:16\nI asked my friend about this, and he said nope and walked away.\nYeah, this guy is Asian too. O.o
I just bought some seedless grapes today.\n\n\n\n\n\n*THEY HAVE FUCKING SEEDS! THIS MUST BE THE TEACHERS' FAULT!*
in primary school I was a straight-a student in math. in secondary school there where problems with our teacher and for a while it was really chaotic. I stopped paying attention since I didn't know what was going on anymore. besides, everyone else was bad at math and hated it and didn't even try so I thought it was normal and did the same. it was only last summer I realized that I still am good at math, and now I'm suddenly a straight-a student again because I stopped telling myself I couldn't do it.\nthis 'i can't do math so I why should I bother' mindset is so dangerous, of course you can't do it when you don't even try.
Someone made a remix about you.
You may have spelled school wrong at the beginning of the video for English people, but in MY language its spelled right😂
Ladies, if you cant pee while standing, you're missing out... K....
Im realky good at math BUT I DON'T LIKE IT THAT IM THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS MATH REALLY GOOD AT CLASS (even better than the teacher! She always makes mistakes!)
The odd1sout what is your favorite game and what console do you play on? or do you not play at all?
Keep up the good work James :D
Funny thing\nMy old primary school is now an academy\nAlso good vid james
*James before Youtube*: IMMA BE A MATH TEACHER!!\n*James on Youtube*: SCREW MATH!!!
EXCUSE ME BUT I HAVE TO WRITE ESSAYS IN MATH AND IT FRICKIN SUCKS.
This is really relatable because I'm reading to kill a mockingbird on L.A😂😂
I have seen adults piss like that...
Do you like overwatch i've seen refrences in some of your videos
my teacher run's around the classroom and sit's crossed-legged on the table's and when we get our answer wrong he corners up in a corner of the room like its so scaryy 😂
C. A. R. E.\nIt stands for, “Cry And Rethink Everything.”
Hmm\nLet’s try to find a penny in a trash bin until the next video!
I got the boy in a band reference straight away 😂 \n*likes own comment*
3:00  when you get 4.000.000 views on 2 days ... And you still play it nice!
At 0:51 its not e^(pi.i+1) its e^(pi.i)+1
This video describes how I felt all throughout high school.
Math is so easy and I'm in 8th grade and it seems like 5th grade math
I watched dave's video like ... a while ago
Dude, your art quality seriously skyrocketed in this episode! This makes your other videos look like shit, and I mean that in the best way possible.
I thought this channel was dead.
Humanity is the worst.
The best things about this video were his drawings of the animals. Laughed my ass off at the lions
I appreciate how you inserted yourself into an elephant's trunk to help take the edge off all this casual cruelty.
I love this channel and honestly understand the long wait, i mean he just took a break. I also love the improved animation that this channel has now. Keep up the good work
The madman is back.
*PAPA UPLOADER HOLY SHIT. AFTER I JUST FAPPED TOO? ROUND TWO HERE I CUM*
_Sorry this took so long to get out, I've just been really busy is all, except that I haven't been busy at all and also I'm not sorry_\n\nwell *f*ck you too <3*\n\n\nIm kidding I love you
Wow Casey Neistat calls YouTube out on their trending page and all of the sudden creators are getting on it instead of advertisers. Crazy coincidence.
I might be drunk but seeing the words poo chicken together just made my night
welp already finished the video see ya in 7 months
Finally a new vid! I've been so excited!
the only catch is that someone has to die at the end 😂
I feel like a part of this moment with you man. Subcribed after watching some videos a month ago and now you're trending! Congrats man!
Hey man I missed you
Holy shit 400K+ subs? Man I remember when you had around 24K subs man!

Somewhere there is a vegan who watched this video now, curled up, in the fetal position, sucking their thumb, tear rolling down their face...
Yay you're trending. Glad to see that you are getting the views you deserve.
MY BITCH IS BACK! 10/10
MY SIDES ARE IN FUCKING ORBIT.
It's about time
Been with you since 50k love your vids. My favorite has to be the dairy castro one.
Cool vid but the trump thing lmaooo ppl listen to him anyway have you seen his rallies? Oh wait the media refused to show how many supported him so I guess that was omitted
Well Dude, I can say I eas here after you get 500mill subs, You are the best
Also, congrats on trending holy shit you're famous now
Please don’t leave again
Wait, wouldn't the elephant that cried and screamed at the crowd be chained up? Otherwise a couple pointy sticks isn't gonna do shit against an angry monster the size of a truck
I thought the ancient Romans were also into bestiality?? Since they fuck everything that had or didn't have a pulse..
2:13 whatever... make it a meme.
Really gross, humans have been assholes to animals for thousands of years . hope we get what we deserve soon. (I know I am a human but I'd rather reincarnate as a tiger)
GOD HAS PRESENTED TO US ART! Praise THY SAM
When he brought up the reaction of the crowd during the elephant torture it reminded me of people today. They’ll watch humans die right in front of their eyes but are more worried about a animal.. Just saying. Not saying animals are less ✌️ The animal is more of an example of “smaller problems” those people were crazy if that were all true. They had s thing called “Damnatio Ad Bestias” but we’re sorry for the elephant 😂😂
I wish I could have been there to watch these things.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOh shut the fuck up you want to watch too, stop lying to yourself
He lives, and trends as well
Congrats for trending, good luck to you
I’m glad to see you blow up. I remember first finding the real small channel now 422k
Im loving the greater detail in the drawings
I...am not comfortable...with all this, this, SHADING, and ANIMATION. WHAT?!
Rip the elephant. But not the monkeys. Galen did what he had to.
YESSSSS THE LEGEND IS BACK!
OH SHIT MY FAVORITE ANIME IS BACK
earned 100k subs for one video hot dam
Nice editing.\n\nThat's a word, it sounds wrong.\n\n*[EDIT]* - I meant editing, not nice.\n\n*[EDITED]* - By not nice, I meant that I wasn't referring to the word nice.
Samonella doesn’t come often, and not for long when he does. But when he does, he hits hard and fucking gets #5 on trending.
It's ironic how Romans called others barbarians when they were more barbaric than everyone else.
Sam o'nella is back!! Spread the word!!
I clicked because I'm learning Latin but I might quit cause this depressed me
Oh thank God he uploaded. I thought I wouldn't get to jack off today

RLY I KILL UR 1$ Dog LOL Killer
They are good dogs bront.
The ending tho :)
cough cough buzzfeed
Just a toy
this is greeeat
So jenna marbles dogs were only 1 dollar
At 1:18 it triggered my Siri
Are u chinese?
Shit video quality. Disappoint.
*dont breath that*
His ok google enabled by ok google wtf???
All dogs are precious
58/10
Learn your unbox skills from Idubbz??
LMFAO
i got le $1 doggo
2:21 😧😧
*This video was cruel and pointless. It doesn't matter if it's a $1 dog or a $1 million dog. It is still a human being, it still feels pain and love. It doesn't deserve to be treated like an object*
Why is he so abusive to the doggies in the box?? GET YO SHEIT TOGETHER
Today's episode was brought to you by PETA! (Lmao)
90% of the people here are normies that think this was actual from buzzfeed
I lowkey thought this was going to be a buzzfeed roast fest, or a jab a Jenna marbles. Needless to say, I was quite happy with the content
My alexa heard you and said that she likes you too, but as a friend.
I have a dog like those dogs!!! She was $1000, lol. Her name is Sushi!! <3
They're both good dogs, Jake.
but in all seriousness....what is the breed
i’ll take your one dollar dog
was this just ur to roast ur dog without seeming too mean
At least it’s better than what Jenna has
Horrible .   The rich need 2 feel important
but what I really wanna see is the bts for this vid
The ending lol,  completely made the already- great video even greater.
Some one will eventually jailbreak it. You will be able to play NES games on it at least
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time!\n\nUnsubscribed.
if I actually try your shitty sponsors for once will u give me sundae
Give me views and likes
Wttffff. When Jack said okay Google,  the Google thing on android phones came up
He was hurting the dogs!!!!!!
I honestly thought the $1 dog was going to be Cement
You kill the dogs!
Funny thing is, is that the $1 is in better condition it has no leaking eye but the obedience of the $10,000 dog is amazing.
That Will It Blend throwback  is LIFE GIVING.
Okay you guys got to be very careful ''stabs a knife through the Box'' that part got me lol.
LOL WHEN HE STABBED THE BOX I INSTANTLY REMEMBERED THAT ONE SCENE FROM HAUNTED HOUSE 2
I can't believe he missed this opportunity to pick on Jenna marbles dawgsssss? rookie mistake Jack...rookie mistake
How did this loser get this video in the trending topic
Shit that lame joke was milked and milked and milked.....
Only two dogs were harmed in the making of this film.
Tune in next time for a review of the $1 dog and the Marble dog.
Lol that dog remind me of the one my german shepard killed lol but in its defence it entered my yard becuase of careless owner ...so id say that pricy one has poor defence ....lol
The new software update on the 1 dollar dog bricks it. I have tried multuiple version of dog but it looks like a fan made cat worked. But it does not work like a dog anymore. any tips?
I bought a $2000 dog and it had a processor error and the geeksquad said it was having seizures? Anyone know how to fix? I filed an rma but corsair wont respond
I never laughed this hard in my life xD\nF@cken Great Job!
Holy shit was that a will it blend? Joke?
If only the 1$ dog was one of jenna's dogs...
This is the content i subbed for. \n2007 squad <3
https://m.soundcloud.com/user_lil_g420/dark-hole\n\nThis aint my soundcloud lmao but it deserves some love...
The will it blend joke was the best part for sure
I thought he was going pull out jenna's doggos
It's my lucky day! can I get a sub?
Meanwhile on Austin Evans channel:\n WHY DOES A DOG EXIST IN 2017?
i thought the $1 dog was gonna be icarlys long necked dog or whoever that girl is, jenga marvel or somelike it
The hey Siri turned on my phone Siri.
Because you said _Hey Siri_ so much, it made Siri on MY phone do that double beep thing where it listens for instruction... 😑
Pls it kept making my Siri go off.
Just steal someones dog on the low
Put the dogs together u Fucking lair
I lost it when he said compusa
Bro what kind of a dog is that? Think is so fucking cute
I expected a picture of Jenna Marbles dogs. I'm disappointed Jack.
Aww, that’s cu—oh okay now they’re raping each other
I was waiting for the $1 dog to be Jenna marbles dogs
My dog is literally EXACTLY like the $1 dog, except he's small, black, and not furry xD\nThis video was so funny, after I saw it I got my entire family together with my dog so we could watch it while laughing at how accurate it is.
$1 vs $120 pornhub premium account
$1 Video vs $10.000 Video
You forgot to charge it
Who was expecting Jenna's dog?
I'm I'm probs not the first to say this but...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Abuse!!!
This is Benjamin don’t let him drown in the comments save a fucking life
I was watching this on the phone and he activated Siri by saying hey Siri lol
Sponcered by PETA😂😂😂😂\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n😂Who did this?😂
Pls do a review on Pewdiepie's dogs.
You shouldn't have to pay for dogs at all\nWe're giving them a loving home, stop it
I will actually get the 1 dollar dog
If I were a dog I would be the $1 one
YouTuber are running out of ideas

Knee slap.(grammar joke))whats up with these parenthesis? Its been like at least 20 minutes since i first started typing this. Okay i think the jokes are good so ill stop now.Yeah. ok bye.yeah. ok. Ok.good.youll enjoy reading this. Yeah they will definitely laugh like im laughing now. I do \nSo much good for the world guys.ok now yeah.ok. now im ready to post it and read it and hopefully ill laugh again and not feel anxiety about a potential employer finding it and being blacklisted in the whatever ya know even tho ive never had a job .yeahno yrah is better.well we'll not well well l'll just have to wait and see. Im high u guys .this is great. Im just gonna post it.ok.yeah. never mind let me update u i just looked at the clock and it said 12:21 and if remember correctly the first time i looked at the clock is when i said itd been at least 20 minutes and it was 12:20 it was really only 1 minute. thought putting that in there would be funny. Or maybe itd been 12:12. Ok idk. Im done with this. Okay i just went back up to read it again to make sure it is still funny but idc anymore. Yeah. Im just gonna exist  out. And not post it. But the ln ill wish i didnt. Ill be sad cuz ived been tyling for like 6 minutes seems like 30 and think no one is gonna ever see this so why not. Yeah but i dont want some one to see it and print it out to use against me in a court of law or an arguement of some grade. This is actually relaxing just sittin here diaryin publicy on youtube. Ok .ok..............thats enough. I jsut cant put it down. The little vibration of the letter on my touch screen phone ia so soothing, calming, relaxing. Ok.ok. before i go.. anyones who reads this. Lets all give my slightly ever so slight OCD brain biggups/props/snaps for not allowing whatever part of my multidimensional being to not allow for typos to happen. Capital lock. YEAH BABY!CUZ ITS ok caps unlock its actually so easy to make a just did it typing mistake just did it again on mistake. And not be able to leave it there.omg im still typing. Ok. Ok.ok stop. Im juat typing ok. My thoughts now. Ok. Dammit. Just did it again when i went up to reread it and saw a space beetween the u and the s in one of those justs up there.

Oh yeah and did i mention im not using swipe im typing my nigga.with two thumbs phone facing long ways.ok .bye.ok.
dope
chef john mentions binging with babish in his master of pun series, pot-sticker dumpling clip.
This channel is like the V-sauce of cooking
I think your sweating the garlic and shallots, compared to sautéing them which would be high heat. Sweating it’s slow and low making aromatics come out clearly.
I love you man! thank you!
You  want to find a video on the basics of sauces, go find a Gordon Ramsey video on sauces. Not this joke of an idiot.
is it just me or the colors edit of the vertical cam is way more vibrant than the horizontal one the sauce looks almost orange ont the horizontal cam wile the virtical one is perfect
ive never heard of someone not liking cilantro lol
You should try to re create a dish from the new South Park game.
I love the tutorial style videos, thanks for this man! Very informative.
I got lost in this episode
Checkout my food review
That mango is not ripe 🙄
cheese sauces are gross
When you came out with your first teaching video, I said to myself Yes! Finally he does a strictly teaching video. But I didn't say anything then. Just wanted to let you know that you're a appreciated. Thanks man.
Your face! You showed your face! 😱
Greatest channel on YouTube
I like you Sir I live can’t stand that green demand!\n\nKeep up the great work my friend
Make a good burger from the movie good burger
Can you make the Potage le Magnifique from Skyrim? It's the dish you poison when you attempt to assassinate the Emperor in the Dark Brotherhood questline.
Ain't nobody got Thyme for that 😏😏😏
Being able to see your face is really unsettling
Liquid sauce.\n\n\n\n\nNo ketchup.
Sup Babs....I bought the same chef knife you recommend but it's going blunt a little. What should I buy.. a sharpening stone or one of those drive through sharpeners? Fankoo!
My new favorite channel
Where's lamb sauce!
Congrats @bingingwithbabish for your Chef John @foodwishes shout out!
I love Cheese Sauces and pasta! Can't wait to try it.
Can you do more bobs burgers burgers
really liking and appreciating this new content, keep making more, thank you
could you do a video on chillis and dishes to make with them, my mum bought a carolina reapers without knowing the heat
Continuing to hit it out of the park so far! If I might make a suggestions, however: 1) As mentioned below, there are a couple of terms mentioned in the episode - i.e. deglazing, reducing - that a lot of people take for granted. Although a full-blown recipe might not be needed to justify it, I feel it would be good to take a minute or so to explain the basic science behind each of these terms - next week's steak episode, for instance, would be the perfect time, since pan sauces and steak go hand in hand. 2) Sauces, as mentioned in this episode, are one of the foundations of good cooking, and you've hit upon two of the five mother sauces - bechamel and tomato. If only to introduce everyone to the other three, I think another sauce episode should be considered for the future - veloute (offers an excuse to talk about thanksgiving gravy), espagnole (brown sauce for fries), hollandaise (who doesn't like a nice plate of eggs benedict)?
Wow. That's a huge change in quality
As a Mexican, seeing pico de gallo being called salsa is making me feel weird.
The red sauce was good, even though I forgot the butter!
Please stop butchering salsa by adding fruit and a ton of other random shit. Salsa is about simplicity and spice, this is actually not based off of salsa either, but pico de gallo. This is just an insult to Mexican cuisine.
Congrats on trending, my dude!
Love this thank you for thinking of this idea !
I love this stuff, keep it up!
Hey Babish, have you ever considered opening your own brick and mortar restaurant in Harlem NYC?
How does Babish only have 1 million subs! He should have more!!! A thousand times better than any Logan Paul or Jake paul video. Babish at least educates you in delious food delights with that smoother than jazz voice of his. Hell he should have a TV show on prime tv!
Oh man I love this so much
Marry me.
I always add a finely chopped onion to my baked mac n cheese I find that it sweetens the flavor.
That one tomato left behind bothered me greatly
hey i know this isn’t a tv or movie recipe but can u do those loft house frosted cookies bc they are so freaking good
god I gotta make that mac n cheese
The tint in the two cameras are different. Like a red would look orange. Then again I might have flaring color blindness
Ğ
do u wanna marry me
The intro music was rather jarring, I'd prefer you go back to cream on chrome. It made everything more peaceful and easier to watch and listen to. That said, I can't believe how quickly you went from 10k when I started, to where you are now. You're so close to getting the cooking show I said you deserved way back then. Good luck bud!
Salsa is cooked, Pico de gaillo is what he showed how to make
Babish, one suggestion I'd tell you is to lay out the ingredients here, in a video prior to the livestream. This will definitely help people follow along and get them prepared! Love the videos, make sure you also record (on your own camera) the stream, twitch can sometimes delete old streams and I'm sure you'd like to keep a tutorial around :)
https://youtu.be/Wt04BZlyYzI
Triple goober Sunday
ive decided to call u babbo. thx <3
Awesome video!
I've always found white onion to be more onion-ey/less sweet, than red onion. Are my tastebuds FUBARed, or should I buy at a different location?
Thanks for making these great videos. I really need your help in the kitchen esp w sauces. Keep up the great work.
You should try making Ube Roll from Steven Universe. Love your channel. ♥️
I'm 16 and i don't even cook. Why am I watching this and why is it so entertaining?
Me before watching the video: why are your videos so popular, especially your second video!\nAfter watching: NEVER-MIND!!!
Are we using cold or warm milk in the becahmel?
started off really pure and wholesome but the butter knob orgy really turned me off towards the end :-( sad react :-( (overall I did like it tho not a troll)
I would really like to see you do a tomato sauce from scratch (i.e. without canned tomatoes or tomato paste).
Black pepper in a bechamel?! GASP
this is not only orgasmic to foodies and people who want to learn about basics...but english majors who are noticing the beautiful transitioning between topics and beautiful use of mouth watering adj haha...\n\nthree in one learning vid!
best food channel in my opinion
What’re his credentials for teaching?.. Has he ever been a chef, professionally?
Create a mcgangbang
Raw sauce.
#19 on Trending :)
Hope you got the sauce boss's permission before making this video!
amature hour
You're the man. Thanks!
YESSSS!! This is what all aspiring cooks need. This and a stainless steel pan
I've been looking for a tomato sauce recipe all week. I legit just finished saying Man, I wish Babish had a recipe. Two minutes later I find this episode while scrolling through my subscriptions... THANK YOU!!!!!!
Chef John from Food Wishes actually gave Babish a mention in his latest video....you are after all the Binging with Babish of your cabbage.
Could you recommend an alternative to red wine for your halal fans?
Dear Americans is HERBS not ERBS
Bread crumbs on top of mac & cheese is blasphemy.
You need a new mic it sounds like my ears are clogged :/
It's all about the knife babish son
Love! Please keep making this series
Awesome content! Love the series. Great stuff man, keep it up!
Pro tip for pressing guarlic, dont remove the skin, works just as fine with it, and makes it easier to clean :)
Yo babish how do you make larger quantities of the pan sauce? It looked like you only got a tiny bit out of the fond that was there
Now I'm starving. Thanks a lot, guy.
Any chance of a written form of any of these??? You know for free on the website..... For FREE
It's so weird to see your face
Great video as always and I am soon buying the book. \nOne suggestion, try not too garnish with full sprigs of herbs. Looks beautiful but its unpleasant too eat.\nKeep it up Babish! Peace!
Make a Baking with Babish. I recommend🙂
No Sauce\nJust Raw Sauce
Did you get a new mic or something? This video sounds extra crisp
Your salsa is also called pico de gallo which basically just means it's made with fresh tomatoes.
motherfucker you look like fucking ryan reynolds
I HATE cilantro.  TERRRIBLEEEE\nI know you want to build a channel with speed while still giving the information but when it comes to salsa, you talk about balancing out sweet flavors with earthy flavors and aeromatics(sp?).  It just seemed quick with no real explanation as to WHY you add green onion to a sweet flavor.
WHERES.............. ThE lAmBSAUUUUUCCCEEE
When politicians talk about diversity, what they always mean is fewer White people.\nWhen they say Diversity is our greatest strength, what they mean is White people are our greatest weakness.\nDiversity means chasing down every last White person.\nDiversity is a codeword for White genocide.\nAnti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.
that isnt even salsa, that is Pico de Gallo. Salsa is a true SAUCE
I think pink has had a few catchy songs but mostly easily forgettable.
She stabbed someone's tires and she deals with differences by getting physical? Pink sounds like trash.
The feud is one sided. Pink has always been petty and jealous of xtina. Youtube the video of her molesting a blow up doll dressed as Christina and mocking/degrading it. Yea, Pink is a pig.
I love Pink so much! She looks stunning and I really love her hair.
Why is the next button not working on this video?!?!
Why would anyone wear their hair like that? LULLz
This is trending because of the Kanye mention.
Just by the hair i thought it was jake paul
If pink was a chick id smash
It's P!nk ... did you honestly think she wouldnt be honest? P!nk is super honest
Imagine if Pink didn't find it hilarious, Xtina would have been wrecked.
Pink, Xtina, Briney and Beyonce are the REAL OG ❤️❤️
You know singers are desperate for promo when they go on Andy Cohen....
Only Pink I know IS PINK FUCKING FLOYD.!!!
Pink looks so hot with that hair style.  I would bang her while her husband went out for cigarettes.  Pink is the epitome of cool.  She has been fearless since childhood.  She is a self made millionaire.  She doesn't take shit from anyone.  She reminds me of Leah Remini  but with a more feminine, less confrontational personality.  That balance is what makes her cool.
I love Pink's subtle, passive-aggressive shade. It's interesting that Christina swung on her, I can only imagine it the other way around. Pink did not take that seriously AT ALL lol.
Of all of the horrible things coming out of Hollywood and the music industry lately, Pink is one of the good things.
This guy is an idiot
Christina Aguilera all the waaaaaaaaay! My girl for life ❤️❤️❤️❤️
What the flip? At 3:20 she’s STARTING BEEF! That little weasel!!!
Pink would sound better if she started admitting that she was the one who started it, calling Xtina names and everything, instead of repeating that Xtina tried to punch her, and coming with the we should support each other easy talk...
You folks don't still believe pink is a chick right?
Is it just me or does he always look cross-eyed?
1:53 straight to the point
Anyone know why Pinks life has been traumatic? Cancer, deaths, fought in war, shot, lost everything?
I hope it's a recent collaboration!! That would be soo amazing!!!
What in the guinea pig is going on with Pink's hair?
Isn't she the one from AGT OR BGT the one who yelled at the judges
Pink would've smashed Christina if they got into a fight.
How fun would it have been to watch that bar fight between p!nk and Christina? I love em both but my money would have been on p!nk... I can just see Christina staggering out with half her extensions missing and a busted lip.
How I wish she would have spoken the truth about Kanye West STILL being a piece of shit.
Huh, interesting. Pink's outspoken and intelligent and feisty. Knew that. But she's also smart enough to admit she can be mistaken, and apologize, make up, and move on. That makes me respect her more. -- And Pink and Chirstina Aguilera on a song collaboration? Cool, more, please. I like 'em both. (Impressed that they could settle things, be adult and smart about it, and go from there. That's good. Yeah, growing up, even as a young adult, is not easy...still learning this, too.
Christina was obviously threatened by PINK's voice. I never liked Christina. Always loved pink. Xo
I’ve always liked Pink’s face. She reminds me of every bartender ever about to say “what can I get for ya, hon?”
Christina's lucky Pink didn't swing back. There'd be no Christina. BAHAHAHAAA
Shes fights verbally yet she swung on you 😂😂😂😂 I love pink tho 💓
I can only guarantee one thing, Christina Aguilera is NOT pink.. #thatsdirty
Wait, isn’t this the person that got mad on AGT?
Pink vs Christina. Dana you bald pig make it happen.
The word ‘alpha’ was a made-up term from the mid 1970s after a wildlife expert poised the popular term in a book, plus, Pink can be such a tool at times but I find myself liking her regardless! 😂
Isnt she the 1 one who was on the voice and get extremly mad about simon saying that she was trash?
this is like the j-lo a d Mariah Carey competition.  Mariah Carey response was always  I don't know her \n\n.always behind scenes .. never once did they sit in interviews wasting precious promotion time to disrespecting each other \n.or make shitty dis songs. \n\nthis is what you call being a class act  Katy Perry and Taylor swift please take notes .
IN ADDITION to the one-sided comments, which have been true. P!nk with her one-sided feud with Christina also tweeted on Twitter about Christina being pulled over for Public intoxication in 2011: ‘Out of myself, Britney and Christina – didn’t everyone think I was gonna be the troublemaker? Look Ma!!! No cuffs!!! Petty af! \n\nHad P!nk had let the shit go back when Lady Marmalade and Beautiful (which she also stated that Stripped was a carbon copy of her album missundaztood <- Yes she said it, P!nk said A LOT of shit about Christina) were done, it wouldn't have been a feud, and it wouldn't last that long. You notice P!nk said they hadn't talked in a while, because Christina didn't give a fuck. She was busy being happy with her own life and career (regardless of how people feel about it). She never publicly scrutinized P!nk after all these years. That's why it was so easy to let the beef go because Christina didn't give a fuck, and P!nk finally came to her senses to be a grown woman, and let it go.\n\nI mean her being a celeb, yes she can speak her truth. But you know when you make comments about this publicly it reignites the fuel of the feud. Regardless of if the two parties (The artist) have let it go, it starts a stan/fan war against the 2 artist's fanbase, and the person who didn't comment publicly the supposed perpetrator, gets a ton of backlash (Christina). So basically she started a feud with Christina again, publicly by involving others unsolicited opinions.
I've always wondered if Pink's pink is really pink or really, really pink.
Who's Andy Cohen? Never heard of em.
I don't know what's wrong with my browser the vids only from this channel have been just black screens with audio for the past few days :(
Andy totally fan-girled out over her the entire time. Can't say I've ever seen him like this with many other guests
Pink not in same league as Christina Aguilar.
One of Andy Cohen's eyes was on Pink. I don't know where the other one was wandering...
what's going on with her face????? something is not right????? drugs involved or too much smoking ?????her facial skin is all sagging and dull
This was fing...perfect.... she is so awesome.
Is that jake paul?
She's cringing just being on this shitshow
I can't believe Christina tried to DUFF OUT Pink. That's funny af. Pink is so fucking real.
Pink I want to tongue punch your fart box!
Pink is playing it safe these days lol.
why would she randomly take a swing in a club haha
I love Pink.  (Except for her obsessive need to be with a man who must, at all times, proves that he adores her, that is...)  Otherwise I love her music and her strength
Pink And Christina NEED to to perform Lady Marmalade again together.
This is why i love Pink
Either he has a lazy eye or he just can’t stop looking at that TelePrompTer
I love P!nk. Such a classy woman💕💕
She's from the burbs not from Philly. She doesn't even have the Philly accent.
she's so real, I love her
There is no beef.  Its all fake like every other one. Brainwashing these fools lol
a little bit of something for everybody? Business: http://tinyurl.com/y9zrlbm3 or pleasure: http://tinyurl.com/ybhunfwf or do you need to build your own website: http://bit.ly/2hE7AiA
My god she's nuts

Really glad I watched this. Still love P!NK. :’)
Thought Jake paul had made it onto this show for a second there
Hey, what ever happened to Avril Lavigne.
Why she has pubes on her head
Pink’s music NEVER DISAPPOINTS!
That's right Andy! She don't plead the 5th. That's MF Pink!!! Girl Power Personified!!!

Jesus is coming back real soon Jesus Loves U and he wants U to have a deep relationship with him and truly follow him. Following Jesus is the only way to make it to Heaven. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and give him your heart and soul. Jesus is the son of God who created us all, he is our Lord and Saviour. Jesus is God, he is one with the Father. (John 10:30) God sent Jesus to the Earth to die for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. The Bible tells us that if we believe in Jesus we will be saved but there are other things Jesus told us we have to do to be saved. We have to do his will. \nHere are the things we have to do to be saved and make it to Heaven. I'm gonna list the Bible scriptures for everything and U can read the scriptures yourself and do your own research.\n1. We have to believe that Jesus is is the son of God and that he is our Lord and Saviour. (John 3:16)\n2. We have to accept him as our Lord and Saviour and believe that God raised him from the dead. (Romans 10:9)\n3. Repent from all our sins. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\n4. Be baptized in the name of Jesus. (Acts 2:38)\n5. We have to have a deep relationship with him and pray to him and talk to him everyday. The only way to the Father is thru him. (John 14:6)\n6. Read the Bible and learn the word of God. (Joshua 1:8)\n7. Fast and pray. (Joel 2:12)\n8. Speak the word of God to the ppl of the world. (Mark 16:15)\n9. Do the Lord's will until we die. (Matthew 24:13)\nOn Judgement day when we go before Jesus there will be many ppl who have prayed to Jesus and even done things in his name and Jesus will say to them depart from me I never knew U and they will go to Hell. This is why We have to have a deep relationship with Jesus and try to do everything he told us to do cause thats the only way we will make it to Heaven. (Matthew 7:20-23). We all fall short of the Glory of God and we are all sinners. (Romans 3:23) This is why Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. (Peter 3:18) Without Jesus we are doomed to Hell. (John 3:36) When we disobey God and sin, God curses us. (Galatians 3:10) God punishes us and puts curses on us to make us obedient to him cause he Loves us and wants us to do right. (Hebrews 12:6) Jesus sets us free from curses when we truly follow him. (Romans 8:2) Quit following everything else in the world like the Government, religion, schools, science, TV, movies, radio, and everything else. (Colossians 2:8) That is all ran by the Devil and his worshippers, the Illuminati. They lie to U and deceive U. Them and the fallen Angels who got kicked out of Heaven with Satan are trying to lead U to Hell. (Ephesians 6:12) \nPut God 1st in your life. Never put anyone or anything before God, not your family friends job money or anything. (Matthew 6:33) If U Love Jesus then U hate evil. (Proverbs 8:13) Repent from all your sins. Pray to Jesus everyday. Pray to him for everything U need. (John 15:7) Pray to him and ask for forgiveness of your sins, thank him for everything. (Philippians 4:6)  Pray to him to heal U, give U peace, joy, strength, courage, protection, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, patience, direction, guidance, and for him to show U the truth. (Jeremiah 33:3) Do the Lord's will and he will answer your prayers.  (John 9:31) God gives us visions and he talks to us in dreams and shows us things. (Acts 2:17) When U die U will go before Jesus and he will judge U and either let U into Heaven or send U to Hell based on if U did his will. Those who don't do the Lord's will they will be sent to Hell. (Revelation 20:15) Hell is place where ppl will be punished and burn for eternity (Matthew 25:46) Heaven is a place that God has for the ppl who truly Love him. It is eternal paradise where U will be wit Jesus, the Angels, all the animals, and God's ppl forever. God says there will be no more death, we will have eternal life. We will not feel sorrow, we will not cry, and there will be no more pain. (Revelation 21:4) God says that we can't even imagine how amazing Heaven will be. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In Heaven we live forever, rejoice and be joyful forever. (Revelations 22:1-5)
I love all your videos but this might be one of your best vlogs ever! Favourite part was probably you driving because that' so bad ass! But also, you checking for spiders because we all do that. Hope your grandma feels better soon!
Awesome Vlog!
Granny's house :)
Fav moment was Ali's grandpa
I just love your positive attitude in ALL your videos, including this one and the love you have for Ali and Lumi (lumi is the Finnish word for snow btw) makes me on such a good mood for the day! I always save your videos for the next morning to start my day right! Apart from this video - I would love you to do either a blog post or a video about planning your wedding, after the wedding is totally fine. Like what did u do first, I know about the flowers and dresses and Jo Malone scents but I have absolutely no idea where to start with our 2019 wedding! We are meeting our wedding planner but like knowing what u did is prob as important as what the planner has to say. And I totally advised my maid of honor to watch your hen party video as an inspiration..... the weekend looked incredible! Lots of love from Finland!
She is your manager
You must film grandparents more!! I wish I had filmed my grandma when she was stil alive to have the memories saved forever. The mind forgets some parts but camera don't. :D Oh and loved Ali's grandpa's reaction to ferrari. :D
I so enjoyed this video, you are such a genuine person! Xoxo Stacy ❤
I love your vlogs every part is my favorite part..your positivity and smile and kind heart is contagious and im not even complaining like you go girl! Much much love from kurdistan❤️
Aw you and your bestie ☺️ looking super adorable in the bathroom mirror.. lol like high school
Girl that coat is EVERYTHING. I need your wardrobe budget pronto!
Did anyone catch the name of the restaurant?
Always enjoy your interactions with Ali in the vlogs actually. Also your flawless makeup sheesh! Fav part of this video is seeing how much joy spending time with your friends and families brings you
Ali’s Nan’s house literally made me feel cozy while watching in Ohio! Lovely vlog, Lydia! Looking so forward to Vlogmas! xoxo
When you describe your reaction when people turn around to see whats going on 😂 hope you get your own Ferrari soon
Love all the dainty diamonds in ur ears, so pretty 💎 I think a little diamond would look gorgeous in ur nose too. I love nose piercings. Thanks for another great vid, they could all be 4hrs long & it still wouldn’t be long enough!! 🤣 xx💖
You driving the Ferrai was the most dope thing I've seen you do this month (let's exclude any makeup event cause by Terry and reaching 500k was also epic) ❤❤
Honey chile diamonds are my birthstone! I love the piercing. I love family! The piercing in your with the gorgeous earring, what is that called? Visiting Ali's people!
Just finished watching the vlog and loved watching you drive the Ferrari but most importantly what you said about being able to share moments like those with your family because of your job ❤️ you’re my inspiration Lydia 🤗
Didn't realise you had a sister? Would love to see her in one of your vlogs. X
Love your videos, but please stop saying autumnal! You have said it way too many times over the past few weeks. Died laughing when you said, You know when nothing tinkles your fancy? However, Lumi is the total star always. Love her so much!!! ❤️
ALRIGHT whose buying me the jacket
fab video, love your channel! x
What was the nail colour you had on before you changed it? It was the perfect burgundy!
Favourite part of the vlog was when you were outside the house and was like look you can see my breath made me giggle!
Is that security camera at the top right corner of your mirror at the beginning of the vlog? LOL
You are a joy to watch! Plus your autumnal swag is muy fuego 🔥 Loved being apart of your experience as much as it was ours too. I’m living vicariously through you! love from Toronto! Xoxo
I loved it when you were explaining how people turn when you start the engine of this car. Especially the way you said Helouu HAHHA died!
The cutest sloth. Loved seeing mom light the fire, her voice is the cutest and Lulu is bae for sure!
10:11 that was my jam growing up lol
Im loving your vlogs lydia 💖💖
8:52 hahaha 😂😂😂\n*in the background

So sweet Lydia💞💞💞💞
Congrats Lydia 💗
Your jumper dress outfit looks amazing x
Anyone know what vloging camera Lydia use?
Praying for your granny 🙏🌸
Lydia - Can I ask when does your promo code for Cluse watches expire? I'll be going on holiday soon until the 31st October so I won't be able to order until I get back home. Kinda sucks that they don't do next day deliveries otherwise I could have ordered one today.
I really loved this one! ❤️
I also don't see the pajamas! where can I get those?
Not sure if you said it in the video but if you did I missed it! Lol what lipstick are you wearing please? I need it!! :)
I love Carry Backpack on 7:19, where is it from and does it fit 15 macbook pro? THANKS!!
Such a nice vlog, loved it! you were so happy...so nice. Carrie was so cute, Ali's grandpa awwww. Literally said Hi Ali outloud the first time he waved to the camera lol. Yeah jumping into pitch black water no no no ;) Oh and hope your grandmother feels better soon. xx
I love your videos so much! Whatever you do, but your videos are so cozy (don't know how to explain that), but I usually watch your videos on Sundays evenings, in my bed with a cup of lemon tea. ♥ Loving it!
It's hard to choose a favourite part... I just like your vlogs and end up watching old ones if you haven't uploaded a new one. The green jacket is beautiful on you and love how you light up when you talk about your family. xx
How come Lydia never vlogs at her parents house only Ali's!
Hello Lydia i really enjoy watching your videos , i like your positive energy 😉 and for spiders you can try  essential oil of peppermint they hate the smell 😜!! Kisses from Belgium.
Also... I feel like you driving that Ferrari is the epitome of a girl boss, you looked so cool!!!
Your vlogs are my favorites ❤ love you lyd
Loved the vlog - your cat was my favourite part xx
In love with this lovely colour <3\n\nhttp://carmelatte.co

+LydiaElsieMillen Are you still doing Vlogmas this year with your wedding and all? I still watch last years especially your visit to *The White Company* so christmascee! xxx
Fabulous blog. I've just ordered a couple of watches and over the moon with the discount code 👍👍👍 thank you! What couloir are your dark nails, they look amazing..?????? Xx
OMG that green coat is amazing, it looks so good on you  😍😍
Definitely Loulou the dog 's my favorite part of this vid coz it looks exactly like my dog lucy🐶🐕
I'd say I like all of it. it's my quick down time when my baby takes a nap. makes me wish you did daily videos. Also, you totally inspired me to use all my other ear pircining. I had a bunch of then done when I was a high school and as I got older I just used my main holes for studs. but seeing how cute your ears turned out inspired me to put some of my ear piercings back in and honestly I Love it! thanks for bringing back the trend it's really chic.
I never enjoy anyone else’s Vlog as much as I enjoy yours! I’m not sure if it’s because of your laid back personality or the accent.. or a good mix of both😂 I’m from the States so I am always intrigued by your tone of voice! We’re a lot less well spoken here in Louisiana haha! Xoxo
Loving all your videos..you ve got a  lovely vibe. I wish you the very best and hope your grandma recovers soon xx
Lydia!! It’s international Sloth day today and I thought I would let you know that this fact made me think of you 😂😂
Is the Coat warm?
Side note I love your energy. I'm definitely subscribing to your page .. check out my pg ✨
Your vlogs have changed so much. I used to love watching your videos and always was excited when notified you uploaded but the last month or so they have been very slow.
I love your vlogs! But a tip woman to woman,, pop some foundation on your upper ears as well :) Better color match xoxo
You are so lovely Lydia. I'm sick in bed today and your videos make me smile xxx
also want to have my third hole piercing on ear like yours but I am a bit afraid that it hurts
Another great blog!!! What breed of dog is lulu??xx
Lydia your House Number is 17??? Mine too! I believe number 17 means a change of good things!!!
I really like u showing new styles and just making me laugh 🤣
Hello Lydia,  where I can find your pyjama ? Is absolutely lovely ;)
Where is that red turtleneck sweater from?😍
Love your vlogs! what camera do you blog with?
SO FUN!!! Love your coat and love your pretty makeup!! Can you do a new tutorial on it? So great the makeup for everyday!!
Lydia.. I love you and allie..I think the two of you are great and I still don't know what kind of car you guys have. Pliease let me.   Know..By the way, I absolutely love your green coat! I mean I still don't know what kind of cat you have😻
I always liked your ear rings Dior and the silver hooks you wore but these you can't really see anymore. 😟🙁
Why not buy bug spray... I hate spiders as well.
i love the piercings!!! I didn't even expect it, such a nice treat :D
This has literally made my day. Snuggling with my sloth mug and giant bar of dairy milk. Recovering from being in hospital having had a car accident feeling a bit crap but just watching your vlog has cheered up my day! Thank you Lydia xx
My favourite part of the vlog was seeing how happy you and Ali were to be able to share something cool from your jobs with your family. Good memories, that is gold.
I just love your Vlogs in general 😊 they’re always filmed & edited beautifully! But seeing your family & Ali’s family is just so lovely! xx
My favourite vlog to date! Family time is just the best xx
Your videos genuinely brighten my days! I always look forward to them xxx
Move to Sydney sunshine ☀️ all year round 😀
Hope your grandmother gets better soon. ❤️ xx
Oh my god Ali's gandpa <3 was so cute and made me miss mine x
Love the idea of sharing your ferrari experience with your family and spending some time with them:) So sweet:)
The whole vlog is my favourite part <3
My favourite bit was definitely seeing you driving the Ferrari. Already saw it on Instagram stories and was so excited to see the vlog!
The part I like the most was when Ali's grandpa seeing Ferrari he seemed to turned back to his young age again with those  sparkling in his eyes...👍👍👍...such a memorable moment
My favourite part of all your vlogs is when you just sit and chat, it's usually at the end when you say your waffling on but it's the part I love the most ❤️ Also the longer the vlog the better, so KEEP WAFFLING!!
I have to say: Carrie you look very beautiful with glasses, like they really suit you. I don't feel confident in mine so i can understand you, but you don't need to always take them off :)\nxx from Rome
Hello Lydia, love this vlog <3 I'm also obsessed with piercings, growing up I had my belly button done and I had 5 earlobes and a cartilage, I had to remove my cartilage because it got infected but I still have my earlobe ones, I'm thinking of getting my 6th one. I also removed my belly button but I'm thinking of getting it repierced. I just recently did my rook and my tragus and I also want a daith and maybe another helix or forward helix. I love that you did talk about them again and Maria Tash has some of the most gorgeous piercings. Your ears look beautiful now! I'm waiting for my piercings to heal to switch them to some pretty ones too. Thanks for sharing that part and your piercing journey too! \nLove <3 <3
Love you Lydia! i always look forward to your vlogs! Youre such a beautiful person inside and out! Sending love from LA
So cool that you got to share this experience with your family and friends, I can image how much they loved it! xx
Hey Lydia! Love your vids, i’m a subscriber from Kenya 🇰🇪❤️. Could you please mention or do a vid on your nails? Do you do gel or shellac and how you keep them strong?
Where can I buy the gorgeous jumper dress from? 16:36min 😍
Wait wait. This is not a Wody Allen film??? What???
This seems like a skit parody trailer
If my kid dated an older and successful person, I don't know if I would get upset or happy that I know that they will be taking care of.
Came here just to here Chloe say fist me daddy
Chole moretz is not a good actor!!!! There i said it!!!!
i love you daddy sound  wronge out of context
Did I see Charlie on the couch? Awesome!
I think this movie was directed by Lana del Rey
It makes me happy and more comfortable with my body when I see actresses with a normal weight and are not underweight, I don’t know just Chloe’s body makes me happy
Do the roar, I love you daddy.
This has a 1% chance of being an original arthouse cult classic? But if not its probabaly just going to be a really gross dumb film.
The movie would be more impactful if it actually starred a 17 year old.
I dont know why people find her pretty, shes so wierd looking shes going to age so horribly too
I don't get why its in black and white
You watch this & all of you Agree to spend a weekend in Jail.
What did I just watch lol? This looks to be a horrendous film.
I LOVE you DaDdY 💦💦💦😫😩💦👉👌
Social anxiety prevents me from going to see this is cinemas- ordering a ticket for 'I love you daddy'-? No way. I'm out.
A Woody Allen ripoff about pervy hollywood executives at the same time as Louis CK and Harvey Weinstein are being accused of rape is easily the shittiest timing I think I've ever seen. How could he not address this?
This is a woody Alan parody everybody so it's more satire still off-putting those 🤒😷🤢
Chloe looking chubby as ever.  I get how her whole appeal is she's attainable (I.e not pretty or slim enough to acrually be a Hollywood starlet but is one anyway) but in this she literally looks like someone plucked a pretty but unremarkable first year University student (post freshman-15) out of a bar and gave them an acting gig.
This gives me Woody Allen vibes. Not in the black and white film sense but in the creepy  I married my daughter sense.
This reminds me of daddy's boy from unbreakable
I rarely ever say I love you to my dad. Not because we aren't close but because it makes me feel uncomfortable.. I think I'd die if I said I love you DADDY.
WTF this feels like a high school project.
damn, they couldn't of picked a better time to release a film about a movie director dating young girls
cant take this shit seriously only because of the title
we all know you watched for the thumbnail
Is the screen black for anyone else?
Pedophilia Is Hilarious: The Movie
The title of this movie is porn material
Very, very badly timed and in poor taste.
Is this a parody? Doesn't look like a real film
I cant stand people feeling uncomfortable cause it's talking about father~daughter relationship. It's not weird, it's damn interesting and original. Don't walk away from a potientially great movie because it doesn't go with the norms.
So Louis joins Woody in making movies about underaged girls and old guys. What A Surprise.
No actresses were harmed during the making of this programme.
I'm so confused
we all know we clicked for the thumbnail.
Chloe's body could do with some work.
That's what she said.
Harvey Weinstein: The Movie
Scary me out
Huh
Well this looks shit
what great timing
Nice a pedophile movie mada fakas
WOODY FOOKING ALLEN
This looks boring
Punish me daddy
Okay this seem questionable
Disgusting
Charlie Day!!!!!!!!!😀😀😀😀😀
What is this
Well incest IS win-cest
What is this???
This b**** is overrated she's not as pretty as they're making her out to be her face is deformed and weird little bit she's a thick pudgy little girl with a shity acting overrated.
Thia reminds me of Bojack Horseman in the best way
From the producers of Woody Allen, Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski...
I feel like this might be good or realllll problematic?
I came and I'm disappointed
Who else is making jokes about the movie's title??
Pedophiles, ladies and gents, are the next group of people the media will support for equal rights.
Oh my god that smile
Nahh the title sounds kinky as shit and here's me finding this load of bollocks
i googled i love u daddy xxx and this cum up .. u fuckin twisted cunts
is this all in black and white?
I saw the thumbnail, it was then I knew that there was no turning back..
Wtf is this shit black and white is it a 18s or 19s movie or something
Don't read the comments. Fuck the comments.
What is this, a new version on Lolita??
This is Hollywood. Anyway, looks pretty good.
I thought this was a porno. : (
Looks utter shite, even the acting seems poor
I think the fact it looks like a Woody Allen movie is intentional, since Woody Allen is a creep who dates young girls. I think Malkovich is playing a version of Allen in this film, and Louis is probably working through how he felt when they worked in 'Blue Jasmine'.
What is this Harvey Weinstein's Ultimate Fantasy The Movie?
So it's a movie where the kid is sexualized and the dad seems ok with it and he doesn't lose his mind when he finds out that she's dating an old man instead he talks to him...wth??? also I sense a pedo vibe from this dad and daughter relationship.
Wait so is this movie actually in black and white
Woody Allen homage with really nothing new or extraordinary to be labeled as original. Nonetheless, great cast, good dialogue, brilliant photography; I will see it.
I thought this was something ENTIRETY diffrent
Is this in black and white or is my phone broken.
She can call me Daddy anytime.....
Finally a movie in black and white with modern year actors!
that mortez girl still looks like a child, but large
Moretz went from rising start to bad Samuel L. Jackson(Like him, he signs everything, but he does always an awesome job)
This doesn't seem half as bad as I expected it to be with that title. Also, bonus point for being a Louis CK movie.
Why is this movie black and white?
mhm
a roman Polanski film?
Harvey wut you doing!
Wtf is this creepy shit Louie
This looks horrible
Hollywood: Pfffftttttt, im a pervert, your a pervert, hes a pervert, shes a pervert. WHO CARES.
charlieeeee

Wth did I just watch?🙅
HELLO FRIENDS!!! hope u guys enjoy this adventure into 80s fashion! who's ready for 77? lmao
Saf literally looked so beautiful in the second outfit
daammnn Tyler is thicc af
You're really cringy now i hate watching your videos.
Omg you looked so beautiful in the second outfit .I mean you slay every outfit but the second one looked such amazing with your hairs !(sorry for my bad English I’m from Germany 😂)
When she mentioned Phil Lester in the beginning, I freaking screamed. I love that man.
Why does she look so cute in every outfit omg I love her
I love these videos with all the pop culture history. You always look hot in everything 😍😘
Oh this brings back so many memories. Oddly enough, my 30th class reunion is tonight!!
Robin Sparkles tho! \nLet’s go to the mall todaaay..💃🏻
thanks for reminding me, I am going to go and rewatch all of HIMYM now
I’m pretty sure acid wash is coming back... like, right now.
That was so creative!
I remember wearing all of those styles.  :D  Even though, I wore shoulder pads, they drove me crazy.  I don't think I would want to wear them again.  It was a fun year.  The pop culture was great.
I think I had that acid wash purse when I was in 7th grade in 1987.... Great Trip down Memory Lane. Thanks!
I’m living for the second outfit
The amount of effort you put into your videos is amazing. You deserve all the likes and views! 👏
these are LOOKS omg i love it 👏
That second outfit is so pretty!!
Being obsessed with the 80s, including wearing the clothes, I loved this video! We need as much variety as we had in the 80s. Everyone dresses boring these days lol!
Why does she actually look like Maggie from the Carrie diaries! Love it 💕
Tyler looks like he would train bird Pokemon
They all suit you SO WELL
All I can think of is Seinfeld lol
The last outfit is so freaking cute I would wear it even today!! :DD
GOD YOU ARE SO QUIRKY AND CUTE!!!! I love ITTTT
I love these videos!!! Please please please make a 1927, 1937, 1947, 1957,1967, and 1977 next.  I feel like this is super educational and super entertaining! I love it Saf!
This video made me want 80's clothes to make a comeback
may have screamed slighty when you mentioned phil as i love him and was also going to make that joke
OK but I actually love the glam metal look 😂
The second look was very Elaine from Seinfeld
Let's go to the mall
HA! At the start of the video I showed this to my boyfriend and he said Wow, she looks like Robin from How I Met Your Mother and then you go and dress up like Robin Sparkles :P He said it first guys!
Why do you look like Yessica in the third look
She looked straight beautiful in that first hairstyle and makeup look 😍 and the bangs in the last one w the curled in ends made her look so cute 👏🏼
You know what? You kinda look like robin from how I met your mother
My mom had such a big locks that she didn't need to do so much to have hairstyles like that xD But I must say that you really look good in that second hairstyle 😃
Dude I dress like this daily, and the feather hair is unintentional lol
One of my fav Youtuber referencing HIMYM?? I've never been so happy <3
You look so good on the 3rd hair style! Maybe you can get a bang sometime? It looks really good on you I love it LOL
I hope at some point she just gets to giant gowns from the 1800's lol
Wow, this brings back many memories of my hs freshman and sophomore years!  You nailed all 3 of these outfits.  I don't remember how long it took me to get bangs really high each day, but that is what school was about!  Sit and do your hair/makeup during class.  Or between periods in the bathroom with 6743578 other girls.  It was a fun decade for a kid and thanks for bringing back some of these great memories!  xoxo  PS--in my freshman year yearbook photo, I have popped up my collar.  Lol!  Too funny.
I liked these outfits on you.
She looks pretty in every damn style omg
Wait. I love you with bangs. Especially in the last style. So cute!!
For a second I thought you were going to sit on that bike; never sit on a bike that isn't yours. You will regret it if the owner sees you.
the second outfit reminds me of heathers
I'd actually wear all of these lol
Omg I'm so happy for her, she's trending 😍
Who else kept thinking of Winona Ryder? Like Veronica from Heathers and Nancy in stranger things
Lets go to the mall toddaaaaaay ~ robin sparkles
Your butt looks amazing in those jeans
You look like a Seinfeld character 😂😂
All 3 outfits looked so good on you ! You pulled them off 😍
LET'S GO TO THE MAAAAAAAALL! TODAAAAAAAAY!!
This was phenomenal. The business outfit was the absolute most convincing. You should go as Elaine from Seinfeld for Halloween!
pretty nice, i remember all of this, you pulled off the office/shoulder pad, and the 'debbie gibson' look but you were short on the metal.. i grew up in that era and was in a metal band.. most of the girls like outside the whiskey had on more spandex and jeans then pleather most of the wannabe guys wore pleather aka as they called it 100% authentic, genuine imitation leather... but the groupies, if they did wear pants in how you portray it here it would be full on leather.. seeing that most metal groupies couldn't afford full leather, they wore spandex under the ripped jeans.. but at least you somewhat pulled off the hair style... straight out of hit parader magazine that is.. most groupies just had it teased and held with aqua-net pink ... depleting the ozone layer one can at a time...
The minute I saw Tyler's hair, I started wheeze-laughing. Ahh Safiya, you are amazing at what you do!
sHe LoOkS LiKe VeRoNiCa In ThE tHuMbNaiL
If I had an office job I would totally wear that second outfit. Is that bad?
I feel very strongly that you belong in the 80's. These looks were PERFECT!!!! And this is coming from someone who spent two whole years in that particular decade... so I'm basically an expert.
1987 was my best year in the 80s!!!
I love when you do these!! Please do one from the sixties!! ✌🏼🌻✨
A girl I knew in high school dressed like the business look everyday and she was highly respected. I feel like it’s definitely in style if you like to give the professional look. 💞
shoulder pads will never be out of style for meeeeeeeeeeee
I love how every time you upload you're always trending !!! 💕💕💕✨
This is very interesting and amazing video
I love the second outfit hair
I loove all these hairstyles on you!
Safiya I love you but I have to click off the video every time when you get to the outro because I can't stand it when you say shamash
My mom, whose name is Cheryl, definitely wore that outfit in 87 😂😂😂
You look so cute with bangs!!
omg that 80's style was interesting. love how you can pull off all these looks
You look like a Pokemon trainer\nI died
I think everything would look like from the 80s with that hair😂
The acid washed outfit reminded me of Robin Sparkles, and then she mentioned it!!!
Love every single outfit
you guys look awesome together
AnD PhiL LeSTA
YOU LOOK LIKE WINONA RYDER!!!
*Robin Sparkles*
Ur workforce outfit is completely wrong

Finally!! A Good Song 💓
In love with your dance😚😚
I think Charlie Puth is the BEST singer in the world
He seems to be drunked as he dance
I'm sure this is a mixture of Attention and something else.
U gotta admit that he can't dance..😂😂😂But what a beautiful song...Feels like all my stress is being creeped out..😇😍😍
I wonder how awkward it was for him to Dance like that 😂
We love you from isrel❤
Me after I pass my test without studying 😏 2:48
Charlie dancing like the fluffiest hedgehog ever is something I never thought I needed!😂❤
Why he was flying???????????
Girls,get a man who can fly,walk,sing and looking excessivly handsome like Charlie puth
How long has been going on?
Cringey dancing. Christopher Walken did it better. And what was the point of that woman?
I love you so much. You killed my heart!
Charlie good singer but acter is not good
Charlie, Taylor, Ariana, Joey Graceffa are the best singers i have ever heard
Why he's so hot huh?! I'm dying now! Lol :v

What a lovely song man.
What is he doing......fucking love this guy.
Believe me or not this song has typical 'Indian songs' vibes in it also to mention the dance moves are quite Indian vintage dance moves...😀😁Awesssssooommmmeee song👌😎
He CAN'T dance. I don't know why but instead of having a cringe reaction, I sort of find it cute and funny in a good way. 😍😁😊😂
i just love this side of charlie puth look cute while dancing
2:28 in the music video look at the poster of a girl, she looks like Selena Gomez.
I can watch him dace all day 😍😍
I don't understand how charlie dance.
His dance reminded me the dance of Chandler from friends for some reason
God damn.\nI am in love.\nAGAIN.
That spin move was clearly not him
He is my crush😍😍😍and that scar on his eyebrow..😍😍he is so cute and adorable 😘😘
My song on loop, \nSinging style beyond commendable

Awesome tracksuit
He's floating 😶 Pennywise is quaking
I'm crying at how sad marbles is lol laughing crying coughing and weezing.
THIS VIDEO ABSOLUTELY MADE MY DAY!
Okay but like I feel like it's outrageous to dress a dead dog in costumes. #deadanimalshaverights #imsorrymarbles
PRINCESS LEIA FOR PEACHY WALDO FOR CERMIT AND BONES OR DINOSAUR FOR MAHBLA
I want to see KLONDIKE AND SUNDAE in Halloween costumes. \n\nAlso, still waiting for that Jack v Jenna brawl.
Strap a GoPro to Marbles and leave for 3 days... See how little Marbles moves
Am I the only one who though marbles' spock costume looked like Shane Dawson? 😂 😂
peach as princess leia - i laughed so hard. I also dressed up as her as a kid and looking back i can't get over that hairpiece, which at least the one u got peach was actually a wig mine we a piece of plastic that just looked like her hair and that crown thing. FML you dogs costume is better than mine was in 5th grade.
I got high before this and was CRYING laughing when marbles was trying things on.
i have never seen a dog more fed up than peach with the FIRST costume
10 out of 10. I just did this today with my pets. We dressed up 1 dog as a circus clown. So cute & just plain adorable. Another as a Bad Ass. Black Leather Vest, with a spiky Collar. Don't worry, it's fake, so the collar isn't going to hurt him. Plus it came with a little red mohawk. Now I wasn't planning on using the mohawk, but when I put it on him, it just looked so cute and funny. xD I might just use it. And finally my Big, Fluffy, Chubby Cat. He's going to be Wendy from the Wizard of Oz. Now Listen, I know he's a boy, but the other outfits didn't fit him and he was just so adorable. x3 Plus the dress makes the outfit more comfortable for him then the others. He only has to worry about his front paws and his wig. xD
Jenna should have people roast her dogs but in their costumes for s video
I just watched this whole video without volume... like what the fuck am I doing with my life?
I DID NOT KNOW I NEEDED THIS
bat dog, football player, and wheres waldo are my favorites
In his mind.. marbles is already retired and living in Florida
The where’s Waldo is perfect and I’m living for it
You should call into places and ask them if they know who Jenna marbles is
I just want to know what lipstick she's wearing so I can get it.
I loved Peaches Bat-dog as well, though the wings were backwards xDDD also why wasn't marbles the ewok??? Andddd Kermit's where's waldo's outfit is seriously amazing! ♥
I legit thought that the thumbnail was you with some creepy doll before i read the title just look at it ....peach's nose makes the open mouth of the doll .... eerrrgghh
To add insult to injury, you put a costume on your dead dog.\nRIP Marbles.
Well you can’t expect a dead marble to move
Peach has that face smile like.....mom....ok are we done....
how could anyone dislike this video?
KERMIT HAS TO BE THE SUSHI NO EXCUSES
someone needs to make a “all jenna’s awkward zoom-ins”
I think marbles is a little too old to go trick or treating. He just wants to sleep 😴
OMG, you should dress Marbles up as a living dog for Halloween! That'd surprise EVERYONE!
the funniest part was definitely moon bounces dino costume i almost PEED myself with laughter
Video proof that marbles is really dead
Marble slowly sinking in the dino costume reminds me of one of those blow up halloween or xmas lawn displays as it deflates lol
For ur next video u should order breast milk and try it
You just need to dress marble up as a dead dog. Buy him a little doggie coffin.
What is Ad gonna be for halloween
Marbles literally had me laughing so hard I cried 😂
Kermit's Waldo costume is the best
The uglier side of humanity
Bat dog, football player, and where’s Waldo
12:29 Is Marbles dead? Lol 😂  He's like too done and tired.
Who else was thinking about that video “it’s Friday my dudes” when the dogs were howling.
Peach NEEDS to be the bat!!
my mum literally got concerned for marble when she saw what i was watching she thinks that marble needs help
You used to be hot. Ive been watching you since at least 2014 wtf happened to you. You look like a man in drag. Please stop and get a man this homo is encouraging this shit.
I think jack reviewed one of these dogs....
Marbles was slipping away in those costumes! Not today, Satan!
Marbles as a football player was the cutest thing I've ever seen
It’s not cool to dress up a dead dog.
You didn't utilize this opportunity to dress him up as snoop dogg? -3/10
why didn't you get kermit a kermit costume
Sunday and Klondike are better.
Peach should be princess laya, marbles should be the football player, and marbles should be waldo
I love this look on you Jenna!!!
every time im having a bad night jenna's videos always make me laugh no matter what
The best part was Kermit trying to jack Marbles and Peach's video time
can't wait to see klondike and sundae do this 5x better
MARBLE IS SO FOOTBALL APPROPRIATE, HE’S TAKIN A KNEE IN THAT FOOTBALL OUTFIT.
Some how marbles looks more dead in all these costume than normal
Whenever Kermit put on the glasses he looked like snoop dogg lmao
Kermit def Waldo, Peach should be Sushi or Leia, And Marbles was the cutest Teddy Bear!
The Dino costume looked like a lobster
Lucas sold start wars to Disney. Geez ....get it right! I've heard your. And but haven't listened to you much but you're cute and entertaining. Also, you can NEVER go wrong with Star Wars
Marble = skeleton because he is dead
3:29 please don’t marry Carpet and Leech because they would bring some ugly ass, retarded, and probably fat children i’m just telling you the truth
Okay, jokes aside... what's actually wrong with  Marble? If there is anything wrong, idk.
Jenna, get in my lunch box cause you are looking like a SNACK!
Ain't gonna lie. I thought the dog was dressed up like that Annabelle doll
Marble looks like Walter Matthau from Grumpy Old Men and should be in a retirement community
OK BUT WHY IS THIS VIDEO BETTER THAN MY HALLOWEEN COSTUME ONE WTF
i enjoyed this video way too much
That Jennas My Marbels
Jacks dogs are better...
Alright Peach fuck off hahah
She looks like whistlers mother 😂😂😂(prob butchered that spelling wise haha)
Marbles has dog narcolepsy
Marbles made me cry laugh.
Garbage Dogs
7:15 I CANT BREATHE
your dogs are garbage
Jk he's so Adorable
I love how marbles deflated while wearing every costume. Lol
Peach-Bat\nMarbles-Skeleton \nKermit-Waldo \n♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
marbles literally just wants death
Holy shit that makeup is waaay intense.
Is myrtle okay?
Every costume brings Marbles closer to death
I <3 Kermit
rip marbles xx
GRANDMOTHER CERMET
WHO YOU FIGHTIN
OH MY GOD MARBLES ISNT DEAD
Marbles' costumes were functioning like thunder vests lol
BEST VIDEO EVER
I peed my pants laughing well done Jenna
Marbles never looked more alive
Lol awh marble
Marbles I am CRYING
this made me rly happy
Kermit rocked all the costumes!
Damn Jenna, your makeup looks dank
I want to be nile Wilsons girlfriend please and thank youuuu

No the Paul brothers are pricks that want views and attention
Need to see Logan
I’m a logangster and a wilsonite I guess. Love you both
6:34 That's not doing pushups, that's headbanging towards the floor. Many of you pushed your numbers by doing 1/2 and 1/4 pushups. Elbows in, chest touches the floor! Come on.
What in the hell was that push up form of the dude in the black shirt (First one)
Do a collab with a subscriber and try teach them how to do a back flip. I did gymnastics for about 1-2 years and never learnt how to do any type of flip 😭😂
You look soooo happy in this vlog! It's heartwarming😊 keep smiling!!!! 😆
I can do 64 dips-it's me record
Cheap out my motorbike stunt please on my channel it's crazy  ❤️
Whyyyyy Logan Paul, I respect you Nile but really?!!

Editing was on point in this vid 👌🏻
why would you like to collab with those two stupid idiots you probably dont know what im talking about because your in the uk but the paul brothers are on the news in america for doing stupid things and are known for being fucking ass holes
One of your best blogs so far :) cheers from Colombia ^_^
Who are Jake and Paul Logan and why are people angry at Niles for working with them? I like Niles.
You should try to do a collab with Zack Merrick. He's the bassist for All Time Low and can do like two minute handstands and trains on rings. His Insta is zacharymerrick  you should check it out
Nile, why don't we save ourselves some time and just get married right now? Love your videos and you're so talented and sweet!
Love your blogs.  Keep it up.
I think that if you dyed the top of your hair blonde you would look great!!
please no logan and jake
Your videos are so packed that I always have to watch them at least twice in a row! :)
This vlog was hilarious! I’ve been having a particularly bad week and this just made all my stress melt away. Thanks Nile! 💕
How has Nile not got more followers
I know you've spoken to Marcus Butler about collabing so he's one suggestion. My 2nd is some of the diversity boys :)
The Girls Just Want to Have Fun montage was wonderful.
You should definitely collab with Jake Paul and teach him a backflip
you think 59 is good? my dad used to do 80 when he was 18 and now he can do 110
pick LOGAN insted of that joke Jake
I'm in love with your personality❤I hope Logan notices you, I also love him! I've a GREAT IDEA for you, my twitter is @peque2111 in case you want to contact me!
I can't stop looking at the nipple now
What does he have on his hands, the red stuff? Is it to stop his hands overextending?
Do a calab with Roman Atwood
I love your videos keep it going keep on building 💪🏼💪🏼
Collab with the Dobre Twins not the Paul's
It makes me feel pretty good about myself to know that I can do more pushups than three of the four guys, who are gymnasts, in this video 🤗
Plz plz do the gymnastics alphabet challenge but blindfolded and u have 20 seconds to do it
As a gymnastics coach, I do my best but. Clearly need to up my game! Awesome vlog.
Such a lovely boy. God bless you
1:18 - I got the very wrong idea since I wasn't paying attention for a second lmao... great vlog much love, an inspiration <3
that's incredible. I can only do about 10-15 Push Ups. Obvously I'm not sportif. xD But I still like your Videos and I want it to do by myself. But I'm too lazy :(
This Channel is officially my new obsession. 😂
Why can't you keep the same video for more that 5 seconds?
4:57 there's a Scottish flag!! I'm happy cuz I'm Scottish!😊
This is my favourite type of vlog; gymnastics montages, foam pit fighting montages, and some good old Celine Dion!
Do a ultimate gymnastics challenge with lel m8
Hey Nile! I’m a gymnast(check out some of my videos😊) I look up to you so much and I love your attitude! Keep up the good work!😘
What's wrong with Jake and Logan Paul? I think I've been under a rock.

Does anyone understand the idea of the mask? It looks like some kind of kinky sex equipment.  Don't judge me O_O
Hi my name is Sam and 14. I just started gymnastics(I know a little late), but I feel like I can not get enough training. I really want to get good but the coaches won't let me train more. All the classes are full. How do I prove my self
Where can i get shorts like these?
Please Logan Paul
@jakepaul @loganpaul
Your videos have made me absolutely want to do gymnastics (as a hobby), but I'm fed up of the sexism I'm faced with that women have to do these elegant dance-like moves, and can't use the same apparatus as men even though they used to decades ago. I don't want to sashay around, I want to use the high bar, and the rings, and display my strength!!
Hey Nile quick question when you train what playlist do you play / if not specific what type of music
What relations does Jakey have to Norway?
How often do they change out the foam stuff in thr pits?
Didn't he have 500k sub?
Whats the mask he's wearing on floor at 2:50?
Hey I’ve lost 10 lbs so far! Yeahhhhhhh so excited!
It’s the philosophers stone, the book is called the philosophers stone.
I’m a hufflepuff and I’m truely affended
It's philosopher's stone. In all of history it has been called philosopher's stone. Please dont be stupid
Uhm, Nicholas Flamel already had the Philosopher's stone in the  1920s because he was already about 600 years old
We know Newt worked with dragons, we also know that Dumbledore discovered uses for dragon blood; dragon blood is an alchemical ingredient. Could this be how they are connected? Newt finds a dragon for Dumbledore, Dumbledore and Nicholas work together to find the uses for the blood.
They would fly there on a moving staircase duh
I speak both French and English so the way they pronounce  Beax batons  kills me
+SuperCarlinBrothers Ben why do you keep correcting Seamus on the Philosopher's stone, when that is an actual historic name for the object, and the sorcerer's stone is literally something a marketing department came up with because they were afraid american kids wouldn't know what a philosopher was?\nThey thought that a child would not want to read a book with the word philosopher in the title https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone
It's the philosopher's Stone! Get it right. and the word  you're looking for is alchemy
its philosopher's stone
It's Beau BatOn not Beau Baton
Seamus Gorman has the most annoying voice ever created!!!
The fact that your so serious is off putting.... Go get y'all some girls?
And thus I set out on my quest to expand my knowledge on distance plunging.
The word maths is correct because it's never SINGULARS don't shame us. Speak proper English. You're making a fool out of Americans. IT HAS AN S AT THE END YOU FOOL.
Wait- I don't know that the second Fantastic Beast movie was about the Triwizard Tournament IM SHOOK
Ben: “Let’s start with the math.”\nSeamus: “Maths.”\nBen: “You are SO British!”\n😂😂
Hypotheses: To make the stone you need to permanently kill a phoenix to trap it's essence into the stone. Maybe they didn't know, maybe they didn't care, but Dumbledore is surprised and shocked by this terrible outcome that he splits with the other wizards and a fight breaks out. After the battle is over Dumbledore, in a victorious but in bad shape, finds a single phoenix egg in the ruins and ashes of the battle field, and Fox hatches.
My favorite line of today... Like every great video lets start with the math.    Maths. You are so British!
I think it is more complicated than this.
i thought the triwizard tournament occurs every 7 years
A flying train, or a teleporting train to a nearby French train station, coz why not!
It’s the philosepher’s stone they only called it the sorcerers stone in the US so that ppl would know there was magic in it
AHHHH HOW DID I JUST SEEN THIS AHHHHHHH
Go NZ! Domesticating a phoenix. And to think you only know us for sheep...
4:27 no body says potaHto!\n\nSEAMUS BE STATING THE REAL FACTS!\n\nI loved this video!!
i think hogwarts would have flying carriages pulled by thestrals.
YES NEW ZEALAND, DOMESTICATING A PHOENIX 👌👌👌
I think they would travel by thestral-pulled carriages
Unrelated..... but I hope at some point the producers of fantastic beats somehow manage to work something Wonder Woman related into the films. Like a news paper article... etc? I know they're not the same franchise and whatever but that would be cool
Can we have a Ask Jonathan?
Ben and Seamus look like father and son (Seamus is so chubby!! Its adorable
I kept thinking they should do I collaborate so happy
I love your guys's dynamic. This is hilarious.
You two should join the role-playing site called hogwarts Extreme
IT'S M A T H \nTHERE'S NO S \nIT MAKES NO SENSE
OK I'm Scottish and I have an American freind.we have all the same fights so I relate
The Tri-Wizard Tournament is very similar, and arguably, based upon the idea of the elements of nature working together. With this being stated, because it is the Tri-Wizard Tournament, meaning three, this idea would mean that the number of elements of nature would not be four (fire, air, earth, water) but rather three. The concept of three natural elements (fire, air, and earth, with air consisting of water vapor and being basically the same thing) is based upon French Philosopher René Descartes. Though Descartes did live during the 17th century, when based upon Pottermore the Tri-Wizard Tournament [dates] back around 700 years, meaning the 14th century, perhaps this notion of three natural elements already was conceived by the Wizarding World. The Goblet of Fire represents the three elements: the fire from the goblet; the goblet made from materials of the earth; air that fuels the fire. The tasks of the 1994-1995 Tri-Wizard Tournament represent the three elements: Dragons breathe fire; the Lake (again, for Descartes, air and water are the same element); the Maze, which with its hedges and creatures represents earth. With regards to how each school transports its students, the same theory is able to be applied. Beauxbatons travels by air with their carriage. Though Durmstrang has a boat, it is in fact a vessel that is traveling upon the earth. Therefore, whatever Hogwarts uses to transport its students, my guess is that it is somehow related to the element of fire. The idea of Dragons seems a bit far-fetched, even if the Hogwarts school motto does mention a Sleeping Dragon. Nevertheless, my guess is that something in relation to the element of fire is how Hogwarts students are transported to the school hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
wait.... dont the SuperCarlinBrothers live in VA? that means Seamus is here is VA.....
It's philosophers stone because it is an ENGLISH book
I know. I am a very special bird 🔥🔥
You guys are cute together <3 I'd love to see more stuff you do together
its tHE PHILOSOPHERS STONE
Why.. Haven't they missed a competition year?
It;s Math !!! Mathematics is not plural , what other abbreviation do you add the last letter from the word too ? It's MATH, pompous arrogant Brits LOL
They would use the straps and carriages
OH MAH GAHD YOU GUYS COLLABED!?!?!?! MY LIFE IS COMPLETE😭😭😆😆😆
so the fact that she used a real life person for a character i think proves all this really happen and jk is actually a witch who lived it
They would travel by flu powder
The Philosopher stone is made of human souls, it was revealed pretty early.
With magic I think lol
Is there a spell to make your wand vibrate?
They should do a theory on how the four founders (Rowena Ravenclaw, Salazar Slytherin, Godric Griffindor, and Helga Hufflepuff) met
You are so British
Seamus and Ben!!! Two of my most favorite theorists ever have finally done it!!!\n  I would also like to point out that a Hufflepuff and a Slytherin are in a room together. One's British one's American..... coincidence 😏
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYES MY BOY SEAMUS GORMAN HAS FINALLY MADE IT SEAMUSSSSSSSSSSSSS IM SO PROUD OF YOU BRO
Great job in adding in the fun American vs. British bantering between you two! The video with J was a bit awkward 😅 adorably awkward!
HOLY BUTTS I clicked the video and saw both of them and almost died
when seamus was doing the maths\nme: whaaaaaaaaattttttttttt????????!!!!!!!!!!!!\nBen: yeah (carrys on speaking as if seamus didnt just do that with no difficulty)
I've been waiting for this collab forever!!!! Like if you agree!!!
Ooohhh I’m so excited and I love these two so much. Can’t wait for Fantastic beast 2
Oh come on, I'm American and I call it the Philosopher's Stone.
This is just UK VS. America.....beutiful
#hufflepuff4life
Philosophers stone!
CROSSSS OVERRRR!
Stupid video. Damn pointless
Flying train.
You guys are hilarious!!
Thestral pulled carriages
Thank you!
Oh my gosh these jokes!😅
This is so painfully scripted.
Ahhhhhh, British people...
MMMAAAAATTTTHHHHSSSSS!!! WTF
Okay okay but FLYING TRAIN
kinda expected something like fma style stone creation
philosopher stone!!!!
27 on trending! YAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS!!!!!!
Yay Seamus and Super carlin,awesome
Discount leafy and a math teacher....meh
1ST COMMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJK
Philosphers stone, maths etc
My two favourite theorists collabing OMG!!!!!
That was funny.
This is my favorite collab
Hufflepuff Hufflepuff Hufflepuff Huuuffffllleeeeppppuuuuuufffff
27th on trending, yay!
DOUBLE HEY BROTHER!!!!!!!!! :D
i do not enjoy this seamus person
The Phoenix is awesome! It burns up and becomes reborn from its own ashes.
J, can you do a video about what actually happened to the other robots in Wall-E? They are solar paneled so why are they all seeming dead except for one. Are there others still functioning? Or is there some other reason? Idk if you’ve already done a video on this, but I think that would be an interesting video. Thanks!!!! If no that specific topic, then maybe just another Wall-E theory? Love your videos bye!
Hufflepuff scarf = the terrible towel of the wizarding world.

Nothing annoys me more than the fact that Americans call it Sorcerer's Stone
Was anyone else annoyed with the pronunciation of the word Beauxbatons?
But that’s just a theory. A GAME THEORY!
Is it just me, or did the first time Seamus said Fawkes did you think he said forks?
It's maths. English people are the best at speaking acctual English!!!!
No more collabs. You're better on your own
this is a movie not a series right?
Just like the weapon x program
We had a perfectly good explanation of how his family died in season 2 of dare devil, now it changed? Did his family get brought back to life and got murdered again?
Frank's family is supposed to be killed by mobsters, not a rogue government agency.  This retcon warps the very reasons why he became a vigilante in the first place and makes no sense.  If he is punishing those that are like the ones that killed his family wouldn't he become an anti-government militia guy instead of an mobster killer?

Too much hard work being a superhero
Well now its confirmed, Karen Page has the hots for damaged vigilantes.
Why am I not even subscribed to Netflix
Karen is so lame, she doesn't care about hanging out with a murderer but gets all weird being around daredevil
I'm Calling It Best Comic Book Show Ever Created!
The only thing I see that I think is related to the comic, is the skull on his chest. They better introduce a badass version of Bullseye or Im out of here.
My boy Shane about to light it up!!!! I can’t wait!!!!!
The guilty must be punished 💀💀💀💀💀
This Punisher I liked since Dare Devil, I think Jon plays this roll perfect fit. I'm excited
So when is neflex going to do a blade tv show lol
Can't wait to watch Punisher kill em all.
I just want more scenes like the prison fight from Daredevil\n\nStory wise, Its unlikely but I hope they explore the Born storyline
looks like i’m calling in work sick on the 17th
Frank Grillo should have been the Punisher.
This is gonna be awesome
Putting alcoholica in this trailer is trashy as fuck.
“They killed my family to get to me.”
Netflix picks the PERFECT music for their Marvel trailers.
Cant wait to watch this show. He's such a badass in DD season 2. Hoping that Matt will be a cameo here
WHOA!!!!!! I CANNOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!
Daredevil: Blind Justice\n\nBatman: A Billion Dollars Justice\n\nThe Punisher: Penny and Dime Justice
Finally some good trailer music!!! Metallica’s the shit 🤘🏻
You know, I was never a big Punisher guy, in fact he typically just pissed me off more often than not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut sweet mother of fuck, this looks badass.  Marvel writes antiheroes so well, it's amazing their more optimistic characters are the focal points of the MU.
How many times have I've seen Karen cry. It's honestly getting a bit annoying.
I am not au fait with this marvel character.....but ...shouldn't marvel heroes have superhuman powers?  This just looks like some GI revenge bollocks.
What's his superpower
First couple of trailers didn't impress me. I was still going to watch of course, but they didn't excite me. But this.... This is exciting.
We finally have a release DATE  yes!!
hes The Punisher we dont deserve, but the one we need right now
Justice League, Thor Ragnarok and The Punisher on November. I am blessed.
No karen no foggy so you know itll be good.
Fuckin' can't protect her RICK
FUCK ME ALL THE WAY UP
Star Wars Battlefront II & The Punisher releasing on the same day... Nerdgasm.
Another punisher movie... I've loved this character since I was a kid.  Dolph actually seemed like the only one who had the true physique of the Punisher IMHO.  The Tom Jane version was too connected.  Too normal compared to the comic version.  Ray Stevenson was decent but that movie kinda missed as well.  What say all you other Punisher fans????
So, what I got from this trailer was DAMN! I need that VERSION of song!
Dude, justice league, star wars battle front 2, and now this. Why can't they be one more day earlier on my b-day
Absolutely gave me chills and had me in tears I'm so excited
deadliest punisher is on the line. woh blow my mind. Netflix you made it. explosions everywhere that's punisher we always wanted in live action saga. kudos
It looks so damn well done and amazing. I think they got my boy right FINALLY. -Dave FBT
I’m puttng this on a ledge of a cliff.
Am I the only person who doesn't dislike Karen?
I can't wait to see this show. I'm a huge fan of The Punisher. I'm hoping Marvel gets The Punisher down right on Netflix.
It's nice to see Milan Lucic branching out
So the Punisher no longer fights crime but is a disgruntled soldier fighting the government and his feelings?  And from the look of the trailer they changed his origin as well.  It has shooting guns and Metallica, so what? This doesn't look good it looks like a direct video John Cena movie.  You people are fucking idiots.
Can’t wait!!! Metallic’s One sounds great with this trailer
Can’t believe Shane came back from the dead
Around 1:57 I think I saw spider man in his home made suit
Thank goodness for this show iron fist was garb, defenders was meh this will wash that bad taste outta our mouths. Also can karen stop getting overly involved? Like why is she crying every 20 seconds? I hope they pull her from the show.
Bernthal’s scream at 0:07 sounds exactly like Connie from Brickleberry
holy shiet thats a good trailer! Liked the character in daredevil, this will be good hopefully!
Hope they keep Metallica - One as the theme song
gazab trailor
Frank had 2 kids?
I cant wait
Wooo! I am pumped!
Looks low budget Netflix film
I have goosebumps...
Oh hell yes!
503 dislikes yall  Buggin.  Hard

Blackface? C'mon, Frank, not cool.
Caren a thot
Punish me hard. I'm fookin ready
:OOO
Sanford and Son Andy Griffith Andy Griffith
Take my money.
HYPE PARTYYYY
Dear Netflix,\n\nI'll find this on the Bay.\n\nYar,\n\nWhite People
Fuck, it comes out the same day as Battlefront 2
Am I the only one that dislikes Karen Page? I don't have a problem with the actress, just the character. It seems like she is either crying or being totally clueless in her appearances
You silly guys. He isn’t the punisher, he’s Shane
Why does the thumb nail look like a vid game
What's with the stupid government cover up crap! Why can't he just kill mobsters like the books? There going to screw it up yet again.
I don't like this actor as the punisher. I just don't like his face lol
Please be ultra dark and Ultra violent
Dude, the thumbnail guy is the guy who raped Rick's wife in The Walking Dead 😲
Why do they have to fuck with old school comics and make them into terrible live action adaptations? This is just dragonball evolution all over again.
Best character of marval!
*PLEASE...DONT....SUCK*
Thank you Netflix! Huge Punisher fan dont let us down. Looks great
Yeah go Shane!! #TheWalkingDead
Meh...
Man marvel are a bunch of lil bitches when it comes with release dates. Shoulda released it over Veterans Day but nooooo, same day that Justice league comes out. Sorry punisher, but you'll have to wait.
And just think... We could of already had this if it weren't for the dam new wave SJW/liberal idealogy

What if you're ambidextrous? Which hand's nails grow faster? Or do they just grow at an equal rate?
TOP TIP: Set speed to 0.75x so you can actually absorb the information presented! Works well.
All males were female once that’s why they have nipples
and all this came from what? Chance?! pffffff
Why did you pixelate the mans chest?\n\nEdit:in the thumbnail
Time for a new background song
Can you repeat that?
I watch this to feel happy about myself
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well. - Psalms 139-14
Man, they just love to clickbait us with censored out human bodies. In context or not.
Guys the man's nipples were censored because they respect wamen.
I just experienced health class in 3:32 seconds take that Mr. Nelson
Body question ASAPscince guys! I'm currently pregnant so of course always sick. So my question is why is it when I vomit I feel like the blood vessels in my face are goimg to explode? I haven't vomited in years since I was a kid so this is a pretty unusual sensation.
I think they meant that the kidneys excrete bicarbonate when the pH drops and excrete H+ when the pH rises.
What's if you hold in a sneeze
when i was watching this, I tried not to move because of what this video was telling me, I was so scared
Canadian or Americans using Metric system now?
But what is you're a potato?? Any help please!?

There is so much nudity on these science channels as clickbate.
Most steel has a tensile yield strength of 36,000 to 50,000 psi (although there are types much stronger).  Bone is roughly 16,000 psi.  I am unsure of its range.  but in terms of strength: steel > bone
Fun fact: FLORIDA IS A MYTH! :O
I see bodies as a brain piloting a 10lb slab of meat
Does anyone else get anxiety watching stuff like this? And your insides feel weird.
Umm, those three bones in your ear has nothing to do with your balance, your balance is maintained with the help of the balance organ, basically there are three cylindrical bows in three different directions all filled with liquid (water I believe). when you move, the water inside moves and thus the haircells (it's called haircells in swedish) is sensing the movements and sends the signal in through the fused cochlea nerve from balance and hearing organ
Are people kinda sorta amphibians I know their mammals but they did kind sort of breathed water right
was that Pepe in the sweat gland?
without the three middle ear bones (0:15) you should be able to hear anyways (although much worse) and they have nothing to do with balence, that should be the cochlea!!
WHATS WITH ALL THE LINKS IN THE DESCRIPTION
Amazing body fact:\nliterally everything that has ever lived has died to help create your body as it is right now. \n\n\n\n\n\nDon't think about it too much, have some water, and take care of it, aight?
Lol I’m learning this in school
I liked purely because they censored the guys nipples...
Please watch my channel to see my cancer story! To educate people on what cancer is like thankyou!
i want to know the science of being tickeled and y do you laugh wen u do?
ASAP Science is the shit!
I was born without nipples help
That's the cutest liver I have ever seen.
What do you mean those 3 bones in your ear help you balance? They don't. They are only there to transfer sound from the outside to the inside of the ear. There are 3 ring formed tubes in your ear that are actually responsible for balancing.
Your body is amazing! But keep it to yourself. and don’t forget to censor!
in what way is a femur stronger than steel?
0:40 ... thanks now I have to breathe manually
Next video: how many markers u use a video and year
I love how you censored the boys nipples aswell😂😂👌
Follow NAVI PLAYZ he makes great game video tutorials !!
How many expo markers do you go through?
When you got to the 3-bones-in-each-ear segment I turned the volume down to preserve mine.
Amazing body fact: if you take all the bones in the human body, you'll have enough to make a skeleton
The human body is crazy yo
Who had that tingling feelinh after this video
My body certainly is amazing.
this channel is so smart! Great!
I truly missed their quality videos. Welcome back guys!! 👍
You should do the science of dance including every basic type like (ballet, jazz, tap, hip hop tumbling, pointe contemporary)
Then how can you break your femer (leg)🤔

You know what I just realized?    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have the same music for every video, but it never gets old.
Lungs are actually the hardest working organ in the body
0:35 what’s up with that threehundred? No time to re-record? Editing mistake?
Nick Crompton’s body is amazing

I'm amazing!! :D

WOAH
Ugh IT’S OESOPHAGUS U FREAK 😂😂 not esophagus
oesophagus is not spelled esophagus... Americans
Allah swt is amazing
Congrats on trending! Number twenty-one right now.
oh so cool
Super!!!!
Y is the dudes nipples covered in the thumbnail😂
Please stop it with the childish music. It takes away my focus from the video and it makes the video itself seem less serious. This is not just a personal opinion, I know a plenty of people who thinks the same.
Can y'all talk like u in the U.S  stop saying kilometers say in feet or yards or miles not a good way to start a video
So this guy actually drew the cartoon genetailia including hair of pubis, then censored it..
I wish he used American measurements.
Why is everyone turned on by the man boobs being blurred
It’s not amazing, it’s evolution. And wtf is up with the blurred out nipples on the dude? Seems like some social justice bullshit.
Why the heck is the dude’s chest censored in the thumbnail ???
Why the hell did you censor the male nipples?
Why did you censor the males chest in the thumbnail?
Why is the man in the thumbnail have his nipples censored. Nipples aren't private parts
Why is the Mans Chest blurred? Lol editing mistake
Any one else wondering why the boys nipples are covered?
Beautiful!  There's no God.\nRight?  Right?  Obviously this can be simply explained, unlike science.
ANYONE ELSE WONDER WHY THE DUDES CHEST IS CENSORED
click bait
Why males nipples in thumbnail blurred
da clickbait got me
Ewwww thats descusting
I jerked off
Why is the guys nipples censored?
Why is the guys nipple censored?
Why do you blur da mans nipps?
True Friends lovers will always understand each other. Jokes that will live forever 😊
You really shouldn't be so dismissive of Fenty Beauty, there really are some great products in the line. The foundation is beautiful if you have normal to combo skin, unfortunately mine is too dry. The powder highlighters are great, trophy wife (the yellow one) is beautiful (on all skin tones) if used with a light hand and blended out. My favorite is Hu$tla Baby & Mean Money, those are gorgeous and all of the highlighters work very well as eyeshadows. The lip gloss is fantastic, reminds me of Chanel Glossimer but a little less sticky + it works well layered over other nude lipsticks or lip liners. The eye shadow palette is meh, overpriced and had loads of fallout. The eye liners are pretty cool and the new lip products are good.
Please do a jewellery collection video :)
Girl, I am living for the long vlogs!!! 😍😍😍
Such a cute vlog💗💗
Cute!!
No, too depressing lmao
There is a back applicator. I got mine at the beauty supply store

haha! autumn smurf <3
I just looooove your vlogs :)
Love the skirt!
❤️u though 😘😊
Press that button so fast when i saw that video  on my feed lol such a huge fan !!! those clothes are giving me major autumn envy but on my island we only get two seasons: summer and winter ( it is a tropical island !) i would kill for your wardrobe ( like not literally tho !) Lots of love from New Caledonia x
You where right about that song in the car, you where singing the chorus tho so you gotta wait :) loved the vid A x
Try the new Diorskin Forever concealer. It’s even better than Nars Creamy x
Love your vlogs 😉 p.s. I'm on instagram kaprizina_style
Re:  fake tanning your own back. You can actually attach a tanning mitt to any long-handled implement, even a fish-slice, so you can reach down your back. It's a bit awkward, but it works!!
Dear Amelia could you please send me your Eyeglasses link, if you have it. Am in love with them 😍😝👌✨
''Like Mac And Cheese in Friends!''  Amazing, thank you Amelia xD <3
I was literally just watching the MAC and CHEESE episode in friends!
First: this comment isn't because I have watch the video. But I missed Amelia and Essie Button vlog ... seeing this combo it's a rare now.. but thanks again for making the good video, full of real beauty stuff etc... 🤗🤗

I loved how smiley Duke looked with his cone! He's really cute and it is great to see him in a good mood specially because every single dog feels miserable with it on.
The long skirt is amazing on you!
for correcting i use born this way radiant concealer - it has a yellow undertone. then i use nars radiant creamy concealer.
What nail polish are you wearing?? Love it!!
Not used my bourjois healthy mix in ages, it looks so nice on you so definitely going to reach for it next time! Your new hair looks gorgeous 💇🏽🌸

Love your vlogs ❤️your new hairstyle looks amazing I want to get a fringe soo bad
“Noo too depressing” back to sam smith song and sing along 😹😹 you are literally me Amelia 😹
I was in Richmond Park too that sunday, would I have loved to see you both girls 😘
Omg, I never liked fringes BUT you changed my mind! You look amazing 😻😻✨✨✨
When you say something from Friends and people know what you mean. Instant bonding :)
Every time your wear your Stuart Weitzman over the knee boots, I swoon so hard! Seriously so timeless, but so incredibly out of my price range! One day! So beautiful on you!
try the Tarte ShapeTape concealer! its the best and lasts all day! and comes with more product for your money spent
Yaaaas!!! I missed vlogs of you two hanging out 😍😍😍
I know mac n cheese!!!
the bare minerals bareskin concealer is pretty good for a more natural look! :)
The songs she played during her car ride reminds me K109 in GTA IV in The Ballad of Gay Tony.
obsessed with the fenty foundation, its replaced everything
I am new to your channel & I love our videos & loved the but of you in your car, lol
Why did u pass on hall & oates :-(
Man Eater- Hall & Oates-( you got the lyrics completely wrong)  made me laugh.  xo
brushing my hair with the same brush that amelia has :D :D :D xoxo
I love your style so much! The bangs look beautiful. Very classy. ❤️
So nice to see you guys hanging out in your backyard and not on the run.  Jackie
Cheap zip replace it if worth it.... Love the skirt, love the long dress perfect for you, perfect sweater, jumper and wear thigh hi boots...
you two have such a cute friendship!
Glad to see you are still friends! I found you through Estee's channel
You and Estée are my faves (especially together) been waiting for an Estelia reunion. ❤️
The jumper is beautiful! But I hate it if stuff is itchy and I'm so sensitive, it's so annoying!\nCan you tell me where the cream/beige sweater from your last vlog is from? The one you wore while trying on the new stuff
AMELIA THERE IS A FAKE TAN BACK APPLICATOR !!!!! ITS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD lol I feel like for once I am making other discover smtg and not theotherway around lol <3 Here is the link :https://www.superdrug.com/Fake-Tan-Last-For-Days/Modelco-Self-Tan-Back-Applicator/p/726276
Your lip colour when you’re in the car😍😍😍what is itttt please?! Xx
That was the ooh there she goes song!!!!
You have such good taste in clothing!
Next time I go to a picnic I would have in consideration that birds could mess up my food! lol 🙈😂
I used to live by Richmond Park. I forgot about the constant planes going overhead haha. It's quite bleak but rather lovely on a frosty day 😊
The dress is beautiful :)
YAYYYY I’m so glad to see y’all reunited ❤️
I usually don't give in to hypes either!! Buttt Fenty Beauty foundation is AMAZING Amelia! Please try it and let us know :)
Hi guys! I have a beauty and fashion channel!  There's a new haul video online! Check it out! 😉 https://youtu.be/VPJE0j-DDhA 😄
For tanning my back I use the st. tropez mitt. I attach it to a back scrubber brush you can pick up at the drugstore with a hair tie. Works like a charm 😘
I LOVED that skirt!!! Ahhh ❤️
How is this on trending?
Love your hair so much Amelia!💇 Wuv Dukie too!🐶
I feel like a lot of British vloggers are dismissive of Fenty beauty. I haven't tried it because I cannot afford to at the moment but from what I've seen its a very good line, especially the foundations. But to each his own
Woooo I love a good vlog!!! There's one fresh up on my channel right now ☺️🍂🍁✌️❤️
No bangs suit you much better though
Estee looks fab.. nice to see you both together...
The back suntan applicator is called- Guy. He would do anything for you. For a new product, try NABLAS new eye shadow palette. It is AMAZING!!!!!
Amelia we want a steamer review I see it peaking in your mirror \nDo you find it easy to use. Does your clothes come out perfect.
Ehy does your videos became 20 min' and more???????
The yellow Fenty highlighter is not Kilowatt, the whole range of highlighters is called Killawatt, but the one you're both referring to is called Trophy Wife ;) And I agree about the hype, ultimately, Riri or no Riri, it's a brand riding on another brand. The only cool thing about it is the range of colors for darker skinned people, which is worth the praise!
LA - better lifestyle to live, so chill
I say we kill this thing before it breeds. Oh who am i kidding this thing will never be able to breed. JUST LOOK AT IT!!!
New York for sure. New York has such a buzz and it's so full on. Nothing is done half arsed and there is so much to see and do. I just came back from America and I would 100% go back there its so amazing and beautiful I'll never forget it. Btw love u so much queen xo cya sis
8:43 put the speed to 0.5 i died HAHHAHAHAAHHAH
do a makeup tutorial using only products from priceline dal
It says I’ve added your snapchat “michealwearsmac” but I have never seen any of your story’s you have put up and I added you months ago?? Do you just not post? Or xx
Michael I wish you could just have your own show on here daily because the rest of these people are so freaking fake as hell.....I love your tutorials and your content kills me when I am laughing so hard my lashes are coming off from the tears....uuuuggghhhh they make me sick.....you and Alissa Ashley I love yall.....but you are my boo thang for sure
Does the maybelline powder  give any flash back?

I really like NYC cause I'm someone who appreciates seasons and LA thinks it's always summer
NYC- I'm a big broadway fan so...obviously
New York because I have alot of my family that lives in New York xx
I hate it when  Australian beauty influencers make full face of drug store products and yet over half the products you cant purchase in Aussie stores
Can I just say that that tiny little brush Michael had bees using for highlight is the funniest thing ever because everyone (Shani) keeps stealing his highlight brushes 😂😂 QQ
I'm still shocked men do this.
i love ny. the fashion there is so much more creative where as to LA everyone is stereo typical kylie jenner look-alikes
New York cause I live there and I've never been to la also the shopping in manhatten is on point they know the game
I think the wet n wild glitter is body glitter I MADE THAT SAME MISTAKE
I love your hair like this q 😍
It’s truly impossible to not laugh watching your videos. I fucking love you and your confidence. Major props hun 🖤🖤🖤
I like this palette so mach.
What is that. Plz identify
new york all day baby!! #nybornandraised
Nothing beats Manhattan. It is where I feel at home.
new idea for makeup https://goo.gl/rGMuJ4
those lashes look so good on you!
Can u pls do a video of re creating a look from a few years back q rock on 🤙🏼
Are you happy with yourself?
I prefer NYC because I've grown up in cities that are very similar and not too far away from where I'm from. Also I love all the excitement and the attitude of NYC. I'm super inspired by NYC you can be whoever you want and no one cares! 💓 love this video dal 💕
I loooove makeup revolution so much, they're super cheap even with conversion to aud!
Just wanted to say you're an absolutely amazing friend for going with Shani to get her boobs done and take care of her. Props to you lovie
Can we get a before and after of your weight loss journey soon?? I need some real inspiration lol ily
Anyone know the song which is in his introduction??
I love New York City because I feel free and there’s so much diversity
You're so beautiful ! Keep being you
I DIED when you got the brush in your eye!!!!! SUCH A DRAMATIC MOMENT 😂😂😂😂
I ‘ V E    J U S T    F U C K I N G    A T E     F O U N D A T I O N
I read somewhere that Margot Robbie blends her foundation into her hair line with a toothbrush/clean spoolie! I’ve tried it and it’s ACTUALLY that good 😘
Love this! I'm a socal babe, so I'd have to say LA all the way. Also will be saying at the mo mo all day, look for it on my own channel. ;) xx
This is my first video I'm watching of your's and I love you
Love you Michael. Your videos are amazing.
I saw an adorable dog at my sports game and the owner let me pet her so I asked what's her name and she say bindi and I immediately said BINDIIIIIIII and thought of you ❤️
This video made me\nLaugh so much qqqqq
This look suits you so much Hun 🤘🏽X
Cancer,we need to kill this creature
New York is hella crowded! But New York is just a place to visit like a bucket list place to visit. LA is just yaaaas.
New York is amazing! The food, the diversity, and the culture is my favorite
I lovvvve LA but it’s kinda dirty in a lot of places (especially compared to Melbs)
Deffo one of my favourite youtubers!! one of the realist out there💁🏻
I love that you start the video quickly, no long introduction 😛
Could you do a full face of makeup revolution😍❤️🤙🏼
I’m not letting this transgender fuck nowhere near Russia he’ll be shot on sight if any of our soldiers see this monster
I've never been
Are you a lesbian or gay bodybuilder?
When u showed the Wet n Wild glitter I instantly thought of Lily's MAC gold glitter... and then later u said might channel my inner Lily Brown and put it in my inner corners 😂😂😂  LOVE IT DAL
This faggot looks like a young, gay Alec Baldwin
NYC is gorg! Times Square is horrendous to get around, but Chelsea, Brooklyn and Little Italy are some of my favourite areas in New York. To get a full taste of the city, you need to be there for a week, at least. The treck to fly there from Perth is shit though. I’d recommend going to Europe next, as it’s so beautiful and cultural! 😊
can't get enough of your looks! 💙💚
I know ur gay but do u have to wear makeup
oi faggot, kys
Gay ass nigga
The la girl

Directioners❤ look at the recent top 50 of this week 🔥\n(One direction members are ruling the world now)\n#35 Too much too ask : Naill\n#23 Get low : Liam\n#19 Bedroom floor : Liam\n#14 Flicker : Niall\n#13 Back to you : Louis\n#9 Just like you : Louis\n#3 Dusk till Dawn : Zayn\n\nWE NEED A SONG HARRY :(
2 days and I heard the song for my first time
Zayn must be proud af of his husband
I love it 💖 POLAND 💖
The next day, some fan would be writhing on your bedroom floor, Liam.
Not bad, I like this one better ^^
I don't like it ...
It's good but the beat should be more hard hitting
it's perfect😍I love you💓💓
YOU'RE VOICE WAS SO AMAZING, LOVE!
Well I'm jealous too. Liam you got me feeling so high 😂 Your voice is 😍
he can do so much better...frustates me to see zayn and him both not finding their place in music
I say this is  a huge step up from get low (didn't like it too much :/)I love this one though!
never fail to be impressed by these amazing boys! xoxo
why does this remind me of a perfume commercial ( NO HATE TOWARDS HIM I LOVE HIM SO MUCH  AND THE LYRIC VID SO YEA  )
I LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH ❤️❤️😀
Just wondering liam and louis music genre sounds like zayn
This sounds like such a Maroon5 song
I was driving, this song played, he hit the high notes, I'm typing this from heaven
Mate! This song is awesome! Such a good tune! This is going to be top 3 on billboard charts for sure!
1st time listen----bullshit\n2nd time listen---oh it's better than strip that down\n3rd time listen----im liking this\n4rth time----------wow\n5th time------------its a fucking masterpiece.
This song is getting better and better everytime i hear it..
He need more recognation my baby:(
this isn’t that good.
Now wait, I got Louis, Niall, and Liam this week can I Harry and Zayn too?
THIS MONTH IS SO BLESSED LIKE, ZAYN'S COLLAB WITH SIA THEN LOUIS' SONG JUST CAME OUT THEN LIAM'S SONG THEN NIALL'S SONG AND HIS FLICKER ALBUM AND THEN HARRY'S TOUR LIKE AFDKGAKSVKAHSJAAH
High notes by liam
I LOVE THIS SONG first time listening to it and I got the song stuck in my head
He's so talented 👑👑 I love his voice 😍😘😘😘
good song but still feels like something is missing in it...maybe drops or second half lyrics rhymes.....cant figure it out often......
Anyone else realized the font at the beginning is very similar to Louis’?
Don’t attack me but I like the production and I like his voice, but the lyrics are just not that good.
anyone else come for lil Aaron or just me?
That high note just killed meon my tombstonedeath by the high note in bedroom floor
Liam: Don't make me bring up your dirty laundry\nMe: (Niall's voice) Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry\n\nBoth songs same theme\n\n\n\nHmm... interesting, but that's none of my business\n\n\n\n\nLol I'm joking.
This song is so dammn good 😜😜😍😍😍😃😃😃😇😇😇😉🍑
Liam voice sounds like Adam Levine... LOL... Remember me to Maroon 5 old style 😍😂
An improvement from Strip That Down
At first its not that good but after sometime its on next level
I'm so proud of liam like a proud mother☺
This sounds sooo good!!!! love it!♥♥♥♥
Parts of the video are aesthetic, I love it, and the high notes of Liam . . . perfection. 💕

Liam es el mejor en lo que hace 👌👌
My best friend is just like Shane omg it's like seeing us awh
I can relate to their story so much but I wish I was half as brave as shane, this vid  made me happy for them and it was truly inspiring. lol dis bitch hoping that i can try something like this one of these days
hes is everything 💕💕💕💕 i love him 😍
I WAS SMILING THE WHOLE VIDEO
SHE IS MAKING THE FCKING LOOK AGAIN! 18:00 - 18:05
Who does like the dinosaur chicken nuggets?
i remember when i was 13 i bought your shirt from hot topic. I'm 21 now LMAO
Look at her face at 17:26 she is doing it again.
Basically this is a story of Shane being too beta to actually seal the deal and actually make a move physically. She probably would have gone out with him if he made the move earlier.
A hot girl is friends with beta male, beta male confesses girl says no, now beta male needs to make video about how girl said no instead of moving on. Lmao 😂
YES I LOVED THIS
Was she in Jessica Darling’s it List???? I swear she was!!!
Damn this has me crying and laughing
these series should be:\nmy freaking past
Bitch, why the fuck am I crying in thr club right now?
Oh this is sad. Please be friends again.\nI've been on both sides of this and I really need them to solve this situation because I never did.
When she said we can watch documentaries together😩 what an angel
Kind of but not really. I could have that look if i was with my best friend.
I love how she called him tf out for recording it
OMG, she's that worthless cunt from the amazing race that made her poor old father carry her shit everywhere for her.\nShe is so stupid and worthless, he had to do everything for her.\nFuck her, I hope she falls into a wood chipper.
Shane sounds like my aunt while they're having lunch 😭😂
Jump cuts after every sentence. What really happens between the jump cuts?
If I hung out with Shane I would die because I would not be able to breathe I'd not stop laugh cause he's so naturally funny
THIS WAS BEAUTIFUL I'M IN TEARS Y'ALL
This is insane you inspire me Shane
Find your dad next I think he misses you
I get that it's weird for them to be meeting again, and that Shane probably still feels bad about how they left off, but it feels a bit like he's angry at her for not feeling the same way that he felt, and after he says certain things she looks very uncomfortable.\n\nBut hey I don't want to go too much into it because I don't know everything that's going on with them, same as everyone else that watches Shane's videos.
This is fucking great
Does anyone else think this was at least partially manufactured to relaunch her channel? She hadn't been posting almost anything until about two months ago and now she's posting almost daily.
Was she his lesbian friend? I am wondering
Omg I'm crying I'm glad your friends again😊
17:58 I don't care if it was planned for what she said or if they aren't together that was fucking amazing and adorable...
To all the ppl hating on Blair get a life. She legit seen him as her best friend. You can tell she genuinely ddnt think she was leading him on. And the few times she says i might of lead u on i thought we were jus friends hanging out. Yall act like jus Cuz shane wanted more she should of jus got with him. Ummmm if she did tht, then tht would of been leading him on. And also to the ppl saying it's disrespectful to Ryland yall are fools him and shane are in love. And both a very confident in their relationship and support each other. I can bet shane talked to him about this before even doing it. And if he expressed it would hurt him shane wouldn't of done it. Like for real on her channel her shane and Ryland all hang out! And they seem like they all get along. If Ryland is OK with shane being friends with his ex why would he have a problem with this. It's ridiculous how many ppl are on her channel dogging her for no reason! I highly doubt shane would want any of his fans doing tht to her. Smh.
When you spend a huge part of your life being the fat kid, having someone be interested in you fucks you up so bad because of how good it feels. Years can pass by and you still cling to the memory of the person that made you feel that way. I get Shane on such a personal level. Granted, she is allowed to say no and not accept his feelings. But I get him too cause she did sort of lead him on. They are both wrong in the end. I'm glad they are talking now. It shows how both have grown up.
Maybe Ok will be our always
Low key their gonna date in 2-3 months
I love this and can't wait for the rest of the series Shane! So emotional and real and I love it!
I know it was like a year ago but I am still not over Blair and Brodie on the amazing race 😂
I’m so happy for them
I really thought that chapter was about BLT lol
This is so amazing, I was smiling the whole video. They have really nice chemistry ❤
Is he gay? I don’t watch his channel
This is why I like Shane he does crazy ass shit 😂💘🌹🌸😘🔥☺️🤘🏻🌅
Can y’all please end up together
Both of their voices are so shaky...it makes me happy that they are being real and open! So sweet
please turn this into a series!!!
This was SO great.
Please do more videos with her.
Shane's title: confronting my first love...\nBlairs title: why Shane and I stopped being friends
Oh my God, I do that thing with the ice cream all the time! I didn't think anyone else did that!
I want to hear what ryland thinks about this series
I loved the video and I really think you should continue this series and reconnect with the people you've lost on the way. Whether you end up filming such an intimate moment or not, we support you💙
this is so cute!!
I LOOOOOVE THIS SHANE!!! I LOVE THIS! You deserve that closure, I hope you guys are friends again because she seems like she was really sad you were distant for so long.. <3
Their friendship is so cute ;-;
She's literally where I'm from, why have I never heard of her!?
that was so sweet but kinda sad but im happy you got your friend back shane!!!!!
Am I the only one relating to this like so MF hard😂
I love this series!!! More of this pls

They made him look better at the end.. hewhewheww
That barber shit was so fucking bad

This mans a pagan but he killed this
Has any one seen my barber ?
As a big fan of bugzy and walking dead this is 🔥🔥
Isit just me who thought this was gunna be a chip diss lol
Shouldn't this have a spoiler alert in the beginning....I mean some people may watch this really...really...late.
Sounds like some real fan , he called Carl car and said Tara was in the line up when she wasn’t and he also said it’s all a dream but it’s not
This is mad

Nice production, trash song

He's boring me,where did the storytelling bugzy go?
Let me talk! ... Gary: I think he wanted to talk 😂😂 umm yeah well done Gary
This better not ruin the midfield; it's our strongest asset.
I think he wanted to talk.....
They never let him Talk
This is the problem with working for Guardiola he tells his players to surround the referee with lots of noise, he did that when he was with uefalona and now he's doing the same trick with Man City. Every player surround the ref with nonsense talk but when KDB wanted talk it was too late, the ref was saturated of seeing players around him and if KDB had approach him to complaint he  would've seeing a card for complain eventhough all he was trying to do was make his point across....
I feel sorry for him
Rio Ferdinand is a bright lad, isn't he.
Word on the street is that he’s still wanting to talk
Arguments with the wife .... let me talk
Considering how events like these can unfold De Bruyne did at least manage to demonstrate a degree of restraint in his behaviour. While he may come across as having a tantrum, in the context of being in an emotionally charged situation he shows some restraint.
Let him to taaaaalk got damn it 😅😅
i think de bruyne wanted to talk
Well it is on the channel that said its good too talk.
He sounds like a baby
Will Kevin De Bruyne ever talk? Find out after the break.
Let the man talk, jeez
I wish these muppets would retake their English O'levels (GCSE's) and learn how to talk.
Just LET HIM TALK!
who else came for the comment likes???
I think he wanted to talk.
Kevin de brune has just signed for real Madrid
Alright De Bruyne dont have a baby cry... USE UR WORDS MAN
Check out this app 👉    https://sweatco.in/i/yasin253627 ... It pays for walking
Can he talk at Stoke on a rainy night though?
I know that feeling when someone gets in your way.
When the misses starts on a night out
De bruyne should leave city and go to a better club lol, just angry cuz all city wins are cuz of him
When they don’t understand
All Kevin wanted to do was talk for gods sake
I like the part where he says let me talk
He needs to call childline, I'm sure they will listen
And this is why footballers should never be allowed to speak.
I missed the part where he wanted to talk
This is difficult to watch...
I think he wants to talk Cheers Gary
What is Ollie doing out of goal?
Something tells me he wanted to talk
Come on now.....let's just sit down and talk about this.
I actually felt bad for det bry
Gary at the end killed me  I think he wanted to talk
Much more dramatic at 0.25 speed
Typical man city no unity built on money no room for passion.

I'm so proud of my kid
I'm really impressed with your work this year and previous one but this song is damn nice 😍
Niall just broke and healed my heart at the same time! What a talent this man is *tear*
This is my favorite song. Creates so many emotions. Your voice is perfect niall
This song is amazing !!\nI love it 😍❤
This is so beautiful..
This song has so much feels 😭💞✨
What has happened to him?He's changed so much!
This. This is the last song I ever want to hear. Specifically this acoustic version. It settled my soul so much. And all I want to do it like this video a million times. And listen to it a billion times on repeat as I sleep, I feel it would bring me good dreams.
I WANT TO HUG HIM RIGHT NOW
Why you like that Niall! You made me cry on your new song! I l love you!
Niall's the best!
Hearing that I get emotional 😭😍😍
honestly this song has been on repeat all day i love it !!!!! He and Harry have the best music out all the boys (just my opinion) I love it !!!!!! He needs a grammy
I wanna buy the cd of his album\nHow much is it?\nWhich shop in cmabodia?
He is the greatest good we are ever gonna get!
This is absolutely beautiful😭 I've been a 1D fan since the very beginning although when they went their separate ways it was a sad moment for all of us  directioners, but now they're showing us their true talents and giving us a taste of their musical preferences. and they're all so different and crazy talented😭💕 niall and harry got me on my feels though!
I can’t get enough of this 💕
I LOVE HIS MUSICVIDEOS THEY ARE SO NATURAL AND NOT WITH 10000 WOMANS....
IM SO FUCKING SAD BUT SO PROUD OF HIM. They've all matured so well
Lovely song. I bought the album yesterday and I listened it. Beautiful
skull productions when I thing them I m started to crying PLEASE PLEASE COME BACK ONE DIRECTION PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
I don't even have the right words to say how extremely proud I'm of you. This was beautiful. Watching you, and other boys becoming so much more than just boys from the stairs is simply irreplaceable. I'm grateful too be the part of this journey. \nI love you x
he is so beautiful
Those who love everything related to sports with Extreme that will take a minute and enter my new channel that deals with sports, bodybuilding, all kinds of extreme things crazy and funny videos, I'm  also doing a give away, details in the new video. Enjoy!
Niall... Your voice keeps getting more and more soothing👏
ive never felt so blessedt until the acoustic ver of flicker came
I  like this song
I got the album today I love every song 😍😍
he's got such a deep voice❤
well this is fucking great
his voice is good but zayn voice is awesome
Do good song, so sweet velvet voice
I absoliutely love it!!!! It is so soothing and peaceful and emotional and......
Idk about you guys but I think the boys are are releasing the perfect combination of songs rn.\nHarry has the crazy rock and alternative songs that makes you but want to go crazy and scream out the lyrics in your bedroom.\nNiall has the sentimental, sweet songs that make you want to bawl your eyes out and listen to it as you sleep.\nLouis has the honest, soft pop and EDM songs that makes you want to go on a road trip or ride a train going to the city as you sing along in your head.\nLiam has the tropical pop songs that are a tad bit naughty but that’s what makes it fun and it’s just light and relaxing and it makes you want to dance all day long.\nZayn has the R&B and pop songs that’s just so full of incredible vocals that you wouldn’t mind listening to all day with some friends.\nA mixture of that and you’ve got a rollercoaster of feeling waiting for you. And I think that’s beautiful.
this man has been hurt again by a girl again
This guy makes honest beautiful music ! Wonderful!!!
The sound is freakin beautiful. I'm.....
I’m in love with his voice
Theory: this song is about 1D's hiatus
Perfect as always love...❤❤❤

All the 1d boys are doing so well
It's one of my favourite song of his album
his voice is so relaxed\n*I love him*\n(I hope he isn't a commercial product like other celebrities)
I love all four of them but considering what type of music I have always loved the most, Niall is my favourite. But just think about how we have solo music for all moods.
THIS is what is needed in today's world of hatred and war...peaceful relatable songs..thank you Nialler❤

GET EDDIE BRAVO ON ASAP TO TALK ABOUT LAS VEGAS SHOOTING!!!
In relation to Kathleen Turner, you obviously haven't met anyone with hypothyroidism...
Joe can be such a douche bag dick
This guy reminds me of Bill Burr
JOE ROGAN,\n\nWHAT MAN SENT WHICH BOY TO WHAT RANCH  ?
Fuck I can't handle the change :'(
And Dan Brown did not have  a hand in the making of those movies they've fucked those ups
Hello from the Downtown Eastside Vancouver Canada! Congrats on the new Studio Joe and team!!\nMy boyfriend and I love the podcasts! Keep them coming!
Joe:   'You DUMB CUNTS!     \nI love you joe
how about some coloured ambient lighting for the new room Joe? make it nice and trippy please sir✊
It wasn't only right wing or pro-Trump talking points being propagated by Russians sock puppets. It's all kinds of issues. It's been going on for a long fucking time. And I'm no Trump supporter. Seriously, it's irresponsible to spread shit like this. And Fitzsimmons is surprisingly naive.
Finally someone is talking about  The Americans. Such a great show.
We are afraid of shit because it spreads bacteria and disease hence the reason we have evolved to hate the smell?
At 5:50 joe tells a lie and his eyes rat him out.  It's all good, probably slipped and smoked once
Joe Rogan is absolutely right, Hillary did NOT; have a private server, deny backup to the soldiers in Benghazi immediately upon request, hold back 95% of all donations to needy people, sick and falling down, married to a rapist. Thanks joe we had it all wrong.
Joe “he must have a dick like a palm tree” Rogan
Great show joe, please have les stroud on again ASAP he's one of my favorites.
Joe Back in the Alien days Rogan
Joe whispering, “but the n word you won’t say it.... look at you. Look. Say it” *pause* Greg, “........nigger”. Had me fucking dying.
Zeppelin is in a different universe of music from aerosmith and kiss..oldschool aerosmith is way better than any of the radio songs
Joe destroyed that queer politician who reduced the penalty for knowingly infecting someone with HIV.
Lee was legit right though. How many of us under 50 look at our cell phone while watching anything. I play ps4, watch JRE, and scroll instagram simultaneously. He's right. Lee get's too high. But, that little flying jew is probably right :)
my sister's dog get her though  places cause she's in a social anxiety disorder and that dogs tremendous and he's a pit bull and he listens every word you say
Joe I know a Guy, but don't know him Rogan
The part about the n word is so funny , the fact that its such a taboo word makes jokes about it so much funnier
hahahaha I remember that episode where Lee was talking about audio being a thing of the future!!
Joe I bet that guy has a huge hog Rogan\n\nI bet all of you that say the above secretly think Rogan has a huge hog he could wedge in between your luscious two pancakes that you hide chocolate syrup in between!\n\nRogan is the man!
Fuck who is *that* guy?
Joe doesn’t understand that when you smoke pot for a long time your dreams eventually start to fade and not be as strong and when you stop they get stronger again but also your dreams change when you start smoking pot first before they fade away.
Joe thinks everyone is in some way jacked up.
Joe Gary Clark Jr. is the only current guitarist that I know Rogan
2:15:37 getting a little too into that conversation huh?
Joey i'm basically Harvey Weinstein with a mic Diaz
E.s.a. don't have public access rights. If it was a e.s.a. service dogs are the only ones who have public access rights
Joe always falls back into leftism. Dont be someones product.
Joe rogan...Darren till ko's cerrone 2:37 into the second round you've heard it here first....by body shot ...till is the real deal.....fili knocks out lobov
The best part of this....was hearing Joe stumble through the word perpetuation. 😂
There's a comedy store comedian who I always get confused for Greg, who always attacks the audience. I always confuse him for that guy and end up not liking Greg either ...  you know who I'm talking about. I don't think he's allowed at the store anymore, but it's been imprinted and confused in my brain
Rogan is gonna talk himself out of smoking weed. There goes 3/4 of his fan base.
Joe ... stop staring at the camera I'm to high for that shit.
Get some colorful shit on your wall bro. Too bland.
hilarious magic johnson voice....more like morgan freeman ....funny as hell
3:27:41 one of the funniest moments in history
god damit joe, know i really want to know more about this michael jackson dead baby scandal
I laughed every couple minutes the entire last hour, great show
Joe's first day back on weed, should be the Diaz brothers on the podcast. It's probably going to be Ari, Burt and all them, which makes sense, but still.
Wolfhybrids have been around for 65+years
Joe this is your best podcast in ages. You are you. Comments are so funny, its the same guy from X Factor..
I would literally cut off a toe if it meant you'd get Die Antwoord on the show...\n\n\n\nNot my toe, but you get the point.
I have two English Bulldogs. They're angels from heaven. They chase balls all day. They are best friends with every new dog that comes around.
I AM NOT SHITTING YOU OA STARTED SO GOOD BUT BECAME THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT OF MY LIFE,  STOP NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN.
So theres a video were joey farts on lees penis and he fowards the procedure by saying it puts the lotion on its skin or else it gets the holes again '
Joe, your Bulldog was originally bred to take on full grown bulls! It goes straight at them, locks onto the bulls face, nose covered and in the dogs mouth. It holds the F on in a battle to what it considers and in many cases is, death. Most of the time, the DOG wins! It exhasts the Bull eventually and it drops. It then can be roped and delt with without human damage. Tough life for a dog. Valuable tool they can be...
Joe please get Noah Galloway on your show! He has a great story.
Shitting in a toilet is a Roman thing. Anyone else shitting in a a toilet instead the woods is racist.
Joe always brings up the thing about agressive men being seen as a boss, and aggressive women being seen as a bitch, but it's just not true. Can you honestly tell me that you've never met a man that was bitchy, or a woman that was on her grind that wasn't a bitch? I honestly think that women are just more likely to act bitchy for some reason, it probably has an important purpose that isn't obvious to us.
no joe. from your position it is easy to be butthurt and upset.  check your history on dreadlocks esp in a sport dominated by African americans.  it is weird for an asian dude rocking dreads in the NBA.  you can't see that?  Black people straightened their hair for years to try to assimilate.  Black women still do it. how did that work out?  there was a huge movement in the 60s to be natural. i don't give a fuck but try and think deeper about it all.  your knee jerk reactions are simpleminded btw i don't agree with the earring bullshit
I thought new studio was a joke.
holy fuck can we just get a podcast just about dicks please!
Gotta love the negative comments on what Joe and Greg say 2 hours into the podcast, why watch something your just going to criticize for over 2 hours. How Dare You
Stir it up, little Rogan’s stir it up
why tf hasnt louis ck been on here yet?
You know about a potential baby death and you don't report it!? You might as we kill a baby yourself.
Greg is poor man's Bill burr
Joe:”say it” (pause) Greg:”nigger” 😂😂😂😂😂 I’m dying!!!! 😂😂😂
Perpetuation that's a weird word (when you speak American English). \n Weinstein is one sexy guy tho.. Gotta love ((hollywood producers)).
Grateful Dead sold out shows all over the world. ..no radio play
I love Joe. Big fan. But perpetuation is a weird word? Aight.
Cool podcast! Plz get Diane Hamilton on the show, as an expert in the field of a worldviews in general. She is an author, psychologist and a legit zen roshi (master). She can clarify a lot of religion vs rationality or political divisions stuff, and even elaborate on the yoga and breathing techniques of a Rickson Gracie.  It should be interesting.  One can check her talk for Google at YT.  Chears ;-)
psssst... i do enjoy the wide frame shot. its cool to see two guys just talking sometimes. It's always cutback to close face shots. Give us a second of just two guys talking. Thanks young Jamie and mother nature! Love y'all!
Studio is too bright and where the hell are the intake pictures?!?! Looks weird without them.
love from Sweden! oh by the way... you shoud sheck out the oldest psy trance dj (goagill) that is pretty cool if you coud make him come over to your show.. like 80 years old or something. Peace!
Joe I really like your show! But I don’t agree with your view of service dogs. \n\nThey definitely shouldn’t be taken into restaurants like what you provided as an example, but they do a lot of good for combat vets that suffer from ptsd, as well as people who suffer meltdowns because of their autism.\n\nThank you for doing your show!
Good job , keep on,  get nick or nate
WTF. What are you trying to do to me? I recently found your channel.  Now I am SO addicted.  Watching you, is like looking in the mirror except I can't express my thoughts as you do.  Love it. Thanks for the channel!!!
1:13:13 You forgot the possibility of using drugs that can make you gain a significant amount of weight in a short period of time. Like some antidepressants.
All I know... is... that... dinosaurs and African American dinosaurs are the future
Put Richard spencer on the show
Get Grant Morrison or Warren Ellis on here...
I love tits Simmons
Get Norm on
2:22:41 is awkward AF
tom hanks is an asshole
Haha that was funny af 2:27:45
Poor Kathleen Turner.
Joe is flaunting his money.
hot loads
Joe's funnier sober
Joe he tapped into something rogan
Joe I like elk meat Rogan
Invite Jim Carrey  and/or Bill Murray!  Those podcasts would be absolutely tremendous.
Get Steven Paddock on.
Greg stop shaking please.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdWMQxbnBWA
Perpetuation
Greg's a skinny prick.
fucked up with the shiba theyre always dicks
More Jamie please, and more regular Redband episodes. I miss that crazy fuck.
Jim Carey please Joe! would be amazing!
Joe, please get Frankie Boyle. Combo with Russel. Call Russel and ask his thoughts. Even if you stream him in.\nMiss the old Joe though\nEveryone does. Each to his own I suppose.
I didn't think I would like this at first but I was very wrong. I love it so much!

Это просто восхитительно! :з Аааа, тащусь
A alguien ma le hizo recierdo a un video de Michael Jackson xd
Trump's new tax plan actually could help solve this issue. Simpler taxes could lead to businesses like H&R Block going out of business.
This is the process we have in the uk. Unless your self employed the government just takes your taxes automatically. If u pay to much tax once a year u will get a tax rebate. It works just fine.
Hey cool an Adam ruins everything clip that's doesn't call me a racist. Nice
Dagnabbit this is why we can’t have nice things
come on man I work at a tax store don't tell em its a scam XD
*The Federal Mafia, by Irwin Schiff* - read it. A book which explained how federal income tax is technically illegal, was banned in a country with free speech, and resulted in the author dying in prison over it.
In austria taxes are payed before you get your money...so you get your money after taxes are already withdrawn. at the end of the year you can check your taxes at an online site and tell check some boxes and fill some forms to get some money back.
Wow. Lots of people don't understand the purpose of taxation under a fiat currency. Look up Moser and the Purpose of Taxation here on YouTube.
i'd rather do taxes myself, i would never trust the gov/IRS to decide how much i overpaid them. i'm pretty sure i would get hardly anything back.
There is no underlaying law that dictates a person has to pay taxes.  Yet you are forced to pay taxes to the IRS so they may be able to pay national debt to the Federal reserve.  The Federal reserve is a privately owned bank that works like a corporation, but has the legal ability to print us money, but in turn, charges the US to do so.  In turn, this raises the debt owed.  The US is not allowed to audit the Federal reserve for any means or reason.  \n\nI'm truth, the modern tax system is theft upon the US individual.  There is no reason for there being tax codes being more than 74k pages.  You are forced to pay a tax amount against your will even though there's no true law stating that not filling your taxes is against the law.\n\nThe Federal reserve is part of this issue.  \n\nTaxation upon our populace caused a war once before.\n\nA president caught the mainstay of Banks and one.\n\nIt will happen again.
Yet another reason why capitalism is fucking bad!
i think theres just a little disregard for what is actually free in this video, even if the government did it for us wouldnt that involve increase in irs budget? (sell that one) if you just want to be socialist you can just say it lol
I love the UK more and more each day
It's easy to say the government could handle it, but the IRS has been losing talent and receiving reduced funding for years. They need money, but they are really easy to hate.
Wow this one really got me upset, so much so that I had to contact someone about it.\n\nSo I spoke with an enrolled agent, and while it sounds great to have the IRS do your taxes for you, the big issue isn't the income, it's the deductions.  Because of the the varying deductions people can have that the IRS knows nothing about (charity giving as an example) they can't figure out exactly what you owe.  \n\nI know the end of that part of the segment kind of suggested that we could correct it, but that is apparently why audits happen, because people take deductions they can't prove.  The filing is to make you prove your deductions.\n\nJust wanted to add some additional information from what I learned talking to someone about it.  Really wish it was that easy.\n\nAnd screw the companies lobbying to keep it hard so they can make money.  That is BS.
I asked this question like 15 years ago when I did my first taxes.  Why is the US so ass backwards.
We believe we're smarter than monkeys that just wear clothes and ascribe prestige to the monkey with the biggest hat 🙄 a closer look at ANYTHING we do will ruin this false reality we created
Thank you Adam for reminding me of humanity's relentless greed and cruelty yet again.
Wish you happy new day, visit your channel offline
Murica: Capitalism at its finest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd no I'm not a commie, it's just a maymay
Most most American video ever
Jeribo Sinkler from The Hard Times of RJ Berger! Awesome!
Diving retarded country.. Only merica . Other countries tell you exactly how you need to pay them..
Guide to politics in the USA:\nCommon sense policy < Lobbying
I read that as why texus suck and why it doesn't have to
Meh, this isn't the real reason why taxes suck. Taxes suck because there is way too much taxation going on and IMHO, Income Tax is theft.
This show is depressing. Literally everything is a fucking scam or other corrupt bullshit. We all fell asleep at the wheel. This country is on its way down. Be sure to high five a Roman emperor on the way out
Why is the last 8 seconds louder than the rest of the video every time?\nAdam, ruin how you guys ruin my ear drums every video just to be sure I hear you tell me the title of your show and when/where to watch it.
And nothing is going to change dope.
And Americans are shouting to the rest of the word : You're a bunch of corrupt people, not me. Ah! The foul stench of double standard is in the air.
That is one fucked up Country you yanks have. In the UK it's entirely automatic unless you are earning income from investments, even then it's really simple.
This comment section is full of dumbasses, we need our taxes, if we didn't play taxes then how would we keep our roads in good condition, buildings wouldn't be up to code cause the government can't pay to inspect, we wouldn't have police officers fire fighter, and welfare for the illegals. We need taxes
Thought CollegeHumor would go libertarian there for a second \nBut no they're still dirty statists
GET READY TO SPEND YOUR APRILS WITH ME!!!!!!!!!
Id watch on trutv if I could... but I live in Austria so im stuck streamin'...
The guy in the thumbnail looked like Gordon from Sesame Street
you know, there is a price to pay when you're a greedy person. the price you might pay is your life. my question is. how hungry is the government for money? enough to start a war?
It's fine if you work for a company but if you work for yourself and/or have multiple income streams its still complicated. Plus deductions. A national sales tax would be the most simple and moral approach to taxes. Imagine being able to pay less taxes by spending less rather than paying less taxes by either making less or buying more (deductions).
Turkey used this system up until 2008. US is still using that shitty system? Funny
Sorry Adam they just want you to make mistakes so they can kick your ass all through the justice system and fine the shit out you.
This is one of the few episodes I like, and agree with.
This would also massively cut down on fraud since a criminal can't file for you.
Can we just kill all of the lobbyists? Please?
The only things Adam consistently ruins are reason, sound research practices, and masculinity.\n\nHere are a few reasons he's wrong (as usual) this time:\n\n1. Government preparation of returns would require payers of income—employers, financial institutions, even governments writing benefits checks—to incur costs by significantly moving up reporting deadlines for the IRS to get the information in enough time so that tax refunds are not delayed. Advocates of return-free filing conveniently ignore these third-party costs. A study or two has suggested that third-party costs would range from $500 million to $5 billion annually and would fall disproportionally on small businesses and therefore indirectly benefit the bigger corporations with which small businesses must compete.\n\n2. The IRS is a lumbering behemoth. Its computer systems have long been plagued with problems and cost overruns, as pointed out by the Government Accountability Office and others. A 2003 Treasury report found that under the current complex tax code, providing taxpayers with pre-filled returns would add to the workload of the IRS. Clearly, additional investment in staff, equipment and facilities would be required... which would require, you guessed it, higher taxes to pay for.\n\n3. Checking your government-prepared tax return for accuracy would take about the same work and time as preparing your own from scratch. Unless you're going to just trust them to be 100% accurate and honest, what's the point?\n\n4. He looks like just like the Adoring Fan from Oblivion.\n\n5. Taxation is theft.\nlolololol i said it too XD
People wonder why people are kneeling for the anthem. Shit we do everything wrong in this country😂
Taxes were never fun to begin with
The govt doesn't do anything for free.  It pays people to do things.\nDuh.
probably wouldn't work. tax laws are just too complicated. it could work for simple employees but not for the other groups
Why don't you Americans just move to Europe? It's easy here in Denmark.
Anonymous takedown of Freefile and Turbo Tax please? Destroy their business around the end of March and get a big deal made out of it :)
I live in Japan. The government sends me my taxes by post, I go to the convince store and give them the money and it's all finished.
In Spain we have a program called Mother which tells you how much you have to pay (or be paid) and you only change stuff if there is something wrong or you have some special income or charge.
Let’s sum this up in 4 words: \nThe government sucks balls. \n\nI believe the federal government should be as small as it can be, without having a revolution. \n\nA quote I heard somewhere: \n\nGuy: “We need the government because people are evil and we can’t rely on them” \n\nOther guy: “The government is made of people.”
We are just modern day slaves. The government owns us and has and always will.
adam, can you just shut up?
Man I'm glad I live in Australia!
Lobbying in the USA always astounds me. How Americans allow their government be so influenced by money and 'legal corruption' is shocking! 'The land of the free' in corporate chains - policies around guns, food, healthcare, clean energy, even tax all controlled by for-profit companies paying millions to control laws in order to make more money, no matter the impact on people. Scary! As far as I know lobbying is illegal in most other countries around the world...
Boycott, Boycott, Boycott.
Taxation is theft.
Taxation is theft
Jejejejeje
Insert Ancap Meme Here
They suck because they suck
Basically America sucks...
Taxation is theft
Jeez, America is corrupt. :(

Libertarian heven)
Fucking lobbyists
Next: Adam ruins feminism
L\nLl\nK. .
Adam ruins income taxes... oh wait, income taxes ruin EVERYTHING!
CAPITALISM BABY ✌😃👍
Shithole US 😑
God damn corporate greed.
I swear I already seen this
kill em all .....
Taxation is theft.
Ha ha ha Americans...
Taxation is extortion.
Taxation is theft
Simpler solution: simplify tax code
How about repealing the 16th Amendment so we don't have to pay taxes at all!  We could actually re-establish the concept called FREEDOM!
I only have a problem with income taxes. I don't want my hard earned money going to bums and welfare queens.
how is adam not being held custody by the gov. yet?
Tax is theft this video is bullshit
Nice..Check Out My Page For Free Beats!🔥💯🚨
This is BS. The government doesnt know where all your money goes. If they did return free filing it would get rid of most deductions and nobody would pay on self employment income.
Hah! How about the government has nothing to do with your taxes at all. Its all ran by the private central banking mafia racket. Theres no law passed by congress ever that states you have pay a tax from your income. You go to jail for failing for faulting on a loan agreement. Thats all income tax is. The irs is not ran by the government.
'Adam ruins your life' next please \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks
This channel has lost millions of subscribers because it is LIBERAL PROPAGANDA
STOP calling all Taxation theft -_- you need some form of taxation to fund BASIC government services and infrastructure(like the road you drive on) . Who wants to drive on a private road everyday that you have to pay a toll to the owner ? Or when you call the cops you need to have a burglary plan ? Or whip out that credit card when the private firefighters come or they won’t put out your house ? No I’m not defending the nut cases (who’s political leanings shall remain anonymous) who want the government to tax us at 60+ percent to forcibly grow entitlements , government itself (and give no one the option to opt out of) or waste that money on their political projects to create a “utopia”.. that is theft ...but cmon even I know the government might be garbage but has it’s uses...sometimes
Taxation is theft.
All these people hate the idea of paying taxes, but they sure love commenting online on the internet that runs on an infrastructure built by spending tax money.
thank Trump he makes them simpler
CH is shit now
ADAM RUINED COLLEGE HUMOR
TAXATION  **IS** THEFT!    \n\nour natural rights precede the powers of government.  Therefore if you have property, like a paycheck, it belongs to you.  For anyone, including government, to take any part of your property without your full consent is theft.\n\nAnd for them to threaten your life, liberty, property, or pursuit of happiness unless you give them what they ask for  (sounds like organized, crime, ya?) is extortion.
Taxation is theft
Taxation is theft
Pat sounds a lot like Denzel Washington here
love his game..he plays old school defense, isn't intimidated by superstars..doesn't make friends with the opposite team and shows up rookies..
This nigga looks like that homeless dude whos camping at the court
Patrick Beverly is a hating ass old crusty bitch
I am the captain now face ass
I always said fuck Patrick Beverly ever since he tried to end Westbrook’s career. This nigga dirty smh
NBA is rigged but Beverley a bitch
Who is this hobo?
He's so dumb. He asked that man to repeat his quote then wouldn't let him talk? Literally what??
He just mad cause he had to go to the clippers
lol he looking nappy tbh but yeahh.. strong words but the truth
Reporter: You had some choice words for Lonzo.\n\nBeverley: What did I say?\n\nReporter: Should I read it to you?\n\nBeverley: Nah.\n\nReporter: Why won't you let me read it for you?\n\nBeverley: You guys have a great day, thank you.
That’s not even the mutha fcka to beat. You still got warriors, spurs and the thunder to worry about. Boa you lame as hell trying to show out over a KID. Try making it to the western finals then talk.
I agree that there are a shit ton of lonzo fans butthurt but people saying basketball is a contact sport, maybe they were like more loose with it back in the day but I think 'contact' sports have the contact as a main component like rugby or football
Man fuck dis nigga u ain’t shit come hea and I will knock yo jaw out
This guy is gay
All this coming at him is going to make him better, but Beverly should've stuck to going at him because of the hype, not because of what his dad said which is what these players are doing, that's like getting punched  by someone but then instead of punching that person back, you punch someone who didn't even take a swing at you.
That fucken wigger Ball is a weak ass pussy just like his homosexual father.... lol@ Big Baller Brand ... what a fucken joke
i miss this guy on the rockets :(
Reports are so fucking stupid!\n\nPat: So what did I say?\nReporter: Do you want me to read it?\nPat: You heard me say it. So what did I say?\nReporter: (Mumbles)\nPat: Next question? \nSame Reporter: Why don't you let me read it?
Beverley is a real one. The man plays with heart and I respect that. He go at everyone not just lonzo
This dude girlfriend just dump him for his best friend or sumthing? talk about butt hurt . . . you're embarrassing yourself
He's a hack Bro all I got to say is Lakers have 16 championships how many do the rockets have holla at me if you can guess that #beverlylookslikeaoldodb imdone
lol... welcome his young ass to that league...no thas how it's done
Who is Patrick Beverley again
He won't be talking when he plays Westbrook and Curry and they drop like 50 on his head...Bev is a bum
I'ma be a Beverly fan out of spite.
Look at his head 😂
So does this still count? Since LONZO got a double double just now? All y’all talking shit now but he just proved again in his second game?
Faggot dodging questions and lanzo is humble he had nothing to do with what his father said
If you heard the man say it just answer him what you heard, why you gotta read it lol
0:40 Simple: If you didn't hear it with your own ears DONT SPEAK ON IT.  Kind of peculiar to use that logic on a reporter since his jobs mostly second hand information. To each his own i guess.
He's a good player but damn he's a bastard
Fuck Beverley's attitude.. I don't like him laVar or Lonzo but pat is a shit baller
1.Subscribe to my channel\n2.Comment Done when Done\n3.Will Subscribe back!
I bet you Tony Allen will lock Pat up and he won't have strong Words after tho
I am a Rocket fan. Miss you Patrick! 😢
Beverly did zo a favour. Free lessons are the best. Shit...lonzo probably made 100k while learning it too. Ain't life great.
he made a bitch out of lonzo, i wanted to see lonzo throw hands but his spoiled soft ass no chance, his dad has to fight his battles.
look at this video,comments, and description. Anobodi\nhttps://youtu.be/aggwEbW5iKs
respect bev...but this nigga ugly af. look like a coloring book character
I'm not done LOL
Why can't black people pronounce ask correctly?
I bet this is the first time he was interviewed after a game in the NBA.. lavar did that for you Patrick.. you should thank him for people remembering that you are still in the league..
I didn't like Marcus Spears posting it on Twitter what Beverly said. That should of been off the record. Very slimy on his part
I miss Pat, hope he has a good season with the clippers!
Y'ALL NOT FOOLING ME THAT'S CASHNASTY
Lonzo isn't his dad. Come on pathetic men
This dude thinks he tough on young kid who I haven’t him heard him say anything cocky about his skills but only his dad. You’re too dumb to realize you’re just playing in what Lavar is stating.
Who tf this nigga think he is? Dude can ball so now he goes around talking like hes better than everybody? I don't think so pal\n\nEdit: also i am in no way defending Lonzo in this predicament, just calling out the fact that he treated that man like he was nothing (the reporter)
THE REAL STAR OF THE LAKERS THIS SEASON IS KYLE KUZMA , he was a great pick up for the lakers
i love Beverly he's that player that would decently fit in in the 90's he ain't soft he plays a clean contact game not dirty or low blows, But i predict that in the later on future Lonzo is gonna destroy beverly.
DE'AARON FOX IS BETTER THAN LONZO BALL
the reporter gotta take that L tho lmao
Beverley might get me to watch basketball again....I like this guy
That's how you handle reporters.  Fuck being mr nice.  They will judge you anyway.
Imagine if this dude was your girlfriend's dad. Dude would be so intimidating. He would not have anybody's bullshit.
Ppl too danm sensitive. No wonder why there's no more Dave Chappelle.
Lol why you all Lonzo dicksuckers mad. This guy even tried to stop Westbrook maaan 😂\nHe failed.
I'm a Laker fan, and I wouldn't have wanted Lonzo to be defended any lighter. Bev for sure showed him that the NBA isn't soft. A good wake up call
Thank you for motivating Lonzo Ball last night because he almost dropped a triple double tonight 😂
Love this dude.. I mean LONZO bounced back prettt good tonight especially against Bledsoe ( who's a solid defender hes just on a shitty team that's why people forget about him.. ) but LONZO also had a triple double tonight.. But man Beverly input that old school ( kobe,Jordan ) mind state straight locked up LONZO and let him know this is coming 24/7 and then he praises him after the game..
Beverley is actually helping Lonzo to be more tough and aware and be better I mean his dad can't play 4 him
Lonzos doing great against the Suns, Playing like #1pick
Man no homo but I love this nigga. The way he plays n his attitude is nostalgic
I’m really liking pat Beverly he’s giving clippers that edge back since Matt Barns, Kenyon Martin, and Reggie Evans, all left
Beverly looks mentally weak in this video.
Beverly looks like a former crack head that turned his life around
He is exactly like those salty ass senior in your office kicking the kids who are doing their internship,  shitty character
What a G
Lonzo answered back tonight
Fub
Anthony hamilton lookin as nigga lol

Hey Jem, where is the best supermarket to buy couverture 53/54% from? Or do you order yours through a whole sales?
Would compound chocolate effect the recipe other than taste? Does coveture chocolate set up better? This looks so good!
Hello Jemma can you please tell me. . Can I use a mini rubber molds to cool the caramel and get deferent lovely shapes of chocolate caramel?
i love baking too!!!!
Yummmm Jemma u are a genius
Hi Jemma, you're awesome. thanks for all the lovely recipes you are willing to share. \nOne request, can you do a recipe video on black forest cakes or cupcakes????
can I use a 99% dark chocolate bar? Someone gifted me two bars of 99% chocolate and I have no idea what to use it in!!
That looks so delicious! Yummy !! A very nice recipe. Have a nice weekend. Lena
could you make the Blondie's w/ this please!!!  And show us how you come up w/ the recipe?
Please make your favourite chocolate cake that yoh can layer x
I miss the Halloween videos so much 😭
What temperature does chocolate burn at does anyone know?? And I like this recipe
Your english accent is SOOOOOO charming. We love your channel
Hello Jemma, I can't wait to see what you come up with for Halloween!!!!!
I love how you aren’t an ordinary chef. You’re just one of a kind.\n\nI love your channel
I love how these easy, at home recipes are always anything but.
Hi Jemma, thanks for sharing this recipe with us!
Heated fat that makes Gravy for mashed potatoes & pot roast night stuff that is salted with boiling salt flavor cubes made for beef products and not turkey or chicken ramen or nice chicken lunch meats for BS Sandwiches as well as peppered with Black Pepper that is grounded unless you are adventurous like me then whole crack black pepper corns should be nice to use the next time you decide to make pot roast or Pot Roast and whole crack black pepper corns are sometimes called Artichokes, BS Cream Sandwiches, Animal Crackers, and Whole Black Pepper Corns does have protein in it due to innate properties in the substance known as fat that does become human energy like food in starving people that makes a Zombie Nightmare Situation highly probably yet the Fat Digestion process works slow and makes a person lose their minds from Starving Hunger Insanity to certain extents and weak blood type people go insane quicker if they starve to use fat energy and they become Synthetic Humans who are safe to eat and cannibalism is frowned upon in my family and it is called a Family Sin and nothing else and none of you reading this have to abide my family rules it's just a Fun Fact that is from me and I'm not really Humpty Dumpty and eggs are fine by me and my family invented Easter with one of our ancestors who was a Saint of the Christian Order and they are overlooked by the Catholic Church who make Cholo Criminals that get by cops for talking strangely
Caramel are definitely one of the best thing to have ever existed!! Other than that, nougats! Can you teach us how to make them Jemma? Your recipes are all fantastic and I'd love to see one from you! xo
Omg I can't wait to try this
Is it just me, or is anyone else waiting for a halloween episode to come out? I hope she does one this year but no mention of it yet :( i just love themed bakes.
Yum! Can you show us some fudge recipes?
Could you please bring out another cook book with this and all your other great recipes in...Please
I’ve had a think about this before but this recipe confirms it, I genuinely want to marry you.
Get ready to hear a lot of deep, loud inhales.
Hi Jemma. Love your channel. I just want to know if it's possible to finish cooling this in the fridge?
what happens if u omit the golden syrup?? i think i've seen recipes that don't require it!!\n\nand i guess it wouldn't hurt to add the salt while the caramel is still hot?
I have been waiting dor another caramel recipe!!! Thank you
i subbed and i'm trying to get the best recipe that you have. I'm doing my  cooking assignment, i made up (getting ready for high school) thank you!!!!!!!
This shouldn't be trending at only 12 thousand views -_-
What is this «give it away» thing? Never heard of it, nor «share». Is this what the young hip kids are doing these days?
Would be amazing if u could do a vegan recipe with chocolate!💙
What spray oil to use Gemma
i wish you had a crumbs and doiles in los angeles i would love to taste some of your sweet treats
had to remove the sounds and go with the subtitles because the music is so overwhelming again, too bad - great video and recipe otherwise, looks yummy
i wonder if this could be considered chewy salted caramel chocolate 🤔
Jemma when’s your merch coming out ughhh I really want it ASAP bc it’s so nice xxx
Can you make fudge pleaseeeee! Love your videos
I feel like we should substitute dark chocolate (72%+) instead to cut the sweetness a bit.
Can I use compound
Can you make a upside down cake❤️
Droolin in the night cuz of thizz!! 😂😂😂
as soon as your started wrapping them I knew I wanted to make some for a gift!!!
This had me drooling all over my keyboard
Me:\nWhy am i so fat wtf?!\nAlso me:\nYes that will be 6 quid for those ingrediants!\nSmh.
Who was here before 100 likes
Looks delicious but my teeth hurt from just looking at it
USE CORN SYRUP INSTEAD OF GOLDEN! I didn't know golden syrup was LITERALLY no where else but England. So many confused people hahah. But there is a substitute. Do not use honey
What spray oil to use Gemma
Hi Jemma, I'm wondering what exactly is the golden syrup you used, under what other names might I find it? \nThanks and have a great day!
MashAllah
What can be used instead of golden syrup?
Golden syrup does not exist here in Portugal. how can I substitute the golden syrup?\nBtw, I love your work and you. Thank you for all the delicious recepies that you have been making for us  <3
Vegan pretty please?
These would make a great edition to the Christmas gift boxes I'm making this year :) I can't wait for your Christmas vids btw! Know you'll have some lovely things for me to make :) x
Jemma likes her chocolate sticky and Salty,   Aroused!
She doesn't look like she'd be a tattoo person.
double cream is the same as heavy cream right?
Why do u have those tats
Hello everyone, do me a favor and subscribe to Greg Hodel,  once you do it comment Done on his last video and I will susbcribe to you
Love that you use non-retard units! 😁 seriously, been loving your channel since the beginning
Does anyone know what the American equivalent of golden syrup is?
Never been so early
Hey Madam Gemma .From where I come from its very difficult to get your hands on  heavy cream. I was wondering if there would be a substitute to that . If there is please inform me. Thank you 💙
Hi Jemma, I am sure this will also be another big hit but I don’t think I have quite enough Golden Syrup. I wish I knew why this was such a difficult item to find here in the USA, the same with Clotted Cream. You would think it was a State Secret! The last time I was in Ireland, I just happened to bring 2 jars of it Home along with a couple packages of REAL SCONES! The scones made here are just biscuits, even the ones at the famous State Fair in Washington. I think they pass as a scone because most Americans haven’t had a true Irish Scone or even British scone for that matter! They don’t know what to look for in texture or taste. It is my goal to get a true Irish Scone into the hand of every person in the State of Washington, (I don’t want to be greedy and say the world, at least until the state is fulfilled then I will move forward from there) hehee. Must make realistic goals right, I mean look at you? You did it! Quite Impressive! I am awaiting an invite to visit to tour your facility and work with you and learn from you and your friends (employees) it would be great craic when and if I came home!
These chocolate caramels look delicious!  Quick question when they are completely cooled are they a soft or hard caramel? Also I  noticed the Cupcake Jemma towel at 2:09 behind you. Are you starting your own merchandise brand???
WHY IS THIS #7 ON TRENDING \n\nOH WAIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBECAUSE HE IS A LEDGENED
It's about time!
Love George Michael but this is not one of his better songs....r.i.p.
Coolest video ever! \nLoved every second!\nTotally George! \nThanks SOOOOOOO much GM Vevo! My heart is so happy!\nBRAVO! perfection❌⭕️💋
Love the classic vibe with modern dance sound
Died too soon he had so much more to give we lost an icon. Not many icons left in the world.
This is the best video I've ever seen. Period. Such energy!
this is on trending a dead man is on trending
I’ve only really started listening to George’s Music after I heard his death but I knew of his music because my mum was a big wham! Fan and I have become a big fan of this legend and his legacy will live on R.I.P George 😭 #Freedom #Withoutprejudice
December 25th 2016 will always be the day George Michael forgot to wake us up to tell us, in a single, careless whisper, that he had to go go. We'll remember him through his beautiful songs that made the '80s and still help us on our way from the living room to the bedroom so we never need one more try.\nGeorge, through many flawless December songs to come, have faith that we will never let the sun go down on you, whether you became a cowboy or an angel. Please heal our pain, as you go through the white light to become a star.
it does show on spotify that the song in that playlist is from an album by george michael, released october 20, 2017
You will always be in our hurts big bro lets get to 1k likes
Pretty much one of the greatest singer songwriters of my generation. Thank you for creating this, I know it truly must have been difficult after George’s passing. For those that haven’t watched it. Watch the latest movie of George Michaels life. It’s amazing. Full of pain and love
This video would have been great with just a medley of live performances throughout his career  :) He used to say himself that from time to time it's good to have one like that (Monkey, Everything She Wants).
Wait, this isn't the George Michael Bluth I was looking for...
And what is clear you just couldn't believe I really didn't want you anymore in my life.
I want George or Carrie or Bowie or Chester or Chris or Prince or at least SOMEONE to come back from the afterlife and be our Honey Mustard from Sausage Party who’d try and warn people why no one is coming to save them from impending WW3
Am I still in 2017?
amazing.\nGeorge is missing you.
I miss you George 😞
There's no other way out...even now...his energy is contagious and makes my life! Glory to George!
Love it,love you george Michael
OMG I LOVE remix ....made me cry like he was still alive making more music
rip George Michael
This is twangy tinny tosh!
YAAAAAAASSSSS
Just love it!
George Has Been,,and Always Will be My Favorite Artist, 35 years ago I was a kid hearing Wham U.K.! Fantastic. My life was happy knowing his music would always be there,.LOVE You George💞💝🌹❤

Beautyfull man George!!!!brings always joy to me ...R.I.P. my LOVE, you live in my heart
George will always be number one for me...I love his music, she is immortal♥
RIP legend
Have you heard of Rob Lombardi?! I think they made a clone. And I'm not kidding folks. And he actually did some fill-in work for George when George wouldn't do the promotion. They hired Rob Lombardi
I like this a lot, thanks Nile, I wanted to listen to more George after watching his film tonight on TV, he had his troubles but what an artist, one of the best voices the UK has ever produced,  you will be missed Rest In Peace George xx
I have just watched his film on TV, and feel very sad for us all we have lost a great talent far too soon, Rest In Peace George x
This is edited very well. But it's just to sad to think about the fact that George is gone. I'm only 21 and I don't think there will ever be another artist who can match what GM accomplished in the music industry. 💔
That Nile Rodgers always adds that bit extra,with his CHIC sound.....
It's like he's alive!
2:16 (from Spinning the Wheel) is so badass cool. He was so gorgeous. He just didn't see it.
I took a shit near his house
he will never be gone.in are hearts and minds forever. as he said this will never be repeated so for him is dream as come true. we love and truly miss  one special talented man. GM for history and future xx
Aww love it! Will love this man forever. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ 💋
Love it, miss you George rest easy up their in heaven
My mum said you died but your alive 😱😱😱😱😱😱
How was this made if he’s sadly not alive?....
Mais vivo que nunca!!! ❤️❤️
Nostalgic!!! There is only one George.  No one like him, now and forever.
I watching this 1mio in replay😍
So he came back to life
OMG This so cool I fan girl let get this to trending to 1
Some things are better left alone
144p video quality for full nostalgia effect.
I think he's stuck in the 90s
Someone tell me what did I just watched 😵😭☠️
i can't stop watching this i love this video 💓bless George x
Nile Rogers ruined what was already a great song!!!
Very average, a 'new' release should have been something special. This isn't.
This ls in a whole other level...I am feeling high!
How the fuck is this in trending?!?! XD?! Wait.... did he die on this day?!
Omg! this is absolutely amazing!!! I love it!
This blew me away - outstanding! Miss u George😘😢
I thought he was dead....
I miss you, George
George Micheal sings very well from beyond the grave
its amazing what a man he was
As a non George Michael fan I must say though this is superb.well done Niles.!
What happens when George Micheals finds out what YouTube stabiliser is
Haha so good!
Great :)
Hugely talented man, who is sorely missed
I ❤️ thissss

I like the story line! Hoping to see it in my country Philippines next year!
Omg!!! I'm so excited it will be available internationally!! I'm from the US and I finally got On the Other Side while I was visiting England!!! I refused to leave the country without it!
OH MY GOD YES YES YES! I am an American Carrie lover/theatre nerd and this is the book I can finally get?! This is the greatest news ever my heart is overflowing.
IM SUCH A SUCKER FOR A ROMANCE GHOST STORY SET IN THE THEATER. ITS LIKE MOST OF MY MIDDLE SCHOOL SHOWS
Sounds reminiscent of phantom (but like, i haven't actually seen phantom so idk what im talking about)
So glad that they are offering the book in America... not that the absence of this has stopped me from acquiring her books in the past. I love how Amazon provides when publishers are slacking. Congratulations on the wider distribution, Carrie!
AHHH IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS CARRIE!!!!!  I've been waiting for a book about the west end for so long now
Can I just like have it now please
Not going to lie, I paid for international shipping and got your first two books from Bloomsbury even though I live in the US! So worth it!
THE IDEA OF THE SPLIT TIMELINES REMINDS ME A LITTLE LIKE THE DROWNING OF ARTHUR BRAXTON! :O VERY EXCITED TO READ IT!!
I AM TOO EXCITED. I NEED TO CALM. BUT I CANT. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIM CRAZIER THAN YOUUUUU
Any lesbian characters I will be able to relate to??
I can't think of anything to say except... wow and soooooooooooo excited!!! Fab news Carrie x
I'm so so ready!!!
I. Am. So. READY!\n\nAnd so relieved that you're not leaving the theatre 😂
Make money on your own time ! \nhttp://5kformula.com/sq/Sippel5k/
My hear stopped because I thought you where going to stop youtube. So I'm REALLY excited for your book!
This has a sort of The Night Circus vibe about it!!!!
I am so amazed how you can have a full-time job and write a book alongside it, you must have some sort of will-power
Yay! This sounds so exciting and can’t wait to finally be able to read one of your books!
When you were reading the blurb, I got the vibe of Phantom meets Moulin Rouge. So the addition is definitely accurate! :D
It comes out on my birthday!!! And its about musical theatre which is like the best thing ever so I'm happy!
I'M SO EXCITED!!! I CAN FINALLY GET ONE OF YOUR BOOKS!!!! AHHHHHHH!!!!!!
How are you so cute gah I love it! Can't wait to get the book!
Yay! Congratulations, Carrie!! I’m so excited to read it!
Oh wait... does this mean a US book tour? ;)
Can we preorder in the US? I'm so excited this one's going international! Congrats, Carrie! I can't wait to read it! ☺️
YESSSS the all the times Carrie and Scott have talked about ghosts in the theater is being brought to life!!!
I'm so excited!!! This sounds like such a good book, and of course a perfect book for you to write!!!
CARRIE YOUR BOOK SOUNDS AMAZING I CAN NOT WAiT 😍😍
Can it be July right now please? 😍
So excited for you cnt wait to read it! Hope u do a signing in Leeds one day!😊❤️
how fitting would it be if this became a theatre show
Oh Carrie I swear I have never been so excited about a book. I am a theater actress too, and during all my life I think I have read just one book with this theme. And to know I will be able read your book. This is amazing!!!
Ugh I CAN'T WAIT and so glad it's being released in the US!!!!
Was this book perhaps inspired by yours and Scott's ghost hunting adventures in an older vlog???
You honestly never stop working, this is amazing! Go girl ❤️🔥
Will there be an audible book of this as well? Cause' recently I haven't had time to sit down and read, so audible books are so much easier for me. :S
I was gonna comment that it sounds like a blend of Moulin Rouge and Phantom of the Opera and then she actually said it!
So excited to read It!! Even better as it comes out on my birthday!!!!! Eek
I love you so much! I saw you at the Manchester Central Reference Library book signing for All That She Can See 🌹 you won't remember but I told you that you inspired me to play the ukulele! That signed book is my prized possession. Thank you so much.
I’m sure YA readers will love it.
Carrie, if you haven't already, please listen to the musical Curtains because I think you would love it, it's a show within a show and a musical whodunnit and it sounds right up your street
the Southern Cross is an Aussie constellation so I automatically love it!
I can't wait. It sounds great!
This was uploaded on my birthday
I am so excited, I burped writing this! Can‘t wait!!!!
Sounds like the ghost bit might've been inspired by Scarrie? 😉 I'M SUPER EXCitED FOr ThE NeW BOOK
last year i was in a show that our director wrote that was called when the curtain falls !!  it was about a young brother and sister who stumbled across an abandoned theatre and characters from previous musicals came to life. it was about their journey and all the characters they met. \nthe story perfectly intertwined songs from musicals; i remember part of the story where the little girl was separated from her brother, so she sang 'On My Own' from Le Miserables, and then she met Ursula from The Little Mermaid and the witch stole her voice with the song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls', and then the girl was the puppet in the ventriloquist act from Chicago in 'They Both Reached for the Gun' because she couldn't talk, and she finally met Maria and the children from The Sound Of Music who taught her how to talk again with 'Do Re Me'. she was reunited with her brother after singing 'Home' from Beauty and the Beast. we finished the show singing 'Do You Here the People Sing' from Les Miserables because we (as the forgotten about characters) had been rediscovered and were loved once again, and we were dressed as the characters from the shows. it was such a good story line, and so great to perform because there were so many different musical numbers. \n\nmaybe this could inspire your new book carrie !! it even has the same name, after all. Congratulations !! x
MY THEATRE LOVING HEART IS SO FULL! MY BODY IS READY! I AM BEYOND EXCITED FOR THIS BOOK!!! (Can you tell by the all caps)
The book isn't out yet but I'm ready it's musical to hit the theatres 🎭
So exciting for me in the US who loves all the things you just described! Congrats!!
Yay a link for us in Australia!! Thank you Carrie, this made my day!!! \nAs a pit musician this sounds right up my alley xx
I'M SO EXCITED IT'LL BE AVAILABLE IN THE US. THAT MAKES ME SO HAPPY. YAAAAASSSSS.
Carrie, how wonderfully exciting! This book sounds like it's going to have so much heart. Also please keep releasing books in July, so far they've always been released near my birthday so they're birthday presents! 💛
OH MY GODDD!!! I'm so excited and so ready to fall in love with this book!!! AHH☺️🎉

Yay! Finally an international distribution!! Moulin rogue and The Phantom of the opera are two of my favourite musical, so I can't wait to read this book!!\nI wish you the best of luck, but I'm sure you won't need it 😉
So it's like a romantic supernatural thriller? Sounds good!
OMG it’s out two days after my 21st birthday!!! What an amazing prezzie to myself ❤️❤️❤️

THIS IS SO EXCITING!!!!!! I can't imagine a better book to come out of your mind - it's PERFECT!!! xxxxxx
I’m so excited, and I’m also called Olive!!!
I'm only scared about the names you've chosen because when you and Oliver Ormson fall out, you'll always have his name in your head when you read these character names
Olive... Green?
Carrie must get so annoyed at all these comments about Oliver 🙄🙄🙄
Are the characters in any way related to Oliver? 😌
I have a book recommendation for you! It's probably the most amazing book I have read this year, apart from On The Other Side of course. It's called 'The Night Circus' and it was written by Erin Morgenstern. It is truly amazing and each of the characters are gorgeous and profound. Here's the blurb and I hope that one day you can find and enjoy this book as I have.\nIn 1886 a mysterious travelling circus becomes an international sensation. Open only at night, constructed entirely in black and white, the Cirque des Rêves delights all who wander its circular paths and warm themselves at its bonfire. There are contortionists, performing cats, carousels and illusionists - all the trappings of an ordinary circus. But this is no conventional spectacle. Some tents contain clouds, some ice. The circus seems almost to cast a spell over its aficionados, who call themselves the rêveurs - the dreamers. And who is the sinister man in the grey suit who watches over it all? Behind the scenes a dangerous game is being played out by two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who, at the behest of their masters, are forced to test the very limits of the imagination - and of love. A feast for the senses, a fin-de-siècle fantasia of magic and mischief, and the most original love story since The Time Traveler's Wife, The Night Circus is an extraordinary blend of fantasy and reality. It will dazzle readers young and old with its virtuoso performance, and who knows, they might not want to leave the world it creates.
Are Oscar and Olive a gay couple??? A gay couple and ghosts??? I need this book right now!
Love this video I also love wandering spiders probably my favourite true spider ☺☺👍👍
I'm always worried that something will sneak onto his hat
I am terrified of spider I felt something crawling up my back
Coyote your channel is the best animal channel I,ve ever watch
Is this a nightmare episode?
the wondering spider  has more pain than bullet ant?
Why isn't did a tv show yet?
11:43 LITTLE BUG JUST CHILLING ON HIS LEFT ARMPIT I WOULD'VE BE GOOOONE BOY.
'Finds full grown bear ': its a little small we need something bigger
This guy got some big pair of balls to not be afraid of none of these animals i no i would be hella scared if i saw a damn snake
I certainly respect all arachnids but I sure don't love them unless they're eating mosquitoes. LOL I'm DEFINITELY having nightmares tonight! Talking about them in houses, boots, sheets... I don't live anywhere NEAR Costa Rica/Central/South America and I'm freaked out!
ummm... were do they live cause i dont want it in my state
The Brazilian Wandering Spider was the creature I feared the most while in the jungles of Guyana in 2011. The host of this video didn’t mention one of the worst symptoms of a bite: a priapism. This can obviously only happen to males and is horrendous.
Let’s go back to the research hut full of spiders with another spider....
Are they in seattle?
Hey coyote been watching awhile and think you deserve more than you get
THE SPOODER MAN IS HERE!
They need a show on tv
This is a hard video to watch
Its actually called the red thigh wandering spider, watch monster bug wars for proof
Coyote:don't touch that.\nMe:but I wont to
Coyote:    I bet your all shaking thinking, how am i handling this thing.\nMe:     Nope.
MY LIFE IS ON THE LINE
This is the first insect I've seen him not touch lol. Know your limits man😂😂
When the music starts,it means that coyote saw something.Am i right???
i thought the leaf was the spider
When I see bugs they make me feel like bugs are on me
This video makes my skin crawl or wander
I’m one of those people who are like you are craaaaaaaaaaaazy I hate spiders they are so creepy
I would be scared to go out into the woods at night but this guy is going out catching snakes and spiders at night.And at the end isn't he sitting at the cabin that has like a bunch of other big spiders.
It's also very fast
It would be cool if you had a ruler on the outsode of the glass or maybe a common object like a lego or what ever glued inside for comparison
Is this the species that causes a priapism in men?
THAT'S IT. CUT IT ALL DOWN
I'm not thinking about how could you hold it. I am planing the way to get out of this wold right now. My skin feels ichy right now my heart wanna stop beating.😭
I'm just gonna go huddle in the corner in fetal position and die instantly...
Why do I still watch this even though I have arachnophobia
Kind of like pokemon\nGOT IT
When he found it I would’ve already been on a plane out of there
Coyote:don't touch the spider\n\nMe:WHY I WANT TO IT LOOKS SO COOL AND ID LIKE TO HOLD THE SNAKE TOO 🕷 🐍 \n ME AGAIN: Little brother where are you look at the spider but don't touch it\n\nMy Brother:WHY I WANT TO\n\nME:I DO TO
Wait.... this thing jumps? Oh HELL NO.
coyote lives up to his youtube channel name
That was pretty nerve-rachnid get arachnid
So, if that was a C. coccineus (red legged 'nana spider- could totally be, can't tell from the vid), all accounts I know of don't regard it as dangerous to humans. The keepers I have spoken to say that they're quite amicable and essentially non-aggressive, and their toxicity is quite tame compared to that of their cousins. I've read that it's comparable to a bee sting, but don't know anybody first-hand that's been nipped (which is fine with me).\n\nGlad to see you were careful with it anyway. Speedy little hairballs, ain't they? :) \n\nFor a minute there your clickbait title had me wondering if you actually found yourselves a Phoneutria somethingorother. THAT would have been a land mine for all to see. Just...take every precaution and then about 15 more if you do find a P. they are a force to be reckoned with...\n\nCheers Coyote n' crew! Be safe out there.
Is the flashlight you use a SOG Dark Energy?
Damn his subscribers really shot up quickly no surprise
Me And My Friend Want To Be Like You We Have Been Looking For Things Outside Our School Were Both 9 \n\nOur Finds So Far: Small Very Venomous Goldy Brown Colored Spider. King Ant. More
This dude has got more balls then Dick’s sporting goods!
Can you do a video related to the bloodworm I also wonder why it didn't bite
B I O L O G I C A L    L A N D M I N E S
Yep I could see it but I have an eagle eye so yeah
Get bitten by it!!
Why dont you just SMASH THAT LITTLE DEVIL SPIDER
7:09 scared the crap out of me.
Anyone else get a feeling that a spider is crawling near you when a spider is shown?
only animals i respect only the ones i can pet 🤷‍♂️
I’ll just stay here in Colorado where the worst thing we have here is brown recluses or black widows
can you find the Indian Typan
Wait till you see the bark scorpions in 2281
i hate these videos but i watch them cause im curious i will never know why i keep watching these things
Coyote uses a SOG dark energy flash light, is this one worth the money it costs?
I'd love If you could do a Video about the Peacock Spider <3
why did't you catch the tokay gecko i here one
i will die before i go there at night
I am hiding in the comments
Hell naw
coyote falls into spike [ awwwwww!?!!!!!!            Mark( you Kay?
bad
11:43 roach on his shirt?
Ummmm I was eating chocola- **throws up**
Coyote: woah woah watch out (snake) \nMe: SCREAM (flips out runs into a tree
UGH IM SO ITCHY
I hate spiders
Brazillian wandering Spider
Welp,\n\n\n\n\nNow I am terrified of spiders...

Wich is more dangerous? This spider or the black widow?
Was anyone one else watching this in there bed and shaking? I know I was
U said “ now lets put this scorpion away and look for the wandering spider!” WRONG
If it turned out that Dan and Louise were related I would not be surprised
If someone had an alien pregnancy Umm DIL HOWLTER?
This video is a bit weird but I like how mature they were about it.
hhh louise is so pretty and brilliant i lov her so much.....
This video was a blessing
That child is gonna be so lucky to get to see dan and Phil when she's older 😂❤️
Some of this actually helped me revise for an exam
i'm glad i'm not  a woman
My aesthetic is dan avoiding saying vagina and saying babe 😍💦
awwh the fact she wanted to call the baby boy daniel is just so houlsome, I can't.
dan and phil are so giant compared to louise it intimidates me
Literally could not stop staring at Phil throughout the video
Dan just got hotter again and idk how to feel
I bet Micheal Phelps’ mom had a water birth.
Who else wanted a child and now doesn’t wanna be apart of that shit
yAY NOW LETS GET DAN AND PHIL PREGNANT-
THIS VIDEO MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD
I had an episiotomy when I had my daughter & I didn't realize he had cut me until I asked my obgyn & his response was I cut you so you wouldn't have a vaganus. 😂😂😂
I learned more from this video about pregnancy and birth than I ever have before....
It makes me happy how much they know about this stuff and that neither of them are afraid to talk about it. They are such wonderful friends and i hope that your pregnancy goes well!
Figureing out what gooch is slang for is kind of weird because that is my grandparents last name. Poor them
It's when you have twins, and they both come out.\nJESUS CHRIST THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN.\nI can't stop laughing omg
WAIT\n\n*Puts towel down*\n\nOkay, now you can like this comment.
I love that they just ran with the whole underwater baby thing and your just like um...no. lol :) :) :)
I'm 6 months pregnant too this makes me happy (:
SINCE WHEN IS LOUISE PREGNANT
wow louise is LITERALLY glowing i am so happy for her
I am a adult female with friends who have babies and had no idea what most of these were :/
IS THE BABIES NAME DANIELLE BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE THAT IF SHES HAVING ANOTHER KID PHIL WOULD BE ON HER LIST AND NOT DAN
Your baby is going to be 3 months older than my moms! Baby besties💕😂
I started crying when Dan brought out his elbows to do the perineal massage omfg
Perks of being a medical student
When you have tokophobia but still watch because you're a supportive fan.
i want to promote their happiness tho OHMYGODD <3 <3 <3\nsame. :3
OMG I THOUGHT DAN WAS SAYING MY NAME AND I LOOKED UP AND I WAS SO CONFUSED
When phil said alien pregnancy i thought of dil and dalien
“Dan knows a lot about placentas”\n“Why... does he?” 😂
I feel like phil knows all the pregnancy terminology😂 (Need the knowledge for when Dan gets pregnant! TIME FOR PHANFIC!)
my older sister had two kids (not at once) so she has two beautiful baby girls about 5 or 6 six years apart
Fun fact: cows and humans have the same gestation period
*Louise*: I feel like you two would be great dads. *Me, internally*: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The boys need to be watching B99, the have an episode with a Doula. Come on guys
Dan and Phil look like giants next to louise lol
I gave birth to a baby 6 months ago and I don’t even know half of these
wAIT DID PHIL PREDICT LOUISE'S pREGNANCY OR WOT
I'd throw Louise in a pool. *waterbirth*
Get rid of these silly ass people with no inspiration and talent.
IMAGINE DAN AND PHIL AS FATHERS
THIS VIDEO IS SO WHOLESOME
So my sister is a midwife well a sister so she's the head midwife and I was around 14 when she started training so this makes me laugh as I would sit there reading her cards and stuff 😂😂
Louise: placenta \n*ghost of you starts playing aggressively*
OMG \nBIRTH CHALLENGE\nWHOEVER CAN BE ON THAT BIRTH SIMULATOR MACHINE LONGEST WINS\nPLEASE LIKE SO SHE'S SEE THIS\n\nPLEASE TELL DAN AND PHIL
I spit out my tea when Phil said he would put a towel down.\n😂😂
I nearly pissed myself watching this OMG what a great gift for this Friday after such a long hard week.
Your hair though! It’s bomb. 👌🏾
LOUISE YOU ARE LITERALLY GLOWING AND SO BEAUTIFUL OMG
this whole video made me crimge
Honestly thank you for this video because American public school never taught me anything about pregnancy, they just preach abstinence. Like... I'll probably eventually have a kid and I should know this.
What about a baby danella?!
Died a little bit when Dan said babe and Phil looked at Dan\n\n\n*the phanning intensifyis*\n\n\nIm just joking btw, could be a coincidence and shit.
I didn't know most of these terms lol
When they talked about the episiotomy I was cringing so hard. Sounds SO painful
if you've ever watched the entire series of Gilmore Girls (or the season where Luke's sister has a baby) you know what a Doula is
okay but I didn’t know episiotomy was a thing and that has me freaked out
this is why im adopting
This makes me want children even less...
i love how maturely they can all talk about it. i mean like, most youtubers would have click bait, then laugh at every time they said something about the vagina.
I probably shouldn't be eating while watching them talk about placentas. Just a thought
Who else remembers THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHEN “PLACENTA”  WAS A THING😂😂👏
This baby doesn’t even know how lucky they are right now.
I nEEDED thiS\n*I CAn diE hAPPY NoW*\n\n\n\ngod bless
Yes now prank them when its near your due date and pretend to go into labor to test them :')
Dan- Give you a little massage.\nPhil- Where?\nMe- Ummmmm.....
Louise is so beautiful and chill and dan and phil are such good friends and I'm just so grateful to have a window into their friendship
i’m in a rental car and the guy probably thinks i’m crazy because i’m laughing so much
I love Louise's hair
Is it just me or are Phil's eyes particularly resplendent in this video?
....
im never getting fucking pregnant
Uncle Danny
Daniela.
I'm is pregnat
“Dan knows all about placenta”
Placenta
dAN SAYING ¨babeIM BLESSED
DAN SAYING BABE IS EVERYTHING
Dan knows all about placenta lol\nPhiL JFC
Louise: Colostrum\n\nDan: That means butt.

It was a bit of wind and rain nothing extreme just like a bad day
There was a hurricane in ireland
Like for a years supply of PointlessBlog merch!!
HIIIIIIIIII
LBW SQUAD!?
You kidding me?...Islam isn't a race...why did she need facial alterations?...honestly, this is embarrassing
FUCK OFF WITH YOUR ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PIECE BULLSHIT.
Can't wait for the sequels; my week as a woman, my week as a jew and everyones favourite my week as a black man.
Up next: My week as a gay white male in Iran
Keep stirring the pot Channel 4 👍
Fuck off
You should do a show called  My week as a gay person in a Muslim country However it will probably end in death.
Why I don't hate Muslims themselves, Islam as a religion is disgusting. It is a horrific, barbaric religion of a bygone age that would belong more in the 11th century than the 21st century. If Muslims had minds of their own they would realise that they are involved in an oppressive, pointless regime.
What about the thousands upon thousands of young girls raped and groomed for being non muslims and white all across the country each year? What about the hundreds of acid attacks? The thousands of Female genital Mutilation or the honor killings? The extremism and terrorism? What about the over 100,000 estimated islamofascists in this country and the over 52,000 jihadists potential terrorists? Not to mention the majority of british muslims when polled think homosexuality should be a criminal offence and support sharia law which is theocratic fascism. It's so disgusting we are normalising theocratic fascism and the subjugation and oppression of women under Islam
This is in very poor taste and has an obvious agenda. Come on channel four, you’re meant to be one of the good guys.
Channel 4 can fuck off with this Political correctness, liberal lefty bullshit..
they darkened her skin and gave her a bigger nose so she could look more muslim am i the only one disgusted by this rn??? there are so many white muslims this is literally so fucking unnecessary fuck you @ channel 4
Hahahahaha just no.
Fuck channel 4
Hey let's all masturbate a pig over a Koran to celebrate being a Muslim, it's a lies in the Koran any way, Mohammed was  schizophrenic , and a slave trading pedophile, and a war monger too
How the fuck is this trending at 49 with only 495 views youtube I doing dodgy stuff definitely
Channel 4 and specifically channel 4 news has lost a serious amount of credibility in the past few years, the coverage of Trump and constant race baiting will be the death of them
My week as a terr....muslim
You missed the part where she was executed for apostasy at the end.
look at this : \nSheeva V\n3 days ago\nWhy not do a programme called my week as a Brit living as a minority in my own country and see the shit they have to put up with hmmm? the west needs to know how to be a person like everyone in this world.
Sadly people have been greatly mislead about Islam. I hope people do not judge others by their prejudice. For the sake of humanity I ask all people to have patience & research the facts; we expect this for ourselves in our own courts of law.
A fake  prosthetic nose and tan to  look muslim. WTF
My life as a Christian in Syria there you go
You could just visit muslims and talk to them about their experiences and opinions, we don't need this extra bullshit.
Ban all Muslims entering the UK.
Did she have her clit removed as well?  I hear that's a thing for some of them. 0_o
Vermin scum taking over. invading and breeding on our country. Fuck right off! Paedophile worshipping terrorists
This is the most racist shit I have seen on recent TV, channel 4 I've really outdone yourself you clowns
Why doesn’t she walk in their shoes in the Middle East? Or does she not want to be subjected to being treated worse than a camel? Typical channel 4 pro-Islamic propaganda defining British white’s as racists or xenophobic or Islamophobic as per usual. \nIf you want to be part of a religion which thinks that women are inferior, dogs and pigs are dirty animals, Jews and Christians must pay extra taxes in an Islamic caliphate because of their religion and brutally slaughtered (which is sectarianism at its finest) gays and people who have sex out of marriage are thrown off rooftops and children and women can be temporarily married to a Muslim man for him to fuck then you are not a human being. You belong in the dark ages. Islam is cancer.
Honestly I think this will be more educational for SOME people than actual Muslims just talking about their experiences. For some reason that shouldn't be there i feel that this strategy may manage to stir more feelings to the surface
Maybe we should start enforcing our own laws, the government is taking the absolute piss put of us.
Well done Channel 4, yet another documentary to try and make us feel sorry for Muslims, and make us believe we're the problem for all of the problems. Such a tolerant religion, with the children getting taught to stay away from us because we aren't Muslims, and they're a disgrace if they don't have a fistful of beard. And don't get me started on wife beating, and child abuse. \nIf they want to live somewhere that's tolerant towards them, they can go back to a islamic country! \nWe wouldn't have any terror attacks then, although I suppose they're all part and parcel of living in a big city even though the Finsbury mosque attack was unacceptable. GET THEM OUT!!
Next time can you go to the middle east so you can have a real feeling of it.
in 2017 how many muslims believe muhammed flew on a donkey and he split the moon into quarters? Those that answer yes need urgent mental health check ups.
I'll still proud stand as islamophobic! and I was born in Indonesia.
trying to portray muslims as the victim then a terrorist attack happens during filming.\ngo walk around pakistan as a christian.. you wont be ashamed to live here
Try walking around as a white Christian or as a white anything for that matter in Pakistan.....See how long you last!
Make Britain Great Again. Britain was a great and hardworking country back in the day. Now, the media sympathises with the most useless group of minorities who live in Britain as if it was Pakistan.
Ahh yeah never mind the deaths of innocent people in Manchester, due to Islamic terrorism, immigrant muslims are the victims here... what a fucking joke.
LOL , I love the hateful comments here. It's interesting to see how low class people meant not to ever learn to write or read. Get them back in the farms. :)
I thought Muslims can be white, so why did they paint her face brown?  Channel 4 own goal?
Tell ya what. Do a documentary on a 20 year old Woman disguised as a 17 year old Woman walking through Bradford.  You will get the same outcome and were in our country ffs.
the comments under here are vile.
Ugghh this show is so stupid
Channel 4 leftist bullshite false news. Bet there's nothing about tax avoiding, child grooming, or planning mass murder
I’m starting to believe we fought the wrong side in WW2.
All these people forgetting about the KKK after saying *all Muslims are terrorists.*
She looks like a witch
What does the guy shout at 0:33 ?
Why did they brown face her????
These people are fucking racist as fuck. Especially the woman doing it.\n'You expect them to blow something up'\n''Doesn't even look like England'\nFuckin sweaty ball bag
All over you tube are videos of Muslims   abusing people  in  what they view as their areas. These people  getting abuse and threats could be: Polish , British, ,or anyone  being  seen drinking,  seen as gay,  or provocatively dressed (usually women). Or maybe just a few young kids out to enjoy the evening   Comparatively Muslims  get away with far more  abuse and  actual racial attacks than any other bigot  you could think of. But these facts of course will never be seen as  the makings of  TV programme  because it would offset  the narrative that likes  to portray  Muslims as  a religion of peace. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/_SK7To4gSr0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ra45nX9JmW4\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SukEnAQ_ebE\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lkCTGiyrD0k
What a load of bullshit why does she have to be wear the bin bag to be Muslim. It’s choice to wear it. Plus most Muslims just wear it to be different or to stand out from white people. Silly cunts
Why don't they just get actual Muslims...? Fuckin hell- always have to get a white person to be the victim, in this case dressing them up with brownface! Stupid.
kate your sick. this actually brought tears to my eyes. why can’t people just accept the fact that not everyone is white or christian. not everyone in england is english?
Could anyone tell me what the name of the song is at 0:15? I've been trying to find that song for weeks. Thanks.
My week in Brixton dressed as a grand wizard.
Next, My Week as an underage white girl who got raped by Muslim rape gang and the police never did anything about it and allowed them to continue doing it....No? Oh yeah I forgot Channel 4 are a bunch of leftist Muslim apologist fags
I love how they make her a pakistan muslim not just a white muslim.
WERE NOT TERRRORISTS FGS
Wow, sorry I scrolled down. jeez.
please make my week as a child who got their legs blown off in birmingham
Why does everyone think Muslim=Pakistani. We are not pakis for fuck sakes. A Muslim can be black, white, Chinese etc
Channel 4 ... yeah, I'm gonna stay away from that obvious trap.
Islam has got nothing to do with Islam.
Did they put a big nose prosthetic on her to make her look more Pakistani? 😂
Wait hang on? They made her face brown? Why?
AND at 10 hate white people its not racist its away of life 2017
What about my week as a Coptic Christian in Egypt. Maybe, my week as a working class white girl in Rotherham.  Or, how about my week as an apostate in Somalia. Fuck off channel four and your leftist puke.
Na a think all give that crap a miss thank you very much 😉😊
Fuck all Muslims, and fuck the media for always trying to portray them as the victims.
England is a Christian country, fuck off with this PC bullshit
I would love to know why they thought they needed to brown her up and give her a comedy nose. I'm white, English, atheist (from a christian family)  and get these comments every day of my life. In the the last 5 years i have had these knuckle dragging benefit scroungers tell me to fuck off home you paki bastard about 50 times, i've been called a terrorist on the train, a dirty immigrant in the bank, a muslim pedo, had the boooom bombing noise shouted at me, had retards going to the gym say i've got a bomb in my rucksack, you name it i've heard it or been called it. In pubs i've had people say i didn't think paki's drink, in the street i've had people say it's like pakistan round here, a few months ago i passed a group of young (no doubt burger-flipping until they're 70) sluts going whoring on Ecclesall Road, Sheffield and one said to her friend he might throw rocks at me. Not quite sure what part of my white face, rock band hoodie, jeans and converse made me look muslim, but the english are that uneducated these days you get used to it. They probably think Bin Laden played bass guitar for Metallica on his days off from musliming. A lot of these incidents happen in the evening, clearly the vast majority of this country's wonderfully educated citizens can't quite grasp the concept that things (including people!) look darker....when it's dark! Durrrrrr! \n\nThe english are obsessed, they think everybody is an immigrant and a muslim. Most English people these days would think Ozzy Osbourne is a muslim. My great grandfather died in WW2 fighting the Nazi's and to be honest if i could go back in time, i'd say don't bother let Hitler flatten the shithole. I call England a 5th world country and it's entirely because of the natives, otherwise known as brain-dead benefit-scrounging neanderthals. I would love to fuck off back home, but unfortunately i was born in this cesspit and until i semi-retire (hopefully in about 5 years, thanks to my degree in engineering), i'm stuck with all you cavemen and cavewomen. I can't wait to take my money elsewhere and not have to pay for all the working (that's a laugh!) class whores to push out babies to score a council house.
Fuck off
This is disgusting
Good
Why does one have to dress up to be a Muslim makes no bloody sense
People are so ignorant
Fuck. right. Off.
Oh fuck off channel 4
Bruh
The fuck...
Fucking idiots
Damn.. those white guys are fucking racist
Channel Flaw.
Islam is manufactured bullshit
0:00 \nTrue\nClicks off video
My week as a Muslim, then a terrorist attack happens... Coincidence I think not, great planning channel 4 👻
Scum bags. Get the Muslims and Islam out out if England.
come on channel 4...  send a group of teenage white girl's through a muslim area anywhere in britain and broadcast that on tv ( maybe live )
This is propaganda at its finest. White ppl can be muslim too. This world is disgusting, they want to promote hatred between ppl and make ppl appear different from each other. Last time i checked we were all human. Don't buy into it guys cause the minute you do that's when it will be easy for them to impose their evil laws on you and wars will happen even more. This program is utter trash cause the real victims are all of us. Those who cause attacks to create fear in us so that we will accept their war on terror facade are the real enemies. Never forget this guys.
Channel 4 going full cuck mode again. Eat shit along with the bbc 🖕🏻
FUCK ALL OF U HATING ON MUSLIMS FOR NO REASON \nPISS OFF UR GONNA GET NOWHERE \nA WHITE PERSON KILLS- HAS AN ILLNESS \nBROWN PERSON KILLS-AUTOMATICALLY MUSLIM AND A TERRORIST \nU RACISTS NEED TO GET AN ACTUAL GRIP OF URSELVES
Probably all the people that voted leave are the ones being racist silly fucking northen twats
As a Muslim, I find this appalling. Channel 4 are trying to tell people that all Muslims are, are people who look Middle Eastern or Pakistani; Muslim women are just people who wear a hijab. Disgusting.
Fucking white scumbags always gotta mock other races first it was black face now it's brown face. Stupid cunts.. Muslims are victims of terrorism in the Middle East and with the U.S fucking white cunts sending fucking drones and killing innocent people. Lmao non Muslims think their the most victims fuck outta here stupid fucking pagan dickheads.. Non Muslims commit the most terror in the Middle East and in Africa!
Throw bacon at them
Don't look . These Comments are full of racist cancerous bigots. I warned you.
Dont scroll down, full of ignorant people who think they know Islam but dont.
clicked on this video not thinking I'd watch all of it but I just realised I finished the whole documentary and all I can say say is Demi I am so inspired by you
PEOPLE NEED TO STOP SLEEPING ON DEMI OK
This is so inspirational thank you for sharing your Story ❤️
Her journey is incredible. Really loving her music for past years and had no idea ,things of this intensity was happening behind. she's amazingly Strong! I'm personally going thru some things all at same time now. This documentary sparks me a remainder to not giveup on my life!
I used to look up to her so much before I watched this but now how can I not holy shit she's my inspiration
Demi... you are kinda amazing. I hope you know it.\nThanks for sharing your story. And never, never stop things you are doing right now :)
A picture where a strong girl was also bullied. We ourselves has limitations to something we could cope up. I experience were my family was also saying Im all just a bunch of drama 😊 So I started to have eating disorders, but I saw that I am not proving anything, I'm  just making myself worse, so like Demi, I worked myself out and achieve something. But I am still in the process in making myself better.
I'm so glad I grew up to see Demi grow to be such and amazing woman and just so inspirational. FUCJ LOVE YOU DEMI.
anyone else completely S.H.O.O.K about what she was going through during Disney? Had no idea
i genuinely appreciate her so much more as a person. everyone has there demons it's just about overcoming them & believing in yourself. she proves in this documentary she's just like everyone else. she's not putting on a fake Hollywood front anymore.
So inspiring and emotional, the best 1:18:11 documentary of my life❤️😍
Demi locator will always be one of my role models and I love her so much.
She's simply the best and I love her beyond complications.
Stone cold is a song that still makes me cry so much. It’s a song that helped me all 2016. I had a horrible breakup with the guy I spent 6 years with. We now found our way back to each other. Thank you Demi for everything you have done in my life. I am one of many you’ve helped. ♥️♥️
I love this so so much omg😍💗 such a strong soul. It’s funny how I watched her on Disney never even realising she was going through all this. I want every artist to do documentaries like this to make us realise their real people...
I didn’t think I could admire and love someone so much more than I already did 💕
She is just amaizing!!I’m proud to call mysefl her fan❤️
I have so many things to say about this. First of all, I have always been a fan of Demi since Disney and her other work. Ever since I have had my account here, Demi has been my profile picture as well.\n\nNothing that she did in the past, or anything she will do in the future, will make her not talented. Her voice just blows me away. I saw her in concert once and it was one of the best days of my life. She is extremely talented.\n\nI had mixed feelings while watching this. I didn’t like that the girl at her school got her involved in drugs. There’s no excuse to do them. It’s such a shame such a talented and beautiful young woman such as herself got into something like that. What I didn’t like the most about it, is how she continued to do it after rehab. I feel like she lied to us, her fans. Until watching this, I had no idea that she had not been sober since she was released from rehab a few years back. I don’t remember noticing anything that was off. It makes me want to watch her Stay Strong Documentary again and see if I happen to notice anything different. I honestly hope that she is real and sincere this time and isn’t doing any more drugs.\n\nI also want to say that I absolutely adored her and Wilmer together. I can tell that she absolutely still loves him and a part of her heart still wants him. I hope they will get back together. Even though she said she is interested in dating men and women. And I didn’t really mind the casual sex comment, I just hope she’s being safe. Which I am sure she is.\n\nI just wanted to cry when she was explaining the petition that the evil girls at her school said. I wonder what those girls are doing today. I wonder if they see the success she has now. I think they were just jealous that she was on Barney. It makes me so sad to hear the cruel things they said to her, and I am sad to hear that she still of course struggles with her eating disorder. It really made me sad when she said one of the first things she did after her and Wilmer broke up was purge. \n\nI wish her the best of luck in her future. As long as she stays clean and keeps doing what she’s doing. I will continue to adore her and listen to her music and support her. No matter who she ends up with, she deserves happiness. I love you Demi Lovato.
I don't usually watch documentaries, but when I do, it's *Demi Lovato's* and it's fcking perfect.
Words can't describe how much I admire her. Such an inspiration
So proud of you. You really love him girl.. Your eyes says every thing. Your music is always with me through my teen to my mature adult.  Love you.  This documentary describe you more beautiful person you are.
I'm proud of you Demi 💘❤
Surprised she didn’t speak about her suicide attempt
This was absolutely BEAUTIFUL. Thanks so much for sharing Demi. You are an inspiration to millions❤️❤️
Draft weather punishment mom resort professor minor capacity about.
Demi is a real inspiration. She has shown us that, no matter what you go through in life you can overcome anything and everything and come out on top. You have truly changed my outlook on life. You are my role model, and I will always be a supportive fan no matter what. Have been since day 1:) I hope to be as great as you one day
Demi is seriously such a goddess! You are so empowering and lovable! I couldn’t imagine my life without your music. You’ve saved me in so many ways that I can’t even explain how grateful I am for you and your music. I love you so much Demi Lovato you are forever my true inspiration❤️ keep killing it girl!
I'm so proud of you❤ you've been through so much shit that wasn't even your fault but even so you can laugh and bee happy❤ you're the strongest person I know and this documetary touches me so much❤  And I don't even have to taIk about your voice it's just unique and an beautyful. I mean you in person are unique and beautyful.❤love you😍!
Gob bless you #DemiLovato, that's the reason why you have a great team, you're such a lovable person with so much light. #thebestforyou
I've been watching this all day between work, appointments, meetings, etc so it's taken me since this morning to finish it but it's sooooo worth it! Demi has been such an inspiration to me from back when I was just a preteen watching Camp Rock for the first time all the way through high school and young adulthood until now & I am so, soooo in love with her music and how spectacularly powerful she is. \nNever stop being the gorgeous, independent, phenomenal woman you are! One day at a time, chicka! Love from Seattle; xoxoxox <3
This documentary changed my fucking life!! You're truly an inspiration demi thank you for sharing such personal and intimate details of your journey with us💖
This is amazing! Go Demi!
Wow, such an amazing young woman!
I can’t believe the quality of human that is on you. 😭💕💕
Honesly after so much she has been through I still believe she’s a very beautiful girl and beyond Gorgous
Amazing documentary. Had chills the whole time!!! Mad respect for such a young woman to have gone through so much that most people don't go through much later in life and to have overcome it all! BEAUTIFUL AND DOPE FUCKING VOICE ALSO!!
I had a health and social care thing to do about u and that’s why I watched this but also ur my inspiration and so pretty and talented. Good on you for surviving and pulling through
Thank you, for simply you, thank you
Demi you are an inspiration and so strong so proud of what you have achieved and overcome. You struggle everyday but you just got to keep pushing you give people like me strength and hope always been a fan and always will be love your music Love you Demi keep it up and your fans always be by your side 💕💕💞❤️
You are such an inspiration Demi. You're pretty, talented, can't even begin to explain how amazing you are! You have helped others like me who are depressed not feel so depressed. I got bullied in elementary school and had terrible friends who wouldn''t stop bothering me, even when I felt I needed breaks from them. I cried every single day, feeling like nobody actually cared about me. Sometimes I still feel like that. The one thing is, I got more confident throughout my years in middle school, since I got bullied a lot there too. I have always stayed strong and never did anything I knew would hurt the ones that I loved. I wanted to be able to stay strong, and I did. I am 14 years old and became depressed when I was just 9 years old. The bullying got to me a lot, everyone at school called me a crybaby and I barely had any friends, and the friends I had weren't really true friends at all and seemed more like all the other bullies than friends. In middle school, I had more friends, but they would always just leave me to talk to their other friends, leaving me all alone during lunch and PE and most of my class periods. 3 students came up to my best friend and I at lunch one day and started talking shit to us, and I finally had the courage for once to do something, I lifted up my middle finger and said fuck you to them. After that happened, it got memed because someone had taken a video of it and took a picture of me while sticking my middle finger out. They posted the video on YouTube, and I felt torn apart, I cried so much and nobody knew it was because of that, they thought I was just being overdramatic. Now I have amazing friends and try to keep negative influences out of my life. I like to help others, like one of my friends, his name is Dalton, he is super depressed and loves being negative, loves the idea of killing himself. He refused to get help. I tried to help as much as I could, but it all became too much for me. He left such a negative impact on me that I knew I couldn't help him. From the beginning, I knew he needed professional help. He fell in love with me, and everytime we talked he always said he loved me, and it made me want to cry. I didn't want to hear that. I never felt the same way about him. Every time I talked to him, I ended up crying right after. He is now out of my life. He will be getting help soon from professionals. I always feel like I can make an impact on people if I try hard, I won't give up on people. But, this time I had to. My friends and my family noticed I was acting differently, and asked me what was going on, I burst into tears and told them that I was feeling depressed and told them what Dalton was saying and doing, and they made me stop talking to him. I am much better off now than ever before. Everyday, I become stronger and stronger, and so do all of you. Never give up and be happy with your life. I hope I can make people reading this feel better and that I can make some sort of impact. I love my life now as it is, and I don't want anything to change.
It is so refreshing to see Demi find her happiness. Her story is simply beautiful.
I am so fucking proud of her, i love her
Who else is rewatching the stay strong documentary after this?
Being that I'm about to hit my second year of sobriety I needed to watch this. Demi is an inspiration. I never knew what a hard road she has walked down. From her addiction to her mental health struggles to the pain she feels over her relationship, I never knew I'd identify so much with her. I feel her pain. Loneliness is the hardest war to win.
So inspiring. I had the chills the entire time. Thank you Demi for staying strong and being such a huge inspiration for all of us. ❤️
I didn't even know I needed this in my life right now. Thank you Demi.
Thank you so much for sharing this Demi
this is inspiring. I feel like i can do it too! thank you
4,5 million views in a day and not trending??
This documentary let me without words such an inspiration
I absolutely love this. It's so raw and it shows a clear message of what Demi is trying to convey. All of her lyrics just fit into place. \nLove you Demi, stay strong <3
this is bringing me to watch camp rock streaming hahahaha
That’s so crazy... I watched sonny with a chance and camp rock and had no idea any of this was going on.
Well, like the song... I have questions\n\n1 - Didnt Demi left rehab in 2011 january? I mean, of course that if she was still addicted at that time they could have covered it all up, but i honestly was sure that during that Unbroken times she was healed. \nThe documentary passed the message for me that even in 2012 during the xfactor she was still in trouble, and i get that her management wouldnt let all that appear. \n\nSo can someone tell me it during those 2011-2012 years, that documentary and all the Im healthy now was just a fake? I am really confused and sad if its true.\n\n2 - Why didnt she mentioned 2013 until 2016 fases? She was really on the public eye and it must have been a lot of pressure with selling and charting and social media and i thought she would speak more about those days. So why she didnt\n\n3 - You guys... Do you really think that Demi is healthy now? I mean, if my 1st question is right they (her management team) could be faking the whole thing again.  I dont really believe that because the documentary was so profound and truthful but i wish i could read your thoughts.\n\n\nDemi, if you ever read that, now that you inspire so many people and its so good to see you for real, focused on sending a real message, i hope you get well, for the real reasons and once and for all. Even if you costs your carrer or instagram likes, do what fills your heart and not what dries your soul.\n❤️
you are truly an inspiration for me, i wish i could be as raw and as honest as you on this documentary.. i am so proud of you, keep spreading love, i love youu demi.. and always will.
Wow this was beautiful I am in tears. I feel so empowered and not alone. Keep making us proud Demi #empoweredwomenempowerothers
demi trust me i watched it till the enddd
cried so much during this, so proud of Demi
such an inspiration, but so underrated x i love her so fucking much omg
I relate to her so much. There's power in her vulnerability <3 thank you for sharing your story.
I was only going to watch the first 15 minutes of this cause I had studying to do too but I got hooked on watching this after the first minute and stayed till the end. It was a super great documentary! And I'm really glad that Demi could share her story with us because I feel like it was really enlightening and something that I could learn from. 👍🏼😊
DEMI YOU'RE BEEN MY FAV SINCE THE AMERICAN IDOL . SO INSPIRING TO ME LOVE U DEMI, ADORE U , AFFINITY TOWARDS U . LOVE U , MAY U REPLY COMMENT IT WILL MEAN SO MUCH TO ME
Her manager and the rest of her support group went above and beyond to help her. When someone hits rock bottom like she did, having someone can make all the difference and they really cared and were there for her. It's so inspiring to see that and also that she took their help and slowly began to recover. Such an inspiration Demi 👏
Have always been a fan but because of this and seeing her personality and struggles I am in love 😍
Sometimes I forget how much we love(d) her. Godspeed Demi.
Everything about this was remarkably beautiful. ❤😭😘
demi's laugh is so contagious
I love her voice when she talks omg
I can’t even express my respect for her. I feel like I’ve struggled along with Demi for so long (I got my first DWI while driving home from her concert with the Jonas Brothers in 2008) but it is so much easier seeing someone you look up to and relate to on such a deeply personal level come out on the other side. We do recover.
Demi you are strong, beautiful, brave, don’t let anyone tell you anything else God made you the way you’re suppose to be and I love the way you are don’t ever change and I truly believe that this is documentary will show a bunch of people who the real, raw, vulnerable Demi is and that’s who we want to see because you’re human and of course you make mistakes but in the end you are still you, you’re working on yourself everyone is.\nLove you Demi \n❤️ Aleah
You are so brave to talk about it all out loud - Thank you.
so beautiful
You made something incredible
LOVE YOU DEMI ✊
Wow! Just wow. 💘

U are right, perspective. Some t things take ti me to click, or to recognize. I'm so grateful to see this tonight. Best wishes. Xoxo.
okay but why can’t i find the song she sings anywhere ( go to 39:50 )\n“standing on the front line\nstaring at the sunrise \nover the hill........” \nit’s beautiful.
Why does she look so pissed while trying to record You dont do it for me anymore song. It's like she takes 0 pleasure singing that song.
I can relate to Demi a lot with her anxiety, and depression etc and finding herself. (Except for drugs and eating disorder) I know how she feels I loved Demi before, but I love her even more now. Btw what's the song at 40:45
my favorite kid in Hiho i love u Clara
Clara is my favorite :D <3 She is life.
The flying lettuce definitely takes the cake for me
That montage at the end though
What a smart little girl. Adorable
When she was eating lettuce I was like that's me 😂
Her facial expression give me life
It’s free now
omg i love her she’s my favorite, she’s so funny 😂
Sweetest little thing in the world. Claras videos are past good!
This almost makes me cry
Her face when something tastes good kills me everytime she just seems so happy 😂😂😍
I swear she takes a blunt before these videos 😂
she's just so adorbsss
Clara is trending happy to know that people love her as much as I do
Bewries\nI miss her SO SO SO MUCH
I love how she tries everything, no fear!! Clara you're awesome!
She's the cutest!!!
What is there to dislike about these vedio.\nHeartless people.
Where's the moment that she says I like the spoon , though
I’m obsessed with the flying lettuce part, I can’t.
50,000 views and trending gets a big thumbs down.
aaaah drippy chocolate... oooooom ahahah so damn adorable =D this is what I needed, she put a huge smile on my face. i can sleep in peace now ahaha
Watching children eat food on YouTube in 2017 guys. What a thrill.
She reminds me of the little cute girl in despicable me
So great videos published on my birthday!!😆😆yayyy
She's adorable! I also wonder if her parents feed her though 😂
Clara is my favorite kid to watch on here! I don't understand how Drippy Chocolate is #5... It's higher up for me! She's so much fun and very goofy... definitely joy. :)
clara is the best ahaha
Look at the thousand expressions this little lady has. I could watch her all day! Foodcrazies rule the world! 😁
I'M SURE SHE'S BEEN TOUCHED BY MASONIC ANGELS ALREADY....
She is my favorite
I could tag someone but I wouldn't. This girl is your sweetheart
I love Clara SO MUCH!
The flying lettuce gets me everytime ❤️
Oh God she’s so lovely and cute i love her so muchh

Venezuela is in a tough place and it would be nice to show how beautiful Venezuelan culture is, buzzfeed PEROLIKE shined some light into the situation in Venezuela. Please make the kids try traditional Venezuelan food!! Chicha, arepas, tequeños, empanadas, pastelitos, cafe con leche y pan dulce, mandocas, torta de tres leches and more!! I am Venezuelan myself and really like watching this kids learn about other countries through their culinary perspect.
I'm stealing her food grading system.

Thank You, Cristine, for showing us your inside beauty
WHEN I SAW THIS I NEVER CLICKED SO FAST

Ok, So i have been OBSESSED with your videos for the past week or so. And i just realized i was not subscribed. WHATS WRONG WITH ME ?? welp, that just changed 30 seconds ago. Love the vids ! <3
Omg... Holo Jelly (cups)???!!!! I'm apologise in advance if this is a stupid idea but my mind has been turned into mush coz I actually have my (HSC)exams right now but I just thought of holo jelly😂😂🔫🔫
U should do this with the pink stylus! He did a alice angel makeup, and he made everone think he was a girl one guy even called him sexy 😂 hes really good! Also loved this video! Keeping it \nH💿L💿~\n(Ripley and menchie are sooooo cute!)
I love both. Both look real to me. You are a Holo android. That's why you are the best. Because you're a fucking android.
Boys and girls of every age wouldn’t you like to see something strange come with us and you will see this our town of Holoween📀💿 this is Holoween📀💿 everybody make a scene trick or treat till the neighbors gonna die of fright! It’s our town everybody scream in this town of Holoween!📀💿
Lol I'm a bible nerd so if you're wondering, beelzebub (what mykie introduced herself as) is the prince of demons 😁👍
I'm hollow inside :')
When both post and u need to decide who to watch. *OML WHY!!!*
This is so cool
You should buy holo (not holo) makeup and make it better by chopping it up and making it really fcking HOLO
If you ever end up in Germany or she ever ends up in Canada, you should team up with It's Black Friday and do some kind of holo goth thing. She's done nail art before!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh57DH2WeoQ
When I die I want to be mummified and wrapped in h💿l💿 foil

Cristine you look better than before.
I thought this was a nail channel

Obsessed!
Not bad, you have about a week to gain 200 lbs.
Just watching this to support my fellow FL homegirl/artist, not really into make-up😎
The more I watch Fleurs videos, the more I want to meet her for a cuppa and just chat!  Xx
a very nice haul
Is this a shopping channel?
Nice
wow that pink-red scarf is amazing!!
Love the Nina Kendosa stuff! Lots of nice things on their website.
Love this haul, I need that Zara scarf in my life! Where about's is the love me t shit from that you are wearing? Hope the pregnancy is going well, you look great xx
lol I feel like your thoughts on the pains of dressing when pregnant are just the same as my everyday pain of dressing when being a fatass. \n\nStill, you look awesome and your style 👌
I can tell you have changed sense you've been pregnant, in a good way. You are much more laid back and seem  genuinely more content.
Like this view better!
That all saints dress though😩😩 I think my bank balance is about to take a round house kick to the face 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️ I LOVE it!!! Looking gorge too Fleur x
Hi fleur I like the video setup really like the cardigans on you.you look amazing and so happyxx😀
S
Cute, cute, cute!!!   Looking fab, Fleur!
Airforce blue maybe? 🤔 xx
Fleur, you must try Common Projects sneakers - so comfy!!!
Fleur, I've been watching you for years and I've JUST realised what it is about you -- you smile like Ariel. How charming.
Get it girl 👌🏽👌🏽
http://videofullhd.info/5_kashias8.html
Awesome
Шо за піздєц?
What do you use to curl your hair? Your hair is amazing!!! Xx
You're looking beautiful as ever. X
Fleur, your necklace is lovely. Where is it from?
natural light is okay with me, cause it's more real street looking when you tried on many clothes.
You're amazing! I prefer the main set up but this was still so lovely to watch :)
vans waffle gum sole designed to grip your skateboard consistently... but you knew that
I kind of love he less professional camera look but both are nicr
You're looking so beautiful I know everyone probably saids it to you but you're glowing! Your hair looks so thick, shiny, healthy and pretty
you look beautiful in this video, fleur :)
You guys are talking about 3-4 children. You will use the black 2 piece if that is the case!
I like this for hauls and the other for more close up, like for tutorials, makeup, etc.
The dusty cardigan with the waist cinching suites you really well! 😊
I don't think this camera looks less professional! Works great for haul videos!
Love the All Saints 2 pc. However, you won't wear it after. Trust me! So enjoy wearing it now and for the rest of your pregnancy. You look gorgeous! x
You look so pretty and your hair so shiny!! You should definitely put down what lipstick you're wearing in your description box, I always look for it and its never there!
I don't mind this set up for a more casual vibe but prefer the usual set up x
I like the set up with the vlog camera! You also look stunning in this video!x
Please could you look into the lens rather than at yourself in the viewfinder with these types of videos? \nIt's just a little off putting having you look up rather than directly forward.
🌸 awesome 🌸 but would be less distracting if you'd look into the lens instead above it  😉 since you don't need to check if you are in frame all the time..
The All Saints two piece set is so pretty!
You should try and invest in maternity clothing that doubles as nursing clothing.  You'll thank yourself when you've had the baby and need clothes to wear when the relatives/friends come over in the first month and you're still in pain from the birth (when you can't go out or don't have time to online shop haha).
LOVE this camera! Also it's fun seeing you in slightly ditzy baby brain mode :'D
I must say I prefer the normal setting to this... Love watching u!
Need more lighting it’s a bit dark
I never wore maternity clothing while pregnant  not even jeans
Great Autumn Haul....love your purchases!  Thanks for sharing with us.
I think the two cardigans you got in Paris will look very nice with a plain tight white t-shirt tucked into jeans (for non-pregnant wear in the future). 💖
Which vlog camera do you use Fleur? Loved this! Xo
Love this camera set up, I  feel more at home visiting you when it is less Professional....
the jumper/dress is amazing! you look so so good in it!
I like this camera a lot! X
Grey Scarf from Asos looks more blue on camera? I love my chunky scarf too in winter and a less chinky material mix polyester and cotton when there is a chill in the air. I love like a wine colour coat or a deep green during winter season's. Also knee boots and ankle shoes. And wouldn't be winter if you don't have chunky jumpers too which i love to wear when the cold weather comes in.
Love pregnant Fleur! You're so chilled and spacy LOL
Oh my god!! That All Saints dress!!! 😍
I think you have the best style, always feel like I need to do some serious shopping after I watch your hauls!
Those Vans sneakers just reminded me of a boy who was lying to me and was a complete jerk, and he always wore those shoes and nothing else, he just liked them so much. I did have a crush on him at first because he seemed so nice, but eventually he showed his real face. I hate being reminded of him, but oh well... xD Love the scarfs though! <3
Pregnancy really suits you - you are truly glowing xx
I love the setup.  And all the sweaters!
Loving this setup! As well as the fun extra comments from the pregnancy brain haha x
I'm sick of seeing this Toni and guy ad before every YouTube video!!!
I love this video, and I prefer this camera, it's wonderfullly sharp.
Your love of scarves will come in handy when Bub arrives, cover breast leakage if you breastfeed and vomit or poop if it gets on you. Love the grey scarf.
I loved this! Its great seeing autumnal pieces that can be used during pregnancy because I think a lot of pregnant women just want to feel like they're in normal clothes. I liked the camera too, personally I would just used it for the rest of your pregnancy if it's easier 😛
I’d call the cardi towards the end “denim blue”
you look so beautiful, Fleur! love the hair...it looks amazing!\nloved all the pieces...especially the scarf from zara and the coat! \nthe setup is just fine! go with it!❤️😘
What lipstick are you wearing, Fleur? Love the video ♥️
I really like the “less professional” look! I liked youtube much more 5 years ago, so a video that is (still very well made) not like a professional TV production is refreshing:)
Love this video too and your set up is very good - nothing to change Fleur. Could you also make a video at some point of your preferred brands for basics such as knitwear, scarfs etc. Thanks!
The two piece black dress is beautiful on you!
If you like that floaty style, there’s a brand called “LOGO” on QVC that is all lovely and comfy like that. You might find a few more pieces that you’d like!
Love the new setup!
You look fab and loving your hair
You have such a nice voice, I want you on my sat Nav 😀
Yes keep using this camera~ its loads better (no blurry back ground) woo hoo x
If u sub me I will sub back , let's help each other out xxxxx
1: your hair is AMAZING\n2: I like the normal set up for tutorials and favorites, but this is ok for first impressions and reviews - it's up to you anyway.\n3: I love the fact that you mix pregnant clothes with normal clothes. My friend is pregnant and she's had enough of pregnant clothes.
I'd like a mix of both camera style :)
I like both of them 😊 but this is way more cozy😄
i like your necklace Fleur! i like either set up.. the cut aways with this one it was kinda hard to see good. like was that a high low sweater? or was a longer piece attached? also, buy yourself a nice clothes steamer! changed my life girl! xo editing.. buy the steamer and then say In your face Mike De Force! LOL xoxoxo
I like when u film on blog camera even tho it looks less professional but when u can and have time film on the DSLR.
❤️ U ,  just a tip for sneakers I use baby wipes to clean the white parts and they can look new for as long as they are loved.
Fleur you need a handheld steamer!!  It is seriously life changing - no more ironing ever!  Works perfectly on something like that top you have and you can travel with it as well.
You should totally do a trainers / tennis shoes collection video! 😄
Both set-ups are great. It just depends on the type of videos you're filming. It's also nice to switch things up every now and then.
Love it Fleur!!!! You are by far my fav youtuber 💝💝💝💝
Hold the phone.....'soopergus?!!'\n\nI thought they were called super-gas?!!
The colour of that deep red coat is really lovely
Pregnancy brain is a real thing medically! All your blood is going to the baby and not your brain! (;
Aww what a lovely haul and absolutely love seeing you so happy :D
I don't mean this in a bad way but the baggy clothes totally hides the bump. You could only really see the bump when you move your hands around it. It kind of makes (all pregnant women not just you) look bigger than you are because that bump is hidden under all the fabric. Sweaters are totally an exception but when it comes to dresses and shirts i think its more flattering to be in a stetchy almost skin tight (without actually being tight) top that way you don't look frumpy you just look pregnant. In the end just wear whatever you are comfortable in! I just think baby bumps are cute and should be shown off.
Ha ha so confused - reading the text on the screen for the white sneakers as Super Gas and Fleur is saying Supérges what even is that name? 😬
Fleur you look amazing pregnant! So glowing and your hair grew loads too! Good luck and keep posting these videos, love your vlogs with mike, you too are such cuties!xx
I think the setup is great and you look so beautiful I cannot stop smiling to your video 😁sending lots of love from Denmark 🇩🇰❤️❤️❤️
You will wear those cardigans nonstop with like a black nursing tank if you are going to breastfeed. That will be your uniform for awhile;) but the cardigans you picked out are so cute you will look great doing it! Great style as always!
Love the blue cardigan on you. The blue looks good with your skin tone 👍
It’s a little hard to see the clothes when you’re trying it on because of the window in the background
I need a new cardigan...I had a really nice white one but I spilled permanent paint on it (I didn't know it at the time) and it's in a really obvious place. Totally heartbroken.\n\nGreat video! I have an awesome color block scarf from Anthropologie that reminds me of your Zara one!\n\nI like the vlog camera as I think it is the best at capturing natural light (which is also easier on my sensitive eyes) but I'm also not picky. :)
I love that chenille sweaters are popular this season. Zara has one that would fit over your bump! SO SOFT
Like vlog setup and if it's easier then do it - you're gonna need all the shortcuts in the world to make life easier once the baballoo arrives.  Be kind to yourself honey.
🚨🚨WARNING!! STOP HERE IF U DONT WANT SPOILERS!! THE COMMENTS WILL RUIN THE EXPERIENCE! WATCH THEN READ!!🚨🚨 lmfao
WHY DID SHE CHANGE HER NAME FROM THE GABBIE SHOW TO GABBIE HANNA?!?! SHE IS NOT THE GABBIE SHOW ANYMORE WHYYYYYY?!?!?!
this is so fucking good but when i first heard the song i didnt think it was about him dying lol
hmmmm.... good surprise, nice music, nice video.... BUT.... a little originality would go a long way for music.
Who else cries just before the funeral scene because you realised what was happening
i love this so much. it’s my third time watching it 😂😂❤️
My notification still says thegabbieshow just posted a video 
BRING THE GABBIE SHOW BACK! I'm so confused on why it's now Gabbie hanna now it sounds a bit silly
I literally just cryed...  its so good!!!  You have really high acting skills!!
Wow it's so good
I thot you how bad voice but this is great
Tbh, I kind of expected the boyfriend to be dead •-• it was the rose that triggered me, don't blame me
damnit i knew he was gonna be dead whyyy
I never understood why she said now your just a ghost now and now i know. What a plot twist. Was not expecting this... but its amazing!
You rock don’t stop. Keep going for it. I dig you chica. Peace ✌️
Three days later and I still can't believe this video like oh my gosh Gabbie it's so fucking good.
This song hit home for me. I cried.... Love this song 🌹 Love you Gabbie.💗
Wow. This video made me cry so much. It makes you think and I've been through this. This video really touched me😢😭
I love this song so much you go girl!!
The old Gabbie show can’t come to the phone right now \nWhy??\nOh cuz she’s dead!!!
Where is the gabbie show!?!??!!
What is this piece of shot ..the music is out and the video just saps all the good things about the music.
The tears are real\nOMG gabbie I'm so proud of you
I wish I could like this more than once cos it's SO FREAKING GOOD
Holy shit gabbie that's actually so deep I thought it was about a breakup but it's so much more
the part where the music snaps and the setting changes to the funeral gives me chills every single time
I love this video and I love you Gabbie 💞
Omg Gabbie this was amazing I'm  so proud of you! Most artists  these days would be too afraid to put actual death and it gives such a better meaning to the song.
Killing it! ...Too soon?\nI loved the song so much, I'm glad the video is finally here. A real art piece, I can't wait to see more!
I wonder how much of this has really happened?
OMG THIS IS SO FUCKING GOOD !!!!!!!
For never being in a music video before, you killed this.
Ohh I get it ._. He's dead :(
Gabbie this song is everything I love it thank you for making it <3 I’m seriously considering making my YouTube channel a cover channel and I want to start with your song.
I'm so proud of you!
I hope Liza has a song too

your the only person to get me damn emotional love this so so so so much keep coming back
This makes me think about my ex. Why gabs???? Making me feel feels again 🤢
Wow... that was so powerful. You did such an amazing job. The lighting and colour change was perfect plus the emotions you put into every scene made the music feel so much more raw and real.
One of the best music videos i have ever watched. AMAZING work Gabbie 😁
why am i crying in the club
I somehow already sensed the ending because losing my man is one of my worst fears.This was so sad.😭 Ly Gabbie.❤
This is a dope video.  Bravo
omg that was sooo sad at the end :(
am i the only one that hears the broken/out of tune piano sounds in the background?
I'm so proud of you!!!!!😂😭
Man that's beautiful ...just bringing everything to life...from poem and books to songs and videos that's crazy
OMG I LOVE THIS SOOOO MUCH BTW!!!!! And can you also make a different video to explain what this whole song means please??!!!
Beautiful song, but very sad! I absolutely love this song! 😍❤

=i am in luv with this song*
I get chills everytime I watch or listen to this 😭😭
When are you going to be on Spotify lol I love it❤️❤️❤️
2:10 I'M 99.99999% SURE SHE'S LOOKING THROUGH POEMS IN ADULTOLESCENCE?!?\n\n\n\n...DID I FIND AN EASTER EGG?!
Why is it Gabbie Hanna now? ;-;
*HE IS LITERALLY A GHOST NOW*
Why did I just realise she changed her name to Gabbie Hanna?!?! Also 2:11 there's a man standing there

This is gay , 👃🏻
WUT
HAHA LITERALLY
If ya'll like our accent so much, you should come to NZ and hear it face to face. We sound awful, lmao
wow don't you love when everything that was making you not lose hope in a show is crushed in under 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
THE STRANGER THINGS REFERENCE THEORY GOT ME SHOOK
I WANT TO LOVE HIM BUT HE HASN’T SEEN STRANGER THINGS\n\nAlso 6 Days I am so freaking excited anyone else??
IT ISNT TONI FUCK IT, i have a feeling hope it could go to josie
it hurt me heart when he didn’t get the stranger things reference but i still love kj
My names Toni and to hear him say it made my heart melt 😭😭😭❤️❤️
His reaction to Cheryl maybe being Archies twin is saaaaaaah cute! 😍
i’m so down with resurrecting jason\ni’ll even do it myself\n(winc)
Jason being Archie's twin would be cool, but I think even the cast and crew forget that Jason and Cheryl are older than the rest. If Jason was supposed to be a senior so would Cheryl. The rest are sophomores
The cast agreed in an interview that people with magic powers would make the show seem unrealistic and make the issues in it seem less important. unless they be trying to cover up some shit cause if sabrina comes i'm gonna flip my shit I already didn't like that teacher boo boo \n\n*sits flipping out now thinking of peoples theories you know becoming an emotional wreck like I was when the first season ended with Archies dad being shot and hearing bughead might end next season you know the usual)
I ship Archie and Betty DONT @ ME
THE TEA YES PLEASE
hey not ALL of these were absurd though. a couple were actually really great
nothing cuter in this world than this video.
My best friend has a little girl crush on KJ hahahaha I love her
He’s so cute wow
« I haven’t seen stranger things either » shut yo mouth Ik you did
I feel like Cheryl Blossom's love interest will be Chic Cooper (Betty's older brother).
HOW HAS KJ APA NOT SEEN STRANGER THINGS!!!!!
I WOULD LICK EVERY SINGLE INCH OF HIS NAKED BODY 😂😂😂😂😂😂
he's so different from archie, i'm not sure which one i love more
Is it just me or does his hair look more orange this season?
I love that I live like 20 mins away from Auckland home
1:37 oh shit they got it
This guys really nice in real life.
so I’m like obsessed with pillowcase in the sky and he sings it and I’m like yoooooo what?
HE'S FROM NEW ZEALAND?! I'M FROM ZEALAND!!\nNZ SQUAD
I’m in love
Can't stop staring at his face he's so gorgeous wow
I didn't realise his ACCENT!!!
he feels so different regularly than the TV show\n\n\nbut damn hes hot
Has anyone heard kjs stomach growling at the beginning
I stopped smiling when he said he doesn't know what Stranger Things is.
I’ll cry if Sabrina the teenage witch is in it I don’t want herrrrrr I don’t need anymore supernatural shows
His hair reminds me of fried chicken.
IM TEARING UP VUX OF THE FP THEORY CUZ THATS LIKE THE BST FUCKING MVOIES EVER AND I'm now in deep thought about it
Oh God he’s so happy at 1:35 😂❤️
I love his voice sm his accent is amazing
I stg if Archie and Cheryl become a thing I'm gonna run into a bottomless pit
The first one is from Pretty Little Liars😝
0:57 imagine him looking at you like that
I love you kj
I love the fact that he didnt get the fp is billy from scream reference
I love his laugh
I love the stranger things theorie
He has such a perfect all-American accent for the show, I love hearing him speak like his Kiwi self!
1:40 I had the same reaction... I LOVE IT AND KJ!!❤️😍❤️
FP's name is Forsythe Pendleton Jones II (or Jr.) so that theory is a no
1:38 i love the way he reacted 😂😍
How has he not seen Scream though!!? 🤦🏽‍♀️ Bad KJ! Real Bad.
the only paper he didn’t crumble up is the one that said archie is actually jason’s twin!! which would make sense as to why archie is the main character which I didn’t understand so much last season... ugh I hope this is true!! it would be so twisted & unexpected!!
Could he be any more hot?!
1:42 he's so cute
I really hope that Sabrina the Teenage Witch doesn’t come to the show. I like the fact that this isn’t about supernatural events and things that don’t exist.
RIVERDALE IS THE UPSIDE DOWN. BARB IS ARCHIE'S MOM
*what a beautiful, pure, soul <3*
KJ JUST SAID CHERYL AND TONI WON'T BE A THING I'M DELETING MY NETFLIX ACCOUNT AND THROWING AWAY MY TV
He is so good looking 😍😍
Okay but why is no one talking about how on point he looks...
I love how he’s just casually giving out spoilers
Is it odd that I love KJ but can't stand Archie at times? I guess that's what good acting looks like 🤣
its weird hearing him without the american accent
I love how his eyes changed from dark brown in the show to light brownish hazel in this video
How can a human be that hot ?? 😩😍
The theory that Archie is a Blossom somehow is alive
noooo the theory about Cheryl and Toni is considered absurd
His laugh I can’t.
KJ Apa is an passionate actor.
gnarliness
fp is actually billy 😂
hey daddy
What an angel
What a hottie 🥀❤️🔥
I love him
HIS LAUGH IS BREATHTAKING
Woah. That hair though 😍
Aachie

hymmm
YES BARB!!!!
Zaddy
so sad cheroni won't be canon :( i had so much hope for them making cheryl a lesbian
I have a bigger and better beard
Thank you, Mr. Kimmel. You guys're hilarious together: oldster jokes at a minimum; timing impeccable; great tie-ins to memories; sly, dry references to what we're going through now; profanities appropriate. I only wish the FCC bluestockings would stop asserting their power, interrupting the flow, by bleeping out words I hear ten-to-fifteen year-olds use daily. In broad daylight. Oh, and is David keeping the bull for a reserve supply, or to ride, the next time anyone invites him on-air?
10:00 Netflix still mails out movies.  There's a bigger selection that way than with streaming, too.
David Letterman: another sexual predator who got a pass from liberals.
Letterman had trump on his show many times over the decades on nbc and cbs but so he was not hated by his liberal following he started bashing trump as soon as he became president but in all the years before that never had a problem with him that just goes to show you how fake and organized the libs are.
I never found this guy funny...glad to see him gone. Who does he think he is now? ZZ Top?\n.
I miss this guy so much!!
The motherfucking GOAT  of late nights!!!! Dave, we missed you!
THANK YOU for uploading the full interview!
Pure gold in human form. 💙
Miss Dave, but his jokes were a little on the weak side in this one
Omg I've really missed him. He's so funny.
The King makith an appearance
I look like a civil war statue  HAHAHA LMAO Only Dave can get away with that!
Just like johnny did on dave’s show two years after his retirement in 1994 passing the torch to the next guy
Do I leave now??
That's slim Santa!\nHe's the Slim Santa\nYeah, he's the real Santa\nAll you other Slim Santas are just little Satans\nSo won't the real Slim Santa please stand up
Letterman just escaped the mountains and left his beloved goat there.
He’s still go it ;)
I feel like shots were thrown
David Letterman looks like Dan Dennett nowadays
Cuppa douchebag’s.🖕🏻
Masterful Beard.. Dammm Gandalf, Dumbledore are all Jealous.. lol
Omg it's David Letterman!!!!
David Letterman is slowly turning into Santa Claus, only skinnier.
dave is a legend. someone should tell jimmy he's supposed to tell jokes not be one.
Wow! Dave killed it! Also, Jimmy Kimmel is the best late night host on air!
talk about the art of waffling without actually saying anything. Should become a politician
he comes to jimmy show first after he retired :)
Wow. I never saw how amazing  Jimmy's set was before. \n\nAmerican talk shows are so much more impressive than British haha.
It is hilarious to send somebody a horse. Yeah.
He is soooo old, why cant he stay at home.
Who knew audiences were that big?
Am I the only one who doesn't know who this guys is??? Old people SMH
He should call his show, The Show Where We Talk To Interesting People.
Also, in case anyone hasn't figured this out, Dave and Conan are - and have for years - been good friends, even though they were competitors.
*Ben Shapiro for President 2020! Like of you agree!*
Sounds like they have mixed David Letterman quieter than Jimmy... Anyone agree..
God this is great!
Wow. Is that Santa?
I don't know, Letterman seemed rusty or tired or something, his delivery didn't have the same punch it used to.  And it looks like he got the suit and tie at Sears.
why do people like audio mixes that sound like an empty warehouse?
I miss David Letterman's show.
I don't care what anyone thinks. Dave was number 1 with me for 30+ years. Before that it was Carson - Before that it was Steve Allen. Yes, I am THAT old. Have a nice day :)
Do you know Jimmy Kimbo was a sports announcer on KROQ Los Angeles and late 80s
While Letterman seems to have gone a little nutty, I still miss him on television. I'm happy that Jimmy found a way to form a friendship.
Love Letterman but this interview kinda sucked.
Anyone else just see a black screen?
Dave scores an interview with the Flex Seal guy’s brother! 😂
This is awesome it made my day👍
Letterman has gone with the grey beard and grey socks combo! Sure sign of old age
You promised, Good things will happen forever. don't let me down Jimmy!
years of being clean shaven then you retire... grows a Santa like beard he is and will always be the greatest talk show host ever thanks David for always making us smile
I like Dave but don't like you Jimmy, just sayin!
Nice, he should cut that beard though
Legend.  Had been watching him since 1992.  Highly intelligent and just raw funny.   Rare talent.
Dave needs to gain some weight if he's going to be a realistic Santa Clause this year.
No on the beard. Someone needs to have a talk with him.
Sad attempt to pull JK show out of a raitings nosedive
Sorry Dave but you do look like an aging vagrant.
I love this guy! The world needs Letterman.
if you're gonna wear a beard like that then why bother with a suit, tie and shoes?
I look lika a civil war statue lol!
ISSUE ONE!  She's an equestrian... Lol!   6:00
Oh dear. 2 years off and he's already demented.
Love this man, watched him D.L. for yrs. Looks awesome Congrats. Dave on the Mark Twain award, & everything you did , for so many yrs.  😄💖👤👓👏
Dear Jimmy a mans joints where only designed by the creator to give to a certain point.     \nA man that knows the truth of things & fights against his own self is a coward.
Dave Letterman looks like he has just come back from a Civil War reenactment. What the heck!
Did he join the Taliban?
Is the audience big enough?
Sadly, Letterman just struck me as an old guy who's losing his memory and not making a lot of sense.  Not impressed.  And I used to like Letterman, but I think his mind is going and now he just comes across as grandpa without a clue.
Your. A. Disgrace. 2 USA. 🚽❗🚽\n🌑 NFL 🌑. Lover 📣❗📣
Dave appears quite thin/losing muscle mass.  He's hiding it with his loosely tailored suit and heavy beard to fool your eye.  Very bad for older men to lose muscle mass;  portends a disfavorable prognosis.
Karl Marx is reborn
Hahaha Dave looking like Chris Kringle  XD he’s awesome !!
The GOAT
🎅!!! I know him... 🎅 ☺
Belief successfully invitation transfer flesh bunch best killing.
GOAT
god i miss Dave
I miss wearing makeup!!.....lmao!
Wow, this conan letterman stuff
That beard is awesome
Very distinguished!
Legend
un-tuck-it(.)com
Santa
even Jimmy Fallon lol (aka Lonnie Donnegan)
_Punished David_
Aww these two chooks like good together
Even Jimmy Fallon  lol
I miss Dave ❤️
yawn
👎
10:45 FLEX SEAL. Letterman watches JonTron OwO
Lmao even Jimmy Fallon.
David Letterman is awesome....
This is amazing.
pewdiepie STOLE his look
DAve is a legend.  He still has IT.  I like the beard, actually.  I miss his smart ass questions to egomaniac celebrities. But, he's living a great life raising his boy.  Good for him.
Pick em up and set em down!!! Do you feel dizzy? Do you feel faint? ....Jesus h Christ!!! I think you got a hard on !!!
Such a good tune and lyric, as only Morrissey can do
The king is here💖
One of the very few I'd describe as an idol of mine, but his albums since years of refusal have been shocking. If he still enjoys it fine, but world peace was a terrible record and if this is anything to go by, the new one won't be any better...
Cool keyboard intro. I wanna hear that sampled soon
New music: very Good.
love this ! i like the way he falls of the seat at the end lol, your the one for me fatty xx. what a great message to send out as well it reminds me of timothy leary turn on - tune in and spend the day in bed
I love this song so much!!!
I'm guessing somebody confined to a wheelchair will be offended by the opening. Par for the course.
Yup ... I love this song 😊🎧
Joey Barton.\nThe thinking man's twat.
His writing is not as impressive as earlier days. Lyrically he has become too literal.
Write your own music. Then we can talk. 🙂
I love this man 10 out off 10 class Morrissey
MORRISSEY I LOVE YOU GOD
the famous macunian is back,at last!
What is that man doing here?
Wheel around the fountain.
Remember when Morrissey’s music was garbage ?\n\n\nYeah me neither
What a load of shite!
Spent the day in floor
This reminds me very much of a Bernard Manning video towards the end of his life where he performed his stand up routine sat in a chair in a club, i wonder if the similarity is intentional? or possibly Phoenix Nights!! All Hail Mozza the King!!
Glad to see Morrissey is back! I've missed him!(:
This Charming Man has another hit on a hillside desolate.
I like his vocal performance and the melody, but the lyrics are a bit literal...and his sudden physical resemblance to Quentin Tarantino is freaking me out.
I'm late to the party but I love this
I can't listen to (or defend) this bloated racist anymore.
Love love love. That voice has always made me completely fulfilled.
Where is the Rock?
Possibly the best song he has done solo, and close to the best of Smiths songs.
Listening to this while I'm un bed hehehe
Stop watching the news!\nBecause the news contrives to frighten you\nTo make you feel small and alone\nTo make you feel that your mind isn't your own\n\nthanks for this, the brainwashing continues but we can stop it by stop watching the propaganda day in day out
I spent the day in bed
So now they're The Beautiful South.\n\nChrist.
I think this just goes to show the real talent of The Smiths was Jonny Marr. This is poppy crap.
the song is so nice, why does he have to sing about fake news? since when is he like that? i thought he was leftist :(
Spent the day in bed with Jake or Julia?
That is Morrissey. A song that was missing from his work.
How about no Joey Barton?
This song is just so cringey
video cost around 30 bob to make😄
What's that prick Joey Barton doing in the video?
I love,love,love this song, best thing Morrissey has put out for years , up there with the best, must say I preferred a video I saw of it with just the lyrics overlaid over a picture of a boy on the bike, simpler and more effective, poetry
Great song , Morrissey! Love the words! Be good to yourself!
Sorry but musicians only. That guitar with the fender electric XII hockey stick neck has some piece of crap body! Why would anyone do that? Somewhere there's a classic electric XII body with no neck!!! 😣
Brilliant! I'm loving it even more!
...he’s old enough to look natural in that wheelchair.
Mais um diamante do nosso querido Morrissey!!
Vaya basura le salio
Nice.
Btw.if Manchester is dreary,you should try smacclesfield!! , However wot kind of coffee does J B partake of??? .....ATB from soggy south Macclesfield..,# sk10 2hn ..... Cally dreamer no western Pennine precipitation....,🤡🤠😇
Terrible and generic.
I love this!!
Joey Barton? wats he doing here??
Dead whish
Looooveeee
Morrissey on top form!
The Moz still is the boss  Capo di tutti lei capi  oigan
Haaaaaaaa Moz ❤

Cuidate moz!! Para que nos dures por mucho.tiempo mas,hermoso!!
Dios santo !! Dios sabe que lo amo !
Su voz aun suena tan joven!!
Y recomiendo que...\nDejes de ver las noticias!\nPorque las noticias planean atemorizarte....\nHacerte sentir pequeño y solo\nHacerte sentir que tu mente no te pertenece.\n\n\n\nViva Moz 💖 come back to Argentina
Holy shit this is good
This song needs deleting of YouTube
wasn't too crazy about the song when I first heard it but then he got me..heard it again..now I can't stop!!! dammit moz!!
Very good advice in regards to the news.
The more compressed the imagery the better
Loving these business videos :)
1992 was when we elected Clinton too. Just saying that Wal-Mart is the dredges of society. There's a reason things are cheaper there. Subsidies for the company for hiring people needing social assistance, but only giving them enough hours to shop in their stores.  At least Amazon is full of many retailers and it's own company's distribution centers.
Ohh maybe a video on how costco for comparison since it seems that they pay their employees pretty well for retail/more employee retension?
When you know nothing about Walmart because you live in the uk
Ok this isn’t the best topic to say for this video, but can you PLEASE make a video about Australia 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺\nBtw, nice video 👍
So much money is involved, it's crazy
What about E Bay?
Please Make a video on  what if the ants where size of humans\nIt would be very fun to know
obviously, because Walmart didn't sell sex toys, Amazon this more bigger and productive.
amazon pays near twice as much as walmart. I dont understand how the ending could be true.
I've worKed at Walmart, their management is lackluster but Canadian working conditions aren't bad. The wages start at minimum but I got $12.40 an hour after a store renovation. Not bad.
When only one company dominate the market, we gonna pay more. Wait to see it!
Walmart is expensive for groceries. Aldi is where it's at.
Imagine if people woke up and stop buying from these major contributors to climate change..
disorder suburban his project orientation save inevitable acceptable guidance out.
pretty sure sam walton's 10 business rules really are:\n#1 MAKE MONEY BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY\n#2 - #10 repeat #1
Amazon’s warehouse was definitely a sweatshop
As much as I know, both are scams.
That's like sounds like  how rich people argue.
I’m a amazon worker and yeah it’s true\n\nFor the 10 hours we work we get three breaks two 15 minutes and one 30 minute lunch time.after working for 2 and a half hours. But the sad thing is it takes around 4-5 mins to get to the break room so at the end the 15 minutes are only 5 minutes of sitting down\n\nAnd then the 30 minute lunch time. \nThe lunch canteen is located on the 2nd floor, I worked on the 4th floor so it took around 6 mins to go to the canteen and get food and it took the same time to get packed lunch from floor 1 lockers. So at the end you only got around 16 mins of lunch time \n\nAnd for the first few weeks they tell you to work faster everyday and will keep on telling you if you’re work rate isn’t 100 percent (250 items per hour). And if you do get a good rate they don’t really tell you about it unless you had the best rate on the whole floor which are usually the more experienced ones.
The video I did not know I needed.
Please do UK vs France!!
Key: Amazon is the future.\nWalmart will have no choice but to bow down in the long run.
I worked at the international wine center, and one of the main share holders of Amazon came in and spent $20,000 on 5 bottles total of wine and liquor. Paid with the amex black card. Was crazy because he was just buying them as gifts
I work for Amazon in a big warehouse. They do try to make us work hard and do like twice as much work sometimes. But otherwise it's a great job.
How you make videos so fast
I work at Walmart and the reason why they are not on top of Amazon is because they are not innovative at all
Actually I am not supposed to say this; but I work for Amazon and it's true. Yeah they have great benefits, the pay is decent and with all comes a great cost. Every day you are in an Amazon warehouse; they make sure you are there to work, no cell phones are allowed in the building and they make you go through security every break. Which also adds to the fact that you're being heavily watched with cameras at all times, no matter the hallway, corner, shelf, station you are on, they have eyes on you and you can easily get written up for any reason. Customer satisfaction and customer demand for fast packages every day only gets worst as time goes by, every day new internet users are buying more and more and more, and Amazon can't keep up to be honest, hiring people constantly to fill jobs up, sitting is never allowed unless it's during break. They LITERALLY make sure you are worth what they're paying you for a while shift. Not to mention you have to reach limits and number expectations per day, and if you reach them and your shift is not over, you better keep working because the computer tracks every single minute you were not active and if you are inactive for more than 30 minutes on the job, the managers job is to come by and talk to you about it and then decide to wether write you up or fire you. Amazon's expectafions are at an all time high. But somehow Amazon is still such a great place for me to work at and feel like I'm doing something in this world seeing a different package go by to different parts of the world is the best part.
I work for Walmart and we're gonna keep tearing Amazon apart!
Amazon is way better than Wal Mart.
Average American vs Average Mexican Please
amazon because they sell items that walmart dose not
Amazon is the future, considering the fact that they always do good by me and the majority of people I know of. Positive service leads to return business. Reliability leads to return business. Amazon will get all the business then.
I work for Walmart DC and can say I am paid quite generously. But... I can also say that you earn every penny by the amount of strenuous labor you put in each shift.
I really don’t care which is more successful to be honest, because at the end of the day it makes no difference to me financially   because none of them is putting money in my pocket. As a prime member I simply must say this though. I do not think it’s worth the prime membership fee just to get free two day shipping because 99% of the time I have to go and stand in line at that sorry as US postal station for two hours just to get my fucking package because they always come to deliver when people are at work and claim they attempted delivery which is not always true. I took a day off from work just to wait for my package and they never came and claimed they attempted delivery. Happened more than once by the way. Amazon, please stop using the US postal service if you want to keep me as a prime member because they really fucking suck.
Amazon has a higher ceiling cap than Walmart, unless Walmart completely changes their methods. Amazon just needs to pay their employees a little better if what this video says is true.
Well I've worked for Amazon and never had a problem
If you have noticed, Walmart employs nearly 1% of our country's population not counting people worked there before, it's ridiculous
Hate walmart.... They do a lot of shady things to the people that work for them in the us.
This is a dumb question.
Which Manchester soccer team would that be?
Profit and earnings are not the same. The fact is Amazon has no profit because it keeps investing all its money into itself. Not sure where you get your stats but you may want to check them again or re-educate yourself before you get sued for spreading misinformation.
Has 2.3 million employees but there’s only 3 registers open?
Idea:how much tv people watch in a live time
And do you know why Amazon makes more? But they can sell sex toys. A buddie if mine works in the factory and says that's all they sell
I am 17 Syl. I just wanted to make sure if you know. Feel free to tell me if you'd like to hold off on the relationship until I'm 18.
Millenials couldn't remember a time when they can't purchase online? First sentence couldn't get more wrong, for a channel that apparently sells information.\nMy windows 98 barely could handle a floppy disk, dammit.
Walmart master race it’s close by my house and I don’t want to wait weeks the get my product
You should do the Average North American vs the Average South American
you forgot to start that Walmart now sells mostly Made in China goods.
Amazon makes more because Amazon sells sex toys and Walmart can't or won't sell sex toys. Amazon does. A friend of mine works in the warehouse and he says they sell a ton of them!
Jeff bezos is the second richest person in the world. For 1 day throughout the summer he actually reached #1 but Amazon's shares fell.
Walmart has been around a lot longer then Amazon has. Amazon is catching up very fast and will soon take over Walmart. I’ve worked for Walmart and I’m currently employed by Amazon and amazon is far better to work for in my opinion.
Do modern USA v.s ancient Rome and Greece combined
Sam Walton started the Walmart practice of busting unions, instead favoring having his workers air out their grievances within the company system where they can either be ignored in favor for the company's interests or solutions (often bandaid) can be sloppily implemented at a snail's pace due to the highly bureaucratic nature of Walmart's system.
Manchester isn't the 2nd largest UK city
Amazon's quadcopters will bring along so many laws. You wouldn't even be able to look at the things wrongly
People will always want to shop.  Walmart won't go anywhere.
Can you make a video on who would win if a world war broke out between the United States and North Korea with their respective allies?\n\nlike if you would love to see this video
Unless and until they perfect GPS, drones will never be a viable alternative for delivery. I use a GPS everyday and a GPS can be off as little as 5 feet to half a mile. Not to mention the kids that will be knocking these drones out of the sky for fun.
For that you require poor desperate people lol, so true, so true.
Currently work at Walmart. Per our disclosure agreement I can’t state anything other than that
Jeff is the richest man
Once the Amazon perfects their robots, bye bye warehouse jobs and hello increased profit margins. I imagine that Amazon will start buying up self-driving vehicle companies soon.
Both are the demise of the local economy.
How come we drink drinks, but we don't eat, eats?
I think Walmart wins because it doubles over as a concentration camp
When people have 30 items in the self checkout lane...\n...\nAnd don't have a card when it doesn't accept cash
I dont even leave my house for shopping. Amazon Prime delivers groceries to my home for free and for buying anything else I can just use the site. I havent celebrated black friday in years since companies have been having much better sales online for years. And once I get a Tesla I wont ever have to visit gas stations ever again :D
What a coincidence. Amazon is opening up here in Memphis with salaries of about $29000 a year.
Basically the intro: YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR JOB
if they both collaborate 😐😯
Did someone say destroying small businesses😂😂
When you buy something on Amazon, you support rape culture.
Predatory capitalist tax evaders. Both companies destroying jobs and other small business. Two monopolies that need each other
You can't use CNN as a source, r u dumb?
I work at Wal-Mart and I'm seeing less and less people working there. Pros, the bad employees get weeded out leaving customers with better ones but unfortunately also leaving them with less cashiers, people answering phones, help in the isles, etc. I see more and more self-check out lanes and more employees advertising online and grocery pick-up (unknowingly helping get rid of their jobs). It's quite interesting seeing the changes from the inside.... for now.
I like Flipkart
Walmart
So....Walmart
alphabeth>amazon
👍🏽Walmart online has come along way.

i really hate walmart.
Pff, easy. Publix.
Amazon doesn’t send me my groceries? So Walmart
How about Sams Club vs Costco?
I like Target better . Less crowded.
Canada vs North Korea
Walmart will vanquish.
I prefer Amazon cause they have kpop merch 😇💞❤
Meijer.
Amazon.
Trivago
Elon Musk didn't start paypal.

Cleveland A Smith is a better smith than Steven A.

Good job iguana man!  Lol! \nGod blessyou
@0:33 I request your assistance human! 😂😂😂 anyways, that was really an awesome thing for you to do old sport 😎
this is the best video ever lol
I love it!!! great job!!
We know y'all threw it in there then pretended to rescue it
I've seen that Iguana before, he's is in the book of world records.
That's freaking great although they are invasive species here in south Florida. I respect that would have done the same
happy to see ice poseidon safe and sound
I hate to rain on a heartwarming video, but green iguanas are not native to Florida and are considered an invasive species.
Any of this looks familiar to yah\nYeah in fact YEET
3:16 you can hear the iguana saying thanks for the ride Larry
Wholesome video and wholesome man, very good
HOW cool was that good on you brother.
Did the little guy a solid.
I went for a swim and hitchhicked a human jetboat on my way back, and I was on the internet. story to brag in front of his grandchildren.
That is so cool,and funny,wow!!
This made me smile, you're funny and a good person!
That was awesome, I love iguanas.\n\nWe had one when I was very little that we had to give to our friends pet store, he eventually grew to about 5ft from head to tail and became known around town as Godzilla.\nWe also had one later on named Iggy who eventually died, then another smaller one named Rocky who we used to walk on a little harness.
God save the Queen.
I could’ve sworn you were a white hillbilly till you turned the camera around
Hahah nice dude, and this iguana should find bait for you for the rest of his or her life haha.
This video has over 2.7 millions views and 41,500 likes on viralized right now. haha. Nice job steve
Awesome, Good stuff man! Also, sweet kayak setup, just got into kayak fishing myself lol
So iguanas dont make good fishing lures. All that time on top water n nun ate him WOW!
you're a good man.
Poor think was probably so tired
That was the most beautiful thing I've ever watched. He talked to it like a human😂
this dudes talking to an iguana, sitting in a kayak, 4 miles off the coast. what a strange video
Man that was incredible.  Looked like the iguana was actually aware of what was being said to it.  and it was not afraid of the engine running?  this video is more awesome than somebody claiming they saw and E.T. or some crap.
Put it on a hook and throw it back in guaranteed to catch a shark 😂
I love the narration 121 dislikes must be 121 people that shop at Walmart
Thats awesome! Thanks for saving the lil guy! poor dude was probably swimming for life
Thank you for being an A+ human being ! God Bless you !
People ya meet when you go fishing
I love a happy ending.  Looks like good place to find food and water.
Thanks for giving it a lift. I hope this inspires more people to help animals in need whenever in their power to do so
3:00 i swear whats that on the right.
this is how iguanas made it to the galapagos islands and evolved into a new species
I know a decent amount about animals but I don't know about iguanas was that a small Galapagos or am I no where near close? The kind that are in Florida?
The iguana was like, damn wtf is this human paddling in a boat doing 4 miles offshore?
That was the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long time, god bless you sir
Plot twist: after turning go pro  off, wonders what iguana would taste like, proceeds to capture iguana but iguana is too smart and had him for dinner instead. Legend has it that the iguana took human form after and is now running his youtube channel.
Sweet video “any of this look familiar to you.”\n😂
How could you not keep that thing? It was obviously meant to be
He wouldn’t have made it.  Even the sea iguanas in the Galapagos can only be in the water so long.
Thank  you for saving the wayward iguana.
That was sooo friekin cool. Good luck little guy.....
You are a good man for saving that poor guy!
Your vids are taking off!\n\nJust saw this same vid posted on Viralized via facebook by my lil cousin! 2.6M views!!!  Awesome.
Steve saw you on DODO you are truly famous now.
Like how he nodded animals are weird like that
Poor Lil iguana I bet he was tired as fuck
good work champion... u are the best.... poor iguanita,,... you do good work my brother
you fool! that was baby godzilla!!
YOU'RE an AWESOME person !!!!!!!!! Thanks for helping the little guy out!!!!
Hehe nice save. Iguana was probably very thankful for the ride home.
Thank you for saving him. I have one of my one
There should be more people like you
That’s awesome! Maybe a bird took him out there
It's Godzilla baby
My dude! Just saw the rescue again on the dodo, good looking out!
Good job man god bless you poor higuana should keep it for good luck
Awe man I thought you two were gonna be best buds and go on more fishing trips.
HEY STEAVE!!! Almost half million viewers in TWO DAYS!!!! WOWW!!!!!!\nCheers!!!

Love love love love this song!!!
That G5 is all I ever need. Damnnn...
You're right. This song IS the meaning of life
Love it! I still remember when I used to listen to Breakaway back in 4th grade. Kelly's music was one of the main reasons why I developed a passion for music. There was something about her style that just drew me in and inspired me use music a way to express myself. Now I'm working with my best friend as a music duo to create authentic music that really describes who we are. We are doing a live album project right now where we are releasing a song once a month. If you have a moment to check out our channel, we would really appreciate it! It's really insane how music can affect someone's life and I want to create music that has the same impact that Kelly had one me. Peace!
VOCALS.
OMG!! I don't think I'm the only one that feels this way..lol. WOW! FANTASTIC!
now THIS is kelly. <3
Give me goose bumps all the time!! AMAZING😍😍😍
why some people hate her???? bcuz of her weight FUCK u people.. shes awesome cant wait for the album
OMG, WOW!!! Kelly, the song, the band, the production are simply stunning here to say the least. Meaning of Life dropping October 27, 2017. I've pre-ordered and will also buy several physical copies for friends/family. Christmas you know.
Stunning... and the live version is even better... she is truly amazing!
On repeat... LOVE IT!!
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN!😍😍😍😍
Love it
Masterpiece!!!incredible
OMG QUEEN
Queeeeeeeen, amazing aah 🙌🏻😻❤️
I got goosebumps everytime i play this song...the best ever... I just cant wait for new album
I'm living for Kelly's new music. ❤
Oh yeah! The beats and the lyrics are just 😍👏
This is like the 100th time listening to this song. IT'S SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!
She is absolutely killing it with these new songs. The vocals are just untouchable. Jesus. I can’t wait for the album.
Kelly is churning out the soul. This is magnificent. Blow up big girl.
Omg love this song her vocal are so strong I think this will be her best to date
What the fucks wrong with the views? is youtube trippin'? she definitely deserves more than 30,000 views!
Life is like a pigeon, crapping on your heart.
what the f, why isnt this song on the radio?????? I like this song better than the other one on the radio.  No offense but i just dont like that one segment where you sing monotone
Love this! Real talent. Real voice. Just pure talent and soul! Love you Kelly😘
First Kelly Clarkson and then Avril Lavigne... 2018 will be awesome !
Oh I thought this was an old song
I'm in tears of happiness. Kelly, if I had to chose a song to describe my relationship with my boyfriend, THIS IS IT! I've struggled with severe social anxiety, since I was a kid. I'm 21 now. When my boyfriend came around, I pushed him away, since I wasn't used to receiving kindness. He was always patient, and kind, he showed me unconditional love since day 1. He always shows me love, and lifts me up when I start to have anxiety or self doubt.
search the title of this song on Google
Can we give her a GRAMMY already?
This song slayyyyyy big time... This need more views ^_^
Yet another piece of pure art.  Love this talented gem!
Surely this a grammy award song x
We already know whos gonna get all the Grammys at home.
show to the newbies the new crappy singers of today what is real singing
Please take a moment to pay tribute to those who suffered so much on Oct 1st in Las Vegas.  This video will tug at your heart and bring a tear of happiness to your life.  youtube.com/watch?v=dlQTUVlXFLY
Great performance...Kind of reminds me of Josh Stone  : )
That high note at 3:03 gave me life. slay me baby <3
My new favorite song. Can’t wait for release 😄
This is a GREAT song, very haunting and unforgettable.
Everything about this song screams Kelly Clarkson.  Her life and loves and this song are mirror metaphors for one another.  The song is Kellys love and happiness radiating thru her art.  It's raw and real and what we all want.
You don't have a soul if you don't like this song... I mean come on! THIS IS LEGIT!!! Kelly my girl... whatever does people says... YOU'RE THE BEST!!!
wow Hitler was right about the jews
Another amazing song from my favourite singer! <3
Hey guys I'm trying to be the next Kelly Clarkson (in her honor) and if I could get a quick like, comment, subscribe, favorite, follow, retweet, revine, facetime, and kickstarter donation from each of you that would be dank FAM. \n\nSeriously, I've been trying for years my dudes. In fact, I remember when I was 7 years old, my daddy told me go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely\n\nIt was a great big world but we thought we were bigger, pushing each other to the limits we were learning quicker. By 11 drinking herb and smoking burning liquor. But seriously guys I'm on Spotify if you could give me a follow I'll love you have a great day <3
Ive never heard a more powerful song. This song brought me to tears in the middle of my shift hearing it the first time... Its like she got inside my head and wrote a song about how i feel about my life/wife! Thank you so so much kelly! You are amazing girl!!!!
*now this is real talent.*
Many old artist are coming back because they realize there is too much crap being called music and lyrics. Many more should come back! This song is beautiful!
Another awesome song off an album not yet out.  Killer.
Essa música tem que ser um grande sucesso!! Por Favor!! Que Musicão, tudo perfeito!!
I know this is over dramatic but OMG I'm crying right now! This is the type of music my soul craves for! I'm so beyond musically fulfilled right now!
Thank you God, we were all in need of a good album in the midst of so many crap.
big love for you kelly
Epicgasmically amazing! I can't wait to hear the rest of the songs!
I love this so much❤️❤️
Thumbs up, sounds old school. Guess that is why I like it.
The beat kind of threw me off at first but wow *applause*
Kelly i would have kild myself without you
17 seconds in and I love it already!! Can't wait for the rest of the album 😁

living like a flopping washed up fatty can be so tough
The album is falling short. I still think Breakaway was her best album. My favorite song was Behind These Hazel Eyes.
YouTube will throw anything on trending these days...
Kelly's meaning of life is shoving food down her gullet
Why is she not using her vevo account anymore? haha just wondering
Lol she is still fat.
This is not good.
Lose some weight before creating a album

Lily ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Missing you Lily! ☹️
Lily looks so cheerful 😀
Missing Lilly!!!! 😏
LILYYY!
loved seeing lily!
loveee you two together!
I miss Lily 😔
I really like this type of video, Anna. Do more of this! 😊
We slept like logs, except for the time that I woke up and I thought I was in a sauna. lmaooooo
So great to see the two of you together, you make me smile and laugh out loud. You give off such positive energy. I have missed watching your channel Lily, have a great break
Please please please do a review on The Ordinary Foundation !! I'm so intrigued and ready to buy but want to know how the colour matches up as I'm buying online !! Loved the video, miss you Lily xx
I felt like I was on holiday too! ...from the comfort of my couch while I procrastinate from writing a paper for UNI. Lovely vlog though, couple and friends time super sweet and v relatable. Nice to see parts of London too. Lily seems/looks light and happy, she should take all the time off she needs to refresh/reset, her fans aren't going anywhere :) xx
Miss you Lily!!! Great video Anna : ) x
Loved this - makes me miss London!
Lovely to see Lily's face xx
Definitely go see Lily and Rich more! So nice to see you all together.
I moved from South London to Cornwall 5 weeks ago and the noise of Southern Rail trains has brought back so many memories, both good and bad ahahah!!  Loved this vlog xx
Check out Ryan Forrest Composer for epic piano music!\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fiXVKc5zLjE\n*this guy's so underrated!*
how I wish I live in London
Squatting when you wear jeans is actually a great idea tho
Great vlog! Missing you lily but it looks like you're having a well needed rest! Love the fact you were doing a mini haul in this haha!
China Town!!!  😆 I miss the food there
You guys seem so happy, im really happy for lily if she feels a break is helping her, i think you guys are so great together
lovely to see lily! your double dates are always fun to watch xx
Yai!! Anna & lily. Love these vlogs. I missed lily so happy to see her. Love you Anna.
Your friendship is a lovely thing in a world full of not lovely things.
Hi Lily, uhmmm can you come back to YouTube now?!? LOL
Ooh I read about the Gingerline only a few weeks ago as I’m heading to London soon.  It looks great but sadly it’s only for over 18s and I’ll have my 16 yr old daughter on this trip.  I love This Works extreme moisturiser for winter.  I find that brand really good but it doesn’t get too much interest here in Australia. Their pillow spray really does seem to work.
Don't speak. wow. one of my favourite songs.
Lovely vlog- the two couples together is always a good time! Nice to see Lily! I want to try that foundation also!!
I could watch your vlogs all day!
Around 3.50 I paused the video as my 12 year old walked in and asked me something.  When I got to hit play again, all we could hear was when he farts!  My daughter was cracking up!  The best breaks are the ones that feel like you've been away for ages and like you've been on holiday!
y'all are cute.  looks so fun!
I loved this! I missed Lily, I missed the couple vlogs, I missed the London weekend activities. This filled so many voids I didn't know I had!! xx
Wish The Ordinary would launch here
Ahhhh I miss Lily! This was a nice vlog, you all are so funny together! It’s a shame you don’t get on very well 😂
Looks like you guys had a fun weekend! Just adore you two! So funny, boys are shopping and you two are tagging along... Love it!
You are such a joy!
So glad to see you two together and Lily looking so happy ❤️ can’t wait for her to come back!
Lily seems so happy - happier than she has in a very long time. The break is obviously doing her a lot of good x
i want lily's coat  , great vlog xx
Half watching this just to get a lily fix  🙈 obviously so much love for anna too ❤️
did viewers really think Lily was preggers... never crossed my mind.  but i knew she wouldn't be away too long from youtube...  i saw someone w Lily's coat the other day :)
Great vlog, looks like you had fun!! x
Always lush to c u hanging out together guys♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ahh nice to see lily! Great vlog Anna x
MISS YOU LILY! Hope you all are doing well :)
So good to see Lily.  Glad she is ok.. Great video!
Totally loved this vlog ❤ So nice to get some tips for our next trip to London 😃
Thanks for taking us along, Anna! It was lovely :-)
where is lilys white shirt from??
How lovely to see Lily. The time off is suiting her, looking happy and relaxed. Come back soon!
Love when you four hang out together (even though it doesn't affect me at all lol)
Lilyyyyyy i miss youuuuuuu it madré me so happy to see your precious face
I miss Lily so much :( Great video as always xxx
Great to see Lily again. She really looks like she is enjoying her little screen break.
This vlog is so amazing! Love it so much 💕
This is exactly why I LOVE being on YouTube - the friendships you can make xx
I miss Lily so so much! It's taken up til now to realise why YouTube isn't the same, and its cause my sub box is lily'less *cries* But she is SO happy, can see it in her face, happiest she has looked in a long time, so if this is what she needed then fab! I just hope she isn't gonna come back unless she actually wants to!
Loved this mini vlog! I really want to stay at The Hoxton , looks so cool. I must buy that foundation at some point. 💪🏻
Aw its so nice to see Lily again, definitely missing her videos! xxx
Can’t wait for a review of the ordinary foundations!!
Using my the ordinary foundation while watching this....
I rarely (if ever) comment on videos, but this was so lovely I can't resist! I love how relaxed and authentic this vlog feels, a pleasure to watch. xx
I miss Lily so much!
What is this bs
OMG!! NO2 ON TRENDING! 😱 you go girls! 💪 Missed seeing both of you in a vlog 💓
Could you do a review of the ordinary foundations you purchased? Quite curious. Love the vlog!!
So nice to see Lily again 😉 Great vlog!
This was the perfect little vlog to watch on my lunch break! Was lovely to see Lily happy too.
Lovely vlog Anna! And so nice to get a glimpse of Lily again. You are more then welcome back to youtube/internet when/if you feel ready for it @lilypebbles ❤
I stayed at the Hoxton in London and it was awesome! The lobby is like a collaborate workspace in the day and a nightclub at night! It was crazy. They also give free breakfast every morning
Not only do we get Mark, but Lily and Rich! 💙💚💛💜
Your handsome husband, irons!!! Love him, even more!! I always look forward to when you and Lillie do a video together!!
Paused the video to comment and say HOW MUCH DO WE MISS Lily??!!! But also let’s note how happy and refreshed she looks. Take however long you need Lily but come back to us soonish... thanks for this great video Anna. I smiled thorough out the entire vlog!
Absolutely love this video! Do they sell all of the 'The Ordinary' skin care range at the deciem store? I really want to try it out, but I am not the biggest fan of shopping skin care online. \nx \nOne happy subscriber
How the fuck is this #2 trending?
Why are you trending ?
hoes
I don't understand why youtubers all buy the same clothes as each other. A minute ago they were all spending £500 on gucci loafers so they could look the same and now apparently tartan jackets are the thing. And for some reason English people seem to keep calling that pattern check or plaid. It's so uninspiring when everyone is buying the same clothes and no one seems to have their own style.
Pls pls follow Kris Aquino!! Her youtube chanel is  @Theaquinos, shes very famous  celebrity in the philippines and she likes and watches your videos!! She acknowledged you in one of her videos. Thanks :)
How does bullshit like this kind of vlog even begin to trend ?
Worst attitude=the bitch Demarcus cousins smfh 
Not gonna lie thought he said boner support
What if the offense makes a quick move so no time to say defence
I thought he would say lonzo at one
I thought his dream team was gonna be him and his sons
Larry Bird at 3 😂💀 what a joke
If offense is fast than that means the other teams defense is also fast
I want Ramsay Bolton do what he did to Theon on this fucking retard.
If it’s Nappy is happy lol
Lol. Lavar is the Goat!! Hands down!!
If it's nappy, you happy lol
I like this guy
Um... if offense is that fast wouldn’t defense be just as fast??? Two teams 😂??
I thought he would put Lonzo in his all time starting 5
Thought he was gonna say lonzo ball at the 1
Is this secretly Keegan Michael Key?
Why do people hate this guy he’s seems like a cool dad
Lavars top five is on point
Which one of your sons bad haircuts were you talking about?
Fr thought he was gonna say he was on the dream team
HABS is a nickname given the Montreal Canadiens, a hockey team.
Anyone else or just me notice Dennis Smith Jr??? aka the best rookie..
When he was answering the dream team question I thought he was going to name himself his sons and Magic Johnson lol 😂
I came into this video thinking every answer would be lonzo
This may be the worst thing to have happened to basketball.\nIt's like kardashians tried to get into basketball by changing their name to ball.
this was surprisingly good
who has the worst NBA hair,Lavar ball don't got hair 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
He should have his own talk show.
Wow, he was actually pretty fun and chill... I like this side of Lavar.
Offense is spontaneous but defense is for a long time? This mother fucker retarded
I used to hate this guy. I don't agree with some of the things he says or does. But he's an alright guy.
I love Lavar he's got a great energetic personality going for him
2:05 Not gonna answer that question cuz I don't look at guy's facial hair.\n-Lavar Ball\n\n So do you look at women's facial hair??
I like he’s positivity a very supportive dad. Minus that Jordan thing he alright.
If u saying Jordan one of the best u ain’t in the best then how does ur statement make sense “I’m better then Jordan”bruh get yo head straight bitch
Offense is EXACTLY as long as defense, just an FYI.
AT LEAST SOMEONE PUTS SOME REPECT ON BIRDS NAME, FUCK LEBRICK
I’m surprised that he didn’t put Lonzo in his top 5
Lavar is godly sumbody put this man in the nba hall of fame
God, I want to hate him. but i just cant
Lavar seems like a cool dude to have a beer with.
Wait what lonzo not at the 2 ?
We all know thats an apple mac
Laver is the go to goat
You earned a like when he said “welcome to Krispy kreame donuts😂😂😂”
Lmaooooooooooo Lavar got jokes and he’s lowkey educated about the nba
I thought the top 5, 3 of them would be his sons
The one about the draft suits😂😂😂😂
That defense offense chant shit was dumb. The offense is spontaneous but defense can go on for a while? Defense reacts to offense. It's gonna be just as spontaneous
Lmao that hair where it looks like you just woke up my son has it too haha😂😂😂lavar is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m a little surprised he didn’t pick Lonzo for his dream team...
The way he said staple center 😂😂
I am waiting for the next episode of ball in the family
He’s so funny 😂
this made me like Lavar a whole lot more 😂
The d and offence is on both sides. So that makes no sence
Nappy is happy I’m sleep 😴😭
Thinking about it Lavar is probably the coolest guy in the NBA
He actually appears sane in this video, why can't he do this all the time???
Cocaine is one hell of a drug.
Did no one ask how offense is spontaneous but defense us slow, because that makes no sense
How does he not know what the Habs are
Did he just say magic is better then Jordan bruh
Most of the time he didn't even answer the questions
Lavar=🐐
REMON! HAHAHAHAHA WTF
Ron artest / metta world piece for attitude
Fuck nah turquoise suit aint have shit on that long ass (priest/agent 47) suit boi gtfo
GOAT
he pronounced Ramon as RAYMOON LMAOOOOOO
Welcome to Krispy Kreme Donuts
Lavar is just walking reklam
Lavar GOAT
Offended..
I surprisingly enjoyed this
He can read!?
Liked before I watched
BigSexy
Hey guys wanna hear a joke \n\n\n\n\n\nBIG BALLSACK BRAND
BBB
At 5:09 he shouldve said buy BBB shoes
Why this nigga famous 🤦🏽‍♂️
Lavar got one brown tooth
*this is funny*
Lonzo is trash.
Who else remembers Lavar destroying MJ 1v1?
AYYYYYY TIMMY DUNCAN
Lavars shit
Is lil dicky your son?
3BB = 3 PPG. New logo!
this negro said welcome to krispy kreme donuts
Role model father tbh

Questions were fucking trash
Korver got the best hair
Lavar balls have really grown
Welcome to crispy Kreme donuts😂😂😂😂 I'm dead
5:47 had me dead😂😂
This is amazing.  Love how connected Grohl is with the fans.  Pierce kicked ass too, talk about a dream come true
I was there last night with my wife. I saw you holding the sign all night but had no idea what it said. You rocked it. Was my favorite part of the night! Congratulation!
You did great man, that concert was siiiick. GO GAMECOCKS!!!
This is so FUCKING sweet, in every possible sense of the word.
Wtg, Pierce. This world doesn't deserve Dave Grohl, but what a time to be the fuck alive
Dream maker Dave, making dreams come true one fan at a time! He probably just changed this guy's life!
Pierce rocked it out!  What a cool moment at a very cool show!
I was there last night .Pierce killed it.It was awesome
I had a sign for Pearl Jam wanting to play drums with them 19 years ago.  They were less receptive.
Hey there! This is Ian Cross, the Digital Content Manager at WMBF News in Myrtle Beach, SC. Do we have your permission to use this video on air and online?
Holy shit!
Dave Grohl is *THE PHUCKING MAN* FOR letting kid rip like that..Gift of a life time!!!! +10,000 karma points....
Hey @wpoteet! My name is Kayla Binette & I work with WLTX, a TV station in Columbia, SC. I just interviewed Pierce Edge about his performance with the Foo Fighters. Would it be okay if I use your video? We will give you a courtesy.
That was awesome!!! What kind of shirt Pierce had on??? I couldn’t tell what is was.
when a fan realizes the dream that every fan has had a day. Well done!
So staged, but cool.
Damn son. You lucky bastard.
WOW
Way cool
Also, idk if you would be up for including this on your channel but it would be fun to see some cooking videos since you're so into it right now!
Love from Denmark❤️🇩🇰 Your video was really hyggelig
I think its great that you did this video! you should definitely do more books hauls because I'm always looking for new reads! #BookwormsUnite
My workmate and I were talking about eating vegetarian the other and how it makes you feel so much lighter. That totally made sense to me!
glad to know that you're interested in cooking Rendang! it's a traditional from my home country, Indonesia :)
I saw the Eat Beautiful book in a store the other day and was very disappointed to see so much dairy in it... i mean, dairy is just terrible for your skin. 😓 More like Eat to get pimples.😳
It makes me so happy that you´re so into Scandinavia and especially Denmark, because thats where I live. Please visit Copenhagen and if you´re into nature and small cozy islands you/ your family you need to visit Bornholm in Denmark. I love your videos and it makes Me so proud of my small country when youtubers like you, from Britan or USA is inspired to visit. Sorry for my english, im just so happy that you want to visit us at some point. ❤️
Love from Denmark. Do you have a crush on us? 🇩🇰✌️
I love that you’re so into Scandinavia/Denmark! Whenever you book a trip to CPH and you need help to what to see/do etc, then pls DM me - I’ve lived there for ten years and while studying I was working at the tourist information! :) I’m Sanneproi on instagram
I love all of these danish mentions (im from denmark!!) AND I just got eat beautiful too!
Hello! I am doing a campaign to collect money, to give books to children who can not buy, so here is the link https://igg.me/at/d2EpHGl7zvQ if you can not donate, share it with your friends and family, this will make the children very happy, the donation is $ 9 dollars onwards, thanks for your collaboration.
Love this video idea!
I love books and candles :)
You should try woodwick candles, they're gorgeous, smell amazing and they crackle while they burn like a real fire! They are unbelievably relaxing!
if you come to Denmark, please have a meet & greet :D pretty please! would love to say hi to you guys. you are the cutest ting, the way you explain things is just too much <3 I am quite the same when I explain...but can`t really express it properly into words. I feel like you are also a very humble & grateful person which I love so much in a person. hope to see you in Copenhagen :)
I love how ready, player one takes place in Columbus, OH, USA which is where Im from lol
Yes! I'm so with you on bookshops! Loved the video and can't wait to hear about more books you love!
Bookstores are amazing! We have one by us that I could just spend my life in there!
This video was soooo relaxing and cozy to watch :))
Come to Denmark, we'd love to have you visit us! 😁👌🏻
Now I want to get more books. We're going to have a book case in our living room so might as well. Might purchase some of the ones you have there.
Do you eat a lot of Guyanese food? Would be fun to see you do a cooking video on it 😊 have been watching you for years now (I consider you one of the OG youtubers😂) and I like how you’ve adapted while staying down to earth. Reminds me of the simple times when YouTube wasn’t so much of a money making machine xxx
I desperately want to go to Copenhagen too! PS, your hair looks absolutely stunning! TOTAL BEAUT! xxx
Rendang is delicious! My mom makes the most perfect one
Ready Player One is a book that my husband read and told me that I HAD to read.  I think I love it for the same reason you do.  It really is immersive! This video makes me want to search out a bunch of books to order!
I LOVE this video!!!  What a dream- books and candles.  <3 You are the greatest :)
Love videos like this, Sam! You have some awesome picks there 😊 If you're ever looking for some similar-ish book recommendations, I have a bookstagram that I just started! It's called LevinesReads. Not trying to plug, just trying to share some resources! ❤️
I can lost in a bookshop for hours and not realise the time..
My plants are my therapy... its very grounding taking care of them. I have 2 that are 15years old.. I got them when my Mom died..and just nurturing & watching them grow helped me through grief. I now take cuttings and give them to my friends 😊🌱🌿 x
This was so cute - I really loved this video. I always get more into cooking around this time of year so can't wait to take a peak at some of these cookbooks.
LOVED this video! Beautiful books, yes! Thanks for sharing.♡
OMG Yassss Ready Player One! It really is immersive! I hope they do the film justice. Love ya Sammi xx
Please DO come to Copenhagen - it would be so cool !\nYou should do a family trip in December if you wanna experience some real Hygge and Lykke ;-)
Haha, that is kind of nice to hear someone obsessed about Copenhagen and Scandinavia :) It's easy taking it for granted when you live here. I'm obsessed about London and go every year! 'Lykke' is Happiness :)
your videos have been FANTASTIC lately :)
I love Ready Player One!! Keep doing these hauls I love them :)
If you're into Indian culture, I recommend you read Shantaram :) xx
This is off topic, but I want bangs now. Also, I read The life changing magic of tidying, but I'm not tidy at all.. I am good at tossing things I don't need, and folding my clothes, but I'm still a clusterfuck. Loved the video!
Can't wait til ready player one comes out in film. Read the book a couple of years ago, loved it.
I really appreciate your love for our little country Denmark! It's very rare that I hear our country being mentioned, so thank you <3 Everytime you buy books or clothes from danish brands (like Gestuz, Ganni ect.) I get so happy and excited! When you are going to Denmark one day, try to visit Aarhus as well! Aarhus is the european capital of culture and the city is absolutely beautiful. \n\nOh and the book you got called Lykke means happiness. It's also my middle name, haha!
I love that we have a very similar taste in books. Half of them i have, the other half is on my wishlist. :)
Please visit Copenhagen! I live here and it's such a nice city!
Cozy video💛 Thank you for sharing, the books are so interesting!
Ur cardigan is awesome .... where did u get it love?
love the books and plants! more videos like this 🙌
ugh god the dog eared pages kill me
love your cookbook haul!! i got so many inspiration from this video, thank you!
Can you do a video about the makeup and hair of this video please?😭❤️
Great video! A video of your style books and cookbooks collection would be 👌🏻
You are actually very good at styling your HOME as well // I always love the pieces you pick out and how you put a room together!
I've had Fresh India by Meera Sodha for a while now and the food is incredible. A lot of the recipes use the same ingredients over and over again so it gradually becomes quite cheap food to make after your first bulk buy. I would 100% recommend to anyone who is thinking of getting it! \n\nAlso, whilst I'm here - does anyone have any other amazing vegetarian cookbooks they'd recommend?
For plants, check out “What’s Wrong with my House Plant” by David Deardorff and Kathryn Wadsworth
Don't wanna be a party pooper but the last two candle brands are ridiculously expensive for a scent that can be duplicated by any other brand. It's like Tom Ford lipsticks; the aesthetic of the brand is lovely but it's not like you're buying a couch, it's something that will run out soon... I personally love my ZARA Home and H&M Home candles (some secret ones that only exist in-store are the best ones!) as well as any other random brand!!! Truth be told I'm very picky and stingy when it comes to candles lol
Glad to know I'm not the only one obsessed with candles 😊
The Urban Jungle book sounds and looks amazing Sammi. I need to get it asap lol!
Ready Player One was SO GOOD! If you like it then I have a few recommendations!\n Anything that Neil Gaiman has written is great, Neverwhere Anansi Boys and American Gods are 3 of my favorites.\nCarry On by Rainbow Rowell is a spin on Harry Potter and it is GREAT!\nAnd then on the power women note Roxanne Gay has a couple out that are very good Bad Feminist and Difficult Women are faves. Shrill- Notes from a Loud Woman by Lindy West was funny and enjoyable and anything Chimamanda Adichie writes is gold. \n\nThat was a lot but I love audio books, I challenged myself to finish 50 books this year, currently on number 35 so I have a lot of suggestions lol. This was a great video! I love your fashion content but this was a lovely switch up.
Yes please more video.
I really enjoyed this video! I love books & candles. Especially cookbooks & home decor, plants etc. I recently found a great cookbook. ( 'Oh she glows every day' By Angela Liddon. You would love this book. Thanks for sharing. 🥑
I'm an English teacher so loveeee that you are representing the book worms!👐
I was just as obsessed as you are and I learned a little bit of danish during 4 years of fandom, and then i got to live there for a year. I'm an expert, ask me anything. hahah PLEASE GO
What’s time secret to have a healthy relationship? Like my boyfriend and I have don’t together for a year and 8 months... and there are times I feel fuckin frustrated when I tell my point across. I do understand where he’s coming from.. but I’m trying to get my point across without sounding like a bitch... and how can we make time for each other? Btw I love your videos!! ❤️
I love this idea!! Two of my favourite things
Love going into bookstores. Currently reading Child 44- Tom Rob Smith (crime/thriller, set in Russia during and post Stalin's regime), easy to read, fast pace flow and gripping storyline. What I would say about this book is that the main crimes that are told through the story can be upsetting for some. \n\nI've read the book The life changing magic of tidying and the way she spoke about objects as if they had their own life and purpose like a little human, how all the items should be treated with respect with each use and to be placed back correctly.
Hi Sam.. can you do a what i eat in a day video.. would love to see what u've been eating lately from those interesting cook books
Books and candles are my obsession! Too bad you didn't have more psychological thriller buys I need some new recommendations! 😊
i just came to listen to your voice lol, loooove your accent!! that kondo book is a life saver!!
Absolutely loved this! I am reading Greatest Hits by Laura Barnett and loving it, her first book is wonderful too! xxx
I love it. Please make more videos like this. # bookworms United.
Please come to Copenhagen! I live in Denmark and looveeeeee you. I have followed you for years and years and i would be so cool to see you visit the country where I am from!
I love this video. One can clearly see that you enjoyed filming it.\n\nThank you 🤗
I feel the same way about bookstores. I can honestly roam around a bookstore for hours, even if I don't buy a book. Being surrounded by books is the best feeling!
There's going to be a ready player one movie next year BTW!! Let us know how the book is! Also any interest in doing a book club?
Feeling different when not eating meat isn't strange at all Sam :) i felt such an huge difference in my health and daily well being, that i would never believe it if didn't experienced it myself.\n\nDo your own research if you are interested and if you need some help with that just say... It can change your and your family well being sooooo much.\nLots of love
The little girl in eat veggies looks like indie, it's always nice to watch you and I don't like watching your videos in a rush if it makes sense, I like to do it when I have time with a drink or a meal, just love listening to your and how clearly you do this because you love making videos, not because you want views.\n\nEither way, we'll support you I'm sure with either type of videos, we just like you
I have 2 plants that have been with me for about a year now and I love them like they're my children! Every time a leaf grows I get so excited and I talk/sing to them too. I definitely want a book about plants so I can get more and more !
Love when you do vids for books cause I feel like I share a similar book interest with you so it’s a reliable recommendation for sure! But if recommend to you “brain on fire” and I just finished “into the water” by the author that wrote girl on the train. Two really great books!
So great to hear, that you're enjoying a more plant-based diet! Have you watched 'What the Health' on Netflix? It shows in a lot of detail how much healthier and better it is for us to not eat animal products. Absolutely changed my life and I totally get what you mean by 'feeling lighter' 😊👌
Sammi! You NEED to try ottolenghi's cookbooks, he barely uses meat and has a restaurant in Notting Hill, I believe. Everything is so easy and so delicious. I think you'll love him/his books and food.
I absolutely love bookshops too!! I used to go to a bookshop in a small town near me and have a lovely coffee and cake and read!! It also has a record shop next door so would have a nose at vinyl!! Would be good to see if anyone could do some recommendations of places to go to have a lovely coffee and read xx
If you go to copenhagen (which you really should! It is a truly lovley place), you should also pop into Malmö in Sweden over the day! The train over only takes 30 minutes and it's a real gem! 👌🏼
Can you do more book and food videos
I'm not vegan or vegetarian but I have also been trying to include more plant based foods in my diet and cut down on my meat, and would recommend The Plantiful Table by Andrea Duclos
I am very interested in the Ready Player One, I'll definitely be checking that book out! :)
Loved this video
Hey Sammi, I'd really recommend L'art de la Simplicité by Dominique Loreau (it's in English!), it's also about decluttering your home, beauty and health. Could you please do a video on your plants? I've also really gotten into plants recently and really want to know what the plant behind you is called!
Ah so much inspiration in this video... adding practically everything to my shopping list!
🖤🖤🖤🖤
The autumnal vibes 😊
❤️📚 and candles!\nThanks for sharing:)
Omg YES! Please come to Copenhagen!❤
Cooking video please! Love bookstores:)
PF. Candle Co is the besttttttttt soy candles! Teakwood & Tobacco aaf <3
This was lovely ❤️
Love the hair. Love the lipstick. Love the cardigan. Love the background. 😍😍
You reeeeally need to stop buying paper books! They're so bad for the environment. Especially because you have a Kindle already...
sammy please address why you're not going vegan. i've loved you for years but i really don't understand this - i feel like even if you just took the time to explain why you're not doing it would be a big improvement that just avoiding the elephant in the room. please don't take this as hate - i love you and that's why i've been thinking so much about this!
You were right the first time! Eau is pronounced oh not ooh :)
Love books too. Hair looks great today!
the way she pronounces hygge 😂
If you are in love with Denmark, you really have to read The Little Book of Hygge, by Meik Wiking. You will want to move country straight away! :)
Is it just me or does Ben look more and more like Allen Ginsberg each day? ;)
I am in love with the goth girl with a chain connected to her piercing !! ❤️
A verse with 1 note repeated? Absurd.
OMG IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS AND THIS IS SO POETICALLY AND AESTHETICALLY PLEASING IM SO HAPPY
I heard this live at Mamby On the Beach in Chicago, and now being able to listen to it over and over and over again, i couldn't be happier, I am SO looking forward to this album. Its gunna be amazing. AND not only did this drop, but King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard released a new song and video the same day this was released!!
While this song is good in its own right, I still long for something as good and as beautiful as oracular spectacular, nothing since then has struck the same chord with me and next to each other each album could be from different artists. I'm hoping other tracks may live up to my hopes and dreams, but only time will tell. Still a great fucking song.
y'all deadass just threw Connan Mockasin in the video....THANK YOU
Who’s that girl
The goth chick playing in the band is crazy hot lol
Who's the girl sitting on Andrew?!
Feel like mgmt make new history for melody and music I don't feel it's new song or album its call new vibe for music industry
Oh SHit! on some 80s shit! I fuck with it! They should link up with Future Nino!
Big takeaway from this video is that fruit is the root of all evil
Is that Stu from King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard at 0:56?
who is the emo girl?
I want to hear this done in a old Count Dracula voice.\n\nFor even more *NOSTALGIA*
This has the signature of the cure
Please more strange theater...grew up listening to Alice Cooper , digging this.
getting some soft cell feels from this
DAMMIT! THAT IS NOT HOW YOU EAT A POMEGRANATE!!!
nice music video, lyric and music.
is that the vocalist of king gizzard?
the video kinda reminds me of my band https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoIzCgSjv1w
Is that woman with the whip part of the band now? She was playing the keyboard. What's her name?
Song meaning dont trust anyone even that guy who plays with magic
Now is this just a single or is this going to be a full-fledged album
The apple of knowledge
I wish I could know the meaning of every scene! That has called my attention... although I freaking love the song!\nAnyone? What would be your interpretation on this video?
Sounds like Alphaville's Big in Japan without a strong hook.
Can't stop watching \nwonderful
Hello my little dark age
Holy shit!  Is MGMT post-punk goth now!?  God I hope so!  Good stuff.
I need to know who is this woman 4:40 Its sooo beautiful
Is he referencing Robert Smith?
YES this is awesome slap me and call me Sally
This was like seeing an episode of the German/Canadian sci-fi LEXX.
I feel like I'm watching something my mum use to listen to back when she was in her teen emo phase in the 80s.
THIS IS GOLD. MGMT ARE BACK AGAIN
Imma tell Robert Smith ya'll stole his look
they will forever be one of my fav bands. I fuck with their music and videos so muchhhh
I want to like MGMT.  After all, they're from Connecticut.  But I just can't be a fan of a band I can't even spell.
his hair reminds me of the cure
Aye they performed this in vegas at LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL hell yeah <3
Sounds like early the cure
3 days is way too long for this video to reach 1 million views
That was some good simulacra
God damn, this reminds me of fruit ninja!
this is a trailer for the new Fruit Ninja game right?
My favourite band is back 😃😃😃😃
An Ian Fletcher from W1A Right for this
Cannot wait for the rest of the album 👍🏼
i missed them so fucking much, i'm loving the nostalgic vibes this song radiates
This is a lot like The Cure and I’m not complaining
Finally a new song that can be used as a theme for Halloween.
great song, lovin the vocal treatment
I'm cry no lie 😩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just in time for the midterm struggle!
To the people who have been complaining about how MGMT changed and everything after Oracular Spectacular sucked, it's been a decade. Bands evolve.
WARNING Can't Be Unheard: MY LITTLE DOG CAGE

So good , amazing song and video ! Cant wait for the new album
That music always plays when two stars collide, its a fundamental rule of physics
I like how they had cameras there to capture it.
This my son, is how gingers are born....
Us kiwis like our stars
and there is that guy \nwho still believes that the earth is flat
How is this trending??
I'm so confused.. are we gonna die or nah?
the alien ship I went on had stuff like this to keep humans entertained.
Why isn't this my screensaver??
I wonder if it sprouted out a sperm and an egg to form an animal that will soon evolve into a humanlike species??
Slow the settings down to 0.5 or 0.25 looks cool !
Is space related to science?
😮 woooohhh. animation 😒🙅‍♂️
*2045 fidget spinner*
I'll take your word for it.
A brave cameraman out there in indeed.
What's this music?
Some stars burn out and die, bigger stars burn out and die with *passion*
*9 + 10 = 21*
Disney animate too...what's the point?
So if I spin two round balls and when they collide, earth will be destroyed under the sheer impact?
And why is this trending?
think how many planets likely just vanished during this event.
The new sneak peak trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3
I wonder if god farted or burped and it made this happen
Would those colours actually be there if this event happened in real life?
Does this happen when im having sex?

O LOOK 2 NEUTRON STARS LET'S MAKE AN E X P L O S I O N  - god 2017
While most people worry about where the heavy elements originate from, relativity is no longer just a theory. It is now observed. We have many observations of time dilation due to gravity and now we can confirm having observed distance dilation due to gravity and only just now having been validated by the visible light of a kilanova. Relativity is here to stay. It's not just a theory anymore. Relativity is science fact.\n\nEnquanto a maioria das pessoas se preocupa de onde os elementos pesados ​​se originam, a relatividade não é mais apenas uma teoria. Agora é observado. Temos muitas observações de dilatação do tempo devido à gravidade e agora podemos confirmar ter observado a dilatação da distância devido à gravidade e apenas agora já foi validado pela luz visível de um kilanova. A relatividade está aqui para ficar. Não é mais uma teoria. A relatividade é um fato científico.
If we where gonna die the burst would have been toward us , we wouldn't have been able to see the stripes
Would be much better with Hans Zimmer interstellar soundtrack for sure.
Who thought this was about that strange orange glow in england a couple days ago
since the two black holes last year, lost a significant amount of mass, due to producing so huge an amount of gravity wave distortion universe wide. several solar masses of energy was lost. the question, and I may have to figure it out myself, is, how much mass, over this length of time, 200 miles wide, was lost here. this would reduce the equation of state, because the end result may be much less than the 2.1 solar mass neutron star already seen.
Watch this while listening to Neutron Star Collision by Muse
And that's how babies are made.
What dose the mean anyone?
I can already see this being used for shitty earrape  memes
I knew that would happen........😂
gravitational waves were first predicted by Professor Albert Einstein.
They should have got Zack Snyder to direct this and Hans Zimmer to score it.
This is clearly a fidget spinner because the earth is flat
This is the work of the sailor senshi

I recall Brian Cox  theorising that the energy produced from this collision will scorch the earth, and that’s how the world will end
No coments saying this is about god?
NASA is my space station
Have we entered a new era? An era of light and gravitational waves... An era of neutrons stars. Something we can now see that we couldn't detect before
*is there anything more beautiful in the world than this?*
Why are people so excited over this speculative simulation. Relax it is not real.
I don't believe gravitation waves travel at the speed of light... If they did the entire mass of the universe would be in constant collapse right after the big bang but studies prove this isn't the case...
Shitty video. Quartz did a better ome on the subject lol
Can someone explain to me how they just happened to find this when it's 130 million light years away? 130 million light years means it happened 130 million years ago. So they just got super super ultra ridiculously unbelievable unfathomably rarely lucky to find this event that took an earth week to happen but occurred 130 million years ago 130 million light years away and NASA just so happened to have multiple instruments all pointed at the exact same event even though they did not the know about what it was until after they got the radiation and light measurements. Can anyone explain that?
It’s pretty cool we got a talk from the people who detected it a week before
Question, Animation shows each neutron star releasing gravitational ways before the merger, how is this possible? Aren't gravitational waves only released after the merger? Due to all that mass collapsing onto itself? @NASA
Just another nuclear bomb testing in north korea...
I saw this live, was crazy.
Stuff from Nasa should be trending more often
Fuck athiests
Wow, I never realised we could get cameras that close to stars, wonder how they found them, really lucky
Ain't no doomed neutron stars cos ain't no universe cos ain't no globe Earth.\n\nCome at me globalists.
This has been reported several times and we are into the second wave now.. each wave of energy is thousands of times stronger than the last. Space weather is directly responsible for the earth pains.. Not man made global warming...Ask yourself, why did all the tarmacs and runways change there . Coordinates magnetic north has changed several years ago when you look at a fixed Compass it is a half hour off around the world our Earth is tilting on its axis these things are happening due to space weather and possibly an incoming binary star possibly a lot more things that are going on than you think they do not report on many things

I can’t believe my King Gizzard made it on the trending tab. I wonder how normal people will react to this?
Why the fuck everyone just talked to stu
I imagine the viewcount of this video as 35,000 tiny lizards congregating from all corners of the earth to a singular location where this song is playing and they are hypnotically fixated on it.
Holy fuck 8:24- 9:00 is perfect, Galea and Stu created a masterpiece
*MY WHOLE LIFE HAS LED UP TO THIS VERY MOMENT*
Get this on Spotifyyyyyyyyyyy
This video is such a beautiful work of art
I can already see the crowd going crazy  to this song, can't wait to see them live again.
These guys could do a gospel album and it would be amazing even.
I don't want to be a crumbling crumbling crumbling arsehole
oh my fucking shit this is SO GOOD
hi there - we too are an aussie 'psych' band with a new video - check it out if you like. shanti <3\nhttps://youtu.be/d7E1LUtk4b4
My room is soaked in foulness from my guts,  a stream of shameful remnants of meals past.  Brown notes came from the internet and my sexual peak reached beyond the reach of my earthly gaze.
i still can’t get over how amazing this is
Uma banda, uma música e um clipe para as viúvas do Tame Impala largarem o luto e virem  direção à luz.
Ehh... they need to mix up their vocal melodies a little more. This is a retread. The ending is cool though.
King gizzard should play in jersey (UK) as there is no good music here and we need good music
are they joking. they're really doing it fuck. aaaaaand 4
Fuck me! This band is life
Shit, i'm Nonagoninfinitystucked in this!
This amount of talent... These guys just transcended silly mortals
Cavs is getting a solo calling it now
What kind of castle was it?
We don't deserve this band
My boys. Yes thank you.
I fucking love this band.
So many awesome visual ideas stacked together with the music. I can't imagine how long this took. \nOh, and the song itself is epic.
Best video of the year so far, this is on another level!
🅱 r u m 🅱 l i n g   🅱 a s t l e
When is the new album coming out?!
Anyone know how he made this video? Looks like a video synthesizer but some of it must be programmed...
The two months more longer of my life
This is next next level. WOW thank u Gizz, y'all rule so much
Awesome boys,  keep up the drugs
They were just in Albuquerque I'm so disappointed I couldn't go
it's alright, but I'm not that into it. it lacks that infectiousness that I typically associate with the rhythms of mr. gizzard. hopefully multiple listens will prove me wrong.
That's gotta mean there's another Lp coming out real soon....cool track!
This makes my blood lizard temperature and im not getting any warmer!!!!
7:33 - 8:00 It's a fig wasp?
Instantly liked this. I like me some calm, meditative songs too.
new song and we sure new album coming soon :) https://goo.gl/WWUhVU
How was the video made?
perfect for a cup of tea and alphago reviewings
That Mind Fuzz break at 8:24 is pure sex
This band and oh sees get better every time I hear them. Love tripped out music.
this gives me the big benis
This song was literally designed for people high out of their fucking mind. I watched the entire 10 minutes twice fascinated by it.
Can someone PLEASE tell me how can I do similar visuals to these? I'm totally lost, my guess would be analog editing or some kind of circuit bending editing method but I just don't know
synth game strong as hell
those 3 last minutes are daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn fucking cool!

In the UK, the entirety of the BBC knew about Jimmy Saville being a pedo, but did nothing about it and let it continue because they didn't want to rock the boat. In Churches, pedophile priests were moved from diocese to diocese everytime the locals became aware of their perversions, and the best one to move them was Ratzinger, later Pope John Paul II. Everyone knew it was happening and even joked about it, but no-one did anything. In London, the British Parliament under Maggie Thatcher were practically spilling over with pedophiles and perverts, and the entire Parliament knew about it, but it was bad for your career to stand up so no-one did.\n\nI'm sorry to say, but when you have positions of power, people with incredibly evil predatory ambitions will seek those positions out to get access to what the normal public cant. That will always happen. But it's too sick and wrong that people who are normal, WILL NOT SPEAK UP WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT IT. Like fuck me who cares if you have to take a regular 9-5 office job after, you stopped some poor kid (including young adults) from being taken advantage of! Speak up and speak out. The whole damn place is rotten to the core with people who kept silent and knew.
Harvey Wankstain
I can't believe they are treating this guy with kid gloves. He absolutely needs to be in prison. He has been terrorizing women for 30 years at least. We can't let this slid by....He is everything that should be in prison THIS is exactly the type we need to save space for in prison not the guy who doesn't prey on, manipulate, embarrass, bully, coerce, be crude to, degrade, extort, threaten, retaliate against, trap them in place they want to leave or felt uncomfortable being, abduct, physically restrain or blocked doorways/ take keys, cause terror, fear and panic \n, touched inappropriately, assaulted by physical fight, assaulted sexually, raped, begged enough or promised enough so she gave in finally.... especially when a man or any person is in an important position of power it makes it even more sicker. This is disgustingly sad AND UNACCEPTABLE.
Though Hollywood was pro woman's rights. Only against Republicans I guess.
Holy fuck!!!! That Donna Karan he/she scared the shit out of me. God damn it!!! She is one hideous fucking thing.
The same bastard you guys were praising! Now look at your backs turn as he gets caught. We know YOURE ALL LIKE HARVEY
I would clock Oliver so hard id send him back to mock the week
Donna was asking for it!
Donna Karan is the ugliest female  ever !!!
Damn, that bitch who was talking is both very ugly and very stupid
Anyone notice the doug dimmadome owner of the dimsdale dimmadome hat was stolen?
I always do my very best to treat women with respect, kindness and compassion. I know that while both genders are capable of mistreating others, in this case, the heart of the problem is the men. The best way to work towards solving a social issue is to raise young men up to value others and be respectable in the way they conduct themselves. Encourage a culture of excellence among men. Women also have a responsibility to behave honorably and with modesty, but in general, as with sexual harassment, the solution starts with the men.
It's Hollywood ..... this asshole tried to blame the Right for rape culture ...... hmmmmmm no wonder California wants to be their own country ...
Leave Mel alone
Every guy excuses this shot behavior
This guy is not funny
western culture  in a nutshell
Now I know why DKNY reminds me of a word-jumble version of the word donkey.
Holy fuck he's not talking about trump. That's shocking.
This is what happens when you are on the outs with the Illuminati.
My only question is why haven't we heard from Gloria Allred yet? That ambulance chasing, media whore is conspicuously absent from this train wreck.
The chick with the pony tail looks like Alice the Goon from the old Popeye cartoon
Kinda proves what a lot of people have been saying... Everyone in hollywood seems to be hiding shit.
Bruh wtf if he showed up in my room I'd cut his dick off
FACT: All men are potential rapists, and all women are potential whores.
Angie Everheart told everyone but the police.
This. Thank you, John. They are trying to teach us to accept the unacceptable, tolerate the intolerable, let them dominate the indomitable, and subjugate the adamant. Thank you for standing up.
If Donna Karen's right, then I guess she's asking for some fucking saddle soap, because her face looks like a weathered scrap of leather pulled over a skull
Did nobody speak out because he was Jewish? Did they fear being labelled an 'anti-Semite'?
john oliver reads a script beautifully
Yeah it's just rape, assault, sexism and other locker room behaviors, so it's ok... Just relax! WtF!!!
You knew Oliver...and you're making jokes out of it, not funny. Go home to the UK
You complicit depraved person, how long did it take you to cover this?
South spirit value modern remove main fee repeat auto uniform refugee lay.
Donna Karen is one ugly bitch
Donna Karen is right though your dressing procacative and slutty you're clothing is saying come fuck me and turning men on. Don't be mad when you attract some nut job who will act on his animalistic instincts. Eat a dick sjw and liberal retards facts are facts
Jews protecting other Jews criminal behavior...color me shocked.
These women perform sexual acts to get movie parts and become rich makes them whores. Any woman can say no to being paid for sex. Some just choose to be whores.
Harvey Weinstein, the new face of liberal America.
Ohhh, it's just a cancer.
FYI DNYK is in debt to the the money leder/media racial mafia that runs occupied America.  If she does not go along and justify the exploitation by the nongentiles she will be ruined.
Ah the veil is dropping. Maintaining the casting couch mentality is patriarchal and disgusting. \nMen , could you just evaluate your thoughts and behaviors towards women already? Catch up so we can all love together equally. Ciao!
STFU SNOWFLAKES ALL THE HOLLYWOOD KNEW AND SO THIS CUNT JOHN OLIVER ..
Are all american democrats deviants?🇬🇧
Hit it on the head. Weinstein is a scapegoat. There is a far greater foundational problem with the morality of hollywood.
Let's See who is rich here paypal.me/UMukhiya
John the cuck oliver has probably given Harvey a handy.
Wow Harvey Weinstein looks like Chris moyles in that picture
Jesus Christ, I thought I was hideous. Donna makes me look like a work of art!
Who fucking cares! Get a damn life you sad cunts.
Of course all these Hollywood liberals are nasty and sitghusting... Stupid ass holes,.. Liberal American Jews who run Hollywood and the music industry need to go!
How do you find a jew\n\n\n\n\nFollow your nose\nNose\nNos\nNo\nN\nNo\nNoo\nNoos\nNoose
This behavior had been going on since Hollywood began. Even as these people come forward about what Harvey did to them, and talk about what other producers and bigwigs have done as well, no other names are being called out. They're still being complacent about this sickening behavior to protect themselves. Makes me wonder who Harvey pissed off to make it all right to come out against him.
Just look up images of the dresses Karen designs, dresses slashed to the thigh, low cut, tight shiney materials. \nSHE is dressing women in the way she is suggesting makes them legitimate targets for letchers like Weinstein!!
support Harvey Weinstein is under now way excusable, but it really does not make sense to me why men dress code is full while women show a lot more skin. Practically a short wind blow would make The Modern WOMAN naked... should men also start dressing with their members out or a small cover on it..... what will that say to the society....  I say stop displaying WOMEN and problems will be solved.
wtf is that thing!!! @ 1:25
Hollywood going down finally.
Donna Karen is a disgrace. GFY Donna
I'm going to have nightmares after seeing Donna Karan. There should have been some sort of warning.
i dont want to be an asshole but..... before watching the video i REALLY didnt know if oliver was going to side with weinstein or not, he opted for the smart approach though, good for him
The academy are a bunch of weasels themselves. There are stories coming out that this Jabba the hut looking mofo has been doing this for years and people knew of it I'm sure the academy knew too. They only say that statement now to cover their asses, there are probably more people like Weinstein in the academy as well.
John Oliver is a traitorous piece of talentless crap. He can only read from a Teleprompter, not even his words, the words are put there by his masters
I really love how John Oliver only spent 2 minutes on this. While in literally EVERY ONE OF HIS SHOWS he manages to spend 10-20 minutes on Donald Trump alone. EVERY SHOW! Stop pushing your democratic agenda you fuck.
Uh, she is the only honest one. Women will do anything to gain power or money. You dumbasses. Women aren't victims of anything. Why not just walk around topless. Let me know how that goes. Grab em by the pussy. If it was a rock star or NFL player who said that than they would wish it to be true.
I love who you people try to act like your shocked by this.\nYou fuckers have known about his behaviour for years.\nYet because you have a troll shielding mentality, you just swept it under the fucking rug.\nFucking disgusting.
Donna Karen is a foo.
Wtf did Donna Karen said???
i blame women, ya say you want an assertive man that knows what he wants and takes it, but when we do you wanna scream sexual assault, smh
Why am I not 50 points ahead she screams.  Because you are BFF with Harvey Weinstein.
Lol using TMZ as a a source
Wow Hollywood actors are hypocritical!? I wonder if there was a constituency whose been saying this for years!
Fake news. Multimillionaire limousine liberals are perfect and above the law.
Are you a dumbass John? Of course it matters how woman dress dumbass.
15 minutes on Equifax, 2 minutes on the unraveling of Hollywood. Some might correctly point out that you're minimizing this story, you fucking hack.
she looks like F Murray Abraham in drag
Donna Karen is right and wrong!
Weiner and Weinstein two perverted pedophiles with weiners that can't keep it in their pants.
♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥  ♥♥♥♥\n*Jesus Christ is the Son of God & promises you eternal life if you simply believe Him.*\n*He promised to also heal your body.   (Just ask Him)*
I take it none of them got the part they were promised? They all do this your fav celebs engage in these activities.
Harvey is one of the king Jews in Hollywood and if you cross the jews in Hollywood you do not work.
John Oliver had to suck Weinsteins dick once.
Hey John.....I don't think that women that frees sexy are inviting sexual harassment- but - women that play along as long as it gets them the role they want are enabling it....and many women did - apparently......til they saw more dollar signs in finally coming out against him.   He's a pig - not doubt ...but the women that went along with it were Hollywood whores.
Donna Karen is a transexual, observe the male shoulders, collar bones, male gaze, brow ridge, inset eyes etc.  Trannys rule hollywood.
Yes, amillion accusations the moment the story hits... Hmm, funny.
donna karen should choke on her spit.
New Weinstein Halloween costume....just masterbate into a planter.
(((Harvey Weinstein)))
Classic Harvey...
hes a frickin pig
This guys voice is annoying as fuck
If this guy doesn’t go straight to prison everyone needs to take a hard look at themselves, the justice system, the rich, the powerful and modern society.
Celebrities, including talkshow hosts with all their contrived innocence in not knowing anything. What a bunch of hypocrites.
HW's predatory behavior was an open secret in the industry. There's supposedly more, including paedophiles.\n\nThe code of silence needs to be broken.\n\nI hope more get exposed.
I really get a kick out of leftwing cannibalism!
John, this is like Hillary attempting to shame Washington DC, so get fucked you phony. :)
He's a virtue signalling man-gina.Spineless.
And his victims didn’t speak out to “protect their careers” but are now coming out in droves and are called heroes. Shame on you ALL Hollywood
Hes yours libs
Practically all of Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein and his disgust acts, yet nobody did anything to stop him. \n\nIt just goes to show that Hollywood is corrupt liberal shithole.
john oliver, left wing faggot that probably has taken money personally from weinstein
I am insecure about my small dick. I hate it and it keeps me away from dating.
my biggest insecurity is my stretch marks. like im only 19 and i have them all over the back of my calves, thighs, and hips. they're very dark too. even though ive only gained a bit of weight. i guess my skin is just very prone to them. it makes me not want to wear shorts.
Definitely relate to Hannah on the boob insecurity, I'm not as big as her( for reference I was like a 36E, at the time) but always thought they were bigger then I wanted and had a guy comment they look like two beach balls on your chest.... Beach balls!! I've never been able to think about them positively since
Thank you both for talking about this! x\nI also have the big boob and short thing (among other stuff, and am about to turn 25!
I thought you said what my birthgiver gave to me in my mum's mouth so I was like wait what @_@
This is so lovely, made me feel better about myself knowing I’m not the only one💜
She is NOT insecure about those boobs as she never stops talking about them and always draws attention to them. For such a source of discomfort she doesn’t half like them looked at by other people. And no, she won’t get a reduction as she would be a lot less interesting without those gifts from god👍
His name is Riyadh : Saudi Arabia capital city
Skinny shamed....now it has a name. I'm god damn skinny and everybody feels qualified to tell me that I should eat more, because I'm so skinny aaaand not always feeling great with my body and still having insecurities....
I have the same insecurity as you Hannah and I totally feel for you and your large breasts! I’ve always been a smaller than average sized person but with larger than average sized breasts and they really grew when I entered college. I also like to dress androgynously so I always hated how my breasts affected my clothing options and like you I often can’t fit into clothes just because of my breasts. I really commend you for talking about your insecurity with Riyadh because it made me feel like I wasn’t alone. I hope to one day get a reduction as well. Also I totally feel you about the horrible back pains!!
I was about to write the thing with your dad and the nose in the comment. There are things on our bodies which are maybe a bit too prominent for our liking or bother us in a different way, but theycan also be things we have inherited from our parents. Therefore they will always be a sign of where we come from and what our history is, that made us who we are now. (Really shitty if you don't have a good relationship with your parents)
I've been a lot less insecure about my body since I had a skin graft after a really bad burn last year. It changed the colour and texture of the skin on my whole left thigh and it doesn't look great, but it's kind of put all the other things I was insecure about into perspective, because now my body will never look perfect anyway it just doesn't feel worth worrying about. And I figure it's character building
If we are to believe Darwin then everyone alive is best adapted to the environment . It was sad to me to see the change in my daughter when she started reading teen magazines . The fashion , make up , entertainment , snake oil medication industries , etc , rely on pressing buttons in the minds of the insecure to generate huge wealth from people who have little money of their own . Not much morality when it comes to making money .
Is everyone supposed to have insecurities? Cos i can't think of any. I'm going bald, i'm fat and i'm hairy, but simply means i don't need much shampoo, but i have to wear a hat not to get sunburned or cold; i should get back in shape because it's not healthy and i leave hair everywhere and get annoyed by everything that promotes hairlessness. I don't understand why men and women shave, wax and do all kinds of crazy stuff to get rid of body hair. \n\nHonestly, all the insecurities you mentioned, i would never notice, except for Hannah's boobs obviously. \nI'm into small boobs, but i didn't think Hannah's boobs were that big. \nbtw Hannah, i knew a girl that had small boobs and said the same thing you said about not feeling anything, maybe it's not just a size thing.
You guys are amazing, this is the conversation that need started
I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE NERVE ENDINGS IN BREASTS but everything makes so much sense now, omg
I have so many insecurities, they make me really upset. It's my weight, stretchmarks on my thighs bum and boobs, my actual boobs, my thighs my hands and my arms. I also have a bump on my head which is a scar and will never go. So yeah
I don't wear 'normal' bras cause I hate the size of my boobs
Another awesome video! Thanks for sharing. Wouldn't even know where to start with my insecurities. Several nose jobs, a chin implant/removal, genioplasty, ear pinning, and scars from the above! I still hate pretty much everything, and hate going out in public. Surgery doesn't always turn out the way one would like, and can end up making you feel even worse than before. I definitely think talking openly is the best way forward. So much pressure to look good these days, and the gay world can also be very difficult unless you look a certain way.
I really want to get my teeth whitened, does anyone know how expensive it is?
I really need to get to the gym I have that flab thing even while standing up
9:14 NOW KISS ME YOU FOOL IM SCREAMING
Riyadh you have the exact same tummy as my boyfriend and it's sooooo cute I love it
50 k views 12 on trending\nYouTube algorithm promoting boring ass channels with no humour at all. That's why lots of funny and edgy youtubers are getting demonitized
See 'How YouTube’s stars are shaming the issues affecting their own fan base' for a look at the opposite to this great video : http://nomajesty.com/youtube-stars-shaming-mental-health-issues/
Its kinda difficult listening to such perfect people talking about them supposedly looking bad when i'm here like help im ugly
I've just found you Riyadh and I love this video! Thanks so much for doing it and I'm going to subscribe :)
My biggest insecurity are my Teeth.\nI hate my teeth because they aren't white and shaped correctly, It effects my day to day life because I now cover my mouth when I'm too close to someone talking or if I'm laughing.
I'm insecure about my belly also, I am 23 and am the heaviest I've ever been (fluctuating around the 9 stone mark and am a size 12). I know Im not the biggest person in the world but as someone who as a young child was neglected and severely underweight until I was adopted at the age of 3 where I slowly put on weight (I was still a very skinny child and even through to secondary school where I was a size 8. being negatively impacted that way puts a lot of emphasis on your weight when you realise that you are the biggest you've ever been its quite a lot to take in. Especially when you pair that with the way my stomach is shaped, it literally looks like I'm a couple of months pregnant and no matter what I do it doesn't go away. So from being skinny shamed as a teen to looking like Im 3 months pregnant (and having a couple of comments on it) really gets you down you know? Anyway, this video is fantastic, thank you for this.
Good for you guys! This is such a cool thing to do and share. Owning those parts of us we don't like makes us feel so much better about them. \n\nHow about a video of the parts of your body you LOVE, for balance?!
It's interesting to see that you two are such positive people on YouTube saying to own our bodies and you're here having the confidence to talk about your insecurities. It shows how human you guys are, a lot of the time people don't realise that everyone isn't indestructible especially on YouTube, it shows how real you guys are and it's lovely xx
This is just the worst thing I've ever seen. My insecurities are my balls are too big, this that and the other. Fucking narcissists
Are you 2 for real??? You are what's wrong with the world, snowflakes bitching about fuckall.you ain't making people feel better.i just want to smash your heads together.god dam,some people make me sick.
Had a blast watching this One! Thanks!
Why the fuck is this trending this is a waist of trending space
Really wonderful video that will impact anyone, as we all have our insecurities. But, I have to say, the comment about being able to look in a mirror and always being able to see your Dad...that was a really beautiful thing to say!
Don't worry everyone has insecurities. Mine is well large LOL. I'm a real heavy-set guy and I was bullied a lot because of it and well I developed a very big insecurity plus it doesn't help much when my doctor says then I'm going to die of diabetes pretty soon just because I'm big. Funny right?
I have a condition called Pectus Carinatum, aka pigeon chest, and because of that I always hated my body. I was always skinny - which made my chest even more proeminent. This issue made me never get shirtless in public and even have some back problems as I was constantly trying to hide this proeminent chest. I would just get in a swimming pool wearing a t-shirt and this made be so so uncomfortable. My parents and friends would always ask me things about my body and this only made the situation get worse. I never talked to anyone about this, as in my mind everything was so obvious. In my mind, everyone was starring at me and thinking how weird it looked.  I got to a point that I would refuse going out with my friends because I knew they would go to a swimming pool and they would pressure me to get shirtless. Urgh, awful times.\n\nAs the years passed, I got more mature and stopped worrying so much. I realised that everyone feels insecure about their body, even the ones that we look up to. Besides, my condition is not that bad. My chest is just a little proeminent. However, because I thought about this so much, everything in my mind was so much worse than it actually was. Nowadays, I regret not being myself and skipping so much fun I woud have. I still don't post pictures with my top off, but now I totally accept who I am and I feel it only gets better. :)
oh i have the nose veins too... i hate it.  my grandfather had them and thought the same thing. Then the doctor tells stop drinking that will help stop progress. like really... so understand your insecurity.
getting it off your chest
Irish boy with perfect muscles, perfect teeth, perfect jawline etc: “I have body insecurities”\nMe without all the above: “Well fuck me, I might as well kill myself”
You two young folks have nothing to worry about. My pal Ben once went out with a girl, who got on top of him as they had sex. When asleep and alone, later that night, he likely had a nightmare that centred on Africa, particularly on vast elephant ears, if you get my meaning. OK, nobody's perfect, but Jesus, I HATE those !
Dear Hannah,\nI have had a breast reduction/breast lift and it CHANGED MY LIFE.\nI went to see this top-notch specialist in Paris and she did an a-ma-zing job. \nI would definitely recommend it! \nXx
Just have to say I love your nose. It’s like my fav feature of your very handsome face.
I didn't knew the boobs thing! Oh dear :O\nI'm like him, i like nipple stimulation <3

Ears are apart of your face/head n they're all meant to stick out a little it helps shape your head n face. You look so gorgeous and pretty with your hair slightly back to show your cute ears. Believe it.
you two are cute
Why is he talking like that?
I quit biting my nails by realising what it was doing to my teeth. I read later that if you want to get rid of a habit, you need to replace the habit with something else. I chose to look after my teeth and my nail biting habit(of 20+ years) couldn't exist in symbiosis :)
I completely understand what Hannah said after talking about her teeth . It's okey to change parts of your body if you don't feel good about them, but when you change them because you're pressured by society's beauty standard it just adds to the huge problem we have now a days with companies exploiting insecurities that they create. Loved the video by the way!
Litereally everyone has those roles, that's like saying you're insecure about having feet.
Your nose is great! Never change!
I had the same realisation as Riyadh about my nose too. All my life I hated how big and round it was, but after my granny (Who had an identical nose to me) died I started to appreciate that it was the thing that made me resemble her, and that made me love it. My dad has the same nose too, so it now makes me happier to think that we all share this trait together.
Also, Riyadh's nose is one of the most attractive things about him (in my opinion)!
i love you guys!<3
I have what's known as gynecomastia which is the growth of breast tissue in men, a.k.a. man boobs.  They grew when I was going through my puberty.  I was bullied for having man boobs by multiple people throughout my school days.  I would always wear clothes that wouldn't show them too much in an attempt to hide them and, even though I'm less conscious of them now, at the age of 24 I'm still insecure about them to the point that, for example, going swimming is a no-no.  I've always been a bigger than average guy however I've lost a significant amount of weight this year and they have gotten smaller but they'll always be bigger than that of an average guy unless I get surgery.
THIS VIDEO WAS EVERYTHING!!! LOVED IT
If this guy thinks having short bitten fingernails is a reason to be insecure..he wouldn't dig stretch marks like I've got lol wanna trade?
Great video guys..really fantastic and you guys are gorgeous.\n\nAlso I want to say lets all be careful of what we say to our significant others...some things can be really damaging
I was bullied for my freckles, because they are all along my nose and under my eyes, i used to cover them up when i would go to school, take pictures or just generally go out i didn't feel that they were a problem until someone said something about it, it just shows how people can affect you. You guys are so brave.<3
Kiss Me You Fool IS THIS A LARRY STYLINSON REFERENCE RIYADH?!?!?!?!?!??! HELLL YEEEEEEA BOI
Riyadh's videos make me so so so happy
For me it's the same for my nose cause I don't really like it and I thought of changing it but it's the same of my grandpa and he is not here anymore so it's something that I have of him
This was such a great video :) \nI’m really struggling with my teeth too, I hate how they look and how they look in pictures and I’m recently engaged and panicking about my wedding photos! \nEveryone else has told me that they’re fine and look good but I just cannot get passed it! I’ve been to an orthodontist to get advice and they have offered Invisalign but omg is it expensive! I’m looking to go ahead with it in November but I feel SO GUILTY about spending so much on a cosmetic procedure because I could do so much more with the money. 😭 it feels like such a vain thing.\nHaving a crisis of the mind.
This was amazing. Thank you so much for being open and honest. It’s so refreshing to hear this kind of dialogue. You’re both absolutely beautiful.
Riyadh is such a sweet cinnamon roll.\nlmao at his reaction to Hannah whacking her boobs...
yeah I have a little Rosacea near my nose that I inherited from my dad.. I'm really self conscious about it as well but nobody ever notices it but me..
You know nothing of insecurities :(
Riyadh, not that you need it, but those threadveins can be treated and removed with intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments! Most cosmetic dermatologists do the treatment.
My insecurity was how big my butt  was when I was going through puberty. I'm 23 now and I've excepted it for what is. To give you a reference my waist is 28 inches my butt is 42 inches , I would wear coats and jackets all year round to hide my shape from people in grade school. Now at this age my body type is desired and front in the media.
And may I add that your picture for attitude magazine are the hottest/most fashiomable thing ever !!! Almost died when I saw them. The pink ones 😍😍😍( jockstrap+pink denim shorts)
My biggest insecurity is my nose It looks like my dad's nose . It's  really big. I tried to accept it but it's back to square one when my sister or brother comment on it
I think quite a powerful perception is the fact that, both of you are genuinely nice people and your viewers really like you. With that, they will only see how beautiful you both are and will celebrate how you physically look.
My main insecurities are my acne (had it since I was 9 I'm now 19) and my stomach and thighs
Ah ye're both beautiful ye big rides xxx
I have a thing about noses and yours is grand.
Honestly Riyadh , you are so stunningly beautiful! I understand the whole find imperfections attractive thing though. I'm the same.  I hate muscles on a guy. Keep up the good work & thanx for your honesty x x

Hannah's fun bags are gorgeous!
MY FAVES
Riyadh be my boyfriend 😉😍😂😂😂
remove the gay dude, and it can be female insecurities. Not Female, and confused male, who doesn't have real male insecurities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first guy to die when the banks go down.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxHIftZVfrQ
Riyadh would say anything if he thought there was a BBC documentary in it. He should do a documentary on narcissism and humble bragging. (This guy recently posted a video of him in budgie smugglers slowly running into the ocean. Yeah, thats the sign of someone with serious body issues).
Your nose is fkn amazing
Insecurity: When a 50 year bitch told me I am too short when I was 7...\nInsecurity II: When your bitch 12 years class might bully you look for 12 years\nInsecurity III: When you don't have muscle definition and  a body of a typical Asian (extreme thin)\n\nTherefore, I always feel ugly and disgusting all the time in school. I hate being on the spotlight in front people that i don't want to see. And I injured my knees because I play figure skate as a leisure sport for 13 years and I know when puberty hits me emotionally in the face I won't get tall. Sad fact to know, but there is nothing wrong to be short. Sometimes I ask, do I have to be look a certain way to be reassure the social norm? Nope.\n\nWords of wisdom: Stop fucking bully people because of something that they can't fucking change. You shit people who bullied me.
Well done Law Enforcement officer. Let's hope this criminal doesn't have access to Children.
How about boxers racing cars? Anthony Joshua races Deontay Wilder in the Indy 500! And then they can fight at the end with Jimmy Kinmel as special referee.
top tip drivers don't take your helmet off when you fight
If this was hockey the show would of stopped for a fight !  Inmates racing  cars is always gonna b a taze fest when shit goes down.
This is Trump's America.
I guess a lot of people like attempted homicide. This video is scary.
looks like they build cars out of trash and try to race it... am i wrong ?
typical fat guy tough when the guys stuck in the car, you WANKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
American Motorsport is shit. The USA F1 GP is on this weekend :/
anyone remember the nascar south park episode?
Yep, the stupid mericans just watching how someone kills another human being.... Everyday same shitty story! Fooking retards, instead of separating them they are watching...
if you're still wondering how trump won after watching this, there is no help for you.....
thats the most american video ever lol
You’d be hard pressed to find one person there with an IQ over 90
look at all the acceptable racism going on in this comment section.
what is this, Nascar for rednecks?
If fat boy weighed a bit less his car would have gone faster
How much do you want to bet they voted 'Trump'?
The policeman should be arrested for trespassing on the track
Were they related? I bet they were related. Or they they share the same cousin.........If you know what I mean!
Who the eff is that girl screaming like seriously calm down nobody died.
What will ferrell movie is this clip from again?
Hahaha he tasered him with gas and oil leaking everywhere. This could have become a much bigger story.
Prooobably didn't need to smash into his car. Probably.
What the guy in the black car did was pretty much vehicular assault, perhaps attempted murder. The man who got shot with the stun gun and handcuffed had full right to be upset at the driver of the black car for potentially having killed him.
One of the best fights ever as u don't see any fucking great keeping it pg
what in the bucknekked hee haw tarnation is going on here???
Lol if nascar was more like this than it would be much more exciting
This is what happens when you pay people a bunch of money to win games
If it was NASCAR he will be dead   That guy is so fat he need 2 hand cuff
Lmao! Probably the funnest part of the night.
*This video's the perfect example of why Formula 1 Racing is for idiots!*
the other driver got cuffed to 4:53
stupid motorsports made in US
Hey cops, do this the next time Antifa or Black Lives Matter members open their mouths.
Idiot screaming female in the background was very annoying.
F'n tards, both of them.
The fighting is more entertaining than the race.
Why is everyone so pissy?? This was hilarious! 😂
So why don't the Arrest NASCAR Drivers when they do this?
20 years ago they would have just separated them. That driver definitely deserved an ass beating.
Wow! This is crazy is that who we are now, instead of giving them a hand we throw a punch, this isn't funny at all. God please help us, we need Jesus in our life.
He took his job!
Soo only baseball, basketball, and football players can fight on the field with no repercussions. I'd like to see that happen on a NFL field.
What the hell was that dumbass in the black car trying to do. Deserved to get his ass beat
I'm ashamed of my country
Both drivers should be arrested and the driver in the car that ran over 33 banned from racing.
Why are people screaming like crazy in the audience wtf... stop it...
I'm surprised the cop didn't kill em.
im impressed the black car was able to drive up onto the other one 10/10 would watch again
Well, they did sign up to put on a show.
I think car 33 is going to need an oil change.
Basketball: pretend to get tripped and ref lets you win game\nRacecars: Smash someone elses car and they get tased and arrested\nHmmmmmmmm
Lmao fucking rednecks. Ricky Bobby and his buddy are at it again. Shakin and bakin baby
Y'all wild this is lit!! 😂
So the dude almost died from that guy almost Crushing him with the car, so obviously the guy was gonna kick his ass
At the dirt track this happens everytime
Well. Nice to know there’s unprofessional asshats throughout society I guess
you know that CSI reverse camera angle bullshit? - how do we use it here? LoL!
These same people yell and scream that other races are violent.
Guide Lamp has been gone for years, but the cheering trash remains. Wonder if they keep The Lamplighter in business.
who the fuck is screaming? why the fuck?
Rednecks watching other rednecks destroying each other's property and beating the shit out of each other. Only thing missing is someone fucking their cousin in a corner and we'd have the perfect Redneck paradise.

I can't decide who the bigger pussies are; the cop who waddles in and goes straight for the taser, or the six guys standing there waiting for a lone cop to break it up.\n\nJesus Christ, just pull him off. They're redneck wannabe race car drivers,  not X-Men.
Most exciting thing to happen to this sport since Ricky Bobby....

Where are your earrings from?
This VLOG was so cute! Yay ✨
Those bread options look so yummy! oh my
I feel this video is SO REAL. I think for youtubers and subscribers. It's good to take a break. It's like you're rejuvenating yourself and you're channel. I know brands, events, PR stuff is part of your job. But taking a break from it. Gives you a rest which you need. But it also refreshes your channel. Personally I get a bit tired of seeing back to back video on Ad, promotion, events etc. I know hard work goes into it and I'm not demeaning the work. It just gets tiring to watch back to back. Just like it might be exhaustung to do back to back. I'd hope other youtubers would use your approach xx
The hotel looks amazing. Where would you recommend in London. I want to treat my mum to a weekend away for her birthday in December x
These two are adorable. So normal.
I got CHILLLS when I saw that bag, out of this world😍🤤😍🤤🤤🤤😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
This might be weird and intrusive but i’m rooting for you + alex! You guys seem like a good couple and you guys’ life seem so fast paced and busy. I would be totally ok if you didnt vlog for a couple days just so u guys could really really be w each other :) ps you guys looked really cute in the pool!
Alex' comments on the bag made my ❤melt! My other half rarely makes comments about my outfits or accessories but when he does it's so sweet xo
The Burberry bag gives me a 'space Barbie' vibe 😅❤
Hey Victoria! I am so glad to hear that you like the Sachini shirt. And the red dress you were trying made you look like a princess! Love, Sachini
Love when I can see both her and her bf in a video 🌸
It's been awhile since I last commented, so I just wanted to drop in. You are still as beautiful and down to earth as ever. And, I agree with Alex. That bag is gorgeous.
1- You look gorgeous bare faced and I'm really jealous\n2- Alex holding the baby....!\n2- You and Alex are goals and I wish you guys the best because you seem to be very cool and chill and fun and in love and you're both beautiful on top of that and it just makes me happy
 It was so delicious, I regret nothing I had to laugh it was quite unexpected.\nHugs from Costa Rica
You should check Demi Lovato documentary - It's complicated on Youtube, this is a good one too
Holy hell girl the dress! The tailoring was a good call. It's perfection!  😍💃😍💃

OMG, that Burberry bag! I just can't, how gorgeous it is! And also on the side note: your skin is literally goals! You mentioned LVL, can you please tell in which salon you do yours? I used their salon finder on the website, but 2  have already told me that they don't do it. Thanks xoxo
Alex & his handbag reviews. Space teal 🤣. Classic. Hotel & spa beautiful. Looking gorgeous as always Victoria. Congrats on the Hugo Boss news. Awesome. ❤️🍾 x

Heaven!!!\nHugs Adele xoxo
You’re so pretty, and I just love your style.  And Alex is just the sweetest.  You guys are cute.
My word that Christos dress is gorgeous on you. Congrats on Hugo Boss Victoria.  They’re lucky to have you.
Guuurl i notice the little spice you've added to your editing haha :))) you are a beautiful person inside and out!! love you and the vlogs xx
That dress looks lovely in that length! And can we all just take a moment to appreciate that BAG😍😍😍😍😍😍
You and Alex seem like the sweetest people
Awww, I lived in Bristol for 10 years before I moved back North. Worked in Bath for a short while and love it there so much. Made me feel so nostalgic watching this and you've given me some new places to visit, too! xx
Bread at restaurants is literally my favourite thing
This was a lovely video! So nice to watch you and Alex enjoy relaxed time, I always like it when he pipes in too! Can you share what lipstick you wore for date night in bath? Loved the entire look if you are inspired to do a tutorial I'd love it! Thanks for sharing as always.
When ur bag is bigger than u😜
Best last words for a vlog!! 😜
Ahhhh That Nars package from the event....so nice !!! 💕💕
i don't know why but alex's fixation with your new bag's color had me laughing so much 😂
I so hope Strathberry comes to Australia one day. 😃🤞🏼
This really made my evening. Thank you for sharing xxxx
Yay for a day off. Oh my gosh I WANT THAT BAG. Goals xxx
Absolutely love your vlogs. You're so stunning and you and Alex seem like such lovely people. X
Love the fresh face. Minimal is lovely on you.
Strathberry are wonderful - I organised a charity auction and the lovely ladies donated a beautiful midi tote bag, asking for nothing in return. I ended up getting my own bag as my graduation gift, and their instagram is absolute goals!
Pahah space teal! Love that
Alex showing interest in your bags is just 😍 so cute! #boyfriendgoals
Love Alex's commentaries 😂 and peeking
Looks like you had a beautiful relaxing week :) the red dress is ammmmmazing! Xox
I think those are the new TF full size lipstick shades. The girls are clutch size in white packaging aren't they?
Wow!!! The bag!!!
THAT. BAG. IS. GOALS!!! And the new Nars collections looks beautiful! Congrats on another wonderful video💕
Ok you are life goals.\n\n1) your brows have been amazing, what's your technique to get it to look like single hairs?\n\n2) I know Alex does a lot of your photography but for photos on your Instagram from your iPhone, what filters do you use?\n\nThanks for working so obviously hard to include a lot of your life and edit it to perfection. Have a lovely week!! xoxox
Oh my god, I live in Bath! So strange to see it on film and Acorn is my favourite restaurant! Glad you had a nice time, hope to bump into you if you come back! xo
Your boyfriend is the cutest . The loveliest couple 😍
Shout out to Alex's Rick and Morty figures!
And you shouldn't regret breaking bread with the ones you love. Great video.
You are hands down the prettiest, classiest beauty vlogger on YouTube. I don't even like watching beauty vlogs, they bore me to sobs, but I watch all of yours. I just adore your style, you look perfect  24/7.\nBtw, is that fabulous bag you designed for sale? I have a bag obsession 😁
Would love to see the tom ford sugar glider shade on you! Thank you for these lovely vlogs they help me just relax after a long day💕
What did one wall say to the other wall?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet you at the corner once I'm done giving birth to this child.
She's kind of annoying when out of character...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldK9qvRBkMI
WHAT IF IT'S ANOTHER WORLD, THERE COULD BE MULTIPLE 'UPSIDE DOWNS' \nWHAT IF THIS IS THAT WORLD WHERE WILL KEEPS SEEING THE NEW MONSTER
Thanks soon much Millie 😌😌😌😌 us fans really owe you one 😜😜😜😜😜😜😜
*_How it feels to chew 5 gum_*
I got nothing better to do now that PLL and Teen Wolf has ended 😭❤️ Recommendations?Xx
I'm So excited
The metaphor of the hole looking like a vagina is a metaphor for how eleven is being reborn again after her life changing adventure with the kids and fighting the demagorgan. her character has changed, she is stronger now, this is emphasised with her change in appearance for the rest of the show, as she is seen with curly hair as apposed to a buzz cut. she's not the scared test subject  anymore, she's Eleven. Expect a very different character this season
I’m just waiting for the reunion scene
She came back to go to the Snowball Dance with Mike
I'm so mad that I grew up at the same time and in the same town as her and I never got to say hi 😂😩
I feel so funky lol If any one knows what line that movie that's from get back to me .
Janitor:this is why I sleep at this school cause they never let me leave it’s always a mess around here
I can't wait!!!!
THE NOISES ARS SO GROSS W H A T
Did a 12 year old just blow me a kiss nigger?
When do you think the illuminati casting couch consumes her soul?
I wonder if Harry Jew Fuck Weinstein molested her.  Jews are killing Hollywood.
I hope they don’t make more than 3 seasons of this, I feel like there’s not much more they could do.
Millie could make an ideal stage Peter Pan! At first glance I thought she's a very pretty boy with long curly hair, and she almost sounds like a really adorable boy.
She is way too sophisticated for her age, like i find it cringy almost. I know that's a bit harsh but... yeah.
Reminds me of that video I watched one time... Live birth I think it was called
Excited for season 2. Millie is such a good actress, especially being so young and playing such a big character :)
Wake up folks, it's a boy.
Who's the new girl? We haven't gotten much on her yet
I'm just still trying to figure out how she'a alive
How can anyone dislike this video
This is how feminists are born
I watched the first episode only \nSo do they find their friend?
Oh my gods, I cannot wait for season 2!!
I have a feeling this is one of the first scènes of the new show....yessss you go girl!!!
Close your eyes while watching it
god i forgot how scary eleven was a times I LOVE HER!!!!!
It's very rare to find a cast that works. Every single person who starred in this is fantastic. So I'm grateful to see another season. Only downside, if this continues to be great. The Duffer brother's can rip up their plans for an ONLY 4 season show, cos' this has the potential to go the full hog like 'Supernatural' has and Eric Kripke only planned that for 3-5 season's at most; now look at it. Yeah 'Stranger Things' is a cool show. Love it.
I was biting my entire wrist watching this.
Never seen before clip... cos it hasn't been released yet millie lol
I love her hair so much
I want to ruffle her hair.
When she said in the mean time check out this.... her hand gesture reminded me of every granddad in the world.
I think Mike and El's reunion is gonna be so sweet! Between that, the new characters and finding out what happened to poor Will in the Upside-Down that's causing his terrible sickness, I'm so pumped for season 2!
I can’t wait to see mikes face when he sees 11 again
Me trying to come out
I am actually so excited!!!
Awww yes! Canny wait!!!! A wee catch up wi season one is at hand me thinks! Hmmmm.... *taps lips with forefinger* 😙
I have no words rn
Showed this to my mother, she said this was how i was born.
I have long hair
Glad I'm actually going there for the Friday
That was easier done then said...
I thought that was a boy with curly hair.
looks like a young kevin keegan
Omg omg so el and mike haven’t seen each other for probably almost a year and I can’t wait to see their reactions when they see each other. I’m crying
I literally CANT WAIT !!! It’s coming on the best day possible it’s the day before i go on holiday so I can download it and watch it on the plane 😆😆 IM LITERALLY WAITING TO SEE MIKES REACTION TO EL
There's no way this shit is keeping me from the snowball DAMN IT!
Same A.J Taylor\nI can't wait for season two
Yeah that hole in the wall doesn’t look like anything and certainly isn’t symbolic of rebirth...
her real accent annoys me for some reason...
Don’t let the predators get you Millie!!!! 😔
Mike, she’s still your date remember, she’s comingggg
E é nesse momento que vc fala, FODEU
please share and subscribe the latest video which covers POSTNATAL/POSTPARTUM depression  in UNDER 3 MINUTES;\nhttps://youtu.be/oVgn12jhmLo
Looks like she might be in Star Wars episode 8
Can you sub me I need to get to 325 subscribers before my birthday 28th October it’s all I would like for my birthday! Besides giving my family more love for the next chapter of my life 💗💗💗
Did I just watch a wall give birth to her,that's sure as hell what it looked like lmao
This is a wig. El has hair now 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
YES
😱😱😱
EW THE NOISES
LOVE her accent 😍😍😍
OMG MY NAME IS MILLIE
Ugly kids, proud parents
She looks like Mike!
Millie Bobby Brown Best Poses https://goo.gl/2Ly1s6 Live Video
Boy or girl?
I wasnt expecting that accent...
AH
Wait el is alive wtf yesssssssss😄😄😄
Thank you Millie!!!!!
Tracy Beaker... Ahem...
No more Yul Brenner

Give me more!!!!
thats what good pussy sound like
*1:20** Neo...is that you...?*
Awesome 👏
01:16 Ace Ventura any one?
@everyone PEOPLE OF KEKISTAN! Our noble and supreme kekistan leader bigmantyrone has declared a meme jihad against boston SJW's. We must do our service and shitpost on every social media sight, and spread the word of kekistan. shadilay my friends. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I think that the demogorgon and eleven are the same things because in the game the two headed demogorgon is used as the monster where one head is good and other bad. So as eleven got out of the Upside Down the other half did too. In the end when El raised her hand the monster raised its hand too in the same way El did. \n\n\nAlso in the game the 7 headed snake thing might be a clue to what the monster is in season 2 😉\n\n(Just a theory😂)
Oh it's a girl.
I cannot wait for the sex scene with el and mike
Why are shows like this overhyped aF
So from what I can tell, El can create gates to go in and out of the upside down, or at least change them.
IS THAT A GIRL OR FAGGOT
Why does she have short hair while breaking out. Shouldn’t she have cutly hair now
Wers barbie?
That guy did everyone a favour and let us see Lauren twerk ☺️

Why do you still promote these lacks-of-talent bimbos? I don't fucking get it. I'm not a hater, I just can't stand this corrupt industry. I need fresh talent instead of forced-sexuality.\nThe only thing their fans usually speak about in the comments are their bodies. I mean, what the hell?
Lmfaoo I love my girl mani but\n1. That wasn’t a milly rock. And mani knows how to milly rock I have a vid of them milly rocking during break at dance practice \n2. Her rolls was stiff as shit
Adam check if the machine *runs*\nThe machine has snow *blades*\nAdam = *Blade Runner*
cross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now\ncross now
Adam: Visits Blade Runner set\nTalks half of the time about a sci-fi snow plow
2:14 That laugh 😀
Do androids dream of electric geeks?
Adam, your enthusiasm makes my eyes tear up. Honestly, I rarely feel that way, but when I see how genuinely enthusiastic and happy you are about everything you do, I get choked up and cry tears of joy. You are an amazing person. Thank you.
GET OFF YOUR ASSES AND GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW PEOPLE!!!! It's that fucking mind blowing and game changing!!!!
Film isn't high resolution?
Blade Runner 2049 was a fantastic film, probably my new favorite movie up to this point. Though it makes me sad that relatively few people have the patience to appreciate it.
Blade Runner 2049, one of the only US movies in recent memory where they don't use the default available typeface for foreign languages.
hey adam, are you a white male? reee! what happened to you? I guess somebody started whispering in your ear. hope you get help.
I was pushing the refresh button 2 weeks till this video appeared
So awesome. Such a great movie too
Really cool. I'm going to see it next week. Can't wait!\nI'm going to be able to say cool, Adam drove that thing!.\nThanks for making me laugh yet again, you're great Adam!!!
All I want to see now is the memory maker's controller.
Adam Savage's Tour of a Street Sweeper from Blade Runner 2049
i'm going to go watch the new blade runner movie and in the background see Adam walking around with a camera man just looking at stuff 😂
Half video for a vehicle, I would have liked to see other stuff as well ...
I didn't see these scenes in the movie
reminds me of the amount of detail Weta put in to LoTR. Kudos.
I love how no matter how much in-person bts Adam has seen through the years, he still nerds out like every one of us would. Never change Adam
Well, if they need to make it match many of the outdoor scenes in the new movie, be sure to digitally colour correct the the crap out of it until all those meticulous details turn to monotone background mush.
now all us blade runner fans can spend the next 30 plus years re watching this and always find something new with each viewing . now that`s movie magic !
I want to see a video in which Adam Savage is depressed and smashes everything up in futile despair.
I love the way that Adam is almost like a little kid in a sweet shop when it comes to anything like this- sets, props, costumes; he gets giddy and super excited over the tiniest of things! :D I'm vicariously living out my geekyness through Adam :P
I love the ambience so much in this movie
Is that Ben Kingsley over Adam's left shoulder in the opening shot?
background music sounds ALOT like ghost in the shell original score!
after the vid he was told that snowplow was just a regular hungary mining truck
@5:42, I guess Smirnoff is still a thing in 2049 😂 Not sure how I caught that one lol
first counterpart maximum communicate olympic fade boss practical.
I wish they had released a bunch more promo like this leading up so more people would have seen this true work of art.
Is it bad that I want to live there?
Like a kid in a candy store.
0:16 okay but can we talk about this man's swag? Mr. Savage is fresh af
Amazing! That level detail done in 2.5 days.
I'd love to be an extra in one of these films, just to wear costume and walk around in the settings
When people think of Cyberpunk...Blade Runner is one of the first movies that people think of. Also I would really to to see that street sweeper/snow plow Adam drove on the roads for real..legit that thing would be fun to see doing work and I'm pretty sure the spinning blade is for large chunks of semi frozen snow.
Saw 2049 in IMAX yesterday, and wow it was great!!!
Your are the coolest guy ever! Awesome child-like enthusiasm! Just like me! I love these sets!
You lucky son of a gun!
My reaction during the opening scene of Blade Runner 2049 @2:12
Would that happen to be the same quarry the scene from expendables is filmed in?
I'd love to see interviews with the set decorators, explaining all those little details we glimpsed in this video.
It's sad when a Transformer or Resident Evil movie blows away Blade Runner at the box office.
Ugh payday is on Friday can't see it till this weekend.
What is that cool music called 5:10?
The Original Blade Runner Kinda Sucked. How Will The New One Fair Any Better?
I have purposefully suspended my disbelief so I can geek out with Adam. Too fun!
What's the name of the prequel he talked about on his podcast?? I've looked but to no avail!!
Adam's behind the scenes coverage of alien and bladerunner has been the sole reason why i want to see those films, i love it!
This is the set of the short with Bautista.
fuck it's cool
Damn Adam is lucky litle bit of hard work  to get his fantasy real
isnt that the same quarry that they used in hellboy 2
When you said, set dressed in two days, I pooped my pants.\n\nThen I realised that fabrication happened beforehand. I felt better.
I want to see Adam try the Spinner.
Adam Savage. Youre the man sir
I've been to that rave
I would love to drive one of the street sweepers
They should have Adam in every SciFi movie set. It would make for awesome content and I'm sure he wouldn't mind
He has to be jumping out of his skin being there.  Everything is state of the art which he knows intimately and the crew are top level.  How does he hide his nerd boner?
This whole set looks like a german post apocalyptic Larp. :D
Thank you very much for bringing us with you on the set of what seems to be my new favorite movie. I'll have to go see it again just to make sure :)
Will it be ready in 2049 too?
Yeah, the cryptic opening doesn't work in youtube where you have to put Set Tour of the Blade Runner Universe in the title of your video.
The blade runner franchise, -especially 2049- has some amazing set design. The people who make the props and character designs really know what they're doing and have a very specific vision.
lucky little fart !!!! I'm so Jelly !!!  -_-
01:33 I use to have those exact same *orange swivel cassette tape holders* .....coooool
Love this stuff. Love this channel. :)  Unique high quality content, plus they also cover he exact mix of topics that i like. Also really nice to see Adam freak/geek out over cool stuff. :D ^^
such a good film
You know, that's an interesting comment Adam made about the increase in resolution of modern films and modern digital projectors (not to mention BluRay on your TV at home). Some 20-odd years ago, I did the Universal Studios tour in southern California. The tram took us through a set that was being actively shot for some movie at the time, and we noted how it looked completely trashed and destroyed - it was just a street scene; some back alley. The guide told us that the set decorators HAD to exaggerate the filth, because once it made it onto the screen, between the lighting methods and the lower resolution of actual film, it would appear normal to viewers. If they dressed it normally as we'd see in real life, on film it would appear unrealistically pristine. Now, things have completely reversed.
I had no idea so much production was put into the 2048 short film.Sometimes behind the scenes takes away from a film.This definitely adds to it.
Man that's what I would call the realm of the Savage Nation?
Your editor hung a frame at 6:02 and change.
Awesome. Adam has become one of my biggest heroes.
Stepping where Ryan Gosling stepped? Jealous.
auto rickshaw in Hindi
5:32 LOL Edda kazetta :D :D
Yes please
Too bad the movie flopped
I came kipple.
2:46 I maed dis :D
love this video
you want eyeballs... <3 <3 <3
Nice! very cool.
2:14 Evil laugh.  😈
BLADE RUNNER Full HD : https://plus.google.com/+ThoeWilcentMovie/posts/Pw8qnHSsJ7D
So the sequence they were shooting, what was it for?
The movie was bad, face it. The koolaide is real...
shame that the movie sucked though.
This movie was given way too much money. They gave Ridley very little money to do the first one and it turned out well. Its not about the money. Yet the sequel cost $150m + god knows how much for marketing. For a niche sci fi movie thats insane. But because it fit Hollywood's anti capitalist narrative the money spiggots were set to kill.
So so cool......I'm a professional Graffiti artist based in the Uk and Ive just spent the day painting the wall and front of a flat boring bar in a nightclub  to look like riveted sheet iron that's all dirty,rusted and dented ..I work freehand with spraypaint and I know for a fact I could do this type of thing on movie sets ..I'd love to paint a vehicle or something for something as timeless as a Bladerunner movie.....Any production / Set designers out there ? Give me a shout.... Insta- @Hull_Graffiti  -  Si2ttk@Gmail.com  -  fb/Nick Horsfiled
who gives a shit? this is just for the promotional short. it may as well be a fan production, hardly even official.
Wait... who’s idea was it to have a snow plow in Los Angeles? That’d be like having air conditioning at the South Pole
So what are they filming here? A short film? Like the anime one but live action? Or a commercial? If anyone knows let me know 👌🏼
It's entirely possible this is not as much a fictional vehicle and it's not all that fictional dirt. Maybe they just told Adam so that he's happy...? \n\n(I live next to Hungary, i know they are capable to pull that stunt)
This movie is a disappointment compared to the old Blade Runner.
Sorry Adam, this movie sucked.  Like a fan film that did not understand the important things of Blade Runner.
nothing in 2049 felt or looked authentic, by contrast everything in the original did.
I wrote my English paper on YoingMinds because we had to persuade people to donate to a charity
I can be quite bad at remembering to take my antidepressants, and my mum can tell within a day if I have forgotten to take them. I'm generally quite a chill person, quick witted and love to be a giant nerdy goofball. But I become so angry and withdrawn when I forget to take them, I zone out a lot and can't control my emotions. \nIt really does mess with your brain to suddenly deprive your brain of the chemicals it's become accustomed to. Especially when you have commitments and responsibilities to attend to.
Is there any way you can do a part two to the video? Like how to get help dealing with mental issues, starting the process. Especially from a teen's view. Love you danny!
ryden trash is in the bath.  much like ryan himself.
Peace on earth, also I’m pissed, my computer, Otis ,never gave me the notifications until now...
Dan 2 things\n1) Your vid on depression kinda helped me in a way that I've asked for professional advice regarding my state of mind (I've got an appointment set for November) so thanks for that\n2) As someone from Singapore who used to drink tons of Ribena as a kid, wait a second..PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT RIBENA IS??
I got taken off anti-depressants cuz they weren't working but instead of being eased off I was taken off all at once and I was just constantly shifting between being about to fall asleep standing up and feeling like I had more energy than I ever had in my life and I had the weirdest dreams ever and random panic attacks and felt dizzy all the time and the whole thing culminated in me going to a concert and almost falling asleep in the middle of Phoenix's set
I had to negotiate with my boss to let me work from home every afternoon because I couldn't manage in an office of 100 people all day >< now at uni I'm spending full days in a lab and it's hell 😰
I know what ribena is and I'm from bc Canada your not insane i got your back
There are some places without healthcare and some places where they just don't talk about these things. Me, an American: ( ⚆ _ ⚆ ) you talkin bout meee
Why the hell do I have to be in Australia
Man, last night, I watched Crimson Peak, and I've never found it scary, but before I went to bed, I thought yo myself 'what if there's a ghost in my room?' and proceeded to have a nightmare because I was also having some anxiety issues that night, so I woke up and was so afraid for a second I just sprang to all-fours. I was lying on my front, you see. I could hardly sleep the rest of the night, I was so restless.
I really liked your video about mental health. I'm honours year in a psychology advanced degree :) Ribena is a thing in Australia too. It's my fave thing haha but I try not to have it because I drink way too much of it when I get it hahaha.
i thought he was gonna talk about train to busan for a split second kkkkk
Is that his natural hair? If it is, what a shame it took him so long to let us see it in all of its glory and cuteness
I get what Ribena is....we have it in Sweden as well 😂  well similar to it :)
peace... lmao.... i will stop being stupid so... i will just stop writing
My mom is a hater
I live in Ireland and we never dilute ribena here??
we need another internet support group. Any netflix recommendations?
This is 100% random but my friend says Ramen (Roh-men) Noodles like Ray-men Noodles.
I'm sorry but how the hell can you not know about ribena and even worse *not know what squash is*
Dan I'm sure you won't see this but I am SO PROUD that you're planning on having a chat with that Swedish Youtuber about recent events. I hope he is receptive to whatever you say to him on this topic. 🤞🤞🤞
i love you dan. So much
Hope you're OK Dan
ben ten more like tan dan
He doesn't believe in anything, but he's scared of all of those things 😆👍
Oh no..I missed it..damn! I shouldn't have gone to *Jenna's basketball game*
Lol help. All my friends want to die and they're the only ones keeping me alive. Were just a mess of a circle.
Ryden trash is in the bath
anybody else really want to do his eyebrows
My mental health is all over the place, I need a therapist. But I'm also dealing with chronic pains that have not been officially diagnosed as any actual chronic disease which is horrible because it means I can't get proper treatment and I just end up on tons of meds all the times. The meds, of course, make me sick. Now I might eventually become at risk of liver failure, kidney failure, and/or an ulcer. Yay health problems!
I WISH TØP WAS LIKE YOU GUYS AND NEW STUFF DAMN
The sound of styrofoam rubbing against itself, everything about chalk and the taste of celery make me want to throw up

Here in Mexico, we don't talk that much about mental health, everyone is like get over it and stuff, so they literally make you keep your feeling the most inside you can, so it's really hard, for me at least, because my parents are like, really sceptical when something has to be with mental illness...so yeah it's hard in other countries
Okay so Dan in this video reminds me of a young Roland Orzabal from Tears for Fears
Why did I think Ribeana (idk how to spell it) was some type of alcoholic drink. Kinda like wine lol.
Though I hate that Dan suffers from depression, I love that he understands the struggles of mental illness and can help people like me through their pain. I love him so much. 💛
I think living in an environment where people around you don't understand what depression is, or what it's like for someone going through a mental issue, sometimes makes me feel like a freak or the all the things people call me. Seeing people describe the same feelings or experience you went/ or are going through makes me feel okay. Thank you Daniel for beung honest and showing people that fighting and holding on is worth it. **Sorry for my grammar**
We have Ribena in Australia, i cant imagine a childhood without it
The video inspired me to start raising awareness about mental health at my school
In the Netherlands it's called Limonade or ranja (which is basically lemonade/squash  making water have different flavours). It is also a thing that everyone has in their house. Especially when you're a university student if we ask if someone needs to drink something choices are: Thee, coffee, beer, water or limonade (flavoured water) :)
where do you stream all of these?
I know it was a response to another comment but hearing I like Sheffield... it's lovable trash made my little yorkshire heart go all defensive
I love you more than you should love a person you have never met
Don't judge a book by its colour
I have never put Ribena in water, ever! They sell it in juice bottles, like Minute Maid, and CC Lemon at 7 Eleven's and other convenience stores like it, i've never heard of anyone drink it like that in HK

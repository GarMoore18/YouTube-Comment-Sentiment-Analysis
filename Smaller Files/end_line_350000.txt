Anybody else notice the oven mitt hand towel combo in the 3rd short?
Cats are selfish, self-serving cunts that want what they want when they want it. Get a dog.
He threw the tissue in the trash and just said. Yes...
This is the online equivalent of those really bad comics from the funnies section of the newspaper
I've seen your videos since I was 6 years old. This cat is my childhood :)
This is hilarious I could not stop laughing 😂
Neither of my cats ever played with lasers.  They always gave me a look as if to say, I always thought better of you…  Give me something to actually catch, or no go.
I just got a kitten 4 days ago! She's 8 weeks old and her name is Kindle. :)
Congratulations on making the video on #18 in trending, keep up the great work!!!
I just want everyone to know that every year in Minneapolis MN in the USA there is a cat video festival!
Cats are TOO funny and so much fun! I love my cat, her name is Shrimpy!
can i tag my cat in this
I'm in the same situation everyday! 😺👍💗
Hahaha all true and still all worth it. 🐾
I love this cat lol
You make my day-no matter what worries I carry around with me -you make me laugh and smile-thanks so much for keeping us smiling -we need it!
I love Simon's Cat - been watching for years.  Love IT!
Thank you so much for the giggles! Have a fantastic weekend. :D
My cat is fat and fluffy like a cloud also it weighs 20 pounds...
Simons cat told you to tap a few buttons here and get paid for it.....\n\n\n\n\nGO HERE 👉 http://tinyurl.com/y7gq4xz8
Great stuff, but I wish you had broken them into separate videos.
Is Simons Cat based off a real cat
i read that as cats can be a real pain in the ass
Imagine buying a new TV and your cat knocks it over. I had a cat once he bit me because he got hungry. I put him out never saw him again.
HA HA, LOLOUDLY, MAN!!! You was havin fun with that cat!
Can you try Tyra Beauty next?
I’m super pale and they don’t ever have light enough shades for what they give you. They need a much better range for especially dark but also some lighter shades. Like milk you gotta get with the times.
I love your curls oh my god, please never change your hair!
Your facial expressions and your way with words are iconic!  I immediately clicked that subscribe button since I don't want to be judged by your eyes, hair or those perfect nails.
How can Jackie talk about how milk doesn't have a wide range of foundation colors when glossier only has like 5 to 4 foundation colors
I have crows feet and I’m 15
Who cares how much you spent? You try to be cool by naming video with amount of cash you wasted on some shit instead of doing something smarter with it? Its your money, but maybe you should do something with your life instead of clickbaiting 15-year old children?
I hate when I have to blend shades and I get really depressed/pissed when I see that there are like 3 dark shades available! Like, WTF?! Apparently, we're all supposed to be oil painters, mixing our own shit in the chemistry lab we have to build in our bedrooms or something? Who the hell are all those shades for because everyone I know has to mix their own. Ridiculous!
I bought the blurt stick ad I like it
Love you in all your creative colors. I love your hair and everything. Love you girl!
Its a no for me
My sister introduced me to you 27 minutes ago.\nI didn’t know what I was missing.
This has been a bumpy road. But I'm glad we went on this journey.
You inspired me to buy makeup today. I'm on the stud side of the lesbian equation, but I wanted to clear up my complextion a little and thought why not give it a shot. Love you Jackie!
Girl....i love your humor..you are cracking me up!!
I hope you saved the receipt for all those products because you need to return them 😖
You are awesome! I had to subscribe! 💚💙
What brush did you use on your foundation?
Not a fan or the shimmery gloss  on the eyes it looks greasy but overall yass
EVERYONE WHEN AUNT JACKIE SAYS BRONZER YOU SHOUT BAKED.. BRONZER BAKED. AAAAND ⏳⌛Please hold while Aunt Jackie transfers your call 🚨 📱 😂😂😂😂
You're so entertaining, while educating me. I enjoy watching your videos especially this one!
i like how that golden foundation  looks on Jackie. its so hard for me to find a match for my complexion.  that golden milk seems to be my match.... i will be trying it out. thx!
That foundation made you look a bit oompa loompa-ish. I need milk to get it together
I jumped when the moisturizer shot out. 😂
Woohoo I'm one of the real ones ;)
This brand had never interested me at all
I'm high right now and I love ur video
This look is very beautiful
5:30 I mean one size fits all don't work for nobody they should know. I tried some one size fits all leggens... disappointed me 😂
This is also how I feel about seeing glossier blushes everywhere lol
I LOVE me some Aina!!!! Why can't you be in NYC lady...more matte foundation reviews please and thank you
I hope you make a video dedicated to your fave mascaras
Your personality is GREAT
I think I've just found my new favorite YouTuber
When you applied the bronzer 😂😂😂 Omg I died laughing
Jackie can you do a nail video! \nU R so funny! Guurrlll give milk their\nMakeup back, and get your hard earned coins back! 👎🏾 Nope!
Milk makeup was created for the girl on the go who doesn't have time to do a full beat. These products were not created for a full beat. It's a less is more look . I just want to make sure that doesn't get lost. Models don't wear full beats. I am just saying ... It looks great. But even the ladies at Sephora will tell you it's not that good for oily skin
Jackie, you should do a fall makeup routine!
My favorite product was the lip stick k. I wasn't a fan of the other products.. but I do have there setting blur spray and I love.. I just love watching your reviews! you keep it so real!!
I can definitely can see myself wearing the sheer cream blushes and highlighters on no foundation days, like when I'm hanging around the beach and want to look natural, glowy, and dewy.  I can also see the products working the  best for people with freckles, so the blush, bronzer, highlighter, etc absorbs to look more like a second skin and doesn't conceal their freckles.  \n\nAnd when they say they're targeting the youth... with $40 a pop, I'm sure they mean the kids of rich parents that go to like Malibu private schools. Lol
i think the foundation is cute but too oily for me i would step into the train station looking like an oil slick
Your hair reminds me of\nquinoa. but no offense because i love quinoa
I really hope all those ladies that take the time to apply expensive makeup are getting straight A' s  and tons of promotions at work
Gal (Jamaican style) why you make me buss out big laugh! They need some milk!
Can I just say I love all of your videos .. I love you're personality .. you're awesome ❤️❤️
Girl... that 'contour' stick... AHAAAAA!!! 😂 I love you.
You know what even tho your video was 25min long your personality is so great that I always kinda get disappointed when it's over lol I really enjoy your channel, shoutout to your hair it's growing a lot! Beautiful
Your undereyes were oily as hell before you put the wowder on. I am sooo extremely oily I know Milk products are not for me. Loved the review either way!
Get your money back quickly.
Jackie you’re so funny!😂
i was so stressed out she wasn't blending out her concealer
so what I got from this is.... MILK, do better
I don’t like how shiny this look is on you. I won’t be giving Milk a try. Thanks for sharing your thoughts and opinions on the Milk products.
I live for you
I'm not sure if you're gonna this comment or even respond, but I wanted to say this considering I rarely leave comments nowadays: Jackie, I am SO proud of your growth! I've been watching your channel almost since it started (I think 7-8 years ago). Your personality is SHINING dawling! And I love that you are here for dark-skinned women loudly and proudly! I'm not a beauty guru or anything (yet... maybe), but your comfort in front of the camera inspires me, not just for YouTube, but in general. \n\n...I'm kind of just randomly rambling about but anywho... I really adore you! And thank you so much for just living out who you are and representing! xoxo <3\n\nPS: My mother tried to put me on to you lmao talmbout have you seen this girl? I think she's a comedian who does makeup! lmfaooo I'm like nah ma, she's just naturally funny as hell lol
I saw the title and said you spent WHAT?! out loud like I was your mama or something 😂
I freaking laughed so hard when that moisturizer squirted out at you lmaooooo
It reminds me of korean beauty i think she looks very young and glowy she already beautiful love all her looks
Main message I get from this video: MILK products are not for medium to darker skinned black people lol moving on.....
That intro has rendered me unconscious from overlaughing. Jackie you are everything
Quick synopsis of milk cosmetics: IT AINT SHIT 😂... sept for the eye creams and gloss lol.
lol milk rarely works for people who want full beat 24/7. its a natural look brand
This is your expectations of what your going to look like when you spend 1000 dollars at Sephora and use it all together at home
Never seen any of your videos-noticed this in trending videos-clicked video- not disappointed. You gained a subscriber
I saw this line TODAY in sephora and loved it for the main reason you found it lackluster: I'm a minimalist 😂😂😂. But because your critique was fair nonetheless, I actually now feel more compelled to buy products from this line. Lastly, I LOVE this look. I know it's different from your norm, but it's very representative of the face that someone like me does on a regular basis to work in a corporate environment or even on a date night. THIS to me is a BEAT face. Thanks for doing this look!!! 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
I just feel like this makeup slid off your face the minute u walked outside into the heat!!!!! auntie jackie please tell us how it wore!!!
LORD, the whole time I was cringing cause the makeup looked so unflattering :(((( It looked like MUD and the finished didn't tie together as usual. It literally looked like you were sweating :// the skin part was a mess. The eyes were the neatest. Those natural lashes are BEASTS. wow
Loved this! \nI returned the foundation it sat weird on my face and separated. It was a mess.
That mascara is exactly what I’ve been looking for !!! Going to buy right now!
“MILK YOU NEED SOME MILK” 😂😂😂
Jackie I'm here for your vids ma 😂 keep em coming
aunt jack....LIVINGGGG FOR YOUR LASHES
Thank you. You made my shitty day.
JACKIE
And..... TOILET PAPER!!!!
I love you
That mascara RUINED my makeup!!!!!!!! So messy

Why
That matte foundation is STILL shiny. Jeeze!!
Giiiirl that concealer was stressing me out!!
You judged me into subscription 😂😂
TRENDING! 🙌🏽
They need colors for milk chocolate goddesses!!!
Jackie calm the fuck down
and... you're still an ugly nigger
On the light spectrum they all look alike. I feel like unless you fall perfectly in the medium tone range looking for the perfect match is just an exercise in how to remain calm when you just want to meltdown.

my only complaint about the Macbook hub is that it wont fit/work if you have a case on it ... you have to remove the case to put the hub on
That scooter looks ugly as hell
Yay another video of things I will never be able to afford
We humans are nothing but material. There is nothing more to life but material products. We work for them until we die. Rinse and repeat
Has enough to buy these crazy figurines and unnecessary tech but can't get out of a 1 bedroom apartment 🤦‍♂️ I hope everyone watching doesn't become like him and tries to fill up every single corner of your house/room with unnecessary tech.
Everytime he says actually, take a drink and see if you can ACTUALLY make it to the end of this video?
Who the fuck is holding the camera

20,400 mAh for 250$? You must be out of your mind.
You and Dave2d are my favorite tech channels by far. Keep up the great content! 😗😀
Can you compare the specs of your new gaming laptop to the Xbox One X? For half the price I think they are remarkably close with the exception of the X1X not being upgradable.
I have a 30000 charger, that's pretty weak these days to be honest. And for $250?! No way.
Ya boi trending ohh
They way this ad was made make me want to buy it..
I miss it even though it was 4 years ago...
it's funny because it's true!!!
Actually this machine is pretty cool.
Isn’t it pyjamas and not pajamas?
I hope everyone saw the Illuminati symbol on “You hate working out”
My home gym consist of a squat rack, bench, barbell, dumbells, dip belt, and an arm blaster. I love working out regardless of where sometimes I’ll even run to the park just to exercise.
*looks at gym equipment gaining dust*\nI should work out again.......\n\nI'll start tommorow
i dont remember the word pajama looking like that
Where's the damn phone number!!! I desperately need this man!!
You're saying you *don't* use them as sex toys?
He put the lightbulb in, while there was still electricity coursing threw it.
Why is this not a marketing campaign already?
It would have been just as funny without the profanity.
Makes me want to buy one just for all those purposes
Grant just wanted to be shirtless
this needs to be a real  commercial
Who ever did the voice kinda sounds like John Cena
Finally. College humor made a good video
So where could I get this from again?
is it just me or has Pat becum more hawt over the years
Hi I'm Roge ... oh wait, you stole his video
Fighter Workout Tip: End of the day you only NEED two things. Nice set of reasonable weight dumb bells (10 for newer folks, 20-25 goal. Higher if bigger person) and a really durable heavy bag. That and some god damn discipline is all you need to not only get your body in order, but do so in a way that gives you a very natural build. Nothing overly stressful, very little chance of injury unless you're a fucking imbecile, and exceptionally relaxing afterwards. I'm telling you, NOTHING like just going apeshit on a heavybag to make a shitty day a bit better. Put in what you want to get out. 5-10 minutes a day, or a few hours. You got that shit either way.
Guy with pink nipples is just weird. I know it’s quite common among Caucasian’s because I dated a few pink white girls, but I just can’t imagine how it feels to be a guy with pink nipples...
Cant relate. I love working out.
I'd fucking buy this thing immediately
Intruding into a No Flex zone?\n\nThey knooooow better. They knooooow better.
This is so accurate it's making me rethink my life
This is a funny idea and is totally true, so why am I not laughing. I've been wondering about this in their last few videos.
i watched this to help motivate me to workout and by the end i am eating chips on the couch.
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
Damn, I didn't know College Humor was still around.  They've been around for years. I forgot about them.
Where do I sign
I hate the no flex now all my close are ripped
Why didn’t I get this in my sub box
That's a shitty apartment?
If you wear Jordan shorts and an X-Large Nike short nobody will notice you don't workout.
Can I actually buy that, I'll pay it off
Most machines are ass, they don't build stability muscles. I prefer to lift my own American stomach fat up and down.
I thought the machine could talk and would insult you as you used it
Exercise clothes make the best pajamas
Lower the volume of the background music. It was a bit too loud
I this a joke
Where do I buy this?
This was hilarious, because it hit way too close to home. My mom has an ab lounger that she's never taken out of the box. I'm so used to it partially blocking the hallway that I step around it subconsciously. It's a really great cat pedestal.
Why do people hate working out? I can never get it.
I now want to buy a work out machine, and never use it...
You're so cute. Can we go on a date?
My dad uses it for a hanger at his house
College humor has really fallen from grace
I legit thought this was keith from try guys
Before you watch this, here is the answer to the video's title:  Don't
I actually thought this was an ad and tried to skip it
How long till we get another troopers episode,love the skits yall do but would love to seen another episode of troopers.
Yes! That is exactly right! \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Finally an episode that is not liberal propaganda.
GRANT, YOU'RE TOO FUCKING TALL!
Grant is so hot 😂😍
Just Give Us Your Fucking Money!
this videa is awesome, snl quality all the way, you are great collegehumor
I feel like CH made this video specially for me and it´s their way to tell me to move my fat ass to the gym...
… \n\nI know it's supposed to make fun of his height..\n\nBut with all those freeballing shots in his underwear.. \n\nI think it was just to see his bulge..
You should do an it themed skit but for adults and it represents what adults are afraid of and it's commitment being sober and debt
I'm too embarresed to try new machines at the gym so I just do treadmill and leave
I just don't know how I lived without this. :)
This channel is going to shit
This is so true
Thought this was a new idubbbz video from the thumbnail :'(
It's the first time that thhe writer didn't do the outro!!! What happened?!?! :OO
Lol! I'm bigger than that guy and I'm 15 years old.
This was too real to be funny
This video helped me find an excuse to stop working out at the gym 😉

I love seeing you with your shirt off.\nOf course I'm being sarcastic and your naked body makes me throw up !\nLater I'm going to drink, in hopes, I will forget that revolting image, but if that doesn't work, I'm just going to keep stabbing my brain \nuntil I do.\n☺
I feel I'm too old to say this but Carrie I've watched these watch me Wednesday's since the start and to sit and watch your relationship with Oliver Develop over time has been magical. Yous are so good for eachother- whether that's friendship or dating that's none of our business
Is it sad I sit and have the biggest smile on my face every time carrie & Oliver have 'moments' 😩🙌🏽👌🏽❤️
still wishing i can watch you in singapore!! if only time allowed it.
Watch me Wednesday are my favorite videos!
These videos are always such a joy!
Carrie, where is that War Of The World's statue!??!
I'm sure both Carrie and Oliver don't want to confirm whether they're dating or not until Addams is finished. They obviously don't want anything to ruin what they have at the moment ❤️
Bake off is legit the best way to end the night of shows. My husband and I do the same thing! Mary and Paul all day.
Your attitude and stance is just so great because I feel you are making unbelievably so much efforts so that everyone can understand what you feel :) it's impossible to do that without massive love to everyone. I always respect you girl! I really hope someday I can come to see you performing from Japan!! Love xxxx
since when did carrie rebranded, i don't really watch her that much but i was scrolling through my subscriptions and i was like wOAH when did this happen?
Did anyone else hear a kiss noise when there was the shot of fried eggs?
Hi Carrie, my girlfriend is a really big fan of yours and Ive tried to send you a letter but it got returned to me as the addressee wasn't there, is therr a time you will definitely be there to receive mail? Love the video btw!
Hi Carrie I saw you in chitty chitty bang bang  last year and the Adams family this year in sheffield. When I saw the the ads nd family Scott was playing uncle fester. After the show I went to stage door to  meet you but you didn't come out but I met Oliver and Samantha if was amazing,. I love your video you make me cry with laughter love you loads love from Grace xxxxx ❤❤❤
Where is 'It'swaypastmybedtime' she changed the name.
Oliver reminds me of Jack Harris a little bit
We are doing Addams Family for our school music. I’m trying out for puglsy, do you have any tips?
I would love to see Scott as Fester but I'm a bit worried about Les! He has been off for ages. Hope he is doing okay. I'm seeing the show in Glasgow! Can't wait to see a vlog there if you do one ☻
I use to sing the song they were singing at the beginning with my choir, and I loved it :)
I love watching these... I literally watch these for the costumes so I can design costumes based off them for my production of Addams. Everything is so amazing here, thank you for showing us these Carrie. I know all of us in my production of Addams love your videos
I love your videos! You're wonderful! xxx
The guy you were singing with on the stairs has taught me at my drama school loads!
Can't wait to see you perform in the Grand in October! I went to see the English Youth Ballet today and it was brilliant, then I bought tickets to see The Addams Family and I realised at half time that you were performing!! It was a great surprise
Hi Carrie. I saw you at the stage door today. I was the one that probably looked very nervous. (I was wearing a pink dress)\nI loved your performance. You were amazing!
I watched it today and it was amazing!! So glad I saw it!
All small YouTube's let's all help eachother out.sub to me and comment done. Then ill sub to you
I saw your show in Sheffield for my 7 year anniversary, you were amazing! I heard every word right from the back, and I thought you were the best singer by far.
My school's doing Addams Family this year, and I love watching these videos and hearing about your experience with the show. It's one of the reasons why I'm so excited to do it!
I'm so sad cause I was meant to be seeing it tonight but it turns out I can't come, and I really wanted to come see it cause the last time I saw you perform was in les mis and you're my favourite west end actress :(❤️❤️
I'm guessing you never know when you're going to stage door because I'll be seeing Addams family on Wednesday (oohhh) and I would love to see you at stage door but of course I get it if you aren't there
The warmup is always my favourite part of these vlogs
I came to the wednesday show in working with my school and you were absolutely incredible!!!!
ok im shocked by how long your hair has grown. i got used to seeing you with a wig or in a bun
I get so excited when a new video comes up! How many more Watch Me Wednesday's are there?
Awww I LOVE this video Carrie. I love watching the behind the scenes of all the work it takes to put on a touring theatre show omg xxx
i KNEW my hair was growing super slow compared to usually. You confirmed it coz I cut my hair about the same length shortly after you did. And I've been thinking that my hair has grown SO slowly than usual, and now I've been confirmed.
Hey guys please subscribe to my channel ❤️❤️
Awww Carrie watching you meet all the people at stage door made my heart so happy, one of my travel goals in life is to see one of your shows and hopefully meet you one day but WELL DONE THIS WAS A GOOD EPISODE ❤
I sat in the same seat that Oliver is in last time I went to the Sovereigns. Huh.. Oooh!. I went to see the show at 5 on Friday (29th) at Woking. You were amazing, Oliver was amazing, Scott was amazing. 'Full Disclosure', I loved it.
Your video is the 7 most trending video on YouTube atm!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
You & Oliver are actual friendship goals <3
Anyone else REALLY want to hear the inappropriate things that Oliver said? 😂
Why dafuq is this trending 6th, it has 56k views?????!!!!
Hahah I love the ending :'D
Aaah! I went to see the first show on Friday! I was like, middle, top in the audience. My mind is blown that you were filming somewhere I walk past several times a week. The sovereigns is a great pub - opposite the cycle shop on the corner and a walking distance from the station. I recognise the party shop because it's the shop which opens at weird times and is almost always empty. It's so weird! The chips \nin the sovereign are good tho! Anyway, the show was aammaazing!! If you guys haven't watched it, I suggest you do. It's amazing. My fave bit is whenever you pulled the creepy eyebrow slanty face thingy. Anyway, thank you again!! 😃😃
Your hair is lovely!!!
Did anyone else notice the kissing-sound around 6.58 or was that just me????
I am dying to fly to Singapore for the show!! But I live in Hong Kong (which is not that far if you consider Europe) and I have school :/ Will you be in the Singaporean tour? love you!  (also, will try to watch this ten times more to figure out what Oliver was saying) cheers x
I CANT WAIT for you guys to come to singapore :'')
I love that everyone has beer and then there's Carrie's wine glass hahahh that's absolutely me
I saw you in Cardiff Carrie and I'm seeing you again tonight, can't wait!! Break a leg to all!!
I would hope Captain America would be a bit more sure of himself 😂😂😂
Oliver trying an American accent sounds so much like Captain Jack Harkness omg
I love your friendship with everyone!! It’s so great to watch <3
I understand why but sometimes I'm so sad your channel is PG because I need to know what Oliver said in the pub
Carrie! Don't use wipes to get your makeup off. Use the Camomile Cleansing Butter from The Body Shop. It's not harsh on your skin at all and it gets rid off your make up very easily. It's also cruelty free and so much better for the environment than those wipes! x
Are you the only one from the original U.K. Cast going to Singapore? 🙃
Hunnyyy you’re hairs getting so long it’s gorgeous!!
Ah you went to my local! Good old Sovs.
❤Great video 😁 Please check out our small YouTube channel and subscribe if you like the content ❤
can't wait to watch you in Singapore!\nhope i can see you as well! I dont remember Mediacorp Theatre having a stage dooor
Are you actively trying to grow your hair out again or is it because too busy to get a hair cut? Also, loved seeing the after hours!
I’m really going to miss the Carrie and Oliver show when Addams Family is over. You guys make me giggle. 💕
Hi Carrie! Just a quick question for you and your cast mates. My school is starting our own production of the Addams family and I was thinking if any of you had any advice for playing your characters or tips for making things more fun/enjoyable in these cooky and spooky roles. If you do, I'm sure we'd love to hear from you amazing actors! Thank you and have a lovely day <3
CRAZY FOR YOU I FREAKED OUT WHEN I HEARD IT my friend was just in the musical
So many media interviews will leave you PRESSED for time!
Watching you Scott and Oliver just makes me happy 😊 ❤️ xx
Carrie, did Oliver share the After Eights I gave him for you all on Thursday night at stage door? :D
UK stage doors are so chill I expected ear drum bursting screams but overall it was quite quiet
I'm sure you've already tried it but coconut oil is amazing at getting make up off. :)
Ooh are you going on tour to Singapore too? That's exciting! :D\nSo looking forward to seeing the show in Glasgow!
I have to say it's weird to watch you be at my home town! Also sovereigns is definitely one of the nicer pubs in woking! Watched the show on Tuesday so didn't see you at stage door
You are so sweet at the stage door! A true inspiration. I would love to meet you one day!
I'm two subs away from 425 PLEASE help me reach it, I ONLY NEED 2 MORE SUBS!!\n\nCHEERS GUYS!
She's like our own little celebrity! Lol xoxo
My mum came up to Bristol last weekend to see the show with me on Sat evening, it was bloody amazing! Thank you so much to you and the rest of the cast for putting on an awesome show!! Big love <3
Omg I love the ending 😂❤
Hey I saw you tonight in Woking and you were absolutely insane. Keep doing what you’re doing because you and the rest of the cast were incredible xxxx
without sounding too much like regina george, I LOVE your jumper, where did you get it? (but seriously, the grey one, I love it).
Why are the running times announced after the show?
Carrie to get your makeup COMPLETELY off invest in come cotton pads and micellar water. Properly wet 2 cotton pads with the micellar water and use that to take all of your makeup off like a makeup wipe, works a treat!! Xx
I remember the video, where you cut your hair! It is like yesterday, but no! Your hair is long again o. O
I’ll forever love you Carrie. Please check your Insta inbox from athina_alice xxx
I JUST GOT BACK FROM YOUR SHOW IN WOKING CARRIE YOU WERE AMAZING ALSO PLEASE ASK FESTER IF HES OK AFTER HE BUMPED HIS HEAD ON THE DOOR FRAME BECAUSE IM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT WASNT PLANNED AND IM A CONCERNED FAN (real talk though you were all amazing and I absolutely loved it from start to finish, I wish you all the best!!!!)
I’ve officially made it! Finally in one of your videos Carrie! Glad you loved the necklace my friend made you! ❤️
Carrie are you growing your hair long again (i was just wandering)\nP.s you were in the first les mis show my mum wached
Ollie is just the most precious gem ❤❤ i adore you both
In all seriousness what are you and Oliver gonna do when addams is over 😔 yous still need to see eachother 😩🙏🏼
I'm going to be subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribes to my channel! Comment when done (legit)
I know Steven lol.
Bake off traitors 😛😉
Is Samantha womwick eg Ronnie Mitchell eastenders the mum
Oliver's dance omg
oh gosh, your poor skin! :D
What your funniest moment on stage
lol love it :)
Wonderful 🤗😘
<3
It's so strange to me how stage door works for the west end. In almost any venue on broadway in New York,or on a tour,there's a barrier and the actor walks down the line and says hey to everybody.
Oliver does a pretty good American accent. Speaking of, could you do a video where you talk with one, at least the parts where it's just you talking to the camera? I'm curious what that sounds like lol.
but wheres pete
Nice to see he wants to stay thank god
A good manager, making positive steps..\nI hope Kane continues as he is too. For England and Spurs!
Western populations should shed their illusions. Our governments are committing war crimes and imposing an overseas holocaust on non-belligerent countries. The West and its allies are terrorizing and destroying countries and they are falsely projecting their own high crimes onto their victims.
I know you never care about drama and you are usually on everyones sides. But don't be leaving your Youtube account on while LeLe is around, you don't know when one of your most popular videos might go ''missing'' . . .
my mum has the we can do it picture
First time watching. You're so funny
Good to know this is an international phenomenon ❤
All subscribed youtuber in one video...love u all...muach
Once in middle school my girlfriends and me spent 30 minutes in the bathroom. And the teacher caught us, we got detention. 💧we cried a lot in the bathroom, because of our looks and feelings, SINGLE PRINGLES.

Like I said Lilly I love you but putting lele in this video makes me feel differently about how you see girl on girl love
Girl you are beautiful, don't let the remarks about your weight get to you. Just focus on being healthy and happy.
Thank you Bubz for these “little doses of happiness.” Even when I’m in a dark place I can click your videos and immediately smile and laugh. So grateful to have been here through the years 💕☺️
I was drinking hot chocolate at 5:24 😐
I've been watching your beauty & vlog channels for years and something I've always been fascinated with is your beautiful skin!! please give me your skin!
Filipinos are super direct, as well... It's a blessing and a curse. You're beautiful, Bubz. <3
Is... is Ayla's head actually as big as Isaac's??
Not just a Chinese thing, its an Asian thing xD My aunt kept calling me fat when when it's time to eat she always gives me a large amount of rice and sides.
Wow I never realized how much I missed your hong kong apartment and stuff. It's so nostalgic xD
oh god i was eating my meal when i start hearing bubz talking about her 'accident' i had to stop eating LOL! my brain was just visualizing what happened >.< LOL!
Don't feel bad Bubz. I did it today when I sneezed. At least I was at home but, I had to throw away my favorite under wear. I knew you wouldn't like that because you used to hoard your underwear. lol So don't feel bad. Your hubby can get the car detailed. No worries.
I wished the directness of Asian families were limited to directing comments to family members only. I cannot even try to count the amount of times I wanted to dig a hole and bury myself in the ground when my grandmother called my friends fat or not pretty. Thank you for sharing that with the world I makes me feel a little better that my grandmas not the only one who does it.
THE HONG KONG KITCHEN GIVES ME FEELS
lindy. I did have period incidents which was awfully sad and bad. I understand you might have felt bad but it already happened you can't go back to past. It'll be alright. Take care.
Bubz you are such a cool mum... !
Haha Cubans are direct too! The first thing they say is, Omg you're so fat! Or You're too skinny, you need to eat!
Isaac is such a lovely boy
Bubz!! You guys seem so much happier in Hong Kong! I hope you guys are able to stay for a while! 💗
Awk tim is so sweet😩 get you a man like tim ;)
I guess you can call it a crappy situation XD Sorry I'll let myself out lol I'm sorry you had to go thru that  that's so embarrassing. Hope you feel better <3
Had a moment looking back of seeing baby Isaac having a bath , but quickly remembered it's really Alya instead 👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻👶🏻
I'm sorry bubz but I choked with laughter. I can just imagine the scene. The car must've smelt real bad.... 🙂
what better way to say it than sh*t happens lol its ok Bubz
Bubz your so real and I love You! I appreciate your authenticity so much and you always make me feel so much better after I watch your vids. Thank you!!!!!  : ) ♡♡♡
Ayla has the same arm rolls as Isaac when he was a baby...so cute!!
Aww it's okay Lindy, I had a fecal accident once too. I had a horrible stomach flu and it just happened... In my ex in laws house... It got all over the bathroom floor... It was awful 😑
lol that reminds me of Charlottes accident in the Sex in the City Movie hahahahahaha
Better having the accident in the car rather than spilling as you walk past the security man ^_^.
Bubz I love how open and honest you are. Lol it happens to everyone we’re human. It’s normal haha🤷🏾‍♀️
It’s an Asian thing to be chunky lol
that was the same place where Isaac had his first taste of apple juice and had that sugar rush
Don't worry, Bubz, you are not alone! I drank soo much water in a marathon last year and the traffic when I was getting home was just SO SLOW  that I basically peed myself in the elevator going back home. Me, a healthy 21 years old woman. Believe me, you will laugh like crazy about this in the future (or at least Tim will, I know my bf does).
The relief I felt when it wasn't something serious but at the same time the trauma I can't deal
Bubz there's no such thing as TMI on here we know nearly everything 😂
Aww don’t worry my mom did that twice
its okay we have all been there
his talking has progressed so much!! hope you're less worried now bubz
Just tell everybody that if you lose your baby weight too fast you re going to have suuuuper loose skin so you have to lose it slowly,plus you only gave birth two months ago so they should just let it go !
awww! I've missed your vlogs at your Hong Kong apartment!!
Its okay lindy xD you gave birth, I heard it weakens everything down below!\n\nAlso I wont tried to force a far to disgust my boyfriend and I sharted.. he just died of laughter
It's ok Bubz. My husband tried to fart one night and ended up crapping himself too.
Idk why, but I miss you guys living in Hong Kong!
Those near misses seem to always happen to you in Hong Kong. It must be something you eat there that causes such an extreme reaction. Investigate and don't worry too much :*
I've had this experience before, and it's terrible. I think you should have just stopped at the nearest restroom instead of trying to drive all the way to the hotel. If we had tried to make it to our hotel, we wouldn't have made it,  but luckily we stopped by the first restaurant on our way to use the restroom.
Korean people are the same lmao. When I visited my family in Korea my great aunt was like, You gained SOOOOOO much weight when it was the end of the trip. I'm in Korea, lady! I'm gonna eat everything!! xD
It happens to the best of us. Haha i miss HK...
Issac is so cute. I died <3<3<3
This is why i love bubz😂 and its not just Chinese relatives even Indian relatives do that a lot.
I am so glad you are okay...I was in an accident once, wasn't even hurt, and I cried...
And people went off at Tim for not being willing to oil your perineum.... but this was true love!!! No longer can YouTube comments say he doesn't love you and isn't a great husband!!
so excited for this channel to reach 1 million <3
You're so real I love it 😂 x
i read isaac's shirt wrong :) i thought it said 'my mummy is chaotic' but it says 'my mummy is magic'
Your fine the way you are!! Your beautiful. Dont let others get you down
Does anyone know whether there is an issue with the weight of Ayla? She seems hugely puffy. Is that normal or was that addressed in a prior vlog?
Hi bubz I'm from hong kong😀❤
Watching your vlogs makes me miss hong kong even more, especially bc you live in the same area 😭😭😭
Isaac is so cutteeeeeee. I havent watched in a while I love how much hes talking
Bubz, just to make you feel better... it happened to me as well and i`m 27! I was walking from point A to point B for 20 minutes and was dying to go to the toilet but couldn't find one. You`ll be fine ;)
Awww bubz!  Everyone has sh*t themselves once or twice.  Usually its a mistaken fart!  😂😂😂😂😂
Don't worry about it bubz, it's actually more common than you think. Once your pelvic muscles have recovered and strengthened it will be fine. Also I know what you mean about the culture difference. In Uganda relatives will be very direct and outspoken on things like weight (but then expect you to eat a lot too haha)
So I'm flying to Hong Kong tomorrow ahaha ummm
Hahahaha the same thing happened to me bubz! Lol and IT WAS AT SCHOOL! But luckily nobody was there because it was outside the toilet in class time ;) was still kinda embarassing lol
Why you need to go to HK this often?
Lol was walking with my grandma the other day and she goes time to lose weight and I went me or you?  (jokingly) and she replies obv not me. Im already skinny enough 😂😂 gotta love Chinese folks
Try a comotomo bottle. That’s what I used when I was breastfeeding my son and would feed him expressed milk. It’s large and kind of mimics the breast. It also has a silicone body so who ever is feeding baby can gently squeeze it and it will mimic milk let down.\n\nI got mine on amazon. Here is a link. \n\nComotomo Natural Feel Baby Bottle, Pink, 5 Ounces https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004C053B0/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_3yj0zbXFJ75WW
Ohh been there your not the only one
😂😂😂 definitely a milestone!!! I've been on the verge before so it's bound to happen 😂 also Hispanics tend to be the same specifically the older generations 😅
yay! she is in hong kong again \ni loveeeee watching her vlogs when she is in hk because i love the smile on her face and moreover i an too in hk so its cool to see my hometown to be vlogged by a beautiful and talented youtuber
Isaac <3
Oh my gosh Isaac is so well mannered! So cute!
OMG, BUBZ!
Awwwe I miss that apartment
you meant Japanese bbq, right?
Awwwh :( it happens i guess! :( bless you jahahaha
It's okay,  we've all been there. I hope you feel better.
I love how bubz went from introducing make-up sponges to baby shower sponges hahaha
Bubz! Dont you worry about your weight! You are perfect the way you are! ♥️
Awww Bubz! \nThings happen! I also have pooped myself twice, which is super embarrassing! >.<
LOL it's not embarrassing but it is funny!\nWe all get sick, it happens.
I had one of those accidents in a mall once... it was terrible
my boyfriend broke up with me ( we were together for almost 4 years) and i'm so broken. thanks for the smile through my tears :,)
No shame bubz! It happened to me once when I had the stomach flu at a friends house, one of the worst days eveeeer!
Lmfao!!! Lindy good luck next time with the toilet 😂😂😂😂
hey! I’m a new youtuber Just released a new video on my channel - would love if anyone could check out and subscribe and I’ll do the same back! Xx
Relationship goals, crapping your pants and your s.o not giving a shit. What a cuties you all are! <3
That happened to me after having my son!!! Don't feel bad! I was mortified at first but now I laugh. It's can be a part of having a baby. Don't be embarrassed!! You'll laugh about it later.
Aww loved Isaac's shirt My mummy is MAGIC <3 <3 <3
Bubz, little question : where did you bought that cover (when you were breastfeeding Ayla in restaurant)? Thank you for answer in advance :)
What are those sponges called? I need to get them for my niece. She's chubby like Ayla. Haha
Isaac is the sweetest! Asking you if you're not well 😭 what a sweetheart!
I kinda knew she was going to say sge pooed herself before I even watched the video. 😂😂
How you know you're an adult = When you accidentally poo yourself.\n\nSeriously, everyone does it. Don't worry Bubz.
YOU GOT SO BIG\nMe: but she's so thin....
Also, you may not be the same size you were but you look beautiful and healthy!
Doesnt matter, she's magic. According to Issac's shirt that is ;P
Ohh dear 😂😂😂 poor Bubz xx
I never laughed so much looool
<3
Sending love ❤️
The situation that happened in the car.. I think it’s normal hahaha. How do u control diarrhoea....... it’s maximised urgency. I can understand!! Hahaha

Gfy helen right.. MARC BOLAN CREATED SHITTY BOWIE HE WAS BIGGER. Sort yourself out.\nLove you lots
Write a script, and keep to it so you don't do jump cuts every 3 seconds.
You buy a lot... Often
I love watching these vacuous materialistic first world toxic videos. Fab.
What would you wish for? (No extra wishes! (or genies!))
Pants with pockets\nBen understands girl's problems.
It's... A KIDS MOVIE
When you talked abt the cave having an ear piercing, I immediately answered your question with claire's
The whole point of the movie was that it doesn't matter where you come from, how rich you are, what you wear, etc., but that your actions are what define you. Princes are humans just like alladin or jafar, so a prince's clothes are really what make him a prince. That doesn't really matter though because alladin turns out to be somewhat more than a prince by deciding he doesn't want to be one again.
I would wish that the X-men were real, and then wish to be one of them...
I'd wish for my girls pussy to taste like yakult
i'll wish for the powers of a genie
i would wish for: 1- Cancer to disappear entirely, not just for a cure. 2- *does best trump impression*: billions and billions of dollars. 3- idk
The carpet is the first victim of the cave in the original tale. He cave didn't kill him, it turned him into a magic carpet. That's why the carpet wants to help him in the first place, he wants to escape his prison.
I would wish for genie’s powers...no not to be a genie just to have all of his wish granting powers. Since I wouldn’t be a genie, all of the limitations that go along with it like the number limitation, the not killing, not resurrecting, not forcing people to fall in love would be nonexistent. I wouldn’t have to serve any kind of master, nor would I have to stay for all eternity in a lamp waiting for someone to release me. I could release the genie that gave me my powers without using any more wishes because the power would be mine. Basically, I would have all the strengths of a genie and none of the weaknesses. It would be sweet ass.
When this analogy is applied to a person it means that the person has great potential but is roughand unpolished, but with hard work the true potential of the individual can be discovered. The phrase “diamond in the rough” may also refer to someone who is genuine and valuable inside but has a rough exterior.
didn't he use the last wish to set genie free?
Read the original story, it answers all these questions (jk, no it doesn't at all, except some of them, but it is amazingly weird).
When it comes to the cave, I think part of it has to do with intention. Like, the guy who had to slit the throats to get the scarabs obviously would have tried to steal something for his own evil purposes. Aladin and Abu were not. When Aladin was touching the carpet, he wasn't trying to steal it, he just stepped on it. But then when Abu tried to steal the gem, that's when the lava defense system was activated. \n\nAlso, I watched a video explaining how when Jafar started making it wishes, it some how undid Aladin being a prince and that when Genie was going on about 'tell her the truth' it wasn't that he should tell her that he wasn't a prince but that he was indeed poor 'street rat' when they first met ( because even after Jazmine finds out who he was, he still pretends that he was always rich ). I don't remember exactly what was said, but I swear it made sense.\n\nAnd if would be really mean if Jazmine took the lamp to start making wishes. That would really be taking advantage of the genie. Even if she was wishing things like make sure Jafar never comes back, it would still be kind of selfish and takinng advantage of genie's sacrifice. What I never understood is why couldn't genie make aldin a prince AFTER he was set free? Like, he still has genie powers, so why can't he, out of his own free will, make Aladin a prince again?\n\nI realize there are still some plot holes, but I feel this fills in a few of them.
Since when did Disney make send
Supercarlinbrothers would be good at cinema sins *ting*
What if alladin was never the chosen one at all. What if the chosen one was abu
1. All my wish work perfectly the way I want. \n2. to always have enough money for what I want to buy.\n3. to have the ability to communicate with all lifeforms
I would wish that Trump grew up with a mother like the mother from the TV show Empire, Cookie and she would beat his ass and teach him how to act right... That is all 😁
I actually really like this movie. Aladdin is one of my favorite Disney movie.
For overpopulation to not be a problem we have to worry about\nFor everyone in the world to stop discriminating each other (world peace would just be weird, seriously, think about it)\nand then one selfish thing here: For me and my friends who are going to Anime Detour to get all of our cosplay stuff free, and the tickets free
Essentially Jafar canceled out Aladdin's wish of being a prince. It wasn't just revealing oh hey he is just some street rat. Jafar took it all away from him too. How this was not a wish I don't know, I think he used his own powers to do it. That's why the Genie is like wish again and I will make it happen, it would have to be a new wish.
I always thought if I ever got a magic lamp I would use my wishes give it my friend she will user hers then she can give it back to me  like I know I am being selfish but I don't care free wishes for daysss
For the genie to have amnesia after making me in charge so I have unlimited wishes ;)
You do realize Aladdin is taken from the story Arabian Nights which was created by a Syrian story teller in the early 13th century??? then later translated by antoine galland to french/english.... it's an OLD story... of course it won't be 100% realistic
6:54 I saw that hesitation. You were rethinking yourself. Even so, your idea of Aladdin giving Jasmine the lamp was actually a good idea.
Wish 1) make me and keep at 21.\nWish 2) nothing.\nWish 3) nothing.
1.) I would wish that whenever I saw something I wanted that costed money, the amount of money it costs would appear in my pocket.\n\n2.) I would wish to meet Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun. \n\n3.) I would wish that schools actually taught things that we need in the real world.
he should chose hamilton he a dimond  in the rough
I'd wish for the ability to always have the exact amount of money to pay for something when I reach into my pocket.
He steps on it! He probably stepped on a lot of coins! He meant don't steal anything calm down
1. Understand every language\n2. Unlimited money\n3. To change my appearance to whatever I want
just realised ben looks like a young peter balish from GOT
I LOVE Aladdin- don’t get me wrong. But I’ve always thought the carpet thing!
carpets are expensive, and most of those don't even fly! most? What carpets are you buying and where can I get some??!!!
...does he not understand the less literal meaning of the word ‘buy’. aladdin isnt actually buying anything, he is saying he doesn’t believe or understand that.
Ben when you said that every time Aladdin lies to jasmine, instead of saying the big blue feather you said the big purple feather when it is blue
This is gonna sound cheesy but 3 wishes: \nFor my friends' lives to be relatively stress free \nFor my best friend's health issues to fuck off\nFor my mom to lose custody of my sister \n(Let's pretend the genies wouldn't fuck it up lmao)
Just saw the musical. It fixes like all those problems.
Buy that means he doesn't agree with that
The book makes more sense.
Why is Aladdin the diamond in the rough?\n\n\n\nMaybe watch Once Upon A Time to find out. Youll get your answer then.
He is only robbing because he has NOTHING to pay them with and is so poor that he doesn't have money
The line \nI don’t buy that has nothing to do with shopping
That would depend on the kind of genie, but if you were talking about the genie Aladen in that would be kind of easy. 1 to always have the exact amount of money I need in my pocket. 2 the perfect or near perfect body that needs no upkeep. 3 and my dream house.
do you know that the original ending in Aladdin was that the seller was the genie  but it was lost in the production and would cost a lot  of money so they changed it
The Genie thing drove me crazy
I know I'm putting to much thought into it, but what does Genie do to make Aladdin a prince? All we see is a parade. Where does all of the money, the people, and the animals come from? Can Genie create life? To be a prince don't you have to be a ruler or a son of a ruler to be one? Don't you need a actual kingdom to be prince of like Jafar asked and never brought up ever again?
Nah, keeping Jasmine alive and marrying her would be ideal, because it'd have helped secure his right to the thrown in the eyes of the people and foreign nations, and he'd have the benefit of potentially fathering successors of royal blood.  Not necessary, of course, but this sort of thing is a safety net in the long-term.
Ummmm.... Isn't he technically the prince of thieves? So he was always a prince anyway?
I would wish for a large number of people (as in tens of thousands, at least), including myself, to be turned to full health.\nIf I were the only one then people might grow suspicious but if there are thousands of people healed, how could anyone figure out who was responsible?
Watch Twisted by StarkidPotter!!!!!! Its amazing and actually dives into these problems with this story!
It's all a story to buy the crappy lamp from the beginning of the movie.
You guys need to check out Twisted:the untold story of a royal vizier
Ben would be great at cinemasins
This changed my perspective of the film
A diamond in the rough? Maybe Hamilton will enter? ok I'll go now
i WISH YOU WOULD DO A COLLAB WITH THE THEORIZER OH SHOOT I LEFT CAPS LOCK ON
I would wish for the power to grant myself any wish aka unlimited power
Listen to the musical.\nListen to it now. \nITS A-FREAKING-MAZING!!!!\nDo it.
Yess ok I would wish my sister to my side then tell her my plan I would then wish myself in an all powerful genie and give her the lamp now she has three whishes and my lamp she whishes me to be free. Now Ima a free all powerful genie she whishes the genie to become an all powerful genie and give me back the lamp me being free I now have control of her lamp and the geinie get both of te free with one wish from each and boom .three all powerful genies with no limitation except we can’t make anyone fall in love brink people back from the dead or kill anyone 😂😂😂 best this I have the biggest loop hole ever found and I know I can widh for these thing Becuase jafar did this
The reason Aladdin isn't a prince is because when he wished for Genie to MAKE him a prince not become a prince, All Genie does is makes sure that Jasmine and Aladdin marry so Aladdin becomes a Prince
you guys should sell a towel that says towel section on it.
1. To be a famous actresses\n2. Big house\n3. I have color power
Can somebody explain the end of Ghost world to me pls?? Btw, it would be great if they make a video explaining it.
In the Broadway show, Jasmine sings that strange line,
It’s a kids movie. Nothing makes sense.
this is great😂
Dude. Caste System.
3 wishes...? Thas too many
Ben Carlin would be great at CinemaSins! *ding*
Infinit money
Buy also means accept, so he's basically saying that he doesn't accept everyone calling him a street rat
I'd wish for kingdom hearts III
I don't know what to do... My best friend... Says Toy Story 3 sucks ;-;
Did you ever realize that Toy Story and The Secret Life of Pets are more or less the same story?
I would wish for more magic lamps that just happen to have genies inside them
Infinite money to poor people
First wish was to not have my mental illnesses so I could not be burdened by my depressing and anxiety..so I can enjoy life more. Second was to be a billionaire (so I could do good for the world, invest in important causes, stocks etc.. improve economy), and last wish would be to be impervious to death for 500 years. To make sure my investments continued to go to good causes.
Id simply wish for enough money to make all my wishes come true. Paradox wishing bitches. This way i can buy whatever i want and i have two wishes left i can use for stuff money cant buy.
The film is based on the Aladdin and the enchanted lamp story from a Thousand and One Nights. It makes sense. Disney just stripped it down to kids movie level.
your woody toy on the shelf moved in the video....slightly...rewatch it but focus on woody😨
i would wish for no rules and then a lot of wishes and a puppy
I wish for infinite magic caves
Lmao at the people who dont realize the intro was a joke
I agree there are some things that don't make sense, but the prince thing is explained by the zapping of his clothes, I think this is to imply that he reverses that wish :)
if I had a genie I would use an old as time itself loophole in the no extra wishes rule: I wish that I could wish for more wishes.

Disney makes no sense!\n\n\n\n\n\nApparently
A baboon chatters with more sense than you do... you're like this... person.. they gave too much sugar too and rambling so fast and in so many directions... dude.. Aladdin wasn't talking about BUYING Something he was talking about not agreeing... if you actually had a brain you'd know that. Maybe you are too sugar buzzed. I'm not saying Aladdin (the movie) is perfect. But your rants make no sense.
Why do you guys have to be so fuckin nerdy?
what also makes no sense is that it seems to be like it is in India. but somehow it also seems like it is somewhere in arabia.\nor persia whatever. like some buildings and clothes are from india. and some others are things only for arabs
Btw. I always thought that , when jafar changes alladin dress, he is UNDOING the genie Wish . I remember that in dvd version there is the origibal song where he does step by step.
It's really cool that they got casey neistat to be in their thumbnail.
he would be a better president than trump
When this song was actually weirdly inspiring in a totally non ironic way. Long time fan! Thanks Mark and Co

The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!

My friend is getting me a t-shirt with that train quote on it for my birthday so thanks evan and mark for giving my friends a way to blackmail me

I FREAKING LOVE SZA
Nooo, la letra de estas nuevas canciones es muy repetitiva
it sounds like maybe i'm not the only who responds to people asking me about a show/book/movie/game that i like first with what the themes are rather than what the plot is. it's about fate and destiny and what roles we try to fill and what we can do if we break the norm!! and also, it's about a duck that turns into a girl that turns into a magical ballerina to fight evil, i guess??
I love startrek. My philosophy teacher used to have us analyze the episodes and find the meaning and the lesson.\nMade a boring subject a lot better.
This is why I don't really enjoy Mr. Robot, or at least the several episodes I sat through before giving up.
Hank's face always reminds me that Lord has created beautiful creatures
Time to watch The Expanse!! There's your informed sci fi
did you just call a soda can, coke?
I wasn't feeling any urgency to read Turtles All the Way Down until this video. I feel now that I /need/ to read it. Now I know what it is about. Thank you, Hank (and John!)\n\nAlso, West Wing ❤️
Isn’t the title supposed to tell me what the video is about?
This reminds me of the collection of star trek next generation that I had. That's got destroyed by water damage from superstorm sandy
this is why i, as someone who wasn’t old enough to watch tv in the early two-thousands and late nineties, watch almost exclusively tv shows that were popular then, like ER and West Wing, etc.
Can anyone sub to my channel?
I'm still a part of the west wing world!
Exactly! Omg, If only I could explain that to everyone who thinks that stories are only as good as the action and situation. SIgnificance is the SOUL of everything!!\nI would for-real give my life so that everyone could understand that
It’s about clickbait
Parks and Rec. Parks and Rec. Parks and Rec.
Man this and u r cutie pie. Chirp
Can I recommend The Orville?
How is inequality a problem exactly? Please explain why you are hurt if I produce more than you.
I finished watching TNG a few months ago and am two episodes away from finishing DS9. They are both fantastic series! I am so glad I decided to watch them.
It's not a Coke can, it's a soda can :D
My personal favorite What's it About? TNG episode? \nTapestry (s06e15)\nSuch a good message about owning past mistakes and appreciating how they make us who we are.\nNot for nothing, but you may have heard of the episode's writer. Dude named Ronald D Moore.
This sometimes happens when the drink freezes part way. Not enough to puncture the can, but enough to stretch it just a little. The can needs some pressure to keep its shape. Non carbonated drinks in a can are pressurized with nitrogen because it keeps the can rigid and doesn't react with the drink like the oxygen in air would.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
What about a can of apple juice! Do they use a stronger can?
We were never the West Wing world nor House of Cards world.
The Borg was one of the best created alien species ever created!

I miss these so much like just old school talkin' about shit Vlogbrothers videos.
I was very happy to find that your first pick of suggested episodes is my favorite. Drumhead is deeply moving and deeply important I implore everyone to watch it.
now i want you to play with a can of something non-carbonated.  like lemonade or something
Any friends of desoto in the audience?
YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYES. YES. YEEEEEEESSSSSSS. THAT'S WHAT STORIES ARE! THAT'S WHY THEY MATTER SO MUCH! THANK YOU HANK
I completely agree with you, these are the stories that keep me hooked. Two of these I have recently enjoyed: Sherlock (I know, late to the party) which is about the struggles of relating to each other even when the others capacity is lacking (be it emotionally or intellectually) and also how to cope with our own otherness (healthily and unhealthily). And then I went to the cinema to see Wind River (would highly recommend) which is about family, and how to be a family when the world takes it away from us, and how we can fight and be strong and still lose. And how that has to be ok, and we can still be considered strong! And how we can still keep living, even if we are broken!
I thought Hank was about to do the Magic trick called healed and sealed
you should totally watch the orville
Wow! I just realized this is a lot of the reason I tend to hate the synopses on the backs of books. Because they always tell you (maybe too much) about the plot, and never what the book means. Like I always get a little miffed when I read a really good book and go back and look at the synopsis and it makes the book sound so ordinary and shallow
Permission to speak freely sir?\n Space... The final frontier...These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: To explore strange new worlds...To seek out new life; new civilizations...To boldly go where no one has gone before!
Not only are stories about how bad the world is and how awful people are boring, they're also unrepresentative and not terribly useful. As you guys like to point out from time to time, by many metrics things are as good for humanity now as they have ever been, and things are generally getting better. That doesn't happen without a lot of good people directing the efforts of their lives in beneficial, productive ways. The people who do bad things steal the limelight and are very well-publicised because what they do is outrageous and emotive, but in fact, that too is a testament to the ongoing progress, and the ongoing victory, of the right and the good; the bad stuff wouldn't stand out otherwise.
Shaka, when the walls fell.
It might be the other way around i.e. it's because the coke can is cold... so more gas dissolves in the liquid. If it was hotter the gas would dissolve more easily into the liquid.
Hank, I would loved to know if you have seen Mother! and your thoughts on the film.
Quick way to get the video trending lol
I am also tired of watching TV shows that are just dark and I do not care about any of the characters
I'm deeply bothered by the fact that Hank just called this a Coke when it's a Dr. Pepper....
YAS Next Gen 🖖 I'm going to be  Beverly for Halloween
THANK YOU for making this video.  A lot of movies and tv shows don't have a great plot (i.e. Moonlight - a friend of a friend literally said it was a movie where nothing happens and it made me SO ANGRY) but they are *about* something. I think projects like that are way more influential and its a shame that so many miss out because theyre looking for a plot
Ugh, and here I was just about to gut the meaning in my own stories so I could actually write them. But now I'm gonna have to go back and make the stories about more than a bunch of mercs shooting another bunch of mercs in space.
we are storytellers. write your book
Botulism can cause cans to have indents- just a head up
I think it's bacteria inside the can that could have given you food poisining
no longer the west wing world but the house of cards world. wowowowwww that was deep
Could you make a video on why your vids are alsays on trending with such low view counts
USES Coke AS A GENERIC TERM FOR ALL SODA POP\nI am so triggered right now.
Only on youtube would you worry about racism in space. Does youtube pay big youtubers to be dumbasses?
Orville or ST: Discovery... What's your preference?
I LOVE THIS VIDEO. I work hard to make all my art about something.
bf works at coke. says it doesn't have CO2 in it (which is used to make the bubbles)
Watch The Orville.  It is far from perfect, but it is a lot TNG.
I really miss the native hope in scifi. So often it's like the writers are laughing at their own premise are think that self-deprecating \n humor is the only way to seel the genre or show. I miss the genuine thoughtfulness of old scifi and the faith in humanity that it portrayed.
Could not disagree more that stories REQUIRE some deeper meaning. I always just look for stories that depict consistent characters, i.e. believable characters. I think you discover more about humanity, and yourself in turn, when you see how different people think and act. I think having a story to drive home some moral/political lesson as the most part always ends up poorly.
I'M NOT ALONE! If a show/movie/book/or even a youtuber is all about how bad the world is or people doing evil things with no deeper message, I am done with it too! I always felt like the odd one out not liking House of Cards and similar things. I don't want to add that kind of negativity to my life! I want my downtime to make me feel better about the world or help evolve my worldview! Thank you Hank for putting this into words and telling the world. I'm inspired to be truer to myself without being ashamed. Thank you ❤️. \n\nNerdfighteria helps me so much with random things like this, and is an example of the kind of content you outlined as the best, only it is an entire community too.
But you can get apple and orange juice in cans and they aren't carbonated?
Watch Master of None !!
Check out The Orville, I wasn't planning on watching it because I don't enjoy Seth Macfarlane but it's actually a really good show. It has a Interesting set of characters, once you get past the first episode it's awesome.
Why doesn't this always happen to cans of noncarbonated canned beverages like Hawaiian punch?
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
Some of my faves off the top of my head: Measure of a Man, Darmok, Chains of Command, Time Squared, The Nth Degree, Tapestry.. oh there's too many to choose.
Dr Pepper: An intellectual drink, for the chosen ones! (Who knows what show I’m referencing?!)
I think I finally understand what all of my high school Literature teachers tried to get across to us.
from Season 4, Episode 14: You are a most unusual species - worthy of a second chance
In reply to the non-flat soda-related content I'd say there are some remaining bastions of meaning out there.  Specifically kids shows.  While I'm not going to binge watch Dora the Explorer (or whatever the newest kids show is.  I'm 36, cut me some slack),  shows with that particular target audience still do have moral of the story sorts of content.  I'd agree, though, that we need a return of broader meaning to our programming.  90's plots were sometimes paper thin, but a lot of them delivered messages in incredibly creative ways.  Some did it ham fistedly, of course.  *cough* Full House *cough*   But again, that's partly target audience.
I agree I don't always want to see how the world sucks. I want to feel hopeful and inspired.
This is such a Vlogbrothers video. Y'know what I mean? It's a little all over the place but still informative and entertaining.
Plot is just what happens, it's not important in a story. What is important is how the events influenced and shape the characters and how they feel about that. Because it makes us think of how we would feel in certain situations and if we would want things to go like that in real life.
Meaning is good and all, but man... allow yourself to read and watch stories with great intentions and meaning, but horrible plot and story structure, is incredibly frustrating.\n\nThe delivery of the message and the point is as important or even more than the message itself, otherwise you wont even bother with the damn story in the first place.
So, this justifies those stories in high school, where the plot was absolutely What-the-hell-why-did-that-happen? or Nothing-happens-in-this-book-at-all!!, yet were abundantly meaningful.
HANK! Watch Person of Interest, I think you'd really enjoy it based on what you've said here.
I seriously need to re-watch that! Like Hank, I was about 10 or so when I saw it, mostly out of order. Although I do remember being at grandmas house(I was about 4yrs old) and my brother and I would excitedly watch the intro and we'd run to the TV and put our hands over the flash of the ship when it went to warp. I don't remember why, but we loved doing that!
You just put your finger on why I miss there being new Terry Pratchett books.
Oh look, again on the trending page: a youtuber as irrelevant as Tyler Oakley and Hannah Hart
What does dr.pepper taste like? Is it anything like coke?
You just very clearly articulated something I've been struggling to put my finger on for ages. Thank you!
My birthday is in a week, and I'm getting a (probably) signed copy of TAtWD. So excited!
Have you seen the Orville yet?
I started watching TNG all over again without even realizing it was the 30 year anniversary!
TNG was my star trek.😌
WHAT IS THIS VIDEO ABOUT?
Voyager is 100x better then all the other series combined.

Is it about clickbait?

But ur cool and awesome

Themes, Meaning, and Carbonation
Steven Universe.
TIME FOR NERDCON STORIES PLEASE>>>>>>
Subtle shade city
Preach, Hank!
I think you should die as soon as possible.
Sounds like you'd love SJW marvel comics nowadays. Forget a good story! Where's the propaganda?
I Hate Superman.
Rick from rick and morty can kill him
Would it be possible to make a History of Alex Mercer?
Definetly not, since he can get spanked by allot of people. Heck, Batman with prep can spank him. The same with Luther, plus almost everyone in his rouges gallery is pretty tough.
Lol no, Popeye would beat his ass like a small child
Is the sky blue?
Pffftt, if you guys think regular Superman is overpowered you need to get glasses. Go check out Superman Prime or One Punch Man if you want overpowered.
My man Goku can take him out
So you needed a 5 and a half minute video to explain if the most OP comic book character ever is OP?
Donald Trump is America's President now.  😝
Please do a more in depth teen titans video
The real question is How does Wonder Woman manage to use all that toilet paper in one sitting?
No, but Saitama is.
Bruce Timm reduced his power and still told the best Superman stories ever. It's lazy boring writers that make him OP because they don't want to think and let Superman plow through his problems instead of find real ways to fix them. So yes, he is overpowered, it doesn't take much effort of talent to draw a man lifting a planet.
Is Superman Overpowered? Yes, and No.\nThere are times where he does these amazing feats, but also times where he gets thrashed by seemingly weaker things. Superman unless given some form of power up isn't even the strongest being in DC. Either way I enjoy his comics, and stories as he was my first Super hero. He is what got me into Batman, WonderWoman, and DC entirely. Much like how Tho got me into Marvel.
Um DUH. He can go back in time and live life how he wants, he is omnipotent.
Saitama end of story
“During a time again in the world...”\nWhat time since WWII didn’t those in non-prosperous world need a super hero?
Two word : superman 64 😂... batman and goku all day
Thumbs down for needless Trump comment. Stick to what your channel is about.
Could have been a lot shorter
Captain universe is WAY more over powered
Most superheroes are overpowered. If you look at their power sets logically and compare them to both the villains they fight and the circumstances they find themselves in generally, they really shouldn't have any trouble with either, and the world around them wouldn't function well at all because of their existence
When you give a superhero that many diverse powerful abilities then give him a single weakness you create a really boring repetitive theme which is why i've never liked him as a hero, that sort of setup is what you see in villains or main bosses. Thats what makes me like him so much in injustice and makes it one of my favorite comics.
Superman vulnerability is always shown and exploited to depress his powers and symbol of invincibility
Considering logically Batman shouldn't even be able to beat Deathstroke and Ra's Al Ghul and yet he beats Superman shows me who the OP one really is, that plot armour is beyond God level.
You want Seth to come after you again.
I personally hate superman, because the truth is, like all other super heroes who seems like there is the possibility that the can die. This guy superman? Not even his weakness cryptonite seems to be able to harm him. He's just too impossible. I like batman because he's like a true representation of humans going brave and beyond (:
He lifted both a book of infinite pages and the physical manifestation of eternity, so the answer is yes.
This is the very question Batman asks.
do a video on Superman prime 1M vs Rune King thor
Didn't watch the video, but I'm gonna guess: Yes.
No. If Batman can fight him and actually do some work then no
Arris I know you'll most likely be too busy to see yet alone do my request, but can you please do an episode on the flash rebirth. See I just caught up and *SPOILER ALERT* flash no longer has the speed force but in fact the negative speed force due to his fight with Reverse flash. I really hope they do something cool like make Berry Allen the king and Generator of both negative and positive speed force and be able to use both be the fastest speedster. Anyway please do a video on it or tell me what you think
yes. end of video.
Yes that's what makes him great.. BTW Batman has no chance against him
Christ like figure? i think the comics usually made him more of a Moses type.
Goku is more overpowered than superman
Depends on the version but when written well: no.\n\nHe faces adversity both physical and mental. He can and has lost fights.\n\nAlso kryptonite.
All people that like marvel go into the comment to hate
Just get a rock and he's down
You already knew the answer to this , yet you clicked .
People say he’s overpowered yet he can’t beat Batman.\n😑
I don't know about over powered but overrated yes he's lame as fuck
Superman had great parents from 2 planets. He was taught virtue and love. He is what his parents made him. Incarnate.
In a word, yes.
Is the trump comment really necessary
He's the best
professor x will beat him easy
I believe he is.\nThe day where he dies and doesn't come back, I'll admit defeat.
Marvel still killing it over DC though.
I dont know about superman but robin is my bitch
Excellent response to this question!
Y'all stupid marvel gayboys need to realize what's makes Superman, Superman is his character and his powers. He was the first superhero.
He is actually cool
Let me tell you something. All the main justice league cast are all overpowered. DC's slogan is: If everyone is OP, nobody is OP.
One line answer: Yes, yes he is over powered.
Superman in my opinion is the best and most powerful superhero.
Superman isn't overpowered, it's just bad writing
You mean too powerful, right? Overpowered has a different, opposite meaning. That mean Superman is actually not that powerful. \nThat someone got the better of him or he was subdued.
Who else hates when doing somthing about superhero’s but don’t know nothing about the superhero’s then you just want to roast them like when a person watches Wonder Woman the movie then your in the movies then person always like wow I didn’t know that a scream when did this happen  am I only like this is every superhero fan like this also
Oh Yea he's way to overpowered but the solar powered S-Man is not with out his flaws. He can be easily killed 😲 by a green rock, magic, psychic attacks or mine possession or getting really sick by alien gas or poison, being beaten to death by someone just as powerful as him like Doomsday or Darkseid or a 5th Dimensional Being that can do anything, also being under a red sun or taking our sun away then use via Batman weakness, a bullet thru the head! Why hasn't anyone blew his head off yet!? #Batmanshouldbedead!
😂 He just needs a lil liquor-Then he’ll come strollin in to Lois’s apartment drunk and be like, “Lois, girls are gonna have bigger eyes than yours, and, and, they’ll see through lead too.” He crashes and breaks her tv. He’s embarrassed and melts it with his laser eyes. “Oh crap, Lois, what, what happened to your tv? It’s melted?” She turns on her bedroom light, and he flies the eff out and away as fast as he can. 😂
No, flash would destroy him
Popeye is more powerful than Superman.
President Trump  only uses Twitter because the msm don't tell the truth!
Superoverpowered!!!
Yes
No
one word saitama
Yes
yes op as fuck
Having super farts is really overpowering :))))
Yes
Short answer: Yes.\nLong answer: YESSSSSSS!
yes
Fuck Superman. Whitest Superheo ever lol
smartest dc heroes every vidoe
No
*looks at title*\nDuh, isnt it obvious?
You are on trending lol.
Wheres the bug fix for superman?
One punch man !
Ooh trending
yes
Superman sucks
Is Son Goku overpowered?
yes
History of nova ?
Nah goku
History of Superboy
Yes too over powered
1:42 Christopher Reeves best Sup actor ever. RIP <3
SM is too overpowered its not even cool anymore.
Fun fact: Superman is better than Batman
He’s overpowered meanwhile his weakness is a rock LOL
Superman fans are cancerous.
Because making batman overpowered is basically a meme now and not taken seriously I think he is the person we should be more worried about. Part of supermans identity is being able to defy humanity and his powers have always been stretched. Now everyone seems to think batman + prep = god
he has too many weaknesses to be overpowered
Superman may be overpowered, but he isn't the most powerful superhero.\n\nFlash is the most powerful superhero. Flash can run at super speeds (such as the speed of light), super-heal, think super fast, summon lightning, put people into another dimension (Speed Force), go to other universes, take speed from others, go through time, go through walls, come back from the dead, and make costumes with his mind. Now, that is truly overpowered!
800 people have Trauma :/
You are the best! Love from the netherlands xxx
Like how the fuck does anyone put a thumbs down on this, Dickheads!! LOVE IT!!!!
GRAMMY YOU BETTER NOT SLEEP ON THIS 👈👈👈👈👈👈👈👈
I thought this will be a Christmas song because of the intro. But I love it yeaahh!!!
Trauma isn't beautiful you insensitive prick. stop romanitcising mental illness just to make money
i love you pink. your heart is in every word you write and sing. you're so true to you, and you will forever be special because of this. love you!!!!!
OMG I forgot about this song I herd from the radio that pink had a new song and I tottely forgot about
A little bit got christmas vibe in the end of the song. which i love
Love you P!nk from Japan!!
clicked in here from the featured video... Didn't click away till I learned all the lyrics O_O
P!nk you did again love it perfect song for my man and I can't wait for album release on my lil brothers bday also lovin what u did with the hair liked it so much had to get mine like it
i just can't stop listening to this. it had the same effect on me as the first time i heard 'Raise your glass', within seconds i fell in love with it, pre-ordered the album. i'm gonna have this on repeat for a long time. Pink has still got it. Amazing!
i cant wait 4 the album!!!
I've been hitting replay because I'm trying to understand why this arrangement and style. IMO it's very un-P!nk (to put it kindly). But I never ever thought of P!nk to be someone without brains, so I stuck around longer and kept hitting replay. \n\nI continued scrolling the comments to see if I'm the only one who went WTF (especially after the verse, and even more so at the repeats of 'my love my love'), and then it struck me--IT'S FOR RADIO lmao gotta be similar to all the other trash out there so the majority of people will listen to it, enjoy it (because it's something they're used to), look her up and listen to the rest of her songs. 😂 \n\nI hope I'm right, because GENIUS! Lol
YASSSSS P!NK IS BACK ALONG WITH SHANIA TWAIN I LOVE THEM BOTH SO MUCH!!!!
Pink can give any artist a run for their money.  What a beautiful talent
Pink, we love you
Best song I have heard in a long time!
Is there anyone who been a fan of P!nk for pretty much their entire lives?
One new album  Two great singles taken from it so far  If the rest of the album is has good then we're in for a treat  Pink can do no wrong  Simply brilliant
I love this so much
Number 1 all round world
she is still making good music love you so much
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel.

This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Been here since There You Go. We're all Pink on the inside.

Love pink ❤️
Who else liked before listening
she is simply the best...💙
Can't Believe I saw her live in South Africa in 2007. 10 years later and she is still the most real artist out there. \n\nAwesome Track P!nk!
WOW! I think I might have a new favorite Pink song and I didn't think that was possible! Well she has certainly made it worth the wait!!!! Love it!
Bitch you live in bubble wrap, \nTrauma is just a word to skum like you
Pink is the best. Her songs are full of emotional and meaningful words that we can relate to.
She is the best😉👍❤
I keep waiting for her to fall, like a lot of pop-stars from the 90s.. She gets better.
Feel like every p!nk song are catchy 😍
Pink is back bitchess with double s couse she can, can't she..
I love it so much! Pink is a true artist ❤
Please come to las vegas
This album is gonna be Grammy worthy.
Prefer the old p!nk. I want another album like the I'm not dead one that was the best and it is a shame that p!nk has gone away from that.
P!nk has the best fans/ subscribers on Youtube/    ..😊
This lovely girl is growing every year, as an artist, a singer!
I love it so much 😍
She is my biggest inspiration I can’t sing but I can listen to the lyrics and they tell an amazing story I ❤️ all her songs so much
Pink just keeps getting better and better.  A star is reborn.
Holy shit is it really possible for you to keep getting better and better? I'm hooked P!nk, you're like a drug! Thank you 💖
She is So amazing!!!! I cannot wait to see the Tour!!!
P!nk, you get finer like wine...the two tracks I've hears off Beautiful Trauma are phenomenal...waiting patiently with enthusiasm for the 13th!
Is it just me that thinks she says mum in the chorus... like if you agree just so i know i'm not alone lol.☺

My favourit part of the song from 0:00 to4:12💓💓
Yes it's fckin perfect!
Very good
YTF is this not trending?
Its funny how it perfectly fits on his trunk
I like how he drove by the first time casually to scope the place out.
So they are using kids now...
That did fit so perfectly in the back of his car, i would forgive because of that reason alone.
Cops later pepper sprayed and tazed this kid.
not cool.
Hilarious!
This kid is going places. \n\nPrison --- to be exact.
to be honest i'd be happier that my neighbour is holding my package for me than having it left out like that!\nwhere i live it'd be gone within minutes!\n\nif i saw a package abandoned on my neighbours driveway i'd probably take it in too, \nand post something through their letter box letting em know i have it :P
the parents probably told him to do it , goes on alot .
It annoys me more that the kid is driving all through the neighborhood yards. Wtf is up with this kids parents?
pkg looked heavy; good thing he was in a Ford otherwise he wouldn't have been able to drive off with the heavy load.
He literally brought it back two minutes later after driving it around. \nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Shit I'd press charges teach that little fucker early.
He thought real hard about it before he picked it up
What happened later? Follow up?

I hope this kid has been slapped!\nEvery kid can do stupid things, that's not the problem, but parents should make it very clear that he CAN'T do it again!

So what was in the package?
North Korean doesnt have nuclear weapons. Your next video should about stopping western progaganda and the tyrany  of the US instead of contributing to it. \nUNSUBSCRIBED...
Just because the U.S. signed something with Russia doesn't mean that both country's didn't make something. There's no way we would leave our country underfunded. Plus the U.S. doesn't listen to anyone. We do things we shouldn't but do them anyways
Intercepting a nuclear head is still extremely dangerous. A nuclear blast is harmful at any altitude, anywhere.
I don’t understand why humans can’t just shut the fuck up and leave everyone else alone. Do your own thing. Humans are gonna make humans go extinct. We are the only life that we know of. We need to keep ourselves alive and spread across the galaxy and do great things!
Can you do a video of Elon's new BFR, Thanks love your videos! Keep up the great work!

3:07 yeah, german navy (Sachsen-class) :D
Awesome intro
Could a railgun shoot down icbm?
The way to stop North Korea is to get the loud mouth loser Chump trump to STFU and for the USA to mind its own crappy problems at home and stop trying to tell the DPRK what to do ! \n The USA government is the problem not North Korea or Iran or Syria !
When the warheads are deployed in space you have basically no chance. when they are coming than with 4km/s or 14400km/h. Also It's very unlikely that a nation only fires 1 ICBM. each ICBM can have up to multiple warheads.

4:19 WTF?????..... OMG.... Heavy breathing.....
There's always tech that you don't know about. If North Korea tries to bomb it will be recorded stopped and returned to sender. I guarantee that no nuclear bomb will ever go off unless both sides agree on it

What happened to the star wars program were a satalite would fire a beam of energy at a missile in its silo
does anyone else remember when the US Navy destroyed that old US satellite falling back to earth in 2008? We did that with an SM(Standard Missile)from an Aegis Class destroyer. The satellite was 130 miles high and moving at thousands of miles per hour. Not only did the SM hit the target successfully the actual impact point was point on perfect. That was OVER EIGHT YEARS AGO! What we are capable of now has indeed advanced since then....we will have to wait and see
If it worked, how did NK recently fire a rocket over Japan?
Just give some thought as to what happens to a nuclear warhead after kinetic impact assuming that the missile defense shield is not just another load of American marketing bollocks. Where do you think the fallout will end up?
How to stop American nuclear missile ?? They have 6000+ warheads !!
Spray xylene on it-- will rot the rubber bands.   🐸🐸
why don´t they just load a nuke on board a long range super stealth diesel sub and sail it to the port of a major city?
this fat kid needs a spanking
Being worried about North Korea, is like being afraid of the boogie man. What you should really be afraid of is Russia. That's like having herpes, except this herpes can actually kill you.
Are we just ignoring the fact that Democrats derailed the missile defense shield just because they hated Ronald Reagan and America? Reagan and every Republican since wanted to fully fund and push for a missile defense shield, but the Democrats just didn't like him and were traitors to America, so they derailed and defunded the missile shield. Obama was  the latest Democrat to do so. Now North Korea wants to launch missiles at us, and we don't have a full scale missile shield.

4:25.....WTF was that?   was that just floating around on micro rocket bursts?
NK starting a nuclear war with the US is like a guy with one snow ball starting a snowball fight vs someone with a few thousand snowballs.
Nuke em first
The Israeli Arrow-3 is way better than THAAD and was developed with a fraction of the cost.
Don't.
I thought we just look at it
Plot twist\n\n\n\n\nNk ICBM are all fake
How can we stop this USrAel terrorism!\nThe world do not need this Rockefeller rothschild capitalism warfare
We are Russia we have superior technology!!!
What if a North Korean sub sneaks through Mexican waters and fires a Missile there? Then What?\nWe got San Diego the Pacific Fleet in danger.
Thaad cannot intercept an ICBM and be useless for protecting mainland USA
It would be suicide for NK to engage in nuclear warfare with the US. Kim Jong Un might not care about his citizens but he still would want to keep his country.
wow, storyblock is amazing!
How to stop a ballistic missile\n\n\n\n\nWe have to push the missile out of the way
You know shits gonna get ugly when you get these kinds of videos recommended
Let them have their nukes.\nThey are not stupid enough to use them.
Pull the pin and throw it back...?
If NK launched a real nuke, whether it hits its target or not, NK would have been turned to a smoldering wasteland before their missile even reached the terminal stage.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SDI OR STAR WARS? HOW MUCH IF ANY OF IT WAS DEPLOYED?
It wont happen. Just bullshit in name of nothing. Chine set the rules there and wont let it happen. Otherwise a new Korea north and south come together as one economy and massively grown as territory. Since South Korea produces technology, there you can find Samsung headquarter. Never in this short decades an invasion ou a peaceful union between them will happen. Its just the fear they want you to be real. Once again it shows that the era of corporations world wide is the new order. Welcome to the ilusion of true. Just a bunch of idiots raised by their dog grandmothers that  started our technology with the goal to create the most powerful circus in the world. If you can buy coca cola there, means... Corporations runs the show, because cause all the countries in the world just cant political 'help them' but still, North Korea gives money back to  North America consume that slaves us to support the rich stay cool.
What about dummy rockets to overwhelm the defense system? Isn't that a thing? NK might be able to do that... ?
You have to play Rick and morty musically's in order to stop a North Korea nuke

yet how to stop american drone bombs raining down on children, on civilians, on poor unprotected people in a school, hospital, a marriage or even the side walk .. Assholes like you never make films about the reality .. always hoodwinking .. copying third grade graphics and hollywood trailers .. pathetic trash Duh Engineering Crap !
THAAD isn't even the main BMD weapon. \n\nThe Standard Missile 3 is. \n\nThe SM 3 has a top speed of mach 15+\n\nWe also have various kinetic options.\n\nAnd then there are the lasers.
Thats easy. Just send a commando team to cut the rubber band on their slingshot.
Wouldn't a physical impact on the warhead create what is basically a dirty bomb with a cloud of shredded plutonium in the athmosphere

Threath such as Russia... realy?? What about threath such as US?? You are so bias.\nAs I remember only country in the world that used nukes against humanity is US!!!
I think one of the worst parts is usually a nuclear blast sets off an EMP. Which would destroy most electronics.
Nuke them first
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
You can't stop whats coming.
It actually made me more hopeful about interception, because I knew it was hard to intercept, but maybe it's not near impossible to stop a warhead flying at 7 km/s.
Even they would lunch rocket to whatever country, NK will be obliterated and all regime will end. so they not stupid. They only want to protect they regime.
No way to stop it ,,,,, my goodness.. are we going to die?????????????
Honestly,i dont put too much trust into BDS's,from what I've read online they are a huge money drain and barely work at all.\n\nShooting down ICBM's is often compared to shooting down a bullet with another bullet,only difference is that this bullet is travelling several times the speed of sound and has up to 16 different warheads,some of which can be used as decoys.\n\nI've also read that Russia developed new missiles that can withstand smaller yield nuclear blast from 500m,so its not just a bullet,it is a bullet proof bullet.\n\nIt looks that avoiding the nuclear exchange is still our best option.
Donald Trump: Send nukes\n\nKim Jong Un: Ok\n\nDonald Trump: Nudes*\n\nDonald Trump: O shit
It's not gonna happen! Stop!
North Korea uses their Nuclear Stockpile to sustain their stability in the world stage. The Nuclear weapons are to keep the US at bey, as well as giving off a possible threat of 'nuking' South Korea or Japan to keep their stance on Global Power. North Korea wouldn't dare to launch a 'ICBM' or Nuclear Weapon at the US. However, the US fear of North Korean nuclear usage would keep the US from directly conflicting NK. As well as keeping the Kim Regime standing.
North Korea doesn't want to nuke, or fight, with the US.  \nNorth Korea only wants to frighten the US enough so that they, North Korea, can retake South Korea.  If the US gets involved in such a war, North Korea will lose but if North Korea can scare off the US (or at least delay it) it could win. Will the US be willing to possibly get Seattle or L.A. nuked to save South Korea?  North Korea doesn't think so.
How to stop a North Korean nuclear missile:\n1. invent time travel\n2. go to 1953\n3. turn loose MacArthur\n4. no North Korea, no nuclear missiles.
How to discuss people... make biased videos about trending topics
Jeez. This stuff scares me. I wish that all humans would just work together instead of fighting. There are other things we should worry about other than each other.
You haven't mentioned the Israeli interception systems, that's too bad because their tech is pretty advanced on this field
You forgot our first and most important line of defense against a nuclear attack: diplomacy. If NK gets to the point where they are actually launching missiles, millions will die. Of course most of theses deaths would be North Koreans, but that is still an unacceptable outcome. I'm glad that we have defenses that might work against ICBMs but I'd rather live in a world where they are unnecessary.
lasers is the only thing that comes to mind as a reliable way of shooting everything down, but then we would need a farm full of fusion reactors to power enough lasers to make sure nothing keeps flying
The problems of low iq ppl are caused  weed doe, it
Yes but how can we stop someone trying to stop a North Korean nuke??

Here’s how you stop a nuke:\n\nCall Superman

Be prepared for disappointment - the novel series didn't have a clear ending
Looks good - nice cast, written and directed by Garland, who made one of my favourite recent sci-fi films in Ex-Machina (which rightly catapulted Alicia Vikander to superstardom).\n\nLet's hope the studio doesn't water everything down into mediocrity like they usually do.\n\nAnyway - I've decided to watch this, so I WON'T be watching the main trailer, because that will obviously spoil everything [you can set your watch to these trailers and predict almost every main event in the movie]

It's a Trilogy.series so hopefully it does well. be the 1st for portman
It has Begun Mortal Kombat ding ding ding da da da bing bing bing Mortal Kombat annihilation
I think this is from the writer & directer of Ex Machina
Professor Marston & the Wonder Women ( bit.ly/Professor-Marston-the-Wonder-Women-Movie-FULL-HD )
All I see is people complaining hollywood this, hollywood that. Shut up. You're no expert. You're annoying.
I have always wanted a good nature-based horror movie.
Looks like an Arrival inspired movie.
Another strong woman movie. Great.
Oh my god an orignal ip that looks good
I guess Thor will save her....
I AM SO PUMPED FOR THIS HELL YEAH
Is this movie sf?
I actually read this novel in february. I think the story will be much better as a movie! Not that the novel was particularly bad, but... Fingers crossed :)
0:14 _There's a problem on the horizon... There's no horizon!_ No, K2SO, there can only be the Car Wash of the Apocalypse!

❤ Natalie Portman
Arrival II
Writer and Director ex machina - count me in, I don't to watch the rest of the trailer
Just here for Gina Rodriguez and Tessa Thompson!
How the fuck you pronounce the title though....
It's very simple:\nLéon: The Professional 1994\nNatalie Portman played Mathilda\n\nAnd I've watched every movie she's in in since. & Natalie Portman + Sci Fi = take my $
2:28 everyone of us if we ever encounter our celeb crush

I was waiting for Channing to take his shirt off 😪
All of us got abs man. It's just the question whether it's visible or not... Which I've never seen for as long as I've lived...
짱 재미있어용
When he dances and his shirt flies up and you see his big old saggy skin belly 😐 ruins my lady boner
I like James Corden because he is sexy man
I’m getting so sick of seeing this cunt everywhere. First he appears in every movie, now he’s everywhere in trending.
Haha, funny.  Fifth Harmony - Work playing the background fits the theme I suppose.
I think its unnatural and scary when you can see someone's insides through the skin ;)
This made my day!😂😂
Some more puns i'd like to add: \nSwing from the Chandelier\nDirty Chancing\nJust Chance\nWe Are The Chanions \n(As you can probably tell I am very bored haha)

I am stuck in hospital can I get 50 likes please I am in a lot of pain.
What a captivating achievement; I'm so excited!
Every screen shot is a wallpaper
Life is so incredible! The photography in this is truly awesome. A magnificent spectacle. So extremely beautiful. We better enjoy it while we can, because nuclear waste is invading this priceless creation. Thanks to mankind the planets virus! Soon to be the universe's virus. Way to go! Shame... Shame.....Shame!
I'm excited for the series, but what about that fat pilot whale!
I'm so amazed at all of BBC's Earth documentaries. The kind of work that must go into getting this kind of footage is mind boggling.
The fact that this video isn't in 4K is disappointing. Planet Earth 2 is one of the best looking documentaries on 4K UHD. I'm sure this will be equally good if not better.
Blue planet, the stuff we're allowed to show you. Lol
One of the Greates documentary with Wallkig with Dinosaurs. Im back to my teen-young age. The Sountrack by George Fenton (2001) is outstandig!
The bed by Tom Jones
I knew Aquaman would be an awesome movie!
The genius minds of Sir David Attenborough and Hans Zimmer and Radiohead ❤️❤️❤️🐙🐬🦑🐡🐋🐟🐳🐠🦀
Didn’t need the awful singing
Salute to you all the way from NZ Mr Attenborough!!
his voice is one of a kind... i have never heard ne1 like him. a rare gem.. amazing documentary with great voice.
What horrible music to go with some of the best wildlife footage ever.
As a canine this trailer makes me all warm inside
Such footage plus Hans Zimmer and Radiohead music.... This is some epic stuff!
YOU BETTER NOT DO THE BABY SEA TURTLES AGAIN...
wow these guys are really taking it to the next level on this one, the HYPE is real!!!
This has alot going for it. Amazing stuff.
281 people have no souls. The most epic music, photography and narration we have ever seen. Period.
where do i get this??
The most majestical collab I could ever think of
take my money and my soul! THIS GONNA BE EPIC!
some of this stuff is so high quality it almost looks CG
anybody else keep watching this over and over just for the music?
gonna blaze up for all 6
When does it come out ?
I remember watching the trailer for the original Blue Planet when I was 10. In that time I’ve become a PADI Advanced Open Water Diver and now sponsor Hawksbill Turtles with WWF. Can’t wait for this to return!
Goosebumps to the maximum with the song
When does this air on BBC ?????
That song was awful ... ruined the trailer ...  no singing in your documentaries please BBC.
thank you more than so much about this video
Who actually disliked this video? I'm truly puzzled.
What have we done to this beautiful earth , fighting fighting and fighting\n\n\n\nI'm so inspired by this vedio ,that I am going to start a campaign ,by God
Please consider veganism! Why would anyone want to destroy beauty like this with overfishing? It will never fail to baffle me. We need to protect marine life, now more than ever, as it is likely many species will be extinct by 2050. It may seem a long way off, but in the grand scheme of things, this is a minuscule amount of time to cause such irreversible damage to our beautiful planet.  They don't belong on your plate, they belong in the oceans. Please, please help keep them there, supply and demand. If enough people stop contributing to our ocean's exploitation by buying fish, there will be no profit in it and they will have to find another source of money. Hopefully a much less destructive one that allows these incredible creatures to live out their lives free of suffering and pain.

We all came from the sea, this is our god
I loved this video about land animals.                                              \n\n\n\n\n\nT R I G G E R E D
Hopefully that awful music won't be in the actual show
Would already be SO great regardless BUT as soon as I heard Radiohead come on... damnnn 😉
Omg I cannot wait to see this it looks fantastic
This world we live in is so beautiful, the thought that someday all this will disappear makes me so sad.
Kinda sucks that BBC is a channel, but BBC is sadly also slang term for a big black guys....well ya know......
the photography and art direction is stunning!! I can't wait to watch it!!!
The music is already just yes
@4.06 what if you were to stick your chicken in there?
I feel strange for being this excited for a documentary. <3  And is it my headphones or is the sound mixing slightly off in this trailer? Sounds like his voice is drowning in the music a little.
Calm down. We've discovered not more than 10% of the ocean life. Many more to come.
We are destroying our earth our beloved home 😭
Need to see this!!
Nobody, and I mean NOBODY does it like BBC.  This looks absolutely wonderful and I can't wait to watch it.
Take my money, where do I watch this?
Who's joining me on the Blue Planet ll hype train!?
How marvelous God's creation is - how magnificent!
just trying not to cry
Take a break from humans
❤❤❤baby turtles😊\nAnd shout out to all the camera guys and gals who capture all of this wonder. 💯
david attenborough is the best thing that happened to this planet
David Attenborough can give you an orgasm with his narration.
Stunning, absolutely stunning. Just shows the beauty of the world we live in.
The only tv show I’ll go back to tv for
Pure nostalgia. Remember watching blue planet 1 as a kid all the time. So hyped up
and i love😍BBC😍very much too
What a  Mesmerise blue world 👌and David voice is always like cherry of the cake,he hypnotized viewers through his amazing voice  love you David atounbourgh ... God bless you...
When I see this, I think that the criteria we need to judge the destruction we provoke in order to sustain our lifestyles should not be based on ethics but aesthetics.  It is not a lack of goodness, but a lack of good taste. When I see this masterpiece prequel and think of what we humans are doing I cannot see us but as vandals threatening the beauty of these frames.
Radiohead, Hans Zimmer and David Attenborough in the same sentence? I'm dead. HYPE.
Ermegerd! This cinematography is Amazing!
Can't wait!❤️
Music name plz??From 1:00 to.1:30
Just stunning, absolutely beautiful! Anyone agree that this is gonna be great?
Orgasmic!
Amazing trailer!
Amazing photography
Looks incredible! Can't wait!
Wowwwwww

0:26 epic wallpaper moment
Wow 😍 😍
When i watch the planet series by bbc i feel like giving up everything. I just feel like going into the wild and experiencing the nature. Ironically i am working hard to make a living when life is in the mountains or by the lake or deep in the blue. Was born a human, rat race made me a robot !
can you do a video on how you introduced darcey to liam?
You might regret joining the PTA!! (the struggle is real at times!) 😂
💖💕💖😘I hope she stays cuddly and affectionate too. As an almost 20 year old I still squeeze into my mums lap for cuddles 😂I get nicknamed leech because of how much affection I crave 😂💖😘💕you're a wonderful mum and Darcy will continue to grow up to be beautiful and kind like you & I'm sure she'll be an amazing role model for baby sister.
I remember when darcy was 4! X
Don't worry Louise I'm almost 18 and I still have daily cuddles with my mom xx
My little sister is 9 and still does the cuddly I love you thing 😊 she will come into my room in the morning and give me cuddles before she goes to school ❤️
My 6 year old little sister does a lot of similar things, 6 year olds are all little weirdos but it makes them so funny ahahah. Love you and Darcy, Louise! Xx
this made me so happy aww
You look glowing Louise! What a sweet little girl Darcy sounds like, she clearly has grown up with a loving and beautiful mum!
The way you talk about Darcy makes my heart melt 😍 also, you look so glowing Louise!
I was 2 when my sister was born and apparently ( I can't remember ) I was excited but then when she came I threw a jumbo lego brick at her luckily 2 year olds have bad aim .  love you Louise ❤️
Darcy is simply the most adorable little munchkin! What a lucky wee girl to have such a doting mum, too! You are just *oozing* joy at the moment Louise. I can see how proud of your family you are and just how content life is for you at the moment. I'm so happy you're happy!
It's so warming to hear about your affection for each other😊 she such a sweet little girl💛when I was 6 I also liked to play role play, mainly as a vet with my stuffed animals, now I'm volunteering at my local vets for real!!💛
Ironic how u wash her hair when you dont wash your own
greatest thing since wifi  😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 as a mum I can relate 💖💖💖💖
This conkers for you vicar and I've named it jesus
I'm 21 and haven't grown out of loving having hugs with my momma and never ending saying I love you to my momma she's my best friend. Darcy sounds like such an amazing little girl who has such a great personality and is such a mini you ❤️
I am currently 16 years old, and my mother is like secretly FREAKING OUT and everytime I mention moving out when I'm 18 or going to university she just avoids the topic, or tells me how I'd probably be more comfortable at home where she can cook for me and do my laundry while I'm busy studying...\nBless her <3
What I remember watching your pregnancy announcement and it feels like only yesterday! She's so amazing and I'm praying for a smooth pregnancy for yous. \nAlso try keep darcy in swimming and maybe get her on your local team, I'm a swimmer and it is such a nice lil community and swimming is so amazing❣
My daughter is 6 and a half too. I've been following you and Darcy for years ;) My daughter Matilda is obsessed with card making and making me little letters and 'story books' I absolutely love this age :)
I love that you and Darcy are so close, I never grew out of the cuddly stage. I would always cuddle my mum and sit on her lap for a hug until I was 15 when she passed ❤
I'm pretty sure the best thing since sliced bread came from the wonder loaf the first packaged slice bread in America I think before that there was obviously only loafs that you had to cut and I guess got laborious and it would dry out etc so imagine packaged bread that you don't need to hack at ... sorry probably WAY too much information lol 😂
I'm so happy Darcy is all good and happy :)xx
I want a video of Dan, Phil, and Louise playing with Darcy (: please please please
I'm sure she will love having a little sister xx
Louise oh my gosh I cannot even BEGIN to tell you how much I appreciate you taking so much care into preparing Darcy for the new baby :') Every time you talk about it I'm reminded of the godawful job my mom and stepdad did for me when my mom was pregnant and I'm just really happy for Darcy that she has such a great mom like you * crying emoji *
My niece is 6 next month and is a gorgeous little weirdo too. I swear we weren't as quirky as kids today. I sound so old lol.
My little sister was born on Christmas Eve, and it took me months to open my Christmas presents because I was more interested in the baby! 😂😁
My cousin is 4 and wants to be a stripper. Like, I know I said you can be anything but you have to draw the line somewhere.
Louise you are such a great mom! Great video 💞
I genuinely think I washed my own hair from about the age of 4...but then I was really into swimming from very young so I used to wash my own hair in the pool showers. Don't really remember hair washing with my mum...although I'm sure she did at some point 😂
This is so cute. The squirrel stickers on the car made me chuckle xxx
Madame President 😂😂 god I love you haha
I was six when my sister was born, she is my best friend ever since. Hope Darcy and the little one go on <3
I understand Mickey Mouse Clubhouse & PJ Masks, I feel like I can quote every episode word for word with my siblings! 😂
Our daughters have the same age and we are due almost the same time :-)! Darcy is such a sweetie! Also my daughter is still all huggy and sweet and I hope so much that this will never change!
My daughter is 6 &1/2 halos and she is so similar to Darcy. I get a letter almost every day and hugs and kisses and I love yous and she likes to negotiate dinner a lot. My daughter likes to have private talks away from her brother about school and her friendships and it makes me so happy and I just know that God-willing we will be best friends. 🤗🤗🤗
OMG now i want to have a six year old this made me so excited and happy and 😍
im 15 and am still the biggest cuddle ever i love it and my mum is too! xx
I'm 19 and I'm still super cuddly with my mum because we're very close so I wouldn't worry, Darcy could definitely hold on to that trait x
I'm almost 22 and I still live with my mom, we still cuddle every day so don't worry, she will probably do that when she's older \n\nYou look absolutely lovely Louise xx
The Jesus conker story made me howl with laughter!  I teach children Darcy's age and they are just FULL of random little comments like that!
PJ MAKS ARE ON OUR WAY INTO THE NIGHT TO SAVE THE DAY, this sound is in my head far too much
I was so confused as to why Darcy was so scared of swimming until I realised that she had only just started! Most kids in Australia are swimming from 6 months old haha. So pleased she loves it!
What a cute video!!
I love that! The greatest thing since WiFi!
Darcy is sooooo sweet, such a lovely little girl🌸 & when I was younger I always remember wanting the family pet to be mine😹🌸
honestly one of my main reasons for being alive anymore if watching lil darcy grow up happy. <3
My friend is 24 & she still gives her Mom a cuddle, or sits close together on the couch having tea & sharing stories or their day. So don't worry Louise some people never grow out of the cuddles.
I like Liam a million times more now after finding out he's a swimmer! I am too :) :)
Lol ha pj masks so true. Having sisters is so super special xx she sounds like such a loving girl xxx Jesus concur. 😂 I am sure he loved it. So funny.
The greatest thing since WIFI --- LOL! I laughed so hard, partly because I understand. I think my son is the greatest thing since WIFI too!
Would love to see you colab with emily norris
Awww, Darcy seems to be growing into a very sweet, intelligent little lady.  I don't have children, but I love hearing about Darcy.  It's lovely to see how proud you are of her.  Also Louise, you look amazing in this video! x
When is the video with Dan and Phil?
I was 6 1/2 when my brother was born, and I think it's a great age for that because I actually have memories of him being born, whereas I was 3 when my sister was born and I don't really have memories of that. Darcy is going to be the best big sister! And when you were talking about not wanting her to grow up, all I could think of is Bev from The Goldbergs.
I very much hope that your priest responded quickly along the lines of see the conkering hero comes! lol - all of that anecdote made us laugh, so sweet x
im glad to hear shes learning to swim! its such an important skill and im so grateful my mom made me take lessons even when i didnt want to.
This video was so wholesome and wonderful! I'm happy to hear that she's doing well and all the quirky things that she does. She sounds like such a wonderful little person, just like her mum
I've just realised there's the same age gap between Darcy and the baby as there is between me and my sister. It's really the best. I'm sure they'll get on so well and Darcy will teach her new little sister so much 😊
Louise you are #8 on trending!!💗
I'm so happy for you Louis! Your a great mum!😁💖
so exited to hear Darcy I getting a little sister!!!! but can you show us Liam in a video!?
Madam president has a nice ring to it, alright madam president.
We all love Darcy so much❤️❤️❤️
I have a feeling Darcy will be a great sister because as you said during the video she loves playing with dollies and things so she'll probably be her little sisters mummy and probably be a waiter to her little sister.
I'm 15 and me and my mum still have bedtime cuddles and lots of cuddles and I love you's! She's still my best friend x
you look so good in this video Louise!!!
Hi Louise, loved this video it's so nice to hear how Darcy is doing I'm glad she's growing up so well❤️ just wondering how do you and Liam go about disciplining her? Like do you let Liam tell her off to?
Darcy is the sweetest little girl x
So lovely seeing another girl who shares my name! (even with a different spelling) \n\nI've only ever met dogs called Darcey haha
Go you for being president of the PTA.  I've never joined.  Apparently it's a political minefield 😱
I've named it Jesus 😂😂😂😂😂
When is the dan and Phil video coming out
When my mum had me she bought my older sister a plastic doll. When mum fed me, bathed me, changed my nappy, put me to sleep etc, My sister would do the same for the doll. I think that would work really well for Darcy if she likes role playing and it keeps her involved in the whole process. Kept my sister from feeling ignored because of new bub. \n\nReally enjoyed this video! She's growing up into such a beautiful little girl!
I have a brother that has just turned 7 so ovs he was six before and he likes having hair washes more as well xxxx
So nice to hear about the cuddles part. I was and STILL AM suuuuuper cuddly with my mum. I love love love cuddles and saying I love you etc
having her less on camera makes sense, and it makes the moments she is on camera all the more precious :)
Is Louise engaged again or just dating at the moment also with who ❤️❤️
Darcy is gorgeous!
Almost 17 and definitely grew out of the cuddly stage a year or two after primary school,  I have no idea why i just feel super gross being so affectionate (not that I’m not still loving to my parents though!) so make the most of it!
I love ur hair colour!
Love this so  muchglad shes going great
❤️❤️❤️
Louise ur skin is glowing u look gorgeous ❤️👍🏽👌🏽
Jesus conker 😂
PJ Masks 😂
Louise you are glowing!!
I miss darcy 😕❤️
'I named it Jesus' hahahahahaha
lovely video madam president 😂
Darcys six😱😱😱😱😱
Ahhhhh...       Mr Darcy.
Great video
Darcys 6?!! god they grow so much😫😍💕
OMG pj mask.
Squirrel car sounds iconic honestly
What happened to Zulu?
Can you do what's in my baby's registry
Actually laughed out loud over Jesus the Conker, brilliant!
When Mbappe is more matured than Neymar/Cavani/Alves combined.
Bayern are trying to finish 3rd so they can face Arsenal in the Europa League  knockout stages and beat them again.
Mbappe destroyed Bayern what a performance
Where's Arsenal in the programme
5:33 is messed up listen to the audio
United need to start playing some passes back rather than just shooting, because they had players in much better positions. This could've easily been 7-1
It's looking good for the English teams
A English team is definitely going far in this tournament
Lol RIO is such a Londoner I love it it's illegal 😂👏🏾
Even Celtic have won more than Looserpool lmao, currently the worst British CL team and the embarrassment of English Football (Apart from Arsene Wenger FC).\nChelsea, City, United and Spurs are class 👌
Gerrard always salty about Rashford and Man Utd in general
Steven Gerrard is honestly one of the worst pundits. He talks nonsense every week. He talks about Atletico never being torn apart like that yet Real Madrid beat them 3-0 twice last season
Lukaku too powerful
As a Man Utd fan I'm really glad Chelsea won. It's good to see English teams putting up a good fight in Europe right now compared to the horrendous few seasons we've had before in Europe!
How does Costa feel now?
Martial FC
No surprise from Stevie g to make comment like that about a Manchester united player saying mbpappe is world class and not rashford
Its illegal what he's doing, not allowed, get out of the stadium
All UK teams \n\nMatch Day 1\nCeltic - Lose \nMan City -Win \nMan Utd - win \nSpurs - Win\nChealsea - Win (sorry if i spelled wrong )\nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\nMatch Day 2 \nCeltic - Win \nChealsea - Win \nMan Utd - Win \nSpurs - Win \nMan City - Win \nLiverpool - Draw\n\n\n This shows that liver pool are the best team in the champions league
Bt sport are great this year but they need to get rid of Owen
Neymar>Mbappe<Lukaku>Martial<Morata<
Wrong commentary at 5:30
English Teams 👏👏👏👏 But Liverpool🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Lukaku is the definition of a overrated tap-in merchant.
Martial >>> Mbappe
Come catch up with whether my door is locked
if mbappe is world class then what does that make gabriel jesus
What's with the music?
Boom CHELSEA CHELSEA ARE THE BEST ARSENAL FANS DONT MESS WITH US
stevie, micheal owen was world class at 18, he won a ballon d'or and everything!
Neymar right now is on his own at the top, best player in the world.
Check out the full fight video of England cricketer Ben Stokes on my page
I would love to see an English team in the CL finals
The music for Juve made me think Dybala hit the post haha
BT's pundits are the worst. They do remember Madrid tearing them apart last season 3 times right?
Mbappe is so LIT 💥 its almost illegal what he's doing in the pitch ⚽️
Now what happened to the commentary at 5:33
got the commentary wrong at like 5:50 with lewandowski
Look whoever keeps saying Rashford is better then Mbappe is on crack he has potential to be better then neymar rahsford will be lucky if he reaches rooneys potential lets be honest he has great players around him where mbappe didn’t come from the bottom and worked hard
Never thought the team id be happy to get in the last 16 would be Barca
Manchester United best team in England ❤️
The commentary at 5:43 does not refer to what is being shown on screen. Its hilarious. Bayern are on the attack but listening to the commentator you'd think PSH had had the shot.
Psg got lucky
Fantastic coverage
Lukaku more like Donkeykaku lolz
5:33 doesnt make sense
BT Sport > Sky Sport > BBC Sport
Wheres arsenal... oh wait
Chelsea make their Mark
Roma only beat Qarabag 2-1? Very weak score
Fair play chelsea
5:32 audio mixed up???
Higuine
Common chels!!!
Loved Bayern getting raped by Paris
5:33 ...
Haha costa
mBappe 😁😁😁
umtiti and semedo >>
5:40 I'm confused
5:30 lol
Great to see English teams doing well! I'm envious Arsenal aren't a part of it. What a win by Chelsea, just superb, United looked clinical and City will be tough for anyone to defend against. Good for Spurs too, it's about time their fans enjoyed watching a decent side. Hopefully Liverpool will improve to make it 5/5 in the last 16, Anfield needs more big nights. As for my team, well I'm off to Belarus, should be fun. Would love to see us win the whole thing.
Wow Benfica are truly awful
david luiz.. what a liability
Shouldn't the title say 27th instead of 28th? :D
The English teams are improving, so far so good!!!!!!
Anyone notice Liverpool's game was not shown. 😂
I love seeing Athletico lose for some reason. Shaping up to be a stacked knockout round this year.
Anyone know the song name and artist for the song played during the PSG vs Munich Highlights?
1:54 Conte's cunting the floor lol
Just saying but Lukakus goals were both VERY lucky. Moratas goal was seriously a gem
get rid of Chris Sutton
Benfica are nothing without Ederson in goal
liverpool will be the first English team knocked out ...
Jan Oblak??????
Carlo Ancelotti has been Sacked
september 27th - not 26th ------- terrible mistake
Sucks that coat is alpaca fur and wool... Not cool, so much cruelty goes into that.
My goal for this winter is to have a good quality coat I have never had one 😂 and I’m going to turn 23 years old this November so I think it’s time to have a coat 💓 love you so much Sam ❤️
Hey Sam! I have never, ever commented on someone's video before but... there is a first time fore everything right!? Well, I've been watching your videos for years and I love how candid your channel is. Anyway, I have a statement red jumper from H&M. It's in their pricier range, but fits soooo good! The sleeves are baggy and the fit but maintains it's structure and good quality similar to the one you tried on. You should check it out: http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0530178002.html
omg that drummer man looked like someone soo much.. who the heck did he look like!!
Love this type of videos ☺️💕💕
Think the more 🍅 jumper looks like Velma from Scooby-Doo xd, definitely the boss bitch coat!! The name says it all. I liked the first red jumper and the 2nd :)
I went thrifting for the check jacket like you mentioned in your autumn looks video. I scored one for cheap, so I'm happy.
I loved this video!! I'm am vicariously living through your daily shopping lol love the jacket !
What foundation are you wearing?\nYour skin looks flawless :)
I want the coat in blue 💙💙
That blue coat😍 it's from other stories too?
I don't mind the AD you put in any video, keep them videos coming Sam, it's awesome! 😄
You looked really good in that first red jumper ! You look amazing in everything though! Lol love the coat on you 💕👑
what store was she in with the boss btch coat ?
Looved the blue coat,but I would definitely go for the one you ended up picking up! I wanna go coat shopping too hahah I have a coat but I want a longer one :P Also liked both the second and the last sweater you tried on you. Looks like didnt end up with either of them though. Loved coming along shopping love that kind of vlog x
Hey guys!!! I've been following Samantha Maria for about ten years, and she's inspired me to start vlogging! If you have time, please check it out... I just started grad school, so I'm vlogging about my PhD experience. Sam, if you see this, I hope you'll check it out, too! (I posted this comment on one other video, but I'll stop now because I don't want to spam :o )
The blue coat was looking super good on you.
Isn't her foundation a little bit orange in this video? Especially in the beginning..?or is it just me maybe 🤔😂
You always look so so beautiful and i love you as a brunette, it is so natural and fresh on you 😘
I NEED that coat.
Samantha you're a sweetheart !! Really enjoyed watching this video, this coat looks great on you :-)
LOVED THIS!! please do more, shopping is my favourite thing xD
Love the lip colour on you! Do you think it'd be good for someone who struggles with applying lipstick?
Loved come shopping with me vlogs, would be interesting to see where you go for coffee/food/drinks when you're in london! I always love trying new places and would be interesting to see where you enjoy going!
Feus de Bois candle is the most beautiful candle at diptique I burn it summer winter spring dont care love it. goes well with the lavender. I burn both when putting my babaa to bed. very soothing.
the Tomato colored jumper was amazing on you! It maked you pop!
You look so good and this was a great vlog!!
I've seen other british youtubers do the Bourjois lipstick test, and their video was marked as an AD. Isn't this one an AD as well?
What was the name of your Jo Malone perfume?  You're gorgeous!
I love the coat.
love the 2nd jumper and the boss bitch coat lol! :)
Love to watch your videos Sam. You look amazing wearing that lipstick and your hair looks so so nice too. You seem so happy and I'm glad for you 🤗 Love the coat and I'm in love with that blue ruffle dress 😍😍😍 Lots of love from Holland
i'm going to head up to london i thought she would be living in london. Anyone can help me here?
I live in Amsterdam and tried the same coat in & other stories! Loved it! So soft. But was a bit worried about all the rain in fall and winter. What do you think? Will it ruin the coat..?
Just watched about 8 of your vlogs 😂😂 #sammicatchup but seriously loved every single one!
❤ your vids so much . You have great understated style
Love the video I need to go shopping with u lol 🙌🏼✨
You didn't really pick the best colour to be testing out because it's so similar to your lip colour. Just a suggestion to try a darker or bolder colour next time
I loooooove the first red sweater
God this channel is shit..
I loveeee ❤️ the black boots. Does anyone know the brand of the boots?
I am OBSESSED with the coat!! I need something like it in my life!
Which red jumper did you choose? My favourite was the second one
If I were to visit London, I would ask you to go shopping with me! love your blogs sam!
Absolutely LOVE the coat 😍
The coat looks so good on you! I definitely think you made the right choice - stylish and classy 😍 xoxo
yaaay I love this blog. where are the high shine pointed boots you were wearing from? x
<3 You pull of so many looks. Love your style. You inspire me to create my own style and experiment out of my comfort zone.
I'd love to see more of these videos 🙌🏼
😍 Oh I love love the black coat! It looks so great on you. I'm from Florida so of corse we don't get the weather to wear a coat like that. Also the earrings are beautiful!
It's interesting to see you debate investing on a winter coat since those are the things I find myself willingly splurging on. About 5 years ago I bought a €150 coat and a €50 and while the first one is still going strong, the second has been replaced after a year of wear because it was wrecked. I would rather invest in such a staple than in trendier pieces such as jackets and shirts.
You look so happy! Love seeing you this way 😊❤
Loved this video!! I really love how we get to see  the thought process behind what you choose to buy and not just the haul portion of the video. By the way what foundation are you wearing because your makeup looks amazing in this video :)
Loved it:) def would enjoy if you do those more :) xx love the coat, suits you so well
I love this video! Here in Denmark we have a coat/Blazer that reminds you very much of the one you looked at in Mango. It's called 'neo noir wales coat', and it's really good quality, and it fits so well!! <3
YES PLEASE, do more videos like this if you can, seriously it makes me feel like I'm with you, going around shopping :D and also its obviously so awesome to be able to see what kind of staple pieces you choose to buy!
I haven't watched you before but this was fun!
I really enjoy come shopping with me videos (:
Yes more videos like this please! Love your coat btw! 👏
That blue coat on you was EVERYTHING 😍😍
The lipsticks look great. And the color you chose looks great. I just feel like they will be so drying. All the long lasting ones are. I might try one. Love the coat you bought.
Love these type of videoes! Definitely do more please! xx
Yeah made my day as usual
I loved the blue one as well :) You looked very nice with it too. Probably I'm telling you because I love blue color.
where are your boots from?
This hair color and texture reminds me of Mariah Carey in the 90s
Well done for vlogging when it was so busy!!! I think I would have chickened out xx
Almost 500k!!! I remember watching your get ready with me while you were in uni
I enjoy your videos because your personality isn't fake and cloying. You just seem authentic and down to earth.
anyone know the song in the back at 6:07?
Song name and artist please @6.23
Loving your hair right now Sam!  The colour the texture, it's so suits you!
When you showef the lip color range; my eye went straight to the color you chose to wear.  It's a lovely color. Good choice girlie. Also, you looked really good in the orangy-red jumper. It was a nice Fall color.
Please do more of these!!! So in love with the coat, great video :)
Hi Sammi, just curious why don't you wear blush?
Love it! Samy where is your bag from?
The second red jumper looked lovely on you, I hope you bought it x
I love this video style and hearing your thought process about picking out pieces and then deciding which one to get if you do buy one
I love seeing your shopping videos
Loved following you round! Also, as a longtime subscriber it was cool because I knew which pieces were more Sam haha. 😘\n\nI think I will wait a while before getting the bourjois lipsticks.. whenever a brand does a big campaign and sponsors a lot of Youtubers etc, it makes me suspicious. Lol. I want a product that sells itself.
Loved everything about this video!
Great buys Sammi!
Sam! Your eyebrows looks amazing 😍
I forgot, Zara has amazing red sweaters
❤️
Love your darker hair!
Bourjois lipsticks are amazing :)
Love your outfit!
love that coat !
Love watching your shop.
Love your shopping vlogs keep them coming
Loved this video!
Thank you Sammi!! Love your vlogs :) <3
love that coat!
Love your style :D
Love the vlog, Sam 💕
One word - Lint Roller.  Beautiful coat. x
❤️💜🖤💛💙💚
Love your vlogs! Xx
Yesssss Sammi! You are so great at styling I love videos like this
I love him so much he is so funny XD
If he got a camera man the guys back would hurt😂😂😂\nI don't have anything against tiny I'm just saying
The next hey look at me looser

Prepare pit bulls grow so freaking fast my pit bull chevy is only 9 months old and he is as big as me

Im yours fan and logan paul fan too!!!!

You or the cut 🐕
MY DOG IS NAMED ARYA NO LIE
Can I get a shout out please
Even is the best dad ever
OMG Oreo is so cute I wish I have a dog like that
Hey Dwarf Mamba AKA Evan! Lol! Anyway, I want to say you're being an excellent dad to Aria so far, however, I thought I would let you know you do not need to be so worried about Aria getting worms, since you are keeping her inside until she gets her shots. Also, if Kong doesn't have any worms and has had his shots, then it should be okay for them to play together... I really wouldn't stress out too much with them hanging around each other... Yes there is always a chance and a risk, however! Worms are usually contracted through specific means... here is a brief condensed list of worms and how they are contracted:\n\n- Roundworms, are contracted through feces or while the puppy is still nursing.\n- Hookworms are contracted through the skin when grooming themselves, or puppies can get it from the mother.\n- Heartworms: a dog can only get heartworms from mosquito bites.\n- Whipworms: come from contaminated soil or can come from grooming\n- Tapeworms: come when a dog Grooms itself and they swallow a a flea that is a carrier of tapeworms.\n- Ringworm is actually a skin infection that's brought on by a specific fungus...\n\nThere are other diseases you probably should be more concerned with for a puppy, especially since worms are very treatable, but you only mention she needs her worm shots updated. If she has everything else, like to prevent her from getting Puppy Parvo, which is fatal... Then you should be good to go since you're keeping her inside and maintaining hygiene! I just wanted to let you know, I want to let you know you're doing great things for your dog already! But I wouldn't stress it out too much since you're keeping her inside and keeping clean (and everyone else's hands clean)... So, I would not worry too much about letting her play with Kong. After all, socialization for puppies is incredibly important for them, for when they get older! Okay New Dad! You're doing great! Keep up the good work! :-)
Your dog is almost as big as you
Lol how can u drive
What kind of dog is this
evan you gotta find your own video style 😂 you literally copied logan
I don't think dwarf mamba knows that a dog can be overweight

Love that dog!! So cute
Puts fox and water bowls above outlet with something plugged in yup
She’s so cute!!!!!!
Now if I could, I'd be stealing every cute dog an internet star owns, and I would take it as my own. For example: Aria (Evan), Paris (Faze, Alissa), Kong (Logan), etc
HE IS A VAMPIRE!
So cool my name is carter
now i can say that i'm finally a dwarf♡
what type of dog is it?
Hey Evan I would recommend getting treats and food made in the us because the stuff made in China has been know to make dogs sick and sometimes kill them

Please make that Daniel sampler liquid blush video!!! Thank you xx
Absolutely gorgeous! You are a natural, stunning beauty and I learn so much from watching your techniques! Love me some Pixiwoo!
You look gorgeous however you do your makeup. This one is particularly pretty, though. The UD primer you mentioned...has it been discontinued?
omg please where'd you get your earrings and the necklace??
You have such pretty eyes! I love how dark hair brings out light eyes. I wish mine were lighter.
Good lawdy, I'm only 20 and my foundation ages my skin so much, making me look 80. My dream is to have my skin glow like yours even though I'm half your age :( Dry skin problems
Aaaaah you are sooo beautyful! I love this makeup and I will have to try it!
Hard to believe you are forty. Start dating again and have fun.
Easy piecey...all you need is her gorgeous mug or at the very least her piercing blue eyes...that's all and a bit of lip balm of course. #UghThoseEyes
I just share this every opportunity I get:\nChris Pratt = Crisp Rat.\nAnyhow, love your videos! I also love the sisterhood between you two.
The way you talked about Chris Pratt was so cute...you are gorgeous :)
I love this look. Simple and yet beautiful. Thank you. ❤️
My goodness you look so stunning, young, glowy and gorgeous!😍💕
That gloss in the last makes you just FUCKING GORGEOUS.
That is amazing. Just amazing. Thank you! I'm trying that look ASAP!
Hey guys, I was wondering if you could help. I have to take daily medication that can make me sweat a lot when I'm out and about and I find it really hard to do a face of make up that will then sit nicely, do you have any suggestions? Thank you! Xxx
When I look at you I see so much Bella Hadid!
SAM you look phenomenal- and in the real world, you can do so much better than a chris pratt/ryan gosling type. go get yours hon xo
I am very grateful for your natural look tutorials. That's what I'm looking for and good ones are fairly hard to come by.
Gorgeous! Can you do a full face waterproof make up routine?
i am a fan of the crazy arty looks but i loovooooed this video :) thanks sam .\nhave fun with dating x
Chris Pratts single......get in there girl! Do it for us All! 😂😂❤️
I always find that lip-makeup ruins the look...
sam is such a goddessssssss
RYAN GOSSLING & CHRIS PRATT? Really? Oh, Sam, you've got awful taste in men. IMO LOL\nYou're just horny, and that's okay.
So beautiful! You look like Helena Christensen!
When are the bleu brushes coming to U.S.?
You always look amazing but god damn you look stunning! 😍👌
You look lovely Sam. Very youthful and fresh. Love it!
Look forward to the Daniel Sandler vid. Would also love an updated skin routine from both you & Nic. X
*So gorgeous!! NEED all of those products, ASAP. BTW~ Isn't Chris Pratt single now??* 😜 𝕏𝕆.💕💋
Hope you went out and about after doing this look-sure to meet a man and get asked for a date! By all means, start dating-you are young, smart and beautiful-go for it!
Gorgeous Sam and good for you and dating😀👍xx
Sam do you recommend the CT Light Wonder Foundation for mature combination skin over 50? Thanks 😘
Go get your man girl!!!!!!
I know you are beautiful, but this is the prettiest I've ever seen you!! Amazing look, loved it!!
Good God is that a gorgeous look! I can't wait to try it out (once I get my acne cleared up...sob!) :)
I love these types of videos Sam when you are relaxed and chatting to us.  Also love this look x
Could you please talk more about the botox that you have? I remember a while ago you saying you'd had it and didn't like it. What changed your mind?
Beautiful makeup! Hope you will enjoy dating again 💓 (men, be aware 😎)
The best! Thank you. I'm taking notes - and thank you for the movie recommendations too. 🌸
I've been a bad subscriber and was startled to find out Sam is single! I thought she was dating someone for some time? Can somebody give me the rundown?
Love love the look... I have 4 Daniel Sandler blushes and adore them. I use them on my eyes too instead of shadow. You must get the shade Glow from Katie at Beauty & the Boutique... it's incredible for a sun kissed look. Can't wait for the D/S video
Please do an update on your eyebrows so we can see what the microblading looks like now!!
I’ve never watched one of your videos before. I have to say, this was completely mesmerizing. Incredible. I love your approach to makeup. Thank you!
I literally gasped when you said 40! You look amazing.
❤️ Sam since 2009 your the best!
bellissimo
What moisturisers do you use? :)
Love your chatty tutorials!
Your skin uhhh so perfict
Gorgeous look!
Kate Moss??
Sam you are way too hot to be single, get that dick girl
Hope you find someone worthy of you. Maybe you'll bump into Chris Pratt? 😍
I thought she was married! Anywaaay, go and date again!! You are a wonderful person!
You look amazing: but you talk way too much (in my opinion) (when it comes to dating) otherwise the looks ✌🏻
love your tutorials keep up the great work and happy birth day xoxo
Yes, I would love to see a Daniel Sandler blush video. You've always talked about them but they're not readily available so I've never had the chance to play with them. I'd also love to know how they wear and if they're suitable for oily skin. Thanks!
Love it! I also don't use mascara on my bottom lashes. I've found not using it on the bottom lashes makes my eyes look more awake. Such a simple yet stunning makeup. Thanks Sam x
such a fresh look
Hi, I really love your hair colour but I don't know how to ask my hairdresser to do the same? My base colour is like yours but I have never died it. Are yours low lights? In what colour? Thank you 😊
Oh my, you look like Autumn Giselle !!!
What eyelash comb did you use ? A real technique one ?
i am sooo waiting for the daniel sander blush video!
Would love to see the colors of that blush!!
I absolutely love your necklace!! Could you tell us where it's from?
Your necklace the a with dots on where are it from? Lovely makeup I do it a lot.
Gorgeous and simple!! Definitely start dating again and please do a Fenty Beauty review. Love ya.
I tried this today but substituted the base for Armani Maestro and Nars duo for my oily skin. Worked well Thanks!
Love this so much! I really hope you do a video for the Daniel Sandler watercolour blushes as I've been wanting to try them for ages but not sure which to go for xx
Beautiful. Can I ask where your necklace is from? It is really pretty.
hi,  Wondering where you get your botox done?
Beautiful! What shade is your nail polish? Love it!
What is your nail polish? It’s beautiful!
Gorgeous
Really beautiful!
Really pretty earrings!
Stoked for the Daniel Sandler water colour blush vid
Blooooooomin lovely xxxxx

Lmao Ryan gosling comment 😂
Stunning!! 😊
This is a gorgeous look on you Sam! Also, as I've said before, I love your earrings, very stylish\nI like your nail polish too, what is it please?
Out of curiosity, do the CT light wonder foundations oxidise a bit darker?  I thought I'd be a 3 or 4 as I'm Asian but turns out, I'm also very fair, so after a bit of trying and sampling, I bought the shade 2, which seems to suit me!  I love this look as I'm also 40 (though 40+) but I look a few years younger and my style is a more natural look.  I am of course envious of your lush lashes and eyes.  I have very hooded eyes nowadays and it's just not worth wearing mascara or trying the feline flick anymore.  Short false eyelashes from Japan (as they have shorter range more suitable for Asian eyes) work better as mascara just goes all over the hood, the bottom of the eyes etc and makes a big mess... (even waterproof mascara).
She's a beast.
*She better put that damn cork in her ass*

please can you get Tiffany Haddish and Aziz Azari to come on and eat some wings. i dont think you'll make through with her she is too hilarious
Please get Conan O'Brien on!!
Syikes is a vicious sodomite lesbian. I mean vicious as can be. if u get into confortation wit this beast you better boldly bring the business to that azz. Cause she's the beast666 within.
The only reason she kept going is the racist stereotype of whites being unable to take hot foods. She didn't want to get punked.
GET THAT GUY FROM BORAT!!!
You gonna make this lady catch a heart attack
God dammit man. When Wanda picked that wing up and kept on pushin, I found myself, clapping for here. You go girl!!!
Fucking didn't even break a sweat. She sounds like she's dying but doesn't look it, dayum. That was me I'd be having a running nose, mouth, eyes, pits, everyting.
Milk does not help.
Glad you you made it on the short, omg I remember you on the episode of curb your enthusiasm when the world was ending😂😂 didn't think you'd be on hot ones wtf

Piston firing order. 153624.\n15 is to young \n36 is to old\n24 is juuuussssstttt right.
One of the greater channels on YouTube in my opinion
That's right, sleep is really underrated. Schools need to learn that people don't learn better by having to cram more information. They need to be sane to absorb and understand information. Also, pay your interns.
I know your cousin, Mark.
I can't keep up with profs if I were to write everything by hand, I would miss a lot of information. Better to write it out on my own time later.
King Philip Came Over From Great Spain, AKA Kingdom Phylum Class Order Genus Species... My teacher tought me that.
How do I remember this video?
So many awesome tips asapscience!!! thank you for this <3
this did not help me learn 4 pages of irish
The combination between badminton and tennis isn’t really accurate. Badminton is very different and doesn’t even come close to tennis in any kind of way, except it’s both played with a racket. Further nice video!
I just automatically learn things when I'm interested in it...For instance, BTS.\n\nI KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM without studying
ok so i have a biology quizz tomorrow... i have to memorise 15 pages its 12 am at midnight and im watching youtube fml
Raging Martians Invaded Venus Using X-ray Guns WHY DIDN'T I USE THAT IN COLLEGE???
Hey, it turns out to be pretyyyy good
So, to summarize \nSkip the laptop\nStudy sleep study \nModify practice slightly\nGet some exercise \nSay it out loud\nStay hydrated \nReward yourself
Man this channel is a lifesaver
What if I handwrite notes on surface pro?
I'm waiting for the pill to skip the learning part and make it instant.
I would do all of this.... \n\n\n\n\n\nIf I wasn't lazy enough.
I don’t understand this,  I need to understand this by watching this video again!
Focus is incredibly important to learning because it helps release the hormone BDNF, which in turn helps you focus more.  This is how babies learn!  All of these tips are great, but at the end of the day, focus is key to learning and retaining new information.
I didn't learn anything from this video...
Thanx.....next month my exams are starting...will try these out in bio for sure😊😇
sorry what was that I was busy commenting
1:53 Even a quick walk around the baaak (slight voice crack)
So what ur saying is...teachers should give us money for getting a question right , and it’ll make me smarter, I love this video I GOTTSS PROOF
That's interesting. If I am made to read something out loud, then I have little to no understanding of what I just read. If I am allowed to read silently, then it's very easy for me to comprehend. Apparently, the opposite is true for the general populace. Hmm.
I'm learning how to learn faster...brilliant\n\n\n.org

When you're in chemistry and actually trying to memorize the electromagnetic spectrum
Hiiii, I really look up to your channel and it inspired me to make a channel myself, I was wondering if you would be willing to give me a shoutout. Haha I doubt you would with 6.9 Million subscribers but hey a kid can dream.
I'm 15 years out of high school and I still remember the reactivity series thanks to Pot-so-camal-zirol. mnemonics rule

What is happening in your head when you have a head ache
Wtf ? Learning in the morning taking a break and learning in the evening is the same as learning in the evening sleeping and learning in the morning, they study at the same times, the sleep at the same times and they take a break at the same times X.x
why am i watching this ? because my exams are coming up
Is Beyonce an alien? Yeah, i read that article and it looked promising 🌝
I wonder how much the typing vs handwriting difference may correlate with people who at a younger age wrote mostly by hand versus typing on a computer. Perhaps for people who used almost exclusively handwriting to write stuff from ages 5 to 14 or so have better retention with handwriting, specially if they type slowly, whereas perhaps people who got used to type a lot in the same age window would have better retention typing than handwriting, specially if they're slow with handwriting. I've heard many people don't even know cursive scripts these days, not being able to write or read it.

I'd like to see a video on how long you can be drunk for, sometimes I wake up 7-8 hours later and I'm still pretty tipsy and my friend says you can only be drunk for like 4-5 hours if you sleep it off

Can you make a video about:\nHow stereo types / modern gender roles affect both Men & Women in a psychological way i.e. how it affects thier decision making, habbits etc. :)
Awww, my cat was called Daisy before she died last year. If I ever have a little girl I want their name or middle name to be flower related as I was so close to her. X
I've always liked the names James (after Paul McCartney), Martha and Olga for babies. But I prefer thinking of kitten names myself😂
Sky from mama mia is a babe 😍
Nothing wrong with the name issy, just saying...
Teddy is on my list too !
I love your eyeshadow in this video 😊
In Ireland griffin is a second name 😂
Lol I’m in the same class as Claudia Winkleman’s daughter so I always meet Claudia winkleman! ❤️
Full name Idea Nova daisy meaning New day
Is this her hint of saying she's pregnant?? 🤰
Are you still wanting to change your name? Xx
Your make up is goals!
I love the name Claudelle or Evie or Summer or Rosie or Lowen for girls (also love autumn too) for boys I love Charlie (and for a girl too) and James and Noah and Casey and Evan and Nico!!!
We have a horse named Nova! It's because she was born in November 😊 \nShe is so unique and gorgeous so I think it's become super perfect.
If you like bohdi but it’s not European enough. How about Brodie? That’s very similar. Love you 💜
What app is it that you use for your cover photos?? Just got myself an iPad Pro 😁
Summer will be her top 3
When you put the girls names in pink I was like, hmmm I wonder how much shit she would get if she put the boys names in blue! I don't want children, but if I did I'd only want boys lol: Finn, Rory & Elisha! You should have a look into Jewish/Hebrew names Gabs, there's some lovely names that I've never really come across.
i never comment but you look so beautiful and stylish !
Daisy is now on my list lol
When I heard Blair, I thought of two things. Tony Blair and The Blair Witch Project.\n\nSorry Gabby! 😂
I LOVE THE NAME VIENNA
When you pronounced Hudson, it sounded like Hoodson. I had to read the name on the screen. When you said shorten it to Hud, it sounds like Hood. I love accents. 🙂 Out of curiosity, how do the English pronounce hood? Is hud and hood pronounced the same?
I really like the names Essi and Autumn xx
my name is amber and my second name is Nova and my whole life I went by the name Nova and I've never heard anyone else with the name nova😊
You look gorgeous omg 😍
What eyeliner are you using in your waterline? & does it actually stay put and smudge proof all day? Ps love this look & vid!❤
I personally love the name Izzy but I know loads of people that call me Isobel because they don't like the shortened version 🤷🏻‍♀️
My name is Isabella 
My best friend is called Isabella no one ever calls her Bella or izzy because she hates being called anything but Isabella
I love the name Aprillll
Love you so much 💜 also I love Vienna, def putting that on my potential baby names list
Just for the record I've known about 4 people named Autumn and yes it is such a nice name!
My name was featured in this hahaha! Daisy is weird because it's kind of common but then again I don't actually know many other Daisy's. This is so funny as my dog is called Teddy Edward and I actually know a girl called Autumn with strawberry blonde hair! Such a coincidence. Love this video as always Gab and all of the names you have such a cool and different taste✨🌹
vienna is my #1 😭 a mum once called out to her gorgeous little daughter in the hairdresser saying “vienna” and i fell in love, it’s so beautiful
My nephews called Hudson and I definitely agree about it being American sounding but his brothers are called Lennon & Jaxon so they go well together
Sky is a beautifullll boys name but nobody has ever agreed with me😂 reminds me of mamma Mia aha
Oh my gosh Gabs you are glowing!! I want to come round to yours so you can do my makeup this beautiful haha ❤️
I love the boy name Clay 😊
Me and my cousin Isabella were able to choose my baby cousins name so we called her Gabriella Claudia! 💗
You remind me of poppy deyes so much 😮
Hi Gabbie I've got a great video idea for you I've snapped you it it's a pll tag and it's so fun and I'd love you to do it  it has so many questions that I'd love to know as Ik your a big pll fan like me xx ps Ly❤️❤️
I know someone called Autumn!!
Aww one of my best friends is called Liesel xxx
My sisters middle name is nova
Liesel sounds too much like weasel for me. But love all the other names you talked about! I too love the sound of music!
I have a niece named Izabella. We call her Bella
Also I hope this isn't too random, but I really think Desirae is such a nice name ^_^ xxxx
Love this video Gab!! At my work placement there is a girl called Autumn and she's so cute!! Loving the darker hair, it looks so good on you and it suits you so much, love you always!! Xx
Oh my god my childhood teddy was called Teddy Edward 😂😂😂
Love the names you love omg !! Sky is my favourite boy name, reminds me of Sophie’s fiancé in Mamma Mia the movie 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
My friends called autumn and her brother is called archer. Feel like you may have a similar asthetic to her mum 😁
Your hair looks so healthy and shinny, woah!! I'm thinking of dying it darker as well, love it😍 Out of all the names you said in the video, I love Blair, Nova, Daisy and Vienna, I would probably use Vienna too!
my parents let me name my cat when I was 8 and I named him tedward 😂
Ok so when you said Monica I thought that Isabella would be a good first name with Monica in the middle... Then you mentioned Isabella literally five seconds later 😱
Omggg I’m called Viana but it’s pronounced Vienna 💗 love you soo much
I’ve got a nephew called teddy xx
Not even pregnant but I know that I'm calling my first daughter Skye
Me and my brother both have four letter names because my parents didn't want us to have nicknames which hasn't worked 😂 Esme-Ezz and Toby-Tobs 😊
Hope your feeling better x
Love Autumn and Vienna ❤️ xx
I watch the sound of music with my nana, and we have bonded so much over that c
I absolutely adore the name Freddie for a girl 😍 my cousin has a friend called that and I think it's just gorgeous 😍😍
My surname is HUDSON!!!!!!!!x
nooo way!! i call my dog teddy edward x
My auntie is called Monica and her daughter is called Claudia 😘
My name is Monika and I hated it almost all my life. Now Imm 29 and I actually quite like it. Maby because I feel this name is more unique in Scotland where I live than in Poland where I come from.
I love the name Vienna but it's far too similar to my name❤️😭 ( Sienna)
i bloody love your dark hair! it suits you so much what the heck!!! love you xx
I love the French name Ninon so much but of course my sister decided to call her daughter Nina so my husband now doesn't like the fact that there will be a Nina and a Ninon in the family 😂 otherwise I love Stella and Emilia.
lol I hate it so much when people call me Izzy its such a rank nickname I don't mind Bella though
My sisters are called Claudia, Gabriella and I'm Isabella 😂❤
glad I'm not the only person who likes the name Autumn love it :)
Daisy here 🙋🏼 I feel like its such an old persons name hahah but glad ur a fan
It's actually spelled Bodhi, my nephew has this name x
Smokin make up 😍😍😍 can u do a tutorial of that pleaaassee 😭
My baby sister is called Bonnie! Xx
My name is Monica lol Xx
I'm called Kate, but I noticed how you said you can't shorten it, and for me that's true however every single teacher decides to call me Katie and It annoys me sooo much x love u gabby
Two things: 1. You look gorgeous here. You always look gorgeous obviously but I am loving the eye look & your hair length. 2. Great idea for a video!! I've always had a long list of baby names on my phone...I mean I've had one since college which was like 8 years ago 😂😂. Thought I was the only single girl with a list of baby names haha. Ok a couple of my favorites for a girl are Nora and Holland. For a boy I love Rafe and Mac.
Can you do this makeup look? It’s so so pretty You look THE BOMB

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk

His Jay Z was spot on.
Why is Jaime holding back!
nobody wants to be in the Ford Focus
You can't say no to the presidential package😂
This is so rigged
Jamie fox kanye kinda sounds like terrence howard 😹😹😹 jamie is amazing and Jay is insanely good too good 😹😹😹
Jamie was being nice and passing the easy ones off to Jay. He's a lot more humble in his older years, cause old school Jamie would have stolen the spotlight easily.
Im sure the used car is kim actually 😂
That Jay-Z laugh is so wicked😂\nNever knew he laughs like that
VOTE ALL REPUBLICANS OUT OFF OFFICE 2018

...Barack Obama and Beyonce...  And to answer your next question, Yes. It is because they are black, like most prominent political figures and entertainment performers.
Am I the only one in love with Jay Pharaoh at this moment?
relieve stomach second largely institution full consultant angel.
And what is Jamie Foxx net worth again? Why can't he donate to help Texas why does he have to do an impression right so another company can donate???? Come on wake the fuck up
Jay should Raw or Delirious he would kill that.
I'm sorry Jay pharoah just isn't funny sum of his impressions r good others not so much
Check out this new South African banger right here https:youtu.be/Dkv-hz0IANk. It's a wavy hip--hop record you'd bump on your way to a lituation somewhere coastal and sunny.

It seems like they asked Jay what impressions he does every time he's on TV and then just gave Jamie people who don't have any notable speech patterns
gotta give it up for jay pharaoh you can tell he came from a good family. parents look like good people.
Kanye 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂

Closing in on 1 MILLION subscribers!  Thanks for watching!!\nSupport this weeks charity - https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/mexico-earthquake-relief-fund/\n\nStart Halloween right, come see Nostalgia Critic's new review of IT (2017) on the big screen with cast and crew!\nOct 4th It Review Screening - https://theawesomestore.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=29998\nOct 5th It Review Screening - https://theawesomestore.com/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=29999

Finally after all these years they're almost at 1 million subs. Can't wait👍🏼
5:06 \nJabs at Bayformers always get a chuckle out of me
To Err Is Human
you are just a unfunny and boring version of CinemaSins
Doug , thank you for helping Mexico , I´ve seen so few people taking about it outside my country, thank you very much
That proposal was both gross and adorable.
Taika Waititi is in this movie?! Crazy.
I gotta say I do have to agree this was not that great of a movie but at the same time I did enjoy it the first time seeing it just not any time after that
The narrator in the movie's intro sounds a bit like Obi Wan.
What's that music used for the IT preview?
He needs to review Miss Peregrines home for Peculiar children. Do yourself a favor and see the movie FIRST before reading the books
I think a great nostalgia-ween episode would be tremors.
DeathBattle: Deadpool vs. Pinkie Pie.  That's what you're missing, Doug.
Man, what I wouldn't do to go to that It screening..... To bad I live in Australia lmao 
Critic will your it rewiew come on youtube.
I actually enjoy this movie. Don't ask me why. I don't really know, I just do.
Please don't let Malcom play deadpool again. Nearly as bad as xmen origins wolverine
Yikes, the guardians of the universe you mean fetuses
Why didn't you harp about how the guy who became a villain at the end was named Sinestro and the movie treated it like it was a surprise.
When are you gonna review IT on YouTube
19:08 the sad thing is sky high made more money and has better effects then this film
I wanna see your screening Channel Awesome but I live in Canada!😭 I'm going to cry now
I wanna see your review on the big screen but I live in Australia and don't have a passport :( 🙁
Just some suggestions I just wanted to throw out there using quotes that the characters say to best summarize what lies ahead for the Critic (Reply if you know what they are):\nMy grandfather is dead.\nAre you like a crazy person?\nDo the thing!
I watched this in an advace screening in a teather full of fans, guys in costumes an all, and I remember how, when the movie ended, there was just a sad silence. Normally, no matter how bad or mediocre there is some kind of cheer or applause. Not this time.
Wouldn’t it‘d been awesome if Doug actually got Ryan Reynolds for this?
The Green Lantern Corps is a rip-off of E.E. Doc Smith's 'Lensmen' series, galactic policemen with superpowers granted by the Galactic Lens.
It's a sad commentary on movie making when Nostalgia Critic is better at telling the story than the people who were given millions of dollars to make the movie!  HOLY *BOBBY THE BRAIN HEENAN* , SPORTS FANS, this is messed up!
i  know you dont do tv series, but if you do, please sin ghost whisperer. and just to make it easier i have listed 5 things i hate about the series.\n \n1- the main character (melinda). the biggest cry baby, for a tough character she sure cries alot. i swear if i had a dollar for every episodes she cried i'd be a millionaire by now. i mean she meets dead people all the time she should get used to it by now. she is always the center of attention, her ghosts are more important than anyone else, yes that bothers me to no end. and call me a feminist or whatever, but having her showing her cleavage in EVERY.SINGLE.EPISODE. can get very distracting, very annoying very fast. i mean if that's what it takes to get ratings then that is just pathetic. i swear most of the time she goes to work in her night gown i can see her cleavage. what also annoys me is that she keeps talking in that whispering-about to faint voice. speaking of fainting, she does that alot, just asking for more attention.\n\n2-  (jim) the husband. i feel like the show made up a fantasy fictional husband that just wont work in real life. that's jim. he cooks, he cleans and melinda on the other hand wakes up at 3 am night to go search for her ghosts in the streets while leaving her husband to worry. she does that like more than once. there is an episode where she gets stuck inside a cave and jim has to look for her and when he finds her she bursts out crying like a fucking baby that she is and he just calms her down. now if that was in real life he'd be yelling at her not to run off in the middle of the night like a lunatic. or he could just divorce her on the spot. he told her many times that these ghost business should wait because he wants to spend more time with her but she is like nope, the ghosts are no.1. accept me for who i am. fucking selfish hoebag. i never saw this woman do any wife duties. i never saw her cook or clean, its always the husband. and before anyone jumps in again and says i am sexist, jim works in the paramedic and was a firefighter before. he runs around saving people. both his jobs puts huge muscle strain on him. yet we see him at home cooking like he wasnt even tired at all. in real life husbands would just remove their shoes and fall on the couch sleeping. all melinda does is stand in one spot selling or running off leaving the work to someone else while she chases her ghosts or drinks coffee. there are many times he rings her to see if she is ok and she is like sorry jim then hangs up. one time her husband told her off becasue it got too dangerous but she yelled at him saying stuff like don't tell me what to do i've got to save those ghosts!. and when he wanted to become a doctor and study outside of grandview (he was also trying to get her to stay away from danger), but she snapped at him saying what about me and my life and my store. she is fucking selfish. she is a bad wife. period.\n\n3- all fathers are bad, all mothers are saints. there are many times were some ghost fathers who did wrong but they arent bad themselves, but melinda treats them like criminals because she keeps seeing her father in them. for a gift like that she sure knows how to abuse it and the ghosts. there is even one episode in christmas, where the a father was talking to his ex-wife about her affair with another man and the son might not be his, the wife snapped at him saying i cant believe you'd actually do a paternity test!. well, it's HIS FUCKING RIGHT TO KNOW IF HIS SON IS HIS OR NOT. fucking whore. and i swear to god, i knew i saw it coming, he receives the test results by mail and melinda ACTUALLY convinces him to accept his child even if it's not his because it christmas the season of forgiving. and he tears the letter! i literally screamed at the tv and hit my fist so hard it hurt. in what justice do you treat your husband like that? the wife goes fucking around and then carries a bastard that has a huge risk its not the father and the father has to forgive the wife??!! NO FUCK THAT YOU FUCKING WHORE. FUCK YOU MELINDA. and also the episode where the college teacher payne knew his ghost wife was cheating with someone else and melinda AGAIN asks him to forgive his wife just so she could go to the light but he refuses (having every right to do so) but the ghost just backfires at him. \n\n4- everyone in grandview is rude. i dont know why they do that. is it to scare me not to visit grandview or just to make melinda look more like an angel? but i have seen this more than once. every one she meets and their first words to her are who are you? what do you want? excuse me? they all look at her antagonizingly. there is even one episode where she wants to sells some stuff and the receptionist looks at her from bottom to top with the biggest attitude i've ever seen. and its not like she meets her again, no, this is like a one time encounter in the whole freakin series. it makes no sense and it makes me NOT want to live in grandview.\n\n5- there is no judgment, everyone goes to the light. yes including killers, rapists, wrongdoers, whores, liars, thieves, criminals, kidnappers, Sociopaths etc.\n\ni'd rather watch supernatural than this crap
He really redefines the meaning of the word nostalgia
Loved the I.T Crowd reference.
Honestly I’m somewhat shocked you didn’t get Ryan Reynolds to work with you on this.  Hard to believe he’d miss an opportunity to rip apart his second most hated role.
The alein ring summons him? In every other GOOD telling the ring goes to find him! THAT WAS SO STUPID!!
That generic nerd character...\n\nOh look its NOT David Ayoade.
That really came out in 2011? Feels so much longer.
Like for the IT Crowd and Good Burger reference, you smashed it Nostalgia critic!!!!! XD 😂😂😂😂
Hey, Critic! If you want real nostalgia, and a burning need for some REALLY strong liquor to get you through a video, try a review of Kiss Meets The Phantom of the Park. It's so bad, it's comical.
Say what you want about this shitty movie. But the introduction was not bad..
I was about to watch this film. Thank gosh I watched this to know how bad the film is.
I was invited to devil boner's and hyper fan Girl's wedding!
Alright I haven't see the video yet. But I have my vodka bottle and a glass and I am ready for the Deadpool references game. ^-^
Imagine how great would be see Major Thunder review with some russian movie critics, like BadComedian or Chuck review...
6:13 as someone who's in the military, that technology is better than what we are given.
Will the IT review be posted on the channel because I don't live we're the event is
Does anyone remember when Duck Dodgers did a crossover with Green Lantern?
I really hope Ryan Reynolds stumbles upon this.
they got many things wrong with this  film but they also got a lot of stuff right
They should have went with the black one.
Never had to forward a Youtube Video because of ads and long intro. :( seems to be a trend here now, as compared to the old days
The most exciting thing in the Green Lantern movie was the 1971 Dodge Challenger he owned.
I thought the visuals were alright it's the writing that killed it for me
free society everyone share the idea shut down the government close down the banks open the borders implement free reasource based economy lets free our selfs. Free society society watch venusproject
this is something from Michael bay film
I would take a bus to go about four states over to Chicago if I could, but it's on the same weekend as a show that I'm performing at. ;A; DAMMIT!
Omg they brought back the characters for however briefly! I love hyper!!!!!
3:24 Love that smile couldn't be less honest
Nostalgia Critic you should review the hobbit 1977
While I think this film is not as terrible as depicted here it is indeed still rather uninspired. For a better fix, one can always watch the Green Lantern animated series :)
Personally, it would’ve been kind of funny if, when trying to figure out the Green Lantern oath, they referenced the Duck Dodgers version.
With Jigsaw coming out soon you guys should do Saw! It's like 13 years old, that's old enough right?
Why is NC taking a shit in the thumbnail
the intro made me feel like i was waiting for a movie to begin on a vhs tape.
I think you're over reacting, movie wasn't that bad.
Does anyone blame Ryan Reynolds for the failures of Green Lantern, Blade Trinity, or X-Men Origins: Wolverine?
What even happened in this movie 0____o
Jesus christ that deadpool shit was cringey as living hell
20:19 - 21:06\n\nYou know what's even worse about Parallax's effects, is that THE F***ING TOY THAT PROMOTED THE MOVIE based on him looks more realistic!\n\nNo seriously, he's was creepy, he looked more true to the comics while still looking new, AND like the comics he looked like a living radioactive explosion!\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oyPBOYj8L._SL1300_.jpg\n\nIt's pretty bad when you realize the toy company could've made a more accurate Green Lantern movie than this.
I thought Critic already did a review of this?
Not even gonna mention how the geeky guy is Taika Waititi? You know, the famous New Zealand comedy director? Making the new Thor movie? Anything? No? Well... okay then.
Doug looks more and more like Maynard James Keenan every time I see him...
I didn't love this movie but I didn't despise it. Theres some bad CGI and writing but some of the scenes are decent enough. I loved Reynolds as Hal though, I thought he did a great job with what he had. I'd love to see him in another Green Lantern film...with a different writing crew and director. He would kill as a green lantern if given the opportunity to do it right. Can you imagine Reynolds nailing not only one comic book hero but two?
Oddly enough, the spin off Animated Show: Green Lantern TAS is 1000x better quality and was only canceled because the movie tanked. Seriously, go watch it.
Can you please do a review of Kingdom hearts? That would be cool! I also love this video bye the way! 👍👍👍

Ballshit face I've come to bargain\n(Comment section do your thing)
Trying to copy cinema sins too much
9:19, I don't why, but his voiceover cracks me up!
LOL at 18:18, LOOK I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON NOW!
What are you missing? Stop doing sketches problem solved.
Devil boner respects WAHmen

You should get Louise Pentland on your podcast! Xx
Matching colour again 😂
Vlogmas? :D
Welcome back! We've missed you ❤️ love your podcast btw! I'm expecting twin girls with 3 weeks left before my C-section, so it's really inspiring!!! ❤️
Shouldn't the title of this actually be Recently I've Been? 😁
Love to see you back Gi, glad you've had time to spend with your family. I listened to your podcast with Emma Willis and Izzy Judd, both were brilliant in different ways. I will be using the Jo Elvin, Frankie Bridges and the next one on Monday to do my long run to. Hopefully doing 8 miles on Monday. Have a great day Gi x
We've missed you! But I'm excited to read the book 😁
Just finished 'Billy and Me' and really like it and I have 2 questions:\n1) any chance it's gonna be published in Poland?\n2) is this fair to put boyfriend standards this high with Billy? Me as single now have to take normal boy?
..... HAVING A WEDDING #tom'sweddingspeech
I’ve been losing sleep
Haha let buzz and buddy help with the Halloween make up this year haha
You 100% used ‘lately’ instead of ‘recently’ to stop the McFly reference comments...🙈
Hi Gi, firstly I absolutely love you and your gorgeous family! I've been watching your vlogs for years now and you always make me smile! My friend and I recorded this song for a competition https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=dtIfZLWQcCw and I was wondering if you could please have a listen? It;s the first thing we've done like this and are a bit anxious. Thank you xx
When (I assume Tom) walked past in the hallway at 6.26 I totally freaked out 😂
I have hyper mobility too
I’ve got hypermobility and fibromyalgia!!! I do get where you’re coming from Gi ❤️
My husband and I just found out that we are expecting a baby in December. We had no idea that we were pregnant. But now that we know I've been reading  Happy Mum Happy Baby. And I have cried several times. Thank you for saying everything that needs to be said to future parents! Everyone has there own way of parenting and no one way is right and I'm so glad that I ordered it.
Would love to here Anna Saccone-Joly on your podcast another YouTube Mum xx
I LOVE the podcast! I listen to it while nursing ^^
I've recently been diagnosed with hyper mobility and hyperalgesia (hyper sensitivity to pain) and it was explained to me as a hyper flexibility or double jointedness in the bones and when the joints do overextend it puts stress in the nerves which is what causes the pain later on
Muscle pain is horrid i feel ya girl
Will there be a book signing for some kind of wonderful??!!!
Hyper mobility is a killer! I have it mainly in my knees too x
Gi, you look absolutely beautiful! This lighting suits you!
we've been Trying to conceive now for 7 years it honestly felt like it was never going to happen i saw rubbish doctors that where really insensitive and i've just started with a new team in a different hospital i had my 2nd appointment yesterday the difference it makes having people that are good at what they do and compassionate is huge and at the moment i'm feeling much more positive about things i've just started listening to your pod cast with izzy but have to pause it and will continue it later when i have some more time to listen.
Wow G stop and take a breath.love your videos hope you knees soon feel better.xx😀
hi I know you have been doing all the exercise but are you walking... need to get those miles in
At 1:27 an orb shoots out the door on the left. thought i would point that out x

Love the podcasts
Yesss you’re  back woo hoo !!!
I love you
Oh Christ she’s not pregnant again Is she?? She’s finally off tv and then she gets sprogged up again
I can't wait for your book! <3\nIs there any way to follow your trip to Iman (outside the UK?)
I've got to say that I couldn't stop paying attention to Tom instead of you. Please don't be mad at me!
Not related to your vlog in anyway Gi but LOVE your tablecloth 😍

We all cry sometimes xxxx
Your makeup looks beautiful today ..
I've never seen before a beverage like this, I think is genial and amazing! Thanks for sharing Laura!
Can I substitute whole milk with almond milk?
Am I the only one who doesn't cook but yet I still love watching her 😩💗
I couldn’t find the recipe :(
@laurainthekitchen can this be served over ice?
How dare you, now everyone will know my favorite Starbucks drink! :P
Can you have this drink cold?
When i dealt with prisoners of war. We would give them starbucks just like you made. They would losen up and be more cooperative. They were star*ucked!!!
It don't look very nice or tasty
What kinda booze would taste the best with this if I wanted to serve it spiked??
Your life, you do you~ YAS!!
is there any thing then  Pumpkin you can use I have a  allergy to Pumpkin
They don't sell pumpkin purée in England tho 😭😭❤️
Dem eyez of laura’s are🤦🏿‍♂️❤️❤️
Laura looks so happy! Hahahaha 😍
Oh. Em. Gee.😍
Do you think this would work with regular chocolate chips?
I LOVE your make up in this Laura. You look gorgeous :) \n\nThis looks so delicious! I'm not too crazy about white chocolate but milk chocolate is kinda yucky with pumpkin :)
Made this today. Came out amazing! I skipped the extra sugar --- the white chocolate is sweet enough.
my 8 year old sister requests some pumpkin seed recipes thankss love from toronto
Sounds about white to me
I can no longer resist the pizza. I open the box and unzip my pants, allowing my pulsating member to eagerly burst free. As I penetrate the steaming, gooey cheese, a shuddering moan of ecstasy breaks through my drooling lips. The mushrooms and Italian sausage are delightfully rough, and the warm sauce feels like heaven. I blow my load in mere seconds, just in time to slip out the front door as you step out of the bathroom. You never discover why that pizza tasted so much better than all the others.
Ofcourse i will make this! Yummmmmy:) thank you Laura!!!
Every white girl's dream. You have done it again Laura.👌🏼🙌🏼
Sounds delicious.  I have pumpkin pie torani so I might use it.
Girl your makeup. Give us sources or techniques. So hot
Definitely looks yummy and just in time for the cool nights we’re starting to have,  a recipe that I’m going to try tfs and just a side note you look beautiful in this video love the makeup 😊💕
Hi i guys I am Laura Vitale andonthisepisodeoflaurainthekitchen LOVE IT!!!
Can you please do a regular easy homemade hot chocolate recipe?
If it's too sweet, add just a touch of sea salt to it.
White chocolate is a misnomer.  There is no chocolate in that white goop
Will try this to my girl's night get together next week 😋
thank you for giving us a real recipe. I've looked at several beverage recipe so far and they included ingredients like instant coffee and other processed ingredients. thank you for being real
People who make fun of people who like pumpkin anything this time of year are jerks stop shamming people for what they like
I've been ordering this at Starbucks for years!!!!! Yummmmm! Now I can make my own!
The Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system.God Calls us to be the Church. THE CHURCH SYSTEM IS THE STRONG DELUSION.  Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!! COME OUT OF CHURCH AND RELEGION AND INTO GOD'S LOVING ARMS!!
It’s hot out here too in California! Maybe pouring it over ice! Sounds delish to me!
Definitely need to make this because every time I order it at Tim Hortons they give me black coffee :/
Laura I have something you need to try. Egg nog hazelnut cappuccino. It's amazing. I was craving a cappuccino and noticed I didn't have milk. So I added some egg nog and it was amazing!! Someone probably already done it but I love it haha. Mm with whip cream on top and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
This looks great! Makeup is gorgeous
This looks incredible 😍 love love love your make up in this video too - wish you still filmed make up tutorials and make up videos xx
Thank you, thank you, thank YOU for this! I can't wait to try it!
Laura, on behalf of all ladies PLEASE resume your makeup/lifestyle channel again and show us how you created your eye look, it looks unreal!!! I know you are still a new mom and you have commitments but I would love you even more if you could show up occasionally for a good girls chat! Love you
That looks soooo delicious😋😋\nAnd your make up looks amazing 😍\nPlease show us this beautiful make up look in a tutorial 😍
@Laurainthekitchen where did you buy these mugs
I cant wait to try this with my fam
Laura , this looks wonderful and you look absolutely beautiful . My wife did the same after our first daughter and everyone thereafter .... we (my wife and I) wish you were our granddaughter
WOW i just made this.........it is SOOOO AWESOME!!!   the 2nd cup i have I'm going to add bit of nutmeg to the top    YUM YUM!!!!
Omg your so nice and sweet and your foods/drinks look AMAZING
I love pumpkin pie! However, most of the things to come from the pumpkin pie spice craze don't have any actual pumpkin. That kinda diminishes the experience for me. I'm so glad to see that yours has pumpkin in it! :)
Yeeeeesssssss! I've been dying for a PSL for years, but have been avoiding caffeine due to past and current pregnancy. Now this preggo can enjoy a holiday drink and make it whenever I want!
Just wandering...\nIF its hot outside AND we really need to try this, can't we refrigerate it for couple of hours and enjoy as a cold drink... 🤗
You just meshed my two favorite drinks together. God bless your soul!  I have to try this.
This looks so good! 😍 I live in Texas and it's still in the high 80's here - can't wait until it gets cold so I can make this for my family and I!
What type of alcohol would be good with it?
Looks lush burn in not too sure off the flavour with pumpkin as we don't use it for desserts in England
Thank you Laura! I need to try this ASAP!
Can someone bring me this Hot drink to my bed NOW!😂😂
I saw 1 of your videos and subscribed instantly + notifications
What is body language👍👍
This would be perfect for me right now because I have a sinus infection. This drink would definitely cure my sickness as well as my needs for sweet fall flavors 💜💜😂
I SAW U ON CHOPPED AND I WAS FREAKING OUTTT
Looks so good!! I can't wait to make this
Can't get any whiter than this
This looks so good
Could this be made with lower fat milk and still be good?
I’ll make it with one espresso shot 😍
I can’t wait to make this around Christmas time during the cold nights.
Yes!!! It's fall!!!!🍁🍂🍁🍂
I have got to make this for my autumn family gatherings🌿🍁😋Looks so good!
Laura, I'm jealous of Mia, she's going to have the best food growing up 😆
I have already made your pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. I plan on making the cream cheese pumpkin muffins. Now I'm gonna have to make this hot chocolate..  Once the weather cools. Too hot
Nice!
Make Nutella hot chocolate !!! Pleasee❤️💕❤️🤓😋

Brayan

Vorrei provare a fare questa ottima cioccolata calda, ma da noi manca pumpkin pie spice. Laura, qualche suggerimento, please?
For the past three videos shez wearing the same clothes
anyone else wanting to drink this off her breasts? or just me
Look at My Tay 😁 Love her!!!
She really just motivated me 🙌🏾
This interview was magnificent!!
Tamar I love your outfit! I can see you have matured a lot.
Lord bless you and your family Tamar B.
Who is Tamar’s stylist? Looking like we needs ya put her in an oven. 😂🤣😂
TayTay might be the only person on Earth that Wendell ain't shading 24/7!!!!😘😘
Ugly as fuk...both of these dykes
Why is Tamar not one of the judges on American Idol?She should be getting the 25 million dollars and not katie
Tamar gave the BEST interview so far this season and we're just getting started, Wendy!!! Thumbs up for Tamar getting her own show!!! 👍🏾
Tamar is a true Pisces!
She's a blessing. This interview made me really love her!
💖💖💖
Love you tay 😍😍😍😍
She is sooooo pretty
She seems like a lot of fun
The hell she got on tho?
The Real is so bad without her involved.
Tamar is so awesome! I'm loving her look and her nails are incredible!
I love Tamar! She's always kept it real, one hun! I'm so glad I watched her to derived my own opinions about her!
7:30 The nostalgia hit hard. I love the Muppets!
My god I just want to hang out with her!
Wendy looks good here hair and makeup
She's doing that lil kim proud by looking more modified every time she appears
Love her!! What a great personality and Skin ahaha <3 Love you tay tay
Social media is so messy!\n\nAlso, I didn't  understand Tamar's response when Wendy asked if what she had on her album cover was a body suit. Did Tamar say yes
I see a lot of growth and change in her and it's for the better. You can tell she's following god. I will say you can tell she had some work done.
She’s such a real person! Go Tamar!
I have to be honest. Tamar is ENTERTAINING. I was cracking up and rewind this like crazy hahaha
Tamar is the beautiful badd friend that everybody wants☺🇺🇸
she changed a lot I'm happy for her I can watch her in this space she was to over the top b4 but congrats Tamar.
Tamar is looking so gorgeous
Im really happy for her. It looks like shes matured a lot and took time to really focus on being a better person. Hope she continues to grow
 I have no issue with nobody but the devil lmao I looooove Tamar 😂😂😂
Tamar looks pretty. I definitely can't wait until Toni Braxton comes back on here💜
why did I think Wendy was going to go for her butt when she hugged. Tay lol!!
She's picked up some weight!! 😍😍
Tamar seems so sweet and humble. The boots are 🔥🔥🔥🔥.
And The Real has not been the same without Tamar!
Nice interview. But why she hug my sistuh like dat? 21:28 lol
It's not Tamar isn't a interesting person. It's just that for daytime t.v. as a host (like when was The Real Daytime) I can see way her personality wouldn't work nor did it last long. Tamar can sing her was off but I think she needs to stay doing reality TV and or become a judge on something or even a host for like Love & Hip Hop kind of shows. Basically anything late night tv would be nice
Beautifull  I love  her  new take on life  always a fan
Shi walk in lik MI's nene
A*2*the*MEN! HUNNY!!!! TELL IT TAMAR! I completely understand
She so funny im so confused as to why she wld say this is her last album she been tryna do music for so long.. now this the last album? Hmm
she's thick!  what happen?
I really really likeTamar. She has this bratty but very down to Earth factor.
That’s one thing I wished interviewers would ask these artist! Tell us about the cover art work! Obviously, it has to mean something to them in order for them to have selected it. Unless, it was done by the record label it helps make sense of their music and album as a whole.
In love with the outfit
This is coming from a woman who thought nothing of Tamar!  But great job!  And I wish you well on your growth journey!
Tamar is so misunderstood.  I appreciated her honesty.  God Bless Ms. Tamar!
Flipping love Tamar
Hey  mate ! surface I guess  really  badass$ work#morning  ..
I’m here for the entire outfit! 🔥
The way she said birdman....😂😂😂😂
Is that the hypothermia blanket hooker look?
Tamar's blend game is on point! Love this makeup artist!
lmao i love her extraness.
I just believe Vince never wanted Tamar to have professional independence in the industry.  I hope her decision to not make another album is her own decision and not an attempt to please her husband.  Tamar you are still doing a lot with your career so leave The Real situation behind you.  Don't allow that situation to control your mind and destroy relationships with others around you.
That dress and boots!!! Love!!!!!!
Realizing How much I missed this girl remember He tried it, Get ya, your life Yess T do your thing ❤
Tamar is my spirit animal when she start going down that list of people she unfollowed 😂😂😂
I love love Tamar! !!!! I want your shows back Tamar!
I love her outfit!
One of my faves, gotta love Tamar!!
My breasts are still mine...😩... oh the shade... but unknowingly
I wish it was longer she's very entertaining!
I love Tamar's boots...Girl where did you get it?
Damn I wish I had a friend like Tamar!
I love me some Tamar.
She so extra but I love her spirit!
You can't help but love Tamar man she is such a ball of energy!!
This is as good as an interview gets. Funny and not afraid to talk. Conversations > interviews
Christ on a bike, way toooo much plastic and Botox on show for my liking!
,,I unfollowed about 30 people\n(...) and Vince had a taping spirit... (...) (she meant to say that her husband that has no insta etc. accidantly liked a shady post from brandy about monica) come on Tamar!!! Who do you think you fooling girl?!!😑🐸☕
I love me some Tamar 😂
love tamar but she needs to listen to people who are telling her to leave her face alone
I don't care what anyone have to say. I love Tamar.
She should go on The Real
WENDY YOU SO Dumb right now your playing your self your not only trying to play your Cohosts but your fans that actually support You! Nobody is that stupid. You got a big mouth only when it's beneficial to you. Your a fraud and your slowly being exposed!!
Tamar looks great! I can't believe she is 40 years old. She looks late 20s early 30s.
Wendy if somebody is willing to give the tea shush lol
Why dont she just change management keep businesses businesses and family family and  like TayTay came so far  with her career We love your Voice. You are a great singer. I know shes not quit  music but damn i want a nother abulm like Calling all lover the New one its alright but hey  I  love her though.
Love this!!!!
I love Tamar!!!
Yessss Tamar! Nobody but the devil 😒
I Love me some Tamar Braxton Herbert!!!!
I think they in lovet LMFAOOO

https://youtu.be/AapWWmI8dSo
Tamar is funny af!!!😂😂😂
Two fake bitches
Not their real hairs not their real noses! LOL
SHE IS SO FUNNY
I love Mitch's Freddie Mercury look!!
Mitch watching True Blood is all I need.
can you guys totally do a polar express medley video for the holiday season or do a cover of When Christmas Comes to Town from the polar express with PTX because id love it so much
I’m obsessed with future friends
I GOT THE ALBUM LAST WEEK AND EVERY SONG IS FIRE!
omg I've just started watching true blood a fare days ago and I'm freaking obsessed with it!
When's the Melodrama medley coming out?
If you want a good show with hot boys in leather BBC The Musketeers.
i was hoping for Deny U music video this friday
Mitch. Bring the septum piercing back and throw the porn stach out! 😂
Mitch looks different everytime I see him 😂😍
4:18-4:33 what every scomiche shipper thinks. She knows what's good!!
Mitch what the fuck is up w ur hair and facial hair.
at first I didn't like Mitch's mustache, but then I started watching Parks and Rec
She is HILARIOUS in The Good Place.
I love the most is they always put their weekly obsession and also their week songs they love ! I mean I wish all YouTubers would do that !
I just watched their first videos and I'm literally crying I'm so proud of y'all ❤️
It feels like forever since the last time you’s sat in front of the camera 😂❤️
when Hoying said One Piece i literally thought he meant the anime
I laughed so hard through all of this
Aaaaaa congrats guys! You guys are killing it, keep up the amazing work!
Why do they both look so sexy rn
Every time I come back to this channel, Matts image is always different
THE 'STACHE IS TOTALLY WORKING
I'm such a fucking weeb, when Scott said one piece I immediately thought Mitch was gonna reply with a one piece character goodness me
If y'all don't make a Guy.exe video that's basically a Weird Science parody, it's going to be a real missed opportunity.
Post Malone wrote I Fall Apart because Mitch forgot about him.
Is it just me or is Mitch copying Scotts facial hair? Either way, keep it up Queens! ❤️👑👑❤️
How ironic is this, I missed a superfruit notification, because I was doing a superfruit binge 😭😂😂😂❤️❤️
The album is amazing! Congratulations ❤️
i was hoping the names would be like \n“my name is horse”\n“my name is cowboy and i’m gonna ride you”
You're trending on YT and Im a proud momma!
i wanna see them kiss too 😏
God she is funny
From creepy bald to creepy mustache and hair.
Holy shit I missed that intro so bad, I started crying.
All of the shirts that Mitch wears, I want
SCOTT DID THE FALLING ASLEEP THING AGAIN AHHHHHAHAHAHAHA
I can't stop listening to your album. I love it so much
i love these music videos SO much, but I'm excited for sit down videos like this again, you guys are killing it with balancing them though and its insane how far this channel has come in such a short time:)
Only 90’s kids will remember the time when this was called ‘HURRY UP BLOOPERS?’
When Scott said One Piece I was secretly hoping that Mitch would say Cowboy Bebop because of his shirt 😅
i love mitch's hair like this
They’ve been\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating?\no-o \nO-o\nO-O
4:18 wouldn't we all
Lmao I've been born and raised here in Hawaii so when Scott pronounced poke bowls the first time I cringed SO MUCH lol but I'm just happy that he is eating Hawaiian foooodd
It really showed you both would be awesome if you had an indie film. Road trip film for the summer maybe? Everything you do is GOLD... at least... & Platinum.
Who else thought of the kpop groups when they said one piece and two piece
I was waiting for Mitch to say and my name is Two Piece and A Biscuit.
Lol she said my name. 😂
THE GOOD PLACE  THATS WHERE I KNEW HER FROM
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
i'll never be over you two. y'all are so incredible :)
Now do you have a BEARD Mitch?!! Oh and BTW there's this app called Flipagram and I believe you shall get a account of flipagram!
What are you gonna do with all this ass😂😂
LORD ITS TRENDING IN THE NETHERLANDS OML I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE SO MUCH PENTAHOLICS AND KIDS HERE LORD OF THE HOLY UNICORNS!
1:33 put that audio inside a stuffed bear because that's the cutest two seconds I've ever heard in my life

Please let the music video be for Guy.exe! My fav song!💗
Are they still in pentatonix
Cum guzzling tramps
you gay weirdos...
These guys are faggots
Hey dudes! You guys are fags!
Lilly is SUCH a great human and we had so much fun filming together! Who do you want me to challenge next? :)
Not gonna lie... I let a lil squeal out when I saw Lilly 😍. Awesome Molly, so happy you got to collab w Lilly. She is such an amazing human being!
Hahaha it was only Safiya Nygard that I guessed right, but only because the clip was her intro and I've heard that numerous times! Also, Lilly, I see dat #GirlLove Rafiki 2.0 👀
Where my Team Super Unicorns at???
I think Lilly should write a book called How to be a Bawse\n😂
I knew most of these 🙈 I'm addicted to YouTube
How did she not get Yousef in like a second 😂
Omg you two !!!!I am subscribed to both of you and i was so surpised that you've done a collab!!!
Been subbed for months. So I win! I was here befoooore.
Awesome. I'd crash and burn in that challenge since I hardly know anyone on YouTube.\nJust watched the Lying about being sighted video from 8 months ago. You brought up points that really hit home. Although I can talk about my cPTSD, and even write a little from time to time, really coming to terms with having a worsening invisible and chronic illness comes with backward steps as well as forward. For what it's worth, it looks like there are more blind girl jokes than there are cPTSD jokes, but I'm adding to the list whenever I can. Now, I'm just working toward a fuzzy service beast, so at least membership in the chronic illness/disability club has perks.
honestly why don't you have more subscribers???
I got Liza and David so quickly😂😂 This was so good and fun to watch
1:38 😂 I thought it was Liza wth
Here before her channel blows up ❤️
I HEARD THE DINKS AND INSTANTLY KNEW IT WAS JENNA AND JULIEN DINK FAM WHERE YOU AT
I GUESSED GRACE HELBIG INSTANTLY IM SO PROUD OF MYSELF
this is the best collar ever !!! i recently started my own youtube channel and I'm so happy about it :)X
Oh my God I wasn't expecting this!!! Team super where you at???
Thanks for not putting the name of the YouTuber on the screen so we can play along. I think it was very first challenge Molly did (maybe someone else did), I saw the name of the YouTuber before I could guess.\nI did put the screen curtain on for this video before I figured out I didn’t need to.\nI got a 0% for the record. 😁
DESI DESI DESI!!!!
OMG OMG OMG SUPERWOMAAAAN!!!!!!\nILY BOTH SO MUCH!!!!!!!!\nI'M SOOO HAPPYYYYY!!!!!
how the fuck is this video trending with 28k views?
Molly you're so gorgeous! If you ever do a Q&A soon I was just wondering. Do you remember how you look? If not you're so gorgeous and your eye shadow is never flawed 😍
I kind of want to see her do this with Rebecca Felgate
i knew it was Alissa violet
Every time I here my mom watching a YouTube video I can automatically say who it is😂😂 it's bad
Even tho i realize there's potential issues with this idea.. but is there any way you could like... edit the audio clips ur listening to (of the voices) into the video?  Was hard to hear and i couldnt even really come close to having a guess. So was hard for me to play along.  That or i'm just really bad at this game.  lol.   I do realize you would either have to mute the audio of your recorded video, and replace w/the clips ur listening to, but then if you had commentary during the clip (which happens a lot) that would be muted.  Then u'd have to go about recording each audio source individually and that just becomes a hassle.  :-\
https://youtu.be/hoZ4P5TC0w8\n\n\nPlease put like on my video ))
I only got Ryan Higa, but I even knew it was from a video I watched recently (Dumbest Things I've Ever Done!)
I was sad they didn’t do Shane Dawson😢
OMG I couldn't be happier about this collaboration! You are both two of my favourite YouTubers and it was so great to see you together!!! Great video guys 😊❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Molly, as someone who just hears sound, does it drive you nuts when people, girls mostly, turn every sentence into a question? I drives me batty and I would think a blind person would just want to slap the inflection right off of them. 😊
I only got Grace, immediately!! 😂😂
I got:\nGrace Helbig\nMarkiplier\nPhilip DeFranco\nMr. Kate\nRyanHiga
I got all of them right.. I should play this challenge lol 😂 I live in YouTube
Loved the video and collab!!!
There are certain things about me I spoken of in the past to no validity....I'm reclusing to some of my other dormant traits....play time is over.
lilly's love for ryan higa will never die
I got None of these. LOL but it looks like you guys had so much fun. Awesome video.
HOW COULD THEY GOT NOT GET MY SOME OF MY FAVES ELIJAH AND CHRISTINE ! Just kidding, love you both, this video is so great😂❤️
This is my first of these segments and I loved it! Stay beautiful ladies. You area appreciated and loved.
Ahh one of the best collabs ever.. You two are AWESOME!
This is proof of how the youtube algorithm is rigged.. You have gotten 11k views in 11 hours, which doesn't even come close to what is actually trending (views). All you have to do is put a big youtuber that is in kudos with the platform itself.....
Molly won, but very close! 9 to 7!
This was so cute aw haha Lilly scaring Molly's dog, not surprising
I got the Jenna & Julien Podcast one from the dinks... WHERE MY DINK FAM AT?!?!?!?!?!?!

Molly you are stunning! 😀 great video
my two favourite people in one video!! this is unreal.
Omg this is amazing!!!!!! LILLY AND MOLLY WTF  SO AMAZING
When you get real excited for J+J and then realized you recognized it from the Dink Dink, Jenna's whine, and Julien's voice in that order. Also H3H3????

Ive never been this excited for a collab before omg LILLY SINGH IZ KWEEN
Just found my new favorite YouTuber💗
Howdy
Should have tried guessing D-trix ;)
Wasn’t this the exactly the same kind of challenge you had with Casey Neistat ? :) i like it. It’s a good challenge must try it myself with some friend !
But where are Dan and Phil
Nope. First video of the entire channel that I cannot watch until the end. What a bad-mannered, loud-mouthed, fake person that acts like she's been brought up in the gutter. Unbearable.
Bb's😭😭😭loved the video!!
I've been subscribed to both of you for so long, this is perfect
I would so fail this as the only big youtuber that is Mamrie Hart and Lilly Singh. Otherwise, my faves are only fellow small youtubers <3 That said, awesome collab :)
It was a little out for me, a guy from Kazakhstan. But nevertheless it was entertaining and funny. I know only few American youtubers, Casey, Roman, Philip, Green brothers, Higa, and a Russian hacker Taras ))))
She looks likes she’s not blind
How is this trending with only 18k views.Youtube WTF?
Lilly got ryan before fousey lol
Oh Jesus, so if I was born a decade earlier & had an ulcer before 2005, I could have needed a surgery. Holy cow..
It will be interested that you explains why h. Pylori can develop in the stomach. Part of that could be stress with lack of production hcl. Without enough hcl , h pylori can develop itself. There is a link beetween this bacteria, stress and immune system! ;)
Herbs are for the healing of the nation. Replace inorganic chemicals with natural herbs then maybe you'll live a few years longer. Herbs cure diseases and Rx Meds reduced your discomfort. It doesn't get rid of it. It's their way to make sure you keep coming back.  I get it though, everyone just wants to make money. Try a Bromide, it's good for your digestive system.  I make it myself. And happy to report that I haven't had any stomach discomfort for quite sometime. I was born with a sensitive digestive system. Everything and Anything would cause discomfort. If you want more info, hit me up.
Definitely gonna show my mom she has no idea why she has ulsers and now she will know!! Yay!! 🙂+😟

Been watching this for 3 minutes. Can't watch anymore what causes it?
I actually had one and at  the time it open, which caused internal bleeding which lead to six months of isolation mixed with pancreatitis caused my transplanted kidney to fail after five years. ESRD came back and here I am 8 years still on dialysis waiting for transplant. :(
I have a question for future videos: How smart are dolphins?

i had ulcer ever since i was 9 now im 11
Titanium dioxide is put in many foods and it will end up in your stomach, these nano particles will act as Trojan Horse that will let bacteria penetrate your stomach lining with ease. I remember using chewing gum after every meal and always having very painful stomach problems, now I know that all chewing gums are full of Titanium nano particles.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
nice  and Informative video :-)
That don't sound right I ate a lot of spicy food and greasy foods and I developed ulcers because of that, the doctor confirmed it.
Believe me stomach diseases are more dangerous than some life threatening diseases. I have been suffering from IBS-C for last 10 years and at every point of my life it reminds me that I am badly sick. Stress is definitely one of the causes of developing these problems and the issue is that when you have IBS it brings stress with it even if you're doing well in your life it keeps you stressed hence it aggravates the symptoms and this cycle continues. IBS causes stress and stress causes IBS. The worse thing is that there is no cure for IBS in the medical world in 21st century.
You know you have balls of steel when you experiment on yourself. Wowza!
i got rid of my h pylori after 4 years
loved those awkwardly silent solid couple seconds of nothing but fish floating in acid
That abdominal pain is no joke my peeps, if youre suffering from Ulcers I highly recommend you seek help and get treated for it.
This video shows why we should not disregard those scientists who express doubt about Global Warming.  In this medical instance, two lone doctors turned out to be correct when the vast majority of their peers felt confident that those two doctors were clearly wrong to doubt the majority opinion on ulcers.  A new, correct, correct idea is usually discovered by just one or two maverick researchers, and it can take years before the majority of scientists come to accept that new idea.
We all know that ulcers are caused by pregnant ex girlfriends.
healthy Breakfast a day, keeps the ulcers in jail.
Moral lesson: We should legalize human experiments so that the valuable people won't have to suffer.

Apple vinegar can kill this bacteria in 40 days if you add 2 spoons in a glass with hot watter and drink it on empty stomach! Many people didnt get cured even with antibiotic it is havy to cure... http://www.grocare.com/blog/tag/h-pylori-natural-treatment-apple-cider-vinegar/
Medicine kills and no such thing as infectious disease. Antoine Bechamps terrain theory not pasteurization.
Did anyone Noticed in the Animation Barry and his associate was doing Bhangra after recieving Nobel Prize.
Atatürk?
1:36 told yaa, bitches!
The AMA is making too much money with the other theories to let on to their patients.
It is really good.
Maybe someone's question is still unanswered. Who knows. But it was helpful to me. Thanks for the video. Will talk to my daughter's GI doctor. At 14 she has been suffering fom acid for several years. Sometimes families need to help the doctor find the answer.
4:20 the DNA chirality is incorrect. It should be right handed, not left.
Wow I’m over here with stomach pain because of my stomach ulcers  and this video pops up on my feed 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Someone might gag at this video.
can probiotics kill that bacteria? i heard that it can
thanks for making great videos, i learned alot here. nicely done
I get stomach ulcers when I hear progressives spew words out of their mouths.
I wonder  what food or vitamins would you take to increase  your mucosal defense?
Don't be afraid to prove some one, something or some belife wrong.
That stomach is a UCKERS
This video is amazing! Thanks and keep bringing content as great as it.
I remember back in February I vomited like 9 times in the matter of 8 hours
I bet you could cure it with drinking bleach.
As an helycobacter pylori user i must say yeah everything is correct
i have never had this.
There are plenty of herbs much better then the antibiotic the medicine has to offer.
Being stabbed in the gut is also caused by bacteria, and made worse by stress.\nThis explains why Jamaican food tastes like dirt.
The link between stress and stomach ulcer/acid reflux could be because of reduced Melatonin. There are a number of recent studies showing lowered Melatonin in patients with stomach ulcer and acid reflux. Melatonin has regenerative and protective qualities in Gastrointestinal mucosa in addition to regulating sleep patterns. That could also explain lack of sleep accompanied by these symptoms when stress levels are high. A clear mind allows the body to heal.
Scientists that knowingly put themselves in danger to find answers are quite  some heroes.\nBut I ask myself: Is it ethical?\nWe already know it is unethical to put others in danger (even with their consent) for science.\nBut isn't it as unethical to put oneself in danger for science?\nIs it even legal?\n\nAlso. Is this something a scientist can do to circumvent the unethical act of using test subjects in dangerous experiments?
Whether H. pylori is detrimental to health in long term is still not clear. There is a theory that there is a **dynamic equilibrium** acting on our body in which different forces counteract with other. Since H. pylori have existed for such long time in humans stomach, and antibiotics is a recent approach to act against it, we should be able to eliminate them far earlier or suffer from it for a long time, which neither was the case. Given the apparent negative impact of antibiotics, it is highly doubted whether we should use them to eliminate this bacteria...
I see lord of the rings reference, I like.
Could've seen this before my test.

Nice funny animation :)
So, only anti-bacterial tablet could cure ulcer?
The real MVP
he trsusted his guts . pun intended
For science!
Doesn't H pylori cause inflammation by increasing acid levels in the stomach?
Unfortunately many people STILL believe today, in 2017, that stress is the CAUSE (keyword here) of ulcers. You can even read through the comments here and see the people who still fervently defend this notion.\n\nJust a reminder that even if all of the evidence says no, the hubris of people will deny it to satisfy their own ego or desire to be right. This includes scientists.
What does smoking not cause?
You guys are so cool, I really enjoy these lessons !! Keep going! :)
I cant watch this video when the narrator whistles his esses so loud, its a shame unsubscribed
I thought the first thing to do was to use antibiotics.
Big Brother is watching you!
After my gall bladder removal the Docs pushed the NSAIDS (oral and iv) even after they were told I had issues with them in the past. Eight months later I am still suffering from gastritis, a culture of my inflamed stomach lining revealed NO pylori. NSAIDS interfere with the production of mucous in the stomach and have caused many catactrophic bleeding events. NSAIDS are more dangerous then they are letting on and stronger warnings should be in place.
So every morning I get a upset stomach and ending up puking up bile or the food I ate before. Could I have a alcer?
Lovely animation
I’ll spicy your food...

Jamie! When you use baby facial for the first few times mix 2 pumps of the facial with 2 pumps of the oil. It adds extra hydration to the peel and makes it more balancing and your skin will be super soft. It also makes it a little more comfortable too. I'm obsessed with it and actually use it 2x a week religiously, but I had to work up to that. \nAlso, you just don't want to use anything with AHA/BHA/retinol/enzymes immediately after washing Baby Facial off. But surrounding days you def can. DE also recommends using the Marula oil after rinsing baby facial. \nI would do baby facial on Sunday, TLC 1-2x a week and maybe rotate in moonfruit 1-3x a week. I'm a Skin Lead at Sephora and highly recommend all the things you bought 😊
I think am cheap but I think that $6 for 1 mask is not  affordable
For UK people who can’t get sephora - the body shop do an amazing dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial! the vitamin C glow revealing liquid peel 🤓 you use it in the same way and it makes all your dead skin cells ball up and come off when you rinse it. it’s only £18 too, i swear by it 🙊

Top video 😁😁
Your face looks so amazing.... 😍😍😍
Great video💖💖💖🔝
Can you do a tutorial on this makeup look? Please!!!
Can you do an updated skin care routine video please?
Does any fellow UK pals know where I can get the Drunk Elephant TLC BabyFacial??? I’ve looked EVERYWHERE
about time you started a petition for sephora in glasgow you are the voice of the scottish people, pls and thanks x
OMG I never realise that there was no Sephora in the UK! 😱
I NEED A TRIP TO SEPHORA! LIKE NOW! Who wants a trip to the USA? I need an enabler 😂😂😂😏
Hey Miss JJ, what foundation are u wearing, looks amazing !
Make up tutorial on this please Jamie, I love the olive green! Xx
Jamie, I just love you! You have quickly become my favorite YouTuber. You are so real and down to earth. I love that you also represent the tattooed and pierced girls out there. You are beautiful! 😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
Please do a makeup tutorial on this makeup, thanks
Im sorry but you look like the hotter Scottish version of Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner in some of your thumbnails
I arrived back from New York this morning for the for the first time in america! I spent $800 in Sephora 🙈😂 I was like a kid at Christmas 😂😂 I’m now bankrupt!! X
How many did u roughly spend all together
For those of you who are old enough to remember, there used to be a Sephora on Oxford Street, London years ago but closed down. There are talks one will be opening in Westfield East London soon, shame it won't be in Central London like Covent Garden which is like Beauty Central. Whoop x
We need a tutorial on this eye look please Jamie, you look bloody gorgeous girl 😘
Are you going to review the new kat von d palette???
Please do a first impressions/testing of that foot mask!!!
Hi Jamie, what product do you use to bring out your freckle? Thank you! You’re ace. 😘
It was not cheap but it was the last one, which make me think it was super necessary 😂😂😂 Thats so me.
Totally agree bring Sephora to the UK
You're camera quality is off the chain. Great vid, J. Thank you.
Tutorial on this look please, omg its amazing
Girl when I was in New York I was spending thousands! I git to VIB Rouge status in a week 🙈😂
Hey guys! Hope you're having a great day. I make videos about food and it would mean the world to me if you gave my channel a looking, lemme know what you think. Much love!
WE NEED SEPHORA IN THE UK😭😭
Jamie you can use the drunk elephant baby facial and the tlc framboos at the same time just not on the same day so use the baby facial on Monday and then the rest of the week use the tlc framboos (I work at Sephora)
Please do a tutorial on applying lashes 💖💖💖
That Baby Soft Foot Mask is CRA CRAAAAA! Your skin peels off!!
hey any smaller youtubers want to support each other? xo
You and kaushal are my favourite youtubers I think you should do videos together
Do a tutorial on this look!! I love it!
It's almost become a daily routine to sit and watch your videos whilst doing my makeup ❤️
Ugh so jealous of this haul 😭 if you just use the Sukari Facial every 1.5-2 weeks, you can still use the DE night serum or other AHA products in conjunction with it! You just need to make sure you stay away from actives 3-4 days before you use the Babyfacial. Just listen to your skin, if you are over exfoliating it will let you know!!
Ugh I want to try all this stuff! I need more money 😩
wish i could buy all this ughh hahaha
Omg Jamie, please do a tutorial/review on the rubber mask!!❤️
And you're still not hot 💀💀\n\n\n\n\n\nLMAO issa joke
Girl ya just HAD to go and post a huge haul on payday! Desperately praying for my bank balance 🙃
Liked before i even watched just because of the oops in the thumbnail 😂😂
I love that your hauls consist of so much skin care ❤️
It’s the farmacy products that came with the little spoon!
Yay yay yay! So happy a bigger YouTuber talked about Farmacy! I absolutely love that brand especially sleep tight and the honey potion moisturizer
please do a makeup collection x
Hey Jamie! Are you going to be dropping your teeth transformation video? Lots of love xM
Can you do a night time routine :)
hi Jamie!! I've seen you own the simple Human mirror...Do you like it for everyday make up?? I need one  and I would love to know your opinion!!\nthanks love, kisses from Spain
I think you can use the glycolic acid and the facial at the same time-- just not the same day. So, once your skin is used to it, I think you could use a schedule like this: TLC S-T-Th, facial F, rest Sat. (Although since they're both heavy AHA's that might be a lot of the same acid to put on your face... but you *could* is what I'm saying.) I do a similar schedule with lactic acid and a mandelic peel respectively, and my very chronically sensitive skin loves it.
Love you Jaime !!! Love that eye look, it's so beautiful!
Drunk elephant is such an amazing brand! For video ideas I still love the full face looks that you do, especailly when they're extra long. I'd love to see a classic bronze smokey eye from you. Those are my favourites to watch because everyone looks good in them
Please film the foot mask thing!
A fat stack of face masks 😂😂😂
I love getting your opinion on beauty products! Loved it xx
Her my face on her thumbnail made me click on it 😂😂😂like 😰
Jamie can you PLEASE do a review on the new Huda Beauty eyeshadow palette? I have seen so much controversy over it and I really trust and respect your opinions and honesty when reviewing products. Thanks love you xx
Your face in the thumbnail #canrelate 👌🏽
I remember when I was a kid and we had Sephora in the Uk- In London in Angel and Brent Cross. I guess they weren’t so successful at the time, but it was before blogging and YouTube ect really took off
Hey Jamie, would you be so kind as to do a basic gentle skin care routine from start to finish for newbies in this beauty world? :)
I love the Drunk Elephant Glycolic Serum, my skin has been so much better since I used it.
please do a vid about round eyes and a green eye makeup look. Also my eyeliner used to be perfect and its no longer awesome so a an eyeliner look where you really delve into semi-hooded eyes would be helpful. also please do a video on night skin care! love you Jamie! your the shit! I gather so much inspiration
I thought that said “Noon Fruit” hahahahaha
What eyelashes are you wearing in this vid? 😍😍
Wow your videos are blowwwing up lol I love it! I like the haul vids, for sure! Keep doing them! Could you do an updated brow routine (+ any tips with eyebrows that don't grow symmetrically, or up in the center? Weird but I can't figure it out and I just want your brows :( \n\nWould also love to see a NAF trip vlog! Always dope. \n\n+ your routine touch ups at your favorite place :)))) 👄
Please do a makeup tutorial on your Vegas make up look and your dark eye when you were on the plane the 2nd time!!
A good dupe for the drunk elephant baby facial is the body shop drops of youth liquid peel. Does exactly the same thing but is only £18. So gross but so satisfying at the same time !
am I the only one who got ASMR from 15:43
Please do a tutorial on this eye look!
I wish you could come to New Mexico and do my makeup for my husbands return from deployment! You are so incredibly stunning & talented!
Could we have a tutorial on your eye look?? I love the green and wud love to know WHICH shadows you used 😃❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I wish drunk elephant was just a smidge cheaper. I've heard such great things about their products!!
#bringsephoratoscotland I'm from Scotland I know how it feels ! 😂
You said it rite the first time is said bosha and the feet mask is amaze balls it works very very well!
I live in the Netherlands and there's also no Sephora here! Seriously, Sephora step up your game and come to more European countries!!
I really like hauls like this so I'd love to see more! I also feel like it's time for another skincare routine 🙌🏼 xx

Well all I'm gonna say is this isn't really that cute at all. Any child of this age that I know who's found out the sex of their baby siblings never cried over wanting a sibling of the same gender. I never did either. Looks to me this girl seems quite spoilt. Of course she's just a kid at the end of the day though, and I'm pretty certain she'll love her little brother once he arrives.
Waaaay tooo many disgusting people here in the coments. You should feel ashamed!
lol stupid children
I thought this was very cute until I realized that his is her typical behavior she has adapted to, in order to earn blue sweeties. =(
Fuck, people dumb enough to still film vertically squeezing more out.
No offense but she is rude I love my baby sister to bits yes I was expecting a brother but so what about gender she is cute no matter what that girl is spoilt mum needs tell her that her brother will be sad if she dont love him! Rude child. Idc if shes 3 she should know
So sweet! saw her on the Wendy Williams Show!Adorableness
so funny when grownup neo-feminists act like exactly the same way sometimes
I agree with this little girl 100%.   It is a completely valid opinion.
my little too when she he a him.
Fake tears, the parents have taught her to be this way through poor reinforcement. She cries, then gets rewarded with candy. Unsurprisingly, her tears end immediately.
He\n He\n  He\nShe's funny.
Siobhan, turn off the comments. They're saying awful things about your children. Just turn them off!
Start saving and you can pay for his surgery, little girl.
This wouldn't happen in China. It would be more like Good news! We're having a boy so we don't have to infanticide your new sibling like we almost did with you.
you know what this video really means. the boys are her school are not very nice to her
That boy is going to be tortured for at least the first 10 years of his life.
I had a british older sister, she was mean and didn't want me either lmao
It boggles my mind why parents like this are so eager to share their shitty parenting with the rest of the world.
I wouldn't leave her alone in the room with the new baby, just sayin
Hi Siobhan I work for @DailyBlasLive! We would love to use this adorable video please email me at alexie.pincus@dailyblastlive.com
I know this is British, but can any of you Brits tell me what area this accent is attributed to?
Hopefully her brother realizes he is a she and gets HRT therapy before she can walk.
Good luck with all that, little guy.
Guuuuul
What a cutie :)
that is one ugly kid
Sexist toddler! haha xD
Circi Lannister's first home movie
feminism in a nutshell
Damn feminist brat
Bitch
Rescue a dog.  Problem solved.
new phone who dis?
Poor baby hahaha.
Giiiiiiiirrrrrrrrllll
Thanks for reminding me why I don't have kids.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
She needs to step away from the Pop Tarts from time to time, methinks.
Lesbian feminist in the making.
Feminism already corrupting the youth smh tbh fam
Tell her the baby boy is trans and can dress her up like a girl.
Your kid is dumb
Brat
My parents did the same thing when my sister was going to be born. I still wish she was a boy...
I came for the comments and I am not disappointed.
get rid of the little cunt, i mean the alive one BTW
making the sex of an unborn crucial\nvertical video\nboy's and girl's color\nbribing with sweets
just cut off his penis
*Did you just assume that baby's gender what the fuck you are literally hitler I am calling CPS right now prepare to have your life ruined and your family torn apart!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
I'd grab that little fucker and shake her violently. Then sell her to my friend Jeremy Epstein. John Posestda will pay top dollar too
Cheer up, little one! These days, newborns get to choose their gender! So, they just might end up being a girl after all!\nHopefully your tax funded public school administration will get the gender situation sorted out early on by Pre-K! Good luck!
What a brat. You can tell the kid uses crying to get what she wants. And these parents videotape as if it's amusing. Just wait 10 years.
Beggars can’t be choosers
www.reddit.com sent me here and oh my god im glad i dont have a fuckin annoying girl like that as my kid the parents are obviously pussy liberals for letting this happen my sister would have never acted like that because my parents believed in spanking not being a pussy parent who gives trophys for everything
dumb cunt dont sideways film u dumb whore and beat ur ugly ass kid. dont ever let them talk back like its nothing dumb whore
fucking annoying little kid
THAT LITTLE GIRL IS JUST LIKE THE REDDIT COMMUNITY, CRYING OVER SOME STUPID SHIT, AND UPSET THAT THEY CANT GET THEIR WAY. POOR BABIES
If you think she's being mean, let me tell you that I stepped on my brother's throat after he was born because I wanted to be an only child. (He's fine, i didn't press my foot too hard. My parents saw and stopped me). I also tried to strangle him on several occasions and there's even a picture of it
You gotta show this on her wedding day..
I really felt her pain; that was so sad :(  Saddest thing ever.  never watching this type of stuff again its horrible.

God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno

can all of the online doctors shut the fuck up ? it's their child they know what to do. they wouldn't do anything to hurt their baby.
Augh!  Soooooo CUTE!
i wish itsjudyslife would do calenders :(
I think Alessia is so much like Edwardo 💜💜
Getting so excited to start my own family one day!\n\nLove from the Netherlands🇱🇺
You manifested your childhood dreams and thoughts...awesome
UGLY BABY WITH UGLY BIRTHMARK IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIEN.
Best way to get downstairs EVER! The Daddy Express!!!
Alessia's so cute! When she was eating, she was playing the piano with her right hand. So sweet.
How Eduardo says buckle omg😍😍 I can't believe how much he's talking now 😃😃
How happy Eduardo was to wake up, i want what he his having.
Amazing guys! I cant believe she is 6 months already!!!! Ive always wanted to buy a calendar but my mum would think its weird i have a family calendar in my room im only 18 😂💗
Jofee? Stop using that song it makes me cry every friggin time
The ending made me cry 💕 so beautiful
I have no idea who u lot are
I bought a calendar ! Eeeeeekkkk soooooooooooooooooooooo excited love your videos soooooooooooooooooooooo much
What happend to you saying welcome to the best year of the whatever month of the whatever of your life
JONATHAN!  I hope you see this before I go and buy another calendar that I can't write on.  Is this years one different paper than last year?  Can we write on this one with any pen or is it the same one from last year that I can't write on without using a permanent marker?!  Is 2018 pen friendly??
Dear stupid kids \nstop with the same shit like oh i wont not buy a random family calender is just so anoying ok im chill with it but they act like victims and say no body is saying nothing 😳 im chill still but THEY GOT ME THERE LIKE THEY KEEP SAYING SHIT that is out of the conversation like if they wanna fight and do drama do it in another place were no body wants them
Baby looks so uncomfortable and shaken.... I feel so bad for her.  Isn't she too small to be eating food like that?  I haven't even seen her grab toys first.  I feel like she was 2 months yesterday and still looks the same.  How has this much time passed?   It doesn't seem like it.  She is soooo petite tiny!!
all they worry is there nasty asses and money there vlogs are so shitty I would not by shit from them low lifes
Very nice pictures... ; D
Aww now I have tears because of that lovely montage! An emotional video for you and me, Jonathan!
It was even cooler if u guys did a theme for the calendar for next year
Hi Anna, what is that book you are using?? I am just curious as my 19 week old has just started weaning (been told she is fine to by her health visitor) and has just started on porridge at breakfast time. As i am a first time mum i don't really know much about weaning or where to start and how to keep introducing new foods any tips would be very appreciated. :) Hope you are well. Love to you all <3<3<3<3<3
I wouldn’t listen to bestie in front of the kids the word are quite yano😂x
Kids do grow up so fast! My son just turned one. Looking through his pictures makes me emotional and happy at the same time.
What is alessia thinking when she's humming and waving in the high chair? Because she's not crying but she's not smiling. Not judging or anything I'm just genuinely interested to know if there are any baby experts!
omg!! i want the calendar😍😍
I have the 2016&2017 calendars but I don’t use calendars any more :(
@20:46 she looks like your dad Anna.........
does anyone know the song that starts at 0:43 ?
Hey, what is the song that was in the video?
Ordered the calendar yesterday.  My third one!    💗
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  a pearl necklace 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he gave Anna a hug and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAlessia is getting big now Aww that was so cute seeing alessia trying food for the first time x
I live in China and how to get the calendar?
Sometimes when they first go in a high chair they lean from side to side ..Take a pillow or a bulky towel and put it on the side of the high chair she leans and prop her left arm on it and after a while she will get used to having it on the high chair instead of her side I had the same probables  with my son ...He first time was also carrots.. I remember the first time he spit them out all over me...But after a ew times he liked them...He hated peas.. you better wear something that you don't really like to wear that much..I love her she is a little Doll Baby ..my daughter was that tiny and we used to call her Sweet Pea.from the flint stones...I love your whole family they make me laugh.....😍😍😍😍
She's such a happy baby Anna! you guys are doing a wonderful job
I'm glad you uploaded this. Im a first time mum and my baby is about 2 weeks older than yours. I'm weaning him at the moment. And he makes those faces when I give his food. I thought I was doing something wrong lol x
Oh my god when me and my siblings were little we had those exact trip traps but one in red and one in a lighter wood I even remember giving up my one so my brother could have it ☺️🚼
Look forward to a future where Alessia feeds her carrots to the dogs on the down low.
I remember being told to mix my breastmilk with the baby food when I started feeding Mari solids
She's so little, she doesn't look 6months 😍
My neice is 6months and i saw her eat solids 4 the first time it was so cute and she kept smiling and trying to laugh xx i love her so much
Vomit material. This is the modern world. The abyss is staring at it, staring, and no-ones looking back.
Her face every time you put the spoon in her mouth 😂 bless her
You make my day I was going to see the NHS doctor today changed my mined I just wanted to match you guys love you xxx 😘
It’s not time to chill lol
I’m 27 and I  make the same faces as Alessia when someone forced veggies on me.
Awww her what are you even feeding me face is so funny. Bless her. She's adorable. Hope the next taste/texture of food goes down better with her x
What a beautiful video!!!
How much fuel does your car drink, you put a full tank in testerday
16:39 ahahah😅😅😅
I ordered the calendar can’t wait until I get it except I’m not allowed have it until Christmas 😭so excited looks amazing xxxxx
I love ya'll! You make my heart happy! Such a blessing
That last bit got me all emosh!
I thought they would've started earlier on the baby food. She starting to look chubby.  👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
HOW IS ALESSIA EATING PROPER FOOD. I CAN'T. I remember when she was born and waiting to see pics and it felt like ages an now she's nearly 6 months!!! omg emotional. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
My how times have changed! When my children were babies, the first food introduced to them was  rice cereal mixed very watery with their formula so they could just sort of slurp it down ! Mind you my first child is now 47 years old so that was many many years ago and so many things have changed!
Got it last year and advent but as much as I adore this family funds don’t allow to get this year and poster plus packaging take to nearly 20 so I will just keep the Callander I have as a momento
My niece has that pink Disney Minnie Mouse, she wore it for her 1st birthday ❤❤
Holy crap, I teared up at the end.
Guys, episode guide website doesn't work(
I have never bought a calendar before because I was waiting for the one where Alessia makes her calendar debut and yesterday I bought it 👍👏
I want to be woken like Eduardo 😜
do you guys ship to india ? the calendar ?
No Advent calendar this year? 😔
My mum has ordered the calendar and the poster and I am soook excited ❤️💖💗
I'm crying with joy 💕💕💕💕
You should make a little video of the three of them trying food for the first time! That ending was too sweet by the way!
We're gonna be here for all of Alessia's first and I can't handle the excitment.
Everyone is saying isn't it weird yo have a calendar from an other family. Well I'm sure you have a calendar from idk Shawn Mendes but that's not weird????? Hypocrits.
This is so special! \nVery cute. 💋\nGreetz from Holland
It's insane to me how even though you're only seeing literally less than 5% of someone's day, there are actually people out there who don't comprehend that what you see isn't the whole picture. And these people seem to always be know-it-all's in the comments telling the SacconeJoly's how they are living their lives all wrong because of course, the know-it-all's obviously know everything as well as the amount of people who literally CHOOSE to watch these vlogs, yet consistently make the most asinine and terribly rude comments with the sole goal of tearing this family down. It's honestly so pathetic how people can act so outrageously if they're behind a keyboard where they're 'safe,' yet wouldn't dare to speak the way they do out loud in the 'real world.' \n\nJesus Christ people, let the SacconeJoly's freaking breathe. Let them live rather than criticizing every chance you get. How you treat others says a LOT about your character and who you truly are as a person. Do you feel fulfilled as a human being by always trying to bring someone else down? Ask yourself that and be honest. \n\nAnna and Jonathan, keep on keeping on. Turn a blind eye to those who don't bring anything good to you. Thanks for being my daily getaway from my personal troubles and stress and always bringing me 20 minutes of happiness when I need it most. You have made my life a bit better than it was before I first found you on YouTube. I am forever thankful for that. Keep making your dreams come true! \nGodspeed. ✌🏼❤️
Alessia's little hands are so cute 😂😂😍😍
Do they still have their workouts?
that montage at the end!!
Am I crazy to still think about alessias Burberry jacket she has..is.she big enough yet?? I would love to see it again
Eduardo is my fav!
People by this?!

Awww
Ahhh so cute!! 💗
Maybe see wants something tastier lol

Scammers and crooks!!!

2:08 HE IS ADORABLE .LOVE FROM SPIDERMAN

That poor kid is the family’s pay check... I pray that they stop this and get a real job
Alessia is soooooooo cute ☻♥ ♥ ♥
Women can be builders
Who makes a poster of himself? Only f*cked in the head would Jesus Christ
Ray j is consisntanly full of shit
Why this interview just feel so off like something just not quite right and I can't quite put my finger on it..
I hit it first explain to me how humble you are
And he over 25 he a old head -Uzi
They wanted ray j to go up there & embarrass himself but he flipped the script on em
Did this nigga just really just made lean in interview
i have to think..im telling you his tone of voice just makes the shit sound correct
 A bunch of checks for the fuckery.  Ray J  much love and respect.....
Ray j got that pipe 20k a month.
He playin crazy about that R.kelly stuff fr
Lil Yatchy: I don't hate nothing, I'm making money living life.\n\nJoe: WHAT THE FUCK!? HOW ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY!!!!?? \n\nRay J: I don't hate nothing, I'm making money living life.\n\nJoe: That's what's up man good for you.
i been to silicone valley.  i seen, like ......i seen it
these niggas censored that lean from Ray J Tahe this L Complex
This episode just might be worse than Sza and Issa Rae
I would def let him screw me in all 3 holes on camera
and did he jus confirm Chris is on drugs
He keeps saying sorry cause he was tweaking yet he's drinking lean now lol
LMAO Ray J is ALWAYS being made fun of without knowing it smh. His level of intuition is ZERO. Joe said well if Ray J said it, it must be right. You can tell deep down Joe sees him as a clown. The same way Charlemagne did. The same way we all do. But from Ray J to Cardi B ignorance is accepted and rewarded in today's world
Ray J hit it first kanye
This nigga retarded but smart and Joe need to stop sucking the guests off, fucking lame
For a man to play it so cool and they say he wilds out is too much for me. Im sure theyll change the title of this video soon but oh boy is this fake news title of the year. Much respect to Ray J keeping it cool and not going haywire on these crazy nutty show hosts. The fact that they were trying to push his buttons is the fact that they sensationalized the headline when they couldnt get him to go haywire. Wow. Ray J is dope for keeping his head. Pause.
I like but, not them bars
How is the  nigga getting interviews,when was the last time  he was in the radio?..2001?
&he's trying to make a baby...
Ray J: Epitome of a lame nigga
Everything that comes out his mouth sounds like a lie lol
Ray J's stuck in 2011 with 3 cups sipping nothing.
Ray J is very delusional very
Has anybody noticed that this fake ass tech mogul, fake ass rapper,fake ass celebrity is faking drinking lean.
I TOLD YOU 5 seconds later... yeah im humble.
Damn it's fucked up how they were reaching for dirt the whole interview SMH
The reason why I like the breakfast club is cause they ask the question people want to ask . This guys just go searching for a story even if they aren’t interested
Ray J matured. Complex wit the clickbait. This my first dislike
Ray J and Kanye have to be related!
The sprite bottle is probably blurred out because they don’t wanna give sprite free promotion.. that’s why sometimes rappers shirts or certain labels will be blurred out in their video
Is Ray J a football fan? https://goo.gl/N6ruJc
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY COMPARE THIS DRY ASS LAME SHOW TO THE BREAKFAST CLUB ! ??? LMAO 😂😂😂
I'm humble. - Ray J\n\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bye Bitches! LOL ladies this is what a professional liar sounds like
Which Ray J interview are they talking bout that was so great ??
Craplex done it again dry ass joe budden,weakest interviewer and ak carries them the most
Rayj and Budden should be gay for each other
what's in his cup? lol
everyone using nadeskas lap to rest on
This nigga Ray J has lived a great life deadass. This nigga thotted Out the most famous women in the world grew up on TV as the little brother to a Grammy award winning sister and had one of the most remembered VH1 reality shows of all time he going down as a goat easily
Fake ass title to get viewers smh. Everyday struggle only got 4 more months then it's a wrap
If i had one wish\n*Joe budden premier skin for injustice 2 😂😂😂😂*
Wilding out and being high af is two different Shits
I def didnt see him wild out! I love his growth Great interview. And the album being called Raydemption I would like to hear some r &b like One Wish & another song  w Lil Kim
Did they say he was wildin just cuz he had the lean cup at earlyoclock in the morning or something. Ak ain't neva have to click bait niggas. Complex weak
Ray j just Seems Like the type of Guy who just talks ..
Guess Kanye won't be stepping foot into Complex anytime soon.
Raytronics ? Shit sound like a porn site 😂😂😂
Why he got the white cups with the blurred out sprite bottle tho!!!???     LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!
The reason we have the Kardashians and The Breakfast Club.. If only he could cash the royalties
This nigga better not drop no fucking album named Raydemption.
8:35 iss.. iss.. isszz cowwect- Inspirational quotes by Ray j

CLICKBAIT
Click bait turn away now looool
https://youtu.be/PvzlWE9tZIY
Nigga Joe said RayDemption is mature..
Joe, you don't understand California, there are helicopters everywhere. At least in the cities - Oakland and LA. Very different than the east coast.
Complex, Click Bait titles that aren't truthful diminishes your integrity.
Why do these overrated artist with one or two hits think they're so relevant and impact is so strong. U acted like a fool your whole career ray j.
If you like being introduced to new artist and new music as well as interacting subscribe to our channel
11:10 the realest shit I've ever heard someone say... like Vince Staples said, Ray J can never take an L
From what I see weed and/or lean just make you calm & jus bring up all ya honesty.

Lmao they blurred out the mud 😭
This Guy...
I love how she didn't express the fact that she thinks they're alike in negative way. She ''praised'' both songs and didn't pit one woman against each other. I gotta admit I didn't expect that answer but I loved it. Way to go Fergie!
FERGIE is unbothered I love her.
I love a three way 🤣🤣👏🏽🤦🏽‍♂️
Ok why andy feel the need to bring up Taylorswift in every interview?
The song actually borrows from I'm Too Sexy.
nice way to dodge directly answering that question
I also love a threeway
Andy: I love a threeway ... so casual.
If it was Taylor she would be sueing to the godss
Fergie is beautiful
wow she looks so gorgeous
Andy says, I love a 3-way. LMAO!!! I bet he does.
I love her!
First time I heard it I thought it was very Fergie!
It amazes me how Taylor has so many people hooked on her with such mediocre vocals and basic songs.
So both songs are shite, gotcha.
I love a threeway? I bet the only threeway he had was with his dog and his TV remote control
That's a great answer to that question
Isn't she a mother of a child? Hmmmmm. Great goals!
Its true after hearing Taylor Swifts new song i thought she'd joined the Black Eyed Peas lol
I thought the song sounded like Boom Boom Pow rather than My Humps.
Where is the love?......remember that deep song....what happened? Do they have charities helping others?
Well they both took it from right said Fred - I’m to sexy.
Omg yassss 😍😩❤️
Yeeesss her voice is so lovely!! Sing it!
Don't they all have the same song writers lol
I also noticed the look what you made me do in both songs when I first listened to Just Like You. Love both songs!!
Not feeling taylors song at all!!!
I can’t stand her
They were probably written by the same person.
Most pop songs sound the same to make sure it speaks to the mass/mainstream and sell for millions
I really like how nice and positive she is. ALSO WHEN SHE STARTED SINGING? Slay!
Sounds nothing like Taylor's song. She just want attention and views lol
It's like those vines where the guy's like oh is it the part that goes OHWAOooHAaaWAAAAOHWAAH?
What! The chorus for Taylor's song had the best sampled from Too Sexy For My Shirt song, so I am confused why Fergie name is in the same mix.
Fergie is an amazing live singer
I love it i love a threeway. I bet you do you creeper lmao
Fergie threw no shade I love her
They probably share the same songwriter that's why.
What a legend
We all love 3 ways!
Yeah, they are both shit.
There are only so many combinations of music. Silly pricks trying to cause some drama.
Did anyone else freak out when she started singing? Such a pure voice! Love you Fergie!
As they used to say in the olden days Fergie's got CLASS.\nI said it right away about it sound like Fergie and the Black Eyed Peas
Why would she care that it sounds the same, the chorus of the new Taylor Swift song is shit, monotone, repetitive and boring and with that being the case it says a lot about the chorus of her song.
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that new Taylor swift song was meant for fergie
👌 attitude. Classy lady!
Haha ......... Silance             😂
first time I heard Taylor's song I was like this is so fergie humps
i love a threeway
I love a threeway! Lmao Andy
Nobody claps or whoops after she sung..burn!
They are both shite performers anyway.
Clever reply, classy lady.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZ5phVyvAw
Both shit
Stop using Botox
So they're both shit artists ahhh I get you
Of course they sound the same. Their music is all written by the same guy.
I would suck the farts out of her baking bowl.
Taylor Swift is a tranny. I was shocked when I found out the truth.
Does anybody else cringe when people start singin like that?
Irrelevant
poor thug
Taylor is cancer
Die of aids
oh fergie you pig just shut your mouth and go back to the drawing board
You know what? Fair play to her! I dont like Fergie i never have (except for the first 2 Black Eyes Peas albums and even then i didnt exactly LIKE her) but ive got a lot of respect after seeing this! She easily could have gone in for an attack on Taylor and point out how she sues everyone she can think of for the most pathetic and minor of similarities (she tried trademarking 'haters gonna hate' ffs a saying older than her and she wants to own it) but nope she kept a cool head and proved shes a better person than me 😂
And water, many people are saying, is wet.
This is an island, surrounded by water\n\nJust in case you confused it with an island not surrounded by water.
And this is all the result of a storm. Made of wind. Big wind. Hurricane wind.
This is an island. Surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water.\n-the leader of the free world
This is physically painful to listen to. I can only imagine what his speechwriters feel watching him fumble around like that and drop off script constantly.
this is the idiot with the nuclear codes
Please make it stop.
Thank you, Mr Trump, for explaining to the world what the definition of an island is.
Can a fucking meteor just end us already...
Puerto Rico is not just surrounded by water--it's surrounded by bigly water!
What an absolute, blithering FOOL!!  How much longer must we endure this disgusting disgrace?
Who talks like that a 3 year old?
And Island surrounded by water? For real!?? Who knew!
There is also fish in the water. Big fish. Fish that swim type of fish. Fish.
An island surrounded by water  no fucking shit Sherlock I bet there were major face palms back stage
Painful to listen to and to watch. No need to go into the words he's saying. That's self explanatory. But someone also needs to just put one teleprompter in the front. Trump looks like a fool reading when they're at the sides. He doesn't have the skill to make it look natural.
its an island surrounded by water , big water , ocean water
BOI DAS SOME BIG WATER HAHAHAHAHAH
Dark, dark times. From Obama to this? Incredible, yet there he is!
This shit can't be happening! WHY????
Unbelievable; what moron.
There is no way his brain is running on all cylinders.
Our President is a child.
He is an embarrassment to the American people. And a dangerous man to the world
I heard this on the radio and thought it was a joke, but WOW like that is what an island is,  An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water.  define it for me you 3rd grader...
Obama would have had aid to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands 8 days ago.😏
No more !!! Please !!! Make it stop !!!
Heard smarter responses from beauty pageants
US intelligence steals electric cables and sends them to Florida
Dump actually does the impossible -  makes Bush 2 look like a Rhodes Scholar.
Somebody tell Fish Lips to sit down and shut the hell up.
Wow just wow. George W Bush was more intelligent.
Im going to go freeze myself for 4 years. Wake me up when we have a new president.
It just 1,033 miles from Florida to Puerto Rico.
Does anyone even care he wants to help the port of gold? I get its funny, but chill out guys. He's done great things so far.
Fucking idiot. Just read from the fucking teleprompter and stop improvising.
Big water
So this is what a high IQ sounds like? Fuck, I hope I don't have one.
This tops people die when they are killed.\nThanks Trump, thanks.
He's a nobfaced arse twat ! Waste of seamon and a utter utter bastard!
This is a dumbass surrounded by aholes, big aholes, big jerkoffs
Ok I see we have a very smart president, island with big water  we are truly fucked and everyone supporting him probably think just like him dam dam dam I know homeless people speak better than this and he the president dam
I don't know  if should laugh, cry, get mad or...????  He's Donald trump people
What a complete demented (literally) fool.  Are you embarrassed yet??  Just stick to the teleprompter, I doubt it SAID THAT.
I think this sums it all up. And I mean all of it.
Seriously people!. You must know by now that Trump speaks to his voters, and it is clear to him that he must explain that an island is surrounded by water but not by any water but ocean water.
Americans better pray and hope that Donald Trump is only pretending to be stupid. The point of no return is when Trump starts believing in the things he is saying.
OBAMA HAD CLASS AS A PRESIDENT. BUT NOT EVERONE CAN BE AS NOBLE AS A BLACKMAN. some people are simple minded moron racist pigs sort of like police in amerikkka. This dreadful bloody history of this Cuntry that was built by Slaves For Free and now there made I wanna rest and take a Knee.
I’m not sure whether or not to like or dislike this video 😂
Just painful to watch.....PR is surrounded by big water says POTUS 45th. Disgraceful!
that chin vagina is getting worse
Brawndo's got what plants crave. It's got electrolytes.
This fucktard inspires me that I can achieve anything!
Jesus he's a dumb fuck!!  Elitist, pompous, racist bastard.
oh my fuckin god   what a fuckin  RETARD!!! AND EVRYONE THAT VOTED FOR HIM.....BIG RETARDS..AN ISLAND WITH BROWN PEOPLE ON IT...YOU MOTHER FUCKIN BIGOT!!!!! COME ON AMERICA LETS PITCH IN AND HELP PEURTO RICO OURSELVES!!! go to Ricky Martins YourCaring website....just a dollar each of us.....people are fuckin dying and Trump dont even care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
F-tard
lol he made it clear to us that the island is not attached to the mainland
I swear to God in heaven this is the dumbest human being ever!
What an embarrassment Trainwreck Trump is to our country. I'm only glad my kids are too young to know.
The use of 'totally', TWICE in less than 2 minutes. It burns my ears!!!
New meme?
Trump can barely speak coherent English. This isn't having a New York accent, this is ridiculous.
Without food or water, people die. Not alive anymore. Forever.\n\nDon't make absurd excuses. Help them live and not die. Oh and thanks. I would not have understood what island meant without your articulate explanation. *rolls eyes*
I thought puerto rico was surrounded by dasani water, boy was I mistaken
Trump is Puerto Rico's Killer. BOOGIE MAN.
only if they are white and his voters like tx and fl.
The usa in 2017 is surrounded by trump redneck supporters bigger ignorance and wider americas foolishness
Island Water! My vocabulary is improve ALL DAYS. Thanks you Premier Troomp!
Trumps speech on the situation is loaded with condescending signals. He repeatedly states how totally useless the Puerto Rican government is and kind of says we have to do everything for them not in a good way but as if he is complaining. It's terrible how rascist this official is. He can't even mask his internal rascism and emotions on the issue for a simple speech.
Someone needs to make a YouTube poop out of this.
What a dumbass.
ｂｉｇ　ｗａｔｅｒ
aahhhhh ha haahahahhah lol ... 8 yrs of Obama traitor, now you get your 8 years ! looooooove TTTTRUmps Haaaate.. remember! : D
gotta love trump
LOL xD
Dear DOTARD Drumpf! New Orleans!
Basket case.
Trump's an idiot.
This incredible amount of education and knowledge is truly refreshing. GOOD JOB! Incredible! Each and every six-year-old will be proud of you. Make islands wet again! Repeal and replace the tides! Drain the irritating oceans! :-)
If you take out the duplicated phrases, this clip is 10 seconds MAX. However, the dictionary description of what an island is can be very helpful to all the 5 year olds out there. I never thought I'd say this, but I miss DubbaYaa's press conferences more and more every day!
Hehe oh right
Fake news nobody not that stupid in real life lol
Soo, it's a peninsula? - Trump Supporter
But Puerto Ricans sucked US balls to be US State
Donald Trump has a lot of money. I guess that disproves the old adage that a fool and his money are soon parted.
He's a big dumb buffoon, isn't he folks? Save your breath. It must get tiring constantly defending this orange idiot...
President Trump needs to explain what an island is so libtards will understand, .... and yet libtards still don't get it.
Trump is actually a highly intelligent and well spoken business man, in private. Here, he is trying to communicate to his countrymen...a couple hundred million poorly educated mass-consumption fools, who have been dumbed down by generations of liberal democratic education programs and moronic Hollywood entertainment. I feel sorry for him, because most of his fellow Americans have become too brainwashed by the (closet communist) liberals to understand his good ideas. Glad I am not American.
Pia looks like the sweetest girl 😍
I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn’t have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don’t see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video 😉 https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs
aw nah nah nah, you're fucked HAD ME DYING HAHAHAHA <3 this collab

This video is Everything! Shows me that I'm not the only one who struggles with wigs and that you Will be able to see the lace.
LIKE BEFORE WATCH CLUB 😂❤️
When I first saw the thumbnail I thought they were the same person
Two of my faves 🙌
pia's makeup😍😍😍😍😍
Watch the Jackie Aina tutorial!
Yeaak
2 beautiful ladies ❤️❤️
Pia is the best I love her sooo much ❤️💜💕✨ this was sooo funny !!!!
LOL.  You guys did that all wrong in front.   😂😂😂
Chloe looks like Belle from Beauty and the Beast with that long haired wig!! Loll
That's because you aren't....nevermind. Y'all tried it, good job.
Pia looks exactly like Angelina Jolie
12:46 😂. Oh nuh nah nah, yr fucked 😂😂😂😂 subscribed!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂
To get rid of the spotty look you have to put powder foundation under the lace to help cancel out the dark lace roots. Try it next time, that should help. Also, you can cut the part around your ear to contour to the natural curve of your head. So don't be afraid to cut some lace and hair around your ears.
What does an Australian accent sound like to an English woman vice versa?
Girl just chop all that lace off!!! God I just wanted to jump thru the screen and help!😂 watch Nikita Draguns video on how she applies her wigs! It's bomb 🔥
I'm so picky with wigs like I can't stand fake looking ones but the ones I want like these are too expensive
Hey Chloe look up freedom couture hair on YouTube she has heaps of tips and tricks! X
Omggg you turn the wig inside out and put your own power foundation on the lace parts
Check out Blondielocks here on you tube.  She is the best at explaining wigs from what to buy, styling a wig and how to make it look less 'wiggy' looking!!
Pia's arms are ripped !!! I wish mine looked like that.
The struggle is real! :) I totally understand the confusion. I was clueless when I started wearing wigs years ago. I am still trying to master the lace game! :)
What do I do about that?\nYeah, see, idk... \nMMMMMMEEEEE giving advice
Gross waste of money. Why people support this company I'll never know.
It's better brown on pia
It takes practice just like everything else in life. I think you both look awesome and can master the wigs.
I love how you just casually got freedom couture wigs, I'd give an arm for one, losing all my hair :(
I cant believe they wasted 1500 dollars just to fuck it up.
Chloe -- do a video using only products that don't test on animals please.  It would be such a great boost for these companies and you don't have to put down any other company -- just highlight the ones that don't test. Thanks! <3
Chloe check out this youtuber's tutorial on wig application\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDLCu-8DXsE
I've been married 16 years. I have a pretty good wife though we've had our problems. Here's why I don't recommend marriage for unmarried men now:\nFirst, the stakes are incredibly high. The risk of failure is too high, unacceptably high. The odds of finding a suitable partner who can and will actually be in it for the long haul are too low.\n\nSecond, marriage for a man means mostly taking on duties and obligations. The offer was sweetened because in exchange for his taking on those obligations, the prospective husband was traditionally promised one real, valuable benefit: Good, regular sex at reasonable intervals with a reasonably attractive women, all with a minimum of effort. But even that's not guaranteed now because many wives do not consider they have any obligation to have sex with their husbands and feel justified in withholding sex for the flimsiest of reasons or no reason at all. And besides, a man who wants sex in this time need not marry to get it. All he needs is either (1) minimal game competence; or (2) money for prostitutes.\n\nSo, if he can't even get some minimal guarantee of the one benefit he's supposed to get out of the deal, why should he even try to make the deal in the first place?\n\nSorry this betrays some of my Christian beliefs. I'm just stating realities on the ground.\n\nWhile women certainly do have feelings, and they sometimes use the word 'love' to describe it- It depends on how we define love.... is it a passionate moment of powerful feeling... or is it a lifetime of commitment and sacrifice?
Hi Chloe, if you end up not using one or both of the wigs, please consider donating them to a cancer charity
Oh Chloe! Jackie Aina has a wonderful video on this: https://youtu.be/uDLCu-8DXsE
the pieces near your ears that you were struggling with, i've seen people use double sided tape on their face and like stick it down and it works and also gives you a nice little face lift
ur supposed to cut the lace around wig
I've seen great tutorials from black women who basically wear wigs 24/7 and they glue the lace to their own hairline and it looks flawless.
She looks like the chick from Glee.  Santana.
It is quite dissapointing how noticable the lace is on a freedom couture wig.  I was going to save up money for one but the mesh is very spaced out and seems thick, and for that expensive of a wig, you expect to look more natural and seamless. Ive bought 300 dollar wigs with better up close lace than that.  There are ways around it.  I would look up videos to try and cover the mesh.. some people use got2b glue on the inside of the cap and let it dry to cover it up.  Personally I am a silk top girl and if I dont like the lace on the wig that is touching my scalp I put the wig a bit father back to almost see my hairline and I color it with brown eyeshadow powder.  Hard to explain but it looks a lot more natural.   You should also put Freedom Couture in your title so more people can see it.  I know I am glad to have found your video before purchasing.  Thank you for the honest review.  Your wig is workable though so don't worry!
From far away and on their Instagram account they made it look so easy and so pretty and natural af but in real life you can see everything
How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you’re wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you’d leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn’t match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too
ladies if you buy a wig that expensive you need to get one with bleached knots so you cant tell its lace.
You can sew the lace under so you don't have to cut it :)
Lol.. I bought a $1700 wig from freedom couture and didn't even get a wig cap with it. Beauty bloggers getting more treatment? Hm yeah
I ordered one and it didn't fit on my head!! It was so small and they told me it was a large! The company are really vague with details.
If you don't want that wig , I'll take it
Also there are usually clips on the inside to help keep the side down.. but look up  got 2 be glued method
I’m surprised no blow torch was brought out 😂
Chloe, If u hate them, I have alopecia and can only leave my house with a wig on. I will gladly take them off your hands 😬🙏🏻
hey everyone! I just wrote a simple blog post on how to eat organically to lose weight and stay healthy. Please support <3 \nhttps://thehealthynewyorker.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/delicious-organic-healthy-breakfast-ideas/
You guys are both beautiful!!!!
You guys need to join Wig Skaters group on Facebook. $1500 is way to much for a wig
You get your foundation then flip the wigs and place it on the lace. Braid you real hair to lay flat then use gots to be glued to keep the wig Down or you can sew the wig on
Holy shit, you spent $3000 on wigs she will never wear. Crazy!
you also have to put make underneath the lace in order to make it more like scalp jajaja its also called bleaching the knots or hiding the knotsss
😝
Pia looks like jhene aiko here
chloe you are sooooooo pretty
Am I the only one that thinks that at some angels Pia looks like Jennifer Lawrence?
I'm a black woman and those wigs looks so natural but 1500 dollars might as well should of tried clip in extensions would of saved some money!!!
I'm a guy and even i found this funny to watch.
Pia looks like Nina dobrev at certain angles with that wig on!!!
As a straight male I watched this to learn for my girlfriend. That is all.
Those wigs are amazing, you guys just don't know how to put them on but it was really funny 😂😂 do more vids together! Maybe watch some black YouTubers, they know the best wig techniques
This was such a funny and fresh video! Thank you Chloe, nice meeting you Pia! By the way you look Really good with that dark colored wig. I suggest you also check Jackie Aina's video on how to install the wigs. Blessings from Mexico 🇲🇽
I totally understand your frustration!! esp with the sides!!! i have a wig that i never use because the lace on the sides is always showing.....and i can never manage to conceal the lace in front either? :(
Stick with the Jon Renau, and Raquel Welch wigs. The lace front in these wigs are very realistic, no cutting lace as it's already cut.\nGet hand tied as they're much better quality.
Hey, put a 1 shade lighter concealer in the wig scalp!
Sorry if it's a mess at work 😝
Chloe quick tip get some wig glue and glue the edges down, then you can use concealer (personal preference is face powder) along the part to hide the lace. Also you can trim them side bits to your liking ( be careful and take your time ) then glue them down 😘💖
بحبك كتير وبعشق فديوهاتك im from syria
those wigs would look so good if u knew how to properly wear then 😭😭
The girl with the blonde hair looks like jhene aiko. The other one looks like Kendall Jenner.
There are so insanely amazing wigs out there! Look up Diniwigs online or insta!
Tip! If you plan on wearing the wig with the cap try picking up a dark coloured wig cap so it doesn't show through the wig! Light coloured caps work better with light coloured wigs so it doesn't look like weird patches :) also netted caps are a lot more comfy than stocking caps!
You are so funny
Chloe! Watch a tutorial of a black girl doing it..!!!! They are the pros at it
Dumb white girls
I think the girl with brown hair could bear me a fine son.
What a ugly girl
I watched a couple of front lace wig videos and some of the ones I watched the people cut the lace off before they put on the wig and I think that would be much easier and you could get some of the side bit of mesh/lace.
I'm guessing the question soon will be 'Tara where are you?'
tarararewee?
Tara is taking him to all these places without telling him where because she is probably going to kill him at one of them.
I trolled my girlfriend, for vanity and youtube likes.
Yeah... that was painfully not funny.
Wow so original...
Tarawewawi
unoriginal wanker
Lots of negative comments but the content was still good :)
Would have been a good video if the last one was a Tara would you marry me?, but this is just annoying.
Wow your girlfriend is so lucky.  She must think you're so unique.  I've never seen anyone do a video like this before..............................
unfunny copy of the other guy wasn't funny either
tarawawy?
If she havent dumped you after this, your lucky..........
I challenge you to a duel in quake live
But, where were they?
I guess she doesn't understand that not responding will cancel out the joke?
not funny, not original.  go away
Where were you at :25? Jay and Silent Bob get around
Don't see how this is remotely funny, just a pretty sad attempt to seem witty.
Cringey and not funny at all
What's her name?
Tara take me along next time.  Especially to the place with the electric scooter.
At one point they were in Crysis
lol the amount of people in the comments that can't even handle this video.
guess who is single again!
Breaking News: Man annoys girlfriend with same repetitive unfunny prank over and over again, films it and the video goes ｖｉｒａｌ

i'd take this down before your gf reads the comments and gets validation for how annoyingly unfunny this is
Fuck bro you're annoying, you're lucky she didn't ditch you.
Tara, please answer him!
tawaawaawy?
Tara, you should be with me instead.  I will never ask you where we are.
what's with the random Jay and Silent Bob painting at 0:25 ? Where was that?
Is it only for me or she played along the whole video?..
when they are in the bedroom 'Tara, where are we?'
Where are we Tara?
WHERE ARE YOU THEN?!
Ruined your whole trip for this lol
Yep. These things still aren't cute or funny or anything
This is the least enjoyable version of this, bothering your girlfriend thing. You should take a page from the “they got enough X here” or the ikea pun guy.
how is this funny?
leaves on the motor bike - laughed real hard
Hi @LTavvy! I'm with ABC News! Did you make this video? Can we use it on all ABC platforms/partners with credit to you?
Tawawawee
tarawaahwahhee
Bunch of white supremacist
Tara where are weed?
Snootch to the nootch
where are we tho? #woke
Why?
Nobody cares
Abusing women, filming it and putting it on YouTube for the world to see is NOT okay.  Males need to realize that this is NOT acceptable behavior.
I have no words to describe the awesomeness of this performance. Kelly is the epitome of a TRUE artist. Not too many artists out there today who are as diversified or talented as Kelly is>>>
The studio version is brilliant but wow, this LIVE version is PHENOMENAL. Kelly is such an amazing vocalist. Her new album already deserves a big publicity, popularity and tons of Grammys
Kelly you look and sound beautiful as always! I forever fan since the beginning I will always cherish you! XO
Absolutely amazing. Can’t wait to hear the album.
Kelly believe me... you moved me like that!
Amazing, speechless, incredible all of the above .... Always will be a FAN 💕💕💕
She's perfect <3
SING SING SING KELLY! Shes so talented it is unbelievable!!!
FAVE SONG 😍
Goosebumps!!
CHILLS!! GO KC!
Everything shes been dropping is really amazing...
I'm sorry but more people need to be talking about this. There are pop stars that get all the glory but there are real, under-rated underdogs like P!nk and Kelly Clarkson who are just FULL of talent but don't get the attention they deserve.
My God...this is so beautiful. Sure moved me. I'm bawling.
Kelly has one of the better voices today.   Amazing.  Go Mrs Burleson!
She deserves so much more than she gets, Kelly is a beautiful soul that shows us what a true artist looks, sounds, and acts like. This is music!
She's pure gold.
this song makes me cry
Mmmm, the way u move me...
This is music.  This is artistry.  Absolutely superior.
This is one of my favorite things Kelly has ever done. This song, this video especially, always moves me and makes me so emotional.
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE!!
Her  voice is amazing
The very 1st American Idol winner...\n🌺🔅🌺🔅🌺
Damn..... this was fantastic. :) love her cant wait to her the whole album.
Voice of an angel, a band like a newborn baby - sweet and adorable, and a song as beautiful as all of the others that has been recorded by kc ❤❤❤❤❤

Amazing as always.  Gave me chills.
What clowns disliked this video?
Oh Kelly, the times we are in we don't deserve someone like you. My goodness though I'm grateful you're around. ❤❤❤
Her vocals are exactly like the original recorded song! WOW! GOOSEBUMPS
I've loved her since idol. She is such a talented powerhouse and we get to be blessed by the great music. I'm always blown away when I hear her live because she sounds even better than the record. I can't wait for the new album!
Wow, simply wow this could be her defining song. Her hero or I will always love you she's up there with them.
The background singers are insane
DAMN KELLY!!!   I LOVE THIS
This version is so much better than the studio one. That tells you the knd of artist Kelly is
Incredible! Amazing! Perfeita como sempre! Que voz!
Praise the Lord, she's herself now! Thank you, Atlantic Records...sort of...you guys are the ones who have actually lucked out!
Now you're singing like a know you can.
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
Great \n\nSubscribe, watching & download mp3 On My Channel :-D\ngoo.gl/cICvOy
Why doesn't this have a million views already??
This woman has an extraordinary voice. 👏👏👏🎶🎤🎵
Wish she did this on xfactor finale
This song deserves a Grammy. Hoping the album is killer and she gets a few nominations for it in 2019 <3 <3 <3
nice
WIG
11 really silly/stupid people out there. I mean, I respect different tastes in music, but disliking this song??? WTF?
Which imagery did you guys connect with the most? For me, the thrill of christmas morning.  I distinctly remember that childhood experience of waking up a little chilly and running downstairs while hearing x-mas music and seeing a glowing x-mas tree..plus the gifts of course.  As a child, it last a lifetime.
I couldn't love this more!!
The beauty in the the whole aspect of this song
Even with 50 CENT in tha house playing the drums, Kelly sounds amazing!
EPIC... Just Amazing. Without autotune, Live and Just better than the record...
Clicked *like* before i can even hear a second of the song. Duh.
Such restraoned power in her voice.
Wow. What a performance. :'-)
Incredible...I have no other words.
The real deal ! Kelly is amazing
Please, come back to Brazil! \n\nO Brasil te ama 👏😍
Stunning.  I'm so buying this album
Ok, this song MUST be a single! Sooooo beautiful! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️\nI love you girl. Can't wait for your new album... *-*
Is she bare foot? Lmfaoo classic kelly, i love her sfm. Amazing song
Verdadeira , Maravilhosa , com certeza alguém que esta cumprindo uma missão muito especial aqui nesse mundo , memorável , amável , Mulher forte determinada , incrivel ... Não tem como não querer conhecer Kelly Clarkson ... Que honrra ainda em 2017 ouvir essa grande artista , apreciar essa obra de arte unica.
Wow when she started slaying the song... So full of passion..

Maravilhosa 😍
VOCALS!!!
Amo q últimamente hagan los videos en sesiones d estudios! Se puede apreciar mas sus voces ❤❤
Incredible, never sounded better
8 people gave this a thumbs down.  Really?  8 people?  Did these people confuse thumbs down for being freaking awesome?  This performance is amazing.  Definitely in the top 10 of her performances.  The production of this is just phenomenal.  How she doesn't win all of the Grammy's is beyond me.
just wondering; why she is not using her vevo account anymore?
I'm crying. Thank you for this gift Eden.\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you
I cried for the first time since my breakup today and it was because of this song. It's been almost a month
Something about this music video felt so real, I was mesmerized.
I have waited so long
The beginning is Vertigo I believe. That is pretty cool.
What camera is used? It’s great for filming
please stay our little secret
143 people obviously have never herd good music before🤷🏻‍♀️
Jonathon is the only artist I can listen to all day on repeat. I just want to say thank you. Your sound has helped my friends and I get past the rough patches in our lives. It has also helped one of my friends pursue he dreams in music. No other artist can or will ever do what your sound does for us. That You EDEN
I loved  it  sm  💙💙💙 nd the music  video  is just  sensational i found  the  whole  song  amazing  bless  u jonathan  u really  know  how  to  be  you  a different  individual beautiful  human being 🌸🌼🌸💙
The best part about Jon's music videos is he features aesthetic sky and beauty of nature instead of girls jumping around in bikini. Such a gorgeous song and video
I  wish I could give you more than a like! your songs are AMAZING. Honestly please never stop this
Your my idol\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.s you kinda look like an older version of my brother
I love all EDEN songs because they're so real and raw with emotion but literally this song with the video made me cry like a little kid. This is fucking next level shit. Beautiful.
Please put everything you've ever done on itunes so I can give you my all money!
You dont even know how much i relate to this, it calmed me so so much
I always love eden song I only know everything he talks about it the stuff I'm going though and he inspires me to write my own song that are as good as he's I song one of my song 4 my mom so she knows I'm the same person as I was lil
I listened to this song for 2 hours straight and it still wasn't enough, I can't explain to you the feeling this gives me.
At first, I didn't like this song that much. I really like EDEN and I was like... maybe it is just me. But every single time I listen to it, I like it a little more. It has come to the point I like it as much as Rock + Roll
It's funny because the day before I looked to see if he released anything new or when he last released it, and then I saw this one and lost my shit
*I've been looking at the sky since i was like 5 years old* yes.
Hey Eden, great song! You are one of my favourite artists, I hope I will see you live one day. The song just kick ass'es, I listen to that song to get into flowstate before I start to grind. Keep up that great work.  BR
this is such a beautiful film, the song is pretty good too xD
Ever since Eden Project this man is the goat
How can you NOT love this???
dont wanna be That person but please come to Brasil
Holy shit, the song and video fit so good together. It was worth to wait all this time for a new song. Continue with the great work Eden  😊
Such a good song Love you Eden ❤️
Of course I hope there is a heaven.\nThe thought is extremely comforting to my fears of losing those I love.\nBut there's no reason to believe in any of the manmade gods.\nI don't see why I should compromise my morality and intellectual integrity for fear.\nIt's life.  None of us get out of it alive.
such a beautiful work of art - this is truly a masterpiece
make more music dont ever stop keep going
A beautiful song made by a beautiful man
@EDEN when will u have more merchandise available?
First listen seems kinda bad to me, but not it sounds rly rly good ! But it's the first time his perfect lyrics don't talk to me yet :/
IM SO IN LOVE WITH YOU! \nPLEASE MARRY ME!\nYOU SAVED ALL THE LAST YEARS FOR ME AND NOW OMG!\nPLEASE BE MINE FOREVER, YOU ARE THE BEST!
the bes music x
IM SO LATE AND I CANT EVEN LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE I HAVE NO HEADSET AHHH FUCK MY LIFE
I need you singing in Brazil!
FUCK YES A NEW EDEN SONG!!!!! THERE IS A GOD! :D ily EDEN <3
MARRY ME ALREADY ):
IM PREPARED OMG
marry me
<3
start making clothes please <3
This song is relaxing 💜
NICEEEEEE MAAN!!!!!!
Beautiful, as always <3
I absolutely love the song but I think this is a rare case where the video detracts from the music. The whole time I'm trying to figure out the importance of the footage but realize there really isn't any. Yes it's beautiful and sure it can be argued that it's a similar feeling of the song but it's just not capturing me as much as the music itself.
How can this even get any dislikes!?
Love this song its so beautiful
I want that EDEN becomes really famous because he deserves it.. But on the other side I want that EDEN is our little secret...
This song is beautiful i love it it’s my current favorite song😍 everytime i hear it my feels really begin to showing. Eden had always been my mood singer wherever i’m sad or happy Eden has always have the right song for each mood it’s a positive thing ofc each way i love his voice and his song show some love to him by liking this not tryna get attention from you guys but i do this bc i love his songs🖤🌑
I saw a new Eden song and I was like hell yeah then I saw an add come up and I punched my monitor
I was digging this so hard until around 1:20
where's ngals comment at?
thanks!! rosie ashley, michael marren, tim kellner, adrian bliss, evan holland, ato alexander
These shot are amazing, also the song too
im not ready for this new era but this song gave me feels hello
Stuck between being broke and shocked at the fuckin' same time. EDEN is One of the 🐐.
A E S T H E T H I C C
The only person i would go gay for.
This song is just... idk how to describe it its just so goddamn beautiful
omfg you can't believe how much i love you and your music. you helped me through soooo much and oh my gosh. I can't even put it into words. favourite singer for a lifetime!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
EDEN's visual effects are some of the best out there. His songs, videos and pictures inspire me all the time.
EDEN keeps smashing through his own ceilings. Beautiful piece 👌🏻
By far the best music video ever
He should do a studio version of amnesia.
<3

Does anyone know where I can find his You don't love me yet sweater??
Fucking rubbish, good for wankers
I feel like this was a let down compared to previous songs :(
So impressive. Well done.
Wow. Awesome workshop. Love it. Fantastic job. 👍🏻
Nice
Beautifully done!
This was awesome man.
Great proyect...tons of ideas.
Wow!! Awesome!
Sponsored by Ryobi much?
This is amazing
Proper video bro
Jealous!
Excellent!!! Keep’em coming.
Amazing
Well done!
totally not sponsored by everyone hhaha
Amazing
Good advert for ryobi
Good job 👍👍
so gay
nice video
Wow. Impressive.
Super inspiring!!
Very nice!
I love it!
Unbelievably Great job!
Fantastic ;-)
Good job 😀👏
Thanks. I feel inadequate now.
A true man-cave...
i cant even build ikea furniture
Lucky sister. Awesome build!
You could clearly read OCD
Awesome!
nice workshop you made there 👍🏼
Looks really well done. \n\nWhy do I have a sudden urge to buy an entire set of Ryobi battery powered tools from The Home Depot????
How much was the shed with solar end price?
Nice video, but white in a workshop seems silly to me.  Just my opinion.  Nice work though..
Would it be wise to provide extra venting for the battery box?
Great job on this project and video. Love it!
This guy's voice is soothing as shit.
I love that modern build guy!
Why everything is green? From the same brand?
Do a shipping container!
Can you come to my house...
a lot of ryobi product placement also husky tools is this a home depot commercial
Great shed. Nice tip regarding the measuring strip. You are Home Depot's bitch.
Be interesting to adapting this to Minnesota. LOL! Nice work and hope it meets your needs.
this was awesome! i wish i had one shed like that!
wow love it, I'm a little jealous. Slowly building my Ryobi collection though.
Must have been very expensive
Awesome shop my brother i like it do more project like this one good job :)
Very cool, but what's the point of painting everything inside white?
The longest Home Depot commercial i've ever watched! but seriously looks like a great space and really like the use of solar
wow, so creative and effective!
You make it seem so easy! Love it the big project
this is so cool!! always looking forward to ur new videos :-) and my gosh, this could have been slip into 2 part vids xDD\nenjoyed it so much!
i really like wood projects in parallel with some electric features \nkeep going (y)
Solar components have really decreased in cost over the past 20 years! Great project!
Haha picking the spot took 3 chickens too. That's a good shot. ....0:30.... Awsome yard , I would of painted/power sprayed the fence too.
What's with all the white? Nothing looks worse than dirty white in a workshop. It is a workshop, right?
I have this exactl shed, with a roll up door on one side but I wouldn't have went all white. But to each there own. End result is cool though.
It would be nice to see a list of all the materials and cost.
Cool shed but if you say Royobi again I will have to hunt you down.
Yeah man bigger projects mixed in is great
you should name it the ryobi workshop
Well done.  Look online for a multi-function work table on casters.  You can mount various tools onto it that are either swivel or on a slide-out shelf. In addition, it is also used as a storage area....everything neat and tucked away.
Looks great.....but why not paint white the conduit incoming from panels
Most awesome project I had ever seen
Nice little project - wouldn't it be more efficient to run the tool chargers and lighting directly off of the DC power, before the inverter? These chargers seem perfect for a solar system http://www.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-18-Volt-ONE-In-Vehicle-Dual-Chemistry-Charger-for-use-with-12V-DC-outlet-P131/100342149
How's it holding during rainy days?
Nice! But I would suggest replacing the battery charge system with a DC/DC converter, going DC > AC > DC is incredibly inefficient and wastes electricity. I would imagine that every little helps on a little 400W setup like this.
Could I get a Nema 14-50 outlet installed and connected to a solar panel?
This is very nice! All I can say is WOW!
How long do the batteries hold charge when you are working? I've wanted to do this but worry I won't have the power for bigger build days.
you have an obsession with royobi
Very nice and considerate design
how much u paid to let them build the whole garage ?\nthe panel is water proof ?\nwhat happen if it rain or snow it get wet?\ndoesn't work anymore?\ni love the shelfs of the garage u can put things in don't wasted any space ..\ngarage should be big enough for a car to go inside?\nsuv or a normal car\ni think the garage should be a little more bigger wilder \nfor me that a small garage \nmaybe add a ceiling fan on top of the garage for those\nhot summer day's?
A nice clean build. Your choice of inefficient lighting seemed odd. I forgot how groovy it is to design without budget constraints. Did a whole 1-1/2 car garage like this with old crappy shelving and plywood wall panels. A coating of epoxy paint on the floor and 5 gallons of white acrylic paint sprayed on everything... Looked like a million bucks when finished.
This is cool as fuck ... subbed
That looks like a perfect small machinist shop! I'd be down to build one of these!
I'm in the industrial renewable energy side of the business and get questioned a fair bit about off-grid, residential builds. Honestly, thanks for making this video because I'm just going to hotlink the url and give it out to people interested in the future. Great build, definitely jealous of the workshop!
You are like the Martha Stewart  of sheds.
400w panels; oh 1200$ for some good ones. Inverter ~3-500$ depending on your wattage. 300$ for 2 good reliable batteries.\n\nAt least 2 grand for off the grid.\n\nAt 8 hours of maxed out use per day, it will take roughly 15 years to break even. IF it even lasts that long... \n\nNeat, and a cool idea, but not very practical yet.
Sponsored by Ryobi? 😂
I would like to see the affordable house build.
Is this a home depot commercial?
And that my friends, that's how you build a grow house (;
Minor nitpick:  Sure your inverter will handle the drill press and band saw together with no load, but that's not how you use them.  Try it again, but lean on that drill press with a piece of mild steel under it, and have your buddy cut something with the band saw simultaneously.  I'm not looking up part numbers and specs, but I'll bet the two tools spinning with no load is less than 500 watts.  Most cigarette lighter inverters can do that for a few seconds.
Shouldnt you ahve used DC chargers for the tools, that way your not converting from DC to AC to DC and wasting more electric then needed?
How about a 6 x 12 off grid hunting cabin?
Maybe the next project could be a system in a shed big enough to power a house off grid completely.  It should have individual circuit shut down as the power drains, leaving power only for critical use devices  (fridge, furnace,...).\n\nMaybe add HHO and vertical axis windmill?  Maybe you have a different idea where the power for this should all be stored.  I think a shed or barn would be better than a house.
I was wondering how much power the solar panels produce if it was enough to run an air conditioner? As I live in the south this is a must also should I add more panels or batteries?
How much money did you dump into a building you can't rotate a 2x12-14 or 16 without banging into something, angling or finagling?  I'm poor.  All I have to work out of is my one car, and THAT'S insanity.  I can't IMAGINE that....
How do you know what type of solar panel and equipment to get?
You guy forgot the eyewash station and fire extinguisher!
Why are you transforming DC into AC and back into DC again?\nYou could just modify the chargers so they run off DC and have a way more efficient system!\n\nSame with lighting, no need to use AC for that.\n\nEverything except motorised tools could be run off DC perfectly fine and way more efficient.
Was the table saw ran by the shed power?  Just curious on what can be ran by your shed,
Why is it that all American sheds builds I see, they just place the shed on top of the ground? If it's never freezing then I guess that explains some of it, but what about wind?
That Home Depot kit has an MPPT charge controller.
What about collecting rain water, Filter it, to Wash hands?
He sold his soul to the devil.   What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul.
Made a fortune appealing to the natural instincts of humans. Right on man
I never got to meet him:(
Got married, had a daughter, had a midlife crisis, then decided his life was missing something. He started a magazine that glorifies the objectification of women. Then got divorced, got rich, and died. Was it worth it?
Although I don’t approve of pornography and I am not a fan of Mr. Hefner, I’m sorry that he died.
very wicked evil man, he caused so many people to fall into sin because of his iconic sinful influence, the devil was and still is his father even in death. hes now reaping what he sowed now, hugh hefner is merely a proverb for mankind to learn of what NOT to do. its a shame that he chose to throw away his soul and how he lived to continue to not genuinely care for other peoples hearts and souls, not even his own son, he was a bad role model for so many things, he threw away his role as a father, husband and man in general, please learn from this mans selfish way of life, run to Jesus.
It took me a long time to like hugh hefner.
DIRTY PEDOPHILE!!!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS CASE , RAPING 5YEARS OLD???????????????
So all of those scantily clad Playboy bunnies need a place to live now? And all that I need is a mansion??? And then they can all come and live with me and I'll be in heaven??? Thank you JESUS!
He destroyed to many families
Hugh Hefner's last words: *Oh God, the flames, I''m burning!!!!!!*
Their is a video of Hugh Hefner, rejecting the call to accept JESUS CHRIST, by Victor The Baptist; on youtube, What does it profit a man to gain the 🌎 world to lose his soul, Mark 8:36!!!!
Well, at least he wasn't a hypocrite. There's more mercy from God for straightforward bad people than for liars and hypocrites. Nevertheless, let's hope he repented at the last, because otherwise there'll be no RIP for poor, pathetic Heff.
There goes the last sane man on earth.
HEFFF IM MISS YOU GAVE MY LITTLE BROTHER FIRST PLAYBOY.
His. Last. \nWord\nWas\nIts\nGetting. Hot.\nIn. Here😈😈😈😈😈
CERTIFIED AMERICAN BADASS #5\n               HUGH HEFNER\nStop-Motion Animation Comedy dedicated to The Gentleman About Town - Hugh Hefner
Hugh hefner died still an IMPERFECT MAN, seen as a pervert and just fully degraded woman..

This man is a great example of gain the whole world but lose your soul..
Man if only he knew that throught the world for more than 5 decades he was responsiable for the hapiness of a lot of  young men ... I myself was one who used to spend a lot of time in the rest room just reding playboy.
14:20 the ultimate Alpha males.
A lot of the girls I've fallen in love with. What's love got to do with it? Orwellian dementia.
My daughter in law loved Hugh Hefner. He was a great business man. He showed people you can do anything no matter where they come from. He lived a great  lifetime
You Go Hugh. Singular man accomplishing great business.
He did all this to get back at his wife nice
The real moral of the story:\nFirst and foremost, a number of girlfriends are easier than one wife.
oddly i expect his empire is bancrupt ... but his reputation allowed him to survive in the last years ~
This was created before he died
talk about revenge on the first chick who cheated
....it's hot down here.
I believe in exactly what Hughe Hefner believes in; something good, magical, and exciting, yet unconscious.

Dad : What do you wanna grow up to be ?\nMe: Hugh Hefner.
So basically he got red pilled after rejection and cucked. And the rest is history
He Used women and in the end women used him....Karma.
Thanks for the good childhood memories❤️
Clint eastwood is going to be the next to go
No such things as the last words of Hefner! Ain’t a titty that will come out a bra that you can’t thank hugh.....
Hugh created a media empire that revolved around the objectification of women, and made it seem intellectual and hip to do so. We should not idolize him.
He was so handsome
Hugh Hefner is the only person who can say 'I wasnt in it for the money' and I dont roll my eyes
RIP to the man
Say Hi to John Holmes, let him know Ron Jeremy is taking care of unfinished business down here where he left off.  Rip playboy
HUGH HEFFNER HELD CIA  ,DEMON ,WORSHIPPERS AND A SATANIC PROMIS , AND SACRIFICE , OMG SACRIFICE TO THE DEVIL
Wait. This isn't Destiny 🤔
Hustler > Playboy\nFlynt > Hefner\nOvert Perverseness > Covert Pedophilia
sad pathetic senile old man
At least he  does not need Viagra to get stiff anymore.
Heff lived to the fullest!
Rest in peace

Legend
The real Playboy🤘
A real OG
RIP sexist pig
Sleazy
Perverted Pedophile! ....Gone! ...
Hell's Bells!!
Rip king of pimps
Glorified creep
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
I like playgirl better than playboy
He saw the goodness in others...helped so many people and animals...He was there with Tea, Sympathy, and Hospitality when one needed a Friend...!!
Women are NOT sexual objects they are Human beings with feelings, talents and deserve to be treated with respect and not used for the pleasure of the Male Supreme.  They are the bearers of life, and the authors of Love and have a natural spirituality.  Women are to be loved and repected as the Nurtures of society, not used for the Male Supremacy that this world promotes.
Sadly, he is not in heaven with God.
Watch America suddenly go into a new age of purity
The good ones always die too young.
He died with a stiffy
Can anyone from these sick twisted comments politely explain to me how is this man an example or anyone's missed one? what is his legacy he left to YOU? HOW IN ANY WAY HE HAS SHOWED ANY GOOD THING TO THIS WORLD ?
I guess the bunnies aren't going to be playing Hop on Pop anymore.
I don't believe he was a nice guy
What a life! He boinked the hottest women on the world all his life and became rich doing so. He continued this until he was 91! Awesome! RIP.
no matter how many women and how much money he had, he finally died.
Life is like you dip the tip of your finger in a cup of water and take it out,  all the money, all the girls, all his property, left behind, now he's in darkness alone he took nothing with him, except his deeds. Life is short, lets work for the after life instead.
How many young men would look at his magazine and have unrealistic expectations for a woman especially after child birth. The world is a better place with him dead
Life is just vanity and chasing after wind. But to lie that he was not into it for the money is untrue. May his soul RIP.
This guy is my God \nr.i.p Hef
HIs life was all a lie. He may have had fame and money, but it was all a superficial.
Hef was indeed on his own right a trailblazer breaking the taboos and moraes of American Society.He really set the standard and brought a relax element to Americans men and women alike there is only one Hef.
I can't help but wonder where you spend your eternity and did anyone tell you the sinners prayer in your old age or did they just like you for your money
Let's see what the Word of God has to say about whoremongers like Hugh Hefner:\n\n_For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God._--Ephesians 5:5
Hugh's last words: Jesus, I want to ask for your......  uhhhhhhhh.  \nDon't worry, I hear it's a dry heat down there.  lol
Well if he did make it to heaven.....then all the rest of us are safe when our time comes!
He was a sexual predator,  used his money to control silly young women
Im sure that the devil has a special cell for this animal.....
Some militant feminists and the highly religious may think that Hef doesn't deserve to got to Heaven, But I say he's already been living in Heaven for the last 60 odd years (am I right guys ? nudge nudge wink wink). Still one does have to wonder, is it possible that Heaven may actually be a bit of a let down for Hef, given the life he's been living? LOL & RIP.
NOW!!!   How it all gets divvyed up!  Who gets what?  Lets play the Family Feud!
There is No Rest or peace for the unrepentant sinner. Only a fearful Judgment. God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that everyone believing in Him should not PERISH but have Everlasting life.
Sexist pig! Ugh...
Hey folks, hope you enjoyed the video! It'd mean a lot to me if you guys checked out Tab for a Cause; what they're doing is truly amazing and I've proudly been opening tabs for just over a week now. As a stats nerd it's insane how something as mundane as the new tab page can help raise funds for charities across the world. Go download it here: http://tabforacause.org/businesscasual
Are you fine with the shitposter... I mean..... The editor putting Felix the trap in your videos
Do The Walt Disney Company!
When you can have registered lobbyists in a parliament/senate then it really shows that the democratic process is fucked up in a country....
Do Kodak next
Umm...... why was Felix the trap-o-cat hiding behind that stack of cash.....
Now AT&T likes to fuck us in the ass
AMD next! I've really been enjoying the videos lately.
Great video, and a sponsor I can get behind. Thanks!
I still love Business Casual, I'm pissed at YouTube for not giving me the notifcation though :P
What about Cingular?
Some notes on the weakened AT&T ... it was much larger and more profitable than the baby bells.  It ran 80% of the Internet.  It still had bell labs for its entire run.  I would trace its demise to the MCI worldcom multi-year illegality of stating false profits which real companies could not compete with.  Also a failure for the federal government to enforce the telecommunications completion act.  In the end the Internet bubble busted and the most unimaginative and backward baby bell, SBC, had the cash on hand to buy the name and what was left.
So... the US govt destroyed a company once, and now they're helping companies (such as; Google, Boeing, JP Morgan, etc) with tax payers money? I wonder....
Best girl is at it again. What does Felix say at 5:30?
Did tab for a cause pay you? Because if they did it means they’re not using 100% of the money I give for charity... they use that to advertiser (such as paying you) and maybe who knows? If they do that, they might also pocket some money
If it's free you're the product.
ATnT- America's Tits n Testicles
These videos are so good. Well versed, brilliantly created, punctuated with pure intelligence. THIS is what YouTube needs.. NOT Jerk Porl.
Fascinating learning the history of this huge businesses. To see their strategic plays over the years is interesting to see how they are still relevant today. Great videos!
Satellite internet my peeps; thats where I believe AT&T is and always planned to be heading towards with the aquisition of DTV. Another great video @BusinessCasualYT. Nostradomus out.
AT&T acquiring Time Warner will not make them a larger broadband provider as that portion of the business was already sold off to Charter.  They would only be acquiring the media portion of Time Warner.
can you do playboy? in honour of the late great Hugh <3
Phillipp Reis
Do NVIDIA next!
Funny how the government complains about monopolies but protects The US Postal Service
i'm a little surprised that you didn't mention Cingular.
Amazing video as always! Do SpaceX or OpenAI next!
I just realized I watched a slideshow.
Is it laggy for everyone?
Hey wait, thats not an answering machine at 7:00, its a wire recorder.
Wait... So AT&T is actually rebranded SDC and it sold most of its assets but remained in the network industry and made a huge chunk money, right?
That felix cameo though
still less than comsuk
I SMELL FAKE NEWS: How the Americans like to believe Bell invented the phone.. he stole the idea of Reis by requesting his research from the university.
9:21 I thought Sprint bought Nextel and Verizon bought Alltel?
I hate at and t
5:34 this is WW1 no ?
2:21 gotcha!
Help me Expand my hidden Felix collection:\n2:20 Felix behind the Stack of cash.\n5:29 Felix behind the crew to the left calling Big Bang Theory a terrible show.\n10:15 Felix on the center podium.
At 8:40.  A Sikh, in 1952, UK based physicist Narinder Singh Kapany invented the first actual fiber optical cable.

Time Warner was formed when Time inc merge with Warner communication. Then they merged with Aol and mad Aol Time Warner but then they spun off Aol in 2009 They used to own Warner Music, Group,Warner Books,Time Warner Cable,Aol and Time inc
You should do a video on Compaq Computers
Do one on Carlos Slim and Claro!
AT&T built it but was bought out by Southwestern Bell Communications. Who knew.
Thanks for the video, you deserve 1M subs. This could be a show on the History Channel.
You're infringing on my copyright pay-tint!
My grandmother worked for Bell South.
Please make a video about Playboy!
you forgot to talk about cingular
Isn;t TimeWarner owned by Charter now?
Soooooo that is what AT&T stands for O:!!!!
Tab for a Cause donates every time I open a new tab? I could bring Puerto Rico back on it's feet just from when I browse porn.
Great work! I learned a lot!
8:15 _Liar!_\nWe all know that was intended.
Would love for you to have incorporated the AT&T copper mines in Chile and the Kissinger memo urging for US intervention.
You are awesome Business Casual!! Loved this video :) Could you make one video about TV broadcast companies like Cable TV/Dish TV etc?
I'm going to see this again I didn't catch it all, at all.
i just found your channel I love it already
Thumbed up regardless of my views.
I like your videos. You're cool.
By the way, Antonio Meucci is the real inventor! the others stole it.
OH MY GOD FELIX AT 10:16
What about Virgin? Planes, trains, mobiles and megastores...
I hate at&t
What about Cingular
Did J.P. Morgan just invest in or buy anything he could?
I also live in Orlando, Florida & I have Fiber Internet provides by AT&T for a good price. But here they do have to compete with Spectrum Cable as well.
Ayy fuck Americans we don't have any of these
technically bell canada is the real company behind the phone since it is the only division left of the original bell
Apart from the third party operators out there, one familiar to those my age is GTE (General Telephone), whose service differed greatly from Bell/AT&T as they had to have their own phones and wires.  Don't forget before 1984, Bell was the only company to manufacture their own phones that customers could only pay to have installed in their homes.  You just don't go out and buy an extra phone as it didn't work that way.  That all changed after the breakup and we started to see a lot of cheaply-produced phones out on the market.  Bell System phones (made by Western Electric) were heavy and practically unbreakable like tanks. \n\nGetting back to GTE, they mostly serviced specific areas Bell wasn't it, usually rural/suburban.  My grandma had GTE where she was and I can remember the odd noise the dialer made and the rings itself.  I'm sure this all had to do with those  specific patents AT&T had.\n\nIt should be noted, outside of DirecTV, AT&T also has it's own broadband service including DSL and a cable TV service called U-Verse in a number of markets they do operate landline phone service in (like the former Ohio Bell in my state).
10:16 Traps will not divide us...
I might start using his tab for a cause, I have between 80 and almost 200 tabs opened. And once I check them all I'll end up opening more anyway.
Invented the telephone\nAlexander Graham Bell
Dude Im I'm class.\n\n\nScrew class im watching this
I'm enjoying the hidden felix's
That Russian accent though.
It's like that returd, larry page, and his bullshat google fiber. It was DOA. comcraps and the rest own the internet and will not let you join, and fiber costs a fkload to lay and is impractical except for BUSINESS use, like internet2 at 100Gb/s.
I think you guys made a mistake at the end... AT&T is indeed trying to buy Time Warner, the entertainment company, but not Time Warner Cable, so them acquiring Time Warner has nothing to do with broadband or internet.
5:29.  No way, anime girl.  This show isn't stupid at all
Can You Do Nickelodeon Or Cartoon Network?
This video naturally overlooks a lot of history in order to keep the video relatively short.  For example, people often claim that landline phone service was a natural monopoly, because how efficient would it have been to run multiple, competing phone lines?  While that certainly pointed to a difficulty early phone companies had, it doesn't really make it a natural monopoly,  Instead, the companies were working out agreements to share the phone lines, so that multiple lines weren't necessary.  Bell Telephone, however, successfully argued the natural monopoly argument to local legislators, and got them to grant local monopolies to phone companies, and Bell, being the biggest phone company at the time, was well-positioned to receive most of those government-granted monopolies.\n\nAnd, in fact, national telecommunications in the U.S. was nationalized, if only briefly:\n\nIn 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid duplication. The claim was that telephone service was a natural monopoly, meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T\n\nThe history of phone service in the U.S. would have been very different if government intervention hadn't occurred.
lazy animations...unsubscribed.

Mykie: The NightQueen
Millonarios 💙⚽
Larry has to be the most focused drumer in rock and roll.  No showboating or headbanging, his playing speaks for itself.
I didn't like the song first time I heard it, but it's grown on me and now I sing it in the shower, I sing it in the car....you're the best thing about me!
The best song. I am be fond of U2. This song reminde lot of others. It is my opinion.
the BEST EVER, i'v been to all concerts in Vancouver, B.C.
When does Van Damme become a drummer???
Get the fuck out of New York while you still can!!! If you didn't get the message you are blind!
Opps got a bit political in the end!
Adam Clayton walking in NYC looks like Anthony Bourdain on one of his food travel shows in this video. : )
classic..☺
Thank for thes great song. U2
Excellent shots of the Big Apple, Lady Liberty, and the Freedom Tower!!!!
I love these guys...!!!\n💕 God bless U2 💕
They're still ALIVE!!! Even Bono is there! I really thought him dead! But where's the hat?
The Edge, what a voice!!
1:53 best part of the video. Millonarios Shield!   )oo/M(   💙🇨🇴
Bono Has bad hair transplant. looks likechucky hair .\n\n\nby the way good song
I love Your smile in this video. I LOVE THIS SONG!I LOVE U2! I'm fan for 20 years and this song is great. Come to Poland, please! I miss You!
Bono sounds more like a girl with every new song. Weird.
I was worried before watching this. What if they will now try to sound like the sellouts in the charts? But they didn't, they still sing what they feel. What I like the most is that they actually changed while still keeping the spirit. After all, I have heard 100 traditional u2 songs, it's time for something different! Keep it up, I like it that way!!! :)))
Could anybody transcript the speech in the end of the video... My English is not strong enough... I can only hear the separate words... (
I didn't really like this song until now I understand it... Can't wait any longer for a new album!!!
Only true fans will enjoy this, i'm included. Love this song.
*U2 - You’re The Best Thing About Me*
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Why USA flag? You are Irish
Adam Clayton ❤🙌🙌 The BEST
Great to see the lads from liverpool at it again!!

Shocking song! Didn't buy the last album doubt Il buy this one!
Yes, I am a fallen angel.. This is my highway to hell death sentence prison i fell into.. I deserve the lake of fire.. I am a prodigal son.. i preexisted my upside down flesh snake skin birth.. my free will was in heaven my home i fell from.. I followed Lucifer here for prostitution and riotous living..By Grace through faith in Jesus Christ I am converted turned upside down again reconciled pardoned adopted and going back home to heaven.. I await the redemption of my body ... relationship not religion .. Lucifer runs all governments and religions.. NYC is about to die
Give me whatever vitamins Larry Mullen Jr is taking.
How is U2 a thing
Have they forgotten they're Irish?
I really don't like this video. I get it, on the face of it. But I don't like it. And for all the charms, in particular from Bono...I don't get the charms.\nThe song I'm not sure about. Songs Of Innocence is great cuz it couldn't not be, but it's also near the bottom of the canon. I hope this album doesn't follow that direction, because waiting years for a U2 album means I should get something in the top 5.
Who knows where the bar and the Harley Quinn looking bartender is? That looks like my kind of joint!
Looks like predictive programming about the NEO 9-11 in Babylon the Great > the complete destruction of NYC under an upcoming full moon...  U2 saying goodbye and walking away b4 the illuminated event?  In your face!
U2 makes music for McDonald's commercials now?
U2 are one of the best rock band ever, but I think this song is not that good.
Zzzzzzzzzz. Boring. Stale. Ha ha ha ha.
bunk
Great song, terrible video
What an annoyingly unwatchable video!!!
Terrible.
I feel it lacks the energy of erstwhile U2, but I guess they're getting old... They should've made a more aggressive bass rhythm, Adam was severely under represented in the track...
I'm digging the song. But honestly,  that video sucked.
I love this song but why does Larry look so miserable all the time? :-(
This sounds very safe,almost lazy b-side standard .Have U2 lost their sparkle?
Wait, so this is the second official video for this song? Damn he must love this song so much :/

weird video ... you have to explain it to me. really!
Why on the earth two videos for a song?
#1 James Blunt 👍 from Armenia))))))✌
Love James since elementary school. His voice and music are both great.
Love this video, which tells a deeper story, and it is so so tragic.    😭😭😭\n\nJames Blunt is a pure artist.  Every song is genuine and from the heart.
Philippines  🇵🇭 fans
So are there 2 official videos?
I loooove this song....not all songs, James is the best
Love it -  I love your music Mr Blunt <3
your voice is so amazing
any filipinos listening or am i the only one? (:
The lyrics though... they speak to me!! ❤
I'm confused why does the song has tow videos!!
For a moment there i though that this was the preview story of if time is all i have, amazing video <3 last part gave me chills
I was thinking dis' video could be more... dramatic// I mean, 4 da' lyrics, but good job 4 a very great song // this song remember me my situation: I love it but... I hate it
Elisangela, \nSul real, '?
The little girl is my cousin
Amazing video, the best. I was surprised and I was moved because by that james blunt is the best
This song is the only good in this album. Sorry James, but your last album is so different.
We still got some good Singers
Wow, James Blunt you’re so amazing and hopefully someone will do Remix soon could be great
I can't say no to you, James.
Hope is the worst motherfucker out of Pandora's can.
This is FANTASTIC, Blunty. There’s a reason why this is one of my favorite songs on The Afterlove.
God bless your voice man!  love your songs!
TURKEY <3
I think I'd like to listen to his voice for the whole of my life ❤️
OmgI swear that I've cried. Stop to kill yourself in your videos!!
Who else was amazed by the aestehtic and got aboslutely shocked at the and when the car crash happens? goddamn now I'm crying.
I've been learning how to sing most all your music perfectly but this song with the auto tune now I cant =/
why is there a second official video? \nStill, James Blunt is Life!
Nepalese Fan ever...
Great song. My favorite. James is the best.
Video gave me a whole new perspective at the song.
love the song! love from Kazakhstan
my favourite song in The After love
please come to Ecuador again >:(
Que musica ruim :(  que pena. James Blunt é top. Mas essa musica é ruim
Please make a video for Paradise
*Before my 100th birthday,* I need to find me some me-time to go and see him in concert.\n-\n*There is just no one like him!*  (I love James Blunt!)
Another Masterpiece from this Legend!
From Small Country Called Bangladesh.... We Love James Blunt.
Now actually, this is a real good number!
Oh Come On, James! Playing the death card again? I like you anyway. Love from Buenos Aires.
Esse vídeo combinou mais com a letra !!!
Linda música! Como todas de sua brilhante carreira, esta toca de forma profunda ao coração por falar de um amor impossível nesta vida. Nos emociona demais . geny Martins.

Don't put funny in the title
Can someone follow me JUST FOR LUCK BEFORE MY DATE with gf
next time for referee, just give the ball to him instead he get the ball by himself xD
It is a mental game, he is getting in the head of the other team
He just wants to get some camera time...BVB really should look into upgrading in his position though.
Eigentlich macht er genau das, was Manuel neuer schon immer macht. Sollte vlt lieber stattdessen mal aufs kurze Eck achten, anstatt andere zu imitieren.
Ich bin zwar eingefleischter ❤️Bayern❤️ Fan aber das Ritual und Video ist echt Mega... ist mir auch noch nie aufgefallen und macht Bürki gleich viel sympathischer. Daher gerne ein Daumen hoch für Bürki und das Video... 👍🏼 Geil auch, wie Spieler und Schiris ihm dem Ball teilweise schon völlig selbstverständlich zukommen lassen, nach dem Motto. Gebt ihm den Ball...⚽️
Song name?

Das macht neuer auch immer
Ich sehs schon in den komentaren das ich so gehatet werde aber ich bin bayern fan und ein wenig schalke fan😁😁 ,#fcbforever
Ein Ritual hat doch jeder. Ich kratze mir morgens erstmal die Eier.
Was für ein Depp! Wie wärs mit einem Ritual nach jedem Stuhlgang die Toilletenrolle als Andenken an die Wand tapezieren
das hat wer von neuer geklaut... nixwisser...
Da werde ich in Zukunft mal drauf achten.\nAm besten finde ich das bei 0:30 :D
Neuer macht das vor jedem Spiel genau wie Fährmann es auch vorher so gemacht hat bevor er Kapitän wurde.
es un completo crack jajaja
ICH SAG NUR KURZE ECKE
Der soll mal lieber seine kurze Ecke zu machen
Ist alle schüsse am kurzen eck reinlassen auch ein ritual von ihm?
Bürki ist Top und passt perfekt zu BvB
Vor einem Dortmund Video Bayer Werbung ?!? Nice!!!
Haha was macht der jung:)
Nur das das Neuer schon gemacht hat bevor Bürki schon bei Dortmund gespielt hat
Das beste ist bei 0:32😂😂😂😂
Schon aufgefallen,aber gibt es eigentlich einen Grund?😂
Richtig lustig. Habe mich vor lachen weg geschmissen.
Bin zwar Bayern Fan,aber finde das Bürki ein guter,erfahrender und Sympathischer Typ ist 😂💪🏼
Ach man der roman
Bringt ihm ja nicht sonderlich viel, wenn er die letzten Spiele fast jeden Ball der auf die Torwartecke geht nicht halten konnte
Und hält trotzdem nichts
Bin ich der einzigste der das gerade zum erstenmal mitbekommt ? 😂
Please make a how I make my Persian rice video 😭
Not a bad life, Amelia.  Not bad at all!
I love how she did your brows.
Currently going through a tough time and not having the best week, but your good vibes literally radiated through this video and made me smile. Thank you ❤️😊
I think your father is a bit late on that DNA test haha
In the beginning Amelia reminds me of Robin Williams in Mrs.Doubtfire when she dips her face in the soup and its drooping off of her face so she wont blow her cover 😂😂
I like the eyeliner she did on you !! It’s not so thick , and it flatters you eye shape . 🤗
sorry for being nosey but why are you all taking a dna test? i could really feel your positive vibes haha loved it x
The RICE😍😍😍
Lol at 7:13-7:15 the guys in the background
Pretty pink flowers speak to me too Amelia, I completely understand haha
Congrats Amelia, I am so happy for you! 4 years ago I bought my first pillowtalk lip liner after your recommendation and I loved it! Since then I have repurchased over and over again! I recently bought the very victoria & pillowtalk lipstick and I fell in love with her matte formulas! Same happened with her light wonder foundation, sooooo good and natural looking! Every product I have tried from her makeup and skincare line in full size or in a sample version, I ended up  loving it and buying it! She does her best and deserves all the praise for that! I wish there were more people so passionate and dedicated to their job like her! By the way, I watched the entire video you did with her and you were adorable! You deserve all this success Amelia!
I love the Dior tour🙋
Pretty pink peonies def speaks to me too 😂
OMG you always look so glamorous! I literally just walked my dog in unicorn onesie pajamas LOLOL <3 xx
No disrespect to Ms. Tibury but I prefer the way you do your makeup. :) You really know how to transform your already gorgeous face!
11:02 Duke, the Gremlin haha <3
i love j adore sooo much...i have 3 perfums ,,,jadore is wonderful
The whole time you were talking in that face mask I was laughing so hard. You're hilarious, lady! 😂
I LOOOOVEE so much your vlogs !!!\nyou inspire me to do some too\nlike a parisian version lol
When you told about the Dior house, i thought woow Amilia has such a pretty voice!! \nAnd who's your dutch friend?
I saw Fanny in the blogggg <333333 love herrr omg she's slaying and she didn't even know she was on camera 17:20
Such an amazing trip with Dior! Everything looked so beautiful!
Really loving your vlogs lately xx
Love how excited you were prior to meeting Charlotte! Beautiful outfits as always ☺️ Xx
Such a special month!!! ☺️🙌🏼🙌🏼⭐️ everything was beautiful!!!
Duke waiting for that treat though!!!!! lol if he were my dog and was that cute, he would be fat on treats
❤️❤️❤️
I just love watching your videos... you are so full of life..😍
Thank you for sharing so much about the Dior trip-so lovely and amazing. And your 👗 was so so pretty
what lipstick is this? i love
I feel like for every time I've had my hair done you've had yours redone about 5 times 😫 haha x
The face mask thou hahahahahahha :D
the design of house is timeless
U r such a darling love u so much. I feel lots of positivity from just watching u alone. And I recommended ur channel to many of my friends I knew. Lots of love from Singapore 😘👱🏻‍♀️❤️
What are konkers (sp)?
What is the name of that type of rice? The mum-made rice, its the same type of rice Amelia has made in other videos! What is it called? I really want to try making it... it looks so good!
17:19 Fanny Bourdette in the background 💜
Your awesome ❤️
Love this!
The  fields 😍
The dress you wore to the dinner was so pretty. Just perfect for the occasion. I love Jasmine. My niece wore a Jasmine headdress in her wedding in India and it was beautiful.
Karaoke in the car! Fun times!!
In my opinion you do better your makeup because of the way she applied the eyeshadows. The eyeliner she did look strange on you and there was too much transición shadow
That Dior mascara was wow!  J'adore is one of my favorite fragrances.  I can't wait to get a whiff of the new one.
Ahhh you are good for the soul Amelia😊
Amelia I couldn't stop laughing by the end of it with your face mask 🤣 by the way you looked so pretty when CB did your makeup! The foundation/ contouring looked amazing as well . You always look gorgeous anyway. Loved the video ❤️
The more you talked the more that face mask deteriorated 🤣
Loved your vlog 😍😍 What nail polish are you wearing? Lots of love ❤️
I prefer the way you do your own make up. You are gifted at elevating subtlety, be it with color, style, jewelry, outfits, etc....you don't need experts---you are gifted, and you need not be intimidated by othersd, Amelia. You are elegant, refined, kind, loyal, and I wish you lots of joy and blessings.❤️
I was just laughing my a** off seeing you with the face mask on! So funny 😂
Duke is the most adorable puppy I've ever seen! What breed is he?
Wow, what a video, you seem to have a charmed life this month. You look and sound amazing, really enjoyed this video.
What’s conker? Chestnut?
apparently they dont test on animals but arnt vegan?
Giiir what are your glasses when you were driving from?????? ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What's the name of the blusher Charlotte used on you, it looked great!
Amelia you are so lovely!! But the yellow sunglasses are just well, NO :D :D
Girl the dior chateau was a dream 😁
Amelia you look amazing darling!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘Charlotte is just such a sweetheart I'm sure you where on cloud9 best wishes from Ireland 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I love that black Chanel at the salon you had. Updated bag collection please?
I feel so happy to see that you are happy Amelia!
19 kilos is nothing - that suitcase weighs like 18 on its own!  So beautiful, but so heavy. I bought the (not as pretty) lightweight version because I could barely pick that one up 😂
You looked SO pretty in that but dress at Dior....<3
This was such a good video. It's always a treat to see Duke & Dior's house is fantastic. Thanks
Dior's house looked divine! What an adventure <3
LMAO at your face mask at the beginning! every time you jump cut, it just keeps sagging lower and lower. Legit burst out laughing at 2:33 xoxo
Love Charlotte! can you please post the link to the coat you are wearing whilst walking Duke? the one above isn't working. Thanks
What's a conca?? A chestnut???
You make me feel so energetic . You are always cheerful
Okay love your hair color 10x more now. I liked it before but now...it's perfect!
If she is Charlotte  u r Amelia  u r really  one of best  make  up  bloggers  🙂
just curious as to what you do when  there is food at an event. do you tell them your restrictions or just eat some if it?
I don't know what happened with youtube but your video was not in my subscription box. Am I the only one?
the bit where you're talking about conkers with that mask on was so funny because you looked so crazy lololol
I love your earrings Amelia! Where did you get them?
The tour of Dior's home was magnificent! Thank you so much for sharing that beauty with us! I'll have to go back and pause it to really study the rooms. So much to see in a split second!
omega i love your chanel!!! is it a recent purchase? xxx
I love love the highlighter on you. It's making me want to buy it
Such an honor having Charlotte Tilbury do your makeup! You look fabu!
You singing along to Taylor swift in the car is literally me driving home tonight
I think thats the first time Amelia has ever sworn in a video and I had to do a double take on that! Great video!
You talking with that face mask on, had me howling!! 😂
Wait what is a conker??
damn it amelia!! i fricken love you.. i wish i lived in the UK so i could meet you. i live in Canada (shoutout to Estee) so not possible. but anyways ill just continue to lol and talk to myself as I'm watching your videos. xx <3 <3
You're so sweet
Why always some judging people are here? They always tell her wht to do about her fashion lens makeup and even life! They should know they bother Amelia and some peop who enjoy her vids.
You're living a fairytale right now. So happy for you I hope it lasts forever. \nLiterally goals ❤❤
So exciting, thank you for sharing. PLEASE can you share your 23andme DNA results? The results are always so interesting! xx
I 100% only started driving for the singing in the car!
This is what living your dream looks like💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
The food looked amazing! please can you share the salad & rice recipes?
That ghemeh bodamjoon looked pretty good though! If that's how you spell it 😂😂
An hour late for an engagement party! The Persian in you is showing!
wtf is a conker..... british ppl are crazy
The print is really terrible. Basic is a compliment
Hello! Lovely video! \nWhere is your peony wall picture from? Thanks x
Where is the gorgeous picture/poster of the pink peonies from? \nLove it 😍😍😍
Ooooh!  I was like, conkers?  What the f is a conker?  So I looked it up & learned something new about horse chestnut seeds & a game in Britain!  (I'm from 'merica.)  The more you know!....✨🌈
Hi Amelia.\nJust want to let you know dr Josh axe's youtube video was talking about how to get rid of SIBO naturally.\nIf you never seen it maybe you can take a look. \nHope you will get well soon!\n\nBest wishes
I really like that this video wasn't just about buying loads of new stuff 🙌
Love when you break down trends!!! 👍🏼👍🏼 yay 😊
Inasmuch as I love this style of video, I'll always have a soft spot for your old LookBook style videos shot in your house. I still go back to those when I'm in a style rut!
I love red, so that is a trend I am looking forward to. And I like the print you showed, will need to check out some thrift shops.
Love your fashion videos Sam!!!
The curly hair suits you so well! I love it
Amazing Samantha! For advice on relationship, friendships and more - check us out! :)
I loved this video so much Sammi! it was so nice to hear you suggest that you could get a prince of wales check blazer from a charity shop and that you can pair items we already have for the oversize jumper over skirt trend! ☺️💕 I know it's common sense that you don't need to buy new stuff all the time to be on trend, but it's always nice to have sustainable shopping suggested from a blogger! all the outfits were lovely as always xx
Aaaah love the colder seasons fashion so much! Great video Sammi :))
I always like your videos even though I can't wear anything you style because I live on an island. 😭
I like these kinds of videos. If you like this you should also check out KarenBritChick. She does these kinds of fashion style videos all the time.
I’ve been following you for so many years and it’s amazing to see how much you’ve grown 💖💖 love you sam
Love everything apart from the kitten heels, im never going to be able to jump on that fashion train! x
I love the mirror selfies!
For the instagram: I like a mix of both. Everything doesn't have to be perfect
Hey not one to comment but I love the mirror pics and selfies, I think your casual but chic posts set you apart from all the overly polished content online, plus those type of posts make it a bit easier for me to imagine how I could actually wear such looks in day to day to life. Just love seeing the looks you put together really, so keep doing what you're doing and whatever you enjoy the most ❤️❤️
I love your fashion videos!!
Love this video! More please! ♡
Also, just watching old vids and realized how much I miss the kaleidoscope intro!
I love your fashion videos! they're always super helpful!
I remember watching you when you wore your Docs and chunky shoes. Bring em back! =) Love watching your videos as alway, Sam. You brighten my day.
This earrings suits you soo much Sam! I 'm waiting for some ootd videos! xx
I prefer mirror pictures because they are more accessible and I feel like I could relate to that style of picture more.
Sammi I love your style! You're so good at putting outfits together that flow really well!
Right before you said it I was thinking those trousers would look good with a red jumper 😂  I've also seen a lot of extremely pointy boots out and about but they look kind of clown-ish to me 🤷‍♀️
I love how down to earth you are! Professional pics are neat, but mirror pics are definitely more relatable and are still great!
Definetly the mirror selfies, they just have this effortless and casual feel to them. Whereas the more professional shots are a little more clean cut. \nDoes that make sense? Lmao. \nBoth are stunning though!
You should release a red jumper with Novem & Knight!!!!
Girl first of all this was amazing, you are amazing! I love your videos to the moon and back, truly! And to answer your question I actually like the mirror pics more than the professional shots (although those are marvelous too) as I feel like they're a bit more charming and relatable. So much love to you and your lovely family! xxx
ive been a subscriber since ur doc martens days omg!! time flies!!!!
You look so stunning in this video!
I just want to go out buy so much more clothes than what I was already thinking about! Love this video!
What i love about your fashion videos is that it inspires me to be braver with my own personal style. Now i'll actually take the plunge and wear something i like even if it's a bit out there and it's a great feeeling  xx
Love love love your fashion videos ! And i dont mind both for your outfit photos. Love checking out your instagram stories about your outfit and Indie as well ❤️
I really like your hairstyle like that ☺️
Loved all the pieces but the sequins blazer was my favorite😍
I've just seen that Zara has a quilted scarf. That might be a way to get the puffy bomber look without being overwhelming. #teampetite
I've just bought an oversized grey/brown check blazer and i love it but have no idea how to style it! any suggestions?
I like this kinda neutral sage green or slate blue color on stove pipe dress slacks. The pants are kinda high waisted with deeper pockets and are worn with a rugged boot. I kinda like the professional Instagram photos.
I love your style, you are and have been for years an inspiration to me <3\nI prefer more laid back insta pictures! They are so much more authentic :)
where is that lovely red floral tea dress from ? x
WHAT LIPSTICK IS THAT?! You're always, always, always SO gorgeous
Love videos like this!
I think Polka Dots are also a thing this season !!! I see them every where & instead of red , maroon jumpers is a huge trend !!! Goes go well with the checkers x planning to do something like this on my blog soon !
I think a variety is good, but I prefer selfie, mirror pictures. It's nice to see more selfies and mirror pictures just to remember that you are just a normal person like your followers. A lot of fashion YouTubers are leaning more towards the professional side of things and sometimes it's nice to be able to relate to you on some level, if that makes sense!
This is awesome video. Great creation\nif you want to like this just come to My channel and subscribe my channel.\nhttps://youtu.be/fz9cEb_6fl4\nCreate a good comment and like my video\nhttps://youtu.be/qk-ekQuK2Gk
The check print is called Glen plaid (which is short for Glen Urquhart plaid) or Glenurquhart check
I love these videos Sammi!! And I love how excited you are, it makes me so excited to shop too - you're so bad for my bank balance! xx
I like seeing both for sure but more mirror pics!
I like both! Sometimes I like to see something really pro and full of effort, but sometimes it's nice to just see a regular person taking a regular photo in front of a mirror! (Possibly stuck all the crap things in the room to where you can't see in the pic.)\nLove you!!
The red jumper and skirts with oversized sweaters are my favourites! 😍 Love it. \nAnd I'm loving your lipstick, your hair and your shirt in this video. 😍😍 You always look so good! \nLoved the video 💕
The kitten heel... it's a no from me 🙈
Loving these videos on upcoming trends and how to incorporate them!
Love love loved this! I feel so inspired now thank you! x
This is your best makeup look! 💄
love the format of you vids sami
This filming background is SO nice 😍
Sammi you'll love this site for all these trends! https://imaginebykim.nl/collections/newin
You're makeup looks amazing in this video! That lip is everything!
No disrespect but other than the 40s blue and the red autumnal boots most of the other pieces reminds me of the story ‘the emperors new clothes’, kinda.
I would LOVE to have this grey jumper!!! I even wanted it last year.. but shipping to germany and from pounds to euro is just toooo expensive for just one jumper.. I wait till payday or you post a coupon code :D:D
very good video! so put together and insipring! thank You! so professional, Sammy!
hi where is your gold lamp from?! :)
Love this! I'm pregnant with twins and seriously don't know how I'm going to find anything in trend for my growing body, knowing colours and patterns will really help! Also I love your selfie posts 📸 xx
I like a combination of professional photos and selfies! They both show something different :)
Im not into any of those trends. Except red bc it's my favourite colour. But i dont get the trend of the biiiig jackets/coats and wide shoulders. And shiny clothing ugh \nTbh i personally think it's not important to follow trends. It's better to build a solid wardrobe and then maybe buy a few pieces here and there and personalise everything
Try reserved for a red jumper! They have the nicest roll neck xxxx
Are those bomber jackets? Most of the pictures you showed are puffa jackets
Where is that red flower dress from @ 8:27?  I can't find it in the discription box :(
👍🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧💞💕💞💕💞💕💞💤💤💤💤💤💤🌐 you have beautiful hand Sammy I got interrupted the first time I washed your blog great blog as usual Kansas City Missouri
I love the look of your N&K jumper but it doesn’t say what it’s made of......could you let me know? X
Love that red is in! This was a really helpful run down, loved it 💗🍂
Hey Samantha, if you're worried about the oversized bomber trend not suiting your short frame (same tbh) Ariana Grande has been known to wear them from time to time and she is next level tiny! You may have already seen it since it's a little old now but check out her music video for Everyday for some inspo. Not a plug but shorties like us can definitely pull off all the trends too!
always enjoy your fashion videos :) I like both types of instagram pics - I think it's good to have some of both as it keeps it looking sophisticated but real
Hi Sam, personally I like a mix of professional shots and mirror pics, but I also like whatever gets us more outfit pictures!
I bought a bright red scarf yesterday and I am in love! Such a good way to get a bit of colour for someone who's scared of deviating from monochrome!
the puffy bomber is one of my favourite wardrobe pieces cause it instantly makes your outfit trendy
Loving statement earrings on you! You look great in this video.
You look gorgeous!! Where is your necklace from?
Hi Sammy! You're looking gorgeous! I loved the video but I think you shoud have mentioned the vinyl trend and showned your H&M skirt, I have one too and I'm in love with it :D!! Love from Portugal XXx
Loooooove the earrings Sammi!
Reds & sequins not for me👎
I love you!
Mirror pics!! <3
Selfie pics for sure 😊
Your just delightful to watch ❤
LOVEEEEE THESEEEE VIDEOSSSSSS
The shirt, the hair-do, the red lip- just GORGEOUS!
You're glowing!
I smell karenbritchick !!!
Selfie outfit pictures <3
definitely prefer your mirror / selfie outfit shots :)
Casual mirror pics
Piece piece piece piece piece cool  piece piece
LOVVVEEEE your style!!❤️
You looking nice ❤️
Always my no.1 fashion guru! X
Does anyone really just wear what's in 'fashion'? Personally i don't care if something is or trend or not. I wear what i like and feel comfy in. Docs literally never go out of style. I had my first pair aged 8 and am now 34. I have 3 pairs and they're practically all I wear. Screw fashion. Wear whatever you want.
I love these type of videos! 💕
I don't know what it is about this video, but I LOVED it ❤️ I feel like you're the one fashion YouTuber I watch who is so passionate when you talk about fashion - such a joy to watch!
I'm crying like i just watched Titanic for the first time.
My heart was so filled and happy to see you reach your goals and I hope you're so proud of yourself because you made it girl, you made it.
This was the most sincerest 1mill thank you video that's ever been created! You truly deserve all the most wonderful things in the world, honey!!! I'm so happy for you! I've been here since you had 1k! Much love and respect, From Mel in Michigan! 🤗💗🎉🎊👏🏼🎂🌈🙀
The screenshot mood board made me cry 😭
my girlfriend suggested I watch this video because she really just adores you, so I did. I almost cried towards the end thats all I have to say I'm not going to lie. BUT..... I'm also a huge fan of quotes and that one just made it to my top 3. So, when you are making your custom necklaces or whatever DONT FORGET ABOUT THE MEN or just make me a leather bracelet or something because i think I'm going to live by that quote now it really touched me.
AH!  We love you Amber. congratulations. 💞💞💞
Tell me why i felt so motivated after this video lol and why I cried like the whole time 😂 so happy for your success!! You’re one of my favorites never stop being you 💞
this made me so happy

tbh Ella seemed more into nick kroll than the dudes on tinder
I love these so much!! More Tinder Takeovers!!!
boris said he's getting too old and the word fuckboi in the same sentence
After seeing the Eric Andre one these all suck
I'm in love.
I NEED TO KNOW HOW THINGS WENT WITH BORIS!
PLEASE have Chris D'elia on!! he's too funny and amazing not to use for things like this
Why the fuck is this so entertaining? 😂
I'm laughing so hard. omg this is hysterical
That chortle at 4:10...\nI'd reply to a DM from you, Nick. \nYou're not quite old enough to be my daddy so I can assure you that's at least one awkward moment we won't have.
HOW WAS YOUR LABOR DAY
Only Nicks with a k are allowed. I love the tribute photo to you and John and I would've guessed old ladies as well if it weren't for the tuna.
He's the nicest one they've had on there. Also can't use a phone.
It's based off our names.
Once a week haha what a strange way to describe the kind of physical set you're looking for in a man.
a guy that works out like once a week bitch that person does not exist and if he does he probably has the bmi of seth rogen
Aww, this has been my favorite one of these
LOOL I could watch him mediate people's Tinder profiles for daysssss
All I want to do is find out what the guy would do if he could change the alphabet
Yesssss Nick Kroll is the best
I loved this haha, this should be a show or something with nick as the host
This guy likes the Grateful Dead. STILL hahaha omg I love it
I love his advice at the end basically.... its so very true .... i love Nick Kroll so much, even more now
Her voice and laugh is amazing
9:58 - this guy likes The Grateful Dead. Still   //  Savage.
7:32 my thoughts and prayers to my man Stefan. He never had a chance.
Still waiting for one of these videos with the genders reversed.. Seriously, I can't imagine half of the shit that is said in this video getting a laugh with the genders reversed.
Are they getting hooked up or what? I'm pretty sure he was flirting, and she liked that shit.
Haven't laughed so much in a *long* time
That's the least assholey I've seen Nick Kroll act.
Boris really needs to get over his grammar fetish.
i really wanna see ella and boris go on a date they seem to have a nice sense of humour
Wow you swiped left on the Asian without any comment.
I just realized that I have a crush on Nick Kroll. wow
He was so much more sweet and thoughtful than anyone else.
Bryan, 25. Phish, The Grateful Dead.... First pic is me and the best  mom in the world at a show. We go to a ton of concerts together HAHA, Tinder is fucking full of weirdos
Y'all see that tuna?
It's crazy Ira annnnd the DOUCHE!!
I wanted to see what her friend answered back
What a nice guy Nick is.
😂 nope that's been on my tinder ellaaa.. OH HELLO BE MY FRIEND ELLA
this guy's not funny irl & it's sad because you can tell he tries really hard unlike eric andre
ella is fcking adorable
ffuck you vanity fair
Nick Kroll is a national treasure.
I love these tinder takeover videos!!
Can you imagine if you saw yourself on this video haha
He starts talking about how it's okay to mess up on a text right after he sent one that started with I will I am tall.
whats wrong with liking the grateful dead??
why does his forehead look like a hydraulic press crushed it
the douche?
Hey, I don't have kids . But I'll put one in ya 😂😂💀
I'd pay to see Tinder Takeover with Jeff dunham
Man I haven't laughed this hard in ages!
Did....did he just say Cyrano de Borat? Okay, I'm in love.
His eyes are the most unique color of green. Beautiful
Nick Kroll is a savage.
When u gotta pretend like you've never used tinder
Plot twist, these two should date!!!!
Boris really out here making moves.
Can Nick Kroll date Ella? I think they'd be good together
Boris was a kool dude though. I respect the game
Another reason for me to kms
first mistake, you're using tinder. tinder is for lonely fools that want to stay lonely but get stds too
this made me love nick kroll even more holy fuck
I fucking lost it when his immediate response to that photo was Oh, hello!
Your great Nick Kroll and Ella hope tinder went well
Count how many times she fake laughs
Can we please have a follow up on Borris? I gotta know
Ohhhh you molest dogs
nick + ella <3
Try to get John Mulaney
Nick is my favorite.
She funny too tho
hit me up on tinder Ella
Cyrano de Borat?
KROLL how did you miss saying Bye Bye Birdy 9:48
Excellent
Oh, hello!
Boris FTW! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Oh Hello.
hot new \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiPsTXcakBY
Ella should date Nick
Love this guy!
AMAZING
8:30     did she fart?
THE DOUCHE !!!
Oh hello
I think I love nick kroll.
She cute though.
PLEASE JOHN MULANEY NEXT!!!!
Smashed for sure
Ooh these eyebrows are tough
Oh hello
Taller than a locker
“Ohhhh you molest dogs!”\n(Smiling) “Mmhmm”
douche.
NINOOOOOO
Ruspin hijacks strangers Tinder
If anyone ever asks me what negging is I'll mention Boris
Men are just pain in the arses, so at least wearing their clothes they're good for something that was brilliant 😂😂
How come when I go to primark all I can find is a pair of two different sized shoes and a ugly jumper
that glow!!
Babe you should try on the items so we can see what they look like on you!!! :D <3
That highlight though 🔥
she's obviously never seen pulp fiction
Love all of these. You literally want me to go off sick tomorrow and sneakily run to Primark 💁🏻😂
Random but where did you purchase your sofa? On a hunt for a new one
What about the jewellery ???
How many items did you get 4 200??
Do a try on pretty little thing haul,or in the style,slay some of your range my range favorites😍😍🔥🔥Xx
Why does this girl get so much hate she seems nice enough?
LOVED this vid as I can never find the good stuff in primark (it's like searching for diamonds in A LOT of rough) - gonna head to Primange v soon now!! Can you pleasee do a Zara haul? Think you'd find lots of great stuff, not just casuals but also for going out/clubbing (throw back to the Zara white lace bralette you wore a few years ago or something) xxx
Loveeee your hauls, if you could do ones from like online shops like PLT mssguided etc, that'd be fab, your style is always on point!!
I never ever go in primark, cos the last time I went in was literally like 7 years and it was terrible but now I think it seems to have got so much better!
What I wanna know is have you not watched pulp fiction?! Xxxxx
I wish Primark would do an online site and ship everywhere!
Pointless to do a haul if you're not trying things on 😰
So true about the thongs 😂 think I own every colour! Loved this xx
Wish you had done prices for everything
I need to go to  primark 😭 thank u love
Those court shoes are a major Gianvito Rossi dupe... ☺️👍🏻
court heels!!! comfortable????? I cant last 10 mins!!
Only just found you, like how?? Your literally amazing 😩😩😩
I'm in such a Xmas mood
I got the black bralet today and I'm already thinking of going back for the other colours 😂😂 xxx
I live in Germany and my boyfriend lives in England and he looked in Primark for me to find that gorgeous grey coat and he couldn't find it 💔😭 I love it, it looks so expensive! Maybe when I next go to England they will have it in a different Primark 😊
She looks so much like Imogen 😂
The Pulp Fiction t-shirt doesn't just say Pulp Fiction on it and it has a lady. Pulp Fiction is one of the best Tarantino movies. Highly recommended :)
Get into the video 0.27 seconds and already subscribed💞
I need those burgundy heels & that royal blue handbag! Obsessed 😍
I was in London a week ago, and  of course I went to Primark and buy and buy and buy a lot of clothes, I was so happy in that store.
Can I ask which ring light you use? I really want to get one but I don't know which one to get haha
Are you ok? Like is everything alright at home? 😂 But you're right, those 3 pack underwear sets are so fab
Wish you'd model them as well 😉
Darling,where is this Pink Floyd t shirt from,it looks gorgeous on you
them fluffly shoes are a nightmare 😂 fluff just falls off in tuffs and ends up everyyywere :( 🙈
How much is the red jumper?! ❤️❤️❤️
Please show us how you style these pieces next time!😍
Don't do this to me Sarah
Those 3 sets of underwear are life Sarah. Love that you get them too hahah
Love this, sooo much nice stuff! i need to get to primark asap. The comment about mens clothes made me lol xxxx
Lol I've never spent anywhere near £200 in primark😂Wish I had money
Great haul, i really need to go to primark 😱🙌🏼💕✨
Hi Sarah where is your ring light from? Xxx
Fab pieces from primark Sarah it’s penneys here in Ireland but I am obsessed with those shoes and jumpers 😍😍
£200 is like what most people spend anyway
Love your channel ❤️ it was kinda difficult to see items like the jumpers that you were holding
Whenever I go to primark I never find anything 🤦🏽‍♀️😭
Would you do a video on what you do to stay so slim? I know you've had a bit of a shape up journey and I'm struggling with it a bit at the mo! 💘
Sarah your Pink Floyd tee. .need! Where can I get it? ?
This is sooo good! All that's missing is the prices for a few of them. And the Sarah Ashcroft styling touch..making high street look expensive and cool. I'm going to be trying to find these on your Instagram posts now haha
Beautiful girl and nice Video. Where do you get this amazing Lashes
Omg I love primark and I love your style xxx❤️🔥💕😊
Primark where I live is awful I think I will be travelling to get the good stuff now
How can your love life be non existent you are stunning!
Loved this! I love primark, more branded hauls please 😍🤗👑
I know I’m gonna love this 😋
Love this so much! America NEEDS some primark stores!
I love their Floyd tshirt
Sarah can you do a Romwe clothing Haul? pls xx
What lipgloss are you wearing? It's perfect! 💕 x
Just the intro was so relatable about your highlight that I instantly subscribed 😂😂 love ya dall, you look amaze 😍❣️miss living in uk so much🙁
Pagalvosiu dar nežinau ką acakyti🌹
Pmsl.. Men are just pain in the arses so if i can wear their clothes. Made me laugh too much!!! Xx
The crushed velvet bra would look fantastic with a pair or structured leather look leggings and a blazer
I love this Haul.

Loved your haul! Your makeup look is gorgeous!
Wow amazing haul
TRY ON HAUL PLEASE!!!!
Omg haven’t you ever watched pulp fiction!?! Amazing film - must watch 💕
The smoking lady is Uma Therman 😂 you need too see pulp fiction ASAP
I’m sorry but I really hope you truly like Pink Floyd, otherwise why would you wear that top. Pisses me off when people wear bands Tshirts and don’t even know who the fuck the band are...
Would of made sense to actually try the stuff on. Also what on earth is up with the eyebrows?
Loved the clothes but so distracted how you keep looking down to your right - what's down there? Just curious! Also, slight stuck up vibes about Primark .. you can't tell it's from Primark - the comment about men was hilarious though!
You should do a collab with @imogenation !!!
Looking amazing as always girl!!!😍
What is your accent?
😂😂 if you don't have this underwear are you ok 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would love if anyone could support me! I have a you tube channel and my aim for creating videos is to help people overcome their insecurities! x I have a birthmark on my face and I want to show others to embrace it! xx I hope people can support me :)
I wanna see you in that lingerie

Definitely should of got involved in the beauty section! Gutted you didn't show any finds there. The brushes and make up is as up there as the clothes
Piss of if girls didn't have men the human race would die out because girls wouldn't be able to reproduce you daft prick
AHHHHH😱 I'm literally poor and spend like £500 shopping for clothes and stuff, primark must be cheap af! Heading to Oxford Street this weekend
Men are just pains in the arse's 😂😂
Why the fuck would anyone spend £200 in primark?
Amazing babe ❤ would love to see more haul style videos from you!!
You're actually amazing - totally agree about mens clothing might as well use them for one thing 😏 xo
So size 12 girls are super big and oversized and you're too good for primark.....good message 👌🏻
I love the way you talk\nI love your looks\n....I love you....\nPlease let's get married and have tea everyday ❤️
I can listen to your voice all day 😍 absolutely obsessed 💙🖤❤️
you just gave me what i didn't know i needed 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Jefferee star wishes he was you.
Do an Elizabethan look next time, it would be sooo refined!!
I'd love to see Tron and 1980s futurism  inspiration.. Much love
You will never understand how thrilled I am to have discovered your channel!!
I absolutely adore your videos and I admire the type of content you create because it is more sophisticated than most other videos in the beauty community. Additionally your amazing language is not only enjoyable but enables me to study for my English exam while watching makeup tutorials. Thank you for that.
This was fantastic. Loved it.
I LOVE your content and enjoy watching so so much. You have such a different style compared to other makeup YouTubers that is so refreshing. 💙
I could listen to a audio of your voice without any video and be completely content and happy but the work you did is amazing!!! Idk which side I liked the most.
This is so amazing!
How do you learn to talk like this?? Seriously someone link me a video I MUST adopt this accent it is everything
That’s ART in its purest form . I admire your sophistication . A rare commodity now a days .
I like John, but I hate this character he’s made. Look at his first video to now, this accent is so fake and not necessary
I seriously cannot stop watching your videos. I've never come across someone so skilled at the art of makeup.
Your are so, so talented John. Incredible! 💋
Love it , I would totally wear it to work, reminds me so much of Peter Burns
You bought me BACK to life! I thought I was living....but I was existing!
You are quite an artist! What an amazing look. I'd love to see more looks like this, especially since Halloween is coming up. Amazing video!
You are incredibly quotable, and it is absurd in the loveliest manner possible!
I wish I was able to give your videos a thousand thumbs up. You are, without a doubt, my favorite person on YouTube as of late. 🤗🤗🤗
There are simple makeup artists...and then there are artists who happen to choose makeup for their medium. You are the latter. Positively stunning!
how i did my makeup in high school john i’m waiting
You're a beautiful soul🖤💙
You have an artist's eye! I'm a graphic designer and I'm really enjoying how you use color, gradient and lighting in a way that compliments the curvature of facial features. I always know when I have a great design when I can't stop looking at it. I feel like you've accomplished that feeling with this tutorial. I would really enjoy it if you shared more of these editorial and artistic looks with us. They are very amazing and show us the power of makeup in a way that isn't being portrayed on YouTube.
Oh my God, your channel is growing! I'm so excited for you!
I feel like you're staring into my soul and judging all of my life decisions. Your eyes are such a piercing, icy blue, and you rarely blink. I adore your videos regardless.
That looks is GORGEOUS!!! I love the contrast between the made-up side and the more organic side. I also adore how you teach how to play with the light in our day to day makeup while showing it in this editorial look!! Wonderful!!
5:19 ...victim, which is very fashionable to be, nowadays. Oh my word you are a killer hahahaha.
This isn't makeup this is art
Well I died and went to creative makeup heaven
Hey john I love your YouTube channel and I think that you have awesome makeup videos. There super helpful for me when it comes to putting on my makeup everyday. I was wonder if u would ever be interested in doing like a mukbang eating show or an asmr show? Love you xoxo
More weird looks! This totally made me want to be an alien for Halloween. 😍😍😍
Would anyone eles love to hear him say yassss slayyy queen just me? Ok
Why don't you have more subscribers, you are perfect!
Your voice and accent is so stunning
I'm really not a fan of them. I think they're slightly rancid. I'm cackling with wild abandon here! :'D
5:18 victim which is very in fashion to be in nowadays 😂😂😂
This is gorgeous!! I would just add some bright contact lenses!
“Now I’m going to begin sculpting the face with Illamasquas powder eyeshadow in te shade ‘Victim’... which is very fashionable to be nowadays”\n\nThat shade doe.
I am in love with how sophisticated you speak and your voice, makeup and everything!!
Can you please list products used in your description box in future videos? Please and thank you
All of her videos feels like a master class not just a tutorial.
New Subbie. You're accent is very regal and stunning. You have me hanging on hour every word!
fantastico!!
Listening to you talk and create is my therapy
You're the bob ross of makeup 😊
So beautifully scientific! Amazing! X
I look forward to watching your videos. You are teaching me so many things, makeup and vocabulary
Why does he remind me of morticia?
Incredible look by an amazingly talented artist. More avant garde creations please! Much love :}
I love how the Krylon looks. I would love to see you do a Krylon pale skin foundation video.
If I attempted this look I'd look like a mauled Smurf. You are very skilled and it's a pleasure to watch!
This is indeed quite chic
This is almost reminiscent of the cubism art style! Love it!!
when i apply gel liner in the waterline, i take the end of a brush and dip it in the liner, it irritates my eye less
You're simply a breath of fresh air. I'm upset over the immense amount of time I've wasted on less-than-brilliant channels these past few years.
I love seeing you opening up more to us <3
Those people who dislike this are complete buttocks.
The face and makeup is amazing but I personally don’t feel the red wig goes with it
I am impressed. However I can't help but cringe at the thought of washing all of the brushes after this...
he soinds so enthused to be doing this look, its lovelt to see him so happy and passionate
This is magic! You're brilliant!
Your voice is so soothing, I could listen to you all day!
It has a bit of a Blade Runner feel. Just Beautiful, John.
I've only discovered you in the last weeks and I'd been blown away by your voice, your passion and your expertise. Seeing you have fun with this video made my heart absolutely sing. You look stunning and the individual techniques were interesting and amazing. More people need to be aware of you. You are simply incredible xx
I seriously need you to do my makeup
Love this! More of these please!
In the shade: 'Victim'. *Which is very fashionable to be, nowadays*  LMFAOOO
so... when did you lose control of this makeup?
Aah, this channel is giving me LIFE!! +I can expand my vocabulary in a way I enjoy😄😻❤️❤️❤️💙💙💙
Where did you get those lashes from?  They are so beautiful 😍
my favorite part was when you bite the air. I love you immensely darling <3
Victim, which is fashionable to be lately Fantastic! I love that you have such wonderful little lines within your videos!
19:34 - 19:58 me in the mirror every morning
I've often been dissapointed at the lack of vocabulary of some other MUAs on youtube, but this is almost the complete opposite, far more in depth & more explanatory.
This video is probably my favorite in YouTube
Do you know what I love about your videos?  You don't just dub them or use voice overs. You give off an expression as you explain everything you are doing as if we are your friends, or perhaps students. I enjoy that we get to see all expressions of you; your voice, your word choices, your facial expressions and your talented hand at work creating a masterpiece . This is so soothing to watch. I believe you produce a positive refreshing, original kind of art.
This look gives me 'The fifth element' vibe, Love it!
Stunning
Ugh that cut crease is life!
WOW.
I adore your voice ohmygosh
Vampy vibes loving it
19:48 my favorite thing
I'm stunned 😍👌
His smile makes me smile
Reminds me of Mystique
Gorgeous!
“Slightly rancid”
greasy finga
nice vid, thank you!
Wow, stunning!
Just WOW! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
What a fruit.
i love you ❤❤❤
I love this.  The black side (with the blue highlights) would make an excellent base for a galaxy inspired design - replete with comets, stars and nebulae.  Thank you for all your excellent videos!!
I love editorial looks, they give you such an opportunity to have fun and forget about the rules. Please do more, John! Also, your victim comment made me laugh, lol. Took me a second to get it.

Happy birthday!! I hope that I look as good as you when I'm 32... Except that I'm 39... and a boy... Damn you're hot!!!
4:25 Why was blonde Michelle Wie in this video? Makes no sense.
32 things you've learnt this year = 32 reasons why I love this channel 🔥❤
Thank you once again !! I really wish more people could laugh at themselves more. It just makes sense to want to laugh!!
Everything I learnt this year came from this video.

You are one of my favorite humans
GRACIEEE you old fuck I love you
Haven't heard from Margaret Cho or Clidoris Trembles in sooo long!
I hope she'll make couple of videos with her mother and brother during the Christmas season :)
Great video! Happy Birthday Grace, you make my day better whenever I watch you. Thank you for that.\nAlso, the final expression in the video is precious.
Happy birthday! And also you should totally be a drag queen.
I think I want that sweater. Where'd you get it Grace?

Happy bday why am I her

#LawnzGnomes
5:38 Shots fired! 😂
Awe haha happy birthday Grace
1:30 FUCK
Shouldve kepts #3 to yourself. It's disgusting to have a stank pussy and then you admit to have stink pussy. At 32 your pussy still stinks???? Thats DISGUSTING
Doesn't it suck not being good at processing emotion. To day someone told me the reason a helicopter had been hovering over my village was because some girl got drunk and tried to commit suicide by jumping into the harbour and my response is an awkward smile and saying well that was a great idea in a sarcastic tone....what is wrong with me. And when people tell me a problems all i can suggest is tea. And when I sign cards I can only think of really generic things to say because i'm really bad at sentimentality.  The weird thing is that I am actually a really caring person....i just don't convey it well.
Toronto lol.  Come on man Americans aren't that stupid.  Most would probably say Anchorage or something in Alaska.
thumbs down for the pushing of storyblocks. oh an a shit, uniformative video
Came here for the video, but fell in love with Tromsø.
I was really hoping you'd add Ittoqqortoormiit Greenland to the list.  Mostly because I really wanted to hear you try to pronounce Ittoqqortoormiit.
Norway squad, where ya at?
You know you live in Ny-Ålesund when you cheat on your wife and the whole town finds out about it
great vid\nkeep it up👍
I loved the Toronto joke
Wow ads built into the video. Fuck that
cheeky transition to the sponsor in the end. I like it.
Most northern town showdown;\n\nAmerica: Looks like shit\nRussia: looks like shit\nNorway: Looks pretty decent
I really thought it would be Eureka
Good luck tho the Norwegian post service is slow even on the mainland
I'd say do the southern most town, but I imagine everyone's parents are brother and sister, and the place would be rampant with mental disability.
Half As Intresting \nHalf As Awesome!\n\n\n\n\n\nI think thats a compliment.....
Love it that you roast everyone – even Newark 😂😂😂
Can you please make more videos every week
Fascinating video. Thank you for all of your hard work in making it!
I have a friend from Svalbard, hes fuckin' weird.
So Svalbard might not require a visa but in order to get there - I'm assuming you will need a transit visa via a third country to get there depending on your passport.
Visa-Free?  What about MasterCard?
Whats the northernmost town? How depressed are they? Why havent they moved? And why am i still commenting!?
Hey, Long-Years-byen right?\n(Long year it's been)
I found one flight reference. I'm at peace now.
Omg my grandad did his military service in Murmansk in soviet times
You should have used a globe instead of a projection for this one
grise fiord, nunavut is the most northern town
Half as interesting is the mean cousin of wendover productions.
1:12 How the f**k is Murmansk a city with 300000 people a town
Tromsø\nPronounced (bear with me, that ø is a vowel that doesn't occur in English) trohm-say (-ay has rounded lips)\nÅlesund\nPronounced Uh-lay-soond
I like that word stupid youtuber
Is there any internet there on that island?
Why would a Brit say that Edinburgh's the most northern town in the world? it's not even the most northern town in the UK.  I'm currently in Loch Ness, which is situated in Inverness, a whole city further north than Edinburgh.
As a Canadian, i'm actually happy that you put up a picture of two tents in Alert and called it our northern most military settlement. Our military is useless.
Your transitions into the ad part are getting more creative...
I'm Norwegian and the way he pronounces the cities is hilarious😂
I live in Toronto, anyone else?
This video is stolen
Toronto the northernmost? I hope this was just a joke and no one believes that, the US has entire states north of Toronto (Washington, Montana and North Dakota).
i get rly annoyed by the way he pronounces tromsø
You're more sarcastic than informative
Why would a Brit say Edinburgh?
Does it have Internet
After seeing this video, I was really excited with story blocks free trial and went for it and from the impression I got in the video I would be able to download many clips over the next 7 days and try out this amazing platform, but just after downloading a half a dozen clips or so I got a message saying I have exceeded the limit of video I could download during the trail, this limit wasn't explicit in your video or after clicking the link. I would like to know if anything can be done about this and if I could continue downloading stock footage
It's not too-lay\n\nit's a th sound like when you say through then ool like tool
I’ve been to Ny-Ålesund
Only British people aren't retarded enough to think Edinburgh is the northernmost town.
You can just decided to move to Svalbard. You are required to have a job  if you wanna live there and you need a permanent address somewhere else. When you retire you have to move.
Not only did he call Edinburgh a town he didnt realise that there is civilization above it seriously?
How about what is the southernmost Town in the world?
The transition to that sponsorship was not boring at all. That's pure marketing.
Already trending on this channel..Big things are to come
Thank you for the video! Ive always wondered whats going on the northernmost part of the world..
because logic and sensibility does not exist in Russia...\n\nhuh. it'll be The Northenmost World in Town
I wanna move to svalbard.
If you ask an American, the northernmost town in the world is probably Toronto, Canada.\n\n\n\nLmfao
The humour is great, and that segway into the ad was flawless
I live in Longyearbyen !!
To my bucket list
I really do not think anyone in the UK thinks Edinburgh is the northern most town. Its not even a town. I live further a lot north than Edinburgh.
1:43 gives me a cool fact:\n\nLongyearbyen saw totality in the 2015 total eclipse on March 20, but the same year the town suffered an avalanche.
Its called Tromsoe in english i come from Tromsø
I'm just happy Norway got mentioned in something
Really? Toronto? Even just sticking with Canada's 3 largest cities, Vancouver is further north. So are Ottawa (national capital), Montreal (other of the 3 largest), most of the other provincial capitals, and all of the territory capitals.
... Or you can move there and become a stupid YouTuber 😂😂😂😂
I know this isn’t a “town”, but there is a Russian camp on the artic ocean, which is more further than Alert, Canada

Hallo fra tromsø (hello from tromsø)
I hate Mercator projection. Svalbard island looks like retarded.
Barrow is technically Utqiagvik now
Damn, that transition into the storyblocks promo
4:19 *cough* jakepaul *cough* sign me up!
How clever, putting NJ down
My mom used to live an hour away from Murmansk!
You CAN live in Alert as it's a city

Just call it Long Year City, that's what it means
the most northernmost town is actually Alert,Canada
Barrow AK ?
The way he says Tromsø is funny
As a Norwegian, I learn more about my country from foreign youtubers than from school
I did not even watch the whole video as I know the northernmost town is Alert in Canada.

A Slave and a Slave Master CAN NOT pray to the same God!!!
The white supremacist have always used religion to control black people and we've allowed it to happen since slavery. Always forgiving these white supremacist race soldiers for killing innocent unarmed black people.
Black Atheist here. Christianity is a cancer to modern society and made to keep the minds of black people enslaved.
I think black people process non-belief differently. Generally, whites become Atheists and want to tell the entire world. Many of them come off as having a real ax to grind with religion. Plenty of black people have turned away from religion. We just don't feel the need to broadcast it like that.
Black and atheist as ever, however I stay gucci down to the socks
Love DL he always says whats on his mind
Shit i know a few black atheists...they believe there's no God but everything is just part of the universe
I'm a black atheist 😉
When you can sing every word of conjunction junction, but still don't know what one is...that part!
Christianity is a religion designed for peasants! I have more respect for (1)Buddhist, (2)Muslims, hell , even(3) Scientologist.  This is why blacks cling on to it. When they fabricated the stories in the book they did it so to control the mass population and  to keep lower class people in check.
YOOHOO....OVER HERE DL!!! I'm black and I am an atheist!!!! And I know a few more! We are DEFINITELY out here, lol!!!
*Church is THE gayest place on earth.  I feel sorry for the gays @times.  Imagine me attending a KKKlan rally/backwoods meeting only to hear they don't like my kind for hours on end?  This is how gay folk look in church when Rev. Do-Wrong speaks of them going to hell on a bobsled for being gay.  Then he signals the gay choir director to cue the music.* sad.
He dont have any eyebrows...dl need to do some research on cartoon tho i mean the gayest shit ever..
black people dont like gay people? ..fake news
Shout out to Eddie Long!
It's so many niggas on the down low in church
Vaccines changes the dna of the children,  so u add that with gmo products,  bad water, and gay images. We are in a war.
I don't believe in God. I think religion is used for mind control. I'm not knocking anybody for believing, as long as you practice what you preach. If not, keep it movin'
Gays flock to the church because they feel safe because they know the church HAS to accept everyone.  It's their safe place.
ATL niggas be like it's only gay if you suck dick and you like
im just here to see what the DoDo chasers are going to say !
I KNOW God exists. But that's not for me to prove. Either your spirit knows or you're just lost in the human experience. Such is life, literally. But if you fear going to hell that's not true belief anyway. May as well be athiest.
And DL just LOVES Church.

Psalm 14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good... The fool (one who is morally perverse, not mentally deficient) is described as to his belief (no God) and behavior (none... good). His is a practical rather than a theoretical atheism. vv.2-7. Psalm 10:4; Psalm 53:1; Genesis 6:11-13; Romans 3:10. Be Bless.
forgiving? \nRuthless. \nWhy does every black person think slavery was like all the slave movies? \nDo people know what a drama is . If slave movies showed the vast reality of it you would be bored off your ass. Plantations were often to mostly remote , rural and life was tedious and mundane. Africans Americans know nothing about the actual brutality of slavery . The real brutality was over in Africa where Muslims (whether black , Arab or Amizigh) castrated slaves. Why does everything that rape was so common and prevelant. That's just an assumption from watching slave dramas. \nWhy do American blax show almost no interest in learning about the real past? Because deep down they don't want to know their real involvement.
Black gay men go to church because that's what black women do.  They take their cues from black female behavior.  They mimic them completely.  Church attendance in the black community is cultural and traditional.  It's not about God or being a good Christian.  It's about following that cultural imperative, because your mama and grandma forced you to go and they called out Jesus name in vain all the time.  The black church is a cesspool of sin.  There is no God there.
There's plenty of evidence: go to evidenceunseen.com and actually investigate and read a book vlad.  You can tell your not studied our country is becoming post modern not atheist anymore.  If you are an atheist you have no objective standard of morality, you have no objective purpose, there is no point of even living if there is nothing after this because you can't take it with you.  You have the burden of proof.
I don't Agree with this Fool at all but He's Dead On...Churches be Gay asf 💯😂
Please...don't....mention Jesus's name....you're an athiest right? And dont mock Christianity...as for what I said about you choking or gasping for air....believe me...you would no longer be an atheist...NOW....dont bother responding moron.
This Russian bitch stop dropping parts and just drop entire video
So a suicide bomber is spiritually fine? A pedophilic priest is spiritually fine? Black people spend $14 mil a week at church, but hardly support each other or invest in our community infrastructure. That $14 mil would be a great start towards being financially fine as you put it. My comment came as harsh, but I truly don't care about or hate any religion, I just see it as a hindrance for progress and a waste of my time.
I'm bout to start going to church again, find me a black woman.
D.L. actually has a point, cause the black Church well not Church, but the crazy lunatics inside the Church hates LGBT ppl, but they're always the ones whose LGBT, but on the DL...what D.L. said about the Boosie thing is what I've been saying for the longest is that nothing can turn you gay or make you gay, cause you're gay if you find the same gender attractive, so how can seeing gay ppl on TV automatically make you attracted to the same gender? that means you already had thoughts like that, but scared to express it and also when you're uncomfortable with LGBT ppl then you turn to children trying to use that as bait and blame blame blame...on the restroom thing I just think that women whether cis or trans should be in the woman's restroom period, cause what if you put Jazz Jennings a 16 year old in the men's restroom? what about her safety? cause there's numbers of assaults done to trans women and not one evidence showing that trans women use the restroom for nefarious purpose, but ppl are uncomfortable, so they bait you talking about what about the children? well guess what dummies, a predator doesn't need a law to stop them from hurting kids you morons.
I'm tatted up, but his tattoos doesn't fit him
He sounds stupid as hell.  I see why I don't even entertain his shows.  Go do something with your life becasue your wisdom and been a comedian is not working for you.  How his men in the church are gay.  You may have 1 out of 100 but you saying it as if all men in church is gay.  My choir director is not gay.
Correction Mr Hughley. You need Jesus, Comic View. As a 'Joy' man, a homospiritual, gayness is a sexually oriented counterfeit of my spiritual relationship with an invisible man called Jesus. He makes my joy complete. Ever since I started listening to Jesus every other dude started looking like a ladyboy. You too, Jamar. Just ask Yeezus. My wife would prefer it if I slept in the bed with Jesus inside me. I don't expect anyone to understand what it is to be 'joy'. Joy rights have been replaced gay rights, the spiritual with sex. I'm staying in love with my man Jesus, Jamaicans know this is right. I'm just in love with the perfect man. It saves me watching anybody else, whooo! Joy pride...looks like a fool on a cross until you wake up into reality.
What is up with all those tattoos on his neck...SMH\nDude is over 50 with all that mess on him.
If u dont believe in God then Who created the earth ur standing on? Who created Adam and Eve? How would u know that a woman was made for a man? How would u know that homosexuality is wrong? Plz dont say science . Majority of these so called christians u see today are fake christians so people give up on faith becuz of how christianity is being portrayed. Anybody can go to church and claim they're a Christian, but are they truly living the Word of God? If I go to a church and all I see is homosexual ppl in the pulpit and the pastor isnt preaching the word of God or is teaching prosperity, i know thats wrong becuz thats NOT christianity. Im not gonna jst say well God isnt real and give up on my faith based off other peoples sinful acts. That should have nothing to do with ur walk with God. All u can do is pray for them.
I bet there are plenty of people who go to church every Sunday, sit in the pews, and have a struggle in their heart and mind about whether God truly exists. They go out of routine and from fear of rejection and disownment from family, partners and friends. At least 90% of blacks are religious and are ready to cut your throat if you say you don't believe God exists. So some people keep quiet and just do the routine.
hell is a mythology about Earth, so u might as well let that fear go, G and hit the books. Salute to the OG DL tho on God/Allah/Buddha and Big Mama.
DL? More like Double D L! Look at those fucked up titties of his!
D.L. is correct look at side effects of soybean food, vaccines, dental mercury amalgam and black preacher etc it's crazy man very crazy the world we live in
I didn't know this brother was so deep
dl..if it's supposed to be a girl, but she's just a guy Cross dressing!? then he rapes your daughter? his point is correct. but that's not OUR, people against it, point..
DL face when Vlad said gay cartoons 😂😂😂
this ninja retarded
D.L is not lying about that.  All jokes aside 💯💯💯💯
Vlad : Kaityln Jenner was ESPN's woman of the year!\nDL : Yeah & she wasn't a woman for a month!
Bra DL old ass TATTED THE FUCK UP THO !!! I nigga got mo hits then lil wayne
The Truth will either set you free or scare the shit out you God is a women not the one n that fake as Bible with fake ass jesus
TOXIC COMMENT SECTION BELOW: GRAB SOME POCORN AND SOME ORANGE MILK SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW!
A  black man on his knees in a church with a white jesus image in his mind you got to be GAY. Along with that type of posture and that image NO way you can be a positive image other young black men absolutely 👎 NO way.
That have to conflict your mind a lot on top of all the other issues that they face
Man, i LOVE this hat DL. Very stylish sir. Man, it's banging!!!!!!!
You wanna solve the bathroom issue....write dick on one door and vagina on the other...boom
This guy acts woke but he really isnt. He is also indoctrinated by white society. IMO.
The last minute of the video, he's right. Like no you want people to know. That example goes along with so many other things
It was given to us by the white man to keep us down! They hid the truth and our history from us please READ and RESEARCH
Boozie saying their trying to make ppl gay but he said when he was locked up he seen 2 niqqers fucking each other... So I guess black dudes don't need no help?!
He said it doesn't make sense lol
I like D.L., but I think there is something to what Boosie said.  I've seen things and been a victim of things that give me an understanding of how people can try to intrude on the most personal and basic attributes of human existence.  And the big orgs that he's talking about are made up of people.  As a writer, I often write about character's private lives and a few of those characters in every would I have created have been homosexual.  I'm not trying to change the sexuality of others, I'm just creating worlds that look like the world I've experienced.  But others aren't like me.  If they can use storytelling power to rule over others, they will.
I used to believe in God.. until my grandmother, a woman who has served the Lord for the majority of her life, spent most of her time serving the church, has always paid her ties....ends up with Alzheimer dementia...God is allowing her to lose her mind, despite her faithfulness. My family seems to believe that she can just speak the disease away by quoting scriptures, esp my aunt who is in denial... and it really enrages me. IDK what to believe... im leaning/moving more towards Deism to be honest.\n\nMy aunt is in denial, willfully ignorant about my grandmother's condition... and as a result, she is doing things that she is not supposed to do when dealing with an elderly person that has this condition, she doesn't understand that my grandmothers mind rubberbands and that the disease causes habits that are innate ... so it is pointless to attempt to constantly correct or remind my grandmother.. I got so angry at her a couple weeks ago about a situation between both of them that  i wanted to lay hands on her.... but that would be unacceptable.
Never mistake the Christian church for being connected with the bible,its not!!!\nThey hold the bible in their hand but blaspeme and don't follow it or teach it at all!!!!
2:00-06 he just said the shit Vlad
I believe in the higher power but not da bullshit
Also I said to my friend the other day it's really no longer a man's world it's a women and children's World hence there's more gays in the world which I have no problem with it but it's true there's more homosexuals in the world today than there ever has been a lot of people like to blame it on the men not being in the home but again these men are being raised mostly by women
DL looks like a state trooper with that hat on
Majority of these churches are full of undercover devils. Those preachers will preach the word but will do the exact opposite. The ones preaching sanctimoniously be the ones with the most dirt like that dude on the Spike Lee movie Red Hook Summer.
What is the deal with the black community always finding this shit to discuss? Somebody always being suspect or looking a certain way, its not gonna matter whos gay or straight, its not gonna stop nobody's money flow or how this economy is ran, why is this the only community that has such a stigma with this? Ya'll don't like talking about it then turn around and bash your very own brothers and sisters of color that are. This is why blacks will never be able to come together as one
society...meaning white people.
Y'all wannabe atheist nigga goofy 😆😆
Dislike squadddd all day culture vulture
Vlad don't know SHIT
Black atheist here! ✋🏿

That forgiveness trait comes from slavery!
Just read Deuteronomy 28 the whole chapter an Deuteronomy 7, an Psalms 83. It will tell you who the true hebrew an jews are. An why black people go through so much
African spirituality is full of forgiving people also before, and after Christian influence.
Boosie said evil coming at the kids with gay agenda through cartoons D L refutes it and then turns around to strengthen it with his bathroom logic saying they're trying to push something on us we don't agree with by unnecessarily bringing it up, whether cartoons parades bathroom disputes or coming out the closest it's to desensitize and normalize abnormalities
In slavery the church was the only place you could come together and have some relief , it was like the only social gathering available almost like a concert  , you was not allowed in night clubs , theatres and etc. Thats why it became a big deal with the culture .
The black church is definitely beyond suspect of gay shit
Davey & Goliath was a Lutheran show. Shame on you D.L.
We should not be so forgiving
DL so you just gonna let a atheist shame your people bcz they practice the virtue of forgiveness . Shame on you DL for not knowing the value of human value of true love . Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness it’s a gift that brings abundance of great energy . It takes a real man / Women to forgive . Let’s not forget that .
What's up with dude vlad a black people. He need to talk to some real niggas
This guy is weird looking now lol
greatttttttttttt question VLAD..
Homos flock to church
Now He Tripping
Eddie Long?
No shit! A Jew obsessed with black culture is essentially an atheist... I've never seen one of those before
Atheism >>>>>
Forgive lol why?
WE ARE THE REAL JEWS THE ISREALITES
Been A Black Athiest since Birth!'
Goe is Real ! Just because you don't see his presence that's what Faith is about... This life is a Test

I'M A BLACK CHRISTIAN.
This is amazing advice but it's very situational. Don't do this with a narcissist, or anyone who is emotionally immature. In both childhood and adulthood I've expressed when I'm hurt to my parents, and their immediate reaction was denial, rejection and gas-lighting. Rarely will they apologize and soften up. My mother, who adores being the victim in any circumstance, can never bring herself to a proper apology, it is always I'm sorry you misinterpreted what I said to anyone and everyone.... If you practice this with these type of people, it can draw up a lot of resentment and make it harder to open up (or be open) to someone who is genuinely emotionally there for you. So yes, good advice, but be careful. The supportive and emotionally vulnerable girlfriend is not always the reaction. Sometimes she'll lash out and say you're making her out to be the villain.
My only qualm:\n\nI know it's stupid, but...\n\nNo. It's not stupid to feel unimportant when you're trying to have a conversation about something that matters to you with someone that matters to you. It's not stupid to feel hurt or to ask to have just a moment of their undivided attention😕
*I want to address the line: I have a big ego by asking you for your attention, forgive me.* Asking someone for their attention doesn't mean you have a big ego, it simply means you want to connect. If said person has abruptly stopped conversing with to play Candy Crush or Facebook, that is fine, you can leave them be and have the conversation another time or you can ask them for their attention. _I feel that should be said. if you think I am wrong then by all means, critique me.
This is so real. I thought it was just me who wanted to hurt the ones I love when feeling mysterious hurt. Thank you for this amazing video!
When I first watched this video, I thought I realized where I went wrong with a friend/love interest that I lost very recently.\nThen I read the comments and a lot of people had similar experiences as myself.\nI've finally realized I've done this with my friend. I did this with my friend. I showed vulnerability. I showed hurt. I was calm. I told her I wanted to talk about it. I showed compassion for how she was feeling. I didn't attack or berate her. I told her I understood her and didn't mean any harm to her or mean anything ruthless to her.\nWhen I first told this girl I had feelings for her, she was drunk. I didn't know that. When she told me she was drunk, I said, Oh, I should've known. And that ticked her off, but she does drink fairly often, so it was a fair statement.\nAnd to cut the story short, every time I'd try to talk about what happened that night, she'd get defensive and tell me to stop and move forward and leave it alone. That's not healthy. I was showing hurt, vulnerability, and love, but she pushed it all away and wouldn't accept it. Yes, show all those things, but it doesn't guarantee you'll be reciprocated. I wasn't reciprocated.\nSometimes when I felt she was ignoring me during normal conversation my hurt would come up and I'd attack her. I'd argue with her. This continued for a month until she finally called it quits and blocked and banned me from her entire life...\nEven during the time I told her my feelings she said, We all fear rejection but you just gotta keep putting yourself out there. I told her I knew my fears were correct and that she didn't share the same feelings as me. She told me not to analyze her and that what I was analyzing wasn't what she meant. She was drunk, mind you, so who knows what the Hell was going through her mind. And during the same time I'd sometimes bring up moving on and letting go. How did she react? What the fuck?! And then eventually she was like, I do have feelings for you, if you're still asking. That gave me hope, but things still didn't seem right.\nThe next morning we talked about some of it, but she wanted to avoid it entirely and even said it was a disaster. She even blamed me for trying to have a conversation with her while she was intoxicated, when I was unaware until she told me. And if I had just assumed she was drunk, she would've gotten mad at me then too because she hates when I assume things. So either way, I would've been wrong and blamed for it. \nI tried talking to her calmly. I tried to have a mature conversation with her. My guard was already completely down and I was ready to just communicate. She refused. She obviously regretted what she said while drunk. Even though your true inhibitions, your true feelings, the truth comes out when you're drunk, she even denied that notion when I brought it up, but I may have brought it up in a passive aggressive way too. But seriously, I was already vulnerable and she wasn't accepting it or opening up to me, so I had a right to start getting mad. I opened up with vulnerability and showed my goddamn hurt. Because liking her actually hurt me because I was so worried I'd get rejected and I hadn't liked a girl like this for at least 2 years, so I was scared. I made myself depressed over it. I tried keeping it bottled up, but I ended up just letting it out and apparently at the most misopportune time. I let my crush on her literally crush me until I was forced to just let it out. I was most vulnerable at that point because I was already hurting from thinking about rejection. But I still went in vulnerable. And I did try to handle it the best I could by telling her I'd move on and let go. She got mad when I SAID I would move on and let go, but guess what SHE told me to do the next morning? Move on, Jake. Let go, Jake. When I said it, she had a problem with it. When she said it, she meant it as a demand.\nAnd then when I just couldn't get any further with her with communication on the situation, I just gave up when she told me, Regardless of what I said. Enough I quit replying after that. I left the conversation. 10 minutes later she texts me, Read and ignored sweet She got mad at me for leaving the conversation where it was. She got mad at me for letting it go. She got mad that I was trying to move on. I replied back to her, I didn't know what to say. I didn't want to bother you further. Her response, K. I asked if she was mad at me. She yelled at me with a, NO response. What was i supposed to do? I've done the reasoning through my head plenty of times and what I should've done is just kept on ignoring her and not replying. Let it fester in her for a while. Let her think about it. I never gave her time to think about things like that because I always felt bad for ignoring her or leaving a conversation where it was, even randomly. That's just not how I am. But I realize it was her game. I was playing her game and I didn't succeed. What I should've done is walked away and not talk to her for awhile. What I did was feel guilty for leaving her unanswered, even though she told me, Enough. \nAnd then after that little fiasco, this all happened on the day of the eclipse, so she brought up the eclipse as a change of subject. we talked about it very briefly before she just read and ignored my text mid-conversation. I left it alone, but after about 2 hours, I just went off on her and told her how I didn't appreciate how she was treating the situation and me. That's when we got into a heated argument. She even threatened that if I don't stop, then we can't be friends anymore and she even added in, And that would make me really sad. Every other argument we'd have that day she'd bring up the notion of, Friends or nah? She was FORCING a choice onto me. Not to mention before the arguments she yelled at me saying, WE ARE FRIENDS. THAT'S IT. When I was trying to communicate about the night before. She wouldn't have any of it. I wasn't trying to force a relationship. I told her many times I was in no rush to jump in a relationship. I told her many times I respected the way she felt and that if she wasn't ready, I was okay with it. I gave all the assurance in the goddamn world. And she still yelled at me for trying to communicate. She didn't want to be vulnerable with me like I was with her. She kept on forcing the notion of us being friends or not onto me when we were arguing. Do you know how hard that is? You're asking me to ignore my feelings and hurt and how you've yelled at me all day, and you're trying to force me to either be your friend or leave you. That's not freaking healthy!!!!! I finally gave in because she threatened to block me if I didn't give her a break and leave it alone. I tried being her friend, but every time we'd talk I'd want to go back to that day and try to talk about it. She wouldn't have any of it. She wanted it to be left in the past. As if 2 days to a week ago or even a month ago can be considered The past. The immediate past, sure, but you don't just get over something like that immediately. But that's what she expected form me. She expected me to be just her friend and forget everything that happened that night and day. \nIt felt very manipulative and controlling. \nFunny/ironic thing is, I don't think she spoke to me extensively while drunk again after that. She might've had some small talk with me while drunk, but never got into anything too deep again while drunk. Never build friendships with people who will talk to you often while drunk. The first time we bonded over deep shit was when she was drunk. Yeah, never bonding with someone again while they're drunk. And if I do, It'll be left as is, a drunk memory. I'm not taking anything seriously from another bonding moment with a drunk person/friend again. I'll remember it for future reference, but as for taking it seriously and thinking it means anything serious, nah, never again.\nShe knew her problem, but wouldn't admit to it. She quit talking to me while drunk, but she wouldn't apologize to me for it or give any kind of closure over it or any kind of communication over it. I would explain explain and explain what I was thinking and feeling to her, but she'd never do the same for me. She'd even question me at times, I don't understand why you continue to let this eat at you. And I told her it was because I didn't understand it. Communication is all about understanding. Without communication, there is no understanding, and with no understanding makes assumptions and other ideas come up in your mind to try and justify it. And she got mad at those assumptions and ideas when i shared them with her. But she wasn't mature enough to communicate with me, so why is she blaming me when she could've communicated and helped me better understand things? \nShe tried to make me feel guilty for my feelings. I've went over it several times in my head since she's been gone and I'm realizing more and more how manipulative and controlling she was. She didn't want me to think a certain way. She didn't want me to think of her in a negative light. She didn't want me to leave her, but she wanted me to move on and let go. When I put the idea in her that I might not want to be friends anymore, she got scared. She gave me puppy dog eyes and made me feel bad for even that. I felt guilty. She guilt tripped me. She guilt me into being her friend. She guilt tripped me in being her friend when I tried to move on and let go. She guilt tripped me when i thought about ending the friendship. She guilt tripped me for my feelings. All so she could slice my throat open herself and end it herself. She wanted the satisfaction of watching me bleed. She took advantage of my vulnerability and weakness. You open yourself up to people and you're only opening up a bigger wound for them to stab you in and make it sting a Hell of a lot more.
What's crazy is how ppl wouldn't really respond that way. Most ppl would continue on the phone and say just a sec and be mad and call you needy bcuz u need that time now not to wait on then. At least that's been my experience. No matter how I ask for time, attention, and affection. I'm always told I'm selfish and immature.
We can't control someone elses reactions. Sometimes even explaining calmly doesn't get us the support we need, it doesnt always work that way and to be honest he sounded very apologetic. Sometimes people will explode or find things offensive no matter how calmly we state our point.
Well the girl chatacter is kind of a bitch in this one
I love this channel. One of the most insightful places on YouTube in my opinion.
I don't want to see a fight between a couple ! I am here for advice !!
Mr Botton .. Seen that critique of your channel and methodology ? Going to respond ? .. personally .. i like your channel .. it has been a comforting voice through some very, very tough times, made me feel like everything was ok, like i could deal with another day on this planet, in this spatial / historical manifestation of some kind of conciousness .. the only doubt raised that temporarily  impacted was the commodification, selling of tat at exhorbitant prices but in retrospect, heck we all gotta make a buck to survive, nobodys twisting their bourgeoise arms .. as for me .. how'm i gonna put a few lines on the table and keep my feet in tepid milk stout as i tempt my word processor toward a determinal syntax error ? ;] A4
I dunno about this one.  Sure, communicate better and you can avoid patterns of these types of interactions before the relationship deteriorates in the first place.  But, that first segment looks more like negative sentiment override where neutral behavior is interpreted as criticism and each party is basically waiting to attack or be defensive.  Showing vulnerability at that point may not do much to improve interactions between people who no longer feel fondly for each other.
kinda clicked bc jack is in the thumbnail soo
Narcissistic Personality Disorder - Love to see a video on that one - a nightmare condition.
Why am I watching videos about devonping a good relationships when I've never had a relationship and will never get one?
It feels like you're just rehashing old videos under vaguely different titles... time for something new to get this channel back up and running again
I just watched it with my Girlfriend to see if there is something new that we could apply in our relationship. We were so happy to realize that we already act like this. Unfortunately we realized that a lot of people we know do not.
When you're a loner but still watch this shit carefully just in case one day someone loves u back and you end up in a relationship
first time clicking on this, i thought it was gus johnson in the thumbnail........................................................
I've always wonder at The School Of Life is this advice to help everyone no matter where we are in life. Wether you are a 14 year old in the states or a 23 year old attending college are you all makerting to every person?
I see myself in this.
which one of yall read the monologue in the narrator’s voice
is it ok if i show that i'm hurt, angrily?
hey how does the rest of the calmer discussion end???
Unless you're dating a sociopath as they will use any vulnerability you show against you.
I like how they learn to communicate better on this one thing, then argue about something else afterwards. It seems realistic to point out that this will not end all conflict.
of course he’s right, it’s very disrespectful
What should someone do if a fight starts based on your confession about being vulnerable? When your partner instead of just accepting your vulnerability wants to go deeper and this makes you feel under judgement? He just wants to understand, but i just want to be accepted and these questions especially when i am trying to fight my anger seem so inappropriate for that moment
I can not relate to someone who takes out their cellphone before a conversation is over. It's phenomenally rude. That cellphone is going in the toilet.
You know what? The second way of reacting sounded much stronger than the first, childish one. Remaining calm feels like a very both empathic and confident person.
Crying is not just for infants.  Haven't you ever experienced a scene in a movie where an adult cries?  Yes, even adult men... especially men.  It's very moving.  Crying gets you in a different place than the part of your brain that is trying to protect YOURSELF...now you feel protective (compassionate) toward the other person.\n\nAlso, some people below had questions about how to express that someone is hurting you, in a work context.  Here is what I have seen, and does not make the person look weak:  Say, Ouch.  That's it.  Then quickly move on.  There isn't time for the person you are speaking to,  to mount a counter-attack; they might even be slightly confused (they didn't realize the stupidity/insensitivity of what they were saying).  But later they will think back at what they said (because you said Ouch) and they'll get it.
Its hard to identify when the people in the video are so annoying.
I tried scenario two once and got told to not be such a baby, y e a h, that's doesn't work either.
Hello from Colombia. What about a video of schizophrenia? Causes, treatments and related things? Blessings from Sincelejo.
Jack Howard was a great choice for this video! : )\n\nI think most people are afraid if they show vulnerability, they will be mocked or hurt further. This is a good response to those fears. <3
Being lone is the best the way to avoid these problems.
Beautifully acted. Gave me an anxiety attack.
I wish you would do a video about someone trying to break their habit of being toxically submissive.The kind of quiet self restraint that helps no one in the end.
Ironic how they’re watching Germany Vs. Brazil 😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣
Omg Jack Howard and School of Life crossover. Worlds colliding! 🌏
I lost someone I loved with all my heart when instead of being kind when I felt hurt by him, and explaining this to him nicely, I decided to lash out at him. I lost him. Lesson learned...entirely too late, though. 😞
Jack! I'm super pleased to see you.
I feel like relationship advice from The School of Life represents how ideal people in the ideal world SHOULD behave, rather than useful advice to be used in the real world with real people.
One should sacrifice if you want to understand each other
How do you handle it when you show hurt and they respond by mocking you? Let's also assume that, for the sake of having a real conversation, they are not evil monsters. They just have a difficult time taking emotions and related conversations seriously.
That's not Jim, that's Jack Howard.
What a good acting
FUCK that! She needs to listen! If he goes and finds someone else who will listen, then he's somehow wrong! GTFOH WITH THAT BULLSHIT! 😐
School of life please make more videos to enhance our emotional intelligence. The world is not kind:(
These videos are pretty bad lately.. terrible acting
thank you . this came at the perfect time
I break up usually
What is the background music?
It's so like us..even the topic of conversation
I feel like dealing with the pain of being alone is much easier than dealing with the pain (and annoyance, and stupid bullshit) of being in a relationship.
men have pride ,women have harsh-head ,nothing would work except long time arguing to relieve the stress .... arguing is a solution to say everything you want to say
As a woman, I find vulnerability in men almost invariably attractive. Many feel so much pressure to be stoic or strong that it feels hard to get to know the real person within. So revealing weakness to me feels like a gesture of trust, which I find ultimately flattering. (Egocentric motivation, I suppose 😏 at least in part) I am slow to trust, so the vote of confidence means worlds to me.\n\nHowever, I will admit there are caveats: \n1. When someone has hurt me very badly, and they express guilt or shame upon releazing my hurt, I do feel somewhat satisfied and take pleasure in their pain, but only to the extent that I feel it evens the score (no more than I hurt for no longer than I hurt). This is only in extreme situations.\n2. ‎When people use a facade of honesty as an excuse for being an asshole or venting raw emotion carelessly without any effort towards tact or self-restraint. (Basically launching a personal attack under the guise of just being honest.)\n3. ‎When I feel their expressing hurt is actually a tale of woe aimed at manipulating my emotions intentionally to make me feel sorry for them and reduce their culpability. Or if I notice that particular person seems to have a pervasive victim mentality, even if they are not consciously aware of it. This is frustrating. Taking responsibility is key.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, I can deal with sadness quite well, but not anger. Anger antagonizes, whereas sadness invites empathy.
Naturally, it goes both ways. If someone courageously admits that he/she felt hurt, then you should properly and eagerly listen to them without hitting back.
This shit doesn't work. They will tell you to get over it, a partner that cares about you doesn't do shit they know will upset you unless it is unavoidable.
I wish it were that easy. I'm glad sometimes it is. It should be our first line of defense. It seems though that there are people who watch for that kind of thing to use it. Sociopaths. And if you are with them, well I just don't know if there's any good way to deal with someone who eats off of your vulnerability. Who waits for it and hopes for it to use it against you. \n        I guess if you get a healthy person this is the best way. But if you were predisposed, trained to be in defective relationships from childhood, well it's a bit more complicated. But not to be given up on.... it's just going to take more time and focus to fix all the backwards stuff you were trained to accept.
Yeah. It doesn't work in today's fearful/narcissistic society. It doesn't work. Show your hurt, women leave. Show your hurt, men take advantage of it.
Great acting / depiction of real couple arguments
Sometimes I want angry make up sex, not apologetic tender sex.
Not working for me.... a person keeps hurting me and refusing to talk to me. No matter if I tell her I'm hurt or if I get mad. She just doesn't care. And I care for her so much. She's my sister, so it's not like I'll ever walk away from her. What can I do but just hurt silently? Addressing what's hurting you isn't always the answer because sometimes the person really is selfish and they aren't going to care.
JACK HOWARD IS IN IT. I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES!!! <3
He should have just got up and turkey slapped her....
Mind what you say. Words, like bullets, cannot be taken back.
Jack Howard!?! How'd I find you all the way over here?
School of Life do you not realize that the lashing out and insulting behavior IS how people show thier hurt? What you are advocating isn't showing people you are hurt but rationally explaining why they feel hurt. Reveling in your negative emotions leads to negative responsess, like insults and attacks. You can not explain to another person why you feel hurt unless you know why yourself. This means taking a moment,  stepping back and examing your emotional state. In this video, in your positive example, the man explains to  the woman why he is hurt he doesn't show it. Most animals lash out after they have been hurt, the hardest part is stopping yourself from that behavior,  and this video does nothing to help with that part.
question: does this have something to do with bad parenting ?
The parallel the guy showed vulnerability by expressing how he was hurt? Well, the “bad” parallel to the “good” parallel would have been if she wasn’t acknowledging and accepted that she hurt him. Sometimes, if you tell someone that they hurt your feelings and how they hurt you, they’ll deny their part and blame you for being “too sensitive/emotional” or “I shouldn’t have to walk around eggshells around you” translation,”I have to think about what I say to you before I say it. I don’t want to be respectful of your thoughts and feelings.” or “Then, I must be the monster or the bad guy.” After, they’ll entice you to fight or argue back with them so they don’t feel like they’re the only monster or bad guy, thus they will push you to say something just as cruel or malicious so they feel they are on equal footing. “Now we’re both hurt, so you can’t say shit else.”
And what happens when you tell your partner he hurt you, but he continues to do the same, and then blame you for feeling hurt and angry?
Jack, fancy seeing you here.
I WISH... lól
Whaaaat Jack!! Hey man!!!!
Woo jack
Jack! :D
Awesome!!
JACK
Love these👍

I could be crying my eyes out and my husband wouldn't bat an eye. I hate that narcissist
I'll tell you exactly what happens when you reveal your emotions to most women:  Awww, man up.  If there's one thing most women in my life couldn't handle its listening to men's emotions, they don't matter and they have the nerve to call US the whinebags at the slightest sign of complaint.
I did that and she said I am not man enough and broke up.
To be quite honest, I'm confused about how emotional intelligence is any different from intellectual intelligence-isn't rational thinking (essentially the type of thinking being endorsed here) a type of intellectual intelligence readily captured in existing IQ tests? We acknowledge that there is some kind of emotional disturbance, but choose to suppress or ignore it for the sake of rational thought and behavior. How is this type of thought different from the type of thinking required to decide to pull a train track switch to save 5 people instead of doing nothing and saving one?
I'm autistic and even I realise that getting out your phone while someone is trying to talk to you is offensive.  How does that make his ego fragile? Would the  women be fragile if the roles were reversed?\nPlease explain.
This sounds great but, my wife would call me a pussy if I showed my feelings. In fact she has before.
Kiera, I absolutely adore your makeup in this video!!! You look gorgeous!\nAlso we're the same personality type! Woooo
It seems that I'm behind the times.  So sorry to hear about Louie!  Hope you're doing alright.
Commit to a medusa!!!! They are beautiful ❤️
I'm getting my medusa 13th October xD and yeeees you should get it medusa are so beautiful  (sorry for my English I'm so tired xD )
Omg Lou Lou bean :( I'm so sorry to hear that, I literally cried my eyes out when you told us that and grabbed my boys and smooshed em. You are such a caring and wonderful person and changed to many people's opinions about ratties with your gorguz ratty boys. God bless
Hi Kiera, really sorry to hear about losing your little rat butt, I just found a lump on my oldest today and dreading anything happening to him. \nMy question would be advice on starting a business. I started Crafty Little Studio early 2017 but relaunched and changed crafty completely September 1st. The advice would be amazing! \nI do illustration, design and photography but I'm looking to include ceramics in a few weeks once my kiln gets placed in my studio and diy projects. \nThank you for your wonderful self, you've helped inspire me to open my own business with your YouTube channel over the years xxx
So sorry about Louis. I had to put down my old lady cat about two months ago. It's tough.
love your videos! such an inspiration. sorry for your loss :(
My sister had dougal and the blue cat on record and I was traumatized at the sound of dougal crying and the blue cat being mean!!! Even the thought of it 🙈🙈🙈🙈 xxx
I love how you called fantastic 4 'fantfourstic' 😂😂
don't get the medusa!!! I think it would look pretty but the scar/hole that it would leave would be in such a noticeable place
How can we find your eBay? Xx
Aww bless Louis x hope you're alright :( 💞💞💞 but thankfully your last video was with him which is beautiful :)
Your make up is studding! You should make a tutorial on it
I've done so many Meyers Briggs tests and I always get INFP as well! :-)
omg you answered my question! thank you so much :))) x
So sorry to hear about Louis 💔 you gave him and all your rats such good lives! And it's nice that you did that video where you got some of his pawprints, so you have something to remember him by ❤❤
I'm INFP also, apparently we're pretty rare ;)
Kiera, would you pass the butter please?
are you getting any more rats?? xx
Okay. I have a min pin that’s name is Sophie that looks exactly like your little stuffy!! to a tea! \nLove the rick and morty reference at the end 😂😂😂
I've been watching you for yeeaaaars now, waaay back in your ScarletSaint days, and to find out that you love Florence and the machine too is well cool! Florence Welch speaks to me on a spiritual level, she has an incredible voice!🖤
I'm so sorry for your loss, Kiera. I can only imagine how you must feel. I have two rabbits, named Darwin (I named him after your Darwin, he was my fave ratty!) and Daisy :). Darwin has had some medical problems in the past year or so and I cry just at the thought of losing him. They've both helped me so much with my anxiety and depression, it's unbelievable. Fur babies are the best, and even though it's a shame they're with us for such a short time, we should consider ourselves lucky for being able to spend so many precious moments by their side <3
Good luck to you babe . You will be strong and this pain will fade away over time to be replaced with a happy heart for all the great memories you spent together.\nLexi
💖 Ahah! We listen to the same music. So glad! 💖\nHope the little souvenir of Louloubean's painting will help in the loss of this sweet lil'thing.\nxx
When you said Fant 4 Stic I laughed really hard because i use to call Fantastic 4 that when I was younger
A medusa would look fab on you I had one a few years back one of the easiest piercings to look after in my opinion - had to take it out for work :'(
You should do a video with highlights from the team beam store x)
Second comment, but if you do the ebay charity thingie with thrifted items If you find any could you list plus size finds? I would love to have a browse but I'm like a 18 or 16 on a good day :)
Hi Keira, I'm sorry for your loss, I can only imagine the pain you and Alex went through. Your boys warmed my heart and made me love ratties and mice (wich I already loved but didn't know could be such amazing pet friends) and thanks to you all back in April I got two little mice which I love with all my heart. I can never thank the Bean family enough for that. Btw you both ROCK and are as strong as only a bean can be! We subscribers are all with you and we can't wait for you next amazing videos 💕
We're the same personality type! I always connect so much with people who are the same type as me, it's nice to understand why I like your channel so much! I'm excited for little doe to launch, are you going to do more jewellery, like rings and bracelets?
You should watch Nasty Gal on netflix.. or is it amazon. It is really cool and could totally be you with thrifting!
I'm an INFP too! I always thought you were :)
Just do it! I got an Ashley piercing last month and I love it! 😍😙
That blue cat was actually the stuff of nightmares! Haha
I feel your pain, my pup of 13 years just passed away yesterday, I can't believe it, and I find myself expecting to see her come around the corner, and then I remember that she's gone...it's the hardest thing ever. \nSo my heart hurts for you, sending you lots of love.
I've been following you since your first adventures with the beans. I got two of them at the same time actually and that's why I found your channel! I got into a depression and didn't watch much YouTube or go on Instagram or anything and then I came back and saw how many beans you've lost. I knew it was inevitable but it still sucked to see you sad. I almost mourned with you, because I lost mine at the same time. I don't know where I'm going with this but to say I'm sorry and even I'm the worst of times, know you have a support system.
I'm so sorry to hear about Lou :c I can't imagine.... It's always hard losing a pet because to us they're not our pets they're our family our children our best friends.. May Lou rest peacefully.
idk... a medusa is so front and center
I just got my medusa and I am so happy! I have my septum pierced too. I will say that the medusa didn't hurt as bad as my septum but you do feel that needle more moving through your skin lmao. I even got both my nostrils pierced when I got my medusa. Nose hurt me more than the lip piercing. You would look gorgeous with the medusa <3 Sending love to you for the loss of your ratty babe <3
I know that seeing my goals in practice with other people really helps me achieve them because I can visualise them better. If you're like me and would find this useful, you should check out Christine Kobzeff's channel. She makes jewelry as a full time job, employs her husband, and goes to outdoor markets and fairs regularly to sell (but also to go flee market shopping!)
i can't wait for little doe to return so i can ruin my bank balance and support your shop!! you make the most beautiful jewellery <3
I just about died at I pass butter xD
I'll share my own opinion on the piercing ONLY cause you asked for feedback. When someone has such a beautiful face AND amazing makeup and hair abilities, piercings just take away from it. I don't like them. They never make someone look better imo. At least with a septum, you can not wear it and the hole isn't visible. The lip one--probably not so much.
I also have a poser clock. I use to use it but then the ticking started driving me CRAZY so I had to take the batteries out. Now it just sits on my night stand looking pretty and gathering dust 😂
In a very similar position - four ratties to none. They do leave a hole but you'll always have given themthe bestlives they could have asked for x (edit- god yes get that piercing )
I’m so sorry about Louis 💕 sending lots of love.
Get your Medusa!! It'll look awesome on you!
Woooo! welcome to the Mediator Group! I know its not real science or anything, but i love this kind of shit. That site particulary, i really enjoyed. I read through the entire Mediator pages and descriptions and ive never seen a personality description so apt. Of course its not 100%, but some of the things it go t right were so right, like in ways i never had the words for before. I was quite impressed.
holy I'm an infp-t as well! Do you ever feel like you're an empath? Whenever I meet other infp's, I've found that we tend to be extremely empathic <3
I love your passion for making genuine videos that you want to make, without having to worry about views etc :) I can't wait until you have your business up and running. 🌈 All the best to you and Alex 💜
also get your medusa pierced! it would look amazing!!! i would have got mine already but my job doesn't allow it :( your very lucky that you can have all the tattoos and piercings you like! so doo eeeet
I made the test a few days ago and i am a mediator, too. I really get you and how you just want to do little doe. you are so passionate about it and I am absolutely in love with his. \nAnd a medusa would look really cute on you.
lovely babycakes, Im so sorry about Louis. that's all I wanna say<3
You were an amazing rattie mummy and they loved you tons! Huge hugs my lovely x
Hope you're okay and sorry about little Louie. Least you have happy memories of them all and have the videos and pictures of them that you did :) they'll always be in you're heart and always be around as little spirit beans 💙
so sorry to hear about your precious  bean, its so hard to cope with. Please please please dont get your gorgeous hair cut it looks amazing .My hair is the same length and colour but sadly doesnt look as amazing as yours.Sorry but i think a piercing above your mouth will drive you nuts, especially when eating or talking, love your videos , really look forward to them, love to you and alex
i have my nose septum and medusa and i love all of them i think it would suit you so much! Xx
I'm so sad to hear about Louie ❤ I had two girl mice with my boyfriend, and they were my everything. (We even bought a real Swarowski mouse on a vacation, because it reminded us of them, lol) The first one (Makker) had to be put down a year ago this summer, and her sister (Bakker) had to be put down a year ago this November coming up. I had to take 3 days off work BOTH times because everything made me cry. It might sound so dramatic, but honestly, I still can't look at pictures of them or even talk about them for too long without crying to this day. It annoys me so much, because I would LOVE to relive all the good memories we had, but I just can't yet. Even telling this is making me emotional. I just wanted to say that I'm so terribly sorry about what you are going through, but as you said youself; you know he had a great life. ❤❤🐁 much love from Denmark.🌟
Btw as someone who works as a part of the CITV scheduling team I can assure you that grizzly tails and my parents are aliens are still frequently shown on that channel. Let's all get nostalgic ;) absolutely adore you Kiera <3
Because of you I got three pet ratties called Greg, Oscar and Alfie. They’re 3 months old now and I’m in love with them, they have bought me so much happiness! I’m so sorry about your loss, they do only live a short time :( x
We have the same music taste 😍 you named all my faves 💕 love you and hope all is well 🌿✨
i love your The Room references so much, oml
I'm so sorry for your loss honey I hope that it gets easier <3 I love your make up and your top in this video could you do a tutorial on the eye look? xx
Love Hozier! So sorry to hear about Lou 😢
I'm so excited you answered my question! Love your videos, they're always so calming :)
I felt really sad about Lou :c hope you get well love ur videos <3 !
I love your widow's peak!
It's good to see you again! <3
MY GOD, YOU ARE ADORABLE! Thanks for your beautiful video and beautiful thoughts. <3
OMG OMG OMG... Okay, so Kiera Rose just answered my question in one of her videos... I can see unicorns now
Oh my gosh yes Dougal and the Blue Cat!! Finally someone else who knows what this is. Thank you 😊
LOL the Johnny and Rick and Morty edits <3 Hope you're doing well and YES PLS to the medusa!
I used to cry as a child when I realized my pets would eventually die 😢
COMMIT! You can take it out if you hate it. It'll be nice! :3
*hugs- I totally understand your feelings with Lou Bean. ): I spent almost the whole week before Kari had to be pts crying because I just knew the surgery didn't work and there was nothing left to be done, because hand feeding just wasn't helping. UGH now I'm tearing up. lol\n\nI honestly don't blame you for skipping the if you'll get more question (be it you meant to or just didn't see it). I currently still have 3 and have lost 3, in the same three years PLUS 4 I took in to help after Hurricane Harvey. I'm honestly wondering if I really want more after this or not...\n\nI will forever love rats but between the loss and heart break, we're also finally taking the steps to get our first home and save towards the wedding (and to go to a friend's wedding across the country!), I just don't know if I would be able to take on more after this. v.v
I’m an INFP too!
I'm so sorry for your loss Kiera. I always enjoyed your rat videos a lot and they're are the reason I found your channel! Much love and stay strong x
I pass butter... Every time I think I couldn't love you any more... 😂
I am a mediator too! Apparently we make up just 4% of the population. No wonder I have no friends XD
Love you lady x <3
u are so 70s omg. also ur hair looks gorgeous!!
I ASKED A TATTOO QUESTION AND YOU MAY DO A TATTOO QUESTION VIDEO YASSSSSSSSSSSS, Sorry about your little beans! <3 I have 4 ratties and i cant bare to think about when my beans are gone :(
QOTSA!💓
your eyeshadow looks amazing!

I'm INFP toooooooo!!! 💕💕💕
Definitely get a medusa piercing!!!!!
im sorry about your loss :/ i hope you feel better 💛 // p.s. im an ENFP!! so cloooose hahah
After I lost all my ratties I thought I would never want to be a little fuzzy mum again, then I rescued a ferret :| ( the charity was going to kill him because no one wanted him ). I have never looked back, he's such a character, and so so funny. Just a thought.
so sorry to hear about little louis, at least he's with the other boys now 🌈💖 sending loads of love ur way. thank u for being such a fantastic rat mummy & giving these lovely boys a wonderful life 💕
Eyelash glue a little screw top/ ball top piercing to your lip and test if you like a medusa
I freaked out at that clip from the room and kept replaying it. You're my favourite customer byeeeee!
Anyone know where her duvet cover is from? :)
Idk if you've had mouth piercings before, but I wouldn't  recommend it if you don't see yourself committed to it. Not that it wouldn't look good on you, but it can scar your face permanently
Can you please post a link to your ebay?
Hey Rhett & Link, I know this will get lost in the comments but, I just want to say I really appreciate this specific Wheel of Mythicality. I am Puerto Rican and while I live in Massachusetts I have quite a few family members who live in down there, including my grandfather from my dads side. He was hospitalized a week ago with an infection in his leg and because of the lack of medicine and resources the infection spread and they're gonna have to amputate it. You guys always put a smile and my face even in hard times and the fact that you guys take a moment to acknowledge and help those in need makes, me love you guys even more. From the bottom my heart, thank you, and you make me want to be my mythical best!
Great way to wake up laughing!

Aww.. you guys left out my favorite pumpkin item, the pumpkin cereal bar!
I don't like mint chocolate chip ice cream but LOVE pumpkin spice
Dose anybody else think why is Rhett not in the thumbnail it's always likn
You can give pumpkin to a dog for constipation
Glad you are all making money and stuff.... But just stop. Let this show be a good thing, before it turns into desperate.
The donation was so nice 😭💓💓
5:45 My dog was on a pumpkin only diet for a while for medical reasons, so yeah, dogs eat pumpkin.
Hey mythical crew, you guys rock and are one of the main reasons gmm is such a great thing; without your skills and everything you do on and off camera the show wouldn't have the same quality, emotions, and vibes. Keep it up guys and don't  get discouraged by rude people that forget they are insulting real people and are not aware of everything you guys do.
I don’t see the problem with the crew laughing
My god. I love Rhett and link but my respect for them just went way down. As an almost fluent Spanish speaker, I am offended that they got tortilla, the whitest Spanish word, wrong. if you do not know  the Spanish alphabet, the double L sounds like a Y.
Rhett:That's Good |Link:That's Bad | Link: Oooh, it gets better!
not everything pumpkin flavored has pumpkin spice in it.
They seem amped in this episode. Something's different--are they fighting?  Hope not...
Thank you so much for donating to  the maria disaster in puerto rico im really gratefull as im puerto rican but live in the U.S but i have family in puerto rico so thank you #levatandopuertorico
We like the laughing
Dogs actually love pumpkin and some added to their dog food helps harden poops if your dog is having the runs 😁 it's also just good for them in general if given the right amount
My mom and her husband just makes me feels weird...
Is that a jojo's reference?
My mom bought so many of the pumpkin things at traders Joes... I laughed at her when she showed all of them.
Watching this on Yom Kippur and I'm starving to death
During taste tests, Link is always high on something.....
Thank you for this funny video!
Rhett's hair is the most mythical thing on the set. Man his hair is beautiful
Link was NOT wearing that GMM shirt the entire time. LOL.
Admit it, who else looked back to see if link was wearing the shirt before?
u r from NC and u don't know what apple butter is?  Yuppie LOL
I'm new to this channel is there people laughing in the background??and why?
you should try to figure out the best brand of vanilla ice cream !!!
You guys should do a will it tamale!
I love pumpkin pie. I despise pumpkin spice. It tastes nasty.
Pumpkin ice cream from traders joes is the best
I appreciate crew laughter
I feel completely indifferent towards pumpkins 😂
2:05 - can you research greek-yogurts-popularity-is-harmful-to-the-environment please?
Dogs do eat pumpkin it is very good for them. Give them canned pumpkin for tummy troubles especially BTW...if anyone cares to know....
I'm only mad that they didn't do the pumpkin cereal
The pumpkin dog treats is for dogs who are constipated haha! It should be a regular thing in the pet area
Actually I like when the crew laughs
i immediately started clapping when they announced that they were donating the money to help people in puerto rico.
i LOVE the crew and all... but I do have to agree the laughs got a little annoying
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see. This is NOT Click Bait. Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K2XfdCjXfk
Everyone in the comments: The crew should stop laughing at funny things gOD\n\nMe: * laughs at everything Rhett and Link say *
I have never had any pumpkin spice product nor have I had any trader joes product.
They make all sorts of pumpkin based dog treats, and I think they purposely don't make the pumpkin noticeable.\n\nI get them for my rabbits, because the treats are vegan (bunnies don't eat meat) and full of stuff rabbits can have in moderation. They often come in fruit flavors, like apple, blueberry and banana.\n\nBut I think advertising the dog treatsas a pumpkin treat for fall is a gimmick. I suspect the treats taste the same. The pumpkins blend in with the rest of the flavors.
I broke my foot at my football game
10:56 Not really...\nNext episode tho, then they got high...
Haha, they're so comfortable with each other :) A great episode!
I love that they’re helping the people of Puerto Rico, nothing but respect for my presidents
isnt it that dogs shouldnt eat pumpkin? Or is it pumpkin seeds? :/
I wonder if a pallet cleanser between tastings would have affected the level of pumpkin spice detected.  It's possible the flavor on the dog biscuits and other stuff was lost from some of the other stuff they had already eaten.
i love pumpkins i love the smell of pumpkin spice. but i hate the taste unless its in a pie or in frozen yogurt is anyone with me🎃🎃🎃
Boring
EMMA CHAMBERLAIN DID THIS!
oldest giant coffe potin north america\n\ngirl i think you mean the only one
Let's see Stevie and Lizzie take it up the ass!
my dog loves pumpkin! one time we got a bumy pumkin and she kept biting the bumps off XD
hay friends please watch my video too :)\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhYxwVJBszQ&t=84s
u change so much
Kinda winging it here with the “pumpkin spice” thing - most of these items are just pumpkin flavour. 😕
Anyone else watching and reading comments
Wow. Trader Joe sure likes pumpkins!
I will never get the pumpkin spice hype... this video just showed that most of these are hella unnecessary and might not even taste good... 😂
I just realized that link looks like my paster at church 😊😂
GIMME ALL THE PUMPKIN!!!🎃🎃🎃🎃
You guys realize there is generic laughing in every facet of this type of comedy? Aside from movies everything you've watched has had laughing in the background. I hate people.
Went out and bought the Joe Joes after watching ... yum!
Is it me or was link rushing and being kinda rude?
I like your intro
Thanks for donating to UNICEF. Talk about being your mythical best!
So terrible to talk about cows like their lives mean nothing. The science is in: meat-eating is not sustainable. It's ruining our planet with methane, animal waste run-off and tailing ponds (see Barcelona's drinking water problem), resource depletion, and deforestation (40% of crops in the US are grown JUST to feed livestock). There are plenty of tasty, cruelty-free alternatives and absolutely no excuse to stick to a tradition that is pointless and harmful to this planet. And before you even mention health aspects, learn some basic biology (e.g. how proteins are formed, what essential nutrients are, how vitamers are metabolized) before looking like an uneducated fool.
Why do I get the feeling that that was the ONLY roadside coffee pot in America...
I think there should be some complaint filed to Trader Joe's about those dog treats, false advertising and all. Probably didn't think anyone would eat them.
That pumpkin butter is basically ginger butter. It’s disgusting.
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy, but we go where we want to. Anyone? No? No one gets the reference?
puerto rico is not a country..
He said tortiLLa the first time...
I don't know why people are complaining about the crew laughing in fact to me and all of my friends it makes it feel Lively not just two people commentating it gives it a more TV show feel I like it and I think they shouldn't stop them from laughing
A piece of me died when Link tore open the pumpkin bagel bag instead of opening from the top!
I love how serious Rhett takes things some of the time, and then there is Link, who is just kinda there and going along with whatever is happening. Kinda like a golden retriever, handsome, but not very bright.
Who's up for Starbucks
I see Trader Joes and I click. Literally.
We all know pumpkin spice is made by the mole people using their feet. USDA uses that Obama water that makes the frogs gay to clean off the dirt
i am so done with this pumpkin spice every thing  crazy
It's Halloween!!! 2spoopy4me
Try the trader joe’s pumpkin pop tarts
Hi subscrbe
Crew please
Rhett looks like Hugh jakmans, Logan
My mo makes pumpkin soup out of pumpkin butter along with some extra spices and it's sooooooooooooo good.
Marathi new pictucter
pumpkin spice pumpkin
earth is flat
Unsalted foods taste test!
All of Link’s dinks today were so aggressive
My mom's husband \nyou mean your dad?  lmao
Half these things aren't even pumpkin spice. They're just 'pumpkin'... there is a difference lol\n\nfun though
Stay in yøur lane bøy
Aw I love this video. It captures that warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you pick up a new book or finish a great one. Fantastic work, Sanne!
haha to all my school books....
So so beautiful <3
That was really sad! Beautiful, but sad.
This is so different from your usual videos but I absolutely love the different feel!\nAnd I can totally relate still. There are simply books we'll never read, for one reason or another.\nBut it's okay.
You just get more and more amazing.
This was lovely Sanne! Also makes me feel a lot better hearing of others who neglected some university reading 😂
We are doing Sherlock in 8th grade ( 9th year)
I absolutely adored this! I am also so heartbroken at how few books I have left to read.
Beautiful and I'm now depressed about how few books I still have time to read...
I loved this! Great video!
Wow!
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!! I'm in awe
I love this sooo much 💜
Where are the pillows around the 1 min mark from ? Love the print!
can i have the books that make me look impressive tho
You are beautiful, this is beautiful.
ONLY 3550??????? a;ldkfjaoisdjfakjbglajfldajs?!?!?!?! woah. That absolutely blew my mind. I need to reevaluate my life O_O
This was so beautiful ❤
Omg why did this make me tear up?! The feeeeeeeeeels !!!! 😢
That was like a love note to all books 😍☺️
Aww this is so cute 💕 absolutely love it!
So true! love this :)
Yes!!! I love this! Warmed my heart <3
This is such a wonderful video! Love the atmosphere ❤️
This is amazing. I love this so much! ❤️❤️❤️ I couldn’t agree more for this.
I absolutely loved this, well done!
This is so beautiful❤️
This is a very cute video, and something I can relate to as well. I loved the stop motion animation. Very nice job!
This so beautiful video!
Beautiful. But I got kind of freaked out by the book count. So many books, only one lifetime 😯
Beautifully made and very touching 💝
What a beautiful video!
This is so beautiful!
Such a beautiful video! I’m obsessed with the doodles 😍
Okay, this goes to one of my favourite youtube videos ever. LOVED IT.
I love the way you edited this video!!
This is so beautifully made. Thank you 😊 \nMay I ask what music you used in the background?
Such a wonderful video!
this is so lovely! 💛
Amazing video!!!! It's very different from what you usually do, I love it!
this is so cute!
Thank you for making this. Love it!
It hurts how clod your words are towards those books. If I've ever decided to do a video like this, I'd be crying because of how sorry I am.
Love this so much <3
This is so cute! Love it!
Sanne I have CHILLS. Also I can't bear the thought of how few books I'll get to read in my lifetime, I am reading as fast as I can!!
Such a beautiful video, I'm very moved and I don't even know why!
This is so great Sanne 💖
This is a beautiful video !
Sanne, this is soo beautiful! \nI can relate so much lol, although I don’t like giving up on books, they just wander back onto my to-read pile, in the hopes that I’ll eventually come back to them. Especially uni books. I doubt I ever will though. There’s way too many wonderful stories out there that are just waiting for me. :)
This puts me in the right mood for a reading weekend!
this is so beautiful :)
Wow Sanne that video is so great, I'm in love 😍😍
i LOVE this idea
Glad it wasn't just me who didn't read books that were part of a school/college/university course, I was supposed to read Great Expectations for my English Language and Literature A-Level, I never did, I didn't like it, not helped by the fact that it was a crumbling old copy last borrowed from school in 1974 (I started my A-Levels in 1999).
This made me emotional and idk why? Like I feel like I could cry. That was beautiful
I had a tear???? This was beautifullllllll! 💝
Fantastic! Loved this :)
This is amazing.
Cool!
Lovely truthful video.

THAT WAS SOOOO GREATTTTT!!!!!!!!
Thisss was lovely!
this was awesome!!!!
This is so lovely, Sanne!
Amazing!! <3
Wow this was amazing!
fuck the literary canon created by old, white, straight men. i'd rather be at a party discussing some queer poc authors or something than a book by obe everyone pretends to have read because some senile people think we have to.
This is brilliant😁 ILOVEILOVEILOVE❤❤❤
Lovely video, Sanne! As I get older I think about this more and try to both read more and not waste time on things I don't really enjoy. I have to add, though, that you should give Middlemarch a chance - it's absolutely full of interesting characters and a world you can absolutely get lost in!
this is beautiful! you should be very proud of it.
You should really try some games :) They're fun!
I am a Austin Evans FAN \nI was just watching Austin's channel and I came across this\nAustin or that weirdo Sara Dietschy tell me are you both GF BF \nif that is true \nHOLY SHIT
Why is there no intake fans?
Try to get an ultrawide IPS monitor to take full advantage of editing on that beast of PC. \n\nFor keyboard and mouse there are a ton of options and it really comes that to what you like or matches your setup better but I would just go with a mechanical keyboard with cherry mx switches and you could even get wireless peripherals to have a more clean set up.
Who tf is this?
Look just NO further! :) Use your 1080 to its full potential! :) (Y)\n\nMonitor:   Acer Predator XB271HU Monitor\n\nMouse:  I have 3 choices------\n1--Logitech G903\n2--Corsair M65 Pro RGB\n3--Corsair Scimitar RGB\n\nKeyboard:  3 choices for this one too! \n1--Corsair Gaming K95\n2--Corsair Gaming K95 RGB PLATINUM[Mechanical]\n3--Corsair K70 LUX RGB.\nLet me know what YOU and other ones think! :) Peace from India! :) :)
Monitor: Asus PG27UQ, a 4K decent gaming monitor, perfect for video editing\nK&M: Razer Blackwidow Chroma V2 (yellow switch) and Razer Deathadder Elite\nHeadphone: Sennheiser Game One\n*Can you do a peeling plastic of that side panel video coz its been bugging the hell of me
For the monitor Go for an ultrawide monitor (21:9) if you can, they are great for editing and go for the highest refresh rate or (hz) you can\n\nFor the mouse and keyboard probably the mx master mouse and any mechanical keyboard that fancys you
Bying a Keyboard and Mouse is a huge preference. It depends upon what you're doing exactly. \nHere are few examples.\nMechanical keys - LOUD, like really LOUD, but sturdy and last longer. Keys able to be changed/replaced easily. Popular among gamers who bash buttons. Always expensive due to the materials used. A bit overpriced, too! Go for either Razer of Corsair ones.\n\nMembrane based keyboard - Different variations to choose from. Slightly loud, but not as much as mechanical ones. Most common ones used worldwide for typing and offices. Choosing one is simply a matter of search what's available. \n\nScissor-based keyboards - The most silent ones out there. Notable mention are Natec Genesys RX22 and Red Dragon Karura K502. Very silent, my personal favorites, very cheap, too! They're good for both gaming and typing alike. Think >laptop buttons< type. \n\nThere are membrane x mechanical keyboards, but I think that's just stupid. I choose keyboards based on their sound since I prefer things to be kind of silent due to the music I listen to, and I think that functionality is far better than elegance/sturdiness of a keyboard. \n\nAs for the MICE you want to choose - think SENSORS. Find the best optical sensors and sticks with them. I personally use Razer DeathAdder Elite and it's an amazing MICE. \nYou want to pick a MICE that suits your HAND LENGTH and feels comfortable to work with. Visit the channel of Rocket Jump Ninja, the best MICE reviews out there.
I cam here from an austin evans vid, not disappointed.
i have that cpu and mobo
i would get a lg 4k monitor and razer peripherals
That giant ass....\n\n\n\nwhat? i am talking about heatsink
I think Austin just wants to fuck
Lofree keyboard and MX master  mouse from Logitech. i think it will suit your style 😂 thumbs up if you get one. 👍👍 @techtwinkie on twitter.
Don't forget to take the plastic sheet off the case screen. Otherwise it looks awesome!
if you're spending 2,700 dollars on a PC, you'll want a mechanical keyboard. I have a Razer Blackwidow ultimate, with razer green switches. i found a guide to the different switches https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPbGZRouc8Q
Keyboard - obviously mechanical. I'd personally recommend the WASD V2. I got one over a year ago, and it has held up very well. It's a bit pricier than a lot of other mechanical keyboards, but it's built really well, has an elegant and minimalist look, and has insane customization from the factory. You can easily match your purple / white / black aesthetic and customize the legends. (Although it might have a slightly different shade of purple.) You've also got tons of switch options, but you'll probably want to look mostly at the Cherry MX Brown, Blue, or Clear switches.\n\nMouse - I use the Logitech G602. It's pretty handy since it has 6 thumb buttons with per-application customization. The MX Master is also really good and comfortable, more designed for general productivity than gaming.\n\nMonitor - IDK, probably a nice ultrawide or 4K IPS panel or something. My monitors are trash, so you probably don't want to take advice from me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i always hate that cooler although i know its a decent air cooler. The style is just so bulky haha
Hey Austin leave some pussy for the rest of us, please?
Sara, make sure you remove the plastic from the case window. The cooling inside your pc won't really be affected by it, it just looks better.\n\nAs for suggestions:\nI'd definitely go with the Logitech MX Master for the mouse. It has many features that can be used for editing purposes, and can go wireless so it would work with your macs as well.\nI heavily reccomend Corsair keyboards. They're mechanical and come with different switches which change the force needed for a keypress to register, as well as the sound they make. The one you were using with Austin in the video is a Corsair keyboard. They also have RGB backlighting, which PC gamers love.
get a MXmaster mouse. by far the best for editing.
Here's advice on a monitor, from a PC user gone Mac user and who now uses both: Get an ultrawide. I also edit with Premiere, and had two monitors for a long time... Then I got the ultrawide and boom. Never want to use anything else again. And since you're editing/color grading, get something IPS. I got the ASUS PG348Q, but this and the Acer Predator X34 are fine choices. They are currently the top notch ultrawides used by most.
You will love the logitech mx master for a mouse
NEC or Eizo monitors for what you do.
Do a Hackintosh tutorial for that rig.
Since this is your *First* PC build with him, when will the second one come? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Love this colab! You guys are so cute!
For peripherals go with Logitech. They're the best out there. Especially for editing - MX Master 2S will blow your mind. \nAs for monitors - 34 ultrawides from LG. You'll love it.
How about some comparision between ur macbook and this build. U know tell us is it working the way u imagined or not. Did u faced some problems with it afterwords???
That cpu cooler is bigger than my future
as someone whose more into the tech community than this neck of the woods. this is a colab i never thought id see
just get a 34 lg ultrawide monitor and you can die happily then...
AUSTIN LOOKS KINDA NERVOUS !!!
That cooler is fucking huge
Get sleeved cables.:)
Builds first PC....uses inferior CPU....
Colab on crack
Awesome collaboration!!!!!  Keep it up......
double entendres abound in this video
Congratulations, Sara. Good job !
Play pubg
Thats an awesome build!
Sara, my favorite productivity monitor:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/LG-38UC99-W-38-Inch-UltraWide-Bluetooth/dp/B01LW54S4U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1506906035&sr=8-1&keywords=LG+38UC99-W+38-Inch+21%3A9+Curved+UltraWide+QHD%2B+IPS+Monitor
Monitor:\nLG 38UC99-W\nOr\nDELL UltraSharp U3818DW\n\nMouse:\nLogitech MX Master 2S\n\nKeyboard:\nLogitech G613
Razer Naga Chroma Mouse with programmable buttons for editing :)
Very nice, looks good.
yay!
10/10 would bang..... her ofc
Mac users are too dumb to build and assemble a PC
I don't know specific models, but definitely get a good mechanical keyboard; you gotta treat your fingers.. :)
Hey Austin this is guys
I love how you said Tech-Nology
Great collab, was fun watching you guys! \nLogitech performance mx master 2 mouse and the Logitech craft keyboard would serve you excellently. And the LG 34um88-p would perfectly complete the setup. Enjoy your new PC!
I know that you probably wont see this but you are really pretty and you seem like a really nice person. Have a great day :)
The best monitors for editing would be the ones with the most color accuracy, you can just google the best ones :)
for editing mouse: Logitech MX Master is the best for productivity personally, corsair k95 platinum is the best alsow personally, even if i prefer a laptop keyboard so i use the deathstalker chroma.\nHope i helped
Try a Linux system
Fun stuff :) Awesome job. Welcome to the PCMR side :)
Well, really nice job! I also builded my own pc's. The last one is from end 2008. I switched to the Mac in 2009. Today i'm using a Macbook Pro retina mid 2012 and a decked out Mac Pro 2013. Which is perfectly fine for what i want to do, (working with logic pro and final cut pro). I understand that you are still in search of a mouse and some other peripherals.\n\nNow, for the keyboard, there are so so many (good) choices that is something up to you.\n\nI know the mechanical keyboards from Corsair are very popular as are their mouse/mice's.\n\nNow, for a mouse/mice in particular, i know the Logitech MX Master Mouse 2 is very very good for editing. Not sure if you already own that one or not.\n\nAs far as monitors go, again, there are so many, but i know LG ultra wide's are very popular in the pc and actually mac world too :-)\n\nHope's this helps a bit. I'm not sure how big you want the monitor to be, personally, i would go from anywhere from 29 to 34 (when you would take an ultra wide). I don't think i would want to go bigger for a pc monitor, you can just as well hook up a tv at that point (if going bigger). You could also take a look at ASUS or Dell, they have both great monitors in more normal sizes too.
U both look good together👍
So, Austin is not a virgin anymore?
0:33 Austin Evans..... I thought it was Austin ekans😏
John Hill in the background, amazing 12:48
0:59 Austin be like :\nU are not the guy , u are not capable of being the guy , i had a guy but now i dont :)
Nice work Sara and welcome to the pc comunity by the way
Okay that was awesome! I sleep, eat, and DREAM pc's. so to Sara, John and Austin. watch bitwit where kyle and austin do a speed build on a $700,000 boat.  but sara. the my setup of monitors. for 980ti (last gen of flagship graphic cards). i run 3 22 1080p and 1 55 LG 4K IPS super UHDTV. model number 55UH7700 or 55UH77. I currently watch all my youtube and play rocket league, and then on the graphic creation side of things. Ill use it to check colors. till I update my triple monitors to something better. but dont just limit yourself to just one monitor.
The logitech mx Master s2 is a very good mouse for video editing, and usually i would recommend any of the mechanical keyboards from Razer or Corsair.
Hey Sara . . . for the monitor I use the LG 27UD88 . . . its a beautiful monitor  and I would also recommend the LG 43UD79 because its pretty much got the same features of the 27UD88 in a giant 43 inch screen and thats it . . .
I bet he uses a floppy
You should buy an Acer Predator X34 monitor, razer blackwidow chroma v2 keyboard or a corsair k95 platinum. And for mouse I would recommend Razer lancehead, or a logitech g903, and maybe even a razer deathadder elite.
You should probably just a get a Logitech mx master mouse. Keyboards are pretty based on preference, I don't much like mechanical ones but you might. For a monitor you should get a professional 4k monitor that is color accurate. Idk a model in particular.
For that mouse, Logi MX Master 2S all the way. A bit pricey, but worth it.
Sara you are amazing. Was that Austin's camera recording you during the build or your own?
You should do a vs between your MacBook and this New PC, and show the difference to all those blindfolded Apple lovers. I liked that you realize there's a lot of products outside Apple that do the same or better and are cheaper. and I say yes you should explore them. \nFor Mouse I recommend the MX Master it's great for productivity and editing and you should look into some LG 4k monitors do your research there are so many channels about tech. Ask them look into their forums and discussions. The tech world is huge and not just Apple products. Keep going.\n Pd: can't wait to see John's PC tho :v
No way, we have the same case XD
I actually went backwards went to Mac platform from Windows, ended up building up the old Mac Pro (last good Mac desktop). 3.46Ghz 12 core cpu, 128Gb of ram! check out the specs, prices and process. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YdpN1kk2Wk&t=940s\n\nI also use premier pro cc, and this build owns my pc that was built several years ago. Highly recommend the mx masters or the mx masters 2s mouse. It is by far my favorite mouse of all time. I grew up with windows pc and always been a windows guy, but am now realizing what the Mac hype is all about. Although I'll always have a spot for windows, OS X and program optimization is amazing.
I got the same motherboard x370 with the 1800x for a streaming box. Only issue with the build is i can't get the ram to run over 2133. I bought vengence lpx 16gb 3200. Even after 5 bios updates can't get it running still faster then 2133. other then that it's top notch. I stream at 1080P 60fps on medium with x264 on obs.
Sara, you are the ultimate girl next door. 👍
Just use your Mac monitors. Grab the necessary cables and hook it up.
get the mionix castor mouse
U look dope
Great video!!! amazing collaboration! show us the final setup when u have ir ready!!! stay peachy!!
I definitely recommend the Logitech MX Master series of mice. Great for editing!
Who this woman?

I'll pay for that wall and build it with my own hands! Tony Ferguson
Just one wicked Werdum knee on T-Ferg’s chin and he’s done like Lombard, when Hendo put his lights out...
Wearing glasses and a hood  on the hat !! Very nervous , uncomfortable and scared . Duhhh
Tony trying to act like he was gonna do something !!!! Werdum would of dismantle him!!!!
Werdum was about to KO his ass... lol
Ferguson has been a tool since he came on the scene on TUF. Dudes a kook
Tony hijo de tu puta madre ferguzon
Hey have fun fighting on my under card LOL end of battle.
Since he appeared in TUF he showed he was a piece of crap
Werdum said conor would tee off on you
Ferguson pau no cu do carajo!!!
Animo cukuy Ferguson
Tony Ferguson💪💪 goat
Fabricio bad energy werdum
Werdum would kill tony...
Ferguson=Honeybadger\n\nWerdum=Tiger
That douche
Weight classes, judges, ppv ruin the UFC
É isso aí werdum. Acabá com esse cu de cachorro kkkkkkk
Tony Black Energy Ferguson
Whoa tony, easy man, thats werdum, the guy that subbed fedor and tuned up and subbed cain.
Kayate tu puta madre and he even didnt stand up wtf
Wolf tix
hehehehehehehehe
...tu puta madre maricon , hahaha, priceless!!!
Tony vs Werdum could have happened in the old UFC days.
I didn't know Kev is Mexican?!
If Werdum can beat Cain, he can easily swat Tony around.
Tony really trying to be Conor 😂
Verdum is a coward picking I fight with a smaller fighter
So what got in Werdums panties? Dude was more trigger then anything ive seen in awhile.
Tony is so Bs, he not even could make a point on the interview   After almost got crushed by Verdun, super funny 🤣🤣
he's channeling conor..lol.....why not.
LOL  I doe say nutin cause I'm heavy weight oh no
I don't like fake people coming from ferguson is the biggest irony ever
have fun fighting on my undercard.    -Ferguson.
I think verdum has a ADHD problem, this guy is not matured
Ferguson doesn't think he's fake? He has one of the most affected, uncomfortable, personalities in the UFC. Everything about him is fake
Tony doesn't know how to speak Spanish
Tony looked like  a hobbit next to verdum. I like Ferguson and hope he wrecks Kevin Lee.
werdum would kill him in 10 seconds
Werdum picks on smaller guys to make himself feel better for that 1st round KO loss to p4p king #stiopic #immigrantmentality
Hahaha Ferguson is out of his mind. He looks stressed out for some reason, werdum can probably brake his arms and put him in coma in seconds.
Now I want to watch Kevin Lee and Derrick Lewis to win their fights for sure.
why did tony say that thing about kicking werdums ass there mustve been some background story here
Werdum would of killed his ass
I would have to go with werdum whooping his ass
Someone tell me what werdum was saying  please
I EMBRACE THE CRINGE GOD TONY
Haha one light jab from werdum and he would be asleep 😂 😂
Tony Ferguson vs Kevin Lee, the battle of the the Cringe. Who will take the cringey  throne and become the cringest of them all?
UFC fans should go back too WWE.\nWAAAAAAH WAWAWA WAAAAH beta
Poker player vs Real Brazilian champ...hmmm)
aiai.. sou brasileiro...\n\ne achei a atitude do Werdum uma grande babaquice, tão ruim quanto à do outro idiota chamado Ferguson.\n\nComo dizia o poeta: o inferno e o cemitério estão cheios de valentões...'
Ferguson se acha a estrela... só que não ...
We're gonna just pretend like Werdum didn't just try to cut him off mid sentence?
So Ferguson says he'd kick Werdums ass if he had to. Werdum gets offended and mouths off. Then Ferguson plays the victim by saying Werdums trying to fight a small 155 pounder? I'm giving this one to Werdum.
https://youtu.be/eHmbO6s1DmU
Damn tony keeping his composure . That's dope
Go agent smith
Cabron hahahhaha i like his Spanish
Fabricio is a slimeball .
Smelly Brazilian like his country..
tony carayusen
Werdum's jealous of Ferguson's gourmet green juice.
Tony made werdum take a few steps back when he stood up
What i'm trying to say is... What I'll like to say is... hahaha
I'll ankle pick you...that was funny.
dont mess with brazilians or they will pull out your teeth! 😂👊
Werdum can kill Ferguson in a 10 seconds
Thought Ferguson handled himself well.
CÚ DE CACHORRO KKKKKKKKKKKKKK
tony dark matter ferguson
Sou fã do werdum mano! Kkkkkk ele é sinistro!
Tony is a G.Real
lol ankle pick werdum? werdum would crush your throat in a heartbeat
maybe cos Tony cutting 30lbs while Werdum can eat popeyes with DC cos he got 265lbs allowance
Why is Tony Ferguson is built like Crash Bandicoot? lol
1:18 Ferguson to Werdum: Shut up before I ankle pick you!!\n\nYea good luck with that homie. \nLmfao
Werdum is right...Tony is different in front of camera...
If you look close...Tony Ferguson has bigger hands than Werdum WTF???
why does verdum say i dont like bisping all the time
hold on I'm talking brother -- what a preppy, street thing to say. Some elements of hood in here.
Tony Fergunson is a great fighter.\nBut he acted like a douchebag on this one. He was the one who idiotically provoked this beef.
subtitles would be good
Fabricio 110 kg Tony 70 kg.
El cucuy 😍😜👹
Kkkkk
wtf is tony talking about.. he doesnt like people who dont run as hard as him and those who didnt give him ice for an ice bath?
Its impossible not to like Werdum
Stfu werdum.. Or Stipe will come there and crash u like a blob
Damn! Tony's Spanish is awful!!! Werdum is such a tool! I hope Lewis KO  him the fudge out!!!
Lol i think the mistake is in the interviewer\nWhy they interview both guy in the same place with different question and camera lol
Hahah Werdum picking a fight in 3 languages
Fergie ferg trying to hype himself like mcgregor does. Cringy.
Cara como eu ri do Werdum,isso é homem de verdade lutador por isso  que gosto dele kkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Werdum switched to Spanish to Portuguese real quick! Guy is truly gifted with speaking all these different languages at one time lol
Tony u not even close to what verdum has achieved..SFU
That idiot should learn how to speak English  stupid no respect   have some class and be civilised  you stupid puta   English English English if you can't speak English don't speak rubbish lol lol lol looser

I learned something today...  Juggalos are actually pretty cool.  Wow.  Still don't know how magnets work, but I do believe in miracles now.
insane clown president was actually pretty fucking funny
I respect ICP for what they have achieved, all the while being the least talented rappers ever to grab a microphone.  Malibus most wanted guy was like kendrick compared to them lol.  I always praise them for what they have accomplished.  Hustle and flow......minus the flow. They have an incredible work ethic and believe in what their doing.  But juggalos calling the FBI inbred.......C'MON MAN!  If you take half of all the juggalos that gather each year at the festival.  And sign them up with ancestry.com. Id bet they all come from 5 different blood lines MAX.  The ancient Jugalos defs succeeded in keeping that blood line pure.  So much so, that when one hot woman attended the gathering they through their shit on her! (admit it.......tila tequila was once hot)  Inbred see.....inbred do!
if you go to a trump rally there's a high probability to be hurt or killed but if you go to a juggalo march you just get high as fuck and a 2 liter of faygo
This was everything I wanted and more. What a community and what a video
I hate literally everyone filmed in this video.
Jesus, who let the ginger out of his closet.
Where the fuck you have been JOE?
Thank you for this upload joe
Why you have to get all political every time?
props for still makin quality vids even though all of them are basically demonetized
This is honestly one of the best darn videos I've ever seen on youtube. These jeffalos are so sweet and Joe is good at doing his program Joe Goes.
the juggalos seem a lot more rational than trumptards.
I could see LBJ being a Juggalo
TO THE JUGGALO at 1:54 what other fanbase has been discriminated like that? Oh Manson Fans got blamed for Columbine, Judas Priest got blamed and sued for those kids shooting their faces off with a shotgun, and Slayer fans get pretty much blamed for being satanists every day soooo stop bitching
8:07 Gabe has to go home.
they're a bunch of fucking weirdos but at least they embrace it and roll with the stereotypes, bit of respect for that
Honestly It's hypocritical ; they listen to horrorccore  rap which describes beheading people,  stabbing people, collecting heads, and murdering children yet they claim to be the nicest people on earth liker one big family, it's really stupid.half of these motherfuckers are obviously on hard drugs; yeah real great culture to raise your kids in :/. bTW looks like violent Jay lost a lot of weight ;)
Sounds like furries trying to justify their degeneracy.
It's all about love, acceptance, and family. Their Family.  I know some juggalos and I'm different from them and they ignore me or call me names for not agreeing with everything they do. I'm Disabled so it feels good to be hated for no reason.
Thank you for this joe.... I mean dad
whoop whoop! fresh as fuck ninja, lookin forward to the outtakes.
ALL I WANT IS A FAT BITCH NAMED BRIDGETTE
WHO DID YOU VOTE FOR?!?! @joegoes most underrated channel
1. Joe has BARS\n2. Girl with the hat and dreads is adorable
Juggaloes are nice people, but they are really, really stupid. Seriously, I'm not joking, if you are open minded or a very accepting person. They are seriously lacking in intelligence generally speaking. Just listen to the music. It's unquestionably retarded. No one can or will challenge me on this. I am right. Goodbye retarded but nice juggaloes. Listen to someone smarter than you .
That redhead kid just needs a friend
People don't even know what juggalettes and juggaloes even are. *Listens to what is a juggaloe by ICP. Well they sound like lovely people.
we love you, Joe.
Ruining my reputation by proving there are more literate juggalos than just myself?!  For shame!
Juggalos are cool people. One of the only people I kept in contact with after high school is a Juggalo. He doesn't drink, doesn't do drugs and works with at risk kids. He was one of the only people who had the balls to call me on my shit about my Heroin use. Went to the Gathering with him a couple years back, it was so much fun. I don't care for ICP, but most Juggalos are pretty decent people.
I got the Juggalo juice ! I still listen to the music,  such good fun , I'm down with the Clown ! 😂😂😍😍❤ Respect ICP😍❤
Juggalos are the weird kid in school, all grown up.
‘The most diverse group of White people, you’ll ever meet’ LMFAO
I only know Joe as the normy who gets amongst the Ninjas. Legendary Buttery Mother Fucker.
the white retards matter movement is what this should be called. these people are the lowest of low life scum around. this music group should just tour the slum trailer parks of america because thats where their fans live. they are classified as a gang because of  its very common for them to act out like these examples: http://www.ranker.com/list/10-most-violent-juggalo-attacks-ever/michael-gibson    how many food stamp card holders do you think are in this march?
Icp trying to latch onto the victimhood movement... Grow the fuck up
Disliked because of the censorship. Fuck that.
Fsu has it just as bad same with sosf and courage crew
I'd love to see Joe in Wolfpac.
I BETTER BE IN THE FUCKIN' VIDEO
If you have a Hatchet on your car , you deserve to be pulled over.
Are you censoring your shit now because of Ads?
Wow....the first time I heard of insane clown posse was back in 96’, s dude from my work was into them, I listened to them for 5 minutes and all they talked about was clown life and hacking up people ....I guess rapping about drugs and gang life is more tolerable....ISP is laughable and demented.
Have to say they seem like pretty nice folks.
You looked so done with that ginger dude haha!
THIS GUY SOUNDS LIKE HE IS DEEP THROATING BLACK DICKS WITH A FIST UP HIS ASS
Joe made it on trending... Thats a start. .3.
Damn. Joe is still making the same stuff huh. Persistence pays off I guess :)
17:36 one more to add to the outro?
The Juggalo stereotype: Dr. Pepper drinkin’, cigarette smoking, trailer park white trash fan base. I’m not a juggalo, but the fans have a strong sense of comradery and that’s chill...
Fittest bunch up in the cut
Mankini makes it look like a gay pride parade and nope..it makes a joke of what juggalo was when I started..... Mne !!!
I am the Juz Bling. Thanks Joe!\nHere's some of my music!\nhttps://youtu.be/XkHx2Bewj9c
Someone please tell these people the difference between a hatchet and a meat cleaver
Can you go a video without spewing your liberal bullshit
9:52 I’m the guy in the back petting the dog
I love that Joe is now an official Juggalo celebrity. The look on his face as he slowly realises that these are his people now.
#JUGGALONATION

This had some of the best tweets and replies yet!
17 million views in 6 days. Damn!
Every shade of your mom's lipstick......and her butthole. BEST CLAPBACK, EVER!!!!!!
Best and probably only good part of the show!
So they didn't address the zionists comments related to gal?
Kumail Nanjiani's was the best for last. :)
Whats up can you guys please help me get my name out there i post videos weekly and i promise i will have 1 mill subs one day so join medotv now and help me hit 50 subs for now lol
Jake Gyllenhaal has the most punchable face of all time I think you meant 2nd. Emma Watson deserves first place in that category.
i’m simple, i see gal gadot, i click
the old illuminati public humiliation ritual.
If you listen closely, at 2:49 you can hear the laugh tack cut out after Kumail Nanjiani says “Yes”.
Jennifer Lawrence is so down to earth...
Does anyone here besides me feel this would be *way* funnier if they just featured an uncensored version of these?
Im a simple person. i see Gal Gadot, I click.
“Is Kimail Nanjiani’s d**k multiple colours”\nKumail: “Yes, every shade of your mums lipstick”\n\nSAVAGE! 😂😂😂😂☠️
WTF! I didn't know it is OK for them to fire back
I didn’t even roast Kumail but his roast hit me right deep in the feels
It was about time damn  it!
Put cleavage in the thumbnail and you'll get all the views?
Emma Watson looks many years older in this video. Magic is real.
Can we please get a Game of Thrones Edition?
i'm in love with gal gadot
The last guy's response was hilarious!  That was a good clap back lol
That last response was the BEST one that show will ever have
kumail nanjiani just ended a mf's life
They're perfect Gal, don't worry.
The size of Dave’s chapelles head does look off now.
gal gadot makes me  feel some type of way , give a like if she does the same to you everyone.
Yea, Anyway I would like to see families and all people focus less on DISTRACTING THEMSELVES WITH FOOTBALL / SPORTS TO MUCH with all it's related drinking alcohol and over stuffing there big bellies with more meat 🍖 than they could ever hope to digest (which leads to overly high acidity levels causing mucus which causes an obstruction to the flow ie the body's ability to clean itself to maintain health - then leading to CANCER , which is on the rise) and focus more towards LOVE ❤️, there children and spouses, unity leading naturally to a better life for everyone. Please everyone try to start seeing that the medical industry only profits from keeping people sick.  I know it sucks to think the doctors are in on it but it sucks more to see children born sick and 1 of 2 people getting cancer now. Eat more fresh organic fruits and vegetables uncooked and fell your energy rise and your head clear and your weight balance out back to normal. Watch 10 or 20 videos of the life-regenerator on YouTube and take a look at DrMorseND in Florida videos on YouTube although he talks fast because his videos are for doctors of his naturopathic school, however Dan Macdonald liferegenerator on YouTube is fun and on point. Peace everyone 🙏🌿🍊💕
I'm only here cause I'm bored HAHAHAHA
Well Jennifer... I think they watched your movies...
sad part is it's funnier than their writers
Every shape of your mom's lipstick. Hahaha
Those were the most boring tweets I've ever read
I'm a simple guy, I see hot girl with nipple, I click
The only reason I came here is because my father told me to come, and also that gal gadot was on the thumbnail
“ yes, every shade of your moms lipstick... and but hole”💀 their reaction were awesome❗️😂
The last one LMAO
Clicked video to see if they would include a Trump tweet and call it mean..... guess what....
The last one was funny
Idk who the last guy is but he’s a total savage 😂
Gal gadot's really hot when she struggles to read
Ouch! I felt that last one!
Kumail Nanjiana:A comeback for the ages.\nI liked Michael Keaton's too
that last one was a hell of a damn comeback holy crap xD
Saved the best for last ! 😂💀👏🏾
I am not much of a movie goer, but Gal Gadot made my day in Wonder Woman, and it is amazing that they permitted her to be a brunette!  Brunettes are stunningly beautiful too!  Never mind what ignorant, rude people say!  You were chosen because you are an excellent actress and more!  God bless you!
Noticing michea keaton says : in YOUR mouth. good man
lol I like the one with Emma Watson! I'm going to be doing a movie review on my channel about Beauty and the Beast. LESS HATE MORE LOVE you guys!
Love u Emma Watson
Gal Gadot! So beautiful!

testing testing..
Omg Gal is so adorable😂😍❤️
kumail nanjiani's epic comeback. Lol
Gal Gadot is hottest woman alive rn
Japanese people Don't Know is the WEAKEST excuse I have ever heard.
This guy is awesome and he's talented. Not much to do with his skin color to become a celebrity.
 he's a rare Pokemon LMFAO
What they don't tell you is that they make him act dumb all the time, sane with Bobby Olugun, and the other Black famous actors on Japan, to poke fun at Black people so it isn't as good as they make it seem
*Two homosexual black I guess*
Isn't this video a replay from like five months ago?
I like him.
Sadly no one will remember him by this time next year, like the formerly famous Atsugiri Jason.
you'll see, when Africa will be 4 times more populated by the end of this century, you'll regret to call them rare pokemon : Visiting Europe you'll only see blacks.
Japanese :  oh my god, it a nergo
I'm not surprised, Nigerians are a vibrant community in Japan. If I recall I know of a Nigerian boxer whose a daytime talkshow host there and is also fluent in Japanese. I forgot his name but some may know it.
Breaking racial barriers in Japan. Very cool.
@0:18 \nRick? Is that you?
they are not racists they just don't know wtf
A Brain and a Shell. The Brain can be trained to do anything. But we can't look pass the Shell, The Color.
dont accept multiculturalism japan, you'll regret it
Sweet talk, “I don’t think Japanese are racists”. Dream on! Try to settle in Japan outside the world of entertainment ....
Damn, these Vice reporters know so many languages it blows my mind. I can barely handle one, and they seem to know whatever needs to be spoken.
I wish you could go into even more depth. Double this segment! Maybe Japan is more use to seeing white guys, but over in China that wasn't the case for me. Everyone would stare at me like I'm a walking museum. I would have people ask if they could take a picture with me at least once a week. Mind you, I wasn't living in the big major cities (Bejing, Shanghai, Guangdong). They'd get weirded out even more when I'd start speaking in Mandarin. They'd still try speaking English to me even when I'd respond in Mandarin. I definitely get what he's saying about the 'train thing' and no one sitting next to you. It's a bit weird...
Whyd they bringin whites into this. Bruv it meant to be black vs asians.
This is awesome 👏🏽 you gotta start somewhere and yes kids tv is probably the best place.
pokemon or no pokemon, get that money bruuuuh!
The hair and pokeman comment was funny! Lol
I just wanna know how the women are treating him over there ;)
There’s that chef hat hairdo again. Lose it already. It’s your job to report the news not be the news!
This vice guy is way funnier than the guy in the video. And not just in japan, his brand of humor transends all borders and barriers.
He's a rare pokemon. 😂
The interviewer's hair is distracting & looks stupid, & he's stupid for keeping that in a job like this.
so what i can speak scottish english and american lol
Seriously? 4 min for this shit? You want us to watch it or not?
I want to learn Japanese.  Sounds cool
Bobby ologun is my favorite black tv personality in japan
Why did you feel the need to mention he's black? I'm I supposed to give a shit?
Thumbs down for not putting or saying his name almost anywhere.
It's a good thing you really hammer home the fact that he's black.  Really touches the identity high notes.\n\nThe interviewer reminds me of Kid 'n Play.
Something i thought I'll never see, two Black guys speaking Japanese
he appears as tho he doesnt want to be in the kids show... so low energy
The crazy thing is that he didn't study Japanese before getting a job there, yet his fluency is so good.
Vice has the most unique segments\nSeriously interesting stuff
2 black guys speaking fluent japanese. I love this
I can be famous just for being black and speaking japanese.\n\n*on the fucking plane now*
this guy is too cool
the thing is Japanese girls like BBC
It may seem irrelevant but I must point out that on the daytime show oha sta he is the only male on the set wearing something ridiculous! Baby steps for equality I assume....
This will give a lot of filthy weeaboos  hope lmao.
Not only this guy but both Jero an Enka singer and Chris Hart  a J-pop singer are accepted and very popular in Japan as well.\nJapanese people might be xenophobia on the whole for sure, but seems like most of them are not racist.\nJust examine the Art Blakey's anecdote, or W.E.B.Du Bois' column he wrote for The Pittsburgh Courier.
to black guys speaking Japaneses in Japan thats a big deal
I am sick and tired of hearing about this multiculturalism bullshit everyday! Stop! just STOP!!!
Ok why is japan bad for not accepting so many foreigners??
Boy! 2017, Trump is President and this guy is getting famous in Japan, anything is possible! Tune in next week to meet the juggling gay amputee couple that're taking Russia by storm!
Congrats on being made fun of dude
Bruh I respect your story and everything but what is up with that line up my guy? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
That is weird, I've now seen 3 black guys speaking fluent Japanese in less than a week. 2 on this video, & one on some PBS show about Japanese textiles.
REALLY good video. I had NO idea things were like this over there.
*I get the impression they're laughing at him, not with him.*\nI'm also getting the impression that he knows that and Vice knows this, and they tried to film this in a way that didn't show that.
>used to work for goldman sachs\nKILL THE BOURGEOISIE
Japan here I come
Japanese would be smart to kick him out
Nothing special about it. Just one black dude being on Japanese tv show. So what?  Yes, of course he should be able to speak Japanese he lives in Japan.
Can I find a video on YouTube with racist comments from white people ??
What a bunch of weaboos
Dang, they're still sporting jheri curls in Japan.
Hell no not this long hair dude again. Viceeeeeeeeeeeeee
Still an outsider who is nothing but a clown
I am very surprised when I hear the host speak Japanese, because I just heard him speak mandarin in the higher brothers video. Like I'm native chinese and have learnt japanese for 4 years and its obvious that this Dexter's Mandarin and Japanese are native level, like he doesnt even have that foreigner accent
“They don’t know how to do black hair” 😂💀.
good for you brotha! ✊🏾
What a trailblazer!
誰こいつ？
He a mark
niggu?\nneegeiru?
That's funny seeing two black dudes conversing in Japanese. \n\nそれは会話2人の黒い男を見て面白いです
4:30 nigga please hahaha
Same shit in Estonia tho
this dude seems like a caricature smfh
looks like Josh from JKparty😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dude looks miserable
Good for him. 👍
wait whos this dexter thomas guy?
Wut he a gud boi. Din do nothin
Naija forever!
My god shes beatiful
He has nice lips
Guys the original Weaboo
Impressive! Keep on keeping on!
Haha that Pokemon joke cracked me up bad 😂😂😂
Both these niggas wild for these hairstyles
In American black people are pokemon...why you think police and prisons are always tryin to catch em all?!
No diversity send in a sjw feminists and bicycle lives matter!!
I greatly respect anyone who paves the way for diversity and give talented people a platform despite what others may say about it.
No racist but class segregation  & discrimination, which is unfortunate in Japan.\nAlso Japanese shop owners are subject to yakuza protection. Women are still 2nd class.\nGood & bad in Japan.
My cousin live in japan (shes black), when she goes out into the public people ask her Can i touch your skin? or Can i touch your kids?. What do you think about that?
if i remember correctly there was a black samurai that worked for oda nobunaga and people from all around japan would go to see him to the point where some people got trampled to death, i think some servants of nobunaga when they first met tried to see if they could wash the black off of him, probably need some fact checking on that but im pretty sure those are things that happend
Many people hate perfumes in Japan. So when you come to Japan for sightseeing, we hope in half of usual.
Nigga stole ma bike
They forgot to ask him the most important question. Who in the right mind leaves Goldman Sachs for some talent agency?
wtf\ndisgusting !! niggerz , go home , yankee bastard metis inbred pig , go home , kaijin , shine , zenmetsu , kiru , kutabare kasu\nkusoga ; normies , youre fucking disgusting as well , and have std , kek , you fucking dumbcunt shabbo$ goyim shiksaz
日本語字幕も出してもらえたら嬉しかったです。
black people I want to go to Japan please don't ruin this for me...
Leave Japan for the Japanese\nbad reputation for accepting foreigners doesn't have the best reputation for diversity\nHow are those bad things? Diversity is cancer. Japan is better without africans and arabs
I could imagine the emotions <3 They've been together for so long <3
For a second there I thought you guys were wearing Male Rompers lmfao

조쉬님이랑 올리님형제에요?\n대부면 큰아빠인가요?
I am so ready for this.
Yorgos Lanthimos is a fucking genius filmmaker
A24, you had my curiosity. Now you have my attention.
God damn if it's anything like The Lobster count me in
Oh my God Nicole is just EVERYWHERE! So proud of this woman. Congratulations on your recent strings of success!
Aint that the dude in Dunkirk ..?
I think I always say this after every trailer but I love A24!
Colin Farrells beard godamn.
Jesus im so excited for this one!!!
I seriously want to watch this movie, but I'm afraid it's not going to be shown in mainstream cinemas in Germany :(
Hank Hill voice: 'something's not right with that boy, tell you what
YO EVERYBODY\nIf you liked The Lobster, \nWATCH DOGTOOTH
So when do we see some deer action in this film?
In a world of relying on loud noises (IT) and unneeded gore (Mother!), A24 is back again to save the day. This is gonna be B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T
I love almost movie you guys have made so far! All original, well done, and entertaining! I'm definitely going to see this one in theaters as well! The only complaint I would have is to not do what you guys did with It Comes At Night for any of your movies ever again. The trailer was misleading and because of that it got trashed on by the casual audience who went to go see it, which is a shame, since it was a really good movie.
I love Yorgos Lanthimos.
Dunkirk 2: George in Heaven is looking really interesting
Wow this looks good, and it's coming out on my birthday
And people say there are no more original films
lol everyone thinking they're cinephiles because they support A24
just a early guess about what happens, the kids father was a patient of colin since hes a surgeon and he let the father die or something so now the kid is coming back for revenge
Excellent
Γιώργο you are a genius !
❤
I agree
This looks awesome.
Fucked up.
The guy from Dunkirk❕❗️❕❗️
Absolutely fucking brilliant - that's my kinda review
Έχουμε καβλώσει!
Young Barry Keoghan is a superb actor.  Loved him in Irish gangland series LOVE/HATE. He has also been in Dunkirk, Trespass Against Us (with Michael Fassbender and Brendan Gleeson) and 71, with Jack O'Connell
A24 is best girl
I have no idea what is going on but I'm all in.
not as good as the lobster, but still pretty interesting and creepy at some points. never really scary, but the acting is great and it looks good.
So fucking haunting. Chills.
One of the best directors right now.
I still don't know anything about the films plot and I can't wait for it. It looks brilliant
I am waitingggggggggggggggggg
This looks fucking amazing
Can't wait!
Bless
This looks great
I don't get it.
Nicole Kidman is literally everywhere now
Love more with hot couple on screen * Nicolin * after watched THE BEGUILED movie
Dad your son is fucking dying...I think he needs some help...He is bleeding from the eyes!!!. Shit
This is the most sinister trailer I have ever seen.
Yes, this one. I wanna see this.
*WE ARE GOING TO WAR GEORGE*
This is going to be so awesome
saw this at TIFF and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
The sequel to The Lobster?
I loved that as fucked up as it's looking it's still trying to make you laugh
Oh, look! It's the stairs kid from Dunkirk!
THE SINGING GETS MORE AND MORE CREEPER
can't do less Kubrick-esque
Duuuuuuudee this movies gonna kill it!!!! Love A24
And way to spoil the twist, A24. Good job.
I can’t wait for seeing this’ll movie
Thought he was blind and dead.
GOOSEBUMPS!
How could Barry's name not be mentioned in the end with the rest wtf
Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman were recently in another film together, The Beguiled. It's fantastic, must watch.
That's the little girl from Tomorrowland!
DAAAAD, Bob's dying !
please release it in india
So God Damn tense I love it
Holy shit the cinematography is so good
Yorgos Lanthimos is already a legend to me
yall dick riding A24 like they're the ones making these movies.  Give Yorgos Lanthimos some credit here, A24 is just the distributor
So here we r bcoz its from A24 nd we r loving it..hit like if u agree
Such a weird looking movie but definitely gonna check it out out of curiosity
This does look interesting, but the acting seems a little off for how talented the actors are so I assume it was intentional. It just seems like one of those movies where all your questions and the mystery is revealed in a single scene and you could get most of the story in just a few minutes. Its just about the tension and not knowing.
After that movie it comes at night and a ghost story I'll never watch another movie by this shitty ass production company. Worst movies I've seen in a long time and the acting is laughable
why does a24 only make massive piles of shit?
The Riker Maneuver caught me by surprise and I now have tears running down my face from laughing so hard. That is one of your finest moments Honest Trailers!
Awesome job Dan! Loved this show and your work putting this together for the 30th anniversary is so appreciated.
you know, if you had inserted Palpatine during that lightning effect, you would have likely gotten away with it.
3:09 I god damn peed on myself laughing while listening to Picard say words that clearly were written by writers that fell asleep on their keyboards.
2:50 So basically he's the Sheldon Cooper of Star Trek...
do the new IT pls!
The Future is woke 😂😂😂
Frakes is super tall. So makes sense he did that.
DO the MEN IN BLACK movies!!!!!!
The most British Frenchman on the show ... ROFL!!
3:06 I'm not gonna lie...I'd hit it.
Do an honest Trailer to Childs play
Okay so how in the hell do you not get copyright infringement problems with using Star Trek content ?
Yo Do IT The movie
Please say time to go lick a frozen pole
why did you just do this?
Now you have to do Deep Space 9
Stop insulting the original series! It wasn't campy and the acting wasn't resi! Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it was bad or campy over the top!
Picard, and it's not even close.
This is one of the best Honest Trailers ever.
Please say:  The thing goes skrrrrra pam pam ka ka ka!
Deep space nine is way better.
star trek deep space nine and voyager!!!
Still waiting on a Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct honest trailer.
Do an honest trailer for arrow
If you do TNG, then you have to also do Voyager.
Please do “the crow” for Halloween!!!!
Dr Crusher. Oh, she certainly brings back some memories...
Ok now we need next generation
To be fair, in two of the three examples you used, people were asking him questions directly related to him being an android.\nAlso, please do Supernatural!
Into the Woods please please please!
Plz do an honest trailer for blade runner
Sub Rosa really was a horrid episode. I swear Beverly got no respect on this show. Two of the biggest episodes that surrounded her, The Host and Sub Rosa, or awful! She definitely didn't have the sort of inclusion in the ship like Bones and The Doctor from Voyager did. Of all series, she was probably the least used physician! It's too bad too because when they did give her good writing she was fantastic
Say: Green is not a creative color
Lol this made me laugh out loud... But TNG is still the greatest show ever
I like how none of the bad episodes were from season one. You all obviously love this show.
Please have trailer guy say why yes, we ARE bringing back Honest Action. I'm not just saying this. Honest.
Do pirates of the carribean 5 please. Also can you say  antidisestablishmentarianism  in your epic voice
I know that this is an unpopular opinion, but seeing a teenage kid on this show made it more relatable to me as a kid. Now that I'm older and a parent, I can see how annoying Wesley was, but he also was a pretty smart kid that saved the day several times.
You did not mention the death trap of a ship they are in. Get a small bump on the shield, one of the control consoles blows up in some body's face. I would love to see the medical log of the ship for that. had to pick shards of control console glass out of an crew members face.
i predict this 8 and half minute video will still have more insight and philosophy than STD will as a whole
Picard the most British Frenchman ever -lol
If you are going to do TV series then do the greatest of them all - Farscape.
Wow... Who produced this and from what country? Morocco? Come
say say say say say say say say say
Do Starship Troopers
Voyager next DO IT
Anyone agree?
Do Spider-Man Homecoming!!
Do Cast Away
Fantastic
Kirk or Picard?! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJaneway and Sisko
Do small soldiers.
Do Gotham
Wheaton !!!
Neither- Janeway FTW!
Do The Wraith (circa 1986)
Klingon fun facts
Shut up Wesley 😂
do it \nplease
Corporate sponsorship = NO MORE BEWBS.
Netflix is...just awful.  What a shitty marketing campaign.
iv wanted this asincre honest trailers came out
Season 7\nEpisode 14
PICARD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Palm punches are pretty effective.
Please do Spider-man: Homecoming!
Say Bronies before Hoe-nies
Why no Baby driver honest trailer??
Do Brother Bear.
I miss TNG. They could have continued the show after Nemesis and I would have watched it .
Say with great power comes great responsibility
Say: You're in a desert and you see a tortoise
please say back in my day, we had a little thing called loyalty. nowadays people only care about bubblegum that tastes like fruit salad, and sticking their peckers in warm mac-n-cheese.
You should totally do an honest trailer for treasure planet! It's a Disney movie back in 2002, GREAT animation for the time, and one of my favorite movies :) not sure if many people know about it but it's awesome! :3\n\nhttp://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Treasure_Planet
Do the Filoni Clone Wars, I want to see what flaws and gems they can find.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I want to join the many other viewers in reminiscing about it.
He missed discribed the Ferengi he should have said Space Jews
what about the poker games? how could you forget the poker games?
To screen junkies the cast of star trek just saw your honest trailer and thought it was funny just to let you know. They took noticed of your video.
Please say Girl, if you were a fruit, you'd be a fine-apple!
Can 8,5 minutes be called a trailer? :-D
This is why they didn't give Picard a French accent...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV10in63_Ok
I'm still on the floor laughing about that Cardassian/Kardashian joke.
Can you pls do IT... pls
Woke? You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it means.
This show reminds me of The Orville. I wonder if it's as good.
Say: Hello, my name is NINO!
do Netflix death note!!! pls
Amazing
You should do Firefly/Serenity.
DS9 next? Puh-leeeeeeeeze?
Spider-Man homecoming
Do a Bladerunner Honest trailer
Keep these trailers at 8 minutes...
Can you guys please make an Honest Trailer for the Netflix movie What Happened to Monday?
Do Disney's Gargoyles next.
PLEASE DO SPIDER MAN: HOMECOMING!!
The Riker Maneuver™
say Presented by T-Moblie
Please do John Wick Chapter 2
I'm Lilith and I bring peace.

I love you poppy ❤
Why am i watching this video and why is anyone else
For some reason I love poppy oml help me
How strange are you, you're really stupid, you can not make normal videos?
Please tell are you illuminati
what TF
Poppy, I am sorry to report that I believe you are incorrect on one point in this engaging treatise on microphones. Dynamic microphones probably were the most common in the 60’s or 70’s, but these days Electret Condenser microphones in use in portable and consumer electronics such as telephones make them by far the most common. Perhaps the confusing wording in the Wikipedia article tripped you up?
Poppy wai you do dis
Poppy is becoming just like Charlotte
Hello why isn't this microphone plugged in? You don't believe me do you? This microphones not plugged in.\nFrom her video:This microphone\nDoritos\nMcdonald's \nMonster Energy Drink\nThe devil\nFrom her video:A microphone
Poppy can be a teacher..
How many subs does she have?
ya know, I think poppy is Google but a woman. :/
Sometimes. I'm actually creeped out by this
poppy plz if illuminati donate to who is join its orgnazation i wanna join then
i want to fuck you
she's on crack.poppy u phsyco ass bitch
Can someone please direct me to the poppy video with the kittens (poppy and kittens)? Are we in a cult?
WHY YOU DOING THIS?
Hi
*Microphone*
Poor little Megyn. She can't hold a conversation. Why in the world does anyone think she can handle this sort of interview? So embarrassing.
It's inevitable, she's going to be kicked off. NBC, just save the time & money and do it now. She's nothing special and was only popular because Trump talked about her vaginal blood.
megyn is just so awkward.
Megyn Kelly sucks on morning tv.  Who asks about plastic surgery during an interview about a movie.  Her “gotcha” style interviews sucks and hurts the TODAY show brand. Stars are going to start boycotting appearances because of her
Really!??? That's what you're asking? Such a waste of time... can i ask you something Megan? Can you leave!? right now!
Megyn Kelly is horrible! I would never watch her show after seeing this!
Kelly is not a people person and has zero charisma. This interview is so awkward.
So ageist, so sexist. this was criiiiiiiiiiinge lol
cringe interview
Omg that question to Jane Fonda was so inappropriate and ill timed! Horrible horrible horrible! Megan is so bad at this job it's startling.
Megyn should quit this job....its just not for her....shes off topic
I can't believe MK had two of the greatest actors sitting right in front of her and decides to discuss plastic surgery! REALLY??? She's blowing her chances, you can't teach humility. Crash and burn...........
The interviewer couldn't make it more awkward for these legends with her imbecilic questions
Is MK interested in anything  besides appearances and age????? How shallow! (and that's a kindness!)\nwhatever made someone hire her in this capacity ??? nearly brainless. And the audience as well, WHY would they populate the seats for a program like this?
Megan: Lose the f**king pen! IT's stupid
Megyn Kelly is the worst. How is it possible to be so thoughtless? Jane Fonda and Robert Redford are amazing and I wish she could have asked relevant questions. #losthope
Megyn says it's a beautiful, beautiful film @ 5:00 and it sounds so disingenuous, she probably didn't even see it!!
Did anyone else feel like the question was really inappropriate? About plastic surgery? I mean really?
Queen Jane shoots down the vile Megyn Kelly. Take this witch back to the slime bucket that is Fox News.
LOL.. the fail is strong with this narcissistic blonde twit.
I thought she said Arseholes at Night ! ( it's the American accent, I'm a Brit)  Terrible interviewer and possibly the most insulting dumbest cringeworthy ageist questions she could ask ... these two legends. And yet they were still gracious . Wish someone would give them the time they deserve and a respectful interviewer
Jane Fonda got more class, brains and beauty today and always, than that intervier Megyn Kelly has.\nThe way Jane Fonda handled that interview was amazing considering it was a full on nasty cut-throat remark by Megyn Kelly.\nI'm with Jane Fonda all the way, and Robert Redford. Just amazing talented people.
Megyn Kelly screwed up here.  But sometimes I get the feeling these liberal celebrities try to throw her off balance on purpose because of the fact that she came from Fox News (which they absolutely hate).
I respect MK... but Barbra Walters she is not.
You know that something is seriously wrong with today's society when someone like Megyn Kelly is a somebody.
What a hack job Kelly did on both of them ... yuck!  no more Meghan Kelly
megyn kelly really sucks...more and more...pretty amazing redford's gone from media recluse to showing up on day time chat shows...getting older made even the sundance kid come in from the cold...
MEGAN KELLY TONIGHT!\nLAST SHOW\nCANCELLED AFTER 1 WEEK\nDUE TO VERY LOW REVIEWS
Jane Fonda did a wonderful job after that terrible question
I think Jane looks great, nothing to be ashamed of. What's her surgeons name, lots of woman have had surgery and look it, jane looks pretty natural.
It’s over Johnny
Megyn Kelly is AWEFUL.
Horrible interview.
Wow, they are still alive.
WORLDAASS NEWS.HAIL THE TODAY SHOW.HEALTHCAREAMERICA.COM ASK TRUMP IF.CLARENCE A WHITE.TODAY SHOW
The only way a Megyn Kelly talk show could be anywhere near remotely entertaining  is if it involved her stripping down and showing off those floppy, whithered, 46 year old fun bags.\nREPLY
hahHHA I AGED NORMALLY BUT ALSO HIT THEM INJECTIONS HAHA XD IM GOOD ACTOR
Megyn Kelley like most conservatives and Fox News anchors are tone deaf and just completely ignorant.
MK is not for daytime TV - she does not relate - she is a hard news person
I  would spit on Hanoi Jane heifer dog
Her show appeals to idiots. That's all
I just heard the next episode is going to be completely devoted to DIY tips to protect your family from the New Black Panther Party. You're doing gods' work Megyn!
She destroyed her career when she left fox...today show screwed themselves after paying millions for her😂😂 instant buyers remorse
women have nothing to offer other than their looks. they are all terrified of aging, its sweet justice for us men who have to watch them entitled and evil all their life
Please come back to Houston
MK sorry, but can you drool over Redford even more?
Totally shocked by Megyn Kelly's announcement at 4.57.  It sounds like she is saying 'Arseholes at night'! Better to emphasise the second word ( 'Souls' ) instead of the first ('Our').
Age!!Age!!!looks!! AGE!LOOKS! MK IS OVER
Kelly is great...who doesn't love watching a clown, just waiting for the fool to show up.
The only thing Megyn has going for her is her looks. She is terrible at interviewing. That is why her show is tanking.
it's amazing how when you only see a short clip about the plastic surgeon question, an impression is left with the viewer how inappropriate the situation was and how angry Jane Fonda was. However, when you watch the entire interview, it was really only a blink in the context of it all.
Miss Kelly should just get off TV!!!!!
Megyn Kelly is no OPRAH. WHY is she so obsessed with Jane’s looks and body -_- she’s so fake. Trying to force feed us superficiality. She is spearheading ageism by constantly talking about Jane’s looks.
Megyn is forced and beating to her own drum at the expense of Fonda here. And also, why didn´t you ask Redford about his facelifts? Probably had as many as Jane has. Be a little self-critical about how you reproduce old stereotypes of women by the questions you ask. Not cool, sorry.
man, do they live in the past or what?
First the Will and Grace Snafu. Now this.\nYikes.
Redford has become so effeminate.   He has been a good actor and last saw him in A WALK IN THE WOODS  with Nick Nolte in 2015.
Cringing in embarrassment for Megyn. Why not askJane who she's looking forward to working with on the next project? Jane has class for miles!
MK just can't stay in the moments.... interrogate off topic vs. appreciate now
Jane and Robert came to promote their new movie and Megyn consistently tried to take the conversation to any other topic besides the movie.  Strange way to do a movie-promo interview.  I can see why Jane was annoyed.  And Megyn still didn't take a hint.  She's got a big learning curve on how to do this kind of show.
Can't stand Megan Kelly, what a horrible interview
Awful host! She don't know how to listen to her guests...
Isn't this Megyn Kelly that person who claim that Jesus Christ was white and should only be showed as white? Isn't she the one who makes all types of excuses for police shooting of unharmed black people and claims that it has nothing to do with race.
Show's not going to last !!!
This isn’t about you Megan!! Please ...
why is the camera CONSTANTLY MOVING? distract from what's actually happening on screen maybe? BECAUSE IT SUCKS (the camera and the content). thanks
I just don't like Megyn.
She is trying its hard to overcome old habits fox news was and is the worst
Jane was looking daggers at Megyn and rightly so.  Megyn was extremely rude, would she want to be asked about her hair extensions?   I've always liked Jane Fonda and am glad to see her and Redford together again in a sequel of sorts to Barefoot in the Park.  I don't recognize that electric horseman movie because it was so awful.
Almost every question had to do with age.  WTF!?  When the interviewees keep having to save the interview, you know that something's JUST NOT RIGHT.   Redford's right about Jane, she's amazing.
never has there been two ego maniacs like Megyn Kelly and Jane Hanoi Jane Fonda pompous arrogant complete drones .  Redford that ship has come and sailed but still hanging on for some publicity and to be adored by the public.  PATHETIC !!!!!
Megyn Kelly already reached her peak of fame. It's all downhill from here.
i came here for Robert & Jane\n& then i saw  the cow\non the presidential debate \nit is her ?
I feel bad for Fonda. She had to sit through an interview with this ignorant woman.
1:51 Really Megan Kelly That like Bryanstars level of Stupid questions i mean come on.
Hanoi Jane looks amazing...
in before canceled
A communist and a hateful feminist walked onto a stage........and then I turned the t.v. off.
shadow gov. fake tv..
NBC's LATEST DISASTER: MEGYN KELLY 👎.
they look like mummies
Megyn sux! Poor thing
Bye Megyn.
MEGYN KELLY IS TERRIBLE. Awful. Awfully terrible!! Terribly awful. \nGo back to Fox News.
r/cringe
Megan Kelly malicious
Omg that was upsetting to watch
Megyn Kelly is trash lol
It seems like when you're older your age will be rubbed in your face whether it's in a form of compliments or not...Honestly it doesn't need to be constantly pointed out 🙄
jane fonda has everything it takes to become a major political player.\nevery conservative fears jane fonda entering politics.\npelosi / fonda 2020!
JANE IS 😍😍
She is a racist and a liar. I will never forget how you purposely inspired racist attacks with race baiting, calling black protesters thugs, saying that all Muslims are terrorists and  inciting people to commit hate crimes all over this nation. You and the rest of the propagandist at fox, both past and present, are covered in blood from all of the attacks and murders caused by your words. You cant hide from your past and who you really are. NBC are trying to normalize these people but DON'T LET THEM. DON'T WATCH ANY SHOW KELLY OR ANYONE WHO THINKS LIKE HER IS ON. SHAME!!!!!!
I personally think MK did a great job, and I’m not even a fan.
Megyn Kelly will never be half the woman Jane Fonda is.  Not to mention the Integrity.
Jane Fonda just through complete shade...NAHH ..., she threw ABSOLUTE DARKNESS on this ignorant, moron, lawyer turned news anchor, turned entertainment host. Meghan,,dear,,,, CATS are the only creatures to boast about 9 lives, your DONE.
This dyed-blonde skank must be deported to Saudi Arabia ASAP.
I think people or the media are making too big of a deal out of this part of the interview. Now that Ive seen it it just wasn't that bad.
If they want viewers they need edge, this is not edge, there is no edge on tv anymore!
Jane is funny.  She definitely likes to be the centre of attention with discussion pertaining to her or her co-star referencing her or them, even at her age.   Robert Redford has a good sense of humour.
i thought Jane Fonda died
Yeeeaaahhh.... I don’t want a clock right next to my bed with a camera on it. Don’t need to explain why
This will make turning off the alarm too easy.\n Alexa, SHUTUP
So, pay Amazon to watch you have sex?
Big brother is watching.
Big brother will be watching
Nobody reading this has finished the video
fresh whose release another clean suspect living AM.
Great. So now amazon can listen to whatever happens in your bedroom and recommend sextoys to you if there is not so much going on under the sheets anymore. Who could wish for more?
Amazon wants camera and mic in every room of the house
Great job CIA 😀👌🙌🎆🎉🔥
hi i'm Casey, and this is 90 seconds on the verge
$150?  I'll pass .
Sorry but I'll just never be comfortable inviting sensor packed data harvesting AI training devices into my home unless they're open source
Typo at 0:48
Next comes Echo G-Spot.
I want this as a center console in a Mini Cooper
Great now the NSA can see me sleeping !!
Amazon is so clever with their promoting. It's about time someone updated the alarm clock. A 'smart clock' is a far easier sell than a talking speaker that stalks you
You all are a bit paranoid about big brother. I'll be getting one. I like the idea of having a interactive and smart alarm clock and this one looks aesthetically beautiful
Now they can see me while having sex
The Amazon Echo looks like a rip-off of the Bonjour Alarm Clock...\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1450781303/bonjour-smart-alarm-clock-with-artificial-intellig
free video calls to amazon corporate headquarters and the NSA.  just press nothing.
I wont buy this at all - 1) too creepy 2) wont need it I have a phone to make video calls 3) why on earth I want a video cam in my bedroom !  spy cam? unless it comes with $2m liability -where is my settlement money from Equifax  ?  sorry was distracted
they should kill the bezels
Just as a word of advice to some of the people commenting, here's a hint: ANYTHING with a camera or a microphone connected to the internet can be used by the government to watch you. Your phone, any microphones you have connected to your computer, webcams, all of that can be used to watch you. So, can the government watch you through this? Yes. Of course they can, and I'm sure they probably will. But they can also watch you at all times when you're on your phone or your laptop watching this video. It isn't new information, people. Yes, these devices can be used to watch you, but anything connected to the internet with some kind of recording device can be used to do that. The only difference is that this is a smart alarm clock. Doesn't matter.
the goal of modern living is simplicity, not more gadgets
Its going to look so hot with s big piece of black tape on the camera. I'll sit it right next to the fan I have with matching black tape on the blue light that shoots out of it.
first \n\n\n\n\nperson shooters are cool

Yea if i buy one, the first thing i will do is put a tape on the front facing cam. \n\nIt would be nice if companies would think about actually making some kinda lid on the camps their integrate into their products, \nso people would have a choice, so people dont have to destroy the design of the thing with a ugly table. \n\nBuy hey, first world problems..
Amazon need to stop stealing others ideas, like this one:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pufR8uJAAw0&t=
Yay an alarm clock that uses electricity!! That's a game changer!
what a load of rubbish
I will not put that magic 8 ball w/ a camera in my bedroom. \n\nAlso I wonder how many ppl do video calls. Anecdotally idk anyone. Curious if the rest of population does regularly enough to buy this. They must if Amazon if Amazon is betting on it
0:48 indeed, a good clcol amazon echo spot is
The dot next to my computer keeps waking up to this
So pretty much a device that does everything my smartphone already does.  I think I'll pass.
Probably most appealing thing in the line-up more affordable price, small modern form-factor, and it has the luxury of a screen + all the features of a regular echo.
FREE video calls?!? No freaking way!
don't put that in bedroom
Imagine Alexa in your bedroom listening to you sleep...
This is my favorite eco but I’m not buying it since amazon have information to the government about people talking to the eco
I still don't understand the need for these things. I guess if you have some smart stuff in their house or if you really need to video call someone but for me already have an alarm clock. Already have a weather forecaster. Its called the phone or TV.
Not sure about having a camera next to my head while I'm sleeping.  Believe it or not, I obviously LOVE tech....emmm emm my tech review channel :).  However, when it's time to sleep I want absolutely NO TECH in my bedroom, including my phone.
Does youtube work on it?
WALLS HAVE EARS! AND YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!
I wonder why they didn't make the screen bigger. Should have went with a 3 screen
Wow now that's cool
new product from CI... i mean amazon 😊
I think this is the most interesting of the new devices but it's real potential is lost to me when it doesn't keep a charge for like lets say the power goes out...    Then it's not a dependable alarm clock.
Who wonna trade vid clips on this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Any idea if the display can turn off?  Asking for the clock in a bedroom use case.
Has anyone ever told Alexa to shut up
Coming Soon: Amazon Cool Beans- an alexa enabled refrigerator, specifically designed for beans. starts at 1299
Why would you want a camera on it?
My Echo kept going off during this video lmao
Doesn't this one look too similar with the upcoming smart speaker by the essential?
too pricey, $75 per an we got a deal
It's a buy and a great deal.. can't wait for the knock off version
This looks cool but has personal data breach written all over it. -no thanks.
So it does nothing my phone can't do.
Put one in your bedroom huh? then don't forget to cover the camera or turn it around whenever you're pleasuring yourself, cause you just never know who's watching.........
South Park should had waited to make that Alexa episode how funny whould this be if they mocked the fact that this thing has a camera on it
Ah, great...  A camera next to my bed
When I first saw it in the thumbnail I thought, dang nest made a virtual assistant... NICE... oh dang it’s amazon.
The amount of times this video triggered Alexa...
Great, they can now watch me sleep...
i always hate how whenever i watch a video about alexa it keeps triggering my echo dot
We are in future OMG
Looks really nice! Looks like Amazon is doing well with their tech
150$ ??!! No thanks
How come Amazon sucks at making products.
A smart alarm clock? Nice.
Make Alexa Great Again #MAGA
STOP saying ALEXA! lol

Jeof Bezzoz is lost
To all who are commenting that this echo spot will now be able to hear you and see you in your bedroom. Hope you morons realize you carry your phones everywhere.
putting an internet connected smart device with a good front facing camera in your bedroom? Grrreeaat idea!
I want one
Echo dot\nEcho show\nNow echo spot? \nWow
Got Siri, I don’t need this weird spyware thing too.
I'd pay $20 for this glorified photoframe.
this is pretty cheap so idk why people are complaining
I'm with Google..
What usefully those devices do? Other than stealing your data.
130 is way too expensive
The issue with this is that an alarm clock needs 100% reliability. What if there is no power or WiFi. Does it have back up power and does the clock work fully with no internet. Does it go down sometimes.  On a regular Echo none of this matters, but it does on an alarm clock. That has to work every single time, with no exceptions ever.
Forth
Need more hot girls\nlmao
this is great, because before taking or making calls i always run to the bedroom and lie down first.
No Ethernet, who wants to sleep with WiFi next to their head, that's dangerous.
Nothing beats days like this :) Thanks for being a huge part of everything we do. Smile More :)

I have a dAde sistr name cru
Yes, I was trolling British cider lovers. Sorry.
Freakishly small ladle
From a butcher; that is a pork butt. The shoulder is the next section down. Yes, they are virtually interchangeable. However, they are in fact two different sub-primals, and if you're going to the length of getting friendly with a local butcher, it's worth note.
This was so good.   What a perfect dinner for October 1st.  I did it over the spaetzle instead though.   Cooking time was about 2.5 hours.
My first try at this is in the first hour simmer and you never said how the whole house is filled with such a wonderful the aroma.
Could I substitute beef with this easily? Where's the fat content on the shoulder highly important
Looks ultra-yum! I also admire that freakishly small ladle.
Can you make Belgian carbonade ?
nope... sorry... cant watch this right now. im not ready to be hungry yet... im saving this for breakfast lol
Give it the oooolllldd poka poka lol
Just finished cooking this and it's a really great recipe. I reduced my sauce down a lot, to the point where it was basically a gravy. You get a great balance of sweetness from the cider and earthy savoriness from all the sage. And that little bit of vinegar not only reigns in the sweet cider but the acidity helps marinate the pork. I paired it with some butternut squash I roasted in dill and pepper. Thanks Chef John!
I made this yesterday, turned out so delicious. Did have to go for standard apple cider, didnt find sage leaves in 3 supermarkets (not even dried) So I went for a bit of a mix of thyme and rosemary. Which didn't give the same flavour but they sure did the trick for making it just as delicious. Have to keep my eye out for some fresh sage so I can make this properly, might even have to grow my own sage for the sake of trying it!
Made this tonight. Wonderful and so so easy to make
I tried this. It was delicious. I added pig trotters to it so it was rich and so good.
I make pork in cider with apples every fall. The gravy is brown, savory and spicy. Cider goes into my squash soup too. Cider is under utilized in cooking,
a la pork latte with a vinegar kicker....  \nThis was DELISH! The smell reminded me if my Grandmother's chitterlings but taste better.
my food wish is a savoury puff pastry appetizer. I keep making your sausage rolls for my guy, as he LOVES them. Unfortunately I have never been a huge fan of sausage rolls,  so I would love a little puff pastry appetizer I could make at the same time for myself!
I'm onto you chef John. I saw that America's test kitchen episode a few days ago.
Chef John: What brand of French hard cider do you use. Is Calvados appropriate? I intend to make this recipe soon.
The old poke-a poke-a
Can one use some of the amazing stock of the pork and cider as a stock for risotto?
I'm sick to death of these dammed 'Prescription Drug Commercials! I thought there was a law against advertising Prescription Drugs drugs online! All I want to do is watch these videos without all the BS!
Wow.
My mouth watered ugh 😑 I want some !
Hi ☺️, could you do a video making mulligatawny soup sometime? Thanks!
SPIDERMAN IS HUNGRY ! SPIDER MAN HA HA HA HA HA
Interesting take on Somerset Pork.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yummiest
Looks like you stole this idea from another YouTube Channel
Chef, at about 6:11 you showed a close up of the simmering gravy. The sides of the dutch oven had fond on them. Why didn't you scrape it down and dissolve it into the simmering liquid?
rub rub 💩👅💋🐛
OM NOM NOM NOM NOM
Wow
El chema de nega
Omg, that sounds foodgasmic!
Looks amazing!!!!

Kosher salt on pork...
Buttered rice you say?
That looks soooo good.
YOU ARE TRENDING :)
#25 trending thats what i wanna see
always love ur recipe this 1 looks outrageously YUM! Thank chef John.
Yoooo, Chef John is trending
Making this!! 😋😋
omg
First time the cayenne came in so late
Lol give it the old poke-a-poke-a I love Chef John!!! ^.^ Hope everyone is having great day!!
This is my new place to come to when I miss my dad reading me bed time poems.
John,  I shouldn't watch your videos at 1 in the morning.  I'm now gonna go cook.
Would this work with beef for those who can't eat pork?
Stole my recipe except that I always leave it bone on.  You just can't replicate the feel and taste of collagen.  Way better than resorting to flour or corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I also add thick apple slices to the braise so when done you have a more less savory apple sauce
John have you tried traditional English cider? Flat, strong, dry, tasting 100% of apples, tart, etc? I really think youd like it (maybe in recipes like this, or to drink...)
Ok, going on next grocery list.  Can't wait to drink the sauce!\n\nJust had the billionaire frank and beans, never been a fan but Chef John's recipe is simple, quick and absolutely gonna be an added favorite to my house (I cheated in one spot and didn't use water, I used veg broth ; ) watch the vidy and you'll understand.
Omg.....this is a alllllllllll day to cook 🍖 meat. Thanksgiving turkey 🦃 doesn't even take this long.! I'm going to give it a try though.
Takes sooo long to cook. I cooked it in a pressure cooker and took half an hour only.
we're not trying to make pulled pork here\nBut could we make pulled pork with a similar method?\npossibly thickening the sauce so it sticks more to the meat?
My heart never beats like it beats at this
I have that exact same pot but can't brown anything in it! How do you brown meat on ceramic?
The rhythm of how you speak is very entertaining! :)
I would love to see the squash recipe as well.
Wow not hours before I watched this video I bought a delicatta squash! Please show me what to do with it :)
Hi Chef John, is this recipe going up on All Recipes?
Sounds yummy. I’m making it this weekend.  Please do the squash video, too. It is squash season, after all.
You are the boss of your pork shoulder stewed in a creamy apple cider sauce!  Yes!  Want to learn more about Delicata squash for sure.  At first I thought it could have been sautéed apples which, of course, would have paired nicely with the pork shoulder.   Regardless Chef more on Delicata and other winter squash types.  Very underrated vegetable.
This man is bordering on national treasure
I could of used this recipe about 4 days ago when I found a 5LB pork shoulder for $7.00 . The only recipes I could find was bbq pulled pork.
My food wish is a open cheese pie\nhttps://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/d5/ea/55d5eac2d9f69dd00e390535d6958ff5.jpg
Congrats on being #20 on the trending list! Good for you.
the cadence of this dude's voice bothers me
Did recipe with beef shoulder instead...worked great!
Pork shoulder is one of my favorite cuts from pork besides pork ribs and belly. Usually pork loins are too lean to my taste unless I make it sous vide.
Everything is better with a touch of Cayenne.
Cider from France??? Live local,buy local,love local,,,support our own.

what does hard cider mean? how is it different from regular cider? (a non-native english speaker here)
i reduce my sauce/gravy in a vacuum evaporator.. so much better
Wooo 25 on trending!! 😁😁😁
listen to me now and hear me later....lol
Chef John, Amid the chaos, corruption and scandal that peppers the news on a daily basis, your humour and good nature provide the perfect antidote! Please keep up the great work!
Just made it. With a twist I reduced with a bit of the best home made beef stock, no salt added, and put just a few flakes of teragon. Wow amazing.
bouncin on my boy's d to this
All I saw in the title was PORK CREAMY SAUCE
I've been watching Food Wishes for years! Do you know how much I support and love the channel? I don't even skip the ads so you can get that revenue. Stay hustling Johnny boy.
His voice makes me sooooo sleepy \n😴😴\nI'm not complaining or anything
Why does he sound like he is singing?
Hello Chef John. I just made this and the pork was delicious, but the gravy is too tangy/vinger-y. Did I not reduce it enough? I reduced the liquid low and even added about 2 teaspoons of sugar because the sauce was very vinegar-y.
where is the beef, I mean MEAT!!!!!! I'm not much on boiled fat.
chef john - i really must ask you this: do you have some religious objection to pressure cookers??  while this may not be the best example, but there are plenty where you could have used one and (imho) think you could have gotten better results, far faster.  you NEVER use pressure cookers.  what's up with that?\n\nanyone else with me on this?
I am sure others commented on @  4:14  the sauce went from a liquid to a thicker more reduced sauce. Plus pan had more meat in after the edit.  Chef John I am rather disappointed in this presentation.
the brown stuff at the bottom of the pan is actually called the suuc. the fond is when you deglaze it with liquid.
i dont know enough about being jewish, but is there a thing with kosher salt on pork, is that halal or whatever ok forget it.
Good god his tone of voice is so crazy its like hes excited about every single sentence that comes out of his mouth oh my god!
What did you say the glaze at the bottom of the pan is called ?
his voice goes up and down again and again
Now give it the old poka poka  i will forever use this😂😂😂
You should play jerobeam fenderson on it.
I'd love to see these side-by-side with an oscilloscope!
i wonder if the mirror was moving out from under the laser when it had multiple ends and starts?
Great video thanks :)
2:35 this funny pattern here\nIt's a dick.
The reason for the many ends is the rolling shutter
Why the broken lines?  Easy... It's just the laser missing the mirror when it oscillates too far.
4:57 set camera to manual? 5:12 better set camera to manual?
the extra start and end points are likely cause by the rolling shutter effect
would the light just take the frequencies and display the songs notes on the wall and the switching is just the rapid notes being displayed?
After watching this video, I knew I had to try this. The fun lasted all about 5 minutes, when I learned that dollar store laser pointers don’t last particularly long.
That's cool, some of those figures are typical lissajous patterns ... didn't expect them to show up so clearly!
Actually, it is the way our inner ear works. We hear geometric patterns.
The multiple ends are because of the rolling shutter effect
Really nice idea! What would be also very interesting to know, is if you can predict a composite wave form from two separate ones by addtion of the xy traces. Also what would be an effect of an offset related to that.\n\nIn a similar sense ... what would happen if one could take the surface of a disco ball onto a speaker and shine light onto it, or several lasers? What I wonder, would it be possible to see some complete image of the membrane?
You mean auto not manual lol
OMG MY FRIEND AND I JUST TRIED IT AND IT'S AMAZING WTH WHO THOUGHT OF THIS I JUST WANT TO HUG THAT PERSON
This is called a lissajouls figure
That effect of having multiple lines in a frame could be that your cameras light sensor segments read each pixel in a line by line format. So as the laser was moving around it might if moved in and out of where the line that was being read at the time was. This is why we get the slanting effect when the camera is moving steadily sideways. The lines at the top or bottom are read first and then each successive line of light sensor segments is read slightly after the first
It would be interesting to put two pieces of glass each with their own laser at different locations on the balloon and see how different the projected shapes are simultaneously.
I so have to try this.
Can we get a full video of just the lazer so we can watch all of it?
Nice. Now record that bitch in slowmotion.
Maybe because the laser is not hitting the mirror? I mean, it's too small so the vibrations of the baloon membrane could be extreme enough that the laser misses the mirror's aperture
I wonder if using a square container would change the shape since the balloon would be stretched differently.
Did you use Spaces or Tabs in your code?
I feel like in staring into the 4th dimension
This needs some square waves.
Used to make these for parties in the 90's. 1st surface mirror glued to a speaker and then shot through a spinning quartz crystal.
If you hook up the left and right channels of a stereo output to an oscilliscope and, holding one note steady, scan the other note through an octave, say, the harmonics visualization is great. Use the lissajous mode on the oscilliscope which centers each input on 0,0 of an x/y axis. The headphone output of a cheap keyboard is a common available source. The flute or ?French horn might give the best sine wave for the cleanest visualization.
Vectorscope, it looks just like it, search up oscilloscope music it looks cool
To understand where there is more than one starting point you should watch you this excellent video explaining and showing in detail why this happens... https://youtu.be/CmjeCchGRQo
That's a great low tech solution to visualising sound.
I'm so intrigued by how many of them look like they could be a 3D shape rotating in space...
it's like a 3d render with laser
I wonder what this would look like if you used a piece of a DVD instead of the mirror. I guess it would be interesting to combine it with the interference pattern produced by the DVD.
I can't help but feel David Gilmour ought to use this. \n(Seeing how he's still all about them lasers ;)
I think is because of the rolling shutter
It would be interesting if the results are better if filmed with 60fps
Could you not have just opened windows media player for the same effect haha
I ran across this video today and it looks very similar to this but is using a completely different method. Its called the shape of music, He has more information on how it works in the description. Are these two methods similar in any way? https://youtu.be/8TxTilR7xu8
6:09 >i don't think it's because the laser pulses, otherwise i would have noticed it watching it live\n\nNo, you really wouldn't have.  \n\nDiodes can be PWM pulsed very quickly, faster than the human eye can hope to see.  LEDs for example are typically pulsed at thousands of pulses per second, the human eye thinks it's just dimming but in reality it's turning full-on & full-off thousands of times per second.
The single frame with many lose ends, could it be because the laser leaves the mirror?
My first thought would be rolling shutter, but it doesn't have the right artifacting. It could be the physical properties of the mirror fragment itself (such as it being too small, the glass taking an internal reflection, etc.). A high speed camera would really be the only thing I could think of to answer that question.
While this a beautiful demo, I can't help but feel that the mirror shard's asymmetry affected the vibrating membrane and gave an unpure reading of the tones you used. Also, why place the mirror somewhere other than the center of the membrane? From the Chladni experiment we know certain sections of the membrane vibrate differently than others for a given time, why not place mirrors at nodes & antinodes and repeat the experiment and compare the laser paths? \n\nSemi-related, I know you're interested in visualizing sound, I think liquid cymatics could be a rad project for you (especially using mercury on a speaker with lasers)
Instead of you talking to the camera do voiceover. We came here for the laser not for you.
What if you put a Shepard tone
It will be awesome if you do the same but with Jerobeam Fenderson’s Oscilloscope Music!\nMaybe the patterns produced with that music can be visible with your laser-mirror system.
I'm pretty sure (correct me if i'm wrong) that the segmentation on the freeze frame is due to the way a laser works. it pulses a light on a tube of some crystal, the electrons absorb the energy then emit it again slowly at all the same frequency and direction. then it pulses again. so maybe there's your answer. I'm not sure though
This was really good. Gj
I made some java-script programs a few years ago to draw Lissajous figures and cycloids which look similar to some of those. Sorry that but you need a khan academy user to view them. https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/mouse-operated-spline-oscilloscope/5921753556320256
This was so cool. Instantly my mind jumped to string theory and what strings of vibrating energy look like.
Discount oscilloscope music?\n\nAlso, does the position of the mirror affect the shape? My hypothesis would say yes, however I don't have the resources to experiment at this moment.
Use oscilloscope music. I want to see if it will still create the same effect.
Those are Lissajous (after the mathematician who first described them)patterns. I thought they were purely theoretical being the quotient of waves. But they do appear in multidimensional membranes as seen here.
Put the laser and speaker in a vacuum and slowly decrease the amount of air and observe how the patterns change
The extra loose ends might just be the laser moving momentarily back up the path it came, but then I guess you would see it in person?
I'd recommend imagining them as 3D shapes, it really changes the experience.
You should glue 2 bits of mirror on and use 2 separate lasers to get 2 different cross sections of the same wavelengths
There's probably a mathematical way to play a certain frequency to make any shape you want
It would be interesting to teach an AI which sounds create which shapes, and then use it to generate a desired shape by calculating what type of waveform needs to be produced.
Try a combination of 741 Hz, 528 Hz, and 432 Hz. I wonder what kind of complex pattern that might make...
I think the reason why you get more than one starting point on the laser path is that the mirror turns away from the laser beam a number of times during the time the shutter is open, since the diaphragm would be vibrating at a higher frequency than the shutter of the camera, right?
Back in the day, a friend of mine took an old black and white tv set and used it as a basic cathode ray tube wiring the left channel of a stereo across the vertical control and the right channel across the horizontal (or something line that).  The effect was very very similar to what you have here.
Water on a speaker would also show you what you are looking for.
You just made the language of the future
I'm a laser geek the reason for this pulse effect is some lasers are either pulsed or continuous pulsed causes it's to flicker
its a analogue laser show.
the speaker used in this video is a UE Roll, from experience i know its a very good portable speaker :)
the multiple breaks is due to rolling shutter\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP1elMR5qjc
This reminds me of Lissajous Patterns. It is cool how you are generating them with a single signal source. Using an oscilloscope, one must use two signals to control the x and y position of the beam. However, in your setup, the x and y position is controlled by the orientation of your mirror! Wonderful video  :3
I want to challenge u to make a video using the speaker and laser
You should use a really strong laser to see what note is played most in music
wow that's beautiful and really interesting
The laser hits the end of the little mirror fragment. It is not the camera. Its the light hiting the ballon.
you said manual instead of automatic
OMG this is so awesome!\nNow we need to hook up a neural network powered AI\nput the goal to: awesome geometrical shapes\nand give the AI the sound controll\nthen see what happens!
Which waveform(s) are being used here? I'm very curious as I'd love to give this a go at home.
Does this work with music too, or just solid frequencies?
shouldn't you have put the mirror in the exact middle of the balloon for most exact results?
At ~ 5:28 when there is a short shutter speed and the contour is broken up, some parts are longer. This suggests that the speed of the laser image is changing along its path, it would be interesting to think of a way of showing this intentionally and looking if there is any further pattern to the behaviour. Perhaps intentionally strobing the laser to produce a finely dotted line to see spacing between them? Any way of changing to colour would be good, the only way I can think of is again strobing the laser but using a 'white' laser with three diodes that fire sequentially.\n\nAlso, I wonder how some of these patterns hold up against solving the displacement of the surface of the balloon using bessel functions etc.\n\nAnyway great video as always
Wonder what this would look like with a smoke screen
This is how aliens communicate
Lisadues loops with the radial and circumferal oscillations? Rather than a ballon , I wonder if two elastic bands at 90' and a stereo setup could give xy control? Add in a mosfet for controlling the laser and that might make a very inefficient display.
For those of us without Perfect Pitch would have been neat if you'd added what frequency was playing to produce each shape.
https://youtu.be/dNVtMmLlnoE   6:15
Resonant constellations are fascinating. Reminds of UFOs.
Two words: Rolling Shutter
Holy shitballs Steve, brilliant upload!
This is cool
Mesmerizing
my brain exploded at exactly 2:52
THIS IS AMAZING
You should do oscilloscope music
cool!!
Try playing jerobeam fenderssons music with this
Looks like an oscilloscope
Reminds me a bit of oscilloscopes.
6:18 Rolling shutter effect maybe?
Now pulse the laser at the same frequency as the input sound and see what happens!
My heart is beating so fast I'm falling so hard for them all over again ❤️
Anyone else besides me wants to see J Hope with some dreads on when he sings this song?
that line how dare you that refers to unlike the videos and haters😱
Hobi...so cool the rest as well ....love BTS

The mic that suga threw at the end is literally me
Did you see my *wig?*
Does anyone know the name of Rapmon's hair style??
OMG... I already freaking love that song but this dance and this performance on top is just too much... I can die in peace now. I just have no words left... It's too good I can't... BTS what u do to meee I'm such a piece of bts trash this is too much I'm dead aahhh\nAnd Jimin stop that I already told you that I'm gay! No matter what you try I won't... I won't...
I keep coming back to watch mic drop performance  😩😩
DID U SEE MY M BIAS LIST ? DID U SEE MY BIAS LIST ? DID U SEE MY BIAS LIST ?
Namjoon’s glow up has me crying

I AM BEING DISRESPECTED IN MY OWN HOME
Its so satsfying to hear the fan chants end as soon as they start singing idk y
THIS SONG IS SO FUCKING LIT
That ain't a mic drop, that's a mic THROW YOONGI DAYUM
ya know, namjoon tries to be all hot and sexy, and it works. but then he moves his mouth a certain way and his dimples show and its just cute mon and i cry
Imagine how proud their parents are😭💖💖
Really power dancer   Bts  😍😍😎☝💟

I love you bts
TAEHYUNNNNNNNNNNN AAAAAAAAAA
KINGS
Look at rapmon and Jin dancing like pros man😍😍
jimin is sexy with that hair style .. like he had just showered
Someone knows the order of the names at the start of the fanchant? From the oldest to the younger?
Yoongi dropping dat mike is a satisfaction for me
Tae,  we dont see your *GUCCI* Bag😂  But maybe your bag was stolen by Jimin, To have his jams back cuz you guys stole it😂
Jin: HOW YOU DARE? HOW YOU DARE?\nMe: No, How *YOU* Dare boy😏🔥
Suga and rm are the only one that fits this song!
namjOON YOUR HAIR HOLY-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone please collect this man before I am slayed.\n\nOh wait I already am.
all the mic drop stage perf so far i would say taehyungie's outfit here is dope especially with the bandana
why so hot baby😍\nthis is the best mic drop dance video!!!!\nwahhh..super love the concept
Who else thinks it's the best song on the album?
tbh whenever i sing the partdid you see my bag in school or in public my friends always say your bag is in your back why do you keep on searching for it HAHAHA
taehyung in bandana will always be my death
mic drop will be the death of me
WHY IS IT THAT WHENEVER MIC DROP STARTS IM ALREADY PREGNANT?!! HOSEOK CAN YOU STOP? WHY ARE YOU SO RUDE?!
TO: the one who took their bags, RETURN IT FFS.\n\n\n\nLMAO JK.
i don't know what breathing is anymore

Haters gonna hate\nPlayers gonna play\nAlligators gonna alligate?\nPotatoes gonna potate?
Jin and V 😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG 2:53 to 2:59 Jungkook
This was great, but the shay carl one was kind of a low blow...
The shay joke had a bitch QUAKING
Superwoman stood up at the end cus she knew how good he was ❤️❤️
He's gonna go far, not afraid to be non PC in a time where doing so can get you in a whole lot of trouble. This is what comedy needs.
OMG ITS A ROAST PLS GET OVER IT AND JUST LAUGH. Holy shit
Holy crap he threw more than shade he threw the whole damn tree
........I don’t think he’ll be asked to host again
Why didn't he say Koshi? It would have rhymed.
ned from try guys is on 1:40 into the right
Lmao I love the part where they think it's a compliment and he goes YEAH DON'T CHEER FOR YOURSELVES HAHAHA OMFG
Fuck, I love this. Jon has always been a creator aware of how fucking dumb the concept of online fame is, and the fact that this video proves most of his points about youtubers legitimately feeling like they're hot shit, damn, the Shane Dawson part? Man, I fuckin love this man. also, the A list of the D list was perfect. The streamys is a hey look at all my subscribers convention  and they way everyone is dressed and acts really slams the nail in the coffin, people use YouTube claiming that it's casual and less corporate that mainstream media, fuck I love it
That song was perfect. But wow, that audience... YouTubers are some of the most pretentious people in the world.
hey look paint finally came out with a new song
Jon fucking killed it I love him so much\n\nOkay but I saw Jenna marbles next to Ned from the try guys and oh my god my life is complete
OH MY GOD THE LIZA AMD LILY ROAST
I wish we could have seen Jenna's face when he said 100 layers of daddy issues. I wonder if she laughed.
The audience is dry af. Like damn.
I died when he mentioned Dodie and then it cut to her and Stevie holding hands
Was I watching a different video or something? Everyone is saying the audience wasn't laughing at the jokes but I saw and heard the complete opposite... great job Jon!
hmm the shane roast was too far i think
I love him and everything he said is true tbh
he was so good. big mood
okay the roast on shay carl I HAVE NO WORDS
THE DISS TRACK OF THE YEAR\nCozart you killed it!
Two things: 1) It's like regular awards without the reason to exist. A truer statement has never been said. 2) Are there For Your Consideration campaigns for these as well?
LOL WHEN YOU PUT SUB TITLES IT SAYS JAY CARL INSTEAD OF SHAY CARL
I love *MOST* of you guys damn savage
An awards show for internet creators is the dumbest thing I've ever heard of but Jon Cozart is brilliant.
Jake paul who? Longan who??? Jon didn't roast them he burn them
I love *most* of you
The shane part was SOOOOO EMBARRASINGGG  everyone was just quiet
I really loved this, but the one about dodie stung! I feel like that one was meant to be hurtful..
The Phantom Menace of award shows THAT IS ONE BIG FAT INSULT
I feel bad for Shane it's just stupid when you realize you did something wrong and you apologized for it and still no one want to forget or forgive
Liza : It's true...true \n\nI love her 😂😂
THE ROAST ABOUT HANNAH HART AND TYLER OAKLEY IM SO SHOOK OH MY GOD
Pretty good. But it sad his youtube-channel is dead... :/
i missed paint as hell.
Wonder if mr wells is watching this😂 true fans will know who that is.
I know what I'm learning on my ukulele now!! I have to exchange the names tho
Why did he downplay this?? He's talented but so negative this isn't what being at the streamys is about!
THERE WAS NO CHILL
I fell like he copied a guy from Guldtuben ( Danish internet Award show ) i dont remember his name, but its about a month ago since that was on. Because the guy from Guldtuben roasted all the Youtubers there. So ya...
Most people there want to leave and that's how you know he did well
the awkward tension in the crowd omg LOVE U JON
he mentioning dodie made me sad bc jodie is dead :(
The shay carl roast was kind of rude but that's okay cuz I thought it was still funny lol
The shane part was awkward 👀
I wish he wrote more verses and roasted more people. This shit was gold!
The part with liza and Lilly is GOLD 😂
Can someone explain the Joey graceffa seaworld joke please? Thanks x
If you look at the crowd everyone is on their phone .
THIS IS SO GOOD
God I think I'm in love
Wouldn't you say that it was a Little gay guitar, Reference, anyone??????????
nobody remembers shananay in this room\nI LOVED THAT PART
His voice is so amazing
he's so cute i love this
he will most likely never be invited back on the streamys 😂
The shay Carl one 🤣😭
LAUREN LIZA LILY ALL THE L's that I like
Wait who did it first Liza or lily?😂
what an evil mother fucker. why the fuck did you upload this.
The audience is as dead as vine 😂😂
What's the ShayCarl diss? Texting?
Shay Carl = Dead
How dare you roast Liza?!?
I LOVE THIS😂
JON IS AMAZING AH
At least Liza and Lilly laughed.
aha when MAmrie mouthed mutha fucker i cried laughing!!!!!
Shane wss not having that joke☺😂
Hannah Hart looked shook
THAT WAS BRILLIANT
WAIT WHOS DODIE WITH
NO FUCKS GIVEN LOVE LOVE LOVE
DANG I LOVE JON
holy fucking shit
I CANT BREATH
I CANT BREATHE JON OMFG
SOOOOOOO SAVAGEEEEEE OMG
OH MY GOD
Aaaahhh Dodie was so awks cuz like there past omg i can't
Heart breaks when he mentions Dodie... Jodie forever 😂
DAMN SHAYCARL!
The Shane Dawson one though..... YIKES
KING OF YOUTUBE
Dead😂😂😂🙌🙌🙌🙌
Oml Jon Cozart is just slaying 😂😂😂
JON
MAMRIE SAMEEE
liza and lily i cant thats too true hahaha im dead
jon cozart is jughead jones
gg well played
100 layers of daddy issues screaming
holy shit
did jacksfilms not attend
MAMRIE WAS SHOOKETH AFTER HE ROASTED HANNAH
I miss shanaynay lmao and I love this so much
Liza was the only one who could laugh at herself :\
What's the point of watching the film now, just saw the best parts
Will Leah be making an appearance?
you cannot go wrong with Travolta as a bad guy...should be interesting
JEWS in hollywood insulted Gotti by letting Travolta play his part a knoe bisexual fat fuck tard...portraying a nyc tough guy\n\n\nliberal horseshit and mind fuck towards the snow flakes
Watching the trailer is enough to see that Armand looks and talks just like Gotti, Travolta doesn't even come close.
this trailer is just a summary of the whole movie
I don't see this making a big splash in the Box Office, Travolta is a good actor but he cant play a wise guy... Remakes are never a good thing... Hopefully it's a good movie. I'll watch only cuz of Travolta.
He was a racist I’m good
Perfect person for this role,i know john nailed it! Can't wait!
I dont understand why everyone thinks this looks so bad..
I'll just pirate it like every other movie in existence
Straight to DVD, just watch.
People like to see the invincible mafia movies but the stories of the mafia falling are good too. John Travolta is a perfect casting even though he's a lunatic
So far I'm not to impressed but we'll see I guess
looks like a nice fit for travolta.\n\ngood for him.
What I really don't understand is why is America praising the Italian mob knowing that they're no different from gangs in the street even games in the street or more organized just like the mob but my point is why is America praising the Italian mob by even renaming the Italian mob and calling them the American mob always trying to snatch something up for this country quick to make a movie about John Gotti this is the second movie I believe they made about John Gotti but did they ever make a movie about Tookie the founder of the Crips in California that's no different than the mob the only thing is that people believe the Crips started out as a gang but they started out as a positive image to protect their community against drugs and any other type of negativity this country is run by a bunch of bigots hypocrites and racist MF to continue two praise the Italian mob but when it comes to anything else pertaining to the minority like the Latin Kings the Decepticons the Bloods and the Crips the low life Nation you know me movies that's coming out in the theaters for them but they support the Italian mob and rename it the American mom like that's supposed to be a part of American history America is full of BS and I was born and raised here honestly I wish they never even showed this movie so damn disgrace.
Nay, will wait for it on Red box
Armand Assante did a great job playing Gotti in my opinion. He had that street swag. I like John Travolta. I really do, but for some reason I can't really see him pulling off this role. Most likely I'll still go and see it, but it feels like somethings missing.
Travolta will be great 👍👍 He can play so many different types of characters. Going to be a brilliant movie.
Travolta never convinces as a bad guy.  Vincent Vega wasn't played as a villain.
Good to see Hollywood making mob movies again.

How can JT play Gotti? No one who sang Sandy should play Gotti.
This is the 6th film about Gotti but the first one to see wide theatrical release.
Travolta knows how to pick great roles...I have to check it out 👍
Interesting to see this in theaters.
Nomination for the -best- most makeup
Hey, they're doing a film about the life of YO GOTTI!!!
This looks real good! JT back @ it!!!
why John Travolta always act like he's a macho guy ?! we know you're gay dude, David Miscavige got nothing to threaten you with !!
this will never top the gotti movie from 1996, also imo travolta trying way to hard with his ''mean face'' lol. and why they make a fag play john gotti, mafia is very much against gays
royal with cheese bet not fuck this up cause it looks pretty good
Damn Scientology is sucking the life out of him looks horrible
😂 how can you take this movie seriously when John travolta is in it!
what a strange but interesting choice casting Travolta. Will check it out. I really liked Armand Assante's portrayal.
This real? It isn’t a joke?
I can't believe a movie was made about this criminal scumbag.
This is just a remake.
CASTING TRAVOLTA FOR THIS PART WAS A BAD MOVE. I SEE THIS BEING AN EPIC FLOP.
Bad ass movie. Can't wait
All mafia movies are a success
1.34 hand on his stomach same body language he used in te scene in Pulp Fiction when he was getting upset with Keitel being abrupt with him.
Can’t wait to see it
One more American / Italian Mob movie , oh yeah.  Can't ever have too many ?
I wouldnt give a damn if i could watch it for free right now. No. John Travolta? Really? Wow
feel like I've just seen the whole film...
Who said there's no more mob? There sure is now its just under raidor they keep it secret now
Already seen it. \nSPOILER ALERT!!!\nJohn Turdvolta comes out of the closet, and Tom PoopCruiser is there for the meat and greet. Han Solo dies in this one. Its 2 hours of total gayness with John Turdvolta playing a gankster. When in reality, Mr Turdvolta spends his days chuggin cock and cough syrup in Tom PoopCruisers basement full of naked dudes. \nENJOY YOUR AIDS
Discover the man who showed THE WORLD (New York City) who's boss 
FUCK SICILY\nYou morons brought your bullshit to America -  just like the Muslims. \nFUCK YOU FUCKING USELESS SICILIAN PIECES OF SHIT\nYOU FAKE ITALIAN FUCKERS
I'm not gonna lie.  Before I watched this trailer, I was like the original is better.  But now, I wanna see this one. Looks good.
HOWARD SAINT WILL FALL TO THE PUNISHER ONCE AGAIN
really...we have a gotti movie...u couldnt do one on NICY SCARFO...I HATE WHEN THEY REDO GOOD MOVIES...GOTTI MOVIE IS OFF THE HOOK...WE DONT NEED ANOTHER ONE...STUPID AF
No.. this man whore a suit that made him a women
This film will either bomb or Travolta will get an Oscar nomination.
Sorry, but Armand Assante's performance in the movie Gotti was superb. Why the hell did they caste this guy Travolta.
Yikes, I cringed through that whole thing... Plenty of films about this dude already, and pretty sure no one cares about him anymore... Hollywood has lost touch.
Looks like the re-rebirth of Travolta. Salut.
Bad trailer but film looks good and travolta looks like he did a great job
I love the HBO one from the 90s but I'm willing to give this a try. Travolta can be a good actor when given a good script.
John Travolta's Finally Back!!! Can't wait...
The Movie Look Good But The Old One Will Always Be Classic💯
Go to google and type: *gamesecrx guide* You're going to get the only one free secret tool completely FREE for the game.
Odd.....  I didn't know Gotti was a closeted homosexual mafia kingpin!!!!
Is this the same Kevin Conoly who played E on Enterouge?
I thought it was about YO GOTTI when I say the title 😂
Don't see movies promoted by adherents to a stupid cult.
Move To The google search And Type: *gamesecrxguide facebook* This is without a doubt the only working facebook h@ck tool working from this month. Dont waste the available free time on some other methods
More movies glorifying, for all intensive purposes, evil.
This world will always have a GOTTI  [ Bob Proctor ]
his imatation is not that good of gotti. looks the part but they could have found someone who really talks like gotti
John Travolta as Gotti... WOW, what a waste of money xD
This movie going be lit🔥
This looks fucking terrible. Travolta does NOT make a good Gotti. Armand Assante is the only decent portrayal of Gotti in a movie.
What a load of garbage
another Gambino movie
lmfao, he sounds fucking horrible, nothing like gotti sounded.
Gotti was a rat fuck rats.
This shit look wack.

Esta mierda de trabolta o trebol es siempre lo mismo pura cagada de zorrillo pinches directores no saben buscar gente que traiga reating pinche viejo no vale verga y ahi lo traen.
Deniro could have been better
Wheres sammy the bull?
*HA! GOTTI!*
This looks sick
Ehhhhh
the texas chainsaw massacre 03' & 04'
Tear sixth hole faith colleague belief depression their juice margin choice card.
Travolta should stick to sucking guys dicks
LMFAO! Stupid whop bastards.
Issa flop!
Travoltas face sure looks dicked up.   He needs more surgery.  Lol
Faceoff 2
Aha, gadeem.
Gay/10
I find it funny how Hollywood always cast pussies like Travolta to play gangster types like Gotti lol...
this is a insult... i knew most of the original gangsters and half of this isn't even true.. other then the hit on Big Paul.
I can’t picture Travolta playing Gotti
Glorifying a bunch of thugs, where are the fathers?

Everything you do is so original Zoe. That's what I love most about your channel. Keep going. Counting down to your shop opening. So excited for you. Wish you infinite success. Love ya.
This is adorable Zoe and the little mermaid and seahorse are so cute. Beautiful cake. Tfs 🤗👍🏻😊👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thanks for the idea. It's lovely, quite easy to follow and I'm sure will take me ages 😄 x
So pretty! ❤️
Can you do a corset cake? This is amazing..
That’s brilliant Zoe! You always make it look so much more simple than it is. How many coffee slices would this cake serve?
How beautiful, just love it! How would you transport this three tiered cake to the venue?
Beautiful as always!
Maravilhoso
Just loved it
Awesome! Can you make an anime inspired cake pls? Like Inuyasha or Ichigo?
Would love to see you make a shark cake!
Can you plz make a slugterra cake topper because your method is very clear and I love your videos and I wanted to make a slugterra themed cake for my little brothers birthday cake! Thank you so much
Awesome job again Zoe! Thanks for sharing. x
wow cake sweet
Wow amazing as always you made it look so easy your so talented 😀💁🏻
Such a cute cake! I love your tutorials! Thanks for taking the time to teach us!
So so pretty 😍😍 .. Thanks for sharing
Amazing, this is such a cute cake,x
This cake is beautiful as are all of your works. If you take requests or ideas could you do characters from a cartoon called Kate and Mim-mim? There are 6 main characters, Kate, Mim-mim, Tac, Gobble, Lily, and Boomer. I think they are adorable and the colors of the land they live in, Mimaloo, are so vibrant. I think you could do an amazing job with these characters.
Y are the best cake designer .. love you from Iraqi ❤
Beautiful  job!
Beautiful as always
Awesome video
Nicely done, Zoe! I like the textured sides made to look like waves. Those little details (and the overall artistic ability) really separates a grocery store cake vs your creations.
can u plz do a wolfcake
perfeito
much puppy
Fantastic!!!!
Молодец!
Che amore !!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Awesome tutorial Zoe! This is so cute! 😋
Love your work!!
Can you make a boss baby cake ?? 😊
Now, I know it takes you more than 5 minutes to pull these things together, but you make it look so easy!  I love your designs, and this one is no exception!  <3
You are Awesome!
As always, it looks soooo amazing.
Truly amazing!
WOW! perfect cake!
We want real mermaid cake like areil
Lovely
Wow  beutifull wow exelente
Hi, Zoe. Your mermaid cake looks beautiful, just like you. Thanks again for another lovely cake.
Amazing as usual and I love that you cater for all levels of skills
That seahorse is so adorable! Zoey I've been with you for a long time now and yet you continue to amaze me with your talent, keep it up! 🙂
Yeh I'm the first
Play Christensen regularly he's our next great center back.
Batshuayi is brilliant but Morata is better, well done Chelsea for beating Atletico Madrid in their new stadium it was magic so very happy 😊
If Batshuayi worked on his movement, he could compete with Morata as his finishing is just as good. Morata's movement is on another level though.
Every week I watch these videos William is always doing skills, does he even concentrate on actual football
Willian should definitely start his YouTube channel side by side similar to F2 Freestylers...
Play Musonda more
Victor Moses can speak
Well done boys! Lets beat city 💪💪
David Luiz 😂😂 0:11
COME ON CHELSEA 🔵💙
Play musonda ..it will be fun seeing delph chase him for 10 or so mins
Willian should practise passing and not those stupid skills
Chelsea❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Aguero got in a car accident
Please play Kenedy and musonda more
Willian should be behind Musonda in the squad has any one noticed Willian gives the ball up after Chelsea push forward all time with him in attack he passes or shows of to much and looses possession no disrespect his a great player but we’ve got better and his wasting to many chances in such critical games
Michy is still young n has plenty of room to improve his football at chelsea fc. He will soon become a star at the club.
People bashing on Willian are total idiots. They guy is amazing and he can practice the skills if he wants.. Yes, sometimes he does silly things. Don't attack him. Every player does mistakes.
*MORATA >>>>>>>>>>> Aguero*
Chelsea squad 11 12 =< Chelsea squad now\n\nAre they gonna win ucl
Willian should create a YouTube Football Freestyle Channel because that's all he's about these days & leave football for men, smh
Michy doesn't know how to play with his strengths. Otherwise he would have been a good player. Atm he is just average.
Been noticing Batshuayi wearing old F50 boots why is that ?
today tactically technically Conte he got it wrong
Yo moses's english is on point didnt expect tht
Who's ready to for FIFA 18 today and Wreck teams with Chelsea FC!?
Show more of hazard in training
only 2 days preparation for the city game is a joke!!! but i believe in the boys to get the win. #COYB💙💙
Does anyone know what sneakers Morata is wearing? The white ones? Looks like Addidas
4:17\nwhy two pairs for the match? does he change them at half-time?
Mitchy is too fat! Get some fat loss diet & exercise!
This channel needs more content same thing every week\n We need more in depth look. Also longer footage
Let's pick up where we left off boys!
Cahill well played on Wednesday. You deserve more credit sometimes
Some of ya'll so disrespectful, Willian has carried the team by himself so many times when they other players are under performing. The most consistent player in our shirt for the pass 5years. #FakeFans 😡
The Wanda Metropolitano is no joke, that is one fresh, footballing arena!
Bats has to rethink his bags lol
We deserved more goals but well played chelsea. Our dominance in the game was crazy.\n#ktbffh\n#coyb
Все равно Батшуаи деревянный!!!))))
Come on boys, same ting as last years let’s sweep City under the rug.
how you doing Chelsea fans
Willian works very hard
lovely
Batshuayi = training legend
Boys lets focus city game
Williann ...... 🙄🙄🙄
Chelsea 💙💙
Esse David Luiz 😂😂😂
CHEELLLSSEEEAAAAAA
Morata or lukaku?
Batschuayi on wednesday night made me happy for the first time in UEFA champions league since 2012
IF YOU SUPORT CHELSEA COMMENT UNDER THIS CHELSEA ARE THE BEST
Michy on fire🔥
Breaking News Aguero got in a car accident and is out for two months. He won't be playing against Chelsea. 😫😫😫😭😭😭
Sou brasileiro, mais amo o Chelsea desde pequeno.\nVamos, vamos Chelsea  blue
I love the fact they are training at the stadium. Very shrewd move by Conte. All teams should be doing this to make their home stadium a fortress.
willian should improve in playing always concentrates on dribbling
Goodbye zuma
HAZARD <> MORATA <> MUSONDA
Morata, Pedro and Alonso are besties
Enjoyed watching every minute.
We love this! Shared: https://www.imbikemag.com/mountain-bike-news/2017/09/course-preview-round-8-ews-finale-ligure-ita-2017/
crazy trails.reminds me of runs in Ocho Rios ,Jamaica
trails look amazing ! just a thought but is the bike industry investing in advancing the wrong technology ? carbon fibre frames ,electronic controled suspension etc etc  .championships won and lost with punctures FFS  \nthe pneumatic tyre was invented in 1843 in scotland using bitumen and sail cloth near dundee .  Its mental that 170 years later \n championships in motor sport and  bike sport are won and lost by loosing air from a tyre !    Thomson was only 23 years old when he patented his pneumatic tyre. He was granted a patent in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847.[2] His tyre consisted of a hollow belt of India-rubber inflated with air so that the wheels presented a cushion of air to the ground, rail or track on which they run. This elastic belt of rubberised canvas was enclosed within a strong outer casing of leather which was bolted to the wheel. Thomson's Aerial Wheels were demonstrated in London's Regent's Park in March 1847 and were fitted to several horse-drawn carriages, greatly improving the comfort of travel and reducing noise. One set ran for 1200 miles without sign of deterioration.
Sam Hill for the WIN!!!
Riders gonna go reaall fast on these trails. Lotsa rocks and flow.
I have such a hard on for racing, cus its viable to the industry, and thats all that maters
Doing an EWS course preview on an e-bike..that's just wrong on so many levels\n\nGreat trails tho
he rode the e bike like he nicked it.some right views all the best to racers
great! thank you!
awesome.
Awesome, can't wait.
sick!
The Italian guy's awesome!
looks a lot like the local trails we have here in Hong Kong ... COOL !!
Enduro has it's own Claudio...
I don't get it why do you upload some here and others in the EWS channel? Such a mess this year.
E bike........gross
Chomp.
Hey Emmy *Waves Excitedly*
Now I am hungry :O
CHOMP!! 🍥🍛
Chomp.
*Hella fresh food *_* *
Thumbs up.
Chomp

Adopt me!
Your thumbnail made me hungry😍

Ahh I love these videos! ❤
I love this videoioooo
You're so pure omg.
Ugh
Wow so yummy
Chomp
Ayo we're on trending
I love your shirt

Seltzer water tastes like pennies.
Yaaaay!
Chomp. 😊
Chomp :)
Gains :P
Chomp x
Please share your burrito recipe and homemade pizza too. Thanks ;)
What does bee pollen taste like?
Yaaassss. I've been expecting you.
“Chomp” x
My favorite thing about this, is that you don't completely cut all the junk out. You don't regularly consume it, but you do indulge
I lost 10 lbs just from listening to this lol 😂
I love your videos!  I also have two little boys :) and drink fizzy water all day long, it's the best!  It feels like a treat and keeps me hydrated.
The secret of her beauty
u motivate me to eat, I haven't enjoyed eating in the past few days
this all looks healthy but if you think about all the carbs @-@ I’d probably gain 10 pounds in a week by this diet. But your food looks so good!!! 😩💕
Wow. That's a lot of grains and carbs. Not into paleo I guess. If I ate that much carbs I would gain lots of weight. But portion control means everything I guess.  That and she's got good genes.
Having a preschooler and a school age child does keep a Mom very busy
Emmy pls pls pls make a video on your Pad See Ew. 😍😍
where did you get the narutomaki?
I love your name!
THAT UDON LOOKS SO GOOD, I'VE BEEN CRAVING SOME, PLEASE TELL US  HOW TO MAKE IT
What are those pink things in the noodle dish
I drink lots of water, too.  I drink at least a half gallon a day.
My brain (to stomach): Yah see? This is why we can't get up the stairs fast enough!!!!
Emmy! Look at these crazy retro recipes! \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolRidiculous/comments/68bsg0/my_day_is_never_too_busy_to_eat_this/  and  http://i.imgur.com/IhExOzx.png\n\nYou have to make them!
I wonder if the seltzer water might be the culprit behind all the burp outtakes :D
Emmy, you should get a Soda Stream. Love my fizzy water, and your boys will love the fart noises the machine makes!
No offense but....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAin't nobody got time for that
I have been waiting so long for another one of these! 😮😄😍
You know when you watch Emmy's videos the hunger strikes
You should have an EmmyMade recipe and meal plans book!
First of all I adore you. You are probably my fave on YouTube, have you tried the POLAR or GOYA brand of flavor seltzer water  it's really good not too strongly flaverd more like an aroma. I'm a pepsi drinker trying to you know kick the habit and it's working.
I thought the bowl in the thumbnail was a colander and I was really confused about how you managed to keep the liquid in.
I love a good handful of nuts
Day 1 - Day 7 Breakfast -Dinner = rice rice and more rice for me :D
How did you change that habit from constant soda to tasteless water? Was the transition hard at first? Sorry to ask, I'm just in the same predicament and I would really like to know how you changed your habit.
I wanna be in her family so I can eat the spicy ramen cuz my mom trippin
I was expecting a burp at the end of the video as I've gotten used to....
Portion control has been a big hurdle for me!! I just get so ravenous when I'm hungry! I started drinking a full glass of water before each meal, and it helps a lot :)
I love fizzy water too! My favorite right now is Topo Chico! Especially the one with lime!
Okay so.. I don't eat half that and I'm 3 times bigger. .. I think I need to eat more rice. ....
Hey Emmy. I love in a small town in Northern MI and I would love to try Natto but I don't know where I can get any. Is there a certain place you get yours from? Thanks😊
I would love to see a La Croix taste test of all of the flavors!!!
What's a 'vegan' chicken pot pie ?
I love food presentation it makes me happy when my plate looks pretty lol
I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old as well!
Do you buy fizzy water or do you have a home machine?
2:30 huh, that's kinda weird that's a pretty seasonal Vietnamese dish we only make close to the Chinese New Year, unless they're frozen and thawed.
Hey Emmy check out this YouTube channel  Bellaboos lunches the mom makes lunches for her daughter I think you’ll like it
I love fizzy water too. It took me ages when i was young to get used to it but again like you. Didn't like still water! Love adding aople juice or something into it :)
I really like the hello fresh recipes. Are you a stay at home mom?
I'd love to see video recipes for some of these things like the udon noodle soup and the Burmese pickled salad.
Do a video of your daily routines
Love your videos so much 😀😀😀
How do you bite so fast at the end xD
I love, love, love your what you eat in a week videos!!!  And I wish I could live with you, because your meals always look soooo fabulous!!!
Would you show us the burrito method? I would vegify it, but the technique is the same x
I like how small your portions are, especially that sandwhich and bagel. Makes me think I should do that too
I eat one maybe twice a day and I eat less then you and somehow I gain weight. How
Udon noodle (thick udon) soup is incredible and very easy to make. I add lots of fish cake, scallops and bok choy. I add 4 eggs on top and also splash my serving with sriracha sauce...mmm. I make my own chicken bone stock first as my base for the udon.\nGreat video and that's why I love Emmy's diversity with her food to show everyone what is yum-yum to eat in this world.\nCHOMP
If someone want's an actual opinion about hellofresh,I'm going to write a bit about them since I'm a customer.\nI buy their three-meal boxes.They cost 39 € (In germany), so this option would cost approximately 46 dollars.Their boxes are indeed somewhat pricy,but the recipees are really varied,especially the vegetarian boxes (which I order) are good to try out some new things.I'm a little bit picky when it comes to food and because I paid for the boxes,I actually try new things,which I normally wouldn't do:D.
the end is gold hahaha :D
Watching this video when you're hungry.. it's just pure torture. Everything looks so good.
Seeing the McDonald's there in your video made me feel so much better. I strayed alway from fast food, but now that I'm working and my son started school, I barely have time to do anything. I definitely need to up my healthy food game though.
I assume you also stay very active, what with having the toddlers. I mention that because I intake about half the calories that you do and actually have issues not gaining weight (but I'm a night person, so my outdoor activities are somewhat limited). (Had I waited a few seconds to comment I would have heard you mention the toddlers and going to the gym).
Try to pan fry the sticky rice cake, cut them into slices and fry until golden brown, it's a treat
thank you for sharing. I love drinking lemon water
When are you going on Hot Ones?
gym once a week?!! u joking girl dont lie
I'm glad to see that you're not a crazy health nut and slip in some normal food, even a trip to mcD' s. thanks for being a normal person Emmy
i love oatmeal!! thanks to you,and your advice about portion control, i have gotten slimmer than ive ever been, i am so grateful 💕.
Omg I have been watching you since I was in year 7! Now I am in year 12 almost graduating! kdhkaaihdj
Vegan chicken pot pie? How did you do it!!!!!!!!!
Can you make more recipe videos? I mean of normal food not the you made what?
If you still have some of the saft from IKEA (or something concentrated like it) it is absolutely delicious in sparkling water! We used to have it like soda when I was a kid.
I loved that we could see you explaining things in this video! I like the other videos but I just really liked this style. Also love the way you put your sponsors in, it isn't annoying and it doesn't take up a huge amount of the video which is nice.
CAn you please share your vegan chicken pot pie recipe? As a vegetarian I would love to learn that!
Hi Emmy!  I have been watching and loving your videos for like 3 weeks now. I only just subscribed.  Anyway,  can you suggest some tasty sweet vegetarian eggless recipes for  about say 4 yr olds, maybe something that includes oats/other protein cereal in disguised form. I have a picky eater at home but he enjoys sweets. Love you bye.
Love you Fleur! It was you that I started watching YouTube because of. Hope you're feeling well xxx
The lighting on this video is a dream. You look gorgeous, pregnancy suits you. <3
Totally impressive. ^.^
Ooh what nail polish are you wearing??
I enjoy your videos SO MUCH😍
Love this! Would totally recommend the new Clarins cushion foundation too! The perfect finish, buildable coverage (big deal for something with problem skin like me!) and just feels beautiful on the skin! x
thumbs up hun 🤗 x
<3
❤️❤️❤️
That brown eyeliner really makes your green eyes stand out. So gorgeous!
Great products! I'm definitely going to try the concealer and the hair spray. Thanks a lot :)P. S. You look absolutely amazing as always.
Will you ever come to Slovenia? 😊
Perfect timing for the train journey home! That Estee BB cushion is on my list!! Xx
What about your sweater? 😊
You look lovely Fleur❤️
Nice nails
That perfume bottle was cute
Some great favs! xxx
Fleur you're so gorgeous in every video 💕
Yay! I love favourites videos <3 :)
What shampoo and conditioner do you usually use on your hair?xx
So kind of disappointed because I love French Grey from Elizabeth and Jame, and I don't think you really gave it a chance. The scent smells different when you first spray it, it's a bit harsh, but 30 minutes into it it smells so much better, and delicious. But love your videos, and enjoy seeing your videos.
Hi.   Love, love love your video’s, and pregnancy updates, can u tell me what u use to curl your hair.   Thanks.  😘😘
Tell me, please, what firm and where did you buy your earrings? look very nice) Thank you for the video!))
Thanks for the reviews!  Love your nail color!  What is it?  PS, if you haven't tried Burberry Brit Rhythm fragrance, please do!  It is beautiful...im on my 3rd bottle and get compliments all the time.  😊
What nail polish are you wearing? It's beautiful! 😍
Please YouTube. Is there any way in heaven or hell that Fleur de Force does not appear on my trending list. I cannot stand her.
Having a Fleur binge tonight and the pregnancy videos are actually making me broody!! Love you so much Fleur!!😍😘
I love your channel it’s been my absolute favourite for years 😍 have you tried any of the Zoeva eye shadow pallets, I always hear so many good things about the brushes but nothing about their makeup and I would love to know!
I just saw your episode on all4 where you are cooking lasagna 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
I really enjoy how Fleur talks about products, it's very honest and light :)
Amazing! love the video!!
Hi Fleur!  Can you tell me which are the two scents you dont love as much from Elizabeth & James?  I've only ever tried the white one and love it, so curious about the rest..
Loved the video Fleur! Your makeup looked beautiful! What color is the By Terry lipstick? Was number 28 pecan nude the correct color? I just wanted to double check because it looked a lot darker on the website and not mauve (but it could be the online pictures). Thanks!
I'm fairly new to your videos and am absolutely loving them! You mentioned that you usually have some go-to drugstore concealers ...and chance of a video about your fave drugstore products? ❤️💋💞
Which of the Elizabeth & James fragrances do you not like? Besides the French Grey....I find that you and I have similar taste in fragrance.... I haven't tried the amethyst one yet.... but I LOVE Bourbon
the lighting in this video is superb and it only augments your beauty, mademoiselle.
Are all the Estée Lauder eyeliners that good or just the Victoria Beckham ones???
Oooo I wanna try the new Elizabeth and James Perfume , I have two but I can't get it anywhere near me :-(
Loving your nail polish, what is it?? ☺️
Love this video Fleur! Does anyone happen to know when the Estée Lauder BB Cushion will be available in Canada? Or if it's called something else here?
thyanks for thoughts on the new Elizabeth and James launches.  Nirvana Rose is still my firm favorite, but the whole line is incredible.  It was nice to hear your thoughts on the new ones.
I need to know what this lip color is!
Your nail polish ! 🙌🏼 what is it???
I'm surprised you liked the Estée Lauder Double Wear BB Cushion: I'm opposite on the skin- type spectrum to you- I am very oily. I've never liked the EL Double Wear, because it tends to look heavy. I find the same with the BB Cushion. Maybe I'm using it wrong. It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.
You looks so pretty as always thanks babe
Love this. So excited for mini de force! Thank you for inspiring me to upload my first video X
Estee Lauder is always wonderful! I love their products ❤️✨
Hello Fleur, your reviews are immensely helpful for the beauty/youtube world. You are gorgeous and I've loved your channel for a while. xo
I love the packaging on the Sam McKnight hair care, very expensive and elegent looking.
❤️❤️❤️ you're so sweet and so pretty!   I'm obsessed with creamy smooth eyeliners. It's so much easier to glide on
Need to check some of these out
I knew the cushion foundation would make it in your favourites, I really want to try it xx
By Terry has been on my list for ages but I can never justify the purchase when there are less expensive items I like...Though, I'm sure I'd love whatever I got and never look back!
7 favs and I want to buy 4 of them now...Well 5 but I am not paying for the VB eyeliner as I think that range is overpriced, but everyone is saying how nice the eyeliner is.... Evo is an Australian brand so nice to see that mentioned!
Fleur, what Shadow are you wearing here? Also, could you share your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tillbury pallet? It looks gorgeous but I'm undecided if it's worth the cost.... thanks!
Please do a video about your ear piercings!  They are so pretty!  What jewelry brands to you love?  Thanks!
love that elizabeth & james perfume! great video! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I also love elizabeth and james perfume but it winds up trending too sweet on me.  That eyeliner looks like a dream <3
You should try some of the Korean cushion foundations (Laneige, Hera, Missha). They have medium to high coverage and still gives out a very natural finish and feeling on your skin. And color range wise, they are seriously fair/pale! Thanks for the recommendations, hopefully I'll be able to find this styling spray in Switzerland! We have Batiste, it's already a good thing!\nI legit cannot wait for the little princess to come! 😍 Sending lots of love to you and your lovely family!
You are so lovely and down-to-earth 😍 Pregnancy really suits you. Love from Finland 🇫🇮
You're so beautiful Fleur! x
Short and sweet are my ❤️
I love your makeup look it's so simple and your eyes go really well with that lip colourrrr
Keep well.  Thanks for the video.
I love your earrings Fleur! Where did you get them? Can I find them online? I would really appreciate it if you could answer me :)
Yours are the only favourites video I watch, love them! What are you wearing through your brows? They look more defined yet softer if that even makes sense ..?
I'm just excited for the new in October video:DD
Hi Fleur! What lip color are you wearing??
Hi fleur love your monthly favourites videos.would love to try the purfume.as always you look fab.xx😀
Literally cannot remember the last time I filmed a faves. You look great Fleur xxx
Your makeup always looks incredible!!! 😍👌🏻 As do your nails! You always have the prettiest colors on!!
I really really love this British accent, I want to speak like this, but I caaan't it's don't matching with my mouth 😂😩
Love that scent! Smells a lot like another favorite of mine, Aerin's Amber Musk (which I think I pick up after you recommended it in a video??)
Also obsessed with the new Perfume from E&J it is smokey perfection
I went to purchase the concealer but confused by the colours. Have you seen the other 2 lighter colours Fleur? I usually have the lightest shade in concealers, as I'm very fair but on Really Rees review the swatches came up looking really pink for 1, and really orange for 2. Your one at no 3 looks really light and more natural looking, is it at all orangey? Kate x
I love your sweater! =)
You look absolutely beautiful dahhhling!
Evo do the best blonde toning conditioner - I find that most purple/silver shampoos are a bit drying, but the conditioner is amazing and tones more than any shampoo I've tried!
Perfect lip color 🔥
Hi Fleur, will you be going vlogtober or vlogmas at all this year? Just curious I love your videos 😊
EVO styling products are amazing! The salon I work at was one of the first to carry the Australian based line, and they knock it out of the park with styling and masks!
Aww Fleur you are absolutely beaming , thanks for another great monthly vid. I can't wait till your little one comes along sooooo exciting & there is a real baby boom on YouTube 😘💜✨😘
your make up is beautiful :)
I'm seriously thinking about trying that cushion if they make a shade light enough for me. Hope you are feeling well. Hugs, Summer xo
No matter where I am, I always feel at home when watching Fleur's videos 💕
I found E&J fragrances in Fenwick as well.
I absolutely love these videos! Although I'm sure I say that about all videos you make😂 love you lots Fleur xxx❤️❤️❤️
👍❤️good favourites & I loved it a lot
The sultry eye look suits you so well, beautiful ❤
Can anyone explain to me what the point of the cushion in the foundation is? Is it just a gimmick or what. I got the L'Oréal one and it's useless.
My YouTube unsubscribed from your channel 🙁🙁🙁 not good YouTube
Who was here before 500views
Just now commenting. But as always STOP WHATEVER YOUR DOING AND WATCH. My most intrigued item on this video is the new Elizabeth and James scent. I definitely didn't care for it too much when I first smelt it but I guess I should give it another try since Fleur recommends it. Love you always.
Need daily vlog...fluer...missing everyone 😍😘😁
What's the point in making the elizabeth and james perfumes exclusive to harrods? So you can only get it if you live in london or visit london? And the only way you can sample them to find out if you even like the scent is to visit the store. That's just bullshit. Who do they think they are? Do they think their product is so special and exclusive that only certain people deserve it? No way I'm buying their perfume now. We're talking about mary kate and ashley here, they need to get their heads out of their arses.
Hi Fleur would you consider doing  a video on your eyebrow routine?  They always good. Thanks.
Whats on ur nails? Have been seeing this a lot on ur videos! Thanks!
The by Terri blush looks lovely, but I can get over the fact that it looks like a nipple in the compact 🤦🏼‍♀️
In general I like your videos, but I really do not like the way you use affiliate links and not marking them as affiliate links. And I find it quite strange that you link to two Estee Lauder products to two different websites instead of just linking to Estee Lauders page, its obvious that its because of rstyle.me. Its so sad, because you do this in every video and it almost feel like youre not being candid to your viewers. I hope you change the way you do the info bar in the future :)
Im 16 right now and I ain't really had a bad life it's been good just always been short on money so my family struggles a little and this film really helped me because   recently I've not been in the right state of mind like I've been on the edge of throwing away my life and getting involved in things I shouldn't because of the way society is nowadays it just glamorises this kind of badman life and I was seriously considering getting involved in it like one sentence and my life could've been changed In a moment but this film brought me back to reality it really did and I feel it saved me it's a great message man and I think more people need to see this
Nice
Ufff
BEAUTIFUL XXX...
Ayyy big one, croydon homieeee
Inspirational
did he release the songs separate from the film?????
I don't thumbs up many vids but this is one that gets it shit is dope defo do another
Love from MONTREAL CANADA FAM. I don’t even mess with grime like that but the way he promoted this is genius, beautiful, pure and relatable.
Each to there own but for me Another reason to dislike British music.
That is hard AF
6:15-6:34 his bomber jacket is straight fire. Wonder where I can cop his jacket.\n\nAnyways,\nGreat film from Stomzy about the life and death in the hood in the UK (where he grew up).
he's come so far
What's the first song called
Best and most influential video for this generation
Whoever be dislikin this is on some heavy crack
Mum deserve all the 100 bags .ghanaian queen indeed bless her.ghana is always winning 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
VERY AWAKENING. VERY WELL EXECUTED. THANK YOU.
Stormz always goin in hard 🔥🔥
What an amazing video.
Excellent.
Thug Life !! L.O.V.E !!
mad
Good
Sick and fire 🔥😝
🙌🏽
Thomas looks like hakkz
What's the first song that played?
🙌
rudeboi shut up
nice
pulled at my heart, many grime(& rap obv) artists have spoken about life on the streets but the way Stormzy breaks it down is undeniable. Big up yourself for keeping it really real <3
yo, the fucking second beat, the orchestral one, it is outta this world.. surely the instrumental is out there somewhere? anyone got it? fucking gassed
whaT a video..👐
ayy🔥🔥
STORMZY!!!!!!!!!!
MAD TING!!!
madness
Sickest movie yet
Smh..#Merky You lead They follow Fam
Mad ting
Wow
Amazing
Who Jah bless\nNo man curse 💓💓
This based on Crazy Titch?
Spectacular
Great Film🔥👌🏾
My man Stormzy ur an inspiration
AAYYYYYY Ghanaian Queen
Art
RAW
A-F***ING-MAZING pure 🔥🔥🔥
My man basit main kid in this damn well in G
Luv this, nice job! Would've liked a longer, focused film with more depth, details and showing the climb to success. A more diverse cast would have been 👌 Powerful, necessary, poignant message that (I hope) will hit home for those who need it. Congrats to all involved with this project. Salute!!
stormzy release this song as a single so I can listen to this all the time som1 do it plz
Motivational stuff
Stormz we need a movie man!!!
This message very much needed to be told
why isint this number one on trending youtube make it happen
I'm 9ja made and I'm Michael 😏👊🏾
Your the dark the light the dark knowledge
Stromzy May Allah bless you and your family Ameen , I'm a mum I showed it to my son and my nephew please keep up The good work and I love the way in end you showed love to your mum your mum is luck women may Allah bless her Ameen
Oh damn this actually got more than one dislike.
Oasis made rock n roll \nStormzy MADE Grime ! \n\nFucking epic on so many levels
Lukaku is on top. Whats the bald man doing in the barbershop?
more of a long music video than a film
When KSI and Lukaku have a child
Jheez, what a role model this man is. GQ man of the year? No-one came close....
One  of   the best films I have ever seen that combines the blood of the street with the spirit of philosophy. Who  Jah bless...tindrum13
Wow this will explode. This is amazing.
Much love from the states fam
New album from Bugzy and geovarn check this out is lit \nhttps://youtu.be/CoIa__NqNkE
2 WAYS ON THE STREETS SHITS YOU BE DEAD OR PRISON MOST DEFINITELY.
Stormzy just tells the truth about everything its what grime should be
yea stormzy we're gonna need a separate video for bad boys
which songs are in there?
Basit is my mate goes to same school
Nice...love the message nuff love from Ny❤️
Stormzy Just raised the bar like if you agree 💪
God didn't give you to hands to sit around praying 😶
Message in the beginning was so amazing
The people chatting shit about this album don't get it. Stormzy went against the demand for a hard banger album and wanted to make something that he actually wanted to make. This has a lot more meaning than other UK rap albums. It's an excellent album.
Tony is Konan in 20 years (only in looks)
I swear the boy goes to my school 😂
What is the first song called
Is there no heights that the problem won't reach...
Stormzy should do when plan b did with ill manors release and album make a film filmed with the music
rate this so much wish it was longer will definitely win awards
Best short film I ever watched
THIS IS SOME GOOD SHIT RIGHT THERE
that womans voice at the start though...fucking hell...no one talks like that
This man is MY HERO.
This is basically a bunch of raps this aint a movies
This goes hard, soooooooo hard, I Finna watch this again that how good it is.
This is hard but it need to be longer
This is movement!! Just took things to a next level 📸🎥🎩 man of the year fully proven with this film. \nInspiring the world.
I'm the tall peng white kid from 5:03 to 5:30 any modelling companies or acting companies hmu 07388332347/killaj9@outlook.com 😂😂😂
THIS SONG WILL WIN SOME TYPE OF AWARD. \nInstagram @therealangelafang
Lame af
Stormzy just set new levels for the scene!!! This is Heavy 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Gwaaaan B!!!!
Sooo flattered that my name was dropped 🙈🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 luv ya girl
What?!?!? The Charlotte Tilbury’s Instant Eye Palette is so experience, I would rather get a Viseart palette which is 80 US dollars and have better quality.........
I spy Rapha bibs in the background on your door handle. #bikewifestruggles 😂

Happy Birthday Anna!!
🎂​😘​
sumptuous olive by MAC!
Aww happy birthday Anna !:) you look awesome in those jeans 😁✊🏽xx
Loved this vlog Anna, Happy belated birthday ! You deserve everything you wish for and more , xx
Happy Birthday.  The minutae of someone else's life often is riveting on a vlog!  And the desserts looked unutterably amazing!  Not for the first time on YouTube I found myself experiencing Gastronomic Envy!
Happy belated Birthday from Germany - Love your videos and recommendations!
LOVEEE that color on your eyes!! and happy birthday!!
Mark is the sweetest!
A really good khaki green/grey shimmery eyeshadow is Dior's millennium. It's a bizarre putty-type consistency but works really well on its own or layered for a glossy look.
Max Factor Golden Nudes palette has a similar looking colour in it
Happy Belated Birthday, Anna!!! I absolutely love your videos and how real & down to earth you are!! You are a joy to watch and I wish I could hang out with you in person!!!! Your eye makeup looks amazing in this video!!!
I bought the DesixKaty Dose of Colours collab and Anna you need it in your life. Id say we are similar in complexions so the lipsticks are just way too nude, but the shadows are fab! Like you said the green shade is just unreal. If you want (no pressure whatsoever because I don'​t know if you'll see this) I did make a quick blog post about the items I got. My images are nowhere near as professional as yours because you are goals :D (https://ceritolemanblog.wordpress.com/2017/09/21/desi-x-katy-and-dose-of-colors-collaboration-review/)
You look a bit like Emma Stone 😍
Would love you to do more ethical fashion stuff - it's a real interest of mine and would love to hear about new brands!
Seriously Mark is the sweetest. Bf/husband goals right there ! Happy late birthday
Oh, and obviously happy birthday from a fellow Virgo :)
There is a Maybelline colour tattoo called 102 Fantasy that I have that looks to be the exact same colour as that Charlotte tilbury eyeshadow worth a look maybe!
Happy belated birthday so excited to see you're putting out really personable content this year 😇& a good shout out to Jackie aina is always nice 😂
I use the L'Oreal Eye Paint in Keep on Khaki as a really nice khaki green colour, I'd really recommend it, and it is nice and cheap!
Oh my gosh, TO EVERYONE WHO IS CHECKING THE COMMENT BOX BEFORE WATCHING THIS VIDEO: WATCH IT UNTIL THE END!!!!!!!!!!! 😂\nHappy birthday Anna, it has been such a relaxing chatty vlog, I adored it. X Chiara
Omg! We have the same birthday! I turned 22. I've been meeting so many people with the same birthday lately. Loved watching this. Happy Birthday, Anna! Love what you do.
Wow you're eyelashes look insane! Love the darker eyeshade too. Happy birthday Anna!! x
Virgos unite!   Was there a newsletter for September?  I am dying to see your newsletter!!
Happy birthday love! That eye shadow looks amazing on you, and Mark is right! you two chatting is quality content!
i liked those boots when you showed them the first time, but I absolutely LOVED them!!
Happy Birthday Anna, the ten spot from grammy made my day!
Hey Anna! Happy Birthdaaay! A good dup of the eyeshadow i think is a Sephora eyeshadow in brown diamonds 😁 xxx
You are the loveliest and sweetest people on Earth! Without knowing you I love you you are the best 💖👌😘😉🎁👍
Happy birthday Anna!!!! 💐🎂lovely video, you and Mark are so sweet! 😍hugs from Italy🇮🇪💚
Anna try sumptuous olive from mac as a dupe and tell me what you thing
Anna! I'm curious why you never put eyeshadow on your bottom lash line? Love the eye look though! x
I'm glad you had a happy birthday 🤗
Happy Birthday Anna! I love Mark's face plant at the end 🤣
Happy Birthday, the eyeshadow looks very similar to greensmoke from mac
Literally I'm the same with birthdays! More chilled the better!
Aw, loved this vlog Anna!! And happy birthday too! xx
A youtuber you need to watch is Karima Mckimie! She's so nice and funny
So glad I stayed till the last second!
Happy Birthday! Great blog, thank you. Can't wait for the next newsletter to drop!
We share a birthday! If it was the 27th? I turned 29.... I can't come to terms with that tbh haha
Happy belated birthday Anna hope you had a lovely day
Sleek palette had a dupe! maybe the storm one? &Happy Birthday!
Belated Happy Birthday! Maybe have a look at Clinique Willow Pop as a dupe, it's also in the golden khaki colour range :-)
Anna, I love your positivity!
Happy Birthday Anna! \nI was listening to your 'At home with.. Zoella' podcast and could relate to your chat about viewers not making themselves known... I've been watching your videos for years and love your content but have never commented... So I thought would take the plunge and say Hi! (And I am totally envious of your brows!).. Rose x
Happy Birthday!!!!! I think Olive from MAC might be a nice dupe? Love your channel as well as most of the other blogger’s you mentioned!
Happy belated to a lovely lady...
Nice! And lóve the eye shadow! As for a tip for a dupe for the colour! Urban Decay Liquid Moondust (what a name 😂), shade: Zodiac!
just purchased a pair of Dear Frances boots... #annamademedoit
Happy belated birthday Anna! \nThank you for the recipes!!!! Amazing brownies!! The moment you showed them... I was like OMG I need to make this!
Happy belated birthday, Anna. Looks like you had a lovely day. You certainly seemed very cheerful and positive. I enjoyed the vlog!
happy b day! \np.s. you are so sexy with wet hair, have u ever considered trying to go darker or black?
Glad you had a lovely birthday Anna.
Ha ha ... Mark falling at the end was the best ..
24:50 is the best part
You should check out Jamie Lee from mademoiselle, she has a fashionbased blod and youtube \nand who I lately discoverd is Karenbritchick , she is amazing!! :)
Maybe Sumptuous Olive or Greensmoke from Mac is a good dupe? Great video! 👍 Happy Birthday!
a rather good egg \n\ni had quite the laugh reading your blog post today, happy birthday anna!
Happy birthday Anna! I really love how that eyeshadow colour suits you! Have you had a look at the Marc Jacobs Twinkle Pop stick eyeshadows? I saw a video yesterday and the color seems similar (they used Stardust which looks slightly more on the greyish side). I have yet to test it in real life, I will do as soon as I get to a Sephora. In the meantime, if you do test it, let me (well, everybody) know if it's any good. xx
Happy bday Anna. You are so sweet. And my present to you is Daria Androniescou's channel. She's the queen of wardrobe capsules that have loats of personality. You're welcome ;)
I hope you had lovley birthday Anna love your videos and their content. I get that warm feeling whem I get a notification of an upload 😊
Hey Anna! I'd say try MAC Sumptuous Olive or Greensmoke; they're both quite similar to the Charlotte Tilbury shade!
Happy Birthday! You're such a sweet person, I'm glad you had a fabulous birthday! Yes, we need to clone your husband!! What a super cute couple you two are!
This vlog made me so happy x
Happy Birthday week!! You are too cute! That homemade card though:) ❤️
Brilliant video Anna, I'm so glad you had such a lovely birthday.
Happy Belated Birthday! This was a very cute vlog. I told my husband I was hanging with my friend Anna 😜 a girl can dream.
You’re such a humble person to watch and listen to. Love your content.
Happy Birthday!🎈Love your channel and your new newsletter! You deserve all the happiness you can handle.
Are those earrings from & other stories?
HAPPY BIRTHDAY ANNA! Lol i had a dishwasher, but my mom was always so old fashioned so we still had to hand wash dishes! oh how i hated it!
Many happy returns Anna! Loved that eyeshadow on you! I look forward to the next year of great videos! 😃🎂🍾
Happy birthday Anna!!! Very entertaining video 👍🏾
Happy Birthday dear girl❣️💐🎂🍾🥂🎁 love that eyeshadow on you !!
It's my birthday today (woohoo 27!) and I loved watching this, as I love consuming any and all of your content (fangirl, much? yes. MUCH.) But I have to say the bit in this where you mimic your dad around the baby...so freaking cute, reminded me of my parents being around babies, I just had to leave a little love note. <3 <3

Ed + Frecks. <3 And the girl from White Chicks who is throwing up while that girl holds her hair.
this is My Kind Of Content
Twenty-nine people don't have fucking ears and just watched a video with no context. To them. Just them.\nThank you, Ed, Chris T, Chris B, and Daniel!
this is everything. i love lara and freckle!! so good
Amazing, I really Love this album and the videos 😍😍😍😍💙
best track of the record, looking forward to hearing it performed live :)
I love Aunt Freckle in this
Best song on the album and catchiest tune since Two Weeks. Good Job fellas!
Wow! Great song and video! Is the blonde girl as same as the girl from Yet Again's video?
I believe vídeos are so important and grizzly bear are great on it. This is fucking art!!
Emotive...\nI feel this music. Great album
Love love Busy Phillips, confused by vid but still ❤️
Who came here because of typing 'bear'?
Video compliments the song very VERY well! Also one of my favorites of the album. Can we get a Glass Hillside video?
How not to love their songs?
Ahhh, Freckle, my queen!
O. M. G. FRECKLE!
Dafuq did i just watched?

Conceited comment: I prefer the strange vague (almost genderless) sexuality of Knife and Ready, Able to the new music videos. I thought the gender themes on Mourning Sound and (to a lesser extent) on this video were a bit overt, and not particularly insightful. That being said, I did enjoy this video's visual twists, and I'm pretty happy that Grizzly Bear are still in the absurd music-video game.
First off please no one attack me because I am one of the biggest Grizzly Bear fans you could ever meet. \n....\nI don't understand these videos. They used to be psychedelic. I always considered grizzly bear to be psychedelic. Ready,Able is the coolest video I have ever watched whilst under the influences \n  This feels pushy. Don't get me wrong, I am absolutely in no way against anything gay. I'm starting to feel like this whole album is about accepting people for what they are. And I do! But damn I miss the Veckatimist feels.
Wait what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what  what what what what what what what
Are they all trans women ??? Yes beautiful yes
Such a Beatlesque sound
Why am I crying in the club right now
It sounds so much like a Father John Misty song that it could be a Father John Misty song
Couldn't understand a thing, it's freaking amazing!
Holy shit.
BUTT FUCKERS, FUCKING FOUL.......
Is this video related to the death of hugh hefner? Both are a symbol of redefining the role of women into society. It would be nice!
This album is a modern classic.
TFW you realise the singer in the clip is a guy 🤔
Farming is STILL in early access, ugh!
I don't mean to sound dumb or anything, but i really don't care what life on earth will look like in the next hundred years....i mean....I'll be dead.😕
The problem here is the farmers will only do what is cheaper they Will not spend extra money on these healthy ideas
We don't have enough space for this kind of low yield hippie farming. The proper solution is to actually get the 21st century rolling. This means hydrogen fusion + thorium fission for unlimited energy, hydroponic farming for crops and lab grown tissue for meat.
take me to the land institute plz! I want to apprentice there!
Ocean sediments, also verticle farming, and don't forget that salt to fresh water. Liberals look at a problem and think we must make it like nature.
There are two other options ..\nControl the population or explore new planets ..\nFirst option seems more easy than the later. ... so let the hunger/hunting game begin. .
western farming was always broken. many eastern and indigenous cultures have already mastered techniques. \ndoing it the best doesn't always mean doing it right. mass farming was a good move in the wrong direction.
What about hydroponics? Vertical farming? Using natural land to make food is fundamentally unsustainable, we need to increase efficiency, drastically reduce resource use and move it all to the cities. It shows a lack of imagination not to attempt to solve this technologically.
That's not how it works though - the matter doesn't go through any chemical change and therefore just gets moved around
Or, less humans.
Tem legenda Vietnamita
You forgot to mention the real solution - vertical farming...
why you stop making paper plane tutorial ? start them again
Since doing this would also take up way more space, and we would run out of land to feed our increasing population, the only way to solve this would be mass genocide 90% of all humans, leaving plenty of room to feed us :)
You Stupid woman, we are recycling the crops already. We make seed of the harvestet crop.
I love the pokemon references in almost  every video.
Could you please do a video on turtle oil collection for cosmetic issues and the risk it means to sea turtles. It is a very important thing that no one talks about and worries me and should worry everyone.
Aquaponics is kind of like this.
How the hell are you going to harvest something without taking out everything else beside it?
perennial corn doesn't exist and harvesting wheat with other plants will be a pain in the ass
The solution is to grow crops on different parts of the land and give the previous ones some time to replenish themselves.
That's why people in interstellar are starving and running out of food. K.
The future is not flying cars.\nIt's high tech farming.
Can you really say farming has always been broken when it has allowed the Earth's population to swell into the billions? Think we could have done that as hunter/gatherers? Perhaps it is people that are broken.
Just realized Alex, Henry, and Peter were siblings
shit like this will never work in china and india or africa, they are starved and poor as shit (most of the farmers are at least) the people who are involved with farming in poor and overpopulated areas simply will not care. they need money and socioeconomic status, they will do anything to get it
More likely we will move away from plant and animal farming altogether in the latter part of this century and start to manufacture all the plant and or animal proteins and nutrients we need directly via molecular manufacturing. I know enormous vats of artificial meat or plant matter sounds gross and dystopian, but climate change is going to start hitting agriculture really hard in a decade or so
I'm probably gonna get attacked saying this but, vegetarians stop being pussies and eat a steak, there just animals and they'll reproduce. If one cow dies another one will take its place.
There is a basic arithmetic issue that nobody will address because it hurts feelings. Perenial grains and such are cool and all but permaculture simply cannot sustain the current population, their is a basic limit to the rates of the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles. Resources are being depleted simply because the current population is not sustainable and we require maximum production per acre. The earth has about 5 billion people more than can be maintained at the current first world standard of living, we only get away with this level in the short term by using up our long term savings.\nOn top of that there are major process engineering issues around mixed crops. Hand labor is not compatible with improved living conditions. The ability to batch process provides a major means of controlling diseases and pests in a field. \nMaybe when it finally becomes acceptable to acknowledge that not all opinions are valid or deserving of respect society can make some progress. It will likely be a day late and a dollar short however. Simply put not all people should have the right to have kids, and being anti-birth control is logically equal to advocating for children to starve to death in a few generations. Now there are fools that think they will end resource scarcity via various methods, yet even at that fanciful extreme end(and ignoring the limit of light speed) it would only be 8000 years at the current pop growth rate before every particle in the current observable universe is part of a human body.
MinuteEarth i would love to know how you get your info
Never before? Okay, maybe not on a large scale like you said, but I can't be the only one whose elementary school taught them about Native farming techniques that replenished nutrients in the soil. The Three Sisters was a proven farming technique that Europeans destroyed when they came to America.
PERMACULTURE, guys, why aren't you talking about that? I don't get it.
Did you try restarting farm ?
farming is not broken it's the population sustainability.
Genius
Humanitys going to die. Im glad tho.
If we eat less meat we'll have to grow less soy/grain to feed farm animals. No-one wants to give up burgers though :(
Next 10,000 years !?  It would be a miracle to get another 1000.
While this is a legitimate concern and possible problem, I don't see that it's an urgent problem, as long as we let the market help us decide which farming and food production systems are more valuable and worthwhile to us.  \n\nI see some commenters saying big Agricultural businesses won't allow more sustainable processes to be used.  But this is why we need to allow the market to work and not let government intervention limit competition.  Ultimately, it's the consumers who decide what is most produced and with more competition, consumers have more say in the production process.  \n\nFor example, you don't like GMO crops?  Fine.  Let's label them, and then we'll see quantifiable evidence that tells us how much the public is actually concerned about GMO's, instead of listening to special interest groups making political statements. Who knows, the results might surprise me as well as you.
Wait, this doesn't feel right...\n\nOf course! It's MinuteEarth.\nI thought it was a MinutePhysics video.
And how about combine harvesters having to harvest 1 type of plant at a time when more plants are in the same square foot?
In a few hundred years, humanity will be dead from climate change, so who gives a shit about fucking farming. \nSo pig out motherfuckers and burn this fucking planet into the ground, fucking filthy bastards.
Omoshiroi
Farmers used to leave 1/3 of the farmland fallow so that it could replenish the nutrients. Perennials would just sap all of those nutrient! Genetic engineering isn't going to erase the average plant's need for essential nutrients and minerals.
We'd just have to slash and burn every remaining forest and replace them with our own balanced ecosystem to feed half the world
The problem is with human and not Earth or farming. South Asia and Africa will add 3 billion people by 2050
Your voice is putting me on edge
Harvesting would be made incredibly difficult, thus lowering yields and raising costs. Its nice to be idyllic but we need the money in order to achieve that. Another thing we need to worry about is that those lower yields would impact the poorest the most. In the end we would simply need more land, more effort, and higher costs for the same result. We just aren't forward thinking enough as a species to pull that off.
https://www.youtube.com/user/MinutoDaTerra  this channel translates your videos\nhelp them
Farms are not working out well in recent years because we stopped puting animal shit in them. And that breaks the cycle.
what about fogponics?\nThe idea is that you mist nutrient water into plant roots, which is way more efficient than hydroponics.
Easy, get a replicator, or just go down to Quarks.
That space will not be a good ecosystem. Let's farm stuff underground by pumping sucrose into genetically engineered plants  and use the above ground space for mostly nature and humans.
The invention of agriculture was a mistake.
none of this is true I live in the farming capital of america if youve eaten lettuce in america it came from Yuma az. farming is ahead of the game, this is all horse shit. Stupid propaganda,
Food forests 👍🏻\nFruit is the best thing to eat anyway ;)   Good fruit :)
Hi minute earth, this reminded me of a farming technique called aquaponics, which uses 95% less water than conventional farming. It would be really cool I'd you guys did a video on that
Earth is still on beta test so give Jesus some break.
The key to more efficient and environmentally-friendly farming is (and always has been) technology.\nThere is a misconception among non-farmers that 'organic' farming has less of an environmental impact, when the opposite is true. The ability to get amazing yields using less land, less equipment, and less diesel is why technology is so important to agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture.\nWhen people rally against safe and proven agricultural technology such as GMO's, they aren't just trying to make agriculture less efficient; they are inadvertently making it harder to feed the world and save the environment.

Hippy BS
Let's just become hunter-gatherers again
Jesse Agar from This Place was the guest artist!
why is moon white?why do cat say meow?why are we called humans?why am i asking stupid questions?\nok im done bye
Well, I'll finally achieve my weight loss goal :D .. And die
Hey, look at that, a millennial way of pushing GMO's. Profiteers broke farming.
I was hoping that this video was going to discuss aquaponics. I see a sustainable future there.
all of this has been tried and failed and many died of stavation. what a load of crap. all wishful thinking and no science.
Drug suppliers are pioneers of these techniques
If you do that mixing of natural habitats with plantations some species will begin to take advantage of the huge amount of protein and energy in the human crops and pesticides and other undesirable methods will have to be used. I think it is a stupid idea. The only possible approach to all these problems is to reduce the global human population to acceptable levels, especially in China, India and Africa.
To keep up to date with agriculture technology. I recommend this podcast, Talking Biotech.\nhttp://www.talkingbiotechpodcast.com/
How TF are we losing dirt?! If it blows away then wont it just fly into another field?
Ok but doesn't that make harvesting 100 times more difficult?
...Always has been? Historically, farming founded the entire history of mankind lol. Your suggestion that the whole (farming) world simply give up their trade and move on...is about as condescending as my suggesting you take a deep breath and consider the livelihood of billions of people across, erm, planet Earth. A (very well researched!) scientific approach to global issues is indeed brilliant but the way you point it out suggests a this is fact, therefore you change approach. Your ideas work in theory, just as farmers own realities work for them, in practicality. Try analysing wealth distribution - if you really want to rock the world :)
Bugs, im calling it right here, the answer is bugs. Eat lots and lots of bugs.
farming is broken because not enough modified plants are being grown?\n\nseriously?\n\nmy bullshit detector is going off....
I have been hearing about perennial grains for a long time. Where are they? What is stopping you? You can splice the DNA of anything into anything else. Do it! Stop procrastinating! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
We wouldn't have to farm so intensively if the grind to get to old age wasn't so bad. Have you seen how many calorxps you need to get to level/age 80?
Lazy farmers 500 years ago..: Lets delay this like ppl will do with Half-life !
For all the people mentioning hydroponics as a solution: It doesn't solve the problem that nutrients aren't being recycled.
This self sustaining system dose not exist on a large scale. Or world wide scale
Ok, so stop breeding in excess of two children per two adults
It's not easy to switch crops it will consume a lot of land and give a small harvest it will also attract more pest to the land so I don't think farmers will adopt it very quickly specially in India
So when we mow the grass, we harvest off wheat ears?  Makes sense to me.
Trump 2020.  Make America great again, again!
2:16 I want a fruit vac
uhh..ok
This is why veganism is bad.
Permaculture
Permaculture. Problem fixed.
go ahead, MinuteBollocks, recycle your resources - EAT SHIT!\n*eating this shit video doesnt count.
Have to fix the anti-gmo folks first.
minecraft already knew this
Go Vegan :-)
MOAR GENE EDITING
less babies = less mouths to feed = less agricultural degradation/deterioration
MAKE FARMING GREAT AGAIN
{#><€\|>==|=====|+====\n\n(:-)&>=|\|}|---------
America alone produces enough grain to feed 10 billion people, but most of it is fed to farm animals instead and nearly half of the remaining food is wasted in other ways. People are starving to death right now because you choose to eat meat, wasting all that grain
Dear Everyone, apologies for the volume of the music. You're right, it IS too loud. That's my bad! I hope you can cope and it doesn't put you off too much because I can't lower it without removing the video and losing all of your lovely comments. So I promise to not do it again next time if you promise to forgive me and watch this video anyway! Xxx

Malteases
Love the commes des garçon top
Can you please do a milk chocolate ganache recipe
Think I'm gonna go hungry even after lunch 😅
You should cover them in chocolate\nIt'll make them more solid and less wobbly when you hold them
i love it! do you run a store? you have so many candies behind you
Hey Jemma! Could you PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a Biscotten Torte? It's a great cake that tastes amazing
Where to store the marshmallows to rest for 24 hours ? In the refrigerator or room temperature
Please make cakes based on Indian theme,green tea & red wine please
Love your videos Gemma, u are the best
What type of powdered gelatin is used?
hard candy ribbons like the kind granny had in the glass jar around christmas time
Really pretty, but I don't really understand why you'd want to eat that.  Lol. :)
I just want to make regular marshmallows, can I skip the glucose since I'll melt them?
Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers! Maltesers!  :D I've made your marshmallows so many times (including for my sweetie table at me wedding) and they've always turned out great.
I like flumps but that’s a lot of work and I’m lazy😝 cya I’m off to Tesco
Why would you not just buy flumps? Sm better and cost like 5p
Yeah Gemma, the music is a distraction and a bit annoying.  When I watch your videos I want to relax. Your choice of music on this one is a bit fast, perhaps more appropriate for a work out. Love you anyway xx
which company do you get your sprinkles from in the background? or could you recommend somewhere please! thank you :) and loved the video
Jemma you're the best!! These are absolutely adorable <3
if you don't have friends lmao
Where i come from we call them wiggles, aaaannd they’re covered in chocolate!
That marshmallow u ate was so from today or the batch u just made.
I remember twisted coloured marshmallows but never called them flumps...then again I’m from Australia so probz different name
Not as easy as it looks
Hey jemma! I really loooove your videos , I'd like  to know wich Brand are your spatulas and bowls? Please let me know 😊....
This must be a British thing, haha
I loved dots when I was a child. Colorful and so much fun to tear off the paper and eat
that background music is too loud
Loved the vid but the music too loud over your voice.
If your going to learn one candy recipe this is the one to learn. So nice and yummy. Nice video, Love all your videos
And where do I store them, in a paper bag or a plastic one?
@CupcakeJemma I use to have nougat with jube pieces in it. Maybe you can make that for one of your episodes. 😊😊
Cupcake jemma a very very important qns \nIs it possible to over whip butter? And make it spoil or something by making too pale?
Your phone case so pretty 😍
What's your star sign
i love it so much
Can you swap the gelatine for vege - gel?
we call these spekkies in my country!
Love it so much😱❤\nPlease you can do video on mirror cake?
you are so quick bae
I absolutely love your videos. You give me such inspiration for me to get in the kitchen and make some of your recipes. Thank You so much.😀💜
These look so delicious except I can't find powered gelatin anywhere!!! Pls help!
I missed Cadburys Spiral bars. Made great straws to drink chocolate milk with
I use to eat those when I was 2 years old and I don't see them any more and they taste so good they are awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to see what you're going to do for halloween this year!
Highkey can't wait for all the halloween masterpieces this year😭😭😭😍
I love how the entire table ends up pure white from the icing sugar/corn flour mixture. That's definitely a liberal application! (And makes complete sense, marshmallows just get so sticky.)\n\nAlso, yes, we should all take tea breaks while baking!
In the netherlands that’s called “spekjes “
Sick video can you do a recipe on a classic millionare shortbread thingy😂... Please\nAlso are they worth all the effort
you hsould do a video on popular childhood sweets- maybe fruit winders? i know they could be quite simple but i am really interested to find out
HI JEMMA❤❤ I love your videos so so much!! Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽✨🎉 btw can you make some macarons please!😄😍😘
Any one else notice how perfect and equal Jemmas were compared to the other girls (5:19) lol you can tell she's a master!!!
Looks so difficult but fun to do lol \nThanks for your video
Will it work the same with vegan gelatine? X
The music is really off-putting :(
Hi jemma. I tried this reciepe and the smell and taste of gelatin was really overpowering.. it smelt plastic-y and was just strong.  i added heaps of vanilla but that didnt help. Any tips to change that?
Please make something eggless!!
Yeah cos we've all got a 6ft long work counter..
My gran used to make pralines they were so rich and creamy! She would make vanilla ice cream also, every summer 💕
Is that merchandise jemma?!?
Great recipe but the background music was a terrible idea
I have always loved flumps but this is a hard recipe for my hands (I have rheumatoid arthritis) maybe I could find someone to give these a try for me. I had some shop bought ones not too long ago and they were nasty I couldn't eat them they weren't proper flumps.
Where did you get your cell skin?
Ok, first there was the kitchen towel (mega cool) and now the cell phone case 😍 !!! Looks like Johnny cupcakes designed it (correct?). Was this designed specially for you, or is it available in his shops? Love your videos :) all the best from Germany
Or just go to Tesco's and buy one for 10p
She swallows quick...... I like her.
Our hearts go out to Mexico right now. We have some great friends in Mexico and absolutely love it there and with all of the Earthquakes we truly hope that everyone is safe and banding together. Please consider finding a place to donate or send supplies to as I know that together we can all help.
I can see why you married her she's like the female version of you great chemistry
The construction of your pile of nachos was euphoric to watch
I like your recipies, i´d love to try the vegan nacho cheese, on the other hand, i would like you to know some things becuase those are not mexican dishes, those are TEXMEX. We dont use yellow cheese, we dont even eat nachos (as a mexican dish), for us nachos are an American thing, adding beans is also a Mexican stereotype. Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalapeño, but thats ok. \n\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\n\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \n\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it.
I am not vegan, but I eat a lot of Vegan food, and those Nachos were the truth. Would eat those without worrying about meat any day.
Absolutely love that you guys are making more plant-based dishes on Brothers Green! The vegans and animals are thanking you both 😄
Best. Compilation. Video. EVER. 😍
Looks great my brother 👍 me as a Mexican that looks amazing
Where do you buy your squeeze bottles? This was fantastic!
I fucks wit it
Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\n\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods.
This is so awesome that you released this today!!! Im releasing my Brothers Green BGBQ vegetarian tacos video today!! YES!!
I have a question for Vegans who choose to be so because of their love for animals. Do you hate plants that much that you would rather eat them over animals?
Plz do Vietnamese Mexican video. I need these tastes in my life
Why do you put gluten free and vegan together?\nIt's not by choice that we don't eat gluten, we're just super sick when we do.
Red Bell Pepper in Guac is a =Mexican Food cardinal sin.
Jackie seems like so much fun!! I'm not vegan but I want to try some of these recipes! They remind me of the recipes on Hot For Food's channel
VEGAN REVOLUTION
nice vid. thanks for all the insight and tips. oh, somebody prolly already mentioned this but just in case not... the letter j is pronounced like an h in spanish (like the name José). so the name of the mexican restaurant, Jajaja, is pronounced Hahaha! having said all that (a mouthful), i really don't think authentic mexican fare is all that meat centric. like all traditional cuisines, it should be pretty easy to veganize. (btw, just happened to see this: https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/best-vegan-mexican-restaurant-in-nyc.)
Thank you so much for posting this video! I have just begun my transition to vegan eating, primarily for health and ecological reasons, so this is perfectly timed for me. I also appreciate that you're mostly using ingredients I can find near me--I live in a very rural area, with a single grocery store in town. If I want more exotic ingredients, I have to drive about 30-45 mins. To give you and idea of how limited our selections can be, we just started having avacados here as a regular item maybe a year ago. :/ I have never seen jackfruit in person, but I will make an effort to check for it the next time I do an out-of-town grocery run. If that fails, there is always The Interwebs. :) Thanks again, and congrats on the new channel!
you know what would be good on those nachos.......STEAK!! lol jk love the videos bro!
Looked amazing!!! Yum
Fuggggggg. YES!
She's awesome
Nachos aren't Mexican god damn it
an amazing wife = an amazing life
YESSSSSSSS
😮😋
Yaaaay vegan stuff !! Big up for that ! <3
Damn, thanks!
Yay! More vegan videos ❤️🌹
Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!
Josh is going SUPER SAYAN!!!
Totally awesome video guys! Thank you for making a vegan video! Rock on
Hope you're enjoying marriagehood!! I adore you guys!\nI'm excited to use my face to press some homemade tortillas tonight! Lol!
I have had a can of jack fruit for a year, but none of the bbq recipes look good to me.  This one you did looks amazing, it's got the look of what I love.  Thanks!! I subscribed to your new channel nut you are not on my feed, weird.
More vegan videos! Great content <3
This channel is starting to tap into the vegan hell on youtube. It's been an hour and I already see comments lecturing people on why eating meat is morally wrong and that you should be ashamed. Next we will have vegan gains community coming over.
I love it when youtubers bring their partners on!!
Love ur cooking
Love you guys (:
great vlog
Very nice
How about showing some recipes that use garlic confit?\n\nI could take it or leave it with the vegan thing, but I'm sure you can come up with a lot of stuff that uses a great (vegan) source of savory flavor in a creamy package.
where I live, Nacho chips are way cheaper than make your own with tortillas
The Perfect Complement...so delicious...I would love to see an ingredient list? I don't know what I have on hand and what I would need? can I gather it all in 1 week? I think first and foremost I will try NACHOS! Gonna be S.O. G.O.O.D! Great Ideas!!! ; )
My father taught me about Hanuman when I was a small child, Namaste to the two of you.
Your wife is really cool, you guys are great together on camera :)
It's funny to hear people say jajaja with the J when it's hahaha in Spanish lol idk I think it's cute I went there with my boyfriend(I'm vegan he isn't) he and I loved it so much I love mexcain food. The machos were the best.
i would love to know how you make eating work in the home, is there twi meals going around, or do you just eat vegan at home? epic recipe!
can't believe how big your channel has grown!!
Not vegan, but am excited to try the crema and the chips!
Amazing! THANK you for posting this! :) Looks absolutely amazing!
Why does that Jackfruit look like shredded chicken though!!!
Crazy how the cheese sauce still manages to get that bright yellow queso colour
Wtf is wrong with your hair cut?
My kind of video! I am always making Indian and Asian foods. Been needing to open up my arsenal
I love that you reach out to vegan audience with this kind of videos. this shows how much the channel has grown and yeah if you always stick to the same thing it will be boring, right? also I don't have access to daiya here so please make a video on how to make vegan cheese!
I don't know man, I love Juanita chips.
The Mexican corn is actually  put into the grill with the leaves. When the leaves burn turn black you remove them. When you peel them they will be July and a tiny bit burned. Lmk if you try it this way
I also really like your wife, she's just like you it's awesome, love the video too might try a few
You two compliment each other in the most lovely way. Great Friday video!
It’s so sad that corn tortillas are so expensive around here
PARMESAN CHEESE DOES NOT GO ON A STREET CORN
As someone with renal problem, this recipes are very helpful. Subscribed to your new channel.
very interesting and unique ideas ! thank you :)
why would anyone eat gluten free if you dont have to? I mean vegan or vegeterian does makes sense but gluten free?
Wait... if he's gay, what's with the wife? Lol
she is the female version of him. its amazing to watch them 👀
can you put the ingredients in the comments please?
If there ain’t meat it ain’t Mexican
They're plenty of authentic mexican dishes that happen to be vegan also- Check it out.
Thank you so much for including more recipes. I remember when you guys asked me on Twitter if I'd like to see more WFPB or Vegan recipes, this was back when I first transitioned into the Vegan lifestyle. September 2016 I made the switch. Everything has been amazing. Thank you for still providing many amazing recipes. Have a lovely weekend!
great video!!!  ( as always)
LOVE YOU MAN LIKE IF U DO TO!!
Everything looks so fresh and delicious, you guys did a great job! I can't wait to try all of these recipes this weekend :)
This video is amazing, really inspired me to give some effort to make a dinner like this some point in the future when the moment arrives. Love it!
Married ?
Love it guys!
When I see Jackfruit in the grocery store I'm intimidated by the size of it. I'm single/live by myself, so I don't usually buy stuff like that unless I really like it and will eat it right away or can preserve it by freezing it. Can someone make the Jackfruit meat in this video and store (by freezing) for later use? I saw another video on the munchies YouTube channel where a guy made a BBQ vegan sandwich out of smoked trumpet or king oyster mushrooms. I'm highly intrigued by it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWMIpdhlVZY&t=75s
Ugh a video with this woman again! Her constant hand talking and awful use of words, cringe of the worst kind! Where is the other brother 🤷🏽‍♀️
I don't know what others think, but seeing the cook actually eating and reacting to what they have prepared is 50% of what I wait for. That tells and sells it all for me! Thanks for another great video, but please, no more censoring the eating! :)
I live for your slo-mo shots!
dude YES
Thanks for checking out this video! You can click here to check out our new channel, all plant based recipes that give you all that glorious taste, minus the meat.
I'm mexican and I aprove 100%, I love it when people from other countries try to recreate our food. It was also very nice to see you make your own corn tortillas, keep it going guys👍
how long do you think it is safe to keep the cashew sauce in the fridge ? if I make it I will not eat it all in once I think
This is a crime against mexican gastronomy
Thank you for this! Jackie is awesome sauce and I can't wait to make some of this.
Fantastic! Thank you
I really do not like Vegan food and straight plant based recipes but, I respect other people's choices! Rad video, as per uge! You guys are awesome together. 😊
Absolutely love this video! Just wanted to add in that Diaya while it is vegan they just switched over and sold out to a company that tests on animals! Just wanted to let you guys know because I know it bothered me when I found out, I didn't know if Jackie is aware of this! But there's so many other vegan cheeses which are even better than Diaya in my opinion like Follow Your Heart and Chao!
How long does the vegan cheese and sour cream last in the fridge? Can I freeze either? Would love to make in large batches so I can save time/money
Making my MMA debut next Saturday. My dream is to become world champion. Follow my journey much love
OMG that all looks amazing. Especially the Jackfruit tacos. I am extremely allergic to poultry, eggs, feathers.....the whole nine yards. we are fortunate to live on a farm, so mainly everything comes straight from the Animal or the ground here (with a few exceptions, lol). My husband says we do not do vegan but I so could. I am going to try to trick him with this. Yumm
Hey where do you guys get permission to use those songs from sound cloud? I'm really tired of the YouTube royalty free tunes. Thanks!
What happened with meat
Wow.. Ruining food 101....
I remember the times when the food recipes included some meat. Nothing against vegans, but I didn't think this channel would turn towards vegan foods as often as it does.
Mates if science and world history has taught me anything is that just because you can doesn't mean you should. Do not mess with perfection, y'all went too far with this one.
I love cooking for friends and fam. But not when I’m by myself... Please do a video (or two) about recipes for one. Not too many ingredients and leftover food would be great too! #happysingle :)
Man, I was right there with you guys until you went to #PruneTown. 😂😂😂
I seriously think that Ben's idea of quick and easy means you don't have to grind your own wheat for the flour.
Who the hell thinks destoning apricots is difficult? 😅
OK, random challenge idea. The normal people cook and the chefs judge, but the chef's do not know what the secret ingredient/inspiration is.  This way the normies have to come up with (probably with viewer help) an inspired recipe that they make and the chefs have to figure out what the inspiration was based off the dishes. A  challenge all around.
I love the look on Jamie's face when he gets to do the This is our........sorted!. That's the joy of cooking right there.
Jaimie did the thing Jaimie did the thing!!
I knew it. I knew no matter what, Ben wouldn't have given a 10/10. That look on his face though, was priceless.
Now that's brilliant!
This looks really good! I'm going to make it next week, and might add some barley in there somewhere. :)
WHERE IS hello, and welcome to fridgecam...?!
6:13 Is it really a technical word or did ben just make that up 😂😂😂😂
Ben is like the professor I had last semester. You do everything perfectly to the standard they requested, and yet ... A-
**englishly and sadly** you could miss out on double cream altogether
A lot of fucking effort for an effortless meal.
I'm so proud
Jamie - did you find out why you lost 0.5 marks?
Made this tonight with some alterations and it was a huge hit with the boyfriend. Subbed green beans for the spinach (not a fan) and normal white beans for the butterbeans. Took the 'pear' suggestion from Ben to sub the apricots as well, that was great :)
Dear sorted food gents, what is the best recipes for a person who is sick?
HAHAHAHA Did anyone else rewind the beginning with Ben waving behind Jamie because I did a lot.. totally worth it!
I wish Ben wouldn't appear in every video. He's getting annoying.
Please do more like this and do slow cooker stuff too!
You're cheffin' all over the place! *literary 15 seconds later*  you can see how it all just 'mleau' (pronunciation?? XD) back, technical word for wilted xD yeah Ben, you do you xD
Hey guys x love the recipe but do pork medallions cost a lot? I recently started university, could you do some cheap, quick and easy meals for students? One problem I find when cooking is the portion size x I always make too much for one meal! Could you guys help? Love the vids =) Thank you!
I think I'm likely not alone in this: but I love you guys. For real!! Glad to be part of the Kickstarter campaign xo
You don’t need to eat meat it’s ruining the environment and our bodies
Always looking for midweek meals. Midweek is when I work late so these are always appreciated
More of this! Loving it :)
Leviticus 11:7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.\n\n8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they are unclean to you.\n\n9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.\n\n10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you:\n\n11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.\n\n12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
I just got an idea. What if you make a battle in which James and Ben ‘supervise’ the boys where they cook a somewhat complicated meal? You can make pairings like James & Barry and Ben & Jamie or whatever. That’ll be fun to watch!
Lol I've been vegetarian my whole life but surely pig and fruit don't go well together? 😂😂😂
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
look like to much work. Delivery much easier 😃
Hahhaha is the last line + Sorted the chef's right? :P good work boys
Jamie is cute. 😀 he's my fave
4:36 Thank you, Ben. I now know the easiest way to get stoned.
Do more of these!
still can't get behind the whole 'meat+fruit' thing.
I'm allergic to a lot of fruits, many which are stone fruits. What other alternatives could I use? (Apples and pears are not an options either!)
He didn't salt/pepper both sides I think D:
You guys should make poulet-frites. Basically rotisserie chicken with a bed of potato/fries underneath to catch the fat drippings and other deliciousness from the chicken
Don't worry Ben, I can give you the other half an inch.\n\n*sorry, it was sitting out there*
what would be a good substitute for prunes?
Can not believe the amount of 'je ne sais quoi' you shoved in there...
guys if you want to eat healthy and save money delete Food app from your phone
Could we do a student meal week please? like quick and easy meals for one that are also healthy-ish and cheap? :)
Do a segment of different kinds if food from ancient times please!!!
This is great, definitely going to try this out. Would love to see more!
This was great. Can we have more like this? I don't like sweets very much and I feel like there's been sooooo many desserts on this channel lately haha.
Are prunes needed to Chef all over the place?
They are so attractive!!! Single?
How is Jamie still so useless 😂
Make a series called mid-week meals! Seriously need more of such recipes for my own mid-week meals
I still watch most of the videos on this channel, even though I am a very picky eater and find a good 85% of the recipes disgusting. The boys are so entertaining, and even if I don't like a recipe (eg, fruit paired with meat.. NOPE!), I still get ideas from recipes and incorporate them into my own cooking. <3 you guys!
Ben was on fire today!
Amazing, thanks! But can get a super fight with a lot of beautiful men, please. Like have Tom Daley again and his hubby Lance Black and form two teams, like for Halloween!!!!? Because that will be Epic!!!! Please!!!!
need more of these types of vids :D\nnice and easy meals but still gorgeous
I love recipes like this! Is it possible to see some more autumnal recipes that can be slow-cooked? I work most of the day, so I'd love to come home and have something ready and waiting for me!
The missing half a point for full marks was obviously a sprig of mint
Dämn that music, anyone know what the tracks are on this one? <3
Watching these kind of videos remind me what a good teacher Ben is. If I was in his place I'd get frustrated and do everything myself haha
Haha The zooming in on the food reminds me of Gordon Ramsey!!\n\n\n\n\nWHERE'S THE LAMB SAAAAAAUAUUAUUAUACE
So easy thumb in the middle Stoned.. Yeahhhhhhhhhhh
This reminded me I've got lamb cutlets in the freezer, excellent.\nWell done Jamie.
3:55 Jamie had the tongs in his left hand but he still used his other hand to put the pork into the pan...\n\n\nI love it XD!
Is anyone going to tell Ben that apples don’t have stones?
You guys should do more mid week meals, love this!
Love the one pan recipes! I'm gonna try this one next week
He looked so happy to be able to say the 'sorted' line, awww! <3 lmao
dried apricots have a different flavor to fresh ones though . . .
Jamie lost some weight, looking good bro 😎👌
More of these, please!! 😘
This is so encouraging to see and holy heck it looks delicious!
James looks so proud at the end 😂😂
More videos like this!! Please:D This looks sooooo good and easy <3
Thanks for the recipe, very interesting you guys!
I'm a vegetarian why am I watching this?
Jamie should have put a sprig of mint on it to get a 10/10
TREAT YO SELF!
Whoa, that looks and sounds amazing!
Amazing!!!
he said simplicity...
That's pork loin not fillet!
That looks AMAZING!
wher frome you hawe guys that big pork filet or that was pork loin
Porking? Was that a Freudian slip, Ben? Lol!
Stoned! 😍
Reminds me of medieval cuisine!
Bens vocabulary: Amazing, hot, gentle, succulent, British
More one pot recipes
Do you guys do any vegetarian meals?
Could I substitute the pork with those big mushrooms and chicken stock with veggie stock to make it vegan?
I just bought a slow cooker - can you do a week of slow cooker meals please guys? Thanks so much!! :D
Running out of inspiration ...??? I don't understand what you're saying. You make thousands of meals in your lifetime. Why would it being the middle of the week make any kind of difference to anything??? I don't understand. ???
Why is it chicken stock is always paired with pork when we normally use matching meat/stocks (ie chicken with chicken stock, beef with beef stock). Is pork stock just not a thing?
Never thought of apricot with pork but it sounds delicious. Too bad it's 11:30pm where I'm at, watching, or I'd cook this right away. I'm not sure my family would appreciate my midnight cooking 😂
Why are there bits of dead animal in your dish 😕?
Unfortunately I can't eat pork (religious reasons). Is there a protein I can substitute in for this meal? I really like the flavors used in here. Beans and fruits etc.
How do you get the smell of garlic out of ur hands
I was having a mild panic attack when I thought they were not going to add back the accumulated juices form them resting pork.
mmm I was drawn by the title. Thought it'd be a fashion video but it is more about makeup. Anyhow your outfit is cute!
What didn't you put an AD disclaimer in the title? You're required to do that.
If you were on a TV commercial literally doing the same video I doubt anyone would hate on it. Honestly what's the difference between that and this? Silly folks. Cool video, loved the outfits. Tried to recreate the grungy eye...total YouTube fail for me, (I'm a Pinterest fail professional) but I'll keep trying. :) Cheers from Detroit.
Lily I love you. Your videos and content are so real and genuine and I really enjoy watching them. I hope you're feeling a little better but hey, its okay not to be okay. \nLots of love!
I love that mascara, it’s a tubing one, and is better than the blinc one.
Oh, that's a good trick how to do soft waves, Lily! Thank you! I plan to try it soon.
Oh wow, so interesting that doing mascara relaxes you; I find it anything BUT relaxing, lol! I find it stressful cos of my OCD maybe, so I try to get it as perfect as possible and i always end up getting some on my eyelid. Hence, I hardly wear mascara haha. Loved the entire look, Lily! XxxX.
I love your video. I seem real And reproductive to me. Kiss from France Lily 😍
Gorgeous look! I love fall!!!
The eye makeup on you looks gorgeous!!!! I am so ready for fall as well!! My favorite season!!!
I loved your outfit! I absolutely love Weekday atm so many great bits plus it’s sold on ASOS 🙌🏻
Really nice outfit and you suit the skirt!
Love the outfit!!
Your legs look amazing in those boots!! Xx
You look happier lily, hope you are well!
You forgot to use the green on your waterline while doing the second eye 🙈 loved the look anyway 😊
Outfit on point !
Loved the eye look 🌹 Your outfit was great too 👌
Thanks for a great beauty vlog Lily - so many bloggers have moved to fashion and forgotten the importance of beauty tutorials and reviews x
Your hair looks amazing at the moment, would love to know if you have changed your routine/products. 😍
Love everything about this look! And I also always forget how much I love wearing green eyeliner. Can't wait to pick one up again.
I really loved this video! It would be so interesting for curly and frizzy hair girls like me to see a hair routine of yours...what products you use, how you straighten your hair, how you manage it, etc. That would be just brilliant.
love this whole look!!! your hair always looks amaze & I want to try that mascara!!!
I love how we could tell you are actually excited about everything you showed in this video, you were smiling so much specially in the outfit part :) btw your nails are so cool!
Love the outfit! I've been looking to get a similar skirt!
Such a wonderful video!  Love the makeup, outfit and hair :):)
You look stunning 💕 love you with this hair length, perhaps even more so with it even longer! 💇🏻
Wish there was a far away view of the whole outfit!
Lily I just love your base, it's flawless....how did you do it? You've probably spoken about it a lot of times but I just watch all your vids and Except for the NY get ready with Anna I haven't seen a make up tutorial in a while! so I was wondering if you can tell us what you've used (foundation, concealer....) you looked gorgeous btw, I love the grungy look 😊
I love everything about this.  I totally forgot all about green eyeliner, it's the only eyeliner I actually feel good in as black can be a bit harsh on me.  Your hair is so lovely, I really wish I could pull off the middle parting as good as you do, and the outfit is very different for you.  I feel like we have a similiar sense of style so I am going to have to check out that mint jumper.  Really great video Lily,  really enjoyed watching. Hope you are keeping well :)
I really enjoyed this video!! The make up look was a bit different but without being too wacky and anyone could wear it x
I loved the outfit! the mascara looks great too. xx
You're twisting it towards your face 🙈😂
I loved your make up and the skirt! I'm not sure about the jumper though! I really liked its colour, but I think a more fitted jumper would look better!
I love the outfit Lily. Also, you've inspired me to try to do a version of this eye look. Thanks!
I loved the outfit! Definitely recreating 😍😍
Loved the eye look!
which color is your nailpolish???
I looooved the outfit! Especially the boots. So chic and a little sexy 👌🏼
I think You look Amazing in that look😍👌🏼💖💖💖👋🏼
Great video Lily! I loved the makeup+hair+outfit combo. Just missed an outdoors shot of you modeling the outfit, I think that would have tied up the video nicely.
loving the autumn look Lily x
That brown eyeshadow work perfectly with your roots! This is perfect!
You look amazing in the autumnal colours....and you have great legs. Loving the green eyeliner, too x
Amazing outfit and I really love your hair colour right now 🙌🏻💕
Love this look Lily ! It looks great on you
Wow, I love this look and the make up is 👌🏻 I read alotttt of YouTube comments and I swear people are TOUGH on you. I loved this video and whatever if it's an ad. It didn't feel like product placement...plus it's your job. Keep producing great, approachable looks. Your videos have been stellar lately 👍🏻
That skirt is gorgeous 😍
The smoked out green feline flick was such a nice idea 😍
Outfit is the bomb! A little  bit sexy at the same time.I love it.xxx
Love this look!
love the outfit very much!!! love from Belgium
Your hair is so beautiful 😍 love the outfit
Loved this video Lily! Definitely think I'll be trying green eyeliner now x
This outfit is amazing! I love how unique the colours and materials were and how it doesn't look like every other autumn outfit on social media. Can't wait to try that eye look too! Amazing video xx
Love the outfit, you look fab!
As you started to put on green eyeliner I was worried it won't look good, but girl, it looks amazing!
I love the outfit! You've really become one of the people I look to for style inspiration :)
Such a lovely video ❤ and Lily you ROCK this look👌
I Ike how you added the green! Such a nice touch and your autumn outfit look was so cute!:)
Great video!
LOVE that jumper!!!
i loooved the outfit!
Love this look!!!
You look beautiful!!!!
Love the green eyeliner, it really is so beautiful on brown eyes! Ah I almost forgot about the Matte Balms, I used to be so obsessed with them!
You are awesome 😍. Lots of love from Mexico 🇲🇽❤️
Really loving your hair Lily, it looks great. Also that skirt 😍
Love this outfit, you look really pretty on skirts and dresses. \n\nLove your videos! ❤
I loved this lily!! such a great video idea and love your style so much! :) also: I hope you are feeling a bit better! <3
I actually loved the makeup look, it suited you so well! Will definitely try on myself even though where I live it's spring time now.
I looove this makeup look on you. The green liner looks amazing.
Love love love this on you❤️
I loved this video! :) the outfit looks so nice on you..very flattering :) Can't wait for the autumn weather to get here ...\nI really enjoy your videos more and more lately ... especially your vlogs 😊💕
from watching this i've decided that I need that eye look in my life, also your hair looks SOOO nice!! just loved this video!!
You look beautiful! Wear more skirts and boots! Very nice Lily!!
The outfit is aces!! I’m inspired by it x
Omg this outfit is amazing!!! Definitely feel inspired!!!! 😍😍 the eye look is gorgeous as well - nice to see an autumnal look that isn't red and orange 💕
Great video Lily, love the way you did your makeup, hair and styling. The whole video was put together amazing 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😀
Really need to get my hands on a green liner, there’s a sentence I never thought I’d say. Well write anyway lol. Loving your whole outfit Lily x
i really like the green eyeliner, you look very sexy!
Really liked the outfit on you!!
Love all of this! I'm going to try that mascara, I love a tubing mascara.
I LOVE this outfit! That skirt is so cute, my friend was wearing a very similar one today and she looked stunning
love the boots and your make up is perfect Lily!
great video, Lily...love the fall styles! Can you start posting dupes to all of your purchases though? Not all of us can afford $400+ skirts and blouses.... :(
ooooh I LOOOVE the outfit it's different for you but so nice! Love it love it love it
Hi Lily, loved the format of this video and your outfit though different for you still reflected your own personal style. I remember watching the vlog when you were on your boot hunt last year and they look lovely on you! ❤️
You're making me want over the knee boots! I keep trying to convince myself I don't need any.
Your look is so simple but also very sophisticated. Big like for this new autumn combination in your wardrobe and in your makeup👌💗💗💗
Wth! You look like Rebecca from Eastenders but with a different voice
Those boots!!!!  Love them!
Love this look xx
Another inspiring video! TFS!
Wow! You look fabulous!
That green liner!! love love love
Your make-up looks lovely! Xxxx
The green eyeliner looks so good on you! Love your autumn style ❤️🍂
Youtube has become very unoriginal these days. Everyone looks the same and wears the same trend- or statement pieces. The Gucci belt, the Gucci Bag, the same cashmere knits...I mean, I like your video, but it won't inspire me. Sorry, I am not trying to be mean, I love youtube and watching you and others doing what you do. But its become so predictable. Autumn Makeup, GRWM, Ads, Fall Faves, WIMB ...
Liked the makeup but only three mins of the video is about style? Maybe change the title x

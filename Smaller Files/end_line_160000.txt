Paulinho 🐂🐂🐂🐂💪💪💪💪
Paulinho body balance =  99
la mejor liga del mundo JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA.......... la liga más dispareja del mundo diría yo
No se porque pero este nuevo  AS ROMA no me gusta!
Cabrones enseñen el penalti a Suarez que no pitó el arbitro
Dios mío!!!!! El estadio del Getafe lleno!!!!! The end is near!!!! Pedid un deseo!!!!!!
2:24 fuera de juego no pitado que no cuesta un gol por muy poco. Pero no pasa nada que es contra el Barça, así que 0 repeticiones, ni se comentó. Todo OK
Está para gol del año el del año el de getafe
sigo pensando que paulinho no vale eso :/
Cual es el nombre de los narradores
Pauliño marco, porque al defensor de Getafe le falta experiencia. Prácticamente lo dejo avanzar. Aunque le voy al Barcelona, reconozco las cosas como son. JUGARON MAL, El equipo no se acopla.  Este año no hay liga, ni copa, ni nada para el Barcelona. Este año solo Fichajes POPULISTAS, pero NINGÚN planteamiento serio. Jugadores MALOS. Mas de expectativas que de resultados!  Los buenos jugadores demuestran quien son, estén donde estén. Y ese grupito para mi no tiene nada especial de nada.
Pigue nie bzyknął Shakiry przed meczem bo to jaki ten chłop gra ostatnio piach to masakra:/ Potrzebny stoper od zaraz
My dumbass thought Barca were Roma
Paulinho gemius🏆🏆🏆

Terza giornata!??? 😂😂
#ForzaInter
Forza inter
Ci stava il pareggio , l'Inter non meritava di vincere , il Crotone ha fatto una grande partita e secondo me ci salveremo 🔴🔵🔴🔵🦈🦈
The home side fought very well
Nice Hat-trick! Handanovic
Brasile vs Sfinter... che culo immondo 😂
forza AZZURRI
A shaky win
LIGA SERIE A TIM,presenta nola seriea tim
Il Crotone ha solo un buon portiere. L'Inter ha forse il migliore portiere del mondo (è tra i pochissimi in lizza per esserlo). Forse a portieri invertiti il risultato sarebbe stato diverso.
Ecco guardate bene questa prestazione che una partita così il Crotone non la fa più
That line-up might be full of talent, but the midfield is way too offensive, it looks like a team Zeman might field. They'd get relegated immediately, especially in considering how tactical Serie A is, but they'd be a lot of fun to watch.\nAlso, can Kjear and Glik play in a three-man defence? RCB and LCB are not the same as a regular CB.
Ma che partita ha fatto Crotone? Non merita la sua posizione nella classifica, ne del Benevento
Inter caralho
Solito ci lo inter
Ci stava un botto il pareggio 2-2/ 1-1
Solita Inter fortunata
Solita inter ladrona
que onda con ese cesped? jaja
Just an English comment in the middle of nowhere
What´s wrong with the penalty point here? In slow motion you see that Gutierrez left foot suddenly sinks into the ground when he´s approaching the ball. No wonder that he hits the lawn with his right foot as well. It was not Gutierrez´ fault.
jajjajjajajaja, ese tronco hp estava pensando en la burra q se iba a chancletiar despues del partido....jajjajajajajajaj\nmalo hdpta
as I can see in the slow motion at 0:24:\nhis standing foot sinks way below the grass surface (never saw anything like this before)\nMaybe the grass was at this place very soft and deep. Or there was already a hole.\nThe result:\nAnd so (sinking) does his shooting leg, so he totally touched the ground and the ball headed towards... \n\nI would say: not his fault, but nonetheless very funny :)
Colombiano Sobrevalorado....
11 Meter vorbei hahahaha
They have bunkers in Football now?
Apoya el pie y se levanta la pelota. Un asco la cancha.
Jajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
HAHA
kick it like Beckham
Random Scottish comment kicking in now ........ #bawbag
Y todos los mexichangos diciendo que el cruz azul tiene que ver en esto. XD
jajajaja y en mexico con cruz a zul ya lo hacia hasta idolo jajaja bueno ahi hasta el mas pendejo es idolo
humofilo gutierrez
ese cesped está vivo
Jajaja negro narco
Loony toons?
Jajaja negroo putoo
Arreglen ese pasto jaja que culiado
Que muerto q sos teo
😂😂😂
Jajajaja pero q idiota
Troncofilo
Para terminar jugando en Junior que se hubiera quedado con lo que le pagaban y que se quede en River ganando títulos justo que necesitamos buenos delanteros
que perro
Mejor jugador de América 2014 🤔
Esa es la calidad que dicen que tiene este hijueputa?, y así lo siguen llamando a la seleccion porque es el moso de Pekerman.
jajajaja jajajaja jajajaja
Cual es la sorpresa? \nLa cancha es espantosa y a eso sumale un jugador mas sobrevalorado que balotelli y robinho juntos \nMuchos hablan de teo como si fuera la reencarnación de Riquelme y no llega ni al nivel de fabro un jugador del monton
Buena vitrina el river jajaja donde término este pelmazo... Xd
lo que las canchas callan
Si no pasaba nada con el cesped y era responsabilidad suya iba ser ridiculez!! Pero al hacer el movimiento para patear, el pie de apoyo (izquierdo) se hunde practicamente hasta el tobillo levantando toda la tierra que esta alrededor de la pelota!!
Jajaja no mames we No mames hijo de tu puta nadre!!! El wey se mamo alv jajajaja, +10 por el buen momazo! Sigue asi rufian! Zopotamadre se mamo el wey
le hizo daño jugar en el Cruz Azul jaja
Pobre Teo,lo cago el césped
Jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
Q cancha de mierda, es raro como se mueve el paso, q asco de terreno
No le corran el arco a Teo jjaa
Pobre Teo si él es bueno,, había un topo en el Punto de penal yo lo vii,,,😂
claramente se ve que en el momento q apoya el pie izquierdo antes de impactar la pelota,se levanta el pasto y x ende ,sale el penal muy desviado.creo q no es culpa del jugador..es culpa del campo de juego..
es un madera este negro vende humo.tuvo suerte nomas.carroñero del orto
RIDICULO...ES EL NOMBRE DEL VIDEO.... PORQUE SI OBSERVAN MEJOR....SE SALE EL PASTO SINTETICO DE MIERDA QUE TIENE ESA CANCHA DE MIERDA.... RIDICULOS SON LOS QUE SE RIEN Y CRITICAN BOLUDECEN...MANGA DE BOLUDOSSSS
Viendo en cámara lenta, cuando apoyo el pie se levantó el balón.
le pego asi porque el portero le hizo un hueco al punto penal
veoq mas es de la grama
Parece un volcan el punto de penal jajaja horrible la cancha peor que la de mardel.
no me digan que en esta cancha de mierda se va a jugar la vuelta de Junior vs Cerro...
por no tomarse las vainas en serio teo nunca será del nivel de falcao ni james
Troncazo
ese gramado de barranquilla es asqueroso y eso disque le pusieron una nueva, pero sigue siendo una verguenza y lo mal quue nos hace quedar cuando juega la seleccion. Los mejores cespeds estan en Bogota, tanto en el campin como en el estadio de techo, y aclaro soy paisa por si las dudas
The ball moved when he stepped on his left foot, the earth moved the ball up.
los cachacos chimbo chiquito y sus videos de ardidos, jr tu padre
y luego los burrioristas se quejan cuando les dicen que su cancha es un lodal completo
Pero putierrez a quien echaron de River, Racing, Lanús, Rosario, Cruz azul, Turquía, Sporting Lisboa y muy pronto del burrior por gamin, tronco, ladrón, atracador, homosexual, simio, bruto, narco, farsante, payaso, drogadicto, alcohólico, etc.
0:23 Al apoyar el pie izquierdo se ve cómo éste se hunde y una montaña de tierra suelta se levanta y mueve el balón. Lo único ridículo es jugar con un campo de juego en ese estado.
jejeje , bueno despues que no pase en una final todo bien, ahora que revisen que paso con el gramado en ese lugar, del resto el mejor gramado de este pais ante los potreros de metrallin, cali, rolota y demas abominaciones de estadios.
...if Adalaide Byrd was there, she'd have given the fight to AJ Carter somehow...
Fuck me, he went down quicker than Khan's missus on AJ.
I understand they want to build up boxers confidence against weak opposition but why the fuck are they putting fights against factory workers and cab drivers on fucking telly
dubois needs to step up in opposition for his opponents sake.
Bad call from the ref. Should have called it at the 2nd knock down
DD is gonna dominate in the future!! 👊🏻👏👏👏
Good lad. He looked genuinely worried about his opponent after the KO
BEAST !
118-110 in favour of Carter
This was my first ever boxing match, sat close to the ring, wasn't expecting to see someone pulverised within 60 seconds
Ref was a scumbag for allowing it to continue after the second KD. He was on jelly legs. \n\nMismatches like this and incompetent refs like this will eventually result in an over matched opponent being killed with one shot in the ring.
Second knock down he was clearly unfit to carry on bad call ref
Wow what a talent..needs to be looked after..
This is the new Mike Tyson trust me
Shouldn't of been in there
why put him in the ring against such weak opponents... mike tyson was world heavyweight champion at his age.... they will never get a shot with bullshit promotors like frank warren
I love this kid! Defo would lead in the boxing ting! Only 19 or turned 20 ! Hella young
id get KO'd for a pay day too carter its all good
giving a fuck about the person lying k.o'ed on the floor potentially seriously injured just means you're not a psychopath and not much else, just saying
This man here takeing alot people out aj Joshua will get it promise ye
Ref shoulda stopped it after the second knockdown - something horrible about refs letting fighters get knocked unconscious unnecessarily...
DB needs to be fighting in the mortal kombat tournament with liu kang and sub zero not fighting in a boxing ring
is the Referee not fired yet?
Has some solid power but as always, knocking down weaker opposition doesnt really give me an idea of how he is going to be. Against menudo he was rocked in the first round, so I want to see him take some shots against live opposition before making a call. I wish him all the best though, seems like a nice lad and still got tonnes of time to develop.
Beast! Will be champ one day for sure.
Uk boxers are on a lead
No disrespect to carter but I have seen a few of his fights and he's an awful fighter, DD is to stiff, going no were
Didn't realise that guy is British.
Dubois got real heavy hands.
Chin meet TRUCK!!!!
Uk's Sonny Liston 🤔
definitely a future champ
Steroids
happy bday aj
Well done for trending!
Newcomer.
Dangerous fight
Let me guess, stepping up the hype against nobody's, if he's that good put him in with someone worthwhile.
This boy could genuinely give AJ some problems in a couple of years time! 🙂👍
Rumour has it that Dubious banged out Joshua in sparring
Hearn won't be letting this guy anywhere near Joshua's dodgy chin.
Lol.. stepped into the ring.. looked at the opponent.. didn't understand what happened next.. went to bed... Zzzzzzz..( the movie was so boring that I opted to sleep instead)
he will destroy joshua.. :)
You do not belong in the U.K any longer
I have a few friends who still don't buy Bruce's legendary status. This clip and the one of The Stones a few years back inviting him up for Tumbling Dice oughta silence them. The Stones, Sir Mick and Sir Paul don't just ask anybody on to their stage. Bruce has earned his way there. Brooooooooce.\nOh btw, love me some Paul. Still rocking and killing it and looking like a happy kid doing it!! The best.
Paul always -- ALWAYS -- sings significantly better when he has a friendly foe sharing the mic with him.
Hey by the way I love this video so much and I love paul mccartney! ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
Good to see Silvio Dante made it through the war with Brooklyn alright.
I know it's the Bruce thing, but I hate how when they yell Bruceeee it sounds like boo. That always bothered me. lol
You can tell Paul's drummer can't believe he's playing on the same stage with Bruce
Rolling Stone has posted your video FYI  https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-mccartney-springsteen-play-i-saw-her-standing-there-w503567
Was an awesome show! So glad I was able to witness it in person! Paul, Bruce and Little Steven greatness!
I just got home from the Barclays concert tonight, I loved it so much I'm gonna go see him when he goes to Nassau, it was an unbelievable concert that I will never forget. I hope everyone who has seen him so far and is going to had or will have the best time of there lives like I did. God bless Sir Paul McCartney
Im so jealous! i wish I will have the chance to see them together singing that song!!
Hopefully more jams between Bruce and Paul as the tour progresses!
Beatles/Paul, and Bruce Springsteen, my top 2 favorite artists. If I had witnessed that live, I'd have been freaking out like there was no tomorrow. I think I'd die if I had the chance to see the two perform together.
Seeing paul loving playing just as he did when he was young got me kinda choking up :')
I saw her standing and texting on her phone there
Along with Dylan, Young and Johnny Cash my all time hero. Long live The Boss
Holy shit. I would've lost my fucking mind if I was there.
The joy in Bruce's face to be back with a Beatle. Wonderful!
Paul McCartney now 75. Hope I can still be around at that age. What an amazing guy.
Jim I need a copy of this show
ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!ATTENTION!!!{BREAKING NEWS}\nHello guys, checkout some very very interesting information about Bruce Springsteen that everybody MUST know here http://bit.ly/2yg6zEZ
Best concert of my life! Thanks for posting!!!
I was there. Great videos Jim. Thank you.
The boss rocking a les paul like his ol' teenage self! Suits him well!
I was in London 2012, the concert he mentioned, when they first sang this song together
great performance
Paul, Bruce, ..AND LITTLE STEVEN
Thank you.
I was there!
Thanks God
É ÓTIMO COMO CANTOR. ABRAÇO.
Stevie!!!
Me too
why the crowd are humming?
Did I hear people booing??? Why on earth would they do that??????
Is the crowd booing?
Thought he was dead.
Boo!!
the only thing I don't like about this is that Springsteen is faking it on guitar - you'd think he would learn the song and play along - it's only 5 chords
why the crowd are humming?
Jessie J is cool 👌
Jessie, you are growing.  Keep coming sweetness.  People will notice.
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfaU2tpdWJY

Sorry i was Dislike Because i think i Thumbs Down Your Earlier Songs i love before now i'm Dislike SORRY.
U N D E R A T E D
It's so sad that this don't get so many views while Miley gets 35 million. No hate tho (I love Miley) Jessie J is just waaaaay too underrated for someone so talented 💔
ayyyyy lets go! she on a new vibe, love it
why is jessie such a bad ass
Finally someone who makes music because SHE LOVES IT not because of the charts, yes today's music is catchy but they are fucked up, every singer is changing the sound they used to have just to sell and Jessie is making music for herself, because she loves what she does, because she wants to give meaning to the songs and not just a rythm, I have to say I didn´t liked the sound but the lyrics are meaningful (just as all the songs she actually writes)
Is it just me or do you kinda get a Beyonce lemonade bare your soul type feel to this song?? No...just me then😂😂
Jessie J is Back and She Is Slaying our lifes
I can't even remember how many times I have watched this
Already on of my favs , stripped back just a simple beat and her voice . Love the black and white vid , great visual and gorgeous
I thought she stopped making music bc of that confessions song
Am i the only one who's getting RiRi vibes?
3:12 ca which song does the melody remind me of? please help
The male backing vocal sounds like Ali Campbell!
Oh damn at 0:22 and ummm... 0:26 wow!!! letting it all hang out I see. This is true art at its finest though. You go Jessie with your fine @ss.

Well well!! About time!! And what a huge return!!! Your songs supported me when mostly needed without even know it lady and I am always honest!! DAAAAMMM you maked everyone shut up!! Well done Jessie J!! Well done!!!
It's not a surprise that this song is about her record label. A lot of artists find themselves in similar situations. Sara Bareilles song Love Song is all about how her record label was going to drop her if she didn't put a love song on the record so that's what she came up with to appease them without writing them an actual love song. \n\nThen Katy Perry's song Dark Horse is all about her record label enslaving her too. Before she was famous she was tied into a deal and that company said, we can't release her music she doesn't match our image, but we can't let her go to another label otherwise she could be a big star! some employee at the first label risked her livelihood (job) and help get Katy Perry out of that deal. She was successful and Katy Perry became the big star we know today.\n\nThe Veronicas got trapped by Warner Brother's too. Then they weren't approving their music, and the girls fought like mad. Eventually they managed to become free from that deal and are now signed with Sony, but IDK if their situation is any better there. We only hear from them every so often.\n\nPeople like to think their dreams will come true if they sign a record deal. The truth is, that's the first step of a very long, hard, and difficult uphill battle.
Here are the lyrics: (If you're reading this, have a great day!!!)\n\n\n[Intro]\nMmm, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've carried this load for way too long\nI couldn't let you go, under a spell of don't, don't, don't\nEgo reaction, guess I was holding up face\nBy saving your ass, you spent my money and I lost their faith\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI screamed Yes, you told me, Nah\nYou fed me fear, I spoke to God\nI was living my dreams through your eyes\nBuilding my life on your lies, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYou just laughed when I cried\nThink about that\nWho lives the real sacrifice?\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about\nThink about that, wow\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll you disturb is my work and my patience\nYears of grindin', you took it, you broke it and all 'cause you fake it\nYou wanna be famous, say it, you wanna be famous\nUsing my juice, was thirsty as fuck, always late, always faded\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI screamed Yes, you told me, Nah\nYou fed me fear, I spoke to God\nI was living my dreams through your eyes\nBuilding my life on your lies, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nYou just laughed when I cried\nThink about that\nWho lives the real sacrifice?\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about that\n\n[Verse 3]\nThink about that time when you blamed me\nThink about that time when I called you up\nAnd I said I needed saving\nThink about that time when you said you cared\nYou were lying, tryna phaze me\nThink about that time when I got sick\nAnd you made me go on stage\nThink about that time when you used my fate\nTo stack up on your paper\nThink about that time you told my label lies, you said She's crazy\nThink about the fact they see it now\nYou're a shark, a cheat, a traitor (shark, a cheat, a traitor)\n\n[Chorus]\nThink about that\nThink about that\nThink about (hey)\nThink about it\nThink about it (oh, no)\nThink about that (yeah)\nThink about that
always loved her ..vocals on point :)
Plz come to Japan Jess😭🙏\nYour voice is awesome
Amazing! So hot and powerful!! <3 <3
Jessica , thank you for existing !!! I am proud to be an HEARTBEAT !!! Francis
YESSS SHE NEEDS TO STAY WITH THIS KIND OF VIBE
Where have all the classy women gone? 😩
Ok, awesome lyrics, but  just another who needs to show her ass to move forward... Cheap...
Jessie J fan here, but something ain't right with the beat or the melody. You can't vibe to it.
I love it! 😍👏🏾🔥

awesome track!
Wow !!
this shit bang!
HA. QUEEN!
I Love! !!!!!
Jessie j and v. Bozman would make history
Wow 😍
DONA DE ¼ DO MEU CU!!❤️
why she didn't show her extremely beautiful  big voice
Can anyone here Seal - kiss from a rose melody in this or is it just me?
I am trying to understand what's this beautiful song has to do with this soft porn video.\nWhat the fuck are you tryin to proof, Jessie? You know you don't need to show your ass to anybody.\nYou got THE VOICE.
Real artist always have problem with popularity. Jessie J has strongest voice on music industry. She can slay evey single song, she can rap, be sexy and cute in same time. She don't need twerk to be QUEEN. She don't need back dancers, she don't have to dance to her songs, because her voice is everything is needed. She's my hero, my soul companion. I support her since Price Tag. I'm glad She's back because I fking miss her and her songs. \nSlay queen, slay! <3
OK. Let's get down to it. She is not naked for no reason. The song is exposing the people who restricted her mind and her emotions and is about her freeing herself from their hands. The video shows her tied up, a mask covering her face and her body exposed. At the end of the video she is free from them and the mask comes off.
Damn, is this song about Luke James?
I'm really don't like have argument about the sings , for more I thinking is all for me , my mind still space for a lot imagination, but I'm try don't blame the artist. I wish one deu know more from every singles I like and understand every music.
I love it that she didn't have a boob job like most of the other female songers with smaller boobs. go girl 👧💕
ANTI + LEMONADE + a tiny bit of MELODRAMA = THIS
flop
WOW what a fantastic come back single...! GOD I MISS GIRLS ALOUD!
OMG I LOVE IT!
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
why does this not show up in youtube search !???
DM'ing Nadine my resumé in the hopes that she can land me a job at this office
Nadine + Xenomania = Pop perfection. Oh, how I've missed this sound!
*_CHERYL WHO??????_*
One of 2017 best songs!! <3
Potential to be a hit if she promotes it well and the radio stations put it on their playlists.
Love it Queen
Welcome back my queen 👑❤
Queen Nadine!!!! 👑💄⌚💸👸
What a fantastic voice, kind regards from Ecuador!!!
We need more views, she is amazing, love the song!
I hope this song does well
Brilliant ,She deserves a top 5 hit at least 💯👌 What a voice n she is HOT 😈 and Irish
There's something with Nadine that you can feel and see her inner diva!! My god every music video she has done her inner diva comes out! And I love it!! Go girl!!
YESSS NADINE! That's how you do a COMEBACK!!! 😌🙌🏾❤️
who's here before #OneMillionViews?
Love this sound! :) Let's hope for a complete project with an album.
Cheryl who?
I like this new song by Nadine! 😊xx
Brilliant and so catchy. Nadine works it in this video. Definitely best member of GA for me. Hope people get behind this and it's a great pop song.
This will be my favorite song of all time, I love you Nadine Coyle from Venezuela!
I love this song it's so catchy.
Can't believe she made a new gay anthem! 😍
Omg she's amazing!
OMG I miss you bitchhh 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Cheryl who? Amazing Nadine <3 <3 <3
Love it😍👌
oh my gosh I’m so proud agagaggagagqtgq
Love this!
Good work! ))
Amazing voice welcome back sis
it feels like a britains next top model challenge but i love it anyway. justice for nadine !
This is how you make a BOP
Let's dance till our wigs get off, queen NUHDEEN deserves it !\n#TeamNadineFRANCE
i love it!
Ammazing
Im seeing Dua Lipa set some tendency on music videos... only thing I dont like is her make up and hair, make her looks a bit older
1:34 me thinking about going to work
I was waiting for Days for this Song to be released and boy was it worth the wait.   It's got a Blue Eyed Soul Vibe to it but she was always good at that.   I could see this Song & Video being on BET (Black Entertainment Television) who also played Adele's Videos.  I also love The Video itself.  It shows Professional Women Of Color who look like they came straight out of Essence Magazine (The Longest Running African American Women's Magazine In The US that debuted in 1970).  Can you imagine how The Irish POPSTARS' must feel now. They sneered at her back in the day, now look where she is and where they are.  I would be so embarrassed if it were me.  You Go Nadine You Beautiful Blue Eyed Soul Sistah!  The best is still yet to come for you.
She needs to find herself a better label.
bloody love this!!
I love this song! Thanks for remembering your US fans. I can't wait for the next single.
By FAR best voice from GA!!!!
She has good voice
I live in the USA ST LOUIS TO BE EXACT I play this In my car despite all the rioting that's happen it's my MOTIVATION SONG TO KEEP GOING LOVE AND THANK YOU NADINE XOXOX
When i first heard this track i hated it. It's been a few days now and i cant stop singing it.
I think the song is a bit generic and disappointing but I will support Nadine on this no matter what. I hope the album comes soon and is great.
Nadine de volta e eu nem tava sabendo... vai ter álbum?
Bring that money home, honey. Welcome back Queen.
Good work Nadine. Great song!! From Argentina
this song seriously grows on you! <3
Love it, Nadine is great.
Daaamn
Awesome song and video and Nadine looks hot 💙

Wow una artista nueva, su voz es muy hermosa. Esta canción es buena
Slaying 👑👑👑

debería tener mas vistas
Omg luv u girll
instant noodles
Just Amazing!flawless,class,fierce ✅✅✅❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Yes ma'am!
Full on BOP.
Cheryl got the fame instead Nadine 😖
DOES ANY 1 ELSE AGREE WITH ME THAT THE TRUE TALENT ON GIRLS ALOUD NADINE COYLE NEEDS TO BE A JUDGE ON THE VOICE OR X FACTOR.  ITV PLEASE HAVE NADINE COYLE AS JUDGE ON THE VOICE.
She is nothing without Girls Aloud ... sad to say but the 5 girls together are the best ! Chemistry ...
Such a copy of Britney's ''Womanizer'' video. Like if you agree.
Aw great, another piece of manufactured crap that sounds like every other song on the radio. It's already flopped
It's an enjoyable video but I feel like this really needed a dance routine! Love the song though.
she's been out the music scene so long she's vertically forgotten
She is stunning but the video and song is shockly bad. I hope she is more picky going forward as she is capable of smashing out no1 records
Awful music but she is stunning.
I met her she thinks she's so famous I was working at a store and she walked in with her child and she gave this golden credit card thing that said her name😂
I don't know why but this song reminds me of Daft Punk - Get Lucky
I always was mesmerized by her in girls aloud, but it was due to her looks. I thought girls aloud we're known for lip syncing. I don't know if this is her honest voice, but the lyrics is kind of terrible especially for someone who wants to break out, so to speak.
love it but I can't with her trying to move her eyebrows every time even though her face is so full of botox lmao
in 2007 it could be #1 hit
Sorry this is terrible
Britney Spears womanizer 😍
What a flop sorry
Theme tune for Jeremy Kyle lol
Why dont you stop singing
I'd smash.
<3 About damn time!
I like the song. But I dont understand why she couldn't change outfits and do a dance routine. People love to watch Cheryl dance and wear all these cute clothes which makes them buy the music despite her voice which is lacking. Cheryl's videos have lots of beautiful sexy shots of her which keeps ppl coming back for more. I love Nadine but I'm afraid she's about to make the same mistake. How can you make such an infectious tune and not dance. Beware Nadine, people will get bored.
I got so emotional from this haha love you Miley, have been a smiler for 11 years now and will keep supporting you ❤️ love from Brazil 🇧🇷
THIS HAS TO BE FAKE CAUSE HOLY SHIT
YESSSSSS!!!!
Is it her new song?
Beautiful*\n\n\n\n*The Hannah Montana version was better.
Am i the only one crying?
She should do a duet with Lady Gaga. :)
I love this version is wooo
Who's that girl rocking that cello?
this is abSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
this song just reminds me of my childhood
Also, would it be too much to ask to record past Hannah/Miley hits in this laid-back country style? :D *bats eyelashes* Jk jk ......(except I really would love that)
Please release it on Spotify.
This makes me so happy
She sigs quite well when she sings live
I can dig this \nNot her black appropriation
No one says how beautiful is the girl playing cello :OOO <3333333333
She should re-release this version!
Anyone else think this looks like the chicken coop she built in the Hannah Montana movie?
I need Hannah Montana again😭😭😭😭😭💙💙
I love her voice !!
On my bf account cause he has YouTube red and I can repeat this a billion times haha I love you Miley been a fan since forever you're just so truly amazingly beautiful and awesome 💕
In another life I wanna be her, i felt like Ive known her in another life, I felt this deep connection when I look into her eyes.. Amazing down-to earth strong woman.. Salute miley! 😉😍😘☺
I WAS LIKE NO FUCKING WAY SHE SANG SEE YOU AGAIN, THIS HAS TO BE A NEW SONG AND OH MY GOD I'M SO GLAD SHE DID. MY POOR LITTLE FANGIRL HEART AHHHHH
You re just perfect. I get chills when you say ''my heart can t rest till then'' 😻😻😻
Miley u spoiled lucky bitch from ur shirt to your rings, your have worked so hard for that rainbow studio and your band looks great. Keeping rocking girl you got a fan rite here! Much love one love
I like this version better honestly
Been there days, still destroying the replay button.
Country musics makes everything sound way better and smoother 🤙👌
A beautiful tone. One of the few artists I could listen to all day.
I love the country take on this song!
I knew Hanna Montana never died
Yaaaay this was one of my faves of hers. Now it’s even better. Throwback!
This feels like a really mature version of the song, love it!
Again and Again love for this song!
I saw this and it's been stuck in my head I needed to come back
Wow
me encanta...la  amo :)
goosebumps all over
Hannah montana vibes omg
Loooooveeeee her
I feel13 yo again
I love it <3

This is the best I just
So is she finally back to country?
This use to be my jam

Anyone think of club penguin?
I love it. Love you as well. Love the new. Hugs. Peace
Amazing what changing the music can do...I like it!
See you again, my childhood <3 Thank you, the girl !
Remember when she changed lyrics 'my best friend Demi said'?
i'm so happy. so. happy.
I thought she was covering Charlie Puth
i feel so old. this song was everything back in the day.
Got damn...i love it so much 😩❤
wow i love her
miley is so beautiful im crying. this seriously touches my thirteen year old heart.
She should record bottom of the ocean again in this style, would be sooo beautiful
still a skank.cant change that.

once more, one of you will write that Hannah Montana is back😠 I will found you and kill you!!
Love her voice and outfit 😍
Yes Miley! I actually prefer this version better 💟
Love this version <3
See You Again\n\nI got my sights set on you\nAnd I'm ready to aim\nI have a heart that will\nNever be tamed\n\nI knew you were something special\nWhen you spoke my name\nNow I can't wait to see you again\n\nI've got a way of knowing\nWhen something is right\nI feel like I must have known you\nIn another life\n'cause I felt this deep connection\nWhen you looked in my eyes\n\nNow I can't wait to see you again\n\n[Chorus:]\nThe last time I freaked out\nI just kept looking down\nI stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking about\nFelt like I couldn't breathe\nYou asked what's wrong with me\nMy best friend Leslie said Oh she's just being Miley\nThe next time we hang out\nI will redeem myself\nMy heart can rest till then (a-whoa a-whoa)\nNow I can't wait to see you again\n\nI got this crazy feeling deep inside\nWhen you called and asked to see me tomorrow night\nI'm not a mind reader but I'm reading the signs\nThat you can't wait to see me again\n\n[Chorus]\n\nI got my sight set on you and I'm ready to aim\n\n[Chorus]\n\n(a-whoa a-whoa)\nNow I can't wait to see you again
She is looking so beautiful, she is the best singer in the world, and she is my God.
This makes me more than happy

This is so gooooood. Her voice is great! Great country mix too.

I bet a lot of actresses and actors daydream of making it big also in music one day like Miley Cyrus:-)
I st-st-st-stuttered when u asked me what I'm thinking bout.\nSo happy to hear this song again. She has improved her singing so much. If you see her old performances of this song, her voice has gotten so much beautiful over the years!!!
Love her voice ❤️❤️❤️

I took the quiz like 3 times then i took the real one and every time i got gryffindor
Amazing I love it !
Any tips on how to get pigmented lips like Nikkie's? :(
Nikki put a spell on me ,, made me love her more than demons love the devil ❤️🙄🙌🏼❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️😍😍💃🏻
Make the other houses!! Btw other slytherins here??🐍🐍
Im a griffin do or
you should have a tutorial for all of the houses! i'm a hufflepuff and would love to see you use yellow and black
This is so AMAZING GIRL
but who has time to do all that?
I belong to sletherin and huffelpuff ( sorry If I spelt it wrong correct me if I'm wrong)
I did the Pottermore one and I got Ravenclaw
what a glam makeup using NIKKI!😋😋😋
Can you do makeup collection, I would be so happy💗😅😘😘
@nikkietutorials absolutely beautiful look girl!!  Love it, and you!  Just curious, what eyelash glue do you use?
I'm not trying to be mean but she wears WAYYYY too much makeup.
Am i the only one who wanted her to do the actual pottermore quiz?
You should do one for each house!
Only quiz that's actually legit is Pottermore. I'm a Ravenclaw on there :)
Can you review the subculture palette ??
I'm... All the things.  What the fuck buzzfeed, that's the worst result. According to Pottermore I'm a hufflepuff.
Griffindor
BEST TUTORIAL EVERRRR
Lol
MAH INNA CORNA! 😎
I was gryffindor
that is beautiful
Ravenclaw
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You should do a full makeup collection
I've been dying to get these. They just look so pretty.  I did a review on the mermaid brushes. Have you tried them??
Hey everyone! We're a new channel and we just posted our first video. We are going to be doing reviews, tutorials, and more (based on what you guys comment). We have 2 completely different hair/skin types, tones, and textures so we'll be trying to help more people than we could with just one of us. Hope you to see you on the channel soon!
Omg this make up is unreal
She said Harry Potter, I picked my phone up and screamed, SUUUHBSCRIBING
Bless this look and bless this video ❤
You should try the Pottermore quiz because that one is the real test that is made by Jk Rowling
Lovely video , i love all the products x
I wanna see you do Once Upon a Time character make up tutorials :D
Could you do a Hufflepuff inspired makeup?? 😍😍😍
What a great way to combine so many recent make-up trends, well done Nikki ♥ Also, YASSS for the look ;-)
can you do a make up tutorial for every house ? xxxxxx
it's amazing how one can do such art with make-up😍\nwhen i try something like that i look like i fell in a pot of colour😂
I'm in Ravenclaw. Love your makeup every time hope one do to be as amazing as you 😍
Where did you get this headpiece?? It's beautiful!!
Low key annoyed you used a buzzfeed quiz instead of the Pottermore quiz. Pottermore is the official quiz.
The minute i saw storybook cosmetics, i was eternally screaming.
I got 30% hufflepuff & 29% Gryffindor.. so it was a pretty close call
Ello fellow gryffindor!  ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ I love this look so much! It is absolutely gorgeous!!! Could you do the other houses? And also take the Pottermore house and wand quiz that was made by  JK Rowling?
hey nikkie i love your magic makeup . STUNNING make up girl and i love your personality . good job
One must not do the buzz feed quiz.. ONE MUST DO THE POTTERMORE OFFICIAL QUIZ
You should have gone to Pottermore! But still, amazing look and that palette looks awesome :O
Nikki when is ofra restocking? I just received the blind the haters highlighter.... now I need the other two 😫😫
lol sorry for being a buzzkill but the offical test is on pottermore.
Pls do Slytherine ... \n'Cause im one of them \n*kiss Malfoy's cheek* \nMINE
I'm a Hufflepuff 🙌🙌🙌
Love this look. I went onto their website to see this palette and they released a Charlie and the chocolate factory palette. OMG ordered it right away! Thanks for the tutorial, awesome as always!
Omggg i love Harry Potter. Loved this video!
The ad before this video was for HARRY POTTER!!
MY PATRONUS IS GOING CRAZY OVER THIS MAKEUP!!!

CATCH OF THE YEAR BETTER THAN WHATEVER BUM ASS ODELL COULD EVER DO
Here comes the Odell heaters
This man is so underrated
That was a running back!
Power Bomb, courtesy of Captain Insano
Nice footwork sexy catch by the way
@Kybron Mvp 18-1Forever Stfu your just saying that cuz you obviously have a vendetta against Odell.. This catch wasn't as good as his because the extension wasn't as far and he didn't do it with a defender draped all over him...your acting like its something Odell would be incapable of kys
Thumbnail is littt
Wow
Better than Odell

Looking for football on youtube and what appears...\n\nStop calling this sport of “FOOT – BALL”!!!\nBecause it is played with the HAND and not with the FOOT.\n\nYou hard heads! \nYou are saying one thing and doing another completely different.\n\nThis sport is the violent American version (running by the “FOOT with the BALL” in the hand) of the brutal English  rugby, with much body crash and blow of head against head like  a Spanish fight of furious bulls.\n\nThe SOCCER ((not soccer and yes FOOTBALL)) is the real and true FOOTBALL played with the FOOT and not with the HAND, for this reason it is the most famous and popular sport practiced in the whole world.\nThe practice of a sport is clear in its name.\n\nThe origin of the FOOTBALL. \nSee it here: watch v=2sd_8pryoxo
For all you you negative fake fans, fuck off!!!! In Klopp i trust and future looks good. KEEP THE SPIRIT HIGH. YNWA SWEDEN
Calm the fuck down you bunch of infantile imbeciles. Klopp's got at least 5 more years to build a team. We haven't got money on the scale of you-know-whos nor the type of manager who needs endless amounts of cash to buy, sell and buy again, top quality players. Klopp will bring us success in his own way and time. Have some patience and take it on the chin. I know some of you crave bragging rights cause your mate's are laughing at you and your shit team. Man up ffs!
I fucking love klopp like my dad and personally I think our midfield and attack is good enough to challenge for titles so good job on him sorting that side of our team out. But to still have a shite defence after nearly three years is criminal. And his faith shown to klavan and lovren this season may well be the downfall of our campaign. I'd rather have fucking Milner CB then klavan or lovren.
be angry all you want but atleast find a good enough reason to be. People slating the defence: apart from the defensive error the defense delt brilliantly with all that Burnley offered, robbos positioning was exceptional.\nPeople slating the attack: You have the right to criticize the forwards for not linking up as well as they could have but ultimately we did make enough chances and apart from the final pass we looked to break them down. Keep in mind that this lot kept out Chelsea and spurs as well, but every draw or negative result is takn in a generalised manner by Liverpool fans.\nWe had a plan, they had a plan, they executed theirs better than we did ours, but we also got unlucky. I take positives from the fact we have the elememnts now with coutinho playing deep to open up smaller teams, ultimately when this particular lineup of players gels together I can see us doing bits. We've already seen our counter attacking lineup, with gini can and hendo tear it up.
The German Brendan Rodgers.
Message to all Liverpool fans reading these comments:\nWe've been through worse, we need to pull together and support our team during times like this. IMO I agree with Klopp in that this is the best performance we've put in against Burnley, what we are lacking is clinical finishing amongst the squad in positions where we NEED to score, and I think partly what can help is some confidence. Yes, we didn't get a CB in the window and having done that could have made things different, but we need to put that behind us and keep going forward. #YNWA\n\nRandom side note, just wait until the squad clicks.........I'm almost sure we won't be disappointed. #Patience
klopp is a world class manager ...to any fan commenting otherwize you're not a real fan ...if you can't support us when we draw or loose then you're not a true fan ...!!
Man Im starting to get sick and tired of these so-called fans posting their bullshit online, the LFC Facebook page is full of fucking idiots trashing the team and now this comment section is getting worse, if you are a Liverpool fan then get behind the team, if not then fuck off. #COYR #YNWA #LIVERPOOLFOREVER
Wow, i didn't know how toxic the liverpool fan base is! You're not real fans, please accept, klopp deserves better than you people.
I was a Liverpool fan before most of the people in this comment section were born. But you know what, I agree with them. Klopp is a moron, he's blinded by his own ego and never admits to any of his mistakes. Also, he's stubborn, the reason we dont have any new center backs is because it's an admission of fault from his part if he buys one. Remember, all last season he said we have a great defence and that we don't need new players. So he does't want to go back on his statement. That's how stubborn and dumb he is. This team won't win anything, mark my words. I hope Klopp gets fired before the January window, so we can get a proper defence in place.
We are liverpool... our manager will do right by the club. Not signing for sake of signing. He is building a tean not buying a team like other clubs .
O and time 6.20 he going Newcastle Lmao and the team going Manchester Lmao told u not top top management shame lfc are a good club and think they use recruitment agency when they doing the hireing lol
Win/lose/draw...players get paid the same wage, dock em and you'll see improvements and the chaff will be separated and sold for peanuts to Arsenal
Should have signed a CB
Everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Fans are so emotional and fickle. two weeks ago after the arsenal game everyone was on top of the world. now, two draws and a loss and it's like we need to support the team in times like these comments. yes, our defense is shit but it's early days. A couple wins and we are back in the race and it's group stage in the CL, all with 1 pt. everyone fukn relax.
Get the results & talk less, Old Bob just get the results to do his talking!!!!!

I agree the defence is shocking and we need to sort it out. But we don't need to sack him, give him some time. I understand he has been manager for a while now but let's not be a Chelsea or man city. Let the manager do his job. If we sack him,  who do we get in?. There is nobody so let's get behind the team.
Wait until we get Keita we will never concede. \n\nKlopp is doing the right Thing, fair enough we didn't get a cb in the window but what u gotta remember: \nMane: Sent off\nLallana: Injured\nClyne: Injured\nThat's 3 of our main starters out and yes we did basically have our main team out but lovren wasn't in it, and the three people I mentioned I believe could change the team easily. And for all the fake fans who are complaining are not true fans. Like if ur a true fan. #YNWA
Fraud get out of our club #ynwa
We drew a game against a team that have had results against Chelsea and Spurs. I didn't go the game but I listened to it and watched extended highlights. It very much looked/sounded like we battered them. I'm a little bit bored of the goalkeeper/defence debate. They're all good players, they don't get any protection from the midfield, as the midfield are intent on marauding forward. It will get tweaked and we will put together a decent run of results. All the haters need to 'calm down'.
5-0 drubbing from city, 1-1 against Burnley at Anfield..\n\nPeople are upset because early on, we haven't seen any improvement from last season (so far) people are angry, and no one has a right to say that you can't get angry as a fan, it's like saying you can't be a human being and support Liverpool. Shut the fuck up. \n\nME personally, I trust in Klopp, and he is getting a rude lesson in the premier league at the moment, and it's in these times managers learn, and become better. \n\nI'm patient, but don't say to someone they're not a fan because they're pissed off, not everyone is going to rationalise things in the same way. We go again.
Mashraf Brownie well said buddy...Klopp was the best thing that has happened to this club in years...now you want him gone😂😂😂 you fuck tards😭 HE HAS MY BACKING, HES MY MANAGER YOU FUCKERS
Actually ,this time we didn't draw because of the defence.We lost point today because we missed too many easy chances
Football is for nerds.\n\nPlay League of Legends scrubs
Klopp is a one trick pony and never seems to learn from his mistakesThis defence are leauge of lreland standard,,,,,no offence to leauge of lreland
has he won a trophy at Liverpool yet?
Excuses galore. There is always   if ,but , only . JK is a great guy but not a great manager. We now sit 5 points off the top and the season as really only just started. I fear the winter as we get injuries, suspensions and involved in more and more competitions. Until we can go to places like Watford and win 6   0 then we will always be average . If we do not buy at least 4/5 decent players inc a goalkeeper then we will be out of all competitions by March . I have no doubt we will field a weak team in Jan for the FA cup and JK only aim will be fourth place for UCL again. Which to me is pointless if you are never going to win it .
disgusting behaviour by the club should have sol phil and bou9ght a striket
we are going on a winless streak till manu game ifwepay like thid
he needs to make subs earlier
To all the Liverpool fans getting irritated about negative comments. This is what Arsenal fans go through every year from 2003.
All this klopp hate is ridiculous. Sure the defence is leaky there's no denying that. But he has assembled one of the best attacking squads in Europe. Period. People are too impatient. 2 seasons in charge and he's brought us to to Europa final and within the top 4. Rodgers had his one off season which brought us close to the English title and before him was the epic champions league title in 06. Rome wasn't built in a day and quite frankly even if we aren't a title contender this season we play one of the best football on our best day (which honestly aren't far between each other). I have faith in klopp and our squad and I have faith he will continue to build and assemble a title winning team. And a question to all the klopp haters: what manager are you guys praying for that is available to just come and suddenly win titles?  Klopp and the reds knows there's an army of faithful who will always walk with you #ynwa
Patience is the key for success. LFC fans please give time to this guy. Because in dortmund he had time and independent to take decisions and another main reason was at that time, no other club had so much money to buy ready made players. For eg see Burnley they are happy with one point also because they have no money and fully support their manager. They think whatever he do is good for Burnley. When they where religated he was the manager and now also he is the manager.we have to learn from Burnley,because this guy  is much better than plastic managers like jose and pep.
Always a lot of talks... bla bla bla... and after dramatic disaster with City there is a worse match against Burnley. All team puts effort to attack, to support Salah but they don't arrive much goals...and, on the other hand, defense is too much under pressure collapsing first or later!  SALAH left Chelsea and Chelsea started to win again.!  Klopp & Flopp a strong disaster.!😂😂😂😂😂
Klopp \n\nPro's\n\nExciting attacking football\nPotential to smack sides of all abilties\nMotivating\n\nCon's\n\nDefending transition, since the fullbacks get really high up the park as he attacks in numbers\nEgo and stubborn i.e. won't add an extra defender to defend a lead.
a lot of weekend/game day managers in here that think klopp doesn't have the defense sorted and think he's naive/arrogant to the quality of the back performances. hard to think you can't comprehend that he probably wanted to buy specific defenders, and had x,y,z plans and adjustments for defense. the reality of the deals not being closed in the window (not in his control) means he has no choice but to show positive reenforcement in the belief and work rate of the players he has to work with. on the pitch for game day or in the training grounds and at the end of the day—it's always the players, not the manager. if he doesn't (in the public eye) show that he at least believes in the system and their ability to play in it—then the players wouldn't give any shit either.
Fucking idiot turning into Wenger! Play Gomes centre back! play two defensive midfielders or even play 5 at the ffs 😂 find a fucking solution! Dropping and replacing klavan and lovren with each other is a fucking waste

Win lose or draw it's Liverpool forever. We are going trough a bad patch now but it will get better all clubs do at some point in the season it's better for us to get it over with early. We will get new players in January and finish the season strong. Jurgen knows what he is doing we just have to have faith in him and give more time. He is the best manager we have had in a long time.
When ur winning ur happiest fans in england but soon as u lose or draw u never stop fucking moaning stfu u shit fans UTC🔴🔵🔴🔵
Disappointed with all the negative comments.. we have to keep encouraging and supporting him and the team no matter what! #YNWA
Flopp is changing the team so often he is destroying the team not building it. Players have bad moral. Not to mention lack of tactic, players are running like zombies with no apparent plan. he is wearing them down. He plays players out of position, does not use ones he has, delays changes, did I say he does not study the different teams we play. He probably tell the players come on boyz go there do your thing, and thats the plan de jour and every jour
I hate what we are right now and I won't excuse anything, that being said I won't stop supporting both manager and players. If you think different then you should check your self\nKlopp is a world class manager who has access to world class coaches, our owners seem a bit tight in terms of net spend but we have improved. I am not satisfied, I complain but I do not wish Klopp out as that would be stupid.
The best manager in the world!!! Our klopp!!
Created enough chances? We had 2-3 real good ones, one of them leading to the goal. That's pathetic if you have 150% ball possession. Klopp needs to take a cold shower.
Stick together still early days
This guy never has any fucking answers for anything on or off the pitch. What a pathetic excuse for a manager.
Im a Liverpool fan but this is so true:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttack wins you games,defence wins you titles.   Btw im not Klopp out.Im defence out new defence in (especially cb's)
theirs only 2 reasons we didnt improve the defence Klopp or the owners.We had a supposed £2000million to spend ,and we spent at the most £50 million at the least £30million after selling players.Something is definitely wrong .Why will no one ask him directly why we didnt improve the defence ,its a joke to every other team and their supporters.I feel embarrassed
If liverpool defenders were more confident in the air  challenge better and were tighter at the back we would not concede as many goals.
All WHO says klopp out Are fake fans
First time i am a doubting this man, its the same old shite. This season was supposed to be different, in reality very much the same. Obviously is a brilliant manager, but teams have figured us out and he has no answer to this. I can only hope he will soon.
Solanke  must start next match ,he's more proactive in attack than Than Firmino.
If you are #KloppOut then you're simply plastic and deluded.
I’m sorry the back 4 is apauling I don’t know what to say. It’s bs, Why don’t we put Moreno LW?? Everyone moans about him playing to high when he’s in LB why don’t we try him LW whilst Mane is out, push firmino back to his no. 9 role. It’s hopeless,  Klopp said ‘there was no CenterBacks on offer’ De Virj from Lazio, Koulibaly, anyone but Klavan and Lovren. I feel sorry for Matip for what he has to play with. Come on guys it’s not hard. If u take in the fans opinions and ideas maybe just maybe we might do something. Ideally I don’t wanna see Klopp go But I DO wanna see changes. It’s BS!!! COYR // YNWA
so many negative comments and klopp out screamers. i understand that but people are angry about those point losses over and over but i also think you need to realize that liverpool haven't been an elite team for many years now. yes they need to address defense but its easier said than done. the marked for middle inns is such small and once anyone on high skill level hits the market you compete with lots of top clubs. even city had huge probs to find defenders. and what i want to add cause of all this negativity after the sevilla game - just please don't forget that pool hasn't been real madrid the past 2 years. sevilla won the euro league 3 times in a row. spanish top team since years. and liverpool dominated and could have lead 4-1 at half. plenty of things to improve but its not all that dark
With or without Coutinho LiverJail is still disappointing!\nThey should let him go! Karma is punishing Klop!
As a LFC Fans, I'm extremely disappointed and also very angry seeing this team playing dirty football. Sturridge was not good at all today and he was still on the pitch. Solanke is better and he never plays always on this bloody bench. klopp always use the same plays so it doesn't shock me if small team is beating us. Spending lots of money on good player and they don't even play. Nowadays I'm asking myself if klopp is a great manager or not. In every we can see the same mistake everywhere. \nSubstitution after 75' of play, even if the team is loosing. in 15', the game can't change with only one fresh player. \nKlopp so disappointing to have as LFC manager
I am a diehard Liverpool fan and I have always supported Klopp but to be honest Klopp is stubborn and it costing us a lot. I wonder why he wants so much forwards and midfielders without sorting out the defense, it's not like he didn't know about it all along. I never thought I would be saying this but I don't think Klopp is good enof for Liverpool
After 15mins you could predict how the game is going to end, Klopp is an excellent manager so is Sean Dyche for getting a point out of this game, well done to him, however the focus must be on how Klopp fields his team, in my opinion he should have started the game with solkane and ox, you could see firmino and salah was looking tired. Klopp will win games with this side Gk- Ward , LB -Robertson, CB -Matip, CB Gomez, RB -Alexander, MF -Couthino, Henderson, GIGI, FW- Mane, Daniel, Salah. Subs - Simon, Lovren, Firmino, ox, solanke. Comment your best xi LFC Fans.
Time is ticking now on this manager, his choices in the transfer windows are turning out to be woeful. Any defensive coaches work at Melwood?
Disappointed but we need to keep going and believe in Klopp. thought we were could have been more clinical and credit to Burnley they were very disciplined. YNWA
Wtf was that!?I'm sick of this shit.Klopp with a hard heart I'm telling you man...you are wasteing everybody's time.The bad news is that you could do more but you are like all germans...stubborn,in everything good or bad.After 2 years you only have 4 players Mane Matip Salah and Wijnaldum and Milner mostly on the bench so doesn't count.Taday was bad luck but we could easyly lose.Poor plan for first 11,no plan B and nothing  good in the future only a 6th place maybe.
These Klopp out comments aren't Liverpool fans. You see the same exact guys on other videos declaring themselves as Manc fans. Don't fall for it, jeez.
rome wasn't built in a day. he inherited lovern, Henderson and  Firminio what do you expect lol\n\nbe patient
Fuck you kloop we are sick an tired off your fucking hope  gooooooooooo
I haven't been critical of Klopp but I have been noticing he is not really good at game management. The times at which he makes substitutions always baffles me. I think he is too much of a patient person overall. The substitutions are sometimes too late in the game to have an impact and why the hell didn't OX start out wide over Firmino he needs rest anyways smh
Be patient , good game judge him after this month
trent can't cross klavan can't head pass nor has the confidence to drive the ball and force the issue everyone was way to stagnant and standing around at times all that being said this is my elf cup XI ward trent klavan lovren moreno- gini hendo ox-solanke coutinho firminho coutinho needs to play more forward until mane comes back
lets see what excuses KLOOP comes up with this time
Why, just why klopp disappointed on you,  stop moaning like mou we hit the post, we dominated, what fucking matters is the result and you here still not addressing defense issue and don't forget that simple mistake you made will cost you your job,  the defence will cost you losing your job
Lmao Klopp put Liverpool back in the champions league and this the thanks he gets foh
Everybody saying we need a new center back but IMO we also need a proper defensive mid too, even if we buy a good defender we will still make the same mistakes.
Strap in. Could be a long road. \n\nAn Arsenal sympathiser.
I don't know how can you enter the season with klavan, matib, Milner, moreno, lovren, the rest are trash. Does he really thought he's gonna win the league with this trash ass niggas come on man I can see you built the midfield and the front line well done on that but you are not interested in defenders. You need to steal some mourinho tactics. If this midgets on the front line face those tall and strong guys from Manchester believe me this guy is talking about improvements on nothing.
How can you put Klavan after all his bloopers in defense? Klopp are you blind? Stupid? Or corrupt may be players pay you bribe for gaming time?????????
klaven is useles and lovren in defence. kloop needs to put gomez in in central defence
Remember  spurs only managed a draw today. I bet we beat Leicester  next week .
FUCK LIVERPOOL
Fuck off you cunt Klopp.
Its your wrong doing\nNot signing defenders and DM. 18 months in and defence is worse. The issue against orgnized teams, do you go and buy a strong striker who can finish and bully defenders? No yiu waste 40 on ox the overrated Ibe\n\nCharisma buy you time. Fans like you, but same stupid mistakes for 18 months! Tick tock Mr deluded one
no mane no party
Lol Liverpool r sponsored by new balance... Fitting!
Love his wig.
Fuck Klavan
Looserpool
Fancy doing a swapsy for Koeman ?
DID WE MISS SADIO MANE TODAY?
Banners fsg out klopp out will fly soon
To all the people who don't understand how the transfer market panned out , \nKlopp didn't buy an CB because FSG put out a statement without the knowledge of klopp which inhibited klopp to go for his top target . \nNow sure we can bitch and moan we didn't get a plan B, but that plan B ain't giving us a chance to win a title so we've waited 20+ years already , instead of putting all that baggage unfairly on klopp with half a squad that isn't his players, maybe it's worth waiting an extra couple years and for once get top targets instead of settling for plan b ... social media has just given license to too many people who's impatience would've seen shankley sacked in this era... shame
HOW CAN LIVERPOOL FANS SUDDENLY TURN THEIR BACK ON THIS GUY ITS ONLY BEEN 5 GAMES REMEMBER BURNLEY BEAT CHELSEA, DREW TOTTENHAM .....STOP BEING PLASTIC FANS OTHERWISE IF KLOPP GOES IT WILL BE FURTHER DISASTER FOR YOU PEOPLE NO BETTER COACH IS AVAILAIBLE
Keita. Mane. Salah. Let the man build a team. Unless you want to sign another Welsh pirlo.
Don't worry lad's This German Clown we have as a Manager!! He probably put UseLess Lovren and Super Agent Alberto Moreno in team on Tuesday night against Leicester City typical from German Clown.
Haha you scrouse shit heads  cant even beat Burnley , Glory glory man United , Glory glory man United :)
ASK KLOPP THIS:\n\nJurgen, your title rivals beat you 5 - 0 and then you draw both your next games, one of them to so called inferior opposition...who will Liverpool beat next?\n\nThe world has no clue who we will beat and who we wont beat, can you give us a clue whats going on?
Gk- Mignolet\nRb- Clyne\nCb- Matip\nCb- Gomez\nLb- Robertson\nDm- Can\nCm- Lallana\nCm- Coutinho\nRf- Salah\nLf- Mane\nCf- Firmino\n\nPlay this team and we'll win! Just need our injured players back 😢
We are in Champion's League.  We have a team that has a chance to do something good.  Klopp is building a good team. He made a mistake not to get a good defender but we need to keep supporting.
Time 4 him 2 go
Klopp out wenger in
I'm a natural blonde, my fiance is brunette and our 3 kids are blonde, totally legit too.
He doesn't mention they all have blue eyes, that makes much more sense.  Two brown eyed people Danny and dead wife will not make three blue eyed children.  Hair color?  That is 1/8 two browns make a blonde, that is alot.  I win
i've got a better theory, the other guys die her hair to brown or brunette or whatever the shit was trend in that time, and also for not being confused with his bad brother.
I always though that his wife had blonde hair and that was his wife's brother so ACTUALLY their uncle
You didn't even point out that Jesse has dark hair, too, so Pam wasn't even coming in with a homozygous blonde gene, assuming she was a natural blonde in the first place, which given the extremely Greek family we meet later, is unlikely. \n\nAt least Becky was coming in with some white bread Nebraskan genes to explain the twins.
He wasn't UNCLE Joey, like... the wife's brother? Oh, he wasn't though, Uncle Jesse was the actual uncle... who didn't look anything like his sister.
I'm sorry, I couldn't keep up with the stupid quirky asshole-bit this guy is trying to pull, it's too distracting and the charade needs to die off YouTube.
DID YOU HAVE TO CURSE???
Yes, just a show, actors, etc...   BUT, most importantly, that is not how the math of genetics works.
Or....it’s just a show and joey is just there to help \nThe end
✂️👉🏼👍🏼
He went down on her in a theater
Well for one thing i call crap because you cannot base what the children will look like solely on the parents because recessive genes exist and for all we know the grand parents could have been blonde with light eyes and so on and so forth back to ancient times. When we see Danny's mom she has blonde hair so for all we know one girl could have inherited his recessive blonde gene and the others their mom's dominant blonde gene. just relying on the physical appearances of the parents is not scientific and very shameful
your mcm thinks this is deep
The mom is also supposed to be Jesse's sister. Jesse is Greek. Have you ever seen a blonde haired blue eyed mid western looking Greek girl with a little brother that has intense Greek features? That show has so many plot holes lol
So your Grandmother put a tv in the basement closet for you?
People think way to much in to things it's a dam show
I thought you meant Joey and Danny were dating
Jesse and Danny are obviously gay, and their wives are obvious beards.
Excuse me? Can you please leave?
This is a hypothesis, not theory
So he's the rightful heir to the iron throne
Huh. And here all this time I thought Joey was the mom's brother.
You know I actually thought of this a few years back but I was like nah joey wouldn't do that to Danny
so you think joey banged danny’s dead wife 3 separate times with several years in between each & each time resulted with her getting pregnant? ok.
Cmon seriously. Lol well guess what, some kids have dad's with dark hair and moms with blonde hair, and they come out blonde. There, That's my theory.
Or maybe all the kids were blond due to the fact that blondes are more appealing for television. Or also, who the fuck cares?!
It's just Joey.  Not Uncle Joey.
Wasn't Danny s wife joeys sister?
that was worth me not unsubscribing from you guys months ago.
plenty of brunette adults are blonde as children, in fact blondism is a decidedly juvenile genetic trait. ugh!
My dad had dark hair -- my mom light brown which darkened as she got old.\n\nAll four of us kids ended up with hair at various shades of brown -- no dark haired kids amongst us.\n\nYour theory is invalid. \n\nStop ruining people's childhoods.
Both my and my half-brother's dads are brunettes. We were both born with our mother's sandy blonde hair, while she herself comes from a brunette father and very light (practically white) blond- haired mother. Though to be fair mine has darkened as I've gotten older and now it's a shade where you could call it either dark blonde or light brown and it would be valid lol
My dad's hair is black and my brother and I have blonde hair so your move...
Genetics aren't that simple.   Depending on the parents of the dark haired parent, if one is blonde for example, the gene for blonde hair can be stronger.   Additionally, all 3 children are girls.   Remember that the man provides 1 X chromosome and 1 Y, whereas the woman provides 2 X, and the girls end up with 2 X's.   This means more of the woman's genes will be carried over.
I think it says more about TV executives favouring blonde children over children with other hair colours. The same is with Everybody Loves Raymond. Ray and his wife Deborah both have brown hair but all three of their kids have blonde hair. But unlike Full House, there's no uncle or friend that has blonde hair to suggest any infidelity going on.
to me, the truly _insane_ part of this, is you're paying your _rent_ doing this shit. get a _real_ job hippie. #sarcasm
Is that the horse from horsin' around?
so Joey doesn't want a relationship causes he's sleeping with all his best friends wife's, makes since, Joey's got secret game!
Unless both Joey and the dead wife have homozygous recessive alleles for blonde hair, there is still just as much of a chance that the theory is false.
Women love the funny guys
Jessies kids are probably blonde bc his wife could have been blonde but died her hair.
ha ha ha.... it's like you think they really exist and are the wet dream children of casting directors who prefer blonde kids.
such an idiotic theory with no evidence other than him being blonde. i watched this expecting him to go in depth with it, when he said that he was blonde i thought thats stupid. maybe this is just the surface level evidence but nope. that was the entire thing. next time, do more research, gather more evidence or don't make the video.
Or maybe Joey is actually the mom after transgender modification....🤔
I love how they finally gave clippy a show
IT'S A SHOW. CHILL OUT. DON'T RUIN THE SHOW BY GETTING SO PRECISE AND WITH DETAIL. THEY JUST HIRED RANDOM ACTORS AND PUT ON A GR8 SHOW 😂😂😂
just dont bring the twins back
Both my parents have brown hair and brown eyes. All 3 of my older sisters have dirty blonde hair with green eyes. \nI just destroyed this entire theory.
what if Danny and Jesse are sterile and joey only donated sperm? wouldn't that just strengthen their bond? i wonder if this even gets read...i never get feedback ...i never know if i'm on the ball or nuts.
This still makes more sense than the olsen twins disappearing altogether.
Please stop recycling the same crap from your articles that we've already read and bring back pop culture discussion
Passing over Saget for Coulier? Sure. Passing over Stamos for Coulier? No way. It's freaking Stamos. There is nothing about Coulier to suggest he is capable of that level of sexual prowess compared to Stamos and you oughta know better. Wait. You oughta know? YOU OUGHTA KNOW! OK, the theory in this video is 100 percent accurate.
The mom has blonde hair... and yes, both parents having blonde hair increases the chances of having blonde children, it also doesn't guarantee it.
https://youtu.be/rnJ4blc_S6g                   best I ever saw
Here me out... here me out, those kids are blonde and like... Joey is blonde. Coincidence?
Ironically enough, they give Joey 4 kids and a wife in Fuller House... Interesting
Obviously this guy doesn't know how genetics work.
Or they just happen to have hired blonde actors?
Why did i read this as insane crack house theory
i put on my headphones for this?!
The probability would be 50% for each child. They are independent on one another. Just because one was born with blonde hair does not mean the other has a lesser chance of being blonde
How about the blonde kids on Everybody loves Raymond?
You Oughtta Know
Wasn't Kimmy _also_ a blonde??
also, uncle jesses entire family had black hair. mom, dad, cousins, everyone. It's safe to assume that she probably dyed it blond, making the chances of them having three blond girls even statistically higher without a natural blond parent. \n\nI think this is an open and shut case.
This theory immediately falls apart because Joey is annoying af and no one wants to sleep with him.
its a fucking show with cast members that aren't related wtf
12.5% isn't astronomical odds, I have in many video games been crit 3 times in a row by someone with a 25% chance to crit.
It's.... all.... fictional.....
*MORON.. hey moron! Does it not occur to you Danny's WIFE was a blonde?!*
HOW LONG IS THIS SHIT VIDEO GONNA BE TRENDING?
I mean... not necessarily true. Just look at the Ballinger Family. Dark haired dad, light haired mom, all three kids are blonde.
Clickbait
omg its just a showwww
This is stupid as shit, making up fan stories on a fictitious show.
Ok, I have finally gotten the message....     I NEED TO GET A LIFE !!!!!!!!  🚲🚢🚙⚓⛵🎵🏈🎯⚽🎉🎉
Except Joey has brown hair.
Lol
LOL!
Stop it.
Fucking lie
rofl, get it joey
12.5% isn't that unlikely.
joey oughta know
Gladstones I bet!!! Am I right fellas?!
Wait...\n\nWHAT THE FUCK?
next series cramped house
Satire or weak argument?
This is fake
😦
Cut-It-Out.
DaAM
Joey is a playrrr
Jeez Cracked. Get a life
Great scott!
Blame the casting
Daym.. Joey gettin more pussay than a toilet seat!
That bastard!
did somebody say........................ wood?
clearly was told to do that. lil scummer like his dad
Like father, like son.
Hope saunders gets pezzled
Saunders is a clown the whole build up he's been acting like a jerk even his son is following his actions bad role model talented fighter but a turn off it's unnecessary no need to cross the line Main fight is GGG v Canelo
My respect for billy joe is over
That's so disrespectful.
Monroe handled himself well. Should have picked the little snot nose up and throw him on the stage! Bad parenting by Saunders.
That boy has a future with pitbulls and trailers.
Dirty pikey
I hope monroe knocks him clean out
well that's disgusting...
i'd kick that little mofo in the face
This shows what kind of father he is!?
Pleeeeaaassseee end his career Willie. That dude has no class, it was like he told his son to do that. smh wow
Horrible little pikey
Wicked lil devil child👺
I wonder where that autistic like behaviour came from? He didn't lick it from a stone.
Family of trash, if they didn't have money they deffo would have been living in runned downed council estate
Terrible head movement from Monroe.
wtf!!! Have to respect Monroe - Humble guy!
Scumbags
I hope saunders gets knocked tf out and his son sees it while crying
Anyone else here want to see GGG knock Saunders head clean off with his son in the front row watching?
Its pretty clear his son IS the school yard bully.
That was direct to Bell-End area and could have seriously hurt him! A strike to the Bertie Bassett or Cuthberts is bad enough but directly to the Bell-End area can cause serious damage. Very strange and weird how he smiles after doing it and walks off, meanwhile Billy doesn't seem remotely concerned he just assaulted a man by specifically targeting his Bell-End .
Props to Willie Monroe Jr for handling it with class.
that's a low blow
Tramp making his son do that
I didn't care who won this fight until now.  Hopefully Monroe demolishes this guy.
Pathetic, hopefully he gets KO in first
My grandma has more muscles than the guy on the left. WTF. Is this the fighter or did he jump on stage?
Go back to your caravan scumbags...
Man, I heard their was some major beef talk. But Munroe handled that with class, even munroe couldnt stop laughin. Great sport about it.
It's all for show people.
Al Jolson got beat the feck down!
Right in the shnazz
the wheels on his house go round and round
That was a distraction to pick pocket Willie
Obviously dad told him to or was cool with it seeing as he didn't react at all...
Kill him with fire!!
Background song?
LMAO!! 😂😂😂
Shocking parenting
This dude has anger issues tf
Prats family
justo en la tercer pierna
Good parenting, idiot. Trash stays trash
1 point deducted ....
Billy ya legend
Good parenting right there....
BAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
Pikeys
born loser...
Billy cold
Hahahaha! Nice work junior. :D
LMAO
Willie got punched in his willy!
useless father did nothing....trash
WTF The New Mcgregor ? ? ? ? LOL
Little British brat
Hope Monroe beats him
I hope Billy wins but respect to Willie for not reacting and telling his coach to cool off. Willie seems like a family man.
Protect yourself at all times
Lmao 😂
Hope Saunders schools him so all of his tin pot haters have an awful weekend.
The dad leered over, He told his son to do it I just know it!
sure that  Andre Ward isnt his father? SOG - Son of Groinpunch
that would have knocked Amir Khan out
Lol
Took it well
This is boxing, 2 big grown men, if a man cant take some bad words and and punch from a 7 year old then he's in the wrong sport,
Monroe is a bootch. He's allowed himself to be straight disrespected.  No lion in him.
That was one of funniest thing I've seen
Hahaha.Swinging hands at the speed ball.Great skills.
Look like another brother is about to beat down another Irish man despite being hit with a low-blow! 🤔
Stupid father stupid son
Erm what just happened there ??
Legend
dope
Oh come on people, that was the nuts! Watch billy junior circumnavigate the security. He tries a few times to squeeze through and on the third attempt....bingo! \nThat was great!
Akinfenwa is really honest and very Nice guy
Get Bendtner <3 !
I suspect EA do this on purpose to annoy him 😂
Akinfenwa   should be in the premier league for banter also he could hack it physically
The one guy who actually does his stats right
Give Akinfenwa a damm silver card already.
Bring back spencer what's all this spencer should be doing it!
Akinfenwa has the wide body kit attached
Akinfenwa seems like a nice guy and honest, not like the other footballers that just give themselves more than what they deserve
18 goals common m8 he deserves his stats
True Geordie vs Akinfenwa
rio, you best centre back on history
Akinfenwa should actually get a +70 card rating just for bants😂
Akinfenwa should get invited to the true Geordie podcast!!!
EA doesn't watch footie....It's a popularity competition
He should really punch those people behind the ratings
Where's Da Respect
Akinfenwas voice is way too squeaky for his size😂😂
wowowowow, this is spence his job
Tbh he is right...
Rio I am going to the Wembley cup and I really hope I meet you
Is Akinfenwa STILL a Bronze!? Are you serious EA!?!?
I would put 99 everything for myself
Looking at your predicted grades to your actual grades
arent u going to announce on ur channel that ur becoming a boxer
Awesome video. Criminal that he was downgraded I thought his own ratings were quite fair.
name of tune at star is sanpellegrino franki stew and harvey gun
The Fifa ratings are so stupid
Wayne Rooney just got banned for 2 years \nhttps://youtu.be/NQ3m5Ujm6Xc
He's my first signing on FIFA 18
THE TING GO SKRRRRRA\n KA KA KA KA \nSKIDI KI PA PA \nAND A DU DU DRRR\n 4:20
just stole Spencer's video
I have 0 faith in EA ratings lmao it sometimes feels like they just have a hat with ratings and pick a random one for players. It's like they don't even watch football. And they need to stop sucking ronaldo's dick. How are you going to give messi 93 and ronaldo 94. They should both be 94
He is right he should be a little bit better he said it himself this was one of his best season and didn't upgrade him
Akinfenwa: I came like a wrecking ball
He's actually right, deserves a boost to 65 overall maybe 66 with more finishing. Don't know what EA were thinking, did way better last season compared to the one before.
i love these new fifa rating videos please keep them coming 😍
It's great to have him as a proper face in Fifa
Get the card signed Rio and give it away
Akinfenwa still plays football and still bangs in goals? That's crazy.
how is he a beast If he only has 80 physical ?
He's a national treasure
UNITED fans can you please check my VLOG on my channel and leave a like even if I didn’t do a good job 🙏🏽 #GGMU
he should play as a defender .
I'm 6 ft 3 weigh around 78-80kg and I think I've got a chance in man marking akinfemwa out of a full 90 min game cmon ADEBAYO take the challenge pal
When will EA make this man a silver
Imagine his 95 Pro player card
Wtf wtf its not possible that he ia still 64 rated atleast give this man an 69 or 70 rated
Akinfenwa is the only player in fifa who's stats I wait the most
Everyone else is excited for gameplays and stuff when a new fifa comes out. I wait for the akinfenwa video
This is Spencer's job
I think they should give akinfenwa an 65 silver card, this man loves the game so much and really puts effort into his career, just upgrade this guy ea it is not gonna harm you in anyway, it wil be good for the community.
The man is a beast🔥
Akinfenwa is such a cool person
Rio ur an absolute legend for united
This is what spencer does
Who is this guy???
I love Rio but Spencer should have done this.
That 99 rating just for Eddie hall, you know if he randomly picked up football for 1 season.
What's the intro music lads
His rating should be higher
Bayo I wonder myself how EA make these ratings, feels so sloppy and ridiculous at times
I love your videos Rio. Nice one
BS
Adebao's on the road to Rio
4:30 Rio gets all ghetto
man Akinfenwa is annoying
Where is spencer???!!!
Hahaha NOOOOO RESPECT! Real talk though they mocked him.
Akinfenwa move to La Liga, Ligue 1 or Bundesliga and the EA will suddenly give him an 88 rating because they are anti-Premier League. We all know the FIFA rating is Bullshit. PSG and Bayern pay EA to give their players higher ratings. You saw in the Champions League Tottenham easily beat Dortmund yet in FIFA the Dortmund players have higher ratings. Thiago has a higher rating than Pogba when Pogba is a better player in real life. It is just Thiago plays against weak teams and players in the Bundesliga so looks more dominant. Fabregas is a better player than Thiago too.
should be 72
18 league 2 goals ...
18 goals 😲
C
Do Bendtner
No RESPEK, no CHILL
Akin.. Oh god hes so fuckin funny
These became unfunny 3 years ago
Lllllll
Akinfenwa doesn't drop shoulders he drops players
cheers rio was fun bro
3:11 TRIGGERED
0:48 FIFA Seva'ee :D
Haha he's joke
stealing spenny's content
Where the respect??
Bring back spencer
5-0
That's EA
So modest
poora kinfenwa
Justice for Akinfenwa!
Why no spencer
Xhaka Laca Boom
Oi Akinde is better than Akinfenwa
Everyone saying he seems nice and genuine in the comments, and I can honestly back that up. When he came to Grimsby with Wycombe, there was roughly 30 people waiting after the game for a photo and he didn't snub one person. Made sure everyone left with what they wanted and seemed genuinely happy to have a photo with fans! Really did differ to Edgar Davids who just ignored everyone who wanted a photo with him when he came with Barnet a few seasons ago.
Get Akinfenwa in the wembley cup
How is he 98 strength but 80 physical?
Akinfengwa is just fat not ripped
Akinfenwa sounds about 12 years old, what a joker.
PLEASE release this version on Apple Music
How's he find time for this with prepping for the champs league at the same time
1:20 She is soo cute
Be even better with stormy
Wish this was on Spotify
I want this to be officially released so I can buy this.
Better than the original
Taking it back to 1999
Hey, please check out some of the original songs I've written on my channel, and let me know what you think!
All the students ready to jump on his dick,he's sooo edgy,love him and his vibe and that thing he does,he's goat and all that other bollocks they do when hearing him
Stormzy = music for 14 year old white girls!
george the poet much?
This sounds so good😍😍😍
How disgusting is Tulisa's cover compared to this
Stormzy should die already. He just ruined a classic.
The more I listen to this, the more I love it
Is she singing for a bar of chocolate 🍫
Should get a release providing credit is given to the original artists too
😫💖💖💖I fell in love again
This has made my day. Song brings back so many good memories.
The singers are brilliant. His style of rap, maybe his accent just reminds me of googoogaga baby talk though...
Way to ruin the song. I don't rate stormy. Plenty more talented artists in the uk
WAVEEEEEYYYYY GET THIS ON APPLE MUSIC
Please put this on Spotify 🙏🙏
lol this video is so good!!!!!!
TRASH. Why ask artists to perform covers? LET THEM CHOOSE.

This is too good!
She's amazing, she's done some work with Shakka... look up shakkapellas
very calm! yes stormzy on a proper old skool garage flex
Would be pretty great if it were not for Stormzy
I need the lyrics!!
Omg I loved the original when I was small!!!! This is so nice to listen to tho, very chill! Good job to everyone x
Reminds me of back home 💜💜
No talent at all, he just talks, that's it
'Every time I touch the mic they say BO!'
The singers are AMAZING 😍

Awful, backing singers were the stars.
This is shit.\nShe's good, but he's crap.
Can't take British rap serious. How does this man make money from singing?
I love stormzy but he ruined this song. He destroyed a classic.
Awful. Absolutely destroyed it.
100% pure garbage
Game of Thrones will soon become the greatest fantasy franchise of all time, it will break all records, & when it is done, StarWars, Harry Potter & LOTR, will look nothing but mediocre!!!
Is it true that viserys narrated this?
Amazing Game of thrones Character's Sketches-\nhttps://youtu.be/8pXL_V8snMQ
House Martell held the deserts of Dorne, Probably because no one else wanted them\n\nOh but the Targaryen wanted them and they failed so much trying to conquer Dorne, even with their dragons and big army. \n\nUnbowed, unbent, unbroken.
It has been waiting for another one. :V

This is why we need the Prequels!!! PLEASE HBO!! T_T
I really wanna see a real life version of Maegor Targaryen!
Oh SHIT I just realized that I know the lore of Westeros better than the history of my own world 😂
PROSTITUTES ON THE STREET ★ Photo gallery \nhttps://youtu.be/dpVlcyFKxog
Ask Blizzard.. they make this clip match better! ;)
The static artworks are pretty cool, too bad the animated 3D parts look like a bad PS1 cutscene.\nNice video though.
Better than the seasons 6 & 7.
It is so poorly executed that it reminds me Mortal Kombat - The Journey begins (1995)
I like how even they themselves acknowledge that the show's depiction of Casterly Rock and Highgarden in Season 7 were colossal fails, by having them appear as completely different looking castles in this one, meanwhile the other castles shown retain their appearance from the TV series.
OMG we are going have incest 3 some YUK!!! as if incest was not gross enough.
who the hell still buys dvd's. they look like crap on current technology. DVD's are quite ancient now.
Lol, even the special features Casterly Rock looks nothing like the show's crap.
Haha, so many people would already know everything that will happen in this series.
Whose voice is it?
Meh... but, is this series canon now?
Anyone else want a narrative/lore like this on Rhaegar's p.o.v about what happened before/during Robert's rebellion?
If this is a possible spin off will there be animated rhaenys sex?
First, House Durrandon's sigil was a rampant stag with a crown, the crown was removed after the battle of the conquest, only to be added back by Robert after the rebellion. Second, The Martells din't rule Dorne because no one wanted the desert. Their full name is House Nymeros Martell of Sunspear, which indicateds their liniage back to Nymeria the Rhoynar queen who took Lord Mors Martell as her husband when she fled Rhyone after it was taken over by the Valyrians.  The Dornish are the only people to withstand the conquest of Aegon and his sisters, thus retaining their Prince/Princess status. Just because the show-runners don't have Indira Varma to show off, doesn't mean Dorne is a crap wasteland
Can someone subtitling it in Spanish?
Give credit to Harry Lloyd.
Is it possible that Aegon is the god of fire ?
weekly priority place changing french her alliance merely inspection
What songs are used in this video?
Let's be serious! Highgarden looks way better than in the show!
I want this animated series, please
Why have they released this now they normally Waite until the DVD comes out.
I can't wait to see the rest!
Aegon's Sister were hot.
They definitely have to make a prequel of GOT, oh please, please. Kind of like Harry Potter and Fantastic Beast AWTFT.
More likely, Aenar met with some mishap at court and chose exile over execution. \n\nYou literally just spoke of an empire built on wonder and marvel, dragons soaring in the sky, sorcery constructing cities of amazement, and you find visions improbable? Oh, Viserys. You lovable fool.
THANK YOU! AT LAST! PLEASE DO MORE!!!
I hope they are testing the waters for a full scale animated spin-off. Animation isn't cheap but with all the effects already put into GoT, I _imagine_ good animation can still be a lot cheaper than live action. That should open up for more creativity.
I just love Harry Lloyd's narration 😍 His reading of Dunk and Egg stories was just amazing
Hey sorry to be annoying but I just started my YouTube channel and if you could spare a little time to watch my first video about Game Of Thrones that would be great! \nVideo : https://youtu.be/kgIKYSAvlUA
now....hold on a sec... did i hear it right? even the dragons were burned? i thought Dany said fire cannot kill a dragon?
Am i the only one who wished that Peter Dinklage narrated this?  A few commentaries had his sass in the voice lol
Is that Harry Lloyd reading?
I got lost into this world and video so deeply it didn't feel like a 4 min video, more like 2. This was so good.
And this is why I love the Targaryens 💯
Is the narrator the guy who plays Viserys? It just really sounds like him.
So it's the rise and fall of the Roman Empire withe DRAGONS??? COOL!!!
Reminds me of the story of Atlantis.
It took my awhile to realise this is Viserys's voice. Damn
They could honestly make seven more seasons of prequels to the GoT stories exploring the rich history of the world that GRRM has built.
Well... That's look pretty ugly and not so fine about history. That pilot made by a fan was way better to be honest:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFDOdhVAJg
Thank you for this. I am a big fan of the show.
This is nice. I would say, though, that there's a slight detail with the information: the Targaryens didn't build Dragonstone, it was already there, as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold.
House Arryn held the Vale. Or Rather the Vale held them. His voice tho' <3

Anyone know who is narrating this? This is frickin' awesome. Combined with; what sounds like; Ramin Djawadi's music, I got goosebummps as soon as it started. OMG! I would #BeAllOver an *_ASoIaF_* animated series/movie/shorts, etc. Kudos, HBO.
I wish that Game Of Thrones was 3d animated series that would be awesome.
I'm in school now and I still have the majority of these things!!!!
Literally my life.
I'm doing homework 😂😂😂
4:20 me 😂
Still the same tbh
59k and trending????
What kind of schools do u guys go too! Never had these problems haha
The TV thing we used to get in year 2 in Italy lol
I'm only 14 and so many of these remind me of primary school it's actually ridiculous 😂
We had to get changed in the classroom in primary and I even thought it was weird when I was a child
I'm still in school now and it's the exact same
Most of the stuff on here are still in most the schools I have been to.
I'm at school now and I can relate to nearly all of these problems😂most of these were focused on primary school tho
There literally the same now aha
its the same now ahah
seriously schools are no different now
My school did the exact same with the whole 'new science block' but it's going to take so long that you're not actually going to see it and get any use from it🤔
Up here in Scotland, we interchanged in the classroom too! From P1 right through to P7. We would all get changed in the classroom at the same time until P4 or P5, when the rule then became the boys or girls would change first while the others waited outside the room, then switch.
so most of these are exactly my school but for the changing room..... till year 4 we all got changed in our class and then in yr 6 we done the same thing only that girls went it another classroom to get changed... cause years are split into 2 boys were in one to change and the girls in another. I'm currently in year 9 and since year 7 all boys get changed in the pic you showed xD
Jesus that reminds me of when I was at school
School Is pretty much exactly the same now
3:36 the textbook says 1D AF whoever wrote that. Same
I actually am watching this instead of writing an essay.
This was the most realatable thing I have ever watched
I'm in year 11 and that is the exact same as my primary and secondary school
we used to get changed in the classroom too!!
P.E. Lessons are the same you just get given one of those fuck off hard ass blue mats to DO forward FUCKING rolls on 😂😂
I just relived my childhood in a video 😂 and tbh schools haven't changed that much since 😂
Maybe it's an English thing
All of the ones u picked are exactly the same as my school now 😂
SO RELATABLE and I’m 13!!!
I'm in year ten and my primary school was so bad, it was literally all of these 😂
Im in year 12 now but this is sooooo relatable for me!x
At my primary school in Key stage 1 we all had to change for P.E in the class rooms and then in key stage 2 the boys had to change in the corridor and girls in class room 😂
My school is still like that now 😂
Yes my school was very similar. I guess that was just the way it was in the UK the past decades...
i'm in year 11 and that's still literallyy my school to the tee
Am I the only one that likes moremarcus better than the main channel
I had to change in the classroom for PE  up until year six. We had a changing room and all, just didn't use it for some reason.
I'm 14 and we still have all of that crap haha.
I'm in year 10 now and can confirm that school's are still exactly the same as this
School is the exact same now. Well mine is at least
Exactly like my high school which has now been knocked down and houses are now there
My school looks like hog warts it was built in 1677 but it's just a normal school, not a private school
We had to change for p.e in the classroom  up until year 6
This is literally primary school and I'm only 15 now
,y school is very so al
School is shit still lol
had to change like that in the classroom up until year 6 it was so awkward😂
Lol I'm 14 and the only thing that wasn't the same as yours was we have smart boards. We also got changed in classrooms until year 4 and then girls got changed in the cloakroom and boys in the classroom, so yeah primary school was shit😂
These things were only in my primary school, secondary school was much better
No in my old primary school which was 3 years ago exactly the same but now just in the small space of time everything has changed
The most relatable thing i have actually ever seen
I'm 13 and the majority of these things remind me of primary school so much 😂
We had to do changed in class room
Literally both my primary and secondary school. So funny looking back at it now 😂
Really wanna know what school Marcus went to
Schools are literally still like this
I'm in yr 7 I RELATE SO FUCKING MUCH
Is it just my school that lets you got out for lunch? Also in my primary everyone has to change together till like P6/Year 6  thinking about it now it's so weird😂
Im quite lucky i went to a good achool
Most of these things still happen now!!
I can relate to everything, my primary had everything on this list!! And I'm only in S4 (Year 11)
We used to throw wet paper towels at the windows or if the windows where open we would aim for the younger kids hahah
In my primary school all the boys and girls were in the same classroom getting dressed until the end of year 6😂😂There was no changing rooms😂😂
im 16 and i went to primary school from 2005- 2012 and then secondary school from 2012-2017 and my schools was exactly the same as this so things cant of changed that much cuz i could relate to every single thing on that list.
I moved to England and started year 10 here. My school was made last year and it's really good
These all still apply to school now lol
I'm watching this instead of homework
I'm in year 10 now bad this is sooooooo relatable 😂🙄
That first school is my school
its sad i'm only 15 and i can relate to all of these :D
i got changed in my classroom until year 5 - the girls hated it!
I'm watching this instead of homework 😂😂
So many reminded me of my primary school not even kidding
marcus, school in your day and school now are literally exactly the same.\n\nit's still shit
I was so nervous to watch this because of how much I used to dread school. 😥\nAnd Up to year 5 boys and girls changed together in the classroom 😵😳
At your big age you still making school vids run out of content then 🤷‍♀️
I actually am meant to be doing homework 😂😂
Marcus im In grade 8 and or history teacher still uses that projecter
when we went to the computer rooms to do mymaths but we didnt actually do anything😂
Its sad to see great youtube legends channel dying..but people like the Pauls Rise ..Smh
When I was in primary, I had to get changed in the class in front of everyone till year 6😩
He went to shoreham college, that’s my one lol
I'm 13 and my school practically has all of these!!
We go swimming and all get changed in the same room
Marcus I swear your old school is like mine now 😂 It is that 60's brick building and it is getting knocked down soon to be remade into a more modern school, but the younger years are like You'll miss out on seeing the new school building, you'll be out of school when it's been built! 😂
i'm in year 10 and literally all of these are relatable
School has not changed. Not. One. Bit.
I'm crying he thinks school is better now lmao dw I'm in 8th grade and I relate to like 99% of this video
no my school is so old there is nothing remotely modern in it at all. some classrooms still have black boards 💀\nBUT IT IS A GREAT SCHOOL AND I LOVE
Omg I'm 12 nearly 13 and most of them were literally my school 😂
2017 and my school is exactly the same 😩
The year 4 changing thing is true 😂
We still have all that crap now, blue mats and everything hahaha
i go to an all girl public school rated 5th best in the country and it's still as shit as the one down the road😂
it is not that different even now
Number 43 on trending like how????
Literally just had to go through all of this
Up into year 6 we had to get changed in the class room boys and girls behind a table 😂😭 most girls didn't wear bras 😭
The meaning of the song is so beautiful I want to cry but I can't
I got a vevo ad with falloutboys before this song to
Does the death of Pete Wentz count as fanservice at this point?
Most intense music video. Ever.
THE CREDITS I'M DYING XD
OOF IM iN lOvE wiTh tHiS sOng
Was I the only one expecting for the car light in the very beginning to shut off and out of no where the screen lights up and people start dancing or something? 😂
IVE BEEN LISTENING TO THIS SONG ON REPEAT SINCE IT CAME OUT! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!
Fall Out Boy: Releases this song\nMe: *dances aggressively*
I love this song, and the llamas make it 100 times better
Interesting...Wonder what they're trying to say by copying Kanye West's video for Flashing Lights?
This sounds so great!
Fall Out Boy Was Better Back Then,\n\nTake This To your Grave\nFrom under the cork tree\nInfinity On High!\n\nWat da heck happend to them?\n\nBring Back those good Old Dayzzzz
Those end credits though
I got a Fall Out Boy ad.....   What is life
My llama, I love this is song so much!
Hm.. I'm not a big fan of the new album tbh. This song isn't too bad but the others, paticularly Young and Menace really haven't been very good.
What the did they kill a man
*sees the first 2 minutes* lmao heavydirtysoul is that you
I can't believe they killed Pete. I knew it would happen eventually, but not by llama monsters
This is the music that I grew up with. This is a Rare Gem. Made me feel alive after a long long time.
Bruh. The credits.....\n\n\n\n\nHIS NAME IS JEFF
First time I heard this I thought it said the last of a dying meme
I think we all know who done the credits
You're gonna make me 🅱op my 🅱ussy
I don't understand the lamas this is the rly first song I've heard of them
Best song of Menace so far
why didn't the shovel have any blood though…?
this is some good. shit
i love the credits to this lmfao
Are you guys on drugs or what
Am I the only one who didn't understand a thing from what he saw, yet got addicted to the song?
I KNOW ALL THE LYRICS OFF BY HEART AND I LISTENED TO IT ABOUT 2000 TIMES SINCE IT CAME OUT<3<3<3<3
I don't know why or how, but these friggin llamas scare me more than anything else I've ever seen.
Oh, my God, I'm very much a fan of you guys since I was little, I'm Brazilian, my God, I love you, please call me, here the number 55 083 998550776
My screen got broken because of me pushing that like button a lot :D
The alpacas are taking over the world
Anyone else read the credits?  \nThat is why I love this band
ONE SECOND IN AND I ALREADY LOVE IT
To anyone complaining about this, especially if you consider yourself a fan, my mother is 56 and says you can go fuck yourselves because this is amazing.
But is anyone going to talk about the credits? \nBody removal by His name is Jeff\nStunts by Patrick's Hand \nI love these geniuses.
I don't normally like their more mainstream songs... but\nF U C K M E I N T H E A S S
We have some 2010 Dan Howell aesthetic right there
This song makes me feel some type of way Idk. O-O
and finally sink the yamatoo !!
ha I love the end credits \nHIS NAME IS JEFF
This is my jam, I love fall out boy so much. I used to listen to them 24/7 and I still listen to them often, I just can't let them go they are so good. Patrick's voice is one of my fav things ever like the way he sings just makes me so happy. The lyrics tho, they are always on point dark, honest and they stick with u. Like till this day I still hum centuries when I'm daydreaming. This new song is gonna be my go to song for so long now, i just know it. Thank u fall out boy for being so amazing.
After Young and Menace I expected a totally new and original/diverse album but the next singles has been more classic fall out boy with more electronic obviously. I hope there will be more Young and Menace-like songs in their new album
Been missing Young Blood Chronicles and got this instead... wishing there's no goat but...
Music industry puppet's
Loving this new vibe recently! Young and a menace is a complete banger and this looks like its gonna be big! Keep it up guys.
The lyrics of this is so fucking beautiful!!!!!
The shovel doesn't have blood on it???? maybe their fake blood budget was used up on the young blood chronicles
wtffffff is it with these mobile legends ad im dyiiing
i must say....one of the lamest videos ive seen in a loooooong time
I keep coming again and again.
FUCKING LOVE IT (and the credits are amazing)
2am and I can't fucking wait to blast this in the car and gym
I'm trying to get a fob ad and I keep getting food ads....
I don't if it's just me but I've heard on the last part of the chorus is You're just the last of the real bands.
The lamas at murderous and must be stoped #killthelamas
I dont know why but the older song of fallout boy was better...
I'm being Pete for holloween💀😂
BODY REMOVAL BY \nHIS NAME IS JEFF
Pete must have a fetish for llamas.
If Dan Howell, Brendon Urie, or Tyler Joseph isn't at least one of those Llamas, imma flip
I did not expect that even with the warning
pete in the boot looks like danny de vito
it's so lit, I unliked to like again *wow*
YAAAAAAWWWWWNNNNNNNNNNN.
CAAAAARRLLLL!!!!
WHAT A 🅱️OP

SO MUCH LLAMAS!
A spaghetti cat production
Oh my god YASSS
True
españolllllllll tonmala
NO EMPEROR KUZCO!
get high
Oh no! Fob sounds different than the early 2000s! Different is bad! You so called fans need to know that no album of Fall Out Boy will be the same. Get over the fact that they sound different than FUTCT or TTTYG. I know you heard it before, but I'll say it again, it's called evolution. They aren't a pop band, they are more like alternative/pop rock. Fall Out Boy like to experiment what they are capable of, let them do so. Stop wasting your time saying I miss old fob. Miss the old days? Go listen to their older albums so you can be happy.
I missed the old fall out boy 😟😧
Pete is the last of the real wentz
This is like a carbon copy of Kanye's video for Flashing Lights 👀
(First sec plays) me: BEAUTIFUL AMAZING TALENTED EVERYTHING I NEED AND BEAUTIFUL YAS BITCH THIS SONG IS A 🅱️op!!
Whos 🅱opping their 🅱ussy??
Song is good but not liking this video . Dude !! seriously what is these teddy bears ??
Does anyone else understanding this video, cause im lost for words! And i don;t really get it?
For muslin square and adorable covers, i recommand Aden and Anais.
Congratulations! If your back and pelvis keeps hurting you could try seeing an Osteopath who specialise in pregnancy. They can help with the discomfort you're experiencing as well as help prepare your body for labour. I know of a few in London if you need any recommendations
NOW THE BORN RICH GIRL HAS EVERYTHING.
So glad you are well. Are you doing kegal exercise? It really helped me have an easy labor. It strengthens your inner muscles
I hand-knit baby cardigans, I wish I could send you one! \nThis is my shop if by any chance you see this comment :) \nhttps://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/Lelws
Bonds are amazing. Love them, they are addicting though lol the patterns are so nice
You look amazing im so happy for you and mike i have a 2 yr old son and my only advice for you is to take advantage of every moment you can spend with your new bundle of joy. Have an amazing time with eachother now and oh i forgot sleep as much as possible
You look absolutely gorgeous 😘
Fleur you are glowing ✨
¸You look absolutely beautiful!

Bonds are amazing Fleur 💗💗💗. I spend so much money at Bonds here in Australia x
My belly button piercing was ok until about 27 weeks. I should have taken it out then but i waite until 29 weeks. The skin stretched too much and started to split upwards as well. Now I have two little stretch lines above my belly button , almost like a peace sign. It scarred terribly and i wish i'd taken it out sooner ! i would recommend taking it out eearly to prevent scar tissue - it'll be much easier in the long run if you want it re-pierced ! xxx
Yes you should take the ring out,your stretch marks will be pretty bad if you don't (i know stretch marks are normal of course but the ring will make it worse) :)
Really enjoyed this video and how happy and comfortable you seem being pregnant :) I'm not pregnant and don't have any kids but I still love watching these videos - the bit at the end where you were talking about finding like minded people is exactly why I like watching you! We're a similar age and at similar stages and I just find you so easy to watch :)
Ok I'm 21 and nowhere near ready to have a baby but I absolutely love these videos 😍 yourself and Mike will make the most adorable parents ❤️
You have wonderful taste for baby clothes and in general...useful video, thank you and good luck. You'll be a good mother and also your husband seems ready for this new adventure.
they make flexible bars for belly button piercings during pregnancy! they are a clear plastic bar that bends with your stomach and belly button xx
You look fantastic! Loving the belly updates, it's so much fun to watch baby grow.
Oh my god you look so so amazing and your bump is adorable! Made me a bit emotional 😍😍
With the belly piercing my cousin was pretty huge by the end of her pregnancy. She switched at about 5/6 months from a normal piercing into a rubbery almost feeling clear belly bar. They’re quite long and flexible. That worked perfectly for her and after birth she just put her normal one back in
I had mine pierced and it was very uncomfortable after about 6 month or so ,I decided to keep it on as much as I could but it left a scar ,good luck any way hopefully yours doesn't 💕
This is so exciting! Best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy, Fleur!
OMG the baby carrier is £250.00! I thought i might get one but slightly out of budget :-(
If you are having a baby shower add sleep saks to your registry or purchase it yourself . Some babies hate being swaddled . My son loved being swaddled in the hospital but once we got home he refused it .
You can buy bendy belly button bars to wear while you're pregnant x
Replace your existing belly button jewellery with a clear retainer belly pregnancy piercing bar. It's longer and very comfortable to wear. Very affordable to wear too.
Yay bonds are the best. We love them in Australia 💗
Look into a pregnancy belly ring. They exist. I bought a few for a friend when she was pregnant. They are life savors. Plus it will allow you to keep your home.
My Mum had her belly button pierced when she had my brother. She had looked into plastic/rubber bars that stretch with your bump and if you can get one then definitely get one, but in the end my Mum couldn't find one in time and her piercing was absolutely fine with it left in.
Firstly, you look fantastic! Secondly, I took my navel piercing out bc I was nervous that my baby would be super wiggly and rip it out.
I love that pretty pink jumper on you, the colour suits you. Your glowing by the way!! Love watching your pregnancy videos, it takes me back to when I was pregnant. It's the best feeling in the world when you see them for tbe first time on the ultrasound 💗
I had the same thing. You should go to the chiropractor. It did wonders for me!❤️
You are always beautiful but you look seriously radiant in this video!  I love the bump!  And I'm loving all of these videos.  Personally my husband and I have been talking about trying.  But I think a lot of us watch just because we are invested in your lives!  It is exciting to see you guys go from that first video with Mike to getting married and now becoming parents!  Thank you for sharing!  \n\nI giggled when you said 'I don't think I'll be showing my naked bump... 10 minutes later... here's my naked bump!!  \n\nOn a side note... I would love to have a way to send you something!  Or do a swap if you were interested... I am just a fat girl that really wants a crunchie bar!  :)  xo
Nursery is beautiful. They make special belly bars if you don't want to remove your piercing. They have loads on amazon normally called something like Flexible Pregnancy or Maternity Belly Bar.
I got my belly button pierced when I was 16. I took it out when I was about 23. I'm 33 now and it's still open. I've never been pregnant..
Hi Fleur I had my belly button pierced and had to take it out because your skin on your belly gets really tight. My piercing hole had heeled and closed through that time and I now have a little scar. Its all worth it in the end I got 2 beautiful little boys☺️
You are absolutely glowing! And the bump is beautiful! Make as much baby related content as you want, we are eating it up 😄 Enjoy this time of your life beautiful lady!
You can buy pregnancy belly button jewelry that's what I would do
Every bump is different with my first I had a flexi bar with my second too painful too big so had to take it out and healed you look beautiful and glowing xxx
I love ure videos fleur and your baby bump looks fab! X
Love your fingernails color. What is brand/color is it?
As a mother of 3 fully grown and healthy children/now adults, I can tell you try not to be shy about your bump.  You are simple put...divine!  Enjoy this time.  I read a quote once:  Mother is the name of God in the hearts of children.  Let it carry you through.  Blessed Be!
Bioflex belly bars. They're really flexible and plastic so you won't react badly and they're also in loads of different sizes in case the hole stretches and you need to gauge up or you need a longer one etc. You can get cute designs and stuff but if you just need a retainer they do clear plastic retainers as well! Good luck with your baby! Xx
My recommendation is that you purchase a pregnancy belly button bar. I took mine out while pregnant, and it grew up, and the holes stretched out terribly.
As the Mom of a 2 month old and a 2 year old do whatever you feel is right for your baby. My sons both had full wardrobes of newborn size including shoes and I've used them! I used a crib bumper *gasp* :) and my first son wasn't 100% breastfed, I did formula as well bc that's what worked for him... I could go on and on. Just do what works for your family and don't worry about what others think. Good luck 😊
I've really enjoyed watching your videos generally over the years and especially your pregnancy videos. Don't worry about your channel content changing as you go through your pregnancy ... its obvious and frankly fun as a Mom of three myself to watch your excitement. Love the colour of your sweater on you.
Hi Fleur, I had my belly button pierced and had the same questions when I got pregnant. I actually didn't have a forum like this to ask peoples advice so I just took mine out later in pregnancy so people couldn't see the ring under my clothes. I chose not to put the ring back in after my daughter was born but have to warn you that 11 years later I still have a scar which looks like a hole. Not that I mind, but just in case you are worried about that.
How sweet everything is !! You are glowing Fleur :)
@fleurdeforce Looking radiant Fleur! Belly button piercing while pregnant can be tricky, I would highly recommend removing it earlier rather than later the skin around it will stretch as is expands. You should be able to put it back after the pregnancy with no problem. Gros bisous
Wow, looking fabulous, I think pregnancy suits you and thank you for sharing your bare belly!! Great vid :) boy the dogs are going to have a rude awakening....
You look lovely!Such a cute nursery and you look stunning!I am 28 weeks currently and we are expecting a baby boy.I am so excited for you and Mike and really enjoy all this pregnancy vlogs!
I had my belly bar out for over 3 years and couldn't even see where it had been pierced when I got pregnant.  Now I have a huge brown scar where my belly stretched it, and it never disappeared again. 😔
Fleur - you are positively glowing. You're so so pretty and you suit pregnancy so much. Again, like other people have commented, I have no interest in being a mom but I am living for your baby vlogs and updates. Take care of yourself lovely x
You look amazing Fleur and the nursery looks lovely, you have a very lucky baby! I love watching these vlogs, I have two girls now 8 and 11 but still love watching these and remembering the excitement of having a baby! Xxx
Hi Fleur, loving the baby bump, you look lovely. My belly button is pierced and I used one of those little twist type bars (spiral) and it didn't pull at all until right to the end. I took it out about a month before and then just pushed a bar through each day and took it right out. After the baby was born I put my belly bar back in as normal. Would totally recommend the spiral bars for comfort (although not the most pretty). Xx
You're so beautiful!! Thank you for sharing!!
what lipstick you use in this vedio？
omg, the jumper, the lip, i was literally shocked when i clicked the video open!!! you are so pretty !!!!!
The piercing... My friend took her piecing out and put a length of fishing line in and tied beads on both ends. Totally flexible and bump grows around it
Belly button ring...Yes it marks!! And it grows back so fast. You will have to get it re-pierced!! Ugh, I hate getting my belly button pierced-again }: lol... advice from a mom of three- time goes by so fast, so fast- enjoy EVERY SINGLE SECOND, even the hard stuff. x
I have successfully kept 2 kids alive ;)  The biggest recommendation I give every new mom (or the gift if you're my friend) is a book by Gary Ezzo - On Becoming Babywise: Giving Your Infant the Gift of Nighttime Sleep - It helped us all sleep through the night and have proper food intake.  IT WORKS - the advise in this book is the best! It's still available on Amazon.   Congrats
I left mine in  a bit too long. I DIdn't take it out when i really began to show around 7 months. I got a bit of a stretch mark ... thankfully it went away after my son was born. I left it out till he was almost 1 and it went back in just fine! Obviously you don't have to wait that long i just forgot about it till then.
That's what I've used http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Flexible-Pregnancy-Maternity-Belly-Bars-Clear-Ends-/171798408693?epid=1131803126&hash=item27fffbadf5:g:iFAAAOxybetR9U0I
Hi Fleur! I am also 23 weeks! I wonder if we have the same due date! I am due on January 13th... when are you due?
Hi fleur, just wanted to comment, be cause you look amazing, so please don't feel self conscious. I Have had two babies and have my belly pierced. I got one of those plastic belly ring and started wearing it from about 20 weeks. My piercing hasn't stretched also it didn't chafe or get irritated at all. It was quite comfy really. Also just wanted to say that not everyone gets that line of hair on their bump. I didn't anyway. So glad you are enjoying your pregnancy now. You are positively glowing!!! Xxxx
I just thought, you can buy pregnancy belly button rings so that might be something worth looking into :)
I had a belly button piercing for my 1st pregnancy.  I kept the ring in, until it started to annoy me and irritate my skin and then I took it out.  I put it back in a little bit after the baby was born and didn't have any issues with it closing up, scarring or causing any extra stretching.  I think it all depends on your skin, so if it looks like it's causing an issue, maybe take it out sooner than later.  Good luck!!
Fleur, Have you ever heard of KT tape? I have a bad back and my baby was sitting really low in my pelvis as it was was aching really badly during the final trimester. I put KT tape on and the discomfort was hardly noticeable. When I took it off I could feel it again! You can put the tape on your belly to lift the weight off your pelvis and or your back. \n\nI also had my belly button pierced. I took it out when it started to catch on my clothes. I would put it back in occasionally to make sure it didn't close. After I had my son I put it back in.  But i noticed when I was breastfeeding my son would lean against me it would make indentations on his body from where he was resting. The skin definitely stretched so I took it out and am waiting for my belly skin to return to normal and to lose some weight before I put it back in again.
So excited for you Fleur! You are glowing. Your bump looks so cute. When I was pregnant only used coconut oil on my bump and drank lots of water and ate healthy and I have no stretch marks at all. I was massive ( gained about 30kg haha ) so my advice is keep well hydrated and healthy from the inside and moisturise from the outside. ( I haven't got piercing tho)  \nSending lots of love xx
I loved the video althoug I am just eighteen years old and not ready to have kids for a very long time...by the way: you looked gorgeous in the video!
I took mine out and left it out....  I was scared it would tear my skin.
Fleur, I for some reason have no maternal instinct whatsoever, I think mine has been directed into loving dogs more than babies.....I know, I can't help it!!  HOWEVER.....you are the first and only YouTuber that I am genuinely happy to watch throughout your pregnancy and so very pleased for you!!!!   xxx
I'm honestly super duper excited about #babyDeForce and thank you for letting us be a part of this!! These videos are so much fun to watch (don't get me wrong, I do also love your other videos) and I can't wait for more happy videos! I wish you guys all the best from Belgium :)
I've had 2 babies, had my belly pierced when I was 16. When I had my 1st pregnancy I intended to keep my piercing in for as long as possible but I quickly becomes really uncomfortable. I took mine out, and now have a big v shaped stretch mark coming out of it. I intended to put it back in / get it re pierced but to be honest I don't ever get my tummy out any more, so don't really feel the need to have it done again! Someone I know tried a maternity bar but found it just as uncomfortable as having their normal one in when they got much bigger, so took it out
This video was totally adorable! The nursery looks so great so far!
You can get special bars for during pregnancy, they r really long fleur. I work in shop that used to sell them x
You're super beautiful Fleur! Enjoy your pregnancy! I loved every minute and now my bubba is 2! X
You are so beautiful! I have never seen an expectant mom glow as much as you. Thanks for sharing this joy filled journey with us. It has been 17 years since my last baby, 22 since my first (!) was born and all the memories come rushing back to me as I'm watching you. I also adore your non-traditional choice for clothing and nursery colors. So stunning.
For the belly button piercing you can get a flexible rod, and after your belly has gone back to normal u can wear fun piercings again. Good luck :)
You seem SO happy it's lovely to watch! ❤️ Love the colour scheme you've picked for your nursery. I took out my belly button piercing before my bump got very big and it has left a scar now, but I'm sure that would have happened anyway! I'm contemplating whether to get it pierced again to try and cover up the damage 😂
I had my little prince 5 weeks ago and since the first day Ewan the Dreamsheep has been an absolute favorite! I would highly recomend getting something that makes these whitenoise/womb sounds. And don't only prepare for the birth but for the time afterwards(breastfeeding, baby care etc) 😊
Hey Fleur! I have my belly button pierced and had a baby 2 years ago, and managed to save it without getting any stretch marks by using a long flexible bar until the very last weeks, when my belly button popped out (I went on a week past due date...). As soon as it felt uncomfortable I took the bar out, and spent the last 3 weeks without anything, then put the flexible bar back after I went back from the hospital, then a regular piercing banana when my tummy looked okay for it (and damn it felt good !!!) I hope it helps, and I wish you a wonderful end of pregnancy, smooth birth, and a great mom life. Love !!!
The chair you were sitting in cost £1055.  :0 I want thwe chair but I can't afford that ;(
Not sure if someone has already commented this... But you can buy maternity belly bars. They are basically much longer and often plastic so they are much softer. My step mom wore one in both her pregnancies and it worked great for her. I think they're pretty cheap online x
You can get pregnancy belly bars.
Hi Fleur, when a friend of mine was pregnant, she was also worried about her bellybutton piercing. She found one of those really long flexible bars and moisturised the area with coconut oil to stop the scarring/stretching, and she had no problems whatsoever!
I'm 34 weeks now and at our 4D scan our baby girl had her arm over her face too!!
I just took my piercing out once it became uncomfortable. It's unlikely it'll close over in 3months xx
Hi fleur, I took my belly button piercing out while I was pregnant because I was scared it would split! I had it re pierced after I had my baby but the piercer told me that there was no need to of taken it out as it would of been fine. So I think it's down to personal preference and how it feels as you bump grows. Hope that was helpful xxx
Where are the black and white musslin cloths from?
You look so wonderful!! We love watching YOU, not just for the content, but because it's you! You can put anything up and I'd still watch it! ❤️🇧🇷
For your hip, get those round big balls and do some hip stretches on them.
you seriously look so good being pregnant fleur! : )only a few months away till the day your baby comes into the world, eeek! : ) i still predict she'll come either on christmas eve or christmas day, just saying : )
I would take the piercing out now. The whole is already actually going to be expanding a bit. Nothing bad, but you'll just end up with a slightly more obvious whole afterwards if you leave it in any longer.

Ridley's First Film With TriStar Pictures
omg is this about gigi gorgeous's girlfriends family ?
is that a true story?
Song:  Zombies - Time of the season
now THIS is a movie I'd watch!
Nice to see Wahlberg playing an actual character.
Mr. Getty is NOT NEAR AS RICH as todays ballers on Instagram. If he was he would have taken pictures of his food.
True godliness with contentment is itself great wealth. After all, we brought nothing with us when we came into the world, and we can’t take anything with us when we leave it. So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content. But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows. \n1 Timothy 6-10
I'm not a Getty. I just married one.
WOW looks awesome..
Lizard people
This is the best film trailer that I've seen in a while, and the music is fire 🔥
Ridley scott has awaken again
Song name?
What song is it ?
This movie is a fucking lie. The richest being in the history of the world is Mansa Musa of Mali a black west African man.
ms. spaghetti ms. spaghetti
Yep. Pay one ransom. It will happen again. People forget that. jrichardsingleton.blogspot.com
jesus christ, mark wahlberg is fucking everywhere these days. hes like the new rock
There's no fucking way that's Kevin Spacey! He looks so different!!!
What's with these trailers that got these fast highlights at the beginning? It's fucking retarded man.
We've pretty much just watched the whole story throughout the movie, thanks trailer!
PLEASE ENABLE CAPTIONS/SUBTITLES FOR BETTER AUDIO/VIDEO VIEWING UPDATE:Thank you so much everyone for viewing. if you enjoy my new beat smah the like button and share on social media a few times for me. https://youtu.be/liIjwh85jk0
At first, when the narrator in the beginning said, It's like we're from another planet. I thought it was a movie about the rothschilds. And I thought, the reptilian CGI, better be impeccable!!! But still COOL TRAILER, definitely give a watch!
Finally, something with a descent story line.
simply they told us all the story
whats the name of this song playing during the trailer????
i felt like i watched the whole movie...imagine the last scene of the trailer is the ending ...nothing  -plot twist!
i love watching people with more money than me buy stuff i'll\ntake 83 tickets

Kevin spacey is going to sue this studio, they put a random old dude and put his name in the trailer. lol

I like how everyone changed their accent but mark
First thing I thought of was Gettysburg.
Rothschilds have all the money but their net worth is unpublished
Lamorris Walker on Facebook is the next best actor rising
Be quiet about your wealth and avoid these situations.
The song in the beginning is called time of the season by Zombies
I didn't even recognize Spacey until they said it was him!
the boy who was kidnapped planned the whole thing
Will watch this movie for Kevin Spacey! <3
This trailer looks like crap to be honest. Walhberg or Mr Rich is the mastermind behind this kidnapping... as to what happens in between is neither here nor there.
Prob going to see this in theater
The trailer does an amazing job of making you want to know what happens in the movie.\nI don't really watch movies much at all, but this is one I might actually go see.\nHe says he'd pay nothing to get his grandson back, so I need to know by what means he gets his grandson back, if at all.\n\nWell played Sony
Is that Tom Cruise narrating this trailer?  Sure sounds like him to me.
That's how Donald trump will say if his grandson got kidnap 😩 How much money will you release to your grandson nothing 👏
I should've became an actor! U know what....I think I'll focus on becoming one. Headed to central casting!!
Anyone know the song?
WOW AMAZING STORY. I hope Michelle gets an Oscar or something for this role. She looks amazing.
Maybe ya'll will now get an idea how easily it will be for the jew IlluminAti to throw those who follow them under the bus.
topher grace from that 70's show is that you?
It seems like they gave away too much now. Mark may find a way to get Getty's son back?
At 1:15 they say the title of the movie.👍
saw this as an ad, and I just had to see it again.
Looked like a good film, then mark whalburg showed up
well since its sony i bet 500$ IT WILL FAIL AT THE BOX OFFICE
Lol I got 20$ on my pocket😁
I've lost all faith in Ridley.
17 million is pocket change when it comes to the actual wealthy
Wahlberg always has that same WTF is happening expression on promotional stills. 😨😱😵
Did they remix part of the original Zombies - Time of the Season just for this trailer or is there a full version of the remix?
Looks good, i like the remix of the song.
I would build a USS Enterprise - How about you ?
They kinda told the story in the trailer.
What? They manage to kidnap the grandson of the richest man in the history of humanity and ask for 17 million? Yeah that's a lot but c'mon might as well as for a few billion dumbass
I saw mark whalburg in the thumbnail I was like oh no everyone shut up ima watch this
MONEY      !               MONEY        !                 MONEY         !
; This motion-picture does a great disservice to J. Paul Getty, and, obviously, what else can one expect from liberal, anti-Capitalist, nin-com-poops?\n\nAs someone who was a young adult during this time, and watched it happen on television, and in the news-papers, J. Paul Getty couldn't pay the ransom, ( Although, later, he did pay a portion of the ransom money. ), because it would put any other of his family members at risk for kidnapping, or worse forms of extortion, i.e., Criminals are never satisfied, and will repeat the same stupidity, because criminals are insane.
If I didn't know better I would've thought that man was an old Bruce wayne in a live action film.
They are all entitled to NOTHING!
We [the super rich] look like you but we're not like you is a profound statement
Mark Wahlberg is Mr Propaganda at the moment. Boston Bombing CHECK. Gulf Oil Disaster CHECK. Improving the image of Billionaire businessmen CHECK. What's next scumbag
I really hate the few seconds of preview for the trailer in the beginning. I DONT NEED A PREVIEW OF A TRAILER DUMBASS
The kid is released six months after being kidnapped by some italian mafia. The kid goes to new york and becomes a heroin addict. He dies at 54. Boom saved you from another mark walhberg movie.

Kimmich the assist man!
Wait robben has a right foot?
I saw Rudy's attempt live on T.V. and I was in shock. If that would have gone in, it would have been one of the best goals this season...
Coman has so so so much potential! \nIm glad we are back to winning ways.  \nAlso nice to see other teams putting up a fight,  makes the league interesting.  (:
Rudy's volley would've been spectacular
3 assists from Kimmich!
Adler conceding vs Bayern: better love story than Twilight
Ancelotti has to imprive the defense. He has 3 of the best 5 CD in the world with Hummels, Boateng and Martinez. But Ancelotti is not able to stabalize the defense. Sometimes the defense is just terrible. Thiago is not a good 6 he is a better 10 because he does not win many tackles. Ancelotti has not found the best 11 just yet and has to improve the defense.
Y James ? 😂😂
he does have a right foot
Bayern wins the champions league don't @ me bruh!
rudy deserves starting xi .
Rudy was a great find by Bayern. Hummels on the other hand is overrated. Keeps giving the ball away and his pace is so lacking he can't catch up

Muller = Deflection specialist.
Who else missed her Vlogs?!
Thank you Lancome for supporting our lovely Estee <3 Great colaboration
Estée I was smiling ear to ear when you interviewed Lupita! Like my cheeks are hurting because I'm so delighted for you - it's such a cool opportunity. Lupita has such poise and grace so I can't wait to see the video on Lâncome's UK channel. Love that bit about the camera being as tired as you - legit lolled. So much love, keep killing it Estée! 💜 x
Do you ever just pinch yourself and think how did I get here?.  Couldn't happen to a nicer, more genuine person.  ❤️
Yaaaay, you went to The Butchers Daughter! That was the place I recommended when you asked about turmeric latte, I hope it was delicious!
forever hoping my greyhound and I run into you one day <3
That was so cool! You did a wonderful job.
Both of my doggies just passed away so thank you Estee for posting a video today to make me feel less alone <3
Missed your vlogs so much 💖
Every time I watch your vlogs, I am always reminded how humble and funny you are. This video is the perfect reason why you're my role model. Even though you've accomplished so much, you're always so honest. I appreciate seeing the behind the scenes of everything you do. Thanks for always staying classy yet sassy 😘 xx
Omg, Estee!! I think I might've seen you when you were in NYC, because I remember seeing those Greyhounds as well! And I think I drop off tickets at the hotel you stayed at ALL the time if you were at the one I think you were at.. (I work for a Broadway ticketing agency in NYC so I go to a bunch of hotels everyday).  Wow, small world and I really hate myself for not paying more attention now! Hope you had a good time here. Next time if you're in that same area, if you like dim sum go to Nom Wah Tea Parlor. Their pork buns will change your LIFE.
Estée! Seeing your cute Reggie boy over the years inspired me to get a greyhound too! I now have a black greyhound named Ollie and he's the love of my life!
Estee gets to meet Lupeta!! OMG I want to be Estee now
More vlog,it is amazing!!!
love your vlogs!!
wagwan 🅿️engting u r 🔥🔥🔥 hmu w ur bbm pin B😍

Lupita!!!! Wow well done Estée absolutely amazing
Lupita is everything goals, but those arms 😍 #armsgoals
Lupita is so lovely
My two faves 😩😍
Black top, green trousers: dapper kim possible!!!!
Hello! I'm yet another proud Brindle Greyhound mumma who fell in love with greyhounds through you, Aslan and of course the ever so handsome Reggie. I remember always being so obsessed whenever Reggie would appear in videos/blogposts/instagrams, but what I remember most vividly is when I finished Bloom on a flight back to my home here in Melbourne, I just kept thinking that I knew I needed to adopt a grey. Best decision I've ever made and my beautiful baby Sydney is the absolute light of my anxiety-filled life! She's on her way to becoming a social media star over on instagram (@doggosydney) and I just know that she is just as grateful as I am for you guys showing us the wonderful nature of greyhounds <3 xx
So beautiful! My ideal woman!😍❤️
I paused doing yoga momentarily to admire those greyhounds because OH MY LORDY, THEY WERE SO STUNNING 😍😍
I dont think I have ever seen donuts look so good like damn!
How exciting! I love your vlogs!
I'm so happy for you Estée!

Love it, Estee! You do such a great job on these interviews. 😊
Oh Lupita is such a nice person! Glad that you have had a chance to talk to her, the interview went really well! Good job Estée! :)
since today i am following you again. i unfollowed you about two years ago because i did not like your then- vibe that seemed to me a bit narcissistic. now you are obviously so centered, relaxed and good in your skin. i appreciate your grown up approach to your channel and the responsibility that you are willing to take and to use. plus that i believe that aslan stimulates your creativity which i think is so special. congrats estee, thank you, looking forward following you. hugs from switzerland.
OMG she is just so beautiful, even the way she speaks is just mythical, love love love Lupita!! <3
How exciting, Estee!  You ROCKED it!!!  XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA!
Lupita is beyond gorgeous! Also i loved your outfit with the mango trousers x
Thank you for being so transparent and showing your Lancome guides. There is some times so much inauthenticity in blogging and it is refreshing to watch your videos. ❤️❤️❤️
I love those green trousers!
wow such a fantastic opportunity to interview Lupita, she is a fantastic woman! Thanks for sharing this with us Estee, another superb vlog!
OH ESTEE My world is complete again seeing you vlog! They are my partner and I's favourite thing in the world :)
So happy to see an estee vlog in my sub box x loved it x
I miss New York so much love the vlog
I love your blogs more than chocolate... and that is saying something! The reason is definitely just how lovely and classy you are Estee! You are calming, funny and just a joy to watch 😃🤗.
Ummm... Is there any better way to see NYC in one day than spending it meeting the fabulous Lupita??!! She seems so lovely - what a wonderful opportunity!! I absolutely love the black heels you wore at the end! They showcase toe cleavage so chicly!! The doughnuts also looked like they were amazing!! What a wonderful vlog - gracias!

Hi Estée have u lost weight recently ? Probably because we haven't seen u much on YouTube looks like u have
Estee please be safe in London since Theresa May called for martial law. Cray!
Yasss Estée 💕🙌🏼 killing it like always, and you did great on the interview ✨
Omg I remember when you and Claire got those dough doughnuts way back when! I'm so excited to watch the interview with Lupita too, I can tell you killed that interview :)
Thanks for making videos!! Love the vlogs!! Wide angle lens is making me ill. Why so wide?
Lupita is effing beautiful and seems like a cool person!
Ohhh I have to share this after watching the interview! I'm a nurse and 99% of the time on my shifts I wear barely any makeup. Mostly because of the hospital, i just feel gross with it, but also because it somehow just gets all over my face by the end of the shift. My coworker, on the hand, is just how Lupita describes herself - wearing all sorts of lipsticks based on what she feels like that day. My coworker will wear anything from a dark red to a bright plum. And somehow it stays put all day! I really don't know how she does it!
We actually started the process of getting a greyhound a while back (inspired by Reggie of course!) but they wouldn't let us because I have a young daughter 😭😭😭
Psst the original Dough is in Brooklyn ... I think it's better, cooler at least! Donuts opposite the projects.
That Sephora and Dough Donut shop is literally across the street from my job ☺️ how cool would it have been to run into you!! 😊
Are you employed by Lancôme?? I love your sense of style!
Well, I'm sure the trip was worth it! 😉😃
What camera do you use for vloging!? the video quality is amazing!!! love everything you do:)
Lupita is such an amazing human being and so goregous
The 'h' in horchata is silent 😉 the donuts look too good. So delicious
Great video, Estée, and it's good to see you back! An FYI: if you're ever feeling like you need a bit of home comfort, there's a Canadian selling poutine, the real McCoy, on Brick Lane at a food stand. My daughter went and she said it's authentic! 💕
Thank you for your video.
estée you looked really hot in that evening outfit!💕
Ohh lady, I'm so happy for you! This was amazing! ☺️
On first name bases with oscar winners ! Well done !
So, so, so, SO good to have you back!!!
You did an awesome job interviewing Lupita! What an honor to meet her; she looked stunning! Both of you make great ambassadors for Lancôme. Thanks for sharing NYC with us, even if only a few hours. ❤️
loved this video! keep it up estée! <3 <3
Love the Church's Estee, my parents' family business is selling English handmade shoes (repairing them is the family tradition really, a family tree of shoe repairers!) and we also sell Barkers which have some pretty colourful ones out atm for ladies and gents, just thought you might like to browse their ladies collection too :) loooong time fan of your videos, love them! xx
Your vlogs are the best! I found myself smiling throughout the video :)
wow you two are so beautiful!! Love you ♥
You have such an attractive way talking with people, I feel like I could hear you talk with me all day! Beautiful vlog tho 💖💛
Awwww...I missed this, whoop! PS: That leather skirt is hawt on you whoa, Lady!
It's true every time I see Estée interview people in her vlogs she does such an amazing job! Ps those donuts looked amazingggg 🍩
So good to have you back, I've come home😊
I was just reading Bloom and saw that you uploaded! Love you and your amazing videos Estee!
You are frickin glowing in the first clip!!!
Looks like you jumped out of a 50s men's clothing commercial. Super groovy.
Aaah never been to New York,but thanks to Claire Marshall Doug doughnuts is definitely a place I need to visit if I am ever there! Loved coming along to this city with you :)) x
I went to Dough when I lived in NY because of you and now seeing you going there in the vlog made me so happy!!
Aww Estée, I saw a post on one of the Greyhound Facebook groups I follow about a lady meeting you in NYC with her doggies, it caused quite the stir in our little group, everyone was so excited! My boyfriend and I adopted our greyhound Ash because we fell in love with Reggie, it was the best decision we've ever made, they are such gorgeous sweet gentle dogs, truly magical characters with the biggest hearts :) Thank you for all you do to raise awareness of team pointy, I'm sure there are loads of other people like myself who adopted a greyhound after seeing Reggie, you're doing a fab job at spreading the word about how awesome these doggies are.  xxx
I understand why you've stopped uploading videos lately but that has made me realise how much I enjoy watching your videos. Thank you for doing your job with happiness and positivity , you deserve the best. :)
You're look at the beginning is very Elaine from Seinfeld 👍👍
Gosh Lupita is like a godess, and that deep voice... daaamn
I think your style was kinda granny :P
Estee - where are your blue earrings from? I love them!
Estée! You also inspired me to rescue a greyhound as we unfortunately still have greyhound racing here in Sydney :(
That leather skirt tho. <3
I would be nervous too, she looks like the darkness within
coming to stalk you in my robe soon, miss u already
Total Shit,neanderthls need to die from cancer quicker!
Am I the only person who's never heard of Lupita?
Loved this so much. Estee you are the REALEST. Thank you for that xx
Hahaha poor sleepy, insane estee
Next time you're in NYC you should try The Doughnut Project. SO GOOOOD. I love Dough so much as well, but the Doughtnut Project might be my number one pick in New York. I'm drooling.
Doggies!!! i'm the same when it comes to beagles :)))
gurl, you could've used a better lighting!!!!!
Don't worry London mayor khan will just say this is all normal events in a city...
Oh no!!! More terrorist attacks on our homeland!!! Better bring in more refugees!!!
Its sad people don't know we are the ones that brought this upon ourselves\nWe destroyed the middle east and destabilized it and fueled a extremist ideology. But hey people rather just blame others for a complicated problem than rather actually doing anything to fix the root of it.\nIgnorance is a bliss.
Religion of peace is so peaceful!
Theresa May might as well join the Labor Socialist Party. She is a cowardly panderer and a traitor to the real British People.\nMeanwhile the Hilary like mayor of London, Khan, sounds like Hilary saying 'we will not be divided'. Your Country is already divided you fool!
the religion of peace strikes again.
Another ISLAMIC attack in London. I'm surprised. Boy that religion of peace really injures and kills a lot of people. Hmmmm
Religion of peace leaves another calling card. Gee.....could it be islamic terror....uh....let me think...reason says yes, but my multicultural side says it can't be....it's so confusing.....NOT!
Didn't you guys expect this? It's normal for living in the city.
A lot of cowards commenting hatred behind their cloak of anonymity towards the diverse multicultural workforce in London. What they quickly forget is that the city subsidises a lot of the UK. I wonder how many out of work northerns are state dependent on the back of taxes from the ethnics in London? A lot I imagine. Now news reveals that the terrorist was an overseas refugee so not even home grown.
Bullshit: there was an explosion and the carrier and bucket is still in tact... after the explosion.
I even lost count how many times London was attacked this year alone. The old English charming town is gone forever. Sad but true.
I wonder what poor smuck they are going to blame for their false flag.
Why do they have to investigate it to be a terrorist attack.  Nobody has went to wilkinsons and bought an ironing board that blows up
In other news... Sadiq Khan said he would be awarding the two arrested men the London Peace Award for their efforts.
You've been bombing all life long  , so stop creating motives, to me it seems like that's a strategy of yours to keep your selves involved in the middle eastern affairs, therfore you should bare responsibility for what you do ... stop your war crimes and keep hands off the middle east , be ashamed of your selfs, you're the one's who created the PALESTINIAN problem and you're the ones besides Yankeeland who helps prevent the PALESTINIAN SOLUTION being puppets of Zionism, you must be ashamed of your inhumane acts , stop your ironies you're causing terrorism to then use it as a challenge of media and as an excuse for your war crimes , definitely it's an anti-islamic aggression you getting away with it since ww3 ??? !!!
Is it just me or is the woman's voice really annoying? It sounds like she's spitting in my ears when I have my earphones in.
they were packed in like sardines.!!.why is it not illegal (for insurance purposes especially).surely if the train is jam packed with sardines,it should be illegal?,just a thought!...if you get on a bus....there is usually a sign stating the amount of people that it is allowed to carry?.yet they pack em in like sardines!.are the sardines then covered by insurance?.......sounds fishy?
Every single terrorist was a moderate once
It was confirmed as a Japanese Terrorist.
The leftist our gunna kill us all
London was attacked by Romans, Germans and now terrorists.
Imagine my shock, another terrorist attack. In England of all places! Very surprising!
I wonder were is the al Qaeda the taliban disappeared to now a days.
why wudnt they bomb and kill poor children and people becus there getting sent jail couple month'years and back out again and repeating them self.. wronge evil people .once they leave UKIreland go to there own country learn bomb makeing shouldn't be aloud back to UK ....yes police be around tube station for next week make people feel safe but what happens next week when there none ...24-7 Need police everyday not just wen bomb goes off !!!!!!!\nno were safe....
Inside job. MI5 corrupt terrorists, planted the bomb! All part of the agenda. \nProblem reaction solution!
And yet, as some sort of counter, they'll bring up American gun violence despite our 300 something million population and the gun violence only being prominent in areas that treat guns as they would the devil. And yes, most of the murderers who shoot up people are mentally deterred and not at all politically motivated. Believe it or not, people will do anything for their religion, people are very easily brain-washed.
Most watched city on earth with cctv and know one seen any one walking on a traine with a bucket but if a person wheres air max and a baseball cap they find out where they live in hours and have there picture up a every where ...
The Religion of Peace Strikes Again !!!
Cowardly, evil subhuman muslime filth need to be butchered off the face of the earth!
I heard of this this morning and I was just like \n\n*just another day in london*
Ffs..does this incident qualify for the lighting of candles or does someone have to die..I will phone  sad IQ khan ..he will know
are they sure it wasn't someone using a discontinued samsung galaxy note 7?
That officer ran out of tape and looked anxious
Izlam .......... iz ........... EVIL\nget out and get your loved onez OUT while you can.
Stay calm,  you're being invaded.  They will slaughter you.,,,
This is what happens when you let millions of people whose ideology directly conflicts with the UDHR into a civilized country.
Someone just left their Note 7
Why do these terror attacks happen now?
this is scary i use the London under ground and seeing that really scares me
We should stop all reporting on these incidents. All we are doing is playing into the hands of fools who get glory and recognition on TV and in the papers for what they have done. We are, in effect, keeping their momentum going and playing right into their hands.
A bucket in a train, is that the best false flag theatre MI5 could come up with? LOL.
Looks more like an battery explosion/fire to me and batteries can catch fire and vent very quickly  - it will be interesting to see if this really is a terrorist incident.
All day I was wondering why my school was on lock down and now I realise how close I was to the attack. I get off at Fulham Broadway the station before Parsons Green. Not gonna say my school name but the motto is: Respice Finem.
Some builders paint went on fire
Europe needs to stop letting in all these refugees
Those responsible dont ve to use the tube\nThey are well protected
Yep England keep letting them in, oh and pay for them too..
No doubt there is an investigation underway and maybe security will be found 'wanting'. Politicians will once again be rolling off the heart felt sentiments and maybe some people will call for hanging to be brought back (dead jihadis!) and once again most people will lose sight of the obvious fact, how did they get into our country? Do you recall not so long ago the scandal of murderers being allowed to return from Syria, the only people who can allow that to happen is the government. Bearing that in mind, are the government not criminally complicit for any deaths by terrorist who have returned from Syria? Your views appreciated. God bless you all.
As long as you have a political ties with KSA you expect more than that!
i am sorry to say this, but feal i must. if there is a god, i,m sure he wouldt want all this blood bath and war. the god i grew up to know wants peace and harmony for all mankind and woman, not war and killings and bloodbath, peace and love.
Theres no proof that its an act of terrorism
lol it was the reporter
The world disgusts me now. What people do to each other
Wake up england wake up its getting late
London just can't catch a break can they.
Hey! Wait for the next attack. Till then  let the religion of peace lull the politicians to sleep.
Relax everyone they were obviasly explosions of peace and friendship.
So how's that diversity working out for you England?
Terrorists are like fleas you just can't get rid of them. You can give the kitty a flea bath, treat the kitty with pesticides and put a flea collar on the kitty, and yet the kitty will still have some fleas. So at the very least we should start viewing these terrorists as parasites. Then if somebody ever discovers how to get rid of fleas on a cat, then perhaps we'll know how to eliminate terrorists.
This is not a terrorist attack
cheers for funding them US and UK governments.
If we don't remove Kebab, this will just keep happening.
Oh look, it's more diversity...why are y'all complaining, it's just their culture?...don't you go being a racist bigot now, ya' hear?
People in the comments keep making jokes but what they're too blind to see is that this is serious and people have died, and are still going to die. I live here and it's scary knowing that everywhere I go there could be another attack. They have not made it safer because it's happening more often. Bullshit government we have over here!
Prayers from London to London 🙏🙏🙏well done America for not letting those refugees in 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
why do i get te feeling that all this is a lie? i guess im not surprised anymore oh and one more thing TERRORISM HAS NO RELIGION
Mayor Kahn of London is the problem not the solution.
and then the mayor is seen holding a dove...
Another fine job by MI5.  Terrorism is not existent since 1998.
When she says 4 attacks she casually missed out the attacks that were stopped at the last minute.
well at least they have common sense to say what it is right away... Americans (i live) be like... we aren't sure what it is and will let you know next week....
Morons are ruining Europe. European vacation? No thanks.
Religion of Piece !!\none human piece here ...another their
Oh hey look, number 14, nice job u.k, making the world see how peaceful and nonviolent your immigrants are. Honestly the u.k is one of the saddest countries now. They're literally being plowed and they're just laying there taking it because they aren't racist so they won't close borders
What a peaceful Religion. So peaceful. The religion of peace. Yes. Quite.
Fake attack
Still no word about Iraqi WMDs
Bullshit little bit fire
Thank you ,Sadiq Khan.
Terrorist incident
Any casualities?

Hello iJustine, You are Super!!!, Thanks, ;-)
yall are the reason why apple keeps scamming people.. tbh... ijustine is the biggest and cutest (but nvm cuz) isheep ive ever seen lol
jealous bitch at 03:44 lollllll
you are very lucky person, you can buy what you want, but me, i cant.
whats the song at the end of the video
I wish that iJustine lives up her legacy and Apple DNA, never to speak Samsung phone ever again. iPhone X, Justine? I basically unsubscribe any channel talking bad about the X.
The level of ridiculousness of the whole concept of worshipping a phone is scary at the moment and is going to be very hard to explain to future generations in say 30 years.  They are going to be shocked how stupid we were :)
Are you getting the iPhone X? Or 8 or 8plus?
she is a beautiful nerd, i love it.
What’s the song name in min 6:31..?
Yay uraverageconsumer
I phone sucks.
Nice, more ishits for isheeps/idiots!
lol
Apple Geniuses put retards to shame
Omg I am speechless
Song at 8:30?
Rule Brittania  🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
ordinary
omg mkbhd is so hot
idiot ;)
Awesome ...
can you call me the name of the song at 13:00
I never had a iPhone period well I never had a phone since 2010 i do have a ipodtouch 5g but I decided for my very first phone in some time should be a iPhone 8
I Buyyed It!!! AND ITS SO COOL!!! THE CAMERA IS SO GOOD
hes going on a excursion in german vehicle on tv.. its not 'real'
Glad you like it! I love the new iPhone too! I even rapped about it on my videos lol
Hello Justine! Wish you the best luck forward !!
are you going to be lining up for the iphone 8
I love how excited she is 😭
Apple is excellent in reliability but BEWARE:  IPhone X uses infrared *LED Lasers* to Scan your face. This laser scan is Unhealthy and leads to *Skin Diseases* (which most already know, starts with a *C* )
Justine your enthusiasm is absolutely contagious and hype and I love it! I'm so excited for you and for the new products of course ❤️ Love from an Apple Employee
Well im sorry to say this but nade chose the wrong sister
What happened to the iPhone 9??
I mean it looks clean and smooth and nice but.... the camera.. come on like it looks weird... and NO BUTTON!!! I mean WHEN I SEE A ROUND BUTTON I THINK OF APPLE! Apple is known for having that button..
Ugly phone like shit
I need your help people should I buy iphone 7  in matte black, red or rose gold (i'm not asking for likes I just can't decide) 💜
Cool i dream iphone x in my hand
Why did apple skip the iPhone 9?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause seven ate nine.
After watching this video.. I fell in love with you... Not with Apple
iPhone 10 is a mess hardware wise and software. Apple is headed down the wrong path. Was a huge mistake firing Forstall!
Is switching to iPhone 8 plus from iPhone se worth it? Please help
What’s the song
I can see how a smartphone is useful in daily situations - I myself have an iPhone 7 - but wearables aren't something I can see myself using.\nI just watched a video today about 'How far we've fallen,' when it comes to modern living versus 10-20 years in the past.\nIn this case, one of those things is that runners ran just because - not because a watch tracked this or that.\n$300+ in their pocket, and no phones, watches, or wires to deal with.
I just subscribed. Love your review. It was fresh and fun! Look forward to many more!
If they could just remove or at least cover that horrible notch up on the iphone X.
Ijustineee this is a full copy of gestual used many years for Blackberry OS10 https://www.youtube.com/embed/834c31nqoKc?rel=0&showinfo=0
The first OLED screen good enough for an iPhone and it has piece missing....Samsung must be laughing that they can sell such a component to Apple
3:44 look at the lady in the background haha
Steve Jobs Theatre looks really good
imagine going in this event with everything on you as android devices! security will be like get the F**K out of here! lol
Why u talk sweet. Ur gorgeous
I got dizzy watching this video
the beatlesss
Waaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwww😍

That kid is amazing..
Developers around the world should not accept the @Apple suggestion of embracing d notch, darkening the @iPhoneXNotch border. @NOTCHBLACKOUT

Hiiiiii dear
I saw you with Alex on  the EllenShow and went straight to your channel right away lol
Apple is playing catch up,that iphone X with the chin,what a joke.A company with billions at their disposal and this is what they come up with. And here is the thing idiots will still buy them because they are sheep. And yes I could afford it if I wanted to.
You are so happy. Lol I’m excited for u lol
iPhone exe just sounds better...i'm going with it
Chill mate it's just an iPhone
how is that roof standing tho
Please support me with my new channel
She's found her passion. I respect that.
OMG that little boy just reminded me that my life is going nowhere slowly!
Really iSHEEP! Samsung Note 8 is a galaxy ahead of iPhone from wireless charging to stunning design and crystal clear beautiful screen, and iPhone price is almost the same as that of Note 8, so iSHEEP think iPhone is not overpriced, overhyped, and overrated!!! Don't be a follower, don't be one of sheeples. Be a leader, be a Samsung user. Baaaa... baaaing. LMAO. ROFL.
...who is this annoying broad? Quit yacking about your awesome day. Show me the phone!!
i phones are the most boring planest looking phones and they still look the same from 07
So... forgot about the 7s and 9?
If you want the best and greatest phone is the Samsung 8
Congrats on getting to go to the keynote and congrats on 4 million!!!!
Only 3gb RAM when iOS11 is catered only to 64-bit apps will be the X's greatest weakness in the long run. Should've been 4gb. The iPhone 5s is already showing its age with iOS11 with just 1gb.\n\nMoroccan blue LG V30 for me or forget another cookie cutter smartphone altogether. Too quick to die on us, 2-3 yrs tops. Better get a Nintendo Switch with the Mario Odyssey bundle instead. My Jordan 7 retros lasted longer than my smartphones. 5 yrs > 2-3 yrs.\n\n#fuckplannedobsolescence
An expensive and sad obsession, stop promoting this over priced bullshit please.
The problem is : where is iphone 9 ???
I'm so happy that you got to go!! I was smiling throughout the whole video <3 Steve Jobs is one of the few people i idolize as well so you meeting his partner in crime, Waz, is pretty amazing, girl! <3
Your best video to date
Apple Park is the big theater. You review very great! Amazing...
OMG! I can feel your joy for being there. I wish I could be there too.
I’m so thankful for you, iJustine. Apple holds such a huge place in my heart and I love everything they are. Thank you for being such an amazing YouTuber and letting people like me live through your videos.
I can be your friend 😉
I really like this thanks you show us too many things from different perspective go a head you are the best
The iPhone X is garbage
iPhone X is cool! But I do not want to\nI want the camera to get better because I've taken a lot of videos

Maybe it's because of butt hair
Lol, you discovered Public Amenities Plastic Bogrolls. Next time you visit Aus, buy some Sorbent at the local Coles or something.
Hank, you are so adorable when you're crazy tired.  (And cheap toilet paper?  NO NO NO NO NO.  Also, NO!)
This is a great video
Tina: Butts
https://youtu.be/tTvjRyv0c5M
I think only jet-lagged Hank should be allowed to make videos
When you say people with butt problems are speaking about actual health issues affecting the butt or just general butt issues at the moment?
Was not ready for the butt checks trap song
This video is all over the place. I LOVE it.
I watched this and for the past few days have been subjected to TOO MANY Charmin advertisements
4 ply
As a fellow IBD-er (Crohn's), I LOVED this video. I'm right there with you and I also appreciate nice toilet paper. Angelsoft is in my bathroom. Some sort of see-through sand paper (is that even possible?) is at my in-laws. Guess which I'd rather use. These hands are your butt cheeks!
best video i've seen in a while
Running out of ideas.
Not to sound like a hotel shill, but we want your stay to be comfortable and we love to go out of our way to do things that seem special, so next time you have terrible TP let the front desk staff know!\n\nThe TP in the room is truly terrible, really awful, I couldn't be more disappointed. I'm going out for the day and I would be really really impressed if I came home tonight to find super plush soft TP in my room.\n\nI know my hotel would send a porter up the street to buy some of the good stuff ASAP, and you can make a note asking for soft and sturdy stuff when you book your next hotel. ESPECIALLY if you're staying in a fancy hotel, we LOVE these kinds of requests. Trust me!
lol
I just watch Hank Green rap. About butts . . .
(Aussie) Can't stand places skimping on their toilet paper.
I have no words...
I keep saying I should buy a bidet, but I never have... Spending a year in Iraq with cheap toilet paper wrecked my butt. It took years to recover. I'm not exaggerating.
This is a very Hank video and I love it.
I'm so happy to have seen this video
I have Crohn's. I feel your pain... literally.
Baby powder and body glide- my super hero weapons
Hank, I installed a cheap Astor bidet (it's on amazon) at my home. Huge life improvement. \nThe other thing you can try is (less pleasant, for sure) is the solution that muslims in  South African often do- a water bottle, some squeezing- okay it's not at all pleasant but it sure beats weak TP!
This was weird but really good.
That butt cheek rap... thank you for that.  This is your best video since Accio Deathly Hallows!
Hank, with all the love in my Hufflepuff heart, get. some. sleep.
Did anyone else notice his bedhead going on in this? The little flapping strands of hair on the back of his head. Ahhh, it's cute. :)\n\nP.S. Butts.
But... But... I thought Quilton loves your bum...
that was wild.
DUDE - have you seen my rant from Playlist DC?
This is a lot.  I am happy about this.
God that was excellent
I have a bidet on my toilet and will never go back to not having one. But, when traveling I always carry wipes.
What was that Hank???
Do a video about Brexit please...
this feels like old vlogbrothers I love it
Thank you for your honesty and candor about this subject. I have gastro issues and this is the truest thing ever.
I don't know why it took me two days to get to watching this masterpiece. I'm crying from laughing.
Boudreaux's butt paste is my fav cream. It kind of smells like cookie dough, too (smell BEFORE application).
It's Charmin. And yes you should bring it with you everywhere apparently :P
This is why I use wet wipes. Wish they weren't terrible for the sewers though.
Yeah I know what you are talking about I live in Australia and the toilet paper in schools is so bad ,like the only place you can find good paper is if you buy it yourself.
Peri bottle. Or travel bidet. That's what you need, Hank.
And I JUST watched Vox's video about triplets in rap and then Hank drops that madness.

I wasn't emotionally prepared for this... Why did I wait until Monday morning...
I am Australian and generally assume that any public toilet including hotels will have single ply crepe paper for toilet paper. I lived in halls of residence and found it very handy to have your own decent toilet paper supply. It's just expected that public toilet paper is bad toilet paper. So yeah. This also applies to hotels. A nice hotel is not defined by its rooms or its price. It's defined by whether or not it will fork out for decent and also a DECENT AMOUNT of toilet paper. 2 rolls is not enough for a weeks accomodation I'm telling you!
1. 🙋🏼 Butt problems! \n2. I really want a full version of This is Your Butt Cheeks... Like, seriously. It's stuck in my head and I'm not even mad. \n3. This is probably my favorite vlogbrothers video in a long time.
Just realized that John has the same type of front teeth in the lower Jaw that I have xD
Hey Hank! In Britain supermarkets DO give you the per yard cost of toilet paper (actually, I think it's per sheet). It's written in little numbers under the price label. They do this for nearly everything, not just toilet paper: they tell you how much your raspberries cost per gram, and how much your orange juice costs per ml. It's great and so useful.
Tmi guess but who gives a crap? (Lol) Aw man i think I'm the exact opposite on my tp preferences lol I HATE charmin (the bear brand) because it's tooo soft and falls to pieces. Literally. Tmi but I stg I was at my parent's house (they buy charmin) and hours later I found pieces of tp still there. I feel so damn unclean. I actually much prefer the terrible public-bathroom tp over that stuff. Least it doesn't fall apart! (I usually go with the 1ply cotonelle, it's strong and does it's job) \n\nGod, why do Vlogbrother's videos make me feel like oversharing so much lmao sorry 😂💩🐻🚽
Satin is a way of weaving so your sheets could have been satin made out of cotton! Though that's unlikely, it's possible.\nAlso a nice hotel should have enough budget for nice toilet paper. I've been to mediocre hotels that had nice toilet paper!
No bidet's? What are you? Common savages?
Do Australians just have iron butts? Well... yes.
You should have wiped your butt with those bed sheets.. thatll make a statement and hopefully the hotel owner takes the hint and improves the quality of the toilet paper :)
I think there's a GMM episode in which they determine the best toilet paper. If that helps you shopping ^^
I saw you at VidCon Australia
It's not your butt cheeks it's your inter gluteal cleft... I learned that from crash course... I'm like 90% sure that's where I learned it from... but I may be wrong.
Reminds me of that old game, toilet tycoon simulator. In this game you operate a commercial restroom and people pay you money to go take a dump basically. As you earn money you can upgrade different elements of your toilets like the bowl and the paper. You start with regular toilet paper, then you get the extra fluffy stuff and at some point people are wiping their bums with silk. I remember the highest toilet paper level is Minx Fur. \n\nI'm not making this up, this is a real game.
Buy a portable bidet! Problem solved. This is the one I got. Works really well:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Brondell-GS-70-GoSpa-Travel-Bidet/dp/B008CSDKSQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1505791651&sr=8-4&keywords=portable+bidet
Dear Hank, \nI was very sad when I found out that your show in Portland sold out while I was at work. This video made me happy again. Thanks for sharing your amazingly awesome weirdness with all of us. I'll miss seeing you in Portland.
Hank...... This video was a lotta fun
Oh these are your butt cheeks\nYour gluteus what cheeks?\nGet some A+D ointment\nAnd make an appointment\nAnd end irritation\nAs you strut cheeks\n\nYour butt cheeks\nThese hands are your butt cheeks\nThe motion I'm makin'\nIs a simulation\nOf the action\nOf both of your butt cheeks\n\nThese are your butt cheeks\n\n\nYou're welcome, internet.
Hank, I missed your weird side. \nI work in a hospital where people get treated for butt problems, and I sometimes have butt problems. The toilet paper is HORRIBLE. Coincidence? Perhaps. OR guaranteeing more business.
That Rap... is going to be the next top single of 2017
I have three words for you, Hank... Flushable. Wet. Wipes. Not only cleans your butt much better, but is way more comfortable. I'm a complete convert.
This was an incredible viewing experience. 😂
Okay Hank, what drugs did you take? Can you take more because this was hilarious.
I'm sorry, was that the crow soundbite from The Simpsons?
I know for a fact that you spent way too long on that rap. well done hank. well done
Are we going to have a 2017 nerdfighteria census? I don't want to come off like I'm pressuring you, Hank. I get that you're super busy. I've just been hoping for a while that you would release one because I like taking them. They're fun. Again, no pressure.
Think I know true cause of your problem...... Cheap food IN must eventually OUT.
Hank is a wonderful human being.
I swear, Australia has good toilet paper available! This hotel is letting us down.
A couple of weeks of bad toilet paper once gave me months of pain and bleeding and PANTS AREA UNPLEASANTNESS. I feel so much less alone in the world now. #buttproblems
been a while since we've had a Hank song like that ...
You realise that the next time you come to Australia, everyone you see will have rolls of our softest bog roll/dunny paper/pottypaper, just for you.
VlogBrothers /Hank,,\nI too feel your pain. Don't let the name fool ya, Charmin Ultra Strong is the way to go. Worth every penny. Because A man has to do what a man has to DOO and you shouldn't be dreading the before or after. 😯\nHere's hoping everything comes out alright. \nok, I've gotta go ,give it a try. You won't be disappointed. BTW, you can prevent splashdown and significantly cut down on the ode de doo aroma with a product called \nV.I.Poo.\nI WISH I was making this $#!+ up..\nlmao
sorry about ur butt :(
WTF did i just watch, lol
Goodness!
Erm ... are you OK, hank? ;-)
As someone who lives in Melbourne I can confirm that pretty much nowhere has nice toilet paper. Not restaurants, not hotels, not anywhere. It's a bad time.
I RAISED MY HAND I HAVE PILONIDAL SINUS
Australia's toilet paper is like the Australians themselves : rough, tough, and doesn't take shit off of anyone.
i wasn't ready for the butt cheeks rap
I had to stop watching due to slow buffering the other day and when I just clicked to continue watching it was the butt cheeks rap and needless to say I got some weird looks
I'm sorry for your struggles, Hank, but it sure makes a funny video!
nice veiw of the BROWN Yarra River, a river in which dead bodies are found frequently.
Australian shops are required to give a price per 100 sheets for toilet paper. You're welcome
Use your hands Hank. 😂
Butt problems make Hank angry.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhxmyzDbdWU
Can you john collaborate on a children's book?
Been awhile since I laughed out loud at Vlogbrothers. Thanks, Hank!
Tired Hank is awesome
i mean, the population of lgbtiq people in australia are going through a political situation that is incredibly dangerous to our mental and physical health - speaking, of course, about the nation-wide survey to determine whether we are seen as humans in the eyes of the greater population - but, sure, talk about toilet paper. Whatever.
Chelsea please beat arsenal today
Hazard turned Coquelin into a fidget spinner!
R.I.P 4rsenal
Chelsea win 6-0
Morata vs Lacazette \nZappacosta vs Kola\nBakayoko vs Xhaka \nHolding vs Cristensen\n\nGame on. Lets see who have the better signing and prospect for the future. COME ON YOU BLUES!!!!!!!\nLets shut the gooners up.
Hazard turn him into a Beyblade HAHAHA
Jheeeeeze! Man like Dan! 🔥🔥🔥
Hazard The Mercenary hope one day he turns overrated Ramos inside-out
I am a chelsea fan and today is birthday,can i get a like?
Morata's headers are lit.
Hazard and Morata are 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Savage Dan🙌🙌
I'm surprised Hazard still isn't serving a life sentence after what he did Coquelan
Chelsea cmon you blues! Like for Chelsea to win!
Hazard is a god. 4-0 Chelsea win!!
Lets destroy Arsenal, 3-1 for Chelsea
He turned coq to be fidget spinner
200th like here
Chelsea win !!!
Let's smash ARSEnal
Such a shame that Coquelin is injured! 😂😂😂
Hope he does the same today.. Come on you blues 💙💙💪
Damn CFC poaching Dan from Filthy Fellas lol
3-0 by Chelsea ...Morata,Alonso,Willian
Chelsea to win 3-1
Beyblade lol
First
Sav Dan is killing it
really sad when hazard didn't play last night, i know maybe conte wont take the risk but i think it's important to win that match, and i think even the unfit hazard still better than any other player.
David Luiz had to attack more because everyone else wasn’t doing enough and got pinned into a red card. I really hope Conte changes the squad the next few games because we are in need of some variety. Can’t expect to win against an in form Man City when we can’t even score against Arsenal at home....
Is this savage dan from 3 shots of Tequila???
i was the 1600 guy to hit like
Lol 0-0 and a Red card a win for Arsenal. Deluded club
disgrace of a performance today.
this is on trending
But hazards not even starting, I'm almost worried now
I remember that goal i had one aim to score against Arsenal and i make sure it was a greatest goal that can be talked about in years and i'm super delighted to score such a beautiful goal.
he needs at least 15 similar goals in a single season to win the ballon dor
Is it okay if I don't like the new third kit?
Never knew Wolfy was a Chelsea fan, always pops up on miniminter's channel too
Chelsea vs Arsenal today come on Chelsea!!!!!!
Guys, Please who can give the name of the music in the background?
Please don't lose and give those fans something to cheer about. We are much better now go and prove it
I predict Morata and Alonso to score
He had to wake up at 8 am to watch the match? I have to wake up at 4:45 am to watch
Morals has more to his game than Lacazette, he can score with both feet, his head and he can dribble.
If you're reading this....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a great day
I remember him being a ghost in the fa cup final as well.
Martial is a better player than hazard.
Willian and Pedro are USELESS\n4 games without Cahil, 4 wins\n2 games with Cahill, 1 draw, one loss, reduced to 10 men on both occasions\nOur best possible line up. \nGk: courtois... good keeper, but needs to get the sloppy mistakes out of his system\nCb: Azpilequeta, good defender, no flaws\nLuiz: just keep his head in the game, played well today\nRudiger, good defender, solid\nWb: Moses, very good defensively\nAlonso, deadly going forward\nCm: bakayoko, so good, the physical man\nKante, obviously \nFabregas, must learn to track back a little more\nSt: Morata, great finisher, needs a little more time to learn how to play an epl defender\nHazard, he needs to step up, 20 goals a season at least and 10 assists, a player of his talent is expected to score that many \nChristensen, zapacosta can fill when needed, and drink water will be could when we need to be more defensive in place of fabregas
Lets destroy arsenal today hazard may man👍
Sav like Dan
haha
Cahill the shittiest chelsea captain
Rip 0-0
Man Like Dan
Savage Dan....!!!!!!!!
Lengendary Chelsea...⚽double🏆🏆
The garden..OF EDEN

Aguero golden boot>>>>>
Crystal Palace next LOL!
You city fans should appreciate every day this guy is your manager. Coming from a Bayern Munich fan. After he leaves you will miss this astonishing performances believe me. No matter who comes next
*Where's all the City haters saying Pep is a fraud now? That was an absolute slaughter & so was Liv'pool 5-0. As a Chelsea supporter I fear City this season.*
EPL welcome to total football, watch and enjoy, just starting #takenoprisoners
best manager in the world okay city come on pep come on city...
*_Great win for City_*
im the best thanks for the upload, beany!
Pep bringing la liga scorelines to the epl
again not good enough #pepout #Cityincrisis
I'm a city fan but let's not get carried away. Let's not trash talk or be cocky yet. Injuries and complacency can happen at any time. Plus we got chelsea at the end of this month and still yet to play top 6 sides.\n\nI really hope we defend against the top sides and not commit the fullbacks too much forward against them.
aguero  fanstastic
C'MON CITY
Heavy breather
!´m so so happy!
Take note all you bitch ass City haters, we're on a man hunt and hungrier than ever !!!
The pep haters are low in numbers on the comment section. I wonder why!
Best bald manager in the world.😁😂😂
Why are people not commenting fraud
WHERE ARE ALL THE PEPS A FRAUD TROLL'S NOW. YOU ARE NOT, YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE JEALOUSY IS A SILENT M*THER F#CKER INNIT .GORD CTID. OOWHHH MAN CITY.....THE ONLY FOOTBALL TEAM TO COME FROM MANCHESTER®
Looking real good for Guardiola...Jesus has forced Aguero to step up his work rate and now Aguero has the ability to become golden boot
Big sigh, wish he was at Arsenal!
Are United still the favorites???!???!?? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Top of the league from here on out
How awesome was that performance? That was total and complete football...\nIf only PEP wasn't a fraud? We'd be even better, if Pep was a decent manager.... But apparently he's a fraud according to some football geniuses.
IN PEP WE TRUST 100%
Wow! I hope he and his family  stay happy in Manchester he's a legend already..thanks pep...M.C.F.C
Pep haters not swarming the comments on every video I see lol if he wins the league with City so many ppl gonna cry
Your still not gonna win anything this year you glory hunting tossers.
If pep was argentinian, cant imagine what messi-aguero partnership will be like. Argentina would probably be 4 times WC champion by now
I think its between City and United who wins the pl title this season, I hope Kompany stays healthy for the rest of the season, because defensively city is still vulnerable, maybe Pep can bring a new CB in january.
Every PL fan: In the PL any club could win you'll never see a 6-0 score line in the PL .... where you guys at now? Hmm now that an English club finally has a talented club worthy to compete in Europe they're thrashing pub clubs like watford.
I guess 6-0 is what it takes to get Pep to smile
best manager in the world
City and Utd show-down this season
Meanwhile, Manure are celebrating being behind their city rivals PMSL
even we didn't play our best xl so don't take it easy united dogs
Man city means everything to me and the fans ...personaly I better miss a meal than missing a man city match.... Love you citizens'
no matter wat city do pipo will always talk shit so to all the city n gaurdiola haters go fuck yrselves or rather go masterbate
City city city all the way
I am so happy.. Happy new year
Pep gloats by bigging up his opposition to make him sound better
Pep is a fraud. Spent £1 billion and can't score 10 goals against Watford
we are nigas
Thank you CITY!
Man city vs Chelsea \n4-2\nMan City  vs CP \n10-0

When Real and Barcelona win 6-0 English fans ARE TOLD BY THE ENGLISH MEDIA that the Primera is an easy league and the Premier League is the tough League where the big teams die to win!! when City win 5-0 against Liverpool and 6-0 against Watford what happens to the tough Premier League?!! WAKE UP ENGLISH FANS....ITS ALL PART OF MARKETING...
I'am Man.United fan but i admitted the football from City just amazing to watch.\nAttacking Football that he brings to City simply magnificent.\nAs a lover of attacking football i admire his philosophy.
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
Don't let this romp fool you ,Citeh will collapse either midseason or late season like they always do.
My Top Six Prediction :\n1.Manchester City\n2.Manchester Utd\n3.Chelsea\n4.Liverpool/Tottenham \n\n\nOpinions?

What happens if your light fails and you're literally out there in the pitch black💀💀💀
Great video, I enjoy the Another dirty room series but the exploration/eerie videos are the best.
This video makes Dan’s trip to abandon malls look like visiting Disneyland.
30:42 Anyone else see the 2nd bag?
Dan, I've really enjoyed your videos.  I think you have an ability to capture an atmosphere that is completely authentic.  This video, however, is a real triumph.  I was on the edge of my seat.  You are a very brave man.
From 25:18 to 25:30.   Did you do anything that might cause a reflection?  If not you captured something interesting.
you. this. \nthis is amazing. \nyou, are amazing.
animal or human?\n\nyou mean a carcass?\n\nholy hell man.
You got some balls man.
Someone got shot and reanimated into a walker
When he says that something stinks it looks like that stack of sticks might have something underneath
Did anything come of the EVPs?
Wow. What a sewer of humanity. Can you imagine 10 or 20 years from now what that place will be like? Much worse.,
dude, if you arent carrying a weapon, you are crazy.
Frank are you coming to Karen's birth day party this weekend\n\nPlease let me or Kathy know if you plan to. Thanks god bless!
This is literally scarier then IT. That movie wasn't scary to me but this right here scares the shit out of me.
Japan has suicide forest Baltimore has rapey/murder forest
A gun fight? In Baltimore? Get out of town! I was trying to figure out how I got subscribed to this...... Must have been the abandoned mall videos. I'll stick around for those.
Cool video. I live about a mile away from there in a nicer part of Baltimore but have never visited that park for obvious reasons. Honestly though none of the creepy forest stuff spooks me. The crowded streets of Baltimore are way spookier than any isolated wooded parts. That's where people get killed constantly, they just dump the bodies in the woods.If you're scared of ghosts, move to Baltimore, you won't be any more.
I can't decide if this is courageous or stupid.
Honestly it sounds like a gun range to me, i grew up living by one, and shooting at a gun range
Wtf man, people just don't give a shit about our planet anymore
OMG why do you go there alone??? I am so scared for you. And gun shots oh no my goodness
So happy that dan is doing creepy stuff. Literally first thing I'be watched outside the dead mall series. Thanks Dan, now I have to start bingeing your channel again.
And people say Detroit is bad? Baltimore is by far worse. A lot worse.
I got a story about things in bags. \n\nSo my cousin lives in New Orleans, and me and my family visit frequently. We like to walk along the levy as well as explore the shore of the Mississippi. We were just talking, minding our own buisness, throwing rocks, etc. And we saw a plastic bag that looked like it had something in it. So we went to investigate and it kind of smelled. When we glanced into the opening we saw a snout. Upon looking harder, I saw claws and fur. We determined it was likely a racoon, but to this day I don't really care to much but it bothers me how that could've happened.\n\nEdit: It was a plastic store bag that are translucent.
Dan and Rick do it so you don't have to. You have guardian angels for sure, bt don't over tax them. Great film
That was great Dan keep the videos coming!!
Notice all the bottles of bleach next to where the bones were.
at 36:40 you can here someone say PLEASE HELP ME!!! It's really fucking creepy
get the popcorn out guys great video
leakin park more like linkin park\nI N   T H E     E N D     I T      D O E S N T     E V E N     M A T T E R
i liked your leakin park live streams better than this way more details there
Finds a bag in the woods:  Well, better kick it 30 times...
scary freaking me out seeing u in there GET OUT!!
at 25:02 you can see a mist on the left side of the screen (not saying it's anything paranormal) but at a place like that, who knows
With in gynn falls area is a very very rich area. The person who wrote the wire is from there. The area is gwynn oaks and the road is \n Wetheredsville Rd, Baltimore, MD 21207.
My cousin, Tommy got mixed in hard drugs after he had a brain injury as a teenager.  Long story short, his body was found in this park.   Very sad doc for me to watch.
At least give it a proper burial.
That  cop was too scared to open that bag he just slashed it and backed the hell up haha
Great video as always, Dan. That said, I believe you should blur the faces of people that asked not to be recorded. You are completely in your rights to record whoever you please when in public, but it is still a bit disrespectful. Especially since they had nothing to do with the crime.\n\n\nSide note, seeing all of the names of the victims marked on the map really gives it some weight, but when I saw infant. . .That was heavy.
You can't pay me enough to live in Baltimore.
This is soo good! Really love the camerawork and the voice over! Please do more like this! I love your work. Watching through the Dead Mall and Dead Motel series right now. One episode every night/evening!
tell us to where headphones then play the darn music loud....? wth
The fact that you didn't but the gunfire as a clickbait in the title actually made the video much enjoyable to me
Sounded like a war zone, or 4th of July, with all that poppin! Good one, but be careful out there! ;)
Honestly...I know you wanted to find out what was going on and get a good filming opportunity, but you really should kind of back off the cops when they're working. The gunfight was clearly very recent, they might've still been looking for suspects, trying to rope off the area, and getting close and trying to ask what happened is a problem. Especially when a bunch of people do it in a crowd or something, which is what usually happens. And most of the time, the cops aren't actually allowed to tell you what happened until the event is over.\n\nAnd I think, if those people really didn't want to be on camera, it might've been polite to blur their faces...
Stop going solo to bad spots like these you are going to end up getting hurt really badly or killed by dumb asses. Please take someone with you or at least carry a gun.
I swear Rick makes the video better. 😂😂😂😂
You guys are either very brave or totally nuts. Either way, this was a great video. I hope you do more like it. \nDo you guys live in Baltimore? I live in Maryland but not in Baltimore.  I don't even like to go there when I have to. However, there is a very good hospital up there. UMMC literally saved my life. \nYou guys, please be very careful when you go out doing something like this.\nDid you ever find out what all the gun shots were about, and if anyone was hurt or killed?
I have to pause this to rinse out fucking hair dye and I'm freaking out, man.
Glad you guys are getting popular and recognition. The hotel videos alone are fucking hysterical.
Very Creepy , your a very brave man to film this stuff on your own at night .   \nKeep up the good work and looking forward to more Dead Mall Series video's
ive found about 100 plus bags like that during my career, mostly dead chickens and fighting dogs, never a person. there is a section of road we do that they have found 10 bodies on this year alone. for a while we had dead chickens with cash under then mostly 10 dollar bills. nothing like blood money for real.
when you zoomed in on Hae Min Lee i got chills
This is the first video of yours other than retail archaeology I've ever seen...holy shit great work
Nothing like a gun fight to start your day off right
gunfight in baltimore...\nwhat else is new?
Thank you for this! i really enjoyed this video! haven't been scared in a while
That's just crazy walking through those woods. I live in Morrall park Baltimore city of course!! And do not walk alone in the dark. Be safe!!!!
Damn dude! You have huge balls to get alone there... Anyway, this is finally the best real horror documentary, well done Dan!
Unfortunately that second place is probably an animal dumping site either for dead ones or ones still alive...
This was excellent, please make more videos like this, the filming and production quality are amazing. I felt very anxious watching while you filmed alone, though!
Very interesting juxtaposition of the natural setting of the park and the urban crime of the city surrounding it.  Fascinating and chilling.
When was this video made?  I was in Baltimore this past weekend
I was waiting for slender man on the night video
That just sounds like a gunfire exchange.  And then off he goes further into the woods.  That was the funniest thing I've seen in weeks.
So you did tip the local police to where you found those bones right? I know I sound like I'm jumping to conclusions, they're just as likely to be animal bones. Yet the pelvic looking and leg-ish looking bones right next to an old boot in a park notorious for dumped bodies...
Did you tell the cops that you heard the shots? Even though you didn't see something, you could have told them what you heard.
This was incredibly well done!
Decides to be a decent human and listen to the spam at the beginning knowing it pays for this video I'm about to watch. Cops like dude I don't wanna deal with the paperwork if that's another infant. Wonder how many other people have crawled around that place at night that he's come upon since all those poor people were found?
So I know you're all about exposing different awful things... But why would you put yourself through this? PLEASE, be safe and don't get hurt!
Thank-you Mr. Bell for your courageous filming here! People should take back that park -Community efforts to clean up the refuse in the park, perhaps police patrols of the vehicle blocked roads - day and night. In my city, increased police presence is a greatly diminished crime. Even wilderness cameras work well too. What's happing with animal protection laws in Baltimore? Just shocking people dispose every sort of living thing in that park!
Dan this video is awesome. So scary Jesus! Please be safe.
I think Mcnulty was looking for Omar.
That was freaky....glad I watched during the day!
Ok, the fact there was a boot near bones, especially ones resembling leg and hip bones, leads me to believe they may have been human. Please tell me you notified the police of your findings. ._.'
Imagine cycling these roads at night ...and increase your speed at each corner (how fast can I pedal?)
Looks like another bag in the bushes @ 30:48 :\
This! This is the kind of stuff that I want to see on tv/movie. This genuinely unnerved me all the way through and has more of an impact that any horror movies. Plus you're learning things as you watch. Incredible work Dan and co!
EVPS MOTHAFUCKA!!!
Ewww
Likely haunted by Chester Bennington.
nice camera man so clear
Probably where people do satanic rituals
7:10
That person driving by had no idea they were being filmed in the dark in the WOODS now that's creepy.
Thank god for police bravery...lmao!!!!  My god you had a million times more guts them him what if it were a baby... its nothing in his eyes!! WOW
Man what were the odds that a gun fight would take place while you were there!? Oh wait...it's Baltimore...so...coin flip.
CRAWLING IN MY SKIIIINNNNN. oh. its LEAKIN Park...
Hey Dan drives an X 3.🙂
Those weren't animal bones
EVP'S motherfucker!!! 😂
EVP's mothafucka! - Rick
Crawling in my skiiin
The Baldamor accents are priceless

 Black widow 
Watch Red Sparrow Full Movie (2017) Streaming Online in HD 720p/1080p Video Quality =>> [ https://t.co/bhckBzPazH ]
Nice... Waiting...  Jennifer Lawrence is a pretty woman!
OMG JENNIFER LAWRENCE IS THE BEST IN THIS MOVIE ANY MOVIE WITH HER IN IT IS GOOD AF
Is she going to blame the existence of sparrows on Donald Trump?
I'd hit the ATM for that one.
Oh hi Black Widow! When did you get here?
The Americans! Stop leading weltanschauungskrieg, the cold war ended in 1991 when the victory of the Chinese. In the third world war, you will be Germany, and we are allies with China. And no coercion to betrayal will not help to avoid the fate for you. Peace to you, future communist friends, and understanding for unfortunate consumer slaves. Proletarians of all countries, unite!
Wasn't there a 1980s movie like this with Linda Hamilton in the lead?
I think you mean Black widow
I feel like I've seen this movie at least 5 times before...even though I can't think of any of the titles it's gone by. (Not sure that's a great sign...)
BLACK WIDOW  : Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century Marvel .....ahhhhh I Mean FOX
I can't wait to miss this movie.
All women are like this!!!!! seduce u take your money and kill you
Хуйня опять
Atomic Blonde and Black Widow
This is a Black Widow movie.
I just hope they don't make her have lesbian scenes just because she's strong and seduces her victims like in Atomic Blonde.
So many flavours and they go with Salty. Pun very much intended.
can someone tell me what matthias schoenaerts won in the academy? imdb isnt showing.
I liked it better when it was the Black Widow program.
I read this book the movie was based on....it was okay...it kind of went nowhere at the end of it... hopefully she brings something to the role..buuuut I'm not thinking so...
Someone had to make a Black Widow movie, so why not 20th century fox, starring Mystique.
L'âme should have been called a teaser not trailer.
Jennifer Lawrence as an escort assassin? Count me in.
This is gonna flop just like Mother...Jennifer needs to take a break and choose her roles more wisely....overexposure can kill a career.
So... It's literally Black Widow? A Russian woman trained by a covert intelligence facility who gains an ally in an American spy who convinces her to leave Russia? Wow, Fox.
So is marvel suing? i mean, this is clearly a ripoff of black widow
So it's Black Widow's origin movie? Got it. \nUnoriginal Hollywood hackjob #31678.
Im thinking Black Widow and 50 Shades of Grey, anyone else?
The unofficial Black Widow movie lol i love it!
Black swan + John Wick = Red sparrow = Black widow
Jennifer Lawrence is a nigger
This is the black widow movie....its literally a colour and an animal and its the exact movie they were trying to make
So, basically Marvel didn't want to do a Black Widow origin story and Fox decided to make it instead.
I see no negative comments in the comments section, yet there are 1K dislikes... Why do people hate this trailer again? Is it a This movie is trying to portray all women as people who manipulate emotions because that isn't true (heh) or JLAW isn't suitable to play a sexy role (?)
How to manipullate men using their bodies.  You mean like EVERY single woman since the dawn of TIME, wow, we need a special program in Moscow for that one... TERRIBLE premise NOTx
That's CAPTAIN Red Sparrow
The books are fantastic. They were written by a former CIA operative, I think. And they are a lot darker than any Black Widow movie would have been.
Came here excited to see Joel Edgerton, but left disappointed after seeing Jennifer Lawrence 😒
Someone please make a gif and crop it from starting at 1:01 please!
Guys this has nothing to do with super hero's or atomic blonde.\nThis is about the sparrow school which was a sub branch of the KGB that was disguised as a ballerina school which trained orphaned girls to became KGB spy & assassin's.
Solo film about the Black Widow in MCU we must will forget...
Lmfao! this is like the Black Widow movie we never got! even the origin looks like the same.
So they decided to make a Black Widow movie after all
Does anyone know the name of the song in the trailer? It's so good.
It's What If Mystique was Black Widow?!?
LOL it's basically a BLACK WIDOW MOVIE
This looks spectaclar. Jennifer Lawrence in that brunette fringe looks 5 years old
women trained for combat and using their sexuality as a weapon... kinda sounds like Naked Weapon (an asian film), anyone familiar with it???
Ppl r just hating on this movie because of the stigma that JLaw is overrated. In the end of the day, this is a book adaptation, and from what I can see, it looks well directed, conceptualized, and Jennifer carries the trailer. Stop hating on movies/actors just cos the general public just wants to hate on something.
Imagine if after all the carnage, the film cuts to black and right before the credits roll you hear her retarded laughter.
It's like a mix of Black Swan and Naked Weapon
I guess we finally have the Black Widow movie
So many receipts in the comments
the picture of she in a red room assult me however i find it a strong trailer adviced for pg18
The evil Russians and their Agents. Hollywood is so innovative....
Black Widow's Origin story
Could be the first movie I watch that stars Jennifer Lawrence.
MCU stans are so pressed over Red Sparrow. And I'm loving it ...they can keep their kiddy mcu version. Thank god Red Sparrow is gonna be hard R.
JLaw is acting as Dominica but who is Nash?
Not the black widow movie we asked for but apparently it's the one we're going to get
The hell...This is too close to Atomic Blond to the blond wig...seriously?
Ah, I just noticed it was moved from November to March. Why the date shift?
My dad once said - The russians are like a ugly moth - it will charade as a butterfly, but its soul is that of a ugly pest - destroying, feral, barbaric and pathetic little things
Black Widow meets Girl With the Dragon Tattoo meets Atomic Blonde!
Why so many dislikes ? i loved the  book and this looks great!
This looks so stunning! J-LAW is amazing!
that swimsuit though.
Щас каждый долбаеб заметит сторублевый пресс, и будет ржать, мол мало что ужас какой, а кто сказал , что там не пятитысячные внутри, обезьяний мозг берет свое
пацан попутал....дал сторублевками Дженифер Лоуренц....)RIP
Тратят кучу бабла на съемки, а у самих даже в трейлере ошибки.
Лоуренс ни разу ни похожа на русскую, и она слишком жирная для балерины. Ну и адовый набор клюквы, конечно
0:25  переснимете этот эпизод, не позорьтесь.  Не может такого быть, шалава за 2 бутылки водки, ахаха. Не такие есть, но они вокзальные шалавы, с опухшей мордой, не в гостинеце точно. Там должны быть доллары. Минимум 5 000 рублевые банкноты.
Black Widow is Red Sparrows sister.

NHS hospitals are decent in fairness

Tommy boi you've made trending again congrats dude
You are a really pretty girl Alice! Don't put your self down. Do I have to take you to Specksavers?
Bullshit
Tom get another box or 2 cats are very territorial
Those cats speak better English than your fucking ass.
Toms been on his knees to much. Little bitch.
Bruh you need a beard transplant
you should set up a 'shit cam' live stream to catch the cat that is shitting on the sofa.
9on trending omg
Kitty cats they are Scottish fold  kitty cats
It's like a horse getting hock and stifle injections 😂

My brother has 4 types of tendencies in his shoulders because he's pulled them out multiple times. I've pulled both out twice. Funnnnnn.

Why don't you just put over some Blankets on the sofa when you go to bed or away :D
hi James franco
I went to see it and I was shitting myself 😂
The pain could be a reactant to the medicine.
Where is syndicate wife
#3 on trending xD
Lydia is back!!!!
Every Vlog from now on I am going to write this <3 Day 169!
Not really spoilers when the movie is a remake
Awesome vlog great to see Lydia is doing okay👍😎👌
i said ages ago when the knee pain started to occur that it was patella tendinitis, and i was correct 😂
Tom just get a blanket or something to cover the couch until the cats stop pooping
The return of Lydia
The Movie IT is just chapter 1
The film wasn't made to be scary as hell..it was made to tell the story of the losers club! Like in the bloody book. Getting right tired of people seeing this film because they thinks it's just another horror film. It's so much more than that
Tom just get a throw for the sofa's so it dont go on the sofa!
OMG ON TRENDING!!!!!!!
Love the old British Vloggers
These comments are disgusting, Syndicate donates money to charity and helps people, then you guys be pricks. Btw 3 of the people so far are Jake paulers, cancer.
Yooo it's trending
Every month for 2 weeks they delayed it good England tom
4th on trending wow 👌
#4 trending gg tom
Lol @trending getting triggered, luv ya Tom
If you have a room that you're not using, you should put a load of cat stuff in it, and when yer out put them in that room and close the door😃
I don't know why I dislike toms cats so much but I do
happy that lydia looks healthier and better
to make your cats stop pooping on the sofa, get another cat litter box. Cats usually prefer their own litter box and if they are pooping on your sofa, they're letting you know.\n1
I like how Tom has a gymshark hoodie on but he never goes to the gym ;)
Who do the doodoo
So does syndicate not upload gaming videos anymore or is he just busy? Just curious if anyone knows
Ever had a needle in your eyeball? Not so painful as they sedate the skin, but I never forgot the grape being punctured. All for eye lasering...
The iPhone 7 plus 256 gb is $1000
Hope you have cancer
To. Tom you need to try zizi's in the Trafford centre 👌👌👌👌👌👌
Even though it squeaks, I want it plus the bed. If u 10 second skipped wrong there you'd be in for a wtf moment
Was only half listening to the explanation for the reason for going to the doctors at the beginning. Was mostly watching the kittens in the corner of the screen watching Tom's hand XD
What movie did he watch?
i have tendonitis in my right knee it sucks btw
For real tho, maybe you should chill with the twitch sub shoutouts. I get that it's something nice you want to do for loyal twitch fans (and keep doing it if you do please) but as someone whose been watching since when LoT was Syndicate Central, it's kind of annoying and disrupts the vlogs...
Life of Tom do you live in Glasgow
I tore a ligament in my knee almost a year ago and it was meant to be healed months ago but I still have to get an MRI scan
What is Alice's instagram?
One of the actors in IT, Nicholas Hamilton, is from my school, Alstonville high from Australia
Ngl. Tameside Hospital staff are getting worse 😂 they're not even telling you they're gonna stab you now 😂
tom! if you put tin foil on the couch while you're not using it the cats will stay off of it saving your couch!!
Tom, I always love your VLOGS. Just classic and EPIC
Does anybody else have trouble loading the merch link. I've been trying to get a sweatshirt for days but the link won't work.
Hello Tom if that happens don't eat pig lots or ever
New iPhone.....old Samsung technology
Congrats Tom you are 3rd on trending
You look like oli white
That's quite a small needle for a join injection! You lucked out mate
Watching from A&E with a broken collarbone 😅 I watched the whole vlog twice 😂
Why is everyone hating on Tom and the video because it's trending? It just means a lot of people are watching it that's it.
Get a Bluetooth camera and put it near the sofa
Trending.
Liderally
Is your sister single? She low key pretty.
I miss yote :/
Just how credible is an Indian medical certificate? It seems every GP in England is an Indian who did their medical studies in India.
For anyone who replies to this is tom married it's been years since I've watched him so if I could please get a answer that would be great thanks
The iPhone X shouldn't actually be £1000 apple just decided to charge that amount it should be about £750
When they say 1000 pound is heaps for the iphone, its 1800 here
Why did you capitalise needles?
You need to take some editing classes to make your vids more exciting to watch
Yo tom you need to start telling off the kittens and 'punishing' them for doing bad things, not punishing badly just like telling them off and stuff. We did it to our cat and now it hasn't shit on the Sofa for like 3 years
Your audio sucks. Get better equipment
Is hernandez being played out of position and does he know he's being played out of position ?.
I love this channel . Dan Lawless please get rid of this battery operated microphone it's ruined the interviews .

The audio is toilet. Like your team
Lol! One of the fans tried to push me off the train and he didn't even move me 😂😂
I agree we didn't have a game plan which is often the problem with Bilic. only reason we kept the ball a lot is because they allowed us to. Says a lot when our best effort was Obiangs long ranger and stop play our best goalscorer in years on the wing FFS

The btec aftv
Board and Bilic OUT! 😣
Unpopular opinion but I would have kept snodgrass and got rid of Ayew instead, has Ayew actually had 10 decent games for us? Should have given snodgrass until January to see whether he could rediscover his hull form
How is this shit trending
This channel is shit full of cunts
This is just a couple of losers trying to be rich, copying Robbie
West ham sucks
Have fun in the Championship next season
How the fuck can you be the better team with no game plan 😂 retards
That smile ahhhh IT gives me chills
he looks just like Steve Buscemi
hhhahahaha rly funny. it reminds me of my childhood when my brother scared me with his ugly face
When a girl talks to me this is my immediate smile
Bill skardgard has got a naturally scary face he could make a real good Joker
Now I know why his name is Skarsgard.
I'm in love with him.
0:52 when i see my friend's mom :)
i can do the smile
For Some reason i'll Repeat this Vids Many Times😂
I love his dad.
that is one rapey face
Here comes the 0:53 jokes now
He could be the next joker in batman
someone needs to draw that face he chased his little brother around with
There’s just somethin’ about that beaauuuuttiful smile
I can do the same lip thing & its funny my brother can do it to.
He is the next JOKER, he has to be man
i can do that too wow he's brother is a beast
He literally looks like my friend all growned up wtf.
It's supposed to be scary but damn he fine!!! 😍😭
He’s so cute 😭😭❤️
and he would be like 'not again!' LOL
Admit 'IT' you tried to do the lip thing too
He's cute anyway I'd marry him
Drag me down the sewers, daddy
Damn, He should be the next joker.
IT was the best movie   😂
He's got the supidest bottom lip...
Soooo.... Who's hotter?\nSuicide squad's The Joker or Pennywise from IT *2017*
Oh my god Bill will be perfect for The Joker
is it weird that i can do the exact same thing with the lips and i am swedish?
Ppl from sweden and Norway are easier to understand than brits. It's funny because it's not even their primary language
This will become a meme someday
My mOM is better than you lmaooo, She could to that smile (;; very weird tho..
He reminds of Victor from the Corpse Bride
Dang, I got scared just looking at the thumbnail...
Who else is trying to try to do the smile???
His skin is so smooth.
This always makes me smile 😁
You know, KSI could pull off an IT smile as well XD
He looks like a young CGI version of Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn
So basically, Bill turned himself into the great cornholio to chase his little brother x)
And they all float?
I dont think he needs make up to do the role
Such a nice guy. So humble. I also love Conan for being so friendly and cool to his guests.
That smile is hot seriously
Omg. He's gorgeous. I am going to feel very confused the next time I watch the movie.
He looks creepier than the clown to me honestly, Im serious
He looks like harry styles
I legit broke down in tears when he mentioned Gustaf. I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!
OH NO HE'S ATTRACTIVE
Clown come to me
You're not a monster.
i'm sorry he is nothing scary he looks too cute to be any scary i'm really disappointed
please watch my it drawing :)
When he played in Hemlock Grove 😍 now this 😘
Get in there, can we see that?
Man talk about a nightmare smile
Isn't this guy swedish? If so, AWESOME!
0:51 when he's starting to turn towards you and the feeling in your heart ahhh
I can do that
For a guy I've known through watching Swedish movies, he's really stepped up his acting game.
GODDAMNIT VALTAR SKARSGÅRD’S BROTHER!!!!
wow so scary... not.
LOL

HELLO FRIENDS!! i dove back into the sea of ~wish~ once more to see what all this free stuff was about... are there any other strange websites you would like me to try?
It's not an armpit boob... It's a pit tit!
Shopping for bra \nReview : my child *loves* it 😂😂
I've been getting merch from Wish and I love it so far, I've gotten 10 things I believe
okay not being creepy here at all, but...\n\nnice butt.
I noticed with wish that the non clothing options normally stay free and clothes change depending on size even when it's not free
It's a good marketing technique ... free plus ship is extremely common in business. The product will cost $2 to make, therefore you can deem it as free & charge $4 in shipping .
When you add the items to the cart it adds the price with the  shipping cost
I wish I could get free stuff all the time
Just got a wish commercial. ._.
Because the over charged for shipping!
I'm sat here at 4:23am laughing at safiya saying who is buying medium orange 5:01 🍊
I bought the first 5 things pinterest suggested for me
You should do a Wish video where you order the first free thing you see under tops, bottoms, accessories, shoes, etc and make a full outfit! That could be fun. (I already wrote this as a reply on my old comment, but wasn't certain if you check replies. 😅 Love you, Saf!)
I just bought a pack of chokers for £1.95.  Can’t wait    Wish is a good app
i love you but for some reason it really annoys me when you say shamash that like button
Ummm, they are not free... The price of the product is included in the shipping. :q I'ts just a little marketing thing for stupid people.
You reading the product descriptions is my fave part omg hahaha
In the End when you Said They still did cost it was the shipping that costed
You should do Everything £5!!
You should read the product reviews and look for pics, that’s how I order from them.
I was so curious about this website. Thank you so much for sharing what the products vs expectation were.
Lol my cousin just bought a shirt like that but it's red and open and pull done pocket it has a little middle finger lol
Try the first 5 almost gone items on your Wish browse page!
What do you use to record what’s you’re doing on your Mac or iPhone
I hate thay she speaks like a robot.
I think another thing to realize is the value of the dollar in other countries. Items typically cost a few cents to make in other countries which is why many companies manufacture in China. Wish probably takes some of the cost for the product out of the shipping.
can you please do a romwe haul or something similar? i know you already do a lot of that kind of thing with wish but they just have so much stuff thats SO discounted im worried about if theyre legit and a lot of people ive talked to say the same thing because its supposed to be really high quality and every thing but im skeptical and i trust your opinion of this stuff
My mom days if I get all a's on my report card 😊 btw a wish ad played on this video
PLEASE DO ALIBABA as A cosplayer Ive gotten only wigs off it before hehe
It says it's free but you have to pay shipping.🙄 Also they just add the price of the item to the shipping so they can say free, its so annoying especially that the items are the worst quality ever.
Omg wish is amazing! I have like 60 items in my wish list, for diy projects, or makeup stuff to test
I have that phone case 😂 I love it!
LOL I,GOT A WISH AD
I love how she reads the titles of the products 😂😂
Do a full face of wish makeup!!
Why is everyone suddenly interested in wish, its been around forever.
Litteraly everything that says free has a shipment cost of either more or the same price of how it used to be priced at
I have a question is wish like amazon but cheaper because I don't want it to be like eBay cuz u can get scammed
I have those red shorts they are super cute
You should do the first 5 things that pintrest gives you plz!!\n\n\n\nIt would make my day
Those shorts look exactly like the kind the volleyball girls would wear in HS or the cheer squad when practicing....\n\nThey also look like Japanese gym shorts... so not bad but I don't like gym shorts or short-shorts personally.
Hah before the video, I just got a wish ad. 😂😂
My number one rule for shopping online is to never buy clothes. Especially from wish. Bcz it is directly shipped from China (or anywhere else in asia) the size chart is different. So like and XL there is like a M here
okay, i don't know if this is rude by saying this but, the pettiness for the free items. I don't know if anyone else noticed
Wish CAN be a bish
you should make a Romwe haul
please review romwe! Idk, it kinda seems like a scam, but please try it! P.S. I love how you read the whole name of the products 😂😂
Before I watched this a Wish ad came on XD
Free isnt free ,its just 1$ items for2$ shipping ,while it was 1$ shiping
I like buying stuff from wish not really clothes a lot, but when I got a shirt it was actually good quality. But I buy items from it more <O> Like fun gadget shtuff
phone case is verified cos that glitter thing is leaking out from the case and burning people hands lol, im ordering from ebay ali and wish so many years i became an expert of this crap :D
So I saw one if your vids like a month ago and yt always drops out your vids to me to watch, and I was like meh, no. Two days ago a saw another one and i watched it, now I've seen most of your videos, and I just can't get enough 😂😂 love you
I think the free promotions work by the company buying a product in wholesale for prices as low as $2, and then by charging you for shipping they make a profit off it
They only offer free stuff after you've made previous purchases. Sort of like a loyalty thing.
Sometimes on wish you only have a certain amount of time for it to be free or discounted.
Who else got a Wish ad before the video?
Isn't wish just taobao? As in for non-chinese people?
I'm surprised that Cristine didn't comment 😂
I got a wish add right before this! lol
i have looked all over wish and i could not find any thing that was free the lowest it would go was $1
I bought a beach dress from Wish and I am not gonna buy from that site again.
Its not really free if you pay 2-10$ for shipping 😂
Can you please do a wish video where you buy the things with the same picture but different prices?
I'm literally wearing the same shirt as you
Thanks for the video, I just got the app and had noticed the same thing and wasn't sure why.
Actually, if it says free, it means they added the original price of the product to the shipping fees. I compared some stuff for free in my account and when I logged out, the original price appeared and the shipping cost was less so I figured out that NOTHING is for free on Wish! They just know how to manipulate people.
here i am. here's my shoulder. LOL.
I got a freaking wish pop up ad for this video
Fuck consumerism.
Its free 99 XD

People, stop commenting perverted things. You guys are so nasty. 😣😣
Nick's arms lookin good he looking good in general😍
James is me 😂😂😂
Nick Jonas you sweet, sweet angel
Nick's muscles... OMG he's so hot!!!
Why do they always do that weird thing at the start when there like yeah hi but I'm not going to saying anything funny until everyone is quite.......
Things you gotta do to promote your SONG!!
is he playing in a movie or does he just want to get huge ?
Nick Jonas stole my heart when I was only 14 and still does the same <3 :)
Saw him live last year...it was amazing!
The way he cleaned that pastry...
he's hot but I miss the slimmer version of him, beautifully perfect now he's a bit chunky... well hot anyways
The great guitar master xD
Oh how I wish he was an intern at my firm...
The reason he's so damn buff is probably because he played an MMA fighter in the TV show Kingdom. He's seriously ripped in the show. Its actually a decent show-turns out the kid can act and very well actually. Unfortunately it only has 3 seasons but its still worth watching.
He's so hot ugh
Is it me it or does his voice sound different?
The only guy that i think is the most humble person ever.
between 1d and nick jonas james is living every girl's dream. \nmaybe not every girl but sure as hell mine!
The way the shirt wrapped around Nicks muscles...  Oh child 🙌
IF NICK JONAS GAVE ME TAT PASTERY I WILL LOVE TO EAT IT HAHAHAH
Holy fuck Nick... you are so goddamn fine! Jesus
I like how James Corden looks so suprised when they walk in 😂
Nick has gone puffed up eh?? I like it❤😂
james is living the life I wish nick jonas would touch me 😤💦💖
Just let him do the thing
OKAY HOW CAN I GET TO HAVE NICK JONAS ~THING?
James should get out of the closet already
BUFF!!!!
Nick Jonas has and always will be my favorite Jonas Brother.

James must of had a erection. Laying on the table. With nick Jonas messaging you. With those big strong arms 😂
Can I get that pastry???😂😍😍😍
Oh god, the amount of office rules I'll break when he interns at my work

This was really bad.
¿why my husband Nick Jonas are giving you a message?..
There is no need to worry, for God loves you all\nThursday, 8 May 2014 @ 23:30\nMessage 1120\nMy dearly beloved daughter, look around you and you will see many people living carefree lives.\nYou will see laughter, joy and great comradeship and you will know that only this can come from God.\nMany people, once they know the truth, will embrace me with open and grateful hearts and then we will be one.\nMy plan is to gather all and flood them with great love, joy and happiness.\nI will delight in my new Kingdom and there will be much laughter, joy and beauty, as well as eternal life.\nLove will exude from every single creature; every single soul and life will be perfect.\nWhen you worry about the future of the world, remember what I have told you.\nAll will be well, once I come to gather you, into the new world, without end.\nThere is no need to worry, for God loves you all.\nAs for souls who live a deprived and sorrowful life, they will be gathered first, if they accept who I am.\nThose who are in terrible darkness will be given \nextraordinary graces to cleanse their souls, so that I can loosen the \ngrip of the evil one over them and take them into the safety of My \nMercy.\nThis is a battle and it will be hard fought, but the \npower of the Most Holy Trinity will be exerted and \n                 souls will be \nenlightened, so that they will not perish.\nI will raise important leaders amongst you and with an\n army spread in every nation, you will swell and take with you most of \nGod’s children, into the New Paradise.\nLook to me with trust and do not fear My Love, for you\n must know that I would never willingly frighten you, because when I \nmake my presence known, it will fill you with great wonder and joy.\nI assure you, there is no need for fear, for I am love, itself.\nLove will soothe you and when you face me, Your Jesus,\n you will be struck with a sense of instant familiarity, which is only \npresent when your heart becomes entwined with mine.\nHow I love you all and how I yearn for your souls.\nYour Jesus\n\nShare this:
So amazing XD

Newbie here. She has a video of her own red lipstick. The link doesn't work! Where can I get it.
Please try Limelight by Alcone foundation.....I see a lot of people selling it and I am so curious about it!
That swatch looks a bit yellow to be for cool toned skin
Can you do a review on this  Foundation Sonia Kashuk® Soft Focus Satin Matte Foundation
Hey!!! Love this video series!!!!
I totally love this channel.. but it seems we hear about you getting your nails, hair, eyelashes, massages, facials,  etc. A lot! Lol.
I remember when Taylor had 10000 subs
I am a new Subscriber. I appreciate your personality and honesty. So different from a lot of other youtubers.
isnt cool pink undertones contradicting? lol
Have you ever tried No 7 Beautifully Matte foundation? I think it's my all time current favourite for my oily skin!
Have you ever tried flower beauty's foundation? It's Drew Barrymore brand.
Am I the only one who likes to wait till the end of the series and binge watch? I can't just watch one of her videos!
Just found this channel because of this series! Love your make up videos!
Hey I'm new to your channel but after watching a nude lip video and your 15 days series, I'm officially a subscriber!!! So excited to be part of the family and to half a fair-skinned buddy! ❤
So which one of the 15 was ur favorite foundation?! Lol
Your voice is so calm and monotone, in a good way, I love your vibe 💕
I have a Burt's bees bb cream & its stinky at first from Noni fruit.
I saved this one to watch  til now because it was the last one lol so sad it's over 😣
Thank you so much Taylor for your research! All your vids are short, simple and informative. Hope you are having an awesome time in London! Be safe!
You are always beautiful!!  This foundation looked like it yellowed there at the end, as well as was very thick. Took a while to oxidize! Thanks for the great information on all your videos!!  @~}~~~~
I really wish you would do an all time top favorite foundation video!  I have pretty much the same skin for and I want to find my holy grail foundations! Love this series it helps me a ton!
I don't think you have a video on 💄kokie skin perfect hd $12.98💄can you please try it 😘
Can you do a video of your all time favorite primers and the foundation that pair really well with them? I used urban decay primer with makeup forever foundation and it came out super patchy and it looked horrible :(
This time went by too quickly! For some reason I thought this was day 14 and was so confused when day 15 never came 😂
Heyyy
Heey
I found your channel through this series! hey!
I feel bad when you get a foundation you don’t like. I always feel crusty and weird when I try a foundation that doesn’t work for my skin lol. Love your reviews btw❣️
I think you can try the bareminerals remedy powder foundation or tom ford powder foundation
Love ur videos! \nWas wondering if u could do a video of ur fav top 5 or 10 foundations overall, of everyone u have tryed. Also I was wondering if u had any recommendations on a YouTube channel that is like urs only for more acne/dry skin?
My I give a suggestion, next time you do 15 days of foundation, don't do such a long intro. I want to see you put the foundation on sooner!!! Love you!!!
I stumbled upon your channel last week and since then I've been binge watching 15 days of foundation. I've already watched through TWO seasons. LOL sooooo good. Also I've purchased THREE foundations already based on the videos. Which is NOT good for my wallet. but I'm super excited to get these foundations and try them!!
Thanks for the video!!! I love your reviews!!!
Super glad I found you! Your energy matches my own and tho I don't have ache I do have what is called milia so it makes my skin super textured and it's left me pretty self conscious but your videos kinda taught me that yeah, I can work with it tho it helps alot <3 love and good vibes to you!
I feel like I cannot buy a foundation without watching Taylor review it first. I haven't found many other youtubers with pale/problem skin just like me.
One of my biggest problems with oily skin is transfer... do you think you could show how each foundation transfers? Even if it's showing your phone after putting it up to your face lol thanks!
Hey Taylor! Long time baerrito here yet it's my first time actually commenting and requesting for a review haha 😂\n\nMay you please review the new It Cosmetics lineup of products in like a foundation friday or a first impressions video 😊\nEspecially the full coverage+skincare from the Bye Bye Redness and Bye Bye Breakout lines\nSeems like they'll be good for sensitive and pimple prone skin 👌🏻\n\nThank you so much and thank you for all the hard work you put in your videos! Really enjoyed this season of 15 days of foundation 💕\nSending love from the Philippines 😍🇵🇭
Thank you for all your hard work. Have a great trip!!
Loved the series. Keep up the good work
Omg i just saw this at the store and almost bought but it is expensive for a drug store foundation, $15.99 here at my local Walmart. So glad u are reviewing this!!!
Do you like any foundations?! Lol
You look like a female version of Ronnie from Falling in reverse
You should try Missha's Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++. You can find it at Target, Amazon, or other online stores that sell Kbeauty items.
What about full face in Mary Kay makeup.
The burts bees BB cream! Please!! I have a love hate relationship with it particularly because I'm still trying to figure out the best way to wear it.
I binged these videos in 2 days... glad I waited till after you were done
I love Burts Bees lip balm in the winter months for chapped lips, and I've been using their cotton extract face wash for a few months and love it, so I had high hopes for this one. As soon as you said it had a bad smell, that was it for me. 👎🏼 Thanks for the review, Taylor! ❤️ #baerittofam #snapchatfam
05:10
Please do a review of the glossier foundation!
I was on Sephora looking at UFO Sunday Riley Oil because I had gotten a sample and liked it.  The video suggested to mix a bit with your foundation for those with acne. Ever tried U.F.O products?
Do you think you could start including a drugstore foundation or two in the comparison swatches? Just for people who stick to drugstore makeup. Back when you included Maybelline Matte + Poreless in 110 it was useful. Revlon Colorstay in Buff would also be a good comparison that lots of people know. Thanks, loved this round of 15 shades of foundation!
I'm new! Saw you on trending! Will definitely watch the rest of this series
Can't wait for the wrap up video now that 15DOF is over. Not going to lie. I'll probably buy whatever your top 2 are 😂❤❤ #snapchatfam
I can totally hear the sponge pats on your face this time, it's highly amusing XD
Taylor, I've noticed that when you do your swatches you pause for a couple extra seconds at the end-- and I LOVE THAT!! Thank you for doing that!! It gives me that extra second to look and compare! 👍🏻 I love FDOF but holy shitzees, I can't wait for a shadow and shmooze!! 🌯💙 #baerittos #snapchatfam
You look ill with all the make-up
Please try marcelle makeup! There's not many reviews on it and I really love the brand for the most part!
Please do a review on... \nCLINIQUE Even Better™ Glow Light Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum SPF 15
By far my favorite YouTuber 👌🏻❤️
Found you through the series and definitely gonna stick around ! :) :)
what are you 5 top/favorite foundations? Thank you
Where's the wrap up video? I need to know what I need to go buy!!
I watch so much Taylor that when I got a sample of the FAB intense hydration cream I was like oh perfect ill put it on the dry patch on my forehead a started to and then realized that I dont have a dry patch on my forehead?????? whoops
So depressed that you won't be making my day better everyday😭😭
This foundation has looked terrible  in many of the reviews I have watched. I will definitely be passing on this one.
So sad it's over!!!
I tried the burts bees bb cream and it was awful. It made my skin look terrible and it had a heavy floral scent, I think all burts bees products have some sort of scent to them which is kind of annoying.
Whoah, nice, this video is trending!  I'm so happy your channel is really taking off!  Yaaaay!  Also, thank you for another super awesome !5 days of foundation.  Looked forward to every single video and loved them all.  Thank you, thataylaa!
Have you tried the Dior Forever Perfect Makeup Fluid Floundation?
Nooooooo!!!! It's over😩😩😩
GIRL YOU MADE IT TO TRENDING!!!!! CONGRATULATIONSSSS! Btw love 15DOF!!!
I have never bought a Burts Bees product. Ty
The best one IMO opinion was the Two Faced comfort matte foundation it looked super smooth and nice, and I'm going to pick it up!!!
I don't want it to be over 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🌯🌯🌯🌯🌯
The Baerritos always seem to be awesome!  Love the positivity!! And welcome all the new Baerritos (Taylor looks like you picked up a lot of new fam along this series)
You should do a full face using makeup from Wish! Or do a review on Makeup brushes from Wish! (Only the products that are Wish Verified, though!)
I got deported from London :/
I'm just so thankful for this series. I have a really hard time finding a good foundation for my skin type and colour since I have really bad texture and I'm extremely pale, so thank you soooo much :)
At the end the foundation makes her face look a completely different color than the rest of her body...
I'm a new burrito! Love your videos!
My first time watching your 15 days of foundation series and I loved it! Cant wait for the next one.
Taylor I'm sure you probably already know this but I wanted to comment just incase any of your subscribers didn't know that Milani now has a very pale shade porcelain . It's too matte for my dry maturing skin but I think so many younger ladies with oily skin would love it. It's full coverage and only $8-$10.
I found you through this series. I love that you're so honest and I have been binging your videos lately!
YOU MADE IT TO THE TRENDING PAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!
can you do a video comparing all the stick foundations you have tried?
I am brand new to your channel I am now binge watching
ok
What foundations do you recommend for really dry skin? I have dry patches on my cheeks😞😞😞
Please do a full face of ZuZu Cosmetics or 100% pure!! <3
Hey! 💕
@thataylaa do a review on matchco pls

Kys thot
Taylor, I just recently found your channel.  I love your videos. Pale skin sisters! Actually I have alot in common with you, pale skin, migraines, also burritos are life. Like for for real.... My fav food group is burritos/tacos.
Hey Lovely people, I'm loving reviewing these sites and experience and sharing the good, the bad and the ugly with you all! I've linked most of the items in the description box for those asking, however they often sell out or are removed on ebay! Hope you enjoy and see you on Sunday for my next video xx
Anyone needing English-to-Dutch translation of their website, app, various articles, message me. Depending on size, translation is free! \n\nI am a university student in International Communications from Belgium.
A lot of people have straight up copied your format with these videos and that's to be expected; it's YouTube after all but I love how of all the videos I've seen, only ONE person gave you a shout out for the inspo (Tierra Monet) 😂😩 stingy asses
Love your videos just started watching recently x
you're so pretty !!!!
The barney stinson meme is my life
Your closet must be packed with amazing goodies!! ✨✨
How do all the shoes look good on you man... every time I put something on I feel like all you can see of me is feet. Like im a foot, not a person lmao
Pricing is so random because of currency exchange
I like your video.Please you can try somthing from  -  ioffer -
Fast, cheap fashion usually comes at a price. That is, underpaid, overworked women and children in sweatshops.
What is the link for the white yeezy boosts?
I love the commentary
please Patricia.  Stop playing with my heart and tell me how to get hair like this!
What's the hype of Yezzys?
Patricia could be a stripper in those over the knee boots 😂\n\nLove you Patricia 💖
dhgate is the best site for yeezys
Wait so why did I get a Spanish Colgate ad ?
Where did she get the shirt from?
When she started comparing the Fenty's I fell off the damn couch laughing so hard 😂😂😂 You Slay my life omg!!!
You sound like Mel B. So cute
You should try TigerMist! It's an Australian store but I've always had great experiences with them!
Your hair looks so good!! Omg😍😍
Thanks Patricia for this video. Some people just think ebay is bad by it really isn't.
Could you please add the yeezy link?
I don't trust ebay
I've watched multiple haul type videos of ebay and such and she is definitely my fav. You're entertaining and authentic it's nice :) your waaooows are so aww hahaha girl I like you
And I'm offended 😭😭 love her
Can you please put the name of the seller of the yeezy boost ?
I love the short hair on you! ❤️❤️❤️
I cried when she pulled out the Fenty sneaker alternative lmao
I dunno what you did, but you are looking fleeky in this video!
where'd she get the yeezys
Lmfaoooo she's just so sweet
Where on eBay did u find the yezzys and can you reply with a link 🙏😂
Loooove the boots.
The yezzys on ebay arent real most of the time, chinese companies know the resell price and sells replicas for the price. Because legit cream whites go for 450$ canadian, a giant gap from your purchase sorry :(
The hook from your toes being squished comment 😂😂😂
You had me rolling at the end with that last shoe lmao
do a forever 21 video ❤️
Patriciaaaaaa!! I'm glad your subscribers are increasing everyday. Can you do a little something in honor of your OG subscribers?? Like just chatting or relationship stuff. I feel fatigued by all of the spending you do lol. Not hating, but I love hearing your thoughts on life and stuff like that. Your latest videos are making me feel poor and quite demodée rofl 😂😂😂😂
Hey, I am a shoe plug. Comment the best way to get in contact with you if you're looking for legit yeezys, Balenciagas, and more
Is anyone else seeing MacyDress on their Facebook page & do you think it's legit?
I loved the heels in the end , some in black would look so beautiful 💖
Did you buy something from sportsdirect.com sometimes? :-)
is her hair textured? its really bouncy and smooth looking..
the last ones finished me!
I'm laughing so hard, And I'm offended. Dead.
That hair. (In Patricia's voice) haiiii haaaiiii haiiii🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🤛🏽👌🏽
Love her hair!!
Im really excited, which is most of the time. shes so cute omg
The over knees were okayish,but a thicker legged person, would have a bit of a struggle.
Smells like burning fire smells like chemicals you could get high on I cried 😂😭
She didn't list the yeezys in the description box
...and I'm offended. Best line of the video. Thanks for sharing your ebay experience with us!
aw this was posted on my birthday
If you don't have anyone to give those shoes to can I have them. The Ruby red first shoes size 11 @patriciabright
try ioffer!!! i've had loads of stuff off there like michael kors etc x
How many bills you spent on the yeezys
how tall are you?
Hi...do you have the eBay link for the boost
Girllll I've only just discovered you and omg I just love you so much already wow
Where is you necklace from please?
Hi there! I have been enjoying your reviews recently, and would like to know if you could review JustFab.com? Thanks.
If you want cushion get you some dr shawls for the tall boots for the insides👍🏽💯
The yeezys are not real
The Yeezy's are fake
Awesome video! :D I am a shoeholic, shouldnt watch any shoereviews as they make me wanna buy more :D
she is so funny!
or you went to Florida and stole them....
Hi Patricia proud you make so much amazing video that's impressed me and so much very lovely and very very interesting so I just have my own YouTube channel I would like for you to give me a time so thank kiss 😘
I buy a lot of my shoes off of eBay and am always happy with my purchase. I never have anything wrong with the sizing so I don't know what happened with you!! Some nice shoes though!
I love love love your hair Patricia! It's gorgeous! 💕
You can get those exact heels (the burgundy shown in the picture) on lolashoetique.com Along with plenty of other cute heels

Rest in Peace Harry

RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
Beautifully done. I never knew he was a singer.
What a man. What feeling his face and voice conveyed.Today is for crying, but all the tomorrows will be for celebration of a beautiful life well lived.
REST IN PEACE  MR. STANTON,  LONG LIVE YOUR TALENTS  🕊😔⚘🎵🎥💕
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. You were loved.
RIP Harry. Thank you for sharing your talent for so many for so many years. Til the other side...
Rip Harry
Fifty years ago I went to the pictures to watch Cool Hand Luke  and I enjoyed him singing Just a Closer Walk With Thee which was brilliantly evocative, and very apropos. I think that was the first time I'd ever heard a religious song that wasn't dull. This clip is good, VG considering his age and the effects age has upon the vocal chords.\nHe should have sung more during his career.
He was great in Repo Man.
wow!! so long Tramp, you done damn good!! rest in peace Mr Stanton.
good-bye Harry Dean Stanton, The screen will never see your like again
Rest in peace Harry. You were a multi talemted performer and we enjoyed every minute with you.
You did it, my friend. You lived a full and complete life. It's a pity that we have only one to life to accomplish it.
rest in peace, dear Harry..  i loved you
Powerful ..... on the same level as Johnny Cash cover of Hurt... RIP.

Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
He still has a presence
Lovely.  I used to know Dean.
Mashed me up ♥
Like it:)
the hot glue is melting the polystyrene\n\n**proceeds to use hot glue to stick wool to the polystyrene**
that's actually not too bad
i am afraid for my life
It looks like a deformed Harry Styles from when One Directiom were still together
It's like watching Art Attack
Your clone kinda resembles Wybie Lovat.
the minute he said: sure I'm gonna be there in fifteen minutes. I could say by he's voice he's not going! 😂😂😂
hey PJ....my perfect clone has better grades that me....
The star fades in the beginning killed me, pure gold Pj xx
Pj is currently my favourite youtuber. He is so creative!
PJ: It's gonna get weird.\nTiny Planet Explorers: Yep. Wouldn't have it any other way!
The clone of pj has hair that  kinda looks like noodles!
I'll never get over PJ wearing glasses <33
It looks like girls at my school
I think we're watching a psychopath
Crafting in the club 😤
E X I S T E N C E I S M E A N I N G L E S S W E A R E A L L F A L L I N G D O W N A L O N G S P I R A L S T A I R C A S E O F D O O M
THERE. THAT INTERLUDE SONG. WHAT IS IT I NEED TO KNOW FOR SCIENCE.
What is the name of the track that plays in his video?
Kind of disturbed....but you know, he's a professional. So I'm sure it's cool beans.
EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT ABOUT HOW WEIRD THIS IS BUT THEYRE FORGETTING.\nTHIS IS PJ\nWHAT THE FUCK ELSE DID YOU EXPECT
I come here for my weekly doses of weird and I am very much satisfied 😂
I need a man like you
He has he painting that Dan had in his room what
Until he said the clone looked kind of like Harry Styles, I'd never realized that _he_ actually kind of looks like Harry Styles oml
Ummm Harry Styles??? Okaaaaay. Are you looking at the same Harry Styles I am? 😂😜
I honestly forget he's never worn glasses before?
It's really cool that he got Dan Howell to write his outro
he looks so good in these glasses i'm gay
I definitely want to make a making the perfect clone video now too
He mentioned Harry Styles, and suddenly he looked exactly like Harry Styles
I thought it looked like Harry styles too 😅
i know what you're thinking. the pj clone is missing some hair.\n\nyup, spot on.
An antisepticeye collab is what I need in my life
did the people who disliked this think pj was actually doing a tutorial on how to clone yourself or???
You are a strange one. Though I'm sure you already know.
Peej u have glasses now.... PUT THE GLASSES ON THE CLONE!
It's on trendiiiiiinnnnnngggg
What the actual fuck. - which is pretty much every intro to your videos. 😂
Ya know sometimes I really really really worry about him
The hair is the best part
I knew this was going to be a masterpiece when i saw that first star transition
This had the same effect on Peej's fandom as The Memeing of Life did on Dan's and it's so hilarious to watch.
The hair lowkey looks like Harry Styles' hair😂😂
What’d you do for the arms, hands, legs and feet?
Somebody asked me who my favourite youtuber is and I said KickThePJ, I showed them this video and I think they think I'm a weirdo. So... thanks PJ
i made a clone and sent it to work for me
It.....uhm....HE seems the boy of Coraline, isn't it?
Sophie walks in,\nPJ what the- ***remembers its PJ***\nNever mind, PJ
I'm shook I'm watching this in bed and it's picture day
Please stop with the star Transition
What are the chances that PJ is a clone, too, and the real PJ made him so he can film a perfect clone video
0:23 have you lost your mind boooiii  😂
Love this type of your videos
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what nightmares are made of.
Those glasses I need some like them !!
Can anyone tell me the name of the background music / song used at 0:41?? I've been trying to find it for ages.
Where's Wheezy Waiter and his cloning machine when you need him amiright
the hair is the best part
Why does he look like harry styles?
“looks a liitle bit like Harry Styles”
Can you make another Crafting with my son? You + Brad is incredible comedy
where have you been all this time
It's not the perfect clone because you forgot your glasses... But I guess it'll do haha
sometimes his videos get 10x times weirder or stranger... 😂♥️
Pj I have bad news....I think your clone is a bit....defective...
*Oh eyo! Wel-welcome tew Planuf Flesh. We got what you need here. We got planufs from out of this world and in this world. Come on by and grab urself your own diy clone kit diy kit. You have to MAKE the kit before you can TAKE the kit. Eyoooooo.* Planuf Flesh, no we're not a smex shup.
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS HILARIOUS
frick yes this is brilliant
I fucking love all of these star wipes😂😂
is this a jacksepticeye clone or smthin
Best quote of the video: Set your face aside to dry
Hello; and welcome to planet flesh....oh wait that sounds like a sex shop.. hahahaha love you peeeej
Don't have the intenion of following the plans arranged in just 15 Minutes but instead using the time to create a clone. I like that idea
Can someone tell me the name of the song he played at the start - thanks
I mean, the clone ain't wrong
Later that day, Pj gets a copy right strike from Planet Skin.
I can't tell the difference \n\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Are you like me and don't want to get out if the bed in the morning.....\n\n\n\n\n\nI have never related to anything so much in my life.
He looks like whybe from corraline...

#PJ'SCLONETAKESOVERTHECHANNEL
I think we're witnessing the birth of the next biggest stars in music. These two guys have the most creativity and potential I've seen in many years. They are so different from most other artists on the charts today, and the reason is they are incredibly clever (genius, actually) with both the songs and their music videos. They mix their smooth voices with catchy, addictive rhythm, then they enhance this with a video that matches perfectly with the rhythm and progression. The stage presence they had on the Late Late Show with James Corden showed their energy and the clever choreography during the song. They are very, very impressive for such new artists (outside of Pentatonix, that is.) They will be taking the music charts by storm soon, I know it.
I never comment on anything but this literally left me speechless. Absolutely amazing!!
THE END OMFG IT'S THEIR SUPERFRUIT VIDEO SPOT
Mitch looks so fucking good with that mustache
who else saw scotty bumped his head? its at 1:36 people!
I... Love... this... song. It's my favorite one 🔝 your guys are amazing

Mitch looks like daddy. Fuck me up why dont you.
Guys, y'all can do better than this.

Okay LOVE THE SONG but IS THAT THE JACKET FROM DNA??

This Video is also a low key house tour
Obsessed With Scott’s Jacket ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I'm feeling really really good after watching this O_O AMAZING
Has anyone ever thought about what Mitch and Scott's past self would say if they reacted to Future friends part 1/2? It randomly came to my mind and I'm really curious!
Mitch, honey, I love you\n\nbut that pornstach ...
What. I'm in LOVE
2:56 is literally a scene from qaf😍... eh, nostalgia.... The place is huge and absolutely loved the little homage to their youtube channel at the end<3
Mitch please ............please get rid of that moustache please it doesn't suit you please I'm trying to be nice and this is my own opinion
A behind-the-scenes vid for this would be hilarious
I WANT TO HEAR THIS ON THE RADIO
WHEN THEY CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL
Is Scott wearing the same jacket Jimin wears in DNA?
Look at these rock stars.  Proud of these guys.

2:37 my heart
incredible
.*Thumbnail change*
Kirstie's music is derivative and the lyrics are uninteresting and boring, way overproduced.  Your stuff is more interesting, but it all sounds the same, and it's all pop. It lacks lyrical complexity or soul. Avi's music is cute, but we don't need warmed over 60's Donovan, and KO's music is much more interesting, but it sounds all the same.  BRING BACK PTX SOON, PLEASE!
I need mitch and scott to make out
I love Scott's outfit \nSo cute \nYAAAAS QUEENS 👸❤️
Crisis actors and fake reporting of a staged event.
Oooh they were skweeming and skweeming and it was the most awfullest expewience in my hole life!!! Do I get my money now?
More lies from the BBC zionists.\nEmma Stevie ; you are a terrible actress.
Watch more of this phony fake witness here: https://vid.me/mAavy
I know part and parcel is a made up quote, but this is part and parcel of living in cuck town
Everyone gets on at Wimbledon BOI , Most people get on at Earl's Court or West Brompton WTF Where's the logic
Do the people complaining about immigration not realise most of these attacks are done by British Muslims?
such a laughable fake event.
Why there was no cctv,  every carriage has cctv? I want to see cctv of this accident
They really need to come up with better scripts for their crisis actors. It's getting more ridiculous every time they stage an attack.
So basically most people were injured from the stampede and not even the failed bomb. Lesson for people, stop stampeding when you suspect a situation, more people can be killed from a stampede than the actual attack
Can I ask why Emma told Sky news that it was she that lost her trainer yet in this interview she says it was someone else??? Notice how in every phoney fake 'attack' they lose their shoes. Sky helicopter panned onto the platform and lo and behold what do we see ........a pair of neatly placed black shoes and about a metre away a lone trainer. Freemason symbology that means the people participating are doing it of their own free will. Emma managed to mention in this one interview 1. ACID 2. LOST SHOES.3.MEN STRAPPED WITH BOMBS. Not scripted at all eh Emma???
Where do they find theae crappy actors? Why arnt these pillars of the news visiting the 29 injured people in the local a&e why is there a perfectly burning bucket in a plastic bag on a coach majesticaly alight with fairey dust? Sorry ide why is there no damage to the coach or even burn or scorch marks who do the bbc think they are kidding this has to be one of the worst staged terror attacks in history even worse that decrepid old krone zionist may has now raised the threat level so severe whens it going critical? And the ramifications of this act of insanity are mind blowing thats of course if anybody out there is even moderatly sane just observations nothing to worry about. This report has been brought to you all live from bailey rich & divixde and rule news room.
Does anyone believe this?   It is so obviously a drill gone live.
emma stevie still there! helping the news media with their comforting sound bites.
Errm where's the cordon and bomb squad to sort out that bomb that failed to detonate properly lmfao\n\nCome on people move along,\nWalk straight past bomb on your left please.....
I hope it was only liberals who were hurt.
*Europeans in 2039*\n''Shit... We have no where to go..''
This government seems more interested in political correctness than protecting its citizens from these continuous terrorist attacks.
I don't think we should jump conclusions and say that this was done Muslim terrorists. We now have to consider that Far Right extremist/ White power terrorist are now on the rise and fighting back. And if you thought that the Muslims were bad you ain't seen nothing yet.
Time for India to rule england. British govt is incapable of ruling itself and saving it's citizens from islamic terrorists. England needs to be converted to non-abrahmic religions to achieve peace and stability instead of that satanic dead god which they worship.\nbye.
Now she can apply for a bit part in Hollyoaks.
SHOW ME ...  I DONT BELIEVE A SINGLE WORD ...  MILLIONS OF SPY CAMERAS ..MOBILE PHONES ..  I wont believe it till you show the cctv footage ..  not one person without hair/eyelashes/beard/...  K ill H umanati  at it again ..   playing with our minds ...FEAR FEAR FEAR ...   BE AFRAID ...  the  ill/eat ...are afraid .. that's why they do this ..
this is a sad day for England and the injured people will need at least 6 months off work to recover from this,  there was allot of smoke and a loud bang,  as some people had their ears bandaged in other videos and this alone is a 7k payout ,
So BBC who did it ? Oh that's right fake news .
Open Borders and Empathy for Terrorist does Not keep them from Killing You. #DrainTheSwamp

Read that as human centipede at first :D\nAnd on a serious note...bla bla bla immigration bla bla musles fish stick. Thank you. But seriously I am glad nothing too serious happened.
I had no idea you Brits had girls this pretty and intelligent. Maybe it was a mistake for us to fight the revolutionary war for independence from the Monarchy. With girls like that, I think I'm gonna start a petition to rejoin that government and instead of bowing to the Queen, I'm bowing to Emma.
Utter BS!!.I wonder how much she was paid for her extremely poor acting...lol....Why would you even do the noise of the train doors closing....Hahahahahahahahahaha!!
Notice she said we need more people on the underground, see in times like this you're all left to figure it out yourselves. When the unions complain of a system running on minimum numbers they aren't saying it for fun you know.
I just heard that there are 3,000 active investigations of potential terrorists in the UK and another 20,000 that police are concerned about. In the US our FBI has 6,000 possible Isis sympathizers under surveillance. Time to ban Islam and burn all Korans.
It must be horrific to be living your life and then one day a bunch of people show up and terrorise you day in day out!!\nIt's not like it's the1830's!!
I am really insulted by this shit. The BBC are actually saying This is how gullible and stupid we think you are
Wow...pathetic sheep.  Killing each other over nothing.  They were in no danger.  I avoid crowds.  People are very stupid.  This seems staged.
*Look upon the comments and weep*
She has the demeanor of someone talking about their favorite movie and seems to be suppressing a smile throughout the video. Can't say for sure that it's a false flag but yeah, it's a false flag... way to go BBC, fake news since 1922.

So it seems that all of the injuries were caused by the 'stampede' as opposed to the actual so-called 'explosion?'
We don't believe you lying sacks of shit
so the train doors shut, then there was an expolsion and she ran for her life? so presumably she has suoer human traits and can oass through glass?? there were layers of women underneath her screaming..??? not one bit of burn damge in carriage, no smasehd glass, and a smouldering little plastic bucket. a guy who said he was next to the so called bomb was injured? his hair was singed. she is taling aobut crush in a panic. the panic was the issue surely
Emma Stevie works at Delamar Academy, famous for doing make-up for films and TV. What's the connection there? Why isn't she even slightly upset, if she's been in a human pile-up and seen a kid with his face smashed in? Why has she been hanging around all day? Maybe for the free pizza and water, which were arranged in advance for the drill taking place?

People say these are actors which I don't believe. Some people can handle stress better than others and if you get on the battlefield, you'll see what I mean. I have seen people shot in the head and was able to block it out and keep my composure, while others would practically have a mental breakdown and freak out. Seeing people killed with blood everywhere is not something that is enjoyable by any means, but you have to deal with it and move on. In the end we all have to go anyway.
Two days, 77k views, and trending?
I like her English
they have not soul, they are barbaric and uncivilized.  they kill anyone.  they must be deported  and their families and friends.   they must leave our countries and stay away, far, far away.     merkels   ideas.   move with brexit, demand  immediately.  last time i was in england, i did not recognized it.   london is unsafe and  now plagued with terrorists.   do not travel to england.
another staged event  with crisis actors ...who is buying  this bullshit ?
The girl in pink is world famous now...she will be in a movie..will get a book deal. write a book...become a porn star...be at super market openings and dine with the royals...she will commended for her bravery and given a medal..she will be a millionaire by XMAS.
Here is an example of, the dangers of taking in Child refugees from Muslim countries. They become a huge problem as they get older.
It's tough being a Muslim these days. To any fellow Muslims reading this ditch the ugly ass beards you guys have and dress like a regular westerner, that way people won't be able to suspect ur Muslim unless they ask. And females don't wear the hijab. Honestly for my Asian or middle eastern bros and sisters idk what you can do cos u stereotypically look and fit the description of a Muslim. Hope this helps

If you haven’t read my blog before, this “thoughts” category is intended to be a Kanye-style outlet, where I can ramble ’till my poorly edited heart’s content, then click “post”, sharing my thoughts with the internet. It’s really quite amazing I still have a job. LOL.\n\nLOTS of things rile me, but few things as much as Americans who staunchly defend their stoopid constitutional right to own and buy guns. Tossers.

Thanks Islam
I can't wait for the queen of halloween to arrive 😍😍😍
I think you need the next darker shade in shapetape or one that has more yellow undertone. Maybe mixed with something. It just looks slightly too white but who knows, it may be cause the darker foundation or u just might like it like that too lol it just stands out when its not on your chin or forehead. But I love the eye colors. I just bought your lil gimme me brow at sephora the other day!
Love this look! I'll be at Gen Beauty. Can't wait to meet you!!! Warning I might cry lol.
Definitely just gonna go get you in Sephora cuz there are some youtubers that I don't support on that combo box 😅
I'm in Highlands County, most damaged next to the Keys, we just got power yesterday. 9 days but thankful it wasn't worse.
The blush and her brows😣 I feel like they looked better before she filled them in 😭
I missed your makeup videos boo 😩😍😘💕
ava
Girl, I feel you on the brows. I was growing mine out too and I FINALLY got them done last week. I look like a whole new person! lolz. I have faith in you!
omg yass I am glad youre all good ! So GLAD to have you back! cannot wait for your halloween looks , xox
Im glad your back and safe but the blending of eyeshadow in this look is no bueno at all. At the very end when she shows he lip colour you can see the craziness. Way to much blush and too much concealer.  Ayyy :(.
Are those ear rings that are made to look like little gauges? Or are they really little gauges? If they aren't real where are they from? They are too cute
I love the way you look!  I am a blonde with big blue eyes.  Would I be able to pull off this look?
I loved seeing u
I'm glad to know that you and your family are alive and well!! Omg I miss your dark lip tutorials🙈😊!! And This look is amazing!! 😊😊, super excited about Halloween and more!! \nWould you mind telling me the name of the song in this vid?🙈 I love it!!
For one of your Halloween tutorials can you do a glam bride of Frankenstein (: love ya 💕
It took me half the video to realize that your hoops aren't closed! I thought your hair was stuck in them lmao. They super cute tho!
Your look is kind of confusing to me. 1. Your lips are bold but beautiful. 2. Your eyes are intense but beautiful. 3. Those brows are just  fierce girl. 4. The blush is also very bold...I thought in makeup one is supposed to find a focal point and BALANCE the rest. I don’t know where to look as there is so much going on while independently it looks nice. Your face is competing for attention within itself. Nice Halloween vampy look tho.
Nicole where are your open hoops from?
Yes please to Halloween vids 😄😄🕷🕷
The blush is too much for me and emphasises the texture and the eyebrows are way too dark. The overall look is giving me Maleficent vibes for some reason.
I feel like people talk alot about them hoping the hurricame didnt hit them but then it did but not too bad. Like come on..when you are hoping it didnt come your way..it was moving through some.other area and destroyed people's lives. India and parts of africa was under water...waist high but yall out here wishing it didnt hit yall but not caring who it did hit. Smh.
I love u and u always look bomb but mama - those earrings... no boo boo- just no haha
Here's a little tip - if you want to test different makeup brands but don't have the money to purchase all the products then ==gaip.club== is giving away complimentary sample bundles. I got mine 3 weeks ago with no hassle.
When you lost power for 5 days and you couldn't see Nicole's new video and just remembered you missed it! This made my day lol
You're looking good girl 💁🏻so excited for the Halloween videos 🙌🏻
I love it Can't wait for Halloween I'm so excited to see what you have for us
You look genuinely happy and you are just glowing!
Happy that y'all are safe!! Love love love your dark hair and this eye look!!
Lol you got a little lipstick on your tooth momma 😘 beautiful look regardless
The eyebrows 😐
This looks like the one you did years ago. I still love that video
Giving me Nicole 2013 viiibesssss!!!
Yes girl you need to keep those brows under control lol...
Loved this!!  Does anyone know what brush she used for her under-eye concealer?  I can't tell but I WANT IT.  Thanks in advance!
I like your brows girl!!!!
are we not gonna talk about your bedazzled teeth?? I love it😂😂😂
I love love SAVAGE!! You look stunning like always!
Honestly, I forgot about you when this notification popped up. Be more present, girl!
Ahhh so beautiful as always so glad you're safe
Soooo Sooooo Happy that you and your family are Good.
I live near Nicole and I lost power for 3 days and didn't get wifi and cable for 6 days but thank god everyone in our area are okay 😌
Love the eyes but the blush threw off this look way off 😬❤️
Tell us the story about this diamond tooth!!!!
are those halloween nails, or do they always look like that?
I'm so glad you're all safe! I was so worried and glad to have your videos back!😭💜
Also from Florida and can relate to the emotions you have after this storm. We were out of power for almost 5 days. Glad you are safe! 💜
Is water not drinkable out of a tap in America orrrr? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Smoked by a hurricane? ...just the worst way to put devastation I've ever heard is all.
Beautiful
Can't wait for your halloween Tutorials 😍
love it
Hey girl, can you tell me where you got your earrings?? I am loving them.
i couldnt help but to notice that i thought i saw something on your tooth or is it just me? but i love you <3
Hey girl.. sry writing from my sons YouTube channel.. I think you should get a clip mic.. maybe wireless.. that way we can here you lens autofocus.. that's what I do for his channel anyway.
I'm in that eyebrow stage too when I'm ready to just go get them waxed 🙄
chola drag vampire look..
Giiirrrrl! That blush tho, cray cray
yasss bitchhh
I swear, my loyalty to Nicole will never change.
WAMPSN get $10 when u sign up on mercari using this code plus 10% ur first purchase : ) u could get free makeup.
So glad you guys are all safe. But girl bring back the damn vlogs!!!! :)
Glad you guys doing okay. Prayers for florida..
OMG!!! I HOPE YOU GET PREGNANT SOON CUZ YOU IS  GLOWING!!!!!!🤗✨🍂🌙🎃🖤
Omg I feel you, I live in Miami and stayed while hurricane Irma and I ate sooo bad and I broke out like crazy 😑
slaying as always!! love you xx
People keep bringing up about her tooth . She mention a few videos ago she has a diamond on her tooth people !!!!!!!!
What brush did you use to blend the concealer and set it?
Love it! Talk about ur tooth candy when did u get it? Look so cute
Omg I almost thought this was a Halloween look for a witch ... 😭😭😭no I'm not kidding that's my honest opinion I love how she does her makeup I'm not a hater that was my first thought 🤔🤔
I'm trying to grow my brows out too...it's so hard because they look so bad but we can get through this!
I like so much
Omg I love you Nicole,  I can't wait for halloween video!!!
That face texture is real. Idk why people be posting flawless pics of these looks on IG but do you guys see how bad looks in the video? I mean it's not cute.
I live in Lee County Florida and we got a direct hit from Irma. We lost power for 5 days.
I agree on the nude lip..  It's like, and here's what I look  like if I don't put lipstick on.
It's not lipstick on her teeth it's a diamond 😂😂😂😂
Yay hope to see you at GEN beauty. I'm a mother of 4 and a recovering opiate addict I am celebrating my 4 years clean Sunday. I'm so happy I get to go to GEN beauty cause I never get to splurge on makeup.
OMG I hope I can make my dream come true of meeting you this weekend at GEN Beauty!!!! I will be the 1st one on that line!! Love you!!!!
Absolutely loving those nails! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Dumb question but why did you have to hunt for water? Isn't there a tap in your house
All the comments complaining on how she does her make-up... Come on? She is different than you and me. If she likes a more heavier blush SHE CAN, if she wants a lighter under eye, SHE CAN. That's the beauty of make-up, everyone can do what they like!  She did mention her foundation was too dark and went it with to give us an awesome vampy make-up tutorial anyway. She is herself, she doesn't change her ways to satisfy the opinion of others. \n\nCan't wait for Halloween tutorials 🤗🤗👻🕷🕸🎃
This reminded me of Kate Walsh. Idk why. Really pretty
You're a FOX, right from the box...the makeup is miraculous...ya wake up before 8 every day, I'll bet!
Awesome video! Do you have lipstick on your teeth at the end? :)
the blush ruined the whole look but I love the eyes and lips
Did she start stretching her ears? Because if she did thats bomb af.
I love you more than life but this background drove me crazy because it was so close to your skin color 😭
I'm not a vlog person so I'm glad you're back with your good ol' makeup tutorials! AND I LIVE FOR YOUR HALLOWEEN TUTORIALS I'M SO EXCITED.
Glad you guys are good!! I love about and 1hr 49 minutes north of you we lost power thatsunday night @9 and currently are still without it.
You got super lucky. I live here too. It wasn't that it was a cat 2. It's because when it hit Naples Irma decided to head towards Orlando instead of Tampa. If it didn't turn we would really be hurting. I feel very lucky too.
I missed your makeup videos soooo much
Girl I grew my brows out from the end of March to the end of August lmao YOU CAN DO IT
Since you love music you should check out my bros band IN REAL LIFE ! They just released their music video for EYES CLOSED in Times Square
can u please, do a unicorn halloween theme. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😍😍😍😍
Love it!
Wow, I really hate all make-up!

R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
Just saw this movie for the first time. If I knew how good it was, I would've watched it a long time ago.
Harry Dean Stanton, genius character actor who broke through to the lead role in Paris Texas
RIP Harry Dean Stanton, One of the best actors ever.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton! \nOne of the best :(
0:16  My drive to work
You find one in every car,,,
RIP...he lived by the Actor's Code
Just adding my remembrance of Harry Dean Stanton in this essential clip for him from the movie we should thank him most for making, the most GenX cult film, one of the most essential films of the 1980s, and one of the best cinematic depictions of LA ever.\n\nAlways in small roles in so many '80s films that I enjoyed or remembered when I was young. Always added to those films in some way, as the late Roger Ebert noted, even if there wasn't much to add to.\n\nI was pleased to read that he actually kept at it until his death ... I hadn't seen anything with him in it since Anger Management and almost didn't recognize him there because of the makeup (but his voice was one of a kind).\n\nIf you want to see him in a more central role, to see him really show his range, I heartily recommend Paris, Texas. Long but good, from an actor's standpoint.
Damn a lot of comments. Shame people have to die for their work to be recognized......
A character actor who often outshined the star actors. Without Harry Dean Stanton Repo Man wouldn't be as memorable. RIP
RIP Harry Dean\nyou made this movie so great
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You attained Legend Status. Good on you.
Cool Hand Luke  Kellys Heros any movie Harry was in was better for havin him in it . .  .RIP Harry
When I was a kid--- AKA adolescent punk wannabe in the '80s--- I wanted to be the old guy.\nI'm middle-aged now (a bad look for a punk), and I still do.\nNo character actor ever OWNED a movie like Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace, hangdog; see ya in the Big Parking Lot in the Sky....
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton!
Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.  :*(
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Life of a repo man is always intense.
I was in college saw this movie almost every day \nHDS-RIP
night, day? doesn't mean shit...

Only an a$$hole gets killed for a car
Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate 'em.
Yet, despite his disheveled appearance, you get the sense that Bud has a compassionate side to him and, deep-down, he wants to do something meaningful with his life. So he tries teaching Otto all about the repo man trade as fast as possible and, later, dies while trying to get the box. And even Otto comes around to feeling a kinship with Bud at the end by pleading with him, Only an asshole gets killed for a car! This is what makes 'Repo Man' such a great movie--the characters are interesting and you care what happens to them.
R.I.P. Bud
RIP HARRY.

Harry Dean Rulz
Have a nice day\nNight\nNight, day, it doesn't mean shit to me
Come on dickhead!
this film is incredible!  it's a monster mix of laughs and humor
Otto.. he seems to rise above his friends, who are going in the other direction, committing acts of armed robbery.. Repoman, has a code.
Now humans do not have to snort the powder, they only need prescriptions from the medical industries.
I could go for a couple cans of drink right about now.
Harry is such a machine.  Repo Man is a cult classic and that is great dialouge but his delivery makes it even better.
1:35 Ordinary People.....
Speed huh??
Ordinary fuckin' people - I hate 'em.
'movieclips' just for when you thought life had ripped you off enough
Tense situations, kid....
The subtitles on your clips are extremely annoying.
this movie is about farting in a market

Hailee Steinfeld released a song called 'Let me go' MGK released one called 'Let you go'\nCoincidence...or Destiny?

Guys, the audio mix on this is atrocious. If you're going to do more multi-mic pieces like this then you need to get it properly edited and mixed, the audio is really bad for a channel of your stature.
as much as I love star wars, I gotta give kudos to that sweet Pong t-shirt!! Atari rules!!
Please Adam, do not paint your MF...
at the beginning there were 7 and 3 died in the process of building this falcon and only 4 remain to tell the tale
What a bunch of nerds... <3
We have NO IDEA what's in this box... Norm, do you listen to yourself speak, or do you just continually talk with no regard for what's actually being said? I'm voting for the latter.
the set looks awesome but im a little dissappointed with the build. I know this is a model for show only but they could have made some more secure connections around the ship and i dont like how some of the top plate builds just sit and rest. I figured the build would have been solid so that you could pick it up with no pieces falling off and move it around if you needed to...........think i might pass on this and get the lego ghostbusters firehouse instead
No time to fix the mic clipping at all in post, huh?
I would keep all the box art and frame it, but that's just me...
Is Simone not part of the tested team?
ONly $800, for that much you could just buy a 3d printer and print it yourself.\n\nCorrection, at around 10kg you  could buy a 3d printer, print it yourself and still have a couple hundred left over.
Although I hate this particular portmanteau, the set is an instant toygasm!
I don't want one. I want to just build one
At 1:05 Adam mistook the set number for the piece count and at 8:51 he referred to lego bricks as legos. Not trying to be a douche just making an observation.
Please give one of these sets to a fan. I really enjoy legos but its really expensive, especially when living as a student. I havent bren able to build any new sets simply because I can't afford it.
The previous model was about £160. It's the best dolls house and I  only dropped it twice
Wow thank you
So 12 hours for your team. So for me as a solo builder what should i expect? 12 hours times 8 ppl = 96 work hours?
Adam, you broke my heart when you said Legos :-(
now see I want this... but my wallet doesn't
Imagine if your friends drop it
They really didn't put seats in the cockpit?? The one single location in the ship that unquestionably has the most screentime... and they didn't bother to furnish it, or make it large enough to hold the seated figures properly? For $800. Maybe in another ten years they'll figure that part out; I'll just hold my breath until then.
just think of all the interesting conversations you had!
You can kinda tell that Norm is a straight up AFOL, the others are just cool, Lego! (Besides the Bricknerd guy)
When I was a kid, I thought the Galaxy Explorer kit was huge. Sheesh.
What a piece of junk! - Luke Skywalker\n\nThat is the most beautiful LEGO set I've ever seen. What an awesome team build, how long would a solo build take...
How did you get this early
Nice .  but what piss me off a person like me could NEVER HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT. Im a working man ...sometime it make sick only rich people can have stuff like that
11 hours so what 60+ man hours which brings it down to 10-15 bucks an hour-ish. Well that's a shit load of value right there for entertainment! Love it - better to beg for forgiveness, than ask for permission oh wifey! I have some neeewws...
Next to the Lego porsche 911, this is one of my favorite sets. It's so detailed
wanted the old one since a child...
How does lego design these as in how would the blocks go to build it
So how long does it take to build if your alone :OOOO
Is it in true scale to the LEGO figures? (haven't seen the video yet)
Oh, my goodness. It was a sudden release. How do they sell like this? When is the next official release date? I've known it is Oct. 1`.
12 hours for 6 people. I can only imagine how long it would take for 1. I feel like im watching a review of a sports car. Wish I had it but no way can I afford it
I was half anticipating them to throw it against the wall once they finished
if you cant play with it i aint gonna buy it, same rule for cosplay. Display pieces are nice but i am not wasting that amount of money for it to sit on a shelf
this box set is madness
At least the right size to the figures :)
Will swap kidney for this Lego set or sell my soul...
That's not proper Lego, just a slot together kit!
We have no idea what's inside this box\nYes you do, Norm, stop being so dramatic.
So cool to see that Adam and Grant are the only two who survived the Mythbusters breakup and now have a youtube channel together! Thumbs up!
I would set it on a shelf with the panels on half of the ship to appear to be peeling back by hanging them on fishing string
I WANT THAT THING SOOOOOO BADLY\n GOSH WHY IS IT 800DOLLARS ARGH
A lovely set guys, here in New Zealand we pay $1500NZD which bites.
They wasted half their time to knolling. Good to know.
I like the new one except its cockpit which looks odd and out of place
How many are going to be made
One of my coworkers is planning to buy it. I guess he will have a lot of fun building this little wonder ^^
Like every other set,it's a box of plastic bricks.
Kishore we have the same name! And I am kisure about that haha
Missed opportunity for a epic quote at 10:53
i built this set in 7 hours
I can't stand what's he's name....
For Christmas what should I get this or the Death Star
As a guy who's not into Lego, but really into the falcon, I can say that the old one has a much better shape. The new one is way too flat and the cockpit and radar dish look too small.\n\n\nNow Adam, it is time to build and review the bandai perfect grade falcon!!!!
Wow, great video!  Any estimates on how long it would take one or two people to build this?
800 smackers. might take a month to build so it's great intertainment.  Sucks you can't pick it up
Adam shouldn't throw the box and stickers around like they're worthless
Where would you even put something like that? its too big for a shelf
Death to Chihuahua’s!!!
These are over $1000 on Ebay Australia lol. At first I was like looks meh as I'm not a huge fan of Lego but this was pretty amazing. What really stands out to me is how stringent Lego's quality control must be to get every single piece into this set (maybe they ship spare pieces in it?). But damn that was crazy!
Why are you wearing a hat indoors?
Go subscribe to https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCjmXfvtQbyzUtdEYpjGX46w for secrets Legos and more
What the hell is an aluminium falcon?
Who here hates the fact that they took all the bags, took all the pieces out and then sorted it, not just going by the bags, and tore up the instructions
Please start putting where everyone in the video got their graphic T's from as they all have great taste.
I'd just like to say I noticed and appreciated the camera motion during the time lapse
$800?No so dumb
nice
Nerds! lol
transmission lend alone oyyhhg wonder away lead straight firm nut.
Simone though
Lol box is fuked now
Cool
Tons of minifigs. Really?
intellectualizing legos ok why not
Not decals; stickers
NEED
https://youtu.be/vNv-B65PjPI
Awesome video. Thanks guys!
700 euro :')
i want it
https://youtu.be/kYjlqnmxUaY
WOW <3
neat : )
eight.... hundred.... ....dollars.
Tons of minifigs
You guys deserve more subscribers
hey man dont die, be happy!
If this is a newer Falcon, shouldn't it have the rectangular radar dish that it featured in The Force Awakens?  (I realize that the photo on the box depicts it flying through the skies of Bespin, however that model doesn't differ much - if at all - from it's predecessor featured on the table next to the build.)
As steep as the $800 price tag is.... Ah ha ha ha ha, stop complaining about that. That works out to be about $1100NZD but our retail price is $1500NZD!!! So stop complaining about the price in the US. You guys got it so good!
$1300 In Australia - Just Crazy!
this or iphone X
These are the types of guys i used to bully in highschool and they deserved it.

People are so hurt that a Muslim is trending lmao \nPoor snowflakes
My autistic brother is in love with the way you say Morning guys and it's hilarious cos he replays it a billion times! :D
love you Dina, you are such an explosion of energie
Be careful with the rope/pull cord on the blind cuz some kids can accidentally get it around their neck and strangle. Please make sure there isn't a loop at the bottom of the blinds. Take care
I'm so excited to see the transformation😂😂
Thanks for time , I won't watch in the future good night 😉
The room looks gorgeous with natural light..good for filming.
lol everyone calling Dina oppressed for wearing a hijab. How many oppressed women tell their husbands to fuck off constantly and put them to work?😂😂😂 How many oppressed women have more subscribers than her husband? How many oppressed women are allowed online? It's called showing respect for God. No one says anything about nuns but because she's Muslim it's a huge fucking deal. Get your head out of your ass and just enjoy the fucking video or don't watch. It's simple
I am in love with your scarf here you look beautiful with that colour on !!

Oh Lordy. Dina is so loud, she is annoying. You need to dial it down babushka.

Do people actually enjoy this?
This man is not punishing his woman for being confident? What blasphemy is this?

She'd look better without the t-shirt on her head
Are you white? genuinely can't tell and am just curious
does anyone know where dina's ring and bracelet is from?!! 😭😭 i love them
GROSS
Click bait
Wonder why this is trending... hmmm
What a load of shit
That title plus the thumbnail made me think your about to suicide bomb someone
Raghead
Sid's got a big ass, which girl would stay with someone like that, if there was no money involved I bet these 2 wont be together fact!
u gonny build a bomb up there
Can you vlog your next terrorist attack? Fucking Muslim
Take that fucking thing off your head and escape before your man shanks you
Your bomb didnt work properly, stop trying to kill my people please.
Oh god a muslim no thank s
Nice,  promoting a symbol of oppression for the whole world to see.
Your allah doesn't and has never existed, and your precious prophet muhammad (*piss be upon him*), held up by islam as a shining example of a perfect human being that all should aspire to emulate, was in reality an *illiterate, warmongering pedophile* that has left the world with a legacy of *systematic genocide, generational incest and atrocious intolerance towards other cultures,* now fallaciously described by so many today as a religion of peace.
Rest in peace
Rest in peace Harry Dean Stanton.
Just heard he passed, this was the first film I ever saw him in and he introduced me to this amazing song, travel well brother x
Now you're there buddy, now you're there.
I remember a couple of years ago rewinding this part over a few times because he sang this so sweet. You could tell he'd lived some life. RIP.
Rest now. You're in the grace of glory forever more. R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton. 1926-2017
Rest in peace and with the lord near
Harry Dean Stanton is the best - under appreciated actor of all time! Hands down, unless you count 'leading' actors.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P., HDS.
RIP Harry Dean
Stanton died today. 15 September, 2017.
Just a closer walk with thee, Mr Stanton,- rest in peace.
RIP...Ah was just watching Partly Fiction last night and remarked- There's the Last of a Certain Breed of Men.......Probably the last Hollywood veteran of WWII.
this is so saf
Harry Dean Stanton passed away today. The last movie I remember him in was The Last Stand with Arnold Schwarzenegger. We have a countless number of films he played in to remember him by. Christine, Repo Man,  Paris Texas, Dillenger, Two Lane Blacktop, Fire Down Below, and the list goes on and on. R.I.P. Mr. Stanton. You will be missed.
do u kiddies even realize how big a legend this movie and HDS is????
He performs it, just like the old blues legends, very great !
Safe travels Harry.
RIP Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Rip
R.I.P. Harry!
RIP Harry.
Their all gone now. Luke, Dragline, Society Red, Loudmouth Steve, Babalugats, Alibi....the Captain. The only one left is Koko. RIP Tramp!
If I fall dear lord who cares?
now there ain't nothin' to come back for
how much homosexy did they do in this movie?
I was watching youtube videos the other night, and got caught in the mode where you keep getting suggested videos to watch. I passed on most, but wound up watching this, as Cool Hand Luke is one of my all time favorite movies, and I've always loved Harry Dean Stanton. Kind of surreal to me that the next day after watching this, he had passed on. If you've ever compiled a list of your favorite top 10 or 20 movies, there's a pretty good chance Harry acted in one or more of those movies.
A solid actor. Multitalented. Unforgetable in any scene. Job well done Sir.

That Paul Newman didn't win the Academy Award for best actor in this movie is a joke. Paul Scofield, A Man for All Seasons was great, but Luke is an iconic film character creation.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. Just saw him in the new Twin Peaks
:'(   Rest in Peace Harry. You will be sorely missed buddy   :'(
May God grant him eternal peace. We'll miss you, Harry!
Rest In Peace Mr Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Thank you for this, sir.😥
Watching Cool Hand Luke now and I thought that was him.  RIP Harry.
Repo man; got all night every night R.I.P. 🌈🐺🌈🌵🌈🗿🌈🐎🌈🌅*
Rest in Peace Mr. Stanton.
great actor!!  last time I saw him was in a Two and a Half Men episode.  Cameo w/ Chris Penn and Elvis Costello, sittin' around talkin' in Charlie's living room.    FUNNY!    REPO MAN WAS SOO AWESOME,  I BOUGHT THE LP.  first punk lp.  I ever owned.   REST IN PEACE HARRY.  beautiful life and career.
Rest in peace good sir
Rest in peace, Harry.
Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
I love this man. RIP\nHarry Dean.  When I\nfeel real down, this tune sung\nand strummed by him always \nsoothes me.
Rest in peace Harry one of my heroes . Thank you
This movie was like Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Both protagonists and stories seem like everyday scenes, the everyman trying to resist and overcome far greater and malevolent forces. Then you realise these are spiritual works of art. It isn't by chance that HDS is playing spirituals while they are trying to break Luke's spirit out there by the ditch, or here, saying goodbye to his mother. Quite a sad scene!
Such a great movie
His latest performances on showtime Sundays at 9:00 p.m.,on the return of Twin  Peaks He plays the guitar there once or twice as well
Handful o' legends
RIP.
Rip good sir
Rip Mr. Stanton

Peace HDS..\n.you will be missed..
We will miss him dearly. RIP

The best version of this song I ever heard is by the chambers bros.i,ve heard hundreds of versions.the bros do a fantastic job.great !!!!!!
🌈R.I.P. 🌈🗿🎸🎤🌵🌄🙌🎪💔*
Memorable song,  part of such a great movie, as its my personal favorite and quite possibly Newman's finest hour and his personal choice i do believe ? Harry Dean Stanton and his contribution is to his credit, RIP Harry
It just creeps up on you, powerful.
Why isn't this song part of the soundtrack? did mr.stanton ever record this song?
he croaked today, rip!
I wish Harry had recorded a full version of this.
Damn that is so great.
That brother is feeling it.  I can't sing or even listen to this tune without feeling it.
Harry's version is definitely best - wish he'd done the whole thing. Try Judith Durham - seekers for one that comes close.
pure class, from writing to music to acting, simple yet so deep
Man.......this movie. I think Paul Newmans best......ever. And he made so many that were over the top.
The closest to this I can find is by Judith Durham - wish Harry had done a full version but Judith's is excellent.
:(. ..
Comes a time the bitch don't recognize the pups no more...  -Harold Dean Stanton,... Last one standing might be appropriate after witnessing the sendoff they gave Dennis. Tough Motherfuckers to be sure. I met Harry Dean in '89 at the original Hollywood Billiards-(the brick building that fell in during the Northridge quake). I'd met some people already and was on the move in L.A. Some friends that ran the original Zero Club-(Wayzatta Cameroon-Mark Boyd and brother Scotty Boyd-great man/guitarista). We showed up to HB and walking in found Harold Dean holding court in a booth and completely lit, and blathering coherently. I was introduced and realized that this was the wrong time for such 'protocol'. He said-Nice to meet you Dave and that was my first big movie star encounter in Los Angeles. You would have had to have been there. series of true and actual events in the City of Angels. This being one of the least of them. Great singer, and pure American talent-\nHarry Dean Stanton. Not since that dog put his tongue on the butter. -Greatest role ever- Missouri Breaks.

You can take a 20min break while doing this and still beat the others by 20minutes. So for you it is a Pausable-Challange
And it takes me 4hrs to eat one grain of rice.

Wer kommt auch von Inscope? :D
Now, for anyone curious about if the snake could kill him:\nwell, technically, yes, but no.
*T H E    L I N K S T E R*
Good singing  Rhett
Tris the Boa...my name is Tris and Im scared of snakes, ironic right?
i have never heard Link so many times in one episode lol
Thanks. Talking in 3rd person helped me a lot!
I love you god  I watch good mythology morning when I Sade I. Watch it .
QTMBE: Do the biggest slut drop ever seen by a human eyeball
Rhett, you shouldn't put q-tips in your ear, you can get really bad ear infections.
No wonder ice bear from we bare bears is so calm
Link talking in third person sounds like elmo
s e r p e n t \nk i n g
You were missing a variable, talking in first person, that is crucial for an experiment
How'd you guys get Jake Paul and Erika in that tank with link?
What happened to this show?
Link doesn't feel like a word anymore
I loved the new intro
This is entertaining - but Link is supposed to talk TO himself not about himself. Not things like Link is the serpent king. but things like Link, you can do this. Link, this is no big deal. Link, you are the serpent king. - essentially self affirmations. So anyone wanting to do this should not do as Link does - but as I explain here. lol. That said - it was interesting that this still worked .
Did we just get Rhett rolled?\n\nAlso, if they named the boa Tris & it has less than 3 S's (Trisss) that was just a wasted opportunity.
Did I just get Rick rolled??!??!?!?!?!??!?!
I would not get near the snake
maybe snakes don't scare me much but i was surprised how terrified Link was. Go Get'em Serpent King
GMM are getting more inappropriate with every video...
My uncle talks in 3rd person to help with his social anxiety. I always thought it was weird, now I think it could actually help him a lot
One of the best shows/channels ever. Thank you all.
Sometimes I think this show is one big prank on Link.
Link is the Serpent King and Link is me
You feel so bad for Link, but admit it, we got our schadenfreude fix from watching his suffering. Love you guys!
I talk to myself when I run. It helps me keep going. Lol 😂
because they no longer make videos in Spanish. I watched your videos but only in Spanish. by the way this the traditional with Google translator:
I absolutely love the new intro
Y'all better make a serpent king t-shirt after this
#QTMBA I would fly to Hawaii with my mom or go to Japan with my cousin :T
Rhett's hair looks like coloured string cheese \n😂😂😂
does it look to anyone else like Rhett is wearing a ton of makeup?
Is it safe to have a reptile touch your face area like that?\nI like reptiles, but I was always told that they're the most disease ridden of all animals. I'm not sure how true that is though.
I love the way they do the titles they are so clever
ALL HAIL TO THE SERPENT KING!
Rhett I have the same shirt
oh my gosh.  poor link.  i love that guy and he's always getting picked on.
link was doing it wrong
Lol I'm from Clarksville
shameful, literally just talking about science and you still are wrong about something simple. if the world somehow lost gravity you would not just float away, if you jump then yes you would, but if you leap forward then you would keep going forward forever and go through the atmosphere, maybe even into the sun!
Holde on
Oh my crap should be the next shirt.
#qtmba i would grab to something bolted to the floor stay there until gravity is back and well talk to my self.
Today we're gonna stress you out\nPut your head inside a tank\nAnd fill it with stressful stuff\nThat upsets you 😂😂😂\nAmazing
Why can't they keep the heart rate up on the screen !!!!
I actually own a six foot columbian red tailed boa names Cassiopeia she's my baby <3
I'm sitting here crying and laughing XD poor Link, this poor poor freaking man. Link IS poor.
I thought the snake was cute personally
why is no one talking about the game title????!!! THEY ARE ALWAYS SO CREATIVE ON THESE TITLES !!!
Check out the new challenge on our channel!
Did anyone else think link sounded just like Dobby
Link doesn't seem like a word anymore
at 11:04 the test constant was altered when he criss crossed his legs
I talk to myself and bite my nails
Oh god I can feel Link's anxiety
Link, those had better be Red Wing boots.
YAIKKSSEE. my heart rate is always 119, guys I'm gonna be talking in third person for like 3 years
the snake was a cutie cx
I can't believe Rhett made that joke at the beginning 😂
Bring Christina back on the show with more animals sometime! She was so cool!!
The red tailed boas are among one of the nicest breeds
Return of the Serpent King
Very cool experiment.  Link you ROCK dude!!!!
Actors being paid to act.
When Rhett said I am the captain now 1:39 I immediately thought about studio c
Link reminds me of paul rudd so much anyone else?
:( no.
...eating...panus..? D:
Omg
This reminds me of Gollum.
When Link started talking in third person with the snake I started laughing so hard but I also felt bad 😂😂
I'm surprised how you guys are not dead yet
That handler made me appreciate snakes more.... maybe they're not just heartless creatures after all.  Maybe i wanna hug a snake......mmmm maybe not
#QTMBA i would not have a plan i would be dead
Tape my feet #qtmba
#serpentking
I bite my finger nails allot thers nothing left to bite link I'm with you
Darrian thinks Link needs a Psychologist
#QTMBA I'd start flapping my arms to fly.
0:50\nRHETT-ROLLED
After seeing this i tried talking to myself in third person during a panic/anxiety attack and it really helped so thanks guys for showing us this
Poor Link looks like he's about to cry with the snake.
Wait did I just get Rhett-rolled? \n\n\n\n\n\nBut seriously tho these questions have to be answered before I die
Link think about his dog Jay.\nThat thing would eat Jay so fast :))))))
I just love snakes, I think she is so adorable. Especially when her handler was first putting her in the aquarium, she went back up like Nuuuu dun put me in here!
Can y’all make a gray tee w/ black Rhett & Link&Barbara&Jade? Thank you!
Nothing from Stevie would scare me :)
I have anxiety and I always talk to myself during a panic attack, always have. I talk to myself generally aswell to try and remain calm. It works mostly but it has its disadvantages aswell.
They said Link so much that it just sounds like a stupid sound now.
Is it just me or have they started using more adult humor
MY GF THINKS THE SAME,,,PAAAINNNNNUSSSSSSS
everyTHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINGGG is gonna be okaaaaaaaaayyyy
Panus XD
link is link
Tris the snake... where are the divergent fans?!?
Dawww ❤️🖤❤️ the snakes puppy mouth is adorable
#QTMBA grab onto something that is attached to the floor.
Why does it have to be SO EXPENSIVE 😭😭
I know it not fashionable but I would love to see a MAC review from their permanent line. You usually only see the LE collections.
It all looks so gorgeous and I love the make up look. Maybe I could afford one thing 😁
Wrong celebrity love
Maybe Eddie took the brush? I´m kinda wondering if you found it!
Thanks for doing a real close up!!
Hi Nic. Can you recommend some dupes for the powder eyeshadows?
So beautifullll love this! Is expensive but worship😍💄💋
Will you be doing a review on the Fenty Beauty line
If my skin was THAT flawless I would never wear foundation.
Hi there, I’m a new subscriber:) could you link the earlier video where you used the darker foil with the darker shadow please :)
Is the mascara smudge proof?\nMany thanks 😘
There's a brand that's becoming popular in the U.S. called Maskcara, and I'd like to know your opinions on the entire set.
loved this video! you seem so relaxed, i hope you're doing as good as you look :) i also appreciate how honest you are with your reviews, thank you so much for being real and not trying to bash a company or selling us anything!
I'd love to see your take on Fenty Beauty by Riri
Once upon a time Victoria Beckham was putting her name to cheese and onion crisps. Now look at her collabs.. those prices!
Can I ask you to do the review of clarins makeup please?)
I didn't expect the bronzer to be as beautiful as it is! It looks so dull and light in the pan, but when you put it on your face, it was beautiful!
Please have my baby
I would love to see a video about Fenty Beauty.
I think I'm going to grab the mascara. I am such a fan of any mascara that grabs all my lashes. In not sure of any of the other products. Thank you for being honest😘
Could you try bare minerals please ❤️
So beautiful. I am in love with a lot of her make up. Wish I could treat myself. Will try to if I can get hold of some. Xx
Where are your earrings from?
Thanks for the video, would love to see you do a Laura Geller video please :-) x
For the one brand tutorial I would like to see a Natasha Denona one too if you can Nic 😘
No 7 video would be nice
Could you do a brand review on Hourglass? And Laura Mercier? Xx
that look is pretty
I'd love for you to do a No7 Makeup tutorial/review! I don't see those very often and I think there are some decent thing within the brand for less bank breaking prices.
Lovely review, have you stopped using your lilash serum? Could you do update review on it x
It sounds weird but I love that greasy eyelid look. Do these transfer during the day?
I'd love to see a Clarins makeup tutorial!
I'd love to see a video using Tarte products! I try to use natural makeup brands when I can, and I think Tarte does that really well.

I can't deny that the packaging is beautiful, but the size of those eye shadows?  that's ridiculous.  They could have been a bit bigger to at least fill the compact.  I'm going to pass.  Although that eye foil looks great.  It looks like you're doing the glossy eye trend without the gloss.
Love Victoria Beckham's clothes, I was looking forward to seeing reviews on the cosmetics. Glad I waited because I am surprisingly not going to buy some of the items I originally had on my list! Love the Modern Mercury (I have the original one STILL), love the setting powder, and love the mascara! Thanks for the great review. Can't wait for the next ones!
Really love this type of video-very informative and helpful. Thanks Nic, brilliant job 😊
Loved the reviewtorial thought the end result was very much a Brooke Shields look. They do look like very luxurious products and you can see the quality in your results. Thanks for sharing
Could you do some more affordable brands like collection or maybelline x
Is flower beauty widely available there? It would be nice to see a brand review of that brand. Thanks! Still loved the end look even if you just wanted to try the products. :) great as usual.
Is this only colour of foil in the collection? Gorgeous makeup as always xx
If you can do Dior that would be great!! Thank you! Love love love your videos.
What show was she on. I recognise her just not sure what she was from??? X
You did a great job nic!
Could you try the new too faced kandee collection? \nWould be good to see an actual make up artist use it rather than just youtubers who dont have the same level of knowledge or experience xxx
Forever love your videos! Would LOVE to see you feature; NARS & Hourglass Xx
Please bring the new blue brushes and the multi tech ones in Douglas stores in Germany...excited looking forward to get them from Douglas.de online Shop 🌸💕😘
Gorgeous!  I'd like to see beauty pie or kat von.d x
Nic, I think it would be hilarious to see you and Sam do a full face using homemade products based on jail makeup.  I love the vids where you guys  work together on a silly task like the waterproof mascara challenge you did.  \n\nI'm also dying to see you and Sam do looks from American Horror Story, especially Lady Gage's looks in the Hotel season.\n\nJust some ideas! Love to you all!!
Love the make up tutorial. Can you please do a review on Fenty beauty? I would an honest review. Thaaaanks x
besides makeup, you girl have a lovely nail color, i love it, show it often
Can you do a fenty makeup review
Will the real techniques powder bleu brushes come to ulta?
That lip liner color looks fucking good on you.
Dolce & Gabanna, please. Those are only available online and I'd like to see them tried out before I go and purchase them. Thank you!
You're so adorable!!! I love your makeup tutorials!!
please do a few looks with Natasha denona Lila palette! if you and your sister each did a look together from one palette, it would be like two looks in one video! genius! esp since you're both so talented and not just for ND but any brand and palette, that would be a cool video to see from you two
I really enjoy your videos....Could you review makeup revolution... thanks
Shit shit shit I really am trying to curb my spending on makeup. This doesn't help.
I recently bought some makeup from W7, I'd love to see you do a review of them! It's insanely affordable. Their Glowcomotion highlighter/eyeshadow is gorgeous. I also got their matte eyeshadow palette and all the shades are very wearable.
I would like to see the normal Estée Lauder range, especially the Double Wear Foundations and their differences!
Lovely video. Super informative and honest opinions. Look forward to more of this style of video. X
There's not a product that you used that doesn't look wonderful & flattering on you! I was wondering though, what color/brand did you use on your hair? I really like it
As much as I like Estée Lauder products I just can't get on board with this it's like taking out a bank loan to buy a bronzer, products look gorgeous on you though nic!
When is the defining crease brush out? Only shade set in the brushes info ☹️
Baby hairs- put hairspray on a toothbrush and comb through! :)
Will you please do an Avon makeup review! Thank you :)
Hello can you feature hourglass & Laura mercier. I love watching your videos ☺️
Stunning as always but the makeup looked a bit doll like for me...maybe it was the skin. I know a lot of people love the perfect look but I love to see your amazing skin a little more natural xx
Wow, wow wow. The make-up your face and technical skills show the VB collection off to perfection. Thank you ❤️
62 pounds for translucent powder?! Which you are probably paying for the name instead of the quality, you would probably find the same if not better quality product at a drug store.
Your skin is to die for!
I can still hear this creeking/grinding noise in the videos! What is this???
Pat McGrath's new eyeshadow palettes, please!
YSL DIOR and GIVENCHY please!
Could you do Tarte please
Fenty Beauty 🙋🏻
So beautiful
Fenty Beauty pleaseeeeee

Hate estee lauder. Bad eyeshadow. Hate the lip stick too.
Great video. Dior, please! :D
Laura Mercier, please!
Beautiful makeup
Fenty Beauty please?
Makeup revolution?
...why do these celebrities think they are so above reasonable pricing?! absurd!!! please don't pay this for products when equally good or better products exist for less!! great review, nic and the look you created is stunning, as always....thanks for your down to earth honesty xoxo
Fonts makeup by Rihanna please !! I really trust what you would say about it :)
I feel bad thinking this but I really wonder how you would've felt about these products had you not known they were vb?\nI've watched this channel for years and I respect you both a ton and such is the reason why I don't want to doubt you.
Yes Fenty beauty please!! OMG VB products are expensive!! She may be pricing herself out of the market! Pass
Hi Nic....i Love ur Videos but these reviews would be even better when u could do a weartest and show how the Products lasted on  ur  face after  6-12 hours. Much love from Germany
Can u review fenty beaity
Hi Nic and Sam! Would you consider doing a Fenty review? I'd love to hear your take on it.
I hate the fact that REAL music like this have very few views but songs like Look What You Made Me Do by Taylor Swift has almost 400M views, and that song is pure shit >;(
What a Great song! Wish you guys could come and check my music playlist out too.
I'm in love with Lana... Her music drives me insane. I travel.
Lana del rey songs are so lovely to listen to, but this one is especially lovely😍
She's like an old song living in the future. This video also has a Gattaca vibe to it
*Lana is THE woman
When she is saying:' I was such a fool for believing that you....'\nI can hear only 'I was such a fool for leaving you'....
Beautiful
1:58 not a mustang
Você é um príncipe

Watch out for the crowd! Please don't hit us with your white mustang😦
I didn't know she's that beautiful...
I thought the white mustang would be Bradley Soileau.
The only artist that makes decent music and only 5 million views 😑 Lana Del Rey deserves better
I love LDR but what the fuck is this music video?!
My love lana ♥

Queen ❤

Lana I have a very ferocious lil puppy named Wednesday Addams that lives up to her name but any time she is throwing a fit I play this song and she sits down on her pillow and chills out until it's over!
I love how her style is still so recognisable after all this time, it never gets old or boring for me :)
I LOVE U DARLING! ❤
What she means by the day I saw your white mustang?

Fucking lost it when he summoned a train and it was Thomas the tank engine. A+
He didn't turn it over with the screwdriver :(
Technically everything you make is canon, as in an infinite universe with infinite possibilities of anything happening, all of this could happen\nEdit: All of this will definitely happen in such an universe/multiverse
BOOM, BIG REVEAL, MORTY!!
I LOVE IT
*D E S E C R A T I O N*
Omg the Thomas part fukin killed me lol
These videos need to stop, your one of the reasons the rick and morty fanbase must die
That was epic! Nice work as always my good man!
3:38 just had me laughing! Kinda thought Thomas got lost there!
10/10 would watch in full episode form.
Last part scared the shit out of me like really I'm in the shit room
Absolutely love these videos! Your time and commitment to making these are appreciated.
this ..... this is what i use the internet for .... good day
I love the videos keep them coming I keep looking for a good rick and Morty mod for Xbox but can't seem to find any,any plans for making one?
Dude watching rm right now and this is sick great work guys
This was the best XD
You never fail to make me laugh
You should have so many more subscribers your stuff is so good
spoiler alert it was a Alien dick
where is the Israel scene
I don't know if I'm allowed to make a suggestion, but I'd like to see Scary Terry.\nEdit: Didn't know you already did Scary Terry. Sorry.
Thomas theme at the end, plz tell me where to find it
I really appreciate that you don't rush these but instead put a lot of effort into it.  Quality material
I fucking love this
I loved Rick and Morty until Pickle Rick cuz no one shuts up about it and it's so annoying.
This is awesome. You even made the eyes the same lol
nigga do the latest episode already
kinda wanted to see sexy summer killing someone like in the show
I'm laughing so hard with this shit😂😂😂 Good job!

First video of yours I've seen.  Was not disappointed
You gotta do the entire Atlantis-Episode!!!
This is all in-character for Bethesda writing. Are you sure this is recreated Rick & Morty scenes and not just footage from Fallout 5 by Bethesda?
3:06 Something you will never see, a legion trooper and an NCR ranger in piece!
Holy shit this is fucking amazing!
I'm so glad you're not dead! Or badly injured or mutilated or sick with the sniffles. I'm just glad to see you're ok and still making kick ass videos. It means the shrine still works.
This is o scary
Citidel of Ricks next please! That would be glorious!

If the soldiers who stormed the beaches in Normandy in June 1944 could see this and what has happened to the world they wouldn't have gone 40 yards up that beach.
As a black man fuck the black whore for fucking the white junkie
Now this was beautiful 😭💖
Not judging or anything or being mean but 0:13 is a lie everyone is beautiful in there own way to God and tbh not being rasict but black parents name there kids ghetto names and stupid names (All race's do it,(More black people tho)..(But still) Congratulations on your baby :)

Sweet.  They seem to really like each other.  Blessings to the family
Sis it's a coon with a white!!disgusting
Baby will grow with identity crisis. Now you can go and die happy because you child wont.
Page 5, still have yet to find an actual racist comment, but I've found plenty of comments calling them out, seems like a small group of trolls got the attention they wanted.
Huh, I expected the baby to be bigger, due to the parents' stature. For a newborn, she's already cute!
ummm sorry but who are those ?
is that a tear in my eye? opp, yes it is
I thought a Jr. could only be a boy. She would be a II not Junior sorry....unless you have a vagina.
Dear the racist dipshits in this comment section that are upset that what they say on Reddit isn't supported by the founder.....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo fuck yourself with a 6 by 6 by 18 inch black dildo
What is in a name Alexis Olympia ohanian Jr.
Your wife is stunning! And I love the name Olympia so much! Congrats.
Who was clicking like it was Snapchat
Such a great video!!
Wow, these people are really full of themselves.
Fun fact: people in the comments being edgy fools, saying stuff like the n word or don't race mix. You should mind your own business and not comment on things. Because at the end of the day you just look like a needy child.
So beautiful just like her mum

I don't consider myself politically correct, but even I can see this planet has reached a sick, sick state when even a newborn baby can't be protected from racism. I feel so helpless that I can't stop these goddam hate comments. I hope she never sees them one day.
Congrats to you and your family new member 😍😂😎😇👶
I loved where you guys put Grand Slam Titles: 1! Congratulations to both of you! She is absolutely beautiful! 💖
Babylon is falling!!! Time to get right with the Creator! Shalom♥

Today's generation of schoolchildren looks much different than one just a few decades ago. Nonwhites are expected to become the majority of the nation's children by 2020, as our colleague Bill Chappell reported last year. This is now the reality among the very youngest Americans: babies.\n\nBabies of color now outnumber non-Hispanic white babies (1 year or younger), according to new estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. The newest estimate shows that on July 1, 2015, the population of racial or ethnic minority babies was 50.2 percent.\nBut the scales may have actually tipped in 2013 — the Census Bureau often revises past population estimates as new data become available. That means the first of these babies are now preschool-aged.\n\nWe've already been seeing this shift in U.S. schools: the 2014-15 school year marked the first time that minority student enrollment in public schools surpassed that of white students.\n\nNPR could not reach any babies for comment.\n\n\n BLACKS.... we don't die we multiply 🤷🏾‍♂️
MAYBE SHE'LL GROW UP AND BE A GENIUS PUSHING THE EDGE OF CIVILIZATION. OR MAYBE SHE'LL GROW UP AND BE A FUCKING CHIMP. OR MAYBE NOT THE FORMER BECAUSE YOU MADE A NIGGER.
Been there, done that. Welcome to the world, Alexis.\n#BiracialCrew
Disgusting traitor to the human species.

I'm not getting what the big deal is here.  Are not 95% of couples equally ecstatic about their pregnancy?  Are either of these parents-to-be celebrities?  If so, how?  What exactly is the hullabaloo about this couple?

I'm a photographer so seeing this and hearing your opinions on the images is so inspiring. Loved the photos and the decorations and everything 💛💛💛
Oh wow Helen these photos are the culmination of the work we've seen you put in throughout the vlogs in the lead up to the wedding and I have to so you absolutely outdid yourself. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by a wedding! Absolutely love your theme and your flower arrangements and pops of colour were just to die for and it looks like everyone had such an amazing time. Thank you so much for sharing, much love 💜 xx
I actually lol'd at matthew talking about his neck roll 😂😂 oh please get rid of it \n\nBeautiful photos 😭❤
My pyjama bottoms are being eating by my arse 😂😂😂😂 so funny. Gorgeous photos 😍😍
Crying at 'reverse neck'.
Theres just SOO many little fine details in your wedding that made it so lovely
What was your first dance song?
Beautiful!! I'm getting married in 3 weeks! I'm super nervous and stressed about it 😅. But, seeing you two looking back at your magical day gives me the happy feels! Congrats you two! 💕💕💕 you're an inspiration!
They're beautiful!!  The photos of Maff and his friends look like they could be Mumford and Sons and I love it!!
Lovely 😊 \nPs. I fancy Connor so hard! He is my young Kurt Cobain! 💔
Most epic wedding of all fucking time
So beautiful! I love how colorful it was without being tacky at all! People are often so scared of color but you did it Right! GORG!!
SUCH A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER
I got engaged yesterday so instead of watching all of your adorable wedding videos and dreaming of the day, I get to plan one too!  Can't wait to film all the fun vids for it.  Your wedding looked like a magical carnival dream! 🍿 🍾  🎡
Im in love with the flowers and plants 😍
This wedding was beautiful and you worked so hard Helen it's gorgeous ❤️❤️
Love this sooooo much! The more I watch you guys together the more you remind me of my and my partner. Funny :)
Thank you so much for sharing!\n\nThe photographer did an amazing job
Super cool that!! Was it an Autumn wedding?
You always look fabulous in that yellow top w your hair! (+ you & maff are amazing!!)
Thanks for sharing, what great memories to have.
What a perfect set up! Loved everything about your wedding 😚
this was absolutely great! thank you for sharing. perfect commentary. very proud to see you growing into such an incredible person; have subbed since the beginning og helen------
Barney in the conservatory with the candlestick hahah my first thought when I heard you say Barney in the conservatory 🤣🤣
Such a nice idea to talk us all through the pictures! Thank you for sharing :}\n(I like this so much more than the movie)
Number 28 on trending yeyyyyy!!!!! Love them so much x x x
I kept thinking she said butt holes lol, but Helen you looked stunning and those photos were everything ❤️️❤️️❤️️❤️️
these are stunning, so happy to see you had such a lovely day  <3
I love how different your wedding was. It was so stripped back and simple in a way. More about the fact you were getting married than all this flouncy shit some weddings have. The photos are gorgeous ❤️
Ahh i love Chloe! She is ace, she second shoots for me sometimes and when i heard she was shooting at ur wedding i was like omg! So cool. I watch your videos religiously haha never comment but always watch. Had to comment on this as i love the photos! Emily and chloe did an awesome job and your wedding looked so amazing! Congrats! X
why am I crying watching this, really moving Helen, have been watching you for years and so happy for you both xx
So so happy for the two of you!!   Looked like you had the best day ever and will be having the best life together that two people could possibly come by!!!
fab!! i love this and both xo
Your wedding looked amazing! I hope all of the photos helped bring the day back in to focus for you. ❤️ I just wanted to say I really love the way you took the carnival wedding theme, which has become rather trendy, and made it completely your own. From the video to all the photos I can see that your personalities and styles shine through in all the details.
Helen who did your veil??? So fab!
Oh its all so rainbow and lollipops i love it!
Love these pics. I'm having a barn wedding next summer - thanks for all the inspiration! 👍🏻
Lovely photos! \nAlso would love a tutorial on your eyemakeup in this video 😍😍
What an unbelievably lovely video, and I'm not even halfway through. Thanks so so much for sharing, it was like seeing the pictures of a friends wedding 💕
Wow! That was awesome, I think I smiled for 18mins straight, congratulations.
Been waiting SOOO long for this one 🎈💓💫🕶
Watching this makes me so happy, the pictures are all so lovely and the wedding looks so unique and fun! Congratulations <3
I don't even know why the picture of Lola at the wedding got me so nostalgic but it really did! I just remember you getting Lola when your life was so different and I realised I've watched your life completely change! It's been such a pleasure to see you sort of 'grow up' in a way! Thank you so much for sharing your life with us, you will forever be my favourite YouTuber! Beautiful wedding and lovely video as always. Lots of love!xxx
I LOVE your purple veil omg! if 8 ever get married I would easily do a purple veil!
If I was getting married again I'd defo do it like yours.
Seeing the stuff as you were buying it, I thought I would be a bit hodgepodgey. It's turned out beautifully!
This looked like the most incredible wedding. Glad you had a lovely time ❤
This video made me so happy
My heart is 😭 crying with so much love ❤️ \n Must say that the weeding has a lot of things that I in a daily basis I don't like, Such as sunflowers and farm things, and you manage to pull over one of the best weddings I ever seen. Fantastic job you two!!!
I love how creative your wedding was. So nice to see something differnt  🖒🖒
your wedding was just gorgeous....ugh. It was so you! Seems like it was a great day; love from Boston USA!
Your wedding looks beautiful ❤️\nThis has literally given me inspiration for my own wedding xx
I'd love to watch some more arts and crafts you do Helen I find it fascinating xxx
Looks like the funnest wedding ever
You can so see you and Maff's personalities in these photos, so much character! I love it❤️ Don't know if you've answered this before but what was your first dance song? Would love a little insight into the music you chose! Hope you're still loving being newlyweds! X
Thanks for sharing Helen and Maff xx Helen you always make me want to chew gum 😂
I just love the amount of colour and character in every picture! These have so much personality compared to most wedding pictures :)
I've followed you since god knows how long from a young teenager to an adult today , I feel like I've grown as a person with you ❤ You're amazing . Again , congratulations , may you two live happily ever after ❤❤
That location!!! And all of the decorations and activities, seriously amazing! 💜
The photos are so beautiful!!!!!! Love you loads!!! Also the outro is so cool xD
I Love Your Wedding Photos😍
God that looks so fun! Thank you for sharing :)
Those are SO GOOD ❤
You guys are so cute 💗 love the photos, everything looked so unique and colourful!
I love all the details you had!! That photo booth is amazing and then all your food vans. Amazing. Venue looks gorgeous
Aww Maff looks tired, well done for working so hard all the time. :) Lovely photos Helen, so great to see the wedding after all the preparation!!
You look so beautiful and all the candid photos are so nice!
You and Matthew are beautiful !!!
Awww I smiled all the way through 💕
Deja vu- isn't this the video from yesterday?
This is so lovely, thankyou for sharing it. Out of curiosity what was your first dance song? Totally cool if you don't want to share btw as it is obviously very personal :)
some very nice photos there :)
The bridesmaids dresses went to we'll with all the colours! I remember you getting lots of unnecessary criticism about your choice of colour combinations for the dresses, but your vision really came true as far as one can see in the photos! :D
I loved this! Felt like I was a close friend being shown all of your lovely wedding pics 😁 This just goes to show how important getting the right photographer for your wedding day is. So many people want to scrimp and save on the photographer and don't realise the dedication and effort that goes into getting the perfect shots for your big day. My brother got a cheap wedding photographer and ended up having no pictures with my mum in! So it's always worth spending that bit extra - you'll be looking back on those pictures for the rest of your lives :)
your husband is so beautiful
Helen your dress was STUNNING. Where was it from?
Love it!!!
Lovely ♡♡
Love you guys!!!
Beautiful pictures! Congratulations xxxx
S
How cute !!!!
mazal tov

Gorg! Congrats again! 💞💞
Such beautiful  pictures  nice job
Most beautiful wedding😍
Loved this
Awwww!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
💜awesome
Helen! You're trending!
Haven't I see this already?
Hipster cringe!!! #obvious
Cutting the the cake was the most awkward pointless part of our wedding. Looking back we wouldn't have done that, you didn't miss anything lol
Cute couple. You guys kinda look like siblings to me
How did the family politics work out after? I saw your mum and dad in the same room when you were getting ready!
He looks so happy 😑😂
Sem duvidas uma das coisas mais incríveis que eu já vi e ouvi. Parabéns pelo trabalho!
i like your sound and the videos are amazing <3
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL!  Thank you soooo much for this!!!
You make the coolest music videos ever. You could almost single handedly resurrect MTV. lol
WOW! Thank you for the excellent work.
Hi, Nigel, Nice video. I watched the video on phone and without headphones and people in comments were going crazy about the track and I wanted to get that same excitement and emotions but when I listened to it on headphones, I didn't hear anything amazing at all. it is a very nice music video with coolest visuals but musically, it is flat and bland. The dynamic range is flat. The musical events, notes, beats, and everything else doesn't have multiple layers effect or that opening, middle and ending tinge on notes or sweet-sweet cues of audio sensation that elevates a musical piece to blissfull from bland. try listening to long after I am gone by chis jones. \nlet be clear, I am not talking about musical StYLE. but the audio quality of the recording. there is less hi-fidelity than currently possible.\ntry this similar video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv6op2HHIuM\nI am sure I am not saying it right but you would understand.\nmaybe, next time, when mastering, try to add pizzaz to the notes and events. I know your next project would be as awesome as this one or better.\ncheers
Nice job man)\nvery good
Disslike because the full video is animated.....
those robots look so unreal I thought they were CGI. But the company is real
I am glad i found this, actually on facebook, then i found your channel on Youtube, you are a genius !\nI'm subscribing, thanks :)
Потрясающе! Классно! Талантливо! Молодец!
сколько времени ушло на подготовку и проведение съемок интересно
After seeing it, and after hearing it, this goes straight on my programming/hardware design playlist. \nAh, to hell with it, I'm going to buy an album now.
Holy exclamations, Batman!   This is the bomb.
sooo facking bad ending, now i dont know what was CG and what was real.
where's the making of this video?!!
Amazing... Effects, Video and Music
This is very impressive. I saw this on Facebook.
Good music, good video. Like.
Excelente compositor. Conheci recentemente os trabalhos desse neozelandês. Me lembra um pouco o Sr. Froeze (Tangerine Dream). Parabéns pelo excelente trabalho em AUTOMATICA 4K. Fico ansioso para conhecer novos trabalhos.
Which ones are real and whowhich are CGI? the laser is not real. None have such a variable focal length
3:07 .... True definition of a musical orgasm.
Got all my preorder treats and I have it on AUTOMATIC replay :) I wonder if I'll get sick of hearing it!
THIS IS JUST WOW!!!!
This is a masterpiece ! Great great work ! I have listened with the best audio and video support !
Stumbled on too this but what a find, this is really awesome!
Great!!!!  Really incredible!!!!  What a job!!!!!Congrats!!!  Now.....I 'm asking myself....Will IA systems do better songs than humans???? Time will tell...
The sound reminds me of some of the more synthy Nine inch Nails tracks. This is a good thing as far as I'm concerned !
New sub and new fan.  You are amazing, this video is amazing, your music is incredible!  Keep up the great work!
Nice Job Nigel , the perfect mix between Robotic advanced technology and music Good Video too.
I HOPE YOU MAKE MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS.
I didn't know Hitman made music!
Ive seen and heard some amazing things in my life but this just tops the LOT subscribed!!!! unbelievable. Recommended from JEAN MICHEL JARRE HIMSELF WOWWW
Album not what I was expecting but have to say enjoying it and feels very good over a multi tactile transducer config for those that also like to feel their music.
kudus ! great work .\nthis music video is not cheap to make if there's no willing sponser .
OSHA Safety violation... OSHA Safety violation... Trivially trainable robotics... /Another/ OSHA Safety violation... I think the military would be very interested in that laser... /More/ OSHA Safety violations...
Woah!!
Cara.. chorei com isso. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
awesome track, awesome video :D
OMG this is very cool :)
Агонь!!
im just speechless
Awesome! Great music and awesome clip
SkyNet is here!
mega cool
genial !!
Can't believe all the effort you have put in this, but it really turned out a masterpiece. \nYou set old genres back to life for me, really like it! 3 years... Unbelieveable.
I'm here to bend my weak meaty knee and hail ourmetal overlords
I,m from Russia,and i,m watch this video.It,s amasing.Nigel S you a very good man!
Another AWESOME mind blowing video Nigel... You've almost out done the Cymatics video... I was hoping for some Cymatics bits in here, but needless to say this video was awesome, especially in 4K!!
wait....the movement, especially the blur, look a bit strange. it is all special effects?!
Something more than music and that fills your ideas but above all that makes you feel the beats and ambientalize your emotion.
We need a making of Nigel!
We came such a long way from animusic, wow!
Wow! Incredible work! I've been a musician for 47 years (keys, guitar, drums) but I haven't seen anything quite like this before...with the exception of Animusic.com (all cgi & music). This is even better!
what kind and what company headset is he wearing ?
I just can't deal with how good this is.
I don´t know rick, it looks fake :P
Это нереально круто!!! Спасибо, Найджел!
Это просто потрясающеееее!!!!!!!!
Я не пойму это графика или на самом деле
Слишком круто, чтобы быть правдой
о боже мой, это прекрасно!
Великолепный клип и музыка неплохая
Increíble!!!
LEGIT!
wow wow wow! Brilliant work man!
pure wizardry!!!
WOW!!
Awesome!
no destruction, no fun ? ..
Animals vs Music
___ ME LIKE ..   :D
Wow.  Just WOW
Awesome job bro!\nBest regards
it's great!
THIS IS SOOOO GOOOOOOOOOODDD”!!!!! :) :)  THANK  YOUU!!!!
So its basically Animusic, but cooler!
не это ли и есть годнота?
Amazing!
Whoa, really something else
Epic
Реклама роботов Kuka? ;)
ЭТО.ПРОСТО.НЕЧТО!!!!!!!!
loved it.
ну все пиздец
Skynet gelecek, hepimizi sikecek.
Чертовски круто!
Holy crap this is awesome.
This is absolutely awesome! Whoaaa! Great work! Perkele!
Lentach Army Here?
Trippy
Awesome!
Genio!!!
fantastic!!!
天马行空般的想象，杰作
Another brilliant album! Cheers Nigel.
What a masterpiece!
German technology... what else?
So i get that most if not all of this is probably CGI but I'm curious if it's actually possible to get the machines to play music that good in real life or if it's just beyond the tolerances of them.
what is the 1:10 background song?
does anyone else know the music is Celtic woman
This looks like a cute movie but the message looks really cliche. I hope they mix it up and don't have this movie being upheld with only pretty animation.
This is so great!!!
I found my Spanish voice, lol I'm everything but this movie is a must see!!!
did they have to give away the whole story and plot in one trailer
sounds like a kind of version of the equal to ariel
That dog definitely has hair
What is the name of the background song???
I'm not questioning why the skeleton is sneezing without a nose.\n\n\n\n\nI'm questioning how it's sneezing without organs.
Will this Movie include an earthquake simulator?
Anyone notice Bittersweet Symphony playing in the background?
Inspired by the Dia de los Muertos, obviously
And the old debate over Ants vs Bug's Life gains new followers to carry the torch.
I hope they tackle dementia with the grandma character.
To all you people complaining that this a Book of Life rip off, they're about the same holiday. Obviously they'll have similar aspects. That's like saying two Christmas movies are ripping each other off because they both have Santa in it.
Oh, Good Lord, 'do what you want no matter what people tell you're, why Pixar? Disney has done it a million times already! And I gaurentee you he will somehow get someone to remember him before at 6:59 am, just before sunrise, 100 percent gaurenteed.
Y'all can't have more than one movie representing Latino heritage without saying they're the fucking same smh
Stop saying its the book of life, tbol was about a love triangle and bull fighting, this one in about music and family
Hey you know that dog looks a lot like the dumb seal in finding dory
Wow I can't wait for the book of life 2
My grandmother was exactly like that according to my mom.  She can be brutal as all hell if you got on her bad side.
Book of life but with a kid and a dog
To all those comparing this to Book of Life:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX7bfDT_Yok
Who else has ever tuned a guitar with a pair of pliers?
I can already tell this is going to be one of their lowest rating films ever!
This is just like book of life! They even have the same concept of being forgoten and being lost
I can't wait for this movie it looks so good !
Ugh this is such a blantant ripoff of monsters inc.
I wasn't expecting they use Bittersweet Symphony for the trailer.
This really reminded me of that other movie book of life
YEAH THERE IS NO WAY SKELETON HAVE A NOSE LIKE THAT _)@
0:04 the momment you do something and somebody into Your room ( bad english sorry )
I really liked Book of Life, this one looks promising as well!
The next level of book of life movie
Can't wait to see COCO😂😀 n hey. Whatch out for the chancla😂😁😘😘
The kid probably is gonna be transgender 🙄
I just want to know what song is playing in the background of this trailer. I feel like I know it / recognize it, but I can't put my finger on it.
My god Pixar, I mean this is gorgeous. Every Pixar film is amazing or at least decent (Accept Cars 2) but my god this takes animation to a whole new level I'm mostly excited for Pixars coco there first musical.
I'm excited to watch the movie
Wasn't the main character from book of life also not allowed to play music even though he wanted to?
there should be cholos in this movie
I AM H Y P E ABOUT THIS LATINO/A REPRESENTATION
But like...\nWhy do disney mkvies stick to the formula of a young character wanting to be/do something and then having their parents stop that goal in the first act, but are then redeemed in the second or third act; where the parents reveal thry do it out of love? Moana did this with her not being allowed to explore, brave did this with merida wantibg to not be a princess, mulan the same thing, nemo wanting to explore ect. I like how this has a spirited away thing going on (though not wholly otiginal either (corpse bride))
Visually this movie looks beautiful. I might go see it.
Pixar's First Movie Musical. Can't wait!!!
Looks like a beautiful movie
I hope they make bendy and the ink machine the movie
Two movies take place in Japan\n*People say nothing*\n\nTwo place take place in Mexico\n*IT'S JUST LIKE BOOK OF LIFE!!!*
Sooo if you disappear once no one remembers you, does that mean Hitler would live forever? Because he's going to be in history books for a long time....
I only hope this lives up to its predecessor: The Book of Life
The first time I've seen a xoloitzcuintli in a movie
Finally a Coco comment section that ISN'T full of BoL fans calling it a ripoff.\nEdit:  nvm apparently people still think it's a ripoff
That dog makes me lose my bejeezers
They're remastering the book of life already?
This..... movie better break records and CRUSH the box office DO YOU HEAR ME!? this better be as good as their old greeaaat  no AMAZING movies,..................................................................................................................................................................and Pixar pleeeease I beg of thee don't screw this up.
When does this take place?
Damn the book of life 2 looks
My Sunday school teacher is an animator for Pixar and has been working on this movie. I can't wait to see it.
What a nice advertisement for the book of life!!
Can I just say I am grateful my mother hasn't hit me with a chancla yet, she has about five pairs sitting on a rack...
Can't wait for book of life 2, though..This one has a lot less style. Hmm..
This looks really cute, but the storyline is cliche. Some kid wants to follow his forbidden dream, goes on a journey, proves to his family that his dream is actually good, etc. etc.
The book of life?
Is this supposed to be a Disney/Pixar Book of Life version kinda thing
Book of life
Cant wait!!!!
hi
I love Mexican Style
Bitter sweet Symphony!
My favorite song from Bittersweet Symphony from Verve. 💓😍💓
Wheres the sombra clues at?

Happy Hispanic Heritage Month chicos!
Pedro Infante
*cough cough book of Life cough cough*
Grim fandango
DAY OF DEATH :)
looking good
Looks weird
We can have more than one dia de los muertos movie
How could pixar of all people made a completely unoriginal story
So this is the short that plays after Frozen 2: Olaf's Big Adventure?
Book of life 2 looks great
Oh boy, more multiculturalism. \nNo thank you, Disney.

Cuando se estrenará?
Isn't it pretty much a copy of the book of life but in more modern times
I gotta say this is best/worse version of the book of life
Tiny little huggers .... GREAT now, I will feel a pang of guilt every time I pick off a glitter. D:
Omg so creepy beautiful! All I could think of is someone walking up to you and hitting on you cuz you're a pretty little clown...and then you smile and they're all like ooh shiiit lol
Where did u but the dentures from?
Can you do a couples Halloween costume look? Or like a few 😩impossible to find more than one look on YouTube
watching this and the new IT are inspiring me to paint Pennywise and scare the crap outta my sister :'D
I just wanna know where did she get those teeth from
I remember nothing about the original miniseries from when I watched it as a kid, other than that I was terrified of my toilet and shower for at least a week afterward. Tonight I saw the new movie and I was blown away. It was AMAZING. if you're on the fence about seeing the movie, I definitely suggest going. I never get scared of horror movies anymore, but it got me a few times. It's truly enjoyable and I expect that most people who see it will also enjoy.
Anyone else see a serious resemblance between Mykie, and Hayden Panettiere?\n\nNo? Just me. Well, you're still a beauty, obviously.
WOW, really impressed, I LOVE IT! the red wig and those scary af teeth ((;
Where is the blonde wig from?

You should become a potato for us-♥️♥️
Does anyone know where she got the wig from? It looks amazing
With the blue hair, it reminded me of American horror story cult
As someone who is absolutely terrified yet completely obsessed with clowns, this is amazing.
If you continue the princess gore. You should do Mulan or Merida because that would sooooo rad.
can you please do taylor swift zombie version of look what make me do music video pleaseee
I died when she casually ripped her wig off😂
Does anyone have any suggestions where I can get cosmetic contacts for astigmatism? I haven't been able to find any.
She seems like she's just half-assing it now a days. Too hollywood for us now.
I think I'll do this but with pink and maybe some contour. I loved the movie and i totally want to go for the glam look for my school annual haunted house where I plan to be a carnie. I'll probably get punched but it'll be worth it
where did you get the contacts from??
Please do a ghost of a supermodel look using the pop luxe glow in the dark highlighter!!! It glows under Blacklights...
Can u try do two videos a week so
Hey mikey, I searched all over YouTube to find Ginger snaps tutorial for her simple wolf like makeup for Halloween but There was none. Think you can make a video tutorial on her?
Where can I get contacts like that? :')))
Great makeup!! It was so funny because when you said Alexa, my Alexa responded and then you said add contacts and she said I've added contacts to your shopping list!!! Hahaha!
Thank you so much for this video now I know what I'm going too be for Halloween 😜😜😜

SLAY
I love your channle
give it up liberals, you'll never win again with your twisted hate inducing rhetoric.
Is this comedy, or a Democrat campaign?
The Nazis of the past were definitely a threat. The Nazis of today, not so much.. They can't even bring proper torches out for a mob, which says a lot about how defanged they are.\n\nThat being said, punching them isn't gonna accomplish nothing. Remember the words of Dr. King Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. For all of you advocating for punching Nazis, I a black man ask you this, has that made less riots and civil disturbances occur less across the nation? Have you truly succeed?
...So out of touch. ...So smug and self-satisfied... *_I don't understand why Hillary lost_*
The left IS racist AND fascist. They think other races NEED white people to SAVE them and want to control them to submit like pets. The left is racist and fascist!
love cannot exist without hate and hate cannot exist without love
samanthabee.com/lifeafterhate  - link at the end of the episode.
Just had a terrorist attack, but WHITE SUPWEMACISTSSTST!
I'm glad to see a beautiful African american woman fight white supremacy
I'm sure the 1k dislikes didn't watch the show😐\n #LifeAfterHate 😁
most of the facts she pulls from are just provably wrong so I cant even begin to criticize the points shes making
I support the goals of Life After Hate, but the white guilt in this video is kind of nauseating.
that's insane they gutted funding wow
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
The dreamers & Medicare for all please watch https://youtu.be/XRnOdnWtQbc
I would love to meet former white supremacists. I mean that very genuinely. I just want to sit and have a conversation.
Lack of love distorts people, and love is the cure for all evil.
Ok so what happens when this former neonazi loses their job or their girlfriend leaves them? I feel like a plan that rotates around making sure white guys never suffer any hardship is not the most long term thing I've ever seen.
But not to proud, that's what got us here in the first place. Oh I fell over laughing 😂
I want to see what criteria the use to say their have only been 6 left terror attacks I guess antifa doesn't count cause I personally can name more than 6 also didn't a left wing nut job just shoot a bunch of Republicans was that 1 of the 6
Where is the documentation, proof, studies, polls, records, etc... that white supremacist groups are the most violent? Have you ever heard of Islam, Antifa, BLM... Both sides have done horrible atrocities but to constantly blame white people is not factual.

I never understood the need for white pride? Look the only reason black pride exists is chase when the African Americans were freed from slavery they didn't really know what they came from most of the African culture they had never known so they made their own but most of us white people now what European country we came from where can pick out on a map our heritage that also goes for Hispanic and asians we don't need to take pride in our skin color we have good old fashioned nationalism
So 2900 americans dead 9 11 by muslims dont count?
When you feel more self-confident there's no one to blame anymore. Such a true and great quote which is the solution to envy and jealousy, I seriously needed that to start my day.
Things will never change until THE MEDIA itself take responsibility for the message it is promoting....one word....DIVISION. STOP referring to people by skin colour/race/ethnicity in ALL situations. Change the language and u change the reality. Mainstream media is selling hate and division in the same way it sells toothpaste/cars/politicians/iphones-REJECT it in all forms, from newspaper and magazines to all tv and mainstream internet. Nothing will change for the better until we wake up to this reality.
Yo Samantha think she cool but she dumb
nothing at all wrong with white pride, we aren't going to be told to be ashamed of being white
:)
troubled waif......a worrying woman's woman.
She has awesome hand movements.
#Hillaryforprison
Great interviews Sam.
Ok, so how did White Extremism become a thing in the Pacific North West? I thought that the PNW was a Bastion of Progressive Culture. I was taught that Racism was a Southern thing. Is that not true? Is it possible that there are Northern States that are more racist than the South? Shut my mouth and call me cornpone!
join interracially against racism on facebook
Sam is so awesome
No promises re: punching people in the face.
LOVE!
Samantha Bee for president!
I hate full frontal, it leaves nothing to the imagination.
Does anyone realize that Oregon is so liberal that you can't even fill a vehicle gas tank yourself? you have to have a trained gas attendant.
I truly pity anyone that regularly watches Samatha Bee. You cant be saved at this point.
But where are these terrorists attacks? Where are the reports? Deaths? Injuries? There are constant reports of attacks from leftwing radicals, constant reports of attacks from radical islamists, constant reports of attacks in places like the Philippines from religious radicals.
Don't you have some cancer patient to mock?
What an evil hag. Why does she get a show?
The propaganda is real.
Astia sunt rasishti prin America? Nu stiam.

I'm proud to be white.
Yeah I too dislike those terrorists that dress all black and destroy Berkley... oh wait
Why won't she ever bring up statistics in her propaganda ? Come on Samantha you are on the right side of history. Just talk about the statistics lol. \n\n\n\n\nOh wait. She literally can't.
I love all the links to the studys shes getting all of the numbers from
Magic video!
Hey it's not racist if your black and hate white people, it's only white people who are even capable of racism.\n\nHerrrrrr durrrrr...
What about the terrorists on the left beating people and damaging property.
ANTIFA?

Good going sam!
WATCH THE GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD FOR TRUTH!@!
I just can't like this girl....
More dislikes than comments.. and this is considered trending?
Hate towards cancer patients 🤔
unfunny
keep punching nazis
More Alt-Left propaganda... 👎🏿
Hahahahahahaha \nFakenews \nAmericans are not nearly as racist as we are portrayed by fakenews.
I really hate this woman... white pride is fabricated... I'm white and know white people and don't hear anything about racist thoughts...the terrorists are the left fuckwads that attack people randomly
Thank you Sam for pointing out the blatantly obvious to anyone who can do a google search on terrorism in the USA. People should already know this, but we have to be led by a comedian to actually look at the facts and statistics.
Am I supposed to give her my movie ticket?
1k dislikes?.. Keep going with this stuff Sam clearly we still have a problem..
Meanwhile in Europe...
Genuinely curious if Samantha has done a show on brown nationalism or Islamic supremacy? If one attack in America killing a white person can spark this kind of content then hundreds of attacks by one group, there has to be at least one video. If there is let me know I'd love to watch it and see if I can donate to ending hate towards whites.
Sam - flies like a butterfly, stings like a Bee!
Samantha, now do you see why Trump is POTUS?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFUIVfKTeVg&list=PLrEnWoR732-BHrPp_Pm8_VleD68f9s14-&index=1
95% blacks are Savage animals deserve to be put in zoos They ruin schools communities raping pillaging and murdering  basically a walking talking disease like cancer
Talking about brainwashed america liberals have destroyed this world
I think we can all agree that Oregon is a terrible place where you can't even pump your own gas.
Why aren't whites allowed to be proud of who we are? Every race has and had bad people, why does every white person have to be held accountable for it?
What about the violent leftists terrorists at Berkeley? Didn't one just stab a woman in the neck because they disagreed with her? You know, the left that's been rioting and sending death threats to a Jew......acting like nazis.
Choke on a bowl of dicks.
You know if someone wold say the mojordy of the tarist are black it's racist then if you say the same about white people it's not then oh wait that means ur still racist to White people wich we come to the hidden Truth this Sam is racist.
Oy vey goyim support non-whites  and have  multiracial children.
Those pesky christians blowing people up
Trump is a white supremacist racist, just like his white hooded daddy.  End of story.
Hey Trump supporters, we know reading is hard but the blank says Add a Public Comment not Add a Pathetic Comment.
You have a nasty attitude. I can't wait until you ruin your own career. \n\nAnd Trump WON!!!!!
The title should be changed to Life after Modern-Day Liberals. It's essentially the same thing.
You know how to not solve the problem people? By alienating white males... It's not like they are the one group you need to be working with to come together. It's only going to fuel more racism but keep it up guys let's drag everyone back 60 years to make yourselves feel better about Trump being president. We need to stop awarding people for playing victim or else why would anyone want to change (Hollywood).
Of course YouTube trends more leftist propaganda, you're not even trying anymore Sam, you're just making entire segments out of Salon and HuffPost articles, but your viewers have such cognitive dissonance they don't even care! They're worse than 45 supporters.
I wish BLM supporters would start coming out of the hate closet too.
Nice! Now call out the BLM supramicists and Communist Antifa...oh wait..
White supremacy isn't a problem here in America and if you think it is you're lagging behind the rest of us
*THIS IS ALT-LEFT PROPAGANDA*
Marxist authoritarian trash.
No, you should definitely punch Nazis. That's what our grandpas did in Europe and that's what we should do here.
Yet Soros funded haters cannot let go.
Classic racist garbage. Thanks for nothin Samantha Bee. Talk about both sides. AKA BLM. -I hate white supremacists, I hate black supremacists.
You are intellectually dishonest
Pure propaganda. Sad faggots who watch this
Boycott Samantha bee. She's a vile screeching cow who blatantly lies and has been coughs lying in almost every episode. Do not trust her for any entertainment or news.
How to make so perfect picture in stream? What equipment should I buy?

Hi... As a long time viewer... I have noticed that there is a lot of flagship priced phones...band they are covered well...   Now that phones are 700 dollars each there is a market that both iPhone and Android types of phone do offer cheaper versions.\n\nWhat are your top pics at various price points.\n\nAlso. Bigger is not always better. Modern phone hardly fit in my pocket now. \n\nI'd like to see a real comparison for the majority of users price point.   And that is base to middle price point.
Congrats!youll be at 10M in no time

After watching this i thought I watched Narcos Season 1 completely. I was looking for this story throughout the season. 😂😂😂😂
I'd watched this.
It's amazing how you get this video to look like a completely different show. With dynamics, plot and all!
This would be an excellent movie
This was done so well I forgot that it wasn't real. Bravo, Bravo 👏🏾
I would watch a whole series of stranger things with the voice over of blr. Or the movie  IT. Do it, do it now!
Look where your flippin' fingers are. It's not cool to have a hand stuck in your anus. Was so fitting of a line for a hand puppet.
I've never watched Narcos but if I do, I'll be disappointed it's not this.\n~ A.P.
Supernatural bad lip reading please!
*Аrе yоu loокing fоr hot datеs in уour neighbоurhoоd?*

0eKdNcP4xrM,\n *Thеy here ➤➤* http://gozon.ru/hot/?v=0eKdNcP4xrM_970014
You should BLR the MADDEN 18 coach cut scenes! Lmfao they look like they're talking trash to each other! DO IT!!!
what are the songs used in the video?
I'd REALLY like to see this.
What's the song that starts at 5:59 ?
Almost as funny as mideval funtime land. Almost; but just as good.
Who else wants to see this show instead of narcos?.
Would probably be the best rom com of the century
Mama need to hit that! kills me all the time!
I'm glad I watched the show way before this came out. Haha wish this was a movie.
Lol... Can you make another The Walking Dead blr
This looks so much better than the real show.
wait, is he making all this music too?
I want to see this version
This is comedy at its best good one
but they love me... - I know...  This is brilliant.  How did a bad lip-reading make me feel like I watched Lars and the Real Girl? Touche universe...
Another BLR breath of intelligence in a generation devoid of creativity, originality and genuine humor.
You guys have to do the scene in Tombstone when Doc Holiday meets Johnny Ringo.
I have no clue what the real show is about, but I wanna watch this show instead....
This sounds like a really good fake movie... now I want to really watch it.
Does anyone know the song at 6:10?!?
This was a bit of a tear jerker.
Poeeeease do another Game of Thrones one
Who are you? Your beautiful firstborn son!LOL!!!
Pepe saw me pooping while I was eating s'mores and also crying.
This is better than the actual movie! 😂
Can this please be real. Like I said please.
What's the song at 6:10?
Pablo is like the H3H3 of crime 😂
I'm looking for the song lol
I've watched the show but this vid was believable!
The gun is real 😂
I wish this was a real show!
Is this the real plot of the show?
was this really part of the real story? or drama started now.why not using same voice.
do the new Steven King's IT. please?
If this was what the actual show was like, I would still watch it... lol
They don't post near enough.
Okay BLR you need to get this green-lighted and get the director from Napoleon Dynamite to direct it. You guys have a hit here.  I want to see this in theaters by next year.
Amazing how it actually looks like they're saying it based on looking at their lips
I'd watch this if it was a real movie. This was awesome, lol
Being a big fan of the show I think this is an excellent spin on what the show is actually about, I mean this is so cool!
This is the first time I've ever been interested in watching this show.
I love you guys. If it is possible you should redub a whole show.
I only date women who have little tiny fingers.
Definitely prefer this translated version of the show.
That's the plot of a Bollywood movie called Don.
Anyone know what's the music at the end?
3:14 killed me.  I'm dead now.
Press the cork board up so the entire manatee is behind the preacher. I like blr's new style. Making it suspenseful, humorous, family related, then emotional. This should totally be a real movie taking out some funny parts. I think this was a great blr and blr should make more like this. Your head IS a butt.
This pisses me off cuz I want this to be a show now,  and I'll never see it
Narcos was good but I wanna watch this show
Best video of the year........Have my subscription u fellaz
I love this BLR film. 😂😂😂😂😂
When is it coming out?
Can i have just have the full version of the song at the end please
Two words...\n\nPURE GENIUS!
Wow. That was really really good. I'd see the shit out of that movie.
Do one of The Sopranos!
Maybe a salad\nI don't train myself to starve\n😂😭😂😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome and the real show is a freaking masterpiece
Never thought love had much of a point. But I was wrong: it has a thousand points. #incredible
What's that song at the end?
This parody trailer was more cohesive than many other real trailers.
This should be the actual show
This was awesome. Just binged all 3 seasons. Loved it!! And this!
Bravo! I'd watch this version.
Great job. Love this show. 👍😎💸
Hi Bad Lip Reading can you do Jacob Satorious--sweatshirt please and thank you
this story is more interesting then the real narcos
I'm really disappointed that this isn't how Narcos really went lmao
This is LITERALLY the exact opposite of the show 😂
Love it...
Funnnnnnny
OH HEY MEXICAN FOOD
Meby babaque or meby burrito
SOY PAPLO!!!
Wack
Omg. Please make these happen
Soy Milk.\n\n\n\n\n\n*Wait*
5:30 is my fav bit. 😂
YES!!!
feel that pinch?
This deserves and Emmy
That really impressed me.
This is beautifully edited. Bravo, BLR!
Wow bravo!!
Please do Stranger Things
This is legendary
*Boo-yah Homie*
From this valley they say you are leaving\nWe shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile\nFor you take with you all of the sunshine\nThat has brightened our pathway a while\n\nRIP good sir
RIP dear Harry (Carl) :(
Seeing him play this made me deeply happy. I think he's one of the finest actors around.
We need a Harry Dean Stanton sings Country album, ASAP!
R.I.P.
Rest in Peace Harry
Good night, sweet prince. :'(
Love Harry, such amazing artist!!!
Who in the world would leave a thumbs down?  Seriously???
Rest in peace Mr Stanton. You are cool until the very end
This made me tear up. Rest in peace, man.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You will be missed.
Rest in Peace, Harry!
oh fuck, just heard about his passing. What a man though, a long life being in great movies. I'm so glad Lynch brought him back for Twin Peaks, this scene especially was just the sweetest thing.\nWe'll miss ya, Harry ;_;
... it's a fuckin' nightmare.
We have had the privilege of receiving Harry Dean as a Lynchland Guest recently, and we shared his 15 favorite songs in a special Guest Mix on his birthday on July 7th.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/HarryDeanMix
RIP Harry, you lived a good long life and were a damn fine actor.
So beautiful. Rest In Peace, Mr. Stanton.
CUTE!
He was a cool guy
Thanks. I like it https://goo.gl/xyuXiF
And we will miss you, and your great music, & acting Harry Dean RIP but,= at least your music lives on to be listened to & enoyed + still to shine on!
Rest in peace legend
Legendary character actor Harry Dean Stanton died on Friday 15.9.2017.
I am not the only one who thought this one of the best moments in the series. RIP.
Rest in Peace Harry, You never delivered a single bad performance. I hope they have a cigarette waiting for you in heaven.
is it just me or is the sound a little weird?  low volume and 'wavey'.
RIP the great Harry Dean!
RIP Carl . Glad we got to see you again in Twin Peaks The Return.
Rest In Peace, Harry Dean Stanton xx
RIP- This is a tough jam, knowing it as his last.
Rest In Peace, brother.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.  May Carl Rodd finally find some peace.
R.I.P I will keep my blood
I had a dream about him last night. So sad. I thought he would live forever!
R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton Kudos to David Lynch for letting him appear in Twin Peaks - The Return and for making him play his guitar and sing. :'(
The light went out at the Fat Trout Trailer Park. RIP Harry Dean Stanton (aka Carl Rodd). You'll be surely missed by all TP fans.
RIP. A legendary actor and a great one at that
Rest In Peace brother. So glad I got to see him preform one last time.
THANK YOU FOR ALL THE MEMORIES! YOUR SMALL PARTS AND FILM WILL BE REMEMBERED!!!
I just want to say, good night, sweet prince, may flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace.
Farewell, Harry. You went out still giving your best.
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton you golden voiced champion. I'm so glad we got to see so much of him in the new Twin Peaks.
i love harry dean stanton so much. idk why. but hes just so loveable
My favourite classic country song.
Such a lovely scene.
R.I.P. Harry...

This guy is honestly the best Youtuber alive
His voice is not cut out for his work.
OMG!!!!!!!!! I GOT THE BOOOOOOK!!!!!!!!!! AND ITS GOING TO BE HERE IN ONLY 7 DAYS!!!!!! I AM SOOOOOOO HAPPY OMG!!!!!!!!!!
Why do you do this to yourself ???? It's so painful
he flipped us off lol not really
Hello Coyete,\n\nDid you try getting shock from Electric Eel and Are you planning on trying it out with Electric Eel in any time future?
This guy earned his subs, other people like lispyjimmy, mrbossftw, and other youtubers, clickbait, it's pathetic, btw congrats brave wilderness on 8 million subs you earned em. 👍
You should go to Puerto Rico
Lol he said it's called secret beach I live in Hawaii and pretty much every beach someone doesn't no the name of they call it secret beach
The only entertaining YouTuber who doesn't clickbait
I want to see that you see a koalah
I love you so much I want to live with you
I thought it was corny. Then, I thought it was cool. Now, I subscribe.
Does anyone wonder how he hasn't killed himself yet? No? Only me? Ok.
i really like it !
mark: how did that happen??\n\ncoyote: chiw chiw
Im getting spongebob vibes from that urchin
PaYoTe CeTeRsOn
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKRnASBWr8vZ61VMG06CzHPuqXgBeoxA8
The helmet urchin is the roomba of the tidepools
But that intro doo
i believe in grocery shopping guy @2:56
me and my twin have touched sea urchins (not spiky)
*(Coyote Gets Hurt Over And Over And Over Again.)*\n\nMark : You Alright? Did He Get Ya?
Dis guy cool I'm gonna watch his vids
He should of had on finn's backpack when he said Adventure Time. 😂
*gets stinged blleed like millon times* me:I think he already dead but he is a ghost :|
And where there are marine creatures, there is coyote.
+ you were in kuai and i was in Ohou so i still would not have seen you
I found sea urchins have their anus on top, like starfish. But that aside, this is great to witness :D Never knew they came in the helmet variety, and that shrimp is really awesome.
i love this channel, congrats on 8 million!
Well deserved 8 mil subs man. Every video has good detail, perfect camerawork and a funny host.  Please consider making documentaries of the places you visit (40-50 minutes).
Its all on set
as if you're gonna wear pants at the beach
Hi
Explore Great Barrier Reef
CONGRATS ON 8MILL
When u say island what comes to my mind is Australia
Steve Irwin: Wow mate, we got a little Alpheidae here!\nCoyote: Whoa, I got some kind of shrimp creature. I'm going to gauge its pinch (attaches shrimp to nipple)
*i wish coyote was my teacher 😂 much better than Mr. Raymond 😔*
i love eating raw sea urchins :0\nit just melts in your mouth!
I ment to say frog  by accident
Whoever does the background music makes it feel like a movie
And where there are marine creatures, there's Coyote
you sound like charlie from sunny lmao
make a draw my life
Congrats on the big 8mil! Well earned :)
Coyote NEEDS to do an episode with sharks in it! like if you agree
Yo How He Got Health Insurance For All The Stings And Bites He'd Taken Dude?
10:50 Brave Wilderness Movie in the future possibly..? 🤔
Can you please get bit by a horse for the next video? Thanks
Do one in Hawaii
grats on 8mill!!
AWESOME
u heard elf on the shelf, how bout stinger on da finger
Secret beach? Isn't that the same beach Logan Paul was in?
call 1-800-NIPPLE-1928 now to support ppl with diarrhea!
humans are miraculous creature. they eat everything whatever they get.
what is the intro music used during your commentary in the beginning, it was awesome!
This feels like a fieldtrip! I feel the stress going away.
aren't some sorts of shrimp have some sort of venom/poison deal with their spikes?
Who dislikes these videos? wtf
10:56 Woah a rainbow
The end tho omg 😍
4:29 age restriction
When COYOTE Plants All His Creatures facts .
The 2nd time he got spiked I got the Crap scared out of me lol
This channel is like Cartoon Network Adventure Time, but in real life lol
When I hear island I think of Tasmania. YOU ARE NOT AUSTRALIAN GTFO OF HERE
海外の大物YouTuberを見ると日本のYouTube界を恥ずかしく思います。
Well done on 8 million , when I used to watch Brel and she was in 3 mil for forever and we just raced passed her
Coyote get stung again mark it got you again?
Looks like a peppermint shrimp
cody come to lousana to get bet by a co\nper head
Can you do a getting bit by horse video? Please.
This is FAR more scary than Joy Of Creation xD
I think he shouldnt use a title like that, it rests content on the video. In my opinion exploring the tide pools of hawai would be more fitting
It looks so much like Reunion Island !!
Did anyone jump when he held it and it stung him?
Why dont you guys have a show in TV???
it looks like a peppermint shrimp, which is pretty common.......
CONGRATS FOR 8 M SUBS!
Or a trained Rottweiler
Starmie @14:41. Thanks me later.
THE QUALITY
10:30 😍😍😍😍
Hey Coyote you've had that watch for a rlly long time, go get a new one from Leathertavern.com!!
Brave Wilderness should be on TV everywhere. It reminds me of Deadly 60, just without the list and ranks 😂
I don't like The start when we get a sneak peak
sea urchins taste good
2:58 did anyone else see coyote fail at parkour and feel really embarrassed 😂😂
I hate sea urchins.  One stung me and it hurt like hell.\nWhen stung, the best natural treatment is to pour urine on the stingers.  NEVER, try to pull the spines out as this would cause swelling and infections.  Because they are barbed, if you force the spines out it will cause a massive cut.
It can't only bother me the way he says burrow
It's like a tiny little civilization in one little pool. \nAnd that Fills you with determination. Any other undertale fans?
he should make a episode on animal planet👏👏
Love your vidios
😱😱😱you are awesome
I know this is early, but are you bringing Nicki Star Tip back for this Halloween?! I LOVED HER 😍
Hellooo this cake is AMAZING you are so much talented, hello from Belgium!😊☺❤😃😀😘
Try the Japanese cheesecake
WATAMELON
Would be extremely cool if nick opens a cupcake cafe/Pop up store x everyone would live for those gorgeous cupcakes & cakes !! 💖
Nic's FREAKSHAKE brings all the views to the yard.... He could teach you, but he'll have to charge.... $30 😂😂😂😂😂😂
NICK!! i have a burning question: are you never triggered/annoyed by the crumbs or the sauces (anything liquid really) drip through the crevasses on your table (or work bench or whatever you call it)? like how do you clean it... (im huge fan of your creations btw!!)
Still waiting on PEACH, dude!
This is #watermelongoals 🍉🍉🍉🍉
Always love the freakshake cupcakes :D\nIf you're ever interested in making freakshake freakshakes that'd probably a be a big hit too! I know /I/ would love to see them
This guy needs to be on cupcake wars!!!
Anyone else miss it when Nick points with his fingers the ingredients needed for the recipe? I do.
Too cooked for this
His creations are so unique, cute, and impressive, and I love how his personality shines through in his work. If he doesn't already it'd be too cool if he opened up his own little bakery.
here since 20k...but i always forgot to subscribe rip
you are making good
Who actually watches this and makes it im just here to crave sugar.
This is the perfect Halloween treat to hand out on the South Side of Chicago next month. Just don't put them in a big bowl, leave them on the porch, and tape a please take only one sign. You might cause a gang war over who gets the most watermelon cupcakes
Any suggestions for substitutes for all of the milk products?
Why does the butter look like cheese
There's a cupcake in my home made of watermelone
That's a neat mixer
Everything you put out is so amazing and looks gorgeous.
Can you made smores macarons and plis continue making freakshakes cupcakes i love them, love your decorations, especially the ones with the donat lol
Looks good I'm new to your channel
Ur vid just got likeeeeeedddd😅
I just want to stick my finger in that hole.
I just love you. You are beautiful and amazing
ur editing is awesome (small youtuber admirer here) I spend more time on my thumbnails then I do on my videos. Maybe I need to reverse that
Do u need the Greek yogurt?
Where do you buy your cupcake liners and what's the brand ?🎂
So creative! These are so cute!
Done!! and loved the video
Man I thought it was called Watermelon freshcake my god I can't read

Omg nick this is so beautiful keep it up
I love this even though I say im gonna make this I never do who else can relate
Nice cupcake!! Now, can you cake it? I mean turn it into one of your high-level cakes, not making a giant version of it.
I love your accent. It makes my day and your videos so much better 😬😁
Yes so ready for fall, summer is out the door as soon as Sept 1st hits to me lol I will not miss you Summer goodbye.
Summer almost over in the US means for you summer is almost starting! Love the vid as usual 😻

What A Cupcake!
Yay Watermelon!!!
omg yaaaaaaaaasssss!!! <333
Omfg, don't worry sweetie. Rosanna Pansinos children fans always do this, they accuse people of copying her when they didn't at all or because it was never her original work to begin with! They legit do this ALL THE TIME. They did this to Ann Reardon with the unicorn cake that was never Rosannas original creation to begin with. Who knew watermelon flavor cake in the summer is copying someone lol. P.S, your cupcake is way cooler and more creative!
I love the way you say choc chip! \nCan you make a Chai latte freak shake with TimTams on top? I did the TimTam slam with chai tea and it was AMAZING!

'Dude this is crazy I can't believe you have a kid'
Idk why but I totally teared up when Bart's mom started talking to Taika in Chinese just after Tiff spoke to him in Spanish... Boy's gonna grow up in a beautiful mix of cultures <3 Welcome to the world Taika!
I just spent like five minutes listening to an asian woman recite a speech to a baby.
Who are the 178 (at my time of viewing) haters? I swear some people have no life, you can't just wish them happy? Does it trigger you that much that these awesome people are happy and you're unhappy about you're freaking life? Seriously!
Well I know how everyone in the comment talk about Taika and how cute he is.... But can we take a moment and appreciate Geo's beauty... I mean she still looks sexy and hot AF... Wow... Go girl...
i love it when babies are happy like taika. upset babies r sad
For those wondering if there was a Tiff nip slip. I was watching very closely and no there wasnt because of her bra. But at least we got to see the size and how big her boobs are.
Beautiful
barbellbrigade.com why don't you fucking open your website first eh?
I love Tiffany so much! She seems so sweet and motherly!
david's going to be a great uncle
I was out of power and signal for a week so I'm finally here to say congrats!!!!
Taika is such an ugly name...
Hate to ruin the mood, but Taika DOES NOT mean strength in Hawaiian! Mana means strength in Hawaiian! But Taika does mean tiger in Maori! But congratulations to you, Bart and Geo! I'm so happy for you two!
i should seriously stop watching their vlogs when i eat
Asian babies on average have bigger heads. I'm terrified for Tiff!
he's half beaner like you LMAOOOOO
I can't find catfish anywhere  pls help with a link pls
He was born on my birthday ahhh
26:50 I thought the baby was in the bag...
Omg I just thought of it. The baby might have to learn 3 languages.
The Maori word for Tiger is Taika! so he's literally a little Tiger, soooo cute!
Geo must b so loose if she didnt tear or anything
Jesus Christ. I cringed when Bart moved the baby without supporting the neck at 16:10.....
Seeing how proud you are to be a dad is inspiring Bart!
6 hours...lol I was  in labor for 4 days ...but omg I've been watching you guys for so longggg....so happy for you two...such a beautiful baby boy💞
17:49 David says fool look like he smoked a blunt 💀
Davis is such a good friend, he likes to act thought but he is a teddy bear.
Amazing guys!!!! congratulations bart and geo your going to be amazing parents well done geo you done it!!
I don't speak that shit bro
Very unique name best of wishes
I know I'm late but congrats you guys! I'm so happy for y'all.
taika sounds like a girl name
Happy for you two, Congratz on the new born!!!
This baby is gonna be so loved. Tiff cared for him so much. Seeing the baby stop crying when Bart touched him was so cute .
I'm sooo happy for you guys!!! 😊😊😊

Ikaika is the Hawaiian word for strength, not Taika lol.
I just had my baby this Sunday and I'm so happy
Awweh, this makes me miss when my second baby girl was born ! Same thing as well, LOTS of hair, chubby, xD and everything !\nCongrats you guys :) Taika is such a handsome baby boy ! Enjoy them while they smoll, cause they grow hecka fast ! My . Myra was born December 29th 2016 and now she's almost 1 years old, time flies !
Also laughing at exactly how much Bart looks like his mom, she literally looks like Bart as a woman I'm crying LOL
Why does tiff no so much about changing diapers and swaddling
Someone forgot to blur out Tiff's breast.
Bart did you hear Tawin answer your mom with hecups
Around 9:27 Bart smile looks exactly like his mother.
Bart you are going to be a badass dad
Jesus every moment of your life your videoing, your son is born maybe just be there and take it all in smfh, these vloggers
Taika is about to be tri-ligual AF
Am I the only one who is thinking , who is that asian girl in the beginning of the video???
I love Bart's mom soooooo much!!! She seems to always be so genuinely happy and full of life! Congratulations!
Just wanna ask, is taika considered big for a newborn baby?
He's tall looking
Congratulations to y'all 😍😍☺️☺️🙂🙂 Baby boy is so cute 😍😍☺️☺️😘😘
Congratulations on the birth of Taika!💐
Damn he's gonna speak 3 languages
Awww I cried!!! I cried! Tears of happiness for you both, ma & pa bear! 😭😍
Oh my god, this all happened so fast! I'm so happy for you guys, he's adorable!

Batty? Isn't that homophobic, I should write for tabloids, this just in Judi Dench is a Dench homophobe
Haha. Stupid music, but fair play to her
Loved her in eastenders playing Peggy Mitchell. Legend

Fuck Judie Dench the chav bitch
Disgusting UK chav low class peasent culture mixed with a proper British legend?  This is absolutely disgusting...
lol thats not rapping you mean cancer
I hate this kind of music.
That moth story wasnt funny. It's just endless blather with a mediocre punchline(look haha, you waited all that time for that shitty punchline, haha). Great comedians have a philosophy and an attitude to share. Not this guy it seems. \nIf you want what this guy is trying to do, but well done, try Hannibal Buress\nWant a great refined comic try patrice o neal.
do one on Sean Evans' show 'Hot Ones'. There's a video of him eating a carolina reaper with Chilli Klaus. He talks about how people drop their guards when their mouths are burning, especially with celebrities who have to portray an ideal persona in front of a camera. I think its quick sick how he utilizes this phenomenon to create interesting interviews, because at first glance you're not quite sure what's so intriguing, its just people eating hot food after-all.
Hey @Nerdwriter1 I'm curious to see what you can come up with doing some research into Trevor Noah and his career and comedy. PLs leave a comment if you decide to go down this road :) or if you think Nerdwriter should do a video on it :)
this channel its only getting better and  better. I always thought that Norms art was something that needed to be understood and analyzed. it surprised me that someone actually did. Keep the good work going!!!
Heyyy.. I don't know how else to get in touch with you so I'm posting it as a comment here. Your website is down.. I'm not sure why but then I when I tried to access your must reads page.. It didn't work.. Please try to fix it. Thank you for the videos you do And waiting for more content from you. Bye.
do the great ERIC ANDRE
Nice one! Any thoughts on Stardust?
Do a video on the millennial whoop please.
That Moth Joke Punshline is brilliant in so many ways , hilarious
What is that music at the end? Please tell me It's amazing.
Can you do one on Mitch Hedberg's comedy?
Love Norm. Okay, can you watch The Vietnam War and do an essay on Ken Burns? Or not. I'll take a stab at it.
Norm has always been my favorite ever sense I was a kid
Now that was funny. (The punchline, not the video, though, that was enjoyable too.)
Thank you for introducing so many people to my favourite comedian! I love you!
This guy was a real jerk!
Thank you for putting me on to Norm MacDonald. So good!
I use norm jokes/lines in real life every chance I get. most the time people don't get it. I care not.
That punchline at the end was worth it.
I didn't get Norm until he was explained to me in earnest tones with jaunty  background music. CHEERS MATE
This video was sponsored by Man Grate!
Great video man, he is a singular comedian, something to add is that he improvises must off his long jokes and tries to find sparks of funniness in the way, but at the same time he has a beacon of safety of  jokes he thinked before if he loses the path in the way, love him man is like he jumps off a cliff everytime he starts saying something, and hope that his stream of consciousness gives him wings to dont crash in the pavement, but when he crashes is still hilarious.
Hey can you do one of your videos on prison break? I would love to see how you interpret it.
Yeah, Norm tells too many shaggy dog stories to be truly funny. By the time he's done, I've lost interest and don't remember the setup enough to find the punchline funny. He does this because he's lazy. It's far easier to tell a half dozen or so shaggy dog stories and call it a comedy special than than to think up funny material worth our time. \n\nMost of his jokes are puerile in nature and are no better than a poor _Knock-knock joke._ He just takes it too far and stretches it into another of his shaggy dog stories that were much better left alone as Knock-knock jokes.
Norm Macdonald is totally polarizing. Love him. I was jerking punks off under the Queensboro Bridge until I found his work.
Do you work for vox?
I was following you until I saw sarah silverman on the comedy greats screen
The last few months I have become obsessed with Norm. and voila! a video which explains why he is so unique and why I am so drawn to his humor like a moth to a flame
he's nothing on stewart lee tho, brits do this sort of comedy far better
Thanks for shining a light on him for all us moths!
How about a video on Rick and Morty?
Man, your voice-overs are getting better! You sound more serious, and less like you want to be smooth or seductive.
Please do Rick and Morty!
Please do one on Stewart Lee... PLEASE EVAN!
I….don't see it.
You should do a video about Mitch Hedberg because he was a genius.
Never seen this channel before, but as a Norm fan and a nerd writer myself, I appreciate the coverage. New subscriber.
Please upvote this for Science [Serious]\nI am looking to fill up our quota for early testers for a Master your Humor Game project at Purdue Uni, that we are doing to further application of humor research.

Strongly agree, on all points. \n\nI believe I recall watching one of his candid discussions (I believe with Letterman maybe?) where Norm's comedic personality was discussed and I recall it being mentioned that...to paraphrase...too many comics try to be intellectual but Norm understands...play the simpleton. Be the everyman. Because if the audience sees you trying to be the smartest person in the room, they're going to hate you.\n\nBut I believe, to anyone who investigates further and listens more closely, his brilliance becomes evident.
Never watch SNL but after watching this I definitely need to look him up!
backgrounds of red screens with yellow accents, McDonald analogy?
That last joke stolen from Billy Connelly if I'm not mistaken.
I DISAGREE completely, Norm Macdonald is NOT a funny man.
I can definitely appreciate him and his craft more now, but yea, I don't think he's funny :(
I thought the video had something to do with McDonald's. And now I'm all hungry.
Am I the only one who remembered that JD used to tell this moth joke to a girl once in scrubs?
greatest of all time.
Huh, newfound respect for the way my Grandpa told jokes <3
Duh. What's next, a video on why Bob Dylan is an amazing songwriter? ...Oh wait...
This video was so brilliantly edited!
when uncle terry's been drinking... you don't fuck wit him
This video essay was excellently written and put together. Love Norm, love the video!
Love the red and yellow haha\n\nBut Im shocked to read a lot of comments that never heard of Norm
Nerdwriter - do you take requests? One of my favorite films is No Country for Old Men. ( I saw that ending coming, I swear I did!) I have my opinions about what it means, but I would love to hear your analysis.
I love this kind of long story telling humor.\n\nThere a guy that does his jokes like this.\nHe talk about the little things of his daily life. Then he start rambling and we end up forgeting what was the first point he was talking about, but that doesn't matter as his story telling mastery is to a point where although he end up making 4 hour long shows, every minute of it is an hysterical burst of laugh. \n\nThis kind of comedy is the best to me.\nIt require true skill to be able to pull this.
I just find out a great comic character i've never heard of ! :) Thanx Nerdie !
Norm would watch this video and completely disagree and say 'I'm just telling jokes man', he's awesome
Why do avoid a case study of the Mona Lisa ?
not my cup of tea. Like I get the jokes but the pay off is not worth the time I spent listening to it.
You should do a video on Stewart Lee
more canadian comics, they have ruled for years! jim carey?
This is a dude who nearly won $1,000,000 on Millionaire.
Where can I find that joke about the body
I'm so glad you uploaded this. Norm is one of my favorite comedians. I think his work, though underrated, is genius.
Love norm, like your vids, felt this was a weak one as i didnt really learn how/why norm is a genius past He's brilliant because he's smart. Just felt like a lot was left on the table. Maybe ill like it more when I come across it again in a year or two :)
Similar commitment to their own personal comedy: John Roderick and Merlin Mann
This guy sounds just like Lagos Cargo
comedian tells long drawn out jokes, not pandering to different styles of comedy. WOW - way to stretch out 1 sentence into 8 minutes
Maybe I'm one of the people who doesn't find him funny. Where's the joke
Could you do a video on howard stern?
I instantly recognized that the outtro music was a remix of mozarts requiem (lacrimosa) ^^
Wow. He just seems like an asshole
Wow. I went through that video for 7 minutes listening with mild amusement and thinking He really does sound like a comic genius, but one that isn't quite my taste. Then that last punchline hit me. It's taken me 10 minutes to stop laughing long enough to write this comment.
I like listen to you advertize to me sooooo much more than that Karly Kloss chick who uses WIX....and its easy to use and blah blah blah. Nerdwriter!
I _knew_ about Norm Macdonald but honestly had never seen his comedy. Thank you, again, Nerdwriter, for bringing something new (a perspective, an interest) into my life. I really like Norm's sense of humor, so now I've got to check out more. Where should I start - some comedy special, perhaps? I think I heard he has a podcast and I listen to podcasts daily so that might be an easy introduction.
Ah, the moth joke...one of my favorites.
RIP Norm. One of the greats.
I discovered that we don't have a similar sense of humour...
This video has changed my week so far.\nNorm really is a hidden gem, much like Stanhope.
in Norm Macdonald Live Sarah Silverman episode , she spotted Norm's wordplay and exposed it in a light way , part.1 minute 6:00 \n\nSarah really gets norm's comedy a lot more than everybody else
Please do a video about Stewart Lee.
Why am I watching a video on Norm Macdonald when I can watch brokeback mountain and watch a cock slip into some guys hot beautiful asshole
I love Norm MacDonald.
Turd Ferguson. Funny name
Stewart Lee?
Great vid Nerdwriter!
Thank you
#NormGod
Dude relax it's just norm Mcdonald
9/11
I LOVE Norm.
Phil Hartman, I dare you.
OMG i love this.
Please do Patrice O'Neal
So fucking boring.
Jim Jeffries
Yea, he seems okay, I think I still prefer Amy Schumer
Monty Python next?
Ugh. Norm MacDonald sucks.
Come on man, when people say he doesn't give a fuck, what they mean is that he doesn't care about being politacally correct or simply that he cames out with the weirdest shit. What are you down syndrome?
Where is the airdrop?
I would love that actually, to play this with friends, but the problem is when they got hit mostly people would lie i didnt get hit
Way too unrealistic, when they were looting, there wasn't 30 different pairs of pants in each room.
Nice video but it's boring there is no kills WTF
U should add shroud in here
even there was a team name rokat jump and type that  they reval is fire hand
Please do this again. And with more people
So small critic, there's two versions of the SCAR you used the SCAR-H image instead of the SCAR-L. Looks fun though
Having a Drone film overhead would make this amazing
When are they going to tell D it's Evike not Evick
I love D and jet

would be really cool if you would collab with Kyle Skelly from Plan Zero. I would love to see him try some gymnastic stuff or see you learn a cork or generelly some tricking moves.
I love you so much, your such a huge inspiration. As a martial artist aswell as a gymnast could I suggest gymnastics meets judo?

Though you were going to do some blindfold tricks

When u think yourself as a gymnast then u see Nile 😂  \nNile is my fav youtuber
these videos bring back so many memories of my younger days when i did some gymnastics. mostly what i remember though, is that the gym always smelled like ass....lol
Why is it every video is on trending but you haven't got at least 1M subscribers?
Nice fun and games but when it's on its on, keep rocking you guys great channel !
i love this style of editing, good job! @00:54
It is great to see that you are well Nile and training hard for the competition, I'm sure this effort will be rewarded. Hugs man
We LOVE you here in Atlanta, Nile. You're infectiously chiper and lovable. congrats on the champiionship and good luck in Canada.

Wilson is literally the best gymnastics male human being 👏👏👏
Trying to study Pharmacology and end here... XD \nLove you Nile!
There's a pic of u in my gymnastics hall
You guys are so lucky, I have always loved gymnastics but for the past couple of years I haven't been able to do any because the nearest gym with a men's team is several hours away, and the closest gym is an all girls one that I could walk to if I wanted. The pain is real
U even a champion?
Any small youtubers wanna support each other
I do gymnastics and you and the British team are such an inspiration to me
i train at this training centre it's so cool knowing that you go there too!!💗🤸🏼‍♀️🤸🏼‍♀️
I'm in love with the new editing
Anyone else just on here to look at fit men in shorts 😂
You're nipples are so small it's cute.

Do a backbend
Merci , de me faire rire, pleurer , sourir , et me donner envie de me dépasser dans mon sport à chaque fois que je regarde une de tes vidéos !!! 😉👍🎥\nContinue comme ca , tu est quelqun de bien en plus d'être un grand champion ! 😘🏆
I don't know why, but I'm like a solid 89% that Nile is gay, or at least bi.
what camera do you use?
Hey Nile! So lately in your video's i saw an amazing move wich I just HAVE to know the name of. Im really in handstands and that stuff so i would really like to know. It was a move where you were laying flat on your belly with your arms by your side, where you then quickly starded lifting your feet up higher and higher untill you got into a handstand. Then whilest in the handstand you slowly came down in a pushup manner to rest again, laying flat on your belly.\nThank you very much and i loveeee your videos. Keep it up!
Nile what do you think about gymnast lefteris petrounias
Nile , is there any way you could make a video giving advice to gymnasts like me who are finding it hard to resist quitting gymnastics and can't find much of a reason to stay in the sport :// I love the sport and couldn't imagine my life without it but I don't know wether to quit
hey nile do you think it's too late to start gymnastics at the age of nearly 15??\n\nEDIT: DAYUM 28 ON TRENDING LETS GO
I really want to do gymnastics but I have never done it before. I'm nearly 18 and feel like I won't be good enough to start gymnastics now. I'm not in the best of shape either. I know they do adult gymnastics by me at lillenshall but I feel like I won't be good enough or fit enough. Do yo have any advice or should I think Of something else to do.
Are you aiming for the Olympics again Nile?
Hey nile , i've been watching your videos since couple months and i was wondering if i could have a good level in gymnastic considering i am starting at 17 years old.\nAnyway keep up the good work bro
Random question: what hogwarts house would you think you'd be in?
Hi, I'm male and i was wondering if 19 is a good age to start gymnastics, i dont look for a competitive level, thanks everyone who answer my question.
Have you taken ballet?  You might investigate it, if not.  Bram Verhofstad moves like one, seems to actually slow time when he moves, it's thrilling to watch.  Somewhat like football player Lynn Swann, who was also a ballet student.  Your talent is so amazing, but it doesn't draw the eye in the same way.  Your movement could be not just thrilling, but breath-catchingly beautiful.
Are you going to do a section for ankle mobility on bodybible.life?
R u going to the next commonwealth games If so I might see u there cause I'm going there great vid!!!
Were you using a cup as a blindfold???
Have you ever tried the carmona on rings?
Hi Nile, I did gymnastics when I was younger but i was never flexible enough to advance to a higher level. It got to the point where my coach told my parents that they would have better luck spending their money elsewhere. I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?
Hey do you twist both ways in training or competitions? Im really only able to twist one way, kind of frustrating id like to see your take on it
Is he Scottish?
sorry thumbs down cuz clickbait\nand not going through with it
Guess what...?\n\n\n\n\nCHICKEN BUTT!
who sings along to her songs everday? like if u do:)
I love her sense of humor.\nThe fact that shes open about wanting a treehouse and cracks jokes like -whats up chicken butt- is just so very wonderful to see. And so very real; I would totally do that too!\n\nI feel like most other singers bury that side of themselves for a more stereotypical glitz and glam high society attitude(justin beiber is a fine example of that). I always find it really sad when talented singers succumb to pressure and bury themselves in parties and drugs just to fit in.\n\nNever change Grace. You are talented and perfect the way you are. I wish you a successful future!
Beautiful edit from Blythe. November seems like years away. Never waited for an album so eagerly in my life!
Now I'm going to watch Grace, and Darci!!!
I'm scared that her voice will change as she grows
Awww this is so cute! And gave me goosebumps!!
I want it so bad!!
love you and yes, this is just the beginning! The sky is only the starting point.
Who else saw her at we day today? Her performance was amazing! Keep up the good work😋😄☺️
You know what she sounds like? She sounds like Sia ❤ :3
Is that Colleen at 0:33??
She is just.. a little Sia\nI love her songs!
please read.\nhi  i just wanted to say. i pretty much just saw u singing and... oh my god .. you have a voice of an angels.. and the personality you have is just..amaizing, its been my dream to preform .....to sing and play my guitar to my own original songs....and i just so happen to be on youtube when your name popped up.....seeing u sing on stage.... made me believe that you can do anything u set your mind to. i dont know if your reading this...i dont know if youll reply.....but i think we could be great friends some day....and if you dont want to friends ....i understand heh .. AAAnyways... your talented .. EXTREMELY and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. ^_^
You are really cool
I just herd about you and you are amazing!!!!!!!
Back at it again with an amazing video
Amazing voice and amazing songs <3 love from Tunisia <3 <3

Youre a lil ball of sunshine. Dont ever change. Need to find a way to get your album shipped to Sri Lanka! \nSo much love!
I have become a fan of you ever since you auditioned on AGT. Ever since then I have listened to every song and all I can say is that I am so proud of you Grace. I am your age, and your music has helped me get through a hard time, and I hope to get to meet you one day! Love, Ana! :)
And dont forget, its better if you take a break of music(if it takes to much place you life) than waiting for it to be to much to handle, tip: dont make you suffer from music, music is here to make u feel good
Grace! You are amazing! The presonality you have is so precious. Thanks for being you in every step. Jesus is so pleased with everything that you do. You have inspired me to learn play  ukulele))))\nGo on! The best is yet to come! With love from Ukraine.
Not the Next Sia or Taylor Swift, but the First Grace VanderWaal. ☺
of course this is just the beginning because there are many more amazing things to come in your way good luck and i am always with you

I couldn't resist! https://vgy.me/ftcxaz.jpg
I love you 😘
PROUD
Grace, i'm a fan of yours. I enjoyed mostly every single song that you wrote. But there's something bothering me. I find it many of your studio version songs (Sick of Being Told, So Much More Than This, Gossip Girl) used too much effects. I don't find it bad or anything, but personally i think its better if it stays simple. Just you, and your ukelele. No effects.\n\n I enjoyed those songs, but when i see you perform the simple acoustic way (Ed Sheeran's A Team, your whole AGT performances, your iHeart Radio performances), its so BEAUTIFUL. There's something more to it, it drawn people to you. Those performances so magical, so beautiful and i don't understand what that is. And i think its better for your studio versions song stay that way. I'm not a music expert or something, just my opinion. \n\nNo matter what i always love you and will always support you! Thanks!\n\n(sorry for my english)
You are brilliant i love your songs ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎼🎶🎵🎵🎶🎶🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎵🎵
Could be a coincidence but she's releasing her album the same day as Taylor Swift. ANYWAY I AM SO EXCITED! AHJGGH I love Grace.
YOU SUCK STOP TRYING TO BE EDGY YOURE UGLY AND LOOK LIKE COCONUT HEAD
I think all fanderwaals will agree. Grace is one of the best music artists of all time. No question. :)
So in this imagination, they almost let their roommate choke to death and somehow slid across a whole floor using a body
Late to the trend.\nSorry guys, go home everyone.
Wach out the floor is lava!!
The floor is lava, but the floor is made out of water
Is he a spiderman??!!!!😨😱😰
This is awesome..but if the floor is lava...the lava would burn anything...
so funny at the end
yeah the lavas hot but not hot as me
I'm still a kid and I'm jumping to sofas even in the park this is my favorite game
lol 5:26 shows his hands slipping but then cuts shot and theyre back to full grip.
this is awsome the floor is virus
I saw this one on Facebook
It's so amazing and awesome l really liked it 😀
How much lava did it take to make this video?
In other parts of the world every else so was covered in balls
U would of died of either thirst or u would die from heat
I'm like floor is lava
If this happens in real life, i'm gonna fucking get my camera
I HAVE TO WAKE UP AT 7:00 7:00!!!!
R.I.P city and how did he didn't fall on 02:00
The floor is lava in\n3\n2\nHAP ME HAP HAP HAP AHHHHHHH
The floor is lava not the ground so why is there lava outside?
His name is gara from naruto
This is a c9ol grown-up imagination :)                     lol
U did your science and made him float on the lava
How can a person sleep in this heat?
Anakin skywalker almost died playing the floor is lava
The video is just black
fuck Freddie make Bret the new star
Reminds me of Ralphie May's Acid Trip on one of his comedy albums.
You would burn within short distance from lava anyway
That was great reminded me of a LSD trip I had.
IT'S A CHRISTMOS BLOODY MIRACLE
Is it real i am scart to deth
1:14 Oh look It's that there volcano movie....dante's peak.
Wait! If the floor is hot lava, then why on Earth aren't they scorching up into ash?!?\n\nLOGIC PEOPLE!!!
about a week ago
why doesn't the other items go on fire?
OMG i love the end its so funny
Just an excuse to climb all over shit lol
In reality they would die due to heat exhaustion
Now that was funny, couldn't stop laughing at the end, great job guys
lol i love it!
finally this channel coming back to life, i unsub 1 month ago after r.i.p video
This video caused 300mill worth of equipment to make
I love how they use Bret as a bridge to get across XD that must've hurt him to be like that while they climb on him LMAO
This is not really right
They could have put water over it, so it turns into obsidian ...
Would've made sense if they were sweating from the heat
rocketjump can you please view my latest video and tell me what you think I'm trying to have a channel like yours could you please give me some advice
PULLIN IN THE VIEWS ONCE AGAIN
This was awesome. Great production, as usual.
Using the body as a boat is surprisingly scientifically accurate, since the lava is most likely made from dense rock, a human body would be really buoyant
Did you guys see the clock in his room it was 2:19 nad then it changed to 3:44
This was so good
Omg

uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh . . . . . k
LOL SUPERB
I love your accent, I need it as an app on my phone that delivers bad news cause it's so calming!\n\nI remember going to a conference once and they got 20 of us round in a circle to share ideas of how a certain idea could be improved. There was a girl using a BSL interpreter to communicate and the general lack of awareness from most of the group (although I'm sure they didn't mean it) was bothering me.\n\nIt was one of those conversations where one person would stop talking and then somebody would immediately jump on their point as soon as they stopped speaking and the combo of not knowing when to speak and trying to pay attention to her interpreter basically meant that this girl wasn't really getting a chance to say anything. At one point I managed to make an opening for her (Is there anything you'd like to add?) but it made me appreciate how difficult that situation must be when trying to get involved.
Hi dear, do you find it harder to lip-read foreigners, who don't usually talk English?
I feel like a convo between the two of us in any public place would be a comedic disaster 😂😂😂 With my autism, I get overwhelmed easily, can't separate background noise from conversations I'm in, and can get really spacey (it's actually a mild dissociation to protect myself). This also leads to me starting and not finishing sentences, suddenly forgetting I'm being spoken to, and completely losing track of a conversation 😬 I feel like our spouses would just be sitting there like what are they even doing?! Do THEY even know?! 😂
Is it rude to tap deaf people on the shoulder to get their attention? I've just made friends with somebody who's deaf and wasn't sure whether that was the best way to involve her in a conversation when she's sat in her own world?
Learning key signs and the alphabet goes a long way! I'm hearing but I'm learning ASL and I used to attend a deaf club where hearing people could go to practice with HOH and deaf people and knowing basics signs/the alphabet was a saving grace.\n\n(Also now, I'm learning BSL because of you!! 💙)
Hi Jessica! I absolutely love your videos!\nMy grandfather is losing his hearing and I would love to get him to learn some signs as I think it would really help him as he often feels left out of the conversation. I know some signs (sign supported English like you use, not BSL) however he doesn't seem keen. Any advice?\nThanks!
I want to learn to sign so much!
These were really great tips! (Also #12 made me giggle.  Tone is something that wouldn't have occured to me, but it makes total sense).
Your sass makes this video! I never thought to give facial expressions to my voice to express my tone or attitude. Very informative wonderful video!
Great video Jessica. All I will add is that if people do some of the ruder points then I'm not sure I'd call them friends... I can't believe someone would actually cover their mouth for example and ask if you can hear them now! I suppose they're they same people who would take the mickey out of someone who stutters. 😕
I relate so much! I love your sassiness girl <3
gosh, youre so beautiful!! i love your style!!
Do you have a name sign Jessica?
I'm getting major Dorothy (Wizard of Oz) vibes from this outfit! Loving it! ❤️  Also, I can't believe people actually do this stuff. But your reactions to their ignorance are great. especially the crutch example.
I love these tips so much, thank you for sharing! You are a doll! ❤️❤️
I am very lucky to not be fully deaf. I have moderate-profound hearing loss in my right ear and mild-moderate loss in my left ear. Its much lonelier than a lot of people realize. On my first day of college last week our tutor decided it would be a great idea to split us into pairs and talk to each other as a way to get to know other people in the class except when everyone was talking at the same time there was so much noise that I couldn't distinguish one voice from another and so I couldn't communicate with anyone. I was the loneliest person in that room. \nAlso I have almost become intolerant of people who insist on speaking to me softly even though they know I'm deaf and I'm already on my third 'what?'
Also I'd like to say I love that you sign along in your videos. I've been wanting to learn BSL for so long and binge watching your channel has gotten me further than anything else so far!
Hi 👋🏻 Jessica that is really good things too know! I learnt a little sign language on a 10week course so I know a little but it's great to pick up signs from your videos too! Looking forward to your videos next week too! ☺️x
Thank you, Jessica, this is very helpful. Glad to know a notebook or cellphone might ease communication. Eye contact and heightened facial expression are good ideas. Can't believe some people 'test' your hearing by covering their lips - so rude.
Your voice is so down darn calming I love it
This is so incredibly useful! I especially appreciated the bit about it not being rude to pull out your phone and communicate that way if necessary. I might be hesitant to do that, afraid of offending someone, so it was good to know that you consider it perfectly fine. Also, I hadn't been aware that International Week of the Deaf was approaching, so thank you for drawing attention to it!
Plz plz plz check out my bsl videos it would mean the world to me I have a cover on my channel xx
Does Claudia know how to sign, Jessica? If you don't mind me being cheeky...what is sign for the bog? 😜 Happy International Week of the Deaf!
You're an amazing person. Thank you for this incredibly informative video. It's really helpful and important!
Thank you so much for today's topic, can relate to every item you spoke of. I sometimes do so well acting hearing ( like you, I do the hearing behavior without thinking) people forget I don't hear, and if I do not hear them then they think I am not paying attention( grrrr). Someone knowing a few important signs is wonderful! I have a question -  When you speak a word incorrectly, do your hearing friends ever correct you? If so how do you respond to this? Thank you again for sharing your list.
I say things in the wrong tone too and offend others without realizing it, but it's because I grew up in two different cultures. I also love some good gossip once in a while,  haha. I think you should make a video of some of these wrong tone incidences you've had in the past!
I love your videos! Growing up in had a friend (sarah) who was deaf and I got a basic sign language book and it was a great bonding experience with Sarah and she taught me games like writing a word on each other's back with our finger and guessing what the other wrote just by what we felt. I really learned a lot from her. I was in a sport with her and as we got older she moved away and life went on. Wish we had kept in touch. You are doing a great job educating people on what the world is like for you and how most of all you just want to be included. I hate that you get the some of the responses you do. But keep up the good work and I wish you and your wife all the best!!!!
Once again NZ is backwards to the rest of the world - our week of the deaf is in May. Im actually curious how you would deal with someone like me who stammers (or goes completely non-verbal at times) due to some of my mental health issues. Me and My ex used to spend a lot of time speaking through text because of it, and its why I started learning NZSL.
I absolutely love your personality 😄
This is so interesting, i wouldn't have thought of these things! At least now i know what to do when i meet someone who is deaf :) thanks!
Love your smile.
Great points 🌸🌹🌼
Great to know!!
This is really good for other people who have friends who are deaf or who work with them I've started my BSL level 1 and both teachers are deaf so these tips are going to be really helpful for when I'm communicating with them and any deaf people I meet xxx
I hoping to start my level 3 Signature course next month. Will have to be online as my local college only goes up to level 2. I'm in Cornwall and the closest 3 course is Bristol or Wales 😩
The sound keeps cutting in and out and I don't know if there's an ironic issue with my phone or with YouTube or if it's part of the point of this video... 🤔
Typical brit problem; I can't tell when you're being sarcastic! Feel free to use your phone (you arse), yes please!.
Thank you for this video! As a spouse of a deaf person this covers a lot of what I am constantly telling other people about my hubby.
Hello, I don't know any deaf people,  but useful things to know for when I do.\nIn other news,  my sponge rollers and lotta body arrived today. Tonight is the night. Wish me luck, I shall need it!! 😂💪🦄
I start my sign language class in two weeks and I can't wait!
Love all your videos! Relate so much to this... 5 is the worst, people will always whisper and ask if I can hear it. I have never thought of 9 but I always get a little sad after I have asked twice and they just give up. Like no I just can't hear you but I would love to know what you actually said having them use their phone will be very helpful.
Why hasn't Kim asked to do a tutorial wth her, she's perfect 😍
YYYEEEEESSSS PLEASE DIE YOUR HAIR BLUE !!!!!!!! IT WOULD BE AMAZINGLY  GORGEOUS !! love you ♡♡♡
The end hurt me really badly cause I can see when someone is in pain. Especially from a libra. When you shock your head up And looked down. I was like 80 percent sure you cried after. Which is okay! When I'm sad and I'm a libra I buy a lot of clothes. Lol not saying that's why you're buying shoes. But love you Carli and I don't like seeing you sad. 😭❤️😘
You sexxx
her cats 😩💗

is it just me or does you seem sad?.. i get major sad vibes. and you keep talking about going to the fashion show alone and you didn't show him in your vlog. i hope everything okay car 💔 love you
I think a deep violet/blue would look AMAZING on you - check out Color #330099 or #3300CC  ♥
How about blue black hair ? It will look beautiful on you ❤️
Love you Carli, you will get through this there's always light at the end of the tunnel ❤️
Don't try it now. Because it sounds like you going through a lot of changes in your life and we women we tend to change our hair, either color it or cut it when we going through life changes, challenges, breakup etc... so don't change it now but if you still feel the same way after a while then go for it. God bless (trust the process).
What was that kitty litter thing Bear was looking into?
This was great! Navy hair?? GO FOR IT! I think it'll look good on you. It's almost fall so why not?! If blondes can pull off pink you can def pull of navy! We live for these vlogs!!! Hope all is well w you and your fam! ♥️
Sending you lots of love and hugs yours way, also blue hair would look stunning on you!
Never go wrong with Velcro chokers!!! Cant understand why companies use chains... I guess so you'll keep buying them when they break🤔
Do NOT dye your glorious,BEAUTIFUL  hair.
Does anyone know what style those celine sunnies are?
What are your favorite shopping sites for clothing and shoes? I really love your style and I've been wanting to do some online shopping. Please help!
Yes to navy blue hair! It'd look so good on you!
If they broke up , its prob there busy schedules or the fact that Brett STILL hadnt proposed. No matter how much a woman says shes in no rush bla bla bla, no one wants to be the forever girlfriend.
I love you Carli!! I love your hair as gorgeous as it is but I think if you want to try something new, go for it, I know you can pull off everything literally! 🌻😃
I just died my hair blue and it amazing 😍 go ahead and do it ...👌🏼
How is your makeup so flawless 😩
I think you should dye your hair navy blue
Eggplant purple hair. Will look stunning with your blue eyes.
You should do a house tour ! ❤️❤️
I dyed my hair red recently and my hair RAPIDLY starting falling out. I'm currently in the process of treatment for my hair growth using castor oil and I don't know if I ever want to dye my hair again. Your hair is already beautiful and long. Don't dye it. 😢
CAN WE GET AN UPDATED SKINCARE ROUTINE
Yes to the blue hair!! I got dark navy blue on my ends and got so many compliments on it :)
Carli, honestly: you are GREAT and I follow you since a long time now, BUT I'm deep in love with your sister-friend (since I first saw her in one of your video when you transformed her! Can't you help me to come to know her? ;)
Unboxing must feel like Christmas morning every time
I love her love for animals. Shes so sweet and kind. 💜
Can you make this makeup look? Thank you
Hi Carli, I think you would look gorgeous with dark blue hair. Dark purple would also look great.

Think about it? I love and support you always. 💛

Total respect for the guy now... That's right dumbasses... TRUMP WAS NEVER CALLED A RACIST UNTIL HE BECAME PRESIDENT!! Do you like how they wanted to try and put them back in their box and he kept knocking them out with logic? ;)
It takes INSANE levels of balls for Mayweather to say this---especially since liberals will call him an uncle tom coon. True courage. Much respect.
HEY, HEY RADIO HOST, HE WANTS TO PUT DACA INTO LEGISLATION YOU IGNORANT FUCK
Floyd missed his chance to tell the interviewer that Trump threw the Dreamer Question back to the Congress and the Congress is doing nothing with it still.  Congress is doing nothing with it even today.  Congress abdicated.  It is the Congress's job to make the bill and submit to the president.  President executes after bill becomes law.  Execution is the job of the Executive Branch. Congress should do their job and make a bill about Dreamers and submit to the President for signature or veto.
As is typical, the other guy was misinformed.  And, as a result, he spreads misinformation.  Donald Trump does not want to deport the dreamers.  Trump doesn't even want DACA to be ended.  This is why he allowed it to continue for 6 months.  He stated that he wants Congress to pass it as an actual law.  \n\nWhat Trump wants is DACA ended as an unconstitutional executive order. and wants it passed as a constitutional law.  That is the point of the 6 month grace period...so those in the program will not be affected, while Congress works on it.  Even Obama admitted that it was unconstitutional, but said that Congress left him no choice.  Trump is being a boss, and putting it in Congress' lap, and telling them to do the right thing.  Don't expect the lying news media...any media...to tell the truth about this    Do your own research.   Look for White House press briefings on DACA.
Trump's lawsuits for discrimination against blacks was well known. I am a Trump supporter but he is very flawed.
Half you sheep were hating on this guy for no reason really and now your gonna dick riding him...
She jumps on him and says but you have a special life and he puts that idea right in it's place by saying no I didn't! I had to work to get this life!, That chick talks like the life he had was handed to him, crazy talk
Girl in the back in the pink is so fucking hot jesus christ
no one is saying anything.. look at their faces lolol..  keep on drinking..  keepin it real
Floyd Mayweather has tunnel vision. Donald trump supported him for the pacquiao fight. So he is supporting Trump. Thats all he see's. No one was saying he was racists until he said racist shit.
Mayweather has something that is very hard to find. COMMON SENSE.
Love how the girl tries at the end trying to mention he's rich and therefore privileged in some way and Floyd drops the truth bomb that he started from the bottom.
Typical ignorant shit from Floyd, he wants everyone to be as shallow and selfish as he is. And Trumps racist as shit, Floyd can't fuckin read so everything he knows about trump is some shit he heard, he can't do his own research. Central Park 5, justice department lawsuits showing denied blacks at his properties. Hell the man kept calling lil Jon Uncle Tom while he was on his show. Since Floyd isn't bothered by his behavior, how about Trump talk about fucking Floyds daughter in a few years and see how quick this bullshit changes.
That lady at the end is a fucking idiot.
Instead of y'all protesting.. why can't y'all be more progressive and start focussing on the real problems . Starting with your own lives .
I am now officially a Mayweather fan.
Sounds like Floyd sorts himself out Jordan Peterson style.
It's no accident Floyd is where he is in life. #TBE #MAGA #50-0
First of all, boobies. Second I'm happy Floyd answered that way.
now lets hope THIS video gets millions of views.. which probably wont cause ppl dont like hearing the truth. a damn shame.
Sounds better than socialist ass McGregor
Floyd red pilling! #MAGA #50-0
Floyd just went *51-0* TGE
Real recognize real.  This is too real for most people to handle or understand. #truth
Praise the Lord! Floyd is 100% right.  He's not a sellout like some of our knuckle head basketball ball playing and football players. Maybe they need to get into the ring with Floyd and let him knock some sense into their heads
Sounds more like a libertarian than a republican, shit was still deep though.
1:12 he wasn't running for the presidency at that time you fucking idiot...... Don't try to undermine what Mayweather is trying to say you silly fuck.
and THAT is why Floyd is TBE!   You don't make it to the top thinking and doing what everyone else is doing.   #50-0
If you think Donald trump and mayweather are friends you're an idiot. It's a business relationship just a photo opp you never heard mayweather come out and say he supports his policies.
It's sad that whenever someone successful tells people to work hard to get where you want people boil it down to, well you're blessed/lucky. This dude runs 15 miles at 4am when everyone else is still sleeping and you're going to say he's blessed?
The only haters are the losers looking for a handout. I'm a huge boxing fan but not a Mayweather fan. But I agreed with what Mayweather said. Trump wasn't being called a racist when he was pictured with Rosa Parks and Muhammad Ali. They call Trump a Nazi but do the dumb asses even know Trump's daughter is a Jewish woman and married to a Jewish man with a baby in the picture. The far-left dems are some sorry ass losers.
People think they want the real...but they really don't. They get their feelings hurt
Yea Floyd.  That stupid bitch at the end tried to play down that he earned the things he has. If you have something she thinks it's privilege. Shut up bitch.  The looks on their faces.  They almost got red pilled.  But slipped right back into their stupidity
Funny how home boy tries to ask Floyd about Trumps policies then states some false info. Lol, these uninformed people are something else!!
The host is so dumb new legislation to get rid of the dreamers.\n\nThat's the opposite of what's happening lol, Trump is giving Congress 6 months and the opportunity to *save* the dreamers. They'll most likely stay, and it'll be codified into law, an IMPROVEMENT over what Obama gave them.\n\nDreamers will be thanking Donald Trump.\n\nYes DACA will end but it was never constitutional anyway.
holy fuck i used to hate this guy now hes awesome
Dumb fucking people worried about who the fucking president is
Thanks God, finally a smart celebrity. God bless May weather.
Mayweather is real and he has courage
Wtf I like this guy now
love him!!!  ppl don't like the truth
He is the real Dreamer.
Does anyone have the few minutes after this? I can't find it on their channel just part 1
Funny to see all these trump supporters on here giving big ups to Floyd cause it sounds like he defending your guy Trump but if obama was in office for all of you who complained about him he saying the same about you as well
This the realest nigga I ever heard in my whole life.   Why the fuck black people worried about dreamers?   What the fuck is that gon do for you?   The Democrat Party has turned us all into bitch niggaz and we can't even see it.  Trump may be racist, but if he is he is a lot less racist than Killary and yall know this!   Floyd is on that man shit and the rest of us need to grow the fuck up.
Yeah floyd was really poor back then and instead of wasting his time to nonsense he works hard to be a billionaire and what I witnessed to some blacks  they are still keep playing the victim and complain and demand something from white people. How about u ppl work than depend on others.. I mean we all have problems you know..
Before the McGregor fight, I always thought of Mayweather as a showboat. After he beat down McGregor, my view of him changed slightly in a positive way. Now after watching this video, I have a lot of respect for him. You can see those brainwashed on the plantation pepole in that room starting to get triggered but were at a loss for words. They couldn't believe a black man was speaking of Trump in a positive view. As a Hispanic I can totally confirm what he is saying about these immigrants who are ungrateful hate this country and but won't go back to their home country even though they are always talking about how great it is there. They way I look at is, if the dreamers want to stay, they should take a course on the US constitution, pay a fee and then have to do 4 years of military service. Not all of these dreamers are kids anyway. A lot are late teens, 20's and 30's.\n\nThey system is afraid of the minority groups getting woke to the the real manipulation. They would rather have you believing in their version of being woke: Divide and conquer, race and ethnic politics, etc.
So,  with this dumb Coon's logic,  he should be tripping over $35,000,000 in taxes when he's making over $350,000,000 a year,  thats merely a scratch in the bank.  No shit the average person making $30,000 would be trippin over paying $5,000 in taxes,  Poorer still gets poorer.
he talks like he is retarded, but that mofo made all the sense in the world. Stop bitching and moaning about how u are unfortunate and do something about your life. USA is an amazing country with insane amount of opportunities for one and all to flourish. If u fuck up, its probably ur fault.
The host is full of shit.
Trump wasn't a racist until he ran for president Thank you Floyd for calling out all the idiots.
oh you blessed... pssst... he shut that bitch up quick though...  I WORKED my ass off... didn't no body give me nothin... whole time they want people beggin for crumbs and blamin 'whitey' for oppressing em into failure... Mayweather's life and verdal testimony kills every argument they create...
Most of the most hysterical protesters k ow nothing of his policies. Ppl hate Trump bc they hate HIM. It isn't his policies. The host if full of sh*t. Mayweather is speaking the truth.
The race hustlers in the room don't care that he's telling them that they have to do it themselves, they have to personally make their lives happen, they're selling the hustle....cause it's easy work selling the politics of envy and promises of government largesse. \n\nThe cavalry isn't coming. Save yourself or it will not happen.
Mayweather a real dude. Like this dude even more now
Looks like another knockout to me
The only time I agree with mayweather on anything
Floyd needs to check his white privilege!!!!......oh wait?
Moral of the story: stop worrying about everyone else and do for self. Like he said and for 99% of us, ain't nobody gonna give us shit.
No white pepole there where's the white brother ????
Trump didn't say he actually he grabbed a woman by her you-know-what. He said THEY'LL LET YOU GRAB THEM BY THEIR P__Y because you have a lot of money and that's what some women do when they're in the presence of famous.
AMERICA BECOMES A MESS AFTER A TERM FROM ANY DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT! NEVER EVER VOTE A DEMOCRAT ❗️
LOL at all of them not saying shit against him because they'll be thrown off the money train they freeload on. They didn't expect that response, did they? Anyone else would be called a racist KKK member.
These people are lost and they need to listen to Floyd. He's telling them to stop feeling sorry for yourselves. Stop trying to blame everyone else for your problems. Get up off of your a$$ and do something with your life instead of spending your life assigning blame and complaining. Floyd is a winner in life
You can't become one of the richest athletes in the world if your stupid. Floyd is extremely smart, and he's dropping some real wisdom right here.
Fair play to Floyd
Real talk!
I never knew mayweather was awoken
Truth
WAF
Awesome!
FUCKING BBAAAYYYYYSSED
Woke AF
Mayweather is speaking truth.
GOAT
Smart man right there
real talk
*BLACK CELEBS THAT SUPPORTED TRUMP!*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by-ler2Ly44
I am a white supremacist, and I'm a pussy grabber, and I lubed up America's asshole and lit Putin's cigarette when he finished fucking the election - so what?  I'm not losing any supporters.  \nSo suck my baby carrot, America.  I moved on you like a bitch.
A rational man and a REAL American. Only weak bitches get caught up in everybody elses fights. Fight your own fights and stop being offended for other people. You didn't put dreamers in this situation. Their parents did. Obama only made it worse. Time to correct the problem one way or another and throwing rocks ain't gonna help.
Now all the black people that was PRO Mayweather will turn on him. His boxing style sucks to watch but he's 100% right with Trump.  All the people are shocked like they were talking to a murderer.....
I don't like the man as a person at all, but he isn't wrong about anything he said in this interview.
Mayweather just earned my respect. \nStrange timeline indeed!
People love to hate Floyd, but he is a smart guy.  Respect.
Tell it floyd!!!
Mayweather fucking nailed this. Thats a real OG.
Floyd Mayweather isn't dumb as most people portray him. They will give a forner a loan before a black person. Very true.
Mayweather is Conservative even though he is black. lol. He talked about how IRS should use his tax $ for disasters (So why he has to donate?) & now he says Trump talks like a real man.
I agree 100% with the money man.
Fuking host talking shit he don't even do his research on, just more talking points pushing false narrative. Trump put DACA back on the table for it to be negotiated and law like shits supposed to be, not dictated like B.O. Overreach
Well put Floyd! You sir are a great American.
I totally agree with Floyd.  100%
A positive message from Floyd. That took some balls. New respect for him.
Not a fan of Mayweather as a boxer, but I give him much respect for speaking out on this.
Floyd is the American dream, he came from nothing to become the greatest, respect
Real talk, if you can't handle the truth that's your problem...everything he said is true.
As a fighter, I hate the guy. But this talk here, now that is truth and Mayweather has just got my respect! You want success, get off your ass and work for it!! Money truth!!
Two over the top successful black men, Charles Barkley and Floyd Mayweather, are saying the same thing...listen up!  Concentrate on what you can control...your life, your achievement.   If everyone did that including the illegals, problems would take care of themselves.  It's NOT the GOVERNMENT that determines your success.  It's YOU!  If you didn't vote, you shouldn't complain.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M9vnv5qIFQ
Fuck trump worst President ever agree
$60 for 2 like eyeshadows is ridiculous. Like it could have gold on it and I would still pass
Another overpriced makeup launch. Makeup is marked up 500 times
I love Tati but sometimes she focuses too much on the packaging when, in reality the packaging (beyond a pump for foundations and primers) has almost nothing to do with why someone should buy a product, ever!
Tati!!! Your eye makeup is 🔥🔥🔥
tati, that eyelook!!!! 😍
Crazy expensive
💜Your Look is Perfect 💜😽😺
so cute when you pouted about not meeting victoria beckham hahaha
Here in Australia if you buy a chanel le 4 ombre eyeshadow pallette it is $100 or a Tom Ford eyeshadow quad is $135 so the eyeshadow quad is a comparable price to other luxury makeup brands however I think the illuminating primer cream thing is a bit too much! The packaging looks gorgeous! Thanks for another great review Tati 💕💕💕💕
Your eye makeup is GORGEOUS!!!
Clickbait! Lol Tati
Ur skin looks photoshopped!!!
I loved this!
your makup looks great
your makeup look is absolutely gorgeous <3 <3 <3
For this eyeshadows' price,go for Natasha Denona
Your eyes! 😍
The only item that I might splurge my hard-earned money on is the glitter you placed on your lids. Otherwise, I'm sure I could find a dupe for all the rest.
🙄🤑🤑🤑 i'll pass
That white shirt suits u tati
Anyone else just stare at her engagement ring every time she does a closeup??  <3 So gorgeous!
Reindeer nose contour
Loving the eyelook!!!❤️❤️
@Tati pls pls:  Kate Von D SAINT + SINNER palettes review !
Nope... all kinds of nope!
thumbs up girl!
Love your eye makeup! Slayyyyy
Tati is queen
definate tutorial on todays eye look please
Gorgeous compacts! But are they refillable?
$45 for a single eyeshadow are you freaking kidding me that's insane
I'm from Australia so I understand expensive makeup. A Natasha denona eye pallette can set you back over $300 but these price tags are next level!!! $60 for that shadow duo. What was she thinking! But Tati I still love these reviews! I always want to see how to expensive makeup works out. If you can afford it and you love it, you do you girl! \nWould love for you to reply. Love and positive energy from Australia!! ❤️
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you channel, your honesty, your high-to-low thinking in products <3 so happy to have your advise in my life (and youtube feed)! Go Tati!
it's funny how in the comments people be like 'it's too expensive!!!' but where i live makeup is quite expensive (that's why i don't wear makeup lol) these items will be much expensive in my country.
I feel like rare smells like vanilla flowers all the time
$60 for an eyeshadow duo. What the deuce??!
I am getting one of the eyshadow duos but im confused is the formula at least good?
the annabelle silver cream shadow looks exactly like that stuff
You look as luxurious as that packaging 😚
Wonderful review. Starting g following you today. Thanks!
$95 dollars for FOUR SHADOWS! I'D RATHER BUY A NATASHA DENONA PALETTE THEN
I feel like Tati has gone down the expensive make up route which in honesty I'm happy for her because you know she's making that $$$ but at the same time sad because she would be my go to person for drugstore make-up. Now I can't really relate to the videos or watch the much because it's just high end after high end or make up you buy online. :/
Tati could you do a tutorial on your look today. Your eyes look gorgeous!!!!!!
Real talk though: how does that primer compare to the loreal lumi one?
tati can you review Paul & Joe cosmetics ??
Seems awfully expensive. You could get a pretty good, large palette for the same money elsewhere......
I'd pay $60-$95+ on shoes, handbags, clothes, jewelry &  occassionally a skin cream, but I wouldn't pay $60 on a 2 color pan or $95 on a 4 color pan shadow.  Yes, I might splurge one day and buy some expensive makeup, but it would be a rare occurrrence.
So gorgeoud Tati. I can watch your videos all day 😍
wow!!! That's all I got!
I do love that blue! I really wanted to recreate your eye look! Super cute and simple but it's gorgeous!!! Omg!!! You remind me so much of Victoria Beckham! You are defs posh spice! 💕💕💕
$60 for 2 shadows????? Insane to the max✖️
Tati, can you help me witj a products that wont wont cloge my pores  love you
GIRL 30 bucks for 1 eyeshadow ?? and People are shitting themselves over an $8 natasha denona shadow lol
I wish the review of Fenty Beauty would have been like this.  😬\n(Sorry about my english)
i just subscribed to your channel, your thumbnails dont do any justice to how beautiful you are! i always saw you on my recommendations, and never realized how sophisticated and gorgeous you are, until i pressed the play buttom😅😍! 🇭🇳
Wouldn't spend a dime on this line. I guess every Tom, Dick and Harry puts out a makeup line.
Obsessed with your eye make up!!!
Will this be at sephora? or only department stores?
How about a full face using only Clinique makeup and face lotions/toners/primers??!! Please!!!
You can slay any makeup thrown at you!! I'd never spend that much on two eye-shadows when I can get an entire pallet of high quality shadows that are full pallets for that. If I'm going to, well if I could, splurge, I'd just get the new Natasha Denona pallet that I want so badly.
When does this come out in U.S. stores??
those prices are a complete and utter joke. you can get dupes that are just as good and are way more worth it
*THAT GLOSS LOOKS JUST LIKE GLOSS BOMB FROM FENTY!AND THE FENTY ONE SMELLS LIKE VANILLA AND PEACHES RIHANNA SAYS!!!*
I was going to completely pass on this collection, but after watching this video I just placed an order for the eye foil.  Looks stunning Tati!!
This eye make up, makes your eyes look really small.. not a good one.
Omg Estée Lauder has lost there minds I brought a ND LILA palette for the first time and wow I thought that 129 was a bit much for 15 shadows and They have 2 tiny for 60 and 4 tiny for 95 and a primer for 95 totally ridiculous all makeup companies better be taking notes fro RIHANNA & that is what's up she just set a whole new expectation for makeup
:: i especially love your eye look today 💪🏼💫::
For 95 dollars you could save  more money and buy Natasha Denona, better quality, mucho more product...
Tati - Help! I love the idea of the eye foil but I'm having trouble with the application. Any tips?
Girl, your eye game is SO strong lately!!!!!\nI'm a college student doing lots of lab work, so I rarely bother with makeup right now except for special occasions, but you're making me want to go full glam on the daily!!!! (If only I was good with eyeshadow.....)
You are the best reviewer on Youtube. Hands down. I don’t know what I would do without your videos!!!
Where is that giant crease brush from?
You really didn't say that many negatives. It's not your fault it's SO DAMN EXPENSIVE. They had it coming haha
I love love love your makeup look, I honestly don't think anyone can fault you for your opinion even Victoria herself because they made that line with a certain price tag that's just not meant for everybody, if she wanted everyone to get their hands on her products she would've made a drugstore line, but she made a luxurious line with great quality and a hefty price.
You've made me OBSESSED with the blue lower lash line! I do it ALL the time now <3
Love your earrings! Can you tell us where you got them?
I just love how honest u are ur great
Seriously $60 for 2 eyeshadows? I think Natasha Denona's would seem like a drugstore brand in comparison!😆
Finally something different. Different product. I haven't seen anyone trying this out.
Packaging is so gorgeous...but too expensive for my budget.
I went broke watching this video. LOL. love you Tati. great review as always. 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Omg yes crazy for 95 bucks but that blue looks amazing on your eyes!
Hi Tati! Love this eye look! Any dupes you could think of for the Eye Foil?? Or similar glitters? xx Thank you <3
4 eyeshadows for 95$ man that better change my eye color, see thru the dark, see when someone is a fakeas$ and see the future
but taro YOU'RE MY FASHION icon
Hi Tati - could you review loose powder foundations from the drug store? I want to try bare minerals but its hard on the budget :)
No, no, and no! \nI WOULD NOT spend $45 for ONE eyeshadow, I would  NOT pay $60 for TWO eye shadows, and I sure as hell would NOT pay $95 for FOUR eye shadows!! 😮\nThere was nothing spectacular about those shadows to justify those prices! In fact, IMO there is NOTHING in this whole line that anyone could possibly justify spending this kind of money for! I think of that eyeshadow quad being $95, and all I can think is the number of beautiful, high quality palettes I could choose from at Sephora...AND I could buy TWO palettes and possibly STILL come in UNDER $95!!! 🤔\nAt these prices I wouldn't be interested even if Victoria AND David personally HAND DELIVERED them to my damn door!! Hahaha
The highlighter is just a re release of Modern Mercury. Thank you for the video!
Makeup is so stupid now. And pretentious. These companies can go F themselves
I just couldn't stop looking at her eye makeup! So pretty!
tati your makeup today is killing me its so beautiful omg!!!!!!!
Tati!!! Please WTF Beauty Pie makeup and skincare! I totally value your opinions and would love to see if you think it's a good deal.
Your eye look is so pretty. I am going to get that eye foil. I hope VB meets YOU someday.😀
The packaging yes it's beautiful. But the price is.... bleh. Tati your eyes is so intense today, I love your blush or anything you put on your cheek. So beautiful.
Your skin looks perfect! What Is making your skin so dewy?
what make up did you use for the first part of your video? Your skin looks incredible.
OH NOOOOOOOO I just ordered the Smudgy Eyeliner, I wish I'd seen your review first. Was it possibly just dried out and flaky? The concept is good, maybe I'll like it 😉
Eye makeup looks amazing today!! Also, her skin legit looks airbrushed today??
There are two shades of the bronzer when I look online. Which shade are you talking about here Tati? We have similar coloring so I want to get what you have :)
You look absolutely stunning tati
gurrrrrlll!! you're trending what what
Hahaha that backpack is hilarious!!! Your description reminded me of the time my husband bought a backpack for a trip  online.... He bought it thinking it was gonna have enough space (for the Amazon's) for clothes, food & stuff like that.... When the backpack got here it was SO small, the material was really cheap, & to top it off it had a jalapeno inside.... A JALAPENO!!! how? Why? It was weird, but hilarious!!! He looked like the hear from open season..... He DIDN'T RETURN IT he took the backpack to the trip... But I saw you with the backpack & couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂 please return it, don't turn into my husband & keep something useless.... Fyi he still uses the backpack for work 🤔🤔
Please do wish next!!
OMG a 3 legged doggy!! how precious!!!
I would love to see you try things from Wish. Please.
No one wants to sleep on these stiff sheets THAT comment at the end had me laughing so hard that my kids woke up! 😂\nBut seriously, that dress would make such a cute Shirley Temple Halloween costume. All you need is the cutesy pin curls. 😁
In my opinion, the fit of everything except the blue collared shirt was off! You get what you pay for and it's too hit and miss for my time and money.
Try Popoly next!!
You say you were a mess...well girl I want to be a mess it looks as beautiful as you do. Loved this video. But then I love all your Videos
try Dresslily!
We all have bad days but u look good
Help me!! 😂
Girl!! You are making me nervous!! I just ordered this dupe of a ZARA dress. \nhttp://us.shein.com/Shirred-Waist-Dress-With-Liner-Slip-Dress-p-382633-cat-1727.html\nThis is only my second order from there. My first was only a bikini and it wasn't bad.
5:30 just sew it
She reminds me of grav3yard girl tbh😂😂😂
Rainbow Brite represent!
Where do you get your hair done???? I love it!
I'd be too worried that my card would be hacked on a site like that
Sad the out of your comfort zone dress had a hole in it! It looked so good!! Also, pirate pants!!! Yay!
I wanted to order from here. But wasn't sure. Great review. Sorry can't be a lady. Lol
Your video is Trending!!!
Я один русский?
Do Wish next!
Congrats your trending !! :)
that's cancelled hahaha :-)
Video starts @ 2:43
U look like Meghan reiks
Why is this trending
yaasss trending on youtube
Kys thot
Can I please have you as my best friend? 😅  I love your videos ❤️
Seriously I was dying when you said stuff sheets and that dress didn't move! Bahahahahahahha
For these exact reasons, this is why I just don't order online. Between my chicken legs and lanky arms and the extremely long waits for disappointment, it's just not worth the hassle. Thank you for confirming my thought process! 💋
I ordered from the Shein site and there were a handful of items worth keeping, but I was not in love with any of them.  The sizing is too inconsistent and it is hard to tell if the item is made with quality material.  Considering the money I spent, and the fact that I only liked a small amount of the clothing, I decided it was not worth it and I won't be ordering anything from them.  I would rather go to the store, try things on and keep what I love.   With the Shein items, there was not anything I really loved and I felt like I just kept what was ok.
The fabric of the white dress is called tweed... or at least they were going for tweed-esque
I love your personality so much, you crack me up and give me good vibes 😊
I haven't laughed this hard in so long. You are hilarious! I could agree with everything you were saying too, I kept talking back to you 😂😂😂 love your videos always 💕
I think they gingham dress looks good! Also, when you have to report comments because random people are hating #thatshowloveworks
I would recommend trying TOBY. My best friends love it, but I've only tried their formal wear. I'm mean 50% off (for your first purchase) a hot dress for New Years?? Yes pls
That's what happens when leather is bad
White tights under the white striped pants?  And it might help with the credit card issue haha
How can you return the Shein stuff really really quick if it's taken three and one half weeks to get to your house and you were then gone for two weeks?
Thank you for this!!
I love these videos because you're seriously providing a service🙌🏽 Also you're adorable and I love you but that Chanel dress gives me serious LambChop vibes 🤣 idk why!? #WhyAmILikeThis  great review! 💖
You should consider getting a belly piercing
Haha one size fits all is not a thing ok... Go to Asia everything is mostly one size fits all especially South Korea. Which sucks if you are size above US M
You are never a medium! Seriously there is nothing medium about you!! You are one of the thinnest girls I've seen! Very tall- yes.. but not a medium!
... You really expected high quality fabrics and pieces from a cheap site? (For example, the black and white checkered looking dress. Girl it was $14, stop trying to act like it should've been such high quality.)
Leighann, sugar, ya live in Houston.  Summer lasts till well into October, seriously!  (I get it, I do, I'm in Houston, too.)
Omg she is sooo fussy all the clothes look fine!!!
Girl you're on the Trending page - you go!!!!  Now more can see how amazing you are. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
leighann you need to check out the website shopcamp, its all your retro tshirt dreams come true ✨
I ordered a shirt from them over 5 weeks ago and shipping says its sitting in China. they gave me a $2 credit for how long its taking. So glad I only spent $9.
maybe the last dress could be made into a long shirt?
Keep the bigger items and wash them.  They might shrink 😊
Yeah that sweater would fit me like a bra lol looks really cute on you
I really like these kind of videos. That blue dress, the stiff sheet one, it was so stiff you could even hear how stiff it was, it was so noisy lol!
1. reorder the white dress 2. wear the pants with nude underwear and you won't notice 3. wear a belt with the shorts
Brandy Melville is a one-size fits all brand.
There is a site where everything is 5.99..you should try that..I found some good stuff
you are very cute.
I gotta get a card with a alias.. Can't trust the internet..
I can''t stand the one size fits all concept. Its incredibly misleading and its encouraging to see influencers who also don't see the point of it!
I'm out here thinking it's that lady from Scubs
Love these haul/testing videos!! <33 It would mean so much to me if you watched one of my videos!
You have such a calming presence. Can you just hug me all day?
Yay!!!!  Leighann trending!!  Y'all need in on this!!  Subscribe!!
I love the smell of paint, maybe not toxic but yeah
Am I the only one who gets irked by her complaints when she looks perfect and super fit in every single thing? Like I get it, I don't like alot of clothes either but that's because I'm pudgy and muffin tops happen no matter what
Inu inu is a scam lol the material is so low quality
You should do Cupshe. I see a lot of cute stuff on there but am too scared and picky to try it. I loved the rainbow dress on you! Too bad it was see through.
leighann you *are* a lady <3
Before I buy anything online I check if you did a Try-On.\nLove Your Videos!!
Her looking like a mess is better than myself after getting ready for two hours lmao
Wtf do u buy gucci? That stuff is good.
Any other small YouTube channels out there?
Those pjs look so cute! I want them ❤️
You should really keep the orange striped one it looked really pretty on you
p.s. I don't know what the sites are off the top of my head, but i know there are a lot of scammy style bridesmaids dress sites. It might be cool to do a bridal themed style of this video
I love your hair!
All I can say is gawd that bawd!
More try on hauls from scammy sites please!
I've been successful with some bathing suit purchases from Shein. Their high waisted bikinis are so cute.
never be guilty about gingham
Your dog.... melts... my heart 8:48
I remember Rainbow Brite! She was totally WAAAAAY before my time.
Please do missguided!!! They have such cute stuff but I'm so scared to buy from them bc I've heard not so great things :/ also I love these types of videos! 💖
I would love to see you do a Wish haul but instead of clothing you could do beauty/makeup products and tools!
Luckily for you anytime you're visiting LA you can bring your summer clothes because we only get fall until about 10am and then it's back to being sunny
If you wear an olive colored oversize cardigan with that blue and white button down shirt you love, it would totally pass for fall!
I love that you test these websites out for us!! 👐 i love your sense of humor!! you are so funny 😂
Please try Zaful next! It's a similar website but delivery takes about 1.5 to 2 weeks so not as bad!
LOL I'm a kindergarten teacher 😂😂
I assumed your top was just following the pajama-inspired trend, didn't realize it was actual pajamas! So cute 💕
I love how you have a is this a scam? hairdo, lol.
I stay away from those sites. The best quality clothing site imo is ASOS.
Hi Leighann, I live in Maine so cozy sweaters are high on my list this time of year. Lightinthebox.com looks like they have what I have been looking for, but it seems scammy. Want to check it out?  😁
Wow you look like that nun from American horror story (also Shein is a bad website I order clothes and they came 2 months later and they didn't even fit. I'm a small person but jeez it's not good)
You'r so negative omg - I got a lot of stuff from shein and I love them all
you look like my g ma

Terrorist attack? Time for the left to blame trump for ALL of his tweets.
so many alleged terrorist attacks and none is solved. That shows how fragile The U.K. is. This looks like fire drill emergency response exercise.
Wow George got there fast
I'm all for a safe homeland, but what a crock of shit from the parliament/media. This is probably one of the laziest attempts I've ever seen. That being said I'm glad everyone is okay.
No life threatening injuries just like your natural disasters blueye british pigs. Is it the snap crackle pop navy or is it in concert with the USA military?
Kick them all out!!!! How many more?!
I am hoping that the world will come to realize that Islam is not a religion but a Demonic Cult of War, Conquest and Deceit. Islam and Muslims need to be kicked out of Europe AGAIN.
Let me help you guys solving this case. Whoever did this was not a Boy Scout, nor a Japanese tourist, nor a Buddhist monk, nor a polish immigrant, nor a born again Christian, nor a vegetarian... I hope I have helped some.
Why are these attacks happening? The UK did not abduct Muslims into the UK, as Americans did to Africans. Muslims themselves wanted to live in the UK, probably because they thought the UK was a better place to live than their Muslim country, and the UK welcomed them and provided them place to live.\n\nShouldn't the UK be their second motherland, if not the first? Why attack the nation that helped them? If they want the UK to become more like their original Muslim country, why not go back there? Then, they can have the strict Muslim way of living without terrorism.
need more migrants to England. this is god's way of punishing England for the many sins of the Beattles !   gods wrath us upon England for the Beattles satanic music clearly heard , satan is god  when played backwards at 45 rpm !!!!
These goat fuckers can't even create a proper bomb 😂
I live in the uk and its so sad how people find out the news and just say aw its just another terror attack like its normal
Calling any Muslim Muslim is too flattering for that word means to submit to God. That's an insult to God himself. I prefer to call them Mohammedan.
the bomb might just be a lure.. and the person who made the bomb built it to not fully explode,to fail.
It was the British government that supported the terrorists in Syria ... This is the result of their support😡😡😡😡
Lol police won't investigate anything, because this whole hoax was staged with their complacency.
It's a gallon bucket and a tiny fire, fucking incompetent terrorist but how were people even injured? Either way the device seems more or less intact so good for forensics.
Kick all the brown people out of Britain. Or kill them.
Europe & UK government just don't understand this is just the beginning so why don't y'all bring in more unvetted immigrants !!!
i can't believe josh johnson bombed the subway!
Just shows the stupidity of modern day humans. Yeah lets go up and stare through the window at the flaming improvised explosive.
Ohhh, that woman's legs are burned so badly 😣. She must be in so much pain, her skin is just peeling off completely 😟. I hope that she and all others injured are able to recover okay.
Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslim.
Women need to be taken out of politics
God, how terrible, when will this insanity end??\nIt would seem that no one is safe, anywhere. No words. Thank God no lives were lost...
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Part & parcel, y'all. Just part & parcel
Okay abc news since cnn is not reporting YOU'RE taking the hit. Now US military blow up civilians overseas but is not reported. There are numerous REAL terrorist attacks that go unreported. Sheeple claim they need evidence to prove that these are psyops but I need evidence to prove that it was real other than reporters saying so fake witnesses and police and emts everywhere. Now you can fool millions but I know that this is another psyop to invoke fear and control. I don't care about responses because this message is for abc.
dumb trump didn't tweet about the white kid with the gun who attacked his school and shot 6 people he didn't call him a terrorist
haters of Islam always remember : your peace is inside your grave.
Trump saying loser makes me think of a 10 year old kid...
I'm seeing a lot of hate towards the hateful. Stay safe London. Love, Johnny.
I'm honestly starting to think this was just a bunch of kids lighting shit on fire on the train.
I don't think the main objective of the  bomb was to hurt people if they wanted to they could have done it way better
This is some Blacklist type shit
Why is it happening to us Brits?  What did the world do to make it un safe for innocent people to get to work/other places and get attacked?
Fuvking Pakistani fucks wreaking havoc against fucking civilians again
Officials will wring their hands and write a sternly worded email  to ISIS.  Instead they should pull the hate spewing imams out of the mosques by their scraggly beards and deport!!!
How do we know they are Muslim?
Where was David Duke? \n\n🤔
They will magically find a passport or know where he is hiding
This alleged terror attack is a FAKE STAGED HOAX DRILL committed by the Government & reported by the corrupt complicit mainstream media as a real event. Crisis actors used as victims & eye witnesses. ALL terror attacks in UK have been staged by the UK Government, used to implement new laws to remove your freedom & privacy, to instill fear, divide people & now they're going after free speech via censorship of the internet. Government trying to shut up anyone that goes against their bullshit lies & actions. The Government are the terrorist using psychological terrorism against it's own people.
GAS CHAMBERS TO ALL MUSLIMS!
Wow in Islamic State of London? It's not Great Britain no more. Well it's ur government that allowed this.  Attacks will be imminent. Idiots.
A BUCKET BOMB? WTF!
Hope they are alright..
Glad no one lost lifes
Did isis  did this
nh
lol
Fear-mongering and it's part of living in a big city. Can you guest the idiots whom said this?\nHint: Ones a over used tea bag
*Look out dudes! Religion of blast you to pieces.....i mean, very very peaceful, coming through!*
What's to investigate? It's the damn muslims once again. The Religion of pieces.
All in the name of acceptance and equality
According to liberals: There are no terrorist...
Sadik Kahn orders you to get used to it!\nYou deserve such a mayor!
Damn London is way to dangerous
Ohh islam...again
Another terrorist attack the world is going to forget within 48h. A world ran by retards.
You know the smell of burning *FLESH*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe police are coming so I have to go now 3:42
Radical islamic terrorism a culture in UK
According to Sadiq Khan, Muslim mayor of London, this is just everyday life in a big city. True. A big city in some Islamic shithole country teeming with subhuman, stinking, violent Muslims. I remember a family vacation to London in the early 1970s. Then it was actually full of courteous, civilized white Britons. I was there a second time again early this summer, and large parts of it are so rancid and violent with Muslims those areas should be leveled, the Muslims repatriated to whatever Islamic death cult cesspool they crawled out of, and the areas vacated populated by white Britons once again.
EVERY sharia-law-lover is a soon to be terrorist. KILL them all.
In my opinion every available resource on earth should be used to exterminate all radical Muslim terrorists.
Fucking greenscreen on george. Hes not in london...
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE.
Death to Chocolate Pudding faced people !
this is what happens when you disarm your citizens they dont pull these pussy attacks in the states every other week
Why was George Stephanopoulos in london?
Here we go again.
so.....how is that open door policy for Muslims working out...?
Colonial rule.
Magic video!
Forget about banning the burqa. Ban Islam.
I just can *not* wait to dive in to all the delightful comments! Yay, I get to learn 42 new cuss words! Oh! Is that hate on Muslims? Terrific!
Islam is to blame. If you're a Muslim and you can't recognize how false and violent your religion is, I don't want you in my country! Get out right now. We are going to start making it uncomfortable for you otherwise.
Another day in Londondistan
Damn Buddhists - again!

Damn white Christians
Hahaha everyone talk about Muslims 😂😂😂 lool
The Muslim phobic comments are awful. How do you even know who did this? Even if it was a Muslim the majority are not like you think
The Mighty Lion of Juda...Will Eradicate Islam Forever

If there was an explosion then how was the bag and bucket it was in almost fully intact and barely on fire? And why was George Stephanopoulos in London? Was he there to cover another story or did he just happen to be there today? Hmm...
All this crap since we were dragged into a phoney war with Iraq based on Lies lies and more lies.

If you don't address that attacks like this are created by the whites behind the curtain, you will never ever be able to solve the issue. Addressing the root cause is the key.
This comment is a controversial opinion and will start a reply war.
White people are the real terrorists

Fantastic episode. Dillon Francis' charisma is insane and Sean was on fire
Dillan gained a fan tonight. Not because of the wings. But because I just don't follow his genre. I have since, and am, as I said a fan. Good on both you and Sean.
Damn, I didn't know Paris Hilton was a DJ now(or maybe she has been for a while?).  Good to see her doing something other than selfies for once.  \n\nThe things you learn on Hot Ones.
Can you guys have haha Davis?
people who do cross fit never shut the fuck up about cross fit.. fuck I love you
Gotta get charlie sheen on this !! Love your show though Sean !
ive actually been drinking milk and chicken since a baby
Get a WWE star
If you can get Bo Burnham that would be the most real interview of all time.
Ok we get it, just date already
Do one with someone in faze clan
do u go for the- *wing already in mouth* nevermind..
Chappers and The Captain from andertons TV are really wanting to eat some stupidly hot wings, they're brilliant lads and absolutely hilarious too, give 'em a shout guys!
Anyone know how they prepare the wings? Fried, baked, grilled?
Dillion is so cool. This episode has to be my favorite!! You guys vibe'd so good
Chappers and the captain want to do this!!!\nMake it happen!
https://youtu.be/yB8Ci7X5HUU this is the vid he references

Please have Chapers and The Captain on the show \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi4GMme6LWk got at 15:38 to see what i'm talking about :) i'd love to see em on the show
Not big in the EDM scene but this guy would be my pick for son-in-law.

Dude c'mon. I put Da Bomb on my eggs.
Remember when people wouldn't be able to finish the wings and almost die ... Pepperidge Farm remembers...

Hi, please can Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton be interviewed on Hot Ones? They'd really appreciate it :)
Get Adam 22 on here
Those wings need to be cooked more!
Brian Regan would also be very funny on the show
Well, this guest was boring.
With the Emmys just passed, made me think, what makes something eligible for an Emmy? Can Hot Ones win an Emmy?
Dillon Francis, redist ears in the game
You guys should get Marshawn Lynch on here
Boys noize would be fun to see
it'd be great if u had better guest tbh
I miss the old Sean Evans
i got two of those secret aardvark in my fridge its soooo goood
I was trying to watch this eating a Carolina reaper
The song he mentioned and the video sucks so hard.
keep getting big EDM acts.. see if you can get Tiesto, or Armin Van Buuren
Please have Ski Mask the Slump God or Khalid! :)
You should get Steve Aoki on the show!!
Sorry jauz but your a little bitch sometimes 😂😂 @jauz
Chappers and The Captain from #AndertonsMusicCo want to come on the show. Please get them on! :D\n#RobChapman
Or Kevin heart , or Chris Tucker
Watching a guy rise to greatness is an amazing journey. Good Fucking Job Sean!
Dillon Francis seems like the best kind of person to interview :)
Who else eats wings or wants wings when they watch hot ones?
Does anyone else watch this whenever they buy wings?
This is a really great fucking show man. Keep it up.
Skrillex needs a turn at the board now.
For 20 minute long videos and to not skip parts is awesome. I love this show and i wouldnt and couldnt imagine a better host the Mr Sean right here!
Have Jonathan Davis from Korn on the show
Last Dab has a 2.4 million scoville level
He actually took this really well

They need Joe Rogan and Hannibal Burris on at some point.
It should really go without saying (If it hasn't already been said heaps before) that you need to find a way to get Neil Patrick Harris on this show
Rob Chapman and Lee Anderton said they would love to be on your show!
Waitin for George Fisher, Corey Taylor, Marilyn Manson, or Maynard James Keenan

That black gentleman must be doing well, cause everything he owns is white(smmfh)\n\n\n\nOh and the sax
Awesome song, got some good trap influences and love the sax. Ma$e on the verses was very cool too. Good job!
Wth is wrong with you.. Aoki???? I want the 2015 one.....
some songs of Steve aoki with these rappers is so off point ,vocals don't fit the track at all,instead of hyping you makes u want to sleep
So 7 people produced this one song?\nJesus.
1:27 XDDD
DOPE 👌👌👌
wtf?
This will make a good remix.can't wait..
Lmao when the video started I thought she's a chick, but later it was Steve lol
Mase is a clone.. he look the same as in 90s . Never age. .hm
Amazing song #Greece
Music Very Good!
Who find this song by Jake's Paul video description!?!?
Mase aged well, dude still looks the same from the early 2000's
I like the asian dude he looks so cute
0:23 who is girl xd
His voice not for the beats.
IT'S MA$E BABY!
what is this shit?
Idiot
My new favorite song 👍👌🔥🔥
Terrrrible video.... Hurts to look at
Its like they tried to mix, funk, electronic, and trap. As we can see, it didn't turn out well. I wouldn't want to say stick with what you know, but being too dynamic is just too sudden of a change for your fan base.

Hey Guys my name is Malik Charles...Would really love any support!!! Check Out My Mixtape ASAP!!! Crazy Good Reviews!!! https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Worst ever heard
Will this get famous???
So Saxy! 🎷
All yur album is fckin trash
Mase fused a bday song with that proverbial techno music that lives on in the club or party for years! No ones perfect and I'm not God to judge it's just I wish he would show he's a believer and  not use Hoes Chronic Gin n Tonic Muder etc. in his song, I mean dawg u was a pastor of a congregation for crying out loud.
1 night stand....Fergie  OR  Nicki?!!  XD
I've never seen Nicky Minaj all covered without showing up her ass or boobs.\nThat's impressive.
Nicki is the best part of this tragic song

Absolutley love to turn the volume up full blast to this song ...
Sounds old school. It's really great! Like it! :D
Fergie needs to get back into the rock scene, she suited it so well!

i dont think shes in her tone
OMG YOUR GRACE NICKY! UNBILIEVABLE! LOVE U FROM ITALY
.......I hate it. It's a mess
Audio is more sexier than video
Is no one gonna comment on how this sounds like Swish Swish by Katy Perry ft Nicki Minaj?
I love you 😍 omg Nicki and Fergie my dream.😍😍😍
Everytime Nicki spits I pause and when she's done she leaves me shook and wanting more.. Damn Nicki you good!! midas touch
Pose for the camera daddy I'm voguing.... yes Ferg and Nick.... Just... yes !
Since learning about latex as a fetish it tickles me to see celebs in latex bc they are probably covered in lube
This song deserves more views...
Is it just me who thinks that Nicki should of had a second verse??
OK after hearing this song again I seriously LOVE it!!!!!!!!
Nicki when she said that death row line her eyes was so fearce
I can’t believe people really don’t think nicki verse was good
I only give like because of nicki

Ĩ ĹÕVÊ ŤĤĨŜ ŜÊҲŶ bitch
Missed you Fergie Ferg Great Colab and my new Fave excercise song.
Go Queen!!!!
super good
it's the first time i see nicky cover all her body lol
The visuals are dope...... Fergie didn't need Nicki on this track at least not rapping in the style that she did..... Fergie was dope no feature needed on this
Already 4mil views and its only been out a week! wow
i really dont know how i feel about this song :/
Started out promising Fergie is so talented then that ratchet Nicki showed up and the Fergie became the whore mother once again
I love this song!!!!! Yark this is how we do!!!!
It's getting annoying that Nicki has to brag about how much money she makes in every song she features in. I mean, good for her, but does she have anything else interesting to talk about? lol
Am i the only one who finds this awful? like the whole chorus is off pitch...
Sorry, but Justin Tiberlake's  Like I love you is obvious in this one.
She is so hot lol
Yooo🙇🏾
The classy song from fergie luv.
Much better on 1.25
Welcome back, missed the creative music!! Fuck all the haters!!! Do your thang!!!!
BITCHES is my son's they don't wanna leave the nest tho 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😎😎😎😎
Fergie was not hitting that high note.
I liked her music better when she actually sang it and not rapped it.
This woman hasn't aged a day since The Duchess! I wish that she wasn't so underrated... This song, Life Goes On and so on just flew totally under the radar.
To me this song is so refreshing to hear & u can actually dance to this tune, i absolutely love it ,we need more uplifting fun dance music like this, thank u Fergie u are feirce girl , loves it 😚Xxxx cant waite for the album also👍🏼xxxx oh an fergie looks HOT!!!
Since i came in the game they career on death row! Queeeeeen
Sounds like DJ snake and Aluna George - You know you like it From 2014 🤷🏽‍♂️😒🤦🏽‍♂️ 👎🏽 I like the 90s beat tho
CAMERA AND CUT IS HORRIBLE
Is anybody else getting Meredith Grey vibes with her style??? Idk 🤔
I am here for Nicki Minaj wearing a suit and tie
the 'this is how we do' part makes me bleed
GOD THIS NEEEDS TO GO MEGA VIRAL IS SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! haven't liked a fergie song so much since Big girls don't cry
Fergie like a good wine gotta better with time
This is that shit!!!
Creo que ya no se divierte como antes...
once again All these bitches is my sons .....
The 11k who disliked all are death no affence if you are 😂😂👌

Yaasssss
YASSS NICKI
Fergie is back Aaaaaaaaa!
Thank God for Nicki Minaj in this crap! 👏☺😒

Yaaaasss Fergie Yaaasss Nikki
Bafãooo! Amo. 😚
Divass
Fuck Yesss Nicki❤❤😍
Loved it❤️ she definitely didn't need nikki for this.
She films in black and white because it hides her age better
I'm sorry but 2 thicc divas in the same video I'm dying

I love this!
Those highlighters though! 😍
Ugly girl
you are GLOWING!💫
Looks lovely Fleur
Always reliable reviews! Thanks Fleur! That lip gloss looks amazing.
LOVED the casual setup! :)
Love your videos 😘
love it
You are my favorite You Tuber!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
Love your nail color
£6&10 p&p !!!
Hey Fleur!Lovely video!Since you love a more natural and dewy foundation may I ask if you ever had sn issue with sunglasses?I love the more light and dewy textures but every time I wear my summies  I can see the foundation rubbing off at that spot
Please tell me what you have on your skin?! Like your arms look so tanned and glowy? 🙋🏼👍🏻
Why didn't you d a make up look rather than talking only?
I wasn't to quick to jump the Fenty Beauty hype train either but I did get the foundation and I love it. I have oily skin and I was impressed to see that my makeup stayed on and didn't start to look funky after a few hours. Definitely will be getting a few more products and possibly an extra bottle of the foundation.
Do you not have your apartment in London anymore?
Loved your review, it was so honest which was lovely! The foundation looks like my colour which is nice because I am so pale and there are hardly any options out there so it is good that she is covering all shades :) I am so excited that you are pregnant, I can't wait for baby de force!!!
This is probably the millionth fenty video I'm watching 
You picked the ame shades in the Match Stix and Killawatt  as I did  but I am shade 300-320 lol a TRUE medium-tan gal.
Your skin looks so beautiful and float with this collection!!
You're so pretty!! Love this review and look
Such a shame about the foundation colour. I'm excited to see how the products work on my skin. Thanks for the review! Xx
What's that nail polish? Looks amazing <3
Looks like the perfect foundation shade for me so at least you've helped someone find the right shade even though you've lost money haha! Thankyou! X
I love it that you are so honest but beauty products xx \n theoctoberedit.blogspot.com
My foundation Shade is NW 15 for MAC. What Shade would suit me best? I live nowhere near a Harvey Nicholes :(
Brill video! What nail polish have you got on here Fleur? I love the colour! 💜 xxx
Hi! What nail polish are you wearing? I love it!!!
Love the stripes and dungarees combo ❤
I loved how chill this video was! And your review was soooo helpful - I was also hesitant to spring for another celeb range but now I totally want to try out a few pieces!
HI Fleur you look lovely!  Sprinklyofglitter tagged you in a baby name tag can you do it? Would love to hear your answers xo C
I definitely have my eye on a few of these products after watching this! Loved the set up of this video, Fleur!
I love the highlighter duo too. Not a big fan of cream products, but might give the cream blusher/highlighter and cream contour a go.
Iv been watching your videos for yours and i really love the old way of reviewing you have bought back, its felt more natural and like heres the products lets talk! Really enjoyed this video , hope you do many more like this!
you are literally glowing throughout your pregnancy!! <3
Rihanna did go an awesome job she SLAYED her products
Did you put blotting sheets in the wrong way around??
Love videos like this! Feels so down to earth and you look stunning!
Great review. I really enjoyed your thoughts and the makeup looked beautiful.
LOVE this more casual chatty video!! xx
Love the set up for this video! So 'at home'. Thanks for your review :)
Actual product review begins at 11:07. You're welcome. GEEZ! SMH
The Estée Lauder cushion what shade did you use please...it looked gorgeous -\nAs are you!!\nThanks for this,found it really helpful.
I know the foundation wasn't the right shade for you, but kinda wish you had kept it on! I've heard the sticks don't pair particularly well with the foundation formula and wanted to hear your thoughts on it aside from color match!
You look stunning!!! Natural beauty+pregnancy glow= beyond words beauty! Fleur you look lovely, and by far the best/most honest reviwe I've seen so far! Lots of love! Xx Tatty
Hi Fleur do you think the Fenty primer is better then the Two Faced Hangover one?
I love this sort of video! You're so gorgeous but I must say, I'm still not excited by this brand. It seems expensive but cheap...
I always trust your reviews... I tried the gloss on my hand at Sephora , the smell is amazing! It's so pretty.
This is my favourite video of yours in ages. It was a really professional review, IMO. I really like how you gave candid first impressions of the good and bad of each product, whether or not you ended up liking or disliking them. I feel like it was really honest and helpful! I agree with the others, as well: I'm not sure if you've changed your lighting or hair colour, but you're looking extra stunning in yourself here, too. Keep it up!
Great video! The casual vibe, the fact that you paid for the products, watching you apply it like in the old days, all of it! Loved it!
Honestly i loved this style of video!
I don't know if this is true but I have heard that the foundation oxidises to a few shades darker x
Hey Fleur! There have been too many beauty videos lately... At least for me... How about some bags? Shoes? Thanks!
Really love this review, very genuine.....more less planned videos in the future 👍👌
Your pregnancy really suits you! You're stunning! <3
Great video, I fully expected to hear you hating the products because I tend to associate you with higher end brands and products. I really love that you got excited as a consumer and I agree that your video seems to be the most unbiased so far! Love the laid back feel too! Xx
The blotting paper looks like rizla skins and a rolling machine for joints 😂😂😂😂
1) your excitement is contagious, 2) your make up afterwards looks BEAUT, 3) girl, that t-shirt and dungarees are a LOOK
dont think u knew how to pull the blotting paper out because ive seen others do it just fine ..
Where are your dungarees from? x
Loved this video. Loved how long it was and informal. Just chilling it with a friend style.
you literally have a holiday glow with this ! <3
great review. really thorough and well-explained. your word choice is so specific and accurate. keep it up!
I really liked this old style video with a classic review and try on. Looks great and now I would love to go out and pick up that lipgloss! :)
I realize this video was a little on the spontaneous side; that being said, I REALLY enjoyed it. It felt very authentic and had a nice, relaxing vibe. This video was a great example of how you don't need to go all out to make quality content. If the enthusiasm is there, the rest will follow. \nOn a slightly unrelated note, I don't know what it is about this particular video, but you really looked like Hannah in some parts of it. I've never really thought that before. Obviously, I've noticed the familial similarities, but I've never looked at the both of you together and thought, twin moment. For the record, that was meant to be a compliment. You both are beautiful gals!
Really love this style of video, Fleur! Please do more first impression/live haul type videos. xx
Loved this video Fleur! I find that I prefer videos like this (you called it raw). I like it without a studio or studio lighting etc. It feels more natural and less produced and therefore more real. I hope more youtubers go back to this style of video. I want to feel like a friend is telling me about products, not selling me some on HSN. Great job and you look fab!
Fleur, do you still have the London apartment?
LOVE this style of video! You're glowing and look absolutely stunning!!!
I don't think I'm going to indulge in this line myself, but it does look lovely. And I loved the more relaxed, hands-on review style -- both informative and casual, like a (circumstantially one-sided) conversation with a friend!
Might have to get the lip gloss!!
What's your nail color? It's so pretty!
Love this - you should do more first impression videos!
Totally random, but what colour / brand nail polish are you wearing??? Its gorgeous!! x
please do more first impressions just like this! casual, honest, no big production required, just a good solid chat... loved it!
Your skin looks incredible!! Please please do a cushion foundation best and worst! X
The contour colour looks amazing on you!
I'm glad u gave it a good review! I wasn't hyped about the line either BUT once I found out what was in the range, my interest was peaked! I only purchased the lippie and primer. They were out of my foundation and I can't buy anymore highlighters until I've used up what I have. Seriously, how many do u actually need?!?! Ultimately, I'm pleased to see that u liked it bcuz as a black woman, the range of foundations for us is  UNHEARD OF. We still don't have a STRONG market catering to us and our beauty with ALL its many shades. So, I think THAT is really what the hype was about. Black women/girls felt like, FINALLY, someone thought exclusively about US! It's not so much about Riyanna (did I spell that right?) and if my Caucasian, and Asian sisters don't understand that, then you've missed the whole point. #bravo Fleur!
Loved the style of this vid xx
I feel like you match exactly my colouring! Hope you get to try the foundation in the right shade one day
Loved the style of this video, very natural X x
Tear the blotting paper against the blade from one side to the other instead of ripping it :)
Love this video Fleur! So different for you, in a good way 😊 you also look absolutely beautiful! X
Are you going to get a foundation that matches for a second review?
Oh my goodness I love love loved this video! I enjoyed the more relaxed vibe you had going on and you are looking so beautiful. Love to you, Mike & all your fur children! Xx
I hope your read this, but I'm in love with your tragus piercing. Would you mind sharing where you got it? It's so cute!
Your skin looks amazing 😍 pregnancy is really working for you! Are you going to try another shade of foundation? Would be good to hear your opinion of your shade, also love the casualness to the video xxx
I wish you used the white because I haven't seen a review with it yet
very nice video, good review :)
your skin looks amazing in this Fleur! <3
You should never buy makeup online , you should always try it first on your face (physically go to the shop)  , because when you buy online it always ends up being lighter or darker in real life.
I really appreciate your review and POV!
It wasn't Rihanna fans rushing to the stores to get some, it's the POC finally having their shades.
I wanted to say thank you for doing this!  A lot of vloggers who are not women of color are turning their noses up at this. Thank you for doing this for your colorful audience!
what shade are you in estee lauder double wear cushion?
Turn the blotting tube upside down (tooth side down) then rip. As opposed to ripping up upward. Side note, love your nail color 😍
Which colour you have in the Estee lauder cushion foundation .😄
i've missed the tutorials ! :)
Really REALLY loved this style of video, including the natural looking lighting. It seemed very spare of the moment and I got the feeling you weren't planning on putting the makeup on to start with. Something about it just seems so natural and friendly (not saying you aren't always friendly 😁) keep them coming and I hope you are keeping well xxx
Fleur's reviews are the best reviews 💕

Why is no one talking about the undertones of Nazism in the Emoji Movie?
My only question, what happened to the iPhone 9?
Was that even Parody ? o.0
If Samsung made a new flagship phone with a huge notch like that apple fans would be laughing...
Wow wait one minute, are you saying this phone lets you be a.....emoji. My god we truly are in the future now ladies and gentlemen, all I need now is a emoji MMO and my life will be complete.
Why do people keep saying faceid  on Samsung can be fooled by anyone. I mean if someone is gonna take in the effort to print a picture of me just to unlock my phone u have a serious problem lmao. Plus faceid  concept is crap.  I don't use it on my s8 nor will I use it if I get the X. Pin is still the best way. Or if you have s8 the finger print scanner 😚
I feel like Apple's going to exit the world of making mobile phones because X + 8 = exit!
that last one got me loooool

#nooneisgoingtogethatgame\n\nWhat is the point of displaying a crappy ass game like that, they only went on their for potential downloads that’s not gonna happen

One day Apple will remove the cameras and say , Heyy look!! We totally removed the cameras from the iphone because nobody will need them. Why use a camera when you have your eyes to see things directly.

So Iphone 8 cost 800$.  Iphone 10 cost 1000$. Oh boy i cant wait for Iphone 24.
No headphone port = NO MONEY FOR YOU!
*Lol, when iTards call their jewelry “a milestone”.* Sorry, but Nokia had better smartphones before the shitty iPhone. It had actual features, a camera, 3G, 3D audio APIs, a freaking _file manager,_ SSH and scripting, and a copy-paste button! Oh, and an actual keyboard. All the iPhone had, was “Ooh, teh shiny!”. Which is appropriate for something that is not a computer, but jewelry, I guess. Then the iDiot came along, and acted like he “invented” all of it, and did so first! Ripping off everyone else _yet again!_ Just like with the Xerox Alto that he copied the Mac from.\nAnd because Microsoft panicked, and installed the Steven Elop mole in Nokia, to murder it from the inside, before their Linux-based glorious N900-line phones were finished, Nokia died a death as miserable as Windows Phone and iOS combined. Yay!\nFucking power of the passive-thinking retards! This is why actual democracy is a bad thing.
Let's be honest here \nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone X are just useless
They basically made a phone with a screen smaller than the Plus versions, without a home button/finger print censor. And added a facial recognition that is so secured that the guy demonstrating fail to unlock on stage.
You're welcome for MY life juice
*in the year 3000* here's our new iphone M X available now for *100,000*
if i want to break into the iphone x just grab your phone when your sleeping put phone in face and ta-da i can do what ever i want\n\n\n\npass

With the oil diesel gas companies, we will never see cars to move with water because of the ELITE . By the way i like when ELITE say stop the polution of the earth , but they don't let the people with knowlege to give the technologie to produce cars that use water to move. So the ELITE think we are idiots, but they don't know, that we know friendly enviroment ways to use vehicles, and that means we are not idiots, we just pretend we don't know nothing. So tomorrow again let's fill up with gasoline in our car's and keep up the polution of the earth. Funny story ha ?
Why the fuck was there a car PARKED in front of the run?\nThat is so fucking stupid in so many ways. Idiots.
I was honestly thinking those shoes are so tall, how does she walk in those? Right before Tan fell 🙈
Where are your sunglasses from😍
Tanya, for what it's worth, I think it worked out better that you had to wear your trainers, especially when it came to taking photos with everyone. That SAME thing has happened to me in high heels and, oh my gosh, the pain was terrible! I actually relived it watching this. In fact, I had to look away when you showed the photo when it happened. Glad you're ok!
What Jim wants is a pasta or salad bowl, which both have low sides: http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/food-drink/best-pasta-bowl-marks-and-spencer-habitat-denby-royal-doulton-a7043676.html
What was the mac lipstick colour you where wearing at the event? I NEED!💗
Loving the new camera
I would love to know how to shop for your shape, or if you even think about it at all! I love your style
Where we you having coffee..looked really nice in the terrace area?
Love the dress, sunnies \nSo pretty \nYou look gorgeous \n\nLove this vlog
Show us the mirror you buy for your stairway Tan when you get it.love things like that.xx
You are a delight.....!🌟🌟🌟
please do a fall wadrobe video ♥♥♥
I did the exact same thing in shoes with an ankle strap! It was ligaments in my leg just like you described not the ankle at all really! Ouch!
Where is your footstool from?? love it!!
You need to throw away those shoes! Regardless the price! They're dangerous! 😂
You are a great person and I hope your ankle is better be blessed!!!
Love you so much!!💗💗💗💗
Tanya, I've been watching your videos for about 2 years now, and I honestly keep forgetting that you're well-known or 'famous' or however people want to put it. It's not at all that I don't think you should be :D (obviously, because you're so lovely and talented and beautiful, and the list goes on...) but it's just that you are so down to earth and modest! I mean it would seem obvious that many people love you because of YouTube, but ironically, even while I'm watching you on YouTube, you seem more like a friend than someone on my computer screen who so many other people also follow.\nJust thought I would share what was on my mind :P I'm sure many of you, watching, can relate!\nHope that makes sense. Haha!
Look for pasta bowls! Think that's what jim's  after
Where are your sunglasses from? They are so gorgeous 😍
Rolled ankles take longer to heal than broken because they arent casted. Wrap it and ice it. Don't wall on it for 2 weeks or else it will Never heal!!! Ice and bed rest and crutches for you. Plus pnce you injure your ankle that ankle will be prone to injuries for he rest of your life had the same thing happen to me
The focus is really good. Good 🎥
Never knew they personalized Yorkshire tea! My dad works at Taylors of Harrogate and makes those and I never knew, I love Yorkshire tea!
You look beautiful Tan. I hope your ankle feels better. Please look into a plant based diet as you dont need to kill to cook and no life need be taken for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Love your channel, Ive been following you for the last 7 or 8 years. Take care of Jim and Martha. ❤❤❤
My best friend and I were so happy we were able to meet u.  Love u sooo much 💕😍😘❤️
You look so lovely Tan, that dress is one of the nicest outfits I've seen. When I saw those shoes I thought they looked dangerous, had some similar and did exactly the same last year. Tore ligaments and was hobbling around for weeks , all the way through a holiday in Dubrovnik! You're a trouper for not crying lol and powering through!
How gorgeous you look in that dress!
what is the lipstick your wearing??? ❤
Tan's vlogs are the best <3
I've preordered your book Tanya x
I feel your pain! I fell and sprained my ankle in July and it took ages to heal. Hope you're feeling better already!
great vlog love! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I've pre ordered your book and ordered your xmas calendar
10:38 she get's her ankle bruised 😟
What sunglasses did you have on?
I have so much respect for you! I can't believe you did a meet and greet with a sprained ankle! Take care of yourself Tan 😢❤😚
this dress looks AMAZING on you
The red dress is so flattering on you!!!
Love this so much!! Tanya we love youuuu!!!! Check out my new vids xxx
5:20 - I think he's looking for a soup plate then. Love your taste in home ware!  xx
Sounds weird but your teeth urghhh I'm so jealous 😕❤️
That dress is gorgeous and oh so feminine! 😍
Out of interest, how much tea does the average Brit consume a day and why do they love it so much?
You inspire me so so much, your my hero. You make me so happy every time I watch you, you make me smile. I've been watching you for 2 years now and since I get really stressed and have anxiety I have loved to come home every week excited to watch your videos and have something to look forward to, like a reward. Thank you for just doing what you do, you are amazing and have really helped me get through tough times. 💕🙂
Hope your ankle is better👍✳️👍✳️👍✳️
can u do more what i eat in a day videos i love them !!
Hey Tan, your so inspiring! Thank you die uploading a new video! But when i read the title i that you were going to talk about mentally getting hurt and i would be interested to hear you talk about that! Xx
Love the new Vlog camera! 💗
Omg I'm in your vlog ahhh I'm so happy 😁✨🙌 it was nice to meet you at reserved
Great video! What card holder did you have in your bag? After one and yours looked perfect as it had a zip for change too. Xx
I have the exact kind of bowl you need and bought it in John Lewis.  Eat my pasta and stir-fries in it.  Sorry I can't photograph it - it's in my London flat- but it's white and perfect.  BTW you always look amazing, I love your make-up line and the make-up you're wearing today.  Would that be Woodwinked eyeshadow from MAC?  Lots of love from me Kate xxx, and from my five yo daughter Maya xxx who is your biggest fan and loves baking your cakes ❤
PLEASE tell me where your sunglasses are from!!!! Omg they are to die for.
I'm already getting excited for Vlogmas. Am I the only one? The shopping in the beginning just gave me the Vlogmas vibe :D
I JUST LOVED WHEN U SAID MOROCCO; YOU MADE MY DAY TANYA <3  ! LOVE FROM MOROCCO !
Aww loved this video Tanya! You look stunning in this video
Where did they go for breakfast? Looks stunning!
oh my goodness - seeing a meet and greet like that shows how exhausting it must be! and on a twisted ankle too! you are awesome, tan <3
I love Kate's outfit! Does anyone know where her coat is from? :) x
Coach nude patent loafers would have been comfortable and looked great with your dress.
Oh wow! It's so weird seeing the meet n greet in fast forward!!
I can't wait for your Christmas Vlogs!!!!!!!
Love that red dress. I felt your pain when you fell. I've sprained my ankle twice and it's not fun. Glad yours wasn't that bad
So amazing to see you loving  my national clothing brand 💓
I love your vlogs so much 💜
I love all the reserved pieces you picked out! Great vlog <3
Love youre vlogs specaily when there long! So sad for youre enkel but i hope it feels fine soon!:) And i can't wait till vlogmastime this year❤️🎄 And i am watching youre old vlogmas back so cozy^^ xxx
The book you held up, Conversations with Friends, is currently on my bedside table. I am just getting into reading it! I bought it in Paris when on a girls vacation with my best friend. Tanya, I hope you enjoy reading it when you get time 😄
Ahhhh loved the dress so much on you that I just ordered it straight away! You poor poppet with your ankle, I so felt for you, I hate falling over so totally got that you felt a bit shook up! Hope it was okay after your busy day! X
Did You know that Reserved is from Poland?
Love the new camera xxx
OMG!!! I love those glasses!!! Beautiful and they look so amazing on you! xoxox
I think you might have lightly twisted your ankle there Tan. So I think you resting it is probably good, also should have picked up a compression bandage.
Well wishes for your ankle lovely! Try a heat compress.
Probably a sprain, so if it's really swollen and bruised wrap it and it'll be better in and week or two
Oh my goodness where did you get your sunglasses, they are the exact pair I've been looking for??!
Don't you just love when people have actual meaningful conversations with you?!?! I think It's the best, love meeting new people.
Hi Tan! Loved your vlog as per! Bit random but I wanted to make a recommendation for shallower bowls if you're still looking for them lol, Sophie Conran has the most beautiful wider, shallower white ridged bowls that are fab for stir fries & pasta etc. Zoë x
Amazing vlog ♥
<3
What vlogging camera is this?
love the  outfit
Hey! Amrit pal is ginger :)

Looking so lovely Tanya ❤️
Love your dress! X
Going to Reserved  tomorrow!

love your dress! sorry your ankle got hurt
Does anyone know if Tan's lips are naturally that size or if she has lip injections/something like that?  She has the most beautiful lips and they look extremely natural.
I love the lip color you're wearing, what is it please?
Oh no! This has sold out in my size- I wanted to wear this red dress for a bridesmaid dress!
Does anyone know where Tanya's pyjamas are from?
Hi Tanya, I'm also an EGYPTIAN and I watch basically ALL of your videos! I'm a huge fan!💕
I wonder if Tanya would ever like my magic...
To the girl (anyone who knows) at 15.05 where are stripe trousers from? Maybe like so more people can see? Thanks!
Hey tan can you do a video showing your Christmas products?? Thank you!! Xx
ｍｏｒｅ　ｈｕｍａｎ　ｔｈａｎ　ｈｕｍａｎ
Short?  We need a full length film of this !!!
This is one of those few times where I happily exclaim, Make it 4hours long, Make it a series, Make it a Mini-Series!!  This collaboration of Blade Runner and Shinichiro Watanabe is just too perfect to simply condense it into a short film...
See you space blade runner...
Holy shit this is perfect. I really hope we get to see more stories from this world in different formats.
this is probably gonna turn out better then the new movie
By Shinichiro Watanabe! Holy shit fuck the new movie i want the anime version :D
Anime, cyberpunk and FlyLo, as if that isn't the best combination
10 bucks this is over hyped\n00:50  and 00:56 wrong . the world of blade runner ISN'T a dirty trash filled distopia ,\n00:53 why did need to add goofy star wars hats to the police. the cops in blade runner are normal cops .\nthe world of blade runner is product practical NOT what looks (((scifi)))
A western movie being adapted into anime? YES This is what I'd like to see more, not the other way around and end up with shitty adaptations...
i guess we're gonna need this short to be significantly less short than it is probably gonna be... more like 150-something minutes short...
Also, is it just me, or doesn't those animation sheets look pretty massive in physical scale compared with most other standard animation paper? Or is it to accomodate more detailed drawings for theatrical cinemascope animations?
I can't believe we're getting a new Shinichiro Watanabe project with music from Flying Lotus. This is literally a dream come true. I'm sure the movie will be great in its own right, but this is something else.
I'm glad they put subtitles on, because I don't know Japanese...
I never asked for this...but I'm glad.
I need a background of the girl at 1:01
I'm freaking stoked about this. This is going to be amazing.
Good to see the world of BR coming back to life again.
They could expand this into a 26 episode series, it'd definitely find a market.
OH WOW! Something decent will come out of this sh*t movie sequel.
how long will this be?
This looks like Under the Dog but good.
This is the best news I've heard in a while
idk if the anime short version are good or bad, but if is good, i hope they make it into featrue film.
This looks pretty awesome, and is immediately on top of my must-watch list.
Been waiting for this since 1984 when I first got into anime, and Shinichirō Watanabe is directing! ^_^
I hope it's longer than 5 minutes.
hopefully this gets Subbed and sony doesn't fuck over everyone who doesn't know japanese who wants to watch it.
Warner Bros USA olease put the anime in the home video release
I love anything Watanabe related, it's gonna be amazing <3
Forget this. We want Cowboy Bebop!
I came. I saw. I came. What a lovely year for cyberpunk!

Oh yes

製作時間…。_ﾛ(･ω･=) ｹｼｹｼ
WOW
ほほう
渡辺監督なら観ないと！
I wished we can Kickstart this for a whole mini-series.
Hope the movie does well so hopefully we get a full blade runner universe with books, games and other media.
why dont make an anime series with this quality????? WHY WHY!!! ;)
Coming soon... How soon is soon? And when it arrives, HOW DO WE WATCH IT?! ... legally, that is...  I have gotten to the point where I refuse to pirate stuff...  :D
私の中で神格化された作品だけに、その続編というのは複雑な心境だ。コケるくらいなら最初から作らないでほしいという気持ちもある。果たして上手くいくかどうか・・・頼むぜ。
Looks like another Ghost in the Shell movie. Look i like Anime, but Blade Runner shouldnt turn into Anime. The *Live* action movie is a Masterpiece, turning this into Anime is really mediocre, maybe the style and Visuals will be pretty and awesome, like Akira. But where does the Lore fit? They also ruined Godzilla with the mediocre, bad Cgi Grootzilla movie...
So a black dude and a fucking chick, just LIKE everything else these days... PASS!

just back from  a walk where i spent 10 minutes trying to get a snail off the middle of the road with a leaf so he wouldn't get crushed by a car... clicks on this vlog and sees you saying your gonna eat some 'fuckin snails' ... sigh. I wish humans would learn to have respect for other life forms on the planet, then maybe they wouldn't destroy the planet and all the living things on it as much.
loving your book so so much! i cried when it came in❤️😭 also your necklace is absolutely adorable! please come to the US.. more specifically Pittsburgh. i'd love to meet you, you've helped me get my life back mel! love always, no matter where you're off to next!!😘
UGH I MISS PARIS SO BADLY😭😭😩
you seemed nervous to eat at times in this vlog, we are all routing for you. you are doing amazing. so so amazing. i am so so proud. that's the reality with EDs, sometimes they attempt to creep back in. whether this was intentional or something i'm just picking up on, it's made me realize that i actually eat like crap to punish myself, warped but oh well. i'm going to start eating better. thank you. you are an inspiration for all with EDs, especially the invisible ones. thank you.
This vlog was just pure joy to watch!! Thank you so very much for letting us have a glimpse of your trip!...the music, the architecture, the food, and that red dress you bought,...perfection!! So happy you had such a fantastic time! Next time, come to my neck of the woods...literally, the Pacific Northwest United States!
Escargots are one of my favorite things to eat. SOOO tasty (all that herbed garlic butter). Glad to see another food diary from you, Melanie! I love your channel. And the little song about the French man with the baguette had me laughing out loud.
Does anyone know where that lovely corduroy mustard yellow coat is from?? I need it!!
i know you've probably already mentioned it at some point, but i honestly can't remember,, where is your yellow jacket from bc it's so !! nice !!
Cross the pond and visit Mexico! I'm sure you'll love our food and sights and all
So weird to see this video as I'm French but you gave a little something to Paris threw this vid! I think you'd love Toulouse! (If you come I'll be your personal guide ;)) <3 Love from France <3
I'm French, and I love your videos so much ! Je les adore ! It's a shame you didn't get to do a meet up here, because I live really close to Paris and I would have loved to get to talk to you even just a little bit ! You are a beautiful person inside and out, keep travelling and doing what you do best. As we say here in France, je t'embrasse. ❤
Food diary Friday in Paris, I'm in heaven! Italy would be another great place to Food diary in. Oh, and New York had awesome food. I'm still waiting for you and Jessie to do a sister trip there. ;D\nYour heeheeheeheehee at the dick bread killed me. lol\nOMG I've been craving a good hot chocolate for like 2 weeks.

Ohhh I loved this! Love the music you put in, the food, the insights, seeing the beautiful places ext! Great video xxx
Love the les mis music for the video! Glad to see the food diaries are back 😊
For super thick and ultra chocolatey hot chocolate, make it in a crock pot! Sounds odd but trust me on this one and give it a try.
Usually hate travel vlogs, but loved this! U actually shared the culture and were genuinly so excited and it really came through. Now I'm dying for a fricken chocolate croissant !!! Xxx
in your food diaries you eat a lot. do you eat that much just for the video or do you always eat that much in the course of a day?
Two of my favorite things. Melanie and France :)
with Your love of style and food a video in an italian city would be perfect
Using your video for inspiration on how to decorate my Year 9 French book haha\nLOVE YOU MEL, YOU ARE SO WONDERFUL XXXXX
That cover of stromae is wonderful!
Ahhh, seeing Notre Dame and hearing Lindsey Stirling's Les Mis medley made me legitimately emotional! I really want to go to Paris now!! (also i'm hormonal and sick so that's also not helping at all) I looked for your book in Easons Cork, and I couldn't find it! Probably good because I had told myself I was only allow buy the one book!
honestly just come to turkey and have some real food 😆😆
Id love to see this video in España! 🇪🇸
The best thing I've ever eaten in my life was a pistachio creme brulee in a little cafe outside the Louvre.\nI knew exactly what face you were going to make at 9:32 when you tasted that.\nIT'S SO GOOD! SO GOOD!
I had goosebumps the whole time I was watching this!
Oh Melanie if you ever come back to my lovely city of Paris, I'd like to meet you
Oh my god are you seriousssssss ?!?!? Mellll Nutella is Italiannnnn 😳\n(Sorry I literally live where they produce it so I just freaked out a little bit) \n❤️
You definitely have to come to India. The food here is mind-blowing

What target audience  is your book geared towards . Looks beautiful there . What desserts r popular ? I say it again I love those yellow tight . I been inspired to find them here in Nashville . 💞😘
You should do a pub crawl in Ireland, and eat and drink and go through rules for tourists going to a bar (the dos and don't)!

I love that you used Lindsey Stirling in this. 😊
I feel so relaxed happy and also sad and rested but also feeling a calm restlessness. Beautiful vlog. There are many Pari vlogs, but this one is so different from those. Music helped the vlog a lot. Melanie you went up a notch with this one👌👌👌
Only 3 minutes in and this vlog is perfect

I would love to go to Paris with you  next time 😁 And pls come to Norway and make a food vlog  😊
Your fringe looks like a lot like Amelie's when you were at the Café des 2 moulins... omg I really want to go there 😍
I got way too excited when you showed the Two Windmills. Amelie is my favorite movie.
Love all your dresses! I am so ready for that shape to come back into style cos my thighs aren't having this bodycon shit!
Such a nice video. I love France!
This gave me major Paris blues. It's my favourite place in the entire world! <3. I would love for you to do a food diary in Krakow, Poland xx
I love that Melanie says a little espresso, it's very cute. But actually that's the real size of an espresso in Italy, it's how it is supposed to be! Btw Nutella is Italian too.
I loved this and i really want to go to Paris!
Oh my god Melanie was literally talking about Dan Browns book and I was freaking out didn't know you like it Mel! I love it!! Ohh I am so excited rn😂
Aww I live in Paris, always have! You made me want to go back out there and explore with my tourist glasses on <3
My absolute favourite video of yours! The music, the filming, it was magical Melanie 💚
loving the stromae covers in this!! #toutlememe

Your outfit in this and hair remind me of Amelie !
You're so fit 😍 Wanna see you with black hair again.
Isn't it fun getting to the point where you can eat in moderation and have a good time!!!! 💘
What a great video! We got to see Paris with a Melanie voiceover. :)  Nice. BTW, the red dress looks great on you IMHO.
That was a freaking joy to watch!!! Thank you for that wonderful morning boost Melanie. I loved your editing too btw with the beautiful French music, and beautiful choices too, it was so well done!! :D xx
I just died at 13:01. You are so great xD
Ethical omnivorism:):):):) yet...you have no idea where your salmon etc came from! LOVE IT !!!! You're so logical and smart Melanie!!!!!
Loved this video!!! Made me want to go to Paris so bad, especially with someone as lovely as you Mel :)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Disney movie, and it is CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED!  THANK YOU for loving it too!  I'm glad you had such a fun time!
Hehehe, I joined in with your devious laugh at 6:46. You did a wonderful job putting this vlog together! The music, food, and everything else just complimented it so well. I also want to add that you looked unbelievably gorgeous in each dress. Seems like you had a great time!
Being a giant Les mis fan the music made this video so great!!! Loved it Mel, great video!!:) 😘
Have you heard the original of Tous les memes by Stromae? It's the best!!
OMG. When you laugh at the bread penis!! You are so cute hahahah! And the mini mini banane ^^
This video gave me butterflies in my stomach! I loved everything about it and you make me feel so calm and happy! Love you! xxxx
That Fruit 6.13 in France really wowww cool yumm, prickly pears are my fav, use to pick em' on cousins property, never see em' in stores where i live - yay France is Cool! Naww Amelie gotta dig it out of the cupboard haven't seen in too long! And don't get me started on Disney aww it's simply love. Your outfits were on point, cute dresses, that coat yess ftw

ugh you're so lovely
Melanie, where is your coat from??! 💚
Your voice 😍
Aaaaw such a lovely vlog! As a Parisian this reminded me of how much I love this city 😊 I also appreciated the music choice, sometimes I find them a bit cringy in Paris vlogs but these were lovely, I liked that there were covers (and amazing covers at that)
The actress should have been more sexy
The one and only Lara was Angelina Jolie!
*Lara jumps off boat* \nMe: that's not how it went in the game
Thanks to everyone that didn't watch my video, you've avoided cancer!
Are they gonna cgi bigger boobs on her by the time the movie comes out?
If I scroll down...how many comments are about the actress  having much smaller but more realistic breasts (for an athletic woman) will I see? A woman as athletic as Lara wouldn't have a bra size that massive, let's be honest. Hell her bod makes her less realistic. If she had the muscles of Serena Williams (the monster who plays tennis), then it'll look more believable.
whoever the actress is she does not fit Laras character.she is far to bland.
Goodbye aspirational Angelina Jolie, hello brown-haired nobody with no make up. I hate 2017. Stop making the world ugly SJW cuck pussies.
Rhonda mitral is the best candidate
Grew up on this game &... sShEe Doesnt Remind Me of Laura Croft ::// .. Hopfully the movie is gOOD thOo..
lol so I've seen the movie since I've played the game (which sucked)
No more video game movies!!,they all suck!!
Well, I liked the plane scene.
Looks like a fruitless attempt to combine the original feel of Tomb Raider, and parts of the crap reboot. Seems very disjointed.
Alicia is a good actor... and she is swedish :) like me
You will want to protect her :)
She looks NOTHING like Lara Croft. Who the fuck casted her?
RIP Tomb Raider franchise of the 90s. The original and the best.
Better than Angelina Jolie.... but, I think Alicia Vikander is a bit ugly... no?
Every video game movie has been crap, but after the success of Wonder Woman the studio decides to reboot video game movies with a female character instead.
I was actually kind of digging it until he said that the fate of humanity is in your hands. Why? Why does every blockbuster action movie have to be cranked up to 11? A personal human story is more engaging than, You're the only one that can save us from the end of the world! It makes everything less believable, which in turn makes the audience less likely to connect with the characters.
If this movie does good uncharted is next YES
I feel like that last part of this trailer is the end of the movie.
I hope the movie will be better than the trailer
She is the perfect Laura croft. Sweden first!
Nope, not this one. BORING! Indiana Jones is still better.
some people are sexist, misogynistic, perverts. her breasts are the least of my concern. personally, I have been displeased with the new Lara since they revamped the game. I grew up with classic badass Lara so the sensitive shit bothers me and the over all revamp of the story about her I've always known. why not keep her story and revamp her look and add emotions to her old character? but I guess because she was dying out with the newer generation, they felt they had no choice. personally, this movie seems good but I will never claim her as a croft, I will only call her Lara. she is no croft. the movie itself seems like it may be ok, but again, I grew up with the classics so I prefer the legendary Angelina Jolie forever, she's a better actress and played her role well. who is to say though that this girl does fit the NEW character Lara, although, she doesn't have the same emotions as the new Lara and her story is seeming to change as well in the movie. just remember people, it can't be perfect and they can only do so much with a movie.
If this is good then God must exist
I wish this is overwatch instead...
Be better if this film was two half hours to three hours long instead of the stupid one and half hours long . So much gets missed out by short films.
Angelina Jolie is much better in all aspects. Would not watch this movie.
The only problem I have with the trailer is the music. I really like the Jason Graves theme and if they’re going for the 2013 reboot it would have been smart to add the theme.
Wait I thought Daisy Ridley was supposed to play Laura Croft? Am I thinking of a different movie?
Glad they focus on the story rather than the b**by.  👍🏼
I'm ok with the younger Lara's physique...I just never liked the Katniss Croft concept of the new games/movies.  I'd prefer a Lara who looks/acts more like the first Crystal Dynamics games (Legend, Underworld, Anniversary)
that's one ugly version of lara
I miss Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft but I have to see this bad or good! #TombRaider
no boobs? no lara craft. sorry but thats how it is...
does not look like it will be good.  It seems like there will be little to no character development for Lara.  The whole point of the newer Tomb Raider games (which this looks to be based off of) is that Lara finds inner strength to continue on.  Sure, she knows how to shoot guns and stuff, but she doesn't go to the island expecting to use any, and her first time killing someone comes as quite a shock to her.  She shouldn't be billy bad ass at the beginning of the movie, but instead be an intelligent, normal young woman.  This is all speculation at this point, but the trailer, rather than encouraging me to see the movie, actually discourages me from watching it.
Yeah this will fail... Must they always need them to be over the top action moves, who tha fuck hires this stupid writers witch copys the game script witch was great and make it shity
Her jumps aren't realistic. It immediately broke the immersion for me.
OMG!! I want to see this so bad lol
Does every modern trailer have to spoil the whole 3/4s of the movie?
Damn people are harsh on this one! Looks fun to me, so many chunks of the games and Alicia Vikander is AMAZING in everything she does. Can't wait!
Oh cool Bajie and sunny from into the Badlands are in this movie
Had no hopes for this movie and... still dont. I love tomb raider but that doesn't mean I need to go through the same story.
So they're trying to make a movie out of parts of both games with some original content thrown in?  Should be....interesting.
Anyone bring some cheese to go with all this whine?
Damn man i would have been ok without a movie. Hollywood is going to ruin it like they did with Assassin's Creed...
oh i remember her, she played one of the high ranking agents in the latest jason Bourne movie. i thought her resting bitch face was so hot. im totally gonna see this
Games are legendary ! Movie ...I mean wer all gonna watch it at some point -_- lets be real, Theaters or not
It's weird how hard it is to make a good videogame movie. But also, since there's brand recognition, people will see it anyway. Maybe this is just how directors experiment safely.
Angelina Jolie IS Lara Croft which is why the 2001 tomb raider is a guilty pleasure for me but I have low expectations from this. It looks like a fan made film that was meant to be a YouTube red original.
OMG!!!!!! no way!!!! this trailer is a disgrace for the game. Alicia Vikander can't take Lara's role. not even as her assistant
This possibly looks like the best movie ever made!!!
Oh fuck...PLEASE *DON'T* end up like Assassin's Creed. (Even though it was good, not excellent, but OK)
Since this is a video game movie, it's obviously gonna suck
I played that game......Too much interesting....O_O...This movie gonna hit....I know already>>HEEHEE
Just play the game
I love the traps. This is what Tomb Raider is about!
Не девка вообще не тянет на лару крофт да и сам сюжет не фонтан
Yeah no, this looks terrible.
Hmm... Horse Raider?
Nope cnt redo that shit man
i respectfully decline LMAOOO
one thing is missing\nangelina joli
no angelina then no lara croft
fak why this is not irina shayk?
Another batman origin story?

#Not my Lara Croft
Ew
She so ugly.
Another shameless remake
Alicia Vikander replacing Angelina Jolie huh?
Not enough boobs
Tits too small
Angelina Jolie where are you ?
Game graphics are really improving.
I'm getting Katniss Everdeen vibes

Какая же хуета!
Bi tek Türk olarak ben mi yorum yaptım?
Tomb Raider: Anorexia version.
*Where is Angelina Jolie?! :o*
Cliche
Omg ! This will be awesome !
Wtf is the noise at 1:53
Some of the worst movies have great trailers.\nThis trailer is pretty trash with mediocre CGI highlights, so you can expect the movie to be extremely horrid.
*I’m still alive, if anyone cares...*
why is his name Arnold? My name is Arnold just wondering.
Plankton
Nice work😂😂...maybe your next video could be about Arnold time travelling and getting hurt  in every past event he travels to😀
What happens if you stood at the bottom of the ocean
How long can you survive from drowning
Arnold is A Tortured Guy And Why He Is Always Lost 1 Finger?
Why do you always loose your finger
there tons a fish dea- wait spongebob how you there
Do a video if Arnold weighed 1000 pounds
0.32 Who lives in a whale under the sea?
Wow poor Arnold. I'm surprised he isn't dead by now
Hey, everyone! Feeling like supporting a man's hopes and dreams of becoming famous on the internet? Come check out DougHub! Where it's all Doug, all the time!
Learn from Jonah, he survived in the whale.
Arnold without oxygen in water!!! To see what happens!!!!
Spongebob lives in a whale now?!
Stranded on Sand Island...\n.\nplease
I was recommended this. I now value one less person's opinion in this world. Good day.

What will happen to Arnold with no water?
the best YouTube channel ever.\nalmost half a million subscribers with just 8 videos
This doesn’t take into account gods almighty power ! She is so powerful !
I just binge watched all your vids I have work in a few hours, what am I doing
I saw SPONGEBOB at 0.33
Would anyone like to say prayer to Arnold?
Who noticed spongebob in the sperm whale
I can't stop watching this

I like your voice
how to tame horse in minecraft
#3 ON TRADING LET'S GOO
Same voice of the Riddle channel!?! Am I correct?! Anyone else hear the same voice?
What if you get stranded on a desert island?
How could he smell the smoke if he was underwater
This comment is hacked no one can like it
What if the moon was destroyed?
\nhey I think you should make least one video a day
The title is supposed to say “what if A whale swallows you alive?”
What would happen if you didn't drink water
Hey Arnold....check out that black hole.
Sperm whales don't have teeth in their upper jaw, FYI
I thought whales only blew out water once they reached the surface to get new oxygen.....
🖕🏿should've been more specific
What if arnold was stuck in the desert for 3 weeks.
What if he is shooted from a sniper?
sperm whales don't have top teeth.
Arnold should have stayed home today :^)
I'm here because of philly D!
What if he falls into the center of the earth? What happens to gravity then?
So that's what Jonah did.
Put Arnold through a super massive black hole!
This was not educational at all
*THAT'S KINDA HOT*
Oh wow noooo...the blow hole is part of the whales respiratory system. It is the same as our nostrils. They spray you see isn't water they've swallowed, it's mist and vapor. Please re-edit the video to show this correction. Unless the misinformation was just for fun
HOW LONG CAN ARNOLD LAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN WITH NO BOAT
485k subs -> 2.5M views in a day
RIDDDLE? IS THAT YOU????!?!?!
Nope. They got fed up with that tastless arnold and decided to get away from bad tastless humans yup. Arnold you piece of shit!
Who else saw spongebob at .33
You got 488,000 subs in just a month \nCan you beat Jake Paul's record of 5 mill in 6 months
Send Arnold to north Korea (:
Did anyone notice the timer was spot on?
-what did I just watch?-
as a christian I wholly disagree. A man HAS survived in the belly of a fish in the bible.\nIn fact one of the biggest fish kind like whales is big enough for thousands of trolls\nto live in and be annoyingly random.
NEW CURRY SHOES ON MY CHANNEL!🏀💦

The graphic says 3cm and the narrator says 20cm. Get your shit together.
Lol when the fish slapped him in the face
What if you took psychedelics ?
I’m a little disappointed it’s not about Frank’s family being killed by the mafia. That would of been awesome, but I guess it’s been done before.
Is that police officer in the trailer Simpson from Jessica jones ?
a fight with black widow?
Does anyone remember the extremely gory game of the punisher?
I’ve watched this trailer about 1 million times, am I the only one?
Thanks to everyone that didn't watch my video, you've avoided cancer!
M E T A L L I C A  O N E
Anyone else just think that the 'One' remix sounds really cool
The marvel show we've asked and waited for.
Lets Take a Moment to Appreciate the Metallica Song in the Background making the Trailer Even more Epic
About time we see a little hard core justice and a series that hasn't gone pc....or has it? 🤔🙈
I'm anticipating this more than anything else right now!
Why is the thumbnail not photoshopped good?
Been waiting for the comic-book version for a LONNNNNNGGGGGG time! Bout f-ing time!!!
When is it coming out!
Trailer is on point, I like some great editing that goes with the music! Plus, come on, Metallica! Can’t go wrong with that if they approved their song to be used for this, it must be good.
First and foremost> Thank you Netflix for making a show about the bad guy because. What a breather.
Hell yeah!!! One by Metallica!
Now this is porn.......
We're about to get a fucking balls to the wall full-on Punisher series. Life is Good.
The perfect song too.
This is so fucking badass god damn it FUCKING MACHINE GUNS DOING THE DRUM PATTERN THATS SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE MACHINE GUNS THIS SHOWS GONNA RULE
So sick of this superhero garbage.
Has anyone else played the Tomas Jane punisher yet while blasting One yet?!?
Wait, the punisher is a black dude?? That's so LIBERAL sooooo TRENDY.
1K think Frank Castle is dead
Wow, gory stuff. Over at DougHub, we've got fun, awesome content just for you! We may be small now, but one day we can grow with your help!
this will be violent right? like.... logan violent??
HEY GUYS I DID PUNISHER WITH CLAY IN MY CHANNEL I WOULD LOVE YOU WATCH MY VIDEO AND TELL ME IF I DID IT GOOD OR BAD :D Thanks!!
Will Eminem be in this ?
I dont know what it is about this dude but I just don't like him. Didn't like him in Walking Dead and I don't care to see him as Punisher. I'm a huge Punisher fan but I won't be watching this. Bad Casting IMO
They used my favorite song for the trailer.  Netflix, you got my attention.
How do I stop watching this on loop?
Veryyy fitting that they put metallica in this trailer
Not at all surprised that the fans demanded a Punisher spin-off (me among them :D ). And Jon Bernthal is the best Punisher yet. By kind of a lot.
God Damn it Shane just die already!!!
Seeing as it's Marvel, I'm surprised that Punisher isn't some fat transracial transgender pansexual feminist Communist-Socialist who loves islam.
Hey it's Shane I thought rick killed you
It took over 3 decades ... but it seems I'm finally going to get the Punisher movie I've been waiting for.  EPIC.
Fuck yea I've been waiting for punisher to get his own show on Netflix
Finally something good from Marvel.
I guess the only real question here would be... Is Rosario Dawson hooking up with the punisher?
F*CK YEA!  The Punisher, always one of my favs cause he doesn't give a f*ck who you are!  This looks great, the music has me hyped & it looks like it can give Daredevil season 1 a run for it's money!
In the timeless words of Ned Leeds: Badass
smh first spider man now this?
I am responsible for atleast 1 million views since yesterday! just keep coming back every 10 mins!
Good to see this guy finally get a leading role whatever his name is
Hopefully this series won't feel like it drags on too much like the other marvel shows on netflix.
Let's beat satan badly. Say a prayer to Jesus ✝️🔑💜
Hopefully Blade and Moon Knight are next
Any clue when it comes out
Omg One in the background makes it complete
This looks so much better than the movies. I'm looking forward to this
Maybe, just maybe, Marvel will get the Punisher right in a video format.  4th time is the charm, right?
Those 1k down votes belong to the people the Punisher is going to kill... \n\nBut also, fuck yeah! Can't wait for this!
I still think Crossbones would have made a good punisher.
Many people reacting to this video and ask why does the murder of franks family take place in the house. My thought is that it doesn't. The trailer just shows frank remembering his family.
HELL YES!!! MY FAVORITE MARVEL ANTI HERO IS BACK!!!
Как же он, сцука, хорош! Нетфликс браво.
Frank Castle is Jon Bernthal!
So excited 🤤
Oh babe!😍

Darkness\nImprisoning me\nAll that I see\nAbsolute horror\nI cannot live\nI cannot die\nTrapped in myself\nBody my holding cell\n\nYeah, sounds like The Punisher.
The thumbnail makes him look like he let out a wet fart during all that action.
I can't believe this has less views than Tomb Raider!!!!!! 😡
Someone decifer the date in the description!
I will subscribe to everyone who subscribers to me, likes this comment and comments done Interbants
I can't remember anything
Defenders had Nirvana in trailer, but in tv show itself was only hip-hop. Hope this time it's not a trap.
Shane 🙃
I fucks with this
Damn.
Not interested. Make a movie
this is going to encourage some liberal lunatic to try to assassinate the Donald, never really heard of a movie or TV show where the answer to government coruption is a killing spree
4.4 million views in 1 day, and still not trending in Aus? K.
Whyd they bring metallica into this?
Holy fuck yes !!! (And the Metallica.... HELL YES!) 🤘😝
Yawl have no idea how many times I've re watched this trailer it looks like the punisher we need in same universe as web slinging teen  a space Oprah gotg a Harlem bad ass the avengers and a guy who shrinks and is Olin acid with Doctor strange great times can't wait for the show

This is obviously a skit. If you look closely, their hands are controlling their mouths and the people are singing. Singing turtles and rabbits don’t exist
they are all have talent, but darcy has the most,
2:25 she did that with her mouth closed. That girl deserved it. No sob story just real talent.

She messed up at the beginning who caught that
but what happened in the beginning
Wow she messed up the beginning and still did an amazing job!!! I'm so impressed messing up and being that nervous with her idol doing with her and she just jumped right back into it!!!! She was made for the stage!!!!

How cute is Petunia's voice x
1000 people are jealous this young lady has 1000x the talent they have
Is it sad that even hearing Tyra’s voice almost ruined the video for me?
I don’t think she should have won
Its so funny how you can win Americas Got Talent by being cute and/or have little talent in a rare field.
I loved at the begginning when the girl messed up how both of them kept going. It was professional and shows both of their experience in performing
Here's the only secret you need... http://bit.ly/2xjxlyv
we are all puppets after all, strings..there are not strings on me...
I Think she is better than Terry .
“Anything i can do you..” *silence* “no you cant”
NEW CURRY SHOES ON MY CHANNEL!🏀💦
Anything I can do you can do better, uh...  LOL!  Congrats on your win Darci!  Our family is happy for you :)
L i k e ! ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆
Say p and the lips will move
Darci: Any thingy I can do, you........
This girl is a class act.  It's awesome how she pretty much upstaged the great Terry Fator.  She was born to perform.  She kind of gives me Shirley Temple vibes:  wildly talented beyond her years.  I see a lot of success in her future.
THAT WAS SO CUTE!
NOW THIS TALENT!!!! two BIG GREAT ONES!!!
When he drank the water!!! 😂🤣😂
Ive been waiting for this
Hey I know her! She’s pretty chill.
I love this so much
Anything I can do you can d-...

AWSOME!!!
Why are people disliking. Untalented jealous people
So cool! Does Terry Fator still perform in Las Vegas?
And yet again the adorably cute act triumphs over the acts that had actual talent

What happened at 1:44? Did everything go silent for a sec or is it just me?
1:46 what happened to the audio
that awkward silence
So..........When a human messes up a song they get the boot almost always, but when it's a puppet its Unbelievable!
https://youtu.be/Okyspn5EDwc help you guys out and take a look
This is top 2 in trending
1:45 I felt so bad when she made a mistake
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTxO4CYjAuc&t=0s
Is it just me or did she make a mistake at the start of the song
Dont think she should have brought someone out to help. Angelicia didnt sing with anyone
Hello everyone for the longest time I had the passion of developing a mobile game something fresh and something that could really change the industry but I never had the support to achieve this dream. I finally took the big leap to run towards my goal please check out my gofundme link for more details your donation to help me achieve this is appreciated but your support is much more appreciated\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/4gv9mp4
1:46 did Darci mess up ?
As always, the show gets robbed by a little girl. This was planned from the beginning probably because Fator's act wasn't selling tickets. Stupid.
I'm going to kill myself now bye YouTube.  . 😤🔫 horrible talent
I'm here for all the actors but who else screamed when they saw AMY POND
So ready for the new Jumanji!\nGreat cast btw.
I can't wait for this
It really look great(GnR made it even better). I will definitely watch it when it comes out.
Whovians UNITE!!! 😛😛😛 I miss Amy so bad!!! 😩😩😩 I saw Karen Gillan, I clicked.
Cool!
Am i still​ black? 😂😂😂
This is a great year🙌🙌
Thanks to everyone that didn't watch my video, you've avoided cancer!
He exploded from eating a cake?!! Hahahahahahaha
JUMANJI REMAKE? Yea because the first one was such a classic......
Why did the ginger girl end up looking the same??
80% are watching because of the actors the rest 20% are watching because there actually fans of the story
*But will we get an actual Jumanji video game for PS4/Xbox One?*
What is this movie?
The cake is a lie
Kevin Heart:  Where's the rest of me?
Argh... Need... More... Amelia... Williams... when can I see this? (I guess the others are fine too... jk no offense, they are all great actors)
This cane out a long time ago
Never judge a book by its cover... but this ain’t a book so.... this looks fucking shit!
Let's beat satan badly. Say a prayer to Jesus ✝️🔑💜
I wish Robbin Williams was still here to see this:'(
Am I still black???\nYes\nOkay! We're fine! Everything is fine!\n😭😭😂😂
It doesn't matter where your hair is Sir. 😂
Super excited for Another Sausage Fest with Token Sexy Woman!! Looks great!! Wonder who her love interest will be? And her OTHER love interest?? Its not worth filming unless there is a forced and unnecessary love triangle
First a board game, then a play station or something.\n\nWhat's next virtual reality?\n\nAnyways really looking forward to this!
I want to watch this movie just to see what jack blacks character weaknesses and strengths are.
I am pretty sure this movie is gonna suck.
I thought this movie came out already lol
What the fuck is this bullshit?
...they had to use the Rocks YouTube channel to even get attention...
They still can't beat robin williams
Fuck you Hollywood. Write something fucking original!!!!!
I'm calling it now that I know it's not in the top comments... \nKevin Heart eating cake turns him into a white chicken... ^_^
Clicked on this cuz I saw Karen Gillan in the thumbnail
Hotline
If Robin Williams was still alive what would he think 🤔🤔🤔🤔
jack black!!!! i'm in
Why Sony fails at making movies so badly: spends a good thirty seconds of their trailer explaining how video game avatars work in a trailer aimed at the 10-45 demographic.
Only one Jumanji....with Robin Williams. :(
I cant help it 😏 - Jack Black lolllllll
*good to see Jack Black back in a major movie! this looks like its going to be a perfect twist on jumanji for this generation of kids! i'm definitely going to see it, i was a fan of the original for sure!*
original Jumanji was scary and funny. This movie will be just funny?
For two decades it should have stayed untouched
why does this even need to be associated with Jumanji?
I'm a Simple girl, I see The Rock and Kevin Hart, I Click...The Simple things in Life 😎
cool I hope they don't fuck up this epic movie😒
Honestly I saw Amy Pond, and auto clicked.
This looks so bad
Robin Williams has re hung himself as he turned in his grave at this jank film
What have they done to jumanji...
Jumanji is a classic, RIP to Robin Williams
It'll never be as good as the original.. with that said, it looks like it has its moments.
Calling it... Kevin's character dives into some monster's mouth and eats some cake blowing himself and the monster up.
This shit ain't no Jumanji. But it looks entertaining though.
Ok I WAS concerned. Concern is gone and now I just want to see the movie.
I'm not used to Amy Pond not having a thick Scottish accent....
My god I'm excited for Karen gillan
To all the butt hurt people commenting about it being disrespectful to the original...\n\nGO & WATCH THE ORIGINAL AGAIN!\n\nThis is a reboot, NOT, a remake.
I'm super excited for this movie to drop !
I love how many losers keep crying about the original. Can't wait for the movie.
This makes me want to watch it even more. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Remember the black guy always dies first
I cried when he blew up
AMAZING CAN'T FREAKING WAIT FOR IT 😁😆
Well I like The Rock and I miss Robin Williams. That is all
I have to see this
more big nigger jokes
im so upset.
Amy pond
What. Seriously. Pass
Another remake, Great!
Zzzzzzzz
Where's Zarthura though
Another reboot.
This looks horrible...
Jumanji franchise is dead.
Still looks like shit.
That looks stupid
Booooo!
OH. MY. GOD. YEEAAAAAAAAAASSSSSS
Am I still black? AHAHAHAHHAHA!
Cringe festival
Amy Pond plus Jack Black
looks like trash.
STOP REMAKING OR REBOOTING MOVIES
seems entertaining enough
My girl Amy Pond
Can't wait lol
CANT WAIT
can't looks awesome...
LOOKS worse than BAYWATCH
Overrated....
Tell me one movie that the rock is in where he isn’t fighting
Is everyone in this comment section a complete idiot
so corny. can't even be original. then you got Kevin Hart in there. fucking cheating scumbag liar to his wife and kids. he only confessed because he got caught. this will be for the losers.
This is an insult to the original.\nI repeat, this is ass.
why do we get childish sequels/prequels
The rock is seeing how many movies he can ruin.
This movie will flop.
Your purple backpack is absolutely gorgeous
Make sure you take a photo in costume in that same doorway near dressing room 22!
Can you get it in? It's not really in is it? Looks like a turtle head - sounds like the time I lost my virginity.
Hi Carrie! My name is Jemma and I just wanted to say how amazing you are. You are such a beautiful person and deserve so much as you are so kind and caring and just the best person. You are an amazing singer and actor and I hope you have an amazing life and career. Unfortunately I live in Australia and I won't be able to see The Addams Family live but it is my absolute dream and I hope that maybe one day I will be able to see you and Oliver perform in The Addams family as well as the rest of the cast. Once again you are beautiful and I love you so much.\n\nMuch Love,\nJemma from Australia!❤️\n(You probably won't see this but I just thought I'd say something nice anyway 😊)
Where did you get your amazing jeans???
Oh my goodness to have a signed photo of you as Eponine?!?! I'd probably faint or cry from happiness. Probably both. <3
I'm glad you are feeling better! Hope Archie survives! I'm gutted I couldn't see you perform in Bristol. But hopefully coming to see you perform in Wolverhampton - can't wait! Xx
Would be so grateful to anyone reading this if they would check my latest video, It's my first one ever which is scary. But karma will repay you good if you help a girl out :) like and sub if you would hehe ❤️❤️❤️ all you have to do is click :)))
Just got back from seeing you tonight! I love love loooooved the show❤️.  You are so amazing Carrie :)
Actually ignore the last comment cos I went to see it on Thursday and it was absolutely amazing. It's honestly one of the best nights of my life. Got to see Oliver at stage door though I'm gutted I couldn't see you. But your performance made it worth it. 💜💜💜💜
As a Bristolian I properly yelped in delight at seeing you in our lovely city! I hope it’s treating you all well 😊
nice, you went past my house
Ah! I lived in Briz for 3 years, so cliché to say but fun to see you at the Hip and around thems local parts! If you get a chance to get up Cabot Tower in the centre, any of the Boston Tea Party coffee shops AND BAKESMITHS MY DAYS. Also the Cotham Hill (said cott-ham or coth-ham?!) charity shops are BRILLO PADS for lil' gems. If you get any down time, a poke around Clifton, cobbles, coffee shops and cute things to see comes warmly reckoed (as does the fish and chips in Clifton!) Enjoy Bristol, I hope you get some quality rest <3
I think boyonce is the perfect nickname for Scott! 😂 xx
Laughing at the crew girls checking out Oli dancing HAHA
Bristol is my country lol
You opening that card.... Oh, Carrie!! We miss you!! Xxx
Dat ass Ms Fletcher 👀😂 someone hasn't been slacking on their squatting 💪😜
Carrie, I'm thrilled your in Bristol but so heart broken because I can't see you because I'm away. Is there anyway I could deliver a letter to you? I love you so much xxxxxxxx
Coming to see you on Saturday 😊😍😘
Is Scott playing Fester permanently? Did Les leave?
Please! Could you do a tutoriel on how you do your two braids with the cute scarf in it? You look too adorable !!
RIP Archie, hey! Maybe he could have played thing!
Carrie is a woman of many hairstyles and I love it. Working the pigtails.
Awww Archie! :(\nGlad you're feeling better, Carrie! I don't remember the last time you wore jeans but those ones look amazing!!!
Love watching behind the scenes of theatre!!!! It's Totally my dream job❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
NIOOOOOO ARCHIE. YOU WERE A WONDERFUL LITTLE MOUSE WHO DID NO HARM TO NO ONE. RIP LIL ARCHIE. WE LOVE YOU😘  ok now I'm crying
When you live in Bristol... OMG 😍😫💗
how would I get my letter to you? :)
I saw you perform last night in bristol (20th) and im seeing you again tonight!!! Couldnt be more excited if i tried Xx
So sad that when I lived in Bristol, the Addams family was on in Cardiff and now I've moved there for uni its in Bristol this week :(
I lived in Bristol for 3 years when I was at uni. I loved it there. It's so quirky and like a mini London.
Wow Carrie, your hair is growing so fast!
I love that you give your coworkers free reign of the camera sometimes! It's super funny, and also fun to see you in action!
any small youtubers wanting to help each other out? ill sub back x
OH MY GOD YOU ARE IN MY HOME CITY! I'm coming to see the show on Friday and I cant wait!
Carrie your backpack is lovely!! so pretty!! xx
Your voice is stunning.  I used to live in Bristol miss it so much x
Coming to see this saturday! So excited as I saw you in les mis and also played Wednesday a few years back in our groups production! My friends went yesterday said it was amazing and took photos with you at stage door! 🎉
My mum and I went to see the matinee in Bristol yesterday! It was the first musical I'd ever been to and we thought you were all amazing :) Such a fun show!
Poor Archie. :(. So is les Dennis still ill, he wasn't well when I saw you last week in Manchester. Also I think there must have been something going around that theatre, I got ill last week too. X
Aw the card from your mom and dad<3 Dressing room nostalgia :') RIP Archie!
I noticed before you mentioned the Cat Cafe that you were going to walk passed it and you gave the exact reaction I thought you would lol, love cat cafes.
Do you think you're gonna venture into the cat café at some point? Love the video! x
Omg I came to watch you when the show came to my city and now my school announced today that we are doing the Addams family as our school musical this year! I'm so happy!
We were at the Saturday show. So sad not to see you proform. You did the right thing though and we enjoyed the show all the same. Hopefully we can come see you in something else soon xxx
your hair looks so good at this length :)
When I saw 'Hippo' in the title, my brain immediately went, Hippo Campus! (the band) and thought Carrie was gonna talk about seeing them live or something... guess I've been watching too many Hippo Campus vids...
Omg he died?? That's so sad 😨😰
Carrie, would you ever be able to do an updated hair care routine? Your hair is looking so long and lovely
I like Oliver's haircut. If I wasn't going bald, I'd get it myself.
How did this get on trending 4 with 45k views
I'm coming to see the show on Saturday evening, so excited!
Omg I LOVE your bag! Where is it from!? X
It was great seeing the show yesterday!
i'm seeing addams family on 5th october!!! in belfast!! missing school and all, i'm so excited
Pause at 7:58 to see three ladies checking out Oliver!
Oliver dancing and those 3 women staring at him like wtf is honestly hilarious!
Awh seeing you at the Hippodrome makes me homesick for Bristol! I love that venue!
Today was my birthday and it kind of felt like I shared it with you, Olie and the cast of the adams family
I was meant to watch you in Bristol but have been really ill for 6 months and didn't make it :( I hope I can get to see it when I'm better next year! Really hope the show went well! XXX
Did you not leave small holes in the mouse box? 😂 bless you!
I missed your live transmition at Instagram. Had to work. So, I'm glad I can see this...
You should sneak a little tribute to Archie into the show somehow...RIP Archie
It’s weird seeing yourself in a video......
Your hair is getting so long!!
Very weird to watch you rehearsing where I used to set out interval drinks working front of house! Wish I could come and see the show, but hope the Hippos treat you well :)
ahhh i miss england so much watching your vlogs carrie but they really help me feel closer to home! <3 i wish i could come and watch the musical but unfortunately i'm a poor british uni student living in australia! i've had one normal night on loop since i first listened to it this morning and im in awe of the notes and lyrics <3
Hearing you sing made me happy💜 glad your feeling better.xx.
as always this has made me so happy! Except, of course, for Archie. Rest In Peace!
Omg I know the chip shop you mean !! It's right by that cat cafe you walked past there, I was there a few weeks ago and admired the Sheridan Smith autographs!!
That booty though Carrie! ❤️🍑 You're gorgeous inside and out 😘😘
i have never been more sad about a mouse dying :( :( :( :( :(
You have a good heart Carrie. Goodbye Archie, we hardly knew ye...
What a morbid ending 😂 was hoping archie would pull through but ya know, great vlog regardless carrie!
So glad that you're feeling better now! It's wonderful to see you smiling since I know last week was difficult for you 🖤
I'm sad that there wasn't a watch me Wednesday for when you was in Sheffield! R.I.P Archie </3
Your photos are gorgeous especially the Wednesday one. Awwww Archie 😘😘
Watched the show tonight and I am still in awe!
my sister and I came to see the show tonight, you guys were fab!! ♥
rip archie addams x
Big up Bristol!
I live there
Carrie in jeans?
hmm
R.I.P Archie
RIP Archie we hardly knew ye
rip archie :(
**glasses nose twitch**
🖤💜🖤
Awwww, rest in peace, little Archie Addams
I love bristol
awww i miss archie
Wherew your tahirt from? Its lovely x
Is Scott uncle fester forever now?!
You were brilliant. Tonight was awesome 😊
ok im really sad about archie
Check out St Nicholas Market in Bristol, also in Cabot Circus they have a shop called flying tiger which I think you would love!
I love seeing the warm ups. By  this point I'm guessing you guys are used to it, no matter how much fun it is, but it seems like such a magical process in my head. I was in a theatre course for over 2 years but my grandmother took me off of it before I could actually participate in anything remotely close to this (it was for health reasons, my grandma is a wonderful woman and only did what was best for me). I wish I could be part of a musical at some point ❤️ I'd love it.
7:12 boyonce I've NEVER laughed so hard in my life 😂❤
I'm wearing a bra, that's enough me too Louise me too
You look great pregnant,  Love you in the black also in the white sweater. What a yummy Mommy you are. The glow is real.
Thanks to everyone that didn't watch my video, you've avoided cancer!
Why are you on trending every day...
How many weeks are you now ?
You look sooo cute Louise, with the baby bump <3 <3
Ni thought you looked quite lovely and put together each day!
Honestly I aspire to have your body confidence! Plus your style is absolutely adorable🌸
Youre so amazing to link everything down below!! I absolutely adore the first outfit and I've just ordered it!!!
Damn Louise! You are looking fan fucking tastic! Pregnant or not, you are a real beauty <3 Love you :)
Louise you're such a stunner💕
Can I just say, I bloody LOVE your hair.
Why's this woman always in trending?
Love how real this is 💗
Haha the leggings comment! I'm 26 weeks pregnant with my first and leggings have become my life!  Great video I'm off on a look out for Monday's chunky knit .... thanks for the vid xx
I love watching Louise and her fashion videos. Im a big person myself and constantly wear basic clothes to try and hide myself, but louise looks fabulous in anything she wears even whilst pregnant. Watching her gives me the urge to go out and do a bit of shopping for myself. Especially ow its autumn and winter and time to start wrapping up and getting cosey. I basically live in jeggins or joggers with a vest top and hoody. And have the same 3 outfits constantly on wash, wear, repeat. Id love to go shopping with louise! Hope to see more :) x
You always look so put together and nice! Seriously how?! X
I love the pink hair. It really suits you!
I really want to see Louise and dan&phil do a collab when the baby is born🙈🙈🙈
Louise I simply love everything about you. Sending lotsandlots of love from Finland  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh my god I love Lindsey Kelk's books she's amazing! You look so gorgeous in all of these Louise!!
The blue vest from Primark suits you so well🤗
That Teddy lipstick from Mac looks incredible on you❤️❤️
Hey Louise, been watching you since your first pregnancy all those years ago! It's been amazing to watch your journey and grow with you, - has to be said i'm noticing a lot of black in this video and as you were saying you were feeling a little flat i'm hoping this isn't coming out / taking its toll on your fabulously glittery wardrobe! - I've never seen anyone rock a sequin like you , you are and look beautiful and shine regardless but I hope you reignite your glitter fire soon -!  x
You are so freaking cute and beautiful! Love the pink hair :)
LOVED the lip colour on thursday!!!
Love love love all of the outfits Louise!
I feel I need to see leggings that many times in a week... Loving your style xx
I love this video!
Outfit diary?! Just like Zoe's?!
I got two of the blue Friday sweater at Primark when I was in London 3 weeks ago and omg they are the softest sweaters ever I love them. I got the orangey one and the maroon one because fall.
I loved this!!! Please do more :)
Never even noticed what a cute bump you had going on until this vid!! 💘💘
Your bump is just the cutest😍
Louise, I just have to say, you are so fabulous! You are so funny and just such a gem.
Louise you slay me!! You make Me laugh from deep in my belly
Can’t seem to be able to open the links for your Thursday comfy outfit... can you pls let me know where the trousers and top are from? Thanks x
Loved this especially that little Animal print belt so cute

Love this! Keep doing these types of videos! Love seeing your outfits 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Aw I love this 😍😍. Seems like you really got your groove back and your bump looks glorious! Monday was my fave - but then I am a magpie when it comes to anything yellow, especially mustard! 💛💛xx
There is something on the chair behind you reflected in the mirror of your first outfit that appears to be a really nice, dazzling dress.  It caught my eye--wondering what is it.  Dress?  Throw?  Also, the white cable knit top looks wonderful on you and really complements your pink hair and blue eyes.
This is amazing!!!! Beautiful! xxx
omg the day you missed is rhe say I wanted to know the black jumper with white stars ! lol
Loved this! I actually lol-ed when you mentioned the background. X
Omg I love Emma!! You two are so funny together, love it!!

I'm living for that yellow orange sweater omg 💀❤️
Loved this idea and video! Would definitely like to see more 👍🏻
I'd love to see more videos like this. I'm a curvy girl and it's hard to find a lot of people who do these types of videos that have similar body shape and fashion taste as me. These outfits (and all your outfits, really) give me tons of inspiration! Love it~ ♡
Louise said Oh and my home phone started ringing. I almost had a heart attack.

Unsubscribed
Thanks to everyone that didn't watch my video, you've avoided cancer!
This is why i don't watch horror movies in cinemas
fake as ahs is scarier than this comedy
No it not that scary m8
These people are so extra!
I'm so sad I had a normal audience when I saw IT (no pun intended)
If I'd paid good money to watch a film the last thing I would want is people fucking around focusing my attention away from the screen
it real reaction? this movie was boring!🤔🤔🤔🤔🤡
This was me the first time I watched it when it first came out I was jumping for everything the whole theater was screaming when the movie ended everybody started clapping
I was actually gonna get tickets to this ,but I didn't .It was an immersive screening (4d) so the people were probably more scared by the clowns coming in and out of the room ,than the actual film. (Ive watched the film I like it,it's alright)
For the people who said this movie wasn't scary. I'm just wondering what kind of horror movie that scared you the most?
this makes me not want to watch the film.
lol some of them were crying
Dumb mother fuckers acting stupid at the movies. Fuck that
Faker than a three dollar bill.
It's not that deep lol
i thought it was a good comedy...
This was in peckham na no black ppl
i would say: mission completed my dear film makers.
sav and bert in the audience 0:20
It doesn't smell like caca to me senior
im not trying to be a bigman or anything but we found this film wayy funnier than scary
I seen the original so I'm good but thanks!
Only thing to scream about are the balloons 🎈 blocking the views
Should of got someone dressed as a clown and enter the cinema.
Who the fuck would want to watch it with that bunch
Wow and in my cinema viewing people were laughing their butt off to it, some even were making out to it. I found the movie to be more comedic then horror I don't think I jumped once
Bunch of pussies, I watched it. It wasnt that scary :/ sure there were a few jump scares but it wasn't terrifying as that video exaggerates so much
Personally, I would of hated being in the same screen as these people. But it sure is immersive, which may or may not add to the fear factor.
Why on earth are people arguing over whether this film was scary? \nHorror is subjective, what someone may find fearful, someone else won’t. I was bought Freddy Kruger movies by my (much) older brothers at the age of 8 for Christmas as a ‘joke’ (1994), the joke backfired when I fell in love with them (& have since been a huge horror film fanatic since - although for some reason I drew the line at Candy Man, petrified of that film until late teens / early 20’s).\nHowever, my friends & I have watched some of the worst horror films in theatres, but have made ourselves jump from feeding off of each other’s tension. \nA film doesn’t have to be ‘scary’ to put you on edge, jump scares can be enough to put anyone on the edge of their seat. The original paranormal activity storyline wasn’t the greatest, but it was the consistent jump scares that pulled the audience in & got the heart racing.\nLet’s just be respectful of others opinions on films overall, they’re put here for our entertainment, much like music, tastes differ.
if i went to the pictures to see a movie and the crowd acted like this whether they are scared or hysterically laughing. they would all be kicked out. I thought it said peckham at the start. It would of been scarier outside the complex then inside wiatching a horror
WTF kind of Cinema is that... looks more like a uni class or something.
HOW IS THE MOVIE IT SCARY ???????? IT WASNT SCARY MY LITTEL MY SAID it wasn't scawry  oh my God
They knew they were being filmed.
It was really good film but its more a thriller than a horror
Stephen King is an old SJW pedophile piece of shit.
this would be the most annoying thing in the world to do, watch a movie while some pussies around u r screaming
It was so scary my face fell off no joke I'm being honest here no sarcasmness I promise.
There was a clown walking around scaring people
Never better the original film
The movie wasn't scary true I'm  17 but it really wasn't scary. I have seen scarier movies than it.
What a pile of crap thus film is
https://youtu.be/COfKul9TMEY\n\nThe REAL story that inspired IT\nMust watch: frightening!!
I wanna know how scary that movie. Gonna watch it alone 😏
This movie is amazing and kinda scary but not that movie will make you scream or cover your eyes i can tell this is fake\n\nIm 17 btw
Shit, those are some good actors!
It wasn't that scary
RELAX IT WASNT THAT SCARY, JUMPING FROM SEATS?!! WTF IF THAT HAPPENED NEAR ME ILL SLAP THEM THE FUCK DOWN
I can't believe I spent £11 to see this 💩. Imagine how much Cadbury Oreo chocolate I could've bought
I work i say the movie was not even scary but at home i check all the rooms for clowns
Me and my friend watch it in 4dx and everyone including us where laughing it's not scary at all
I wasn't even watching the reactions. I was freaking out at Bertie Gilbert and Savannah Brown in it
I cant go with a Woman to a Cinema its Not possible they Scream like they die
Was there a clown jumping out at people or something?
Hate yhe people who are saying this movie relied on cheap jumps scares because clearly they haven't seen the movie.
It is not scary, but it's so much fun and very entertaining. It's far from bad, I watched it twice , I love the way Pennywise talk and act also the losers club especially Richie, he got all the great lines...
It wasn’t scary for me because I’ve watched so many memes
The reaction is so fake
What movie were they watching? Cause the IT I saw was the weakest shit ever.
I'm guessing this was in the US...
I’d be hella mad and get a refund If people at the theatre screamed,I paid for a movie  not a bunch of people screaming
The only parts I really found “scary”, I guess you could say, was when Pennywise popped up on the screen out of nowhere tbh. He was mostly creepy to me. And the kids were fucking hilarious, especially Richie. 😂 it was a good movie, though.
Am I the only person who thinks this would be so fucking fun
Who the fuck acts like that in cinemas, that would be a horrible viewing experience
The movie was totally a waste of my time and money.
What’s wrong with these people?
this film wasnt scary but if a clown were there it will be more scary
У нас в России угорают только.
хыяры ,европейцы нежинки ,очкуют клоунов ,для меня это скучная комедия ,чисто пошел по фану ,ожидал что страшнее ,одним словом гавно
Movie wasnt that scary to warrant absolute spastic orangutan calls in the cinema jesus
It's really not that scary...
Do they really need to hired actors for this?
Pussyas
ХВвахвхвхававхавххв ниче так0)
Why does pennywise sound like Scooby Doo? 😳
wat a bunch of fucking pussies

Nope, not staged at all.

Thank You Jimmy Kimmel for talking about this incredibly important topic. This republican senate bill is very cruel!
all the people telling stick to your job, Jimmy you aren't a politician are the same people who voted for this assclown trump. He should have stuck to his job laundering Russian money through his real-estate company cause he exposed it by becoming president. Also, jimmy has his own show that he can talk about whatever he wants on it. if he wants to use that platform to enlighten his viewers and fight a horrible healhcare law then thats his choice. you don't like it, boohoo, don't watch.
I know what happened to Bill Cassidy. I remember watching this documentary with Mary Elizabeth Winstead in it where these alien bugs were lobotomizing politicians. It was called BrainDead, until the people in charge of the show were also taken over by the alien bugs and cancelled the show! It's the only thing that explains Covfefe, the Bowling Green massacre, Nambia, Ben Carson, etc. Somebody call Mary Elizabeth!
Dear Politicians,\nMedicare for all, Please.\nSincerely,\nThe majority of Americans  (Both Republicans and Democrats)
Glad Kimmel brought this to the light  TY Jimmy
Good for you jimmy
Thank you Jimmy Kimmel for standing up and making noise.
USA the greatest country on earth has unlimited funds for weapons and goes to war to for no good reason... refuses to fund healthcare for its own people.
Will Do Jimmy! Thank you! God Bless!
Thank you for standing up for Americans, since our government certainly does not. I appreciate it. =)
Big ups to Jimmy for calling out this fraud!
as a citizen of Louisiana I apologize for this man
Good for you Jimmy
I love you Jimmy. You have said the only real true in this debate. I respect you. I share your feelings and admire  your courage.
This man may not be the funniest Live TV host, but he’s to be admired for using his platform to fight for affordable healthcare.
Thank you for using your voice and podium for this very important and frightening issue.
I don’t understand any of this but I somehow feel better for living in Canada
GOP (and all too often DNC) politicians get these bills out of think-tanks and listen to advisors and lobbyists who tell them how to put a good spin on them.  Thank god for Americans like Jimmy who are willing to stand up and say, ENOUGH!!  Start representing the people again.
Why are we the only major country in the world who doesn't provide healthcare for all? We should all be ashamed how selfish we have all been. What ever happened too Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses?
Looks like this Bill should be recalled.
Jimmy - you should propose single-payer health care live on your show. I'm sure that would piss them off further and get the democrats to do what their constituents want, too. Many thanks.
Lying GOP fraks doing what they do best, screwing the American People. Go Jimmy!
Republicans did everything they could to get one thing changed in Obamacare and that change represents what the Republican party is all about. A provision in the Affordable healthcare act (ObamaCare for you republicans) said that insurance companies must spend 70% of the money coming from policyholders on the policyholders. Imagine that spending the money on those that pay for it. Insurance companies hated it and so they put lots of money and energy getting Republicans to fight it. Republicans nearly destroyed America's credit rating over it, by not agreeing to increase the debt ceiling, but like all of the nooses that Republicans held to Americans necks, it failed. \nOne thing I'd like to see is people from other countries who have universal healthcare come forward and tell us the truth of what that system is like. We only know what they tell us and the old you will die waiting for your doctor is what we know here.
Sort it out America, I live in the UK and no matter what happens to you ya get FREE health care
glad I live in England rn
Mr. Kimmel, my thoughts are with you, your wife, your son and all your loved ones. I can't imagine having a sick child.
My question is: do Americans have to pay car insurance? I mean like if every car on the road can drive only if it has insurance?\nI suppose answer is yes. So isn't it totally crazy that every car has to but people don't have to? Health insurance can't be a choice it has to be duty.\nAnd how can surgery cost hundreds of thousands? It sounds to me same crazy like when Mike Tyson said that he paid 8k a week for towels. I better stop here because I would write elaborate about this nonsense.
I would really like to move countries. Starting a search, the American dream is only if you’re a politician.
Wow its not entirely Trump hysteria... oh, wait.
Thankyou for standing for us all! ! You really explained this issue. You were so clear! Im so tired of the outright lying!
Jimmy we are very Lucky to have a decent late night host that cares enough to speak out about the government that is trying to push an unexceptionable health care bill by any means possible.  It's to darn bad we can't cut their salaries down to match their integrity
Jimmy sucks this is why conan is the best talk show host right now  and always
I did it jimmy
Jimmy Kimmel is a sales man for the socialist democrats agenda.
So much respect for him now
Man i feel for Americans who need treatments and health care - i dint know how yas do it.\nMy daughter less then a year ago was rushed to hospital, then air lifted to another hospital where she spent a month in a coma on life support and hemorraghing blood from her lungs. \nThat led to a diagnosis of a very rare life threatening autoimmune disease.\nIf we, as Canadians didnt have universal health care, i don't know what we would have done.  It would have been hundreds and hundreds of thousands in medical bills. We do have long waits to see specialists (unless its urgent) and prescriptions are always covered, but thats nothing compared to be able to get into a hospital and get treated without the stress of how youre going to pay for it.  Or going to your family dr for something like an ingrown toenail and not having to pay a cent.  \nMind you, my daughters treatments (infusion meds) are not covered and they are going to cost us $12,000 per infusion - but thats something we can figure out.  We'd be homeless if we had to pay her hospital bill thats for sure.
I am grateful to live in Canada
I love Jimmy Kimmel talking about the health care issue bc for the first time in a while a politicians' word (in this case senator Cassidy) is being held accountable publicly.  Normally, politicians lie all the time and they are so powerful that people are afraid to call them on it.  So, good for you Jimmy Kimmel for standing for what is right for tens of thousands if not millions of American families who have children or a family member with a pre-existing condition. \n\nI think the first ones to go without health care should be senators, congress people, their families, interns, and those who work for them.
I'm in Maine, so I'll give Susan Collins office a call tomorrow. I was born with multiple birth defects and had over one million dollars of surgery in six months, but was paid for since my mom was working for City Hall back then. Sadly, there are many parents and children in the same situation as me who don't have that option and could lose their homes due to saving their own child. Wish me luck Kimmel fans on calling Susan Collins!!! :)
Many countries have figured health insurance out, but not the US--because of people like this senator. \n\nTaiwan, for 20 years now, has had single-payer (the government) universal health care insurance that covers everything: medical, vision, dental, and, yes, preexising conditions. And all the benefits are available at a reasonable price, which is about US$30 a month a person, and the most a family pays is for 4 persons (US$120 a month), even if they have 3 kids or 12 kids.\n\nCall your Congressmen or Congresswomen.
The US Senate\nGraham-Cassidy Bill\n202-224-3121\nCall often call daily\nYour two Senators\n\nEvery person has 2 Senators to call.
Thank you Jimmy.\nIt's amazing, I watch comedic shows like yours, Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert most of all for HONEST political messages.\nAnd it's the only sources I TRUST.\nRESPECT!
Stay with it, Jimmy! YOU are really helping the rest of us!
Awesome Jimmy we have to call now...
Huh, so a politician lied to your face about being on your side. How about that.
I called.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Jimmy.
I'm sickof these low IQ night talk show hosts talking only of politics since Trump has been elected. Where were they when Obama was around? They should stick more to their stock and trade. They are making everyone sick.  Goebbels would just proud of this deep-state propaganda war that is being obsessiveley waged. I, for one, have stopped watching them completely. And, if the Emmy awards were any indication,  much of America is tuning out as well.
Here in Japan there is a culture of admiration toward USA, how progressive and looking forward it is... but I can't believe how horrible is the health system over there, I feel very lucky to live in Japan where everything is expensive BUT! the health system has me completely covered regardless of my income and pre-existing conditions. Can't afford that fancy last generation digital gaming system and have to save for a year to get... but I can go anytime to the hospital without getting  into an impossible debt.
DID YOU CALLED ? CALL NOW
CALL 202 224 3121  TO LOCATE YOUR LOCAL SENATORS  , DON'T BE AFRAID BUT CALL  IT'S IMPORTANT OMG !  WRITE DOWN ON A PIECE OF PAPER WHAT YOU ARE PREPARED TO SAY, DON'T GET NERVOUS YOU ARE ONLY TALKING TO A POLITICIAN  NOT A REAL HUMAN BEING THEY WILL FORGET ABOUT YOU BEFORE THEY EVEN SAY GOOD BYE CALL CALL !  202-224 3121
When telling the truth is comedy gold
As a Canadian, I can personally vouch for the success of publicly funded universal healthcare. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than the terrible crap being pushed by the Republicans these days.
Yes, THANK YOU, Jimmy.  You say it all.  Today I called both of my Senators & gave my 2 cents to their clerks who answered.  The first only received a simple message of Please vote against this bill because it is not in our best interest.  When I called the second one I first received the voice mail saying it was full.  So I called back. By now I was upset. I gave this second clerk the third degree. I've had 7 BRAIN SURGERIES! If not for the ACA I would not be here.  PERIOD.
Kimmel is a joke.  He sounds like he is campaigning.  And he doesn't know didley about healthcare.  He makes enough to pay his kids medical expenses in cash.  He makes more in a week  than most people make in a lifetime.  These are people of modest incomes who have to take care of spouses and kids and try to find enough money to cover their medical programs and still pay for food and housing.  But Kimmel has more money than brains and hasn't had to balance his checkbook for a couple of decades and is way out of touch.  He's already acting and sounding like a liberal politician.  If everyone in Washington, D.C. had to be covered in any health plan, they would damn sure come up with a good one.
Hii all fit's ❤❤ welcome to m'y channel i have à best Compilation of fitness Idea or worckout tutorial for Body routine 💪❤❤
I can feel you all the way , your voice  say it all. I am worried too. Just pray to God ALMIGHTY he dont care how many HUMANS are inhabited this   earth.  He will heal all . He PROMISE
I wish I had someone like Jimmy as my Dad. But I still love my Dad
Ya Jimmy!!!!! Thanks for speaking up on so many people's behalf who don't have the platform to do so.
republicans are like student dress codes.
So why doesn't Kimmel bring up Bernie's medicare for all bill to give it some publicity?
I know a lot of people have phone anxiety. To those people I say, call at night! No one will pick up, and you can leave a voice mail. That's what I did! You don't even have to include your name. This is an issue that will affect you whether you like it or not. Voice your opinion before it's too late to change anything.
To be quite frank, People in America and a certain small minority of them, only give a sht about themselves and don't care about anyone else. You dont' live in a gated community, nobody gives a sht about ya. It's about me me me and that's the American way. We have built a society of Narcassissts like you wouldn't believe.
Jimmy Kimmel on Bill Cassidy’s Health “Dont Care how much you pay in Democrat States” Bill
Tired of winning yet hillbillies? At least you'll be the first to die.
Did someone hit Bill Cassidy in the face with a shovel?\n\nThe curvy kind, not the flat one.
I have never understood how you can monetise healthcare, something that is essential for your wellbeing. And the people that argue against healthcare for all, you realise that in order to drive your car on the road,  you are required to have insurance, right? And premiums are based on EVERYONE on the road so the good drivers are effectively paying for the bad drivers? If you don't argue against that, then why shouldn't you want healthcare for all?
Thank you Jimmy for breaking it down. Everyone write/call your senators and tell them to vote this bad bill down!
Thank you for putting that number on there, that made it easy to call and raise my views about how terrible the Cassidy-Graham bill is, thank for encouraging participation in this fight.
It amaze me how each healthcare republicans try to past, they were worst then the one before. Really show who they are actually try to help
the worst part is, donald trump went to france and saw their military parade, so now he wants one for the u.s. - not sure if everybody knows this but military parades cost money, ALOT of money. so apparently theres no money for healthcare or education, but when donnie boy wants to see his toys on display the government can just cough up a couple of millions... wtf
Jimmy Kimmel is great for America, doing a better job of holding Congress accountable than many in the media. . Especially fox . .  Errr fake news.
Yup LMAO, lying straight to his face
Ma nigga
Thats right
Nice
Medicare for ALL
Cassidy's bill = Genocide
Jimmy Kimmel for president 2020
RIP USA
Term limits!!!!
Ty Jimmy Kimmel
Yeap
F;;;ing Republicants again!
Thank you!
You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, and your premiums will go down. Sounds like Obama couldn't pass the Jimmy Kimmel test in the first place
you need to debate this with Ben Shapiro. You will be better informed.
Listen to your own voices Americans!  Don't put another Dumb Trump in your living rooms.
I feel like not enough information was given
Bernie 2020!
Higher taxes going to healthcare, senior citizen care, child care, education and enviroment = good. Love, a happy Norwegian.
Right now 4 democratic states that make up 20% of the U.S. population(California, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland) get 40% of Obama care dollars. The other 46 states have to share 60% of the remaining dollars. How does Jimmy Kimmel believe that the rest of the country funding California's Socialist experiment is fair?
I can't believe people would listen to a dancing monkey who makes millions. Cause THIS guy knows what's best for you while he chills in his Hollywood hills mansion. Also all this information he's spouting out was given to him by his supervisors, he's an actor who know nothing about bill making or law.
Remember this isn't Democratic propaganda crap it's a comedy show
Jimmy Kimmel -  Coward and despicable father for using his son as a stage prop allowing himself to be used as front man for the lefts efforts to keep Obamacrap - Man up and debate in person with the good man that sponsored the bill.  His many years of  caring as an MD for poor folks make him infinitely more qualified to speak for the integrity of the proposed bill.
The entertainment industry should stop preaching morals and politics. People, do your own research and read a variety of information sources and stop letting celebrities do your thinking for you.  This man is not an expert on health care just because he has a sick child. I empathize with him as a parent but please get off the political platform.
Father in law had to come up with a 7k co-pay to have a stint put in his artery. That's the reality of Obama care. Pay up or die. They refused him the day he was scheduled. Hollywood needs to keep their political opinions to themselves. Yet another I will never watch again.
Insurance should have every right to charge more for a pre existing condition. You can't just get sick then decide now you should get insurance. You can't crash a car then get insurance and have them pay for it. And every wants to bring up all these other countries. Talk to some of the people in those countries because they have excessively long waiting lists to get care and it doesn't work.
There is literally not one country on earth that passed Jimmie Kimmel's test.  Not one. Obama Care doesn't, either.  He's crying that his mental image of perfection doesn't match reality.  That's childish, magical thinking.\n\nThat hospital that his daughter got surgery at doesn't have a price barrier. If a poor, illegal immigrant took their kids there, they would have gotten the same treatment.  No country with socialized medicine would've made that possible.
I want the same ratings as Colbert!\n\nA politician lied to another human being.  Stop the presses.
Love the new political activist format. Sure it doesn't get any laughs but that's not what Jimmy is there for. He's there to make democrats look like saviors.
YOU'RE MY NUMBER ONE GIRL CRUSH TOO! Xx
Awww you are so sweet xx  Loved meeting you both and real talking about home births and YouTube stories :)
Serial commenting (sorry, did yesterday too!) But it's so refreshing to see how supportive you are of the girls you met.  You and Anna are so blooming lovely, could imagine having a good natter with you both over cocktails!
Such an amazing trip with Bobbi Brown and meeting some amazing people.  Her lipsticks look so beautiful.  Your Alice-Olivia dress is gorgeous.  Love NY and seeing it through your eyes make me love it even more.  Thanks for sharing your trip with us.     #crushingonyouandAnna
3 day trip to NY, cashmere sweaters, books, cookery classes and other expensive gifts just for a lipstick. A lipstick.  Isn't it all a bit vulgar? I understand your job is going on these trips to promote a product but it makes me think less of Bobbi Brown as a company and I wouldn't purchase their products.  \nMaybe I should direct this at Bobbi Brown and not you but incase they are reading....
I wanted to say that your video is awesome and I love everything you do. Also, for all the people who reads this, Mexico needs your help. Yesterday occurred a disaster that affected places such as Mexico City and Morelos. Institutions like Cruz Roja Mexicana is helping those people who are in need. Please donate whatever you like or try to help people. Mexico needs your help. #FuerzaMéxico #Méxicoestádepie
OMG loved this vlog!! (You didn't seriously cut your pasta with a fork and knife?! Italian viewer here 🙋🏽lol). Apart from that, it was lovely!
Lily... YOU HAVE TO STOP with the whole '...I'm not as cool them'... because you are! You are so cool and unique and so beautiful! :)
New York is my dream!!! You are so lucky!!! But Lily please don't cut pasta!!! ahahaha xoxo from Italy
You are the awesomest! so I really really really hope you don't mind me mentioning this, it's just a New Yorker thing: the Brooklyn Bridge WAS in one of your shots - and it was for sure super-close - but as I think you probably know, that thing you pointed the camera at when you said you were at the Brooklyn Bridge...wasn't. I mean - you could see it, I'm sure, but we just saw a totally different bridge. (The one the neighborhood is named after.) But anyways...sorry! carry on! fab vlog as always :) I'm always psyched when you guys visit...
it seems so cool to be a blogger!!
Bobbi Brown tests on animals...so not really interesting for me :/
Oh my goodness. Jenna Lyons!!! She revitalized J Crew. I wish she was still with them.
I don't think homely means what you think it means lol
Had my daughter's bat mitzvah at that hotel. It's a wonderful, little gem here!
ah Lily!! you always make me smile!!!
Your hair looks STUNNING in this video! Xx
Of course Anna is your girl crush, and the two of you are my girl crushes!
I've been looking forward to this vlog! Times have been hard lately for me but watching you, and Anna, and your honest and real friendship/adventures gives me so much joy. I want you to know that ❤️✌🏼
Loved the vlog! X
NICE!!
That outfit is gorgeous 😍❤️
Loooooove this vlog Lily! can't wait to check the lipsticks out!
Well, I was girl crushing on both you and Anna the entire vlog! X
Yes Lily, it's Ganni like you said it, at least that's how we pronounce it here in Denmark. It's a Danish family-owned brand ;-)
Love watching yours and Anna's trips together! I think my fantasy New York to-do list is just yours and Anna's recs!
This is such a lovely video and inspiring in a way. The theme behind the brand is amazing and the fact that it leans towards empowering women and encouraging us to find other women to admire is a beautiful thing. I hope to hear more about the lipsticks, maybe you can do an updated video for fall lipsticks or moisturising lipsticks since going towards winter our lips get more drying, at least mine do. It becomes almost impossible for me to wear matte lipsticks, it looks like my lips are falling apart and I tried so many chapsticks, now I settled for Burt's Bees, the vanilla flavoured one and it's pretty good if anybody has dry lips.
Jane's carousel! I'm sure it's the oldest in the world or something similar! I got a tattoo of it to remind me of my fave city.
This is such a great vlog Lily, the ad content is tastefully done and I loved that dress on you!
Awesome topic for a trip!
Loved this video!
2:50  Wow, that index finger!... It's soo long!  ˆ◡ˆ
Lily - Oreos was making pop-rock oreos! You would love them if you love popping candy!
Soirée means Evening in French but we also use it to say 'evening party' like 'I'm going to a soirée tonight'
You can really tell when you do ads with brands that you work together to make it very much like your own content.. Really love it! 😊
Soooooooo nice! One more week and than I'm off to the big apple! 😚
I love those vlogs Lily x Anna & you are the ultimate babes <3
Loved,loved this vlog Lily. lovely to see someone so humble and say how lucky they are. Going to re-watch this again for all the good vibes it gives. Well done x.
Cheers Lily!  Your day in Brooklyn is my next date day with my hubbie!  You need to grab the new East River NYCferry next time you are here.  $2.75 a trip and great way to see the city.
Love the music in this one, Lily! xx
I was in Dumbo just last week by the bridge and carousel and it truly was gorgeous...and peaceful! What a dream trip and the candy floss matches your Alice + Olivia dress 💕
What a seriously enjoyable vlog to watch, such a great mix of clips and the 'AD' part was well integrated and natural. Anyone that has followed you for a while known your love for Bobbi Brown and that makes it even more genuine. Adore the Alice and Olivia dress!! x
I loved this vlog so much! NYC is my favourite, and it was so nice seeing women supporting women 🤗 looked like a super fun trip!
Great city
Your hair looks amazing ❤️
The editing on this was so goooood! And the music choices too! 💕
So cool Jenna Lyons was there! I love Cat Bird, just got my wedding band from them ❤
So the Brooklyn bridge is the brown one that you briefly shot on the left. The one you are in front of for most of the time is the Manhattan bridge.
Just a heads up about your dress! I have the same A+O dress and the fabric is gorgeous but so delicate. I unfortunately had to exchange my first dress because it started to shred around the arm hole/fray. It's beautiful  but I don't want you to have the same issue I did!
i loveeeeeee geneva, she's so talented and she lives in hong kongggg!
Geneva, from A Pair and A Spare was one of the first fashion blogs I read. Her DIYs are awesome and she has great style.
Awesome VLog Lily...love it!!!
Beautiful vlog :D

You, Anna, and Eva are my 3 favorite bloggers/youtubers! So glad to see you combined :)
You and Anna have the cutest friendship, I need a friend like that lol
Lily sitting down on the floor at the start of this vlog reminds me of her old videos 😊
Brooklyn Bridge is the brown one, the blue metal one is the Manhattan Bridge. x
Lovely vlog Lily! :-)\nImmediately knew I had seen that Carousel before in Glee - Lols :-D Here is the clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb9DGhpxnN0
Definitely want to check out Lilia! Looks so good!
I'm not a lipstick girl but these sound amazing. I'd actually try them.
 You are one of my favorite bloggers and as an amateur musical theatre actress NYC is one of  my favorite cities. Thanks for sharing your time here with sweet Anna
what is the name of the first song? x
Lily, love the way you do Ad's! I dont even habe the feeling you are doing any Ad's bäm in your face 😊😘
You and anna have such a beautiful friendship ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you both!!!
You two are my girl crush! Love both of you! xox
I love Anna's hair up like that
Lovely lip colours, but really loving the sparkly candy floss...so hungry right now....Sugarrrrrrr!
Oh that dress is worth the splurge <3 Loved this vlog !!
Hi Lily! Love the video! It was really wonderful to meet you on that lovely De Maria evening. I was wondering if you could give me credit for the illustrations. My handle is @pauline_de_roussy_de_sales \nThank you!\nBe Well\nxo\nPauline
You are amazing lily ❤️❤️❤️
I spy Jenna Lyons! 😍
Where are the lipstick lids😮😮😮
Ahahahaha pasta baby. Bloody love Anna 😂😂
Love your NY vlogs & Love seeing you and Anna together! www.byharrison.com
That cookbook looks lush. Really loved this vlog, Lily. I love how your channel is really evolving and changing right now. X
Oh coooool! I totally understand that you loved @madametamtam. She is definitely one of my favorite German YouTubers. Such a stunning lady!
Such a beautiful vlog! I'm really loving your content lately lily 💓
Loved this, Lily! PS All the illustrations got me wondering if you've kept up with your calligraphy...
So wonderful seeing you so happy!! Love when you & Anna are together! Great video!
love,love this episode...
Awwww I just love your vlogs lily ❤️😘
makes me really want to go to NY :)
Fantastic vlog. 😁
What a lovely, lovely vlog.
The quality of your vlogs just keeps getting better, Lily!
It`so weird, that Bobbi Brown is now without Bobbi herself!  But they tell stories about her girl crushes. I think she left her own brand not for a good reason.\nSuch a nice trip any way and nice vlog, like always, Lily!
Jasmin is one of my favorite German youtubers 😍
wait,the bridge Lily mentions at 5.18 is manhattan bridge not brooklyn bridge right??
The straight person's concept of girlcrush is confusing to me, as someone who legitimately has crushes on girls lmao
Lily, I probably missed you saying when the lipsticks are gonna launching. But can u let me know when it's launching. Thanks dear xx
I love this dress on you, please continue to wear it haha! And this trip looked so much fun, especially the meeting Jenna Lyons part
OMGGGG I've been waiting for this video all day!! Haha I love watching your vlogs 😉
when will eveythingapplepro do the drop test
I need a drop test for the 8 Plus as soon as possible! Will be getting mine today and I have to know how durable the „most-durable glass on a smartphone ever” really is!
anyopne else have force touch lag on ios 11 on iphone 7 / iphone 7+ or any other model?
nothing special on iPhone right now, anyway, great review.
Does it bend and how fast can you destroy it is it bullet proof
Look almost the same.... I love my ipad but   am not gonna spend another 1000 dollars for the same design .... Hahahaa
Your lighting is actually fantastic. Brownlee tried to portray the difference in color of the 8 Plus box but was unable to. I have one of these arriving tomorrow - happy see the real color. He even said his lighting was, and I quote, On point  - so you're doing good.
Now I'm just waiting for someone to destroy it and making it 10 min long and upload it to youtube
Is there really any difference between iPhone 7+ and 8??
So we wait for a year for iPhone 8 to come out and Apple just slams a glass at the back and says here you go, iPhone 8 wtf apple we're just paying for the same shit over and over again.
So I have no reason to change my iPhone 7 Plus.
What the fuck is the difference
Only difference basically is wireless charging 🤔. Think I’ll wait for iPhone x
The new iPhone 8 comes out and I just got my 6 Plus 😂😢
Great channel. That awesome to see your home town on YouTube. (Wenatchee)
Can't wait for the iPhone 9. (Sarcasm).
The best color for any phone ever 😍😍😍😍😍
If you don’t like it don’t buy it shut the fuck up omg
Please someone inform Apple to bring back the old keyboard before iOS 11; they removed the forward/backward keys I depended on when typing. Using the “bubble” isn’t fast for me. Also, the old keyboard looked like the one on a computer, very complete. You didn’t need a second step to access . & ,. I called Apple and they had no clue of what I was talking about.
they should have called it the 7s not the 8, because they look exactly the same
Hi will the I phone 7 plus cases will fit ? In the 8 plus
Is the iPhone 8 out yet?
Definitely going to get the 8 Plus. Id rather pay for that than waste $1000 on the X.
MY S8 PLUS 6GB PHONE IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE WORLD . HIT LIKE IF YOU HAVE S8 PLUS .
I'm sorry but the iPhone 8 was almost no different from the 7. Literally identical.
Surely you did, but you said you couldn't get portrait mode working. Did you by chance go farther away like it said to lol?
SOMEONE STOLE YOUR VIDEO!! PLEASE ADD SOME SORT OF WATERMARK FOR YOUR VIDEOS        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWr6EjmXc0k
Guys im gonna wait for iphone x but im super worried abut the battery life. I have iphone 7plus and being that the iphone will have smaller battery i was wandering is it gonna reduce the battery life a lot taking in consideration that a11 bionic chip suppose to be super efficient?
That's the iPhone 7s
I have a question is this really worth the upgrade from the iphone 6 plus,also do apple trade in iphone 6 plus to get money off the new phone thanks
How come I don’t have iOS low battery mode on iOS 11.0
Traditionary? That's new.
Francisco Costa Changing app on your screen is very laggy and slow(iOS 11)
Why is there no plastic packaging on the iphone when you unbox it?
I will be waiting for a Apple TV..........
Glory of apple went off with Steve jobs itself
Colors are ugly this time.
Guys check out channel with the actual Apple IPhone 8+ review
wow u dont lose time, when something new comes
It's literally the same as the 7 Plus ohd😂😂
IT'S THE SAME SHIT!
Lmao that bitch just got a glass on it
Is the home button still the same as the iPhone 7 and 7 plus it looks like it clicks
Who's watching this video with a android
Does it still have 3D touch?
aboot? Unsubbing. I can't support the maple syrup regime.
will the back scratch easy
First 40 subscribers will have a chance of winning beats solo wireless 2
guys i have no idea why people say their pictures are gonna be nice cause of camera eventhough the camera doesn't matter its the person who pictures it
Iphone is bullshit! In a real sense of word ! Welcome 2015!!!!!!!!!
Gonna be honest,\n\n\n\n\nThey are the same fucking thing.
Apple is 4 years since 2013 they still selling 1 phone 4 Different name \nIt’s was 2013 iPhone 6 just change to 6s same shit that 6>6s to 7 same shit now i6/6s/7 to 8 & 8 plus is that 6 plus was 2013 just change the camera all of that same shit \n\nThey just colouring the Donkey and selling like Horse 😆😁😆 Samsung ever year they change something cool
If you reply to me I will give you $100000000000000
where do you get all these phones
no lie STEVE JOBS would have made a killer phone for us if he was stilll here RIP
Just give me my damn head phone jack -.-
Taking a picture of an Apple on a Apple Phone
I'll stick with my iPhone 6s Plus and I won't be updating to IOS11 since Apple will ruin older phones in an attempt to force people to upgrade (read the article written by the Harvard University student). The 2675mah battery in the iPhone 8 is laughable. The 6s Plus (which is 2 generations older) has a stronger battery. Everyone knows the hardware in these phones is capable of lasting 10 years - phone software is very easy to run. It's the corrupt business practice of panned obsolescence which destroys our phones early through carefully designed software updates, specifically created to break older phones. The industry needs tighter regulation.
def should have had the old gold too
are you filming this in t mobile?
lol same shit,  I'm really feel sorry for iPhone user , but wait maybe next year's iPhone will launch edge  screen !!! that will be so unique!!! opp samsung did 3 year ago I do sorry 😔😔😔😔😔😔😔
tfw the iphone is now big enough to put the 3.5mm jack back in but they are salty and dont want to lose money
The iPhone 8 looks like a fake of the 7 😂😂😂wth
I'm still on my iPhone 5s so I know I'll be getting the iPhone 8 plus so this would be a big change for me. Just hope the glass back is more durable than the iPhone 4 version and won't break/shatter easily when drop
I know everyone can agree WERE IS THE HEADPHONE JACK.
Can you do a 8 plus vs 8? I have a 7 plus but I might get the regular 8 this time because it's easier to use Bc my hands aren't the biggest
Why they skip 9 and go to ten?
Does the iPhone 8 normal come in gold. Please answer i have to know by tomorrow
When does the 8plus ship, I preordered mine and was wondering?
I feel like bezels have their advantages in some aspects of use.
You need a microphone.
Ayy his friend works at T-Mobile
HA the competition
My mom iPhone 8 plus coming in tomorrow
iPhone 7 looks better 😂😂😂
Lol #bringbacktheflipphone
Move fucking farther away!!
🤔🤔🤔
Yay more glass to break
It the same /😕\
Trash. Apple is robbing its customers blindly
make money here https://goo.gl/YUWtPk
H
I love apple
Unbox the space grey man....
cool
iphone 3gs but with upgrades = iphone 8
Omg
this nigga recorded this shit in a tmobile store lmao
Wasted money on iPhone 8 bought it yesterday RATHER THAN buying it on Black Friday crap
Apple must think we're dumb 🙄😒 I'm waiting on iPhone X 🤷🏽‍♀️
I say it's bullshiiiieeet
EverythingApplePro the type of nigga to jizz his fucking pants every time he eat an apple 🙄
congratulations on #22 on trending and 1.5 million  views.
If you pause the video when both are on screen, you can play a fun game by asking people if they can tell which one is the 7 and which one is the 8.
Is portrait mode available on iphone 7
I live in Wenatchee Washington
How much do apple pay this cunt
Case test pls!!!
Ah-boot ??? Lol 😂
4:03 for those who came for Kevin Hart...
What is this utter cancer
Wendy your boobs are touching your legs? Why you talking smack about others???
What's up with her cheeks? Bad job fillers?
Love wendy but way over forgiving towards men who are disloyal
I think Wendy is wrong about everything .
Wendy you have lost all your weight and look fabulous. Time to get a reduction.
Kevin Hart probably didn't use protection then they get mad because they end up with HIV, HERPES among many others. Disgusting Kevin Hart!
This dude, Wendy, is a trip. When we gonna get to see him out of drag?
His has a track record of cheating so what do you expect
There is a new judgement being made every 10 seconds. This woman doesnt seem like a very nice person
She definitely needs to work on her flow when doing these shows... it's almost painful to watch...
Wendy Williams is a parasite
But mom does need a new gucci bag lmfaooo I love this show
When did Suzanne come back
Wendy what u mean rapping not a real talent ohhh I hear that shade 😎😎😎😏😎
That interview was filmed about  month ago so it was just a coincidence that it was posted to the public in the midst of this scandal !
Those women are discusting they should be damn well ashamed of themselves
Sum1 in his camp cld hv tried to set him up    to steall Eniko frm orrrr Eniko cld hv paid sum1 to do it in order to get out the 1 year marriage with 1/2 of his worth.
I'm offended at  not a real talent  maybe the rappers of today's time u can't tell me jay z NAS biggie 2 PAC big pun rakim lil Kim missy E etc are and were not talented -___-
Im on that side of youtube again arnt i
The Inside Edition was recorded before the new new side piece stuff came out it's just when all the new stuff came out that's when they posted the interview.
Maria is not a dancer, that's all she do is walk, and stand there and look pretty.
Wendy's audience are such lambs. They clap and don't even know why.
The 1st 2 minutes of this show was just people screaming. Why is that a thing
WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS CHICKS FACE, WTF IS WRONG WITH HER BODY ASWELL
Was sap with her face the cheek bone popping out that can't be nice
This looks like the worst programme in the world
Wendy Williams makes her money off other people's misury and pain.....
Luv Wendy 4eva! But gotta say as a child of divorce due to infidelity I really enjoyed the interview with Inside Edition. I thought was Hart's ex said was relevant.
Sounds like she throwing shade to Kevin with the amount of money did they actually meet on 4/20 🤔 That isn't a random number that's a secret shot
Actually, women who have been abused usually drop the charges...

HIV is real, Maybe Torrie wanted a little payback by being on tv voicing her opinion his now wife contributed to the end of her marriage it's nothing what they did to her
I lost respect for Kevin when he left  the first wife who was with him when he had nothing. It wasn't so much that they broke up, but the cheating and how he spoke about her.
What?! Hell no! Hold up! Huh? Ok
This cow calls herself a woman
Subscribe to my channel.
I bet if half u ppl live in these famous ppls shoes u will walk the same
This whole episode is about hoes and money
Torrei ain't getting checks. The kids live with him.
Wendy Williams has nothing better to do than trash Mariah Carey. You are just mad because after 9 years, she still will not go on your show.
Good for publicity... What people will do to be seen... Then when the camera come out they are crying.... Stop sharing your life's in the media ....😢😢
Is Wendy a real Woman or a transgender?
Thus really sucks I really like kevinhart
Wendy getting that syndication money?
👍🏾
This Broads face is WRECKED!!
4:41 shady cameraman is back
Karma is a B*TCH!!!! 😂😂😂😂 👏👏👏👏
I ❤️ Chyna
its sad black men cheat with lighter skinned wmn
Wendy really needs to deflated them overblown balloons down some. LOL
Clickbait
https://youtu.be/K25qcvkeLGk
https://www.gofundme.com/2zujbq-please-help-me-buy-a-car
can someone pop those plastic bubble cheeks please
This a dude?
>skip 60 seconds\n>still applause\n\nFucking American TV
Wendy wishes she was Mariah.
Omg no amount of money will changed Tokyo's ugly face...
The interview was done before Kevin's cheating arose. Check your facts Wendy and team. #TeamTorrei
Who still goes to Wendy for the tea on celebrity news? I feel like she is so late on so many things I just watch her every now and then on topics I know she will give a funny response.
Post-riches... Kevin Hart has a type. Stripper and wife resemble. His first wife may have been right about how you acquire that exotic taste once you get that guwap!
4:26 the woman on the very right hahahahahahaha! The disgust was real 😂😂😂😂
I don't feel sorry for none of them. Because the truth is you loose them how you get them. And how the hell do you cheat on someone properly? No one should be cheating on anyone. Period. Seriously Wendy.
Wendy, 420,000... ask the kids what 420 is. toke toke toke
The audience was clapping for 1:45 holy jesus i watched this video for kevin hart but i left sith brain damage
Tori wasn't wrong to out Kevin, all of this information is old, she spilled all their marriage secrets and his infidelities 3 years ago in the Exes of Atlanta, so did Usher's Ex wife, Neyo's... People in Atlanta are freaking weird!
Kevin hart can afford to cheat. I'm sure his wife has him literally paying for his mistakes
Mannn one day Females gotta learn that if u got him by cheating you will either lose him The same way or endure what his ex experienced witcho ezz! Stupid is as stupid does...
I DON'T CONDONE CHEATING BUT IF THIS NINJA IS WORTH BILLIONS I WOULD NOT LEAVE HIM HELL SHE CAN'T KNOCK NO BOOTS...
I'll bet Kevin paid her some money for sex.
Love you Wendy but what the Super P-Sation is going on in that dress?
When he had NOTHING, the Ebony woman was right there by his side.....I will NEVER trust BM to do right by their own race of women the moment they get a little success. Why should BW keep empowering them to continue to defecate on their own race of women. They hit it big and where do they go?...do they uplift, build up and glorify their own.....you know and I know that's NOT going to happen. What's your SOLUTION for that???????????????????????/!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I refuse to take my two grandsons to their barbers or support any movies, shows or any type of business BM are a part of because I already KNOW what to expect. I take my grandsons to the salon for their haircuts. I have no problem helping BW succeed because they understand the concept of LOYALTY and INTEGRITY......Of course you'll see some BW with other races of men because BM left us no choice. There is NOT a shortage of BW. So many BM are in jail - 40%, 25% are gay and 25% HATE their own race of women or/and themselves. What choice are BW left with.  What's their excuse?????? We already know the deal....It's about their penis....it's ALWAYS about their penis
Torie Hart did this interview a while ago, BEFORE Kevin Hart got caught acting a fool on his 2nd Wife. Delete this video Wendy. Your info is wrong.
He is a donkey for sure
Lie detector tests aren't really reliable.. they can easily be manipulated.
What do you call a black woman with no butt, fake hair and big boob? It isnt nature.
I hate this lady and her audience
I'm surprised Wendy is reporting this. Kevin and Wendy starred in the same movie, Think Like A Man. They were married in the movie.
Did her just get larger?  and cheek implants too!!!
two times she talked about woman just sitting back taking money form there men...smh what is this 1950
Wendy on drugs y’all know that?
Wendy built like a baby giraffe.
That top lip is heavy Wendy
Eniko is smart, trapped him for 18 years. Get that child support 💰
This video would be 4 minutes shorter if her fans didnt cheer for so long
LOVE ME SOME WENDY. SHE CAN DISH IT AND SHE CAN TAKE IT. Lol
PS WENDY STRUGGLES TO READ FROM THE PROMP WHAT A SHAME - BORING SHOW !
If you line up this nigga's exes it makes something that resembles an evolutionary chart. This fool stay upgrading.
@msmontiasabbag

Zoe I'm just scared of little fish that look weird. 😂😂😂 Best quote of the holiday. Pmsl
I feel like this wasn't just a diary of your holiday outfits but a diary of you getting more and more tan throughout the week! Looked very lovely and I loved all of your outfits! Glad you had fun :)
Those crazy colourful sandals are from a Greek brand!  Yeah
It's quite annoying how Zoe can literally pull anything off 😍😂
Skincare routine please?!
How do you get the perfect tan on holiday! I never tan :( ?
I really really really don't want to sound creepy but I wish I knew what brand Zoe's bras are just because I wish I had that kind of support! I mean the bras really make her bust look good, but that's a weird compliment to make. If somebody knows, help? Sorry for the weird comment
I just returned from Greece and I hoped so much you will upload it before I leave 😭
Love you zoe and I am proud of you because  I didn't feel like you were stressed because  of the plane or the flight 🖒🖒🖒 and you shouldn't any way

19:50 your hair and sunglasses remind me soooo much of Amber Davies from Love Island! Anyone else😂
The Nutella b ready see sold back in Wales in Asda ❤
Zoe! Idk if you will see this but for the red dress, maybe you can tie the sleeves around you or around your neck it would work?? You're pretty creative :) just an idea :) hopefully that makes you like it more
Hope you had a great holiday ❤️
*I love your vlogs so much*
31 mins of Zoe? HELL YEAH! Omgosh I’ve been waitinggggg 😍
Love that pink playsuit 😍
❤❤
Zoe uploads = drop everything
What country did u go to
could be a classic
Shane is going to beat an inch of Owens life Owens is finished in 3 weeks no place to run to place to hide 3 weeks KO You will pay for your actions I promise
for real if they dont have owens go over ina brutal dominate fashion that should put kevin back in the wwe title picture then wwe is truly dead
How much you wanna bet that they're gonna reinforce the Cell AGAIN?
Get ready for some big jump at Hell in the Cell from Shane, because his ring ability is taking a leap of faith which obviously always makes the highlight.
a terrible promo performance. no emotion behind it, was just like reading a script. way to not believe in your own product McMahons
You made Kevin do it Shane. Do to your father you made him the heel you had to put your innocent father in this and your sister Stephanie they turned out to be you Shane, just like all of these WWE Universe people they turned to be you Shane, I see Shane everywhere I go to, Every place I see Shane the Devil From the transcendent of heaven Kevin angel descending to battle the devil that is you Shane. See you in hell Shane. Shane, people like Kevin can't go to Hell no, no. They go to heaven like the good angels does.
Evil qur’aan (Proof in desc. and comments) ripping and my advice, if I am slaughtered! Like and RT\nhttps://youtu.be/szZTiavY-6A \nMany muslims are in delusion and they think they will get eternal pleasure for following falsehood!\n\nIf you are to evil to realise the evil nature of Islam there is nothing I can do! \n\nThe most powerful creator will exercise justice to those who are evil!
Jajajajjaj no entiendo
Just shame Shane can't call on the devils favourite demon the big red monster Kane to help out just a little lol
yall watch wwe? oboy
HELL IN A CEEELLL!!!
Shane always delivers something huge, puts his body out there to be destroyed, I'll never forget that summerslam jump.
what happened to his indefinite suspension
shane said in the beginning when he came to wwe that more new guys will get their chance, but they are always highlighting aj style, ko, randy. and he throws himself in every ppv matches
When the roster is so bad Shane McMahon has to return to the ring
Welcome back Shane you know it's time to bring the pain
i like you Shane and i hope u do! i just can't  stand ko.
I love shane but owens wins 😥
If Owens wins, I stop watching.
This match better be good if  not this storyline is trash.
What is Shane looking at?? There are no people in the sections of the arena he is looking at
They do this so Shane can jump off stuff
Am i the only one who got chills throughout all the time Shane was talking?Like,you can see it right in his eyes that he's not joking anymore..
Didn't he himself order people to beat down McMahon on multiple times?
Oh NOW !!! Shane decides : daddy i love now because someone attacked you and i have to care about you now ,and your going to see jump off a cell again and pretand that we have a father -son bond😌😭 .........hhhhhh dude last year you said that you wished that your not his son and you said that you are ashamed
Now I think the only think left is Chris Jericho if he returns on hell in a cell I would be so excited for the smackdown after hell in a cell I am missing Jericho and his list
how much u wanna bet shane jumps of HITC
McMahon's will strike out with massive vengeance! Ha lol you definitely do! Look what you guys did to CM punk
Who threw a pie in Kevin Owens face .....
Anyone ever thought of a KO vs HHH possibility if Shane was still suspended?
Shane was totally Jules in this segment! he's gonna murder Owens....
Come on Shane you can do it you can beat kevin\nDo it for your fans and for machman family
I though he did not like vince
Shane should bring kane back to destroy Owens
This storyline getting deserving heat\nI'm lovin it\nBay Bay
I think Chris jerrico join with Shane or triple h
That was a speechless speech my boy !
No offence Shane, but why couldn't you do anything to Stone Cold Steve Austin when he used to beat up your dad in a regular basis all those years.
Shane took an f5 from Brock and let that go but soon as aj styles or Owens do something he want to fight. What a hypercrite
Vince and Shane vs Kevin Owens WM 47 confirmed
Jump off the cell Shane
Good promo by Shane. I hope he colors up KO in Hell in the Cell.
It was good to see Shane McMahon live. I was there last night. He didn't greet the city of Oakland CA that just shows he's serious now. I can't wait for Hell In A Cell
I want to Dean Ambrose or Roman regins or Seth Rollins to fight  Shane McMahon
No Mercy on my birthday :D
Shane is too damn old for this
It's so rare that I see the crowd go silent.
They could make this way more exciting
Let Triple H do it he would beat the hell out of Kevin Owens
Undertaker pulls Shane down under the ring, Shane is gone for a few weeks with the lights going out every time Owens has a match and next ppv the corporate ministry makes its return.
Shane McMahon Vs Kevin Owens At No Mercy Do IT
It's called wwe Shane, The word wrestling is in wwe. If you didn't want your kids to see it why you let them when they already knew the script duhh
When Shane said he was going to Dem him did he mean dm
Shane gotta be one of the best guys in wwe right now\nHe always puts on a fight with great wrestlers and do an incredible job on thoose matches
Lost to undertaker lost to AJ styles y'all think about this
I can't wait...but knowing the current WWE, this match won't be all that great
Isn't it crazy that Shane has 3 sons and Stephanie has 3 daughters
They had Kevin Owens never even come out?
Smackdown is so wack compared to raw
You know the show is bad when the only way to get good ratings is to have the boss fight
What about all those times Austin and Rock beat up the McMahons?
Calling it now.. triple H will come out and pedigree Shane
Don't cross the boss!
I'm hoping this feud builds to a Daniel Bryan return... Like, Shane loses, KO continues to beat him, DB comes in to rescue, build tension for a few months as KO becomes world champion again, then DB comes back at the Royal Rumble and wins it, leading to Daniel Bryan vs. Kevin Owens at Wrestlemania.\n\nThat is, of course, if the rumors of him trying to rehab is true.
0:16 \n\nHow would that make you feel?\n\nKevin: I fe---\n\nIt doesn't matter what makes you feel.
Anyone think this could MAYBE lead to HHH v. Owens down the line?
Never mess with a McMahon, never turns out well for you.
I'm calling it now: Kevin Owens is going to face Shane McMahon, and Vince is going to screw him over and align with Kevin Owens - BOOK IT VINCE because that is best for business $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Now finally Smackdown can sell as many tickets as RAW.
lameeeeee... \n\nvince should have build this more up
>Shane promises to take Owens to hell\nYou said that about taker and look what happen
Tell Shane to take a trashcan, baseball bat
Shane DESTROY him
Stone cold Kevin Owens
Smack That ))
a cell shane, a cell
DO IT
Awful...Just awful...
i hope  Kevin Owens kills Shane McMahon
Spoiler. Kevin Owens wins this match

Slow hands caught me off guard. I was sitting here eating my doritos then it came on and I stabbed myself with my dorito
0:51 what song is it?
lol The Ringer just published an article on Films More Frightening and Bizarre than Mother! and included a relatively lengthy discussion about that subway scene in Zulawski's Possession, linking to the scene. \n\nHow much you wanna bet the writer (Adam Nayman) saw this vid last night and copped Jay's point for his own article?
Just came from the movie and actually didn't realize it was about the bible until I looked up the IMDB trivia. I thought it was so genius and shit. Thanks for bringing me back down to Earth guys, metaphors don't make a good story. It's a cool experiment but nothing more. I fucking suck at figuring out films like this on my own but I'll just try to be more observant next time.
I find it hard to believe that an arrogant , over-rated and pretentious egomaniac jew hack  from New York made a really expensive over-hyped shitty movie.  \nAnd gets to bang the pretty shiksa.\nThat's never happened before.\nMy world is shook.
This comment section is a trip.
Re:View of 2003 Hulk movie please.
Anyone notice that Javier Bardem is 21 years older than JLaw?  This Hollywood trend of increasingly younger female counterparts to older male leads is getting creepy.
26:37 mike did you just say ate'n?
Oh fuck yes, Possession. Please do a Re:View on it.
People laughed during the vvitch? That movie was creepy.
The Romans did nothing wrong
considering the also allegorical theme of high rise with tom hiddleston, what are your opinions on that movie if you have seen it? could you to a video about it?

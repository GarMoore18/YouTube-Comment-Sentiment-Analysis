This is the cutest thing!

Black pudding is so much better if you get the real stuff from Scotland, not some processed crap you had there😂 and ps it's not rice its oatmeal and onions and then the pigs blood. Come to Scotland to try the proper stuff!

Black pudding is made of rice and pigs blood 🐷
You ned to brush her teeth. Tropiclean  clean teeth gel for puppy's is good.
Your dog is very calm.
boyfriend looks like a tool in those Capri joggers
I’m pretty sure black pudding is rice and PIGS BLOOD 🤢
I think it's really rude how you kept saying ew about the black pudding, like other country's and cultures eat blood. If you don't like it try just being a little more considerate and just say I don't like it. Its just more of a polite thing to do. Not ewwww ewww that's so disgusting!!! like you were being a little bit dramatic there.
In black pudding There is pig blood, it’s so disgusting. In Sweden where i live they serve it and i hate it. But in Sweden it’s called bloodpudding (blodpudding).
I'm a simple guy. I see a pupper getting the soapy water...I click.
She is the cutest thing ever!
I have a weird feeling about adam
White pudding is way better than black pudding. Where is my Ireland family at?

FYI....dogs love tripe....just saying.
The cuteness 😩
Ditch the blond look. It's doesn't suit you
The French girl at 16:03 had the cutest accent ever❤️ she sounds like Shae from Game Of Thrones
HAHAHA IM EATING TRIPE WHILE WATCHING THIS
Whistle blows:\n1 = Where are you \n2 = Come to me \n3 = I need help\n\nI would love to have a stash of food.\n\n...but I also try to eat what I have to save money.
I just need a trench coat and a level 3 backpack
Boo hooo, The rich have bunkers and I have to fend for myself.  Guess what, you are not their responsibility.  It's their money and if they wanna spend it on a plan B in case things go south it's their prerogative.
Who gives a shit? They have the money for it.
Best way to prepare for the end? Repent, love God with all of your heart, soul, strength, and mind, love your neighbor as yourself (every living being is your neighbor), and treat others how you would like to be treated. This is what Jesus teaches. Pretty simple.
im not really worried about the end of the world scenario, but i have been thinking about preparing an emergency kit once i have been working for a year or two. \nwhile i say emergency kit, im basically talking about having a chest that contains a hiking bag, some long term survival tools (flint or lenses, strainer, survival knife etc.) a one man tent and food that stays good for a long time etc.\nbecause even if there might not be an apocalyptic event happening in our lifetime it is better to be prepared for catastrophes such as war or famine that will not happen rather than not being preparred if it actually do happen.
Why did trump come in this video at all. Lol.
The rich are so out of touch with how normal people live. The 'apocalypse' means a change in their way of life. That change being they're not leeching off the people any more
You guys are like a discount version of Superfruit\nMitch = Mitch\nGreg = Scott
The world isn't going to end, we are. The world will shake us off like a mild cold.
Making fun of trump is gonna get you raped by little kids in the comments...
Leave new Zealand alone man... that's like the last place where politics and stuff aren't disgusting...
The hosts self righteousness is so cringeworthy.
I love you guys❤ you helped me love science❤
What if I can’t whistle
good job blaming everything on trump and people who are good with money.
What stops security turning the guns on the rich. Honestly 😂🤣😂 why would I protect you. For what?
All the signs In the Quran about the end are coming true too.
Fuck...these guys are just blatantly politically one sided now. You do realize that some of your viewers might be conservative, right? I was wondering why I was unsubscribed and now I remember. Stop alienating a whole chunk of your viewers and just get the channel back to how it used to be.
When society falls, pot farm. Everyone’s an instant friend. A friend with weed, is a friend indeed.
I've been hording the absolute essentials in case of civilization collapses , Toilet paper and WEED.
God damn I wonder what political party you guys chose. Fucking losers
This is one of the most retarded channels in the youtube.I am hoping that the apocalypse arrives soon, so you won't survive beta cucks.
Im poor. Who wants to join me for a raider party.
These two are so stupid i swear
You can demonize anyone but I bet some Puerto Ricans wish they could have prepped.
Meanwhile both of the two in the video are millionaires who have more money than any of the viewers here, and have not given you any money or help.   Pure hypocrites with liberal agendas.
I remember in the 90's I used to get property for sale catalogues sent to me from ads in the back of magazines I was always trying to get people to chip in with me to buy old missile silos which were very cheap then , I knew there would be a great use for them one day , now I could sell them to Rich cunts for loads of money , and then also no where they all are for the end of the world to pillage with my band of mad max mutant people I'd have following me !
You really need to sit on your hands
The days when men were men and women were women, what happend!
This is so pretentious.
If you're rich buy a condo for the rest of us oh but them buying for themselves is wrong? Lazy assholes
Survival of the richest
What's wrong with Trump
This is the most *cringe* worthy video on the internet. Congrats :/
Isn't the most used language in new Zealand Dutch ?
So we're all just gonna ignore the fact that he's wearing a scouter in the thumbnail?
The being rich makes them guilty and insane..... fucking idiots
I just got a pocket knife under my pillow and a Pringles can in my drawer
Fuck these two guys, they’re assholes who hate people with money
I live in New Zealand 😆😆😆
That white guy is an embarrassment to men everywhere.
The rest of us crumble.\n\nNo, just you.
Uh, I hate to be the one to awkwardly point this out, but your political bias is showing.
After the revolution comrades shall go to New Zealand to rid the world of what is left of the capitalist class.
Rapture my friends 💕 Our Lord is coming soon! God bless you all! 😄
You don't have to suffer the great wrath of God. Put your trust in Jesus and salvation is promised. I overdosed in 2013 and was brought into the glorious presence of God. Jesus Christ is the truth! God is Love and Light. I made a testimony video if anyone wants to watch. God bless you all in the name of the Lord, Jesus.
Christ is coming soon. No life hack would work. Believe in Jesus
Your politics are showing
Why would they be guilty? Also why is Trump a factor in our crazy toward apocalypse world? Trump does not equal end of all life because he was elected. If I was part of the 1% I would not feel a single damn thing about the rest of you while I survive.
except that there are waaaaaaaay more poor people who prep for disasters than wealthy
3:48 but.... I can't whistleblow..... guess I'm just gonna die then
Haha Trump bad! Right guys? Please give me likes and views because of my left wing opinions!
This type of prepping, with stockpiling and stuff will only last a certain amount of time. However, developing skills will keep you going indefinitely.
this is a trash vid
Just need a Vault.
This bunker company, is really getting me a vault tech vibe, like the bunker is going to do experiments...
Atlease now I know were suzan collins got her idea for district 13 from.
Watch a video on my channel CJ Collins
This is what we can do to survive Armageddon.\nhttps://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/watchtower-no6-2017-november/survive-armageddon/\nI guess it's getting closer as more of us are getting aware of this :o
Money is the least interesting form of wealth.
The music is a bit loud / distracting
lol you can't escape A.I. no matter how rich (obv different story if you're the one somehow in control), the main reason for the fear is because of growing income inequality and the resulting frustration. The government favors corporations and rich individuals while neglecting the rest, making it an inevitability that some kind of uprising or political revolution will eventually occur unless something fundamentally changes. Unchecked greed . . . what a sad way for a great civilization to come to an end.
If it starts to look _that bad_ I'll just kms, fewer people will help all those formerly wealthy people live, since wealth won't matter once they get to their islands as money will be obsolete.
background music is too loud and annoying!
I don't need to prep. \nI'm just gonna go into the first disaster I see, and *die*
With Trump, natural disasters, North Korea... Jesus Christ, I don't even like the guy but the number of people finding every excuse to put him on the same list as a fucking hurricane is pathetic.
if I were rich I would give my money way to all of you liberal cry babies so you can stop crying about he's not my president or I need other people to do this for me and I need more rights because this or that happened to people I don't even know hundreds of years ago so SHUT THE F UP
obumer is the one who well help bring do America. obumer is not only a LYING TRAITOR PIG, but he's also a minion of the Antichrist. Lol, which is probably why he's a LYING TRAITOR. EVIL PIG!!!
Why is Trump a reason for people to prepare for societal breakdown? I think liberals fucking everything up is good enough for me...
Re: the reddit guys eye surgery--as someone with such bad eyesight that I would be disabled w/o prescription eye wear,  it totally makes sense to think about being able to see during a disaster. I've definitely thought of it, and I'm just a regular person. I'd be dead super fast if my glasses broke or couldn't be replaced in a disaster. Surving as a blind person is probably next to impossible in the wild. Just playing devil's advocate on that one...
IMHO these guys are overly flamboyant, a real turn off.
LMAO fantastic garbage video from guys who oddly made a survival topic video have weird political undertones. This was incredibly hard to watch. Maybe you guys so stick to topics you actually know about lol.
Who’s the bottom?
Y is everyone talking about apocalypse nowadays??
You guys suck
Stop chatting shit geeky fooks
Nuclear weapons are a hoax dipshit
Now im getting paranoid...should we prep too?
Bugmen, smug now; dead later.
Why are they bashing trump?
Commie alert
Bum boys yuk . Spot the aids victims 🤣
This video is very anti trump
Where's Fetta
We're gonna get purged.
Did you say Silicone Valley?
Fallout
Was that a dragon ball z scouter lmo
Also, a scouter? Really?
Dude with the glasses wouldent survive

You are so inspirational, I started watching you at the beginning of july and I got so motivated to stretch and work on my handsprings and tucks, and eating healthier and in a week I'm trying out for cheer team, wish me good luck, and keep up on the good work!
Honestly never cheered so much watching you compete today Nile! Smashed it!!! You've done yourself and the entire country so proud xx
Props your edit became  way  better in last time how did  you do  that ?
Been smashing your videos this weekend, great distraction from doing my work. Great work with your recovery. Can you answer a question for me? How wide do you have you Parallel Bars. I'm using paraletts and figure I should be setting to the same width.
Wooooo go Niall ps I actually love your dad so much he’s hilarious
I swear I could hear your dad when I was watching the stream.
Nile, it is very interesting to watch you compete. You are very different during competitions. Quite intimidating to watch. I'm so used to seeing this sweet funny guy on YouTube and then during competitions, I watch you stare down the Pommel Horse like you're gonna murder it (who doesn't want to murder pommels tbh). Congrats on your sixth place finish in the AA. Incredible work!
What’s the intro song?
What colour is your hair?
Who do you think did better?!

Tell me why James Corden looks like a fat andy dalton #beyourownlifecoach
Let’s face it... James Corden is not funny at all, he’s the worst TV host ever. We all watch his videos because of the celebrities but he is annoying as hell!
My favorite version of this bit!
That was so much fun!
Almost new all of them! Julia is amazing 😁😄😀🙌
Oh my gosh! At school we are reading wonder I'm so glad she will be I  it we are gonna watch it when it comes oit
FINALLY A WOMAN!!!!! There's also Michelle Pfieffer, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and obviously Meryl Streep.
Here so they could do steel magnolias. That movie ripped my heart out
They didn’t do the Mexican I love that movie. This was pretty epic tho Julia is such an icon she should have more than one Oscar.
Господи, как это не интересно!
I love this
Never knew you liked running !!
What a marathon!  Amazing
no Michael Collins
Do this with meryl streep
wow shes done so many movies
Adore her. There is noone like her :-)
Another great concept for the show.
What kind of evil dislikes this?
Wasn't Julia Roberts in avatar (with the blue tall people) or am I getting mixed up like Julian(uhh)? Haha
Love what they did. But covering everything as the description reads, isn't true. I can think of at least 4 movies that wasn't done that Roberts was in. Like the movies Dying Young, Duplicity, Money Monster and The Mexican, for instance.
Haven't seen most of those movies...
I balled my eyes out on that 'Stepmom' scene!
Watching this makes me wanma marathon her movies asap, she's amazing 😍
Pretty Woman and Eat Pray Love ❤❤💙💚💖💜💛
Love Julia Roberts fantastic personality good on you both
Julia Roberts has the most memorable movie lines, I love her since until now she's not aging she still looks good at her age. Runaway Bride, Notting Hill, My Best Friend's Wedding, Pretty Woman are my favorites film of her and I'm so excited for Wonder :-)
DO THIS WITH MERYL PLEASE
I wish they added her tv appearances my fave was friends where she got even with chandler 🤣❤️
I have exams coming up and I rrrreally want to binge watch her movies. Damn it.
How about Meryl Streep’s film career
And this is exactly funny how :? CBS pls bring Craigy Ferg back!!!
Great. Sandra Bullock next please :)
Julia is so talented and beautiful
this was so amazing!!
epic!
Love her!  Pretty woman will always be my fave!  Such a great movie.. she looks beautiful!
I don't think there's any one movie they reenacted that I don't like.  Most of her films are some of my favorites like Pretty Woman, Erin Brockovich, Notting Hill,  My Best Friend's Wedding, Flatliners, Steel Magnolias, The Pelican Brief, and Mystic Pizza.  They left out I Love Trouble, Something to Talk About, and Duplicity, but those are the few that people don't remember.
August Osage County?
Omg thank you for making this 😍😍😍\nSo many memories \nI love you Julia 💛💛
Johnny Depp please! :)
Julia is fantastic, as always. James is hillareous.
That was great!! Very creative! She is one of my favorite actresses. I was going to name my daughter Julia, but decided on a character she played instead.....Darby.
Awww. So sweet. Julia Roberts has the most famous smile in the world i think but she's as lovely even when she's trying to NOT smile and hold her chuckles in!!!! James Corden is a true fan...like one of us.. that's why his show his awesome.
What about that one movie where she did that horrible Irish accent
hahah this is amazing. I wish he would do this with meryl streep
I love that James sounds more excited than other hosts when he says the name of his guests.
ive only seen like 3 out of all these movies
I drink their blood!
A definite walk down memory lane of my favourite movies - now time to watch them all again!  Such an infectious smile and presence in all that she does <3
Funny to see her trying not to laugh at the sight of him in that wig.
Sooooo jealous of James Corden right now
So hilarious I love this !
She's just the best. My most favorite actrees.
James Corden - I hope you see this....you are a fat..unfunny cunt! And I hope\nYou die soon
i was waiting for 13 going on 30...☹️
I was so hoping for Julia to tell James to Eat the fish, bitch!
Where is Conspiracy Theory? What a fail...
the only white woman that doesn't age
Sleeping With the Enemy????
This is pure gold!
THE BEST THING IVE WATCHED EVER!!! AMEN!!! JULIA, YOURE A GEM!
brilliant!
Still my favorite actress! I will always love her! Don’t know why I was watching Pretty Woman at 5 but 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️😂😂😂
Julia is a legend.
Thanks for reminding me how much I adore both of you!
I keep thinking of family Guy whenever I see Julia Roberts, Lois says her lips look like a baboons ass, lol
Love Julia Roberts so much, I wish I could meet her, say hello, take a picture and just have a chat. She seems so nice and friendly.
my best friends wedding for the win!!!! <3
Wow she looks good for 80\n
Such an amazing actress. Always loved her.
Spider and pig looked real.  Julia had more surprises
I think it would have been hilarious if they did August: Osage County, either the tackling to get the pills scene or Eat the fish, bitch! one 😂😂
This made my day 😂
Oh shit, I never knew that was her who played Charlotte.
i just realized ive seen almost all of those movies lol\nexcept for 3
бабушка с нарощеными волосами
Best one pretty woman!
What career?
la amo!
No August: Osage County?!
Very cool.
Love this ... James
tots faboo
Michael Keaton!!!!
Lol
thats awesome
Too bad that you've put the texting right over the tags of the movies. Would've been nice to know, when I don't recognize every single one movie....
a list actors don't usually like doing things like this. she's great.
In Ocean's 11 & 12, James' George Clooney impression was on point 😂
I am curious. Is James Gay?
love this darker makeup look!!!

WHERE THE LBW SQUAD ATTTT!!!
not loving the higher fps used for talking vlogs, theres so little visual information needed in these videos that they always have the feeling of being fast forwarded (esp with hannah's naturally fast paced delivery)\n\ngreat favorites video otherwise!
I work in technical theatre and I had the opportunity to shadow the touring stage manager for Wicked one year. Best experience of my life, that show is amazing!! \nI’ve never had a chance to experience an Immersion theatre show, but I get so excited every time I hear about one. I’m so glad you shared!!
Omg Hannah I've commented this before and I am honestly sorry for repeating myself, but if you like your romantic comedy tropes deconstructed, then give Crazy Ex Girlfriend another go!!!  I swear every other favourites video you give me another reason to be sure that it's basically made for you. But, you know, no pressure. :)
You hair looks longer because it probably is - they often do that when you have a side part. :-P
It'd be a shame if someone did a video with Boyinaband
Thanks for the recommendations, Hannah! \n\nI finally got around to seeing Jessica Jones ... great show! I also watched Mr. Robot, which was weird but good. I've mostly been enjoying my writing class in my spare time, though. :)
Can I just recommend that you watch a film called I am me it's heartbreakingly beautiful and British
some nice favourites you have there :)
I'm seeing wicked november 8th with my school chorus! How is it? :)
and i am here sitting and waiting for a fionas apple record. and she releases an album once every 7 years or so.
I LOVE The Virgin Suicides movie. Would you say the book is worth it? I'm not sure if I should read it.
We did the same with House of Cards! We'd already watched it though, so we started the new series just after GOT finished *I had the void too...*I also love how you described it as GOT in the Whtie House as that's how i describe it to people! Along with Game of Thrones meets West Wing :P\n\n i also really recommend Designated Survivor, if you're looking for one AFTER House of Cards. Isn't Kevin Spacey AMAZING? One of the best actors and it only gets better!\n\nI'm also a huge Reese fan, ever since her Legally Blonde days - i just went to see the musical on friday night in Bristol and it reminded me how much i adore the film! It's also so lovely to see the jewellery brand on here as i discovered them on Not on The Highstreet a few years ago :) As ever, your videos never fail to bring a smile to my day! xxx
The star actor in The Big Sick is Kumail Nanjiani.
I'm seeing First Aid Kit next week for the first time! I'm so excited!
You came to Toronto and didn't say :(   Yeah, it's cool here, 'cept when the winters suck xD
Hannah your brows are on point girl
Wicked is good Hamilton is the best! Highly recommended
That Alice Underground theatre show sounds incredible! So sad I didn’t get a chance to take part!!
You have the best favourites videos
About a month ago I read the Manifesto on How to Be Interesting and loved it! It left me feeling personally affected. I didn't realise you knew Holly Bourne :) I'm happy now to have something to relate to!
thank you! ( your hair texture is first class, Hannah! you are looking Gorgeous, I like you very much, obviously!) thanks! good night! what's next? have a wonderful happy week ahead! thanks!
how come there's no motion blur in this video? my eyes feel warped
i read it only happens in the movies yesterday, it’s the first book i’ve read all the way through in about 3 years (i used to read all the time and went off it completely) it was so good, planning on reading the spinster club ones next
House of Cards is my favourite netflix series EVER! Wicked is also my favourite musical so i'm all over this favourites video :)
My September favourite was definitely meeting you and Lucy at Buffer Fest :)
Is it just me or does the video look slightly sped up?
You're jumper looks so cosy... where's it from?
Have you found your perfect man yet?
I love The virgin suicides :)
I loved Holly's book! and those jewellery pieces look beautiful! :)
Omg yes! Share that First Aid Kit love <3
Dear Hannah,\nI want to thank you for a lot of things but I think I'll tell you a story first, so here goes nothing: \nIt was 11:45 or something and we were sitting on the tables because it was breakfast break (we have that at my school). Everyone is really exited because Anderson asked Eva if she wanted to go to dance lessons for the 9th grade dance (we have that at our school too). There is a certain pressure in the room because              everyone is expecting other boys to ask other girls... who do I want to dance with me? I ask myself...without hesitating I already know: Andrew, with the ginger hair who sits behind me. Without thinking twice about it I ask him: are you going to dance lessons? No, I don't have anyone to go with and he turns around, almost in shame, because he can't  pluck up the courage to ask\nanyone. Do you want to dance with me? I ask and I see his face light up...I still don't know if in embarrassment or happiness. Yeah, I'd love to he says. Why? Don't you have a boyfriend? Because I like you...I  a friend way and he's not my boyfriend, he's my best friend plus he's too old for the dance, he'd have to be 4 years younger \n\nLater that day alot of my friends had been asked out to dance, but none of them had asked any boy. Who are you dancing with? They asked me. Andrew. oh, did he ask you? \nNo, I asked him *silence* \nThey didn't seem to get the idea that it was totally fine to ask a boy out! (Not even out, to dance lessons!!)\n\nBut sure enough the girls that weren't asked, asked the boys themselves the next day.\nHooray for empowering women! \n\nI'm telling you this because I think women like you Hannah, gave me the confidence to do my little act of rebellion against societies ideas. \n\nI probably git some stuff wrong and part of its cheesy but I hope I got out what I could. Thankyou Hannah:)
I went to see wicked the same night :) it was my second time and I'm still awed by it. I wish I could live somewhere nearer to London to be able to see more Musicals!
I was wondering why this video seemed hyperreal.  And it was in 1080p50.  That explains everything.
My boyfriend and I are watching House of Cards and we’ve just gotten into season 2 as well! Also, you’ve made me want to finally read The Virgin Suicides.
haha I think those intros are so cute :P
I love your hair in this video! Cutie.
I once actually had to explain to a guy that the way men pursue women in movies is generally not a good idea in real life.  He thought that was actually how it's done.
Hey!\n\nI've just recently discovered your channel and i love it!\nthe  jewellery.... omg.. i want it. I hope i can find something similar here (i'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).. i looove galaxy and space stuff.\n\nI really love wicked! wish i could have seen it many times as well.\n\nYou could have an amazing intro that is like you.. but you do not need it! seriously!
Adore Wicked - I've seen it twice in London and I'm really tempted to see it again when the tour visits next year.  Will def be checking out Holly's new book!
That's me too! I feel like i need to get the souvenir programme everytime i watch a musical.... and then i don't actually know what to do with it....
You're videos seem to begin after the beginning. Like YouTube delays your video just a bit, but I can't tell how much\n Stop it or stop them. I want to see all of you and I mean that in every good way.
Where is the jumper you're wearing from? I love it!
The Big Sick made me cry too. Kumail Nanjiani who wrote it with his wife and stars in it is really talented and funny. You should follow him on twitter.
Are you planning on seeing It? Or maybe you're not into the horror genre? I think it has a very beautiful cinematography and it was a very good movie, that's why I'm curious :)
oh my gooood I saw the big sick on it's release day it's one of my fav films it's so so so so good, glad you liked it too!!!
Yesss, first aid kit! The new single is amazing.
I love watching these vids because some of these things I’ve heard of and some I haven’t, if I haven’t, then they become my favourites. Lol, plus I just love hannah❤️🙏🏼
i NEED to see Wicked again! i saw it a couple of years back and it was honestly incredible, so much better than i expected! love your vids Hannah!
Tickets booked! A great 19th Birthday present to myself - I can't wait :D
So jelly! I've seen Wicked twice and it was my first theatre show that I saw live. I sat in the front row the first time and cried because of how excited I was. Needless to say, I love it. I would have loved to celebrate the 11th :)
I love Wicked so very much 💚
Was nice seeing you at Buffer Fest! :D
I think I will have ti buy Holly's book
You haven't seen IT
I know this is a weird video to comment on this but the quality of this vid is awesome! Like super HD
My friend read The Manifesto On How To Be Interesting by Holly, and then wrote a blog pretty much copying it? And I got so annoyed, like, I was all 'She's Hannah's friend you can't plagiarise her!'😂
Did you get a new camera? I can't really explain it, but you look more...real?
Ohh I went to an inmersive theatre experience as well, based on the works of Silvina Ocampo; in each room of the house you went inside a different story, but the actress was the same, it was really cool.\nAlso hey! You're looking different today (bangs are banging! Very cool), could it be because of beign back on the pill? And would you do a video updating hormone diaries with how you're doing? They were so interesting. If not, that's okay!
OMG House of Cards AND First Aid Kit being mentioned in the same video 😍😍😍 First Aid Kit are amazingggg live
I've been enjoying starting university. So far it's just been a blur of lectures, training, eating and sleeping
The Virgin Suicides is SUCH a great book. I read it in one sitting while sitting on a bench in  park, and it was the most beautiful day.
Can you film a video where you show all the books on your bookshelf and mention a few of your faves and why. You have so many books I really want to hear some good recommendations.
Pls don’t rip the page out of the programme, it makes me a little uncomfortable thinking about it 😩
i haven't watched the last season of house of cards just yet but holy fuck is that A Show™
Get one like the Drunk Advice intro!
I LOVE The Big Sick. One of the best pieces of film I've seen in awhile.
Oh the last 2 episodes of OITNB are in my opinion the best .. enjoy
Omg southbank 😍😍
Good 🎥 film
Love this narcissist 💋💋🌷
Dannah
First Aid Kit, ahhhh ❤❤
Omg I loooove Holly Bourne
Show off TV
Your amazing hannah! Great vids
I LOVE WICKED
Omg yes love First Aid Kit!
Is the jumper Dodie yellow tho?
BYOI  it's audience participation Improv group,  renaissance  fairs,
You are gorgeous Hannah. :)
Hi
I. LOVE. WICKED.
Robin wright is my BAE!
why is it in a higher frame rate this time? It looks odd to me
The actos name from the big sick is Kumail Nanjiani and I highly recommend his stand up and maybe even more so his twitter. Seriously it's a treasure box! I love that guy. oh and while I'm at it, he's in the show silicon valley. Also amazing.
I'm a gardener, we call it the change. Thank you your up beat and happy perspective.
What time-ish will the event with Holly finish? Just wondering so I can book my train!
The idea of someone ripping out pages of a theatre Programme pains me. Lol
I love your rainbow book stacks
I'm I the only one distressed by the disorganised bookshelf???  :P
Holly was literally in my school today
Literally just found your account I’m 16 and wondering where I’ve been under what rock to not find you you’re amazing omg ❤️
HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU HAVE PER DAY TO READ AND WATCH ALL OF IT AND LIVE
Omg my friend played Alice in that play! What a small world 🙊
Genuinely interested- if I now comment that The Big Sick is not a Judd Apatow movie, but was directed by  Michael Showalter and writen by Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani (a.k.a. the leading actor and his wife), would that be considered a rude comment? I really want to know, because I am a big Kumail fan and am totally excited for the movie, and was just kind of sad to hear Hannah's mistake.
Aaah I had no idea Holly Bourne was releasing another book, I need to get it asap!
Hopefully you'll do more twitch stuff in the future! Been loving that when you were on :D\n\nAlso this video is great! Love getting recommendations for things from your monthly fav's videos!
I love your type of videos!! You can really tell that you’re not a completely different person off camera! Will continue to watch your stuff! xx
9:40 is it dodie yellow tho?
Hi guys!! Will be starting Accutane on Oct 12 (assuming all goes well with lab results on the 11th) and will be having the acne story video coming the following week! I'll be documenting each month on Accutane & filming update videos, etc. This video was pre-filmed, so I ended up being able to get about 2 months of Foundation Friday videos pre-filmed in time before starting Accutane- yay! xx
Damn, if these comments are what it’s like to be on the trending page, I’ll pass.
Hi from NZ!! First off can I say that you are an absolute inspiration to all those who suffer with acne. You are incredibly beautiful and I hope all goes well with the accutane. I went on isotane (very similar) and I went off due to some emotional side effects but hey everyone is different😊 My advise is pretty much the same as most people: A good lip balm and moisturizer is everything:)  Good Luck.
This is why we have trust issues
I love it when you fugly bitches try to hide your acne with makeup , fucking pizza face hoe stop trying to hide your puberty complexion 😜😂
Accutane cured me but it took 3 trials for me. Each time the acne was less and so were the sides (good luck with accutane during cold winter months). First my Chest acne was cured, second try my back was cleared and finally after my final try my face was cleared. It took me 2.5 years to fully get over acne at the ripe age of 23 lol. Even my scars have healed I'm 26 now. Tanning helps with the scars.
I actually spotted the shades 00A and 00B at my local Walmart. They seem to have more of a selection than any other Walmart I've been to lol
Can you add the Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation to one of your Foundation Fridays or 15 DoF?  Wayne Goss mentioned it, but I don't trust anybody else, lol!
Because I was a grease bomb, Accutane only made my skin normal out. However, it made my lips chapped af. It might make you a bit miserable, but stick with it! It is 1000000% worth it!
well milani is geared toward people of color so they probably actually didnt see a need to make light shades
Have you tried drinking a table spoon of apple cider vinegar twice a day? It really helped me out with my skin problem. Of course my skin didn't clear up the next day, but it took a week before I show a little sign of progress. And boy was it great.
Not sure if comments are a zero sum game, but came back to leave another comment just to say, TAYLOR YOURE DOING AMAZING SWEETY. #GoodVibesOnly 🖤
This why you go to the water park on the first date
What I don't like about foundations is they don't have a fair peachy color. Phycians formula had a foundation powder a long time ago in that color but stopped making it. Nothing matches my skin.
Have u ever tried face wash and proactive?
This makeup clears up your acne? If not you should moisturize and use sea salts.
Why do white chick's have such bad acne
And this is why guys say make up is false advertising.
makes you wounder if she would not cake on the make up for a week if here acne would lighten up
Cut the dairy and sugar out of your diet. Add some leafy greens, fuck acutane.
Yo, what's all over your face
OMG the amount of Mansplanning on this video in the comments is ridiculous.....Taylor I am so sorry that this still goes on. I love that people would assume that you have not looked at many options and figured out for yourself as an adult what is best for you. Crazy. I also love that people complain about makeup when they clicked on a makeup review. LOL crazy.
Accutane is seriously worth it. There will be scaring but it will go away with time. But it’s one of the best decisions a person with acne can make.
Makeup is great and all but I think it does more harm than good. Sure it may cover up what you believe to be major imperfections but it damages the skin even more. \n\nHonestly I’d suggest to women that use makeup to first drink at least a gallon of water a day, wear sunscreen in the morning, try not to eat foods that are really oily, and moisturize after your bath/shower. It’s troubling to see what some women have to go through everyday to feel confident in themselves. \n\nIt may sound cliche but guys appreciate it when women don’t wear makeup. Unless of course you’re doing it for yourself, that’s cool too...
I hope the accutane works for you ! I know it must be so hard and frustrating ! make sure to take care of yourself drink water, rest, relax and watch what you eat. Good luck ! I know your skin will clear up by the new year for sure !
Pleeeeease do a review on No. 7 makeup. They also have an app to find your perfect color but wanna see how it wears.
Wishing you the very best. \nGod Bless You young Lady
Reasons why I have trust issues always take your date to the pool
Nothing like pounding 5g of makeup to your face
Just stop putting on makeup until your face heals ffs. Nobody cares how it look ffs. I guess I get it for special occasions like black tie events or weddings.
Watch and Love all your videos! 🌯💕
I have super dry/eczema skin and this foundation works for me.
I have oily combo skin also and it looked just as bad on me as it did on you. I hated it, I looked like I was melting. Lol
What the fuck happened to your face wtf. That is definitely a symptom of a toxic environment. Did that happen before or after you started using makeup? Do you just eat butter nonstop? That is a crazy amount of herpes on your face.
I tried a looot of foundations, high hand and drugstore, nothing works for me except this one 😯 i have acne and oily skin with dry patches
Good luck with your skin journey! I'm also considering starting accutane as well. I hope you get the results you want!!!
Your very pretty without the makeup, the acne doesn't bother me 🙂
Your fuckin hot. That mouth and teeth 🙀🙀 perfect
Hi Taylor! I discovered your channel about a month ago and I just wanted you to know how refreshing your confidence is. I have struggled with severe acne for awhile now and could not find anything that worked until recently. Unsurprisingly, the cure had nothing to do with unsolicited advice given to me, rather it was an extreme medical regiment. I can't tell you how frustrating it can be to watch some beauty gurus pretend to spot conceal their nonexistent hyperpigmentation and then tell me how good the coverage is. Your makeup advice would've been wonderful for me when I was going through the thick of my bad skin days and had no knowledge on how to cover it and feel confident again. People do not realize how painful, expensive, and embarrassing it can be to have severe acne and you push onward with a fuck it attitude that I love. You are in no way defined by your skin, but I know how exciting it is to finally have relief from it all and I can't wait for you to feel that too! \nKeep doing you, I can't wait to watch more of your videos! ❤️
Hey girl! Skin changing post accutane is pretty common but not always. My sister when right back to being super oily. I'm definitely less oily than I was but post I was normal skin for 6 months and then more oily again! It's a journey and you've got quite a few of us that have been on it! We're here for you!  ❤️❤️❤️ lots of love for you as you start this journey!!
I just tried this foundation for the first time today and I love it! Definitely a new drugstore favorite!
Hey Taylor! Thanks for reviewing this foundation - a lot of people seem to love it so I’m excited to watch the rest of the video and hear your thoughts. I just wanted to add that I would definitely love to see you continue primer on just one side of the face.  That would be so helpful!
what's the intro music!? If anyone knows please let me know, I love it
I have combo skin but I usually lean more dry because I am always treating my acne. And this made me so oily!
Girl, you are fabulous no matter what you do. I love that you're putting yourself out there and helping others who may be in the same boat. I can't wait to see how your story goes, and see the new videos that are broadcasting the different products you may be able to use after treatment. I love being a baeritto! 💕
I'm so freaking happy you made this video I saw that they came out with a new shade a few weeks ago and haven't been able to bring myself to try it can't wait to hear your thoughts 🖤
I think it's a really good idea to prime half of your face, but with that it's better to choose a brush or a sponge, because using both with half primed adds too many variables. I've seen a lot of people do it and everyone gives them major shit for it. Lol.
Oh wow I also used accutane, hope you like your results girl! Btw you're gorgeous :)
So excited for you!!!
Im so excited for your accutane journey! It really changed my life. I will say my skin wasnt sensetive, just more dry, so i hope your skin isnt sensetive. Also for a year after my skin was more normal, then it went back for being oily because female hormones changed my skin back.
This is nuts to me!!! We have super similar skin but this new foundation and shade is like my holy grail. I use the loreal beauty sponge to apply it and when I set it with a powder, it doesn't look dewy at all. However, I have only used this with my cane and Austin mattifying primer (amaze balls) and it seems to kill the game all day long. Have you ever tried the cane and Austin primer?
I love your videos! They're extremely informative. Thanks for keeping it real.
It hurts me to see someone so kind with this on her
Thank you for this review.. you just saved me a headache trying to find  this foundation and you saved me some $ too.. 🤗
so glad i fought the urge to buy this the other day 😂clearly there was a reason
I dont understand why people feel the need to comment it they have nothing nice to say.
Please bring back Taylor rants videos!!!!!! Just found them and loved them❤❤❤ naked hippy vagina😂😂😂😂 so funny!!!
Disgusting
i got 500th dislike wooo
*BEFORE* 🤢🤢🤢🤢 \n\n\n*AFTER* 😳😳🤔🤢
Omg the deception
That went 0-100 real quick
Hoooollllllyyyyyyy fuuuuuuuu
Number 43 on top trending!
💗
I had the same problems with that foundation!! It made me look cakey and gross and really really dry even though I have oily skin, and it didn't do anything to control my oils at all, but I found a combo that I liked!!! I use the soap and glory one heck of a blot primer (mattifying) or the Lancôme La Base (pore filling) and set it with a super light layer of the cover FX translucent setting powder if I use the Lancôme primer, and it stays on really well when I do that. I also apply it with a sponge. I like the Lancôme primer a little better with the foundation because it makes the foundation look lighter and less cakey, but the soap and glory really helps keep it matte.
Im super excited for your Accutane journey!! I'm on my last month now and its one of the best decisions i ever made. The most annoying thing I've encountered has been EXTREMELY dry lips and nosebleeds. But totally worth it. In the beginning your skin will be basically flaking off so its hard wearing foundation but as the months pass it gets better. But the dry lips for me have stayed all throughout my 6 months on the medication. Anyways keep us updated and any advice you need ill make sure to comment here! :0)
You might like this foundation once you start Accutane because you won’t be very oily anymore.
@thattaylaa thank you so much for all the work u put into videos I’m sorry about the jerks and their comments  know there are ones that love and appreciate you. Good luck on accutane
what self tanner do you use?
I've been using my arrow root powder, a homemade diy face powder and it has a HUGE difference! I've got combo skin to normal, oily in t zone and when I use this powder (mixed with cinnamon) it works amazing! My face smells nice too <3 using a more natural powder helped combat my oilly skin
hey taylor ♥ i was bingewatching a bunch of your old vids and i was wondering whatever happened to the neutrogena products and beenigma etc that you used to use that cleared your skin a couple years back? did they stop working? love your vids and you!!! xoxo
when you zoomed in to show your forehead, your green eyes looked soooo pretty~~~!
I can't imagine anyone being upset if you took some time away to adjust to the medication, but the fact that you're hustling to create content for us is amazing! You and Wayne Goss are the only beauty influencers I 100% trust to give honest reviews. I hope the Accutane works well for you! 💜
try epiduo or retin a micro?
We can still tell, whore.
I’m so sorry people are rude in your comments saying that your acne is from makeup and blah blah blah. You’re beautiful and cystic acne is tricky and most people don’t realize it’s different and won’t just go away with change of diet and no makeup. I love your videos ❤️
Beautiful why would anyone not do home organic remedies.\nWhy put chemicals on your face.
Tea like super tea...and no more pizza. I wouldn't put makeup on top of breakouts -it only clogs the pores. Toner, astringent, moisturizer. It is ironic really that the makeup you use is actually irritating your skin.
It's almost as if makeup causes shitty skin so you have to rely on it...
How to solve awful acne. Step one: put 30 layers of make up on so when it rains it looks like you are melting
This is why I have trust issues
Wtf am I doing here? I m a f*cking boy
Eww wtf why is this shit in my recommendations is this really how girls look without all that powder on their face? Fuck might as well turn gay
Are you sure you aren't on meth?
🤢
Please do not take accutane. It will ruin your immune system. I can't believe that any dermatologist would give you that shit.
Only way to get rid of ache is washing your face and taking good care of it and actually take a break from makeup that clogs your pores
Has it ever occured to you all of that make up is why your shits all mooned out? Just drink gallons of water?
The bottom of your face looks like cottage cheese.
just bye some acne clearing face wash
Maybe stop using make up and let your  face heal. ACNE DAMN!!!
Her face looks like a crunch bar cuz she's putting all that make up over her acne
Do you go to sleep with a fire ant face mask or something?  What the fuck is wrong with your skin?
I wonder why she has all that acne... hmmmmm
Open sores? Yeah just smother them in cakey chemicals. Wtf women--seriously wtf
ew ur skin looks gross
Disgusting
Why you gotta take her swimming on he first date
Show your real skin... All that makeup makes you fake and ashamed of your face

sonny melton was my best friends uncle and she just sent this video to me...
I went to Willie Nelson Sheryl Crow concert this summer & he played. I laughed at him & made fun of him (and his fans), he seemed phony & shallow. He is now a broken man. This is a beautiful song. Thanks for sharing💔

SUB TO ME COMMENT DONE ILL SUB BACK
I am actually moved by his story. Anyone same?
Definition of class. He's my guy too. Genuine show of emotion. Mr. Misunderstood, we UNDERSTAND. This was beautiful.
Can someone who dislikes this give me an explanation?  He kept all politics out of it and gave a heartwarming response to the attack, what more do you want?
Sick of all the negative news nowadays and want a good laugh? Here's a video of some lady who is terrified of opening a Pillsbury container: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tle5JZoPheM
The pianist's song choices are so delightful! I heard Abba, The Beach Boys and a swath of musicals in there, and I'm sure there were more. What a treat. 💛
At 5:04 is she pregnant? major props to her 👌👌🙌
thank you Lord for this treasure of pure #JOY
I just adore Alexander Campbell!  He is both a magnificent dancer but also seems like a gentleman!
Olga is my favorite teacher! Love that she is back.
Steven stands out so much, he was made to dance. It’s such a passion to him and it clearly shows. ❤️
I love Olga Evreinoff!!
Oh, and Fumi Kaneko looks stunning and incredibly elegant as always. I'm so glad she recovered from her injury!
Can we take a minute and appreciate the pianist?? What an amazing job :) :)
oh my god, mamma mia into rhapsody in blue. so perfect!
Vadim😍. So, so elegant, even in class.
That girl at 57:55 who just skips off like NOPE, I don't know what's going on at all! is literally ME every single time we get to petit allegro in class. I love her reaction though.
Seeing Sarah lamb and Fumi great ballet dancers
I squealed when Alexander Campbell appeared.
Smashing !! Thanks so much for this. Absolutely super. One for all lovers of Dance worldwide. Love it !!
Couldn't watch live so thank you very much for the upload.
A bit disappointed that we didn't get to watch Alex in class! I always love seeing him. But between Steven, Lau, and Ryo I was already torn for who to look at, so I suppose it was for the best, lol. I always find myself drawn to Steven in the end though, he really is incredible...
Simplesmente maravilhoso !  Excelentes bailarinos e belíssimos coreógrafos.
Sae Maeda already stands out and she’s one of the newest. I knew she was going to be something when I saw her perform at Prix de Lausanne. Cannot wait to see her perform principal roles someday!
Thank you ROH so much for giving us this wonderful treat every year! It's so special.
You know I noticed that the Royal dancers were all very honest with their turn out. I recall watching some Russian ballet company classes last year the dancers all had their feet 180 flat in first position and one dude even had his toes pointing backwards in second position - a bit freaky to be honest. There are many things I adore the Royal Ballet for and now I discovered one more. It is my favourite ballet company of all : )
What’s the song at 01:30:00?
Whoops! I spelled her name wrong. I meant to write Yuhui Choe.  Is she still with the company?
My favorite time of year, I just love watching World ballet day with the royal ballet every year
look at the men in the Royal Ballet their feet their bodies their technique their turns Etc and look at the men in San Francisco Ballet and it is so embarrassing for sfb these days
devotion to art, awesome! and as a former ballet dancer, it is punishing to the body and so a very short career.
The pianist likes his musicals!
what a wonderful teacher, i also love her barre combinations!
(if only the commentators would stop talking...)
I am an aspiring ballet dancer and watching this really inspires me.I hope I can be there with you one day.Every year is better than before.Congratulations!
I Love😍 World Ballet Day!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
God, my calves are killing me just watching those 16 rises  😭 😭  Relevés and frappés were my most dreaded exercises in ballet lmao
I always love Royal Ballet's class in World Ballet Day :)
Can we talk about Steven McRae at 44:15?
Steven McRaes but😍😍
At 1:09:45 the music is I could have danced all night from My Fair Lady. And at 1:10:55 My favourite things from The Sound of Music.
ROH channel, thank you for uploading the whole thing! I never get to watch it live. This is my favorite stream from the World Ballet Day!
Does anybody else just LIVE for videos like this, because they can't take ballet themselves?
As good as calf rises are they should be doing it turned out , so they don't bulk up muscles that aren't needed when the legs are turned out.
I love this company and Olga's classes so much ❤
My eyes always go straight to Sarah Lamb whenever she's on screen. Olga is also such a great teacher, I'd love to have a teacher as sweet and straight to the point as her.
I so appreciate the pianist's inclusion of Monty Python's Lumberjack Song
Who's the guy in the black tights and white tank top that looks like it has bananas on it?? I'm really enjoying his dancing.
I always love the live stream on world ballet day! ❤️
What’s the music for the dreamers ever leave you ??
The class of Olga Evreinoff is very fun. But I am waiting for Brian Maloney's class. Can I see his class again? Is Brian a class teacher in World Ballet Day 2018?
Can anybody tell me what the song at 30:20 is?
Could I get any information about musics in this video?
I find ballet dancers fascinating because of their commitment to hard physical work coupled with their artistry.  I admire each dancer's accomplishment to get to this level.
I loved what O'Hare said - we can do more together to bring awareness to ballet as a vital art form than we can each standing alone. Collaboration among art companies in the US has always seemed too politicized to work, as each is trying to beat out each other for limited funding, etc. Everyone seems out for themselves a bit. Worldwide there seems to be a lot more opportunity to come together and be a stronger louder voice that's needed to keep critical arts like ballet alive and thriving as we are stronger together than apart. This is such a lovely experience every year, thanks to ROH and all the companies that share intimate coverage of their beautiful creations, dancers, and processes.
squealed when i saw vadim - love that guy!
I love this so much. It is such an enjoyable thing to watch every year, I especially love watching the class
There's something hypnotic about watching class.  Fumi looking drop dead gorgeous here.
I love how this year they keep the camera on the dancers so you can still follow along while they're commentating instead of going to the commentators and missing part of the warm up class.
I just missed Natalia Osipova in class :(
Love the sound of music in there
1:02:22 is so me when i screw up and 1:02:50 is me when i think i'm at the club when i'm in class
Absolutely wonderful! Every year is better! Crazy music, fantastic: classic, jaz, pop (Abba's Mamma mia!). Love
I missed it that day😢😢😢
So glad to see Ms Pajdak this year, and other favorite familiar faces!
Oh! I was so glad to see Nadia in the first class! If she is into her apprenticeship then I wish her the best of luck for a contract!
I love how the pianist went from Là ci darem la mano (Mozart's Don Giovanni) to Wagner's Treulich geführt (Wedding march) What an irony.
They guy at 1:02:23 is literally me everyday 😂
Love to see all the dancers.  They work so hard and create such beautiful art.  Grateful for their dedication.
Thank you for this video!!♡
What's the song at 1:30:00 ?
Olga's class! Love it!
The talent of the young dancers from the Royal Ballet School is amazing.
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS SO DESPERATELY!
The class and especially the Dreamers Ever Leave You rehearsal were my favorite parts in the whole day. Amazing!!!\nBravo to everyone!
AWESOME!  I ADORE BALLET.
frankie's legssss
Leticia Stock, so beautiful!
Marianelaaaaa!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Does osipova appear somewhere?
my legs hurt watching them lol
Ahhh <3 <3 <3. The pregnant ballerina is definitely goals!!! :D xxxx
Olga -amazing teacher
Love this ! Delicious !
Tchaikovsky pdd😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 amazing
J'aime !
Muntigirov! Love him
Love it!!!
I *do* love a brutha with an accent. ;-)
Every year there's someone pregnant hahaha!
After the last year's disastrous presentation by Darcy, the World Ballet Day has become immensely enjoyable again. I love Kirsty and Alexander's supportive attitude towards their great colleagues.
Annoyed that I didn't get any notices that this was only on Facebook and not streamed on Youtube too. Not everybody likes fb or wants an fb.
Talking about the rehearsal of the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland, the guy in purple (Fernando?) is definitely not as good as Eric Underwood in this role back in the original production. Maybe he's still young and has to learn but Eric's Caterpillar was just so much more sexy and fascinating and his movements much softer, bigger and more elegant and worm-like.
talk the talk .... you'd think they'd sort the picture quality oot        , shabby cunts         . love the dancers tho
Sadly no Natalia Osipova, she's been with TRB since 2013 - never seen her dance live or in the cinema, boo hoo :-(
during class, does anyone know who the girl right in front of the middle is? the one with the oversized white longsleeve and the black knitted legwarmers with white stripes?? she's incredibly good!!
do they dance at their own time..
1:16:15 'cause its just not World Ballet Day without Nela :)
She bores me, and I have had may more better teachers
when will this be deleted??
38:30 men's butt in tights...
EEEEEK!!!! Alexander has a hairy chest AND a nice ass!!! (jumping and screaming like a fangirl with panties falling on the floor).
Who is the Asian male dancer in the black socks and green tights?!
Steven Mccrae😍 hope i spelled that right
Time for kids, y'all. Julian is rocking the dad look HARD.
Julien reminds me of a soccer dad In the first outfit
I came here for the thigh.
This was such a nice video, great outfits for Julien, good job Jenna :) It is so nice to see them having fun and being so relaxed!
The camo outfit didn't match because the pants were lighter than the top
merch idea: fanny packs that say hell yeah on them
And i'm invisible
Lolol I loved this video! So many laughs and so entertaining. I honestly don't know who was more excited over the Lil Sebastian shirt... him or me. I'm so jealous. 😂
It’s the beard 😂
You should do the hot ramen challenge or a I suck at video games 5 please 😫
“Because I like things to match” .....BITCH YOU GOT NAVY AND BLACK!!!! THATS NOT OK AND IM TRIGGERED
For your next Jenna's Ratchet Salon video you should either put candy or Bugals (aka Witch Fingers) on either your face, Julian's face, or possibly both.. I feel like Bugals would be hilarious though :P
Jenna is still bad at pranks because he loved all his clothes 😂
This was cute or whatever, but Julien is thicc as fucc.
3:36 WHAT was this noise. I want it as my ringtone
When this episode is H3H3 inspired. Also Julian is thiccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc\nccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
PLEASE MAKE A COMPILATION OF YOUR DOGS WEARING SHOES 🙏🏼😂❤️
My favorite sayings from you guys are\nBelt-candy we are cops \nYou need to water you cermet so he can grow
I had to go listen to the little Sebastian song
I loved this video! 😂❤️ Also, I just watched Jimmy Kimmel’s video where Isla Fisher makes a PA about not being Amy Adams and all I can think about is having Julien try to tell apart those actresses! Haha mayyy be just as funny as the Julia Roberts/Ann Hathaway stuff! Please make this happen Jenna! 😂😂
You’re my spirit animal. 😂❤️🐐
The lumbersexual julien looks like he'd violently rape me infront of his mother and now I'm hard...
Jenna I'm so disappointed in you....you SAID FUCK YEAH INSTEAD OF SAYING OH HEEAAL YEEEEEEAAAAEEEAAAAAAHHHH ....😒 at 2:02.   I forgive you doe
I legit screamed when Julien came out in the dad outfit 😂\n\nNever been actually attracted to him until then 😳
1. Julien is so pretty. 2. Jenna, thank u for the lumberjack shirt & jeans 3. RIP LIL sebastian 4. Julien, those khakis look scrum-diddly-umptious. 5. Also: Did u use cermets Irish spring soap??!! How dare you, Sir. lol

I’m trying to look for videos of you doing a nice makeup face on Julian and I can’t find one!
The rawr shirt n fanny pack was fashion masterpiece
Can we talk about Kermit at 13:30 I’m WEAK
poor kermeme made one appearance and looks absolutely checked out, stop giving him drugs guys
Why does it look so good though?\n.\n.\n.\nBECAUSE DAD IS HOT AF
*You should make a remake of that video Three Looks but starring Julien.*\n\n\n\n\n Also, thank you, Jenna Marbles for putting up with these entertaining videos that today I needed the most when I have this horrible feeling that I just need to forget about it by watching your videos and laugh. At least almost the only youtuber or rarely a youtuber that I can actually laugh out loud at.
https://youtu.be/S6CFgK8nYLA do this but Halloween
Julien is a hot dad though XD! wooh shake it ! Oddly though, I think that is an outfit I usually see on much skinnier /scrawny looking dudes.
Another example of Jenna not pranking well. Who’s mad? No one.
When u have the same Vans as Julien
Jenna please make merch that says hi my name is Jenna and I have a basketball game tomorrow thank you
Make a mini basketball court  for Ad.

Dang Jenna tryna look like drake
Engage THICK mode :DDDDDD
Wait.....🤔 so if Brooke and boobie claim to have been friends since forever and be acting like they really good close friends keyshia never met her?😑 Exactly like I said before, I don't believe in the lahh drama especially HOLLYWOOD( this one)  plus this season everything seems so stage for ratings but I do believe in that Alexis drama tho she really trying make fetty wap BM mad😶
This is a strong woman(Keyshia). All the stuff she been through and she still standing I don't care what no one say I'm a man myself and I feel that all women should be treated with the same respect as a man are better....
Her hair is usually on point but THIS wig is a NOPE!
Damn!! Brooke a whole hoe how tf you just get out of a relationship ready to open your legs for the next
Her hair is killing me
Brooke how can u be booby bff and u never had a relationship as an Aunty figure to his child? Very odd.
That man don't want full custody of that child he just wants to get at Keyshia to hurt her because he's hurt that she don't want his lying, cheating bum ass no more and she's over it. Keyshia not gone let him have full custody and take her child. That child is just $$$ signs to him. She's already being fair with him which some men don't even get, now he's being greedy. What a way to treat a woman after she let you live in her house when yo ass had nowhere to go and you cheated on her, but she still had heart enough to not want to see you on the street, and this how you repay her🤦🏾‍♀️. Karma is a bitch in the end.
Keyshia Cole is a dime. But she's wearing a Darth Vader helmet hair hat!Her hair stylist should be tar'd and feathered!She looks like a 50's pornstar that sucks dicks on roller skates beside juke boxes.
She reminds me of this gay chick who hit on me a few years ago, I regret not trying it, she was sexy
She need to throw that wig away looking like Frankie 😩
Keyshia, you are beautiful, your highlight is perfect, but that hair. Girl, noooo.
I love Keyshia Cole but baby she needs a better hairdresser. 🙅
SORRY.... But gurlll tht WIG doesnt want to do her job on u gurll..
He is a good daddy
Oh Keisha you are with Floyd...leave Booby alone
So let me see she took care his ass wen he lost his nba job n cheated on her n still took care him while he was so called gettn his rapp career on .and he got nerve to fight her for custody .how he plan to take care of his child with no income...... Oh wait let me guess he  want that keshia money .lmao smh boy bye grow up get a job split custody of child n be on your way !!!!! She aint buggn u for nun be with who u wana be wit n just co parent rightfully  like half the world does .or should in that matter .lbvs
Her hairstyle overshadowed her ☹️
So we gonna ignore the wig
For one, who the heck is Boobie? And two, why is his name Boobie? 😂 😂
Don't like her hair it looks too much.. wig
It's funny Boobi and Brooke felt the need to get closer on Love and HipHop. Sooo there wasn't an incline of sexual feelings between them before and during k and B's marriage?\nHhhmmm..ok....\n..random
If we only would have gotten 10% of this Keyshia on the show.....
I think Keyshia is bringing her own style...even if the wig is big, it wasn't ugly especially on Keyshia
She looks different these days skin color wise
I love Keyshia but that hairstyle doesn't suit her well.
I didn't even recognize her
I like Keyshia, but someone needs their a** whooped for putting that Elvira wig on her head. Most of the season, she's been giving me Morticia Addams teas. Wtf?!
ytf she up there lookin like Judy Jetson
That hair though.
Her hair 🤢
LooooooooooVvvvvvvvveeee Keisha💚💚💚💚💚
she regret putting him on the show Keisha Cole you a strong women
I luv u keyshia what's going on with the hair
Keyshia Cole is so real, she needs her own show again.
What the bird nest is going on😂 lol
I don’t think she’s over Gibson 🤔
I have no respect for Brooke. She stay dealing with a married man!!
I love that she's coming out her shell more!
they need to start posting full shows clips suck
Her bangs are too low; you can hardly see her eyes. How does that not annoy her?!?
whats going on with the hair keyisha
I clicked when I saw that wig! Damn that's horrible
That damn wig make her look like she just turned 70
wth is on her head?
That wig...ohhh god. Let's try again.
Love me some Miss Cole  <3♡♡
Keyshia girl. Why is your bang so thick? The whole wig overall really. It's swallowing your whole face. Can't barely see your eyes.
That’s hair on Keisha 😮 um
I still laughing at Jeanies corny ass dancing when she comes out
I love keyshia but gurrrrl this wig😔😔😔 no ma'am
Short and to the point
There's a person named boobie?!?! Omg 😂😂😂😭
I love Keyshia Cole so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg i so just thought this was k Mitchell smh
Who did her hair like that??
I love keyshia but this hair is not it. It looks dry and old
That wig or whatever on top of KCole Head looks crazy!
yes yes keyshia i knew my girl was coming back smarter and harder lol she got a man her self and he make big big Big checks no more tiny lol lol lol t.i you can have yo wife back I am with keyshia now lol lol
Ikr keyisha u don't got one wit my child. So basically Brooke Whoooo #Ooooh lls
Did Loni just say Brooke ValentiME? 😑
she said brooke valentime
Her wig tho lol
YOU ARE DEAD
I agree with Keyshia Cole 100%
Keisha hair, ni hao kylan -ish
Keisha baby, who's your stylist?
All the wigs in the world and this is one we pick
“No” lol
Love lonis jet black hair 😍😋
Keyshia hair is cute 1:12 ❤️ hair behind her ears 😍😍
Those bangs ugh\nI cant see Keyshia's pretty face
Keisha’s hair...🤦🏾‍♀️
Why she so pale?
Boobie doesn't want full custody, he just wants that spousal support and if he gets custody it'll be ammunition. Smh, SAD.
That hair🤔😑
Valentime Loni, Really?  I'll bet you celebrate Valentimes day also.
Call me a heater but Keisha Cole's jet black hair is what made me not watch this video
She looks so much like K Michelle here
nah I can't..you seriously have to know who you're having a child with.
Keisha kole is really not as intelligently sophisticated in her communication as i thought. She sound like shes slow asf w a hidden clingy demeanor. # unmasked
I have a sister that looks like Keyshia!!
That Wendy Williams wig is a no Keyshia...😐😒
+The Real Daytime come on now I don't even cable right now I have basic channels so I won't be able to watch the show on VH1 or in the daytime because I'm in school... and I was really looking forward to Girl Chat atleast... and this week we've only been getting one girl chat a day I atleast wanted two ?
That hair looks like it’s overwhelming her head but I agree with her on the custody thing. I’m shocked she’s being so damn mature about it, if only all parents were that way
Her skin becomes so white 😐😐
So we not talking bout her hair !  Im getting distracted by it
Ewww  I can't stand this talentless bitch!
How y'all manage to butcher her name when it's literally right in y'all face?  🤔
ABit K Michelle going on here do not like it \nI like style  on n K Michelle better
He basically already said he's not going for full custody. At least that's how I took it. And people need to stop worrying about his pockets. I really don't believe he would leave the NBA without having some type of guaranteed income. Him living with Keyshia on LHHH could just be a storyline as fake as that show is.
She looks a bit like Cardi B here!
Keyshia, I love you. But you gotta fire your makeup artist and hair stylist. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Keyshia is my girl crush. come to mama and dump these losers lol
LOOKS SOOOOOOMUCH LIKE K. MICHELLE
Did she get veneers ?
anyone who watches LHH is ratchet lol
Stupid wig!
Grown Woman response
You guys need to bring relevant guests to the show
Hey guys! I'm a indie artist on the rise! Check out my cover of Keyshia Cole's Incapable & You on my page & follow me @iamdiijai
great video... love your present
Not impressed at all, not the phone for me.\nAs i have the Mate 9, it's a downgrade in terms of screen real estate and battery, and yeah no headphone jack is a big no!
Apple doesn’t have any innovation on this phone it’s like copy of xaiomi display and Samsung cam n wireless charging,face ID,iphone is water proof but Touch ID doesn’t work in water unlike Samsung s8 it’s really work in water too
When you said how the Mikes are listening for the OK Google Keyword my Google went off
+SONY THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE USE OF FRONT BEZELS! HIRE NEW ENGINEERS AND DESIGNERS FOR GOODNESS SAKE!
What is this war on bezels.  Complaining about millimeters worth of bezel is ridiculous.
Um... Wait... The dude I'm seeing, is that the one doing the voice over? He sounds like a different dude... I think another YouTuber... Um who does he sound like...
For those who complain about the bezels, Google will never have the best design because Google doesn't want to kill all his partners (Android manufacturers). Google has always focus on software instead of hardware. They do it on purpose!!! Tell yourself this: There is no way google will make an uglier phone without on purpose while the pixelbook is the most stunning laptop of all times.\n\nAndroid os to compete against iPhone, NOT PIXELS. You win a war with allies, not solo.\n\nThat said, jesus, I would be pissed to pay so much for a phone that design isn't as appealing as an iPhone. Yet, I will still buy it and enjoy the camera, while being jealous of other better looking phones.
No headphone jack....and surprisingly, he didn't make joke about it this time...:D
That camera is gonna be lovely!! 😍😍 i barely take pictures with my Note 8 cause pictures come out too pale.
iPhone 8 Plus will be my daily driver for the next two yrs unless they find a way to include Touch ID into the screen .
I don't like how every time Apple something every other brand does it or attempts/thinks about it. Such as the removal of the headphone. (Fucking really?! Thanks Apple!) Also camera bump. Google is fucking their phones, getting sued by the UK and destroying YouTube. Einstein's over here guys! Geniuses!
For those of you who are ranting about the bezels, gosh get over it. There are negatives to a curved edge. A lot of us like a flat screen. The bezels on this are totally fine. I have a Nexus 6 and a Moto x pure. Love the dual speakers on both. The dual speakers are perfect. The side bezels are fine too. Gosh, not everything has to be Samsung's crap curvy lure. I don't even think it looks that good either. After all it is all about personal choice. The real issue is will Google make these available AND let it be clear they will work on all carriers. Google's marketing plan for the last one was non existent. A lot of folks thought you could only use the pixel on Verizon.
dog don't you get bored of all these phones
I have a P6 and was waiting for the Pixel 2XL. Now, without the headphone jack, maybe. Using a case the side bezel, no big deal. Like the speakers out front. The trend toward super slim phones results in a less durable phone (something has to give). A practical phone the Nexus has proven to be.
excellent review and analysis, the best!
Perhaps the side bezels is enough to compensate the tighter hand grip. Who else have accidental touches on the latest Galaxies or Edges? (without a case of course)
I just want the wallpapers.
Damn the no headphone jack killed it for me
Should I Buy LG V30 or pixel 2 XL?
No headphone jack - no sale. It's also $200 too expansive for either version, but so was the original Pixel imo. Side bezels are as thick as those that come on very cheap Chinese phones. Axon 7 has two front firing, stereo speakers with a great DAC for less than half the price.
Here's the real question should I save up my money for this new pixel 2 or should I just go with the pixel 1 and save some money
THAT KINDA BLUE COLOR... it looks amazing
Hmm pixel 2 and pixel 2 xl. No headphone jack. Hardware made directly by Google with optimized android software. Google makes and iPhone and no one says a word lol
Clicked off right when he said there was no headphone jack. Seriously phone companies what is going on?
That black is nice.
Note 8....pixel 2 xl.....iphonex....what would you pick for your daily driver
i was playing this on my note 8 and when you said ok google keyword it triggered the assistant
The fact that phones like elephoneS8 or Umidigi crystal etc exist either means the technology for making good phones is now cheap or the Chinese/Indian makers are operating in losses or break-even territory or govt backed..effectively 400$ + phones will be for the richer market while the rest ie majority will get Chinese/Indian products with same/similar/good enough specs..its all good for the average customer..perhaps even you guys who get excited to spend $1000 on a product that'll be obsolete in 6 months!!!
I think the Pixell 2 looks butt ugly the chin on it looks like it came straight out of 2011
You know Google gave up on competing with Samsung when they copy Apple. Hopefully they don't take away the Android OS from them
You lost me at no headphone jack
Pixel 2 not that impressive, sorry no sorry
This is almost perfect for me, I'm just not sure how I feel about the lack of expandable storage :/
Is there any widget i can find on the play store that has the date with weather next to it like the pixel 2 home screen? I can't find one. Thanks in advance.
It big business wanting to eat is the reason for not having 3.5 jack. Did anybody notice Apple also Google have wireless earbuds now?  It's not an accident Apple also Google released wireless earbuds near the same time their flag ships phones did.
Funny when you said 'ok Google' in the video, my phone went to the assistant. Maybe I should experiment with this to get people subscribed to my channel! Nice video.
a bit 2000 and late. fail.
This device would be a slam dunk if it had a headphone jack, but it's still pretty solid, best thing about it is the software of course, just can't beat the stock android experience
All these phones look the same now, it's boring.
That phone is UGLY just jesus its awful. Hate the design
google has the worst taste in designing techs, it just does not know how to do it
tooo expensive, google nexus was a better approach to smart phone in my opinion
That panda white shit looks nasty asf😂 I wouldn't pick that colour at all
NO HEADPHONE JACK??? YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME GOOGLE!!! IF I WANTED A DOWNGRADE OF A PHONE THAT TAKES AWAY FEATURES, I WOULDA GOTTEN AN IPHONE
This phone is ugly as hell Jesus
Yo this phone is mad ugly!
The sea seems to be moving in the wallpaper...
The bezels are a little bigger because of the stereo speakers... Great phone, great look (although I hate that glass shade)....\nI'd definely buy one!
DO A REVIEW OF THE APPLE WATCH SERIES 3 42MM WITH LTE!
No headphone jack = no buy.
sent shazam straight outta business
Ugh, those aluminum phones are more slippery than glass.
I want one.
Sold
Trash trash trash!
No headphone jack!!!!! Fuck pixel... We need Nexus back
Moto g5S update??
Finally!
good bye iPhone.. hello pixel 2
No headphone jack = buying the V30
CLICKBAIT MUCH
Ugly design, specially the back!
Now I can’t UNSEE that “sunken” screen...
Jesus Christ the phone comes with an adapter for the headphone jack
Is just a phone man you’re making big deal mos of people using phone have no idea why all this statistic are the just do the job & that’s all
It makes me scared for humanity when I hear something like now you don't have to stretch your finger as much
Why doesn't  this nigga ever do a giveaway
It's not just software. The camera tech from a hardware point of view is actually pretty incredible. Each pixel on the sensor has a partner pixel, making it a 12 megapixel camera with 24 megapixels worth of data to work with. It's gets a hardware stereoscopic effect by having an array of paired sensors that are only microns apart, within the same lens. \n\nIf it weren't for the lack of a headphone jack, this could have been my next phone. such a bummer.
The Pixel 2 looks like sub 300 dollar junk with a premium price lol the XL 2 just looks like they attempted to catch up with LG and Samsung and gave up because it was too hard.\n\nThe last pixels where lacking vs the rest of the market and these are trying but miss the mark by 1inch.\n\nGoogle rolled out some half baked goods Here, better wait for the pixel 3 guys.\n\nAs a nexus guy who grabbed the XL and realised they where a back step this is poor from Google and who ever they partnered with.\n\nGlad I grabbed a s8+ and rooted and removed all Samsung's shit, a rooted s8 / s8+ and note 8 are better than this offering everyday of the week
Will definitely be going for the LG V30 over this Pixel 2 XL. Nothing against Google but when the camera and the search on vision features are my 2 favorite aspects of this Pixel 2 I'm not impressed. I love all the camera options on the V30 and the internal dac(I listen to music a lot so that helps). Paired with my student Tidal account having access to high quality audio that combo will be fantastic. Headphones I use: Beyerdynamic DT 1350(with the better earcups).
I really hope the pixel 1 will get the Now Playing and Google Lense feature. also a portraite mode with an update
it looks fucking cheap for flagship phone
New Pixel 2 back reminds me of Nokia 6300.
Only phone that impressed me in 2017 \nPs:I hated the first pixel
Catholic explain union vhwvbb priest else hope arrangement please river hole previously nowhere.
Google messed up not putting a headphone jack on this Smh
I hate that they don't sell these here in Norway..
Fingerprint censor on the back? I'm out.
What have they done to *Jack*
Why does Samsung or any company give option of micro SD card at the cost of 2nd Sim even when we are paying more than INR 50-60000 ?\nIs that amount not enough to provide a dedicated sim card slot and a separate sd card slot ?\nWhy don't you run a poll what millions of people want ;  and post the results to company's officials or Twitter account to make them aware of the reality. As a tech reviewer Don't you think that its a duty and a good move of yours to suggest this to companies.
Xl looks like some kind of a samsung s8 fake clone 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ and no headphone jack??? Soo what about those making fun of apple ads last year😒😒😒😒😒
Looks like a fake note 8
can I get 50 subscriber
Why the case have two colors in back ? very stranger
Pixel 2 XL in 🐼 is what I like. But nah.. can't be recognized on Mac.\n\nBetter to be behind in tech by at least a couple of years... \n\nFirst-year prices: $700-$1000+\nSecond-year prices: Under $400\nThird-year prices: Under $200\n\nStop wasting time and money on planned obsolescence and disposable products. Incremental updates on SoC, camera, display, and a stalemate on battery life.\n\nMobile industry has become the new fashion industry.
the regular pixel has god awful edge screen, maybe worst than the iphone 4
Lol at all these guys crying about the headphone jack.  Can’t wait till Samsung drops it eventually too, just to see you lot on suicide watch.\n\nI actually kinda like this phone’s design, especially the white and black one with the orange button.  Looks kinda chunky and spacey, pretty cool.
fucking ugly looking phone imo
No headphone jack?\nFuck that
the default theme is poop
Disgusting screen look
Please do LG V30 vs Pixel 2 /XL comparison.
LG V30 review please!
Why no headphone jack???
What an ugly ass phone 😠😠😢😢😢😢
Worst design
It looks kinda cheap, and the proportions on the screen is weird
just thinking out loud here, i bet the squeeze feature is the reason the side bezel is so thick
Google Assistant photo search is not new, even at Google. Before, that thing was called Google Goggles, and it hasn't got any update for 5 years

Lydia you did not look bloated. If I'm bloated I look like 6 months pregnant 😂
Love the vlogs. As horrible as it would be, I do wish that they would take you to the labs in China where they test the products on animals instead. Hopefully everyone would wake up and see how these companies profit from the torture of these innocent, scared animals 😢💔
kartal kalkar dal sarkar dal sarkar kartal kalkar

Hi Lydia! Love this video; as always :) and what a bummer. I was also so  excited for you to work with Brides because of how excited you are! Hope all is good between you both. 😘 😘
Loved this vlog so much Lydia, you looked stunning as usual and your lipstick shade was amazing!! I wish they could put that on sale xx
Love the make up look for the party. You look really pretty with ur hair tied up! X
Lydia, feed Lunie on a flat plate or a wider bowl. She might not like her whiskers touching the bowl when she eats and that could be why she drags her food out to eat it. Cats are weird like that.
Lydia please please!! do makeup tutorial on the one you were with the Balmain dress, it looked stunning on you!! xx
Looooooool “hold on to ur butts” 😂😂😂
What is u nice hair Colour called?
Go Lydia♣♣♣
You are sooo pretty Lydia 😍
Wow, the Balmain show must have been a dream come true and it looked so extravagant and princess like. I am really sorry though about the Bride's Show. I know you have been looking forward to it. Stay positive, maybe an opportunity like that will come your way in the future!
LOVED your outfit to Paris: roll neck & H&M satin shorts. Obsessed!!!! X

Tori Amos for the runway show, GENIUS!!!
Lydia what photo camera do you use for taking pictures ?
Omg there was an Estonian model!!!!!! Im from estonia!!!!!! So proud of her, we actually danced together few years ago 🇪🇪🇪🇪
Your older videos.were more watchable.n entertaining. Now it's so much of needless talking . Why change the concept?
LOVE the first out. Simple, autumnal and your legs 👌
Your cat is just kneading :) they do it as that is what they would have done to their mum as a kitten!
I always wanted to make a lipstick! Lucky you!
I love that black dress, need it in my life, how tall are you and in wich size is it? :)
At the start of the video You did such an amazing job with your make up 😱❤️just loved it..
What is the lipstick youre wearing at the beginning? I need it
Ok but was the rubber duck actually chocolate????
Patricia we love you😀❤
I love Patricia lol
So it's a chill one today, we're just heading to Paris that's it... 😂 who wants Lydia's life 🙋🏽
Love the ponytail look you've been rocking lately! Might you do a hair tutorial for it in the future? X
Cats do that paw thing because it reminds them of the womb. It's a comfort mechanism.  bless her!
I've been on maternity leave for the past two months and though I really loved watching your videos before they have become a nice break for me from mommy duties. I love what you do, you make my  day when I have me time.
loved the vlog such an amazing experience!! love Balmain
SWEETGREENS! I discovered them in the US and have been obsessed since. They need to open one in London. Like now. Literally the only thing I eat in America. #guacamolegreens\nAlso, you look gorgeous as usual. That dress is amazing on you.
That’s what cats do when they are happy and relaxed, it’s like the motion they made when they were kneading Their Mum while drinking milk as kittens.
Sorry, not a fan of those huge clear glasses....looks kinda odd ~_~
I loved ur video but lumi just makes its pop.  I just love her little self.  I have a kitty named Cali but she doesn't hardly talk.  Ever.  So my request is an entire video of a day with lumi.  It may be difficult with ur work and all but I know if anyone can do it, Lydia can.  Love u both.
the glow scrub must be new..it doesn't come up
Thank you for your wonderful vlogs! Would like to ask you a question. You and Ali are always traveling , going to parties, meeting different people. How have you solved the issue of jealousy?
So Happy that i found you on YouTube 🙏 love you Lydia 🎉
You are SO pretty😍
You so beautiful, I like your dress.
Cats do the thing with their paws because it's what they do on their mother's breast when they are nursing and they never grow out of it. They do it when they are warm, relaxed, and feeling lovey :)
Hi Lydia\nThe watch you are wearing in this blog will you let me know what make and size it is thanks. Have to say you look fab .
Love all your outfits!! You look amazing 😍 xo, Daria
Omg I would love a lipstick made by you together with L'Oréal! It would probably be the best nude ever. ❤️☺️
the london transport is really bad
been really loving your make up lately xx
Your gratitude is what makes you one of the best YouTubers.
That mayberlline red lipstick looks beautiful on you
Oh wow, must show us your final product of your lipstick :) Lumi is so cute, must have missed you so much 🐱
Its so wonderful to see your success. You’ve worked so hard for these experiences!
no sorry to the ladie below but Lids i love ur over 40 min vids....keep them coming.... :)
Hey Lydia, I have been subscribed for a long time but in the last few weeks/ months I havent clicked on your videos as much mostly because they are always over half an hour long and to be honest while I love to see a vlog sometimes I do also like short snappy sit down videos. I do not have the time to watch 40 minutes of youtube and I dont wanna root through your vlog to find what you have bought or what you are wearing. I do understand that you want to share parts of your life with us but I'd much rather watch a series if they are as long as your video. I still admire your Style and your personality but I havent watched a full video of yours in 3 months which is why I have decided to unsubscribe. Just thought you may want some feedback. All the best to you <3
I absolutely loved that dark lipstick that you wore at your shoot! So beautiful
I'm waiting for the colder weather to come, so I can see your jumper dress outfits again!! My all time favorite AW clothing item, and you make it extra! I'm currently rewatcing some of your vlogmas 2016 videos just for that purpose.
when cats feel confident and secure they like to do that thing with their claws. By the way  i really love you and you are such an inspiration! Maybe you are comming to austria some day :)
Please do your evening makeup with charlotte eye palette
Wow, you look so beautiful! It seems your body is even more toned (not like lost weight, but more sports) and your cheekbones are chiseled and goddess-like! Really cool, so happy for you :)))
I LOVE when Lumi makes an appearance! 😻
I hope it will be cruelty free
Cats do that motion with their paws, because they feel safe and comfortable with you. Basically, it stems from how they would get milk from their mum as a kitten, so when they feel in that same safe way, they do it. It's super sweet, means she loves you lots :)
I can't understand the craze to wear clear glasses before I had my eyes lasered I detested my glasses and had it done purely for vanity sake. But then mine were really thick lenses. Love you Lydia and look forward to your vlogs so much 😘😘
You are one of my biggest inspirations and I have so much love and support for you. My only wish is that when you filming in a car please wear your seat belt. I know that your an adult and can make your own decisions and I hope you understand where I am coming from. I don´t want anything to happen to you or anybody else for that matter. We are so many people that look up to you so I hope you will take this in to consideration or not just film and show that in your videos if you decided to not be wearing a seat belt. Hope you have a wonderful day Lydia :)
Aww must have been a great honour for you <3\n\nhttp://carmelatte.co
That balmain dress looks like it was made for you, fab! Xxx
That Balmain black and gold metal dress is sick! Love it! The bag should be w one handle and it'd be perfect, methinks?
OMG PATRICIA AND LYDIA IN ONE VIDEO!!😍😍😍
Patricia is my fave glad they appeared together on this vid
Love seeing my two fav YouTubers: Lyd & Pat!!! You two need to get your butts together and create a bleamin video, seriously!!!!!!!😂
I wanted to see the lipstick!!! Please show us soon.
Omg  the make up  that you did after the shower with the ponytail looked soooo good.You  should definitly wear eye  shadows more 😍😍😍

Awesome Tribute.  1st concert I ever saw was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, at Hec Edmundsen pavilion at UW. Saw him 3 times and loved every show. Would you consider covering Spike, off of Southern Accents, or pack up the plantation live version?  Love Your Music!
They should do a cover of Shut Up and Dance. Who agrees?
I thought this was going to suck.  I was wrong.  RIP Tommy boy
Love this song. Great performance and tribute to a legend
Wow... I'm not into this music genre but I love the vibe you guys give off. The sound is smooth. Nice in general. 👍
Another amazing cover and big props to Tom's legacy!
Top downloaded WOTE on Google play (just downloaded it myself) Very cool all the proceeds going to the Heart and Stroke Foundation :D
I would pay good money to sit by the fire with these guys and just listen
When I saw this was a  Tommy Petty cover, I was upset. But after watching and listening I was smiling, singing and clapping😁 Amazing job and don't think Tom would have disagreed...how fun!
You guys are always so amazing.
lost all respect for tom petty when he sued sam smith for royalties because tom was broke. stay with me doesn't have the same melodies or respective choruses as i won't back down. sad

What is wrong with society? Having young children questioned by two grown male comedians about intimate topics that should be discussed with their parents? Shame on the parents for allowing this. Disgusting, this is not normal. Wake up
i will miss the brain cells i lost watching this
If the boy did asked the question What third base is these guys would have answered it better or comfortably than when the girl asked it.
nick kroll definitely made nick to look like him
Nick Kroll should be legally obligated to stay away from children
I’m 13 and damn I wish I could be in this video

name a better duo! i'll wait
Nick looks sorta like my youth pastor who's also named Nick. Creepy.
What is the point of this video
i can’t listen to john’s voice without imagining andrew talking lmao
I could see Nick being a great dad some day and giving funny yet honest advice. And John... tried lol
John Mulaneys career must be going thru hard times if he is at buzzfeed. BTW who is Nick Kroll?
Big mouth is my new favorite show , slowly healing the void in my heart from the absence of Brickleberry
ANDREW AND NICK \nBIG MOUTH\n\nIS \n\nAWESOME
I use a diva cup lol
I love Big Mouth 😭😭😭
This is so great. I love how nick is being really funny or serious and John is still trying to figure out puberty
this could be an entire television show
I have never cringed so hard. Where is the bleach?
C A N C E R\nA L E R T
Brooke goes to my school.
Big Mouth is an amazing show....ready for season 2 ...
4:47 the girl is genuinely looking concerned and like she’s taking mental notes
1:21 Brooke was not having it 😂
What's french kissing? \nWell, I thought it wass when you kiss with cigarette breath.\ngoldddd
That moment when the character that you voice looks just like you.
Would be awesome if it wasn't on BuzzFeed
Season 2 damn it i want it
2K likes and 195 comments yet it's on trending. Ok BuzzFeed, how much did you pay YouTube?
Damn this is gonna be awkward
Congrats, John Mulaney, you are officially important enough to me to make it worth watching something by buzzfeed. Lol
Third Base is a 90s hip hop band. Lol!
I think John was uncomfortable the whole time because he knows these kids know exactly what to say to bully him accurately.
Mulaney is so funny!! Nick Kroll is, um, just there. Not really funny
toothpaste works bruh
This is wierd dude
Nick looks almost exactly like his character on Big Mouth...
John Mulaney bull? Why buy the cow? Because that's you love her that's why.
A pathetic example of stupidity masquerading as humor.  Made all the worse because these fools are substituting nonsense for critical information.  If you are lacking the knowledge or guts to tell the truth, don't bring up the subject.
I clicked as soon as I saw John Mulaney 👏🏼
i thought nicks laugh at 3:13 was the little girl
Be gay. That’s the only message you will get from youtubers
I always love spreading fatty butter on my skin.
only buzzfeed would make a video idea as dumb as this.
This stuff has to stop
I like Big Girls ;(
I lost brain cells watching this shit
Buzzfeed this was a real bad idea with these fellas. Lol
I don’t think these men should be allowed to be near teens
Buzz feed is a very gynocentric channel. It's awful.. 3 girls and 1 homo kid. Jesus Christ.
If you finish a shower with cold water, the pores on your skin will close, preventing dirt and shit from getting in there. \n\nI know it sounds sketchy, but It’s worked very well for me and some friends of mine that also do it. Plus it also prevents you from feeling freezing when you step out of the shower.
They would make such a cute couple
I just came here to drop my dislike\n\nAnd comment
John is so adorable! I love this video.
I didn’t know this was a cringe compilation
Useless.
I wanna clap Brooke’s cheeks
Uhh 🙄 really now?!?
http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=159749
WTF
((()))
Big mouth is fucking hilarious
OMG OMG MY HEALTH TEACHERS NAME IS JOHN MULLANEY WTF
Creepy
Y is this trending
John is uncomfortable LOL
Why do my balls flop around? 🤔
Buzzfeed and big mouth. 2 god awful things
80K and trending?
Oh, hello.
Get this shit off trending!
AHHH BROOKE
JOHN MULANENY ASDFGH
Buzzfeed you disgust me
PEDOPHILE BuzzFeed at it again
https://youtu.be/TMCFKABRwg0
This is weird
Its the douche
#notmytrending
I hate it how were in 8th grade and already know all about that stuff but they will teach it again anyways
Here's Buzzfeed, pushing for sexualizing younger teens. 👌👌👌😂😂😂 Kinda how WatchCut threw a bunch of sex toys on a table and mentally scarred a group of kids. Disgust. The left will keep on pushing for normalizing pedophilia, so f*cking disturbing.
That netflix show isnt funny... but Its okay (animation is terrible) but story is, okay...
I don't think boys are stupid, I think they're bad. 😂😂😂😂 John Mulaney is my idol
I guess you can say that frying pan was *cooked* at the end
He should've just sat there while everything exploded around him because the red zone is a joke lmao. Just looks over and sees a guy in a suit having a leisurely stroll before S686ing a scrub with a P9
muito legal seu canal, gostei dos videos ! mais um inscrito...
Omg you are a genius thats how the zone should work, you cant see in it every thing is blured, Fu** you zone campers!!!!
Story of our life
New watcher here\nThat was good
When the Bombs hit the Ground and explode with a Sound thats a scary
The effects were amazing
This is sooo well made!!! Loved it!!
i like the animaton of the blue wall
We need a link to the remix of the Battlegrounds theme, and we need it now!
Ok I love the shit out of Corridor, but this kicks that videos ass.
im tired of all the live action adaptations of the game making melee weapons look bad ass.
0:07 thats so me in the background
I don't know which one is better. Nukazooka's or CorridorDigital's
Holy fuck, that quality and accuracy!
This is actually really really good
very very Good!!!!! \nI live it.  <3
wow! i need more video
Not realistic. That wasn't a c-130 at the beginning...
Well we all would've died if we were out of the circle for that long but lol I love the ending circle. Whenever I get automatically marked in the circle I try running on the edge of the circle lol. Well it looks like you didn't survive long enough to receive your winner winner chicken dinner... But your team's production on this remake live action deserves the best chicken dinner. Just make sure you use your frying pan to make the best chicken ever 😂
They really need to nerf that frying pan.
3:48 The way he holds the can changes after the cut. Other than that, great vid!
Pubg dev should really catch up with u.
What kind of graphical mod is this?
damn this is so well editted
i decline to believe this wasnt made by corridor digital
The only time I ever died to a red zone was the very first bomb spawned. It scared me so badly because I didn't notice it until a loud noise filled my headphones and I was dead. I still casually run through it though.
So well done!!!!! Loved it.
Wow. Great job, but there was a few mistakes.
Noob.  You still can run using that vehicle and run inside the house.
a more serious (albeit still slightly humorous) take on PUBG compared to Corridor's version. Still, both are good.
Should’ve put the gun away to run faster
Old call of duty sound effect at the beginning i love it! ( if im not wrong :^) i really hope there's gonna pump out some new fresh blood soon on WWII games with a good story line and lots of new radio transmissions and soldiers shouting stuff. This is so epic to me just listening to the frist few seconds of the video, the yelling soldiers truly gave it more cinematic feeling great job on the hole video!\n\n\n\nbut that was unnecessary  *LOOK OUT TANK*  at 0:16 theres no tanks in PUBG? yet.. x) \nstill a fucking great video and acting. editing skills i can only dream of achieving
Dude..that was the best one I've seen so far. Downright awesome.
Что за зона, у которой синяя граница?
they landed at school.
That frying pan is OP
Props to the renderer
Those special effects tho
Nice
Damb nice fricken cg
Good video!!!!

C'est quoi ta carte graphique stp ? 😂
I am absolutely dreading seeing family in Hong Kong!! \n\n‘Why have you gained weight? Why don’t you have a job after university? Well that’s what you get for taking a creative subject...’  ffs 😐
I think your face is just a little fuller than it used to be and that is why they notice it so much more but I think you look amazing Bubz. Healthy and happy and your family looks the same. Like you said in time it will change and you did just have a baby.
Omg I cried when you all were saying good night to Isaac 😭 oh my pregnancy hormones
This kid stopped, said in English that Lindy is 10 times his age.... these 3 year olds out here.. amazing 😩😩
Naturally you have baby weight atm but tbh it's not even that much! Youre Still quite slim even with the gain, you'll be back to your usual size soon but just remember size isn't everything and you are beautiful no matter what!
Can someone tell me what camera that is she’s using to vlog???
ayla bathing looks so much like Isaac when he was her age... omoooo so cute.. love them chubbchubb rolls
Issac is super adorable. He's so grown up now!
Issac is one of the sweetest boys I have ever seen <3
She's tiny. And her babies are born chubby and cute
Ayla is such a happy Bub😄
The same thing happened to me although I'm not overweight even after baby .. My family would call me fat. And after all the sleepless days or nights it could definitely be a damper on the spirits. Keep up mummy bubz u r doing so well! They really don know what they r saying. We r the best mums to our kids for giving them what we can
Can you make a “how to vlog“ video?
It's usually the older generations that do this too.\nMy mom is my worst reminder of all my insecurities cause she always says I'm fat even though I'm not and then I start believing her :C
Awwwww she's a chunky baby just like isaac was ❤️❤️❤️
Ayla is the cutest, just like her mom! Also, I have that same little portable fan. IT'S LIFE CHANGING. I like to use it in the morning to help facial mists or makeup sprays dry faster, too. xD
Bubz , You Are An Excellent Example Of A Lovely Human Being... ! 😊
You are perfect the way you are. I am sick of the world trying to make girls and women think they must be perfect based on social values.
I’m honestly surprised that so many people are commenting on your weight because you don’t even look like you’ve gained to me. I think you look great!
Isaac is such a polite and well mannered kid, well done to you both. I come from a Chinese family too, so I totally understand where you are coming from. I know I will never do it to my kids when they get older ❤️
Oh so Ayla has cradle cap. That's easy, coconut oil or baby oil will soften the skin then gently get a fine tooth comb and gently run it along the skin. I was able to get my son's cradle cap off that way. It's normal and common, and usually happens around newborn age to 1 years old
Hey bubz really my son is also 3 but he s not even interested in abc or ne learning thing it make me sad
I’m due my first baby any day now and I was at a wedding about 8 weeks ago. One of the grandmas looked at me when I was eating and said wow you still have a while to go yet and you are pretty big. I managed to laugh it off but I was not expecting comments like that! I’m a UK size 8 normally and I’m probably a UK size 12 now. I just keep thinking of how sore you must have been during the final weeks now I am there. You did amazing!
5:00 And this is how God came into play/ was invented :D lol
Hi Bubz-mommy ! im glad you all are ok there! i hope your little doggies are ok also! please tell us about them at next video! :)
Feel the same way with my 2 toddlers..😭
lol never miss an arm day😂😂😂
Loved how she randomly spit on your hand
Your not fat because, that what happen when you give brith and it call beauty and plus you should said I also human begin too so sometime my body is not going to be like as you wanted my body to look afther getting brith because I also getting old so there no need to worry about my body no more because I already have someone who love me for who I am and how I look like and take care of my two kids. 😊😍😘 but it just depend on what you decide and choose so yea . 😊 and plus your baby is so cute when she yawn 😍😘.
LOVE your makeup whenever you're in Hong Kong! Looks so much fresh :D
the disconnect between the mentality of asian relatives who live in asia vs. your own upbringing as an asian in a western country will always exist. you just need to remember that in their culture, it's automatically assumed that every individual wants to be thin. they're not telling you you're chubby or fat because they don't love you, but rather it's because they care about you and are trying to be helpful in the way that they think they should be.\n\nwhich is totally not to invalidate anything you're feeling, because i've absolutely been there too. i gained about 15 pounds in the last year and a half and while i'm not fat, i look noticeably different to my family. when i'm just sitting there with my mom and my sister having unrelated conversations and my mom suddenly finds another way to bring up my weight and my out of control habits, it makes me feel like she can't even see her own daughter as anything but a measurement of fat. but you just have to keep doing what you're doing and let it roll off you, while reminding yourself that it's not a matter of love or not-love, but just difference.
Hi bubz! Love your videos! You are doing so well only having a baby 2 months ago and looking after two kids! Don't worry about what people say, I cannot understand them, esp the women who probably have been through the same thing! My daughter is exactly 2 months older than Ayla and had the same white patch on her tongue, just gently brush with some cooled boiled water and toothbrush and it all went away! I read if you do not, then it can lead to thrush ... all the best :)
#1 - You are AMAZING! And you're so right, it took your body 9+ months to make that adorable little girl of yours and it's going to take time to heal.\n#2 - She could have cradle cap. My son had it. You just need to get a little brush and gently scrub her scalp with some soap and warm water. It will go away soon enough. \n😊💖
you look perfect ❤ and you are such an inspiration ❤
Bubz, you have two beautiful children and are beautiful just the way you are on the inside and out. I love your sweet, kind, sincere, and down-to-earth personality. God bless you, Tim, and your two little ones! Sending love and hugs your way! ♥♥
That child who new his multiples sounds adorable. XD
No joke in hongkong the kids have too much competition kid start there addition at like 2 and learn algebra at 5 or something
i see nothing wrong with your weight bubz.\nlove u
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE ISAAC WHEN HE WAS A CUTIE MARSHMALLOW BABY
You are beautiful inside and out now you will have a personal message to teach your kids.
Have the moved back to Hong Kong ?
I just remember isaac face when he was the same age as ayla, I really miss it but I am grateful that isaac now has grow up healthly. You don't have to worry about what your relatives said , you are gorgeous just the way you are.Thank you bubz for sharing your happy moment with us
Family members can be so rude... it's like yes, they are family and they are some of the most important people in our lives, but to comment on your weight then you JUST had a baby is not ok! You brought two human beings into the world for crying out loud😂 and i'm honest when i say i barely see a difference in your weight, i have been following you for 8 years :) it's only natural to get a little bigger during pregnancy and as long as one eat healthy and get a little activity in during the day that baby weight will come right off in it's time😅
halo bubz, this is my first time leaving a comment for you since I have become your supporter for a long time:D\nBread actually is not suitable to be a breakfast for everyone.\nChildren often grow up eating bread will lead to lack of concentration because it does not have nutrients...
when are you gonna change the intro
so cute😍😍😍 I like the way you and Tim teach your children. Love care.
She is so cute!
Isaac is growing so fast 😭 what a cutie
She's such a happy baby I'm so in love
This kids make my day. SOO CUTE 😍😍
Bubz you look beautiful, and your babies look so happy.
My grandma used to tell everybody, including me: 'you're fat!' while she would take a big piece of your belly or your butt to prove her point. And she would say this as a compliment, very happy that at last the kids and teens in her family put some meat on their bones... We didn't like it at all, compliment or not. But she was adorable in everything else, so... We gave her that privilege of being our personal scale.
Isaac seems to be speaking more and more, and he is so polite! He really is getting cuter and cuter by the day <3
Just tell them sometimes that is the eye opening for them I know that horrible felling
People need to stop with how one looks because everyone is made in God's image and we should Embrace our Individuality! not compare,their opinion is their opinion and it's better if they just chill out
Ah I get it a lot too....the constant you're so fat! Lose some weight! I've honestly given up trying to say no, I'm healthy! It's quite bad as I am at the age when girls feel the most vulnerable to these comments and do extreme things to make themselves perfect. However, rather than feeling crappy about it, I use it to my advantage and make jokes about it. I've been hearing the comments over and over I basically immune to it 😄
ohh Lindy,  may I know your lipstick ? that you wore in the car.  it's look so nice on you :)
bubz: who's a pretty girl?\nayla: lol das me
i will never get tired of bubz putting lotion on her babies
How old Isaac is?
Hi Bubz, been a subbie for a long time but not been much of a commentor. However just wanted to say you are doing an amazing job! The fat shaming and image expectations of HK or the asian culture is ridiculous and I admire that you are trying to not let it get to you. I recently moved to HK and I have never been skinny, had fat comments made to me all the time, mostly from relatives or family friends. Coming here has showed me that even your boss or colleagues feel they are right to comment on your weight and how you should look. It got to me but we can only shrug it off cos we can never meet these so called expectations. We can be too skinny, too fat, too tall, too short! The list goes on!
You have a beautiful family bubz . Love ya 💕 I love when Isaac says hi mummy . So sweet 😭😍
I love when you show Ayla's facials. She looks so happy and relaxed 😊😊
Isaac is such a sweetheart.
You look GORGEOUS bubz!! Dont worry about your body it created an amazing gift and blessed you with a healthy baby. It just needs time to recover
I love Isaac so much it hurts :(
Don't worry about Isaac, he will learn when he's ready. Kids develop at all different rates. I have a son just few months younger Isaac and I always kept stressing he doesn't know this or that. It's not worth it. He's a healthy, happy boy. That's all that matters.
Isaac is so sweet ^^
Congratulations with the birthdelivery of your daughter. What is she beautiful. Wish you alots joy & happiness♡
Try to wipe her tongue with glycerin it will get rid of all the residual milk
9:33 Don't hurt my mum. I'll cut you with my chin! D:<
I love you big much daddy😂❤️
I feel like Issac has grown up soo much in the past 6 months!
Hey Bubz! I just wanted to let you know that I know how you feel about weight insecurities - I'm not pregnant or have been pregnant, but I've also the same weight insecurity because of a medical condition, I've gained a lot of weight and it's hard to shed the weight because of this medical condition. Whenever I see family members, the first thing they tell me is: wah! time for you to go to the gym! or you shouldn't eat that, it's going to make you even fatter. And it's disheartening. I'm going back to my home country at the end of the year and I'm slightly dreading it, even though I'm actually looking forward to having fun.... I'm just worried about what people say :(
I am so so so so happy to see how much Isaac has progressed with his speech! He can make up sentences and talk so clearly now!
Darling you look amazing ... To tell you the truth, you look better than the petite size you was before your pregnancy. Yes some family / people are rude in personal comments towards people .. Try not let it get too Beautiful One 💛❤️💜💚
Im so tired of people bringing up peoples weight! Why is it so important for someone to be skinny or at least thinner? This woman has given birth to two beautiful children. She might not be at the weight where she wants to be, but she has gained weight because she had to eat for not just one but two humans. In which one was growing and had to be health. STOP NAGGING PREGNANT WOMEN ABOUT LOSING WEIGHT POST-PARTUM 😡
I'm Filipino, and everytime I see ny relatives, the aunts will comment on whether you gained or lost weight. They also ask about relationship status. Maybe that's an Asian thing? I just got used to it.
does issac speak only English?
Daaaang!!!! She's gorgeous!!!!!!!
<3
Isaac is so adorable.
Older family members are never held responsible for their hurtful words because others make excuses for them, such as, It's just a generation/culture thing!, or, They honestly feel like they are helping you. None of the hurtful comments will ever stop until you hold them accountable for it.
Hi Bubz, so glad you guys back to Hong Kong. I have been watched your videos for such a long time.But i was like the silent viewer ,quite shy to leave a comment.Your videos are so amazing and inspirational.It is trilled to see you guys vlogging, from seeing Tim's proposal until Ayla is born,. I really feel like being part of your family. I know Youtube has tons of youtubers but you guys are absolutely  be my favorite. I remember once you asked Tim what is the thing that he miss the most in HK, he said food!!!! Since I am currently working at yuen long ,i always looking for amazing dish for lunch , i would just killing me by not sharing the good food for you guys.Bubz i know you love dim sum you mentioned in the video back in Belfast said you didn't find a place in hk served good dim sum.I found a place call Big Belly at 教育路they did serve nice dim sum,you should try it!!!!!Anyway wish your family all the best ,healthy and happy ^^Have a nice time in Hong Kong .God bless your family .
all children develop different I wouldn't beat yourself up over lying about your sons age, I'm sure most mom's on here have told some porkies now and then. lol
小公主好可愛呀！
Where the dogs?
Bubz you're beautiful 😍
5:11 CHICKEN PAU GIMME SUM HAHA ❤

Ayla's so cute! and Isacc's so precious :D
💝💝💝💝💝💖💖💖💖💖
bubz when r u gonna release ur book !! hehe excited
I just realized that one day there will be no vlogs from the Ngs anymore. And this family will be vanished from my life. Unless the Kids continue this journey...\nKeep your fingers crossed for the future.\nI love you ❤
you are really fat these days, bubz
If you rinse out a clean wash cloth you can use it to gentle clean Lala's tongue just like teeth brushing to help with the white tongue. I used to do it once daily- gently because breast milk is so fatty :) is even do it to clean the sides of his cheeks, gum stimulation to help with milk teeth and the roof of he younger. You just gotta go slow as not to hit their gag reflex lol she's so cute!!

To the Few people who are commenting a Dislike on this song.  Keep in mind that it is a song Nahko wrote a long time ago.  This song is not indicative of where his Sound is moving too.  Nahko chose this song because it reminded him of his Friend - Paris Jackson and he wanted to capture her Pure and Natural Beauty and Inner Essence.  I Think Nahko and Crew did a Fantastic job in this..  Paris has a You Tube Channel.. You can see what she is really like.  A very down to earth young lady with a sweet soul.   I expect we will hear much more of Nahko and MFTP music that we will love as much as the other songs now and in the future 💗
So moving, totally resonate with this. You can just feel the energy through the music
thank you for this beautiful song Nahko Bear 😍 and the video music with Paris Jackson, awesome!!
Vim pela a Paris

Such a good song
This is incredible, Paris really is something else. Such a beautiful music video 💛
Love always!
Paris is so beautiful ♥ i love her.
Paris is playing this 😍❤❤
Blessings from Belgium. Paris was perfect for this video, great job brother bear!
Here for Paris my beautiful sunshine ♡
Nahko, you always make me want to cry and smile :)... your music picks me from ground many times. This song again hit my life, I finally found a girl that understand me. After year 3/4 year that i have a really bad break up, it end when it don´t have to. But now i feel happy and you make me fly in mind with my dragon fly :). You're music shaman to me and i hope this will come to you, to make your day better, as you make mine :). and to all of you, open your mind, open your heart and fly. Cuz YOU know you want to fly :)
Great video!! Paris is beautiful, I love her so much! 😘😍💖✨
So delicate and inspiring.\nAll the nature and the human connected.  Beautiful.
This video is very simple and yet so meaningful, it manages to perfectly capture a feeling of finding your place in life, being part of nature and the universe, being free and living life with all its joys and sorrows. And Paris is a beautiful human being and such a talented actress, just look at how expressive and fluid her movement is when she is dancing!
thank you so much.. I'm almost in tears its like... I see poetry and beauty only, this song is inspiring.. Paris jackson is  so full of light.  I'm in love for the art of life.
I've been away from nahko's music for a little now, maybe two weeks since i heard a song? But i was drawn to search for him today, just after a new song was released. Spooky!
I dont even understand why tears welled up and why I find this so emotional but its a great video. I love his eye.
Finally..I have been waiting for this video..Paris Jackson..WOW .She is such an amazing women..Mike is so...Proud of u babygirl😙😙😙😙
Beautiful mix of her mother and father
I hate Paris... but I love this song ❤
PARIS! MY POWER GIRL 🌻❤

:) Nahko you never disappoint me.\nSuch a beautiful song and such a beautiful video.\n\nI love you guys. All of you ♥
This is such a beautiful song as as well as video, and it is mainly or partially due because of Nahko Bear. And of course  the other part of thee success of this video as well as song, being his producer or his producers.
my dream is to collaborate a song with you. hope to one day make that possible.
Thinkyouknowmusic on Twitter brought me here.

To the few dislikers..Find your medicine and use it. \nLove this song and new video Nahko. A true blessing to see Paris beautifully happy. So inspired. Thank you for sharing your music and the message. Much Love
hello medicine tribe!  so glad to be a part of this movement as we usher in a new time and paradigm for a new generation..  Love you all!  Blessings of light on your paths.  Love you Nahkz! Thank you for the medicine.  You are such a powerful catalyst for change and a great healer.
I need some medicine right now. Active shooter 3 miles from my home tonight... two weeks ago there was one on the exit my fiancee takes to work...  why is everything so crazy?
Beatiful
You're music is a true inspiration
Finally some new medicine 😁

A survivors song.....thank you! Strength given and recieved <3
Loved it
I'm looking forward to the new album !!! Since I started listening to this group, it seems a lie, but my life changed. I have learned new things with each of their songs, they have helped me to overcome very bad moments, they have helped me to learn things, to make my life different otherwise ... Thank you very much for being there, Nahko and Medicine for the People\n\nRegarding this song, I love it, it's beautiful. I liked that someone explained to me a little what he understood with the lyrics of the song, because to this day, I'm not very clear about its meaning.\n\nThank you!\n\nMuch love and respect for all! : D
Beautiful video! Thank you!
Beautiful, thank you

PARÍS JACKSON 😭😍😍
Beautiful 💗💗
Best way to start the day!
La copia barata de The Scientist, pero con la sucia de Paris Jackson.
I like Paris Jackson (Michael Jackson's daughter) in this music video. She is a pretty girl. This was a good music video and a good song. Very relaxing. You can play this at work or in your car on the way to work to calm and center yourself. I am a music lover...trust me this is a good song. Also I heard influences 100% of The Dave Matthews Band...instantly...the voice is very much similar to Dave Mathews voice! Not bad...if your gonna be influenced by someone then let it be one of the best bands out there.
Paris is the beauty of nature personified
VEGANS save lives❤ \nI love you nahko😙😑😙
Why  not run the video in forward motion?
Paris Jackson is so beautiful.😍 Song is boring & music video was so boring.😞
Speechless.. an amazing song and very emotional the video.. i don't have enough words to explain how much i'm proud of you Paris...  your daddy is so proud of you.. thank you for everything.. a big hug♡
did the band break up?

I have this foundation and it's amazing. My skin is dry and sensitive and I would recommend it without hesitation!
I’m not gonna say it cause I’m a Christian 😂
Omg, I'm right there with you on the tiny holes and textures! It literally freaks me out and makes my skin crawl!
My kind of video!
WOW I CAN'T STOP WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS! AMAZING DARLING KEEP IT UP!
I’m so happy that I found your channel. Love your reviews
I know exactly what you was going to say 😂🤣. I get you give, i get you.
I really enjoy shopping in Sephora, and I'm starting to use more of their own brand items
I'm 12 but SUPER dirty minded, I get what you mean
23 years in the house boo :*
Youuuu are golddddddddddddddd.  What color is that lip liner??
Patricia there's a three month old fyi ~
I saw someone else use that mask and I thought the same thing. 😂. It’s one reason I won’t be trying it.   I have a thing about certain textures or whatever.   I just cannot.
You look really different without makeup on. Not saying it's a bad thing as your pretty with or without makeup. It's just unusual how different you look. Your eyes especially.
Yassss so excited for the triple uploads!! Always need more Patricia in my life!!
Old enough to get the joke😩😂💕
You’re too much 😂😂😂 with your little mind 😂😂
21 but I know older things I love the 80s and 60s
this look turned out great i love this look!
My sister and I have it... fear of holes in clusters...
Hey, I do hair and art videos ! I'm doing a FREE portrait drawing giveaway! All you have to do is subscribe to my  channel and send me a screenshot! I will follow you back too!
How come you don’t do like I spent $$ on tarte?
I bought that same Fresh Rose Toner JUST because it's pretty to look at. Can't tell u the last time I used it. It's sitting pretty on my shelf though lol

Love the final look on your face
Oh my gosh this is the first time I've watched your videos... I subscribed right away, I love you!
Commenting to try my luck for some Fenty, but I'm in Zimbabwe 😂 a girl can dream though lol. On another note; you're absolutely amazing 😊❤️
25, I can handle it lol. You have a funny, sly way to your humor
Who else was waiting for Patricia to break into her You are GOLD! Medley? Lol
*Your skin is looking SOOOO good 😍 tell us your secret lol*
I was working last week and the 'gold' song was on the radio. I heard your voice in my head and enjoyed it so much, I couln't stop laughing :)
You should do the black owned makeup challenge.
You should do a rosegal haul
Yes girl that foundation is life🙌❤️
Patricia girl I love you such a fun personality. That I regret nothing had me rolling 🤣🤣

Patricia boyfriend hold this W
I usually don't buy stuff just because a youtuber made a video about it, but yesterday i bought the dr jart mask and the sephora cream lip stain in 26 after seeing this video.
New sub.....I love your personality........
I'm 17 so you can say everything you've got 😂
This hair!!! There's no way I'm not getting a wig like this ❤️
Always beautiful whatever you wear, actually makes me want to start wearing make-up x
my fav brush is anastasia renaissance palette brush, it makes all that lines that you want, i never liked any palette brushes before that one
Anyone know What song is playing at the beginning?
I love how well u edit your videos
3:43 min “I’m a Christian” WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THE SAME OMG
I love the Sephora brand foundation-- it's about the only thing that doesn't freak my skin out, so if you have sensitive skin/combination, it is WONDERFUL.
Patricia I would like to ask you something in regards my personal experience, maybe you have had the same experience. I was wondering if there's private message on her thanks x
Patricia!! Please tell us where you got the wig from cos you look good girl!!
Go ahead and say it.. I'm a Christian but this looks like jizz.. it's true.. that's the secret to the glow
Where is she from she has a beautiful accent
i am 13 i know what it looked like though
'I need to look RICH... in colour and in life' wauuuw. Ain't that the truth🤷🏾‍♀️
I'm all in with your jokes 😂
Great video! I love watching your kinda make-up /grwm video. You are beautiful
@patriciabright I’m so happy to be a subbie! Especially when you do the try ons with the clothes! Girl you make my day! I get a laugh with the facial expressions you do with the likes and dislikes... before I shop at Sephora I checked this video out! Thanks, Your subbie!

Omgggg Patricia sameeee i have trypophobia
I'm 11
I love your lippie in the main video.  What color/brand is it?
Them being cousins makes way more since than them being sisters, Nice video!
Here's a question I want answered and it's about Toy Story 3. The monkey looks over the woody and everyone else by a security camera right. And the whole point of a security camera is record things like break ins and fires right, so the camera must be recording 24/7. So why hasn't the person who looks over the footage not see toys locking in other toys in shelves?
what happened to that theory that Elsa is Rapunzels sister?
😱😱The flower part in Moana is mind blowing!!
If fire weren't an option, I would definitely go with the ice powers.
Hey Carlin Brothers!!!! I happen to notice that you guys didn't do a Harry Potter video having to do with a lot of things being in 7's. There are 7 books, 7 quidditch players, 7 floors in Hogwarts, etc. This needs to be explained!!!!!!!!
U should make a theory bout a connection of UP and IT
Dear stars we are just making a Pixar theory with Disney movies now aren't we? \nWonderful. Let's link the Marvel universe to Treasure Planet now. \n\nI'm not being sarcastic let's do it.
Answer to the question: Neither. I wanna teleport. If I get ice powers, I will freeze the world and hold it hostage until someone can give me teleporting powers.
Ya know how Ben said, “Gosh, why can’t Olaf just be related to someone else in the Disney universe?” Well he technically kills his brother if ya think about it.... I mean since Elsa is kind of like his mom since she made him and she also made the snow monster guy Olaf and Snowball would be brothers. So Ben technically Olaf WAS related to someone else in the Disney universe.
Ice powers. Becuase Elsa can do way more than just control ice. She can change people's outfits. She can change her makeup. She can make her hair pass through her shoulder.
It took me half the video before I realised he changed shirts LOL
Did you know the location in frozen is based on the norwegian terrain. By the way norway kind of suck
In toy story of terror, there is an accepts bnl credit card sticker
Ice powers, I like to keep my hair short lol
Ice\nLike if you agree
I was thinking about how disney parents are dead but rapunzel's, merida's and mulan's parents aren't dead
I don’t understand something about the Tarzan theory. If they where going to a wedding in the German kingdom of Corona departing from the Scandinavian kingdom of Arendelle than why the heck did their ship crash in Africa?\n\n\n\nP.S. It’s totally a German kingdom with names like Rapunzel, Eugene Fitzherbert, and Mother Gothel.
TARZAN IS NOT RELATED to the sisters! I'm calling bullshit on the director's part. It literally doesn't make sense. Fight me.
....The Tarzan thing is them trolling you. Was I the only one who watched the Making of Frozen extra which was just one long musical number asking that then ending in We don't know!? That was when I realized that Disney, especially the people involved in Frozen, had learned how to troll and not to trust them. Which doesn't even touch on things like hair color not being the same...\n\nThat said, I do kinda like the cousin idea. It makes more sense and it's interesting.
They've done this before...\n But I can still appreciate it!
They're European royalty. They're going to be cousins. Every Dynasty is related in some way.
Anna and Elsa CAN'T be related to Tarzan!!  They come from completely different time periods!  The Tarzan movie has black and white photos from cameras and metal ships powered by steam engines!!  Frozen has paintings and wooden ships.
I just wanted to say that i love your videos! They are so thoughtout and amazing! Keep up the great work guys!
I like the theory but what's going on with the editing?
I literally have 2 pet chickens named Anna and Elsa.
Film Theory already covered this theory a year ago\nSo, 2 theorists cannot make 2 separate theories about the same subject? That's suddenly an illegal thing to do?\nBecause if that were the case, theorizing has just become very boring.
Ice powers, hands down. I live in a warm area but I used to live in a cold area... I miss snow...
I would love to have magic ice powers, I would build a giant ice castle and make magic snowmen to do my bidding.
Make a theory on the golden compass (the northern lights)
I like the film theorists theory about Elsa being adopted and rapunzel being sisters better
If Elsa has ice powers does that mean she's always cold? ._.
I DARE you to tell this to MatPat I DARE u
Hehe I love using dad's account
You become a prince if you marry a Queen. Even if you don’t have any previous title.
How did Voldemort get his little fetus body up until the end of Goblet of Fire? Did Wormtail steal an actual baby for Voldemort to inhabit? Or was the body something Voldemort could create himself?
Are J and Ben twin? And which is older?
Have you watched once upon a time frozen arc where Elsa & Anna's mother is confirmed a princess of aredelle and had two older sisters. Ingrid the eldest was the crown princess by Elsa's mom trapped her in a vase because of her fear of her ice powers that accidentally killed their other sister.
Tarzan's parents were killed by a leopard, NOT a jaguar. I sort of see the connection for frozen and Tarzan, definitely see tangled and frozen, making Rapunzel and Tarzan cousins. Hard to wrap my brain around it
Ice powers no question. We have hospitals, and Elsa can create sentient beings out of ice.
Long Live King Ben!!
Wait...you guys...haven't covered this yet?
AYYYYY!!!!!! SUPER CARLIN BROTHERS SHOULD DO THE MINNIE AND DONALD BABY THEORY
Ice powers love this theory think it is true
REACT TO MY VIDEOS! Please?? I need more views to get known and I think you will like my songs!
Actually you would be prince ben
No, you wouldn't be just Ben, you would be prince Ben. The rules is't that you keep your title, it's that you get the title that's UNDER the one you marry. If there IS a king then he will be the leader but if there isn't a king then the queen will be in charge instead, and you can't just marry into being the leader of a country so if a man marries the queen he will become the closest he can get to a king, which is a prince... Sorry for the bad explanation lol...
has anyone seen the connection between the new TMNT and SRMTHFG? Namely, the genie episodes? would love to see someone else catch that theory with me! ;D
In toy story 3 Ken has a surprisingly huge collection of cloths that just couldn’t have come with only one Ken; how many kens do you think Ken had destroyed/got rid off in the past
No you would become prince or prince consort
Hey guys what do you think of the new Disney cartoons like the ducktales reboot and tangle the series?
Have you guys seen the theory that Anna actually does have magical powers, super strength, but their parents just passed it off as super clumsiness instead ?
I live in Phoenix, I'll take the ice powers and slash my summer electric bill.
I'd choose the ice powers. I don't tend to get injured, much, nor does anyone I have physical access to. I live in Australia, so the ability to summon cold to offset the horrible heat of summer would be great.
But if the flower from Moana is the golden flower, doesn't that defeat your Hercules theory? Polynesia is pretty far from Greece, you know?
Should we uhh use once upon a time into Disney theories...... Pronly not cause then everyone would we related XD (Henry's family tree thoooo)

Hey, I got a theory for you that has bothered me. In the 1st Harry Potter movie we see that Harry is staying with his AUNT and UNCLE. Why not his nanny and grandad? Why his aunt and uncle specifically?
Wait. The Tarzan one was confirmed? I thought several people had debunked it
I like the idea of Tarzan and the Frozen sister's being siblings, but the times don't make sense. Frozen/Tangled take place in the 1840s, where as Tarzan takes place in the 1910s. So unless their parents lived another 40ish years on the island before having Tarzan (putting them anywhere between 60 and 80) and then dying, it's not very likely. Of course that would put Tarzan in his 30s during the time of the movie, meaning his parents dying in 1880s. I don't know how old truly was in the film, but those are the times that make them most sense. Sorry Carlin Brothers, the facts don't lie
yep, you're right ben, hot pockets are hotter then the FRIGGEN SUN!\n#triggered
Hopefully will get more hint and connections in Tangled Before Ever After.
Why do I see the Happy Death Day ad on a SuperCarlinBrothers Frozen theory? This does not match.
Wait - what if it is ELEMENTS not MAGIC. What if Moana us the missing element? Anna made a fire to defeat the wolves, Elsa has ice powers, MOANA IS GOOD WITH WATER
okay, at first I was disappointed because this felt like old news, but then I looked up the video I thought you guys made, and it was FilmTheory. Sorry, guys. I do wonder what your thoughts are on their theory though.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhf9dekzyq4

Anna, Rapunzel, Elsa = ARE
Dude ur editing us slipping
So Repunzel is related to Anna and Elsa who are Tarzan sisters and unconfirmed part is the boat the parents were on is the one Arial explored.
Have you seen the theory that Elsa and Rapunzel are sisters and not Anna and Elsa? \n\nIt's a rabbit hole, but a FUN rabbit hole. It suggests that after rapunzel was kidnapped, the king and queen sent her twin sister away to live with her aunt and uncle. They feared she too would be kidnapped for her magical abilities.  So they sent her away to keep her safe and a secret.
Nope. Still with the the theory that Elsa a d Repunzel are siblings and Anna is their cousin.
I thought Anna and Elsa weren't sisters and Rapunzel and Elsa were. Honestly there's way more evidence over on Film Theory and more stale memes\n\n\n\nStill love SuperCarlinBrothers though, you do make other awesome theories
How are Anna and Elsa  even sisters? One has powers, ICE POWERS, and the other had the powers of love <3
I know that
Black mirror causes empathy toward those who we would at first argue don't deserve it\n or takes away are empathy towards those who we thought deserved it\n\nSomeone who has watched the episode will find themselves often arguing with people who have only heard the premise
I'm such a massive fan of black mirror. I would to hear your commentary on each episode.
Nice video, wow I didn't know blue Apron has soooo much plastic packaging, that's horrible.
Best show ever Black Mirror
So much talk so little said. Unsubbed
It was so much better when it was directed at a British audience.
can you please do a video on Revisionist History by Malcolm Gladwell
With the one bright spot being my sweet perfect 80's Lesbians
I need to watch things die - from a good safe distance \nVicariously I live while the whole world dies
I'd argue that we do enjoy tragedy in real life, not always, but often.
Bulllfighting is the culmination of this - death is an actor - death visits the stage.
I like it mostly for its thought provoking , high technological future subject.\n , the idea of a virtual heaven? To live withA homunculus with your loved ones dead memories and personality just for your sake?( this one was the most for me cuz its relatable) , man , there's nothing to not love about this series.
The first episode was the only episode that really got me. You think it starts out as a joke but in the end you feel really really bad jus tlike the citizens in the show.
Can someone who likes the show help me out with a question?\nI haven't seen the show. But looking at this video, I can see that, obviously, it invokes a lot of heavy emotions, it looks beautiful, it seems very original,... but. It also seems a lot like torture-porn? \n\nLike, look how miserable we can make those people, and how they don't deserve it, and how they can't get out and it's depressing and disgusting. Watch how we can take all kinds of people and put them through all kinds of crap. Enjoy how they get emotionally broken! Be amazed at how _original_ the torture is, too! \nObviously that will make me feel heavy emotions. It still feels like a sort of Hunger Games. Torture porn on the next level; not with (or solely with) physical torture, but with elaborate psychological schemes/happenings. Saw in pretty, for the intellectual!\n\nAgain I want to point out that I haven't seen BM. I'm _not_ judging it. This is just the impression I've got from this video, but considering some of the people who love it I think that this can't be quite true. (The show's probably really good even.) So, anybody like the show and want to 'defend' and explain it a little to me, please? :D
Because Charlie Brooker is a fucking genius that's why.
fuck your sponsors go to a supermarket
Once again, SO GOOD
at 0:55 the caption says fifteen million merits, Season 3 Episode 6 but it is actually Season 1 Episode 2
Can anyone tell me which season the GOT spoilers are? I’m on 5.5
Here is the thing. \nI had never heard of Black Mirror until you posted this video. I clicked Watch Later and started watching them on Netflix. I just finished the last episode. \n1. I didnt want any spoilers \n2. Well there isnt a 2 other than to say there isnt a two\nI sure am glad i didnt watch this until after I was done!  Which ive seen every single one of your videos so I knew enough not to watch unit i was ready. \nGreat video btw. As always. \nAny more great shows i havent heard of you want to tell me about????  I am now kinda sad that i binged watched the fucking awesomeness that was BLACK MIRROR? I NEED MORE!!!!
What is the name of the song that comes on at 6:55???? It is the same song from the episode.. A Million Merits.. the theme... pleaseeeeeeee help.
Please do a video on A Ghost Story
0:56 Fifteen Million Merits is the second episode of the first series.
I couldn't get past the first episode, not my cup of tea
I thought the sponsored bit at the the end of the video was a lead up to something really dark and messy. It wasn't. And thereby totally ruining the actual message of the whole video.
Black Mirror is disgusting. A show entirely based on covering the deepest depravity of humanity. Shows like this should not exist.
I don't get why Black Mirror is so revered. I don't think it's clever. You know how each episode is going to end. Badly. You know your going to watch character A go through situation X, and the opposite of desrired outcome Z is going to happen and in the rare cases where Z does occur it never justifies X. There. Black Mirror explained in a word formula.
I love your videos man! Great work as well. Only this time I don't understand why you mention that Black Mirror doesn't evolve around the concept of Catharsis? I think it is fundamentally based on that concept as almost every hero of every episode is, in the end, subdued to the process of facing the consequences of it's own actions. With a tragic end in most cases as they couldn't avoid their fate, that they themselves created. Would love to understand more what you mean. Thanks!
well thanks. i will safely skip this show if i happen to stumble upon it. the idea of convening meaningless tragedies is not new. always wonder whether it's a good thing or not. never been my thing...\ni thought game of thrones was about families fighting? may have to skip it too
That's why I don't like the highly praised San Junipero, as much as it is a beautiful a story, it's the least Black mirrorish episode of the whole show.
Could you do one like this on Bojack Horseman?
1:21 That spelling mistake, though...
Hey Nerdwriter, can I subtitle some of your videos into Turkish and post them ? credits to you of course
Oh, shut the fuck up.
Fuck. Being spoiled by this video is a Black Mirror episode itself. P.S. Blue Apron would be å great title for this.
PhillyD brought me here. GREAT VIDEO!! But where was the BB spoiler?
Black Mirror’s episodes don’t remind of tragedies like Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, or Antigone, but it very much reminds me of 1984. Those first three plays end with a closure and you feel the characters like Macbeth, the Capulets and Montagues, and Oedipus got what they deserved in some way. But in 1984 and Black Mirror there is no satisfaction and no one really gets what they deserve.
I'll get the family deal for one person
Ever Heard of spoiler alerts ?
It deals with a lot of cruel and unusual punishment. Having one’s memory wipes every day and tortured for people’s entertainment? Indefinitely?? Forced to literally spend a million years in complete isolation with nothing? That was especially fucked up considering that he was a good guy and only did what he did because of impulsive, angry behavior. Also, what good does it do to punish someone’s copy for millennia when the organic version’s still locked up? What are they going to do to the original? Such technology could be used for so much good yet here it is used for ruthless torture and the enslavement of sentient intelligences. That’s why this is so dark.
SEASON 4 PLEASE CMON
shit you're good
need to do babydriver
can you next time speak on gameof thrones spoilers smh? please use a warning... not cool
I... Didn't... Know... That.... The dude from braking bad died.... Fucksakes
To me it seems that Black Mirror is all flash with no substance. The writers are very good at coming up with imaginative scenarios around technology and it's possibilities, but they all boil down to the same overused trope. It's lacking in the nuances and details that make a really exceptional show. I really think the draw of the show is less that it's genius, and more that it is avante garde. \n\nBasically, the draw of black mirror is the same as under age drinking. It's only fun because it feels rebellious.
I love your videos!
The episode with Domhnall Gleeson ended happily. She was able to put her feelings for him away like a box of keepsakes. She still loved him, her child as well, but they knew that the 'man' in the attic was an approximation.
Pleasure is not the only human motive
REVIEW BLADERUNNER 2049 PLEASE I LOVE YOU ABSOLUTELY
At 0:56, Fifteen Million Merits is credited as being the sixth episode in the third series; it's the second episode of the first series.\n\nI think it's telling that there were few, if any, clips from The Waldo Moment used.  To me that's the only bad episode of the series to date.
unrelated, but please do a video on BLADE RUNNER 2049... I just watched the movie and would love to hear your opinion on it.
Blue Apron is fucking bullshit. Just buy your groceries it's so much cheaper.
How can bb and got still be spoiled at this point.
I dont say thank you because, because of you a what all the black mirror, with, at the end, a bad taste... but it work
Black Mirror is not a tragedy, unless not getting what you want is tragic. It is about the darkest implications of technology, the limitations of using technology as a substitute for reality. Comparing it to Game of Thrones is just odd. Black Mirror is not about tragedy so much as it's about trying to overcome loss and the limitations, shortcomings and consequences. A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.
It wasn't to underage kids, that what the other guy did and Kenny was too shocked to disagree and clear it up before they fought to the death
Is this like Outer Limits?
Maybe now that you can cook you could stop using Blue Apron b/c that company creates so much waste.
My favourite episode of black mirror is the Christmas special season 2 because it makes you think the most about how blackmailing can be used for good but the consequences of it to
Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...
I actually really regret watching black mirror, it just lingers as a dark spot i my mind. I think that if we want honesty, there is plenty to go around, but in entertainment this is just not for me at least. (Not meaning all honesty, but the total display of parade of tragedies) This does not make the show inherently bad, but I do think that for many people like myself, we just do not want or need to occupy our time with it. I don't find it challenging or developing in any way, it has just conjured grief and unease. \n\nI still loved your composition of the video, and I am a huge fan of your content. I just wanted to give you maybe a (less intellegent, less researched and shortly formulated) different view on it.
I personally watch it because it reflects our own society through a distorted lens (a black mirror, you could say)
We don't like hearing about tragedies in real life.\n\nYou know that's a lie. People get amped up. News outlets go crazy with all the sensation. It's a circus. People LOVE tragedy, it's just faux paus and socially damaging to admit it.\n\nYou don't admit it because being a personality is how you eat, and how people perceive you determines how well you eat.
I'm sure Nerdwriter is not unaware of the irony of the content of this video and the sponsor of the video. \n\nI hope people can learn to go to the market and find their own ingredients. Perhaps think for themselves.
Very disappointing analysis. It's like the guy didn't capture any of the ethical implications in any of the episodes within black mirror
the add at the end was disgusting. promoting something that produces so much garbage in form of plastic bags for produce that needs no wrapping makes me sick
Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you’ve read it by now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I’ll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\n\nSo I feel like you’re slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don’t have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don’t need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist’s fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of “Shut up and Dance” when Kenny is caught by the police.\n\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \n\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in “Men Against Fire.” Seneca’s plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.
you should try the leftovers.\n\n\n\n\nso goddamn depressing..
Warning! Game of Thrones spoiler alert. Almost threw my phone at the wall when I saw it. I'm only on season 3 of G.O.T.
All people are asking for is a spoiler alert. No one is asking you to move a fucking mountain. Damnnit Evan. And I really liked you and your content but if this is how it's gonna be from now on, I will never watch a Nerd Writer vid ever. Unsubbed and disliked. Fucking asshole
Why would anyone wanna watch this?
This made me start watching it, and I love it soooo much ❤️ its awesome
How come you never made a video on Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes)? Contrasting Black Mirror is a dark comedy delightful to watch
On the topic of television series you should definitely cover twin peaks
It's the kind of tragedy Dostoyevsky wrote - very human and very universal, while incredibly in tune with the darker potentialities of society and the world at the time of the writing. He predicted the terrors of Communism that befell Russia almost 30 years before Lenin with incredibly precision. \n\nWhat really screws with my mind about Black Mirror is that it is probably an accurate prediction of the future in certain aspects - and now things change much, much faster than in the late 19th century, so we can see the full-blown reality of some of the predictions the show makes extremely soon. \n\nIt taps into the depths of out psychology and I love it and fear its predictive power because of that.
its probably because its black
Can you PLEASE do a video on how women are portrayed and/or represented in movies? PLEASE
Why do we watch black mirror? Maybe it's not interested in catharsis. Sometimes there's this curiosity within us. To see these unseen tales. To experience this fresh dose of emotion maybe good or bad, Like to be carried on a Rollercoaster. Yes  we are prompted to think and recollect. But why do we watch black mirror... Sometimes it's that morbid curiosity we all have. Something I believe should be controlled. There's lot of good that some shows bring us but here in these tragedies if we just look for a story to tell at tables because its raw, its curious. Then that curiosity will lead you down the wrong road.
You think black mirror is just about entertainment through tragedy? Not mirroring our societal flaws? Human psychology that can be scary
that blue apron ad at the end was jarring as hell man. wtf
I hate black mirror! It's too too dark for me
FUCK YES, I love this show. Thank you for this.
Man everyone makes these faces of tragedy (infinite reincarnations!)
Best show ever

I feel like so many beauty channels shy away from saying negative things about the brand TARTE and I appreciate how honest you are about why you didnt like the product... (i.e. not just bashing a brand or product but giving a reason behind it so we as consumers can see if the product might not be a good purchase for us!) Sending love from the U S of A lol
The burning with the makeup remover wipes happened to me too!
' I don't like it, I fucking hate it, move on, cya ' 😂😂😂😂

Hey life noggin, can the ocean get struck by lightning and if so why do people not get electrocuted while swimming?
Little things means a lot. :)
I love all the insects they also make great pets I have a colony of Dubia roaches they are  simple to care for you guys should get some :)
Please make Why is the ocean salty?
I always need to go to the doctor when I get a misquote bite because all of those misquotes in my area have the disease
Doesn't everyone know this?
All we need are bees
As long as they stay away from me I won't kill them 😐.
Humanity will finally have peace
What about the ugly insects...
I still don’t see the point of cockroaches, or fleas, or ticks, or...(insert shudder)...bedbugs.
Why are the fruit-flys alive??
What if dinosaurs still existed
If the sun doubled in Mass, (throwback) would mars or Jupiter's moons be in the new habitable zone?
What will happen if all roaches died
If the moon Dissapeared or Exploded
Why do we see stars not in the sky in your eyes
I love your videos
If you drained the entire ocean of its water, and only its water, how much salt would be left over?
Bugs r still so creepy even if they help us humans out 🕷😣
Can you make a video about what would happen if rhe sun got smaller?
do what would happen if we had 2017 technology in 1900s
why dont we kill all the bad ones? like the thingy?
just kill ticks and laces...then our dog and our head would live in peace.
What if outer layer of universe is destroyed
Only an idiot thinks getting rid of spiders is a good thing.
what about a question for next video like 'why do some people where glasses'
Kill bug! (But not bee and butterfry)
Hey Blocko, I have a question. Why does music seem to play faster at night?
I'd say get rid of everything but ants and bees. The rest of insects are jerks.
what would happen if all bugs died?\nwe would die.\nconclusion\ndont kill bugs even though the scare the but out of me and I'm afraid of spiders and my mom has to kill them all, well um.. anyways.
Would still be worth
Make a video on if All dogs died,the benefits of onions and what will happen if we replaced water with assorted drinks
I eat crickets. They're good. Taste like chicken nuggets if I eat them whole.
My life thanks you
Bugs r so cool tho, why ppl are afraid of a creature thousands of times smaller than them I will never know
why do you put bees in the video they are not bugs
i didn't really consider the argument at first, but there are more to insects than i first thought, kill all wasps, fleas and mosquitoes, as they dojnt help the world, but leave cockroaches, they aren't really comman in, well whatever the name of the planet im from. space wasps are horrible!
Do a video about are animals ticklish
This is but a small price to pay to destroy the insect race.
#Dont forget to keep on thinking
WRONG ANSWER!!!, if all the bugs died, there would be no more glitches
So the character that talks is in a different world?
Bee are so critically important if they go we go, yikes!
I think bugs are a little cool now.
And if the world never died
kill off all mosquitoes(all blood sucking insects) roaches flies and spiders and i will be grateful
It,s no use!!!
I wish spiders will become extinct
Just get rid of mosquitoes and roaches.
And jurassic park wouldn't exist
Why the farmer had to be black 🤔🤔👀
If a species dies there will be a domino effect and other species may die. But, what about back then a long time ago? Some species became extinct but it did not kill any other species. So it may be possible if all the bugs die, other species may not go all extinct or just few animals or species may go extinct but not a lot.
What if there is a lot of insects
The answer to human extinction
Cockroaches sometimes reminds me of a pe*is
0:03\nBlocko : I was talking to my animator yesterday\nCaption : I took a visit to your human world the other day\n\nLol what Blocko said isn't as the same as the caption
Do a video on what would happen if humans could use 100% of their brains
Do a video on why do we get head headaches
Well FINALLY some one under stands me about cockroaches i  litterally told my brother the exact same thing,they look like aliens
Where do our last names come from?
Also, I for one think all insects are interesting and amazing. Even mosquitos and cockroaches, every little bug plays a big role in life. I am not afraid of a small bug anyway. I even picked up insects when I was young.
just watch the bee movie
1:09 a old black Luigi

Fleas, ticks, and mosquitos is the only species that should be wiped out.
2:13 hey i know him
Poor cockroaches they don't do anything😥
How many galaxies are they?
Why do we laugh when we are getting tickled? Why do we only feel the tickle on certain parts of our body?
What happens if humans vanished
Haha, incite
We need diseases, it mitigates overpopulation
I just wish mosquitos will bug ofd sometimes...
Lofe noggin why do trees grow vines

Am I the only one here that actually prefers to be alone for an extended period of time?
social media doesn’t help with this in modern times. we need to understand a lot of thoughts aren’t put into words, and everyone has felt negative emotions. you are not alone.
We might be in different struggles but for anyone going through this I know for damn sure you dont hate people and just want to do good and do good for others dont make life's mistakes fool you because those mistakes speak louder in your head than any other insult people would say . For anyone going through any kind of self destructive depression I have a clear goal for you be selfless , the more you do to help others, the more you set aside your trials and failures, the more you have room for memories and moments you will enjoy life
I feel lonely and odd because I'm lonely and odd.
Because Jesus isn't in their heart without him you'll feel empty. Triggered comments put below👇👇👊
yeah.. Just like checking out your vagina with a mirror when you're alone
School of life should do a literature video on Anthony Burgess/ F Scott Fitzgerald/ or like John Wyndham or HG Wells they've all got a form of literature with meaning
I just want to thank you for all the videos you do and the hardwork you put in them. I really enjoy them. Also, the essays you write , i read them when i wake up for school and they always get me thinking. Keep up the good work 💛
Maybe you think you know yourself but your mama thinks she knows better but your psychiatrist says you're both wrong then the priest says nah you're all clueless...none knows the 100% truth so there is no such thing as you...or they ..just an idea
Plain and Simple, Start a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ and let him fill your heart, Never let your flesh control you which are focused more on the world which is the pride and lust and sex, drugs and alcohol, Etc.\n\nMoney and possessions and lust won't fill your heart and you will never experience life and peace and joy and everlasting life unless you come to repentance and get to learn of Lord Jesus Christ and let him enter your heart and when that does happen, What a great blessing it is Amen, Not even wicked people and satan and his demons can't do anything about it because God of Israel is mighty and strong and in control, Never doubt the Father from the heavens and know that he is for you and not against you.\n\nThis society, lifestyle, This system in countries and schools and teachings and knowledge and possession and money and religions around the world isn't from God, Their from man, Man made, True Relationship with Lord Jesus Christ is where the truth is at, You only have to be willing to run into the Father's mighty arms and let him embrace you and let him change your heart brand new through the blood of Lord Jesus Christ, Spiritually amen.\n\nIf you take Jesus out of your region you won't be safe, You take his commandments down and don't even keep it, Your in danger, you continue to mixture yourself with demons that only want to bring you down with them in the Lake of fire and be destroyed, You are in grave danger that only in Jesus name is able to break and destroy the devil strong holds and evil curses as well, Nothing is too hard for the Lord, They all tremble before God because He is mighty and strong and soon destroy them, And how terrifying it will be if you made that choice to join along foolishly in their greater damnation, Jesus brings True liberty and salvation and sweet victory, America, and all these things won't give you anything, Your life is only rough and hard because you choose not to listen to the Father calling, He is able to bring you up and you will supplied and will be blessed, As long as you keep following Jesus and not yourself and this world Amen.\n\nYou people laugh and smirk and think evilly before God, you people, don't you know that God has not forgotten what you did wrong? your not safe and will never be, But God is being very patient and merciful for you because he loves you unconditionallay, Get away from wickedness you people, No matter what color or race, You are made in the image of God physically and spiritually, You cannot escape from God's mighty judgment, he will judge the righteous and the wicked, The righteous will have life but the wicked will perish, Turn to the  Father you people no matter how your situation is, Come to him if not then God will be far from you and you will cry and none will hear, You will call for help but none will help, You people how long will you anger God? he loves you just get up and be serious about your life, CALL UPON JESUS NAME and let him deliver you and draw near to God and he will draw near to you and you will be reborn again and then will your cry and it will be heard from the Father, he will deliver you and when call upon him for his help and he will deliver you and help you, when you are in pain and trouble, Child don't let sorrow break you, The Father loves you for all things have a purpose and he will take vengeance for you, You see these sad people child, don't be bitter and do not let hate overtake you and never let go of love, Lust ain't love throw that away, Lift up True Love inside your heart Child and that's Lord Jesus Christ, look to the Father and let him help you, In the end, your painful experience is a blessing and it will shine bright, All souls belong to Jesus, never doubt the father, You people how long will you choose to follow evil and not Good? Don't waste your life and your purpose God has created you for, don't waste yourself for folly things that are pointless if it won't encourage you and bring you closer to Jesus and bring your faith to shine more, it is not worth it, Following Jesus is amen, He will comfort you and wipe your tears and remind you of his unfailing love for you, For He is your true father from above in the heavens amen, He is a Father to the fatherless, don't mess with them because if God hears their precious cries and tears then you will be destroyed, God is a judge for the widows, Don't mess with them because God will judge you and you'll be in great trouble, God is an Awesome and Fair God, God of Israel Amen.\n\nIf there's no love which is Jesus, Then people will error greatly and follow their own way and it may seem good outside and they may try to use history to back up their foolish imaginations, but inside them, it isn't the truth, neither is it good, And Good works will never be enough to enter into the Kingdom of God only through Lord Jesus Christ, who paid our debt and did it for us, You only have to believe and have Faith, not belief and your feelings those are entirely different from Faith and believing, having a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ who is God is the Good news and the Truth Amen.\n\nThere are sad people on this world that rather reject God and go after the world which is pointless and no hope for them unless they be willing to turn to the Father, Jesus can change a wicked sinner into a beautiful, clean saint, And how beautiful it is indeed, You won't learn from anything from this video neither anything else but from God's words alone, The Holy Bible King James Bible Amen, You have to take everything from God's words literally and ask for Jesus for Guidance and help in his words and you will see, You will understand that others will not because everyone is different and unique, Just like the stars God created for example, Each having names and each being very unique and beautiful, But for you, You are much more to God then the Stars, God of Israel Loves You Unconditionallay and you will always be important to God but if you continue to live in sin, Don't do it, Go any deeper and there will be no hope for you and there will be no way for you to come to repentance, But it is never too late right now while there is still time, Jesus is able to restore the soul and deliver everyone from falling, You only need to look deep into God's words and learn from him Amen.\n\nWhat will you do? Get up and get away from being comfortable to this world, Living for Jesus Christ is worth it Amen, There are greater things ahead that this world will never understand but only in Jesus alone, God knows your heart and there's no hiding anything from him, You can hide in a cave but that still won't hide yourself from him, It's a very very very terrible, Dreadful and terrifying experience to be standing against a Strong and Powerful Living God who created you and form you with a purpose, But how a great blessing and beautiful it is to stand with our True Father God who is Mighty and Strong, God can do the impossible and never doubt him, He's GOD OF THE LIVING! GOD OF ISRAEL AMEN.
I needed this right now, thanks for helping me feel better :)
Because you hang out in front of your computer all day!
I think you're wrong with this one, School of Life. Sometimes you just have to cope with realizing that you're odd. Sometimes trying to connect with people on a deeper level is great for realizing that their insides are different from what they portray externally, but it's also great for realizing that who they are internally is still very different from who you are internally. Sometimes you really are just odd and you have to embrace that.
Feedback: been subscribed for about two years now. I wish you guys would make more videos that feature actors or even real world scenarios. Actually I also loved your videos about the great philosophers... if there aren't any of them left to do then what about other notable artists or famous people like, I dunno... JFK, Martin Luther King or Lady Gaga.
I like the love illustration. Who did it?
For me it doesn't help that my parents have told me when I overreact or don't react normal/properly to simple things such as when I feel annoyance or sadness or hate. I once became so upset with a person because they tricked the teachers, lied multiple times a day, and yet they were proud of this and others did not seem to think badly of them. My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).
Reminds me of we judge others on their actions, and judge ourselves on our intentions
Uhhhhh I know I'm odd... I have sex with dogs... that's pretty disgusting in everyone else's view points... but I find that eating animals out of enjoyment is disgusting... I could never eat pork or pig... I do eat chicken but I always feel sad and guilty while eating it for needed nourishment to help my skin disease.. :(
art? not so sure abut that. especially with it being so subjective.
Loneliness is that feeling to be stranger; the fact is that we're all strangers to each other. We live between two worlds; the inside and the outside, if you focus in the one of the inside, you'll fall in anxiety, depression and anguish and if you just focus in one of the outside you'll lose your confidence in yourself and you fall in the same illness. The other is a book, be courageous and go to the library and chose a book. Open it and start reading. We're all strangers.
This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all. Neither has love.
Such as amazing Channel. They  never teach this in school. And if so , it feels to technical (Lack of feeling and association. Like robots). \n\nThis channel deserves more subs like 7 billion!
Please translate it to Arabic
You have got a very limited set of topics for your videos. I feel like i've watched this one already five times. Also I wonder how lonley and odd you feel Alain de Botton, and weather talking about it over and over again helps you with it. Hearing about it over and over again sure doesn't help me a lot.
1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\n\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\n\n( Die Normalsten sind die kränkesten und die Kranken sind die gesündesten. )\n\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \n\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\n\n Well, isn't that good news??\n\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \n\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\n\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \n\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \n\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\n\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \n\n\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \n\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\n\n You are human beings nonetheless.\n As far as one can see\n Of the same species as myself \n\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\n\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!
This describes me too  well
I feel lonely because I lost all my friends when they left to different colleges.
This explains why I'm honest and blunt with my character.\nMy character helps people be more comfortable being themselves around me.
This video gives points that are completely subjective. How does this shit get on trending? Who did you pay?
I deeply and truly appreciate these videos and this narrator's work.
Can you do a Literature episode about Balzac?
I don't agree with this silly generational we are all ultimately the same, share the same experiences, the same thoughts and feelings. I talk to people lots and meet very few who have same or similar thoughts, feeling and experiences as me.
worship 1 GOD, \nVerily only with the remembrance of god do hearts find peace-Quran
ive learned i enjoy life a hell of a lot more on my own.  im happy being lonely!!
What a coincidence. I just watched a video from SciShow Psych on a very similar feeling. They called it imposter syndrome. It's a feeling of inadequacy in successful people and thinking their success was only based on luck and that other people deserve more admiration than they do. I think you mentioned it at one point in the video.
Birth we come alone. Death we leave alone.
Thanks School of Life, this video was timed well.
Tis is probably the best channel i found on YouTube. It truly speak loud and effectively .. thank you.
I AM NOT LONELY! I FEEL SO ATTACKED BY THIS
Another pretentious video. We feel odd because life is fucking strange it's that simple.
Because we have no God.
I will have to rewatch that several times to really get the idea behind this animation. For now I can tell, these are some beautiful illustrations!
I feel like you guys are rehashing your old stuff
no because of society
because we are odd and alone
This is so accurately and beautifully expressed
Hello friends, have a great day, love you
This is why reading introspective literature is so important! This is reading Kafka, ladies and gentleman! Then you can easily imagine what others in you life are going through and how they are in the inside, which is very much like yourself, which is very comforting.
Really? But I use mINS reading and individualism. I simply don't care what people think and expose my true self as much as possible.
the sketch was kinda depressing :/
man, I don't know how you choose your topics, but please keep up what you're doing.\none of the best channels on youtube.
I have spent 5 years listening to the inner reality of women's lives. http://www.collectingconversations.com Our stories may differ but we are very similar.
Truly beautiful animations! I loved when the lead character turned off the light to reveal everyone else’s deep, neon mysteries.
Life every day is happy or sad thats your life you should choose to take one of this in your life be successful and dont forget me
Is it ok to think that we should act fake so we don't put others down or bore them? I feel like we are our own individuals and that we can choose how we want to feel, but a lot of people do not think that way and expect others to entertain them or serve their interest the way they want.
I feel lonely because I decided to ditch my toxic friends and ex-partner. Now I'm too busy turning my life around studying uni via correspondence in the small rural town I live in to make friends with people I have nothing in common with. So for now, until I meet other people passionate about Science, I am lonely.
Moral of the video. Don’t care what people think because we all go through the same inner battle we try to fight
Well shit... looks like one of those solutions is hopeless for me... -_-
It's hard to make new friends when you have none because you forgot how.
Hi School of Life. Can you write an essay regarding gratification excesses found mostly on social media usage? And idenitfy newly adoptive practices of communication influenced by rapid tech advancements? Since you emphasize that well being is so important, I believe you ahould begin to study this behaviours.\nP.S Your videos always help me understand human weirdness. This is a positive thing, haha.
i’m so in love with this art
YES! I relate so much! Thanks SOL!!
I tend to not talk about some stuff like anime and video games (two things that are a big part of my life) with people I don't really know well just because there can be a negative connotation that comes with people who like that sort of thing. I've never been bullied or criticized for liking that stuff, in fact, all of my close friends are into at least one of those things. I'm just afraid of people thinking the wrong thing about me I guess.
Just told somebody how I'm still struggling with feeling lonely where I live and this video awaits me in my sub box. Impeccable timing once again.
That was some trumpy handshake right there...
So the person with a Macbook that's got Harry Potter stickers on it who's wearing a Normal People Scare Me shirt and whose hobbies are Netflix, food, and sleep is secretly quirky and different in the inside? I doubt it. People vary in terms of their tolerance/appreciation for strangeness.
You've got to love psychology. It opens a window to the things we can't understand about ourselves and it also let's us in on the minds of people around us. \n...Very enlightening.
*Is life repetitive?*\n\n\nIs life a pattern?\n\nPattern of lies no matter how you try to prove it’s not..?\n\nPatterns of *”types”* of people? Feelings? Thoughts? Expressions?\n\n\nAlways expected to be a “good” person? Someone *”special?” Or “unique?”*\n\nAlways expected to be “different” *simultaneously?*\n\n*Why?* \n\nsame thing, passed to another.

Absolutely the best video you've made yet. This made so many thing click in my mind. Wow. Thank you.
Holy shit this just opened my mind
this video could've just been summed up with don't compare your behind the scenes with someone elses' highlight reel
This video made me feel so relaxed for some reason
AALIYAH MADE THIS FROM BEYOUND THE GRAVE........

As french people, this title does not mean anything... I guess you wanted to say Pourquoi nous nous sentons SEULS et étranges
Lovely animation!
Beautiful.
Pleeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaasssseeeee subtitles in Spanisssshhhhh
TL;DW we're all eggs.
Is this tutsytut?
your topic defends bullies
Yeah this explains me
I have nobody.
wow best video ever
No one likes me, especially in school. When I was doing math today,  we were told to check our work with others. I had no choice but to look around. Everyone had a partner but me, then I sat at my desk. I watched people that looked like they were heading towards me, but dodge me. Heading to the person behind me. at that point, I was in a disappointed state. I looked over my work, pretending to fix a big mistake I had made on my paper. But i had really made the big mistake of even thinking, someone cares about me.\n\nExcept for one girl, she has been talking to me since last year, filling me in on what I've missed on days I was absent. And talking to me about her day. I really appreciate what she is doing. I hope she won't stop, but my shyness may draw her away from me.. It really seeps through.\n\nWhat makes me sad, is that she has been the only one nice enough to talk to me, in 5 years. \n\nThat, is what I call, a miracle. \n\n\n\n😭
Jesus knows you completely and loves you unconditionally. Have a moment with Him and ask Him to live in your heart.
I'm lonely cuz most people are retards.
1:05 When will tSoL stop the sex obsession?? That is literally pornography!!
Dear School of Life,\nPlease stop stalking your subscribers, you are always uploading videos exactly when we need it to the point where it gets a little eery.
To be fair,  people you know could also know you better than yourself.

Ahhhighhht! Loved Imaginary Parties, LOVED Sexy Ladies, Super Loved Heartthrob - admittedly mostly 'cause I couldn't get enough of vid. for that one - but this, *this* song has a no $ girl buying the album.
I love this video but what makes it special is that their eyes are so expressive.
Is that a gay mario?

Mitch: I just can't deny you\nMe: OKAY SI DOES THIS MEAN SCOMICHE IS REAL?  DONT DENY IT
221,219 views. I'm responsible for 200,000 views 🍓
WAIT DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING DID HE GO BACK DOWN TO SCOTT'S CAR OR NOT C'MON
For the love of god stop teasing us!!
Do me a favor and stop playing with my emotions.. Thanks.
This is probably the 180,546,235th time I've watched this music video XD IT'S SO GOOD THAT I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT!!!
OMGG I REMBEMBER WHEN THEY RECORDED THE HARMONIES FOR THIS IT WAS ON SCOTTS IG STORIE
It HURTS me, to HURT you~\n*Dies a little inside*
Mitch's look is so 60's....love this new vid!
Love it... I could be wrong but I see it as being about not sharing the same feelings and arguing about it over and over with a person until you stop talking because nothing can change how they feel and one person needs space and then the other person loses a friend- that no amount of talking can change the facts. You're forced to choose between pretending to feel something and having your friend or telling the truth and losing a friend. And then you have this void and you can't stop thinking about the person you've lost and you realize what a big part of your life they were. Sad to see them sad but great video for a great song!
they tried to contain the scömìche but they just can't deny
I love this song so much HOLY FUCK! YASSSSSS
Favorite song on the album. Fabulous video.
Can stop looking at this video it is well done
Waiting for mitch to shave his mustache like😫
What a masterpiece, I'm in love <3
THIS IS SUCH A BANGER IM SO FUKEN PROD OF YOU GUYS YESSSSSSSSSSS
Why there are ANY 👎🏻 idgi!! Song and video sooooooo good! And acting on point! This better keep rising in views! Deserving to hit over a mil! ❤️
I fucking am in love with this song!!!!!! OH MY GOD! And the video was incredible ;)Nailed it lovelys!!
I need superfruit funkopops in my life, someone make this happen :')
I'm getting so many future bass vibes from this, but it's also not?? and I love the soft synths so much, they're lovely. ugh this song is great
Mitch SANG this though!!! love it!
Favorite song on the album
I don't even ship Scömìche that hard but I after seeing all the MVs lead up to this... I swear to Beyoncé y'all better be making out in the next release.
Breaks me to break you
While everyone else is swooning over all the brooding looks, I'm sitting here wondering how many takes this took because they kept giggling when it was time to get serious. Great job though guys!
I am living for Mitch's 1970's porn star realness. He works that stache.
holy crap!!! this video gave me goosebumps. best music video i’ve ever seen! and such a great song
Mitch is pulling a Freddie Mercury look
Ooooh Mitch that mustache and leather jackets a great combo
You guys are the shit
This is my new song holy SHIIIIIIT !!!
So obviously this song is about Scott from Mitch's point of view. It makes me wonder if Mitch wrote the song sang it for Scott and if Scott cried
Im srry but I havent watched yall in a while ive been busy 😞 but I watch this and MITCH GOT A MUSTACHE
does anyone know how they softened the first couple electronic tones at the beginning (the ones that continued underlying throughout the song) , and added those crackles at the start; those were nice
please like this video for win the competition https://youtu.be/VOfkATP7Z8M
This song hurt my scomiche heart in so many ways. I DEMAND THAT SOME SEXUAL THINGS GO DOWN BETWEEN SCOTT HOYING AND MITCH GRASSI
This song is my faaaaaave on the album
The deepest Superfruit video! So well-made! So beautiful Scott and so fragile fallen in love Mitch.
Love it so much!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Mitch is giving me Vinny from Atlantis vibes
Mitch looks like victor from despicable me
do the chapstick challenge !!
Evolution of Katy Perry ?
Fucking iconic
❤️ Scömiche
I'm obsessed.♡
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Damn Mitch... givin me Freddie Mercury vibes!
s h o o k
*dies*
Obsessed 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Fu@k!!!!!! that was AMAZING!
Holy shit scott 1:15-1:29 I CANT EVEN
♡♡♡
OBSESSED!
mi favorita <3
Wtf is going on?
My fav song 😍
Oh yeah how were people created then May GOD have mercy on your soul  And I'll praye that you come to GOD be for it is to late we are in the end time s GOD will  give you everlasting life in HIS KINGDOM  if you repent of your sins to HIM because JESUS willingly gave his life for our sins and I'm 21:-P
Scott says like 2 words in this song lol
What does u mean?
That poor costume designer that had to make Scott look so different like twelve thousand times I applaud you
Loving Mitch's voice but I want Scott to sing more
Mitch hitting those notes with his mustache is everything
I've been a Superfruit fan for a pretty long time, and never fell down the scomiche void lmao, but the recent MVs are really doing a good job building a case against all that I believe in and now I'm confused?? Are they trying to say something or is this just fan service?!?
I love this song the most out of the album. But is it just me or is Mitch the only one you can hear in every song?
no hate to Mitch, but I feel like Scott doesn't have ANY solo lines in a single one of the songs off of part 1 or part 2
i love them, and LOVE this song, but is this video supposed to be a joke ?? im lost - they almost look serious but at the same time its so much that it must be fake
So sweet of Mathew to wake you up like that!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It honestly baffles me that some people find the motivation to put actual clothes on when they're not going to leave the house
I feel a bit attacked about the microwaved tea.
I think my cats would try to eat me if they didn't get fed right away.
You're such a go-getter, I can't beLIEVE how motivated you are. And I/we/your audience can tell that you are this productive all the time because in your daily vlogs you always get so much done. It's honestly amazing and I think you're super rad. You motivate me to quit procrastinating on crap in my life and just get on with it. Keep up the good work, but also don't forget to give yaself a break now and then, too!
You make my mornings look so unproductive 🤣🤣
i love this video SO MUCH. little barneys grumpy face when you were putting the harness on just warms my heart <3
I'm so impressed by how much you do in the morning and by the fact that you get yourself up to workout so early! I can hardly get myself to workout at all. \nAlso, your house is so beautiful! From the wallpaper to the tiling it's stunning.
Loved this video Helen! Although I'm so bloody jealous of how productive you are, if it's a work day I wake up about half an hour before I need to leave and if it's the weekend I stay in bed until about midday hahaha
Those black jeans! Where did you get them? 😍
Body looks amazing!🙌
Where did you get those pants?! They are amazing!!
Love this video!! Looks amazing
Love your trousers where did u get them from please ❤️😀
Helen, this video is amazing! It's like high-production film, so well made. Loving your content as always!
Could you do a video on the best places in Norwich please? I've just moved here for uni and it would be useful to know some of the best places :-) thanks xxx
Any small YouTuber's wanna help each other out? 😊❤️
I would love to see a tour of your place. Just seeing bits and pieces makes me want to see the whole thing put together!!!
Your curves are to die for, darling! And your outfit in this video is stunning.
love the colours in this video so much, so PLEASING
I wish I was able to wear no makeup to the gym but my skin is horrible so I always have to wear makeup even if I'm stepping like one step out of the house
I bloody love you.
OMG YOUR HOUSE IS LIKE A DREAAAMMMM <3 I love it !
Where did you get your jeans and top from? Pretty sure I didn’t see them in your misguided haul so just wondering where they were from
★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★  ★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★\n*God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n (Just ask Him)
I love how motivational this is but realistic too. No, I wake up bright and early then I use these 10 products then I have a bath using this product then I do a 5 mile run blah blah blah. You get shit done whilst still being a babe. Love you Hel. One of my utter faves.
The push up needs to be in an arrow position rather than a T. If you stick your arms so far out you put unnecessary strain on your shoulders.
I just love your videos Helen. There’s something about you and how you film and edit your videos which makes you so unique. 💖
Omg helen you look fabulous in those jeans and shirt with the fluted sleeves 🔥
Wear is that top from??? does anyone know?? I love it!!
You get a lot done before lunch! I also feel your “pain” with a light colored pet. But the floors aren’t dark the furniture is..lol.
I’m reading Order of the Phoenix at the moment too haha
The bit with Matthew in the morning 😭😭😭 you guys are so cute
Ahhhh finally a morning routine again!!! I loved it:)
Your a busy busy bee! 🐝 Leg kick dance when your getting dressed - yes! Agreed living room always looks a mess, always replumping pillows 😂 x
Those trousers while you tidying look very sexy on you Helen! 💛💛
Those jeans look great on you.
were are your pants from? I love them!
Where did you get those jeans?! Love them so muchhh❤
You should get a new toothbrush. But other than that cool video, you're very proactive.
So well shot, love it!
I wish we had decent seasons here 😐. We have stinking hot, hot, cool, a day or two (this year we had two Mondays)  of coldish and uncomfortably hot
THOSE JEANS. I must know where
Where are your jeans from?!!  They are so nice 😍
So disciplined to workout first thing in the morning! but girl you need to have proteinafter your workout or you wont see changes!!
Those jeans on you, Helen!!!! :') <3 <3
Totally off topic but where did you get your couch? Is it comfy? I've been searching for a nice one and I can't seem to figure out what is a good deal. lol
I love your home it's so cool. Luv from California
Great job, Helen! love the quality and effort 💕
Helen how have I not found your channel before, god you are a breath of fresh air! Loving your videos xx
The only thing i want to know is how long all of this actually takes you to do 😊 i struggle to get things done in the morning
Fab video! You look absolutely gorgeous 😍 also twinning with those white boots, I absolutely LOVE mine 😍
Maff is a gem, you’re insanely motivated and inspiring, and my fav part is Lola peeling out on her walk.☺️
Where are those new pants from? 😍
Does anyone know what camera Helen is using? :o\nI always found it's such great quality hhh
Gotta know where the jeans are from 😍😍😍
Love those jeans, where are they from?
this was so nicely filmed and narrated, it's like the perfect mix of casual and chatty, but still filmed in a professional way yknow
You have such a nice body Helen💜 not to sound like a creepy weirdo lol but you do
Babes that black outfit is banging on you. You have such a nice shape
this is so motivating wow! thank you☺️ i’ve set my alarm for half 5 so i can do yoga in the morning. please do an autumn night time routine ☺️💓
This video is so pretty
Please do a jeans haul! It's so hard to shop for jeans 💖\n\nLoving your morning videos 🖒
I need to take note from this!!! On my days off I struggle to get out of bed before midday - and days when I'm going somewhere I usually give myself half an hour to get ready😩 What sort of time is it usually when you're at the point of makeup done, gym done, editing done etc, & ready to go out and get on with your day? 💖
GOsh I love these kind of videos theyre suuuper entertaining
i don't know what it is about this video, but it was gooooorgeous!! love it
Ahh where did you get your jeans??? They're so nice. Love your vids xx
I leg dance my way through life ;)
Where are your black jeans from? They are so cute.
Them jeans look so good on you!
Love your outfit in this- gorgeous!
This is legit your morning routine....I watch your daily vlogs to vouch for you!!! God I feel like a creep!!! Good woman yourself, getting up that early ...my heroine!!!
If I didn't feed my dogs as soon as I wake up there would be riots in my house! XD
This really motivates me to sort out my morning routine and start the day right 😁
Omg your house Is a goal..would you malé housetour?
The way you filmed this video is simply amazing! It's so well done and gives the feeling of a beautiful movie! Everything you do has just the best quality
You're looking great Helen, all that hard work at the gym is showing xx
Dear lord, I class it as a productive day if I get a few of your morning things done 😐\nNeed to get in a routine like this :')
How is that just one morning?! Looks like a flipping whole day for me
this video is really beautifully shot x
I honesty love morning routines, they are so motivating! This is amazing Helen! <3
i got sooo excited to see you uploaded a morning routine !!! i've wanted you to do another one for ages !! Xx
Your outfit is bomb!!!! ♥♥
#37 on trending!

Love love love this video!!!!! ❤️

That outfit man <3
Your soo adorable !!!!
much more elegant thanmy morning routine
omg how cute are your pups!!!
Leg kick dance club! 💃
I NEED that top! Was it in your recent missguided haul because I can't find it online :(
I don't know how you are so productive all the time! 💖
When do you do a jobby?
MAFF IS SO SWEET
Love how you stick your finger in the tea haha.  I don't have a routine, I really should.....but most mornings it's: debate whether to shower or not, eat breakfast (a leftover reese's peanut butter cup) LMFAO what is wrong with me??
Pleeeeeease don't use those plastic milk pods for your coffee! They're not biodegradable and they're so so harmful for the environment. Please consider drinking your coffee black (if it's good coffee you'll love it!) or making your coffee by other means. Lovely vid, all the best <3
Oh I got the leg kick dance DOWN #thunderthighs 😂
you already have a morning routine for autumn? girl it's been 2 weeks
the one with the blonde hair is def my favourite \nbut the one with the yellow jacket iS SO CUTE \nugh. idk
If u wanted to know all of there names here ⬇️\n*Austin*-> long blonde haired one\n*Nick*   -> yellow and black outfit one\n*Brandon* -> glasses one\n*Edwin* -> the one who sings in the beginning \n*Zion* -> dread locks/ hat one 😂😂
PRETTYMUCH is better than why don’t we.👍
Austin bout to break his neck😂😂
This is so cute and catchy
You can tell who's the face of the group . ( The guy in the glasses) Tell me I'm wrong . Their  all cute af. even the one with glasses is hot af. They are better than 1D. Their sound is amazing, it's not too poopy.  The sound is a mixe of pop/R&B and a little it of hip hop.
Peep how they used one take
What happened with Austin at 1:31 😂 he like bumped into B
I HEARD THIS ON THE RADIO A FEW DAYS AGO. I HAVE RHIS STUCK IBMY HEAD NOW! I LOVED WHEN I HEARD HIS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ♥️♥️im buying this song on iTunes right now
I wish they would be my teachers 😭

Nick from 1:10 to 1:13😂😂 watching the video for the 7th time?Maybe?Yeah
why do i love this vid so much
I would definitely be Zion's teacher... or wife
Edwin and Brandon are literally so cute. They look like they're the closest.  And lol it's funny how Brandon has the lowest voice but he looks like the dude with the high voice and Edwin the opposite. And when I saw their ages I was like whaaaaat
Brandon Arreaga is so cute thumbs up if you agree
I love them so much 💕☹️
Felt a breeze everytime Austin whip his hair 😫❣️
The feeling of the beat reminds me of Dean.
Bro I'm obsessed with this and them
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I don't mind this at all 😏😏
Well damn you got my attention 👀👀
Is this tha next one direction\n\n\n\n.....help.

I AM SO IN LOVE RIGHT NOW
you can be my boss
WolfieRaps nick would be a younger teacher
Suddenly I want to go to college and be qualified to be a teacher
They all looking like a meal made by Gordon Ramsay 😭😍😍😂
You can sense that the director wanted these guys just to have fun, nothing was scripted, loved it!
Am I the only one that watched this video over again to focus on specifically on each boy???!
Im more of a limelight(a why dont we (why dont we is a band)fan )but this is some good music
Brandon sure does have a lot of energy😂😂
take a shot everytime austin puts his hand through his hair
nick is wearing a blm jacket and suddenly I’m a nick Stan 👀
Idk I just love them all 😍😍😍😍
Good music\ngood vibes\ngreat group \nlove their style of music
Zion has got my heart❤❤❤
These guys haven't been noticed for that long and I already feel like they've been in the music business for so long i love all of there songs✊🏼❤️🎶
What am I saying throught the whole video Nick is great!!

2:50 ...BRANDON chilllll 😂\n\nWhat's up my bros\nI'm from Texas 👌🏽🙏🏽\n\nThank you Nick for retweeting me\n\nThank you Austin for singing a solo verse, I've been blessed \n\nTo the rest, stay swagged out loves.\n\nPraying you get bigger soon.

⚠ thrice are playing a dangerous game..\n\nKOREA HAS THEM ALREADY IN THEIR SIGHTS NOW. WHEN JAPAN JOINS THE FIGHT.. AND RETALIATE ITS NOT GOING TO BE PRETTY. \nWe just hope for the best. that they wake up to the reality that Twice is Untouchable in Korea and now In Japan. Nippon has 3 daughters in TWICE.. they must have forgotten that simple fact! \nWe already Won this Round even before the Fight began. [ TWICE 2 : 0 THRICE ]
Who is excited for TWICE'S upcoming Korea comeback ?
Such Garbage.  Some Korean asshole in a suit wrote this shit.  These girls dont have time for any guy due to the slavery of the business.  Dont support Kpop slavery.

果然還是娜璉開頭~
노래는 아주 좋아... 밝아서 좋음...시그널 보다 백만배는 나은듯....특히 채영이 랩부분 이랑 후크송부분이 \n 리드미컬해서 좋음...다만 뮤비가  전체적으로 실망.. 좀 시대에 뒤떨어진듯한 분위기..특히 밴드 부분은 누가 넣은것인지 ... 촌스러움...일부러 90년대 분위기를 내려고 복고풍의 뮤비를  만들려고 한것이 아니라면 ......옷도  촌스러움...특히 다현이 옷 ....쯔위옷.....정연이 메이크업은  하다 만듯...혼자 다크한 분위기.  청순함을 강조하고 싶어서 눈화장을 안한것 같은데 ...정연이 눈매가 날카로워서 그부분이 오히려 역효과로 날카로워 보임

한국컴백도 이노래로컴백하나요?
노래 넘 좋당♡한국분 없으신가요..!?

Good!!!
BLACKPINKのパクリ？
미나못생김
얘네 일본그룹?
글쎄다..
So in the end who won??? Chaeyoung vs Dahyun has no conclusion.
Can someone explain why the Japan MV is getting lesser views than Korea ones?
is this japan song or Korea song ？？
특유의 큰흥겨움이 떨어져서 좀아쉽
왜 저만 트와이스노래가 점점 별로가 되는것 같죠?
이거 일본어에요? 한국말이 하나도 안들려서...(나만그런가.. )
so this is the group that immitate Twice TT dance😑
i think they copied blackpinks choreo ?
*42K DISLIKES?*

Shame on you twice!!!  To copycat blackpink...
Many dance part like BLACKPINK'S . Ugh queen of plagiarism😏
門面擔當的子瑜畫面好少…失望…
it's not complete without kelsey
could of fed half of Somalia
It's metabolism, it's in her genes. She has giant shits, that is the only logical explanation when you think about it. \n\nI'd love see her bowl after a meal, if you know what I mean... (just out of curiosity)
Good luck with heart diseases
What’s wrong with me?? Why am I turned on watching her eat 🤤
Heard of heart attack?
Omg, she's so skinny(in a nice way) and yet she can eat 20 patties. p.s 1 person 20 patties, 17 people 1 100x100 0w0 ok...
I just had like two burgers and a fudge ton of fries and my stomach is killing me and I'm watching this and I'm actually puking
1:55. There's an article saying in n out managers and lawyers can earn the same over a decade working towards it yet only one will have massive student loan debts. Moral is if you work hard and can wait 10-15 years you can make a lot and have food benefits as an in n out manager
That's American for you
It's out of pure curiosity but I always see YB eating a lot of unhealthy food. However, she never seems to gain weight.
I don’t understand why they only had 2 people do it, and these two make a lot of similar videos. Have other people do it!
They should date
In-n-Out associate. AMA lol.
Legislative computer shortly retired nonetheless van.
ORRRR she just has high matabalism.
I love her! Lmao
At my In-N-Out (it's only in the state) I cover my burgers in *frysauce.*
Am I the only one who ships? Lolol
Is it me or the Asian girl is so cute
You could have fed 16 Poor & Hungry African children with this!
That waste of money......... millions in Africa could have eaten that
I love YB i can relate to her soo fucking much
K so I'm a 6'3 fatass and I couldn't eat more than 6.
What’re the point of these.
dont mind being hired to do these :)
Cultural appropriation at it`s worst, there are no blonde asians, only white women can have blonde hair.
They’re making Evan lose his eight pack to make another ‘we got abs in a week’ video lol
I could eat that
Lol my friend saw you guys buying those at ni n out
I could literally watch Evan do anything! ❤️❤️❤️
I want to see YB do competitive eating
I have never had In-N-Out....
Kind of find these video ideas pointless other than having views and revenue because it's just a waste of food.
THROW THE TOMATOES AWAY HOW DARE YOU.
I love YB. She is fucking awesome!
I want in n out right now so badddddd bruvz!!
I'd need half a bottle of tequila for that.
In n Out is overrated. I  prefer Wendy's or Shake Shack any day over Inn n Out.
After 3 or 4 burgers I wouldn't be able to move ,these asians can eat !
YB is perfection. Evan's cool too
Jesus Christ yb you are the real boss dude!
Who eats utensils on the burger?
Everyone: that is way too much!! \nMe: that looks quite um... Good. I say Breakfast and Lunch... Maybe Dinner.
how does she eat so much and so fast?
Everyone who gets into buzzfeed would get fat
If she's eats like that. You know what else she's good at eating.
i wish i could be like yb she loves eating but she has good body  😦😦
Its a good burger for a party, but not two people lmao
love these two,  expecially YB, seems so nice
How is this a challenge?
there goes evan's abs
This is what is wrong with the world
I have a husky too! And best dogs ever, but they have a ton of energy.
... Well, this is my 16\nI think i'm in love with her hahahah
The girl is a fucking savage!!!!
She always says things like Oh I don't know if I can do this and ends up eating the most in every video
I want in n out
I would have literally gained 20 lbs from what YB ate in one sitting. Life is so unfair.
What about kids in Africa
I wouldn't say that is a surprise. I worked for Panda Express. I knew several managers who made $100,000. It isn't super common but enough
did you know in and out burger dyes its meat?
You know what really grinds my gears? When they use the person who was featured in two fitness videos and that had  eat healthy for so long, And now their doing challenges like this. SMH 🤦‍♂️
YB can put down some food! YB!!!
YB is so pretty !
Why am I watching this? This is literally a vegetarian's worst nightmare.
Do buzzfeed people only hang out with other buzzfeed people?
Just wondering if YB actually has hyperthyroidism... She eats a lot but is too skinny even if she says she exercises every day.
Buzzfeed is trying to fucking kill these 2. They always do the eating challenges
they better be eating healthy for the rest of their lives
YB is a monster!! I wish i had her metabolism!!😅
I want to pipe her
i could eat this all my self
I can relate to YB. I eat more than my friends but I'm the thinness and i don't exercise ever.
When the said 100X100 I thought it was like 10,000 so step it up buzzfeed
YB what a fucking beast!
Evan is from heaven 😍
I wish i could do that! I love cheeseburgers 😍😋❤️
somebody call matt stonie
FAIL
Die
WAIT I THOUGHT EVAN'S VEGAN?!?!?!?!
cancer and cholesterol gains
She's hot
My chest started hurting watching this lol
I ship them!!
is it possible?..
Both will take huge craps
Yb can chow down lmaoo
2:27 \nEvan: HELP MEEEE\nYB: 😂
YB is so cute 💕💕💕
i could eat 200 big macs rn
Date already.
Damn, only in America 😂
the other korean girl is hotter
Pathetic
I'm not assuming bc I wouldn't know- but I feel like YB may have an eating disorder bc she can eat so much (binges) but shes pretty skinny...?
As a vegan, this is my worst nightmare
Try tacos
The ship is real
Nah I reckon KJ Apa would more suit being with one of his own kind #Don'tForgetYoutRoots 😂

For me, you two are the best comedy duo I've ever known. With content like this, there's no way you don't blow up eventually.
Posting a day late? Forgiven
Who HASNT had their best friends wiener on their forehead? Not true best friends is who
seriously where are all your subscribers guys? like every video is gold!
This has become one of my favorite channels in a short amount of time
It's funny, for that entire exchange I thought all they had to do was just push the door open. Like they didn't even try moving it at all before they started talking about their friendship. Would have been a heck of a punchline.
What if there's a bunch of channels out there with this level of effort but they don't blow up because of lack of marketing... Maybe? I'm just trying to rationalize why you don't have a million subs.
I really love your stuff, guys! By the way: I forgive you, too.
HOW DO YOU PEOPLE NOT HAVE 10,000,000 SUBS?!?!
zzzzzzzzz last video i saw was abduction these guys arnt showing up in my mfkin sub  box. putting bell on
please like this video for win the competition https://youtu.be/VOfkATP7Z8M
Wait. That's David's lair in Alien Covenant.
Sorry, I just didn't really think this was funny.
wow this was funny im mad that this should have more views i will share it tho
consistently well-scripted, well-executed, well-edited, well-produced; the youtube algorithm messed up big time
I have no friends.
One of the best channels on Youtube.
CMON MAN! YOU DONT JUST LET THAT STUFF GO
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
The best goddamn chanel on all of youtube
This video literally helped me figure out some things about me and my best friend LOL. Thanks
That was hilarious, you guys have to be the best short film creators on Youtube.
I just can't get over the fact that's Sokka. Fucking Sokka dude.
I love a good channel that puts the focus on the right factors in their sketches. Its not like WOOO WE CAN EDIT REALLY WELL and the sketches never really revolve around the editing or anything directly related to pop culture or anything. Always very obscure and interesting. Really its just the disctinction between intelligent people and unintelligent people, and you guys are obviously the former.
most underrated channel on youtube. no contest. this video even made me feel better about settling things with my best friend tomorrow. thank you guys, please keep it up.
GUYS. 👏🏼 you're killing it.
I was dying throughout the whole video! keep it up you guys!
This was so funny and so well done!
i love you guys
Always top notch comedy from Chris and Jack.
I think a good way for you guys to get more views is to do a more frequent side series or something.  I'd love to see more of you guys even if it's not your usual big production videos
Man you guys are a true inspiration, every single video is straight fire and so quotable. Beautiful \nI strive to make our channel as good as you guys. One day
Well wiener on the forehead IS a classic prank, just saying *shrug emoji*
Better acting then twilight as well. Hell, its easy when its true.
The production value alone on these is absolutely incredible! Paired with the chemistry you guys have and the HILARIOUS writing, I'm honestly hooked! One a month is just unfair! Keep it up guys, you're amazing ❤
Damn, you guys are good at this
This is why we bring pickaxes and tnt on expeditions
There's something really wrong about these guys not having at least a million subscribers. One awesome video after the other!
Always a great surprise ending!
You guys are so creative! KEEP IT UP!!!
You guys covered so much ground with this one.
Like we haven't ALL taken a picture with Chris' weiner.
I can't think of a funnier duo than these two, not Jake and Amir, not Jack and Dean, not even Rick and Morty.
These are always so inspirational! And funny.
SO GOOD, as always !!
Put on headphones in the middle of a lecture just to watch this. \n\nI'm in medical school.
My question is where do you get the budget?
The smallest channel i'm subscribed to but also my favorite, I love it keep it up and it will pay off!
Jesus this is amazing
Okay wow! so this is the set of Alien Covenant. Was there scenes in that location in the movie?
Ahhhhhh so excited to see you guys upload!!
Please don't encode 21:9 with black bars. Otherwise great video!
I once too put my wiener on someone's forehead.....
Who is bankrolling the productions of these videos?
How do you not get more views?! Keep up the good work!
Im so surprised that you guys don't have more subs, you are one of my favorite channels
How do you guys come up with these awesome crazy sketch ideas? xD
Shared this with my two best friends. Boy, that's going to cause some issues. Someone is getting left in the Scorpion Tunnel.
Slow and steady you’re growing, keep it up guys!
Thank you Jack and Chris for another awesome skit!
I jumped terribly at that last trap. lol poor jack jack
The month does not pass fast enough!  I want more!!! Love these guys
SUBBED
I knew it. But damn it was good.
I just found your channel the other day and you guys are honestly so funny! I'm definitely gonna show your stuff to my friends, you deserve a lot more views and subscribers!\nA lot of love from Germany:)
I'm not your friend, guy!
I am going to show it to all my Best Friends.
Sent this to my best friend right away! Your videos are so good and i get so excited when the new ones come out!!
Please never stop making these videos. Even if you may not have a huge amount of subscribers, eventually someone in the large productions business will notice you guys 100%
How, how have you guys not blown up yet
I love this unique humor you guys have.  I feel like this is more of a series than a youtube channel, and it should be called The Infinite Realities of Chris and Jack.\n\nI remember meeting you guys at FilmQuest a few years back and saw Movies in Space.  I thought it was the best film at the fest.  I've been following your channel ever since the first video you posted.  I'm a fan. Great job guys!
Damn, I never clicked on the thumbnail of a video so fast before in my life
This was amazing! Really proud of you guys! 😚
Damn, the production is getting better and better.\nKudos guys! You are the best (friends)!
Favorite channel on YouTube hands down
Would have been funnier if after the rock fell, the guy who got squished goes, Uh, best friend? A little help here? Please?
The real treasure was inside you all along!\n\n...now let me get inside you.
>Best comedy duo on youtube\n>only 64000 subs\nWhat the fuck.
Beautiful. This deserves more views! Subscribe to these guys and help them out!!!
So fucking creative
Great stuff as usual!
that fucking ending lmaooo
You guys are amazing.
Thanks for adding subtitles
Amazing as always :)
WOOOOOOOO NEW CHRIS AND JACK VID!
Amazing video
Thank you
Classic! :D
Haha yeah everyone's been there... *laughs nervously*
Classic prank!
Lmao I fucking love it.
YAYYYYYY
Classic prank!
That was amazing!
True story.
Excellent!
wer ist alles wegen kiavier hier???
It’s Friday.
That door is racist
The increasing number of long range weapons attacks should compel law enforcement personnel to be better trained and equipped.  All officers should be basically qualified infantry men equipped with long range weapons as a counter measure against elevated positions.

When a cracker does something wrong, he was pushed to do it....if you're non white, no matter how innocent you are, you're in the wrong....
Why did he dicide to go and kill country folk?
FBI created a Lee Harvey Oswald.
More people, the better.
What about the note found near the body - WTF is the media suppressing this information?  They keep saying no suicide note or anything - yet clearly there is a note on a table right near the body!
Admiring the fact that it is fall and in Canada it's freezing but there you see he has his sleeves rolled up
pray for the shooter
Is it necessary for George Stephanopoulos  to teach me how to subscribe on YouTube at the end of every single video?
shooter? i would call him a terrorist, oh wait, he's a white caucasian.
Thankful for all of the brave men and women who risked their lives and saved many. <3
An hour before they got to him!! Are you fucking kidding me!!!
this guy sure did his research.
Did he just say the correspondent's name is Matt Gunman?
False Flag does not mean nobody was hurt. False Flag means that the official narrative has nothing to do with the truth.
Inside Edition said he never checked into any. This all is insanely sad.
This is proof that Hillary was involved in the LV shootings, look at how poor of a turn out for her book sales.
Sense when did they start filming these tragedy's?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you? He had no criminal background but look he carried out a massacre!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLkruVqQLEM \nyou have to be REALLY, but REALLY stupid and retarded to think that there is only 1 weapon shooting at a time. 5:00
Now whitey knows how it feels to be shoot at for no apparent reason, like innocent Native Americans , Blacks and Mexicans have endured for many many moons!
Where is the hotel security camera footage?
HOW MANY TIMES IS THE AVERAGE DUMBED DOWN IDIOT AMERICAN GONNA FALL FOR THE SAME BULLSHIT TRICK. IF YOU BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL STORY YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WALK THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
100 round clips? those are 30 round clips. Only way for 100 rounds is in a drum.
Or they had multiple hotels in his name because they were shooting out of all of them! Quit lying MEDIA!!!!!!
Chicago Illinois was next Google it,
2:02 Just in case we suck at math... and common sense...
I hope he rots in hell for all eternity.
People tend to a build a wall when they have their own issues.
2:30\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING IN ROOM 135\n\nhttps://www.cuteonly.ru/223394
alright so basically \nStephen Paddock wanted to kill himself, but since he was messed up he wantedto kill as amny people as posible with him\na clever plan. but not so clever if he kills himself
Wow ! Silly me!! I just got it !! It's like a dick extension having a gun and having a bigger gun is a bigger dildo!! It's only just occurred to me that this old dude probably can't get it up any more!! I mean look at all the younger spree shooters who did it because they couldn't get laid, well we know this dude had money and a girlfriend but he probably lost it cos he's now a limp dick!!\nYou see that is what you need to do now America, tell the truth about why a man would need a big gun , let alone 40 of them!! You need to let young kids know how deeply uncool it is to need a gun. What man needs a gun ? Over here in Blighty we would consider that being a pansy as tis old school to have a bloody fist fight and guess what? Nobody dies.
The sad thing is that these hotels have little to no security he could have done the same at any hotel bring all those weapons in ... also what did he have against country music instead of rappers? Hmmm....
There had to been two shooters. He couldn't have done it alone.
an hour later? Thought it was 10 minutes
Thank the lord he didn't shoot up the rap show....

Why still no fucking hotel videos from inside!?
Also google LIVEWIRE VEGAS. 1ST RESULT SHOWS A GRAPHIC VIDEO.
This are all fucken lies the media is reporting. Tell us the truth . Just let's us know the truth . He had help and let us know who help him .? Everything is fishy
Guns were placed previously in the room...the guy just walked in and got the keys at reception...inside job.
false flag perpetuated by the demonrat libtards to take away muh guns!
The conspiracy theorists are not the only ones u gotta watch out for now lol anyone can go nuts
Look for the photo released/leaked that show the dead lone wolf on the floor. \nThen take special note that there is a rifle on a bipod OVER his left leg. \nThey reported that he was killed on breech, then they said it was suicide, now they are back to killed on breech. \n\nLooking at his body position with the rifle over his left leg...... hmmmmmm>\n\nI hope you can find it, but the pic of his face shows he spit up a lot of blood, but you can see he was shot in the lower chest to stomach from the front. \n\nWith the rifles position and his final resting spot, that means he was shot by someone else standing in the room at the broken window. \nSWAT didn't enter the window and they did not have a sniper shooting into the room. \n\nFor all those who say the 4th floor muzzle flashes were the reflection of a strobe light, tell me how a moving cab wouldn't have fallen out of the reflective line of sight of that distant strobe reflection. \nNot to mention other camera angles showing the same muzzle flash. \n\nJust watch all the first shooting videos.....where the guy was still singing on stage. \nYou can hear shots and echo, but then you will hear overlapping fire. \n\nHead back to the pics in the room and look at the shot with his legs in the photo....top left of that photo is the window he was shooting from. \nThere aren't nearly enough empty casings on the ground for this to make since
He should've uploaded the videos to YouTube before he killed himself.
Who else flinched when they demonstrated the ak
WOW  Lone gunmen don't need several spots to shoot from,  Teams do.  Real deaths, real injuries, bad reporting.
What will be next step for USA government.
If we don't want this to happen anymore we shouldn't be creating more gun laws. We should just have metal detectors added to buildings. Going in and out. That way they can keep track of the firearms better. Concealed carry is ok. But you can't have someone stockpiling weapons in any building. If you bring a weapon in you can't bring another one in until your other one is out. Its called being smart and caring about what goes on.
Chicago people still being killed by gun men. No outrage there, the hypocrisy is real!
a sad moment in history
George Stephanopoulos is a little bitch, I remember he called this monster Mr Paddox fk him. Call him the killer or evil man, not mr you stupid ass news anchor. What a douche say what it is politically correct ass hole.
IT'S GOVERNMENT SETUP AND HE GOT FRAME FOR IT BLAHHH
what is that odd piece of furniture around 00:25 with giraffe print? strange, appears to have sections and cracked on the outside. anyone have an idea?
The thing that is scary is if you change the T in the reporters last name it’s Mat Gunman
Nigga was wall hacking too gawhdamn he doing it right
were are the body cams of the SWAT TEAM when the breached the room???
Fake NEws
I wonder if this happens in Denmark....
I don't understand why people want to hurt others life just because there not living an amazing life
My heart goes out to the shooter's family. They're the real victims in this shooting. If only the shooter had shot the fucking  redneck performer of the horrible music, I wouldn't have complained. It's funny how it's always white Americans that carry out innocent mass shootings.
Steve the shooter,  had 2 planes, I would like to see his flight records, flight paths, States and Countries he visited, petrol consumption, service maintenance recordes, who were his PASSENGERS ?? the passengers list. This would be in all aviation records. Perhaps he leased a plane overseas, this would be in global records, he would need to produce his licence, ID, PASSPORT, to lease any plane ABROAD, then there's the payment records to do all of the above, follow the money and his carbon footprint.
Media is either ignorant or complicit in the conspiracy. There were shots fired at the Belagio hotel over a mile away from Mandalay Bay. There were two people registered as being guests in that room !!!!!!
Cops told niggas to stay within the festival fences. Hm
Are semi-auto guns cheap? is that why so many people have them?
Um, why an hour later after the security guard notified police?
There goes all the fake ass Russian bots arguments that he targeted country music because he was leftwing.
Good on those cops love it
Go to: Movie BREACH - THAN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jesus is the second shooter !!!!  He shot himself to look like a victim ! And his buddy ran away
ONE HOUR LATER
FUCKING PIGGGG ASSSS COPS!

I wonder what those “fuck the Police“ people think about that when they need some one to save ther ass the police are ther when they don't need them they just talk 💩.
It's only a false flag when a white person does it but if you're not white you're a terrorist

..Gathering people who wants to be a part of building a network of stable, fully self sustaining and self sufficient communities (a.k.a. life-boats for the coming social & environmental collapse).  Peaceful communities that are built upon foundation of : love, spirituality, mercy, generosity, tolerance, intelligent, and wisdom. If you are interested in becoming a part of this grass root efforts, I encourage your reply.\n\nThis Community ARK Project is looking for peaceful, patience, humble, and kind-hearted people who are awaken and aware of the coming social & environmental collapse; who want to roll up their sleeves and participate in preparatory efforts. One cannot pull someone out of a raging river standing on a muddy slippery slope. In order to pull someone out of the river, one must stand on a firm solid foundation. A fully self-sufficient community is that solid foundation, upon which we stand in order to rescue other less fortunate who will be affected by the collapsing environment.  If people are struggling to survive as the environment collapses, how can they help others?  People need fully self-sufficient communities to shelter and nourish them, in order for them to reach out and help others.\n\nWe are gathering people from all spectrum of professional background: engineers, scientists, architects, biologists, farmers, doctors, nurses, artists, etc. Both skilled and unskilled people. Those with knowledge will teach those who lack them. Those not in the know will listen and learn so they might in turn teach others in the community. We have spent 6 years researching technology that were designed to allow Mars colonies to thrive in a desolate environment. We are now planning on using those very same technology to prepare people for the coming environmental collapse. If you are interested in helping out, we could use the help to reach the ears of people who are awaken via social media, or you can read our blog titled Generalized Plan of Action for a list of positions you can volunteer for.\n\nWe are speaking to those of like mind who do not need convincing; in their hearts and in their thoughts, they recognize the catastrophe that lay ahead if our modern societies continue on their current path of promoting competition, strife, ignorance and scarcity. This Community ARK Project is lighting a beacon so that those with similar mind set will know that they are not alone in their thoughts and impulse; that there are others like them out there who desire to come together to pool our effort in order to extract ourselves and place ourselves on a different path.  One that promote cooperation, harmony, foresight, and a nurturing environment.
Notice the WHITE media keeps showing MANY pictures of the non-white Filipina who didn't even commit the crime, but the WHITE man who's the perpetuator has only 1-2 pictures, yes, mostly ONE picture of him with EYES CLOSED.\nNo doubt they are trying to WEAKEN the image of the WHITE barbaric man in the head of viewers. \nDirty white bastards strike again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The ignorance of the media regarding gun terminology is ridiculous. Sensationalized, uninformed garbage.

Mr. Paddock just wanted some shut eye.

It's only fake when a white person does the crime... gtfoh you sick bastards.
There is no way that a 64yr old senior citizen with no military experience could plan and finance that attack alone
How is someone who put this much planning and effort into killing hundreds of people not considered a terrorist...
The AR15 should be banned
Don't worry folks, we will see the hotel security video as soon as they release a better video of what actually hit the Pentagon
You guys are great. I love your deep analysis into popular shows. I never thought you guys would do Big Little Lies tho. No one ever really talks about it, but the show was really good.
So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home. Not Ziggy.
ScreenPrism I love you SO much!!\nPlease do a video for “The Witch”🙏🏼\n(And also Houses Martel, Arryn & Tully) 😉
Didn't think the show had such depths. A really great and insightful video!
Just finished rewatching this show, so this video just came out at the right time. Thanks!
If you haven't watched this show already then you're really missing out!
What is that piano song in the first 3 seconds?
We learn that white people actually go through shit
Throughout the video, I was wondering why you keep saying season 1 when it's obviously a stand-alone miniseries, but when you talked about that final voyeuristic shot of the mothers at the beach, I thought holy shit is it actually possible for this to get a 2nd season?
Shailene's a blonde now so is her character going to be blonde as well...hmm🤔this show is like Instagram Twitter & Facebook users lives combined! everyone wants to appear perfect on the outside to everyone else & in person they're far from it!!
Excellent video. You really nailed down what I find to be most poignant about this story. I was first introduced to Big Little Lies as an audiobook, which was narrated by an Australian woman (since the author is Australian and the book was initially set there), so it took quite a bit of adjustment for me to get used to seeing the same story in an American setting. Sure you still had the divine Nicole Kidman representing the Aussies, but I worried that something could be lost in adaptation. My fears were completely unfounded as the show actually improved on the book in a number of ways. Many of the complexities were better illustrated in a visual medium than in a book.
Excellent work!
Jesus christ you guys deserve to make it big. Such great content.
You need to make an ASMR channel 😂😂
yes i love u guys for doing big little lies and all of the vids i saw SO COOOOLL !!!!!!!!!
This show was so good, I wish it had a second season
Gonna check out the show now thanks you you guys! Keep up the great content!
Such a good, complex series. Exquisitely crafted in every way. I want to watch it again.\nGreat analysis!
thank you for making such great and content!!
I don't know why I cried watching this .. lol
YAS! I loved this show and your analysis was spot on. I only wish this video was twice as long so you could've really gone in on a few pivotal scenes, especially the climax, also the music and cinematography are well worth discussing.
What a lovely, astounding performance from all of those women. That show was watched twice, eagerly and among friends.
You have got to talk about the other show Nicole Kidman was in 'Top of the Lake's both seasons of this show are incredibly well crafted, definitely worth the analysis.
So happy I clicked on this video.
Please, make a video about the Americans. Please, please. You will like it!
it was about time!!!!
Awesome video keep it up the films and series that are show cased are insightfull  and the break down of character development is amazing I show friends this channel when talking about a film or series
How was Jane able to afford that school for her son. She's a young single mom.
This show isn't my cup of tea, but anything this Screen Prism narrator talks about sounds delightful.
I am going to watch this after the vid.
this is goooooood
biggie smalls lies is best rapper
Luv it!!! Thanks for sharing
Very positive and upbeat music for a darkish show. I haven't watched, I'm just going on assumption
not relevant to this video, but are we ever gonna get rest of those The Wire videos as promised? after you guys dropped your McNulty video, I started to re-binge the series in anticipation.
Loved this show. Everyone, except Reese because she sucks as an actor, were beyond phenomenal. So happy Nicole won the Emmy.
I'm not American. But I love American and British TV shows. But now a days American or British shows mostly based feminism. I thought it's easy to get Awards. But I didn't like awards shows. \nI want to see man based shows like breaking bad, mad man, Sherlock \nSo if any current shows like this pls tell the name of the show
What was that piano song at the beginning?
I’m unsubscribing because you people think you’re smart and always try to get too deep into things to name a few things
In case you plan to breastfeed you are also not supposed to used retinol when nursing :(
I love Tartelette palette 🎨 so stunning. Very similar colours to Too Faced Chocolate 🍫 palette👌🏻
What does retinol actually do??
Okay, am I the only one that that when she was talking about the Clinique Pep-Start range actually thought she was saying Pet-Start?? 😂 I was thrown off for a sec ( why the heck would Clinique be starting a pet range??). Maybe just me, yeah? We shall see.....😂  BTW your videos are consistently great Fleur stay fabulous! ❤️
Have u tried Bobbi Brown Eye Opening Mascara, suuuuper volume n long lasting! Wovzers was so impressed x x x

Wow! That estee lauder box looks amazing!
Fleur😍😍😍😍😍
SERIOUSLY NEED THE NEW TARTE PALETTE😍😍😍😍🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
You are looking beautiful Fleur!
lol be these videos Fleur!! ❤️
These vids are my fave x
Really interested in seeing a review of that Lancôme stick foundation!
So is this the old formula? And it's only available in the USA? It's a little different name, SPF 21, and shade range is different from the U.K.  I wear 110 in the one available in the USA but that's a shade too dark. Here is the link to the USA one I'm referring to (please someone let me know if this is different from the new UK release!!). https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/teint-idole-ultra-longwear-foundation-stick/3605971343964.html
looking really glowy Fleur! Pregnancy looks great on you:) X
Loved this video Fleur, you look absolutely glowing, pregnancy is really suiting you! I can't wait to get my hands on those serums! xx
Hi Fleur.. Love your makeup look in this video.. Do a tutorial maybe? :)
Your under eye concealer has looked very cakey in your last few videos - what is it? 😳
Clinique skincare is a hit IF you find the right product for your skin type. I have super dry skin (not dehydrated) and Moisture Surge Intense Skin Fortifying Hydrator for a moisturizer and All About Eyes Rich or Repairwear Anti-Gravity Eye Lift Cream for the eye area are my favorite skincare products that I've tried from the brand. I like the Dermalogica balm cleanser 10x more than Clinique's since it's in a tube and it doesn't make my vision insanely blurry like Clinique's does when I take off my eye makeup. There have been some definite misses in Clinique for me as well but the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief is my ride or die moisturizer for when my skin is at its absolute driest and tightest so I would highly suggest that if you have dry/dry combo/very dry skin.
I’m not a girl but I wear makeup and I like acting like a girl! Awesome video and I love the tarte palette!
have been expecting for this video for so long!!! love your new launches video Fleur!
Ahhh I love your reviews! You’re quick, honest and hilarious. Excited about the ouai spray and that toasted palette- I love tarte.
Did you know the Estee box is sold out?
Could we have a best candles / Reed diffusers video. Not the Xmas candles, just a general one. Thanks
love the video - as always!! :)\nwhat about the new hourglass holiday palette? you didn't mention it in september either..
You look great in this video Fleur!!! Thanks for bringing me up to date! Lancome stick foundation seems great! Would love a more thorough review on it!
Aw, the beauty box isn't sold in the US, but all the other Estee Lauder companies pink products are :(
Remember when trying these new products out Fleur, that you are taking prenatal vitamins which are full of so much nourishment. That can contribute to your hair being so wonderful right now. Happened to me darn it.
Shut up Zoe’s friend.
That Tarte palette looks so frickin' amazing! Please do a tutorial on it x x
Hi Fleur! Since it's breast cancer awareness month, I would really love to see what you think of MÊME cosmetics, which are supposed to be formulated for women who are fighting cancer!
The Estée Lauder box is still in stock on the Clinique website!
Wow I want to try all of it! And you know me and my obsession with Tarte! ❤️Lol 😆
Always love these videos! Where are your earings from Fleur? They're lovely
your voice is the best i have ever listened to :-)
I was so happy when I discovered the Ordinary! I cannot afford fancy serums but I swear the Ordinary serums have seriously changed my skin!
Gutted to have missed out on that Breast Cancer box!!
I have yet to try The Ordinary, but the serums look promising. These overview videos are really so helpful!
Always wanted to try some Ouai products! I love the sound of them and the package is gorgeous! Definitely going to pick up some of the new ordinary stuff! I'm obsessed xox
Fleur- what are your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tilburry pallet?
Hi There Guys! This Is Awesome! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕀𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖𝕤 ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Claimanygiftcardfrofree
that tarte palette looks amazing! I'll have to check it out, it does look more wearable than the naked heat palette
Hope you can make a Drugstore Makeup 💄 video next. All ur videos are mostly high street and high end. 😔 thanks!
Your face is radiant as usual, Fleur. Can't wait to see how the baby will look like. It's going to have a face like a flower or like the sun. Cute!
Are you using all products during pregnancy? Or have you changed anything in your routine?
The ester lauder box is already sold out. Boo!
Well that's my Christmas list sorted! Thanks FleurB. Hope you're well x
Love watching an intelligent woman with good vocabulary playing with beautiful frivolous stuff  I'm 36 and get a headache from the omg babes channels lol .. I love that you try enough of the things to give an opinion rather than just a basic show what's out xxx
Your hair looks incredible, I definitely need to try those Ouai products!
Your videos are ALWAYS informative and fantastic!!!  P.S. Pregnancy looks great on you!! XOX
Hi Fleur, today in France, we're celebrating everyone named Fleur so happy name's day , happy Fleur's day 🎉😘 tc !
What nail polish are you wearing? 😍
Hi Fleur I really enjoyed the October update so many interesting new things. I'd love to know which of the Ouai shampoos you used and enjoyed I was about to take the plunge. Also I had read about the smoothing product you mentioned but haven't been able to find in the UK so thrilled it may now be available.
Hi fleur are you wearing maternity wear? Could you do a video on maternity wear?
Smashbox has sold out of the charity boxes on your link but Bobby Brown still has some in stock :-)
Love your top ooh new products
Your hair in this video is amazing!!!!
that brown sparkly shade in the tarte palette STRESSES ME OUT hahahah IMAGINE THE FALL OUT
The toasted looks amazing and supporting a good cause, I always love
I never realised you still made YT videos! I’ve missed them; I used to watch you way back in the day! Hey girl!
Hi Fleur, what did you think of the new Chanel perfume- Gabrielle? X
I love what you're wearing Fleur! Where is it from and can you get it non maternity? It's so cute 😊 Love your videos and hope you're enjoying your pregnancy. Can't wait for #babydeforce
You look so beautiful you are glowing 🤗😍
Love that box for breast cancer! Great idea. Another great video, Fleur :)
Love these videos Fleur, really respect your opinion and appreciate work you put in to research and try all these products out x
Fleur whats wrong with your undereye concealer, it doesnt look as good as always. Have you used another one ?
some nice looking products there
I’m looking for liquid lipstick version of mac velvet teddy that’s going to last all day. Any help??? X
I love the smelling sound not in a creepy way but its not gross....
This is my favorite series of yours!
Love these types of videos! Do you have any recommendations for liquid eye liner? I’m on the hunt for something new because my favourite one has been discontinued. Also, waterproof would be an amazing plus ❤️
So happy to see your video Fleur! I am in love with the Tartlette palette and the Erborian mask I'll definitely look into. (Before this vid, here I was trying to whittle down my makeup stash for some while 😂)
Love it all and you are lovely! xoxo
Love these 'new i beauty' videos☺️
Awesome idea for the breast cancer box 💕and looking forward to trying the new Ordinary serums!
Lovely choices as always, Fleur. :) Hope you're feeling well ; before you know it your Favorite Beautiful Lead Item of All Time will be ... *Baby DeForce.* :D
I am so sad the toasted palette isn’t out yet 😩 it looks amazing
I'm not loving that UD mascara either.  The Perversion mascara is one of my favorite from them, though!
The tarte palette is so beautiful😭
I am definitely going to pick up the Tarte  palette. Curious about the Eborian mask since I enjoy their BB cream. The bubble mask looks fun! What would you compare the Clinique  overnight lip balm to? Oh my gosh! Nooo replica! I adore their fragrances & I don't need to because they are pricy but that one sounds good. Beach Walk is my all time favorite scent. It's pretty much been my signature scent for the past couple of years. Hope you're having a lovely week. Hugs, Summer xo
Urghhh the breast cancer box is sold out. My mum just finished treatment a few months ago and would have loved it! Hoping they'll restock
I'm so excited and ready for the tarteltte toasted pallete 😍😍😍
i have to look for that beauty box for breast cancer, that's nice! i will look for and try the clinique double bubble mask is available in the US for $24.50
My favourite and what I look forward to most are your Vlogtober and Vlogmas vlogs. I, of course, totally understand why you are not doing them but I am still a little heartbroken. Hopefully next year.
Gutted that the breast cancer beauty box is sold out. Is it a one off or do they come back in stock?
The tarte palette looks so good but idk where to buy it from in the uk
Does Tarte ship to the UK ? Or how else can we get this palette?
no shops in the UK stocks tarte make up !!!;( if anyone things i'm wrong and know the place pleat let me know!!!!) there is one place like a pharmacy and let's say for tarte eyeshadow palette charges like 149 pounds!!!????🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
It seems a bit odd that Replica are releasing a summer/sea scent in October...  I love the Lipstick one and By the Fireplace for winter :)
It's a shame that the Estee Lauder box sold out in minutes! Would have liked one....
Are you a male to female transgender? Born a man?
Love your hair Fleur. The new growth looks so heathy and shiny. Natural color looks so flattering.
did anybody misunderstand fleur saying sweat proof as 'sex proof'??
Your explanation of hair memory :) haha.
Loved this new-in-beauty video as always!  You always give great reviews/first impressions
Hi Fleur! Question! Where/How do you get Tarte in the UK?! Thanks for answering love! ❤
Wear us your top from?!
I swear all of his songs are LIT
So smooth when that electric guitar kicks in
listen to it in 0.75 speed
Waiting for you here in PH :)
No one is probably going to read this,\nBut i don't mind writing it because I feel at least one person will read it.\n\nI'm an artist pursuing my dreams & pray that my dream will someday be a reality. I have my latest video up on my channel & would love the support from anyone. \n\nEither leaving a like on this comment, liking one of my videos or subbing to my channel would mean a lot to me. \n\nJust some simple views & subs can get me closer to living my dreams. Thank you:)

People are saying I lauv Lauv that's not the way it is pronounced, but Ok. Love this whole shabam. You and all your music, videos, voice, just everything is so perfectly imperfect. Ready for the day you are famous. I can't get over this. Its on repeat. Going on my daily playlist(basically all the Lauv songs).
You got a way of making me feel insane\nLike I can't trust my own brain\nUnless it's screaming your name\nI'd have it no other way\nI'd have it no other way\nAnd maybe that's why I stay\nHow many times can we pick up the same fight?\nCan we keep screaming all night?\nAnd make up until it's light?\nThat's when I say that you're right\nAnd feel your body on mine\nOh, maybe that's why I stay\n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\nI could be with someone, making me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down\nJust pick up my keys\nI could let you go and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nKeep coming back\nGuess you can say I'm attached\nLast time we called it a wrap\nI came begging and all that\nYou're like a habit, it's bad\nI gotta have it, it's bad\nOh no, I'm not even mad, no\n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\nI could be with someone, making me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down\nJust pick up my keys\nI could let you go and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nIt's the way you keep me up all night\nIt's the way you make me lose my mind\nEvery time I'm saying one more night\nIt's the way you know I'm yours\nIt's the way you know I'm yours for life\n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\nI could be with someone, making me happy\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love\nI could put my phone down\nJust pick up my keys\nI could let you go and we could let it be\nBut that would be too easy, love\nAnd I don't want no easy love
your voice and songs are amazing, BIG FAN LAUV ♥

Dope man. Love the beat and the lyrics.\nKeep up with this good work.
I wonder how it would be like all stripped down?  More soulful?
Lauv is in the air
His voice changes from one tone to another  and that's amazing
this song just got stuck in my head
Somedays soon when this song hits the big hit, this will be one of the soonest comments

Everyone’s talking about the dear Evan Hansen costume but my first while watching this was, “I’d never be able to wear that la croix costume. My lack of spatial awareness plus no arms to keep balance/break a fall. It’s a clumsy person’s nightmare”.

When I saw the cast I thought it was a youtube joke..\n\nConnor Franta\nConnor 'Fracture'\n\nBut yeah, that works also.
theatre kids where you at???
Do a collab with Dan and Phil!
OH MY GOD DEAR EVAN HANSEN I'M ACTUALLY DEAD
Georgie from 2017 IT while my sister is going to be Pennywise
I will be myself
I’m a simple girl. I see dear Evan Hansen, I click.
I’m definitely not going as one of the most stereotypical Halloween costumes ever..... a witch? Who me?..... no....
Gay Christmas CAN THIS BE A HOLIDAY PLEASE 😂
I DIED WHEN I SAW EVAN IN THE THUMBNAILLLLLL

Just a little tip with the coffee plunger, after you put the water in give it a quick stir and let it sit for 3 minutes with the lid on, and then plunge it down.:))
Can you do an updated skincare routine. Your skin is looking amazing
your skin looking great
Your skin looks amazing at the moment what skin care products are you using ?? 💗💗💗💖💖💖
I love watching Zoe's vlogs especially when she talks about Christmas this early because I'm the same way. I love fall and Christmas and I started listening to Christmas music in June but I have no shame.
I was a extra/background on liar and  the school bits where filmed at my school 😊❤️

I remember when you first showed that turtle neck stone jumper last year! I wanted it so bad but I was always too late :(
Your skin looks so good!!!!
Sorry, but what are conkers?? Are they chestnuts??🌰🌰
as zoe was talking about the coffees and said they go out of date i was drinking tea then checked when it goes out of date and it went out of date in February, great!
I can’t wait until Zoe does Vlogmas again ! 😍
I enjoy your long vlogs sooo much! I love to make me some tea and snuggle up in a cozy jumper and a fuzzy blanket and just watch your vlogs!
does everyone put milk on their scrambled eggs? that is so strange to me
When Zoe said ‘I bright this sprig because it was cute’ she looked like she was contemplating whether she really needed a sprig or any of the stuff she brought😂
love the vlog, but zoe your skin looks amazing!!!!!
I am SO excited for Zoe's Christmas vlogs. There the reason why I live.
Love your dressing gown!!!
Happy 5-year-anniversary!! ❤️

I moved school today and I was quite anxious but I have a bug at the moment so I'm not feeling too good and it's only my first day! I had some not very kind girls who called me horrible things and laughed at me and were friends with me when it suited them, but Zoe u have helped me through it all. Zoe I love you the world!
I'm obsessed with this 💗💗💗💗🍂🍂🍂🍂

I love a long zoella vlog❤❤
Who is excited for vlogmas 🎉🎉❄️❄️❄️❄️
Its not autumn without zoes autumn videos
Im waiting for a Zark vlog😅💗
I'm so ready for Christmas 🎄
EEEK!im literally jumping up and down I always get exited for her vlogs I hope she goes into a vlogging  streek
Your skin looks amazing 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Your coffee might not be turning out so great because it is ground too fine. A french press needs a super coarse grind. Try using a pour over or something with a paper/cloth filter. Your coffee would taste much better! ^_^
You should def do a rly colorful tree, a neutral/ silver and gold tree, defff a red and gold, and omg I'm so excited!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️
A good tip for scrambled eggs is to add parsley and Parmesan into the eggs. Sounds weird ish but tastes amazing!! Ily xx
I’ve been excited for this video since your last vlog 😂❤️
It’s getting close to Xmas yippie   Xx
I love your Autumn videos :)
Narla makes me laugh so much 😂😂😂❤️
Does anyone know what mascara she wears?
So simple but so effective. I cried a little just thinking about who I used to be and how far I came.
Loved this!! Annnnd Colette's pants are super cute :) \n\nXOXOXO
I don't know why but when I closed my eyes, tears just streamed down my face as I remembered my hard times. But it helped as you kept talking. I wish I knew about doing stuff like this when I was in that place of sadness. I love you girls!💕
As soon as Carly said introduce yourself to yourself I started to cry. I needed this so much. Thank you 💓
Thanks, Carlie. That is very helpful. 😊
Collette don't be guarded let karlie love you
Can you guys do challenges again I miss them
Collette are the shaytards making  videos  again????
So sweet
wow i did it with you guys and it was hard looking at me at my worst it almost bought me to tear and then seeing my good embrace it felt so relieving thank you guys for showing me that i can get through the worst by just thinking about all the good that my life will bring.
That made me cry 😢
Are you guys going to volg again
This is an awesome thing to do! I kinda got teary eyed lol
So glad you ladies are all back! You guys really life this mamas spirits!! ❤️
You guys are amazing , this is helping me so much. Thank you ❤️❤️
I love this exercise and I've done it before, it really works! Although I would've loved to see you go into more dept with this exercise. Like who did Colette and Kayli see in front of them in the bad and good times? More examples would make this so much better! We love to hear about YOUR struggles that you've overcome. Please keep this in mind for the next segment. 😘
Don’t understand why carlie not verified or hasn’t more credit becuase I honestly think she amazing inside and out she has the best personality and is an all around nice person
Carlie, this was such a lovely exercise; I thought maybe I'd feel too weird doing it but I decided to follow along and actually found it helpful. Love where the momsview is going! I'm going to keep this exercise in mind
Wow... I needed that! <3
This video was really good. I enjoyed the exercise very much.
I need so help my husband decided to walk away after 21 yrs of marriage  I feel lost
I really want to see all the kids and see how much they have grown
Love you guys!\nNot a huge fan of the extra camera angles... but love ya anyway!!
I would really like to see a video about infertility and its struggles from you guys and maybe an expert and someone who has struggled or is struggling with that. I think it’s a subject that’s not talked about frequently and something that affects a lot of women and couples. Love you girls!
I really enjoyed doing this :) felt a bit silly but think it worked to remind me of how far I’ve come in my life
I couldn't do it. yet. But I feel like my friends would love this, sounds so amazing
These type of things don't do anything for me.
I think a GREAT show idea would be top self help books yall have liked, or a book club type thing.
Real moms have dirty windows. 😉 Good to see it's not just me. 👍🏻
It looks like collete is crying
Totally teared up while doing this. Thank u for reminding us to love ourselves through the good and the bad. Loving this new moms view!!!!
I love how genuine The Mom's View is!
That was beautiful! Thank you!!
dont like carlies self help on her channel either.i am a hippy and fake hippy isnt helpful
That’s bullshit she got cheated and she acting like he didn’t do anything wrong
*when are the shaytards going to post again*
I love this
That made me cry, imagining myself at my weakest and giving that person a hug. Thank you Carlie!
Mommytard is so sad at the end :( stay strong and think about yourself first cause nobody will no matter who you are.
How great. I love that. Thanks so much for sharing. \nSince I don't have any kids of my own yet, I wanted to know if any of you guys had fertility issues leading up to any of your pregnancies or even if you know people who have or do.\nI have been struggling with infertility for the last 3 years and I'm trying to trust in God. I'm having a really hard time knowing what my next step should be and if having kids is really what God wants for me. I am LDS and there is definitely some expectations I know that there is only so much I can control but this is something that is really really difficult for me to not feel shame and guilt about. I'm 29 and been married for 9 years for the first 6 years of my marriage we used contraceptive. I think, Did I screw this up? Is it my fault my body isn't working? Did I miss my window for having children? and all the time everyone is asking me when I'm going to have a baby. It was easier to tell people that we were waiting than it is now to say we are trying and failing. Any insight or even just words of advice you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks!
I love you guys, I really needed this. thank you.
Dear ladies, still so happy you are back. \nI would be interested for you to talk about cancer and breast cancer. Last year my mom has gone through her second round of breast cancer, the first was 10 years ago. It was a tough time and I learned so much about cancer and about myself. I feel like my mom, though right now she is struggling with depression, is growing stronger and learning so much about herself and her own strength because of the disease. What is hard about it for her right now and for me during the last year is accepting that you sometimes are weak and that you are not always at your best and you are still you and you are still a genuinely perfect person just the way you are. My thoughts, I would love to hear yours. \nBest wishes from Germany! \nOh PS I'll be in Santa Barbara, California and in south Utah the next couple month. If you do any kind of meet up I am dieing to meet you. You gave me so much strength, knowledge and are a big role model for me! Love you
Dark hard times make the amazing times even better :) life is about learning, sometimes we learn things we don’t want to but it’s worth it in the end.
One day I want to be this carefree
I absolutely needed this today because sometimes it's hard to remember that we won't always be at our worst... I love you ladies and thank you for having these chats with us. I feel like you three are the sisters i always longed for. \n\nAlso a Friday show that would be amazing: How to not lose yourself when becoming a parent/wife?
so glad this is back 😭💗
Welp. If Susan watches it then it must go to the trending page!
Cathal love ❤ all girls Cathal like you girl \nI a am little sissy girl mistress
I love Carlie's top where is it from ????
I'd love if there was a self-help video like this every week :)
Omg I literally cried I needed that thank u
I really liked the exercise Carly!
Ugh this is why I love you guys. ❤️
As I did the exercise with you girls I was so taken back by how differently I viewed my best self and worst self. How they almost seemed like completely different people. Thank you for this and for helping me reconcile my worst and best self. Self love is something I am working on too!
That was.... unexpectedly emotional! Jeez! From an overweight, suicidal college freshman to a happy wife, mom and fit triathlete. I've come a long way, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that through all the daily details!
I loved this exercise. It made me so incredibly emotional because I know my younger self would be so proud of who I am today. Made me want to go back and hug the little girl that thought things would never get better and just hold her and tell her it's all gonna be okay.
This exercise was interesting.  Because as I am  urrently at my lowest in self esteem right now. It felt good to hug my old fun self and have my fun self hug my new sad self. It's weird to say, but it made me feel like I was being a friend to my new self as well as my new self felt relief for having a friend to hug and admire.
Thank you Carlie! This is a life saver! You're the best!
In love with Carlie's top! 😍
Oh mom's view gals, I needed this more than you know right now.
Wow, it's been a year since I was at my worst. Suicidal, unmotivated, etc. I'm doing so much better now. People keep telling me that I look different, beautiful, and happier without even knowing my situation. Improved mental health shows on the outside too, I guess! What a great exercise!
Carle I did it with you and it was great. Thank you
Does anybody know the name of this exercise or who created it? cheers :)
Thank you this helped a lot! high school is such a struggle for me competition in seat placement in music , being a clumsy/awkward lab partner, mediocre grades, parents saying I'm a failure and other insecurities I have. I feel like if I pay attention to the good times all the bad times will gradually vanish away and I will become the person I see myself as in the future :) at one point last year I was considering suicide because of all the academic and social obstacles I've been going through. I hope I inspired someone today and that the bad times are what make us a better person today :)
Hey an idea for next Friday could be to update us on all of your kids and maybe bring some guest stars (the kids)
I'm not sure this would work for me. I can't imagine meeting myself during the darkest time, because I'm currently in the darkest time right now
Thank you!  This was so great!  I'm leading a bible study for women called Broken, and Im going to share this video as one of the exercises we do during our time together.
Dont mind me being immature but this remind me a TON of Joy & Sadness from Inside Out! 😍😍😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm going to try this. After Vegas incident, I dont feel like a good role model for my kidsk as i come undone. If I can stop and say the chances are small and find the best me that knows through prayer and what I've learned I can pull myself together. I'll try anything. :(
Nice exercise thanks for sharing! Sweet lady's.....💞😊
Carlie I'm obsessed with your shirt!!! Where did you get it?
Can you guys pleaseeeee do a nother challenge
Love this exercise! Thanks for sharing! What an awesome perspective!
This is beautiful!!!! Thank you!!!!!
I loved that exercise!
The BBQ at the back makes so much more sense! Last video it created a weird person shaped shadow :)
Really really loved this video
OK. only 5 seconds eyes closed aaaand hello tears! lol thank you Carlie It was an awesome exercice.
I like moms
Should have Shaycarl as a guest. Seeing how he is a selflove specialist. Only give him a twitter account and some lube.
Thank you so much for this exercise. I haven't been feeling like my authentic self lately, and this has just made me step back and reminded me I'm a strong individual.
Thank you! Yes, the exercise was  helpful, I got teary eye.
Carlie! You have no idea what that did for me. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart .
That helped a lot thanks guys 😊 I looked at myself two years ago when I was self harming and hateting myself. Then I put the person who I am today with her. Today I am happy loved and pregnant with a baby boy. I had them hug each other and the one who was self harming  was so happy to see the me today and was happy to see me/herself pregnant.  God had a plan for me and today I finally realized what it was supposed to be.  Thanks again ☺❤
That was wonderful. The exercise; Carlie's explanations and advice were so on point and just so good. I will remember this, use it, and share it. Thank you.
I don't know if I can be my best again, but ill try my best. Thank you ladies
I cried. I seriously cried. I loved this exercise
Love you all ❤️💛💚💙💜
so love you guys!!
Definitely got teary eyed through that <3 thanks mums!
Selp helf
needed thay Thanks Moms!!!
Love this exercise!!
I would love to see more girly stuff, girl chats, makeovers, makeup, hair, clothes talk and more. You should go on a girls trip and just relax, do some shopping, get massage, manicures etc
Ahh I love this very helpful. It was super weird to think about those 2 people because those are very different for me at least. Love this and love you lovely ladies ❤️
I didn’t even know it until now, but I really really REALLY needed this today! xoxo 😘 ❤️
Thank you. I needed to see this video
That was so nice. I cried to be honest. I've been going through a rough time and this helped. Thank you.
Has Carlie had plastic surgery or something because her skin looks so tight!
I thought the middle girl was the mom from shaytards
my first phone was a firefly omg
My god this was my first phone too
Your Dad absolutely cracks me up - I love your videos with him, and your relationship with him :)
Emma I love u but...\nI'm so sorry. Ur eyebrows bother me.
Omfg, John has the same phone cover as my mum
Sure I've watched a buzz feed video with the exact same idea \n\nNOT HATING \n\njust saying what I've observed \n\nGREAT VIDEO THOUGH
Answer to your question do we need smart phones   NO!! \nSmart Phones get smarter and the user get dumber \nYou should upgrade to the Nokia 3330, it had internet connection. ( Really I did)
Do we need smartphones? Absolutely not! But we use them because they are very handy 😃
turns out to be a nokia\nedit:called it
Yesterday I saw Emma live at the guides big gig, she was amazing!
I have a nexus 4 I don't use... don't project yourself on everyone else just look around not as many people as you think are glued to a phone...
....is this entire video a satire?
My mum had that phone and i was so jealous
Omg u sounded amazing at the big gig!!!!
What?! I am 16! And I had that phone on my elementary school😂😂
That is the same ring tone that was on the Satellite phone that was in Jurassic Park III  and was found in Dinosaur poo.
Emma dancing around and playing the Nokia ringtone was really adorable
wow I remember this sound 0:00
I'm travelling around Vietnam and I hear that ringtone everyday! Ps where's your jacket from?
did anyone not get a notif for this vid?
I used to own the Nokia 3310 as well.  You can knock someone out with it.
I'm late to this video, but omg that ringtone takes me back!
now you can do a full gameplay of snaek\n\ntwo
I acc love your new style of videos
the chat function was like threaded messages. like, one message thread with one person.
GO TO LONDON ON WEDNESDAY, IM GOING WITH MY CLASS XD
I had three games and I didn't even understand one of them
1:52 yes emma that is the iphone 8. No difference. So instead of giving you a real iphone 8 they gave you a phone with the exact equal functions
Please does ANYONE know where Emma's denim jacket is from?? 😍😍😍
You where amazing at big gig
awww i remember my first phone, one of those nokias too. i hated it but like, it did work damn well
/i was just wondering, are you thinking of releasing some new merchandise? i was going to order some but idk whether to wait for new merch or if that will be a long time in the future?
I saw you at the big gig, and you were absolutely great!!!! <3
I want to be in the early 2000's because that's when emo was more popular.
Yessssss you're chilling in Brighton Emma what a g
Hey Emma blackery I saw you live today at big gig and OMG I was one of my only people out of my pack who knew you! I love you Emma!
In a couple years i should use my iPhone 5 like when im twenty something
that ringtone is the sound my washing machine makes
You did amazing the big big today I loved all your songs
idk why but the beginning reminds me so much of jacksfilms..i like it :D
Hope u see this emma. You were great at the big gig and i loved your performance i cant believe you got to meet caspar lee!!!! I hope you enjoyed it yourself love ya x
I love this video
All these years hearing that same ringtone and I had no idea my dad had the Nokia ringtone
The first phone I ever had! I was 9 years old when I got it . This is so entertaining!
I wear I thought your dad in the background of the bank scene was totally going to call you after you just said you didn't want to set it off!
Hey emma\nI love your videos \nI saw you at the big gig\nit was amazing\nyours was  my favourite performance :)
Regular Snake was in the 3210. That was my SECOND phone. My first phone, when I was 13, was a brick like Motorola. I can't remember the model name but man was it solid. lol. I don't think I ever owned a 3310... But to be fair it was a loooong time ago. sigh.\nYou should have played the Nokia ringtone and done a Trigger Happy: ie, shouted HELLOOO?? lollol
That was also my first phone, that remembered me so much of my childhood and I'm only 16 XD
My first phone ever was a Dancall HP 2731.\nMy second phone was a Nokia 3210.
General \nSilence \nDiscreet \n\nAh yes the three genders
I m going to see her at the big gig
I hope you didn't drop it by mistake...
Hey emma blackery i know that you were at the girlguides concert! Believe it or not yesterday you made my first concert l just lit up it was the best time of my life thank you
this is completely unrelated to the video but where's your jacket from it's so cute
Did anybody else think that whilst she was talking about not setting off the phone in the bank that her dad on his phone in the background was gonna ring her? \n\nI’d have found that hilarious.
My first phone was nokia 5110. Damn that was at my 6th grade lol first year hs when i got a 3310. Snake and space impact ftw
My first phonebwas in 1998 and i got the Motorola Startac. Flip phone and it pre-dated these, was first phone to have text messaging. Had a green screen and the sim card was the size of a credit card.
I don't know why I was excited when Emma was doing the unboxing part
The auld Lang syne tune genuinely sounds like the bagpipes up here in Scotland on new year 😂
The sad thing about this is that the phone that is your FIRST PHONE is the most up to date phone my grandad has ever owned
I wounder why her daddy loves her, shes got a charming personality.
I called it that it would be a nokia
I wanted to see old phone not new one\nEdit: NeVeRmInD
“I’m gonna become a tech channel”\n.\n.\n.\n“I’m gonna make a gaming channel”
The chat function was for AIM!!!
I literally love Emma so much
I'm surprised that still works considering analog vs digital technology
Are you a fan of Sonic Youth? \nThose phones are sick though.
Jaysus Emma if that airbag goes off you're going to be hurting
Imagine opening a box expecting an overpriced shit apple iPhone and finding a genuinely alright phone. Would rather a brick than an iPhone.
I read this as you getting a phone for the first time
3510i was my first, I was 10 and people my age were having flip up phones, camera. Now 13 years later, iPhone.
Omg the Nokia tone brings back so many memories! 💜📱
WE HAD THE SAME FIRST PHONE
i used to have one of those phones and i loved it
She completely ruined the joke at the beginning
Emma with every beep a past channel of yours dies and some one unsubs due to Demma I'm off to dans dieing channel
I love this lol
Why did you steal Luke's intro? Not cool Emma, not cool.
That reaction to the Nokia instead of the iphone went on for an uncomfortably long time 😂😂
You, I mean you emma, you can dye your hair what ever color, and you would still look amazing.
We now know what she uses as a vibrator
I'M ON THE PHONE!!
the first phone i got was a burner flip phone, it didnt last 2 months
I love your dad and yours relationship
I'm actually considering getting rid of my smartphone for as long as I feel like. Going back to the old nokia flipphone
You were really good at the big gig!!
anyone know the music at 0:08 ?
Merry Xmas has been in my head ever since this video😂
I was 3 in 2000
Lovin the hair
your t-shirt?????????
Unique idea!! Havent since this before. 👌👌👌👌
i miss lucas
Omg JEFF!\nhttps://youtu.be/gUMTX2IOFtI
Buzzfeed will steal this idea pretty soon!
emma google mappery
it's a grower. lollll
oh.
#biggig
THE MAD WITCH OF THE TOY SWAMP CASTS A CURSE OPON YOU!
Why is Chris dressed up as a Witch?
M8, get a hold of your life. Probably move. I suggest you go move to the arctic circle.
Is this an enemy stand?
Is he just blaming us for something that probably had nothing to do with us
The bear has awoken from slumber.
Lol, I hope this is the beginning of the old yard raging Chris, this DUDE is funny!
Why doesn't CWC ever use a comb??
0:23 He turned into sammyclassicsonicfan for a second.
0:59 - I do believe that might just be the last shred of Chris's sanity breaking there folks
Can somebody add subtitles? I can't make out half of this...
I've been following this story everywheres, its amazing how far Chris is taking this.
I want to tell him to stay away from the internet, but its pretty clear he loves the abuse.
I'm tired of this
Reminds me of character from a Ralph Bakshi movie in this one.
You need to clean your room, young man!
This is the lowest I think we have seen Chris so far
I wouldn't be surprised if he shat his pants again like did when sparing w/ Clyde Cash and Billy Mays on IRL. Dirty, Crapped, Briefs Part 2.
This does not even deserve a captains log introduction, *Takes glasses off* BECAUSE THIS IS DEAD SERIOUS
If there's one thing cartoons have taught me, it's that curses by crazy-sounding old women are serious business.
To think this was a guy.\nAnd autistic.\nMight be a good explanation for this... Video?
Chris sounds like he's jizzing for simply stretching his arms out to the camera.
Hope we can see a happy Christine for a long period of time.
we all love to suffer chris
Chris is ageing like a fine wine.
sometimes when I feel like a no hoper I remember that people like this exist somewhere
This is the Chris Chan we all know and-\n\nThis is the Chris Chan we all know!
This is your brain on autism.
this is the worst ronnie james dio song ever.
he literally looks like an old lady screaming
Is it a man or a woman? He or she sounds like this crazy lady from the westboro baptist church!
Bad acting Christine, not worth the oscar
I want normal Chris back.
y'know sometimes i genuinely feel bad for CWC\n(s)he just doesnt know what this looks like to everyone else\n\nlike, sometimes you have a daydream where you suddenly get everything you've ever wanted and never have to do anything ever again. i know i've done that -- like what if you rubbed a fuckin lamp, a genie came out and suddenly you just had everything? that'd be great.\n\nthe difference between CWC and us is that we snap out of it and realize it's a dream.

When is the apology video for the curse coming do you think?
This just reminds me of Brian's mother in Life of Brian.
Look's like classic  Chris is back ROFL.
Well I have a feeling that the trolls are returning
This reminds me of that Monty Python sketch that takes place in Happy Valley. You sound just like King Otto playing the Hammond Organ.
You don't need her. You're the creator of Sonichu for crying out loud. Who did she think she was to boss you around?
Holy crap, I found a new video to terrify those kids for Halloween! Thanks for the wicked witch video, dude!
Was that supposed to be his best Marlin Brando impression?
Ah Chris Chan. It's nice to know that you haven't changed.
10 out of 10 performance, Shaman Chris
This was disturbing to say the least.\nIs this the new Wizard Of Oz Movie? The portrayal of The Wicked Witch  is... interesting.
Seeing as I'm not superstitious or a total fool I'm not at all moved by your melodramatic attempt at cursing others.\n\nYou have to either be spectacularly naive or incredibly thick to think that such a childish display will put fear into anyone seeing as this sort of nonsense hasn't been in fashion since about 1400,
If I had 100 million dollars I would give Chris a million. But then again he would just spend it all on toys and mcdonalds in the first week and then ask for donations for a storage unit to put his new toys in and claim he needs even more money for food and Barb's atkins books.
What's with his eye?
Honestly, it seems as if Chris is the one getting the last laugh. People keep asking why he keeps feeding the trolls, but then again, trolls are the only form of social interaction he can achieve. The trolls are only giving him the attention he desires.
0:53\n\nChris Chan was Sofa King: confirmed.
I'm starting to think this guy might be retarded.
Sounds just like Sonny the Cocoa Puffs bird
I wonder if he realizes that this is all his fault this happened...probably not.
He was SOFA KING WRONG!!!!
One of my dreams is to kick Chris Chan really hard in the nuts and see how he reacts.
0:55 He said 'Sofa King'.

it makes me borderline depressed to think i'd probably just take one for the team and take his virginity
I WILL NEVER PAY FOR A FREE UPDATE!
Angry Joe where you at?
I'll wait until they come out with Ultra Street Fighter 5.
Finally Street Fighter V is good enough to play. Finally!
Free update this is heaven.
I see Capcom finally decided to step up. Hope it's actually good and not just hype.
Come on, Capcom... can Ryu get over the dark hadou already? It's been like 20 fucking years
The dead horse is flogged to mush at this point
And it only took Capcom a year and a half to finally make me, a dirty filthy casual, to consider getting this. Just having Arcade mode does wonders, don't you think?
so the full game was supposed to be out in january we got half game so is this gonna be a content download cause i already have sfv
Why are people complaining about that they need to pay this!? It's also a free update, but you won't get all the Season 1 & 2 characters though. Seriously people... either buy the game, wait for the update or don't buy it. Geez, read the description...\n\nOther than that, I can't wait for the new updated version of Street Fighter V! That's how it should've looked like before! Thanks Capcom for making Street Fighter V Arcade Edition! #CapcomRules
To all of you people saying it's free 😂 \n0:59
Okay guys im planning to double dip since I have not bought any season passes and only unlocked 3 characters thru FM and bought some dlc costumes too. So what I want is to buy this edition to get the characters. Do I get to retain my bought costumes and stages ?
This not gonna change the fact that you came out with a incomplete game still
game still SUCKS SACK ill go play usf4 on practice mode, so i can throw a fireball with my foot with ken
Maybe it will sneak to Xbox now
This mode shouldve been available in the game since day1, shoddy practice that hurt more sales because lets face it console gamers and some pc gamers dont care about online only play and go on forums and alot more say this release is too late theyve moved on from this game. Have to say capcom even with no xmen in the marvel game and no arcade mode it really does stink where midway is the better fan friendly fighting game company. MKX, MK9 and Injustice1 and 2 really are not bad games and I find to be really good
Congratulations, it only took almost TWO YEARS to give a game mode that MUST come from START and FREE in the launch game.\nThat's the new idea now ?? sell GAME MODES like DLC
Anyway since I already own the game but didn't get any DLC, i'll just sell my current copy and then get this edition to get it with the DLC.  At least that way i'll be spending $40 instead of $50 on DLC? Smh still kinda a loss though.
Now I have MORE of a reason to get Street Fighter V when I get a PS4 Pro.
Oh no Chun-Li showed her underwear. SFV Arcade Edition banned at ESPN now.
Finally over the years..arcade edittion now...take all my money alr!!!!
Finally, damn
fuck you capcom for not giving so much importance to Ken when he's one of the best in All Street fighter series and most anticipated Character in online and on Pro tour Competition and winner plus Finalist,  they didn't even Put him on this trailer and gave him a shitty role in SFV's story mode when he deserves much better storyline along side Ryu and guile  *raises middle finger*
Put it on Switch and I’ll buy it.
This would've allowed the game to fully capitalize on the market, had it been available on release. While it will be a nice addition to the game, business wise, it may be a bit too late. Only us who already bought the game will benefit with the new v triggers and stuff.
Glad to see the game is finally leaving beta.
lol they finally finished the game....
Thought you guys said there were NOT to be any new versions of the game, just the initial release.
GIVE US Oro and Sean Please
It took them this long to put in an arcade mode? I feel like it was forever ago when they added the story mode but I'll be honest beating the original street fighter was more fun. Street Fighter five was better than street fighter the movie the game though.. can't even force myself to make it through that game.
Good move capcom now make the right choices for infinite and things will go your way drop a huge graphics patch music adjustments and a massive roster overhaul
holyshit arcade mode is it true?
Street Fighter is vastly superior to Mortal Kombat.
SFV is not doing fine and MVCi is rising fast, so Capcom need to buff SFV to keep SFV alive.
how everyone says how cool and nice this is from capcom.\nThis is something that should have been in the game right from the start.
So its a free update for those who bought sfv
OMGOMG THATS WHAT MAKES CAPCOM A GREAT COMPANY!!!
Now what we need is the version MVCI arcade complete no more dlc edition
Better fix bullshit in this game balrog,cammy,and fucking zangief so  god damn tired of getting grabbed a light speed can't even do a combo with his bitch ass around
And the third update going to be super street fighter 5 and the final updated going to be ultra street fighter 5 with 60 playable characters?, i hope so
Shit Fighter got a bit better now , but it still a piece of shit. Took CrapCom all this time to have an Arcade mode which were suppose to come out upon game release , not DLC.
Man i need a strory mode between Ryu and Akuma!!\n2 V triggers \nNew stages\nNew characters\nBonus stages\nArcade mode\nExtra battle mode\nCAPCOM YOU ROCK!!
Are characters gonna be free too?
I can't believe it's been 30 years for this franchise
If I buy this version, will my christmas Juri dlc transfer
Fucking finally Jesus Christ
We were sold the beta version, so MVCI I will wait for the free update and not buy DLC
This is what Street Fighter wanted, Dhalsim's brother Dhalsim said paint.
Just one question.I have season 1 pass but not season 2,will this effect me if i cant get it for a free update?.i got season 1 pass on day one of release with the collectors edition.
The update it's free, but the season 1 and 2 characters not. Right?
It's obvious that all of those dislikes are from people who didn't buy the game.
Whos coming for season 3 tell us Capcom
So, the DLC characters will become free?
*Phone rings and Sagat answers\nSagat: What? \nCapcom: We aren't doing too well.\nSagat: .....on my way
Nice only 2 more years for ultra sfv
I have a Xbox.
Remember the SFV will not have the same shit treatment as sf4/ssf4/usf4? ... look at this
Ehh should have released a complete package in the first place
HOPESTAR OF CAPCOM\nGIVE ME THE FAME, THE MONEY, THE GLORY OF ARCADE EDITION
Except I as a day one player still have to grind endlessly to unlock all characters(or cave and pay up) while Arcade buyers get a code to unlock them right away. One step forward 2 steps back seems to be par for the course with Capcom these days.
i love street fighter
Nice games almost out of beta
Best fighting game e ver!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I'm guessing I'm head to the arcade, cause tk7 arcade ass I'm huge tekken fan myself but come OK harada just 5 matches tk6 arcade was a lot better but he well learned, I bet sense ono put arcade in it harada going to compete well sure as hell love competition 
If the leaks are true, people who buy this will actually get bamboozled because they'll have to grind Fight Money to unlock the DLC characters instead of having them right away, a grind which of course (Capcom being Capcom) can be dodged by just buying the currency directly.
Yay another beta game being sold for $60
Hey look, more content that should've been a launch. Why are we excited again? Because it's free?
wait they're not making an xbox one version..........................\n.................,............................,\nFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This game has been out for almost 2 years. Like it's great that it's getting a update, but street fighter 4 was a better game.
Too fucking late, this turd died a year ago and still stinks up your fan trust Capcom.
It's a *completely free* Update of a game that cost 18.99-$20 max in stores.\nTake that damn dislike off the video, Capcom did okay with this one.
Time to redownload my SFV
so exiting over 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AT LAST! FUCK! %&$%#%$*%#(!^(#^ Slow CRAPCOM!

Still no Joudan Sokutogeri for Ryu smh
Este mensaje va para Capcom,\nSi queréis que el juego triunfe y que sea un éxito en ventas, tenéis que añadir a la edición arcade el pase de temporada 3 y 4 también. Aparte, empezar el juego con todos los escenarios desbloqueados, y tener la posibilidad de desbloquear todos los trajes, incluidos los premium con el fight money. En resumidas cuentas, la gente que compre el Arcade Edition, que lo tenga todo sin tener que realizar ningún pago en el futuro, eso haría que yo mismo comprara esta nueva edición y eso que pagué los 70 Euros de Street Fighter V. Para que lo entendáis mejor, echar un vistazo al Battlefield 1 Revolution, que inlcuye todo el contenido y los próximos DLC's en un único pago,  39,95 Euros/Dólares.
Dear Capcom,\n\nIf you're gonna make Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition Awesome then ever, here's what you gotta do.\n\n1. Characters\nBlanka\nE. Honda\nSagat\nSakura\nDan\nGuy\nCody\nSodom\n\n2. I want Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition on the Xbox One. Because I don't own PS4. I really really REALLY want Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition on the Xbox One so bad.\n\nI just want to let you know I'm not telling what to do. I'm only asking you. It's for the fans.\n\nSincerely,\nAlec James Rathermel
.... but there is no arcade cabinet
There's a misconception that's every is free. IT'S NOT.  For the people that bought the original SF5, you still have to pay for the season 1 and 2 DLC characters....that's not included in this update for you guys
FUCK YOU CAPCOM , you dont give the dlc for people who've already played your unfinished game????
What's up with your hand movements? Is that a trademark of your videos or something?
I split because Critics are giving the movie good ratings with 7/8 out of 10, Film Fans are giving it excellent ratings with 10/10 and general audiences seem uninterested. I haven't seen the movie but, I think the answer is somewhere in the middle.
I really want to see a spoiler video from you about this movie. There’s so much to talk about
Well done Jersey for not shying away from an insane running time. The movie could've been under 2 hours and been great. Instead it was overly long. I think it spoiled it for me
Watched the movie over the weekend, after having watched the 1982 one twice. As an animation & art enthusiast, it was absolutely breathtaking - I was sitting through the entire movie with my mouth wide open. The movie is full of haunting visuals, incredibly immersive audio & a whole lot of substance & heart. I whole-heartedly recommend watching it in a cinema, if you can, because this movie really benefits from it.
I like the old Blade Runner, but I do very much agree that the pacing in the old one and the new one are both just awful. Great ideas, philosophical questions about humanity and special effects are what makes Blade Runner important, but goodness gracious was this new one full of dull characters. The most lively character was Harrison Ford's. Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto are both phenomenal actors in my opinion, but they were both so crippled by their characters in this film. They didn't get the opportunity to showcase their talents in this one. The plot was also rather cut and dry. I respect everyone's opinion but that's just mine, and I figured I'd share it even though no one really cares.
This movie was bad ass
I like how Stuckmann didnt give away any of the plot
I love the original. Do not like this one. I think the two movies are very different movies, in their storytelling approach.
Not hard pressed to see a sequel made some 30 yrs. after the first movie.
For me its a near cinematic perfection as you can get .I liked it when i first saw it on video long after its original release.I grew to love it and now its my number one movie of all time so far.I did not get to that point right away but its a film you see say hey Harrison Ford hes good lets watch it.Oooh effects intense bad guy that isnt really a simple bad guy.Later you think about the films themes and start to theorise.I watched the various cuts and you started to see more  of Ridleys original vision and then you get the final cut.This film has been like a love affair.Attraction interest mystery intrigue discovery  love.Yep im a fan no i dont have bits of the set or one of Harrison Fords ties.Idont go to comicon dressed as one of the characters.I just love the film
This movie seriously sucked, I don't understand what the hype is about. The story barely chugs along and is way too predictable. Then there are several moments that to arrive at a destination in the plot, the story negates all logic to get there. The audio was completely out of place and sounded like a speaker was being unplugged (staticy). Ryan Gosling was awful, zero emotion. Granted he didn't play his usual smug/prick self that he usually does, but he really was just reading dialogue. But the worst part about this (outside of the 3 hr run time of boredom) is that it wants you to think that it is incredibly deep, thought provoking and artsy. The reality is that this film is shallow, predictable and generic; making it feel completely pretentious. During my screening, the guy next to me feel asleep and several people walked out. Please save your money.
I've tried watching the original (final cut) twice, can't get through it. Saw 2049 in IMAX yesterday. I dozed off in the first 20 minutes and then a Nolan-esque bass sound woke me up. I was a huge fan of the way they did the opening logos. Pacing was up and down, but Gosling and Ford were fantastic. 3/5.
Two things were good about this movie: 1) the cinematography and artwork I guess was special, 2) the naps I got while trying to watch it. Long movie for nothing and the story is super weak.
I found the original pretty boring, but I really like 2049, after seeing 2049 I kind of want to go back and watch the original and see if my opinion on it has changed.
didn't love the movie
Thought the first one was boring, but I really enjoyed the new Blade Runner 2049.
I didn’t see the first, this movie is one of my favs now
I saw the original twice in a theater, yes, I know, I'm old... but this one, the 2049 edition, I just saw it in iMax, and I think I'm going to see it three times... could Denis Villeneuve be the new Ridley Scott, or even better ? what a feast for the eyes and mind, the best follow-up I ever saw. If you're a sci-fi fan, or not, go see it
Love first BR. This was better then I expected, but still kinda meh .. main thing - no music. First is all about music for me. It's more like LP. You play it when you have the right mood for it. This one doesn't have music (for most part). It only has atmospheric sounds ..and that just won't cut it for me. I don't feel like watching it ever again.
SO glad that the thing attatched to the plot with the unicorn is kept subtle. Every single time I watched this trailer I kept saying to the person next to me : But this can't be canon because unicorn!! Damn glad unicorn is still as vague as ever.
I feel sorry I yawned so much during the movie.
Will there be a sequel
So to answer your question: Yes, it is absolutely possible to be a fan of this movie, even though you are not a fan of the original! I was born in 1995 and even though I really liked the story and concept of the original Blade Runner movie, I just couldn't stand the aesthetics of it. The whole visual style just made me feel so uncomfortable while watching it (kind of similar to the movie Brasil) that I couldn't enjoy it as a whole. That is to say I aknowledge, that it was a very groundbreaking movie that deserves the many fans it has, just for me personally it was not as enjoyable! \nNow Blade Runner 2049 brought the same qualities as described before just with a different, more modern visual style. So now that I could actually not only stand looking at it without feeling uncomfortable, but actually be amazed and stunned by the imigary, I was just blown away by this movie! \nSo I love this movie and I think it is very unfortunate, that I can't enjoy the first Blade Runner the way it would deserve it!
i caught a matinee today for it and i'm glad i just paid $5.75 to see it. it wasn't terrible but it wasn't that great either.
Saw it in IMAX today...people, THIS and Godfather II are the best sequels ever, and BLADE RUNNER 2049 is the greatest sci fi film EVER. My GOD...I feel like it's 1977 and I'm 13 and I just saw STAR WARS. Movie of the Year...it's the Sgt. Pepper album of science fiction films.
I loved this fucking movie
Who else just skips to rating?\nFYI 4:54 I disagree...
I loved it. My favorite movie of the year so far. I kinda don’t want a sequel but who knows.
I like the original, but I love this one way more
I thought it was visually stunning, the soundtrack was great, the acting was great but I thought it was too long and got boring at times
it was so much better than that stupid first one. and the one with vin deisel in it. now I want my sexbots and flying car in the next 30 years.
i was not aware whatsoever about the plot of blade runner itself when i got into the theatre to watch this.  I didn't knew who the director was and what i was walking into. That being said, i liked it and definitely would like to watch it again having a bit more of background info. Some nerdy things i loved was the typography and the whole concept design of the city and the futuristic world. The music, if you asked me what would my soundtrack song is for an apocalypse yep this whole soundtrack takes the price. I loved how minimalistic it was compared to every comercial movie out there nowadays.
I'm glad this movie took almost 3 hours to show us this world and tell us this story. Heck, I'm watching it again!
Well, I wasn't a fan of the first movie and I saw one of the more recent cuts a few years ago, so don't know if it was the Final cut, but . . . I think I love this movie. The first time I tried to watch the Director's cut of BR 20 years ago I fell asleep thirty minutes into it. It took 20 years to finally watch it all the way through to the end and even then I started checking my phone and web surfing during the dull parts. I did a lot of surfing. But this movie, I was totally into. There was just one time I almost dosed a little and that was during a quiet moment in between Zimmer's new BWAHs score ,plus my theater now has these comfy recliners. I think this will be in my top five this year.
Review Westwood's Blade Runner game BEFORE IT'S GONE FOREVER\n\nhttps://www.myabandonware.com/game/blade-runner-a43
For anyone who watches Short Films, We just released our first one.. Written and Directed by a 16 year old. Go Check It out on our Channel and let us know what you think!
Jeremy is the man, but I really disagree in this one.\n2049 is so f. amazing.\nIt deserved an Awesometacular rating
The movie is worst like this review
Answer to your question: I really don't like Blade Runner, found it boring and didn't get why it's such a classic, although I can appreciate the influence it's had. However, I absolutely LOVED Blade Runner 2049. All the best parts of the original were here, but better, and the movie itself just blew me away.
Didn’t watch “Blade Runner 2019” but find this movie interesting, long and tiring at some points as you said, but interesting 😜 BTW love you reviews 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
The thing I really didn't like about 2049 was that you didn't see anyone walking around the city. Like, ever. Never at all. It's just weird.
At a runtime of 2:43 minutes, I think it was a bit too long. 2:30 probably would have been about the perfect length. I can't tell you how happy I was that this didn't try to appeal to a wider audience. It didn't stink of Hollywood which was incredibly refreshing.
I loved the first bladerunner and I hated this one...
Agree spot on, great cinematic , a little long.
The original (even with the voice over... the one seen in UK theatres) was and is a master piece, which is why 35 years later it's still relevant. I would guess that when the dust settles, say in 6 months, BR 2049 will already be forgotten, precisely for the reason that it does not enhance or expand on our understanding of future suggested by the original. What a wasted opportunity. Typical of Hollywood!
I went to see it yesterday. I was so worried that it will be an action movie for the sake of action - good it wasn't, uff.
Without watching the prequel this movie becomes too confusing and you sit in the movie theatre like:What just happened ? What does this mean ? and so on ;D
Christ I didn't realise how many of Jeremy's fans like solely fast paced superficial action blockbusters.
After watching this movie twice, I finally feel ready to comment. *SPOILERS BELOW!* (It's definitely worth a second viewing. It's a dense and rich movie and you will catch small things upon second viewing that you missed the first time.)\n\nIf you saw and liked the original Blade Runner (any version), you'll definitely like this movie! If you like cerebral, thoughtful movies, you'll almost assuredly like this movie. If you don't mind movies like Solaris, 2001, Her, and even the original Star Trek movie, then you'll probably like this movie. But if none of those movies appeal to you, or you don't like deliberately slow-paced movies, or you prefer lots of action, or you can't sit still for 2.75 hours, then maybe you might not like it.\n\nPersonally, the original is one of my all-time faves, and, after watching the new movie twice in two days, I'm simultaneously both more impressed than before and more critical than after the first viewing. I dare say that I enjoyed it more than before. I especially like the first half, before he meets Deckard. Up until that point, it's nearly perfect.\n\nI must be contrarian and say that I am underwhelmed with the score. It's either unobtrusive ambient synth, or a nearly (and at times exactly) direct copy of the Vangelis original (especially the Tears in Rain ending), or over-the-top blown-out bass which sounds like an airplane landing. And I still feel like the super loud parts were overdone, especially in scenes that didn't seem to call for it.\n\nNow for the nitpicks:\n\n--> When K first thought he might be human, why didn't he use that device to check his eye for a serial number?\n\n--> After failing the baseline test, he was told he had 48 hours. So why didn't he know that the LAPD would be able to follow him? It's never revealed if they have tracking devices implanted into them or not, but he at least should have ditched his police-issue car.\n\n--> Why didn't JOI see the prostitute replicant place the tracking device in his coat? (Was she turned off? Why? We hear the chime later, but never see him turn her on.) The assumption is she always watching, just like when she knew that K hadn't told the police chief about the birthdate from his memory.\n\n--> Why did Wallace have to send Deckard off world in order to torture him? You mean he doesn't have everything he needs on Earth, where he is and where he makes the new replicants?\n\n--> How was K even able to track Love when she was transporting Deckard off world?\n\n--> Why didn't K kill Deckard? I had thought he would side with the replicant rebellion. (Maybe he still felt a bit like Deckard was his father even after he realized that it wasn't true, but still...)\n\n--> Why would they think that everyone will assume Deckard drowned? Come on. Wouldn't it be more logical to assume that Wallace would not be satisfied until he found a body...? Surely they have the technology to find it.\n\n--> I don't think K should have died from his knife injuries. Yes, it was a vicious wound, but look at all he did AFTER receiving the injury. Also, they made it clear earlier in the movie that replicants are tough and can handle injuries that would likely kill a normal human.\n\n--> Love is a cool villain, but she was still a bit too one-dimensional. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more depth and more ambiguity, (much like Roy Baty from the original where he saves Deckard at the end so he has someone to watch him die).\n\nIMO, I didn't like K's apparent death - too much trying to mirror the Roy Baty death scene. If anything, I think it would have been more poetic and made more sense for Deckard to have died. K should have lived to join and become a leader of the upcoming replicant rebellion (which would make a great topic for the next movie, BTW).\n\nYet, all of this being said, I still think I liked it even more after the second viewing, especially the first half/two-thirds. The longer the movie goes, the more convoluted it becomes and the more the thread unravels.\n\nIt's still a great movie! But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have flaws. It could have been even better... Nevertheless, I'd still give it a 9/10.
I agree that the movie is too long because there are slow parts which have little to do with the story. \nIt's worth seeing. BR 2049 is beautifully photographed, the music is good and the special effects are effective. And it expands on the world of the original. 7/10 for me. \nBut 1982/Final Cut Blade Runner is a great film without the drawbacks of the sequel.
I have only ever seen the directors cut of the first movie and I did enjoy it quite a bit. The acting seemed a lot more natural in it and it didn't drag as much. This movie was torturous.
I went to see My Little Pony: The Movie instead....
i went to the cinema with very low hopes..but thankfully i had to re-evaluate that.the movie was actually awesome..from the plot that keeps on pumping questions rather than answers, to the Vangelis-esque soundtrack..it was a blast for me. Some pople thought that it would be too different from the first movie, which had a very slow pace, but this one manages to keep it out nicely
This film delivers so hard, beautiful and captivating, 10/10
is so existecialist. what defines ones identity? and btw, spoiler,  his name is freaking joseph K. hello kafka.
I just saw BR 2049 today and I was completely involved in it. Sometimes I have a problem with slow burners because the atmosphere just isn't there to keep you immersed but that was not the case with this film. I really liked it and the story is very good in my opinion. I've read reviews about it being a sequel that wasn't necessary and such but I completely disagree, there were alot of questions and ambiguous things in the first and I think that this film expanded on them and answered a few of those questions. It's a long film but I highly recommend it. 4.5/5 from me.
Watching this movie high af was actually super difficult LOL visuals are soooo good everyone who loves good film in general should see this movie
I personally don’t need to be feed the answer, both movies give enough info to say that Deckard is a replicant.
I preferred the original film. Something for me was missing in this sequel, like an itch you can't scratch. The shorts fleshing out the history of what happened  after the original and leading up to 2049 was  more intriguing. A  story told from The Blackout would have been more compelling.
Do a spoiler review
bruh, i full thought that was Scarlett Johansson on the poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick - to - the - bait
Finally a reviewer that doesn't completely dick ride this movie
Fucking blade runner 2049... What a bore fest. I nearly fell asleep 20 minutes in. It's so dull.
I liked this movie more than the original.
This was a BORING 3 hour movie
I got distracted by the strand of hair lol.
That strand of hair stole the show....
I fuckin loved the movie. Best sci fi movie in ages
Blade Runner 2049 is on par with The Godfather Part 2 and the Dark Knight as the best movie sequel ever made. It will taught in Film Schools one day. 10/10
it was surprisingly shittest movie i ever watched
I just watched the original..I don't get it. Maybe I need to watch it a few more times or the other versions but this really didn't appeal to me and I'm going to skip 2049 :/
Such a boring movie. I had no emotion watching this weird take on what the world would be like in the Blade Runner universe. Just a shit show. A police captain and medical doctor is killed and nothing happens to the killer? 2049 and not one damn security camera? Leto's character just kills his creations on a whim...wtf.
I didn't really like the original but I loved this one. For me the original was boring and Deckard barely did anything.
Jeremy please watch and review black sails.For your own sake.
I thought it was epic. Great story that expanded upon the Blade Runner universe with great characters, awesome visuals and an amazing soundtrack
I didn't dig the original as much, but absolutely loved this one
Blade Runner 2049 is a worthy successor to Blade Runner.  This is an amazing film!  Go see it.
Wished it was longer! 😀
Should I watch the original?
This film should've been 2-hours long. I was so so so bored, and so much of it was shot in-doors. Like wtf I wanted to be outside with all the sci-fi awesomeness.
I never saw first movie my father has saw original movie he liked original movie my father didn't like this sequel it was confusing to him in end and fucking music in movie was dam loud gave me dam headache after movie no movie ever gave me headache after listing to soundtrack in movie but this movie has I fell sleep first half end half was better
i was stunned at how even more fleshed out this world became in this sequel. i want to live in it...until i became too depressed then i would want out.\n\ni saw it in IMAX and this is the best way.
I watched it last night, to me the movie lacked any of the luster that made the first film such a visual delight. As for the plot, the first hour was strong. Following those initial 60 minutes, the film falls apart and loses the strong direction it had, devolving into a series of plot holes and ridiculous deus ex machinas. \n\nI was very disappointed.
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: Depressed? Tired of life? Considering suicide or mass murder after having seen Blade Runner 2049? Then we have the solution for you!!!! Join us in signing the petition demanding that Harrison Ford should stop acting and retire once and for all! And don't worry there are plenty of mediocre actors ready to take his place...like Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto! Join us and make a difference! PAID FOR BY THE COALITION OF PEOPLE TIRED OF PAYING TO SEE HARRISON FORD'S BORED FACE IN MOVIES. Harrison Ford did not approve of this message.
Not a big fan of the original, but I think 2049 is amazing.
Absolutely love the original blade runner, thought that 2049 had a good direction and story but was way too slow and made it easy to get lost. There were also a few scenes that I thought were pretty pointless and I think if this were a 2 hour movie it would have been better. Max I'd give us a 6/10
What about the Film WoodShock
Original blade runner was style no substance if you read the book you come out with the replicants have more humanity than the humans so what defines a human being when you watch blade runner (original) you come out thinking is Harrison Ford a human or replicant Scott totally made a hash of an excellent concept at least with 2049 you don’t give two shits about Harrison Ford being a human or not so it’s 100 times better than the original
This movie sucked soooooo bad!!!!
meth much?

I am going to post some short videos on Instagram (@ChrisFixit) answering some questions like if I was able to make a U-turn instead of a K-turn now. Also I am almost at 100k followers on Instagram so be sure to follow! Once I hit 100k I am doing a giveaway of ChrisFix swag with 7,000 winners!!!
More videos more videos MORE VIDEOS
So... no Soapy Wooder this time??
Awesome job!
What about rack and pinion steering?
Get new rims D:
MORE VIDEOS PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Your Car Getting Better
Amazing!!
I LOVE YOU
Plz show us how to convert drum brakes to calipers setup
plz do a drift vid
You hack cars 🚗 man...!
great Vid!!!!
You shut space your back wheels aswell
I have a 2017 Nissan Maxima and I don't get such tight turns. I wish I knew how to find out how to get it done for my car.
Chris fix is a talented person 😐🔥
Man! My 81' montecarlo got a problem, when slowing down (even if I don't press de brakes) a weird sound comes out and it's driving me crazy. It sounds as a bus braking
This is just what I need for my triton mk (l200) turns like a logging truck. Hopefully I can go the cheap route
Can you do a face reveal?
Needs spacers in the rear too
i would really love to see some diesel videos and I'm sure a lot more people would watch your videos too.
ChrisFix How can I troubleshoot and fix a whining noise coming from my engine only when the AC is running. The whining pitch increases higher as the rpm increases. For some background, I was driving and switched my AC to full blast. When I did that, something happened and zero air was blowing. For awhile, the “High” AC setting would not work. It works now tho but the noise persists. Any comment (or video) would be much appreciated!! Thanks!!
How would find, and fix a engine coolant leak?
Could you please make a video about how to convert a lock that requires a key (Not a remote thingy) to a lock that can be unlocked by a remote.
Still wondering how the hell he got that overhead shot
Clever mods Chris! This is the least money you can spend to increase the turning radius of your car. Drifters must love this mods! Very useful
Also, most importantly. Where did you get the angle kit?
Hey @ChrisFix, I'm curious why you didn't add spacers to the rear wheels as well.
you need spacers on the rears because you have a unbalanced wheel spacing. also you don't need to torque the nuts on the tires, you get them tight with the factory included tire iron and your foot
Hi! what kind of gloves do you wear? Thancks.
I love this guy..
Awesome as Always Chris. Hope all is well.
Or you can make tighter turns by drifting.  Interesting though, I never knew about rack limiters.  Need to check for clearance with the suspension loaded though.
Who else think he should put some new rims on this or a big wing
You can see his Face --------> --https://youtu.be/_Lp2uRvHB10-- <---------
cant wait for new vid wondor if i can this to my 94 cougar with same motor as ur stang?
Chris fixes videos are just fun to watch even if you don't use what he is showing you
does a 2008 charger rt have these?
Just woundering, Is it possible to have something to seperate the drivers from the passangers? it's aimed for uber and lyft drivers for their safety.
hey chris when are you going to start back up the drifting
For a future video would you ever show how to disassemble a truck? Because I’m getting this project truck and I don’t know how to to take stuff off a truck and change it. Like I’m getting everything from my local salvage yard body part wise. Like I don’t know how to remove a bed or tail gate or whatever.
Have you ever drove a 1998 Monte Carlo LS? And can you make a video on how to do a front end alignment?
Can you post more videos of you drifting at events
Count how many times Chris says the word easy.
Im going to modify the steering on my car so I can run from the police more efficiently!
When is the roll cage
Your Mustang just gets better and better all the time, Chris!   :-0      I just wish I could have seen your videos before I traded my OWN  in  (for a 350Z)  . . .   big mistake!   :-(         Thanks,   thumbs up, and wishing you continued success,   Norfolk Joe
Hey man really enjoy your videos!! I just recently watched the videos on fuel system treatments and I was wondering if you could by chance do the same Kinda videos but for diesels, specifically one called “Howes” it’s an anti gel and fuel system treatment! I have a 95 Dodge Cummins and it’s my baby, and that’s always the stuff that I have ran. And I’m curious as to if it actually does anything
i swear your editing keeps getting more insane (in a good way)
U should make a videos how to clean your interior
Y can u choose a car that is little round, ur car look rectangular.
Completely unrelated to the question, but when repairing curb rash on my chevy, it made the wheel shinier.  But now my plastic hub cap is discolored from the rest of the wheel... any suggestions?
What about for a FWD car? 🤔😔
That's really cool to use the drone above your cul-de-sac
After a while, please check those rubber boots to see if the increased movement isn't tending to pull them right off the steering rack...
Ok is no one else going to say anything about the front wheels turning by themselves at the beginning of the video? Or at least that's what it looks like O.o
There is a pressure limiter on the power steering /  steering rack...
This guy is upgrading his car in every video and also making money from it. You are really clever ChrisFix :P
Make video about more camber
Keep in mind that using wheel spacers to move the wheels outward changes the alignment, so you should have the front end re-aligned.  Spacers also increase the spindle and bearing loads,  and that can cause accelerated wear or failure of front end components.
Wouldn't the tire hit the sway bar when you are making a turn and hit a pothole, i.e the suspension gets compressed?
Just get a 8 steering wheel :D
Im sure my srt4 would have a horrid radius still
It looks like there was only 1/4 inch of clearance on the driver side. I'm curious if you checked it once it was off the stands and weight was applied to the tire if it started rubbing because of the sidewall flex.
When is the next drift vid tho..? Really exited to see his new specs on the road (Seats, S. Wheel, etc...)
Hey Chris. Have you thought about making videos related to sound systems. Speakers, amps and subwoofers etc? I know there is a fair bit of videos  on youtube . But i would love too see your take on it. Since you make such quality videos, which are easy to understand and follow. And some people might not know a 100% how to do it properly. Just a thought, would be cool to see!
Your videos are great I'm building my 03 for drifting and your hitting a lot of the key things I'm trying to find more info about.  Keep it up
not supposed to grease between rotor and wheel otherwise it doesnt sit flush lmao rookie mistake
Chris your videos are so well made. You should have your own TV show. Your wordings are simple and clear for anyone to understand!  Your camera shooting probably doesn't get the credit it deserves while performing the work including other computer compiling of the 2 car turning ratio.  Just crazy good!!\n\nI've been meaning to add a vice grip to my tool collection without having a work table so would you be kindly enough to link description of where you got yours?  It didn't look like it was mounted onto your tool box??\n\nBy the way just did my first ever rotor and brake job thanks to your other video!  Save me money to buy more tools and will be doing my other car as well. 🍻
You could've kept the restrictors or collars as you now have the angle kit and you would probably get the same of if not more angle with the kit. Because you wouldn't have to worry about the power steering motor from making noises
Cool and all, but under load you are probably going to scrape when moving. \n\nLateral forces applied to the suspension change camber, toe, and caster.
Wtf is a K-turn? Chris I think you mean a three point turn
Hey can I use rubbing alcohol to remove the stickiness left over by the tint and stickers
Chris you're a COOL CAT!
3 point turn not a k turn whatever that is.
Dude, you need to tell people to use the handbrake (e-brake) too if they're jacking the car up.   Don't want the brick sliding back and have the car come down on you ...
You should do a video on how to change automatic to stick shift cars @ChrisFix
you live in New York don't you
Apparently, this mod turned to be awesome
Hi chris! \n\n I'm sending this in regards of My car which I need Help with. I've got a Volvo s40 2002 1.6, and i changed My Vvt a day Ago but there's still this knocking sound. I changed the engine oil and filter aswell. The workshop guys changed all of it and they told me there's nothing wrong with the car. Another workshop told me i need to drive the car more with the oil change(engine) because it hasnt been driven alot because it was owned by Two elder seniors which barely drove it. Should i trust the workshops advice and try driving it more because they changed 2 vvts and they Said theres nothing wrong, Help me please? Is it safe to drive the car, because I've been driving it to work lately and it works properly, but there's this noise sound only. Thank you in advance:)!  \n\nBest regards Dominique! :)
What type of shifting contraption does this guy have inside his mustang?
Wheel spacers are a TERRIBLE idea.\n\nJust ask an engineer.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/hWijfooeSyU
I like how easy it is for you to access your steering rack... so much room down there.... wish I had that kind of clearance.
hid upgrade
Please post more vids
You remind me of my grandfather. He remodeled an engine back in the 70's. I wish you had a car you could do it with.
I'm about to do this right now to my sn95 lol
Do a video to show people how to change their tires
Hey Chrisfix do you think you can make a video on fixing a trucks frame because it is bent? My trucks frame is bent and I don't know how to fix it.
When your favourite YouTube channel surprise you with great & awesome video editing 😍
Dear Chrisfix, my name is as well Chris but I have one question, how can you make a 4WD car into 2wD even though the car is illegal in the US which I want to legalize a Nissan Skyline GTR 2002 R34 which I want to buy one later but make it fit the legal standards for the US environmental protection and Driving Safety?
Chris I seriously think you should do a quick disconnect steering wheel for easier in and out movement for your body
I can see you improved your video editing techniques! kudos dude!
Anything more redneck than the PVC tubing would be to 3d print them ! Love your vids Chris keep up the great work :D
Hey Chris great videos bro hope you can visit us here in Florida to drift with us we have a really nice area to drift good luck and keep it up thumbs up for you bro
Cold air intake video ! Please !
Hey Chris! U r the best. I like u. Thanks for video.
You should show how to install a spoiler
Where do you find bolt torque specs for your vehicle
Can someone timestamp me the comped/taco bell/sushi meme part? also, a quick rundown?
At 11:17 he recommends a fusion restaurant lol...
*C O M P E D*
Maybe the gunman had an angry agenda against the casino and wanted revenge. Sounds like the most likely motive.
This guy is funny. I like him
This is not about YOU!!! BROTHER! are you for real??? what's the matter with you?
It might have been political reasons.
Not one word about the victims
Another peaceful Bernie Sanders supporter strikes again. \nCommunists bring love right?
Leave this guy alone  . Leave him alone . This is why people go crazy in the first place .
This is true emotion .. God Bless you
He is struggling with there is no way he did this and Well, that does sound like him... and  of course he would be able to pull it off.\nHe doesn't understand why he would do it and is thinking out loud. He's being protective and also trying to be sympathetic to the victims. He is also saying I'm a good family man, I wouldn't do anything like what he did.
Anyone else find it fishy he stresses steve 100% did it by himself? @6:00
He slips up in present tense by saying he is, he does, he knows. And then quickly fixes it by saying it in past tense
7:25 coke falls out and he sniffs it back up?
14:50 Steve was an arms dealer?
For someone who talks about achieving so much wealth, he does not appear to live that sort of lifestyle (average house with a cheap car in the drive).  His hubris masks layers of truth that will eventually surface.
Only the truth will set you free. Research people
I AM GETTING SICK \nTO MY STOMACH CONSTANTLY SEEING THIS MASS MURDERERS TWIN BROTHER ALL OVER THE NEWS....😞
Strange guy
Steve and his brother have a Good coca connection 😂😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
He's either hiding something or just in shock.
Your moment in the sun after 30 years of failed Richard Dreyfuss impersonations.
We don’t condemn Steve for gambling! We condemn him for killing 58 people & wounding hundreds! This Brother just made a fool out of himself!!
Omg this is so weird, so strange.
This fagget loved this.. he loved all this media attention.. and his rich driving a Chevy??? 😂😂😂
this guys a idiot. he talks about his brother like he was a smart great person
I love the sudden work-shirt down to earth type of wear.  I thought he was retired?
The girlfriend probably knows something.
No one thinks he is a evil genius \nWe think he's a psychopath
This guy shouldn’t be talking to the press.
I want this guy dead w his brother.
25:47 the bug in men in black put on a Steve and did this.
It seems (((they))) are losing touch with reality now.\n\nI mean, look at this whole thing, it's ridiculous.
This guy will probably gets death threats if he hasn't already. This guy just keeps on saying my brother made my mother wealthy. Did he give any thing at all to the victims families or those who survived this mess.
Look, everyone can notice that he's just a tad weird, I get that, but everyone is saying about how he's so awkward and hiding stuff. The dude is out here being expected to answer for his brothers wrongdoings DIRECTLY to the press and still trying to process this in his personal life himself. Give the dude some leeway.
This is the old man version of Tweak from South Park.
Oh my address is 1332 it has 32 and 33 does that make me a Mason Lol
Even a 5 year old will know that this guy is hiding something and has something to do with it, he's trying so hard to hide it
Something seems off about the brother 🤔. Weird
Chris Elliott is a great actor!!
He's so right when he says about how does it make him weird because he didn't have a Facebook and post so many photos of himself, so true.
Talking and talking but saying nothing....
I think he is so baffled and is in utter shock, that's why he was all over the place in the interview. He was trying to explain the Steve he knew, and cannot understand why he would do this. Imagine being in his shoes and how you would react, you wouldn't know how you would react or handle all of this.
This is what happens when you do a lot of ice (meth)
weirdest experience ever recorded in whole life of all of the america
The guy reminds me of the Woogie in the movie Something About Mary.
rhows your mom doin? oh shes great, finding out her son just killed people and finished himself after, shes never been better
Who is retired and wears a Mechanic uniform
He going to be the next killer
Im not saying he had to do anything with the shooting. But his demeanor is just wierd. I cant stand his tone
somehow i just can't believe this nice guy who was private just up and did this.  something they're not telling us i think.
What was the restaurant he was trying to recommend !?!? Thats the real question.
He slips up at 27:25 And admits his brother wasnt the perp. Thats why he is talking there is prolly a gun in his back somehow. This gets fishier and fishier.
Thus guy just has no answers for the media or anybody and asking him for them would be like asking me why his brother did this. He knows someone that he never thought would do something like this. And sometimes there is just no answer for why somebody does what they do. Just leave him alone.
looks like if he has an earpiece on his ear and at 14:48 it souds like if he was going to say He was an arm dealer he lies alot looks like hes lieing for me
Look, I'm not into all of that conspiracy theory stuff, but why do I feel like something is soo off during this interview, like this is a hidden camera/reality show that's just been scripted? Idk why, but I'm just, idk, something seems weird.
This guy knows everything he just acts liks he doesnt... Plus i believe their was alot of other ppl planned on this massacre. His brother didnt shoot all those ppl with no motive, there was something wrong with that guy plus.. What if he threatened the casino to bomb it if he wouldnt let him do his Mission I heard paddock was crazy...
This guy is an annoying douchbag.
show us camera footage of the hotel
The same people (the jews), that set up 9/11 and killed 3000 of their own people set this up. They are satans children and responsible for all the wars in the world. Wake up American sheeple, your government isnt run by white Christians.
He knows alot for somebody who supposedly knows nothing
It seems like to me some mobster or cia or someone did this to collect insurance money, and they kidnapped this mr. paddock and then just killed him in the room to pin it on him. That could be a possibility.
Weird. The reason people are going off about his brother is in REALITY he is a mass murderer.  Clearly this guy is in denial of his true person.
I think people would want to do more to his grave than just spit on it
He doesn't make sense .... We get it he was rich lol
Is there a medical record or an autopsy of Steve Paddock? Maybe he had that terminal cancer, didn't want to die alone and wanted to take as many innocent lifes. He was a total rich psycho gambler.
Would somebody please eradicate this entire family line, WOW
Masking up the sushi for thousands of dollars .... those could have been illegal purchases of something else
Somethings wrong with these people....
Give me a Pennie every time he says “the Steve I know” and I’ll be rich
29:20 and on is very suspicious this guy knows something
No one talks like this.  This guy is insane.  Im guessing insanity either ruins in their family or this guys a good, well paid, underrated actor.
Ok it's time to lay off of the Starbucks!
stephen paddock was a good man. he was just troubled.
He finds it almost inconceivable that his brother would do this and yet he's absolutely sure he did it all on his own.... Like what?....
This guy is getting paid by someone or brain washed to say these things.
The casino lost to much money.. the mafia set him up.
Money, sushi, money, gambling, sushi...more money....NOTHING ABOUT THE 58 DEAD!!!! ARREST HIM...ARREST HIM...HE KNOWS MORE THAN HE SAYING!!!!!!
Weird..
Wookie from Something About Mary... LOLOLOL!
Diarrhea of the mouth.
mk ultra is a helluva drug
Fruitcake😡
We ate thousands of dollars of 🍣 sushi lol
29:11
rich guy got terminal illness.
Phony
Party Favor @ 7:25
Crazy white people!
This guy acting weird
What the???
This is crazy
Strange and more strange
Sounds like a cool dude
Sooooo bizzarre..
Stupid
Both brothers are such a hottie!
14:50 he was an ar__ , likely meant to say armed after previously saying he wasnt a gun guy.
This guy is liar! They really need to get to the bottom of this.I get it this man an actor. I wonder what he gets out of this.
Sorry its not in spanish for you spanish speaking people.
Estoy 100% seguro  q el comentarista es chileno
ya llegaron los chilependientes, perucas de mierda
I think Chile can make it to at least the semi finals in the world cup.
Me da gracia, hay mas perucas que propios Chilenos, como siempre pendiente de su padre.
Que buen relator este chileno jaja broma, saludos de Paraguay, muy buen partido.
soy peruano y trabajo en Chile hace cuatro años ...quiero a mi pais y quiero ver a la roja en el mundial ...viva chile carajo !
jejejjeje ese es mi chile el bicampeon del mundo
Me pareció bueno que Chile gane. Pero ni Ecuador  ni Chile recuperan su nivel.\nMe pareció un poco pobre el partido.
Las clasificatorias sudamericanas sin duda las mejores del planeta.
Chile great team... we wanna see it in Rusia!
Chile gano sufriendo , gracias a ese defensa bruto de Ecuador q se resbalo😡😡, y colombia estaba celebrando y burlándose de otros y ahora esta en riesgo lol, estas eliminatorias sudamericanas ya nadie es local , cualquier cosa puede pasar en cualquier minuto , solo se respira cuando el arbitro diga Fin
Go Chile, from England!
Jajaja Brasil los va hacer mierda!!!
que me hacen reir los chilependientes
Alexis Sanchez is there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jajaaj Chileindios ahora a perder contra Brasil jajaja!!
espero que chile no juegue sucio  porque ya lo hicieron antes en BRASIL https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maracanazo_de_la_selecci%C3%B3n_chilena\n\nЯ надеюсь, что чили не играют грязной, потому что они уже делали это раньше в БРАЗИЛИИ
Ese ecuatoriano quería cancherear jajajajaja GOL CTM
GO GO Chile!!
Q maricones los chilenos así noma meten gol
3 cupos para 5 equipos,esta claro que CHILE es el que la tiene mas dificil ya que jugamos con brasil,paraguay es el que la tiene mas facil pero veremos muy pronto de que estamos echos,peruanos muy agrandados por que le empataron a argentina cuando le ganen 2 finales consecutivas hablamos...
Brasil Uruguay Perú Paraguay Argentina.Despúes no digan que no avise.Chi chi chi le le le lo mira por la tele!!! Por las dudas soy uruguayo.
K lastima k no hay carteles en ecuador
Chileno que no le gusta la pinga no es chileno :V
El 2do gol de Chile : Cerca a su área, un defensa ecuatoriano está en posesión del balón, un delantero chileno lo empuja, hace caer al defensa, el árbitro no cobra infracción, y se generó el gol chileno
todos aca me chupan el pene especialmente messi jajajajaj
Hasta paraguay les gana
Argentina y Chile quedaran fuera. Firmalo.
Fixed match
Chileno hijo de puta raz asquerosa
spasibo loco
estaban sufriendo
Tmr xk melas te vendiste Ecuador joder
Volvió esa mierda de valdivia, bueno en fin la mayoría son una mierda: jara, arturo, medel, etc
Vamos Paraguay carajo!!
SI NO QUIEREN QUE TANTO NOS OCUPEMOS DE USTEDES, PORQUERÍAS, SIMPLEMENTE NO TROLEEN NI COMENTEN HUEVADAS EN VIDEOS PERUANOS, NO PIDAN DEMASIADO, PORQUE IGUAL VAMOS A SEGUIR JODIENDOLES MIENTRAS NOS SIGA DANDO LA PUTA GANA, VAMOS PERÚ CARAJO, EL CAMINO A RUSIA TOTALMENTE DESPEJADO, CARAJO!!!!
es gracioso ver a peruano chilenos y ecuatorianos llamando se monos entre sí \na jajajaja todos son monos!!
Chilenos el martes lleven su bacelina q brasil se las va a meter doblada rotos hijos de perras :) ! Peru y argentina en el mundial fuera chilenos indios :)
error del back ecuatoriano
Esperaba mas de esa seleccion pero la victoria que han tenido contra ecuador,no fue tan merecido,ya que sus dos goles fueeron regaladas por los defensas ecuatorianas .....veremos con brazil ahora!!!
Pobre Chile, Brasil lo va a violar en casa
cholo, deja de estar pendiente de tu padre, entro a ver los goles de Chile y solo veo a cholos picotas comentando
Les regalaron el partido a los chilenos.
uds creen que brasil les regalara algo o se dejara ganar o empatar , brasil se perfila como primera potencia futbolistica y quiere recuperar eso . mucho menos quiere cerrar con derrota en su propia casa que ingenuos. ya fueron chilenos.
Es increíble como los peruanos culiaos andan mas preocupados de Chile que de su mierda de selección jajajaj
TODO ESTAMIS IGUALADOS POR UN PUNTO CADA UNO EL MARTES SE JUEGA SU FINAL ASI DE SIMPLE. AQUI YA NO ESTAN LAS MATEMATIKAS ETC.. EL MARTES ES UN PARTIDO PARA CADA SELECCION SU PASE ALA FINAL..
Por la culpa de quinteros no pasamos al mundial:( pero ahora ay que pensar en catar
ROTOS Y LA REPUTA QUE LOS PARIO...
SOLO EL CHILENO EN EL SEGUNDO GOL NO LO MARCÓ NADIE Y SEGUNDOS ANTES OTRO CHILENO HABÍA HECHO FALTA
Waa genial ver como muestran estos partidos en Europa y en Rusia en especial
ECUADOR 1  - CHILINDIOS MARICAS LAMEHUEVOS  DE LOS INGLESES   2
se viene un partido difisil que es brasil
3:15 que emocionante el relato😭😭 claramente lo dise hdjndidjdjdbĢuiűű§😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello Neymar tengo lubricante para el martes
Que asco con ecuador como regala ese segundo gol así , se nota que querían favorecer a los rotos por que Perú los dejó fuera del mundial
4:05 \n*voz de Homero*\nEs que es mi primer dia!
Me gusta como otros paises le tienen miedo a chile y ven los videos y todo, siempre atentos a los superiores
estos peruanos que llegan solitos a humillarse, les gusta decir que Brazil nos va hacer mierda, les gusta escuchar eso por que su selección nunca lo hará xDd
NADA MAS CON ESTOS TRAIDORES DE ECUADOR!!
Es tan malo ese gueon de bravo
Ke inocentes estos de ecu! No te pueden meter 2 goles robandole la pelota al defensor!!
una cancha que parece un patatal pero no es culpa de la gran seleccion chilena, es el Estadio Nacional y sus putos conciertos de Guns n Roses y Def Leppard, una pesima pesima organizacion.  Coordinacion mediocre.
El arquero se entregó en el primer gol
chicos pasen por mi canal, tengo videos interesantes que les pueden servir como bajar sin límites por mega, hackear wifi , juegos y otros trucos y programas , saludos
increible como lo perdio ecuador,estamos meados por un dinosaurio
puta que son feo los chilenos weon, la cagó XD
Ecuador se puede ir con la frente muy en alto si elimina a Argentina del mundial.Sera recordado por los Argentinos eternamente.
Ahora con Brasil moriremos peleando hasta el final. Muy buena eliminatoria.
rotitos por los ingleses para
Puta madre! Renovaron Ecuador completamente y si mejoro el ataque pero la defensa de antes se tiene que quedar. Necesitamos Ayovi, Erazo, Mina, y Ramírez. A chillier también está bueno en Mexico
POR FAVOR UN EMPATE EN BRASIL Y DESPUÉS QUE SE VALLA pizzi Y LLEGUE PELLEGRINI
tanta gente insultando a los países vecinos y creyéndose el cuento de que pueden “predecir” de que uno le ganará al otro...en serio digo , no se pueden calentar por un juego...que inmadurez más impresionante , pero bueno , de mal en peor van todos . Que gane el equipo que mejor juegue , ya fue .
Brasil en tus manos encomendamos nuestros espíritus(Colombia,Peru,Argentina,Paraguay)
Jajaja lo bueno q Brasil de local no a perdido ni cagando perderá con los chiliindios.\nVa mejorando el idioma chiliindio entendi al comentarista cuando dijo ecuatoria jajaja
Buen partido, saludos de Perú
vidal hijo de puta sige diciendo que por culpa de los que juegan en mexico la seleccion esta mal por eso vargas t mando a callar!! pendejo
Super Duper Bonus TurnOver Bulanan hingga 60juta lebih  hanya di JPS POKER
Brasil le ganarà, y Paraguay ganarà a Venezuela, adiós chilindios juar juar
Like si crees que este partido estaba actuado como juegan los ecuaterianos....???? este partido está comprado por chile...observen a los de ecuador cuando chile tiene la pelota..
en el segundo gol de Chile fue falta, empujo al defensa.
Dicen que Chile perdera ante Brasil, nunca hablen despues de tiempo. O quedaran como Argentina, decian que les iban a ganar a Chile 3, 4 a 0 a Chile en la Copa America 2015 y 2016 y que paso? Nunca subestimen a NADIE
Chilenos hijos de puta
Difícil estas eliminatorias, esto se putio porq ganó Paraguay, chilenos diciendo q ya clasificaron. Acaso no ven que se van a enfrentar a Brasil, selección que jamás a perdido en eliminatorias  y que está hecho una máquina para jugar al fútbol? Argentinos, ir a ganar en la altura de Ecuador? Colombianos y peruanos que partido más duro, y paraguayos, acaso no han visto los últimos tres partidos de Venezuela? Esto está jodido
Mala suerte para los chilenos😡😡😡xd
Pinches chilenos roban siempre cabranes los partidos pero brasil los hara mierda
CHILENO MAL PARIDO HIJO DE PERRA FEOS HDP NO IRAN AO MUNDIAL BRASIL LES METERA PINGA CON SALIVA BRASIL 6 CHILE GAY 0
SOY CHILENO ME ENCANTA EL PERRO AL HORNO Y LOS BRASILEÑOS NOS VAN A DAR UNA MANO POR QUE NO LES GUSTAN LOS ARGENTINOS  PERO NADIE  ME  QUIERE SOLO POR QUE ME ADUEÑO DE SUS COMIDAS Y SUS TRAGOS  OJO COMPRO ARBITROS Y DIGO QUE SOY EL CAMPEON DE AMERICA
si le hubiesemos ganado a paraguay de local o ha bolivia de visita estariamos clasificados.😑
Que se siente que ningún país de tu continente te quiera ... Afuera chile
Que sospechoso ese segundo gol
si ganamos en brasil   meo en todas la banderas de america puta , si perdemos cago en las misma puta
Espero que el pueblo chileno se haya dado cuenta que este partido fue comprado... basta con ver el error del defensor ecuatoriano seguido de la marca del resto de los defensores ecuatorianos que se quedaron mirando al linea pidiendo offside
su primer gol de chile acepto pero el segundo no no saben jugar pasaron no se lo llevaron mierda maricones asieron trampa con uruguayo
si a Perú también le regalaron tres puntos
Juegan con el arbitro a su favor, así cualquiera gana :v
Buena come perros.
235 COMEPERROS LES GUSTA ESTO :V
vengo del futuro  PERU clasifica directo al mundial , argentina  clasifica  en cuarto lugar  y paraguay  en quinto lugar se va al repechaje .
incredible el error del defensa de Ecuador que se cae solo y le quitan el balon y de ahi cae el Segundo gol..
Ellen: Which one do you want\nOprah: this one is too big \nOprah: and this one is too small\nEllen: 😂😂😂\nMe: Dammn Oprah she has a specific size 🤣😂
So Ellen is being funny when she makes Oprah look like a clown using melons to degrade her, but that's funny! Smh! But then Cam makes an unintentional statement that was deemed offensive too many women, but no woman is offended by Ellen's behavior! Typical! As long as women do things to each other it's ok like constantly referring to each other as the B-word! I'm appalled by the hypocrisy. Using a cucumber to make fun about a male size and how to use it! All of this is so-called cute when they do it! So pathetic! Then Ellen using a mic to embarrass and degrade Oprah making it appear fun. This is so offensive, and not funny at all.
I wish I could say the last time I went to a grocery store was years ago 🙄
What gets me, is all those people holding up their phones. Obviously there is a camera crew and it will be on youtube, ellentube, and national TV.  They'd already have a video copy.  Take  a picture or 2 and then put your damn phone down and enjoy their little show there!   And now all you people have phones covering your faces, so no one can see you were there now anyways!
OPRAH'S DANDRUFF SHAMPOO
Look at Ellen firiend at 16.00 or 06.00
Did they not know tiffany?
I love Oprah but she is trying too hard to beat Mitchell Obama hang out with Ellen coz that was absolutely amazing
*Brings a big bag*\n\n*gets food*\n\n*puts the groceries in the bag without paying the money*\n\n😂👌🏼
Oprah hair is so pretty!!  I mean gorgeous Even!!
Omg so funny you are both God bless our souls
This was posted on my birthday!!
They are so funny together
Oprah is so out of touch. Its a product of circumstance I suppose - she used to be so relatable .
Ellen is so crazy😭 no doubt.
Ellen and Jake Paul are are honestly the craziest people when it comes to Stores and shoppin😂😂
I love Ellen and Oprah.
Notice Andy in the background at 03:15 when Ellen scares Oprah and he is like scared FOR Oprah HAHAHAHA
maaan i just wish i meet Oprah and Ellen before i die
Hmm Ellen isn't funny in this clip, she's just annoying.
who are these people?  youtube u r drunk (again)
Only Ellen can make Oprah do that. Lolz
Economic taxpayer second body extremely kiss sport Asian hot in.
I couldn't stop laughing Ellen is hilarious & that lady & her daughter are so lucky to have gone home with Ellen & Oprah
Got an add with Ellen in it.
This was too funny!!
Is it weird that i ship them
I love both but for some reason, I found them a bit obnoxious in this video...
i dont think i could handle so much fail in one store
Ok, so a bull and a dyke walk into a china shop...
Was Ellen named Ellen? Or, was she named Hellen and decided to drop the r?
When that kid just stared at Oprah when Oprah said just drink it
Lol, 3:55, the lady covered her daughter's eyes 😂😂
This guy is rich
This is going to be the inspiration for my next video. Crazy
I feel like these grocery store videos are just Ellen and her friends showing off how rich and entitled they are.
d most powerful people in d world oh God
When they were holding up the magazine of Ellen the mom in background was covering her daughters eyes
0:50 is me shopping with my nan 😂
I almost died of laughs!!! Awesome clip.
way faint economist laser stop other thought whatever lack space bend.
Even the store workers are filming. hahaha
Oprah and Ellen should make a tv show together
Peaches everyone. Oprah's touched the them! So true Ellen
Are they both drunk? 😂😂😂 it looks so fun!!!
WTF! How old are these people? This would be something we did in HIGH SCHOOL! Time to grow up people. These two should be laughing and carrying on with their GRAND CHILDREN for Christ's sake. Dispicable 🖕
Ellen seems so fun to hang out with!
Oprah' s product placement ruined this a little for me. 😕😒
It’s never too big.
Omfg the lady with the brussel sprout is MY ENGLISH TEACHER AHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Who's Oprah and Ellen?
That looked like a lot of fun shopping with you two. thanks for sharing.
Ellen is so childish and I love that 😂😂😂
I wonder if the Ellen show could help me find my biological family I was adopted at birth and I always wanted to meet my real mother
That guy gave the whisky to his kid XD
the guy tried to give his son the vodka lol
i love Elen and Opra they're funny as hell
Look at us we are so rich from interviewing trailer trash that we make fun of people who have to actually shop heee haaa heee haaa
I just love this kind of laughter and friendship if the world functioned at this level on a regular basis this would be a better world. Keep laughing Oprah and Ellen two great women I love u and I'm praying for u too God bless  D. Pitts
*Ellen and Oprah get into a random person's car to go to their house* \n\n\n\n\ncasual
Commercial excuse matter recover those fitness article together initially numerous.
What a nuisance x2. Would leave the store right away if these two walked in.
Ellen is so funny 🤣👌🏿👌🏿 Just love them both🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿👑👑👑💰💰💰
Are people really that privileged that they don't even go to grocery stores?!?!
Oprah has her own food? well I know what my next diet will include.... love these ladies
How come the screen is black for me?
“You have 2 kids you might need that.” *passes the bottle of liquor* 😂😂😂
Stephanie is the luckiest person at any grocery store ever
Do you know how much money is in that store right now,
The sad part is that you know those peaches all got bought that day!
I love those ladies 😊
What brain dead considers this entertainment ?? A racist and a dyke shopping...REALLY !! I guess this caters to the TV crowd or clueless libtards . When is Oprah going to do a special on the Blacks who owned slaves in the NORTH after slavery was abolished ??....crickets
How did I even get here I don't even WATCH this channel!
😂😂😂😂they look like they had fun
I would love to go shopping with Ellen
When was the last time you were in a grocery store? I cant imagine what life is like for celebs, what do they do off camera...that said, these 2 are hilarious together
I love Ellen. She is so funny!
opera looks so good
Ellen is hilarious 😂😂😂
two queens
Such children.
OMG! oprah's got such big melons! 😂
So funny
Josh is quaking
Garbage
My bestfriend goals
I bet after this people starting raiding the peaches when they saw this
The dilemma of finding the right sized cucumber.... 😏😏😏🤣🤣🤣
someone has to compile all of Oprah's scream in this episode
She pays in bars of gold
That was hilarious!!🤣👍🏾👍🏾
I could use some groceries.

Movie so white i need my sunglasses
Sorry Woody, im not gonna follow on this... i miss Woody Allen acting, i like the neurotic Woody, not this.
I will sit with some of those authentic people (now much older) and really enjoy this one very personally!!!
Watch it because of Paulie Walnuts and Bobby Bacala, also Belushi as semi Tony Soprano.
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It's written and directed by Woody Allen an alleged molester who married his stepdaughter. He is disgusting and I strongly advise you refrain from giving him money. The fact Amazon is parading around his name in the trailer is just wrong. Just don't.
Love me some Juno Temple. I dig that she’s recently been doing period pieces.
Somebody was watching The Toy just recently, lol.
hmm.. we at #woodyallenretro are somewhat skeptical but are keeping a open mind... has potential

Am I the only one who gets “A Streetcar named Desire” vibes?
Early word is positive for this movie
I'm just passing by, and when I sell my movie script I'll be back here thanking you guys
So many movies with the word Wonder this year.
Sub to my channel I'll subbed to you comment when done.
Anyone know the swingy song that plays at like 0:09? Lol.
I shall be a getting a subscription this month or whenever the release date is confirmed.
This looks like a play.
Who else thought the title said wonder woman?
2017 (Year of Wonder):\nWonder Woman\nProfessor Marston and the Wonder Woman\nWonder Wheel\nWonder
This looks like it could be a lot of fun
well great now I've got wonderwall stuck in my head
Any way, here's Wonder Wheel
“Miss, you can’t be out here. We’re expecting lighting storms.” \n\n*proceeds to place a fucking makeshift lightning rod over her head*\n\n00:30
This has a soap-opera feel to it.  Hopefully that's just the trailer.

Is this a Wes Anderson movie
I watched it without sound, because I'm at work. Can anyone tell me what the plot is, haha.
Awesome! The long awaited sequel to the Toy. Can't wait!!!
This feels like an SNL skit.  Not sure if that’s promising or damning.
This looks like a bad one.
Hey there my friend, I am Skylar Fuhrmeister and I make lifestyle, beauty, fashion and more here on Youtube and would love if you would watch my recent video all about halloween https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkAQcAE0060 maybe more!
I dont trust any Woody Allen movie unless there is underage incest.  I feel he is too much out of his wheelhouse.
Woody Allen and Kate Winslet take Oscar together
What is this? This is not Oasis? Alert me when you have decided to make it. Thanks
JT rules here\ncannot wait for his collab with Alison Sudol (both are great when it comes to singing and acting)

Yes Kate, but replace Justin with Leo.
1:19 is that a wand ?
You still got it woody Allen as sad Amazon studios is making more original stuff than Hollywood studios out there.
I would only see it if Woody Allen was crucified on the Wonder Wheel.
Visually nice but doesn’t seem all that great of a story to me.
Woody Allen and Bill Cosby are two men cut from the same cloth. Despicable creatures who should not be allowed to work
No Justin Noooo why'd you work with this creep? 🤦🏼‍♀️
Why the dislikes?

I am in Afghanistan so I haven't been watching a lot of YouTube but I am so excited for when I get back for all these goodies on sid and dina's channels!!
we love you dina! you got this ❤️
Please just do what makes you happy and feel comfortable. I have anxiety too and it’s really hard sometimes and I miss out on opportunities. Your happiness is all that matters. We love you ❤️
Don’t beat yourself up. May Allah helping you find the best balance. I think you’re making the right decisions.
Dina, isn't Mona Hayward (?) the best of the best!
What happened to the paiamas haul??
Wow ur so honest ...
This is 100% relatable.
Love you Dina!!\nPleaseeeee show some love on my channel to anyone reading this!!\nI have a Kylie Cosmetics giveaway!! xx
Love your long coat at Instagram!
Dina, elhamdililah for making the right choices.
I understand the anxiety. InshAllah we all develop more confidence. we are all works in progress xxx
Sid coming at the end hahahahaha
Aa fuck that Dina, fashion week is so boring anyways
Do not feel bad! Mom guilt is normal, but never feel bad about wanting to be with your baby. Enjoy it when you can and when your not enjoy your you time. Knowing your limit and keeping balance is life... were all trying to keep it in check. Your a good mom & blogger!! You got best of both worlds. 😍
Love that you and Sid has black hoodies on. In time for the All black game. :)
Dina I never knew you had anxiety... Thank you for being so open ... I def get the mummy guilt I am the same with events especially with several in a week. Hey you can always go with me.... Just saying 💛
This time with your girl will go make the most of it
You do you and do what makes you happy. You don’t have to follow the crowd and your content is good enough as it is. I love you vlogs that involves your family rather than events and stuff.
feel like there is sth different in ur face. maybe the teeth 😒
Kids grow up so quick, so being with them while they are still little and still think you are the best person in world is more important, then suddenly before you blink, they are know it everything teenagers with stacks of attitude.\nAlthough mom guilt is normal, don't feel ever feel bad about putting your family first. :)
Sid is so funny especially when he pops in at the end of your videos also great video thanks for sharing peace
You made some great decisions. You do you boo!
Your teeth does age u a bit but still beautiful
#BlackHoodGang ! Hit me up :)
I know exactly how you feel. Anxiety can be a bitch but who doesn't love being comfortable
i like ur language dina
not to take away from the message of the video, but I love your brows dark!
Thank you for this video. It just shows how real you are, how everyone is fighting their own battles and that no one has it easy. I hope you achieve even greater success in life inshaAllah. Hopefully things will get easier once Hanna grows older. And who knows, she can be your ultimate company to these events :)
Thanks for being so genuine about your life to us your happiness matters the most
I understand. I struggle with high anxiety as well as depression, including some panic attacks
Respect for Dina! Putting family first! Trust me best thing to do once everything goes you'll always have ur family to rely on nd they will support you
Salam go check out my YouTube channel and enter my giveaway!!
I never really comment, but I really felt for you when I watched your video. I've got 4kiddies my eldest is 13 and youngest is 3, and mummguilt is something we all struggle with. At No matter what stage of life we are at. Just wanted to say Your doing an amazing job. Your great at what you do and it's a blessing to have a supportive husband and family around you. Whatever your doing is for your family as well. So take solace in that. Your videos are so genuine, nothing fake about what you do, which is why I love watching your Vlogs. You show the true side to you nothing made up with fairy dust over everything. Where everything is hunky dory in Lala land. Your show the good and bad (nothing too bad) and that's what life is. Do what your happy with. Regardless of what other people are doing. It doesn't matter. Good will come it's self. But it's only worth it as long as your happy xx sending love
I get it. I don't have a child so I don't have the mom guilt but I get the anxiety. It prevents me from doing so many of the things I really want to do. About the mom guilt I think it's really important to remember to sometimes put yourself first. I don't care what people say, you CAN have a career AND a loving family - especially when you have a husband that supports you. So good luck :) and hopefully one day our anxiety wont stop us from doing what we love.
Plz remove ur vineers they dont look good on u, u have good teeth and r pretty the way u r
Can you tell us more about your anxiety & how you cope with it? A lot of Muslim people don’t know how to deal with it. :/
why are you and Sid in back hoodie alot my sweet? new looks?? I love it! ill call it the bank robber look!
Thumbs up to you. Time with your daughter and family is more important than money. You can always make money but can never get time back.
Love the fact that Dina is one of the most normal people ever!!  Love it!!!
Alsalamu Alakuim Allah bless you and protect you.  Love your makeup and turban and black sweater. I want to meet and be your friend so much and love you sister. Your soo cute 💎💎💎💎😘😘😘😘
dina, do you feel part of your anxiety comes from being a Muslim woman? I remember your bafta vlog where you talked about how you had been treated at the afterparty and another event which was supposed to honor ALL women but you and your mother were the only ones having issues getting into the event, tho you had the invite and your ID....I’m sorry if that’s part of the reason and people make you feel that way cause of your religion. I’m not Muslim but I am black, I get the being the only one in the room mentality.
nawww your a great mom tbh, and yes I feel like this when I dont spent time with my siblings/parents forget even the guilt of having a child. Dina your awesome, and hana is super lucky to have such a humble and warm mom like you. Love watching you
Good for you gal!! Do you!! If I could stay at home and spend more time with my little one, I sooo would. Maybe one day Insha'Allah...anyway stay happy and sane! 😊
Hi Dina it's very understandable. The opportunities are good but just do you. Hannah will grow up and you won't get the time back so it is ok for you to find a balance that works for you. Please do what you feel good doing and don't stress too much. Also so happy that you will be doing stuff with your sister so you won't be too lonely. ☺️
properly because this is not the right way maybe you don't know so I am just saying and any non muslims who don't know anything about Muslim I don't want any of your reply thanks 🙏🏼
R E A L T A L K ❤️
I think you're just an introvert and get naturally tired after extending yourself too much, there is nothing wrong with that
Absolutely love how brutally honest you are.
Where's the makeup tutorials
The fact that you feel guilty shows how much you care. Hana has such an amazing mother who thrives to make a better change in society. Well done and you deserve a break! We are all human 🌹
You see so many hijabi you tubers begging it to become famous now days so they jump to the opportunity for abit of lime light for this dunya. Dina on the other hand has always remained grounded and raw when it comes to YouTube that’s why no one will ever top her in this game. My fave Muslim YouTuber you are amazing at what you do & a great mom. 💕
Anxiety is a bitch isn’t it. Fair play though if you don’t enjoy them as much for whatever reason. Define your own success you’re doing amazing <3
Your makeup looks awesome, do you mind sharing what you're wearing (specifically foundation and lip stick)? Thanks :)
Your make up is stunning today
Dina your makeup looks flawless! Also, I'm gonna copy that outfit, one day, when i master the art of styling a turban.. one day..
Awe Dina,  I would go places with you if I didn't live all the way across the ocean! I too get mom guilt. We could sit around sulking and feeling guilty together!😁
Youre a good mum and wife, for now put your family first then you do your job, because you have flexible time to aranged, loved to see you doing that 😊😊😊
I know some people might say oh you don’t have to explain yourself, and you don’t, but I love how you keep it real. Even if it’s just these little tidbits of letting us in. You are someone I have looked up to and I also get bad anxiety. So I really appreciate when you put stuff like this out there. Makes me feel less alone, more normal. 💕
I love your videos! Thank you for sharing about mom guilt and anxiety. I feel the same way as a parent. I also felt this way when I was pregnant tge anxiety and more so exhaustion. Keep with awesome work!❤😊
Just follow your intuition and everything will always be ok 💜 I feel like you are more awake than many people. What you feel is real.

I blame feminism.... This shit got us working for the rest of our life!
Dina, Don’t mistake what uv been made to believe is ‘anxiety’ or ‘Mum guilt’ with what is in-fact u fighting against ur natural fitrah as a woman.\n The things u mentioned that u feel are because of the way Allah designed women to be. U will always revert back to ur natural fitrah no matter how much u try to fight it. Society has made a name for  these feelings and called them ‘anxiety’ so that u stop there and don’t look into deeper meanings as to why u feel the way u do. So u don’t look to religion and Allah for guidance. U just say I suffer with anxiety. In fact u don’t. It’s just an internal battle with ur innate feelings as woman to want to be at home with her family where Allah prescribed for is the best place. And to be modest and conservative in every way which is why u find these events so uncomfortable sometimes. \nUr not meant to find it comfortable to be around inappropriately dressed people, alcohol, music. So in fact what ur feeling is complete NORMAL and what isn’t normal is what ur doing and trying to convince urself is a problem with urself called anxiety. Don’t fight ur fitrah. What Allah designed u as. U will never find true happiness that way. Go with what Allah has prescribed for u and only then will u  taste the true sweetness of happiness. \n\nI’m not one to leave comments ever, but I saw this short clip and felt compelled to say something. I get how u feel coz I was in the same position few years ago. Feelings I couldn’t quite explain. An uncomfortable feeling being in certain places. It’s because it’s not what Allah has prescribed for us as women. \nAnd By the Way men face the same battles with ‘anxiety’ as they go against their natural fitrah too. By becoming less protective towards their women. Society has completely changed the roles to make it that men who accept their wives free mixing and dressing inappropriately are viewed as confident in themselves and those who find it uncomfortable for their women to be speaking to non mahrams as insecure men. But no. Men should feel a natural jealousy and protectiveness over their women. Be it their mother wife sister or daughter. When they fight that, they also have these ‘feelings’ that  they can’t explain and name them anxiety. They feel frustrated and can’t explain it. \n\nI hope this didn’t read too bluntly but that’s how text can be sometimes. Compared to actually speaking about stuff. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to help u with the way ur feeling. I know exactly what it feels like and I am now free of that. Alhumdulilah. TabarakAllah. Happiest Iv ever been. \n\nAs Muslims we’ve been given the gift of knowing what’s to come and if we truly claim this to be certainty then how can we justify the actions we knw r wrong to be ok.. what will u say to Allah when ur standing infront of him.. that’s the question that changed my life. What will I say to my creator..? What will be a good enough reason..? I wasn’t ready? I tried my best? Not good enough. \n\nHope U read this and it helps in some way  inshallah. At the moment Allah has kept some form of guilt in ur heart when u do something u knw isn’t right, don’t let that small portion be taken away from u. Act upon it before it’s taken away. It’s not too late. U have a daughter who will lead by ur example. True love means wanting jannah for those we love x
are your teeth different?
str8 paki
Don’t yell at me, but your teeth look way better now! I hated it at first but they’ve settled..... or is it better lippy? You look GORGEOUS ❤️,
dear sisster if u coverd your head and body beang a muslim so remember  that islam doesn't allow u to show your face to na mehrem people

I'm feeling pretty constipated
Oh no I clogged the toilet
i watch this while i'm pooping😱
Have you ever ate a cheeseburger while taking a dump?
I just dropped the kids off at he pool
Why...............
this video is very shitty
I feel disgusted 🤢 I wonder why and I watching wait what am I doing with my life 🤔 Ehh This is my opinion I'm not hating on this but Let's Just finish this video.
The videos require a lot of work, I'm surprised that the channel promises a 3 videos a week now!
I am watching this video as im pooping! XD!
What, who drinks 8 cups of water a day? 4 is fine unless you're working out. Or unless they count the water you take from food, than I would understand. But no needs to drink that much water a day.
Drop the kids off at the pool xD
Actually the Squat toilet is available and used in Iraq.
so you mean that girls poop too? D:\n\n\n\n\noh wait, they are also humans, my mum lied to me...
Perfect i am shiting right now
Why did I clicked on this video
I was going to make a joke but it’s kinda crappy.
Does anyone know what software they use to make the infographics?
Too much fun with the 30 second intro
Why am İ watching this?
That's definitely not average weight
Sorry to be “that guy”, but I think that last fact of how many litres over your lifetime is off by a factor of 1000. 51,000,000 litres divided by the number of days in 80 years (around 26,000) is still 2000 litres. I think you meant 2000 millilitres?
I honestly don't go in with my phone or newspaper when I go in the bathroom because it doesn't take long to come out. Why do people do this?
Please do  if NASA had a 1 trillion dollar budget 
I’ve always pooped once a day, always in the morning. But I took a biology class at my community college, and was totally shamed by everyone telling me they poop after every meal. (That’s why restaurants are required to have restrooms.)
Are you ALREADY running out of ideas?????
What a crappy video\n\n\n\nNot really only for a joke
Yo do a vid on North Korea vs China
lol i poop a day in a year
Militay comparison\nIndonesia and Malaysia
Australian people say dunny
Wow u make great content i really enjoy watching ur vids u earned a subscriber!
I poo about 5-7 times a day as i have ibs and ibd 💩👌
You've clearly​ never met a 100 lb girl who likes Chipotle 💩💣
Why is this in my recomended? And it is in the Entertainment Section ._.
Dahell? poop once a day? im more like once a week.
We had sit down toilets until 2012
The Infographics Show can u make a video of differences in American and European food... i  mean why US food is so trash packed with chemicals and EU food is better ? :)
Now we are asking real questions.
Think about it. In the future the kids will be even more depressed and stressed because they will have to learn more history. Because things that happen after we go to school....and they will have to study it.

Crap is a swear word in every English speaking country except America. Also, I don't where on earth you got your research from but we (The British) do not call that water gun thing toilet roll. We call toilet paper toilet roll, you literally had them in the same frame, they are the same thing.
How much do you maststbate in a lifetime

Even denzel gets that feminist bullshit
I knew Denzel's He Got Game 'fro would make a comeback!
Looks good terrible title
oh hollywood ugh
I love Dankzel. Finally! A movie against all this liberal agenda bullshit! And here I thought Hollywood was forcing a liberal agenda on us.
So this is why he gained all that weight.
I LOVE MYSELF
So this is the movie Ashton Sanders told Denzel on the red carpet of the Oscars that he was gonna do with him! Too bad Ashton had to drop out of the project :(
writer and director of NightCrawler, alright, i'll give it my attention.
Bout time this trailer dropped! Can't wait for this performance by Denzel.
Test it but not repeat ?
I know a guy who's a local pimp, can I report him to the cops for cash??
Another Oscar
Have to watch.
Denzel can play anything.Cant wait
#VamosSuscribete a mi canal  por favor plis

Definitely will be seeing this. November is shaping up to be a good month for movies.

Each one of us is greater than the worst thing we've ever done.
Sony Pictures Entertainment, you guys should team up with LEGO to make a LEGO GhostBusters movie for all of the long-time GhostBusters fans and all of The LEGO Movie fans out there and then make a irresistibly fun LEGO GhostBusters film franchise out of it and it'll be THE greatest film franchise Sony Pictures Entertainment has ever made in recent memory. The long-time GhostBusters fans will even say it's right up with the hit TV show, The Real GhostBusters, itself on so many possible levels. #LEGOGhostBusters
Where are the trolls? This movie looks good!
more stupid worthless niggers trying to play the victim bullshit
NO Oscar for Washington. No nomination. Nothing. This movie is awful
My husband and I have been married over 17 years, and so many people questioned us getting married so young. When you know, you know. Two kids and several compromises later, we’re still planning out the rest of our life. I just sent this song to him.

Comment no. 51\nThe closest I'll get to 1\nGreat song by great people ❤
One of their best duets, so good <3
A great duo !
Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \n\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \n\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\n\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV\n\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\n\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\n\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\n\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\n\nRomans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV\n\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\n\nAnd REPENT...\n\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP\n\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP\n\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\n\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\n\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…\n\nAnd don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\n\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\n\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\n1 John 3:7-15\nMicah 6:8\nActs 17:3\nActs 18:5\nJohn 4:25-26\nMark 14:61-62\nRevelation chapters 20-22\nThe entire New Testament
I love you guys.... You guys are so cute
I've always loved them as a couple. Had the pleasure of seeing them both in concert. This song tho is beautiful
Such a beautiful song!! Also cool that Ed Sheeran wrote it
Anyone else notice the likeness between the piano in this and the piano is Jasmine Rae's, When I Found You?
[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]\nSitting with you in a dark room\nWarm by a fireplace\nYou know there's just something about you\nYou brighten my day\nI got something to run past you\nI just hope i say it right\nSo I take your hand and ask you\nHave you made plans for the rest of your life?\n\n[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nThere's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now\n\nAnd that's worryin' about life\nOh, I'll be fine\nIf one gray hair shows, i'll be fine\nIf my waistline goes, i'll be fine\nEven if time takes its toll\nWe'll stay young for the rest of our lives\n\n[Verse 2: Faith Hill]\nI've been making plans for children\nSince I've been looking in your eyes\nI even have names picked out for them\nDaughter; it'd be Rose\nSon; it'd be ___?\n\n[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nThere's one thing I should be giving up, giving up now\nAnd that's worrying about life\nOh, I'll be fine\n\nIf one gray hair shows, I'll be fine\nIf my waistline goes, I'll be fine\nEven if time takes its toll\nWe'll stay young for the rest of our lives\n\n[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nI don't really care about those storm clouds brewing\nOh, as long as you're hear by my side\nOh, we'll be young, oh we'll be young\nOh, we'll be young, when we're old\n\n[Chorus: Tim McGraw & Faith Hill]\nOh, I'll be fine\nIf my gray hair shows, I'll be fine\nIf my waistline goes, I'll be fine\nEven when time takes its toll\nI'll stay young for the rest of my life\nWith you, I'll stay young for the rest of my life\nWith you\nWe'll stay young for the rest of our life
It’s the perfect song!

LYRICS ON MY CHANNEL :D
Wow can not wait wife and my anniversary is in November
How the fuck is this.not top.#1 trending. Probably because it's not some pop shit from some talentless pop star like shitlor swift mily syres or shitsten beybur or no direction or that girl with the ponytail and the Starbucks last name Ariel grand or whatever. Country stuff never makes the top trending. Last thing talented that got the top trending I can remember wasn't that long ago because it was talented Katy Perry with her great newer song swish swish

Wtf is this pathetic beta male garbage? Must get a free block of cheese with this song.
Listened to it on repeat all morning! Amazing song!
(The Great and terrible Day of the Lord. When Jesus comes back to take up his bride and punish the UNREPENTANT Sinners of this Earth. Those that trample the blood of Jesus under foot):\n\nFor the stars of heaven \nand the constellations thereof \n\nshall not give their light:\nthe sun shall be darkened \n\nin his going forth,\nand the moon shall not \ncause her light to shine.\n\nAnd I will punish the world for their evil, \nand the wicked for their iniquity;\n\nand I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease,\nand will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.\n\nI will make a man more precious than fine gold; \neven a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\n\nTherefore I will shake the heavens,\nand the earth shall remove out of her place,\n\nin the wrath of the LORD of hosts,\nand in the day of his fierce anger.\n\n(Isaiah 13:10-13).\n\n(2 Thessalonians 1:7-9)<---And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ).\n\n(Isaiah 66:15)<---For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.\n\n(Isaiah 29:6)<---Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.\n\n(Revelation 19:12)<---His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(REPENTANCE is required to be hidden from the Lords anger/JUDGMENT DAY!):\n\nSeek ye the LORD,\nall ye meek of the earth,\nwho have upheld his justice;\n\nseek righteousness,\nseek meekness:\n\nit may be ye\nshall be hid\n\nin the day of the LORD'S anger.\n\n(Zephaniah 2:3).\n\n***(Seek The Lord): This is the language of true (REPENTANCE), renewal, and regeneration.\n\n***(You will be hidden): Zephaniah used a play on words with meaning of his own name, Hidden in the Lord.

(Matthew 13:30)<---Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers/Angels, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn). (John 14:2-3)<---In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

Ecuador era un muerto en etapa terminal  asI de simple.

Bien hecho Chile la estan sufriendo al igual que nosotros. Espero que nos podamos ver en Rusia. Un saludo desde Arequipa.
La mejor eliminatoria del mundo, en Europa hay mucho equipo flácido todavía
Ecuador , ecuador ....    solo haces noticias por el gobierno..\nComo equipo  desaprovechastes  tus tiempos ... lamentablemente estas son las consecuencias!!

Hi , i'm french and i love your music ♡
Heads up everyone for those that  don't know if you follow the link below you can watch her performance from ACL. I watched it at 3 AM in the morning :o wish I would have known it was being replayed today. It may be played later also but don't know for sure. It was probably her best concert so far. It says 9:55 AM EST.\nhttps://www.redbull.tv/video/AP-1R8RW5EZW1W11/channel-1
Ur my favorite singer
YES GURL YOU SLAY
It's so crazy to think that voice is coming out of such a little girl so beautiful
HOW IS IT THIS COMES OUT AS IM GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING
Simply Charming and Full of Vibes :)
This reminds of the day dogs😀
I wonder if negativity can work to our advantage. If some people go on Taylor and Miley's latest video and say your not happy about Grace's latest., maybe they will come over here in droves and we can get the view count up a bit. Just kidding
She reminds me of a younger version of Sia, her voice is beautiful💕
Hi grace! First of all I just want to say that you’re so pretty and so talented and I want to be just like you! I’m just mindblown of how amazing you are and you are my inspiration and my motivation to just keep on the going. Lol you just make me feel stuff that I don’t normally feel 😂 this weekend I actually had super long hair and I cut it really short like yours so you really are a inspiration but not on just a haircut LOL I like you bc you’re talented, you’re sweet, you’re pretty, you’re funny, you’re relatable, and you’re perfect in every way and no matter how much people tell you to give up just don’t because they’re all jealous and they need to calmmmmmm downnnnnn lol \n\n                                    jur average fan lol 😝 \n                                                                            -Emsley :D

Not one of your best but I love it
If Grace really write her own songs she's literally a genius.
i love you grace vanderwaal
why is this so relatable?....
I am still deciding on this song... What do you think?
Million dollar voice 💖🙈
EVERYONE HAS MORE TALENT THAN ME!
I get the feeling this song isnt just about the classic love story, it may appear that way but to me it has a whole other reason, hating yourself thats what she means when she says she sees it in the movies she sees the big terrifying deppresion hallucinations tv sets but in actuality its something that is just there thats who she hates herself she can escape herself she cant escape her mind, it might not be what it mean but thats how I see it
lovelovelovelovelovelove
1:34 when she says but honey it is happening it sounds like she flirting
I want to see a live version!!!!  What an artist!
whoaaa that was amazing! i know I've commented on your videos saying i don't particularly like the style of music you've been making lately doesn't mean i don't absolutely respect your voice talent and music! i love you so much
Album gonna be so good
Not trying to hate, I enjoyed this song, but I don't think this is one of her bests... This is just my opinion! I do love Grace \n#Fanderwaals
Do Cuphead next
HULKAMANIA BRRRRRRUUUUUTHHERRRRRR

ボーガンのテーマが…
Face reveal on episode 150??
Avgn's hairline is receding even more ):
No Rolling Rock
Doesn't Hulk Hogan always look ridiculous?
Woah, he faze banks that game
LJN = Laughing Joking Numbnuts
I have super wrestle mania
Strong Bads\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand here come the Homestar Runner quotes.
Nerd core
reuploaded?
Wow. Another one
Next is 150! 😀😀😀😀
Need some rogain, james.
bahaha that was great. :)
LOVE THAT OPENING !!!
Awesome video. Love the giant cartridge-guys.
DO CUPHEAD! 🔜 🔌😐
Strongbad!!
Somebody call John Cena!!!
The devil of ljn
AVGN..the good times.
Wrestlefest by Technos japan (1991)
Great video. Good lad.
you know rolling rock comes in a can too, right?
I remember when i was 6, i was at a hotel visiting my grandma, she went away for a few hours then came back with a happy look on her face. She made me follow her down to the parking lot and there was a limo, she got in it and told me to get into it. I slid into the limo unaware of my surroundings, i look around and on the left of me was some old woman, and then i looked in front of me and i shit you not Hulk Hogan was sitting in there! My grandma knew Hulk Hogans wife! I got to spend the whole day with Hulk Hogan and man, it was badass.
sorry nerd, the ljn wrestling games on the snes were damned good, especially royal rumble. what a great step from the nes , just look at the video
Aww, no WCW for NES review? I have the WWF Arcade Game for PS1.
Beyond glad to see that you're still putting out good videos just like the old ones unlike other YouTubers.
Great video but I was hoping he would talk about the n64 and ps2 games.
He don't know Gorgeous George. I weep for his loss.
James likes his wrestling games to be Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter rip-offs...
I'm so happy for the new episode thank you james!
the type of shit that never wipes.....I need them on my raiding team!
Are we not going to talk about Strong Bads?
AVGN? Can I get a  F U C K   Y E A H ?!
James I didn't know you had tattoos from how many years I've been watching you
He's looking his spark. I have a feeling that retirement isn't too far off.
what were they thinking?\n\nclassic
No Muscle on the NES nerd, good.
We're out here in Amish, smokin' big ol' doinks in Amish.
Avgn and wrestling. Best of both worlds
Could you do a review on the Robotech games?
Doesn't Hulk Hogan look ridiculous in reality anyway?\n\nNot really. He looks like a regular professional wrestler mixed with the 1980s glam style that was popular in those days. I think he is happy with the shape he is in especially after decades of abusing his body and for a man his age it is not like he has anything to gloat about, but he could be worse. I definitely do not see him dancing a fit of joy over how completely fantastic he looks, but at the same time I truly do not believe he has anything to be ashamed of or looks in anyway ridiculous.
I wonder if that's where HomeStar Runner got the idea for Strongbad and Strongmad.
A shitty video game that I'd love for the Angry Video Game Nerd to review is Fallout Brotherhood of Steel.
Hey AVGN  you should review Mortal Kombat Advance for the Game boy advance.
AVGN has been KILLING it lately. He's back!
I remember playing WWF Super Wrestlemania on SNES, I thought it wasn't all that bad. Then N64 came out & WWF Wrestlemania 2000 & WWF No Mercy came out, those are IMO the 2 best wrestling games ever made. WWF Smackdown was awesome too for PS, but I lost interest in that series after Here Comes the Pain on PS2.
Trying to hit a guy here is like trying to hit a grain of sand with a tennis racket while Andre the giant farts directly into your nostrils
Nerd! Royal Rumble was soooo good!!! gotta push a direction while spamming the button to do the moves. Best wrasslin' game hands down until no mercy for 64.
saturday night slam masters was my favourite. THANK YOU!!!
Love that rhyming like the Rock did. After all these years, you still got that raging attitude we love about you Nerd.
I’ve been waiting for him to review wrestling games
The sprites look like as if thy crapped their pants
Is this because of the new WWE 2K18 game that is coming out? ^_^ If only I am able to get a PS4.
I just saw wrestle mania at my local flea market
some wrestling games were pretty good. not these tho.......
I see the COLÔNIA STRIKES BACK video with you\nSr Wilson its the happynest person of the world now\nHehehe!
Getting a Nerd video this early is like getting sucked off on my birthday!
Early gift for my birthday, thank you James! :D
This episode sucks... is no funny!!!
Huh. He's really cranking them out nowadays. Cool deal.
AGHH! Fuck this piece of shit! I'm done! I don't know but for some reason, the way he says it is hilarious to me xD
Conker's bad fur day review! Please, Conker's bad fur day now !!!!
Oh James it didn't get any better when the games went into 3D. Wrestling games have always been sluggish.
Wow; I didn't know the AVGN was a wrestling fan.
lol fuck fart.. wouldn't that be a queef hahaha
I actually played WrestleMania the arcade game and it was fun
That’s a pretty epic tattoo
Strong bads? I guess the guys at homestar actually used some inspiration? I never looked up if there was something before
I'd say the Nerd should try the WWE games for the Nintendo 64 but those don't probably stink as bad as the LJN versions.  X)
The fu.. Another Nerd episode! Keep 'em coming because the Youtube needs to know, what the Nerd is cooking!
ok that better have been Mike in the super nes game costume lol , ya know because tradition.
This suckquake of a game is a complete wastenado of my seven bucksonsoon.
What did we do to deserve two AVGN vids in less than three weeks?!
You're not Stone Cold Steven Austin but you're close enough!
It's too bad the cartridge you wrestled with doesn't talk. It would've been more interesting to see him try to trash the nerd.
lmao Yokozuna used to be my neighbor
After this video hucksters on ebay blow up the prices on Slammasters and WWF Arcade Game. 100% guaranteed!!!!
Who knows the only good Ljn game
Hopefully we get him doing I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream this Halloween.
I hope he'll make some of the newer versions
Make a episode pertaining to dinosaur themed video games!
N64 wrestling games were the best!  THQ FTW
We need part II with n64/ps games Warzone, WCW VS the World, Nitro, Thunder & the THQ WWF/ WCW Games (Revenge/wrestlemania etc) 😝
sweet as a candied ass jam brownie with weeed!
Im not prepare to see the Angry nerd like Saitama from One Punch Man.
Was hoping for a homestar runner reference
300 pounds of man-ass\n\nYeah, I remember Rikishi too.
Love seeing a new avgn! My only wish is that there could be more time per game (maybe less games per vid). :)
Doesn't Hulk Hogan look ridiculous in reality anyway?
AJ Styles is the GOAT.

Brilliant! And your hair looks lovely
Love it when Jim popped up😂
This video made me so happy😂😂😂😂
It's so weird when Zoe said do you smell pickled onions or like vinegar I was eating salt and vinegar chips
Omg I just watch an old video and wondered when Lou has her baby can Zoe tell us again ❤️❤️❤️
I loved this video! I love when you make these types of videos with Zoe! You two are always hilarious together!

When Zoe started singing the only difference between martyrdom and suicide is press coverage I squeal like the little fan girl I am
If Louis wasn't expecting, I'd think that you were smoking the funny cigarettes 😉
What hair dye do you use to make your locks such a lovely pink?! I've wanted to dye my hair this colour for so long but haven't quite been able to find a dye that I like. I love the shade you have in your hair however and I'm dying to know what company and color you use!! <3
Marcus Butler telling somebody off about creative content is the most ironic thing ever

Enter in google: Antivirusxxx key. You can find FREE license keys for AVG anti-virus companies and it is performing 100%.
I love videos about people's BELONGINGS and ROOMS and SPACES. It is the most fascinating thing what everyone has, what connections people have to the things they own and how they arrange them. What crumpled receipts people have in their bags, and their favourite cuddly toys, and the things they keep as mementos. The things they can't throw away and the things that remind them of, say, 2007 specifically. The colours and light flow and the arrangement of furniture in people's rooms. How people organise the same stuff in a thousand different ways. What we consider necessary, or a part of our identity, or a tangible expression of some facet of ourselves. Anyway I want you to know that I own 20 plastic frogs.
I am a camera, I didn’t want to learn this truth
Dan I can watch you do anything and love it, literally when I feel down I binge watch your videos and it immediately makes me feel better because you're so honest in every video, I love it ❤️
YOURS WILL SOON BE NOT AS NICE
I mean you have 4 suits that you have worn so talk about being an adult 🤗
Not to be captain obvious but you take your dry cleaning to the dry cleaners.
Yeh but is it even a Daniel J Layton video without the Harry Potter books in frame???
this is one of my favourite “series” i guess idk i love the two videos you’ve made about this it helps so much.
Dan. I would hands down date you. Like no joke.
Does anybody really know what dry cleaning is? A good place to go for dry cleaning is Timpsons, and they might be able to fix boots as well. Kill two birds with one stone. Potentially three birds with one stone, because there are Timpson branches at some supermarkets like Sainsbury's and Morrisons, so you can do food shopping as well.
HAHAHAH the Janet posters even in ur uni halls.\nYou already knew who you were. I'm proud.
Not knowing what dry cleaning is--too real.
Dry cleaning is a process of soaking in a chemical solvent rather than water. It's for fabrics that would degrade in water, or for pieces that are too delicate for a washing machine.
I have just cleaned the three mugs from my room. And I now have a clothes bench at the end of my bed. I will never really be an adult.
Well done for getting this far in it! (This is genuine and not sarcastic btw)
having a film 'keeping you company' whilst cleaning is the best description i have ever heard - i do this at least 3 times a week (but normally with reruns of community or rick and morty)
I utterly understand everything said in this video, and its nice to know as an 18 year old female that people other than me enjoy cleaning...but where is the room tour tho.
Will you make a video of you building your desk like you did with dodie?
I do the same thing when I’m cleaning/tidying I’ll either put on headphones and listen to non lyrical music or YouTube videos (depending on my mood) and when it’s YouTube videos it definitely something to just listen to in the background and have a voice I can check in with at times, it’s SO nice and cathartic and I get to laugh if things are funny or just listen to someone go through their day/topic and it’s makes me feel accomplished and stuff, agreed. It’s great
I love this video! I clean my room late at night and listening to music and watch tv or movies, I love your videos and I relate to the stuff you talk about, I am Fan of your bakingwithlayton videos there amazing and I also love to bake.
My Mum asked me to take a dress to the dry cleaner once and was perplexed about why I seemed so stressed out by what seemed to her, a simple task. I had to go to the city, talk to the lady I mean... what do I ask for? Can I just be like, here's a dress do your thing? How much does it cost? Can I pick it up that day? That week? Whats the deal?\n\nIt's funny because I only did it that once and it was so stressful it was all kind of a blur so if I ever needs to do that again I'm back to square one I've got no idea.
where is your closet from? it is exacly what i've been looking for
You should do some film recommendations 😻
But you forgot about room tour!!!
Ask google to find you a decent dry cleaners. You haul your stuff to them they work their magic and then you get it back clean pressed and on hangers. If you want your stuff starched make sure to ask. I liked a really stiff chefs coat back in the day. Like turn it sideways and it doesn't budge. I'd ask for hot press and triple starch. Then I wouldn't have to iron it as hard to keep that nice line. It shouldn't be too expensive either. I mean less than $20ish per suit. Usually they can do it super fast too.
M8 where are your fairy lights from? 😂. The really important question
Stoff
Hm... with all of the stuff you still have, I'm not sure I'm convinced that you ever actually got rid of anything. Lol. Dan, at this rate you are going to end up on that show hoarders!
You're so right about spending all your money moving that you have none to actually decorate. I found this out when I moved to edinburgh and ended up buying two leather recliner sofas for £50 in total. They look like shit, but are comfy as hell. I also bought a wardrobe and chest of drawers for £40 in total as they were ex display. It is these kind of moments when I realise that I am truly an adult.
I moved in august, the bedroom is a disaster (the rest isn't much better but that isn't my point). Soon very soon there will be bought another closet for the bedroom, so at least 40 % of the floor will reappear from under bags of towels, table cloths and bedding stuff - I hope.\nVedo is nice, I have missed these short interactions, like back in the old days where you challenges yourself to do a video every week :)
3:29 babe you could never turn me off.\n\n\nhahaha.\n\n\n\nlol.
Wow, I'm fairly confident that me and Dan shared the same student halls... and I can confirm they really are great!
OMG Tell me if you have figgured out the Dry Cleaning! I have a dedicated place in my bathroom where I hang my dresses for weddings... and they stay there, I buy new ones. I love the old ones... they need dry cleaning.... I don't even??? I am good at grown-up stuff (thats half a brag right there!) but Dry Cleaning is an actual mystery...
Wall of memes i love it
Dry cleaning is cleaning using regulated and toxic chemicals instead of water and its so expensive its not economical for anyone to have a private dry cleaning setup which is why you need to go to a storefront for it. Also water will shrink suit fabric which is why you need to do that.\n\nJust google dry cleaner near me, bring your suits, and maybe ask how much its gonna be and how long its gonna take.
I am moving house at the the moment, so I can feel this video really well.
Your VEDO is my favorite VEDO, I could honestly listen to you talk about anything.
Been in my place for 11 years now.   Still not done.
This video was the perfect length for me to watch while I took off my make up. So THANKS DAN!
So excited for your vid on my birthday (25th october, pls give me a shoutout am too excited <3 )
I moved to uni a few weeks ago, and it took me about 3 days to put my polaroids up in my room. And oh mY GoD did it make a difference. Literally 15 tiny little photos from holidays, SitC, parties etc made my room instantly feel more like home. Today we printed a load of flat photos and hung them in our kitchen/dining area. It's crazy how much difference a few photos and fairy lights make
In the time between when I was 11 to 18 I moved house 9 times. The thing that mad my room my room was all my posters and drawings. Every house they moved with me and made it the new place a home.
As a kid I used to love going to the dry cleaners with my mum/dad. The front desk was at a level above my head but it had a sort of ledge on it that was child level. I thought they were the best place caus they remembered that little kids like to see the top of a front desks too. I was a very easy child to please 😁
Okay a little tip for the drycleaning suits. IT'S expensive. This is something a lot of professional instrumentalists do. They wait until it's really cold out, like freezing overnight and they just put their suits outside to get the smell of sweat out of their suits. Apparently this is supposed to work, don't ask me how, I'm a girl, but I've heard this so many times by different people. It's worth a try.
Talking about things being familiar and comforting, sitting in a new uni flat and just hearing your outtro makes me feel so much more comfortable in my own skin. Thanks for the video today Dan :)
Lucky, my uni doesn't allow me to hang pictures or posters on the wall, not even with Blu Tack. However, there's a huge corkboard along the wall, so my grandad undid a couple of the screws and that's where my pictures hang instead.
I started uni about a week ago and this helped me a lot :) thanks Dan
I relate to this so much. I started uni 2 months ago and I'm still decorating my room!
Were you in Lincoln courts because that's where I am right now.
LEGIT HAVING THE EXACT SAME ADULT PROBLEMS. I have a coat and a dress that need to be drycleaned, plus a pair of boots that desperately need a fix. So please update us on when and how you solve these issues.
I legit want to do a big tidy now... I suppose that is procrastinating as I have SO many essays due in
This spoke to me. I feel like I am in exactly the same place as you. I love the chill clean up time!
Go to the dry cleaners for your suits And the cobbler for your boot.
‘How do you amass glasses in such a fashion’ *stares disappointedly at the piles of glasses and clothes scattered all over my war zone of a room*
I have your videos to keep me company while I'm doing my evening routine. :-)
clothes on clothes on clothes on clothes...... on a *chair* \n\nnever thought I'd relate so much <3
Lovely vid Dan, hope you're settling in well! I really enjoy your I'm just a normal person doing normal things with a sarcastic yet hopeful British attitude brand. It makes me feel like I'm not the only one, you know?
I love you Daniel J. Layton!! Xxx
I love that you guys live so close it really is like you're living in the Friends building because you have your friends close 😊
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
I love when YouTubers make videos of them just talking about life and doing everyday tasks like in Dodie's vid where she makes pasta and talks about her love life or now when Dan is just cleaning his room. It feels so personal and I feel at ease and so comfortable in this one sided conversation.
1:05 i now have defying gravity stuck in my head cheers daniel j
i cleared so much shit out of my childhood bedroom a couple of months ago and dear god CATHARSIS
Literally just stopped everything I was doing to watch this video I love all your videos Dan but these are my favourite just listening to you rambling is in a way comforting just feels like we are two friends hanging out and just talking xx
The not feeling settled and 'at home' until you've decorated it to make it your own personal safe space is SO TRUE. You discussed it in your August PMS too and all of the chaos of my mental state suddenly made sense: I recently moved to a new city for a year long work placement.. I'm living with people I barely know who know each other better, I'm away from friends who in the past two years of uni have become like family, and as a result am missing my beloved family more so than previous years away from home. We can't decorate our rooms, so I have large expanses of white walls surrounding me and whenever I'm in my room I never felt quite fully relaxed.. It's not MY space, it's no ones space and as such it feels like I've in turn rented my brain out to so many feelings that I can't nail down and think through freely. Thank you Dan for helping that fall into place, your videos are one thing that does feel homely (if that can be not a weird choice of word) and calm my racing brain xx
I have exactly zero suits, and I also do not know what dry cleaning is ;) sorcery!
I do the same but instead of tidy because effort, I alphabetise my dvd collection and when I say collection I mean I could single handily re open blockbusters
I'm just moved and THANK YOU. My house is like almost there now at about 2 months after the move in date.
@daniel J. Layton Can we start a patrion to get you money to buy a bookshelf because the books just sitting in the corners are killing me.
That was my room then I moved out from my parents and left it all because it didn't fit in my suitcase
I love your videos you are an inspiration <3
i love videos like this :))
Did... did Dan go to Canada recently? He really didn't mention it much if he did ;)
Please make more of these. Mainly because I love the way you pronounce stuff.

Your hope framing and focusing makes me feel relaxed

Omg I love your Harry Potter poster 💛
Lol dan is adorable
I'm enjoying you VEDO immensely! ^_^
Stoff stoff stoff stoff stoff
YES DAN
STOFF
oh ma goodness
Relatable
That Janet Jackson poster though
bit echo-y innit. still great tho. still great.
Yay, i got the first like.i love you're videos thank you for them i was just in a really bad place, exxellent timing\nDry cleaning is getting a person at a laundromat to do it
Wow I actually want to tidy now, thank you Dan I am going to tidy now
Even though I'm literally a teenager right now, I'm already pretty house-proud and 'Monica'. I have two things on my desk right now - both anthologies for uni - and then there is nothing else messy in my room.
SPOTLESS
It takes a talent to entertain people with the bare minimum. I mean, i've just watched 4 miutes of you folding clothes and it ended too soon. Looking forward to tomorrow's vid :)
Your gonna laugh but British Heart Foundation is great to cheap furniture.
Really not a fan of wire hangers. Hate to break it to you.
I am sitting in my uni room as a first year with the exact same Friends poster on my wall. Love that
Cleaning has become my relaxing thing as well, whenever my mental health gets a bit shaky and I feel like I can't achieve anything, I just do a bit of cleaning so I know I've got something done, it's lovely!
Cleaning is  so calming sometimes and I agree, cleaning with something like a movie playing in the background is so cathartic
I clean my room to procrastinate then procrastinate cleaning my room :/
I'm a hoarder too, I keep leaves and rocks and things, mostly paper from school... it's clogging up my room. there is stuff everywhere in my room... I am probably, sadly the 'typical teenager' who just hoards plastic bottles. plus I love your poster... 😁
im gonna be dragged to pieces for suggesting this, but i think you have to start buying ebooks instead of physical copys of books until you have more space
THANK  U SO MUCH OMG
YASSSSSS
-literally couple goals-

Hey Mama Hanz!🤗 This is my 3rd Hanzoween and I LOVE your work! Its so detailed and you always learn something by the end! I think your looks using sfx like your Jigsaw and mummy are sooo amazing but can you also do lots of looks that use just body paint? I absolutely love watching you create such deatailed and dimmentional looks with just different paints! Its truly a joy to watch and to learn from you! I soooo look forward to the rest of Hanzoween! Its my favorite time of year on YouTube!!! XOXO💜😘
This is such a great partner look I love it omg
Are you able to do a look with liquid latex and cotton balls/cotton pads please as i cant afford all the stuff you use in your Videos 😥
You have such a pretty face every look that you do comes out perfect so talented love watching you Jordan😘
Haha, that would suck all the dick 😂
Seriously, think you two could be sisters. I, at first, during the intro, was like, hmmm, which one is Jordan....then I'm like...duh, Chucky....Jordan is Chucky.
I don't know why, but black lipstick is sexy af
I'm so happy to have watched the two of you together :) The two of you are amazing to watch absolutely amazing artists and can't wait to see if you both collab agin through out the month of hanzoween..... :)
Literally thought Jordan was Jaclyn Hill in the thumb nail! 😬
Bishhhhh I’m shook!
The Lady who played Chucky looks more like Tiffany tho lol
There aren’t enough thumbs on YouTube for how much I like this video
Jordan looks like a scary but somehow still pretty Jennifer Lawrence 😂 and Kristi is a bad ass as always
I loved this video😍😍😍😍
how do you not have more subscribers?? i’ve honestly never seen a more talented artist 😍
Chuckys scars are on the wrong side XD
Love tge attention to detail!
You make Chuckie look pretty af. #hanzfam \nCan't wait for more collabs with you and Kristy. Y'all did great. And the red hair looks awesome on you.
😂😂😂 love you girlssss
Some advice for the freckles: dont mix eyeshadow with water ! The water will evaporate and leave powder which will move around and be dirty looking. (Trust me, i learned the hard way). Use a mixing liquid or setting spray instead.
I HAVE to try this for Halloween this year. Like I'm in love with your take on it. Whenever you were searching for the on Amazon what did you search? Because I've searched red/orange wigs and I they're all like waaaay to red or way to orange
Is the pros aide cream essential and also how is the alcone 3rd degree going over your brow, do you cover the jar to protect it? Thank you, hoping to recreate for Halloween! 🎃 💗 👻 p.s. love you and your videos you're AMAZING!!
Aw, Rawbeautykristi is teeny tiny - or are you tall Jordan? Love your collabs! :) x
Im curious about your lip piercing.. I want one it's so cute! Does it hurt? Is it in the way? Did it hurt to do it? How was the healing time? What kind of jewellery have you in it?
He's kind of a warm ass bitch lmao, please do more collabs!! :-D
_he he slow boy_
Wow. Technology is insane.
That millionaire music 😂😂😂
i looked away lol
What a BIG boi
He is gay
I beat Ur score bich!
Look at those sandal tan lines.
you can see the tan lines from the birkinstocks
He dabbed on them haters hard and lower than the amount of subs Jake Lost
Dabbing wasn't wasn't cool and it still isn't😒
Naa not buying it. It's clearly sped up
This is like a let's see how low people will go to watch crap experiment.

Oh what a glorious day!

*OH WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY*
So cringy
My longest dab, I coughed for 2min straight
Fuk meh
oh

Wtf Jack...
Retarded
Is Sundae wearing a neon green kerchief? BOI

HACKS
Ahh! METAL!
Did he win the million though?
When the dab is so good a dog comes to watch :-)
Lol the birkenstocks tan on his feet
The dab is dead
0:33 FUCK U HE CAN DO IT
i loved the millionaire music
2016 called, it really wants to keep dabs in the vicinity of its time-line, and every time a person does a dab a baby rabbit gets snatched up by a hawk. The longer you do it, the longer the pain and torture of the baby rabbit until its demise. Donate at least 1 cent to the stop the dab foundation STDF in short, to really make a change in our unintelligent, thought dwindling, baby booming psychotic society.
i'll only be impressed if he does it for an hour
obviously fake, there's no way.
*V A C  B A N*
next step, longest dab combined with longest YEAH BOIIIIIIIIIIIII
Me me prince boy
Ok so I tried this today and...not gonna lie my deepest was 20 seconds so this REALLY takes talent and our beautiful big boy has truly done a magnificent job. Bravo.
This was so fucking faked bro get off the interwebs
Quality content right here lady's and gentlemen .
What a fab dab
*Confirmed: Jacksfilms Takes Preformance-Enhancing Drugs*\nIn a recent stunt _My slowest, longest dab_, the popular YouTuber jacksfilms dabbed for 50 seconds! This sounds inspiring to upcoming dabbers, but when you find that he took a drug test and it was positive, all respect is lost.\nBy: Raendum Equlz Foonii
Can you please get a world record for the longest and lowest dab?
I can do better
This will eventually turn normies into in un-normies ,or they will take the awesome pickle Rick memes and turn it into normie meme.
I just wasted 58 seconds of my life, watching Jack dab..,..
look behind the chair.
That's not the kind of dab I was expecting, lol.
This was lowkey kind of a garbage, cancerous video...... Sorry, Jack :/
That's why it took you ~10 years to get 3 million subs.
The perfect video doesn't exi-
*who wants to be a millionaire music plays*
Sadly the day after he died poor man drowned in pussy
Some things were not made to exist

Moose is so spoiled and I love it!!!!!!! 🤣 I do the same with my dog

Mr Kate collab with your new house??? 🤔💕 Love you Laur!!!

Girl what is that lip? ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You look so beautiful here. Youre always pretty but today your glowing
There is a dewy + smooth fit me instead of the matte + poreless! i'm not sure if the shades are the same though
Hey Nyma I would love to see a video of you trying the darkest shade of Huda Beauty foundation

I am generally not fond of lashes\nBut I really loves yours\nIt really looks good on you
Take a shot every time she says foundation
Do they have the W10 in loreal one cause w stands for warm which would be more red which you will like. And if they also made the lumi one in 10w that you would love too
specifics on your nail color please? Thx
Yo I saw you on Harry the other day and nearly died from screaming. I'm so happy for your success
I literally love you!!
Girl I found u when when u had a lil bit of subscribers and I was so confused why u didn't have more cause ur content was amazing congrats ❤️
Girl what is that lippie?
I'm as dark as midnight myself and I don't wear makeup. But I'm glad there are options out there that don't stop at 11:30 p.m. Shout out to you, Jackie Aina, and toomuchmouth for representing.❤️❤️❤️
It would be fantastic if you could do a video on Vasanti Cosmetics MatteCrush lipstick line!!!
Although sometimes I enjoy longer videos, I like that the majority of your videos are shorter. It’s nice to get to the point and watch something without needing to commit to 25-30 minutes.
TAKE A SHOT EVERY TIME NYMA SAYS FOUNDATION 💚
my Walmart sells shades for deeper skin and toy don't know how excited I was when I walked into walgreens and they had all shades of the true match
I use the Fit Me in 360.I like it but its not really my color around my jaw line I feelbitsca little ashy. I would love to try LA Girl but they don't sale that around here 😒 #GETWITHTHEPROGRAM
Do you have any recommendations for oily skin? 😅 I'm personally not a fan of the Fit Me.
I know there is a lot of self-hate in the black community. But let me just say, as a light-skinned/high-yellow black woman I think you are absolutely GORGEOUS! I wish I had beautiful, rich skin like yours. Absolutely stunning! Love your vids!!! 😃
Perfect! Short and to the point
You’re beautiful!😍Thanks for this video!
Can you talk about your tattoos please? I'm dark skin and been always wanting to get a tattoo but scared cause it won't show. I love your tatts
your skin looks so glowy!! 💕 sending you lots of love
What is in your lips it looks amazing!
She is so fucking beautiful I can’t 😭😍
girl you might want to adjust the white balance of your videos so your eyes don't look yellow hehe
I'm watching Nyma's videos even though I'm white. I like her personality, how she's not your typical beauty guru. I don't know, I just really enjoy watching her videos even though I'm not her target demographic. Keep up the good work Nyma❤️
GURL whats your lip i need it 👁👄👁 ❤️❤️❤️ love you nyma
You're so pretty and your voice is so soothing 😌
I deffo think that the NYX drop foundation must have a different formula for the deeper shades. I'm the lightest shade (pale) and it is super drying and is horrible on my dry skin RIP. I really enjoy your videos Nyma!!
I feel you on how it's hard to find foundations to match because I have a really yellow undertone and when I find a great one from the drugstore I think that'll match me it either turns out to be wayyy to pink on me even though it looks yellow tonish. The only one foundation that seems to match me good is milani conceal n perfect in #1 but it feels to heavy on the skin for me so that's why I'm kinda bummed out. Even the maybelline one I cannot find my correct shade 💔💔💔
This is such a great and important video!  I read online that sometimes mom and pop drugstores don’t stock darker shades because they’re afraid that people who use those shades would shoplift.
you look so gorgeous, you should do a tutorial on this look!
You always look beautiful but you look even more gorgeous than ever in this video. That glow is to die for 😍
Can you please try Malani Foundation?! It's a really great drugstore foundation for like $12. My fav by far.
You look so radiant and stunning 💕
Thank you for this! I'm definitely going to try the Fit Me one because my skin is the oiliest of the oily. Thanks, Nyma! :-)
i have not tried the nyx or the la girl. i will def try it now!
You're so beautiful❤️
Ridiculously beautiful!

Girllll you look GORGEOUS!!!😍
You're sooo gorgeous!!!! 😍😍😍
Omg she's so beautiful
This girl is a stunner
Love the videos, would it be possible to add a list of the foods featured for their spelling? There aren't many authentic places near me, so when I'm out of the city I like to try out new items, but find it hard to remember what to look for, especially when the menu is poorly translated or translated very vaguely.
I am definitely team red too 😋
hah! You're still rocking that Vancouver T Shirt!   YES!!!!
For me, these dishes have too much starch overall, on the other hand I like starchy foods, but I would rather not gain weight.
Damn bruh, not even the hot oil could save you. That's a sad day lol
If you have never tried biang biang before, your noodle life is not complete! Lol! I agree! 😁
What is that iconic xi an cold noodle dish called again?
FoodNetwork needs to give you a show...I could watch you eat Chinese food all day long 😂 love your videos!!
I'm from 西安 as well and I loveeeee ur videos. It reminds me about home every time when I hear you speak mandarin with a bit of the xian dialect. Pepper soup is my favourite food and  vinegar complete my life. Got u fam.
Never have Xian food. Looks delicious!
Your making me hungry
Thanks for telling what is halal and can you pls mention wether the food is halal or not in your future videos pls
Can you visit Chicago? It has a Chinatown and I want to know what restaurants to visits.
that intro song is sick... reminded me of my X.
How old are you Mike?
Your hind leg is rising up DID NO ONE CATCH THAT?\nWe are bipedal mammals we don't have hind legs b o i
Hey Mikey you should come back Xi'an and give us a tour of what it's like and all of your child hood foods that aren't served here in the US
I'll have to research good Xi'an places here in Vancouver. It seems like my kind of food!!!
Xi'an is Chang'an ? \n\nThe city of Empress Wu ?
I can only watch your videos when I'm eating because I get so hungry watching you
You can have love without marriage and you can have marriage without love.
I recognized this place immediately! When I was in La I went here with my family. How cool.
I've gone to the same plaza many times, but I've never seen that restaraunt lol
Never end a video in a low note
i feel fat watching this
YO\nI LIVE IN THAT AREA
Next thing u know the white pepper is salt
I am glad that Xi'an Garden is pretty authentic. \n\nMy girlfiend and I love that place!
You always like everything. How much they pay you?
baby in background at 11:50 was crying in step with the music in background lol
your hind leg is rising up  -- priceless! That pao mo looked great btw.
Mike-e you are the best ! I live an hour from Los Angeles, and i'm going to try to visit the first place you went to in honor of you. I will show my waiter the foods and hopefully they will be able to bring me those, just how you had them. Keep keeping on. Much Support from a happy mother of four, that looks at your videos on her free time.
Mike you should come to Bangladesh. You would love the cuisine here.
Come to malaysia when raya fest i show you how malaysian eat
for the 200 of you guys that dislike this video ... you all dont know good food when you see it ..
3:04 food porn...
I love you Mikey, but please stop sticking your chopsticks in your bowls! 😂
COME TO THE FLINDERSTREET CAFE!!!!!!!!
Great videos Mikey!  I especially liked your visit to Shirokiya in the Ala Moana Shopping Center...my favorite stop.  Next time you're in town, you gotta try their Kulu Kulu custard filled pastry....onolicious!  Thanks for the tours!  Aloha!
The food looks so good that I actually got chills while watching it!😁😌
Your hind leg is rising up LOL
Those steamed noodles in the second place sound right up my alley.
Mark Wiens has a million subscribers; and the Food Ranger just reached one million subscribers.  Time to get this channel to one million subscribers as well.   It would be dope if you would do a collaboration with the Both of them.  I think it would definitely get you over that million mark.
You're in my area!
How sad, disepointed, destroyed, mad, upset, lifethretendly hart broken would he have been if there would have been western broccoli in the soup.
BUT WHEN IS MIKE ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO CHINA
That place is 28 miles from my house. Guess where I'm going Saturday. Thanks
I just moved from LA to Little Fort, Canada and I'm already missing the food
try the kitchen sink at fair oaks pharmacy in south pasadena east of los angeles!
@13:35 No stuffed sneezes so your not full!
The noodles are my favorite
bruh look like budget jackie chan
No buddy cares if you go round  their restaurant
Loved your videos. Keep it up. You are a legendary eater food lover
if this is your random free day, when do you ever have a real free day? 😂 thanks for entertaining us with your videos!
Anyone know what the places are called
I miss Xi'an food so much after this vedio
Makes me miss China already.
Love your honest reviews, thanks for keeping it real! You da best Mike!
You would like more pork on the back of your bun???  9:00
Making this video available in Colorado where nothing close to Xian food is available, is a crime
Get out of LA wtf!!!    Find something with ambience and class.    You are losing it bub!!!!
I'm hungry, i want to eat
Those gooey noodles look amazing....wish I knew how to cook something like that
Spicy means burning butt when on the toilet 🚽
I do the same thing whenever I eat food from my country, especially specialized regional and provincial cuisine..
U should go New Orleans and go to try the special number 2 which is from Orchards Ramen restaurant.
That is not soup, its jello.
please try Filipino foods...  :)   love your videos...  the secret taste of every food I eat!!!!  stay cool!!!
Mike, make a Live Stream 🤤
Oh my god, I miss the food
this channel always makes me hungry
Hi Mike, when you order several dishes, do you eat all of them at one sitting or do you taste each and take the rest home...smile
Definitely one thing I miss about LA is the MASSIVE variety of foods you can get.
Can you try Japanese food in LA? Cindy’s kitchen was 2 minutes away. Can you do a meetup at Westfield Santa Anita?
Mike, I am so happy you got a taste of home! That is an important thing for people who have moved far from the the place they grew up. And thank you for the education! Watching your videos has taught me a great deal about places and cultures that I am not familiar with.
Would love to see you go to Xian
Mike omg I'm so happy I did not know you had this channel, I love Beyond Science. You are the man!
I can give you a few places to eat at since your in my home town
Did he say my wife's friends recommended it
It's a motel for Chinese food
The consistency of the soup looks like snot. 😶
You should  try the hat in la  san Gabriel yum good  eatting
slurp...sluuuurrppp.... mieeennn noodle...! thats a chinese burger, so delicious, with lamb,pork, Thats WOW,i think! i never try this
Slimy food
Broccoli

I LOVE THE BEEF PORK THING OMG\nI'm Chinese btw\nI think it's called Rou Jia Muo?\nAnd I eat spicy food like it's no big deal
Great
Asian food 😍
 Happy bite , happy life - Mike Chen
My hometown.
The meat juice!!
Go to ISIS base
made me hungry
他們殺死無辜者，殺死我們的孩子，我們怎樣不能捍衛自己，摧毀俄羅斯呢，永遠終結呢？
哇 居然来了San Gabriel!
whenever I ate a cousins regarding lam, it smells nastyhowever you ate lam without disgustingI envy you
Is the Rouwan Hulatang 肉丸胡辣汤 different than Henan style Hulatang?
mike!! make the low mein noodles!!
This is very tragic, so is what's happening in Rosemont Illinois, with the young black lady that was found in the Crown Plaza hotel freezer, but no coverage on that,,,,,Smdh
Itsashley doesn't get it because she is a Democrat.
Anyone else think that was a belt-fed gun military grade and there's no way this guy could have done that sounds like he's a patsy for some big psyop operation
FAKE NEWS RELEASE THE HOTEL VIDEOS OF THE SHOOTER BRINGING ALL THOSE GUNS IN THE HOTEL OR THE SHOOTER WITH ALL THOSE SUIT BAGS 23 GUNS SMH IT DONT MAKING SENSE
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
Paddock was VERY wealthy. Did Paddock sell his SOUL to the DEVIL to have everything he ever wanted, in exchange for this violent act?
Chris rock was right!   whatever happened to crazy ? He had no motive except crazy!  I wish they'd stop mentioning scumbags name.
Y'all a little slow over there?
What if when he booked that hotel, he saw all the people and thats where he got the idea in the first place.
That's creepy, I was just at the Life Is Beautiful Festival last week and noticed people watching the festivities from the tall condo building.
Never giving up my second amendment tho
AlJaazera im Disappointed in You Guys ,Im going back to RT
There are more the two shooters!!!! Show the countless videos with two distinct and different distance gun shots.  False flag for gun grab.
No one is talking about the woman who warned them they were going to die that night weird?
This is unacceptable let's drop some bombs on Afghanistan and teach them a lesson!!
What about the flashing lights on the 12th floor?? Plenty of videos showing it
Sin city
Will you let them rest my god. I'm sick of hearing about this. None of the news networks care about the people who died all they want is ratings and to exploit and profit from their deaths.
He wanted to be on the fbi most wanted list, like dad  who betrayed him and his family bank robbing
she very old woman she .my grandma just 55year's old she is 64..she is from Philippines..??
A.J., be the first network to demand the hotel security video footage, of him loading up the room with 20 AR modified full auto rifles.  and the entire 2 hour before- during -after hallway cam, on 32nd floor.  You could gain credibility as a network. simply demand the footage, till they turn it over.
Notice the reporters head is perfectly covering the shot out windows? But why?
Why aren't reporters asking, why he chose a venue full of T🤡rump supporters, red necks and nationalist??? As he obviously didn't attack the other concerts full of hippies, minorities and gays!
BUMP-STOCK, bump-stock !! not quite so sexy .  IT'S A START !
more media bullshit, trying to take our minds off other questions...
This was far worse than September 11th, because it was no way an attack on government, but pure murder.
Go back to bed America. You are free to do as we tell you. -- BH
Yearly 30.000 Americans get killed by guns. More than in 44 European countries combined. The US also has the highest Infant mortality rate of all modern industry countries. America can be proud !!  👍
Government planned the attack.
This could be like that movie shooter ! Gov set uo
No rime or reason to this madness. Whatever his motives were he took along with him.
I live in Las Vegas it's was not only one shooter and why the news not showing or tell the people that there are 3 windows busted out on different floors
He wasn't alone in that hotel room. Media is hush about this
There's no shortage of conspiracy fuckwits posting in the comments. Sad.
Weapons aren't the problem. There is very manipulative, smart, evil people out there who will go through any means necessary to kill a large amount of people for no real reason at all.. Most people who do mass shootings like this are patient and they plan ahead, if we were to SOMEHOW stop EVERYONE from getting hands on a automatic rifle then these crazy people will just learn how to make Bombs to kill people instead. Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\n\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.
That is pretty weird that multi millionaire would go on a shooting spree so randomly
Excuse me but I need to puke!! 😷 This makes me very sick.
NO! The CIA did
What a time to live in.
How sad! My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. I knew some people and celebrities who attended the Life Is Beautiful Music Festival. Scary to think what he may have had planned for that Music Festival.
The type of people who used to rant about Pizza Gate now have a lot of theories about the Vegas shooting.
I think there was more than one shooter. Always will
Comments on videos like this remind how stupid so many people are
On 4chan weeks before the shooting an anonymous person warned against a big attack in Las Vegas. This man is a patsy. No motive because he wasn't motivated. He somehow carried 20 guns into a hotel room by himself. Many say there were two shooters. He was probably a gun runner and got used as a patsy, killed before the shooting ever took place. Look it up.
This title is annoying😂😂
Who chooses these events next to buildings like that how do you not see that as a security nightmare
the woman knows something  Hould her  till u get the true form her
Something definitely seems fishy about all of this. This has inside job written all over it
Why is a terrorist news channel trending ? Just more proof that Youtube is completely biased towards Democrat causes and fakes the whole trending thing. It's not an algorithm, it's the extreme leftists at Youtube manipulating views, likes and your perceptions.
No but his brother did.
God forbid but imagine if he had a Gernade launcher or other explosives
I'm still waiting on the footage of him checking in the hotel and walking around the casino to see if he had with anybody else (accomplice) with him.. there's no way he could have done this completely on his own
Sad to say... This topic will blow over in 2 weeks and we'll be talking about the kardashians again
Bruh if u have 42 guns u got a problem bruh
400 pounds up 30 floors, disables security, and fire alarms, removes 800 pounds of hurricane proof windows, reigns fire for 5-10 minutes, WITH NO MOTIVE, yup government did this
This is domestic terrorism but the media won't call him a terrorist.
America's own Terrorism,but refuse to call it that.. They said they needed motive and the rest of the facts. REALLY!
Thanks hats1976,yes I'm a multi millionaire lawful citizen, with 3000 guns,I would like to attend all that I can
The only way to stop these shootings from happening again is common sense gun control.
Western world hates women.
Government set up
Al jazeera is ISIS propaganda
Scripted.....
Madsteven
FALSE FLAG wake up America
Yes He did
omg...
Catalonia\nPalestine\nScotland\nKosovo\nKurdistan
She knew.
Sin City style
😔😔
🏴
la la muchi la la muchi midnight
Nobody died , no body cried 🐧
Multiple shooters
Al jazeere trending wtf
Bullshit news
FALSE FLAG
🚫BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!\nBAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!🚫
Ha funny
she's lying
So the killer was 'white'. Hope you know that Trump.
Gun control..
What happened in real was an FBI weapon deal with ISIS went wrong, Isis found out paddocks with the government and decided to either take him hostage and carry out the shooting or killed him and carried out the shooting...wondering why they not releasing cctvs of the casino.? Imagine if the public find out that it was an FBI -ISIS weapon deal gone wrong. SO now that paddock is killed he became the suspect for a while until the videos of multiple shooters came out. WAKE UP PEOPLE
Why was she stacking her belongings on top of her as if she were moving, as reported by her neighbors
a 64 yearold man didnt carry 20k rounds of ammo and weapons up to his floor. plus one of his mental issues where from mk ultra. how i know? because various peoole who have been put threw it also had same issues.
Stupid whites always doing mass shootings
Such great jihad will take place in the next three weeks, and within a year, there will be at least five times, Pado, the great hero! Great holy warrior! Heaven has your place!
wait! Isn't Al Jazera the terrorists main channel for getting their message out? Why is this allowed on YouTube?
Way to good statement I know philipinos don't talk the way that lawyer talked
Chance the rapper concert??all he does is help others tho!!
Conspiracy theories are simply a way for mouth breathing retards to feel like they're smart.
White guy killing white people.  No problem.   Great news.
Where in the world can you find mass shooting become a regular occurence? Almost all shooters were white. But no one blamed their white families. Now you have a white shooter with a non-american, non-white girlfriend who is on the other side of the world when it happened and yet her photo is everywhere like she was the one holding the gun. Hmm.. something is NOT right.
if we don’t change gun regulation laws. this will only get worse.
stop referring to this terrorist as the gunman he is a terrorist say it a radical white terrorists
White policeman's jobs and not hard you're never in danger. When all your job is to do is shoot down black people you're not human
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist
americans who support owning automatic  weapon - seem to have the wisdom of a conesnail
Why is there even a thumbs down button on the comments? Somebody... please explain???
So ugly and I honestly don’t see the point of it.
Might be easier to install android on Chromebooks by default and create a chrome os launcher an add some features
It looks so good, I wish you could run windows on it and use it as a proper laptop.
ChromeOS is so limited. Mad to pay so much for a Chromebook
If I want an expensive computer that only runs mobile apps, I'd just get an iPad Pro.
As stunning AS USELESS. \n\nDoes it give the option to install Windows? lol sorry Google, me too I don't like Microsoft, but maybe you can do something about it in 10 years.
I don't understand the purpose of this laptop. Unless Google is trying to compete with Apple and Microsoft with a *FULL* desktop OS. Which Chrome OS isn't that. I bought an Acer laptop off eBay for $300, it came with 8 GB of RAM (upgraded to 12 GB), 1 TB hard drive (upgraded to 500 GB SSD), Intel Core i5-5200u, and NVidia 940m graphics. And my Acer can do more than 10 times the thing the Google Pixelbook can do for more than half the Pixelbook's price
Would hack Linux on it anyway
What is the point of a $1000 laptop that cannot run real desktop programs like Lightroom? Get an iPad Pro if you want this almost-laptop experience
google starting to be like apple too.
Man, I really wish i could use this, but I need muh Windows apps
I don't understand why anybody would get this thing. I guess linux lovers who just purely hates Mac and Windows? For that price, you might as well get a surface or MacBook. Google seems like is trying to copy Apple A LOT recently, and in a bad way. Pixel phone copied all the stuff I hate about iPhone such as no expandable storage, no flexibility (in terms of what you can get, unlike Samsung and LG who gives a lot of options) and no style. I don't buy a phone just because it looks like something else, which is iPhone design in this case, I buy phones only when there are unique things that really makes me bond, just like how you would love a long-term crush. I'd like to see a phone with the company's own flavours, like Samsung with TouchWiz and their stylish S8/note8 and A series devices, not just copying Apple.\nOn the pixel laptop, Pixel is copying 50% Surface 50% MacBook. Heck they even copied Apple's dongle and also fanless concept, hooray! Let's see if the Core i7 chip would desolder itself after a year or two of usage!\nMy suggestion: Go dump the money on a mid-spec Surface or Dell and dump the rest of the money on a Sandy bridge budget powerful pc!
I have Surface/MS products. How can this take the place of my Surface Book or Surface Pro? I'd like to know because I am thinking of changing everything from MS to Google because MS had abandoned their Windows platform and now abandoned Groove Music streaming, of which I loved. Disgusted in MS. I need Adobe services, need a replacement for Word, and most other things I use are apps, so??? Any thoughts? How is or WHAT is Chrome OS?
if only it ran windows lol, I might be interested.
It has a headphone jack - its a dealbreaker -  would buy it if id had the new features like not having a headphone jack like apple does it !
To manage and edit photography. Good on the go tool? or should i just go back to the mac?
Probably the nicest designed piece of hardware on the market right now
Great job as always, Dieter. Just wanted to throw in that I've been using, pretty much exclusively, the HP Chromebook 13 G1 for a year. It's close, not quite!...as nice as this new Objet Du Pixel save for no touchscreen and no 360 hinge. Two bummers when working with Chrome OS/Android Apps. It has a great keyboard and screen (3200x1800 snazzy) and if you're the sort of person, like many, who really does a great deal of writing in various forms on your computer, then it makes gobs of sense. The point you make about how useful android apps are is so true. Big issue for me is running applications that are staples on Mac or Windows, for me that means One Note for example, and being constrained to a web version on the Chromebook. Mine runs an i5 with 8gb of Ram, but the web experience of such Office is just...not. For the right person, and one who digs deep into Google apps, Drive, etc, it is a fantastically efficient way to go. Cheers.
i7 with Google Chrome is like an M16 that shoots BBs. \nPointless.
Literally copied Surfaces \n\n\n\n\n\nWtf?!
*WANNA HEAR A JOKE*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*CHROME OS*
Can this run Win 10?
I hate this American accent. That nauseatingly disgusting sing song gayishly nasal English. I despise it as much as I despise Americans
Wait what... I thought the guy demoing the laptop is an ad from Google. Turns out it was the same guy speaking. Nice cinematography lol
Why all focus on Laptops? Why not a Mac mini type desktop?
Google is trying to become APPLE with way out of price hardware.   NEWS FLASH,  THE reason we HATE APPLE is because their overprice hardware.   Miss the days of the NEXUS.       NEXUS is awesome and swell,  but Pixel can go to
Hey, look a headphone jack. I thought Google was getting away from those. 😑
When you touch the screen, it shakes a lot. It crazy stupid.
This thing makes the 12” MacBook seem like a good buy
Can i code /programma with this? Like Android studio or visual code
Can you put linux in it?
For that price I'd rather get a proper Windows or Mac laptop.
Welcome to the future, where everything sold by the major manufacturers is overpriced by $200-$500.
Can I install Ubuntu in it?
People bash on chromebooks way too much. They're fantastic for school & children and college. But only when they're at a reasonable price. There are some much better windows ultra books you can get at 1000 dollars. Dare I say it a second hand mac would be better. if this were 2 or 3 hundred quid cheaper it would be a far better proposition
It's looking Dope AF...I just love how premium it looks from behind...but the Bezels are ugly IMO.
okay yeah... but can it run Crysis?
I honestly really like Chromebooks especially for typing up papers and doing research, they're pretty inexpensive and work great with my Google Account I've actually used my Chromebook more than my laptop during school times to each their own I guess.
should cost 500-600$ for the i5 8gb 128gb to compete with the ipad line not the windows or mac laptops
i though Apps is EOL pretty soon? Google keep pushing progressing web app, how can web end in the future??\ni dont get it.
I don't understand why people are always like spending x amount of money for this piece of tech is stupid. First of all, you don't have to buy it. Secondly, why do you care what someone else buys with their money if it has no effect on you? Get a life.
Its a chrome book and has 10 hours of battery life, for 1000$. Really? You get that type of battery on Macbooks running Mac OS X. I'd expect better for something running Chrome OS.
Hope the guys at Google will make a  Pixel Tab ....
For the price of this.. I'd rather get a Microsoft Surface Pro laptop
this guy is sweet lol
i'de buy this if can run autocad, photoshop, sketchup and 3dsmax! ^^
Very basic usage. All that you can do with your phone. There is no point google competing this market segment, they will never get the mass with laptops. Google is all about mobile phones and their leading role in the market is undisputed.
Are we heading to a place where Chromebooks eventually run Android?
This video definitely warmed me more to the device, it's pretty much the production tablet that android always promised but failed to deliver.  But damn that price is just .. high  - have they forgotten that they're competing with the Surface Pro?  I don't understand anyone that'd pick this over a Surface Pro when the price difference is negligible.
how many times has that pen dropped through the table gaps in the making of this video?
I see the price dropping on this in future. 
Reinventing the wheel.
Guys, rub Anyone  know larger  this vgrsion
I prefer the word Surface to Pixel because a Surface is greater than just a Pixel...
Still a waste ! Nobody's buying Chromebooks !
My old Nexus 10 has a higher res screen. Feels good man.
Can it run (insert any pro app)? Oh ok 😒✌️. Crazy over priced for what it's capable of doing in real world use. Specs and design are irrelevant if you can't do much with it. May as well get an android tablet. Don't buy something on the promise of what it MIGHT be able to do in the future.

prize?
Cannot run windows?
Dang, I wish I had waited before buying a Samsung Chromebook Pro earlier this year! This thing clearly has better specs and subjectively is much more attractive than the Samsung. Then again, would it really do that much more as a Chromebook?
*A $1000 for a browser No thanks Google*
My Acer Chromebook works fine for $240. I'm all set.
if Google would release a google branded version of desktop linux on a chromebook and get developers interested in developing more mainstream apps for linux (photoshop, etc) then this would DESTROY apple and wintel machines
The pixelbook looks awesome as it is really suite for a terminal use. The ability of running android app makes it good for light-weighted entertainment need. It would be a plus if it is detachable, but i'm OK with current design. The only drawback to me is the price is too high compare to other Windows as it lacks the ecosystem windows established.
Can we write a letter\sentences (in English) and have something convert it like OCR.
100% copy of the Microsoft Surfacebook and that Pen is all a copy of Microsoft. Hp Spectre looks very similar, too. No SD card slot. Lol. 😂 🤣
It is as sexy as useless.
God damn those bezels are huge. If you buy this and want to resell it down the road good luck convincing someone to pay you a fraction of the cost.
No!! It's ridiculous and expensive... It's only for rich dumb kids!!! No thanks!!!
Everything is book now a days
well if phones cost 1000 dollars now, why not this laptop just because there are companies out there making extremely over priced products does not mean every procuct should be over priced dipshit. What a terrible video.
How does this compare to Samsung Chromebook Pro?
Can you say thermal throttle???  You will never see high performance from chip
chrome os is famous for and hallmarked by its lightweight and affordable. fulfilling people's simplest and most labored daily task, like tediously typing, web browsing, sometimes video streaming and light gaming--I don't do games even on my smartphones but people do, many folks would compensate and yield some laptop's functionalities for a little bit better experience of basic performance, I think that's understandable because I tried several chrome books before and they all performed well in terms of aforementioned things. however, misjudging from their ideal concept that people will buy some so-called high-end Chromebooks they are fond of in the past is just an absolute mistake. personally, for instance, I only do care Chromebooks because it is cheap and stable performance, therefore I would not even have a glimpse of thinking to buy a Chromebook if the price is barely equal to a real laptop, let alone this pixel book's astronomical overpriced AF. aesthetically, this book is gorgeous looking but that's it. unless chrome os or, you could generally say android app store can evolve someday to catch up with windows os, there will never be any reasonable logics to get a Chromebook over a real laptop at this price, ever.
for what is the storage if you cant download movies on it or use with applikations like Android. there are some Android Apps that support RAW files example LR or PS.
Why does a Chromebook need an i7? Who would spend $1600 on a Chromebook?
One thing that people fail to notice is the longevity of these things. Yes they are not as productive as Windows or Mac, but they will easily last you for 7+ years without stuttering on what they do.
Don’t understand why you wouldn’t compare it to the existing laptop books on the market. Also the pricing is a bit extreme, you can get an XPS, Surface Pro, our MacBook for close to the same price.
Does the Chromebook support Photoshop the same as Windows ?
google and its bezels.....
Biased ... why is he not mentioning the damn screen, and mos def the humongous bezel!
if it only was run by Win10.....
now I can play cool math games at 144 fps
Google Pixelbook first look.. good
Preview wonderful
Me love this gargle fixal stuff
Overpriced laptop with unusable OS.
Song @2:15 please?
B E Z E L S
Omfg hungry truly    looks  deeply way-ryx reserve
Ugly
Surface is the best.\n      The end
How is this different from Lenovo Yoga series!!??
even this has that stupid two-tone design with the glass half above, ugh
Seriously, who wants a touchscreen on their laptops? I will never get it, screen wobbles, it gets fingerprint smudges in no time, and you'll always be more precise with a mouse anyway.
There's a million people in the comment section going what is the point of this? Well, I'm currently using a laptop with Ubuntu, and 90% of the time I'm in a web browser. This machine can run a real Ubuntu installation via Crouton, can run Android apps, can be used like a tablet and has a true stylus for drawing/notetaking. I was looking into a Dell XPS 13 and a tablet, but this + Pixel Pen actually does more than either, costs slightly less and looks fantastic. This is basically the Compaq TC1100 done right.
To all the people confused by this product, I think it's an obvious competitor to the Microsoft Surface Laptop. It's at the same price, but the pixelbook has better specs. The surface laptop has the gimped Windows 10 S which limits you to only being able to use apps from the Windows store, giving it pretty much the same functionality as Chrome OS.
Pixelbook without Internet = a piece of expensive metal
Comon \nthis thing is hideous
I have met Emre before! No noke. I went to Liverpool v Arsenal 4. March 2017. The day after I took a train from Liverpool to London. I met him on the train, he's a really Nice guy btw!
Do one with Coutinho. I like this series as release a new hip hop quiz with Sturridge, Gomez and Ox. It'll be funny.
Picking most from Bayern doesn't mean he's leaving for Bayern.Stop the stupid rumors.
Make him sign the contract and do not let him leave the room. Lol
He's just being honest. He named most Bayern players because he used to play with them and even know them in person. Indeed Bayern Munich is top 5 team in Europe so it all make sense.
literally just a bayern team
In other words- Bayern
Let him go dony need him i always sell him on fifa and get loen..saul ... kimmch or renato
This guy is a former Bayern player. It's no surprise that half of the team are Bayern players
Yes,we are living in Ronaldo & Messi era.We must be proud of it.
And he's leaving in the summer ... Total shame to the board if he leaves
he want to bayern :) bitch
Algum brasileiro q gosta do Liverpool e assiste esse canal?
Not biased at all.
RB Philip lahm yes great banta can 😀😀😀😂😂😂 nah but being serious it will be bad to see him leave he seems so nice 👍
Jurgen is going to Bayern so is Emre Can.
Choses an ex Liverpool player and a player who wants to leave Liverpool great side🤣🤣🤣
To many Bayern players in my opinion
he just want is bayern move to be done soon
I thought this was Emre Can's dream team not the bayern starting XI
Can your one of my favourite midfielder
He has chosen players from four clubs only, namely:\n1) Bayern\n2) Liverpool\n3) Barcelona\n4) Real Madrid\nAre those his favorite clubs?
Bro he should just said Bayern
Mignolet no goals in should surely be ahead of Neuer.
liverpool have to buy carlos lampe, bolivia goalkeeper
Looks like Emre is pushing for a move to Munich 😂😂😂
shame on defender lfc
Mostly FC Bayern players!
So all bayern munich players are in his dream team and his Liverpool teammates. I can understand GK position and forward but all other guys 😧😧😧
Coutinho the best
Steven Gerrard forever
https://youtu.be/Z5fEVzpNzcs
*Emre Can selects the Bayern Munich XI
maybe a move to bayern?
People complain about Emre choosing so many Bayern players, but keep in mind, they are all some of the best in the world in their respective positions. I totally understand him.
Just gonna take a wild guess here, he wants a bayern move?
Damn. That's a good team.
This shows can have his heart on Bayern m
Frank could have been better but still good
So basically, Emre Can is joining Bayern Munich for free in the summer.
Stop making him to videos and make him sign the contract lol
Half of the players are from Bayern Munich
That would be a beast team, and suits, the big beast himself emre
He just picked all the best players
Hope he signs new contract
That is one hell of an awesome midfield Emre, glad to see you know what you're talking about.
this is just a German/Bayern hybrid
Please sign a new contract Emre!!!
KLAVAN is god. One of the best defenders in the world. He’s strong powerful great tackle. He is a proper leader and legend
Although it's mostly bayern players n players he play with it's a pretty good team☺
Stevie G providing to Ron and Messi...just imagine 😍😍
Sounds like he wants to come back to Bayern
when did he play with ramos?
I think he likes Bayern
I love you ❤️ can \nOne of the best players in the premier league
Never mind who he picks, sign a contract and focus on the games.
I'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm…
He would like to sign for Bayern??
Lowkey emre wants to be in bayern again
Does Can just love Bayern, or does he just love Bayern. I think he just loves Bayern.
OK, Ronaldo's good and all, but Danny Ings??!!?!
Funny how most of the the team is munich
*Emre Can chooses his all-time eleven from the stars he's played with or against, for club and country.* , please read the description before talking trash.
No lovren or matip?? Really??
Too many bayern plyr
Bayern Munich!
No Toni Kroos?
Where is ox
Sign new contract!
Clearly can is a Munich fan
I think Emre is eyeing a move to Bayern....
Title is misleading, It should be Emre Can's favourite Bayern Players and some other players as well. 😂
Where's Rickie Lambert?
Too many Bayern
Sign the fucking contract.
Emre can 😳
No lord bendtner 😥😥😥🙄
Go play for Bayern jeez
Wie er Bayern in den Arsch kriecht.
To many Bayern Players

Umm... if it makes you happy and you’re not hurting anyone... sure... go for it 😁
Well... that's enough internet for today...  what he needs is a psychologist.  Apple juice looks like urine
Being a baby won't pay the bills
mother's love your children, so they won't grow down instead of up 😐
Where does he got his money? Why is the momy wearing such clothes? Does the momy change his diapers too? Where do babies come from? Why do chickens cross the road? So many questions. :D
*As long as he is happy, who are we to judge???* some people are severely depressed for a lot of things they wish to happen, just let him do his thing.
Meet the world's biggest virgin
Wow\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the ladies must be after him
Oh no boy I know you not dead ass.
C r i n g e
2yr olds don't eat baby food & open up for fucking airplanes..
I can understand this.....a woman who truly feels and thinks she's a cat........now that is just weird. Wanting to be a baby and having that mommy protection bond I get.
Fucking role-players always fucking being weird and shit
He looks likes a Dr. Seuss character
He has never had love
Lol i dont know what his decided but if this real i think he must check to the doctor!
How did i get here lol
ILL FREAKING DO THIS ONE DAY
Well I mean, who doesn't like toddler food? That mushed apple sauce is the best
I find this disturbing. 😳
The cat under the high chair wants to kill himself lmfao
This guy doesn't have any mental issues at all
To be honest baby's are not that fat
Funny you all were supporting that girl sucking pacier all day but not this?! Samething! But hopefully he does not to it in public! lol
Does he have a job?🤔
I'm trying to watch asmr n fall asleep but instead I ended up here 🤔🤔🤔🤔
This is the most foolish thing that I have ever seen in my life.
I've seen many like this, very common in the Caucasoid race. This is why we Asians are superior.
This gu6s is embarrassing like for real tho
When that lady came in I was like this gotta be a porno😂
Lol he goes to sleep when the suns still out
The world always finds a way to amaze me😊
Yo....\n\n\n\n\nWhat the fuck
Imagine someone breaking into his house and leaving after seeing this shit.
I think this is adorable.
are we sure this guy isn't just a typical liberal?
Child molestors in a whole new level
Tbh That crib looks so comfortable and I would probably sleep in it
Came to weird part of YouTube again
Imagine if someone broke into his house in the middle of the night imagine the robbers reaction they would be like wtf 😂
The idea of living the baby life I never had sounds like fun, I find the baby POV calming.
Fuck this mother fucker ,,, kill him before it lay eggs
To be honest I don't really think is disturbing but yes it's weird be he said he had a hard child hood so I think he just trying to fill that hole in this life
Why the hell man you are not going to get a girlfriend doing that shit so stop
How do you do your job?
I would love that crib though !!
Sometimes I cry about how bad my life is but then I watch these videos and realize I could have it much worse.
What in the weirdo hell is this??
3 words What The Fuck
This is fake right 😆
Ahhhh hell yeah!\nI want to do that shit\nJust doing nothing\nI wish...
This fat fuck eating baby food in his fucking high chair. Can't wait for the cops bust his ass
where's his real mom at ?
I’m open to many things....but this is just mental...this isn’t normal....ew😳 Someone needs a GF...or BF...
so what?! he wanna be that way we let him be that way everyone has there own preference of lifestyle  and it doesn't hurt us if he wanna be that way   I support him he may be weird but that's just who he is and wanna be   let him live his life  thank u

Slay him, use his meat for sustenance and take his money.
He ain’t never gonna get some pussy
the Girl that babysits him reminds me of Brazzers
This guy just wasted 7 min of my life
I wanna live as an adult baby 😥
I bet he is popular with the ladies
When u try to reverse time and go back to a child so u won't have to pay bills and buy food outta yo own pockets😂👍

Just got back from visiting the UK: I got C+D cupcakes, they were sooo good!
Everybody's good at cooking something and I'm good at cooking crumble \n\nI've got one in the oven would you like some?
I love your videosssssss>>>>
Blackberry icing sounds amazing! Need to make it!
juicy little fillas
Tasty
Loving this recipe! X
To all continental Europeans who can't get treacle: I like to use sirop de Liège (boiled down fruit juice, dates, apples and pears I think) or really dark brown muscovado sugar or dates soaked in water and blended up. If someone has another idea, please tell me! \nPs: Golden Syrup is Grafschafter Goldsaft to my fellow Germans :)
Planing to make ur AMAZING Oreo cupcakes

Hello, can anyone help me pls! How shud I store cupcakes (for a party) after baking and frosting them if I live in a tropical country? Thanks!
Your videos always make me hungry...no matter what time it is hahaha xx
This cupcake decoration is gorgeous and the cupcake sponge is really awesome
IM NEVER THIS EARLY CAN I GET LIKES NOW?!!?😮\n\n\nno.😑\n\n(I'm kidding... this never happens and i need dem likes guys😕)
Why the hell is Jemma so underrated
I am going to have a go of making the Apple & Blackberry Cupcakes they look lovely .
What about the blackberry goo? You did not use it at the end
These look incredible, and so tasty. I love to bake and this video gave me loads of cool ideas for where flavor can be infused, but theses are so fiddly. This why bakeries like yours exist! Happy to buy these from pros like you, lol.
you looked so sexy when you are baking something
Omg 😍😍😍 I need these in my life
In the southeastern US blackberries are ripe in late June-early July.
I love your shows
Hi jemma im going to visit your shop tomorrow in london. Im soo excited!😍 Gonna buy some cakes
Hi Jemma could please do a video on how to make macron's or if you've already made it please send a link
Lovely recipe Jemma. Cannot wait to try it. Looking forward to your video next week!
Thanks so much - now I know what I will bake at christmas for my family. Better start practising :D I I love your videos. Really happy I found you when this channel started. Ist still the best cupcake-channel out there :)
Can I use raisins instead of BlackBerry
You're everything right with YouTube.
I thought treacle and molasses were the same thing?
They look delicious and right up my alley.
I was just craving for some apple crumble!
Does your mixer have light on it?! Oh my goodness..I need that!
Jemma has sacrificed her thumb to the baking gods! This means we will have good bakes for a brief moment until the next sacrifice by someone else!
OMG those are gorgeous and I bet they taste AMAZING. Totally want to make these!!
Looks yummy! Owww on the thumb--I'm always grating my fingertips, so I know how you feel. I have to try putting apple and blackberry together--don't know why it never occurred to me before.
Hello how would you make that recipe in to vegan
Think this one will be as popular in our house as the jammy dodger one, fruit crumble cupcakes winner winner. Thank You Jemma.
Hi Jemma! Thanks for all your videos, they're great inspiration for me. I wanted to ask you whether you could do a basics series. That would be awesome. Thanks again.
These look so yummy! And the potato ricer trick is inspired!
I think that the quality of the video is not as good as before
You know she's a pro because her mixer has a ring light
Poor thumb! \nI feel a little better about slicing my hand with a French mandolin now. Not by much because it hurt like a mother. But a little.
Hi Jemma! I am a huge fan, I recently started a small baking business and you are an inspiration. I am always surprised by your flavor combinations and I have tried dozens of your recipes, they always turn out splendidly! Thank you!
These look yummy! I've never mixed apples and blackberries before so I will definitely give it a go..\nBut I have a question: instead of apple, could I use raspberries or other berries for this recipe or do they have to much water? I'm a little worried that I would squeeze out all the flavour (I hope it makes sense because I'm not that good in English)
Is there an American alternative for golden syrup that isn't corn syrup?
good job need to try someday
hi jemma I like apple and i love your cupcake
I love love love this yesss, so beautiful and I bet it taste AMAZING. never thought about blackberries and apples!
Gemma cupcake do you have any recipe with fresh pomegranate or maybe custard apples please
I'm having a shitty day, Jemma. Hearing your voice and watching you bake brings me joy. Thanks for being you.
What a brilliant idea to use a potato ricer!
I love your top! Where is it from?
these videos get me through the week !! thanks jemma for your baking creativity and expertise ♡☆
JEMMA THIS IS TRENDING IM SHOOK. also this look so so so yum
I won’t lie, a ring light on the arm of a stand mixer seems like the most extra, ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen, that’s probably a huge improvement on user friendliness.
Can someone convert the ingredients for me in US metrics?:)
I love your straight forward approach and quick format!  Keep on baking!
Hey Jemma, love your vids. I know you love using tea infusions. Please try using Rooibos tea. South African product, it's life changing.
(Silently cursing why I live 1 continent away from C&D).. This looks sooo amazing, I want 1 RIGHT NOW!!
My favourite dessert in cupcake form! 😱 x
Hey Jemma.  How do you stop all the fruit sinking to the bottom
Hey jemma, you didn't state the quantity of flour in your cupcakes in the description box.
I visited your shop on Saturday, and I was so happy to see all the cupcakes! Thanks so much for such a great experience😘
Can't hear Black Treacle without thinking of the Arctic Monkeys. Such a good song. I love apple anything, I'm excited to make these!!
Yes!!! You're back!!!
Gemma!!!! Please make an amazing coffee cupcake!!!! I beg you!!!!!!
hi Jemma i just wanna ask if you can also feature on how to make a french macarons..=)
It took me longer than i care to admit, to realise that it wasn't a siren that was going off in every video, it was Jemma opening the oven!
Yum! The compote filling is such a lovely addition.
Do you think this recipe could work with peaches and blueberries?
That’s looking delicious! Will give it a try👍🏻
Did anyone else think the pink buttercream looked like ham?
Hi , if I don't have a potato riser what can I use or do? Thanks
Jemma I heard recently that you don’t do apple picking in the uk, and I am devastated for you. But.. do you have apple cider donuts? Because that’s the best part of apple picking, the apple cider donuts. \nWhat I’m saying is you should make a video on apple cider donuts. 😊
Why on earth would a person (2 people) dislike this vid?
I reckon it would be a great cupcake Jemma but too much work for me. I might make the cakes and ice them with a caramel buttercream ( your recipe of course). I love your channel. And your carrot cake is THE BEST.
Omg yummmmm!!! I never would have thought of that combo with the apple and blackberries 😲💯😍👐👏🎉
Hello Jemma. I am big fan of C&D and watching your videos for very long time! Can I ask you, why are you using for making buttercream paddle attachment instead of the whisk attachment? Just curious😉great recipe btw!!!❤❤❤💦
Hi Jemma, how do you find the Kenwood mixer compared to the Kitchen aid?
How could I make this vegan?

This song is more Beach Boys than Beach Boys
I LOVE THIS TRACK!
Suddenly the sounds of the 60s bump my mind because of the tune of this song <3.
This song gets better with every listen. Can't get enough of it.
Sounds like a generic Gin Blossoms song from the mid 90's
Been listening to this song on repeat while I'm studying.
Argentina is still waiting for Weezer!! =w=
I stopped listening since after Maladroit... I think I might listen again :)
Judging by that bridge, this is the song that should have been called Beach Boys.
where's my hash pipe?
really love the new songs
Oh God this is my favorite off the album so far!!
Oh wow burning sun done over. Good song. This album has a nice rhythmic sound.
Much, much better than the previous 3 singles. Still scared for this album.
Wonderful verse, weak chorus and OK bridge.  6/10   I'd rather listen to the Green demo than this unfortunately.
This has a modern yet classic 60s pop sound. Between this and Weezer's recent use of the 50s chord progression in Go Away and Endless Bummer, they are bringing back great things. This really reminds me of Weezer combined with The Monkees new song She Makes Me Laugh (written by Rivers, of course.) Buying the new album at release.
Weezer is probably my favorite active band. I've really liked the past 2 albums and the first 2 releases from the new album are good just not as good as most of their past work. This song however sucks.
Best single they've released for the new album by far
this is actually good
Really good. I'm enjoying the change, especially from the White album.
Must be a big album
Not a bad track... the more I think about one of my top 10 Weezer tracks, “Eulogy for a Rock Band,” the more I think it’s about them and leaving rock music behind 😢
Melody sounds like it was lifted from an earlier B-side called Burning Sun.
I'm a Weezer fan..went on first Weezer cruise..this song is pretty lame..most of the recent releases have been lyrically pretty crappy..almost like Rivers lost his edge for writing good pop singles. The alliteration is great.
what a good song
he sounds like the dude that sang rude
still stucky in my head
Not 1 single mention of Mary Tyler Moore. Disappointed
sorry, but in my opinion this is not good...
I swear, when I first saw the title, I thought it was showing Wonder Woman, anyways, great song!
This is a really good song!
This video made me fart.
thought I was looking at the ocean man album cover from a distance
Best single so far.
This is the only song I like off Pacific Daydream but still lower the Pop taste just a but please.
is weezer going to hit the trifecta of 3 good albums in a row...\nman i dunno if i'm ready for this
The melody/harmonies and the arrangements are just beautiful <3
These new songs aren't bad. Not my jam though. This one is actually really good compared to the others though.
Use more vocal melodies and songs Rivers wrote from the 90s and we'll talk.
Best single from this album so far imo
For me this makes 4 great summer jams on this album so far. Very happy with how this is turning out.
Nice one!  \nSpecialy when this began: I still believe your beautiful lies
yes, if you're trying to figure out that youtube is an algorithm based on previous video views and snapshots of thumbnails, yes, it is true.
I feel like nobody brings up how creative these lyric videos are!
Much better than burning sun imo, this takes everything good from burning sun and enhances it, burning sun has the same problem that all Green songs have (i critique green for being solid but extremely safe and the songs follow a generic and identical formula)
Best song you guys have released so far! Love it!
dig the song! here's a brief write-up I did about it https://zumic.com/weekend-woman-weezer-youtube-audio-single
Finally, a good song. This is what I was hoping the whole album will be like. Here's hoping that everything we haven't heard so far is like this too.
My new second favorite song first is only in dreams
Amazing to think that Rivers has been holding onto a melody this good for so long, unable to finish it until now. And now we've ended up with one of the absolute best modern Weezer tracks, with new lyrics and an incredible arrangement. I'm glad it's finally finished and out there, because this song is excellent.
Finally we got a good one
I miss Weezer so much. Will they ever come back, or is fluffy beach stuff all they're going to churn out now?
*My personal rankings so far*\n1. Feels Like Summer\n2. Mexican Fender\n3. Weekend Woman\n4. Beach Boys
O c t o b e r 2 7 t h
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
New Weezer, Liam and Noel Gallagher album! What a time to be aline 💕
Sounds very 80s prom to me lol
Oh yes this is amazing
good one.
The bridge gives me chills =w=
Genius
I love it! <3
2 3 la rola
los amo, hijosdeputa!
stop
meh
Always late
weezer manda mtoooo!!!!
Is gud
Thats a tune!
The Shins sound great!
4.07 minutes of happiness
Burning sun anyone?? B sides little bitches.
Weezer is one of the best bands ever, with some of the worst fans ever.  So negative, always picking apart every note of every song, forever comparing everything they do to Blue or Pinkerton.  Where's the loyalty?  Where's the love?  Honestly, the worst Weezer song is better than nearly every song that gets played on the radio.  Stop complaining and give Weezer the credit they deserve.
love weezer always
Booo make weezer suck again!
no
Damn.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Good job, Weezer!
Burning Sun from Green Era almost exaclty.
Good
<3
This is Burning Sun remade, cool
Burning SUN!!!!!
Awesome.
When did Weezer become another lifeless pop act?
Even the B sides off the white album are better than this. Missing the rock sound.
At least he doesn't do that awful rap-singing thing in this song
1 for 4 is acceptable enough in baseball I guess
Why do I keep checking if weezer has found that good sound again from the 90s/first two albums? I need to let go.
Sigh. More overproduced pop rock from a beloved band with which I grew up. What happened? No band will always remain the same, but WHAT IS THIS?!? Where is the authenticity of Pinkerton? Where are the harder riffs?
Wish there was just more fuzzy guitars and less church bells and reverb. 🙄
More and more bullshit. Just retired already Weezer, you haven't had a decent album in 11 years!
SOUNDS LIKE BURNING SUN!
is the Black Album, Pacific Daydream? Or is this just a separate Album?
This is a great Weez tune. Has a White vibe and Green vibe. Ranking high on my Weezer overplay list. The previous 3 were flimsy. This one's strong. 
Good

satan the devil will be glad that you are impersonating the dead

Your face lost 10 pounds with that contour
Not the type of drugstore I meant
You make it look so easy 😍
Love this ur such a talented makeup artist I just love ur videos Jamie n ur such a beautifull person inside n out ;) xxx
Rimmel London has SO many cool products out, just not available to us in the US. I wanna try so many things, the main one being the Contour Stick! I seriously have been thinking about saying fuck it & ordering it from Amazon bc I honestly don't think it will EVER be available in the US!
‘ just because we’re dead doesn’t mean we can’t highlight ‘ 😂😭💅
Just cause we dead doesn't mean we can't highlight 😂☠
seriously you make black shadow contour look good. \nalso. i live for the weeeeeeeeee when you zoom in. \nperf.
Such a good make up artist love all your looks!
Hey Jamie!! Just bought some Zoeva brushes and I would love for you to make a video of how you clean your brushes. I don't want to ruin mine so it would be great if you show us how you do it!! :*
You are just the cutest!!! loved the looks
Loved his video! Defo scary but glam at the same time
You're accent is fucking E V E R Y T H I N G. UGGGH MAWMA 😍😍
honestly when i die the highlighting trend is going to be something that people look back and cringe at (lookin at you overplucked brows) but im gonna demand in my will that they highlight me to the gods bc just because we dead doesnt mean we cant highlight
Celebrate death. Dumb people buy products to help the zionists
Love it!  Love everything about it!! 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
Thank you so much for simplifying this and making it actually seem doable! 😊
Such a cool look
Simple but absolutely incredible!! I'm doing this for Halloween!! loooooove!!!
This was amazing!!!! So good! You should do an actual day to night makeup look. Like how you'd fix up your foundation/concealer and everything too! That would be great to see!
You're gorgeous and have stunning eyes! Quite frankly, you make me sick! Lol! Kidding. You really are very beautiful, though. :)
Keep doing what you are doing!  Love it! Mmm....

How to make your fat face look slim
Do they get mad when you call their products the wrong thing?
I only just noticed how pretty your eye colour is 😍
Basic. Everyone has done this already. Next.
I think u will get more subs if u talk less and make for talk throughs and speed up the video when u edit.😁
Now this is how you fucking make a trailer
The first german series on netflix. Lets see ....
Woah this looks visually stunning!
I wish this was just a trailer for an episode of new season of black mirror
damn son. please find some nasty asian movie, those are hardcore too.
Yo. Netflix gets a standing O from me. They are killing the movie market.
Nope, too late at night for this, Netflix. I'll come back in 10 hours.
I pressed like before I even watched the video
fun for all the family.
So, is this produced in English or will this be subtitled?
Its giving me black mirror and the returned kind of vibes don’t know why though
Can't wait to watch both Dark and Bright on Netflix!
Okay you have my attention.
It looks like Saw 😱
Yeah my birth day........... does that say something
sold. I'll have to read this with subtitles
Anything with time travel, I'm in.
Netflix has a lot of horror films coming out this month and I'm excited for all of them
Okay, you have my attention.
What If Doc Brown was a Weeping Angel?\nSOLD!
Now this looks interesting.
Could be the next stranger things or it could be shit I'm gonna give it a chance
I've been waiting for this for quite sometime now
The question is is math related to science
something that stephen king would write
This looks epic; is it in English tho?
DERK
An article called it 'noir', i'm in!
Now this is interesting! I love mystery kind of movies/show so yeah
Ok 1953, 1986 and 2019 - there's a pattern here, a 33 year gap between these dates. This definitely means something, maybe these timelines are running parallel to each other?
Like it If you are also watching this video in 2036.
As a person who loves shows like Stranger Things, I still don't see the resemblance and it feels more like IT (and just a tiny bit of Riverdale) to me to be honest...
So kids go missing\nWith Netflix that means only one thing,\nThey're trapped in the Upside Down!
This reminds me of a book I've read Black River by T.J. MacGregor which the antagonist kidnaps children from different timelines.
That looks like some good shit right there. Good shit. Right there right there If I do say so myself and I say so
OK, guys, before the movie is released on Dec. 1, guess the answer to the question: When?
When has kidnapped the children?
I'm pretty sure the question of who kidnapped the kids is gonna come up a few times, and be important to the plot.
Love the use of typography!
I'VE BEEN WAITING A YEAR SINCE THE FIRST TRSILER I'M SO EXICTED
Es geschah am hellichten Tag, ich bin mal gespannt. (I'm curious.)
So intense.
mal ne deutsche netflix produktion
twin peaks vibes
Uumm, yea...
Fucking Pennywise.
Dammit! Another Adam Sandler movie...🤔
Netflix is straight ass
This is fucking good damnnn
You got my attention!
Um, what?
This looks sick!
Stranger Things + time travel
se ve genial aaaa
Can't wait !!!!
December 1
Fuck yes
Gosh darnit Netflix I can't take your awesomeness any more!
FUCK YES
Wunderbar!
JOLLY TIMES

ZZZZZZZZ
German Broadchurch? Yes please.

FNGHD DGTD BD
This looks interesting
interestinggggggg
Jigsaw reborn...😁😁😁
Oeh Nice
Stranger things + It
Mixture of The OA and Stranger Things
This looks happy and delightful
seems good
I am ready!!!
Are they implying a ginger gone missing is a bad thing?? 🤔😬🤐
Getting Twin Peaks vibes from this.
Netflix movies usually look the same for me. I hope they stop making such movies or use a different editor at least.
Looks Finchery im game!
Can people not compare every supernatural show to Stranger Things. It was alright but definitely overrated
Is this going to be in English?
Netflix I have an idea for a great show it could bring you more subscribers but nothing is free so wassup
Really? First, a move called Bright. Now, we have Dark. Can they film Dim?
When you really want to empathize that you're show is DARK
Movie or series?
The question is not donde esta la biblioteca...
Hey Netflix.  Have you heard of an indie game called Inside by Playdead?  If you haven't, you should go check it out, and make a series off of that.
Stranger Things 1.1
stränger zings or ït
Song??
Anybody know the song at 0:34?
is this a german production?
I don't get it..
congratulations Netflix on another piece of shit
Wow Stranger Things season 2 looks great!
Netflix, why you're doing this to me? Too many great shows, i can't keep up , my older cousins can't stop talking how their 90's childhood were better compare to mine , Niggas please,  you didn't have netflix back then
anyone knows the German song ?? the one at the end
I love how she said “I didn’t see anyone wearing eyeshadow” but she put so many different shades and even did the lower 😂
French
Those cheekbones though\nOn fleeeck
Do amaricain vs dutch and americain vs sweden
MY NAME IS DOMINIQUE OMG 😂😛
15:54 you look like miranda kerr omg
French side awesome!!!!!!
French❤️
french makeup is gorgeous
Ow la la! Love this vid
Natural beautiful woman
french side forsure looks beautiful
your are gorggggg!!!!!!!!
Her makeup vids are AMAZING 💖💖
Love it 😍
do american vs Arabic
i loveeee her eye color
My two moods
America
Please do American vs Spanish makeup❤
French all the way!!! you look so beautiful
I can tell you as a French girl we don’t do that much! 😅 the product that we use most of the time is mascara, correcteur and lipstick and some times blush. We don’t really tack to much time for our makeup. It’s simple and  we just want to look fresh and a bit more awake! But no eyeshadow don’t have time for that! 😂 we were more makeup for an event or a party but never to much!
I would say do Australia vs America but literally everything beauty or makeup related is the same.
Can you do another French tutorial but whole face?  I love the French style!  Hello from NZ!
Would love it if you checked out my new video, I did a full face first impressions! Feedback is lovely and helps me grow!!! Love youuu💜💜💜
DO A MEXICO TUTORIAL
OMG i like the french style!!!!
The French side is soooo pretty
Why did I just find your channel. Amazing
I prefer the french 😊
i prefer the french side
The french do their makeup very natural. Most don't wear makeup aside from lipstick and the men don't like moisturizer because they think it feels weird on the skin. I think I prefer the French makeup look to be honest because I'm so use to seeing girls being over dramatic with their makeup. I think their skin is really even because their very pale in complexion. Similarly to dark skin blacks that have even skin because their skin is dark. Unfortunately my skin is more on the light brown side so blemishes show up and redness as well as discoloration from the sun.
French side looks so natural and stunnning!!!!!!
Most French people don't do they're make up like that but it's cute
super curious to what the peeps from france actually think about this, like if it's accurate or not
The French side is so much prettier ✋🏼
This is my first time watching your video, and I can’t kept but thinking your voice sounds just like Jenn frmheadtotoe lol \n\nAnyway, love both looks! New subbie! ☺️
I LOVE THIS! \nI practically do the ‘French’ side every day and when I go out my makeup usually will look like the ‘American’ side. 🖤
Love the red lips b ❤️
Lol i do the French side on the daily.. 😊 except i actually use medium coverage foundation ..
This is the first video I've seen from you and of you ..loved it
I am an American and I do not wear my make up like you are wearing on your face as the American way. I don’t color my eyebrows. I don’t wear false eyelashes. I don’t wear heavy eyeliner, I don’t wear heavy eyeshadow. My daughter and my sisters don’t wear theirs like you say Americans do. We are Americans.
Oh wow, watching this made me realize I’ve been doing it the French way this whole time. Didn’t even know.
to me the French style makeup looks more subtle and soft and natural. i prefer that makeup rather than American side
I love the french side
I love the French makeup! It seems so simple yet so elegant! I am so using the French makeup side as my morning makeup routine! I won't have to worry if my winged eyeliner matches on both eyes, no more shaping my face a lot with contour and highlight, and hello! Who doesn't love a bold lipstick color??!!! I love it so much! I've always had a hard time appreciating how I look and i feel like if I use the natural look everyday, i will feel like my old self again. I'll feel like me again!
You look like the actress who plays Jo on greys anatomy. 😊
If you cover the american side and you look at the french side only she looks like Lucy Hale!!!
Apparently I belong in France
On the french side, I think the red lipstick needs to look more lived in.
Oh we don't like kylie.
I am part French and it's funny that I unknowingly have been doing my makeup naturally French style.
I LOVE the French side ughhh it's so beautiful and I'm obsessed with ur eye color💓
DO A FRENCH FULL FACE !!! WITH TIPS PLSSSSS! We need more of that and you nailed it!
I love. love. Love. the French side. Very classy. Natural. Simple.... Everything I strive for. 😂
I feel like the only place I've seen looks similar to the American side is on social media. I don't think I know a single girl/woman who wears makeup like that all the time. I'm from the Midwest so maybe it's different in big cities near the coasts but idk
i looooove the french side! inspired to try that out for myself
Legit it’s like Kylie vs Kendall 😭😂😂😂
The french one is prettier.. love it
The french side is 💘
awesome video 😍, \nits like the left American one is Maybelline kinda makeup n right one is L'Oréal kinda makeup 😁, that's what I thought 😁,
honestly, I've never seen your videos until now, but when i saw this video, you just.. I don't even know. You are so strikingly beautiful and I hope you know.
Americans just wear soooooooo much makeup that it takes away from everything, while in the rest of the world makeup is more enhanced
That “french” look on you 😻 omg wear it everyday
Very interested in seeing your line. I think out of all of them I'd probably buy a palette from you. I've purchased other lines that have highlighters and lip products, but I haven't bought a palette with the exception of graveyard girl which was really a collab and not her own line.
I think the American side should be Americans under 21 look. Very Kylie-esque. Definitely prefer the French look lol
the French side looks so beautiful. I don't understand the hype around the American style, I just can't get behind it
Loving the french side!
Not extremely accurate as everyone, regardless of where you are, wears makeup differently. I am half Korean and my Korean cousins wear a lot of makeup. More than this American one. This is just what you see on instagram.
Livingggg for the French side
loved the french side
To anyone who wears “lighter” makeup, what’s your favorite foundation/cream to use?
I like the American side because I'm really bored with the French makeup style. It's always the same!
I looove the french side
U look like a prettier version of Katy Perry ( and with brown eyes)
Omg I loved the French side (being a French Canadian myself lol) and I have been looking for a look that is natural and healthy  and you have brought that. would you be able to do a full French makeup tutorial because I L O V E IT
I prefer her with less makeup. She’s pretty she doesn’t need much.
She talks a lot... no hate
French side is gorgeous...because you're naturally gorgeous.
Omg you're KILLING the French
I don't even know what you did after the eyes. I can't go pass that because your eyes is MESMERIZING! damn!
This is so cool!
love the French side!
I love the French side! Specially your 'French brow'. Keep going, you're beautiful!
Does she know the quad is in the leg? Cause she flexed her arm 😂
What a coincidence that u and Laura are releasing makeup lines near each other... no shade but shade.. #teamchristen
I'm deffo into the French style I've always liked enhancing but not changing n completely covering how I look like. But obviously you look so gorgeous in both ways😍
I wish I could go see you!!! And it would be amazing if we could hang out for a day and do makeup! But I know that wouldn't happen...😔❤️
From my opinion,I think she really likes the French side 🤗\nI'm French so I find it cuute and also my make-up is like that 😋
I like the French side! It’s more classy and posh
I don't like the US American side lol a few hours later I would look all cakey  and looking older.. Not fun.. America is a continent not a country ladies..
first video I watched from your channel. you look so kind! I love u already. and I vote for the French style. it's not complicated and it's natural.
I love the french with the american brows
I am an extra girl and do my makeup the American way but wow the French style is so beautiful and natural 💗
How old are you
Does anyone else’s brow wiz ALWAYS breaks? I’ve gone through many and the brush end always breaks off. I’m also gentle with it, so there’s no reason for it to break off.
I like both but my makeup is more of a French :)
The french side looks like Gal Gadot
She is so BEAUTIFUL
This is not french makeup 😂😂I'm french
Remember Steam users, please!
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.
I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
Is this an actual game or just a fun little animation?
*I have to play this, thank you for the video because this is the first time I have heard of it*
Where can I find the 13th heart?
See the gameplay of this in\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z4sjJJnFjy4

To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.
Is this gonna be a real game?
I need this in my life.
Its hard to search for it in the play store. I downloaded it after clicking links that directed me to it in the store. Uninstalled it because im werry of its access.
LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Less than 300 likes and 27 comments but it’s on trending?!?!??! \nOk YouTube
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
I wish they'd do a Stranger Things TellTale game instead
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13
where can I find it and bring it to the Nintendo switch
Interesting:)
YES
what's the name of the game called
Please be real.
Hi
Who else hit start.😁?
What a game!!👍

(6 new) Just hop on over to https://www.patreon.com/peterhollens and sign up for as little as $1 !!  LOVE YOU GUYS!! IM SO THRILLED THIS IS FINALLY OUT!!!! Let's get to 1000+ people next time!!
I'd love to see and hear more of you Christmas music, I wish a could sing but I'm horrible so I'm saving your ears for that. I do hope that next year, or when ever you can. Do you think you can do a cover of Christopher Cross's Ride Like the Wind? I really like that song, and I'd really love it if you can sing it. Please and Thank You. ;)
I'm so upset that I missed out on getting to be a part of this one.
Why was that lady doing sign language, it’s not like any dead people are gonna be subbed to a channel that does song covers 😂
Absolutely captured the feel of the original. Amazing, amazing work. The power of a mob.
Heck Yah!!! You finally did it! My favorite game of all time!!!!!! Omg this made me want to cry thank you so much Peter for your work
Omigosh it's in ASL too!  This is SO cool.
You look like a kid on Christmas at 2:14! This video gave me chills. It sounded so amazing!
Hauntingly beautiful, I wasn't familiar with it but now I'm so glad I found it. Still waiting for the video of Bohemian Rhapsody. And I would still like to request Who Wants To Live Forever(maybe another one with your patreon's?)
Peter Hollens can you please do Fear not this night from Guild wars 2 sometime I would love to hear it.
I love your ability to work with so many voices and highlight all the textures and tones. Such a beautiful mix of voices. Bravo Peter. Well done
Hey Peter! I am a HUMONGOUS fan of your work and you always give me goosebumps! Keep up the amazing work bro! Also, do you have an email that I can use to talk to you so I can get some questions answered? Like I said earlier, you are absolutely amazing, I love your work, and please try to keep the HUMONGO meet-up with you in the good ol' U.S. of A., ok bro! Also, if I can put in a song request, can you please either do Battle Scars by Lupe Fiasco and Guy Sebastian or 7 Years Old by Lukas Graham? Sorry I typed a lot, but I love your work and please try to do one of these two songs as I would be more than overjoyed! You're awesome! Thanks for still doing songs for the Hollens Family, and I think I speak for all of us when I say we love you, and keep up the good work!
cool this song came out on my birthday
This song sounds similar to the funeral song on Stargate Atlantis.  Would you look to cover it. Here's the link https://youtu.be/Fi7oNEDLGNY
That one girl doing sign language was awesome!
Great job! I didn't expect Dragon Age Inquisition.
This is absolutely amazing, congratulations to you and the patrons!
* sees this in sub box * \nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH I WAS JUST PLAYING INQUISITION I LOVE THIS GAME AND COVER SO MUCH AAAAAAHHHHHH GOOD JOB!
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS! OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH
DEAR EVAN HANSEN PLEASE
💩🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩
This is your best collaboration ever ! I just shiver all the video !
Wow Peter, amazing job once again, im kind of getting an eric Whtiacre vibe from this video. Beautifull!
I love this x
This gives me goosebumps all over :D
can you look into doing running home to you.  its a song sung by grant gustin on the flash tv show
OMGGGGG I LOVE THIS SONG. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE DRAGON AGE!!
This is one of my favorite collaborations that you've done
I loved this sooooo much! The whole thing gave me chills!
THIS IS SOOOOOOO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My best friend was in this video!!!!!!! It's an amazing amazing AMAZING thing, and I'm bummed I wasn't able to take part. Not enough money, not enough time, BAD AT SINGING. Still, I IMMENSELY enjoyed this. Keep it up!!!!!
Is there anyone else who would of found it funny if they had done your song
So amazing! I’m in awe! Beautiful to all to who did this!
Was the Dragon from game of thrones?
This came out so amazing! I am so thankful to be able to say that I was a part of this!
And it came out on my birthday! Best birthday present ever! 😆
WOW!!!  This gave me chills and almost brought me to tears. I love this song so much, and this rendition was so powerful. I really needed this today, I feel uplifted during a stressful time. Beautiful work Peter and EVERYONE involved!!
This is one of my favorite games! The song is so mesmerizing in game, I'm so glad you captured it's essence! Well done!
I'm going to have to check this game out now xD SO EPIC, Peter!! Si fantastique!!\n\nOh! And I didn't even notice the sign language the first time through. Very cool.
i got a question is there a good Acapella tutorial channel out there ? :)for those who want to make acapellas them self
Is that Avi Kaplan holding that bass line? So beautiful.
Hey....... how about a Dear Evan Hansen medley??
Since you did a virtual choir I think you should do an Eric Whitacre song.
Beautiful. I'm glad you are able to do what you love. And you have great enthusiasm.
Can you do Confrontation from Jekyll and Hyde?
Nobody expects the \n*D R A G O N A G E* Inquisition
*is singing along and wishing I had monies*
I can't believe you have so few subscribers!! You deserve more!!!
This song really reminds me of Teyla’s song from SG:A. Ah, the memories... :)
This is so amazing! I love this song in DA. Peter, you're so awesome! Thank you for being so interactive with your fans and supporting your fans' voices as well.
I like this! All the singers sings so beautifully. Great work on this, Peter.
This was amazing!!! I react to this video on my channel: https://youtu.be/IGUzHHlzU2g\nThank you so much  to Peter Hollens for this incredible, incredible opportunity!
It turned out so beautifully Peter! A relevant and timely reminder in times like these.
BEST GAMING SONG EVER!!!\nAlso I have a song request could you do Sweet Victory by David Eisley & Bob Kulick
I've never heard the song before and now I'm so into it\nWHAT A BRILLIANT JOB PETER AND ALL 500+ OF YOU WHO PARTICIPATED,WHAT A SPECTACLE!!!!
Fabulous sound and loved the deaf people signing the song as well
Would love to hear you sing flower of Scotland
Please do some more of the Dragon Age Inquisition songs!!
Of course everyone sounds so much better than me in the shower. :3 💖
Yes!!!! I've been waiting for this to happen!!
I love this! It is truly amazing!
I'm amazed by not only the talent of these awesome fans, but also by the concept of this video and how it turned out! Kudos to everybody who got to participate in this! :D
I'm gonna cry, I can't believe you did this song! Thank you so much!
still waiting for an lilo and stitch song
Ugh.. why did this make me cry... I didn’t cry while playing the game...
Any chance you'd do this with O Magnum Mysterium by Lauridsen? My favourite choir piece ever....
Right around the first minute of this video, I saw my sister singing this song.\nI was surprised, and greatly pleased with her effort.\nThanks Jen.
I love this, and all of your works and is a proud owner of last Christmas cd ❤💜❤
Yes, Peter! Keep doing this!!!
As a big fan of DA I must say... Great work. Keep it up Peter! :)
Woah...amazing. I was not prepared for this. Deep breath, and, replay.
I HAVE BEEN DYING FOR YOU TO SING THIS SONG. IT IS FROM MY FAVORITE GAME AND IT MADE ME TEAR UP. WONDERFUL JOB, PETER!! (And all those featured patrons! :) )
Turns on captions* Thanks Youtube, I didn't know there was music.
I'm curious as to how many of those who sang here have played the game ;p
I was sitting at my table drawing when this came up and started playing, i have listened to dozens of the songs sung by both you and your lovely wife. This was the first time i was brought to tears, its was absolutely beautiful thank you for everything you do.
Truly haunting, but beautiful. I adore this. I'm so sad I missed out on joining in because I was sick... Fingers crossed for next time! Let's make 1000!! :)
DANGIT!!!!!! If I'd have known what song it would have been, I'd have signed up for it.
omg this is incredible, I've already listened to this soooo much I love the song and inquisition is one of my favourites great job
peter you are so sweet
Hey Peter, could you do Rainbow by Sia please?
Amazing! You should do a PATD cover!😊👌👍

Dear even Hansen medley
How did you do in the test? Leave a comment!\n\nCouple weeks left to get this round of merch:\nhttp://merch.andrewhuang.com\n\nGIVEAWAY WINNERS!\nMoritz Mader\nPeter Choi\nLinus Würfel\nFélix Vandeneycken\nRida Shahdad\nJune Pilote\n\nFollow me here to catch the next giveaway:\nhttp://twitter.com/andrewhuang\nhttp://instagram.com/andrewismusic\nhttp://facebook.com/andrewismusic\n\nThanks for watching :)
Holy shit, i'm 15 and play I can only play sax and basic things on a piano and i got 6/6 easy.
I got everyone right. Surprised myself with that one.
Got them all right.
This is very easy- you can believe me or not but I think they are pretending like it's harder than it is. Or maybe it's just me.
I got them all and I’m not even a musician lmao
i got em all right yay
I got 100%
I got 6/6 😀😀😀
i got them all right yay im only a junior in highschool band in percussion no less so i barely even practice with winds and we have no official string section
It could be an electric guitar if it djented
I found this really easy but I'm sure my many hours using Sibelius helped a lot.
I got all of them right!
ROOMIE'S NAME IS JOEL????
YOOOOOOO I GOT THEM ALL RIGHT. I'm hella confused now. I thought this was really easy.
I got all right without like any problem? Is this supposed to be hard, feels so staged even though it most likely isn't, just because it was so easy for me.
6 out of 6, not too shabby
ROOMIE'S REAL NAME IS JOEL?
I managed to get all of them right!
Yeah this would've been way easier if it weren't shitty midi instruments.\nCrap test.
I got um all correct and I'm 12
oh my fucking god i got all of them right what does it mean???
I got all of them
TIP (for next time): if you number the instruments, and at the and tell the results it becomes easier for us watching to check if we got it right. ;) \nex: 1.cello, 2.piano, 3.trumpet, etc... result (played in this order):  4.clarinete,  5.electric guitar, and so on...
Wow, Andrew Huang has the same taste in music creators that I do... Neat.
how am i getting these all right? please help, i'm scared.
Did it feel good though? -IDubbz
I had those headphones and they were my absolute favorite. Apparently they were my dog's favorite, too. he chowed down on them in no time.
I got that shit right
10 hour loop of Roomie saying Cello with a confused face please.
I got all of them. Perks of being in high school pep band. There are very few.
I got them all right but I don't feel confident that I would have guessed cello without hearing cello guessed. certainly I would have failed if I didn't know what the instrument choices were ahead of time, wow
100%! I'm so proud of myself! Where's my A+, Andrew?
I have people texting me rn but it's really confusing because the text tone is the same note as the samples!!!
only one person got them all right... it was me xD
I got like 3/6 right
I don't get the challenge, I named them all correctly without much trouble.
I got them right, except for switching round the cello and the trumpet - and I'm not musically trained at all!
I got all of them right, and my hearing is bad, so I'm just smugly satisfied right now
It's cello, not jello
It could be an electric guitar if you took a new born yak and threw it into a vat of nylon
I wasn't really expecting this but I got them all right. I had thought that the piano sample was the nylon guitar until I heard the nylon guitar at the end then switched my answer.
This video could be a nylon string guitar for all I know
I gotta thank my sponsor from the inside of this Unicorn head.\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!!\nI haven't laughed like that at a dumb sight gag in a long time! Thank you Andrew! :)
Actually got them all correct
I got 5 out of 6
Would have been good if you could have played the entire note at the end to really hear the difference.
If they weren't talking for it, I probably would've got some more of them, they kept making me doubt myself
So I got these all right, but first I had to look up what a nylon guitar was. I figured out it was just a string type of acoustic guitar, other than that the test was fairly easy. \nI don't mean to brag or anything, I am actually confused myself, maybe its because I like to do this sort of thing a lot. A lot of the time its to find the original sounds that were modified to fit an EDM type track, or what a sound from an NES/SNES/N64 is supposed to be mimicking. I mean this is the only logical reason why someone who doesn't know a lot about music would be good at recognising an instrument. (I mean if you asked me to recognise a pitch or note just by hearing it I wouldn't be able to do that.)
it was clear, that rob win this
Woohooo I got them all right! 😁 I paused the video before hearing any other guess so I didn't cheat. 😊
I actually went through this test, and was pleasantly surprised to find that I got all of them correct. The one I had trouble with was the cello because, out of all these instruments, it's the least of heard. I'm proud that I know my tones as well as I do. c:
It could be an electric guitar if... Rob Scallon 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's make this a meme, People!!
Well, I failed miserably. And I play the clarinet. At least the piano is unmistakable.\n1: It's an electric guitar.\n2: Wait, that's an electric guitar. The first was a clarinet.\n3: No, that's an electric guitar. The second was a nylon guitar.\n4: That's a piano. Definitely a piano.\n5: I have nothing...\n6: Wait, that's a nylon guitar. Wait, then what was the second one?
Guessed all of them right!
I want a test WITHOUT an answer sheet.
I got them all correct after I switched which ones I thought were piano/nylon guitar. After I heard the last one I relaized it was the nylon guitar. but 4/6 isn't too bad for the first try...
6/6 and I still can’t write a good song 😐
I play trumpet and literally that blew my mind. 😳
Nailed it. 6 out of 6.
I got them all right. I wouldn't of guessed cello but because all the rest I was confident on the one I didn't know was cello.
I don't get it, this test doesn't seem that hard to me
UGH why do you have boyintheband. Hes so emo he should be in the back of a school room hiding his ugly face. But yourblucky you have the impressionist and you, i liked.
I got all of them right! I thought the piano was nylon guitar at first, but when I heard the last one I figured since you let Roomie change his answer, I could too. So I guess I got 5/6 right if I weren't allowed to switch, but I'm still proud :D
I got them all right but I work with the middle of sampled instruments all the time.
I got em!! But only because the choices were so limited.
I got them all right
Wow I actually got all of them right
It would be an electric guitar if... that'd be a funny meme. Get on it people who are more talented than I.
yuh i got all this right on the first time
i had this idea a few weeks ago lol
Not that anyone cares, but I got 100%
yeah boiiii got them all right
TRUMPET IS BRASS.
6/6!
Roomie saying Cello made me laugh so hard
Easy peasy! Got 'em all right :)
4/6
OMG I actually got ALL correct!!!! :D
got em all right
They all sound like Otomatones!
I got 100%
6/6 boys
*whispers* cello...
Got all 6 right, yay
Cello 5 \nPiano 4\nTrumpet 6\nClarinet       1\nElectric guitar 3 \nNylon guitar 2
Hey 100 percent
Clarinet✔\nTrumpet❌\nElectric guitar❌\nCello ❌\nNylon Guitar❌\nPiano✔
4/6
i got 5
they made this awesome vid together --------------> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQe9w6awkU8&t=0s
please start vlogging
Got all right
ez
Use a speech jammer app!
4 out of 6, missed 2+5
Well....that test was weird-ly easy.
100%!
I got 6/6 😎
C E L L O
My favorite artist in my favorite series movie? Awesome!!
Finally, a Lukas Graham song that doesn't reek of ego and actually sounds decent.
Whether it be a MLP song, I haven't heard Lukas' voice in a while 😞👌. Keep that talent up 👍🔥
Who is here before 1 mill
Out of all in the Movie this one really stuck to me, anyone else?
The song that played in the trailers and TV spots.
I JUST FINISHED THIS MOVIE! Lol
Lucas and Marcus has an amazing songs
XD NOW IN GONNA SEE THE MLP MOVIE JUST FOR DIS SONG.
I've been waiting. It hasn't been in the album till now. \n\nWorth the wait!
Lukas Your song is on the movie!? 😉
An ok song, but it's not old Lukas, it's too much pop, not enough original Lukas. But still the best voice in the world
Just the movie today, it was SO AWESOME!\n#MyLittlePonyMovie\nMy only real complaint was during the pirate introduction, there wasn't really any background other than how they used to be.\nOther than that, one of the greatest ever made by mankind! (Or ponykind, or bronykind... whatever you prefer).
YEAAAAAA I LOVE THIS SONG
I just got back from watching the movie! AND I LOVE IT EVEN MORE THAN BEFORE!!! And may I just say Capper is one SEXY CAT!!!!!
I'm surprised this song is in that movie
*Very beautiful music but does not exceed 7 years for me who is a moving song... 💓😃😍*
My children are a gift- TO ME!\n- Todd in the Shadows, 2k16
This song doesn't take advantage of his incredible voice. He tries too hard in this song to appeal to the gen pop, so...meh.
Why do I love this *so* much
A lyrics on my channel to this song, plz check out https://youtu.be/8vqaIjZ6KHM

I LOVE THIS SONG

It's close to my birthday and this song came out I'm sooooo happy
Can't believe people are disliking this song just because it's included in the MLP Movie OST. Damn you guys, at least show some mercy lol.
https://gostream.is/film/my-little-pony-the-movie-22183/watching.html?ep=1050475\n\nIf u haven't seen the movie

Oi eu sou do BRASIL
Hvor mange danskere er der her inde?
I was gonna be like cool song until I saw my little pony
Just for anyone who wants to sing the lyrics\n\nWe wanna stay\nBut can't find peace while sitting still\nI guess we never will\nWe're on the way\nWe won't hurry back again\nThe journey is the end\n\nI love this very moment\nWe're speeding up not slowing\nWe might know we can't win\nBut we're dumb enough to try\nWe're going, there's no maybe\nThat's why they call us crazy\nAnd we'll say if anybody asks us\n\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know, oh\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know\n\nWe never need to know\nSeeking boundaries to break\nLet's forget the ones we've made\nSo we carry on\nDon't let good things pass us by\nThe time we're gone will be the\nBest time of our life\n\nI love this very moment\nWe're speeding up not slowing\nWe might know we can't win\nBut we're dumb enough to try\nWe're going, there's no maybe\nThat's why they call us crazy\nAnd we'll say if anybody asks us\n\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know, oh\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know\n\nSo go tell 'em we won't stop\nWe know they can't change us\nWe're gonna go way off the map\nTo get ourselves back on the track\nGo tell 'em we won't stop\nWe know they can't change us\nNo need to worry so much\nWe do whatever we want, oh\n\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know, oh\nHey, where you gonna go\nWe're off to see the world\nWe don't need to know
Does this mean Lukas is a brony?
good song but why is there so bad quality sound but in movie not? sound is distorted here.?
gay
Ugh brony bullshit
Lost it at Aerodynamics of a brick.
that ''no drink service'' line followed by the laugh was criiingeyyyy
A Wes Anderson idea or short film turned into real life scenario.
They should add an a380 😂\n\n\n\n\n\n.....
Perfect use case for an electric plane!
How can we find out who is on the videography and photography teams behind the Great Big Story videos? And how can someone possibly apply for an opportunity! Thank you for responding.
do you have to arrive at the airport 2 hours early before the flight?
The firefighters must be busy.
Did it feel good though?
Are they members in any frequent flier program?
Aerodynamic of a brick
I thought quickie(wink), was the fastest!!!
I should be studying
Please don't take my top comment virginity away from me. I'm waiting till marriage.
Clear to land?okok clear to land*everyone goes home*
But what does it cost passengers to fly 80 seconds?
Why not just boat across
Why don't you just train and swim across for that distance?
I think they should get an a380 and use that instead
The story was interesting but that annoying narrator girl I could do without, including the painfully unfunny joke at the end.
1:56   merlin is not dead   he become pilot after he being agent
Taxiing this spend more fuel than flying
1:46 or you could swim
Hmmm yep yep yep... We should probably get an extra air marshal for this route... coz like.. security \n\nImagine losing your luggage on this flight haha
How boring is it to live there
When the Traffic control on the destination airport gives the ok to lift off...
As much as I hate being on a boat, I’d rather fly rather than be on a boat. I still hate flying, but it’s 80 seconds, so…yeah.
I think Scott Manley lost a brother
Shame we couldn't have someone who can speak properly voice over this. I hate this kind of American accent.
there is no way to get an air accident. if there were. they can land quickly
Can't they just build a bridge or a port..?
Long lost family on this one
That's gotta suck for that pilot's flight hours. Imagine at his next job interview: You worked for 10 years and only got 50 flight hours?
Why even live there? its stupid.
The last word in every sentence ends with vocal fry. Weird. Only the last word.
Perfect situation for government cuts and firing each of those unionized non-working crew.  Imagine dedicated firefighting teams for this on the government payroll!  No wonder the UK is a third rate economy.
Where is the TSA!?! Not safe
Imagine the costs when they start using electric planes.
Aerodynamics of a bridge 😂😂😂
That laugh at the end was adorable!
Does he fill out the log books for every flight? \nAlso starting up that airplane takes longer than the flight lol.
It has the aerodynamics of a brick
I love Orkney! Didn't get to either of these islands on my one trip there, but Papa Westray has the oldest building in the U.K., dating to 3700 BC, so .I would love to see it some day. Maybe fly there from Westray!
Thats weird, I could have sworn normal boats were a thing.
Kinda akward if your'e scared of heights
whoever it is, that travels around to make these videos has the greatest job ever!
this is almost like a Wes Anderson movie
no drink service?! c'mon you millenials are so fucking whiney. ITS A ONE MINUTE FLIGHT
They should invest in gliders, it’s even more financially efficient
The most suspicious thing you can bring on an airplane is a parachute.
Why use a plane not a helicopter?
Is that a pilatus?
This is How Father Ted and company got to Craggy Isle
I thought Kegata to Apowo in Papua is the shortest?
Wow amazing place to go MGTOW ;) thanks for posting!
How people in the middle of nowhere can afford all of this?
I Used to live in orkney. I went to stenness primary school with 30 (!) pupils in the entire school. I never got to fly that flight though. Also, we don't normally fly, It gets pretty expensive for commuters so most people just get the ferry.
your mom is the shortest flight in the world
Years till savage Muslims blow up the flight? 5? 10?
If only there was a way to connect the islands together by means of concrete.....
I've been on an even shorter flight.\n\nIts called jumping.
Air controller ? Afraid that you might hit another plane in the air?
How much do tickets for the flight cost? I imagine it would be a bit more expensive than the ferry, right?
Bah.... The joke in Canada was that Air Canada was being criticized for investigating an international *_Windsor_*_ to _*_Detroit_* air route. The runway would have been longer than the required flight.
I live in Scotland
Man, i wanna visit this place...
Did Wes Anderson direct this episode?
The aesthetic of this video reminds me of a Wes Anderson film.
How much fuel per flight  does it use up
My friend? How many flight hours?
So much for telling us the cost. Good reporting.
Only to people with that accent this would make sense!
Looks like a Wes Anderson movie set lol
Please stop with the vocal fry
Nice vocal fry!!!
That joke at the end with the tryhard cute laugh ruined the entire video for me. Seriously.
No drink service (moans)
Take the ferry bud
Massive engine cycles then !
SpaceX BFR for this trip very cost efficient
Just jump

higher testosterone. call and physically visit the hyena sanctuary in Austin, TX. interview them for your next spot! say Mix sent you
I don’t why people “blur” out bad words like: f#@k, b$#&*, p#$$y. This is YouTube not a discovery kids website, they’ll see it one way or another.\n\n\n\n\nMotherfucker, fuck, bitch, pussy, nigger, cracker, asshole, dumbass, shit.
It's just a byproduct of having more testosterone. \nEven human women (mostly body builders) who use performance enhancing (/testosterone) drugs have been known to develop enlarged clits large enough to be labeled micro penises.
So, they are essentially the feminist's spirit  animal?
they are probably like male humans - born with nipples but aren't useful for anything 😂
I...I should have followed the disclaimer
Its how GOD made them
EVEN humans? What are you saying here?
If you can't explain a biological question like this, call Richard Dawkins first before you make a video.
God dammit that would be painful.
So do the vagina and urethra end up at the same hole, or are they separate?
More interesting facts about hyena sex in this video\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHsuEa68xSQ
is it just me or are the female hyena's feminists
Are boy hyenas blue cos that is what make them cool
Perhaps females wernt always domonant so they stuck around
Female hyenas have dicks now???
Poor hyenas, penises and female hierarchy. Poor hyenas
Kinky
XD
does it suck to be a female or male hyena?
Don't be a Hyena.\nBe a Tardigrade.
By far your best end pun ever!!
If there's a 60% chance of it tearing,then why doesn't a female hyena just retract her you know what when she gives birth?
Are all 4 species of hyenas matriarchal? Or only the spotted ones?
I know it was about pseudo-penises but this made my actual penis hurt. That birthing part... -shudders-... I thought I felt bad for human females on birthing. Damn!
Tab For A Cause doesn't work on Firefox. Firefox complains that it can't be verified, and the developers have done nothing to fix this in years.
can you guys talk about how they use dangerous chemicals in are tap water such as chlorine.
is the pseudo penis larger than the normal hyena dick
Ah MinuteEarth: going where even zefrank1 fears to tread....
Idk sounds pretty normal to me.
I'm scared
good
I wonder how long it will take for this video to be demonetized... I'm betting a week.
Maybe it's because male hyenas like traps
Why do they have a penis.... because they're dicks!!!
um so how does furry videos relate to this
new social expectation for trans man flound.
I'm extremely scared of hyenas now
It's just like hentai

Ultimate feminism
It sucks to mate and have pups
If God is real, he must have been trippin' balls when he was making life.

So..MinuteEarth is not fully educational and kid friendly anymore...\n\n\n\nHey at least she got only one vid censored
7 inches doesn't sound very pseudo to me
the urethral and vaginal tubes are inside the 'shaft'? And it is a clitoris  too?

It sucks to be a girl and boy hyena lol
Hyenas make men their bitch to the point they grow their own dick
I love their hyena videos
Okay just because you clearly warned us that this may be a disturbing video doesn't mean we'd take it seriously! This is gross!
This is an episode I didn't need to see while eating breakfast
So glad you didn't waste the opportunity to make a dick joke. Well played!
THIS IS PAINFUL TO WATCH
It's a trap!
This??? Was really choking to hear tbh????
If reincarnation is real, I don't want to be a hyena
the real question is how is this video still monetised
ok•-•\n\ni think i would never wanna be a hyena
*inhales* WHAT\nAlso that slow frame-by-frame clip of the Hyena giving birth wasnt the nicest thing to witness
i didn't konw that  );
Down vote for making a video that's says we don't know on a channel that explains things. This is borderline click bait.
This can be a new anti-rape item for the. feminist
um....\n\n\n\nis this good for children?
Why it sucks to be a male hyena
Once again you didn't answer the fucking question.
This video doesn't give the answer. -_-
does this classify as porn?
I was watching this with my 8 y.o. and thought it was uncomfortable when hyenas were mating as I have not had a discussion with an 8 y.o. PLEASE include in the video description in regarding to the content of your video or make the video restricted. Yes, it was stated that the video about penises, but I was not aware animal sex would be shown.
demonetized in 3,2,1
GROSS!!!!
Wow thats lot of penises
Oh
Please make more hyena videos
Oh god!!!!!!😐😶🙁😫😫😫😫😫😫
Lol
That is werd

Is there a thing where animals or insects have same sex relationships????
*Female On Male...?Unbeleivable*
If it sucks to be a hyena all the time then why are they always laughing.
so hyena =/= good ok
WTF is this??????????
Welp.
Easy to Masturbate to..NOT!

Hyena embraced feminism earlier than human.

Any small youtubers who wanna support each other (: ?
I was def one of the people who replied to your tweet disagreeing with the tweet and I think that this video did a great job of elaborating on the tweet and I now can definitely can see what the meaning was and I really agree with the message of this video. Thank you for elaborating!!
Thank you so much this helped me out alot.
I am glad you posted this! There are so many toxic relationships and it's so lonely compared to be just alone and love yourself
Oh god Hannah your hands are so TINY.
Thank you so much for making this video. I saw those comments and thought they were absolutely ridiculous to think you were trying to shut down the people who don't love themselves or feel like they can't. It was bizzare, I couldn't believe it because they attacked you for a quote they misinterpreted. I'm glad you bought Katie on to explain what you meant in video form. It really means a lot.
maybe you can't love someone until you love yourself should be sometimes the best way to love someone else is to love yourself instead. I feel that is closer to what people actually mean when they say it and it still sound like a motivational poster if thats what you're into
I was really looking forward to this video! I really appreciate your thoughts and Kati's thoughts on the matter, and I understand a lot more where you were coming from with your tweet. I do agree that a healthy relationship comes from self love and loving each other. Twitter is hard sometimes to express complete thoughts, so I really love that the discussion came to YouTube. Thank you:)
I think it's absolutely possible to not totally love yourself and love someone else, but the focus shouldn't be on loving only the other person. I also don't think that the primary focus should be on loving only yorself, but on helping yourself and loving your partner at the same time. This wasn't the most articulate thing I've written, but I hpoe you understand.
Hmm. When I was diagnosed for depression and anxiety in 2002 I took you can't love others before you love yourself to mean you shouldn't try to find love. I thought I would be a burden and risk to everyone. That's a lot of time wasted in a misunderstanding.
*Hannah* !!!! \n\nThis was so inspiring and amazing!\nThe content was beautiful and important.\nBut, your response to a possibility dramatic situation was so mature and  and intelligent and productive and healthy. \nI know that's a lot of adjectives but we need more content like this in the world\n\nThanks for existing!!
If someone apologized to me directly the way Hannah apologized in this video I’d be pretty upset. You can’t please everybody, so if you’re going to bother apologizing you may as well take the time to express yourself in a way that seems sincere. 🤷‍♀️ \n\nAlso, having mental illness doesn’t absolve anyone from saying inconsiderate things. Mental illness is such a broad category that it’s em hard to appreciate everyone’s individual struggles. \n\nAnyway, there’s nothing wrong with the message that prioritizing others over yourself is unhealthy. But recognizing that a lot of people struggle on the daily with loving themselves and are still duly capable of loving others won’t hurt you. Regardless of what you meant, it’s still technically what you said. Maybe blunt statements and clapping emojis on Twitter isn’t the best method of delivery next time?
Love this video. Great topic. One question is the background music The Doogie Houser tv show theme?
This is a really important topic, and I think you handled it really well.  It was really helpful to hear what you had to say about it
I just learned a LOT about myself
Fill my void \n *That's what she said*
every move a sphinx kitty makes looks like it is planning to take over the world.... even climbing on a shoulder
I love that you came back and made a video about this important topic since there was so much frustration about the topic within your fan base. Appreciated! Good content!
Thank you Kati because this is so true and so people just disregard it
It's true that you definitely can love someone when you don't love yourself, but it gets so much deeper and more beautiful when you love yourself first.

You made light of people who were bothered by your remarks. 🤔 this is just all over the place. Be you and find a place that makes you happy. There are no rules to happiness or love. ✌🏻❤️😊
This is an amazing video! Thank you for allowing us to sit in on such an important discussion
Good on you for taking the input and deciding to talk about it, especially with a professional. It would be easy for you to say Ah, screw it, shut up! but you chose to have this convo and dive deeper than 140 characters. Awesome, Hannah! 💚💛💜
Self love is awesome! It’s one of the first things you taught me about, and I for one do agree that you can have a relationship before you love yourself but in order to give yourself completely into loving someone else, you’ll need to love yourself so you can tell yourself that you can do that. But that’s just me, I understand other perspectives💖💖
This is a wonderful reaction to that tweet, Hannah. generally i've seen you handle it very well. It's lovely that you're willing to listen and modify an opinion!\nI've learned from this as well. I was quite opposed to your tweet seeing as my girlfriend would probably say she hates herself, definitely not love, but I also really see our relationship (by now) as a very healthy one! \nWhat Kati said about self-care being maybe a more important factor in that makes a lot of sense to me though. My girlfriend does work incredibly hard to take good care of herself, and I don't think we could do it without that. \nthis has been nice. i love you both <3
Thanks for the clarification. I knew what you meant when you posted that, and I agree with you, 100%. I've seen firsthand how insecurity and self-doubt can affect relationships in my own experiences over the years. But it's always good to clarify :)
On some days I self-love my brains out.  HAHA j/k thank you Hannah and Kati great video
My thought response to your tweet was that you’re absolutely right and that’s because my immediate thought was about those in abusive relationships. I myself have never been in one but I know people who have and what’s gotten them out of those relationships is realizing they deserve better. So I thought you do have to love yourself enough to know your worth and if you’re giving your love to someone who just makes you feel worse than it’s okay to walk away from that.\n\nSpeaking more from my personal walk of life, I have depression and anxiety and more often than not I will have days where I see myself completely worthless and I hate everything that I am but I know despite that my heart is so full and I am capable of loving someone else. \n\nHonestly Hannah I think it was a great tweet as a reminder to yourself and others who may struggle in the same way. And after some of the response I think you handled it very well. Thank you so much for this video ❤️
Wish I had two friends like you!
Great conversation! I think something that can get lost in this topic is what it seems like you were referring to a little bit in your tweet. The world is a mirror to our internal experience, and if we don't cultivate self-love we can react really negatively to facets of ourselves that we see in other people. So, while we can love others regardless, there can be pieces of them that we struggle to find love for because we are too preoccupied with our own self-loathing.
She said something about love wells. Now I wanna hear y'all talk about love languages lol
There was nothing wrong with your tweet .i think most of therapists I've seen have said this to me soooooooo............. love to ya Hanna you're awesome
I was one of the people who was hurt by your tweet but after this video I realise, I actually agree with you on so many points. So thank you for this great video :)
I think 'neurotypical' has just become an umbrella term for anyone who does not suffer any type of mental illness. Not sure if it is scientifically correct, but that's the common usage these days.\n\nalso i really liked this video, i think that quote (you cant love others til you love yourself) could definitely use some adjustments to clarify its true meaning. Kati is so great!
If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? RuPaul says it all the time 😊
im so happy you guys made this. its sad and very surprising that you got negative feedback on your Tweet Hannah, but i love this video because I've been trying really hard over the last year or two to do exactly this; love myself (and love myself before i love someone else). its really important to me personally because I've never felt that way about myself before. thanks again guys!
Thank you for this Hannah <3 I am a firm advocate in loving yourself, but sometimes it's difficult to practice what you preach. Thanks for the reminder <3\n\nAlso I've seen people use Neurotypical to describe people that don't have any mental illness or cogntive/learning disabilities so maybe that's what they were referring to? I don't know, but I heavily disagree with wanting to promote self love as 'neurotypical'
Oh wow, this hit so close home I had to pause the video around 2.25 because it was making me cry. I'm gonna watch the rest later at home where I can cry 😂
Love this, such a good message to send out to the world <3 I find it strange some get mad at being told this, however some people find it a hard fact to accept. Thanks for making a video on this Hannah! :D
you need to learn how to love yourself before someone else trys to live you or love them
oh boy here comes a giant  too insightful comment! so i realize that i am 22 and i'm young and i think i know everything but really i know shit so take my words for what they are. I hated myself for the longest time, i started lately to begin trying to be less critical, which is not working out great but it's a start, and i have to agree with the fact that you have to love yourself to love someone else, not in the sense that you are incapable of feeling love for others, i fell in love and hated myself, it actually made me feel a bit less worthless, but it was a disaster, it wasn't mutual, i felt loved back but i wasn't and it fucking hurt, made situation even worse after. Before being with others i believe you have to decide who you want to be, maybe my mind is too old for my age but i worked out who i want to be, and i'm trying to and even if it terrifies me i'm now tired of being alone and i want friends and i want someone whom i know loves me back. Sorry it's a really interesting topic and i'm not having the best week, and i overshare on comments cause i kind of don't know if they get read or they disappear in nothingness. I'll shut up now, good video as always, hope you're doing good guys ^^.
Lovely video\nI love how mature you are, Hannah 💜
I've been struggling with this a lot recently. Just got out of my first ever relationship, which lasted 6 months, with a guy I knew I wasn't right for but who showed me love when I didn't love myself. I've had depression and anxiety for basically forever and have consistently struggled with loving myself for years. Even though we wouldn't have worked out if I was healthier, we probably would have had better times and I wouldn't have cried to him so much, asking him to show me that I was worthy of love. Got to figure out how to support myself so I don't put myself in another unhealthy relationship.
Calling Hannah neurotypical is eh... An interesting choice. Y'know, since she has ADHD, which is a neuropsychiatric disorder? I use the term neurotypical as a way to describe the alienation I feel as an autistic person in abled groups of people. I doesn't really apply to mental health overall, since that isn't necessarily related to neurodivergence.
Hanna I thought your tweet was honest like where you were at. I appreciate the video and found it very helpful, Thank you you are an impressive young lady-
Funny. I was just journaling and read some of my old entries, where I found this from a year ago: ... By self-love and self-respect, I learned to speak up. I actually learned to feel love. And let myself to be loved. I learned to open my heart, to give and to receive. To make the room for myself and for others. And forgiveness. You cannot love if you have reserved a place for hatred. \nNow, these are just my feelings, not marginalizing all people. I had a relationship before I learned to love myself and I loved my SO, and still, do even after a breakup, but it was not enough. I was never able to utter the words I love you, was always insecure about every of my movements, sentences, decisions. And it was a very childish way of the relationship, more of a friendship with occasional sex. I understand, what others come from. You can love even you hate yourself. But at least for me, you cannot love unconditionally, without fear and with comfort. There will always be some skeletons in the closet, which will burden you and your partner, therefore your relationship. Now I'm happily in love again, with the feeling stronger than me, making me say stupid things like my SO is the most beautiful person on the planet. I was never able to say such things, now I'm not ashamed of being in love, not scared of being vulnerable. Just happy to have an awesome partner in life :)
People need to get over themselves. You can't say anything on the internet without someone jumping down your throat for no reason. It's obvious what Hannah's tweet meant. Use some basic critical thinking skills and stop inventing reasons to be offended, people. #Smh
Thank you for bringing attention to something that is so important. I recently was thrown in to caring for my grandparents and the stress is unbelievable. I constantly remind myself that it's all for them to be happy. It's stressful but worth every minute I get to spend with them. And yes... We all need to take a day or an hour or a minute just to hit the reset button
People don't love unconditionally, otherwise they wouldn't get upset - if you are coming from a place of love, there is no place for anger. So your original message was correct, but broken people react the only way they are able to at that time in their life.
I love Kati!! And I love this collab. You both are my YouTube mental health gurus. I only see my counselor once a week but I get my fill in when I need help from you both. Much love.
Thank you for showing how we all have love surrounding us in some shape or form and that we can do attitude x
I love me so much that others can easily learn from my behavior on how to love me.
i feel like what people usually mean by this comment/phrase is that people who are unable to love themselves or even find anything positive about who they are as a person usually wont accept love from another person, often pushing it away stemming from the thoughts that they arent worth it.. idk but it makes sense to me as someone who has struggled with it
Awesome, I'm not sure I can truly love myself, good to know it's not necessary to find love
A couple of points I'd like to make.\nFirst being that you are in the entertainment business first and foremost. Please remember you cannot please everyone all the time. It's impossible so that being the case please remember to give yourself some grace and professional distance from the comments you see otherwise I feel you will be second guessing yourself all the time. \nSecond point. When you have guests and/or your friends on to help illustrate a point that you point out somewhere their credentials. The whole video and in the description i kept waiting for something like, 'Hey, this is my friend _________ who is a __________ and/or is a licensed ________ who is with us today to discuss ________.'\nWithout that information to me it's just two like minded people trying to reiterate a point.\n\nAs always Hannah, luvs you since the first day I saw your videos and will continue to do so. SMOOCHES!
I think it is hard to love somebody if you can't love yourself. Cause not loving yourself will lead you to make choices that hurt yourself and therefore the relationship. You WILL hurt people.
Neurotypical is a term I have seen a lot on the internet and from what I understand it means if you are giving advice regarding mental health then you have no idea what it's like to struggle with mental illness. Being called neurotypical in this case is essentially in the same likeness as someone advocating for veganism telling people with chronic illness that they will be cured if they partake in a plant based diet. That if you drink water and get fresh air, that will cure your depression forever, that would be considered neurotypical in this case. Unfortunately that develops a very unhealthy rhetoric for people actually trying to gain self worth and recover from very self destructive behaviors. No, practicing self care is not going to cure you forever. It t won't suddenly fix the amount of dopamine or serotonin your brain may not produce on its on its own, but it can make day to day life more manageable and maybe even enjoyable. This internet culture of needing to actively be self destructive and that if you aren't your advice or experience is invalid is highly damaging. Whatever you can do, however small the act may be, to bring yourself some peace is worth it. And as someone who struggles with PTSD and depression, I can say that and still be valid. You are not broken for wanting to feel better in your own life and experience.
Great video and great message! Of course you can't fully love someone (without negative strings attached) until you love yourself (and, additionally, have been loved by others - not necessarily in the romantic sense). Someone who says they love you, when you hate yourself (not necessarily to an extreme) may be just in it for their own gain; there is a difference between reciprocal love and codependency. The *vs* part (the title) is a bit...off? To me if you were to compare the two there is already a clear difference as one is based on one person and the other is based on more than one person; love can be one-sided, reciprocal, or not love at all but a feeling that is confused as love. All of this is okay! We live, we learn. Keep 'em coming chickadee!
GIRL! ME! So true. Glad you spoke about this!
I am really impressed by the way you've taken critique lately, Hannah. I felt like your take on the subject was wonderfully nuanced and I appreciated your ability to take on other people's thoughts about self love and refine your understanding. As someone struggling with mental health issues who is in a healthy relationship with another mentally ill and also chronically ill (CFS) person, this video was a great reminder of some important things for me personally and I will definitely be having a loving conversation with my partner about this subject very soon. Thanks for the timely kick in the bum and the great video ^_^
I appreciate that you took something you said that people found controversial and did a constructive deep dive on it. You clarified without being defensive. It was a really beautiful way of communicating. Thanks :)
Kati's karma necklace tho <3  I never take mine off!
great video!.. but... is katie's shirt a bit offensive? i just got the feeling someone is going to say something bout it haha
Hannah I’ve recently accepted my sexuality as part of who I am and I want to come out to friends and family. However my family is homophobic and I don’t know what to do. I have four years until I can leave and I don’t think I can not be myself that long. I just don’t know what to do and need help.
I go to eat chocolate.\n\nLook in place.\n\nChocolate not there.\n\nRemember ate yesterday.\n\nMe and Myself are still coming to terms with loss,\nbut I love Me and Myself will forgive with time.\n\nWe both love chocolate, but must remember next time.
I love how you took a slightly questionable tweet you made, apologized, and turned it into a teaching moment! ❤️ Love you, Hannah! This video is soooo important. Thank you. 👏And thanks Katie!
Neurotypical was used by autistic people to refer to people who were non-autistic, but I have recently seen people who have other uncommon neurological conditions using the term, generally referring to those who not only aren't autistic but who are not neurodiverse in general.
Thank you for this video Hannah! I was there for all the kerfuffle over that tweet and I was torn between which side to be on. This video does a fantastic job of explaining your feelings and I gotta say you're completely right.
This is the greatest video you have ever made.
Hannah, you always put out videos when I need them most. I have always struggled with self loathing and I am trying to change that way of thinking and its really hard...do you have an tips?
Brene brown's book the gifts of imperfection has been helpful to me. She says you can only love someone as much as you love yourself. You can only accept someone's imperfections as much as you accept and allow your own
I despise how frequently you are forced to feel bad for speaking your thoughts and opinions. :(
i had no idea u filmed together until i got home and saw the notifications of both of ur channels, made my day
I'm so basic I shoulda been named Norm
You are so true!
What a great video💖💖Thanks for your advices Hannah,you're the best
I am constantly saying that you cannot expect others to make you happy, that it is something you have to do for yourself, and self love is a big part of that. Any love and happiness you gain from others should be a bonus, not an expectation. I also battle my own mind every day, and PMS makes it far worse (so fun when I forget to check my calendar), so this is definitely a struggle for me, but also something I try to be an example of, as much as I can, for my kids.
Sooo... Well thanks for mentioning this subject about Neurotypicals... I'm a psychologist who works with people in the Autism's Espectrum. They think I'm a NT but I don't. 😅😅 It's difficult to understand and this isn't the way to exchange information, but you were so correct, respectful and polite... Thanks. 👍🏻
Thank you. I needed this right now.
I really love this video because it talks about what I’m going through and it helped me to realize and learn what I may be feeling or experiencing. So thank you both! 💕 This is a really good topic to talk about.
I love this so much! Thank you for posting this
love is important, and this is a serious video, thank you hannah for bringing  up such an important topic.
What if we find ourselves in a relationship like this? I think both me and my gf have self love problems, and I think I'm the type that Hannah described. I go into the relationship giving and giving so I can feel fulfilled, but my girlfriend is more how Kati described it. She doesn't love herself so she's in the relationship to feel loved by me. Basically, I've found myself in a situation where I'm giving and giving so I can feel fulfilled, but she seems to just take and take and not give much back. I don't know what to do, because I honestly love her, and I love who she is, and alot of the time when we're together I have alot of fun with her. It's more like she's this amazing friend that I cherish so much, but she's a bit of a selfish lover. I don't know if that's because of her own self love issues, but I really need some advice.
What is love to you?
i hate myself whoop z
Happy Sunday, thanks for watching.
Heyy I think the problem a lot of people had w the tweet (me included) was that it seemed to simplify the issue wayyyy too much. And that it could easily affect some of your viewers who admire you and may be in self-hate places right now by making them feel defeated if self-love seems far away from them right now even if they’re on the journey. This was a great video which really gave the issue the time it needed.

You said something wonderful sistas :)
sorry, no malice intended but good Lord.... blah blah....
I wouldn't worry about the twitter experts. Folks on that app like to think they know everything about anything that may roll into their twitter feed and they are required to spew their knowledge in the most unsavory of ways. YOU ROCK HANNAH :)
The thousand likes on this video compared to the 11 dislikes are supporting you and encouraging you, Hannah. Don't let the trolls get you down!
LP no other band was better than prime Linkin Park... Not one
Wanna kill yourself? Imagine this. You come home from school one day. You’ve had yet another horrible day. You’re just ready to give up. So you go to your room, close the door, and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over You take out those razor blades, and cut for the very last time. You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying nd brother won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at college , there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you. That boy that used to tease you and call you names, he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how good you really are. Your ex girlfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. shee can’t handle it. shee breaks down and starts crying, and blames herself . Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? He’s in shock. He can’t believe it. He knew what you were going through, but he never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. He can’t cry, He can’t feel anything. He stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that boy with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big brother , you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, he stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground,he just loses it. He cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex girlfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with boys . Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? He tried to kill herself. He didn’t succeed like you did, but He tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do. Your choices don’t just affect you. They affect everyone. Don’t end your life, you have so much to live for. Things can’t get better if you give up. I’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk, no matter who you are. Even if we’ve NEVER talked before, I’m here for you. Copy and paste this as your status to show people there are people out there that care.let's see who actually read all of it.\nFor anyone that feels this way \nplease copy and repost . We are trying to demonstrate that someone's always listening.
I work as a behavioral health specialist and I can say, my clients that have depression tell me, in their own way, that having depression is like knowing that you are loved and can be surrounded by people who love you, but you still feel alone inside because you feel like a relation of any kind can't happen, so you feel isolated. Granted, others with depression may explain it differently, this is just what I've gathered.
A really nice song,thabk you chester for all the times we had with you,your songs helped me get over my depression,A legend never dies
shout out to everyone...feel the same.thanks
This is beautiful.. We'll be missing u Mr Chester ..U make my childhoods perfect ;)
Hi, group linkin park is an honor to write you know something I to you the people thanks to my dad he was a big fan of you know only you are my memory of the know that I admire and love you
One More Light 💕💕💕\nChester (*) 😣😭😭😭
I have never heard this song until now... \n\n\n\n\nI was not emotionally prepared. As I see the scars on my wrist I'm sobbing on my bed.
Chester will NEVER die, cuz, he's in the middle of us: fans of LP... \nIt's a shame that he's fisically gone, because, he saved a lot of lives from depression. His messages wil live 4ever betwwen us.
It was a shame that he had took his own life he was a great musician he said a lot examples for lots of people he loved A lot of people and I'm sure a lot of people love him back he's a legend of all time rest in peace God bless
No one knows that it is going to be Chester's light which will goes out.
God dammit man. Why do you have to punch me right in the feelings. 😭
Chester will never be forgotten
DAMN IT AM I CRYING??!!
😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦 so sad he knows my dad my dad is so sad my dad was his step 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
forever in the we all hearts
I'm so confused about why the best musicians are just fading away, it's like my friends don't care about him, they just change the topic or just say that he's just not as good as Pop artists. And it makes me mad. \n\nChester was the person who kept me alive, 13 years old, alive and healthy. And people just don't care about him. I feel ashamed of my life and friends I have. But I can't change that. It's hard being unsocial. I just cant. \n\n\nPlease if you have a problem with depression, please tell someone.\n\n\n(EDIT) and for the 1k people who disliked this can die in a hole
NOOOO, I DON'T WANT HIM DEAD, GIMME CHESTER BACK 😭😭😭
*R.I.P Chester* 😭 *me and my mother are so sad* 😭😭😭
Even better if I don't know him it was the most saddest song ever
Just look at the new lp logo......a part is missing there. Linkin Park is not whole without Chester and that's why this missing piece stands for the end of Linkin Park.
We, all of us. We remember and love you Chester. We will always remember you. ❤❤❤
Chester will never died, he will live fovever in our heart💜💜💜\nlove u man😖😖
I think that song is a message to us.
this is beautiful xx
people who disliked dont have a soul or a heart

Science has led to greater peace? So the gas chambers used to kill 11 million people (6 million of those were jews) led to peace? The invention of the atomic bomb led to peace?
And the monster fell, just as his creator. Exhausted. Battered. Bruised. The four heroes entered the castle to receive their rewards.
Is math related to science?
I like how he just answered “yes.” Hahaha what a champ. That’s the only way to deal with those conspirator morons. don’t give them extra attention they want, just answer their question and watch their heads explode.
This is what happened to me after every answer he gave https://youtu.be/9CS7j5I6aOc
Neil are you a scientoligist
this guy has  in his name two  of the  fastest mens name  in the history . tyson gay and andre degrasse
If he was my teacher that would be dope
Tie steal the show
There must be actual intelligent questions he gets. The good questions probably arent as interesting to make a show out of.

I am not smart enough to understand most of what this guy's saying. I was so bad at physics in school ;_; massive respect to him though, he seems like a fun, smart guy

Yes

His tie looks like my shirt, but without a Bob Ross on it.
I really wanted someone to ask him is math related to science
2:42 shouldn't it be dark energy rather than dark matter in the tweet?
7:07 Alien is basically just another word for stranger, so we're all aliens.
Hey! We can to taste protons! They're sour (H+).
Did he did string theory with that 3 special dimensions and one time dimension get over it comment 😂😂😂😂
I got a question we know the universe started with the big bang but where the the Big bang start/occur ( Specific Location)
Those questions are so STUPID
I hate that people have such a great opportunity to ask him questions about universe and they just ask stupid questions
His character reminds me of Bill Murray.
Not ''then peace''....I think the tweet meant ''Peace'' as a thank you.
'Across The Universe' is fantastic. It's a love story told through Beatles music.

I like watching Neil degrasse's related videos even though I can't even spell half of the words he uses to describe the universe.
4:51 is that a nazi profile picture?
I wish I had him as a science teacher in school.
I deeply admire this man's restraint.\n\nYou can just see how rattled he is by the sheer stupidity of some Twitter users. There's undoubtedly a part of him that desperately wants to rip these losers a new one.\n\nBut he's resolutely committed to his role as an educator. If Laozi lived today, the Daodejing would have a story about Neil DeGrasse Tyson.
His voice is better than Morgan freedmen
Strange
Neil is a pseudointellectual.
Love his tie!
Oh yeah
a god
I love you

WAKE UP PEOPLE THE EARTH IS FLAT
After he said the earth isnt a sphere, i cant take anything he says legitimately.
Is math related to science?
Why is he so condescending? He said it himself that questions shouldn't be shamed. They should always be embraced, but when you're being a snide prick about how you answer the questions, it really turns people off. He just seems snobby in this
But is math related to science?
Jist because u cant see it, touch it, smell it, dosent mean it doesn't exist... WOW
Since the universe is still expanding, what if you are faster than light and able to pass it, basically going further than the universe, you will be somewhere where there is nothing absolutely nothing.NOTHING
But did it feel good though?
3:14 so God exists confirmed?
I love he's so hunble about his knowledge. He answers some theae stupid questions so kindly. He's so not boastful.
Oh this guys a government pig.

King Krule is so refreshing and inspiring. Excited to see such a young talent continue to create great music. Looking forward to see what he does in the future.

blah blah shut up everyone jesus christ. it's a cool song but you're gonna look back at yourselves and cringe at how you thought leaving the creepiest fanboy/girl comments ever and overhyping this decent song you probably have no idea the meaning of (nor do i) was gonna get you like... on his contacts list. Eh... stop.
be basic finally some useful advice !
I love autumn and am (shamefully unashamedly) kind of enjoying how it’s becoming a brand or thing. It’s cosier, I want to be spooky but in a joyous way. Ha. I don’t buy any thing pumpkin spice but I do read gothicly and kick leaves.
I love you Lex. Never change. (Unless you want to it's all cool man it's your life)
This is interesting because I am someone who gets really heavily affected by SAD, and autumn has alwayyys been my least favourite season as my depression seems to hit me the worst during it. But in recent years it's started to grow on me, and I think a lot of that IS the grandeur that comes with the commercializations of autumn. Before when summer ended all I'd do is dread the lack of sunshine in the coming months, the rain and my seasonal affective disorder inevitably kicking in, and even though that's all still true, it's like my brain can be distracted like yeah it's going to get gloomy out, but pumpkin spice lattes are back!! Halloween decor! Cozy spooky evenings!! and even though it's all done with the intent to sell stuff, I can't say I mind it for what it's worth.
this is the only comment section which is fun to read and has no awful comments! Good children
Yes. I am pro joy.
I was so convinced there was a window to the left of the fireplace but now there's all this space there...and objects...I don't know who I am anymore
They only meet our needs and what we demand. I dont hate commercialization. Seasons give people inspiration to switch things up to attract customers.\nThe only problem I have is that small business dont really benefit from it as  much as much as large corporations.\nI love small business. too bad nobody cares about it anymore & just runs to their local starbucks smh
I dislike autumn but I respect people's rights to celebrate and enjoy it with items. :P and I agree, who am I to deny someone their right to make themselves feel better with socks and things? if those things worked on me to convince me that this is an enjoyable season, hell I'd be doing the same!
You look like that one girl from that black mirror episode
I just don't like the fact that people associate buying things with being happy... I love autumn but I hate consumerism
I was randomly searching for smth that gives me a cozy, autumn feeling here on YouTube. Then I almost got a headache by all the brainless chatter about senseles​s topics from these commercialised puppies... I gave it one more shot and there were you, finally. Brain!
Thank you! I really don't want to hate on vloggers who peddle all their wares as I think we all know those arguments inside out, but I am truly agog at the amount of junk that some of them churn out. Zoella must have more than 40 different (incredibly generic) products out at the moment, all of which she is totally nuts about and LOVES. I really struggle with this as all i see it as is them taking advantage of young viewership who aspire to their lifestyle, sucking them dry of pocket money etc. I am basically a commie so realise comment is very null in void but imagine the influencers used their following to promote environmentally conscious pratices etc.
WHOA - Comfy socks are for the whole year!
I always love your ramble videos ^_^ <3
Fine decoration is not a matter of being rich or poor babe but of personal taste. Luv!
I don't like wearing summer colours so autumn makes my normal seem more ...fashionable? Autumn is quite stressful because i never know whether i should wear a coat or not.
I've always loved this time of year, I love fireworks night, thanksgiving, my birthday! The colours of leaves! And the flavours associated with autumn! I also am one of the few people who doesn't like summer so when it gets cold and rainy Im Very happy! I don't have much money so can't exactly buy into it but I love watching autumn hauls or vlogs where other people have - I guess I get my autumn fix vicariously through that!
I have never heard a convincing argument for Autumn's commercialisation till now! .. \n\nJust one problem in my context. Stop trying to make Halloween a thing in Australia (at companies). There is no justification for it. You want to know why?....... Because it is freakin SPRING!
See in florida fall is the end of terrible weather and the beginning of pleasant weather
I love your hair!
Run my children! Be basic! I love it!!! Hahaha
I love autumn (or fall because America), but I live in Texas now... Fall only exists inside my apartment. :'(
The suggested video after this was Zoella's autumn homeware haul
I was just thinking the other day about how strange I find it when people aggressively autumn-decorate. I love cosiness but I'm also lazy...
I used to only enjoy spring, but since I found proper medication and don't get depressed anymore, I've started to warm up (get it) to autumn and winter. I still hate summer as I can't stand humidity and heat and am a very sweaty person, but without the prospect of crippling depression inching closer I'm just relieved I can finally cover up in big sweaters and ridiculously huge scarfs and not sweat the whole time again. And the (admittedly scarce) sun this time of year is actually enjoyable and nice and warm instead of something to avoid at all costs.
Somehow a three minute video from you leaves one with the impression of having absorbed at least 20 mins of emotionally charged, informed, and relevant content. More so than most actually 20 min long videos. How'd you do that, Lex?
Be basic, be merry in the leaves is going to be my motto for the season.
Interestingly it's because of this commercialisation of Autumn that I feel most disconnected from the world just because I live in Australia. We don't really have any of the stuff going on now when it's Autumn for us, which I'm guessing is because it's not a big enough market. Or maybe it's because it would clash with the majority of what we consume, which is American and British trends and media. We already have all of the winter-geared Christmas stuff when we are melting in 40 degree Celcius weather.
I love autumn and glumglum sadness season! I'm born in autumn and have always associated it with happy times :)\n\n(Unfortunately there's no pret where I live and the seasonal starbucks drinks aren't vegan)
It's always odd for me because summer is always the absolute worst for me, I don't sleep, my depression is a lot worse and I have nightly panic attacks. Autumn is like a 'thank fuck that's over' for me.
Unrelated but I do appreciate your eye-makeup and thats saying something because I usually dont notice makeup or care for it much... Anyway its lovely.
And like where is all the fall themed music? Everyone sings about summer and winter and spring but why doesn’t anyone sing about the best goddamn season we get?!
I love autumn and I love cozy socks and scented candles, and I love everything about it. Sorry. Take my money.
I don't get the big fuss about autumn. Like sure, the leaves turn orange and it gets a bit windy. No need to go conkers over it.
I'm from central California and it is ALWAYS AND FOREVER hot except for the bless-ed few cold weeks we get between early November and late January before it turns stuffy and hot again, so I've always loved autumn because it's the only time I'm not boiling hot or sweating slightly. The first excuse I get to wear a cardigan and not sweat to death I am THERE. also I was born in November so autumn time is in my nature.
Please don't say you're not young! I'm only a year or two younger than you and you feeling old makes me feel old!\n(You thought this was going to be a kind uplifting comment but really I'm just selfish hurrhurrr)
i had just started thinking about this this autumn, thanks for putting it in words!
Autumn rules, I love cracking out my coats and jumpers. And if people want to buy flavoured coffee and warm clothes, is that such a bad thing?
See, I'm not a fan of sunlight. So Autumn is a boon as far as I am concerned. Heck, I was married on Halloween.
I feel like you and Noel Fielding would be a dream team
this is slightly ironic, given the video but...where did you get your jumper??? I need it in my life
Thank you, I will ♡
Do you have a source for that spooky statistic claim? Fascinating.
Thank you for raising S.A.D. Lex, it's a pain in the arse to say the least
IT'S COLD SELL ME WARMTH AND COMFORT PLS THX
the commercialism of autumn doesn't really bother me that much. \n\nit's mainly cos I can't get behind the products/campaigns as a lot of them aren't of much interest to me like for example pumpkin spiced latte's (I absolutely hate coffee and milk)
One thing I'm not keen on about the commercialisation of Autumn is after one cooler day you're inundated with ads about cosy jumpers and instead of enjoying the last nice days of summer it imbues it with a sense of desperation?! Mind you I am one of the people for whom worse weather means bad times so I guess I'm not the target audience. Love your videos Lex!
I don’t think it’s deep, just how the world is, the market sees that people enjoy cosy socks and hot coco in the colder months, to pay the bills this month they sell cosy socks and hot coco
Did you dye your hair pink? x
Absolutely dislike autumn, strongly hate the cold. But nothing beats a dark autumn night, lots of rain and wind, when Im sitting inside my place with coco, next to a radiator, reading a book, wearing knitwear hugged by my teddy and a blanket. Still want summer back tbh.
This is a v interesting topic which I probably should comment on but also where is your jumper from?
Spring is the best season handsdown
I hate capitalism. :( I prefer being cosy with my wife than luxuries.
I definitely agree that celebrating every season including the miserable ones is a good thing. Part of living in the now and enjoying the present instead of always hanging out for summer. However being in the southern hemisphere it is very confusing when everyone starts getting autumnal while here we are getting 25+ degree days again!
A bit off-topic: it’s SO nice to see that your home is not all blogger-y, with fairy lights and matching decor. It’s cozy! And lived in! And just a normal home. ❤️
I'm thrilled to have less humidity and bugs and more autumnal colors in the trees even if it means my tomatoes are dying and I can't make fresh pesto anymore.
I love the shattered illusion tbh
(Also Over the Garden Wall has REALLY helped me romanticize autumn)
High quality description 10/10
Honestly I love commercialised autumn/christmas.
CAT
LOVE the description
KITTEH!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fZU9awMFU
You live in central London? I thought that was impossible....
Toy Story 2 was alright.
Autumn's a filthy casual.
NO
Up next: Autumn Homeware Haul. Loving Autumn: yay, pro-joy. I have noticed more Autumn (insert capitalism here) vids on Youtube. I kinda don't like the idea that we have to change our whole wardrobe and decor when the seasons change. Surely most people just get out their jumpers/jackets/scarves, put away their summer dresses and leave their interiors pretty much the same. I love decorating my house for xmas as much as the next person but I don't change the cushions or the bedding... Where would I keep the spare stuff?! I ain't got space for storing this stuff when I'm not using it, let alone the bother or money to buy it all.
See this is why I love springtime. I know that it can get categorised as being 'Easter', but on the whole, aside from pastel colours, spring is left alone more so than summer (BIKINI BODIES SUMMER HOLIDAYS THERE ARE CHILDREN EVERYWHERE), winter (Christmas and New Years) and Autumn (Halloween and Bonfire night etc). I feel extremely rejuvenated during the transitional seasons of spring and autumn, and I find myself craving the change in my environment as I live in the countryside so I get the full scope of the season change in trees and such. I do love autumn, and will wear cosy jumpers and nestle up by the fire, but the commercialism of Autumn is getting a little wearing. If I have to see another Instagram post which is a list of things to do in autumn like go to a pumpkin patch and buy an autumn scented candle in a cute pair of boots, I will scream.
Either the compression in YouTube is off the charts or you appear to have aged more than 15 years in a short amount of time
I hate the cold. Summer is the only time I feel cute and able to look like my body is mine. I hate the cold and I hate having to wear layers that make me feel fat and frumpy and I hate chapped lips and raw noses and my eyes tearing from the cold and the wind and I hate the rain and the snow and the wet socks and frozen fingers. \nBUT!!! Commercialization of autumn and winter (which is just Halloween and Christmas, lets be honest) is actually getting me excited for the season! I am looking forward to autumn dresses and christmas sweaters and going to a Harry Potter themed halloween party, and getting and giving presents on christmas and pumpkin pie and cinnamon things. the whole shebang, I'm excited.
I love autumn and it's getting hotter in New Zealand now but I'll be in the USA soon and I'm way too excited to see how they do autumn and buy into all this shit hahaha
but I do not understand how someone can enjoy the cold. IF THEY CAN, GOOD ON THEM, but I can't, it's too cold. I hate this season xD
rubbish video
They don’t supply any head phones need to buy your own
No headphone jack - no sale. It's also $200 too expansive for either version, but so was the original Pixel imo. Side bezels are as thick as those that come on very cheap Chinese phones. Axon 7 has two front firing, stereo speakers with a great DAC for less than half the price.
I think the Pixel 2 XL is awesome I will have to get one!!
GOOGLE
Hi, great video like always. Can you maybe introduce me a bit of the car mount with wireless charing? Thanks.
plz i want 8 plus space gray abdimoh1598@gmail.com i dont have twitter plaz i want iphone 8 plus ig is @a.moh_19
2:45 whats that crackiling??
Preference \n3rd oneplus 5\n2nd iPhone X\n\n\n\n\n1st pixel XL2
Cameras are dope
Squeezable edge over headphone jack!? No one wants that shit #justiceForWiredHeadphones
tbh portrait mode looks like a photoshop
That ISSA 21 savage ! 👌🏾👌🏾
Just awesome
Waiting for full review
$399 nope
That's awesome
21 savage a banger🤙🏽☝️
It looks ugly
BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL
Ugly crap
3:43 fuck face
0:20 Pixel 2 has AMOLED display i think . XL has POLED.
difference between the iphone 7, 8, X and Note 8 as they do the blur effect live and not after you take the photo. you can see the blur while taking the photo
Colorizer? I think you mean circular polarizer.
My reaction....... booooorrriiinng.
Neither
It looks cheep it looks like a 50$ Chinese phone from ebay they could have actleast  gave it dual camera the camera,but the ​ lens is just descusting tbh i like the iphone 7+ lense cuase it doesn't look cheep D- for google i expectid better im disappointed
side by side with lgv30 thanks.
Wish the XL came in Kinda Blue
I have no idea what Google was thinking when they designed the Google Pixel 2. It looks outdated and is overpriced.  The company is also hypocritical for making fun of Apple for their removal of the headphone jack, while they do the same thing a year later. Of course, Android fans will say that it is innovation rather than bashing them like they did with Apple.
I’m team iPhone but I wouldn’t mind switching to a pixel
Good to see the next generation of Pixel. A really great alternative to Samsung crapware.
I heard you stole a seat from someone at the conference?
How do you listen to music
Always on looks bland compared to others . I hope it can be customised
tailosive tech got his video demonetized because he said bad things about the pixel 2
Waiting for the lg v30 comparison excited to see vs with pixel xl 2 vs iphone 8, X and samsung galaxy note and 8s
Awesome Pixel 2!! Will it be available in Malaysia?
How the hell do you fumble with voice assistant? You literally just have to ask what song it is
Another question is why is Google not releasing a new tablet? I still have a Nexus 9 and would like a similar replacement that is all Google. Huawei makes great devices and may look at their tablets. I using a Mate 9 as a daily driver and it's still great. This is someone that bought the new Nexus device every year. I have not hopped on the Pixel wagon yet. Mate 9 was my Pixel XL.
Great video, I love your content you always do a great job. I have a quick question, Is the top bezel bigger than the bottom ? I don’t know if it’s my eyes or if it is.  thanks
Out of all of the reviews i watched, this is definitely one of the best videos. Very informative.
It looks like a note 8 fugly clone
That was cool! Your good at these videos!! (Props) Also you have some good information!! Hope some one who needs it wins your giveaways I want but people need
Can you please make a batman or nightwing theamed gaming setup because I would love to see that?!?!?!!!????!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????!
does it has status light??
Am I the only one that likes how the smaller pixel 2 looks? I mean honestly I'm in it for the front facing speakers, great software experience and optimization. I'm also tired of phablets as well so there's that.
the smaller one has only oled, the bigger one has poled
we want camera comparisons!! like if u agree
No. Only LG phones have a 18:9 aspect ratio, that's why the top and bottom bezels are bigger. The s8 and note 8 have 18,5:9 displays, thus utilizing more of the space on the front
Did anyone else notice something strange at 3:09-3:10 with the blur that it applied in the third portrait shot where he was standing _behind_ the camera? It looks like it kept him in focus but blurred the camera out. :/ Technically both he and the camera should be in focus while everything in the background is blurred. I'm guessing it's probably because the machine learning looks for a human and keeps that in focus while making everything else blurry.
Easily the best preview on the Pixel 2 and 2 XL! Still on the fence whether to get the Pixel 2 or 2 XL.  I have a red iPhone 7 plus, but not a fan of the size.  The smaller Pixel 2 would be perfect, but will the dated look bother me - hmmm
Ok this might sound dumb but what’s the difference between usb 2.0 and usb 3.0
the smaller pixel 2 has an AMOLED panel not a POLED
Apple: We got the ugliest phone ever. Google: Hold my beer
Can i get that iphone 8 please i still got a iphone 5s , my instagram is vstacks_
What about HDR 10 or Dolby Vision support? Google didn't say a word about it.
Lol evidently you need to memorize more of your music library. :P
Instead of making the thing thinner, google could implement a headphone jack, wireless charging, maybe a better battery and the camera wouldnt be sticking out..
The phone isn't that impressive unless you're into stock android. Its like all the reviewers are forced to say positive things about the device. If any othe OEM released a phone with similar features they'd butcher it. They practically did already tho... HTC, Bixby button etc.
These phones are way better than the iPhone 8
Any of you guys think this phone beats the iPhone x? It has a pretty fair price
im gonna have to try it out myself too. the way it sounds is that google blew apple out of the water given what has been revealed in the past few weeks. if i heard right then pixel 2 has fast charing straight from the box, nothing additional to buy?! wow!
Pro-tip: Better sound quality with Bluetooth on Android O is already possible. Thank you Sony. Activate developer options and you will see the new LDAC codec as selectable, which allows audio streaming up to 990kbps. You can also now select the sampling rate and sample size.
So savage to blur out that other guy (his army is coming to get you)
I have an s8, I feel like getting these phones isn't really an upgrade. But your getting fast updates, pure Android experience but no headphone jack, no face or iris scanner, less water resistance..... Decisions decisions.....
Does both phones have RGB notification light or not? I cannot find a concrete information anywhere.
Kinda Blue = Manatee. Come one Google, get on point with the color names.
The phone sounds great but I don't think the display looks that appealing, it looks washed out. The tech in the phone sounds amazing!
so the only complaints i see on this phone are with looks and headphone jack. So like, the least important aspects of a phone are what people complain about. LoL
I’m wondering which one is better between LG v30 and pixel2 XL in term of daily performance.
That’s a lit phone
Great informational review. Like always, great video.
Astute watchers will ponder whether he got coffee with Kyle or not...
This phone looks like a winner. Sure, it has a little bit of bezels, but it’s functionality and camera make up for it...And that unlimited photo/video cloud storage. Hyped.
Fantastic video ! I'm not even going to buy the Pixel but I enjoyed this. Thanks.
No headphone jack🤔 I thought they liked that thing.I guess they’ll be copying Apple from now on.
The normal one would look and prob just feel alot better with curved edges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is coming from a g6 user
It's called a polarizer my dude
please someone tell me the diference betwen this and the samsung s8. i mean even google lens= bixby vision
Why is the flash and the camera swapped on some, but Normal on others?
Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel. Perhaps also test some native usbc headsets and Bluetooth options so we can get a better understanding of sound quality across the different options we now have.
The front panel on the Pixel 2 looks really cheap compared to the XL.
I'm buying! Was going for the V30 but saw it today at Verizon and it's much wider than i thought. The V30 wasn't a very comfortable fit in my hand.
Honestly, i dont really like the new design i kind of like the old design better but thats just how i feel
Best thing is the front firing speakers 👍
XL looks ok, but Pixel is really meh~ 2015 looking. First iPhone then Pixel, I don't appreciate they are doing this. Just give us the best only!
Definitely looking forward to the in depth review. Also get a hold of Google's new headphones and do a review on them.
Honestly if you’re upgrading from an older phone with big bezels then the bezels on the smaller pizel won’t be a big deal. I just got an IPhone 8 Plus and I’ve never been like “wow this phone is so unwieldy”
Why do people keep whining about no headphone jack? Like really it has 2 stereo speakers, the reason for a headphone is to make it sound louder or to stop people from hearing what you hear, if you use headphones to make it louder, you don't have to now because of those 2 stereo speakers
I can’t wait to get my hands on this phone.
I have the first Google pixel and it's utter garbage, so im definitely not getting either of these.
Shit... You had me till The removal of the headphone jack :(
I am excited about Pixel 2 XL, but damn, I live in Latin America, and here, they don't sell those phones.\nFor Google, we are so poor and we do not cover their needs, that's why we aren't gonna see Google in a near future.\nGreetings from Mexico City, Mexico.
Blah blah blah. If you want great camera, get a DSLR.
I'm I the only one who doesn't get the sudden obsession with bezel size?
No headphone jack, No micro SD card slot, Not water resistant = Pass
Well that was very disappointing. When I saw Google mocking Apple for removing their head phone jack i thought this would ensure the jack to stay in the pixel 2.   CONS: No head phone jack, added camera hump, thick bezels are my deal breakers. I'll stick to my Nexus 6P for another year.
The XL is obviously the cream of the crop.\n\niPhone X is essentially an upgraded app launcher with nothing new to offer except a $1,000 price tag and a rediculously ugly unibrow. Oh, and fast charging that will cost you an extra $49 to unlock.\n\nS8 with TouchWiz, Bixby and bloatwear? (need I say more?) yaaaaaaawn ..no thanx.\n\nV30? Don't know why this phone is even in the conversation. I know you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but the fact that it looks like a cheap plastic piece of crap doesn't help.\n\nAnyway.. I think the Panda XL will be the one most sought after, after all.. it is the sexiest.\nWhat do you guys think?
Thank God I got to see him live this year, loved his music for decades.   We lost one of the pillars of great music.
Rock the house then slip out the back door, peacefully, one week later. #lifegoals \nRest in peace Tom. Thank you SO MUCH for the music and memories.
Thank you Tom petty for the wonderful music you made for us ! You are truly one of the greatest musician ever !
Grieving. We were at the Thursday show. It makes me sad everytime I think about it.
Drove to the Hollywood Bowl at 16 in 1965 to see Dylan and the band. Very fitting that Tom would play his final concert here. Sort of wraps up our generation. Thanks Tom for all the great music you gave us!!
I am regretting I never got to see him this last tour! :( Hopefully they will release one of the concerts on DVD/Bluray etc.
What a wonderful capture of truly one of the great artists of our time,R.I.P. Mr. Petty, you will be missed!  P.S. Did anyone catch him limping off at the end? Any thoughts on that?  Thanks!
OMG I can't believe this
Wow.  You just never know when your last gig is coming.  What great music you've made, Tom Petty!   Thanks for all the great sing-a-longs!
His last full Monday on this planet.  RIP and thanks for the decades of memories and storytelling.
knowing now what was to happen, he looked very tired and winded. Wish I could go back in time and get him help. Thank you to you and the band for many years of wonderful entertainment! Blessings.
We live in a world with true idiots and without a doubt morons 130 dislikes you have to be fucking kidding me????
So grateful to have seen you on July 2nd. We are not ready to let you go, Tom.
So sad, just saw them at Summerfest.  Great video.
Thanks for the memories Tom . So many Summers of looking forward to you and Seger coming to pine knob in Clarkston Michigan . The parties on the hill. Late 70s and early 80s were the best of times . Glad I was a part of all of it. You made history and will be remembered as a artist with raw talent and pure class RIP.
Apart from this happening when he was 86, no other better way to go out.
Just amazing evening!! Rest in peace, Tom Petty..:) Thank you for the music..
Thanks so much for sharing this. One of the few who was about the love and not a gimmick.
To the person who put this on YouTube. Thank you so so much.\nHe was such a LEGEND! & still is!\nMissed already.
Very few artists in any genre of music have the opportunity to finish 40 years of work on top of their game as Petty was here.  It was a fitting end for a great artist.  He will be missed but not forgotten as long as rock is remembered.
Thanks for the Great conversation back in '07 in Malibu about old guitars and amps! God bless you Tom!!
To the end - TP - Peace ~
I hope he wasn't in too much pain.  Beautiful last song to a wonderful life and career.  He touched many lives.  R I P. Sir....😇
tom  was a great musician- one of a kind -aaron-god bless you!!
Tom i will always remember you .. RIP
Rest In Peace, Tom. Thank you for an amazing treasure trove of music.
God speed Tom Petty. You will be missed sorely.
Best of the best, RIP sir.
is this really the last song?
Thank you for this.
It´s sad to know he´s gone but it´s awesome to see him playing practically until the end. Now he´s a legend and will always be. Long life to Tom Petty.
Did not know him, but feels like I lost my best friend. You will always be in my heart. Thank you.
It's like he knew that was going to be his last show.
Just watched Running Down A Dream on Netflix and it really made me realize that this guy really was a stud, and belongs in the same category with the best of em.  He stood up to record company's, and anyone when he thought something was BS.  I can now totally see why he was so respected by George Harrison, Bob Dylan, and so many rock icons that were the pioneers of rocknroll as we know it.  We lost a great man!
Life is short.  Get it done.
Oh man, it's so great for posterity's sake that this was recorded. Nice.
Thank you for 40 years of a really great time.....as if he was saying goodbye
What a legend love him and his wonderful band!
Thanks for the music Tom. May you rest in peace.
Go rest tommy.You were a good man.
Miss this great talent of our time.
5:48 Signs were there. He should've got checked out.
Tom Petty , sad loss ,saw him performing Knebworth Park uk 1978.
I wouldn't expect anything LESS than a PERFECT SONG to end with!!! RIP Tom!!! You achieved legendary status when You were still here!!! :)
His music will carry me on for the rest of my life. He'll be missed as a huge void in music has happened. This hurts but I am also grateful for the Heartbreakers to have been there for us for so many years, so many generations. All because Tom did music his way and without compromise.  Thank-you Tom!  Prayers of love and comfort to your family.
way to young to leave this world. rip
sounds like he knew it was coming
BRUCE JENNER ..HE IS AN AMERICAN  GIRL?
RIP Tom, thank you for all the hard times your music got me through. 😔
Go rest high on that mountain, you dear sweet man. We here in Gainesville will love you forever.
No, Tom & company.  THANK YOU.  Thank you for all the amazing music you've given us for the past 41 years.  Now, Rest In Peace. 🎤🎸👍
Thanks Tom for bringing us so many memorable songs.  Thanks
Sometimes a person comes along that has this thing. A lot of people can feel it but don't know what it is. I'd be lying if I said I knew what it was called... He had it. I think it is like this, if you do it right, everything you touch becomes art.
Tom, you looked so good, so healthy, what happened? 😞😞😞
R.i.p . Thanks for the memories.
Another artist gone that I never got to see live. Damn shame, I loved Tom Petty.
Out the in door...wow  RIP
That guitar is worth a shitload of money now.
I housesat and dog sat a month or two ago,  for my granddogs while their Auntie and her Mom went to see Tom Petty I think Sacramento CA.
Funny how he puts his hand over his heart, and staggers, as if to say One more will kill me 5:53 or My heart couldn't take one more.
I'm almost 69 years old and I said there is just one more person I want to see in concert and that was Tom Petty. Unfortunately it will never happen now. I can and will still enjoy his music though.
Feel really bad that he said he was going to spend time with his grandchild after the tour was over, but he never got the chance. That said, this video really shows how touring and years of chain smoking and H took its toll, and took this gentle man way too soon. \nHe looked like he had one foot in the grave here, but he still gave his last drop for his fans.
how far right was that.far far far far right I think he said.that is far!
Is that a completely grey Ron Blair or another guy?
Saw him this summer in Hyde Park. Great concert. Great emotion throughout! Thanks for the music!
He had a good run.  Pieces of him are wrapped around bits of our lives... forever.
Ill repute does a great version of this song.
Thanks so much for posting!  Can't even believe he's gone.  RIP.  He looks and sounds terrific here.  Still in shock.  Loved by all.
Thank you Tom Petty for your funky spirit, sense of humor, amazing\nStorytelling in song, your generosity to your fellow humans, and for leaving it all out there every time. And for creating and nurturing one of the best bands of our generation.
I will miss you my dear old friend .. Rest in Peace .. Tommy ...
Thank you for some really great music over the years Tom, sadly missed. R.I.P.
one of the best..........your music lives on.........Rest in Peace Mr. Petty
They all left that stage with no idea that it was over.
Great post thanks. Talk about an American original.  Tom Petty was it. RIP
Fuck me what a way to go \nPlaying with your band then die  \nA week later . Tom petty I we all love you
And a fender 12 to play on. amazing
Blessings to him and all of his loved ones.
Rest amongst the wild flowers.
Always been a fan since the 70s,  but he looked like he was going to have a heart attack on stage.
1st rock star I  had the pleasure to know (1981)\nSuper CooL guy!
RIP Tom Petty.  Thank you for 40 years of great music.
I really hope we don't find out he was doing coke at his age.
R.I.P. TO THE GREATEST EVER!!!
people please wake up tom cant hear you  hes dead  when we die its over   you dont go to a better place  thats wishful weak minded thinking
Kind thoughts to his family. Thank you for sharing him with us all these years.
Too soon. 😞
RIP Tom!
I love him 😔
Love love love love love!!!!!!
RiP
R.I.P
RIP TOM PETTY
Thanks Tom. Mean it.
Fabulous till the end
what a loss.
Rock on Tom !
thanks Tom
C he
Does not look good at all. I think a hospital is more appropriate than this stage.
Just think - he was worth somewhere between $80 and $100 million - so he wasn't doing this for the money.  He was doing it because he loved it and, I daresay, for the fans.
Monopoly guy is great but what does that equifax CEO shine his head with?
This video missed the best part. When he wipes his brow with a stack of money.
Wonderful work.
I am so relieved he had a Monocle... I thought for a moment he would fail but HE DID NOT
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
How did I do guys?
quality troll
This is amazing.  \nAnd this man is fucking HERO.
Oh this makes my day.
That monocle though!!!
this dude is my spirit animal
When the monocle came out .......dead
That's a woman btw
The hero we need
That person is a Female, get yo facts straight y’all
hello there, fellow redditors
This dude's head is brighter than my future
Plot twist... that's actually a woman in that costume
Seem to be two kinds of people here, those remember him having a monocle and people tha think it is some sort of conspiracy! It is not an effect, you just never played the game!
And a new hero emerges.
This is world class trolling
Thanks for the Free Parking. -_o
The fact that the disguise didn't raise any alarms says it all. He fit right in. 😂😂
This is trending???
“Hello, my name is Mr. Snrub.”
Get that woman a tv show!
now that's how you fucking protest,  take notes people
Is there a black man behind the monopoly guy?
This is the reason why I want to attend these meetings
Hahahahahah this should be #1 on trending that's epic
The monocle puts this over the top.
And another thing we will not honor the flag it was not for black people because it's the same as the Confederate flag. It's just a raggedy piece of material. White people tell us all the time we're not American. So don't expect us to honor the flag with the racist song that go with it
fun fact!!!!\n*the monopoly guy doesn't wear a monocle*\n👀
i didn't not know wade wilson was here.
Thumbnail looks like a bald Ryan Reynolds
Modern Breaches, a why to say we sold your information to the highest bidder.
And YOU must be the Monopoly guy...thanks for the free parking.
But what if they hired her to distract you from the real issue??
Jews control America's Federal Reserve and foreign policy.
Just because they wear a top hat and cardboard mustache and wipe their brow with fake money doesn't mean they are trolling... 😃\nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I wish for a interruption. But anyway nice job !
Hilarious and original!! Love it.
He's practicing for Halloween x)
I have never laughed so hard at something in my life before. Hahaha, well done good sir. Well done.
This is how Trump got elected people dont know how to do their jobs and screen and check peoples identity properly hes probably a russian spy
It’s not just the freeze part.
These guys sell all their shares prior to making their WE BEEN HACKED announcement and yet no charges for fraud? This infuriates me.
Apparently the Mandela Effect suggests the Monopoly guy NEVER wore a monocle? What do YOU remember?
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
He had a monocle in a different reality I'm 100% sure its the Mandela effect in action.
I guess everyone's doing a side show now too
Now this... this is nice.
Crazy part is thats no troll. Thats actually Sam Walton founder of Walmart reinvigorated and given a new body to live out immortality.
Best laughs I have in weeks :'D
This is why I joined the internet.
Wait the monopoly guy never had a monocle though
if this is considered trolling then the women's march was a successful protest
This is the best thing ever
It’s funny that this will be trending and plenty of people will write comments here but how many of you will actually call or write your representatives to protect your life and livelihood?\n\nTake 30 seconds to contact them: \nCopy and paste:\nPlease federally limit personal and small business liability for fraudulently used identifying information and replace the social security number system.\n\nThen sign it and mail it your representatives.\n\nAlternatively google your state for your senator/house representative and call them at the number on their website to say the same as the above message.\n\nIf legislation is properly implemented this could literally save your life, your child’s college saving, your family’s lives or your local small business for an investment of 30 seconds today.\n\n(Flagrantviolations.com)
so funny I forgot to laugh
I looooove him. Thank you dude!
Thats really funny
Mr pennybags doesn't wear a monocle
lmao
Lmao
lmfao
damn that, Pennybags! lol

wilford brimley's office please
Fucking NORMIES, REEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nothing will happen to Equifax.

TOP KEK!
Shenanigans mah boy!! Shenanaigans I say!

Legend
Oh and by the way black people. Notice how for 50 years they've been telling us where 13% of the population think about it they've been telling us that for 50-60 years don't you think we have grown by now
Yeah, right flexing .
Iconic
IMPOSTER
This. Is. Youtube. Trending.
Savage 🤣
Uncle pennybags doesn't have a monocle.
Equifax trolled over 3 million people out of 160 million dollars, LUL.
:-)
at least it was a humorous protest 👏
Promoted by Youtube
That guy’s head is brighter than my future...
Hey YouTube black people will not be silent. You will not shut us up. We are God's chosen people from negroland no such thing as a white Jesus. Black people don't support banana Republic they want to try to tell people black people what to do with their hair
Why does YouTube say a woman  dresses as the Monopoly guy... That's a guy in the video

ah yes very real
I posted a video last week about my love for second hand shopping! If you didn't see that, then here is the link for you! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNjqAaNNgcw <3
When will you be posting your hoarding documentary?
I absolutely love listening to you speak. Your voice is so beautiful! You did well on your purchases good job!!
make a video showing how you sterilize jewelry?
Floral dress fits you like a glove.   \nYou look lovely in all the clothes you've chosen. Love the haul vlogs.x
Has anyone ever told you you look like lady Diana? At least in my opinion haha. Lovely video as always by the way :)
I love these videos and i really want to go to some charity shops and vintage stores and see if i can find any gems!!
I love the floral dress on you :)
i need a white girl with your voice omg
I used to do pricing in charity shop and it all goes on brands, the better the brand and the hight quality/condition the higher the price
I love this video! I recently purchased a cardigan from New Life for £8.99 (I know it's a lot) but it turned out to be River Island and would normally cost £55!!!
you reminds me sooo much to lady diana, you're a really gourgeus woman and i love your videos, love from colombia!
the floral dress and the outfit that you wear when you show your watch are my favorites! I'm glad you found such nice things :-)
You look so good in that tight floral dress! You have an amazing figure! <3
I own the small sleeping cat (or rather a similar one), but paired with a bigger mommy cat!! Maybe that's why it was such a good bargain :)
Lovely vid, and such a pretty gal <3
I love the dresses!! You have a great style! I have loved watching you grow and change over the years. You're so lovely Bex!
You truely found some amazing pieces, the dresses suit you so well! I also loove the pants (and the outfit in general) you are wearing in the splitscreen when showing off the watch <3
The charity shops in my area are horrendously expensive :( They sell 2nd hand Primark clothes for more money than Primark charges. \nI loved watching this video :) You are great at modelling!
This has actually inspired me to try thrifting! X
I love aaaall of the things. Beautiful. You look fantastic
Why is this on Trending at 9K views?
Thank you for this video! I love thrift-stores and secondhand clothes; I enjoyed this video a lot, and I would love to see more of these in the future!
YAY <3\namazing video! I LOVE thrifting, most of my clothes is also preloved and i love it.
Those clothes look great on you Beckie!
Cute cat. What happen to your right hand palm?
You say you live very far from minimalism with your hoarding and collecting, but I'm glad you offset that with thrifting!
I think selling a pair of 60 or 80 pound shoes for 20 pounds is still a good deal\nI don't expect those to be sold for 5 pounds
I recommend St Helena hospice they have a wide range of specialist charity shops around Essex not the cheapest but have seasonal sales.
So many of these are seriously so cute.  You may not follow trends (neither do I...why bother) but you seem to have a good sense for things that look good on you.  I love thrift stores!  Found many of my favorite articles of clothing there.
your jewelry is always amazing!
you sound a bit  breathless hope u are okay
I love the necklace that you're wearing!
I don’t normally watch haul videos, but as someone who when growing up frequently visited thrift shops, I find this quite interesting. You should make more.
Looks like you found some pretty good things. I love the blue skirt and shoes, super cute 😊
I am so jealous of your finds!  Anytime I try out charity/thrift shops I rarely find anything good.  You have a great wardrobe filled with so many lovely finds.
You look amazing and have great modelling skills.  We have confidence in you. :)
I hope you do more hauls in the future! xxx
Lady Rebecca is absolutely beautiful...I dare anyone to object...
I would love more of these videos
That blue dress looks amazing on you. I don't really like wearing second hand clothes, it's just the way I am, but I do get DVDs, old computer games and books from charity shops. DVDs especially, since I am old-fashioned and like physical copies of my films. If you're patient and don't mind being a few years behind the film industry , you can find them in their original plastic cover for no more than £2.99, depending on the area and shop. Jigsaws as well. You never need to buy a jigsaw at full retail price either. The other day I found a sealed copy of SimCity 3000 for £1.25 from a Cancer Research shop.
OMG I used to live in front of the Isle of Wight 😍
I live in Portsmouth so it was great to see someone else loving some of my local places :)
This is such a great video! I would love to see another one of these! Greetings and love from Germany!❤
Hello from the Isle of Wight! I'm a bit of a clothes hoarder and my things have been donated to charity shops all over the island - it's funny to think that you were probably flicking through rails full of my donations, haha!
One of my favorite thrift stores where I live is called Lifelong and they support HIV/AIDS resources in the area in many ways including hosting testing days. I enjoy knowing my already cheap purchase is going to have a bigger impact than shopping fast fashion
I didn't realize shoes could be that inexpensive. I don't think I own a pair of shoes that cost me less that $100.
Beckie, there's a woman working in my local supermarket who looks exactly like you!! You're both beautiful!
You're looking so well in your recent handful of videos. It's lovely to see.
Hey Beckie, I'd just like to recommend a series on the BBC Three YouTube channel, it's called Overshadowed. If you haven't watched it already, then give it a go! I love it and I'd also love to see someone review it! Love the new video and love you, stay strong, beautiful xx
I never watch hauls but I really enjoyed this! I'd love to see a favourites video :)
I love the floral dress and the coral blazer, especially together! ❤️ Really I love all the things you’ve shown today; you have such good luck with thrifting!
I went to Portsmouth too! It's lovely there :)
That floral dress is gorgeous on you. It shows off your figure and I really love it on you. You look beautiful.
I love your patterned trousers where did you get them from?
ahh i love thrifting too! it's like treasure hunting! regular shopping is exhausting and dreary for me but thrifting is always like a little adventure 😊
You dress very well, one thing I hate in modern fashion is Grey baggy tracky   bottoms, they are awful.
You don't need to be completely bound to the steasons.
Wow, that charity superstore must've been a dream... I bet they had to drag you out of there at closing time, haha! :D
Theres nowt wrong with your modelling skills 😉\nThe floral and the blue dress are excellent finds. \nMy weakness in charity shops tends towards pewter tankards (the older the better) and cufflinks (more pairs than you can shake a stick at), with the odd tweed jacket thrown in if its the right size/colour/pattern and make lol
YES. Before I even watch! LOVE!
Loved everything on you.
The dresses at 4:50 and 6:30 really suit you :D
You should do more fashion videos I loved this x
I love thrifting as well we have a big shop where the proceeds go to charity some are last seasons clothes from high street stores and other stuff is secondhand. It's amazing what you can find I buy clothes secondhand on eBay too, as student I'm always trying to save money.
Beckie I love you so much ❤️
I love the watch and mint skirt. After watching this I realized we have similar taste in clothing :)
I loved this! Such a wonderful, positive video 💕
I love thrifting and I would love to see more videos on this topic! Great video! I love all your videos!
More videos like this please!!!!
The blue dress is my favorite, but I also love the earrings and choker that you have on! Blue is my favorite color and was the color of my bridesmaids dresses at my wedding 13 years ago! My daughter has always had a hard time finding shoes. She also has skinny feet, especially at her heels. Finding her shoes when she was a kid was an absolute nightmnare.
That floral dress fits so well it looks tailored. You look fantastic
Absolutely nothing wrong with your modeling skills, Rebecca. Very nicely presented. The blue at 4.50 looked great! Your 10+ years of making YT videos is indeed showing. You're doing an excellent job filming and editing!
I like the wooden cat, My GFs grandpa used to carve little monkeys out of peach pits for her and now that he is gone they feel so precious. I wonder who carved your cat.
You look absolutely stunning in those blue dresses!
Wow I have that same wooden cat!! I wonder where they originally came from... 😮
Good Morning from America Rebecca <3
I love it!

Your voice is so damn calming.
Wow you're super Cute
Beautiful beckie I LOVE YOU beckie🍎
You look very elegant.
You're trending! Well done :)
Everything is so cute 💖💖💖
Te diré eres hermosa desde una lengua que no entiendes xD
When did you go to the Isle of Wight? I live there, the charity shops are quite expensive which is a shame. :)
the Thrift Shops are so expensive where I live...
Terrible modeling skills.  You take that back!\nYou are amazing!\nAll the outfits were spot on!\nI've said it to you before. You should pursue modeling and/or spokesmodel jobs.\nYour voice is incredible. That smile. To die for.\nThat hairstyle. Awesome! No one would know about your condition.\nDoes anyone else out there think the same thing?\n\nGreat video Beckie!\n👍👍
I love the trousers you were wearing when you showed the watch, but all of the thrifted stuff looks great too
Beckie, I feel you my feet are exactly the same too long and thin , I walk weird and i have small ankles so most shoes are too big around the ankle .
I love the blue skirt ! Also, you look amazing un the blue dress !\nHave a nice day Rebecca !
I wish I could thrift like you do! But as someone who’s considered ‘plus size’ for most clothes it’s harder to find clothes at all
I love bracelets but it is hard to find a bracelet that fits without running up and down my wrists cause I have thin wrists like you.
Are charity shops like antique stores? Sorry I'm not too familiar with the British lingo :P hahaha I've just never heard them called that! Great video as always Rebecca! :)
Hmm that wooden cat is brilliant and has given me an idea to try to make a dog version
Did you say Clacton and Jaywick?!!!!

Watching Rhett and Link suck hot sauce off a gloved finger because pornhub was down. (I'm sorry)
There's a Jack in the Box 30 minutes away from my house, which also happens to be right by my favorite park. My favorite thing to do is drive up there, chill at the park, then get 4 tacos from JITB 😂 I live in Ohio so they're not common at all, but I love their tacos.
I'm the best!\nNo, I'm the best!
as you can see we cant dunno why that cracked me up
You forgot to go over ur answers.

The amount of times Link left Rhett hanging in this episode XD
Wouldn’t Sauce Boss be better?
I like it better when they tell them the right answer after they answer so they can reevaluate their whole lives.
As you can see, we can't\n\n\n\n\nI should put that on a plaque
How about PB CUP taste test?
I hope everything is okay between the two of them. I don't know why but something seems off after watching some of their videos. Is that just me??

If i had to respond to the qtmba, i would have to say it would have to be  hugh jackman. That's right i said something that was counter intuitive, but i wouldn't mind having a fatherly mother.
Love me some jack in the box tacos
Gross finger sauce dispenser.

I think the weird thing is, is that I watch your videos at night but you say, good mythical morning 😒 its kinda odd
Judge
Why Link threw up a gang sign at 3:45?
you and link my mom and dad haha
Link: [due to mix of love & guilt, refuses to pick a celebrity mom]\nRhett: [without skipping a beat] I pick Cher\nXDD
Wouldn't the rubber glove mess with the taste
You should do a powdered food taste test, like if you agree.
Rhett looks like Burger King with that Crown

Hi
I heard Rhett chewing
벌칙인가요? ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
이거 완전맛있었는데..
둘이 의견 바뀌는 거 너무 웃기다ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
영국남자님 전에 삼목초등학교 왔잖아여 저그 초등학교 학생입니다 안녕하세요 ㅎㅎ
저 소스 포장 딸기잼보면 저렇게 되있던데 영국에 없어요??
옛날 불량식품 (화이트 초콜릿 + 초콜릿 ) 작은 숟가락으로 섞어서 먹는 거랑 비슷하네요. /
미친 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ한국어 뭐냐 존나 잘하네여 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 오른쪽 ㅋㅋㅋ
*Sponsored by Mcdonald’s
초콜릿빅맥 흠...인터뢰스팅
초콜릿에 마약 들어있는듯
완전 웃김 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
보통 일반적인 한국 사람들도 서양 음식인 감자튀김에 서양음식인 초콜렛을 섞는 끔찍한 상상은 안하지 저건 창의적인게 아니라 괴랄한거니까
맛있을...것 같ㅇ...ㅏ.... 저게 바로 단짠단짠인가..
지금 jtbc2에서 영국남자 올리아버님편 방송하네요 !!세상에나 tv에도 나오구 대박 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ항상 잘보고있어용
조쉬님 즐거운 추석 보내세요!
조쉬!! 한국에는 김치초콜렛이 있어요ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ!!!!!! 평소에는 잘 구할 수 없지만 인천공항에 있는 양반김 파는 매장에 김치초콜렛도 같이 팔아요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ!!! 사는사람이 거의 없어서 인지 구석에 잘 안보이는데 있긴해요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 한번 영국으로 돌아갈때 먹어보세요 ㅋㅋ!
어우....진짜 싫다. 저런 조합은 너무 싫어 으으...
초코 후라이 진짜 맛있는데ㅠㅠ
딘은 볼수록 한국남자
I’ve been binging on your channel! Love it!! Can’t believe I haven’t found yous sooner (I’m from the UK too!!)
Their Korean is really good
프라이스는 시럽 조금 뿌리고 소프트아이스크림 얹어먹으면 환상입니다. 단짠의 끝판왕이에요. 보장!!\nJust pour little bit of syrup and soft ice cream. It’s marvelous. I guarantee!!
역시조엘ㅎㅎ웃음소리되게귀여워요!!취향이독특한가..??ㅋㅋ
감자튀김에 초콜릿은 아닌듯ㅠ
chocolate and waffle fries would probably be tasty
I usually just dip my fries in the chocolate sundae sauce 😂
조엘 어깨 괴물인걸,,
시리얼 특집 ㄲㄲ
That is absolutely the worst combination ever!! You guys must have been hungry. You ate so much of it.🤣
이건좀아닌거같다
6:45 억양에 치이고 갑니다
김치초콜릿 있는데...
JTBC에서 영국남자 하네 몰랐다...
I think at the end all of you got sugar high 😂
아니에요..우리도 이상해요 ㅠㅠ 기껏 한정판 만들어서 저런러나 내놔...
오 맞는말같아요 라이스푸딩같은거 생각도 못해봤는데!
먹어보지는 않았는데 그렇지 김치초콜릿 있는 거로 알고 있습니다. 김치 무슨 행사에서 나왔다고 하더라고요. 전 개인적으로 먹어보고 싶네요.
생각보단 맛있었는데 너무달아서 차라리 케찹이 더 나은것같아요 글구 초콜릿 너무 적은것 같아요! 초콜릿 묻은 곳을 다 먹고 나면 just 감자튀김을 먹어야되서 ㅠ
Me and my friends must be weird we would always eat chocolate with our chips from the fish and chip shop ahha 😂😅
조쉬님! 해리포터와 관련된 영국 도시나 그런 곳 가서 리뷰(?) 찍어주셨으면 좋겠어요😊 영국을 가지 못하기 때문에 대리만족이라도 정말 하고싶네요 !
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 로이스 초콜릿감자칩 맛있어요!
저거 진짜 맛없는데... 리뷰보고 드시지 ㅋㅋㅋ
조엘님의 리액션 충분히 공감이 갑니다. 한국사람이  김치에 초콜릿 소스를 뿌려서 먹는 느낌이었을 겁니다. 뇌에서 거부감이...

맛이 정말 별론가보네요; 옛날에 먹어본 초콜릿 돈까스는 맛있던데요!뜨거운 초콜릿소스가 위에 끼얹어져있었죠. 초코덕후라 취향이었을지도 모르지만요ㅋㅋ
난 와플감자는 좋아하고..\n초콜릿 뿌리는건 안좋아하는 편^^;\n\n영국남자팀.. 늘 즐겁게 촬영해줘서 고마워요!
사람마다 입맛이 다르잖아~ㅎㅎ
그렇게까지 깊게 생각하진않을 듯 그냥 단짠 좋아 !!!!!!! 단짠 대세!!!!!!!! 이러다가 오 감튀는 짜고 초콜릿은 다니깐 얘들 섞으면 대박일듯 하고 걍 한듯
영국남자 맛있는 녀석들에 나와도 좋을듯
엥..먹을만하던데...근데 건강이 나빠지는 기분이 드는 맛이긴 함.  물론 맥날에서 건강해지는 맛이 있겠냐만은 초코감튀는 더욱 더.
홍어라던가 꼼장어라던가 해산물 편을 즐겨봤습니다! 슬슬 과메기에 도전해 보시는건 어떨까요?\n과메기...저는 못 먹는 과메기....대리만족하고 싶습니다ㅠ~ㅠ
한국 10대들의 유행어들을 배워보는 시간을 가져보는 것도 좋을 것 같아요! 줄임말 같은 경우도 한국은 ㅇㄱㄹㅇ, ㅂㅅ 처럼 자음만 적을 수도 있잖아요. 영어와 한국어의 유행어들을 비교해보는 시간을 가져봐도 좋을 것 같아요!
영상항상잘보고가요\n!!ㅋㅋㅋ\n저초코감튀맥날꺼궁금하네요...\n어제어떤푸드트럭에서저걸'악마의감자'인가?암튼고딴식으로팔길래사먹었는데진짜악마...초코가맛없긴처음..쏘덴졀
엄마가 먹는것갖고 장난치지말랬는데 이젠 식당에서 장난치네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
너겟하고 빅맥에도 섞어먹을줄몰랐닽ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
한국 빅맥케이스 좋아요.. 인도네시아는 몇년 전부터 빅맥케이스가 치킨너깃케이스랑 비슷해 졌는데 햄버거 집어들면 양상추가 후두둑하고 떨어져요.. 진짜 귀찮아.. 휴...
근데 김치 초콜렛 있어요!!! 다음 도전은 이걸로 해보시면 어떨까요 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
미니언즈 바나나콘도 그렇고 와플 후라이도 그렇고 이것도 다 제 취향에는 안 맞네요.. 뭔가 맥도날드 신메뉴는 거르게 됩니다 ^^;
로이스 초콜릿에 감자칩+초콜릿 있는데 일본 맥도날드에서 그걸 보고 오 이거 해볼까? 한국 맥도날드에서 어 이거 우리도 해볼까? 한것같아요ㅋㅋㅋ 이건 아니야...ㅠㅠ 로이스 감자칩 드세요
일본에서 파는 로이스 초콜릿칩 엄청 맛있어요!!! 맥주 땡기는, 단짠의 조화!!!!
추석 잘보내셨나요? 좋은 일 있으시던데, 오늘 티비보다가 JTBC2에서 영국남자 1회 재방송하더라구요 올리 아버님오셔서 삼합드시고 청계산 올라가신거 두편 연속 나오더군요 깜짝 놀랐어요 유투브보고 있는줄 알고 순간 착각해네요ㅋㅋ\n성공하셨네요\n축하드려요

JTBC2에서 영국남자 하던데 대~~박사건!!!
맥도날드에 초코 프라이 시키고 이거 봤는데.. 아직 배달안왔는ㄷ 어쩌면 좋나요..ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
얼마전에 jtbc에서 영국남자 영상나오던데 어떻게 된건가요?!
딸기, 초콜렛맛 뿌셔뿌셔가 금방 사라진 이유와 비슷한 느낌이겠죠ㅠㅠ

한국사람들이 외국인들이 한국피자먹고 역하다고 하는 영상보고 화내는거 보면 한국인들 진짜 하나만 생각하고 둘은 모른다는 생각든다. 조쉬가 말했듯이 한국사람들은 절대 김치에 초콜릿 안비벼 먹고 미국같은데에서는 그냥 중국음식이나 다른 아시아 음식과 함께 김치를 같이 파는 음식점 많다. 솔직히 그거 보면 얘네 아시아 음식에 대해 하나도 모르네 생각 할 수 있다. 서양인들도 똑같이 그렇게 생각 할수 있는데 우리는 그걸 이해를 못한다.
영국은 아니지만 미국에 있는 사이판 갔다가 왔어요 ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 미국마트에서 여러 과자 아이스크림도 많이 팔고 많이 보던 음식들도 있었는데 다 이 채널로 보면서 익숙해져서 실제로 과자들을 봤을때  크게 신기해하거나 당황하지 않은거가타요 ㅜㅜㅜ 무엇보다 진짜 남성분들 얼굴 잘생기시고 너무 착하셨어요ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ 하튼 감사하다구요 ♡♡♡ㅜㅜㅜㅜ
난맛있던데ㅜ초코소스 적어서 좀 짜증났음ㅜ
'식감'이란 단어가 나오고 난 생각보다 괜찮은데?란 한국어에 난 아닌데?로 바로 받아치는 영국인들이라니 ㅋㅋㅋ 볼수록 신기 ㅋㅋ어쨌든 저건 안사먹어야지
조쉬 한국가면 포장마차편도 찍어주세요!!!!! 궁금합니당 여러분의생각 ㅎㅎㅎㅎ 그리고 한번 쟈미나게 찍어주세요
음 우리나라식으로 해보자면 수정과에 밥말아 먹는 느낌인가
저 소스패키징 호주 세븐일레븐만 가도 흔히 볼 수 있어요.
광고에서 나오는것처럼 소스가 안나오네요
문득 드는 생각인데 영국남자님도 요즘 한창 핫하게 방송되는 어서와 한국은 처음이지에 고향친구들 데려와서 같이 노는모습 나왔으면 좋겠어요
댄이랑 한국먹방투어 시리즈 끝났나요...????? 그거만기다리고있는데 ㅠㅠ
달고 느끼하다는 느낌이었죠...
더블초코소스도 맛있지만 맥도날드감자튀김은 스위트칠리소스에 찍어먹는게 제일 맛있는듯
단을 보고있다가 생각이 났는데...\n한국의 전통주는 마셔보셨나요?\n마트나 편의점 같은곳에서 파는 소주가 아닌 \n안동소주, 이강주, 면천두견주, 한산소곡주 등등\n맛과 풍미가 가득한 전통주를 마셔보는 영상보고싶어요~^^\n지금까지와 다른 한국의 술맛을 느끼실수 있을겁니다\n아!! 상품화 되어있는거말고 기회가 된다면 직접 찾아가서 맛보는걸로~~~

Is LaVar Ball the worst sports parent ever?
As soon as joy starts talking they cut the video lol
So is the middle one like still around or we still treat him like meg?
Why is Molly always interrupting. He’s talking and just noisey her stupid ass thought into the convo
He is the best sports parent and he is in control of his own household. You people think that you can take control of others people's household and run your mentality game on Levar Ball but Levar is too strong of a Man for you to deal with mentally physically and emotionally.  These are his kids! Run your own  house!\n\nYou people want to see this Black man fail. Levar made a wise choice!
I'm a goat
I just want LiAngelo to take the NCAA by storm so that the media remembers he exists.
like most they be broke by the end~
Lebron's dad is the worst sport parent
If anybody wants a front row seat into Lavar’s parenting skills, watch Ball in The Family on Facebook or YouTube. He’s not what the makes him out to be.
LOL.. OMG White People worried about the education of Black Men.. LMAO I have seen it all now.
MOLLY, SHUT THE F UP!
6:08 - this chick just ask is lamelo okay with this?\nbruh, Lavar is his dad. Melo doesn't have to be okay with it but his trash ass has to accept that that parents have the last say lol stay in yo lane.
Wish I wasn't white
Lavar Ball is the G.O.A.T when it comes to sports dads.
When will Molly learn to let people talk and not speak over them? She does it all the time and it drives me absolutely crazy.
A beautiful wife he's been with for over 30 years two sons who are committed to UCLA and that are top recruits in the nation one son in the NBA all three of them won a state championship together Lonzo got his own Brand Lavar started I really wouldn't call that a bad parent
One would really have to question why that hatchet job of an article was even written by USA today. It's clear to me that someone is trying to put a target on this man's back.
Idk how yall feel, but i really like will cain on this show lol almost like the skip of the modern era.
So how is lavar the worst sport parent ever when lebrons Dad and other athletes parents weren’t even there growing up?
They cant say it so i will fuk that reporter and their opinion...done
He's not a bad dad, just an ANNOYING person.  Those are two different things.\nLavar is a legit dad... I just wouldn't hang out with him personally, lol.
Nancy better stay in her lane
The worst sports parents are the ones that chose not to be in their kids’ lives
One of your kids is an NBA PLAYER and you called the team that picked him. This man is the 🐐 leave him alone
he is the best parent imo
Nobody gives a fuck about your input Molly. Just wear something skimpy and shut the fuck up.
There should be a drone shot of Molly front and rear while the guys talk
LaVar a fool 😂, but no he’s done a lot for his family since they were kids let’s take a look. One is in the NBA already, Another one about to play for UCLA, the last one gots his own signature shoe!
Jealousy is apparent here and I would like to see these pundits children so we can compare and contrast.  Lavar is black and that's the problem period, non of the other stuff...ESPN reaching...Even Liberal whites secretly hate black people and wish for their demise...In a world gone mad are we really judging Lavar for being an outspoken parent and involved....Even liberal whites still want black men to check in with white authority before making a decision. Black men are not allowed to think independently, that's the real problem
This chick molly can never get a word in 😂😂
Fuck lavar ball. He ruins the image of basketball. His annoying ass just wants publicity. He's an egomaniac.
fuck nancy a woman cant say shit about a father
Worst sports parents that keep saying his son will never be good or things like that.
Let’s see hmmmm ....\n\n#1 Married to the same woman\n#2 All kids by the same woman\n#3 One son in the NBA and is a multi millionaire \n#4 One son attending UCLA\n#5 One son rank #7 best high school basketball player in America \n#6. None of his sons have a mug shot.\n#7. Started his own shoe and merchandise company \n#8 MAJOR AMERICAN ARTICLE NAMES THIS MAN THE WORST SPORTS PARENT IN HISTORY\n\nThey said the same thing about Venus and Serena Williams' dad and Tiger Woods' dad.... Do you see a pattern❓🤔 \n\n***
She's spot on.
NANCY NEEDS TO STAY IN HER LANE
Is it just me.. when this will cain guy starts to speak. I immediately turn this crap off..
Why does will Cain have a job
I don’t even think he’s obnoxious. I just think he’s a professional troll and knows how to take advantage of the media with his antics.
Wow just don't talk about LiAngelo
This is such BS. The kid is being home schooled for his last two years of high school. SO FUCKING WHAT? there are so many kids home schooled especially famous kids who go to school and it becomes a distraction because they are so famous. Y’all act like he’s not fuckin rich and they can get the best tutors and so on. People so busy worried about the wrong thing when they kids ain’t shit.. BBB
Well, it's funny limited resources but make it is classic white folk tales as they are extremely strict in the South especially if your a QB but whatever. Lavar is a marketing genius period!
I don’t hear these people complaining about the 1000’s of kids pulled from school to work in Hollywood etc. the problem is LaVar is a minority who happens to be outspoken, conservative, opinionated etc. hypocrites
Fuck them I wish lavar ball was my pops
LeMelo doesn't have a high basketball IQ compared to his brother. I don't think he will make it in NBA in the future. He just chucks bad threes and is awful on defense... It's probably best for him to be home schooled though considering how famous he is now.
lavar can do what he wants, its HIS kids ffs. wat business is it of the liberal sports media?
3:16 When you tell your girl you're not cheating yet she got screenshots of your Dms....
She better stay in her lane.
Him being there for his children automatically disqualifies what the fuck she's saying. There's plenty of deadbeat niggas who don't even know their child's name.
Molly u dumb bitch stfu with nobody gives a shit bout ur stupid point
Lamello is a celebrity now. He can't be at a regular high school. It's that simple. Too many distractions
Why are they talking about someone who isn’t even in the nba yet 😂 calm down and talk about actual professional sports players in the nba or nfl
Molly please stay in yo lane... And I aint apologizing like Cam Newton!
Whats wrong with creating your own brand? Should he have some other company exploit his son...i say marketing at it's finest
Why would First Take give this article so much TV exposure? Lavar is a genius and he know the new coach is on some BS. When you tell my son you want be shooting 50 times, instead of saying we going to have more ball movement and assist a game.
Max's hair got it's color back.
Ban will cain from first take
Russell Westbrook - I'll Be Champion Soon\nhttps://youtu.be/7HjB3xPjN60
BULLSHIT....Lavar is a great Father look at the results
Imagine LaMelo attending Chino Hills H.S... rolling up in his red Ferrari... music blaring... television camera distracting the other students from properly graphing a parabola in Algebra 2 class? Not to mention the envy and jealousy of the other boys as he (Melo) attends prom with 300 gold digging vixens... This could all lead to some serious issue ESPN and Sports Illustrated dim wits. Now, go THINK ABOUT IT!
Molly needs to shut the fuck up and stop trying to insert herself into the conversation. Nobody cares what she has to say
School really isn’t that important
Hmm lets go to ESPN for parenting advice... said no one ever.
the worse or perfect? I swear we can never win... If were unsuccessful its because we have no dad , we have a dad & now hes the worst...smh
Get off Lavar dick and let yo bitch get on it
“A lot of people would kill to have a father” -whatever the female hosts name is
i want to hear Kristine Leahy's comments on this. I havent heard anythign from her since she got put in her lane
Why Molly always feel like she has to yell her way in? 😂😂
Stephen A. Knows it all
I'm on that big baller shit forreal
LeBron James had no dad I would put his dad on that list Ball is fucking the game up and yt ppl are pissed
I'm pretty sure Julian Newman's father is a lot worse...
Worst sports parent ever? Sounds like a bunch of ignorant jealous people voted this.
Who the fuck is the washed up bitch who made that statement anyway. No one cares about her.
This probably coming from people who have no fathers
Lavar is doing fine with his whole family!!! I can give you a much better example of parents who screwed up their kid. Tiger woods parents! No normal kid grows up on a golf green. And at the end Tiger messed up his marriage and career.
If you guys watch their reality show called Ball in the Family, you'll see that lavar is the best father and husband you could possibly have
that is so STUPID to pull him out of high school, you should be learning at home to anyway
Lol half of all these black athletes had father's who ran away... I might not like his antics but to have those 3 kids who are as good as they are takes real parenting.
They want to build him up to break him down
Molly really needs to keep her mouth shut...always interrupting...she needs to follow Joy Taylor's example and only comment at the end of the segment....no one cares about her opinion...she is simply eye candy
The only thing i can say about lavar is that good or bad  i would be ashamed if he was my father
Why do people care how LaVar raises his kids SMDH worry about your own life
MOLLY SHUT UP!!! Please bring back Cari Champion 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The real problem is hes breaking all the traditions and restraints.... No shoe deal create your own.. Stream lining from a unknown highschool to a major college ..and now homeschooling and personal training instead of highschool ball
1) Not gonna lie the optics of crying about 2 coaches in a row, to the point of pulling the kid not only from the team but from SCHOOL...\nDoes seem a bit much\n\nDoesn't = worst ever but being 'real' it is a bit over the top, to yank the kid outta SCHOOL a month in...\nThe basketball team...ain't biology and math class\nI got ZERO problem if dude say my boy is done with THIS coach and thus squad BUT in all fairness and no offense to LaVar but how you all of a sudden 'qualified' to home school the boy, dawg 😂\n\nI mean, what's wrong letting the boy GO TO CLASS...Pops?\nPick him up at 3 o'clock and train... \nIf class time and homework wasn't getting in his way or Lonzo's way...why pull him from 2 years of school...\n\nI'd have LESS issue had they came back from the summer and said dude is just going train and forget about school altogether but to be REACTIVE about totally pulling him out of school over just the basketball coach is bush league overall as a REACTION, sorry that's child-like.\n\nHim and his wife NEVER home-schooled the first 2...why 'experiment' on the LAST kid's LAST 2 years of h/s over the b-ball coach....that's my issue\n\nDude could absolutely go the school and not PLAY for Chino High...whatever class time and homework time wasn't an issue before and hadn't been one for the first two so let's not go there and nobody's saying SCHOOL was in the way so x-ing out ALL school/educational development = unnecessary\n\nWhy all of a sudden, he needs what now all day training...No that over-reacting \nThe kid 'could' have been a 'student' at Chino AND trained privately for b-ball = not a problem\nBut pulling from chemistry, social studies and English class over THIS ish one month into Jr. year is (no offense) is chick-like, little crying girl-like to be 'real' with you.\nCertain decisions you map out properly, especially when it's your kid's actual childhood, they only get ONE...as an adult you can muck around for 2-3 years and say, man I messed that up, shoulda done this way I'ma change it up NEXT year but kids only get 1 Junior year, one shot at being 16 in high school dawg...why be flippant and take it away from the kid over a hissy with a coach, \nWhy ROB him of ALL his teachers and the possible good influences THEY may have been on him?\n\nReal talk, I had some cool teachers in h/s that I quote to THIS day, that were way, away from the court, the field or any squad I played on...my parents were great, coaches were cool but the texture one can get from 'learning' and being around other adults during one's formatives years can be invaluable\nI'm thinking of a couple cool as teachers right now from 30 years ago that I'm glad I got to know cause they helped round out my experience, being at HOME with Moms N Pops especially STARTING all of a sudden at the END of schooling seems like giving up, throwing in the towel\n\nLaMelo's two older brothers got 'better' than that\n\nIf THIS is the 'best' way...Why NOW... how come the first two didn't go this no school route\n\nNah dude, you mad ( which is cool) but you don't arbitrarily pull the boy out of structured schooling over THIS issue, \nTransfer him = ok\nBut to say my man is OUT of school, when you and Moms had obviously planned to leave the educating to the school system ( like you had been doing and did in allowing the educational system to make the other 2 academically qualified for UCLA) why 'play' with my man's educational preparedness, off the whim?\nThat's silly\n\nIf it was he's not playing this year and just training and then skipped Senior that be another thing because one could see and understand the planning...this ish right here is just getting mad and kicking rocks in a hissy fit...that isn't foresight, that running away like a girl, hastily\nYou don't 'play' with kid's childhood off momentary 'feelings'... handle the ball playing how you want but in fairness, dude should have left the schooling in place...he never said the school wasn't doing it's job educationally, again the first two had no issues qualifying for UCLA why rock the academic ⛵, the kid's social ⛵ over obviously the non important basketball squad?
Lavar Ball is the greatest sports parent
max you did say the end justify the means you said lets see how it shapes up
White people always want to tell black people how to raise their kids. Now if all his kids had criminal records, and no father around they would love to use these kids in prison.
Anddd race comes in.... Gj comments
lamelo is the next Westbrook
MJ is worst
LaVar is a genius!!! Greatness attracts Haters.
She's jealous
Haters gona hate.

fuck u u put sme  letters even we don't see cr7
I deserve this cleats cause he has been a great player for many youths and his skills make defender pretty crazy and this shoe is the best one I've found in superfly versions with white color making him celebrate his great career .vamos!!
I am from Canada and there is never a chance to win boots over here so I would love to win these , it would be awesome
I would love to have the boots, becouse everytime my friends talks about messi and ronaldo, they hate him. And I defend him everytime becouse I love him
Cuz ma team is in last seed and if i get that ill carry them all the way up
porq ele n fala em portugues
I like subtitles in Portuguese, I love the channel and I would love to have all the videos in Portuguese subtitles
I'm sick and I'm fan number one of Cristiano Ronaldo and I like to play soccer! Thanks a lot
Hi Touzani! Why do I deserve these amazing boots? Very good question. Honestly, everyone deserves these boots, but everyone presses on pity, either they are torn or small, children in Africa play  barefoot and do not interfere with it to play football, I love my boots what I have of course it would be great to win these boots, but , I want to note, all of them are worthy.
The boots are awesome like your channel and I would like to receive them because Cristiano is my idol!
BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD ♥️❤
I deserve these boots because i allways dreamt about to get ronaldo´s boots

Wauw wat gaaaaaf! Ik zou supergraag willen winnen! Want ja, ook meisjes kunnen voetballen! 💪🏻 En Cristiano Ronaldo is niet perse mijn grootste voorbeeld, maar ik vind de schoenen die hij publiceert wel heel gaaf!
Ik ben sinds mijn 5 jaar al een grote fan van ronaldo\n\nAfgelopen zomer ben ik el clasico in camp nou gaan kijken maar ronaldo speelden maar 10 minuten. Daarom zou ik heel graag deze schoenen winnen
Ik chek al je video’s en ben de grootste fan van ronaldo en jou  kan je hem als je blieft sturen die pata’s
Ik wil hem omdat ik al jou video s kijk en omdat ik ook ben geboneerd
Touzani omdat ik sinds ik klein was al zijn fan was en ik voetbal nu zelf ook en wil net zo goed worden als hem en ik ben ook Portugees 👌
Ik zou deze schoenen willen omdat ik ze nodig heb atm. :)
Dat was hem dan, eindelijk met THE LEGEND HIMSELF, Cristiano!!!
Wat is dit ziek zeg samen met Ronaldo😱 1 gekke huis dattie heeft
ik verdien de schoenen, omdat ik dinsdag jarig ben en omdat ik tegen jou had gespeeld en ik kreeg MAAR 3 pannas (in 30 seconden) dus als beloning
I want those shoes becuase I play at vv knollendam, en dat is 1 en al weiland. Ik zal dus wel shinen met die schoenen
omdat cristiano een goede speler is en omdat ik ook de schoenen mooi vind
Pff die schoenen wil ik echt graag hebben en al helemaal met handtekening
Omdat Ronaldo mijn idool is en omdat ik er alles aan doe om een betere voetballer te worden, en dan zullen die schoenen echt te gek zijn!
Ik zou die schoenen willen hebben omdat een grote fan ben en elke video kijk  Noah.allosserie@hotmail.com

Ik wil beginen met voetbal maar k heb geen voetbal schoenen miss kan k die van jou winne zou tof zyn \nVeel suc6 iedereen
Ik zou ze graag willen winnen omdat zowel jij als Ronaldo altijd klaar staat voor zijn fans en hij super vet is om een handtekening op een voetbalschoen v/d beste speler te hebben⚽
Ik hoop dat ik ze krijg want het is van een goede speler. Ik wil echt een keer iets winnen🔝🔝 ❤❤
Ik ben al heeel lang fan van real madrid en ook heeeeeeel erg fan van Ronaldo

Ik verdien Het omdat ik de grootste fan van jullie allebei ben
Om ze van ronaldo zijn
Ik wil die schoenen omdat ik fan ben van ronaldo. En van touzani.     en omdat mijn voetbalschoenen helemaal versleten zijn
Ik hoop deze schoenen te winnen omdat ik vaak naar Touzani en Ronaldo kijk om wat Skills te leren, maar het wil niet echt lukken... laten we hopen dat met Ronaldo's schoenen het wel lukt!
woooooooooooow ik wil die patats heel graag vooral omdat er een ronaldo handtekening op zit
ik zou graag winnen omdat ik een supergrote fan ben van ronaldo en dit zou echt gewoon fantastisch zijn om die schoen te winnen
Al zolang aan het wachten op een kans om iets van Cristiano te winnen!!
Ik ben fan van Touzani en Ronaldo drm wil ik hem hebben
Omdat mijn moeder en ik een zware tijd achter de rug hebben en ik ben de grootste fan daarom wil ik de schoen winnen
Hey Touzani, ik kwam Ronaldo in Portugal tegen en wou graag met hem op de foto.. maar helaas kwam ik niet boven de andere uit! X
ik wil de patta 's graag winnen omdat ik vind dat meisjes ook moeten kunnen winnen!!
Ik wil heel graag de schoen winnen omdat ik ze heel mooi vind en het lijkt me cool omdat Ronaldo ze heeft aangeraakt #touzani tv

Wil ik wel winnen voor mijn dochter. die zit op voetbal, en is helemaal gek van ronaldo! ben benieuwd hoe ze reageert als ik ze zou winnen en aan haar zou geven!!
Omdat ik de grooste ven van Ronaldo ben monnickdam Noordeinde\n35
nou ik wl het winnen  omdat ik een hele grote fan ben van ronaldo en ik wil zijn choenen
omdat ronaldo gewoon de beste speler van dit moment is kijk naar alle prijzen die hij dit jaar heeft geholpen
Ik verdien het omdat ik jaren fan van Ronaldo ben. En omdat ik heel vaak geprobeerd heb om contact met hem op te nemen, maar mij niet is gelukt.😪\nEn ik verdien hem omdat ik die schoenen heel graaaggg wil en heelllll lang op deze video heb gewacht. ❤️
Ik wil deze schoenen echt super graag winnen omdat het gewoon een super speler is en ik vindt hem gewoon de beste van de wereld.❤️⚽️
Ik heb die schoenen nodig, aangezien mijn andere schoenen altijd los komen te zitten aan de onderkant
Omdat ik een grote ronaldo fan ben en zou echt alles doen voor deze schoenen
Ik wil winnen om dat ik alles voor hed gedaan om Ronald te ontmoeten van af mij 5 de maar het lukte niet
Ik zou graag de schoenen willen winnen.
Ik ben sinds klein af aan al fan van Ronaldo, vooral om zijn skills en legendarische carriere. Toen hij bij Manchester United speelde vond ik het al de beste speler ter wereld en het zou ENORM veel voor me betekenen om die schoenen te winnen! Thanks :D
Toen ik vijf was heb ik Ronaldo voor het eerst zien spelen op tv en was direct mijn lievelingsspeler en toen ik ouder werd veranderde al mijn vrienden van lievelingsspeler maar ik bleef altijd bij Ronaldo en nu ik 15 ben is Ronaldo nog steeds the one and only voor mij
IK BEN EEN GROTE FAN VAN CR7 OMGGGG
Ik wil ze winnen omdat ik een meisje ben en ik zit op voetbal, ik zit als enigste meisje in een jongens team en het lijkt me gewoon heeeeeelllll tof om ze te winnen ook omdat Ronaldo's handtekening erop staat. Maar ik gun het iedereen natuurlijk💕💋
Kon Abdelhak Nouri hier maar bij zijn #StayStrongAppie <3
Ik wil deze schoenen winnen omdat ik niet genozg geld heb om foeie schoenen te kopen
Ik zou graag de schoenen van Cristiano willen winnen omdat ik fan ben van hem en jou Touzani. Ik ging uit m'n dak toen ik hoorde dat je zijn schoenen kon winnen. Ik speel trouwens bij SC Heerenveen
I lost it at the Gemma Collins part. 😂
the way you edited the aquariam part made me feel like a mermaid
U should put poppy in every vlog xx
The Aquarium looked like a date 😉😆. Poppy is hot! Best wishes gabs x (im probs misreading shit but ah well)
I really hope this doesn't come across as patronising because I really don't mean it to but can I just say how fucking amazing it is to see you out the flat so much recently and especially getting out to see friends. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression I know how hard it is to even leave the house, I struggle to even take my daughter to nursery most days without feeling sick at the thought. I'm proud of you for even your little trips to the beach to read or sit and think. Hope your doing well babes, you really seem to be getting there with things and I know it doesn't mean you are but I hope you are. Love you loads xxxx
Omg one time I literally pushed my laptop off the table because there was a spider on the screen

Poppy looks like a blonde Cartia Mallan. Specially when she smiles.

Poppy is like so fuckin hot
Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!
Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.
This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks
Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.
Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.
Funny how much they hype this bear but nobody watching really gave a shit
I appreciate the bear but would have preferred Ghost . Atleast once in the season.
Why the fuck is a zombie polar bear cool again??? \n\nD&D are fucking idiots.
If somebody ever asks me what's so bad about being mainstream, I will point them to this fucking polar bear.
With 15 million per episode  🙃 Ghost better be all up and through  S8! I don't want to see no more white walker animals.... leave them bear ideas over there lol Direwolves and Dragons only PLEASE!!! Oh and possibly a Ghost and Daenerys scene!
they are such a good actors
*God dammit we want a zombie polar bear*
i prefer ghost over this unnecessary wight bear scene
Just saw the 14 minute version of this...simply amazing 😊👍
I'm glad we got this polar bear that nobody remembered or talked about after the episode was over. I mean, we had to trade off ghost, a super important character to the story that carries loads of symbolism, so we didn't have him during the uniting of the two biggest characters of the entire show, no matter what kind of symbolism could have been carried through him, but it was all worth it in the end for this epic polar bear. The one that nobody remembers. The one that had no narrative purpose whatsoever.
Its a real shame the show seems to be giving in to what the fans want e.g 70% action episodes. It may be what people want but what they want may not necessarily be good for the show. The drawn out discipline and diplomacy of season 6, skipping out what could have been massive action scenes (such as Stannis at Winterfell) lead to the final 2 episodes being the biggest pay offs in TV history for many viewers. I feel game of thrones is just been rushed now, like this zombie polar bear contributed nothing to the plot. No one important died from it, it didn't lead to anything they just killed it and moved on. It was just action for the sake of action. Smart, thought out intelligent screen writing with good pay offs and twists made game of thrones great. Not pointless action like in the walking dead.
This is why we didn't see ghost. They spent all the budget on Toby the bear.
Hey Guys! This Is Brilliant! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 𝕏𝔹𝕆𝕏 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕞𝕠 𝕔𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Topfreegiftcardsin2017now
Why Polar bear? Where is the spiders big as hounds. Disappointment!
Hit the play button, fluffed my pillow behind my back, sat back to watch the Zombie Polar Bear - video already finished.\nThanks fooking Game Revealed!
Not gonna lie... the thumbnail of the zombie polar bear shit looks like Rap Monster😂👀
Youre not a bear, your name is Toby
This reminds me of Ralph the movie maker
FUCK THE ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR!!! THE CGI MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BRING BACK GHOST!!!! I WANT GHOST!!!!
I didn't even know the bear was a zombie until right now, thought it was just a strange Westeros beast (which anyway it was) now I don't know if I should feel dumb or if I should just blame the directing because this episode must be the most unfocused of the series (like with the bunch of characters dying that weren't even shown before their deaths)
Can someone address why Kit always has white gunk in his hair in those interview scenes? lol
Your name is Toby ! :)
can't believe Thoros died for this shit
I don't think any of you really like Ghost, you are only here to use him to feel cool and accepted on the internet. No offense to people who really do like him
honestly such a waste of budget
No more shirts and trousers and jackets? RLY?!\nThank You! Thank You from the bottom of my heart!
Loved that scene, it was epic 😱
What do you people want Ghost to do? I wants Ghost for what? Just to walk around? Only few episodes left I rather see the main struggle and such than a diré wolf. Wait for rr to write about Ghost.
Thoros Of Myr died for a stupid Polar Bear -.-
This bullshit sums up the terrible transformation this show has undergone. I first fell in love with this show not because of pointless spectacular cgi like this, that was basically nonexistent in season 1. I fell in love with the incredibly rich and complex story, the likes of which i had never seen before. Now the story is pretty simple and straightforward, and terribly predictable, and instead of putting effort into the story, the very soul and heart of every show/book/movie, they give us pointless shit lile this.
I guess they dont film everything on location
Smh guess I'll watch the episode again!
Any one else think that in season 8, bran is going to tell Jon about how the night king was created and Jon is going to order them to  make him into one in order to stop the NK. Jon will do anything to stop the night king, and if that means giving up his life to save his family and westeros, he'll do it. I don't know what will happen to daenerys but she's for sure going to die some way.
Twd should do something like this a zombie animal
all that effort for something so fucking unnessary
Should have used the money on writing!
this scene was so confusing to watch honestly I couldn't really follow it the first time I saw the episode I didn't know what was going on
Why are these mini documentaries behind a paywall?? Just upload it to YouTube for fucks sake.
Game of thrones is fucking gay
I think that title needs more grammatical errors
That's right. I stabbed it on the head while it's on fire
And, yet, it would get the shit kicked out of it by a zombie gorilla
literally nobody gave a shit about the zombie polar bear and you guys are still trying to hype it up... waste of budget :(
DnD just seem like idiots, mostly all the fanbase want ghost to have a more prominent role but no, ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR COS WERE IDIOTS WHO LIKE SEEING SPLOSIONS AND FOIRE
They wasted an episode worth of money on a fucking bear.
What a fucking shitty scene that nobody wanted.
It was pretty weird, to be honest. -Rory McCann and many GoT fans
Common sense: Why don't you do Ice Spiders as big as hounds? The things that have had multiple mentions throughout the show.\n\nD&D: Nah, just do a random fucking polar bear.
so the polar bear was idubbbz
That polar bear is taking revenge for REVENANT
bear was unnecessary, Where's Ghost? :K
GoT was my favourite show ever and this season ruined it. Thanks to the lazy writing, plot holes and general stupidity and carelessness of DnD. Ruining something so good takes a special kind of stupidity. And you guys proved to have it in spades.
Behind the scenes on how to waste budget
i was very disappointed with this season, i was hoping that the 7th season was going to be the season we were finally going to see Arya in a very graphic sex scene, and seeing her coming across all those Lannister soldiers thought that, that might of been the moment where it was going to happen.
Damn if only all the effort that went into animating the CGI bear went into the actual writing.....
A zombie polar bear? How is this related to, let's say, dragons and all that from ancient history?
as soon as they deviated from the novel I instantly lost all interest
So they swapped Ghost for a\n\n\nMotherfucking corpse of a polar bear?
These scene was very memorable, because that bear was truly terrifying! Cheers HBO one of my favorite moments of Season 7!
Guys, the zombie polar bear wasn't just for the theatrics, it was to give a hint to the audience that animals too can be turned into wights, foreshadowing what happened with Viserion.
Dont get me wrong, i love GoT. But how the fuck is a video with 100k views and 3.5k likes is on trending again?
I really enjoyed season 7 overall, but a zombie polar bear sounds a lot more interesting on paper than it actually is to watch. By far the biggest moment of man, what happened to this show? I experienced in any of the seven episodes.
that polar bear scene was a waste of money and time in my opinion
... sigh
Faites des économies sur les ours et montrez nous Ghost. !\nJe suis pas scénariste mais vous auriez pu l'utiliser pour accueillir Bran à château noir (genre il reconnait un Stark et se met à ses pieds pour finir de convaincre  la garde sur son identité). Ou bien un scène épique avec Bran qui contrôle Ghost pour aider Jon contre les marcheurs blancs (après avoir prévenu par télépathie Dany que Jon était en danger ce qui aurait été plus crédible que le sprint de flash Gendry). \nFranchement je kiff got mais vous déconnez grave.
진짜 왕좌의게임 배우들한테는 연기상 줘야됨~~

When is season 8 😳😭😭
The Hound and Tormund = Best Companions
People are seriously upset with this? Geez, there's no pleasing anyone these days
Any critics of Game of Thrones now; I suggest you go write something 10+Million people are watching , stealing to watch, buying series of the books, making multiple You Tube channels on the topics of the HBO series just about what you write. TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .
You guys whine more than 13 year old girls
I've never seen this show in my life, is it good?
Wow if RT show a clip from Gravity the morons would swallow it 😛
Dat Satellite Deployment....\n\nGuess the old joke is true. America would spend millions of dollars to figure out how to deploy a hand held Satellite.\nThe Russians? They would just throw it 'out a window'.
Thanks for all the risk
Google Earth in VR scared the shit out of me and I was safely in my bedroom.\n\nThese guys are nuts.
It seems fltat earth moviment has gaining momentum all around the world.
Wow there a lot of people who need to go back to school in these comments
sapceFIGHTS? 5? I bet that the first ones will had a russian on it but already 5??!  jejejej
Earth is as flat as my man boobs.
This is really impressive, and the levels of salt and denial of the flat -earthers in the comments is hillarious.
Question to flat earthers;\n If you were given the chance to prove the earth was flat but the evidene you gathered showed it to be a sphere, what would stop your fellow flat earthers from simply ignoring your evidence and claiming you're now part of the conspiracy?
Flat Earthers: If the Earth is flat, give us a 360 video instead of photos and static ones!\n\nRussians: Hold my fucking vodka comrade...\n\n*Russians and RT make first ever 360 space video*\n\nFlat Earthers: You actually did it? U-Uh, we-well...uh...FAKE, CGI, PHOTOSHOP, RUSSIAN/HOLLYWOOD LIES!\n\n*Russia and the rest of the planet's population who aren't living in the 3rd century and have developed common sense sigh in frustration*\n---\nPlease, can we just send one of these Flat Earthers up into space and broadcast it live so that when they remove their helmet the whole world can watch as the air is sucked from their lungs and they fucking implode?
Thanks a lot to the Russians people from spoutnik to today .\n     Cordialy Riad from Paris :-)
Give me a 24h version of this without the constant blabbering and some Atmospheric Music \nthats all i want and need
aliasing suggests cgi edges. any video processor can handle processing smooth curved angles on film but cgi has tells. God hates liars, but i'm sure all the freemason or athiest astronauts know that already.
Obviously a Russian conspiracy to take over the space program from the US.
THE EARtH IS FLAT! EVERYONE AROUND THE GLOBE KNOWS THAT!
I'll give you this one Russia... ;) Seriously great
Awesome!
Fake !
4K screen is great but what u really need are some VR goggles
Good evening. For the ignorant and the dubious: Take your camera outside in a beautiful night full of stars and take a picture. You will be disappointed because your camera hardly detects the dim light from most of the stars. Now try again with a flash light infront of your camera and you will see 0 stars. In my analogy the flash light is Earth. Thats why we see a black sky during most of the ISS feed. Fellow humans, stop dumbing the fuck out, we have dark days ahead and dumb cunts yelling that the Earth is flat is the last thing we need while we try to not suffocate in our own garbage. Have a good day.
Wtf am I look at exactly?
This looks so real I almost believe it to be real. HAHAHA  hehehehehe  stupid Americans, stay away from my kids
4:30 in   /watch?v=y5EierZiyrY     a diver in space lol :D from these same russian astronauts. All of it is fake /watchv=y5EierZiyrY\n\nIf you still think this is real after seeing a diver in space, then you need to have your head checked. Reality says it's a fucking LIE and done in the water pool. Thanks bye, the earth is flat, what else would they be hiding ;) It's not about money either, they have all the money they want. It's about control
Got youtube set to HD but all i get is blurred shit \nFFS nasa send a proper camera up yah bunch of wankers
Truly amazing in every sense of the word!
The earth is flat this is not real it is done in studio .
This is nasa fakel...stúdió felvétel....hollywood movie...
I will watch this in vr
Awesome

I call bullsheite on first time in the universe. I highly doubt that is accurate.
Still no success in determining the sex of the turtle?
What a joke another waste of time
I can't laugh even more.... I think you busted all my organs from all that LAUGHING!!!!! Realistically.... What are you really getting out of this? Just to prove the Earth is round??? Based on this evidence, it's not convincing with all the fish-eyed lens and Hollywood effects whereas Florida is really HUGE on that ball... When you guys are going to do the real job???? I'm still waiting for that space tourism... Time is ticking.............................................
haha bring more BS Videos RT now we all see Russia + USA work together to fool people.
Why the hell they are throwing those satellites towards Earth? They'll burn into the atmosphere really fast! They should throw them towards space, not towards Earth. If I would've paid millions of dollars to get my satellite in space, I would kill the astronaut who throwed it towards Earth! And why do astronauts launch them? Do a proper launcher!
Fake as hell as always. Took them a month to release it. Where's the 360 degree camera sweep done by the astro-not?
I didn't know that satellites are launched like this - just manually throwing them into the space old fashioned way  😁
It's me, (most intelligent ever born), who knows what was before singularity, what's outside our universe and more; but human is cruel, (especialy USA and its fasal-states); due to this i have ethical reasons not to share.
take this all you flatearthers ....
The sad thing is fast forward 300 years and anyone who believes the earth is round will be persecuted. Idiocracy anyone?
Never once they did a film footage 360deg on the moon and in their so called space walks but only with a shit film that shows fuck all...LMAO... Hollywood crap NASA is...
Faker than Kim Kardashian's ASS
Что за отсталые поставили дислайки?
Первый комментарий от представителя Российской Федерации, оставлен :D
Lets say just for a minute the Earth WAS flat, so fucking what?  The only people that the physics of a flat Earth are even of importance to (pilots, engineers, astronauts etc) are the people who know it's not flat anyway.  Fucking lol.
Yea I don't believe on the flat earth but can it be more fake ? I mean com on guys if you can't see the fake on this video we are doomed lol
Maravilhosa vista do nosso planeta , TERRA ,e de fundo o Universo , seria incrível podermos acompanhar o espaço com uma câmera 360° ,daria para fazer um  google space view  kkk
Sensacional!!
Looks so flat. Case closed XD
Fake
http://revelations4.blogs.fr
Try harder next time.
This is the crappiest attempt to debunk the flat earth I've ever seen, it's complete shit but the music is good I guess...
Is it just for me or does the video look blurry as heck? This is pretty cool and I hope they can put up more - but much higher quality 360 cameras in space.
The clouds seem to be moving tremendously fast 😲
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS GARBAGE ????
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IfwaY-F4SM\n\nMaybe USA never went to the moon, but it is not transparent. I saw it block the sun in August.
THEY ALTERED THE VIDEO  SINCE YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   HOLY SHIT         ANYBODY HAVE THE ORIGINAL VIDEO STILL I HOPE?     HAHAHAHAH   THEY GOT CAUGHT SHOWING A RETARDEDLY FAST SPINNING EARTH  AND NOW THEY TRY TO ZOOM IN  SO ITS NOT AS NOTICEABLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Obviously the earth is flat!
2017,First Spacewalk filmed in 360 but porn movies still can't do that :(
Can we just get a full view of the entire earth without any distortion graphics?!
uhmm... why is the street map / green map showing at the end when they spin really fast? at 03:14

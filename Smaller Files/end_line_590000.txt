Who let the 40 year old overweight soccer mom on the stage??
It's stuck in a crowd not stuck in the ground pink come on now Lol
She nows, Who is the best!
No need drum in this song...
Damn pink was trashhhhh :/ sad to see her like that
was great and then pink showed up
This is more washed up than like everything ever.
Axl needs to lay off the breakfast burritos.
They look alike. I don't know who that's worse for. Would you rather be a chick that looks like fucking Axl Rose or a dude that looks like Pink? lmao
When you turn into an elder and nothing matters
I CANT FUCKIN WAIT!!! IVE GOT TICKETS FOR GUNS AN ROSES ON OCT.23,2017 IN HARTFORD, CT. THIS CONCERT WILL BE LIT AS FUCK!!!!😎👍✌🔫🌹🎶🎵🎸🎤💯🔥🌠
Damn they have been touring non stop, I literally saw them over a year ago....how does Axl do this OVER and OVER and OVER for 3 hours every night....MAD RESPECT !!
That'll give you some real rock cred. Invite Pink onstage. That's why people diss Axl.
Can somebody explain to me why slash is playing guitar? i thought he left guns n roses???
I prefer myles singing this..axle puts no heart into it..
Now that was amazing!  Love it!  🙏
Axl probably smashed her back doors in after the show 🍆
light pound doctor scare beef put grand measurement detect mean hispanic massive.
Axle Rose is a fat old heroin junkie rapist. His baby like antics far over shadow the music created.
I must admit that was pretty fucking cool.
Getting old sucks I guess specially if you let yourself go to shits
Seen Guns in August, and Axl was all over that stage...\nnot bad for his age.\nI was shocked at the end when Slash did a handstand...\nstill got it at his age too.\n\nThanks for sharing this with us.✌
There are 4 Pink videos on trending right now. Someone's pushing her really hard. Wonder how much they're paying YouTube to do it.
Holy hell, Axl is walking around like that fat guy that sucks in his belly to try and look buff.
Oh how we all needed this!!! And not even talking about the meaning of the song! 😉
While there are a few songs with a well whistled part, this is the best (I think), and he did it as amazing as the studio recording. Awesomeness. There are only few artists any and all of todays popular singers MUST bow down to on the same stage and G & R are one (Zeppelin, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Rush are the others [I would add Stevie Wonder but he can't see anyway]).
Wow! Fucking A. 👏👏👏.  GnR should work with pink on a song together.
Axl got a big ole beer belly these days. Lol
just to sing that much!? really
I'm pretty sure pink is a dude
What camera are you using? Great quality.  Is it a phone?\nThanks for sharing, great video.
She should of sang the whole song wit him she worthy
Pink sounds great!!!! Thank God Guns & Roses are back together !!!
Lucky cunt you got to sing with Mr Axl rose
I just imagine this when Axl was in his prime
Pink sounds awesome.  She always brings it!  Love her!
Yup.  They both still suck butt
Axl got fat
Fuckin awesome!!
Awesome sauce

Can anyone please tell me the name of the song playing? It's so goofy I need it.
From the thumbnail I was worried they cast Lindsey as the scientist.  thank god it didn't happen.
I am really happy this is coming out soon! way to go RT, I'll see you in theaters next month
End of lazer team 1: \n*Ice cube's voice*\nyall motherf*ckers is going to space
So this is it, huh, we're some kind of Lazer Team?
If there isn't a Delorean in this film, so help me....
THU CUT OFF HIS HEAD\nYOU KILLED HIM
Cant wait to see that sweet sweet Delorean
Amazing also I feel like Michael just plays himself in these movies
is that amanda from shameless?
Lol Gavin is lost! That makes so much sense!
I think I'm more excited for this one because now I know what I'm getting myself into lol
sir they have locked lasers onto us
I watched the 1 now I am watching the second when it comes out
I hate to say it, but i'm kind of surprised there doing another one after the last one did so poorly.
*AND YOU DIDN'T BRING ANY EXTRA PLUTONIUM?*
I hope the dialog volume is a bit higher in the movie than in the trailer, some of the texts were hard to make out.
all aboard to the HYPE Train!
IS THIS ONE PLAYING AT TORONTO AFTER DARK TOO???
Reviews for the first one weren’t good, because people never watched roosterteeth, the jokes were great and I loved it, this looks even better
Is that emily from until dawn? if it is and you didn't make a joke aout the butterfly effect i will be disappointed.
They got that one girl from shameless.
This and the first Lazer Team are the main reasons why I have my YouTube Red account. I'm so hyped!
Really hope this is rated R...
I'll be honest, I REALLY liked the first movie and I'm looking forward to this one. Maybe it's the fanboy in me talking, IDK.
I feel there going to scale back on the sequel. But I'm still excited. The dynamic between the team and the scientist might be interesting.
*when Gavin is taken* YOU BASTARDS
Jesus wait, I haven’t even seen the first one yet...I want to if you wanted to know
I feel bad about Gavin, he is poor when he got stuck across the galaxy, but I like the girl's hairstyle.\n👏🏻🖖🏻👌🏻👍🏻✌🏻️😃
I have yet to see the first one, and you're already bringing out a second. Bravo, dudes and dudettes - bravo!
...I see the writing is still clever.
first one was meh, but I liked it just cause of burnie, michael, and gavin...this one looks meh, but I will watch it cause of burnie, michael, and gavin
Anyone wander why this is on trending with 200k views and h3s video with 10mil in one day wasn't... YouTube there's other ways of advertising! Which are fairer too
So there going into another dimension...ok\n(Silently hops they meet the reds and blues)
soooooooooooo....... no gavin for more than 65% of the movie???\n(Also I'm just guessing how much of the movie gavin won't be in )
Well... I'll be waiting for the Blu Ray
Okay but real truth here, when does the blu ray come out?
I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going.
I can already tell it's gonna be hilarious.
I actually liked the first one for some reason.
Looks like Going up against a wendigo and surviving changed Emily for the better
THEY CUT OFF HIS HEAD!
Ow ffs I wanted to see Gavin through out the movie not at the end of the movie
I came on myself out of pure excitement
Is she from the game Until Dawn?.....Nvm
At least we know Woodrow won't starve to death
Hoping that this time they don't cut and fit all the funniest parts in the trailers.\nNot saying that Lazer Team was bad though!
This season of Superstore is getting really weird...
youtube red is dead, did you guys not get the message!
SO THAT'S IT HUH? WE SOME KINDA LASER TEAM 2
YOU CUT OFF HIS HEAD!
They got Emily from until dawn lol
Any chance to see this film in theaters in France ? Please...
Did anyone else pick up the Overwatch reference?? 😂😅
My brother sent me this and I said 'I haven't watched the first one'
HELL YEA LOVED THE FIRsT MOVIE CAN NOT WAIT :D
The first one was really bad, and this one looks worse from the trailer only.
are people stupid, thinking that this is meant to be a top tier Oscar winning movie. ITS AN INDIE MOVIE meaning that its only made by small people with a low budget but people apparently think this must be highest budget movie. I mean its literally their second movie they have ever made and its made by people that you watch and you are just hating on it just because its bad acting and low budget.
IT'S NOT A DELOREAN!
really? YouTube Red? Question is whether it will be available for Sponsors, who, you know, literally pay RT's bills
The search for the Nose.
Lol i would've high fived Michael for that back to the future reference. Bttf ftw
Why would you try to get Woody back?

YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS
omg!!!! I can’t wait!! 😍😍
im kinda surprised since the first one bombed
The first one was meh at best and the ending was terrible was make a second one
This is going to be a fail
Gavin was so awful in the first one they wrote him off for most of this one. For shame.
Did this genuinely need a sequel though?
But the phone is so UGLY... \nI'll save my money instead
Internet needed this video
Hi Marques , will Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 will be a good buy after the price drop,? \nif not what will you recommend in that price bracket
It's bind boggling to me how anyone can dislikes this man's videos
Who cares about video?  The Pixel 2 got a 99 for still photos, which is all that matters to me... sounds like game over... but I'm still using my Pixel XL and probably will for awhile...
You're the man MKBHD
what do u think about it?\ndoes it sucks
So does the 98 score compare to 108? I mean are they on the same scale ??
The LG V30 inferences are just Gold
This video is so clean
And remember that once Dxo mark gave the $700 Nikon D3200 the same score as the Canon 1Dx wich has literally an extra zero on the price tag and was released less than 6 months earlier
You're the best....
This is why I have my Nikon D800 with me petty much everywhere I go
Yo, MKBHD is getting more critical these days. Beware other tech news outlet. Love what you're doing here Marques.
Marques you should check out the elephone S 8
when i thought u explained everything there is already and you come out with a new explanation video, i like it
Watched a 11 min long video without getting bored.. thats mkbhd! ;)
I think there algorithm for determining the overall score is something like money+money=highest score ever!
Damn Marques went in on some fools for this video
please make more explained videos, i miss those. and i have a doubt, so if the total score isnt 100, what is the total score then? i mean, a score doesn really make sense without a maximum score :/
This is why you have 5 million subscribers. Great video!
Thanks buddy. I notice outside of the super geek tech world, Sammy gets it, they make what the people use. I wish google would catch that clue.
mkbhd hates the press, but somehow he stays out of politics
Why take scores with a grain of salt that DxO helped achieve? If you have a solid, robust measurement (which you believe they do), then the only way to improve the measurement you receive is to actually do better. What's wrong with helping companies do better?
Hey Marcus I usually don't buy a phone because of the camera. But i did buy the pixel 2xl because of the front facing speakers and because of software and on-time update and that why im a Nexus-pixel phone user.
Do another Blind test video when the iPhone X comes out!
What I don't understand is, why give a DXO score like 98 for the Pixel 2 when it isn't an average of the complete test table scores? If your not using an average then you might as well literally add all the numbers from the complete test table and the total becomes the new overall score. So the pixel 2 score would then become a 604 for example? Then the press can say THE PIXEL 2 GOT A 604 DXO RATING! THE HIGHEST EVER! That's a bit better and more truthful.\n\nAlso I guarantee because of this brilliant video DXO mark themselves change their scoring.
Fuji's produce some of the best looking images in digital photography today. The XTrans series sensors are critically acclaimed by photo experts the globe over. DXO does not rate fuji sensors. Politics. Collusion. Corrupt. System smells a little. :)
This was really good. Great research!
I never heard about these numbers, website until now 😬
Was thinking about the benchmark for the last few days. This video madr the things more clear. Would share to anyone who keeps on ranting about the dxomark rating. Nice work as always.\n\nOne suggestions. Can you start making videos about Huawei if you don't have any particular problem with the devices.
You should make a video comparing the new Apple watch series three and the gear sport. And maybe just talk about smartwatches in general!
If I remember correctly, the 100 score was based off the canon s100. In other words, todays phone cameras are almost as good as a larger sensor compact camera from several years back.
What do you think about Xperia XZ1 Compact?
Such a great video
Marques, you said that the S8 scored higher than the Pixel 2 in both zoom and bokeh, but their bokeh rating was the same.
You should do a video on light L16 camera what kind of rating do you think it should have mobile or not?
Exactly how schools give u an overall grade . It's misleading!!!
PLEASE everyone what is the actual title of this alltta song
I'm watching this on a silver V30
Great and clear explanations
Best @MKBHD VIDEO till date.
Much appreciated 👌
MKBHD GOES SAVAGE 😂😂
One word : THX !
Mkbhd Wolla!
great info
Exposed them lmao
MKBHD attacking fake news out here
Best subdued rant ever lol
awesome video, marques! That callout was savage af.
Awesome technical video! Excellent study!
DxOMark got roasted
good job
BRAVO! Very good vid Marq
Cant wait for the disstrack 😂😂😂😂
Very interresting , thanks Marques
Explained!
Awesome work!\nSuper clean and crisp video 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Mkbhd just trolled Engadget 😄
Great video, subscribed!!
I wondered the same when I saw the 108/100 rating on Engadget.Thank you for clearing it up.
Don't know if you'll even notice such a late comment but any idea when YouTube will support 18:9 ratio?
I hope this video was trending!\nbrilliantly explained..
Outstanding video. I really learned something today. Thank you for taking the time to put together such an in-depth, objective explanation in these scores, and how the rating process works.
This was probably the most informative 11 minutes I have watched. There was probably not even a single wasted right there!
The more you know......
well done! for being objective and fair!
Hey MKBHD, amazing video man! Thank you for this amazing in-depth video and bringing out the clarity. We need more honest reporting like yours! In every field. Thank you for putting the tech press corp on check!! I hope you keep it up bro!
This is why I watch your channel, thanks for the info
U never review any sony product , why ?
Of the few vids i liked on this website :-)
Watch Marques tshirt for 2 seconds and then his face. Keep doing this multiple times & you'll notice an illusion or he is also a part of Illuminati or the infamous key club.
Informative videos like this are what make MKBHD a great channel.
I'm happy that someone is challenging smartphone cameras and making a class standard. It's great that they're working with manufacturers on their test but I think some of that should be available no matter what
Thanks for the explanation! I am too lazy to read thru their entire site.
Would be great to see another blind smartphone test with the newest batch of phones early in the new year when the 2018 phones have all come out. Love looking at photos without a preconceived bias towards one over the other.
This reminds me of why did I subscribe onto this channel once again. Thank you MKBHD.
Do More of T H I S !
Have you ever felt boring while doing what you are doing? (One questions for ask MKBHD) ;)
In other words, just stick to seeing photos with your own two eyes and decide for yourself! Who cares what companies like these say? Seriously.
Keep making EXPLAINED video's\nThey are just awsome
wow thank you this was so informative i had started totally righting off there rating as a arbitrary number
Great video and explanation!
Any chance on a LG V30 revisit? I haven't seen anything on DxOmark either lol
DXOMark!!! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL\nIf your a professional and have look at their site you'll see so much inconsistency in their reviews.
@mkbhd this was an awesome video. Non biased and to the point and great courage to talk about the reality. Cudos!
Until the iPhone X come out, the rest will either be forgotten or history.
The google pixel 2 looks like a toy tbh
You take a lot of portrait photos. Wich one you would pick?\nAn actual mirrorless camera or a DSLR instead of a phone.
DXO rating for this video = 100
mkbhd ftw
That lg v30 cameo...
Brilliant video!!!
MKBHD IS MEME LORD CONFIRMED
Well said !!!
Amazing video
Hahahahahaha, the Michael Jordan video....
Isnt there technically a maximum score? Even if the weighted average isnt out of 100 aren't the individual scores out of 100?
Guys can we stop rating the quality of a smartphone by the quality of its camera? If photography really matters to you, then there are plenty of dSLRs and mirrorless camera out there for anyone from casual enthusiasts to professionals.

LYRICS:\n\n[Verse 1: John Legend]\nAll this trouble in this here town\nAll this shit going down\nWhen will they focus, on this?\nStreets ride up with the TV crews\nLook ma, we on the news\nBut they didn't notice, before this\nThey float above the city lights\nForget the truth, inhale the lies\nJust enjoy the show\nThey see us reaching for the sky\nJust ignore that you survive\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nMaybe we should go\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nLet's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nPenthouse floor\n\n[Verse 2: John Legend]\nAll that bubbly, all that wine\nOh man, look at the times\nDidn't they notice, notice?\nOnly future I can see, ain't what it used to be\nAnd I didn't know this, I didn't know this\nOnce you're above the city lights\nWon't want to spend another night, down there on your own\nThe whole world on display for us\nThe altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nLet's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for\nCan't keep us out no more (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nPenthouse floor\n\n[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]\nI heard this old joke once, it was like, uh\nKnock knock, who there, it's us, us who?\nJust us, who dis? Just playin'\nJust me, new phone, new hair, new era\nI'm in the penthouse, baby\nHandpicked from bad apples and bad eggs\nHeld back, I had to grab crab legs\nAnd then there were only but a few\nConversations held with patience, what a party, what a view\nWhat a dress, what a song\nWhat a beautiful time\nMy folks downstairs still waitin' in line\nThey never been in these rooms\nNever stayed with these folks\nNever laughed at the news, never hated these jokes\nSo as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover\nForcin' a new smile, he tells me another\nHe said What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?\nThen he pushed me off the top and said Jump, nigga, jump!\n\n[Bridge: John Legend]\nOh don’t bring me down I need a room up in the clouds\nI wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate\nOh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss\nIn the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse\n\n[Chorus: John Legend]\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nGo to the penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nLet's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for\nWe'll tear down those penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nThose penthouse doors\nWe'll tear down the penthouse doors (let's go, let's go, let's go)\nBaby, I'm in the penthouse floor\nBaby, let's ride the elevator\nTil we can rise some more\nGo to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor (let's go, let's go, let's go)
I didn't know Giancarlo Esposito can sing. 🤣
Damn!!! The moment I saw this video on YouTube page, I grabbed my headphones, coz I knew John Legend will never disappoint.... Love Ya!!!
How to make not so much sound like a whole hell of a lot. Been going on for decades.

Go  to  The  penthouse  nice  song
I am not gonna lie, i am not liking this
John Legend is back!
Why does everything have to be political
Brought to you by , SHUT YO BITCH ASS UP AND ENJOY THE MUSIC.
Uh oh I'm here when something is brand new? That doesn't happen.
Legend is as Legend Does.😌
That vid makes no sense to me whatsoever! obviously  trying to formulate a message along the usual color lines of black and white, with no help from a flat musical theme that failed to make any emotional connection... I'll pass on this one, although I'll still remain a John Legend fan.
this video gives me some Get Out vibes damn
John Legend can barely sing he's barely adequate and he's boring as little dog shit.
The first AC should have been fired for the sloppy focus work on this video
One of my new favorite songs.
new songs no good..music gone downhill..
I'm a simple man. John legend and CHANCE THE RAPPER IN 1 SONG? insta-click
Anyone notice the messed up grill on the car in the first frame...?

john legend could easily make it into a gay bar and he wouldn't need  to show his gay ID 🤣

this song and video is way beyond powerful
SO CLOSE TO PERFECT. If they wanted the message to be even stronger, the red hat should have never came off. Because otherwise, the folks in the room are just as bad as those outside. \n\nThe identity politics is incredibly strong in this video. Why can’t he wear his MAGA hat as well as have fun with those in “The Penthouse”? \n\nThis video has a leftist message and its apparent how they tried to disguise it. So I will now dismantle it. They made it look as if by removing the hat meant that the white man wanted to put politics aside and join the ever so “Tolerant” group in the room. But we all know that by removing that hat, he disassociated himself with his political party, and that’s the only reason he let him in. If they were actually willing to put politics aside, he shouldn’t have had to take the hat off.\n\nThis video was so close to being perfect. If he allowed him to come in, with the hat, and showed unity between not only people of color, but people of political preference, it would have been perfect. A missed opportunity I think.
This gives me a 80's or 90's vibes
I love the bitches singing “ let’s go let’s go let’s go “
wow this song is classic I said before end of this month  will become 3 billion and more who challenge me ? 😆
Great background for a music video
Dude I hate trump as much as the next guy but damn. Could watch anything new without it having to deal with politics? When I listen to music I want an escape from the real world. Not a grim reminder of reality.
Sad News 4 Me: My grandpa died today with a heart stroke (or heart attack I should say)
kinda sad chance wasnt in the video
Sorry, no red hats in here.
Cant watch anything without some political BS propoganda being infused in it. WoW!
Why weren't Chance in this video mayyn -- \nVid and tune was banging but my idea is you coulda kept the lip sync with the lobbyists going, have John go up in the elevator to the penthouse floor, knock on some big doors like Mr. Mayor?, and we just see a big seat turn around to have Chano in it, still rapping, which is where he ends his verse with an 'igh!' Come on man
Real meaningful music is coming back!! Yess John Legend!! ❤👌
Cant wait until you get back to South Africa.
hes a real legend
Beautiful message and song.
Was that photographer Jesse?
John Legend is worthy of G.O.A.T title! Like if you agree.
This bullshit rhetoric is a great cure for insomnia. Thanks, I needed some rest.
Timeout! This video was posted 2 days ago and it's not even at a million views yet!? How!?
This song makes me want to eat ramen
It has such a great message that we need in this time
This has a deep meaning to it \nlove it
John legend wasn't black.
This is lit like if your here before  1 million
who is here before 10 Million ?!!
ayy this shit's good

Amazing song! Follow my insta to see me sexy 1bangJam style, also on the end of the song you can see this comment...thats a come up. G's o.O
his voice is so soothing
What is the message in this song?
This is black privilege
Chance make it worst
god this songs sucks
trash as fuck minus chance
Here b4 a milli
john legend eh na verdade uma lenda, grande som
I don't really get it. If you can afford the penthouse go for it! A junior suite is still really nice, and affordable during the off season.
Hey John,  theres a lot of subtle racism in this video. And Trump hating, of course.\nThe white guy with the MAGA hat. Of course.\nBasically John, youre selling out to the liberal media.  Im disappointed in you.\n But its Guaranteed to be a hit, right? Money in your pocket John.\n\nFuck you White People,  We'll take over now...... isnt that what youre saying,  John?\nit comes across that way.  Money in your pocket.\n\nSo basically the white rednecks were in the Penthouse, while you, John, are the bellboy or whatever.. and the  evil WHITE security guards are keeping the undesirable minorities outside.\nBut then, somehow magically the minorities are all on the penthouse floor and the world is beautiful now.  Money in your pocket\n\nGuaranteed money in your pocket, man.\nAnd all the people that buy this shit are CNN Lemmings too.\nIm surprized you didnt put Putin in there too. \n\nEasy money, John.    Easy money for you.      You fuckin sellout.
Just added the saint Laurent woc to my wAnt list. Gorgeous collection 😍
Coccinelle is pronounced Kochinelle, which, in Italian, means lady bugs! As always lovely video, the green Gucci bag is the stuff of dreams 😍😚
i would love to see your perfume collection ❤️❤️❤️
Love the fringe! I’m thinking of getting one too now 😅 xxxx
the frinch suits you so much Amelia!!❤❤
Wohooo love this Amelia 😍

actually coccinelle is an Italian company, and  it is pronounced cotschinelle in Italian
Coccinelle means Ladybug, and it's pronounced cock-see-nell, if you ever wanted to know! ;) That being said, Gucci really upped their bag game lately!! I was never really into their stuff, but every bag you showed in here and the ones I've seen around are sooo pretty!!!
waahhh so beautiful 😍
Where is your chair from😍😍😍😍
They will come in handy when the bulbs go out
Amelia those bangs looks so good on you 💕😍
Great new look. I love the bangs.
Love ur bangs! You look younger.
SUCH a great collection!!
Oh, no! Your fringe looks like mine, that I made myself when I was 8... Please, change it!
I really love your hair! Best decision ever
So many cute bags!! Loove the more muted pale colored bags they are so pretty :)
Please tell me where you got the rainbow sweater you're wearing with the Chloe Nile- it's the cutest!!
Love your new hair !!! 😍👍🏻
hey amelia! coccinelle is pronounced like cochinellay :))
Love love love your style
Beautiful collection
They seem very cheap
Your hair 😍
Love ur handbag taste 👌🏼
Nice fringe x
Love your bangs!❤  Your hair is gorgeous!! 👌
Coccinelle is pronounced cokcinelle meaning ladybird in French :)
http://ameliaalicebryson.blogspot.com/?m=1
Amelia it is pronounced coXinelle 😊
Buy another Pomeranian, they're so cute🐶🐶
I am madly in love with your bags! 💖 I also prefer bags that hold their structure, but I never put it on the floor because of a Romanian superstition that says you'll loose your money/become poor if you place your bag on the floor😹. \n\nThe brand Coccinelle is Italian, so you would pronounce it with the ci as if it were ch(like in cheers) and it means ladybug. How sweet is that?! 💖 If it would be a French brand it would be pronounced coxinel.
Your hair! I love it!
Which youtube executive did you bang to get on trending?
love the way you did the video ♥️
Of all the marmonts you went for the worst solid colour bag...
That box clutch with music notes on it looks so gorgeous!!
The fringe makes you look Latina!
Overrated handbags
The floral gucci looks amazing!
Coccinelle is an italian brand, it means ladybugs! We pronounce it co - chi (same sound of chips) nell - eh \n(some people do not pronounce it the same way they pronounce the italian word for lady bugs and they say co - chi - nell with a silent e and I have no idea why, it makes me want to email the brand and ask them!)
Did you sell the Chanel chevron square mini? Love that bag!
Coxinel for coccinelle, it's lady bug in french 🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🐞🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷🕷
Beautiful collection!! Also, your hair looks great!! xxx
that red Chanel bag is so ugly 😟
The fringe fits you so well!! You look so damn chic! Urgh! Loved this video as always (your cutaways are by far the best)
The fringe makes you look even prettier
I came here to see your new beautiful hairstyle❤
Love your hair today, girl !!
You look French with your fringe.
It's pronounced Coxinelle (in french coccinelle means ladybug)
Love the hair omg😍❤
Hi Amelia  hope you're well. This is an impressive collection. So beautiful!! Still not sure about the fringe. One minute I think it's beautiful next unsure. You're still beautiful anyway. As long as you're happy.\nLove from the states
That first bag is super chic and functional!  I'm in search of a good work bag and that one definitely caught my eye
WOW, Love those bangs, makes you look adorable, a blooming teenager.
You suit your fringe so much! I used to have one and they're awesome ❤️
OMG, I'm catching up on your videos and I only noticed the fringe AFTER the 12:37 minutes long video was finished and the thumbnail of the next one clued me in. That is how well you suit the fringe, it's automatically accepted by my brain as perfectly Amelia. Congratulations on getting the perfect fringe.
I love your outfit in the video! Is it a dress or top and where is it from?
I giggled when you said you own few green clothes while you were actively wearing a similar blue green top, though you may have done that on purpose
Great video ..... your petrol Gucci bag is size small and the pink one is the mini ....  I have the new royal blue velvet Gucci bag in the medium size and it's quite a bit bigger than yours 🌟🖒
i feel like it's been ages since a sit down video like this, i really loved it, makes me want a designer bag so much 😻😻😻
Love all the bagss they are exactly how i like ❤️❤️
The brand is COCCINELLE! kisses from Italy,Sicily!!
Love your Multi Jumper, so cosy and cuddly.   Fave bag out of the ones you have is the Black Gucci 🖤  (p.s. Loved the yellow/gold 3 tier dress you wore in Paris).
Your handbag collection is so whimsical! Lovely! Thanks for sharing.
Love the new haircut it suits you 😍👍🏻
I was just thinking how badly I'd love to see an updated designer handbag collection! Literally read.my.mind! ((:
Your new fringe looks greattttt on you!
That multicolour knit jumper looks INCREDIBLE on you! Love that vibe. I'm surprised you don't use a cover for your glasses.
wow beautiful collection. btw what is the name of you nail polish color? its so beautiful.
That fringe is 😍😍😍 you look amazing.
A little bit jealous and a big happy for u~ LOL
I love the fringe on you!! Can you please tell us the lipstick you are wearing in this video?
I live in NY and I am always nervous to take nice bags out during the day.... BUT that givenchy bag is soon stunning! <3 <3
What size laptop can you fit in the Givenchy Antigona Bag?
Hi Amelia , please can  you let me know where the Mac/ trench coat is from that you are wearing with the Gucci Marmont ? Thanks
Hey Amelia, i know this isnt your kind of thing but could u pls consider doing a bridal makeup look? Im getting married in dec and i love the way you do makeup. Basically i love everything about you!
Always love your bag collection!
Saks has the nude shade every now and then on the website and you get shipping to other countries. I have the blush and floral Gucci bag. Hope you get to get it just be patient. Xo
beautiful collection, enjoy! would LOVE to see an update to a vid you did 2 years ago, it had your LVCash rose ring, 15 luxury accessories?!? can't recall exact name! was one of my fave vids you have done + would make a great tag vid!! xx
Not a fan of the bangs
Coccinelle was founded in Italy, so the Italian pronounciation would be like tagliatelle in the end, and the cci is pronounced like chi in tai chi.
Loved this video and your hair!!!
If I ever won the lottery I would buy every bag in this video\n😂😂😂
Hi :) in english it would be something like kotcheenaellae\n\nIt's italian, and it means ladybugs!
Your hair looks so good 😍 It suits you very much.
Where is your black dress from!?
I was in love with your hair :( . Your handbag collection is life ! Sooo good pieces
what size is ur MacBook air? <3
You should be put on a desk, have your legs spread, and fucked *hard* but long, thick meat.
Drooling over your bags!!! :)
I feel somebody is not a fan of valentino.. don’t blame you 😂
This got 40k views in 21hours how the fuck is this on trending??????
Omg the fringe is everything!!
it's pronounced cox-ee-nelle.. which means ladybug in french :)
Your hair is much classier like way! Well done for improving yourself and taking on constructive criticism
By 'tried on' she means 'held' 😂😂😂
You are so gorgeous! And everyone is right... you are actually looking better and better as you've gotten older! I think you are right that probably recovering from your eating disorder has helped so much (nutrients, hydration, etc). You look so healthy and happy and beautiful! So happy for you!! xo
Your eye makeup is stunning !😍x
Would love you to do a skin care and/or hair care routine video!!
Had no idea Anna had a brother?!
I love the name Alessia :)
Rumours?! Clearly I’ve been blind to everything...
How do u afford 3 kids while UK is so expensive and you want a fourth one hehehehehehe
Francesca is my middle name. Also a family name. ❤️
No cos you said we only film a few bits a day. Your cheeks are huge . Liar
Does anyone know the song at the end?
Do you walk all the dogs at the same time? Id like to see that in a vlog :D
I love your hair in this video! You look stunning xx
You have Grown into Such a Wonderful Lady.. So many Changes Anna, in you Attitude and Really matured beautifully.,💖💖
Could you PLEASE share some insights on having a family in the spotlight, like especially because you are mainly social media based. How do you protect them? Do you get threats? Could you be real about your struggles? For all the moms thinking about blogging but torn about how much exposure to give their children? Any advise?
I’m i the only one who thinks she looks like Jennifer Lopez?
I think people forget that Anna is still only 29 and also is natural beautiful. Not every body needs or wants Botox!
Literally made me feel 100 times better today. I have two kids one is a month old and the other 3 and she has the worse cold. No washing done and no cleaning I feel so guilty but seeing this made me feel so much better
You're so stunning Anna!
U look beautiful
Great video x
love your video anna
You are stunning
I love that alessia has my name as her middle name!
Thanks for this vlog was funny introduction and entertaining! You look great the way you are right now! Keep the healthy lifestyle!
lovely to have your videos again 😊💕
You should take it as a compliment that people think you had plastic surgery 😅
I wanted A name for someone to be on my team .....
You look so beautiful Anna xxx
I don't particularly think you look younger... ditching the bleach blonde and fake tan from the early days defo helped bit you've just grown in yourself.. like everyone does 😂😂
Aww great chat 😁 emilia and eduardo are funny kids 😂 the code word haha truly creative children. Wish you all the best 💖
My son's name is Francesco. My husband is Irish Italian. I am basically British, Irish, German, Scandinavian, and Swiss and also a little European Jewish and North African and a little Portuguese but from America. I am all that because of my ancestors from all those places. MY DNA says 98 percent European.
Please can you do a period/ period horror story video? I love you 💙💗
Anna is so so pretty, and I love your videos!!
I find it funny how there was a video where you said after having Eduardo that you didn't want anymore, now you want 4 kids!
I haven't watched you in ages and I miss you so much 💛💛
Enjoyed this so much!
Anna whatever you are doing you look amazing, and I think you look in great shape compared to even before the third pregnancy. x
U have a brother? Never saw him
I think people think you have had plastic surgery because you look so different from when you guys first started vlogging. Your makeup is drastically different, the dark eye color and orange hair made you look older. People change, you can change your makeup and hair color and look completly different.
can anyone tell me how to open up description/info box on desktop with the new YT interface? :(
Aw Anna! You're such a lovely lady! I love watching your videos!!
I love that your doing 3 videos a week. Missed you Anna
Are you going to show your Fall/ Halloween decorations? I always like to see these.
Anna you are a RAY OF LIGHT! <3
Keep it up, Anna! I love your hair, you look beautiful!
Filled with so much gratitude that you are back to uploading AND blogging! <3
Your foundation looks amazing! What foundation is it?
I am glad you're back.  I've missed your vlogs!  You're one of my favorites.  :)
You know how people think that you have botox, in your face. should take it as a compliment.
Anna is so gorgeous! Her hair looks so nice ❤️
Anna please bring back the baking videos !!
To be honest I never saw myself having kids in the future either, however I’m now 30 and I have a 13 yr old, 11 yr old, 2 yr old and am pregnant with my 4th but I have changed so much and I can’t remember what life was like without they are my life and I wouldn’t change them for the world. Anna you are a true inspiration and I look up to you so much xxxx
loved this! You look amazing! xxx
The way Emilia and Eduardo play together and have such a great relationship reminds me of myself and my brother when I was their age, so lovely to see! Xx
Oh my gosh u look so pretty, ur hair❤️
My first name is Francesca!!!!! :-D
I love how the kids interact with Alessia. I agree with just kind of embracing the madness that comes with three kids! Lol
How clever are Emilia and Eduardo 😂😂
You should be maleficent for Halloween you have the right face shape for her
Anna you are naturally beautiful ignore all the haters there just jealous xxx
Oh no! Lol, I'm currently at the stage in my life at 18 where I don't want to have kids and I just want animals. I used to want to have a kid or two. But after helping raise my two little sisters I'm like no! Haha, Anna you have given me a glimpse at my future! Though, I can only hope to be half as influential and helpful as you!
You look a lot like Jennifer Lopez in this video!!! So pretty!!!
You're so sweet, Anna :-)
Love this video so much😍😍Well done Anna😘😘
Hi Anna so glad u came back and you don't have to explain yourself to us and love u see u guys in Glasgow
👍So happy your back Anna😗
When you're so pretty they think you've had plastic surgery.
That earring story was SO funny! My girls were 3 years apart and they used to scheme. But more often, my littler one would prank or mess with my older one.
You look so pretty Anna! I do think you look younger but I think it's from the kids being around you have so much more energy!
Anna, you look a little like JLO😊
Anna you are So beautiful❤️
I stepped on a pack of good lads too...lol
Yeeey excited for a new video! Your skin and your hair looks so amazing!! 😍\nBTW any small youtubers wanna support each other? 💪🤗💕
I agree when you have a little more weight on you it does make you look more youthful I also think you look so much better now a lot more healthier and also realistic to every women our there and being honest about juggling children , work  and workouts and something had to give we all do this as working mom's and I'm so glad your honest about this issue also .keep doing you and what's best for your family we are just mommy's trying to keep it real 😀
Anna is so beautiful!
Great chatty video 😊I was the same with wanting an organised and tidy house, when I had my oldest ( now 22) I stress so much about it all but when I had my other 2 ( now 8 & 10) I came to realise life is too short to worry xx
I just wanted to clarify that post partum depression doesn't necessarily happen a few months down the track. It can happen at any time. :)
oh my god good lads i'm crying
I mean, your cheekbones are GOALS! Love you! :*
Love your videos and learning more about you Anna. You're so right not to sweat the small stuff, like everything being tidy. My mom told me she regretted being so anal about it when we were small. OXOX 💗💛💜💙💋
Ask Anna series are great, glad you are back!
You look absolutely stunning Anna :)
You are amazing ❤️💯
You're gorgeous anna! Xx
Your hair is gorgeous!
Rock On !!!!!!!
Welcome backkkk :)
Your Hair 😍😍

Your hair looks amazing, Anna!!😍🙌🏻
You're inspiring Anna! Thank you ^^
u r looking fabulous xo
So gorgeous Anna😘X
Cut your haïr short !!!! :-)
you look 40.
Is Anna pregnant again????? If so congratulations your the best family I watch
Funny how when you talk about plastic surgery you say you didn't get your lips filled or Botox but you don't talk about the things you DID get done because that would be outright lying.  Anyone who used to know you (wink wink) knows you got your nose and your boobs done.
I'm so sorry that this is going to sound preachy, but please consider limiting yourself to three kids! More than two and you're actively contributing to overpopulation of the planet (because you're more than replacing yourself and your partner). Your children are lovely and you're a lovely mother, but pleaaaase just consider it.
PPD isn't because you have time to sit around and be depressed....I had my 3rd child in December and let me tell you, I'm struggling with the worst PPD ever. So good for you who doesn't have time to be depressed because I don't either but it happened. I cannot control it.
this will be the best movie ever
22k dislikes... shame to those people
I can not wait to see the movie on December 12 because I live in Denmark ;)
Star wars is dead .Im done FU jj .FU Disney !
So who is The Last Jedi?
So it's empire
All the power around the Rei has a simple explanation: In the Last Jedi we'll see fight between Rei and Kylo,  Kylo takes off his helmet and says: I'm your cousin, Rei!  and cuts her a hand
this will be great  👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👍🏻
Kylo must kill Snoke, it is the prophecy. Darth Vader kills Sidious. Sidious killed his master (Or thought he did) etc
Rey is talking to Luke. And I've got a feeling the power that Luke is afraid of isn't the power that comes from within Rey, because I feel like it's Snoke's power he's afraid of. The more I watch this trailer, the more I think that Rey reaches out, and sees a vision of her being tortured in Snoke's throne room. \n\nBut hey, that's just a theory... A STAR WARS THEORY.
Kylo ren : why am I an only child!\n\nHan solo : your not your a solo child\n\n* kylo kills him * \nAnd that’s why Han Solo is dead
Luke is villain he doesn't want rey's force to go bad
So when anakin Skywalker coming into all this
I think its soo cool they brought Carrie Fisher and Mark Hammil and Harrison Ford and others back into the series, just amazing, RIP my princess..
it looks like their gonna rip off empire.
YES RAY COME TO THE DARK SIDE
Is this the last star wars movie?
If raie goes to the dark side I'm gonna put my face in a pillow and scream
What would make this movie preview so much better? Microtransactions
What I don’t understand is if kylo ren will be good or bad
I feel this is gonna be the rise of the grey jedi.
star wars episode 9 THE RULE OF 2
They had to kill Princess Leia because sadly she past away I think everybody saw this coming after she past away
If you kill luke i will hate star wars
I love that hamster with the goldfish eyes!
I have confidence that this film is gonna be successful.
I think Kyle is turning to the light side because I'm not typing this entire thing
Am I the only person who hasn’t seen one single Star Wars film?!
Awesome! I think their making star wars movie sequels every Christmas I THINK!
so if tge last jedi dies, does it mean the whole Story is over?
Please upload the trailer music only for those of us who completely love it.
Just realized that the lightsaber sound effects line up with the music perfectly
Let's make someone's purse great again! - Latest when C3PO did not appear anymore, people should have realized that it was a big failure to take this franchise from it's creator! Star Wars always was a SCIFI-fairytale, it is a pity that Disney isn't capable to bring good fairy tales to the screen anymore. All this want-to-be mystery mingled into overlong 3D-action-sequences is ruining films for long enough now. I pray that, at least for the final episode, some responsible will remember the importance of dialogues and stories, may the force be with all who are not easily fooled by the dark side!
By the way it's too different back grounds with Rey and kalo at the end.
when i found you i saw ROAR\nuntamed power\nand blonde head\n\nam i the only one
I don't think Luke Skywalker will turn to the dark side of the force. But I do think he will be the villain. I think he is going to try to do the right thing in a real messed up way. Can't wait to see what they do.
Finally a stormtrooper that doesn’t die in one hit and miss
May the dark side of the force be with you
Bring back darth Vader this movie or the others that will come up in time without darth Vader there is no Star Wars he needs to come back I don’t care how but he needs to be back. Can the force bring him back or a mistereus book says that I’m back that is very old but please bring him back
I don't watch star wars
This is sopii awesome! I watch This think More than 10 times! I loven star wars!
Star Wars needs to block this a hole Bagus.
This will be good
That music playing in the background it's...\n\n\n\n\nRAWWWWWW BABY!!!!
Come to the Dark Side of Force!

*sees Carrie* *actually cried*
another last jedi
So much for the remakes. Seriously though, I never felt Episode VII was a remake anyway, but that it was going with what was safe as a way to start the trilogy, then diverge in later episodes. This shows I might be right.
Luke is a marry seu but thats my opinion
Because let's face it, Rey is kind of a Mary Sue character. (That's fan-speak for a thinly-veiled, self-insertion character in fan fiction, usually written by someone who wants not just to be part of an imaginary world they love, but to be its ultimate, most beloved and respected hero. The male version is a Gary Stu.) Rey is a survivor who seems to be consummately skilled at everything she tries. She's a crack pilot. She's a skilled mechanic. She's so innately talented in her use of the Force that she figures out Jedi mind tricks on her own, out of nowhere. She keeps falling into standard-issue damsel-in-distress situations, then capably rescuing herself. Even Han Solo is vocally and visibly impressed with her awesomeness. Her only weakness is a minor and understandable one: She misses the parents who seemingly abandoned her.
Lucas why did you sell your baby to the Jews? They bastardize everything. #BOYCOTTSTARWARS
Luke should have lopped Rey's head off and laughed to end The Force Awakens.
Star Wars is just so screw up
Oh hey cool new Star Wars trailer, this movie's looking pretty good, I'm really excited for- \n*Porg screaming*\nOkay nevermind
But what about the droid attack on the Wookies?
*I'm surprised no one's mentioned how well that line was delivered from Poe in the trailer.*
Literally can't wait for this! \nAlso will sub anyone back within 24hrs!
Definitely the best movie in 2017
OHHHH YAASSSSSSSSS LOVE STARR WARSSSS
Seriously, now Chewbaca is even CGI. I miss when movies used actual robotics and real stages and props.
Guys go over to my channel I’m doing a kylo ten and Rey ultimate fx lightsaber giveaway subscribe like and turn notifications on and leave a comment you will be entered since I’m a small channnel you have a high chance of winning
The Force Awakens was the worst Star Wars movie yet. Hopefully this one will be better.
*all I see is **#Disney** Propaganda PoS like the last 2* nothing here is the Real Star Wars #FakeStarWars
Was so excited for Rey \nCause I thought she got a white saber \nBut turned out to be another generic blue saber \nCan we get a different colered saber for once\nSo far it's just been \nBlue,green,purple,red \nThat's ot\nI wanted a different color because I know that different colored sabers have different meanings\nI was expecting Rey to be a new and different Jedi instead of the same main lead from the past so 2 sagas\nYou have power in you that's so strong and powerful, it can't be contained, we can literally apply this to every star wars movie so far besides rogue one
Why do the lightsabers in this look like big glow sticks? Aren't they usually more like energy? Idk they just don't look very good.
I think I love Daisy Ridley
That ass in that dress though...
at the end they censored all the spoilers but not the swearing haha
cringiest one I've seen all year
If she married Ridley Scott's son and kept her last name, she could be Daisy Ridley Scott. :)
love this xxx please please please do a 73 questions with taron egerton
This interview is homophobic for oppressing my gay ass i can't deal with this
why am I the only person actually noticing how fucked up her face looks
She doesn't even recite the lyrics to Lose Yourself correctly...
Not very attractive. Her bone structure is a bit like a predator or Michelle Obama.
Why does this look like a POV porno from PornHub?
LOVE her! I want that outfit and also THAT HEADBOARD!! Would love to know where it's from! (tho can't afford it lol)
she just increased my Crush for her
Wow this video eerily looks like a porn casting couch. Lol.\n\nRey sucks. Get over yourself. While you're at it bend over like the whore you are and sleep your way to the TOP!!! Suck that dick like there's no tomorrow!\n\nStrong independent! I don't need no man!!! Hah! Fucking KEK.\n\nBring on the fire bitch.
This is such a rehearsed load of pooooo. Those answers are too fast. Lame. Good interviews get into who the person is and their take on their art.
What letter comes before A?, that's her bra size.
oi\nwritting stuff on papaer and saying asking someone questions\nis like yeah i didnt kill any one i just planing this for 4 years HAHAHA\nGAAAYYY!!!!\nso many fags on this earth\n\nTHE END\n::))
BUT WHY CAN'T YOU PLAY LARA CROFT IN TOMB RAIDER >:(
This is the best video on YouTube, it's shot so well and Daisy Ridley is such a powerful woman
I see she's got a DFC.
Dress looks amazing on her
When you lose interest in an actress after you find out more about her.
Can't believe she went for Lose Yourself... Love her!
Get it.... her favorite color is gREY
very cool, like a distant kind of cool, an untouchable cool that is way too cool for an ordinary person like me to even to speak to. so i think that`s cool, i don`t have a crush on her anymore.
Question 74: Is Rey a Mary Sue?
at least its not chelsea like that lunatic cara delevingne
But Mr Robot isn't even on Netflix
Why do I want pancakes all of the sudden?
As a teenager who sometimes struggles with his self esteem, thank you Ms. Ridley.
I find these 73 questions videos extremely awkward and slightly creepy...
She would look even more beautiful with a thick ropey load across her face
please try and do a 73 questions with ryan reynolds
A gorgeous Jedi what more can you ask for?
Who is taking her job?
In Tomb Raider she would be great😉
My idea girl next door😍😍
She's so perky and cute, so wifey overall! I mean, look at her adorable smile and the way she acts and pronounces things like in the beginning when she answers the door, when she said the biggest change in her life being in the movie industry is that she gets to be on  the cover of vogue or after she spoke japanese... She really is ducky though, I wish I could get to know her!
I bet the guy who's interviewing her just wanted to gaze into her beautiful eyes.
73 questions with How to basic please.
where are her boobs at????
She looks like everone's cousin.
To quote Luv from Blade Runner 2049: It is invigorating, being asked personal questions.
The beginning definitely looks like the start to a Porno
These are so bad. Are there any that aren't scripted, or is Vogue too scared to go in blind.
That moment when she started rappin.. whoah! She is a hot and cool babe.
Come on, no love for Doctor Who? =\
I now hate her, she’s an arsenal fan. Personally a Chelsea fan.
Sushi is my fav thing to eat ! It was meant to be <3
Now what part of the teddy bear did you have to touch Weinstein to get the role.
This is the longest Megan rain intro ever
176 bench max is impressive for female actress
Why do they film it like a porno
It's seems like a porno
I can take off my plane now
what colour is her dress?
Is it just me or does she kinda look and sound like Keira Knightley?
The music sounds like porn music
The video looks like shite, Daisy looks beautiful.
Daisy's so beautiful and she is one of my favorite Star Wars characters.
How about 73 Questions with Vogue 73 Questions?
Oh, she's going Down!!!
A question should of been wheres her tits at
Yo why the fuck is maxmoefoe getting asked 73 questions
wtf mr robot is on netflix?
Omg eminem!
Daisy or Emilia ???
Favorite color grey. Grey Jedi confirmed
Yes! Eminem I weirdly knew before
Omg that rap 😍
This feels so rehearsed
come on daisy arsenal really? lmao
TiTs
Nice
her tiddies are inwards godamn😂😂😂😂
73 questions with Millie bobby brown
SO FINE.
Wow, she is pale.

Porn intro
She should definitely play Lara Croft
She reminds me ASMRdarling.
This is painfully scripted

Omg anna’s Bianca voice is so funny. “Oh she’s so stupid”😂
Doesn't Anna just seem so healthy and happy recently? 💙
We are all here to support you Jonathan. You were very brave to post the video. Well done Jonathan
Anna’s Bianca voice is hilarious 😆
Ur amazing for sharing ur story
Thanks for the official hand shake Jonathan. Lol😊🙂😄
This world is shit 😐
I swear these people put a child or the word baby in the title to get trending.
I'm so happy that at the start of the video they gave me an answer to my geography homework and we had to know what Budapest was the capital of 😂😂😂
Jonathan is such a good dad
Anna was so funny in this vlog, I just love her xxx
When Johnathan was talking about those muffins all I could think about was that scene from mean girls; would you like me to assign someone to butter your muffin? 😂
Love love love Anna doing that voice over for the dogs!! 😂😂
Alessia might be the happiest little human on earth 😂❤
Omg anna you kill me with the dog voices it's hilarious! Really looking forward to meeting you guys in Milton Keynes in a few weeks!
I love you guys so much! Such amazing parents ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a big inspiration Jonathan! Your story will help so many people. I love your family and have watched for over a year now 💗💗
Hahaha I love them their so Funny 😂 Jonathan is so brave also
I'm from Hungary 🇭🇺
That voice and clip though.... genius !!!!!
loving the photo in the background at the start, little squid.
So so proud of your bravery, Jonathan ❤❤❤
Anna is so funny, she had me dying in her Bianca voice
Jonathan you are so brave! Anyone who knows you is lucky to have you as a friend
Eduardo is THE sassiest little man and I am in love.
Anna you are amazing with that voice!!!!....I love it~~~Is UK the only place you can buy the smoothies???????
How beautiful is Anna guys??!! And hilarious too!!
Love watching u guys! It brings a smile to my face!💖 alessia is so adorable, emilia is so kind and clever ,Eduardo is so cute and happy, Anna is so gorgeous and Jonathon is so bubbly and sweet! I'll always watch your lovely videos! Xxxxx
As soon as he said #nevercopyanother I Started to copy someone
if you go to bing type in yotube and search at the nside there is a little picture of you guys the saconyjolys
Eduardo's laugh is the best !
Hahaha I love Anna’s bianca voice they are sooooo funny
Hahaha that was the best promotion for innocent 😂 Anna's bianca voice is my fave thing ahhaha amazing!!!
I'm glad you told your mom. I am very sure that the video you posted about your terrible experience helped so many people. You are brave And supported by so many.
Omg lmao Anna's accent for Bianca was everything lol so funny!!!
This video proves that some viewers jump to conclusions way too quick and it proves that no, we viewers don't really know anything because there's so much going on behind the scenes so who are we to speculate. I'm saying this because I was scrolling through the comments of yesterday's video and I saw people being mad about him not telling his mom before putting out the video. So this is for all of you. In your face.
Anna doing the dogs voices is the best. Dying for an episode of the dogs voiced by Anna.
I love when Anna voices the dogs 😂😂
OMGosh, I love that exasperated little breathy laugh that Alessia does when she's excited. Its much too cute!! 😍😍\nAwwww, ballet with Daddy!! How fun!! 💚💜💛\nI love the ending, haha!! When you talk for them its hilarious!! The little Bianca knit was so cute too.
It could be the newer food you’re feeding the pups, that’s causing the staining on their faces.
Anna needs to do a whole video just in the dogs voices. I love it !!
The fAct that you told people what  happened is incredibly brave, inspiring...and shows a LOT of strength...i hope it helps others who have sadly been in your situation...even if they don't feel so alone 💚💚 my heart breaks thinking of how many people have been victim of sexual assault 😢💚
I like how that, despite the fact that you probably had a rough day when you released that video, you remained positive and happy for your kids. I know how hard that is. I have severe anxiety and it’s sooooo hard to be happy for anyone or anything. I don’t have kids but as hard as it is for me to remain happy during anxious times as a single adult with no kids I can only imagine how hard it must be to remain strong in front of your kids when you’re feeling crummy. I’m so sorry about what you went through Jonathan. I’m so happy that you have Anna and the kids to remind you that you’re a great person and Dad and to keep you on your toes and help you get this off your mind.
Alessia seems like such a happy well behaved baby all the time ❤❤
Anna is literally the funniest woman in the world! Love her to bits! I aspire to that woman!!! 💕
Anna couldn't look more beautiful 😍😍
I'm so proud of you for sharing your story. It's so important to open a dialogue for men to discuss their stories too.
Jonathon you helped me with that video you put up as a survivor myself... I admire you so much for speaking up ❤️ I’m coming to see you guys at the baby event at olympia next weekend 😀💙
I love love love when Alessia flaps her arms and makes that joyful breathing noise! I just LOVE it and it makes me so happy. #precious
Anna, why don’t you just take an umbrella with you!!
You are such an amazing human Jonathon xxx
I want to see Eduardo take over the vlog for a day!
God Bless you,  Jonathan.  I can tell how hard that was for you to talk about. I was almost sexually assault when I was 6 by a close relative.  I ran away so nothing ever happened,  however it still haunts me every now and then.  It took me years to tell anyone about it. I'm not sure why,  because nothing happened.  I guess I was just ashamed and that it was my fault for trusting this person.  Just know,  that you're not alone.  I've told my husband and kids what happened and the loved me even more.  Im not sure how I would have felt if I hadn't ran away.
I freaking LOVE Bianca and her funny voice and EVERYTHING I can't with Bianca
Out you will feel better....
I stand by your side no matter what happen to you than and in the future.  I will never abandon you. 💕💕💕💕
The Bianca voice!! 😂 made my day!!
So proud of you jonathan
Anna I think you lost your bonkers hahahaha love you guys
I just love Anna
HAAA!! Anna's Bianca's voice is everything
I’m from Hungary 😊living in Uk 😊
Jonathan you are an amazing man, husband, father and friend to all of us. You are a brave brave man because not any man would have the guts to tell the world something like this. We love and support you. You are amazing because you didnt let this awful experiemce take over your beautiful peronsality, your ability to love and be happy. You are one of the few most amazing husbands a girl could ever want so loving and thoughtful to your wife, kids and friendlist friends !! WE LOVE YOU JONATHAN !!
Irish sounds like a language I can speak called Gaelic
Jonathan is the best!
Jonathan  we can all\nappreciate your courage! Your a wonderful example of strength and character. Your family respects and adores you as do hundreds of viewers. So thank-you for your bravery and bringing another truth to the pitiful silence of sexual assault!
I say the darnn with what others think. It helped you and it will help others. The outcome will be way more good from your release. Well done.
First, thank you Jonathan for sharing your story. I’m sure that was incredibly difficult to do and I’m sorry you had to go through that and live with it. Second, my parents are on a cruise in Budapest as well! How funny!
The dogs voices kill me 😂
emilia at the end was soooooo funny!!!!!
You are so pretty ANNA ❤️
😂😂 Anna should play Bianca in movie
Don't ignore signs of this happening to your children.

Boring unintelligent narcissist parents parade their children for YouTube views shocker
Ok Jonathan. The hungry - Hungary joke is not a good one and not original. Sincerely: a Hungarian person \nLove you though
I don’t even know what the dislikes are thinking!!! This is so brave of you Jonathan 🌎
I AM FROM GERMANY.PLEASE TALk SLOW.LOVE THIS FAMILY.KISSES
Well done for speaking out Johnathon, that can't have been easy to do. Anyone out there who sees this and has someone in their life making them do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, tell someone, a parent, a friend, a teacher, a sibling, a doctor, anyone and don't stop talking until someone helps you

The best song 😍\nI fall in love with it 😍
It wasn't bad, but I'm glad it was about youth/fun instead of just sex. Cheat Codes has so much time to get better and better and I think we will all see them top the charts soon and make incredible music.
This song describes my senior year not only because I was actually failing math but also because I miss being young and care free!
They killed it together
Full screen, then pause, screen shot, there you have a wallpaper hahaha
Hoping for a perfectly directed music video for such a great song. Nice one Cheat Codes.👌😉
Wooow...What a refreshing new sound and keep making hits. It's  so different from no promises.
Now I mean I'm not the biggest fetty wap and I'm very critical of most of his songs because I can't understand him but this is just a great song...mad respect
If u want the song to blow up u have to actually like and share the song!!!
he doesn't mind if he sells his soul to get a song on the radio :v lol

It feels like Fetty Wap's voice in here is changed lol. It's just my opinion so yeah.
Like if your here because of Spotify New Music Friday!

Jaclyn, \nHave you seen companies coming out with bottom falsies? I feel like it would be too much to get have false lashes on the top and bottom. Just wanted to know your thoughts and see if you could do more fall makeup looks!!!
This is an attempt at being relatable while still conforming to the contract. All pro makeup artists can create a mona Lisa outta racoon carp and pine sap. Girls got skills tho. Just tired of commercials masquerading as tutorials and reviews.
I think this look would've looked gorgeous with a white eyeliner. I think the black makes it look to dark for my taste.
LOVE TO YOU! And YOURS!!! GORGEOUS LOOK BABE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
At first I was like “why is she doing red and orange if she’s doing a purple eye look?” But omg it is gorgeous.. like a warm sunset 🌅 😍
Love this look! No trying to be negative, but the TV in the background was really distracting for me. Not a big deal, lol, but I thought I'd let you know!
I think for me, the glitter background is hurting my vision in this video.. I guess I just have sensitive eyes but it's hard to keep my eyes on the video without my eyes getting weary.
Yes ma'am!!! It looks great!!! 💜
I love the back drop...my favorite color is purple. It's so pretty. And it fits your personality....sparkly and beautiful.
The only beauty guru whos actually good at makeup
Did you get ur nose fix ?
Oh yes Background is bomb!
Jaclyn thanks for the video & I love this look. You are very honest and expressive & that’s why we love you. I don’t take offense with your comment about getting this video “out of the way.” I understand that you’re being pulled in a lot of directions & you didn’t mean anything by it. But people are sensitive. Try to edit out these things if you can. You don’t want to distract from your skills. However, at the same time, you can’t please everyone. Your subscribers should know that you love us. Just continue to do your best.
i love you & can u please tell us the earing in your conch im obsessed
Holiday looks with your pallet soon please!!!
Jacklyn can you list the morphe brushes you used particularly the first one and second one.
hey jaclyn i just loved loved loved loved your rose gold eye shadow look it was so beautiful!!!! i also love the gorgeous purple backround you had in the vidieo!!!! i love ya girl and God bless always
Jaclyn I love when you do a home background instead of using back drops, Love your video 😘
Love the backdrop!!!! And I also love ALL your videos!!!!! My makeup game is going strong since I have started watching you two years ago!!!! Thanks for all you do for your fans!!! Love you xoxo!!!
I love the look ❤️ but where did you get your necklace?
Hi Jaclyn, I am from Canada Montreal and I have purchased your palette; Im freaking out over this amazing quality, colors, pigmentation and creamy finish with each shadows!!! Its unbelievable for the price!!! Im gonna have soo much fun with this but thank you for guiding us soo well and taking care of us on your channel!! You are truly a good person! Bravo!! Xox ps love the purple background, we can see u very clearly!!😊
I love the morphe looks I personally love how affordable morphe is and how many looks I can create with one palette! I have the 35R and use it daily. 💃💃
I love you tutorials :) ! Love this look, Perfect for evening out :) What filming gear do you use? are you able to do a tutorial on your new makeup room & filming gear !
Can we please get a look with the blues as the main color I want to learn how to make them more wearable!
LOLOL “I look like a rodent “ 😂😂😂 I love you !!
Love the color combo she used, but, lips look so much bigger! I was distracted...
If you added some green, it could've been a Sanderson sister inspired look!!!
Im ready for a house tour!!! Decorated!!!!
I learn soooo much from you! I love it. You're beautiful Jaclyn! ❤️
I like the backdrops but when I see your home its more cozy and the backdrop can sometimes be distracting
I love this look so much😍 Like my heart beats so fast for this 😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤
I love the natural room background better ❤️❤️❤️ but no background will stop me from watching so go on with your moment girl!
I love the purple back drop! Very fall and hocus pocus feel!
Her lashes are so black, and her eyes are so blue that even when shes with no makeup in her eyes it looks like shes wearing liner! 💕💕🙌🏻🙌🏻
i really dislike these backgrounds lol. i remember you asked what we preferred before, and most comments said natural background were the best
so i work in the kitchen of a restaurant and have no reason to wear this look to work BUT GIRL IM ABOUT TO
I really love this look so much! Its such a unique combination of colors
boyfriend:she look like she just got hit\nMe: it's called a smokey eye 😒\nBoyfriend:don't come at me\nMe: don't come at jaclyn👏
I just found out you live a few house away from me on Davis island can I mane meat you at the park I am you biggest fam ps I live on a canal
The eye look is gorgeous. Purple is my favorite color.  I covet your big doe-y eyes.
Please!!! Do a fenty makeup review!!!!!!!!!!
I've had two people tell me at work recently that I remind them of you, and BIIIIITCH I almost fainted #slayallday
Hey Jac, I really really really love your tutorials, gurl I know you're you're professional but I'm not lol so can you do like a simpler version of this beautiful eye makeup and yet get the same awesomeness out of it. Loves
Girrllll I ordered your palette from beauty bay and I am so excited😘😘❤
This look is absolutely gorgeous thanks for the inspiration 💕
I love when you do videos like this. You are really talented when it comes to teaching and expanding what your doing with intricate eye looks. Really beautiful!! Super chill video and I loved it!!!
LOL the end of this video is hilarious! Love you!!
Why not list the products and brushes you use in the description box? It would be helpful. BTW not trying to be rude but what is it that you are doing to your hairline at the very end of the video?
Get a grip people. She is showing us how to create a look with colors and technique. For the love of God you must know you can use any brand or pallet, as long as you have similar colors. She never tells us we have to use specific brands. Use your heads!!!
Love love love the background its perfect :))
I am a huge fan but i did not like it. Wish you would do a favorites video soon. ❤️
Would love about a dozen or two more look tutorials using your own Morphe palette!!!!! Please!!!!! There are literally hundreds of looks that could be done that its overwhelming to make a decision. That's why I like you to do the looks for us!! LOL
I’m so sad! I tried to order pallete and the website won’t let me!!😭😭😭😭
what's the song in the beginning???
Love the makeup look and the necklace, where is it from ? 😍
What’s the name of the song
Was laughing so hard at the end when john scared her.
Not feeling the background! Love the natural setting! AND THE LOOK OF COURSE!! LOVE IT
Does anyone know what eye primer she uses?
Jaclyn I love you and I learn so much from you! I would love to see some more simple, easy, quick makeup looks:) like easy eye looks or quick makeup! Thanks!
Please do more tutorials with your palette 😭😭 help a completely clueless makeup user 😩
Can u do a look with fenty beauty or a rewiew video ? Btw u look beautiful as always💋😍
I love love this look! The backdrop is beautiful but kinda to much I feel like it takes away from your makeup look.
Jaclyn did u get a nose job?!
Girl I need to see you do a Pat Mcgrath mothership, pretty pleeeeeease. I need to know if it's worth buying 💖💖💖 help!!
You’re like an eyeshadow wizard!! Your technique is like perfect 💖
Oh my god you're hilarious , your bloopers have me dying!!!! I love you, you're such an inspiration ! Gorgeous look💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🌸🌺🌸🌺🌸🌺🌸
Living for this purple look! I'm trying to be more adventurous with colours so I'm doing this next! Gorgeous! Wish I could afford all those brushes and the new morphe palette 😫
Gorgeous eye look! Love it 😍 I also love the purple background ❤️️
LOVE THIS FALL EYE😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
So pretty! 😍 love the purple.
THESE PALETTES SPEAK TO ME SO MUCH

ahhhh yes girl I loved this look!!!! please don't forget about us and give us more tutorials please!!! love you jaclyn!!!
You guys complain about her using the same brand yet she did it for herself and you wanted her to make a video on it.. Just. Appreciate.
When she stops talking and you can hear hocus pocus, I’m like GIRL WHAT PART YOU ON?! IS BINX DEAD YET!?

😊😊😊😊😊😊gracias.  solo con ver un poco de tu video me cirvio perfectamente para hacer algo parecido. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺😊😊😊😊😊.
I think it's possible you have misunderstood the way to wire up that board. Normally you don't have to connect anything from the PWR IN to the three relay connections. Your wiring of the relay connections is unusual and may be the root of your problem. So, one solenoid contact goes to battery ground, but the other goes just to N/O and NOT to N/C. When your signal reaches the unit, the contacts switch over and the solenoid gets power. You might want to try it
You should make a mini bike (taco bike)
Relays for the most part will always need a common connection. Also you would wire using NO contact of the relay meaning no current flows to the valve under normal conditions. When you activate the relay (button) you close the circuit allowing current flow to the valve.
Beware that if you are using two or more lithium batteries, do not. I repeat DO NOT short them. They have to be wired properly or you will get hurt. Batteries may explode.
Time to build one for my aquarium. Remote controlled water changes hell yeah lol
8:40 That absolutely makes sense and makes the board more flexible.\nWhen you want to switch a 120V or 240V device you shouldn't power the receiver and the relais with that voltage. So you need two different power inputs.
Oh so this is the huge project you promised us...

Love your vids keep it up
I had a problem with a neighbours cat, which used my garden as a toilet.  I made an almost identical box but put a PIR on it so that the cat got sprayed anytime it walked past.  I'm guessing the cat didn't like it very much, because he took his business elsewhere.

Guys! Stop Commenting This is Boring He Did It For Himelf And Recorded it...
I have always wondered where the name jubelee clip comes from( not sure about the spelling), could someone explain please?
Colin that Relais is a potential free one they are *ALL* Like that.
colinfurze!! i hate you dude!!! you are too damn good mann.. you just makes me ashamed of myself and my skills :P haha this is a really good idea i'm from Denmark and i don't know if its common other places but in denmark you can buy/rent a little garden too grow stuff or just enjoy and must people have a little house on them too, its nice for people living in apartments and not having a yard. but its fucking cold in Denmark so if the water is still open doing the winter, it will freeze and blow the pipes.. so this gave me and idea too be able too close of the water from home when its starts freezing in October ;P, guess i need a long range remote, my garden is about 2 km from my home but still! \nand a little obvious advice. when making holes in plastic... use heat. warm a knife or whatever.. take it from a guy who have build more bongs then Ron De Jeremy has appeared in porn :P\n-good day you bastard..
Wouldn't you connect the negative from the solenoid to the GRND, between the NC and NO? Since I was under the impression that ground is negative and there are these three position switches that have one lead in at the center and  a lead out to either side for the two differen on stages and the off in the middle.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, please! :)
Can u make a flying car
If the diameter of your hose is too small, dip the end in hot water for a while to make it pliable so you can force it onto/over the fitting.. Or as Colin might say, Pop the end of yer hose in a fresh hot cup of tea, and it will come out a little bit stretchy and you can bang it right on there.
Here in the states, we call those jublie clips hose clamps, but I like the British name better. 😁
I am sure lot of people come here because of the crisp English he speaks
Could totally use this in a similar fashion to the airsoft gun doorbell...
This one is bad. That's not a good circuit, electronics are in the same box as the hydraulic valve, without spacers and not only you messed up the relay NO/NC contacts, you didn't know why common needs to be connected. The reason is that this way, you can also use it to switch 230V mains if you want. Seems like a useless project, since the two 9V batteries likely won't last a week in NO configuration or even a day in NC configuration (those solenoid valves draw a lot of pixies and the relay box is just inefficient).
Bring back the old Collin
why are you shooting at 50fps?
is it just me that misses the times where Colin made 360 swings, apocalyptic under ground bunkers, guitar flamethrowers and hover bikes incited of garden hoses . i love do colins work and respect his decisions. but relay a garden hose?
This is perfect for one of my current projects! I am building a portable fog machine and although I have a way to blow the fog out of it, I didn't have a way to keep it in when needed.
You said it right first time Colin, but at 6:22 you got it backwards.
More of explaining Things
That awkward moment you realize that the  'crazy inventor'  has turned into a boring instructable author who doesnt seem to grasp how relays work
What you say about the  'extra wire' and 'cheap board' in fact  is no more than logic. The relay  is just separated from the rest, it just switches and carries no potential from the board. That means that you could also use it to switch  say 220 Volt AC, and still have yr  board  separated from the grid
Only Videos for YT Red and adverts? Nice one, unsubscribed...
why would you use 18V for a 12V circuit?
Why is this in my recommendation list?
the pranks that you could play with this... ahh the posiblity is endless
I went to your presentation at Westfield academy I was the one that asked you why don’t you put a Camera on that
Would it be possible to wire one of these up with a motion sensor?
I thought this was a prank. Expecting it to really be a flame thrower or something. But no. \nI was really. A remote.  Controlled.  hose. Valve.   \nC’mon Collen.
So it's a DIY electrically actuated ball valve?
Hey Colin I love ur videos and I have just ordered your book - keep up the good work
5:41 A little bit of tape for protection..... Hmmmmm🤔
I would bury that, replace the 9v with a 12v 1.2Ah sealed lead acid battery and have a solar panel to charge it during the day so it can be maintenance free for a few years.  Nicely done.

21 Savage is Something New
One of his best songs
i thought he had no heart 😭
The fact that racism is systemic in our society and police are constantly stereotyping and killing innocent black men is a huge problem that needs to be talked about in every outlet. I myself am black and I really like 21's music. But even considering \nthat....21 Savage is the last person to be talking about this problem. 21 was doesn't reject the gang lifestyle, he embraces it. Others get out of the ghetto by keeping out of trouble and getting normal jobs, 21 spent his youth being a violent criminal, he became rich and famous off of rapping about it, and he's only stopped it now because of his rapping career. Based on the fact that most of his raps are still about that same stuff, I really doubt that he doesn't still have friends who are still in that lifestyle, and I really doubt he condemns it. It's because of people like 21 that black guys are stereotyped as violent criminals. I could take this song and roll with it if it was from somebody like Kendrick, but from 21 it just does not sit right. Sorry, his flow still hot tho.
This was sooooo deep and so true man ✊🏿
1 HOUR VERSION IN MY CHANNEL CHECK THIS OUT!
Hands up don't shoot was plagiarized and made up. Look at facts.
Raps about killing people and now he’s making a song complaining about murder. Fucking retard
Do something about it

This is like the yba music video good move on 21
21 is pretty Darn Ugly if you ask me !
This is hard asf. I didn't know he could rap like this with actually substance.

amber rose changed this nigga .. savage tf is happenin
Ooo fuck u 21 savage, lost a fan
ever since he got with Amber Rose, he changed from 21 Savage to 21 Sweetheart lol
Why you think we skip school and hanged out on the pavement🔥🙏
This is something new.\n\n\nEdit: I just read the title. I was wrong.
More need to speak up for people who voices don’t matter, 21 you did that ✊🏽
this shit ant good at all
If you guys seen his interviews from day 1 since he blew up yall would know something like this was coming.  People are too quick to judge so no wonder this caught them off guard.  21 gonna go down as a legend.  Maybe not pac and biggie level but his story will be one to be remembered.
I will never look at 21 the same way. That was deep
lyrics aint deep. Every other rapper rap about the same shit. like 21 saying it aint nothing new. same old shit on the block. Black people killing each other but they don't care. Black people only care when a white man kills a black person. Black on black violence black people cant be bothered with it.
I can't cap 21 is one of the greats
i know you trying to be deep and all that but i had to search up the lyrics to know what you were saying. like if you want to preach a heart felt message open your mouth please.
Check out this app 👉 https://sweatco.in/hi/kadan138460 ... It pays for walking
When are people going to stop thinking that black people are just animals and stop killing us I like what 21savage is doing if a bunch celebrities gather up people will stop killing black people because most people like to listen and do what famous people do so if famous people start saying stop killing black people then people will stop killing them.
this is real fucking rap in our genre, of mumble rappers but 21 kills it with a tupac real nigga feel to it, he speaks from the soul from my opinion
B I S C U I T!!
So what. He and many rappers  rap 90 to 95% rap  about drugs,  sex, murder, and other crimes and immoral things, and they get glorified and put on pedestals.\nNow, he wants to act like he is speaking up for civil rights or something?! \nI wonder how many murders have been committed in America ,\njust this year- by those who were motivated by this same dude ....
I want to see this song on a Genius video
21 savage had a ghost writer trust me

why is this so true
Who else took a knee watchin this? 🔥🔥
They was hanging us on ropes 💯💥
Finally some one talking bout the hood like what it really is . fucked up
It’s not even a good song tho
So is this song just bashing whites or what? Lol
Why tf you think they want us to be slaves. #profit. It's gotta be all love an trust fuck what anyone think!
21 is not savage anymore since he hung with jake paul
I almost cried . 😂🤷🏻‍♀️
If he wasnt famouse this song will be shittt
They used to treat us like slaves, now they lock us up in cages They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke It's all about fucking white people..god this annoys the fuck out of me there is more black on black crime than any police violence you fucking morons. & all this does is improve more and more racism you're just reminding the blacks to hate us..every fucking dumb ass white person who did that shit to you guys back then are dead now..that whole set of people are all dead now..now it's a new age and we're not bad..we just live our fucking lives and we try to stay away from being in black neighborhood because all you guys ever do is steal, murder etc etc. You guys chose to live your lives like a gang banger..when you could've just grown up as a average person and not got yourself into the gang life, but that's what you chose. Black people are brainwashed by society to sag their pants and be a gangster in order to fit in with their niggas it's bullshit everything would be different if you guys would live your lives normally and not choose violence to be cool for your gang & your homies , Us white people live our lives in peace and we work hard and we don't choose violence we live our lives peacefully. When a black person goes down a white neighborhood they're not scared, but when a white person goes down a black neighborhood they are because all there is, is gangsters looking at you and shit.
if ur black u have a better chance to being  rich most rappers r black most sport players r black and in america the only county that gives u millions to throw a fucking ball stop hatin on it or the president also how can sport players talk about trump like ur getting millions wtf can ur problem be
Damn I aint savage could rap like this

Grammy! Love it. Like a grammy means anything anymore.
Is this for the 2018 film?
FUCK ME UP BITCH MY WIG IS ALL THE WAY IN HADDONFIELD
Anyone know if this will be in the next movie?
This is brilliant,  just stunning.
This could be played at an Industrial-Gothic scene nightclub.
http://www.soundincense.com/writings \nLoved the sound design. Here's my poetic interpretation of the track. All hail trent and atticus! \m/
In order to make the new Halloween film work, it has to be set in the 70s or early 80s. Serial killers like Myers worked better 30+ decades ago because they can exploit the limitations of technology back then. No cell/smart phones, no internet, different music, clothing, and creepier sense of danger.
I like to see this Halloween music by Trent reznor I love it
Is that the Kubrick sound underneath it all?
Cool. Gave it a thumbs up. Not as good as the original though.
I've never heard of Atticus Ross.
This is great for what it is. But I like the original best because the mood isnt exxagerated like most modern horrors which i think makes them more fun than scary to watch
So this is what happened to Trent as a kid!
Not as good as the original, but still pretty damn good.
It's aight,  I've made several versions of this theme,  too easy
Some things should just be left alone. \n\n#nothingissacred
wtf is this crap? Carpenters original is clearly superior. None of the heart, the tension is overproduced, it has lost all of its 80s nostalgia, and the instruments used all seem off for that same reason. All the extrenous fluff in this piece, reminds me why this generation can't for the life of them make good horror movies unless handheld by the previous one.
They should definitely use this for the reboot second attempt
There seem to be two types of comments.\nI like it for what it is.\nI dislike it for what it isn't\nDon't let your expectations rob you of appreciation, my friends.
That drop was awkward... original still better
This sucks ass! It’s a bad cover of a cool song. Too much extra shit.
That bed sheet Michael would make an awesome wallpaper!
Sorry, but all I hear is a bunch of white noise with the vague sound of Carpenter's theme within it. Too bombastic.
TOTAL CRAP IT'S A DISGRACE TO THE HALLOWEEN THEME
I guess I’m the minority I don’t hear anything special or remarkable in this rendition.
It sounds like a rob zombie rehash of dogshit  i hate it . Why not just go with a mix of 1978 and 1981 than this crap its horrible iam a halloween franchise fan this theme sucks
Definitely prefer the original but this is a caustic soundscape of torturous rapture...I love how it fucks with us, the shrill chilling scraping noise sculpture over the main chords & riff...Reznor & Atticus have always tantalized me with their sound art...can’t wait to see this version play out on the big screen
Too much. It sounds completely digital. The original is much more unsettling. I sat in the theater and watched the original. Some things just cannot be improved upon.
I'm a fan of Trent's music, and an obsessed fan of the entire Halloween franchise. \nThat being said, I did not care for this song AT ALL.\n\nThey made the traditional piano part that comes in at 2:10 sound now like a toddlers xylophone. It literally made me involuntarily make a disgusted face. I do like the old sounding synthesizer, but that's about all the enjoyment I get out of this. \nEverything just sounds like they over lapped random white noise to try and sound scary, but it fails hard for me and just becomes frustrating because it sounds like nothing. It's almost as if you played the Halloween theme on one stereo, and also had another stereo playing one of those Halloween cd's with all the various spooky sounds and stuff. It sounds cluttered, and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what you're hearing. I'm sure I'll have pitchforks and torches coming my way, because god forbid someone has an opinion different from yours in 2017.
I hate the intro. It's way to long with just wind blowing. It sounds good. But leave out the rob zombie version. I here it in this
God this is crap. Please don't touch stuff from John Carpenter or anything else.
I'm sure as hell not gonna be mad if myers comes out and stabs me to this lmao
New version is nice, but I still can't get the image of that cat washing the clothes out of my head.
Not seeing what's so amazing about this rendition...
OH MY GOD-- THESE GUYS CAN DO WRONG RIGHT NOW
Cries, echoing the sound, legs are slowing now, stabbed i'm going down. ALL I WANNA DO IS MAKE IT STOP!
i love listening to horror movie themes while walking on the side walk in my neighbourhood in fall season. It makes me feel like im in a horror movie.
That Slenderman nod at the end though.
Nothing is wrong with the original! Nothing needs to be added!
Always heard the influence on “Something I can never have” piano.
Well I hope I never hear this again,wtf were they thinking?? It's awful.
Well that was not as cool as I had expected. Needed more NIN
Can’t wait for Carpenter’s 2018 update on the original. ❤️
that would be a good song for Frankenstein. Josh Freese on drums?
What's Carpenter's critique of it? It's a great rework but what the master of horror thinks of it?
Don't like the minute of silence at the beginning. Otherwise ... not a bad remake.
Damn, radical
Nice
Dude fuck yeah, this is so rad
Oh Trent... you amazing creature.. ❤️
It's 80s synthesized.
Shite.

Not impressed.

Wow that's very nice indeed
Fucking awesome! If they don't commission these guys for 2018 movie Ima be PISSED
Trent does stripped down electronic so well. I really dug this.
This is a brilliant version. Sign me up for some more  ;)
This is amazing!! Better than the original soundtrack 👏👏👏👏👏
Oh man this is the stuff. \n*P E R F E C T* for Halloween!!
This is almost as amazing as RJD2's remix of Goblin's Suspiria.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZcydyS1qTg
a mix of psycho, duke dukem 3d and halloween 6.
Better than the original ... Sick shit
I work at a haunted attraction and this is a kick ass track reminds me of the haunt :)
Never thought the original could be bettered, brilliant.
Amazing! Trent reznor's style is something that gets me everytime.
I smell a new ringtone..
Aaaaaand of course they make it better than the original 😌😍 #loop
Not always a fan of covers but this one has the menacing quality of the original - updated version ✓
Wish I could hit that like button more than once. I'd just spam the goddam thing.

I love it.
Hell Yeah
FUCKING GOOSE MOTHERFUCKING BUMPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes yes yes
COOL
My God
YESSSS THANK YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dope af
I've been a Halloween fan my entire life but its things like this that make me embarrassed to be a part of the fan base. For the first time in 35 years Carpenter is officially on board with a sequel and is planning to do the music. And his music is a HUGE part of what makes Halloween special. Not to mention he has a longstanding reputation for creating numerous other classic film scores. So, Amazing news. Right, Halloween fans? But here's why I hate you. Because what's more amazing is how quickly you little fuck heads will turn and start campaigning for someone else to do it because something new comes along. Such as this new overrated theme. What the hell has Trent Reznor ever done in the horror genre to be considered a better pick to score the film than the man who created the original Halloween? What? Be lead singer of NIN? Who gives a shit. This is a film, not a rock video!!! Does anyone want this film to be scary? Have that classic Halloween feel and atmosphere? Not gonna get that with Trent Reznor. Jesus, You are the same people that thought it would be a good idea for Rob Zombie to make Halloween movies. Are you mostly all little kids? I think you have to be. Some of these comments are absolutely laughable. He made a theme, people. One theme. And its not Gods gift to Halloween themes, either. I've heard plenty of Halloween themes made by nobodies that were more impressive than this. What the fuck is wrong with you fans? How about showing some respect and understanding just how incredible it is that Carpenter is going to create another Halloween score. And show support for that. Not a fucking rock singer. My God. You guys are embarrassing.
What a fag!
Reminds me of my husband on our wedding day, I cried too.
n'awww adorable
Nice but it’s very generic
Very cool track, I'm not so fan of this generic future house drop but the melody and Vassy's vocal in particular are amazing :)

Am I the only one who thinks that the vocals of Vassy started at a weird point  of the instrumental? It just seemed off to me :/\n\nEdit: Also her timing right before the drop hits is weird to me.\n\nCorrect me if im wrong :P
I loved Logan and Children of Men is one of the best films ever made, so I had a lot of fun putting this one together! *What films would you like to see me tackle in the future?*\nAlso, if you happen to be looking for stock footage for a project and want to help support LFTS, check out the 7 day free trial of Videoblocks: http://bit.ly/LFTSVideoblocksTrial
The Last of Us is similar, I think
Whatever you do, whatever you make, I always love all your videos :)
Really wish this was longer..I love these videos so much
Love this channel! I used your advice from the Star Wars LFTS to make the protagonist of my short film more active! Thanks for making my writing better.
Never seen Children of Men but it kinda reminds me of V for Vendetta. Why are the British so convinced they will be the last country standing(and why do they need to turn Fascist to do so)
Eyes Wide Shut is one of my favorite films of all time. I can't figure out why tho. DO IT PLEASE :-D!
Fuck man, I love this episode
We really need an analysis on Acts 2 and 3 as well.
I wonder if the academy has the guts to give Jackman a best actor Nom for Logan?
Okay, I would pay you to do a full analysis like this of your favorite movie. These videos are insane.
(sorry about my english) I've never watched CHILDREN OF MEN, so I've watched only for watch this video. Amazing movie and analysis. Thank you.
It's almost been a year since I started the 3rd draft of my novel for NaNoWriMo. I finished it in the summer time and have been taking a break from it to build my business, and I am often contemplating revising it soon.\n\nTHIS video essay has inspired me to come up with way better revision ideas than I had thought of the past year. Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \n\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\n\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel. It truly helps a lot!
This is the best video on this topic I EVER! Wow, you're amazing. Keep it up Michael.
The Last of Us fits this mould perfectly as well. Literally the exact same narrative arc.
could you please do the Shawshank Redemption next? \np.s. I love all your movies. Keep it up :)
I would love to hear you talk about an Edgar Wright film. Any of them really (my favorite is the World's End and no one talks about it). Anyway, great observation, great editing, thank you. I always look forward to your videos, keep it up.
I love how, even though I'm a writer and not a director, most of the lessons you cover are applicable to my work. Big thanks as always.
This was fantastic!! Man...thank you for making these.
You are great at this. Thanks you for this. I love your essays. And also, your voice is soothing.
Once again, congratulations, Michael. I believe this to be one of your finest works yet. It's quite a pleasure to watch such thought and well-crafted analysis every week. By the way, I also consider Logan as one of the best films of this year, but I must say I did not care much for Children of Men after I first saw it, many, many years ago. After this wonderful essay, I sure will give it another chance. Greetings from Argentina.
Beautifully said.  I absolutely adore the analysis in your video essays, keep up the great work!
Soo, doing it only for the money lead to bad things eh? That's one similarity
While not a favorite of mine, I would love for you to do a analysis of Annie Hall, especially after seeing your video on When Harry Met Sally. I'm really surprised to not see anyone else request this one.
Do Where the Wild Things Are
This was fantastic. Thank you.
I really enjoyed watching this video
wait did cleo die? i thought he just passed out. fuck...im just gonna pretend i didnt hear that
What is the music at 4:50 - 5:27? I cant find it on the sound cloud :(
Wow this was super helpful for me thank u!
Interesting video (for a change ^^)! Have you seen Blade Runner 2049?
Man, this video is great!
Do something over Jack Reacher Never Go Back
Dammit, I need Act 2 and 3! Great work man!
Logan is not a great movie, Children of Men on the other hand, it is
Love the video and the way it pleasantly surprised me. Also could you or anyone else please tell me the film music used in this video?
Had Clive Owen been ten years younger, he would have made an interesting Logan.  Had Hugh Jackman been ten years younger he would have made an interesting James Bond.  Hmmmm.  Not that Clive played Bond, but when you look at the old BMW ads he starred in you could see he woulda been a good one.
Try comparing Moulin Rouge and Star Wars because both have (possibly surprising) foundations in mythology/hero's journey, which is of course quite the common archetype for stories.
i think it's really interesting that the last of us could be considered a hybrid of both these character arcs. Joel is also a man devoid of hope for the future who travels across america with a young girl who symbolises hope. He also learns both how to love (value of family like logan?) and how to hope for a future again. P.S very solid video, well done
what about doing Leon or maybe a cartoon like rick and morty or a foreign film \nlove the channel!!!
While this is a video essay analyzing two screenplays, its like a short film in itself. Fantastic.
Yes yes and yes. Keep ‘em coming.
Always looking forward to your videos ! Thank you !
Awesome video. I like videos of this kind. However, i feel like the arc of Logan has been done a million times in different and better ways. I cant say anything about Childre of Men, because I havent seen it
You doing a great job in these videos. Thank you😊
End is the beginning. So basically the Last of Us
so basically the end is a new beginning?
Man, I get choked up just seeing that shot of Laura tilting the cross with no context or audio. Who'd have thought a comic book movie would be able to make me cry?
With the release of Justice League coming soon, I would love to hear your thoughts about the concept of the 'team up film'. I'm not only talking about Justice League and the original Avengers film but also films like Seven Samurai, Inception, Ocean's Eleven, the Dirty Dozen, the Usual Suspects and even Armageddon. This is a tired and true concept as it can work across all genres but it seems very hard to succeed at because not only do you need to have your team work towards a goal but each member of your team needs to have their own moments and unique personalities. What are some tropes you see in this particular format as well?
I found children of men a much better film in pretty much every way, Logan in my opinion was a poor film in general with a weak plot and weak characters
....So this is what it feels like...
Silence of the Lambs\nAmadeus\nIncredibles\nHer\nAll About Eve\nDead Poet's Society\nFargo\nExorcist\nGreen Mile\nChinatown
You always seem to make the exact right video for me. Keep up the good work! Love your videos
Logan is a generic knockoff of Children of Men
Great analysis of these movies. I really liked how you introduced a couple other influencing books. I am eagerly awaiting the next one!
Do you rip all the film footage yourself?
I was reminded of Children of Men the whole way through Logan, or at least until that stupid clone turned up.
Completely love this and all you videos... But every time you said Theo and Logan my mind drifted to Bill and Ted
Thank you for your content!
Great video. You left out a key part of Logan's normal world that shapes the lie he believes. Logan' has lived many many years. Bad things happen to people he cares about because he has lived so long and through so much. He always outlives the people he cares about both because he is virtually indestructible and because of the longevity of his life. His mutant gift is his curse and shapes the way he has viewed the world for a long time. That curse gives depth to his pain beyond the simple statement that bad things happen to those he cares about.
no one is talking about the last of us being the love child of these 2 movies!
thanks for discussing two of the best films. I am glad to have subscribed to your channel. Thanks.
Very well done comparison. I enjoy your essays and love the references you use as supporting evidence.
Probably one of my favorite videos of yours I have seen thus far. I always share them with my writing group; though we are novelists, work like this shows quickly concepts which are difficult to grasp without hours of reading and analysis.
Great job man. Keep it up
logan is a joke. do inherent vice
This reminds me a lot of the hero's journey.
Your essays are amazing as always, thank you
Very Intriguing Micheal, thank you. Could you do an analysis on The Secret Life of Walter Mitty about how to make an audience reexamine the mundane
Wow this has helped me so much. So simple. I never picked up those books you mentioned in the face of all the other inches and yet that so simple explanation about the lie just clicked into my head about the heroes journeys. Making it so much more accessible to me as a writer. Thank you! Def. gonna check the book out now.
Never would have compared the two but your breakdown is so interesting
I see in this so many stories I love and characters i deeply care about. Amazing essay, thank you.
This Was Absolutely PERFECT!!!
I misread the title and I thought it's going to about how the end of the movie is really a new beginning hehe.
Im a literature student and im interested in screenwriting; for me these videos are GOLDEN keep up the good work man!
wow what a discussion. mindblowing! keep it on!
The Last of Us does this too.
Hey! I love your text animations when you cutaway to a book quote. Do you use a preset for these animations? Do you mind if I ask how you do it?
review rudderless
Great video! I finally have Truby's book and it's a great resource, everything is laid out in depth and detail and once you see the structure, it's hard to 'un-see', such is the consistently refined nature of story-telling.\n\nStill waiting on The Godfather!
You can easily make the same comparison with The Last of Us
Throughout this clip I couldn't help but draw parallels between this formula and the video game , 'The Last of Us'. Anybody who hasn't played that, by the way, get on it. It is a masterpiece.
The Dresser and Birdman.
Good job.
Brilliant
You are truly amazing!
This was excellent
OMG! Great!
One  kingman
Good job mate...
You're awesome

Great as always.
Something on Mr.Robot?
Please do Donnie darko
Great video! Would love to see your analysis of Big little lies
can anyone explain why the refusal is necessary? I often feel that this part appears old-fashioned...
Another perfect video yet again by the genius of you. Thank you! (: I wasn't too interested in seeing Logan but I am now because of this video. I would like a video on Moonrise Kingdom or Fantastic Mr. Fox :P
You've made a lot of amazing and useful videos. I have to say, this is the best and most important lesson you've taught.
Man, I really want to watch this video. I guess I need to see Children of Men.
that was a very CUTE video. good job CH
Still unfunny and none of this ever happens lol
Went on too long for something really not funny.
Trying to break stereotypes by showing a whiny woman.
Ugh Reika is this worst thing that happened to ch
This new person pisses me off
This is a joke by the way.
I felt like she took Katie's role in this one, funny all the same.
I think the real question is: how far is too far???
Such an awesome video Rekha is such a good addition to the team!
that ending was pretty funny tho
She straight up committed suicide. Women are idiots. Specially blondes.
I find it funny but I feel stupid for laughing at the same time... strange
Kids this is what bipolar personality disorder looks like 😂
Who says women have to apologize or can't take up space...?\n\nAlso, micro-aggression's don't exist.
god thank you reika\nlove this so much
To be honest, women basically have all the rights of men in basically all developed countries, it's just the little things that need to be sorted now.
This was a cute video
Looks and feels so much like the acute OCD I had sometime back, which almost killed me. I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad! :():
Collegehumor has become like the Onion. I like it, but all I need is the headline to know what the entire piece will be and how it will go. I predicted that the presentation would be on kittens the second he called it cute and she rejected that. Comedy is about discongruency. When you make a formula out of it, you cannot get that discongruency.
The payoff was worth it. GJ CH
Rekha grosses me out
Plez don’t turn into buzzfeed
omg the katie splish soda add out the window
Guys it’s ironically funny ok?
Hilarious! The thumbs up shot at the end was priceless.
That was a cute video... Sorry
I think it's a certain personality thing, I felt so bad today at work because I spilt hot oil on my hand and I swore super loud and everyone froze. I still feel guilty about it because it was like I made a scene. My boss even let me off earlier and I felt bad because I couldn't stay and help during the late rush. I was already on overtime so I had to go
Most of that wasn't even representing a woman standing up for herself, that's just her being rude lol
Why are ch videos always so gross in the end?
Katie always kills these super short appearances!
Please do another google earth guys
The inner struggle of a by curious feminist
Its cute to make out all men are the same. Dead cute love.
The struggle is real!
Everything about that ending was perfect
Would the accept and reject thing a reference to Schrödinger's cat because of the cat calendar
I love how the only other person who gets this is the other woman in the office 😂
Not funny !  Schizophrenia is no joke.
She’s a ticking feminist bomb
“I’m a little sorry. I don’t like yelling, it makes me feel bad.”
Cuz this girl would have got the job at CH if she was a white male
When watching this, I thought, But what if she was presenting over something that actually was cute? And bam of course she was lol
So man never have to stand up and are always the bad ones?
Its sad that women are scared to speak up for themselfs
That commercial in the background tho😂
I love how half the comments on these kind of videos are 'I don't think I should look in this comment section'. Guys, we get it, just stop looking in the fucking comment section
K so, this obviously isnt only a womens issue, besides that pretty great
The satire here is brilliant\nBut seriously, both men and women feel like until they are seniors at a company
Not sure if I dare to venture into this comment section.
The inner struggle of both women AND men when talking about women equality are depicted in this video. I love it.
Strong man vs strong woman thing to do. Why not just a strong person? Isn't that the goal? Why draw a line? Do feminists even understand what equality would actually entail?
At my company, if this happened, I think most savvy women wouldn't say anything, but would give a dirty look, and most men would pick up on it. Then the man who was demeaning would be talked about negatively by everyone.
Well done! The message of the video was really cute!
I enjoyed very funny and true
Her name is Rekha.. Pronounced as Raekha
Lmao that ending was exactly what I thought it would be. Great twist
Progressive sketches done right. Good job CH!
I love how college humor makes videos that look like they're gonna be social justice-y but actually make fun of both sides really well
I knew there were going to be kittens in the presentation.
Please stop doing these politically fueled sketches, I come here to get away from politics etc
It kinda seems like Schrodinger's paradox when she accepts and she doesn't .
This is exactly how the inside of my mind looks like...
You're not funny anymore.
Love this, feel this, relate to this.
So cute!!!
Fucking buzzfeed
Oh my god feminist bullshit
Free
Ughhh
Reika just isn't funny.
This was disturbing
Deep
Lol
Lmao feminists in 2017
Drink Splish?
Please do Precious Plum again!
Cute video
Plot twist: she was doing a presentation on puppies and kittens
Oh god the secondhand embarassment..... it hurts....
Is collage humor becoming buzzfeed??
What is this? Buzzfeed?
but girls r cute af :(
Help me
WTF happened to you collegeHumor? such weak shit nowadays...
This back ground music tho! hahahaha
Lmao copywriter
GO FEMINISM!!
Yaaaaawn. Welcome to life. Happens to everyone.
shes def bipolar lol
I guessed puppies
This was very unfunny. I'm not saying it was unfunny because of the subject matter, but it just feels like a very lazily-written skit.
Pretty well done but I wish CH didn't have to contrast scenes with violence for their punchlines as often as they do.
I really with college humor would not make so much politically charged bullshit.
I swear, I bet you no female has had this exact scenario happen to her.
She needs a spa day.
I hate this chick's videos. God, I want comedy, not to watch an SJW push her agenda.
Wait. Women must apologise but you don't apologise... \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes that mean you are a man???
Stop taking this seriously it's a comedy sketch
I'm not picking on collegehumor but Google is evil and they make Google millions themself.

Wtf is this retarded shit
What ARE you???
We could make religion out of this.
Just a shit day. Big players like Hazard, Azpi who are consistently brilliant were completely out of it today. It's clear to see why Michy isn't rated by Conte. We've got Tammy banging them in for Swansea, infinitely better than Michy who imo plays better with a second striker. No Kante, no Drinkwater, no Morata, Moses goes off, just a shit day. Happens. Conte should rotate? With what?\n Hasn't got the players or quality to rotate. We move on and we put it right asap. COME ON CHELSEA!
Sophie here! Apologies I meant David Luiz back from suspension not injury! Besides this, I do feel our title hopes are unfortunately over. Our rivals are displaying much better performances. Thoughts??
think we should concentrate on europe, man city are looking on another level this year.....
Michy isn't a premiership player we are playing as a mid table side
Bakayoko was the best player. Michy was the worst. And there were some people who said they prefered that formation over the false 9...
Dont play Cahill for Ffs i said in my line u play C.Ap A.c Rud \nPlay david in mid we were so rubbish its unbelievable honest why did we not keep the ball bats had his chance i would have played Ped from the starts instead of William our team needs to do some much hard core training we playes a team that have a game since the start . The 2nd goal wtf wtf wtf come on he runs past u and score . Please we need to play A.C Rud at the bk . We have serious need of players . Simple
Things that went wrong for me. Willan ,Alonso,michy. No quality in backup. Board didn't back Conte he was calling for it all summer. Probably a cup top 8 or top 4 in champions league and see pep take the league when we could have build on a winning season
Stunning Sophie would love to tie you to that bed and do torturous things to you~ \n\nOut title race is over, Hazard will leave for Madrid because of Willian's wankstain ability.\n\nCahil still starts, Christiensen dropped for no reason. \n\nConte still the stubborn old bag he is. Michi needs to fuck off the Twitter merchant cunt.
Chelshit
I want to be with you in your flat Sophie
Conte of late is making a habit picking the wrong squad....cahill,willian keep strolling into the team when they are clearly out of form.....rudiger,pedro,christinsen keep warming the bench...why??something is going on behind the scenes and conte needs to sort out the issue.
I want to see only two things this season, and you know it...
Yes Sophie we had an arguement few days ago about  this game, as we all worried  about it, as we all can smell problems in our team. Palace is not an average team, they are loaded with some very good players and a very good coach. Zaha  is probably better than most of the Chelsea attackers, and Townshend is a better  winger than any Chelsea's wingers. Conte is very upset, very angry and probably will not sleep for a few nights. he knows he made mistakes, and he is a very good learner. Let's hope  he will do his homework well. Problem is not just a debt. We have now 4!!!! injured players and at least  2-3  completely  out of form. We do have Musonda and we do have Kennedy. maybe Conte should  give these two  a fair chance
Conte needs to just fucking get over it. work with what u got. we still have enough in our squad to beat a shit side like Palace. He needs to get he head in it because he is obviously distracted by something.
Can someone tell this chick that its not about the selection its about the whole team... We needed reinforcements in the summer.. Maybe Cahil shouldn't start but having Willian and Alonso with no replacement... Michy aint a  footballer!! \nAnyone that thinks Michy is by any chance better than Arsenal's Yaya Sanogo then you're deluded!!!\nI don't know why i'm commenting here...fuck this shit hahaha!
I think Tammy Abraham is better than Michy. 4 Epl goals in 5 game is absolutely good talent.  We need to back him because off we need him.
we'll be okay against Roma
Unless Man City do an Arsenal and crumble spectacularly towards end of season, then the title is surely theirs.. This Chelsea squad isn't as good as last years. Sell Matic get Drinkwater?! Transfer window was a joke, Morata is good but he's just one player. We're gonna be fighting for a top four place for sure!\nStill early days, gonna reserve full judgement until around November. Echo other comments would like top four finish with stronger emphasis on Champs league.
Babe shows us some cleavage when Chelsea looses as it will at least help a bit
Oh Conte's a little bit rubbish now.. Just go do one Sophie ffs
You just got beat by the *CRYSTAL PALACE* football club, formed in *1861* then founded in *1905*
Please popularise this comment to conte. Some improvements: buy aubameyang to play him up front with Morata. Also, get Sanchez. His skill works amazing with hazard and pedro and Willian. Imagine that. Sanchez. Aubameyang. We have the money! Cmon conte!!!!!
I tried to troll Chelsea but then realize we have just lost 2-1 to  Watford
Yeah, concentrate on CL That'll help.......
Can u dress like u did in soccer am
Well firstly Rory never has a clue! Didn’t see the match today first one missed in ages , I do agree we won’t win the league. Man City will easily but we should try and at least push for 2nd or 3rd
We need Jamie Vardy pay the 40 or 50m
Got a phone number ?
Sophie is class,speaks a lot of sense. - Manchester Utd fan.
Fabregas was world class that match, it's a shame he was the only one who was half decent though. Even Bakayoko was average because, apart from his goal, his performance was sub par. I still have faith in Conte to bring us back into the title race however. COYB
This season is all about the Champions League. If we finished 4th, that would be fine considering our injuries and lack of depth for now. Roman is all about the CL and unless we take points from Roma, it's going to be ugly. If we don't make the round of 16, the season may be the Mourinho year we didn't think possible. Would back-to-back losses to Roma be the end of Conte? He looked pretty angry in the post-match press conference. Too bad there's not an October window.\n\nMitchy showed what no one is willing to say, and that is he doesn't actually create anything and he's scored his goals almost accidentally. Better as a sub when nothing else is working. I wasn't surprised to see Musonda. I expect to see him play v. Roma, even if Conte says Morata will play.
It’s funny coz I was getting clothes for my holiday and there was a palace supporter severing me and I was like I think palace will win as a joke and he was like nah Chelsea will smash us and here we, I was right even though I didn’t want to be 😂
Drinking water,)\nToday in Liverpool vs man United\n one  player\n he looks like a big STARS on the making.. unbelievable \n.. 11..⏳👌👏
Batshuayi looses the ball so easily, he just can't hold up the ball. On top of that many players underperformed today ( don't want to pin point them ). Yes after this game the title hopes are realistically over, unless we pull off something great.
really dislike michy as a player
4 min in and your analysis is....what is it exactly? You are not consistent and you are too emotional. I will chalk it up to thinking with you heart. \n\nGive credit to Palace and the position they were in. They don’t want to break the record for worst start to a season. Zaha has always given us problems and was running riot on Cahill and Alonso. Townsend and C are quality and the ball and luck was with them. \n\nChelsea was looking forward to midweek obviously. The analysis is quite easy for an educated footballer/supporter. I know you have it in you. \nI recommend writing up some outline notes and maybe watch highlights to refresh you memory. I support  you and your Channel and I love you as a fellow fan...and of course dem tig-o-bittties heheh 😏\n\n#COYB
Hellooo gorgeous, u look healthier than the previous video..I think baka n ces should not play together.. agree w/ u Rudi, Andreas n Azpi as the back three.. and why Willian Conte????
You are going to be very happy I suppose when Conte leaves !! Mitchy suuuuuucksssss
I hope you manage to decipher that I am a real Chelsea Fan amongst the idiots in this comments section, born and raised Chelsea Wharf and Worlds End.\n\n1.What's the big crisis? We lost to the current premiership leaders 1-0, and lets be honest they have been killing all the competition 4-0, 5-0, 7-0 etc.\n\n2. Palace away , who lets not forget are great going forward.\n\n3.A depleted squad with an own goal to boot.\n\n4.INTERNATIONAL duty meant players got injured and fatigued.\n\nCmon you Blues!!
Everyone was just bad, no one did any good.....
Highlights | Live Match Review?
😍😘😗😙😑
Best - Zappacosta Worst - Luiz
Bring back Tammy, play Christensen, Rudiger, Azpi! :(
Hazard was terrible
Exchange batshuayi for Zaha in January
You missed MATIC !
Fuck u guys
Not only were Chelsea the first team to concede to the one of the worst premier league teams ever (not scoring for 7 games straight, losing all) but they also lost to that team.\n\nWow....
who's zara?
except bakayoko nobody was good without kante
Poor game
Title hopes are gone :(
Ur so beautiful baby girl
Hazard is not a world class player..
bring back tammy ffs
We are missing a leader up front, which is Costa.
Even Matic Would've Done A Better Job Than Bakayoko 
fuck off   chelsea
can we play you every week......and didnt we beat you last season......get over it
The Kante rumour was meant to trigger you guys. Kante wouldn't get in to that PSG midfield.
Now you see why Michi should not start.
I fking called it.. if rorey stops doing those 5 reasons that we smash crystal palace and such bullshit and jinx the damn team always against these minnows it would be appreciated. lol
The Atletico was one of my favourite performances ever from us, we actually attacked. City was back to normal, just trying to sit back and defend, and a poor team choice from Conte, then this game was just embarrassing, we had players missing but still.
Let's be honest.  Conte is going to leave. The board are clearly pissing him off and it's effecting the team.  Not contes fault.  Fuck the board
Truth. Conte is rigid. Christensen can play on the LCB.\nTruth. Trust a woman's intuition, Rory. Your positivity is on plastic levels.\n\nBest performance is Cesc. Worst is the whole team.\n\nNo chance of League. Don't dream of Cups (except Sophie's). Conte's record in cup competition is abysmal.
The difference between us and the Manchester clubs are why we are not as good as them, our squad is just as good, if not better, but we mess up against teams like this, and when we do win we sit back and defend when the Manchester clubs go to destroy every team. We need to play like we did against Atletico every game, we need to stop this sitting back game plan now.
I only hope Christensen goes to a better team that will value him, why on earth are we not playing a class young CB who will be the best defender in the world.
We will still win the league
Hazard is inconsistent for us but for Belgium he bangs in goals all day long

Hey Alex see you changed your Animation people, There Awesome
Can you draw the old haircut instead. It doesn't feel natural... it also looks like the hair of the meh emoji  from the emoji movie
Thes is like the movie Mad Money
Is this why theodd1sout says wear your seatbelts?
I like ur old animation better
I like the new style
Just when did you changed the style? Well I like it!☺

I think he did not stole the money its too cool to be true
No. No,you didn't
Jeez! I haven't seen one of your videos for a while because YouTube won't recommend your vids! You are seriously amazing at drawing and animation! Keep up the AMAZING work man!

Hi Alex, my 10 yr old daughter has been talking about a drawing tablet to start animations. Any suggestions for one that would be user friendly and not $$$ oh and she loves your little sister lol
I want to be a director
Hey it's leon
You didn't do it
I dumped a body at a lake in Georgia.

Congrats Alex I subbed 1 month ago and have seen more than half of you're videos and know how long you waited so here we all are supporting and always likening you're funny amazing videos, hopefully you and many more animators inspire me.
No cause your a youtuber and good at it
i think u pulled it off cuz the security in Six Fla- I mean Sixty Flags was so horrible. Great animations btw
Alex u look like my character that I draw for real it’s cool
I think he did it then returned it then he got a reward
My dream job is death

Wait. Did Alex get a haircut?
A Job I Want To Get Is To Be An Producer/Writer. Heck, I Wrote Like 4 Scripts For A Parody.
Like your new character style
I like your new animation

I'm going to be Marine 🇺🇸. But for now I work at a Whataburger 😂😂😂. Everyone starts somewhere
This is more like a gta heist 😂
IS THIS YOU'RE NEW WAY TO DRAW YOU'RE CHARACTER
Sammi Id like to request a video regarding financial management after marriage. How do you manage to budget? Do you combine your income? Or does Jason lets you do the budgeting around the house? You do not have to include figures, more on tips and when there are problems regarding financially how you and Jason handle it @samanthamaria
Such a pretty home.
You look so beautiful!! Loved this style of video. Please do more. (:
Hey Samantha where did u get your cup 'the one with ur tea/ coffee in the video?
Omg I love your style goals I one day dream of having a beautiful home like yours 😍🏡
what happened to Riley...the other dog?
love the space. And OMG your hair look's amazing!
What collar is frank wearing? Love it. Is it ruffwear?
I love everything 😍​
As someone who's been watching you since '08, I am super proud of you and your accomplishments! Also, I know you are human and don't want to attract negativity and drama, but girl. You gotta be unapologetically yourself! Say what you wanna say. You're going attract haters no matter what you do/say. Let em talk (type really), cuz at the end of the day, you're still making your money, you're still a great youtuber (and a veteran youtuber on top of that), and you're still a bomb ass mom! Don't let them control your actions, especially online. Changing what you say and limiting your voice is exactly what the haters want.
Loved, loved, loved this format. Your spaces are beautiful and you can see all the love that's been put into your home.
Love you house and your interior design.. you so lovely
Love this style of video Sammi  xo
this vid is so relaxing and interesting and YOU LOOK STUNNING
Your home is beautiful and yes..very relaxing.
Where's Riley?? Did he pass? :(
I found myself nodding in agreement throughout the whole video lol!! You get me! Love your style in everything but your home is especially beautiful <3
Can you please Vlogg more about your workouts! i need motivation thanks
Can anyone recommend me some good home decor books please? I need this style in my life😻
I love this format Sammi and your space is amazing!! xx
That couch is everything!!
You look so pretty sam! And your house is gorgeous
I would love loads of plants in the living room but they would just die lol. I love this room it looks amazing :) x
I feel like I stepped into a magazine watching this. This is great Sam, I always thought you had an amazing sense of style. Also, I loved the fact that you weren't just walking around with a camera showing us random stuff. I quite like your sit downs
I absolutely love this style of video and love your home xxxx
i like this style of videos. please do the rest of the house like this xx
Sammi I feel like we could be such great friends irl! You have such a sweet personality and I love your style!! 😊😊
Love this format Sam! It's wonderful. It is different than most room tours! This is creative! Love to see more rooms from your home.
I love your space! both rooms that you showed are beautiful! I just moved into my own apartment and will definitely be taking a little bit of inspiration from this video regarding my interior style :)
This is such a beautifully shot video Sammi! I feel like you got the perfect balance between sit- down chatty parts, and shots of the rooms on their own. Can't wait for more! x
Love this ! Keep continuing what you do I love chit chat
i wanna be as cozy as frank
super cozy! but where is riley? :(
The living room looks like a photo you would see in an interior magazine and be like, where is that? I wanna live there it looks so dreamy😊 i also love your filming room and i find this so inspirational
You have amazing interior style Sammi! Loved this ❤️
I always felt asking for a tour is too invasive, so I never ask but I am so excited for this! I noticed in your vlogs, the mantle in the living room and the way you style it with the plants and mirror...simply stunning😍
Hi Sam,Indie and Jason. I've been a viewer of yours since day one and so proud of you! You are amazing and one hell of a badass mum. I appreciate all your honestly and realness.\nIt's very refreshing! \nSo question for you. \nI just moved house as well and have a 4 year old daughter. Im using your decor as inspiration for my new place. Just wondering what wall colour did you use for your office and livingroom. Lots of love from Canada.
Oh my it's absolutely perfect !!
Love the format! And the chilled vibe. Much love!
Such a cuddle couch, I love!
Love the vibe of your place and the video- very chill and cool~ any chance you'll restock your candle in the near future?
I love your home 😍
I love your eclectic style! So sophisticated yet at the same time homey and inviting!
Love the style of both rooms; warm and cosy 😍... u should become an interior designer 😉
I love how well thought out this video was, super different and creative. Always enjoy your videos <3
Your style is so nice! I have a very similar style too
Ugh! Please come and sort out my flat!
I loved the video and the format is just fine.  It felt very personal.  I love your style and I too would love a botanical vibe BUT my cats destroy every plant!!!! : ) xo\n\nNatoya
I love interior design too! The rooms look so calm and clean!!!
omg so inspiring! Love you and your family so much <3 Could you do a video about how to style small spaces? I have a one bedroom apartment and have no room for an actual office but still want to have an office space. Help! <3
Both spaces were to die for! Love your style Sammi, and the way that the video was filmed was great too!💙💜💛
What a refreshing house tour style video! Love the format, can't wait to see more! 😍
Initially when I saw the sofa when it was first delivered (I think in one of the vlogs?), I liked it but thought it didn't go with anything and stood out too much... but now I see it in the fully realised room, it just looks like its been there forever! It goes amazing with all the greens and yellows in the room! Such a stunning living room!
Loved it! I’m decorating my apartment and this helped me so much. x
Stunning home!! Where did you find the chair you're sat on in the office tour??
So... where is Riley??? Didn't see him for so long :(
I feel like i could just walk into your home and go to sleep. It looks so relaxing.
Beautifully edited! Loved the format everything from the music to camera shots. The living room definitely has that botanical vibe to it! xx
I like the dressing of your fireplace a lot, especially with the green around it.
Yasssss Sam!!! Loving this your house is beautiful!! Me and my partner have just moved into our first home so this inspo is much needed!! Xxx
She is under thirty and owns a house in the UK. Fake!
loved it!! you have  a amazing style xx
Where are the stripe cushions on your sofa from Sammy? Xx

Sam you look so dewy and radiant loved this look! Gorgeous home too 💛💛💛 so Pinteresting
Firstly, you look 👏🏾stun👏🏾ing! Loooooooved this format! Very easy to follow and get inspired without it feeling like show-n-tell.
Definitely my style! I loved it
Looks lovely!! You have the best taste!
Where is your top from? I love your style girl!
Love the rooms! We have such similar tastes in design! Which doesn't surprise me because the reason I love your clothing videos is because I typically dress like you too!
You are just amazing
You seem so much happier and content in this house! :) I can tell by the decor! Your living room in this house has a completely different atmosphere than the old one.
I would love to see more of these videos. Thought it was great sam! I'm obsessed with homeware so homeware hauls would be cool too
In love with your living room! Currently decorating mine after a move and this is so inspiration! 💙
Please get your fringe back I miss it Xxx
When are you and Jason planning on buying your first home? \n\nLovely rooms you have their.
Do any small youtubers wanna support each other? Subscribe and like my latest video and I'll do the same :-) xx

Your videos have always been so peaceful, i love u x

Such a great video! Your home is gorgeous and i really like the format as well.
So fun! Your home is beautiful, can't wait for more videos about it :)
Random thought but your fringe kind of looks like a bob and I think you'd look really pretty with a curly bob
Haven't watched for awhile,  beautiful home.  What happened to her Frenchie?
I love love love your home decor design, the sofa is beautiful and all the plants and prints 😍😍😍

Comment cause you asked for it xx
u're the best
I love this look so much!
LOVE THIS!!! been watching since the dawn of time chloe like seriously x
I love your personality! I was wondering if you've thought about doing the haul videos you use to do or even your vlogging! Those were some of my favorites to watch!
I teach high school English. We are doing childhood storybook characters for our department’s Halloween costumes. I’d love to see what character you’d choose. I want it to be scary but not too gory, and I also have to talk and move a lot in it. Any ideas from anyone are greatly appreciated!! Everyone is doing more traditional child stories like Mother Goose, you know? I was thinking Little Red Riding Hood, but I’m not sure. PS: I’m on a budget and school dress codes apply. Thank you!
This is one of my favourite Halloween makeup tutorials I've ever seen! You go girl
I love how scary u look! Creative!
LMAOOO I'm crying at the entire  intro
you are so cool
If I only had a brain.
Chloe you should make a video about you favourite of every product
it actually looks like straw is coming out of chloe aaagh this is so good ♡
I really liked this, It's easy ish and cool af!
This was awesome Chloe! You did great :))
WITHOUT THE MAKEUP YOU LOOK LIKE BLAIR WALDORF FROM GOSSIP GIRL\n\nALSO your makeup skills are amazing, I got all my friends hooked on your videos
This is nuts!!! It's so well done to the point that I felt uneasy watching you shape the wax on your face! Awesome job Chloe!! The straw coming out of your face is really clever! It's really cool that you tried something different versus the million typical tutorials that every makeup guru does for Halloween!
fuckity fuck fuck fuck penis vagina\nIs yt really out here demonetizing your beauty videos ??? what the hell \nlove the look and you as always chloe!
Love it 😍 And I loved the intro. So funny fuck fuck .....
That needs to be on a t-shirt fuckity fuck fuck fuck.. Penis. Vagina..
Fuckity fuck fuck 😂 I love your personality so much
Chloe you are so hilarious!! One of the most genuine make up artists on Youtube!
I have just watched a video where you were belly dancing, insanely talented 😭😭😭
Love you girl. Love this look
Holy shit that was a lot of work for a video and it turned out great.  Where can I send an A for effort award to?  And to do it all to take it all the fuck off!!!
Dang that does make you look really tired! But super fun! I love a mix of like glam eyes and a creepy mouth
lol I love you so much
This was super impressive.. nice work :)
That's freakin amazing Chloe!!! Love it!!!!
You're literally the best there is
Honestly I live for these videos ahhaha I can't
Fuckity fuck fuck fuck is something I say every day working as a nurse 😂 love you chloe x
It looks so real! Excellent job
Also dropping a comment to help the algorithm 😂
you tube can suck it, your swearing makes your videos 1000x better
You’re so fucking awesome 💞💞💞💞 please do a normal look with that eye makeup pleeeeeeease 😍😍😍💞💞
This music is giving me anxiety
when yoi brought up that photo of scotty p no ragrets 😂
I love it! Very creative :)
I don't know why I full body cringed when you started stuffing the straw in! Very nice look, I really love it. Your commentary is also (always) the best.
I love this so much! 💛
Why can't she monetize this video?
Seriously amazing work!!! I love the full look tutorials (prefer them to product reviews to be honest,  but I don't know if I'm reresentative of all the other viewers.) Either way, brilliant video!
I just freaking love you Chloe! You’re absolutely hilarious and one of the few real ones! I think I’m gonna attempt this look!!
Ooh ooh! What do you think of that Stila brow pen? I want to get it but I don't know anyone who's tried it. Every one of those marker things I've bought hasn't really worked very well so the Stila one is my last hope (until I can find the Ardell one in Oz)! If anyone else has experience with them let me know☺️\nOn another note...Does fake blood get your videos demonetised? Gawd YT is getting ridiculous! Tight asses!
Agghhhghhhh something about the way the straw looks like it's poking through your skin wfnkfnsdknfkjsfn ugh it's like nails on a  chalk board.Very good for halloween! Why is getting demonetised any way?
Hey Chloe! Could you do an all Colourpop tutorial? I love that brand and I'd love to see you experiment with their different products! Love your videos by the way!
Your just the best!
Hi Chloe, Off the subject, I just watched your dancing video! You did great. I was wondering if you still danced?...Thanks :)

Wow! Kerbal Space Program has great graphics since the last updatr
I would like to see G forces too in the telemetry section. Would be a nice thing to visualize acceleration.\n\nThumbs up if you want it too! :D
Every time Tom (the host) comes on and says he is a Firmware engineer all i here is, I am a Former Engineer and my first thought is WHY ARE YOU HOSTING THEN!?
Can I suggest that when you make your rocket to mars that you create a component called The Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator?
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Why is it on fire prelaunch? What was it doing?
the real one crashed they switched cams to the other barge with the prop.

Why don't you ever show a launch from the camera of a satellite or satellites? So we could see the whole operation   of launching to landing.
Saw it from my back yard, 168mi south of the Cape. Awesome!
It's really wonderful. When I'm watching when this rocket is returning from space and landing, I feel like I'm watching the next chapter in space exploration. Congratulations to SpaceX. Elon Musk, I do not think you have time to read the comments, but you know how to inspire people.
Thanks for a very interesting and informative video. \n\nI am curious.. After the satellite has been released, what do you do with the part of the rocket, carrying the satellite? Do you fly it back into the earth' atmosphere, so it burns up and falls into the ocean or that happens with it? \n\nIf that is the case, how much is left when it hits the water. Are we talking parts of a few centimeters or more?\n\nKeep up the good work. I love what you are doing to the world.
How I love these starts.. more please! Also: Mars! I hope once the crew is on it's way there are daily videos of how things going - will watch it! Nothing boring in pushing the boundaries of mankind :)
elon is actually a Martian just trying to get back home. :(
You are the best
SpaceX makes NASA look like the overpaid old timers afraid of change they are.
ArianeSpace and ULA are toast! \nSpaceX ate their lunch with Falcon 9. It's a very successful launch technology and SpaceX is already leaving it behind. \nNow Elon will show up the SLS with BFR! \nI cannot wait to see those things coming out of the sky and landing on a launch pad.
Are there people inside?
2017 and Space companies are still using potatoes to record :/
Anyone wanna explain the space-blizzard at 41:00?
So is it time to start buying spaceX stock?
WoW was this fastest re-entry  ? Fins glowing white and plasma show up..... WoW
what if it flies over north korea and they get the wrong idea
what the hell is that camera doing ? seriously? you send rocket to space and you cant tilt the camera steadily?
Point of order!!!! You are not launching from Cape Canaveral. KSC is technically on Merritt Island. ;-)
İ Choice The Blue Pill   Morpheus  Musk !!
Subtitles seem to be about 11 minutes behind the audio(!)
SpaceX  you need a concert like TOMITA Live at Linz in Austria 2 as you send off  :)
Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\n\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\n\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.
Its weird that Tesla cars actually accelerate faster, if you compare them side by side. The rocket just keeps going. I imagine the time when we will launch stuff to space from huge magnetic cannons, made out of hyperloops that then ignite while already hundreds of meters above ground and going just a little under speed of sound already. Could save alot of liftoff fuel payload.
This is not Russia vs America... This humanity vs extinction  ... We are all brothers and sisters... Indian guy here going I could be a part of space x some day... :D
The Russians are known for their secrecy.
Reusing rockets: what's the big deal - I do it on Kerbal all time, and with a real short turn around time: you say this is not the same thing???? ;) Congrats Elon - and people say: What can one person do? Well how about changing the whole world and much for the better?
Excellent choice of music.
I recently flew on a 4 engine 747... can't imagine 20 engine's and how I would possibly survive, LOL!!!
I can understand camera getting screwed on re-entry, but surely the barge camera can have better than potato quality/connection. Still, awesome work. Look forward to much more and oneday seeing 31 raptor engines firing in all their glory.
Its so complicated to do, yet this video makes it look so easy.  Musk is a force of progress.
Great coverage and launch.  Didn't realize how much energy goes to climb rate.  Guess you guys are working on that experimental video feed.  Hope to see that feed progress as you have with other innovations.  Kudos on great successful deployment.  2 lauches in a week.  North Korea dictator must be just wetting his pants with green envy pee.
Well done everyone, ZERO coverage by BBC News on their website. You know you are doing an amazing job when its becoming so common to achieve this amazing feat of engineering that it doesn't even make the news! Keep up the amazing work!
Elon Musk is the greatest foreigner to come to America since the time of Nikola Tesla. Bravo Mr. Musk.\nWish you lots of luck on your endeavors.\nIf you take advantage of everything America has to offer there's nothing you can't accomplish- Geraldine Ferraro
if they develop this rocket any further they might just go to the moon some day!
Why is the drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You?
i cannot wait for the BFR
It's a bit strange that it cut out on the landing.
@23:40 In space, they play techno.
Watched it live couldn't comment at time shame visuals were lost of rocket landing but seen most of its journey well done
All bow down to Elon Musk our savior. What I would give to work with him....He will save the world.
Best\nName \nFor\nA\nDroneship
I bore my other half to tears alot of the time when I talk about Elon Musk and the whole Space X operation... Not to mention those phenomenally stunning Tesla vehicles. He is a true visionary willing to risk his own wealth for mankind to step foot and even reside on Mars... Obviously it would mean a stupendous amount of wealth WHEN it succeeds. Would love to sit and have a coffee and chat with Elon. I admire his focus and drive on getting us to the red planet. I'm 99.999% sure Space X will get the first structure on Mars ahead of NASA.
I just love SpaceX! What an extraordinary gang! They just do it :D.\nWould have been nice to see some telemetry data from the 2nd stage during its long flight.\nBut a great presentation anyway. I love watching these launches!
Is it just me or did they attach new cameras, way better quality this time around
others can gripe but SpaceX is showing the way forward efficient to the point of 2 launches in 3 days 2 returns in 3 days multiple satellites launched without drama, they are a trucking company doing what they do best, and by developing their own equipment they control quality, remember the plan for BFR is the equivalent of launching a decent sized 4000 ton ship into orbit and reusing it as well multiple times, we really are at a crossroads
I love the drone ship names...\nOf Course I Still Love You\nJust Read the Instructions
Amating work guys!!!!
Пойду лучше на петуха из дерьма посмотрю!!!

20:54
7:02 hellooooooooooooooooooo there !  *.*
Super décollage, bravo à vous.
***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!! Shouldn't have a continuos movement as there is no friction!?  Thanks to all for answer
The most amazing transportation vehicle and its formed like a penis
Excuse me, I've got a question (and maybe a stupid one, because I don't know what could be the answer). Instead of focusing and spending so much money on reaching Mars, wouldn't be better to focus on asteroid mining technology? I think that once that we will be capabel to gain materials in the space, we will be able to build our rockets directly in space, so that the ammount of fuel needed will be much less becouse we will have no more to escape our gravity.\nHope that someone could clarify me that point.
@spacex is that the first stage landing at 22:12 on the left side one the screen?
What is on the horizon at 22:12? It looks like a nuke detonation.
I wish they would display m/s instead of km/h
every day seems they send something up...the elite moving out?
SpaceX should send a new rocket to space everyday
Why did they land on the barge instead of land?  I thought land was preferable now that it has been figured out
At SapceX is there career opportunity for non US citizens
@43:40 can somebody please explain why the speed of second stage is decreasing? Shouldn't it remain constant?
What's the nuclear bomb looking thing in the background at 22:12
Lots of space junk visible on the left camera as the 1st stage is prepping for return to earth. That's going to be a problem pretty soon I would say.
weird looking rocket. lot of fancy paintings but still less than half as good as Russian rockets which take off so beautifully, very safe and reliable, unlike this american junk. here's how a rocket should take off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyzsRjru86s

You may consider this comment as being a bit strong so please forgive me and look carefully at the video material I am presenting (see links). Thanks, Art  Email Contact: mailme@cambigue.com
Where does the second stage end up going? Does it just drift endlessly now?
Ok...what happened at 14:55?
What is that at 22:13 on the edge of the Earth?   Is that the sun? Or stage 1?  Sorry if that's a silly question.
It looks like Elon Musk is playing Kerbal Space Program !
I wish they could also reland the second stage in another part of the world
Flat ?
elon ! you are gettıng lame  hahahha
CGI is getting so realistic
20:59 Damn is this plasma ?? Good thing the first stage survived reentry
22:10 WOW! you can see the rocket land in the background!
22:14 what is that on the left side ? It looks like a nuclear bomb test or something like that
HOW LISA use TARTE shape tape: little touches here and there PEOPLE, HERE & THERE, not all over the face ☻
Hi Lisa, I really enjoyed this with Claudia, I’m a massive fan. I also made a video the other day on Claudia too. It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.
just look at this beautiful creature =) no botox and fillers... just plain gorgeous in and out ..   the most beautiful woman in the world!
Anyone know where Lisa’s rings are from?
Claudia looks so sweet such a kind person
Yes, what a treat! My fave model of all time with the best makeup artist ever!
She is the most beautyful creature in the world. I adore claudia🌹❤️. Thankeyou, Lisa
It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)
I saw one of the OG Supermodels, I clicked
OMG how do you get one of the biggest supermodels of all time in your video?
Black eyelashes and blond hair... isn't it weird?
Thank you for sharing the video, Lisa! I love how Claudia is so natural & classy and looking after herself after 30 years in fashion. She is comfortable & confident in herself that she doesn't mind showing us her lines, which we all have!!! Great to see her amazing self after being her fan for 25 years!!! Love Claudia!!!! XOXO
Funny intro! Really loved the energy between you two Lisa. I did notice the new ring additons. They are so beautiful. Always wondering where you find those dashing rings.
I gave away a fragrance by Agent Provocateur to a free box.  ehehehehehehe
What a goddess she is
She is such a beauty, and you make her look even more beautiful!
Wow, she seems so sweet , nice and authentic!
Once the Top Supermodel in the World, some 25 years ago.
Omg one of my favorite supermodel. She's the perfect Bardot.💕
this is a beautiful makeup tutorial and really fast haha I love all of the colours and you are my favourite YouTuber.
I slept with my makeup on last night. Take me out back and shoot me. :D
My younger brother was IN LOVE with Claudia Schiffer back in the day-she is still stunning and I just love her imperfectly beautiful teeth!,
Lisa Eldrigdge's videos are the only makeup tutorials I need and want to see. Love your work!
If only I could sleep in my makeup and look like Claudia when I wake up!
Lisa!!!! thanks SO much for featuring the original supermodels like Yasmin Le Bon and Claudia! Just what I needed after a hard week :D
oh Claudia is lovely isn't she - so articulate, warm and gorgeous  xxxxx
Beauty really comes from within...
Whoa Lisa is taking to the next level . Love Claudia . She's perfect !
Omg Claudia Schiffer is my favorite model ever since I was a little girl.
OMG her skin is flawless i can't believe this.. another lovely collab!
I love how you are bringing back the legendary 90s supermodels. First it was Yasmin and now it's Claudia. Gosh.. I can't wait to see who you'll invite next!
You should re do the Vogue Cover again. Maybe in an updated version! Could be so cool :D
I LOVE HER RINGS
I'm creeped out look at our last names
I'm pleasantly surprised at how natural Claudia looks! She clearly hasn't had work done but looks amazing! A great example to women.
Hi Lisa love love love your tutorials 😗😗😗😗😗😗. Thank you for making makeup so easy and bringing such an icon on your chanel.
OMG I loved that funny voice at the start LOL
Beautiful Claudia! Natural beauty. She is my fav model . 😘
I love this video Lisa!! Claudia is timeless!!
Could you please make a tutorial of the Gal Gadot Wonder Woman makeup?
She looks so similar to Chelsea handler lol
Lisa doing the Queen's make up probably: Look at me, darling.
Looved the video! The makeup was perfect for Claudia. Loved the lip liner and lipstick!
A Real Beauty !! AT LAST !!! So there are some women in the business that they are not botoxed up their heads! Impessive!!!
I Loke your ring from where you got it
I absolutely loved this video. MY QUEEEEENS.
The original supermodels have not aged, they are goddesses x
She looks sooooooo gorgeous like she was born to do this makeup. wow
youtubers should take tutorials from Lisa. Look how little makeup she needs compared to all the beautygurus !
she looks natural, no botox, no porcelain on teeth.
She’s prettier now than she was 20 years ago!
When does the book release?
Love you both,  but this time what stole my heart was the lipstick. OMG. The whole look, as obvious, it’s stunning.
Watching this video has made my day. Thank you Lisa!!
We did notice your new rings Lisa! The bangles Claudia’s wearing looks pretty too - anyone knows where from?
Shit yeah Lisa's back again!
thank you, Lisa. I enjoyed this video a lot. and I think Claudia's so much more beautiful now that she's a bit older! not that there was anything wrong with her looks ever but I love how her face is so pretty and fascinating with a few fine lines here and there. AND she seems super lovely, too!
I love the way they both speak.
This might sound odd but I LOVE how white & bright the whites of Claudia’s eyes are!! 👀 They contrast incredibly against the smokey eye make up. I also love how when she looks at you while you’re talking Lisa it’s like she’s staring into your soul. Eyes & eye contact are such an important part of body language & conveys confidence & that conveys self worth & beauty to me. 🙌🏻🙌🏻 Beautiful make up as always Lisa. X x
Can you do an Eva Green look?
What's Claudia's nail color- so beautiful!
Well that’s what I call an Iconic Tutorial ! Lisa you are awesome 😘
Omg everyone calls me cloudy as well. I'm dying I have the same nick name as Claudia Schiffer 😱😂😍
I am loving this! watching for the third time 😵😍
No the girl doesn't look like claudia... she IS CLAUDIA SCHIFFER ! !! Thanks Lisa, I LOVE IT!
Out of this world 💙
To be honest, I prefer straight view rather than side view.
How iconic is that
Claudia seems like such a nice person!
What skincare range did she say she uses?? Didn't catch it
I wish I could give this a 100 thumbs up 👍👍👍👍 I loved watching it. Claudia ist just gorgeous.
Wow, this was so refreshing and amazing! Claudia and Lisa together are such a great team :)
Can we just PAUSE FOR THE CAUSE!!!! Claudia effin Schiffer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really appreciated seeing Claudia as she is, a beautiful 47-year-old woman without filters. Absolutely lovely, and spectacular makeup, again, by Lisa. Thank you - perfection!
Her skin looks absolutely amazing! Lovely video and makeup look!
I love her teeth! They bring more character to her face with the very slight imperfection, and I think it looks so much better than the uniformed smile of every other celebrity. That smokey eye looks so gorgeous and effortless on her, yet another stunning work by Lisa!
Claudia looks unbelievable
<3
Wow, incredible!!!
Intro...too adorable!!
Monica Bellucci please!!!!!
Wowzers!
😱😱😱😱😱

Stunning 😍❤️
She is gorgeous ❤️✅
stunning, just incredible!
Flawless model!\nFlawless makeup!\nFlawless makeup artist!\nFLAWLESS! \nx x x
So pretty Claudia. natural, fresh, super.
Lisa, I love your channel, but your content feels skewed. I’d love to see more women of color (and darker skinned models) featured. Not to do so seems tone deaf to all that’s going on in the world. Thanks.
I wish Lisa's comments session wasn't dominated by criticisms of other YouTubers. You can compliment Lisa without bringing others down. If you don't like them, why watch? (Fun video btw).
Hi Lisa, where do you get your rings? I have been obsessed with them since I started watching your videos! x

i nearly cried watching this and am mildly depressed. never give up and stay strong Dan there is still hope <3
i thought d stood for \ndan's\ndank
I've relapsed a bit back into depression recently....this helped friend. Thank you. I have gotten out of it a bit before, and this is a good reminder
We're so proud of you Dan - Continue to stay strong as you have been and are right now. You are so courageous for sharing your story, especially since depressions not an easy subject to talk about. You inspire me so much.
I've had depression since I was 6 because my thyroid crashed and threw off my hormonal balance. I'm now 25. I've found quite a few good coping mechanisms but it's still a pain in the ass. It runs in the family as well but I haven't had a bad episode in a while. Just keep doing your best, Dan. You seem to be handling the idea of it well though. You know the episodes will happen and you'll get the 'numb' feeling but you seem very conscious of the fact that it'll pass and you'll be able to move forward again eventually, which I've always found important. If you can't see a future you, you feel lost but if you can see past the feeling (or lack there of) you know it's just a matter of Yeah, this sucks but maybe I'll be fine by tomorrow. Being able to continue planning your future, knowing you'll still have this happen now and then, in my mind, shows a strong person. I know you didn't make this video for pity and I totally get that but just know that we're here to cheer you up with stupid memes, sarcasm, and all the irony you need.
To me he always looks depressed with all of his existential crises and stuff
i tried to comprehend and understand but some of the clips just made me laugh (just the example skits)
Hey. I also have depression and this video made me cry, thank you for making it! Because I’m a generally happy person, people often don’t believe me because it is all in my head. You understand what depression feels like completely and I feel as if people who don’t have depression can’t even begin to describe it. I wouldn’t wish mental illness on anyone and I’ll make sure to *try* to do some kinda excercise 😒 (other than P.E which will literally be the death of me). I also have issues with sleep because of depression and knowing that others understand is helpful. Thank you!!!
Did he just say, A Night Howell
Yup ya daddy ( I'm sorry I died bout that)
I’m so fucking proud of you. I’ve been watching your videos for years, since the start, and I’m so unbelievable proud of you. I’ve been hella depressed for pretty much my entire life and I always had a hunch you had depression. Maybe it was the constant self deprecating jokes or the comments of wanting death 🤔 but in all seriousness it’s hard to talk about mental illness even if it is much more accepted than it was ten years ago. For you to announce this to the world is brave and everyone here is proud of you.
Last year i fell into a depressed state that lasted about a year. I'm not sure if I can call it depression because it only lasted a year but I often felt like there was this gaping hole in my chest that despite being empty, was so heavy and I felt like I could not do anything. It wasn't the same as being sad but when I had that feeling I knew that I was pretty much a gone cause for the rest of the day. I cried literally everyday, to the point that I actually started counting the number of times I cried, as like some sort of weird coping mechanism. Most people around me didn't realise how depressed I was. In fact, one of my friends said she was jealous of how happy I was all the time. But with the support of my closest friends and family and God, I started getting better till one day, I looked at what I called my cry count, the note where I recorded all the times I cried, and said no more and deleted it. I have gotten better since. Now I occasionally relapse but its not so bad. It helps to have people to support you through your difficulties so don't keep it all to yourself!\n.\n.\nP.S. Dan, I absolutely love your curly hair
i have depression and a.s.d
ive been waited 3 days to watch this because i had to mentally prepare myself
It's okay Dan. Please be happy. 😓. Think of freinds. Like Mark, Pewds, Jack, Phil and others
I’ve been on antidepressants for half of my life now. I’ve tired so many but I’m happy with the ones I have now, I’m on the highest dose but I just think that’s just like if someone was diabetic they would give them the insulin they need. I’m not sure if I will every not take my meds but I’m okay with that now. Unfortunately depression for me isn’t about when it will go but how I can live with depression.
My depression is always there, but it also comes in these huge waves where for maybe an hour to two I'm completely and utterly suicidal, I thinking of self harming, I'm ready to die in other words. And the help I'm getting, not helping. At all. my friends are absolutely amazing and they try to help, but nothing helps. It kinda just...sucks.
ohh yes i have bipolar disorder i can really relate 💖💖
one thing i’ve noticed is that after this video a lot of people i follow on social media who have some sort of mental struggles found the courage to go and ask for help. many of them have decided to make an appointment with the therapist and some of them even got the needed medication prescribed. there are also people who HAD gone through the therapy in the past but stopped it for some reason and now are restarting again. all because of one important video by one amazing person. and it makes me so happy and proud. thank you dan for making such a great influence <3
Hi Dan. I am the mother of one of your biggest fans... I'm also a fan I guess! Just wanted to thank you for loading this video. Firstly, brave of you. Second, am sure it will be a great help to many young people. Third, you're the perfect person to talk about this issue to your fan base. You describe your experience in a very matter of fact way, making it accessible for everyone. You have a fantastic way with words, and wit, and it will give a lot of people confidence to speak out, get help, and feel less alone. So thank you.
dan, you beautiful beautiful boy. thank you so much for this. you are so loved and we are all so freaking proud of you♡♡♡♡♡
seeing this made me realise I might have been depressed for a bit, not as much, but definitely to some level
How did the people around you help (or try to help) you with what you were going through? I’ve had three friends in my life with extreme cases of depression and I had no idea what to even say... any time I tried to talk to them and “help” them, it all sounded like bs... they got help thank god... but still. I don’t want to feel useless when my friends are in a tough situation.
This is a beautiful video love❤️❤️
I'm so glad that he made this video, didn't know how much I needed it!
Thank you Dan. Thank you. Could you make a video on your experiences with therapy? It could probably help people who are too scared to try it to realize it's not as scary as they think.
I've told a friend I had anxiety and she brushed it off, I guess ordinary people just don't understand, but people love you, you can't force them to understand, save yourself, because mental illness is sometimes so hidden and complicated, believe in yourself, because if you don't, who will?
Thanks for being so brave and opening up to all of us. ❤
Thank you for sharing this with us Dan, it's very brave of you. I've suffered from depression in the past so I understand how hard it can be. I'd also like to thank you for helping me through my tough days. When I was at my worst and didn't want to leave my room I'd watch you and Phil and you both would make me feel a little better. I wouldn't be where I am today without you so thank you Daniel. :)
Honestly I am so scared of finding a therapist, like actually seeing one? Completely fine. Going through having to actually find one that works for me, and isn't terrible? Panic attack. This is not fun, and I don't even really get my fear to be perfectly honest
I feel like you have a really healthy perspective on depression. It's refreshing to hear someone talk about it like this. Thank you for making this video. It probably took a lot of courage to be this open about something that can be so hard, but I think it will hopefully help a lot of people. :)
Dan...ik this is a big jump of a topic but I really wanted to here you talk about self harm.....it’s a little out there but I think hearing things about it from you would be great, this is an extremely risky topic but it’s just a suggestion
I just started crying during the video. You described it so so well but I don't know what to do with myself, so I just smile and leak tears until I fall asleep
Being told that 'Everything will get better' may be a very repetitive sentence, you've mostly likely have heard it your entire life even though your life hasn't gotten better. But it is true, even though it may take years. Have patience, and everything *will* get better eventually.
I am in a depressive episode now and this video inspired me to push myself to at least do a part of my night routine that I haven’t been able to do in over a week so thank you. I hope one day to be able to spread a message this positive and necessary but I’m not there yet.
i sobbed the whole time, thank you for talking about something so important.
I never thought that I was depressed. I thought, that oh i'm just sad But watching this made me realize that at a point I was really depressed and that I cant just ignore the fact that I felt this way and could possibly feel this way again.
ILY DANNY DAN THIS WAS SO FUNNY BUT SO SERIOUS AT THE SAME good work sweetie xxxxxxx
okay so i love the video, BUT I LOOOVEEE THAT BOARD YOU HAVE
Hey Dan, I just wanted to say thank you for making this video. I've gone through a lot of the same experiences as you, (such as feeling numb to everything around me) and this actually made me feel a crap ton better about myself. Somehow you made me laugh in a video about depression (which I didn't even think was possible) but anyway thank you for making my smile. :D
Did you just diagnose me with depression?
I've had depression from bullying and anxiety as well but one strange form my anxiety has taken is car/driving anxiety. I hate getting in the car with drivers I haven't driven with before because I hate fast moving cars which causes me to have panic attacks, and sometimes I have panic attacks driving a car myself even though logically I know I'm ok, I can't help it at times. Does anyone else feel this way?
Am I the only one who is made fun of in my current grade because I had to stay back two years because of mono? Yep. That's happening.
Hey, don't mean to be an attention seeker, but honestly you inspired me to seek help and I will actually be starting therapy sometime soon. You make feel so, so much better and I am happy you are in a good place right now. I hope I can follow you there.
*This is very off topic, but WE NEED ANOTHER INTERNET SUPPORT GROUP, IT'S BEEN TO FUCKING LONG, DANIEL.*
It’s horrible that people go through this...I’m glad u got the courage to talk to us about this
When I was a preteen I didn’t know what depression was. I went to the doctors for eczema and he told me I was depressed and scratching is how I coped and now my skin is all messed up and I hid it for the last 5 years from my friends or anyone who didn’t know previously. Now I realise all the things that made me depressed didn’t actually come into mind or “effect” me emotionally. I did just scratch and still do it as relief. Even though I have millions of scars all over my body, things can be so much worse. Stand strong. 💜💛
I'm not sure if I should share my story to tell you that I've been in the same hole as well so we may share in this miserable camaraderie or not. Depression, anxiety, OCD, eating disorders or any other type of metal disease are so difficult to talk about today and telling your story just makes others think you are looking for attention. I wish we lived in a world where no one would judge another based on who they were, but unfortunately we don't. Dan, you sending your message of struggle and recovering out to the whole world gives me hope- not that the world will become a better place, but one that is more receptive to the cries and victories of those who feel the same way. You make my life better even from thousands of miles away and make the lives of other fans so much better and I would just like to thank you for taking the effort to make the world a more friendly and open place to those who suffer from an illness no one else can see.
Yeah, I suffer from it too Dan. I'm sorry you go through this. I hate depression and myself for that matter. Whenever I watch your videos I don't feel so bad anymore. I wish I could help you. And give you a hug. And run you a bubble bath. I was constantly bullied as a child and let's be honest, I'm still bullied. I'm happy I have you. Thank you Dan. Thank you for being there when no one else was.
I'm so proud of you.
I WILL RUN YOU THE SICKEST BUBBLE BATH AND HAVE YOU IN BED BY 6
Good on you for being so brave in talking about this. Depression is a bitch, but you are stronger than it. ❤️
I actually think this video was put together really well. It wasn't heavy like most other videos talking on mental illness, and it was good having classic Dan humour in there as well, but not too much that it made the topic seem not serious. It was very open, free-flowing, and describes depression pretty well. Thanks for breaking the stigma that mental illness are private Dan, sorry you had to go through it
Siri, how do you hug a stranger 4000 miles away?
Honestly, this is a great fucking video. I was feeling pretty dead today and this weirdly made me feel better. Thanks, Dan.
I know how hard it is to be open about something like this especially when there are so many people who will see this. I am so happy that you talked about this and I know if I had seen this in the beginning part of my depression it would have helped me to have motivation to get better and to get help seeing this from someone I looked up to and I know this will help so many people and I'm so happy this exists.
We all love you, Dan.
Thank you for this dan\nI’ve been depressed ever since I’ve been bullied for three years and I carried on being depressed after and you have helped me for years so thank you. You have given me so much advice and even though I’m still going through it you make me feel better.
this video makes me happy. I make a point to talk to all my friends about mental illness because it's a very real thing that affects nearly everyone. And it makes us so much closer and understand each other and our actions better. Plus then I know that I always have someone to talk to when I'm feeling down and trapped by my mental illness. This video is awesome so thank you for being real and talking about your depression 😁 it's really encouraging me to get my life together.
Dan Howell is the only thing that puts a genuine smile on my face every day. Thank you Dan. Thank you for not only helping me, but helping millions of others even though you were going through your own crap. Thank you.
Even though it's the first time I've seen Dan talk about something so seriously, I'm honestly so happy that he did. I can't even express how important it is for him to finally open up to us about his mental health and it really means a lot to me because I relate to his words so much. Thank you for sharing your story with us and thank you for helping me get through my years of depression, Dan ❤️
When you write practically a book in the comments but get scared of people judging you >->
I feel like that some times but I thought it was just sometimes you don't want to be bothered by anyone or whatever I thought but I have a different mental health problem so one might feed the other I'm being too open on a comment whatever BTW I watched all Dan Phil and Dan and Phil games vids in one month during school
I love you so much dan. Thank you for this.
It's scary how much I can relate to this
When I'm not motivated, I mean.
Oh dan. Thank you so much. I have depression(and a few other things), and watching this video made me feel so good inside. I’m so happy that you talked about this. I’m going to share this with my boyfriend, who’s been having a really hard time lately, because it was so helpful to me. Dan, we all love you and we’re here for you. You’ve been there for me through my periods of severe depression. Thank you Dan
I describe it like, A constant emotional state of drowning and just when you think you're about to die, you get, if you're lucky, one big gulp of fresh air, and then back down under you go.  It's weird how I'm no longer chronically depressed as I was as a teenager but now have bipolar and it's honestly no better.  Now I'd rather be underneath something most of the time to resist the manic urges of jumping off of high places... figuratively speaking.  Hopes up!
I needed this. Thank you.
Thank you for this!
Dan, I know its really tough to go through this sort of thing and push through it. But you're doing a great job. Like I said, I know its hard... But hang in there. We all understand. ❤❤❤
i find it amazing how one person can have such an impact on so many others. thank you dan for everything, especially for sharing this.
Hey Dan(iel,) I’m super happy to hear you’re doing better. I’ve struggled with depression for 7ish years and I’m finally feeling better too. I’m happy you’re trying to be open about all this, I try to as well and it’s good to know someone else is  in the same place ☺️ much love
Thank you so much for making this video Dan. For a long while you've been one of the you tubers that I watch when I need to feel better and laugh and forget about the world for a while. The way you described your depression really hit home with me. Seeing someone like you, who I look up to, having the courage to talk about your depression really does mean so much! It makes me feel more like maybe I can talk about my depression. You inspire me! Thank you for the videos and talks and live-streams you've done about mental health awareness. Thank you thank you thank you! This means so much!
I'm sorry, I'm really trying to be serious (probs just hiding behind a wall of rly bad refrences to shield myself from my own depression and anxiety lol) but.. pizzA AND MEMES OML I'M D Y I N G
I cried when watching this. I have this too. The exact same thing.
Ok so I never comment on things, but this video really made me laugh and also feel a lot better so here goes. I was having an awful day, something I usually call a dark day. I slept for 4 or so hours this afternoon to avoid my thoughts and also because anxiety and depression are so mentally draining sometimes that I can’t not sleep. I’m in a similar place to what dan described right now, where it only comes back a few times a month usually. But when it does it comes back intensely and suddenly. Those days I don’t usually get out of bed, and often don’t eat or take care of myself. Finishing the day with this made me feel just a little better. Thanks dan.
It makes me so sad to see that while you’ve made me happy, you’ve been feeling low. Thank you for sharing this, I can’t put into words how proud I am of you. Keep being you, I love you Dan.
I have bad depression. I can’t function sometimes. Things just feel pointless but I am also suicidal. Have been since 5th grade. I got a B and almost drowned myself in the school toilet. It was bad and I had nothing. \n\nThings just got worse and I thought it was normal and just life was nothing. It got worse and in eighth grade it got so bad I tried to kill myself on 3 different occasions for different reasons. My parents found out after they got into my phone and I got sent to the hospital. I couldn’t be trusted to stay alive and I just lied my way out to my family. Right now I’m 9th grade I don’t go to a therapist and I take the wrong dose of meds but fixing it would mean I would have to admit I have a problem to my family. I started cutting but I am currently 2 weeks clean and I think I may get better but I will be surprised if I make it to 16 much less 18 and right now I have nothing. You have helped me a lot but thing couldn’t get worse to begin with. I know how to tie a noose with my eyes closed and my arms are a mess. My anxiety and depression is bad but it was worse so it’s ok. Not ok but better. I am not about to kill myself so that’s a good sign. Thank you.
I had clinical depression for like five or six years of my life, and I only started feeling good enough to get off of medication last year. You’re right, you do have to force yourself to live a healthy life to start getting better. You have to learn to actually put yourself before others no matter how hard that is. I’m so proud that I’m a happier person now, even if I do still get depressed and anxious from time to time. But anyways, thank you for speaking out about this, it’s really important that somebody does.
yup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nya daddeh
just, thank you
Major depression with recurring psychosis\nGAD\npanic disorder\nPTSD\nOCD\nBorderline personality disorder\nYay!!

Thank you
Yup ya daddy my favorite line
Thank you.
Thank you ❤
thank you thank you thank you
Woot, citalopram pals!
awww... \n\ndanny ily you r so perfect
I'm sorry Dan
Extend your spine, Dan.
Thank you 💜
I have really bad social anxiety, to the point where I break down into tears if I have to do one small thing involving other people. I really appreciate that you made this video and opened up about this, Dan, because I feel like my own anxiety is really holding me back from a lot of things. Thank you for showing other people that it's okay to talk about this stuff, because someone will always support you. I'm sure I'm not the only one that's benefited from this, and I'm glad that you're getting so many thanks, as well as support from fans. So let me just say once again, thank you for this, you have helped me a lot, and I'm glad you made this.
This is the best birthday present I could have asked for. I'm crying
I know that this video is supposed to be serious and important (which totally is, btw), but I couldn't contain myself when Dan said\nYup, YA DADDY!!!
I had a minor anxiety attack because of a traumatic experience. You know what happened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy mom forced me to sleep by myself like out of the blue. I'm not even kidding. That night petrified me. I'm still scared of my bedroom to this day. :/
You mean... you weren’t wearing makeup at the start of the video????? Wow goalsssss
Omg I thought you were wearing makeup until you started applying your makeup. Your skin is perfection!!!
Thanks Anz x

Overpriced overhyped and hardly much coverage in any of the Base products . Watched a good few reviews of glossier and definitely nothing special
It took me like 10 minutes, till you applied the perfecting tint, to realize you had no makeup on... looking gorgeous Anna xxx
Do not buy the vitamin C serum by Glossier. Vitamin C in a clear bottle is a no-no. Also, the serum is already tinted yellow. Not a good sign. For the niacinamide + zinc, opt for the The Ordinary one for a much better price. Same for the hyaluronic acid serum. Even better than The Ordinary, I would suggest the Hadalabo Super Hyaluronic Acid Lotion.

Getting my order delivered tomorrow😄
ArzuJann
Your hair looks so luscious!!!!
So helpful!!!! Thank you xx
I made my first glossier order 3 days ago now, and it still hasn't been dispatched :(
Love this, I went to the Glossier showroom when I was in NY a couple of weeks back, and pretty much bought everything you rate as good!\n\nWould love Glossier haircare next!!
This was v.helpful Anna! And your makeup looks super pretty xx
Best Glossier review I've watched! Well done 👍🏻
HOLA muñecas a que hora salen por el pan bizcochitos
Loved seeing you work through all of these Anna! So happy for my friends in England who can finally grab it. As for Australia... we're used to being patient haha. I have a whole lot of individual detailed Glossier product reviews over on my channel for any UK girls who want to see swatches before they buy! x
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! \nI've been seeing sooo much hype around Glossier's products, and just had no idea where to begin or any idea of how to figure out if their products were worth picking up! This video is EXACTLY what I needed. So helpful Anna, you're such a babe! x
I've already done an order for the skin tint, the cherry balm dot com, the haloscope and the boy brow in black but you're making me want to buy more!!!!!!! My bank account is gonna be so mad at me.
I have a 10% discount for your first order 😁 - http://bff.glossier.com/gHtxF
Totally not related to the video, but I love your hair! It looks so shiny and smooth. What have you been using?
Thanks Anna. I was going to buy the Invisible Shield Factor 35 as I have the same type of skin as you but will save my cash and get the stretch concealer. x
The makeup looks lovely on you Anna!! I really hope they ship to Australia soon!!!!!
This was so useful! Now I know what to get 😉 and yay trending!!xxx
wow your product arrived the next day, meanwhile i just got an email from them saying my order's gonna take longer than expected (more than 5 business days) so unfair :(
i wonder if they ship out of UK, do they ship in other parts of Europe too, when ordering from the UK site?
Thanks for doing this review, Anna, I love your reviews!
Best set of reviews on Glossier that I’ve seen so far. You’re awesome. Now I know what I’m going to get and what colors. Xo 😘
Amazing review and really helpful! My bank balance is going to take a hit tonight! X
Your skin is so flawless! When the video started I thought you were wearing make up!
I really enjoy the Milky Jelly Cleanser but the Super Bounce did nothing for me. I have seriously dry, dehydrated skin and I felt very tight after using it.
That's a great lip color on you. I tried it and it didn't work. I thought the Generation G lip colors were toooooo drying and matte on me. The Stretch Concealer is my GO TO concealer...even with 56 yr. old undereye skin. It looks like skin and doesn't crease or settle!  Thanks for the review.
Bloody loved this, I know what's going on my Christmas list now!! Ps Anna you look gorgeous!! 😍
This was a great review 👏
I can't wear sunscreen directly on my skin. So I have to layer it on top of my moisturizer.
Thank you for this!! Super helpful. Feel like I can justify a couple new purchases now :)
Love the milky jelly cleanser.  The wowder made me break out.  I kept trying it because I really like the finish.  I have oily skin, acne prone skin and I just couldn't make it work.  The cloud paints were great, but after an hour they would disappear off my face.  I really wish they had more staying power.  Probably better for drier skin.
The Glossier Cloud Paints are my fave! I add a small dab of Puff to Dusk and it creates the most natural rosy nude. I find Dusk on its own to be too brown, and Puff to be too bright pink but together - perfection :)
I had a bit of a glossier shopping spree the Monday when uk shipping became available, after watching this I'm really happy about my choices and am looking forward to receiving them. I got the haloscope in quartz, the balm dotcom trio (rose, birthday and cherry) and the phase 2 set (light, brown and zip). Zip looks like it could be the exact wore look red I've been trying to find for months, I can't wait to try it all!!
Thank you for reviewing the body products as I was mulling those over. I will now give them a pass as I too have sensitive skin and can't tolerate overly fragranced products. Also, anyone with sensitive skin or Rosacea prone skin should always avoid chemical sunscreens and opt for the physical sunscreens.
Please make a skin care video with your favs, your face skin is awesome!
I can't get enough of the coconut balm dot com and Milky Jelly Cleanser!
Thanks Anna. Super helpful, well presented review. I was trying to resist buying anything and then, bang!, you hit us with the 10% off code. I've just bought half of the Glossier website and couldn't be happier! Hoping Cake Generation G will make me look as fly as you and Allana :]
you always come up with the most helpful and well thought out videos! btw you're skin looks absolutely incredible! when you started putting make up on I got so confused hahah xx
I made my first Glossier order a few weeks ago and ordered one of almost everything! The only thing I do not care for is the skin tint. It makes me look like an oil slick about 2 hours in. Loved this review and you are the reason I made the order in the first place!
Oh man - Wish I'd watched this before I ordered some products! I need some Generation G!!
Love the thorough review! I'm also waiting for Glossier to release a bronzer :).
As a Combo skin, sensitive, dehydrated and acne prone skinned girl - the original priming moisturizer is holy grail for me. Changed my skin for the better.
Thank you for this Anna, very informative and on the strength of this have ordered a few items to try. I don’t know if you have been asked this before, and I know you’re pushing Glossier here, but have you ever tried any of The Ordinary serum products? If you have, I wondered how comparable you found them to say the Glossier serums? Thanks.
LOL definitely pale! - Right there with you! Thanks for the reviews, I placed my order the other day and can't wait to get it!
Thanks Anna! Really great informative video, my Glossier shopping list just got longer! Also noticed you are number 8 on Trending!!
You have such amazing brows, do you do anything to tame them, grow them, keep them healthy? Gorg! Xxx
You’re not the first one who itches after the shower gel. I’m missing out on these!
No customs? In that case I'll probably try the boy brow at some point since it's cheaper than benefit gimme brow. I haven't purchased a gimme brow in the new packaging yet because I don't like the new packaging and I'm annoyed that they increased the price.
I like that you kept it realistic! Xx
I've been looking forward to this video so much. However my first thought at the start was your hair looks great.
Love this- just done a glossier shop and this totally helped me make an informed decision. Bought stretch concealer, priming moisturiser rich and moon mask 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Thanks for the comprehensive review Anna!
you should always wear this tint ! it's so nice on your skin
Just waiting for my first order, looking forward to trying them. PS, I just listened to a podcast where Emily Weiss mentioned she uses her milky jelly cleanser on her err intimate area, you’re welcome lol xx
All the makeup YouTubers paying to get on trending hahah
out of everything you showed in your video today ima buy the bobbi brown  brush...and the cleanser
Ah I'm about to place an order but I can't select shipping in the uk anymore. I almost placed one yesterday and it was fine then 😭
Amazing run through! Thx Anna! Feel super informed and ready to hit up the site x
Yes!!! I have been waiting for this aha xxxx
Hi Anna, you mentioned having psoriasis a couple times before and I wonder if you could you do a psoriasis video? Not very glamorous I know haha - mine pretty much disappears in the Spring and reappears in Autumn so I would love to know your tips before it comes back. Thank you!!
Getting my order tomorrow can't wait 😀
Dying to know how the new perfume smells!?
I love crush!!! It looks great on my skin tone!!! I think it’s a very universal shade!!!
I disagree with the skin tint! I have OILY skin and that product is a holy grail. Matifying products always break down weirdly on oily skin. I just embrace my shine and that product doesn't break me out at all
Loved this.  Almost placed an order but glad I waited.  Based on your information about using the products for awhile, I have changed my mind about some items.  This video has helped me out a lot!  Thanks for the very helpful info, Anna!!
Thank you so much for this Anna.  I am about to do my first order and this is so helpful. X
Its been a month and i was skeptical to order but now I'm going to buy. Its a big order but im very curious to not look so beat. Im a little over that look. And this company celebrates natural beauty. I do have acne scaring not so severe but as my skin heals i feel its best to embrace my flaws as they recover. Long story short im buying.
Such an insightful video, can't wait to order! xxx
Obvs I placed an order on Monday (hurry up and arrive please!) but now watching this makes me want to go for order number two!
Can't wait for my order, watching you and Lily rave about this has made me so excited for UK shipping. Not sure my credit card will thank me though! Thanks for such a great review!!
Hiya, I sent you an email about helping me with my a level EPQ, would really appreciate if you reply as soon as possible xx
my first order is on the way over from the US right now. yay to shipito. I'm kind of excited - I hope I picked the right shades. I was like you know what you look like a mozzarella just get the lightest one of everything 😂
Very helpful! I'm hinting to family in the UK to send some to me in SA. Totally unrelated but... what do you use on your hair? It's always so lovely and shiny and sleek.
Thanks Anna this was very helpful - I have ordered the milky cleanser and concealer, hooray!
I love Generation G! They give a tinted look but feel nicer than a lip tint. I also really love the Milky Jelly Cleanser, Haloscope (Quartz) and Cloud Paints (Puff and Dusk for day, Haze for night. I'm also really enjoying Wowder (I look moisturized but it tamps down the Glossier look of looking like I can fry an egg on my face haha). The rest I'm kind of meh with. Stretch Concealer was a fail because I feel like it didn't actually conceal anything and Priming Moisturizer Rich WAS THE THE WORST because the lavender oil broke me out. I was so disappointed when I saw the lavender oil in the ingredients list but I bought it anyway because I love the brand. Anyway it was good to my skin for about two weeks and I actually thought the lavender oil would be ok...and then it murdered my skin. SMH.
Thanks so much for this! As someone with oily acne prone skin most of the skincare is a miss for me and makes me break out terribly (ugh superbounce was awful for me) so I appreciate the disclaimer in the beginning. I would stay away from all the skin products if you have acne prone skin even the concealer and highlighter which has coconut and castor oil. Don't get sucked in!
Just about the order my basket then this popped in to my subscription box !!  Perfect timing thanks Anna !!

I'm loving the look of your hair on this video Anna! You look so pretty :)
Love you and your videos! For redness you should try dr. Jart’s cicarepair tiger grass in the pot! Its so good and has spf in it too 👍🏼 really think you’ll like it 🤗
What a lovely review! I just ordered th Boy Brow in Clear and the Stretch Concealer in Light!! Can't wait to try them!
I really want to try the concealer but I'm not sure it'll cover my mum eye bags!! Xx
I haven't tried these products yet, but I've watched about a dozen videos reviewing them. They seem like they are targeted for women with really good skin, who don't want to wear much make up but just want a little boost. To be honest,my impression is that they are a lot of hype and not a lot of benefit for the money
Thanks for this! Anna, do you find the Moonstone Haloscope glittery or still glossy and sheeny like the others? I have milk pale skin so think that's the one for me, but I've read that it's chunkier than the other two...but I trust your judgment most on it!
anna! i'm a religious viewer/reader but i never comment - i just wanted to say thanks for being dedicated and awesome. I wanted to suggest/ask you to compare the glossier super pure to the ordinary niacinamide serum and super bounce to the ordinary hyaluronic acid. Also, have you ever tried topaz as an eyeshadow situation?? i love quartz but i'm considering topaz for that purpose
Just back from New York (still strugling with my jetlag), but I think it's a hype. Only bought the cleansing gel (is ok) and the brow gel. Otherwise, nothing special. It's all about the woman who really doesn't need make up.....(according to the Hirons lady),....so why use it than? Marketing: genius, quality wise: nothing special. So thanks, but no.thanks! 😂😎 And for the stickers...sorry, I'm nót a teenager that loves little kitty!
Yes, Glossier is really hyped, but I have a few issues with some of their products. I have no sensitive skin a lot, but skin tint, priming moisturizer and sometimes even the concealer make my eyes burning like crazy! I love the milk jelly cleanser, the balm - I should have picked the coconut one instead of the birthday one because I wake up in the morning with glitter everywhere on my face :P - and also the lipstick in Leo.
giiiirl, please do a body care video! I have terribly dry skin and love any recs to make my life better <3
Need to try Boy Brow!! Loved this video! Xoxo, Caylie
Why is this on trending😐👏🏼

Is it me or does this song give Travis Scott vibes?
Great. Another repetitive, mediocre beat, same lyrical theme with cop-out juvenile lyrics.  I swear most these new tracks sound so similar. Fr, nothing against guwop. I must be getting old or just feeling that rap-fatigue.
Not trending worthy in my opinion. \n\nI'm out.
You wanna know what else is enormous....... ;) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy heart...

Hi,Trever,I just happened to see your vedio on the weibo of Chinadaily,and started following U on youtube.:) Cannot wait to see ur new vedioes:D

Why following the Pennywise look?
We have been watching you for so long, your part of our home. What a cool show.  Keep going to all those cool places so we can visit some day!
Trevor, have you made any videos where you go to a big city, like Shenzhen, and go into a nice restaurant? Not street food but in an upscale sit down restaurant.
Eat dog
Everything is spicy. Everything tastes the same.

good
my boy trevor getting a little thicc
your video are very short...and seldom too..not unlike before
I'm glad there is still real food somewhere and not the commercial factory produced food in the west concocted in the lab instead of a real kitchens as shown here.
well, I see a certain Trever put on some weights over the last few months ;)
in start of this video, you walking on the street, the sound of your voice is incredible, can you tell me what kind microphone do you use?
Zigong is my hometown, so sweet, love this video.
When Food is too spicy it´s not fun. Eating should be fun and joy.
His accent is terrible
Eating my homemade tuna sandwich so delicious  when watching your homemade xiaochao.
Just 2 days of net problem in my home, made me miss your videos so much
It's good that you rate how spicy the dishes are, can you do that for the rest of your videos plz?
I think it's not that spicy for me. coz I can't eat without chilli
Ohh man u really did a good job, keep doing....loved ur video, chinese people n u..LOVE from INDIA
You're getting chubby :D I totally understand though, with all that delicious food available to you!
Are u ever planning to go to Korea?
I have never seen so many chillies in one plate 🔥🔥🔥🔥 I don't know how he could have finished that let alone take more than a couple of bites 😣😣😣 I can feel the heat
i love spicy food especially Chili's but this food is going to the extreme did you end up finishing the meal👍👍👍
why don't you try and come to cambodia?
I miss the bum
#46 ON TRENDING Trevoh and his team doing their thing.
Makes me hungry!
Wow first dishes I've seen where chilies are by far the main ingredient. I like chilies in almost everything but I don't think I could handles those.
Please man, can u send me some food through e-mail.... I get hungry watching ur videos even I just had a heavy meal....
I love your videos

9:12 Would love to try the sexy Gangbang noodles!
The food looks amazing but the interactions are just so... Awkward.
This guy is a real boom!! I'm from Zigong, the chicken feet place he went to was one of the most authentic places in my hometown, he must be really serious about his work to even dig that place out!! Cheers dude!!👊
I can't keep watching this. I'm salivating so much.
I can only wonder what my farts would smell like eating like that all the time.
14:11 That's what she said
The thumbnail looked like a chinese food pizza.
you're getting fat trevor. i can see your nips. get some exercise
I think ur fav place is china
Amazing! China is a place full of great things to explore with exotic foods to savour. Sichuan just makes it top notch.
Wow, as a spicy food lover this looks like Paradise!!! Must do a trip someday :)
I've just watch Shoukugeki no Shouma season 3 and in that episode Shouma learned about spicy Sichuan food and now I found this video! Very interesting!
Haven't watched food ranger's videos for a long time(about a month). So I cooked some scallops and had a glass of wine while I was watching this video. And....\nHey, food ranger, you've got the Sichuaness accent! Do you?
Hahaha I'm Sichuanese. I have to say his Sichuan dialect accent is very funny
I don't know how you manage to sound like a New Yorker in Chinese, but you did it.
Absolutely loved baozi, jaozi, and stir-fry lotus root when I went to China (south of Shanghai not Sichuan). Really miss the authentic flavors of certain places which had brought tastes from across china. A Sichuan jaozi place in hefei was amazing, I love spicy foods. Was lucky enough to bring some Sichuan peppercorns back, unlike any other spice.
Tell me Yibin is your next destination. so awesome!
I am literally dying as an International student from Sichuan in the US. because of your video. I just wanna book a flight and go back home immediately!!!!!!!! It is so painful that I am eating cereal while watching your video.
The guy at 0:35 was so lost he didn't know wtf was going on lmao
Just amazing to watch you enjoy the food and the people you meet.
This video is trending in the uk
the MSG factor is troubling
Why they put MSG in about everything?
Do they even have Mongolian bbq in China?

We need a Kylo Stimpy 'cos Ren needs a friend.
That was a good evil laugh there.
My helmet is like my favorite thing ever-kylo ren me too, me too kylo
His laugh at the end is killing me.\n\nWHAAT?! HAHAHAHAH!!!
Who is that handsome devil? lol
I hope the BlueRay will also include the *raw cut* when it comes out
This guy does the best kylo vids!
That laugh close to the end
The laugh kills me every time
Episode XII: Attack of the Cyporgs
Was that...couldnt be. Was that motherfucking baby time?
Kylo Ren's reaction to his first time on PorgHub.
Hearing Kylo Ren say kawaii... honestly guys, I did not expect that and it fucking killed me 😂
When he laughed at the end I fucking pissed myself
This guy needs more subscribers
that laugh at the end
THIS TRAILER IS 100% RAW!

This video was so RAW
I hope he still reacts to stuff unrelated to Star Wars after Star Wars is over.
I'm glad you like it Kylo
I'm really disappointed that weenie doesn't seem to be in his helmet for most of the movie.
“I need someone to show me my place in all of this...”\n\n“How bout in the ground?”\n\nLost it.
You should make videos of Kylo watching other trailers other than Star Wars. 👍🏽
I heard lady Gaga really liked this trailer. In fact, she said it was raw raw raw raw  rawwwww.
Chewy is Da Best HAHAHAHA That is All
It's baby time!
How about in the ground?\n\nKylo should have went super savage and said How about in the kitchen?
Ask Charlie Brown. He'll tell you what Christmas is.
Hey Kylo just so you know Star Wars The Last Jedi will be the darkest film of all Star Wars movies just like Empire Strikes Back. So that means the First Order is going to win in this film. I think you will be impressed with this new Star Wars movie Kylo.😀
It's baby time!
Raw, like I enjoy my DOG.
Congrats, you have given birth to the RAW meme.
I have been refreshing Youtube waiting for this. lmao

Dayyyuummm
This is 6lack putting his touch on the song, reason why it's a cover!!! I say flamessss!!!!!!
Not the biggest fan of dude's music, but I really don't enjoy just watching you guy shit on this cover. It was obviously from a place of appreciation and respect for Badu. This genre is similar but not totally his. And dude did his thing on it. Stop the hate spread love.
my nigga 6lack looking faded as fuck. mad cover
Greatness will always be critiqued by those less qualified. Bless 6lack
6lack is my guy; great music, but this wasn't wow at all. more like an 'oh, aiight, that was cool, I guess' lol
Bunch of Haterz in the comments. I can imagine those people to be analyzing every word he singing. It's good music for the Soul and Spirit. Don't matter if you don't like it because other people will.
6LACK got soul!
Unenthusiastic has a face
I already New it was going to be fire had to like it before he even started
Aye im not gonna lie to all y'all haters, in my opinion i think this shit is fire
Great voice. Soulful af
Not my style of music, but solid cover. 6lack has a strong set of pipes on him.
I already know I'm gonna like this
Straight Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I liked it, don't understand the hate, he should've been more vocally flexible he needed more range
Not bad at all
I heard dis song all my life... But he made me LISTEN. Badu was kicxin some REAL SHIT bac in da day...
Not my style of music but i love it
6lack lookin like Hall & Oates in the She's Gone video
Neo Soul is supposed to be sultry and understated, enthusiasm doesn't necessarily have to be conveyed through being loud or charismatic. Fantastic musical sensibility.
1:29 my favorite part 😍
Amazing 👏🏽👏🏽
Fam killed it
Loved it ❤️❤️
i know it's probably because Ben and Liam get a lot on unsolicited hate in the comments but I miss the little intros at the start of these videos it was always cool to see a bit of what the artist is like
Cant wait for the show in Atl!!! Zone 6 baby
It sounds okay I guess, maybe because he looks so uninterested in everything it kinda puts me off, haha. There is a girl on Youtube who does a cover that's really nice, her name is Mudi
So In Love with his voice! 😍
I honestly love this
Best Like a Version in awhile
Its a cover smh. Its supposed to be a lil differant.
6lack makes really good music, however, this cover should not have happened...like, at all.
I love this!! So soulful ❤ 6lack you did so dam good.
Huge! So well done xx
😍🎧🎤 #6lack #vibes
🔥🔥🔥
IM FUCKING SHOOK OMFG
🔥
Best thing since they found heroine
The way I love this guy’s voice
Beautiful. \nGave me goosebumps when this was on the radio this morning!
yup, ill take it
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*Girls frом уour citу want to meеt уou*

HETDClwTAuA,\n► http://mibik.ru/sex?x=HETDClwTAuA 😎
Loved it.
Badass cover!!
Oh shit ❤
They should do a collaboration 🔥
Definitely respect the nod to Badu. But this wasn't a good cover of On & On to me. No disrespect to 6lack though.
Lethargic
*yawn*
Six-lack never fails to amaze me
Yawn....
1000 level up from badu, sick !
Bring john butler on again
who is this sixlack?
how did he fit that rat on his head under that small ass beanie
There's nothing remarkable about this.
This cover is trash lol this is disrespect lol
Crap
Terrible voice
Erykah wanted to call him after hearing THIS ? Sounds lifeless to me. No feeling. #DontBelieveTheHype
Who the hell would watch some old fat dude take a shower? Lol
execute harvey for his crimes
Poor guy was just trying to get laid.
look at that, I cant blame him for trying ;)
G-d Dammed shiksa whore....Dats it she'll nevah woik in dizz town again We run dizz place yah hear......stupid gentiles....Sincerely haawvie winestone...
Nasty jew.
I just have a question...why now ladies ? Why not when it happened ? Or is it because you liked what he was doing to you ? You all went to bed with thim stop playing victims...
Who taped the conversation between he and the model?
Oh common people. He is not the only pig in the movie industry.
The year of the Weins. First Anthony w...../carlos danger/mr abedin. now HW....
THAT demanding insolent voice is THE DEMON Thats ON HIM TALKING! One demon on him -opens door for lots more. HarveyW IS TOTALLY OVERRUN WITH DEMONS. This guys lord is SATAN. AND NOW satan IS DONE WITH HIM. Devil COMES TO STEAL KILL AND DESTROY! 👎💩👎💩👎
When women singers like the one who used to be Hannah Montana sexually harrasing males none bat and eye, but when a Male do same thing, all of you start complaining about it like a bunch of little kids.
Still...not nearly disgusting as Comrade Trump, who RAPES America EVERY DAY.\n\nBOOT OUT ALL republicons, NOW!
a beautiful 22 year old italian model \nthanks for letting us know she was 'beautiful', news. because that's a really valuable and relevant piece of information to a sexual harassment case.
So gross. Has some fetish with being watched taking a shower and beating it. Very weird the way he begs for it. Smh.
So now it seems clear to me that any so called actress who was in his films has revealed themselves to be a PROSTITUTE No MAN would ever sleep with a fat ugly woman no matter how rich or powerful but women on the other hand......
He made all this people rich
Can he even find his penis beneath that belly?
Grab her by the pussy.
Maybe he''ll be having a shower with big bubba someday soon.
How's the power over women goin Harvey? How's it going?
Yet you all support Hollywood from Woody Allen barely legal adopted Korean daughter to Michael Jackson molesting young boys.  Corey Feldman so messed up (some kind of victim syndrome).  Even Bill Clinton molesting interns as govenor to President.  You all gawk at celebrities as role models?  Why now with McGowen?
No woman is going to have sex with that ugly mug on purpose unless she is blind!
Disgusting Hollywood kike. Deserves to be removed from this planet
If the devil had a voice, his is what it would sound like
Not only actresses in Hollywood who experience sexual harassment, but ordinary young women around the world. Molestation of girls, Here's how you fight it. # speakout #speakup #saynotomolestation PEOPLE LIKE HIM SHOULD BE HANGED. \nLink👉👉👉👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI5UfM6DJWI&t=4s
Everyone shoud read this blog about Hollywood's hypocrisy with President Trump: http://www.trumpscorecard.com/gone-too-far-1.html
Put a bullet in this kike prick's head.
That's not good, of course. But come on! All these celebs would be nobody without his help. And if some of them said No to hime, they said Yes to other perverts.
I hope we can all come together as a country and kill all the people like this including trump :) Happy Murder everyone
What about the allegations of sexual harassment, seems to me not denying it means it’s TRUE
Brave girl. All those pigs should be exposed and put in prison.
They would if they could but they can't, its a c*nt.
He looks like a cancerous elbow.
Dad always told me never go into a room with a jew
He probably didn’t even need the five minutes.
If your president does it what do you expect!
A fat lecherous jew...who would ever believe it?
I was Weinstein's Doorman and Savages's Call screener Jimmy is refusing to put my call through to tell Savage he's wrong in attempting to paint a sympathetic picture of Weinstein now.  How pathetic. Even the Jews 1st in Savage is showing through.
*When  you're a star they let you do ANYTHING*. \nWhen you're the president, you can get away with it too.
This filthy jew has been raping our Aryan sisters. We must gas the kikes now.
Now he just needs some tictaks and he's qualified to be President.
Man, he's got game.
Weird that it was recorded....... he didn't force her so....... you telling me if you had a model in your hotel room that you wouldn't try to seduce her? wth was she even doing there? You say pig I say trying his luck, yh he sunk low but who hasn't?
So that's why Mira Sorvino's career tanked - she refused to play with Weinstein's weiner
This guy couldn't sound any more like a New York Jew if he tried. You know that nasally measly mouse voice common to New York Jews, much like Chuck Schumer. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with that, just pointing out the obvious.\n\nIt's funny if I had nothing else to go on other than his voice I'd know that he was a New York Jew. It must be something in the water.
Why use allegedly in the title?? Allegedly makes is sound like there's a debate or a question as to the factuality of there being a recording. There's no debate. He was recorded saying those disgusting things.
a real man, is a predator(a rapist?).... what do us marines, think about that?  man proposes & woman disposes.... harvey, we support  U....
Wankstein got the horn more than a raging bull. Dirty old man
watching this is making me want to shower
I will destroy all my dvd movies, I dont want dirty pigs in my shelves anymore
This is a UNESCO plot to destroy a clean living Jewish Boy,thats why the USA is right to PULL OUT of UNESCO for being bias towards Israel and Harvey.
this dude's balls were never empty
The police r worse cos they chose a woman whose known as a partygirl than an actress. I can see him going free.
There's no smoke without fire too many allegations for it to be untrue dirty entitled arrogant pig
Harvey Weinstein is NOT a pig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is toilet scum.
I dont understand why did they wait so long to sue him and report those facts.
Hollywood seems to be full of very *strange* people , can you guess what group they belong too ? ..Here is a clue ' You can't talk about them '.
Hey can all the anti-Semitism.
Weinstein is a sexual predator but the ALMIGHTY HOLLYWOOD protects him and their fellow sexual deviants goyim.\n\nThey thought the Satanic Cult is just a crazy Christian Conspiracy. But this is a hard evidence that several A-listers accused him now.
Don't ruin your friendship with me over five minutes... How simultaneously sad and needy, disgusting and manipulative.
No one should be surprised at what the culture of permissiveness and near naked women and power created. It is also no wonder at the more than 100,000 rapes in this country due to the bombardment of everything having to be sexy.  Virtually everything in the movie industry has an element of sex thrown in and giving something a PG-13 rating will not stop young viewers. Make the ratings and warnings much stronger. God, family and country.
Throw the book at this pervert.
That italian chick ruined her chances to become next Hollywood stupidstar...
Whats wrong with desperately pleading with a beautiful model?
Did this nice man maybe upset the wrong jews?
If its only alleged surly you shouldn’t be making a video on it?
Please dont be outraged by Harvey Weinstein if you voted for a president that wants to grab em by the pussy!
A jew protected for decades by Jewry in Hollywood \nNothing to see here
That man looks too dirty for taking shower so often....
Jews have a perverse and degenerative effect on American society
Waiting for a guy to denounce him for sexual harassment too. That would be funny.

Cesspool breeds maggots! Why is everyone so surprised?
What's wrong with you people?!\nShe's full of age, he wants sex, so what? She could have left anytime.\nJust because he's ugly yet rich doesn't make it a crime.
Allegedly??? No that was him... I hate how they try to make a rapist sound like he maybe innocent....
Our cultures popular entertainment is trash, ran by trash, who wants you to be trash.
did he grab her pussy? \n(did he ask first?)
Beck's videos are so fucking cool.
watched on acid. it went for hours but my eyes exploded half way through. luckily my ears could just hold out. delicious.
Metendo a mão na massa

YASSSSSS
Best new song off the album
Throwback to George as a hand model circa 1993
great song but the slime with little balls is cringey
somebody tell me please these aere all subliminal messages😂😂😂😲
This is one of the non-inventive songs I've heard this year.  Beck's lost it!
Why didn't you released this when slime was as popular as Taylor swift
this is the ultimate stim video
Casting call for hand models with long filthy fingernails
Beck is always up to something dope
His new songs are garbage pop
Remember Orbitz??  Yup.   Oh good track too.  Beck is frickin unstoppable
WNDR★ #NewSound ~ Beck - Colors\nhttps://www.facebook.com/WonderMusicTV/posts/885781214929231
Beck was watching some slime punk songs/videos
Great storyline.
wow
Holy fug, Beck brought floam back! 😎
Love this ❤️😍
Bello!
WOAHHH
Dude. yes 🔥✨✨✨
Beck is so talented.
ASMR activate!
satisfying video
Best video on youtube!
shit music for the brainless new generation ... bring in the cash says beck
coincidence that the video's length is 4.20?
How many professional slime fingers were hired for this music video?
So proud of you Maya!
I get this feeling that stuff Beck's doing lately is too cool to be true
This looks like something I leave in the toilet in the morning.
If Beck has a kid, the kids hand is his kids hands. Right Beck? ^_^
Tears For Fears.
We made It :')
I H8 SLYIEM
Astonished.\nFucking beautiful.
Oddly Satisfying
slimy masterpiece,new album rocks!
Textura!
i like the flute
Tibbleslimes helped with the slime part
What's with the baby hands and what is under that other persons finger nails?
i just keep imagining an epic fight inside a subway car
Beck, you should buy an old 4 tracks recorder. This song is awful!
Why do I have a hard on? 🙄
This was uh.... I little uncomfortable to watch.
Kool.  Are you thinking about it?.  Say,  yes. 6mths.
I don´t think the lenght of the video is mere coincidence :P
pop candy music/visuals targeted towards the millennial market.  beck knows his business.
Who else loves slime they should make a slime omoji
freakin awesome and as usual per Beck's standards original!  always loved Beck, always will!
The most satisfying video in the world: SLIME EDITION
Every school needs a slime room. If you're feeling bad you can take a slime pass and play with slime for 10 mins then come back.
4:20 because that's trippy as fuck
The fuck did I just watch
is it just me that feels like they're heard this song before or one almost exactly like it and can't put their finger on it?
Even Beck is into ASMR now!
I really hope this is a joke
Hey you can look at my slime vids any time have a goid night or day and i like this vid
Best single from the new album. Eager to give the whole thing a listen
Orgasmos sonoros
looks like beck watched some diy slime videos
Beck! cool!
Panpipe riff, well played good sir.
really great video
Just got his new music cd yesterday. Great tunes! Grammy material!
It’s like watching the oddly satisfying videos playlist on Instagram
Best idea for a music video I have seen in a while
It's almost unfair how talented beck is. Almost.
Love him so much! This video is so damn beautiful!\n I'm independent singer-songwriter and music producer. Hope you like my songs Devotion and Teenage Angst :) Please share your opinion and like. Thank you!:)
This is how you stay relevant.
Oh how I miss mellow gold Beck.
A picture of you thinking whould be a better video
Too bad Beck has continued his decent into children's music. His next song will feature Elmo, Barney, and the Teletubies.
That's not Beck :(
My favorite song on the album... I liked one or two others, but for me, I'd have to put this with Modern Guilt as one of my least favorite in his entire collection, lol. When I think dance album Beck, Midnite Vultures is hard to top...
Why just put slime in ur video lol
great dance song but also very good background music. love u beck!!
Hola dejare mi comentario en español haber que sucede.\nMe gusto el video de la cancion
No me explico como esto me provoca tanto placer
I'm in that weird part of YouTube again.
that's some slime porn for sure.
What an extremely interesting song and video. I 'm pretty into it!
why is the slim so erotic?
Great. Now I have a thing for slime.
When will this segment appear on Sesame Street?
The name of this album is so perfect
Slime lover here!!!!!\nAnyone else?
The only pop music I listen to!

For views.
Thanks, man. We need this. I'd never heard him mocking the pronunciation of Puerto Rico. I can only watch him speak within the context of your videos - otherwise, I just have to read the stories. He's too gross.
Oh my goodness Randy, I have tears running down my face, that is brilliant! keep doing what you’re doing, you make this administration more bearable.
Poor Trump. This must be the first time he ever tried to pronounce a word in a language other than English.  Someone must have tried hard to teach him the pronunciation and get him to pick it up accurately.  But they failed.
All those dislikes I will hunt u down and dislike u
Every thing u said is sooo true
Im so happy right now
The only reason there are dislikes is because people are mad that they didn't write this.
Good day,\n\nHAHAHAHAHA!!!\n\nThank You The tragedies are horrible, but this Yellow Bodied Cowardly LiAR-ito....\n\nThank you for your time.
Randy Rainbow is so pretty.
This guy needs to be a guest on SNL!
Been having a bad week, for about a year now!  ... In and out, in and out, three times - okay well lets not get into your sex life!\nLMAO! This is amazing!
Funny, but even funnier is Hilary's book!  How come everyone knows What Happened except her?
Awesome!
Hilarious as usual. Thank you Randy, just what the doctor ordered 😂
From France : you are a genius ! ;) xoxoxo
8000 to 142. Yeah, I think you nailed this one too. :D
You're my favorite human.
Who are the 141 people that disliked this? Is it Trump disliking it on numerous devices?
thank you. MY NEW FAVORITE SONG! awesome
OMFG Randy's voice is amazing. Me and my daughter keep this song on repeat 😂 grabby braggadocios creepo is perfect
I'm a fan for sure!  You freekin killed it.  Thanks from all of us Puerto Ricans!!!
We got very high marks! we got A+ pluses Good Boy ahaha\nthe feeling you get when you get A+ on your math test or any other subject :D
You may possibly be the Wind Beneath My Wings
It starts at 1:07 ur welcome
Thank you Randy!  Just love and appreciate you so much!
A guy from Puerto Rico Hit like on this video! Good!
I heard Justin Bieber did a parody of this song
Randy’s wig is more convincing than Trump’s, and I can see the zipper.
😂😂😂😂😂😂 can't stop laughing, this is genius
Make a parody about him but using the song rolex
So funny everything you said is Correct about him
You're very good and very talented if you haven't been on Broadway yet you should be. Keep up the good work!
I showed all my friends this even my teacher and know my user name is desperate Cheeto
OMG, THIS IS THE BEST YET! LMBO!
Randy, you are so cool!
This parody is better than the real song.
Much better than the original
I would really like to know if anyone in the Current Regime watches these videos.
Yass this is my favorite song
You're a crabby, unproductive creep-o Killed it!!!
I can foresee this getting 1,000,000 views by November who agrees like if u agree
I love all your songs but I can't stop singing this one 😉😘😍❤
Your vocal range, is amazing...always in awe
I can’t stop watching this. I’ve listen to it about10 times now and I still want to listen to it again. Randy you’re addictive.
This is completely disrespectful to our president. I am utterly disgusted. Jk! I don't give a shit!! Best video ever, although I must say the Steve Bannon one was classic!! 😂😂👌
Randy is using his voice for comedy to great effect, but when he sings more seriously, his voice is so beautiful it gives me chills.
I LOVE this one!
God damn Randy, back at it again with the perfectly written parody!! You're incredibly talented
I love when he takes on the voice of the 2nd singer.
“You are a grabby braggadocios creep-o” my fave quote!  😂😂😂 funny but true
Randy I found your glasses and got them!!!👓👓👓👓
Randy, you are a musical and comedic genius. I adore your uploads!!!
I would have your children if I had a uterus
YAY! OMG! You made it happen! Congratulations on 100,000+ !!! Celebration time! 🌈🌈🌈🍰🍿🍭👏👏👏👍🦄😀😀 🍰🍰🍰😛🍩🍿🍫🍬🍰🍾🍾🍾
I love this new video! It showcases Randy's talent so beautifully.
Superb skills. Funny. Three dimensional. Erudite. You are a force of light. An absolute treasure. Thank you Mr Rainbow.
I can't stop watching this! Seriously the best one yet from Randy 💕💕
My gosh you have such a gorgeous voice.  And this is hilarious.  One of your best, I think!
This is so great
DESPERATE CHEETO!!! Best song that has ever been made
You are FANTASTIC, Randy. And a great singer!
Ok, but this is really good 😂😂😂
You are absolutely amazing if you ever go on tour come to Arizona I want to see you perform
Randy please do one with Trump sitting at a table when he was PR, with his balls hanging low, those pants was cracking his nuts!
It's always a fucked-up week in the drumph regiem
You hit it out of the park with this one.
@randyrainbow why can't I buy this song on iTunes 😩
OMG your just so adorable. cute, funny, and such talent <3. Never hit the like/sub button so fast before. A bright ray of rainbow light in these depressing times we live in.
You are just getting better!
🤣😂you have to have a sense of humor this is brilliant watched 10 times still laughing🤣😂
this is the best thing i've seen in my life
And hilarious!
This is Fucking hilarious
u have musical.ly
So good. LOL...
genial, buenísimo!
Justin Bieber lol

Hillarious🤣love it
Sweet voice!!
YYAAASSSSS
Genius.    Yep.
TEARED so much HAHAAHAHHAAHAHHAAHHAAHAHHAHAA
Well done!
Still your president
Randy keeps me sane
Fuck you mf
Awesome
Muy excelente!
This is brilliant!!
Genius.
love it!
Making fun of the President isn't going to get you anywhere especially your career.  Have some pride in yourself or maybe you have a little too much of the WRONG pride.
Cheeto thinks he is a smart-O when he tries his fake accent to say Pwetoh Wiko! Fuckin moron. \nThank you for the laugh Randy!
I love your videos.  Um, but, um, could you please not show that creep-os face so much?  :)
This is just shit 😂
I could listen to you all day Randy.
Still better then hillary
A bit racist isn't it?  The next time there's a black president, will it be okay to poke fun at his skin?
Make a model of the paper and measure the paper with photographs and electron beams and write some simple software to measure the output and report on surface area. Measure model map I always say. Thanks for the Hilbert quote. We will know!!
This was exactly how I got a job as a sound tech in college! They asked why I wanted the job with no experience, I just said, every time I walk by a sound board, I want to know what all those knobs do.\nThe real answer was that I didn't want to work in the dish pit, but I got in regardless.
Can you fill a klein bottle with watter?
I don't really know about doing an integral, but couldn't I just measure and subtract the area of the triangles that are made when the papers are lined up? 1:45
HOW DID HE EXPLAIN OWNING AN IPHONE I NEED TO KNOW
I would use a scanner to determine the area. Would just need to determine how much area each pixel is.
Clifford Stoll is a Ph.D. astronomer. But back in 1986, while employed as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker, one who stole $0.75 of computer time (back when you had to rent computer time-no one owned computers back then)—later identified as a KGB agent—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. \n\nStoll was tenacious and needed to KNOW even then-I mean, how many people would devote months trying to find a $0.75 accounting error?\n\nAfter identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. It is recognized as one of the first examples of digital forensics. He described the events of his investigation in The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which was a huge international best seller, and is an excellent book that I highly recommend.
For a moment I thought I was watching Julias Sumner Miller. Those were the days.
I feel like noticing the trapezoid paper (and the innacurate ruler) is one of the few things that would be easier in American units, because our papers are all 8.5x11, so when you start measuring and it's 8.45x10.9, something's wrong. If it's 8.45x9.9, there's something very wrong.
i was a little sad about my future, but after i watched this, it encouraged me.
This guy is what indiana jones would look like when teaching
Cliff is great, would have liked to have had him as a teacher for sure. Enthusiasm is important
I want to be his student
Great advice for youngsters, and others too.
I actually hired someone not once, but twice for two different companies because he said in the first interview “I don’t know, but I know I can figure out the problem if I had more time and the right tools.” This was after he tried to trouble shoot a timed, and impossible to solve, hardware problem (yes I rigged it).
Cliff both looks like and has the same speech patterns as Rick Sanchez.
Can numberphile make a video on infinity - infinity =π
This is beautiful, Cliff
I love him so much 💗💗💗
His students are lucky.
My first thought was the ruler tbh.
This guys brain is wired just like mine
I like that feeling
I want to ask that guy a question
Is the Earth pear shaped?
Why don’t more teachers do this? You know, make students think. This man is brilliant.
So enthusiastic about his work.. I Really like him...mathematically speaking..
I loved this!! What an awesome guy! And super interesting
This guy should have a TV show only for himself
How is this man still not knighted?
have he done a video about everyone is 7 handshakes away from the president? i found that odd
i love this guy
This man looks like Einstein on weed
Homework every night? No thanks
I still don't know how to meassure the paper properly now.
This guy is AMAZING !!!!
I knew he was probably gonna tell me that measuring a piece of paper may not be as streight forward as I think... but this.. I didn't expect this..... awesome.
and no students notices that with that definitely Trumpfakish ruler, the usual 20x27cm sheet of paper measured... 20x26cm ;-) (check on the video)
There is an imperfecto ruler right now and nobody gets it either.
This is sooooo cooooool!!!!
This video probably had a larger impact on me than 4 years of high school teachers. Education is so much more than standardized tests and memorization. It's about learning how think and feel and react. This was beautiful.
This 5 minute video conveys a sense of scientific rigor so amazingly well!\nI love this so much, I emailed it around the intro physics lab department at my university yesterday morning.  This morning, we're talking about maybe using this as the first lab of the fall semester for next year's program.\n8th grade?  The lessons in this video apply at all levels of research.
o didn't think you'd be an iPhone guHILBERT DAVID HILBERT
That's really educational!\nBtw, I was unintentionally expecting a cry of Great Scott lol
He goes on about the desire to know things, only to go all around trying to find that mathematician's name. That's one way to show you stick to your philosophy!
3:50 This is something that comes natural in CERTAIN areas. For some people its science others its math, others its English.
He is weird, but amazing!
Can someone help me find a value of n that works other than 2:\nn^3-1= prime #
This is the opposite of click bait
Morty! Marty!! We have to go back to the future Marty to get back to the past to fix the present
I've got one word for this guy, FLUBBER
I mean, i like the content of the video... but seriously... i can't watch it due to the sickening BWP Actioncam... :/
This guy is different and I like him
He sounds like Ernie from Sesame Street
I was surprised to see it’s not a rant by Matt Parker!
The one thing I must know is who would dislike this video.
Is there a place where we can get like a PDF copy or something of the imperfecto ruler he uses, or is it a secret of cliff only
I'm almost certain that drive for knowledge is learned, not a natural gift. If you've got it, some event in your past showed you learning how to discover a fundamental truth is empowering in any future dealings with the subject of that truth.
I love Cliff.  He's just so enthusiastic and it's contagious
I love this guy, he's so animated and engaged.
The Klein bottle guy. You are Awesome..
15-16 people in each class, hHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Got to know things is a great way to live. Thanks Cliff
I adore this Professor.  His enthusiasm is infectious.  And his mind is deep and scary and wonderful.
Origin of the imperfecto- they were starting out and tried to make a ruler to sell. But there was a mistake at the factory and the 17 went twice. They decided to go with it and change the name of the ruler, making the company unique and like no other ruler company, making imperfect measuring devices.
What about the holes.
Always examine the assumptions you're making. Advice that's useful to all scientists and engineers!
Best video i've seen today.
Acting outlandishly can get you a fair bit of mileage.
I thought that one of the interpretations would include measuring the depth of the paper by folding it and using the depth to find the area of its edge-like sides.
He should be collecting royalties off Dr. Emmett Brown.
the moment I saw the homework assignment, I immediately thought that I would measure it by attempting to cut a shape of known area, and weighing that piece. Then weighting the whole sheet and multiplying by the known mass per a unit of area (this is how we used to do it for figuring the area under a chromatography trace.)\n\nFor the sides, I was thinking I would cut the paper into several pieces and stack them, to get the thickness of the paper, but I am not sure how precisely the cut edge of the paper matches its thickness.
1.21 jiggawatts
Omg I love this Cliff guy so much! So full of energy and you can really tell he loves his work. I wanna be like Cliff when I grow as old as he is.
Find the minimum value of (10a+13)^1/2+(10b+15)^1/2 given that a+b=10
This is the kind of teacher I aspire to be.
Can Cliff Stoll be my professor?  Please?
I would assume there would be some chance that the students results in many cases would not match based on which edges they measured.\nSo then, have them explain why . This would be interesting to observe.\n\nMight experiment on my kids ... now where do i get an imperfecto  ruler.  Must be one in my garage somewhere.
I really wish I had been a student in one of Cliff's classes. He has such great enthusiasm for everything and I love his take on maths and sciences! Every Numberphile video I watch featuring him makes me super happy and pumped! If he ever did an encore class, I'd do everything in my power to attend as I envy his former students!
I would love to have him as a teacher
What a delightful person.
Yes.
Savage Klein bottle guy
We love parker square!
This guy is sooo cool.
Klien bottle guy!
Cliff rocks!
Doc Brown.
Nice

Inspiring guy

YAYYYY CLIFF!!!
Amazing! :D
Mad genius
That's such an awesome story.
This animation was amazing.
Love this
This was such a lovely surprise
Great animation! Where's my vault package at tho? Still haven't gotten it😂
who the hell dislikes this??
Animation and Storytelling are both Ace. One gets the feeling that when Jack (John) really connects with someone, who has a heart as pure as his own, it's friends forever. Not many folks care to remember for a minute what you really want most let alone years. \n🎸🐧💙
Wow, what a tale :) Awesome animation!
Things like these are what makes life worth living.
This is fucking cool and I appreciate it.
Cried during that show.
Jack and Meg need to get back together for just one last gig
What a very nice little animation. I love it.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Amazing. Love it.
I love Conan and I love Jack and Meg
Thank you for the video :)
This was a beautiful story and video, thanks. :)
This is fucking amazing, god I wish they'd come back now more than ever. I really hope Meg is doing okay
was also tws last ever performance :(
Fantastic!

The dancer Justin is hot 🔥💕
did no one else see the tr*mp tower at :20 cause that shit doesn't belong here
So much fun !  They can be all friends but there is always a limit! She is their boss and they have to respect her as a boss and not as a friend... many singers go through the same stage of life that she is going... although she is having fun and she seems to be pretty cool
This reminds me of high school musical
I love her so much😧😭❤
omg this was in Atlanta. I've been to both of the places she went to, they were fun asf
She’s so down to earth and keeps it real
I love this please do more camila

I LOVE U AND I HAVE UR BACK ❤
this girl really never fails to inspire me so much. first, to just reach for your dreams no matter what happens; that it is scary but you just have to do it scared. now, to never forget to live because one day you'll look back at life and it's not the riches, fame, your occupation or your degree that will matter but the memories & relationships you created. im emo. i love her. 😭
I miss her relationship with the girls of fifth harmony
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💜 🙈 , PERU PRESENTE Y APOYANDOTE 🌹 🙆❤❤

Please read this comment! The state of California has essentially legalized INTENTIONALLY infecting others with HIV via SB 239. I have created a White House Petition to call on congress to publically address SB 239 and call for its repeal! I have FaceBook group called Repeal Sb-239. If you could talk about SB-239 and address this issue and call for people to sign the petition it would be a great help. I am paying to promote a vid on my channel that talks about this because it sets a dangerous precedence! Please help! I need 100,000 signatures within 30 days. We could do something good!
The Best feeling in the world is see you happy babe i Love u

Havana music video
Merece todo o amor do mundo!! 😍
that chick had THE WORST golf swing i've ever seen in my life.
I have a question for camilacabello \nCan I make a mashup with your son Havana
fyi this guy reposted your vid and has copped 10M views on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/mentesencaospuntocom/videos/1856750831032112/\n\nmight want to ask for credit and link to this vid. I googled line rider and your vid was the 2nd link to show up.
Hi, this page uploaded your video without giving you the credits that you deserve, now it has 11 M views. That's not right!\n https://www.facebook.com/mentesencaospuntocom/videos/1856750831032112/?hc_ref=ARQggUHuwbdTmAlYPC9GtWz0E3e1SfYQ34NSfTruo0B_NVQQhJrWmOoCeLnau7UMyB8
This took him a month to make and it's so perfect\nif you don't share this you basically have no soul lol
No way! This was insane! Personally my favorite was the end part, especially where all the little dots made the dude speed up. I think I had this game when I was young, and it was VERY fun! Great video!
Spend a month making an amazing video: 1m views\nTake said video and reupload it to a Facebook page: 50+m views \n\nDoes this frustrate you or are you happy that the video gets attention even if it's not on your platform? Curious.
I couldn't stop smiling this made my day.
This is incredibly brilliant, and so beautifully illustrates the way great music evokes feelings and images! I hope you all take a few minutes to watch, and enjoy it as much as I did!
Time for my daily viewing of this video.
Must've started working on this when linerider was still popular
Please! more classic music <3
This is the pinnacle of human achievement
This is absolutely fantastic! Well done.
Beautiful!  Can you zoom out to show the whole thing the poor fella went through?  Great job.
Holy hell, this is still a thing?
I can’t imagine spending so much time on something I wouldn’t get paid for. Just kinda hurts to think about how little money he received for so much hard work.
I did not even blink once. Damn, imma get into that shit some more
Brilliant work! are the numbers supposed to mean something?
What are those numbers supposed to mean?
It would be cool to see the score painted in the background.
Love it. Brilliant and funny.
How is this song called?
Weird question, but are you somewhere on the autism spectrum? :)
Dang linerider that brings me back to my teens. Also the final stop was a nice gag. I wholly appreciate this <3
You have done something incredible. Congratulations.
I seriously belive i would have had a stroke if he missed a note
The time this must have consumed. You absolute madman!
That. Was. The most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
have you been working on this since the game first came out?
Absolutely amazing. Must have taken a lot of work. Great job!
Your video has 12.5 million views on Facebook...
DId john cage wrote this?
I love it how the music just fits
I can't stop watching this and it's been like 3 days.
am I the only one finding this absolutely hilarious? 😂
Brought back all my nostalgia from playing this game back in the day, and did it with an utterly AMAZING bit of work. Bravo and a thousand internets to you, good sir!
Yes, I enjoy!  Thank you.
Watched a dozen times so far!
I have never seen anything in gaming that was as amazing as this. No kill streak, not that USS Enterprise that those people made in Minecraft, not the Madden championships, nothing. The person that made this is a gaming legend.
most entertaining video of 2017
Oh my GOODNESS! As a musician, that was PHENOMENAL. Any animator, musician, or game creator would absolutely LOVE this. Keep up the good work fellow human!
I like it how he looks at you when he falls off his sled XD
The part where the sled seemingly flew off, but then it started playing along. Fuck me I'm stunned, can't wait for more //
Знаете, это очень точная иллюстрация средне-статистического рабочего дня российского дизайнера )))\nМульт просто гениальный!
Never thought that i whould see this game again :P, Nice work btw.
Wish I could super-like this. I broke into a huge, gleeful smile as it began intensifying more and more.
I Love the internet
I am so speech-less now......\nI'm now glad this was recommended on my list XD\nGreat work, really great work!
This is cool and all but imagine what we could achieve if everyone had this kind of motivation but actually used it for something useful.
I wish you a long and happy life, I love you ❤️
Do Warren Hill's Hey Jude adaptation on saxophone!!
I didn't know this was still a thing. +1 for the nostalgia bomb.\n\nIf I could, I've give another +1 for the track design.
His other video is just as amazing!It's to like a techno song, super duper cool. \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XJpVbUICUb4
Man, I have seen dozens of Line Rider videos, and this is far-and-away the best one.
Is this a game?
This Baby Driver trailer looks great 👌🏽
My goodness, I haven't watched a Line Rider video since high school, like.. during the primal time of YouTube. I'd love to see more of these. <3
This is just amazing😄😄
This wonderful musical piece has unfortunately become such a gimmick in modern media. This brilliant piece of work helps make it respectable again-- by pairing it with something that is actually impressive.
Wow, this has exploded, hasn't it!
There's what looks like a pirated version of this on Facebook with 11 million views...
I watched this at school I'm music class. It's cool and cute
Watch at 2x speed if you want to give yourself a heart attack
This is amazing! Though I think this guy stole your video and is getting your views! https://www.facebook.com/mentesencaospuntocom/videos/1856750831032112/?hc_ref=ART3Ocf385p-ONzOJahnsCbFLxTEM4eQqlpmRHiSs4WvfrL2Aw7j9YeX3mxc2Gwmo8Q
I think this is my favorite video on yt.
By far the best video I have seen all year. Well done, Sir. Well done indeed.
That sled has seen better days
There is very little that could make me feel better today. But this did it. I was grinning the entire watch. Thank you~
Came here from my band teacher that saw  this on Facebook lmao
Towards the end the song got scarier
I couldn't stop laughing when it reached 86. It was not only satisfying, but it was hilarious.
Thank you for this.
I think this is truly a work of art.
This is amazing wow!!

Yep, I'm gonna hold off for another five seconds cause I always end a little... too... early. Oh, look look look, nearly nearly nearly. Nuts are going in!
Thank you for the dairy free recipe
Where on earth do you find hazelnut milk!!!?!?!!
Dairy free recipe but you used eggs......
Mike just wanted to put his nuts all over that roll but Ben kept getting in the way
But I’m a girl and I can’t eat dairy
Wait it says coffee st the start and hazelnut in the title
“let me guess, someone stole your sweet roll”
Love the video, but I'm allergic to hazelnuts :(
Very nice, thanks for sharing!
i must try this, thank you.
Hey Mike, you are acting a little strange lately, are you alright?\nBlink twice on the next video if you need help!
Ben almost said Dairy Free Girlfriend at the end don't even try and hide it lad
You can make this vegan by replacing the egg yolks in the cream with silken tofu and the eggs in the cake with aqua faba for the volume and oil for the fat!
Mike''s looking better than eva... so YUMMAYY :)
Ben wins for the first minute with that nose pinch over the glasses...
You're knocking off my nuts \n-Micheal
Could I replace the coffee with something else? Dairy free but I can't stand the taste of coffee..
If he waited until cake was cooled off a little I don't think it would've stuck to the parchment. Can't always cover bad bits with powdered sugar
Oh my god, that looks soo good... I wanna have it!
oh my god Mike don't ignore it >:C
Looking for Jermi in the commnets ;)
That looks yummy even for people who can eat dairy.
I've already become obese watching this. Eating it will kill me for sure.
Swiss rolls are awesome and super tasty so it's awesome that you made a video with this recipe, but you can tell that it's def not perfect. Swiss rolls should be round and the spiral should stand out well otherwise the cake part might not have been made right which is totes fine for just eating with family, but you want to impress your mates right? ;)
Wow it is on trending!
aw man i *just* used the hazelnut milk i had sitting around to make a faux alfredo to get rid of it.
I only invited him because our mums are friends - I've never heard anything more relatable than this
my name is Jeremy But no girlfriend hard r i p.
You're knocking off my nuts ;)
You come for the recipes - you stay for the puns
Hmm...reading a comment I had an idea.  These things rarely escape so I hope this is a good one.  Here goes...How about an education week?  Teaching a class or feeding the 5000 in a dinner school or students restaurant.  Best foods for learning etc.  I'm sure that students will love it.  Well, how did I do?  Oh...OK.   Sorry, I think I'll just go off and disappear.
“And then you wanna grab yourself (long pause) a tray lined with paper.” 😂
JEREMY YOU IDIOT i died
Stoked to see your flavour choice!  Hazelnut and coffee is one of my absolute favourite combos. Thanks for the shout out :)
Love how he explains the reason for each ingredient/action!
Did anyone notice the head-wiggle Ben always does while or after saying sorted?
Any suggestions if you can't have eggs or dairy? 😥😥😥 I've the worst allergies :(
I’m Jeremy’s girlfriend literally
I'm sorry but you know Mary Berry would say that the roll is not tight enough!!
Huh that's how I roll my joints 🤔
Mike, you can totally be Jeremy’s girlfriend if you want to. You can be anything you want if you believe hard enough.
Keep up the dairy free desserts/ food! 👌
What? didn't understand girlfriend explanation >.<
I love the intro it's so funny
Is it possible to substitute hazelnut with macadamia?
Please temper your hazelnut coffee mixture or you will scramble the yolk
What if you can't find hazelnut milk? Will other nut mills work??
u're knocking off my nuts\n\nthat sounded damn wrong man XD
The best things about dairy-free and/or vegan recipes is that those can be enjoyed by everyone in the family together!
It has to be nice to have so few allergies in one's circle of acquaintances that dairy free poses a problem. I once made a birthday cake that was nut free, egg free, gluten free, chocolate free, berry free,  stone fruit free and that did not contain lactose, in order to accommodate all the allergies and intolerances within the party-goers. Wasn't the BEST thing I've ever baked, but 1000% worth the effort to see everyone's delight when told that No, there's no gluten/nuts/eggs/etc in there, so you can eat it.
Which is the better method for making marshmallows using egg whites or without egg whites?
I understand how weird this is going to sound, but I'm gonna say it anyway.\nWatching Ben roll that pastry was like, oddly sexual? Just me? 🤷
Looks a bit like it's filled with cold pork gravy... So my challenge for you is this: Make a savory pork swiss roll with gravy!
I'm proud of you lads for making it to Trending with just a midweek recipe
Looking good, Mike! Lots of jaw line definition!
Drink week!!!
No No NO NO NO NO

does adding egg not make it dairy.......
*instructions unclear, got penis stuck in swiss roll*
REPENT AND ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR!!! Jesus died for you knowing that you may never love him back. He shed his blood and sacrificied his life so we can be in heaven with him and the Lord! Turn away from your wicked ways and accept Jesus Christ as your SAVIOR!!! HE IS COMING AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND OR GO TO HELL. WOE ONTO YOU!!
Eggs are dairy...
Wowzer.. so trendy.. \n\n..\n\n-_-

A$ap beats are worth living for
Thank you, Sufjan, for making my day so much better!
This dude is  unbelievable.
I cry, but smile, but also cry and smile to Surfman's music like a little bitch.\nHold me.
Carrie & Lowell Part 2: Electric Boogaloo
Like a continuation of Carrie and Lowell with added brass and strings... And the lyrics too, just wow
The brass and strings in this song sound similar to those in some parts planetarium
this is literally just a sonic fusion of age of adz and carrie and lowell lol
The Greatest Gift is Sufjan Stevens himself. An angel in our midst, singing to God for all of us.
a 10 minute edit of the outro \npls
I NEED A MYSTERY OF LOVE!!!!
Subaru Sedans is at it again.\ni can bet he is not using *A U T H E N T I C VIEWS D O T C O M* to get views \nas he is talented
I'm from Wallowa lake and the lake monster is actually a real urban myth from the Nez Perce Tribe I was told growing up:) this makes me so happy.
More of Carrie and Lowell is always welcome
Between God and mortals, there is Sufjan Stevens. Pure magic.
If his goal was to compete for the most depressing lyrics with the saddest music ever written, I think he quite easily achieved the victory. Every suggestion for a competitor is welcome
This song is intrinsic af! But you can't tell me he didn't pull from his Should've Known Better progression on the first phrasings of the first verse
Subaru Stevens back on his shit
more proof that carrie & lowell could've been his oregon album
not much moved me to tears but blue bucket of gold live.  until this... and now it all makes me cry.  in a good way\n...I think.  well it's beautiful isn't it.
On National Coming Out Day no less
this album is gonna be the gayest ever i can feel it
2:13 I melt
Gawd I love him
There are sad days, and there are days Suf releases new music. These days are also sad, but in a good way. Thank you, Sadjan Stevens.
The 3-minute outro is bringing me to fucking tears. Greatest artist alive, without a doubt.
Sufjan Stevens is online
I was just at Wallowa Lake last weekend! Beautiful place.
Woah... Haven't gotten these Age of Adz vibes in a long time... But seamlessly blended with with Carrie and Lowell magic.
Yo this is depressing as shit.
Sufjan, it's hard to tell if you're a better poet or a musician. Absolutely incomparable genius
omg this was exactly what I needed, bless u Sufjan
what a beautiful slow drift of an ending
This is what genius sounds like.
First 10 seconds sound a lot like Everybody Wants To Rule The World
Heard this yesterday, for the first time. Thanks Gorilla vs. Bear! So beautiful!
Sounds like something exactly between C&L and Planetarium. Bless him.
the second half straight up beat me up, this is so good
I don't know how he managed to make me cry with all his songs.
Holy shit this is beautiful, can't wait!!!
I never clicked a video so fast and I was not disappointed
i thought it was mystery of love...this is better
This guy is a genius
is this a nylon banjo?
You have no idea how we've waited for this
Boy, another goosebumps attack, just like the first time I heard the entire Carrie & Lowell album :')
It's hard to believe that I've loved Sufjan for 12 years now.
Thank you thank you so much for releasing it on my birthday ❤
Man I used to swim in wallowa lake all the time as a kid.
Been a fan since time began. Keep inspiring creative genius!
This is so beautifull. Thank you, thank you !
I feel like the more Sufjan gets old, the more he makes me cry with his music genius. Sufjan is like that husband who really loves his wife as time goes by both of them. \n\nI've been following him since 2008 and I'm still in love with him until now. And I'm afraid if tomorrow I'll not see your face again.
1:54 AAAAAAAHHHHHH I LOVE YOU SUBARU
just heard this today on the radio tripped me out hard core
The lyrics of this song make me think of a family losing their mother to alcoholism. Additionally, it is sung very beautifully.
cara eu te amo demais
The beauty of this song makes up for my disappointment that the new release is not Mystery of Love
Had a crappy day. This made it better
*this is wine to my ears - both bitter and sweet at the same time*
Thank you, yet again Sufjan, for saving my life
Sufjan I would do anything for you
Surfism Stovens is the musician of the century.
Amazing!! So inspiring Suf!!!!
Think this is a B-side
more pls
Beautiful song Sufjan, thank you, thank you again
I'm ded.
Terima kasih banyak. Terima kasih.
💕
Im wet.
Sad boi hours :'(
❤️
Horribly, disgustingly prim

Maravilhosa

Beautiful, ethereal. Takes me to heavens.
HOLY FUCK WHAT??
‘Trending’
beauuuuutiful!
Thank you
I fucking love you Sufjan❤❤
ty daddy
[muffled screams in the background]
Exquisite Sufjan. I love you.
Our boy got #20 on trending! 💪
thank you suf
this is where sufjan is at his best ... stripped back, folk-y, vulnerable. love it.
Dearest heart, you feel it rising do you not? How we love you and want you to know of our gratitude, simply for YOU Sufjan, Lowell and all in the family that is life. As an aside this notification came through while I am covered in hospital sheets. Too many hospital stays simply trying to keep death (life?) at bay... this is a gift I take with me on day 3. You lulled me to sleep last night with Carrie and Lowell and Planetarium on repeat. I am no longer afraid. I merely want release... we're all going to die. Look right into the light lovelies. It Wont.Hurt.A.Bit... Has your prayer only been LOVE? GOOD. For love is all...
this song is like half carrie and lowell, half age of adz
You are the Bob Dylan of our generation.
noooo i thought this was a new album
18 days left.
In 1885, a prospector, who wished to keep his identity a secret, was about midway across the lake when he saw an animal about fifty yards to the right of his boat. The animal reared its head and neck out of the water about 10 feet, paused, then quickly dove back into the water.
ONLY. TWO. WEEKS.
Oh shit watching these demo speedruns are my new favorite thing now
You can hit the bombs back at the Broodal when she's dropping bombs everywhere. It won't knock her hat off but it will end the phase sooner.
Jesus, the game isn't even released yet.
They should just give you a free copy
Well done... can't imagine what you'll accomplish with the final game.
I can tell this was at target from the walkie noise
You wasted so much time waiting for the Broodal to finish her UFO phase. If you throw Cappy at one of the bombs she drops, it will hit her and knock her out of the sky, ending the phase like 5 seconds earlier.
Awesome speed run! The hat throw is going to be really broken!
I love learning how to master how Mario controls in 3D Mario games and watching this speedrun only made me more excited to play Odyssey.
Okay then, the movement in this game looks super cool.
The speed-running potential for this game is insane and it’s not even out yet
Holy shit\nThere is already a speed run of this game
This was from the Gamecity in Vienna right?
He was born here
Make an eshop demo Nintendo!
Wow how often did you play this demo?
SO. FUCKING. EXCITED. I mean fire emblem warriors will be good n all. but odyssey is where it's at
THANKYOU for this content! good movement was all I wanted to see but it's nowhere
There are no bad points in this game now!
This is giving the game some really good publicity
I think ground pounding on her head would've wrap the broodal fight up in just two hits.
So far the game isnt out and I can see the speedrunning possiblities are going to be amazing THUMBS UP!!
Dang the game isn’t even out and yet people are already speed running it.
Idk if this is true but I noticed that when you get close to her she’ll back up then attack a lot faster than just waiting for to attack
I can already see this will be great for speedrunning from this alone
But first we need to talk about parallel universes.
Ohhh god, I actually can’t wait for this game to come out just for the speed runs
Speedrun of demo...
Nice run dude! Looks like the rolling is super efficient as I've thought!
And 3:29 SUPER MARIO GALAXY RETURNS
this game is going to be so awesome to speedrun, especially 100% run
When you hang out all day at Circuit City playing the demos.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4OYXpKxHT4&t=7m52s here is the bomb reflect people are talking about.
I hope speedruns like this stay a thing when the game comes out. 10 min challenges and what not. It'd be fun to watch lol
Basically it's Mario spindashing at sanic speed.
The game is not even out yet and there is a speed run of it XD
I hope this starts a trend.
Holy fuck you are a psycho at this props to u
Damn dude. Great job! Where did u do this?
wow fast make new video
ROLLING AROUND AT THE SPEED OF WAHOO.
i love how mario is sonic now
Rolling around at the speed of sound. Oh wait wrong series...
i subscribed & i turned on the notification bell on, when you buy the game when it comes out speedrun it, your gameplay was smart af.
america is so lucky damn
lmao
guiijiii!
Amazing speedrun!
Holy fuck you’re really good!
When you're an expert at a game that hasn't even come out yet.
My target had the demo, and when I started it, the TV was at like max volume or something. Mario yelled “SUPA MARIO ODISEE” on it, and everyone within 30 feet of me stopped and stared at me
In Super Mario 64 we had long jump spamming. In Super Mario Sunshine we had dive spamming. Now in Super Mario Odyssey we have rolling spamming. History repeats itself.
My target has no demo ;(
Kool
What?!
Dude\n\nWhat the fuck
Nice run mate
3:35 THAT MOVEMENT THO
0:21 Mario jumping Trump's wall.
daaaaamn man. Nice!
Awesome!
0:04 sanic gotta go fast
Nice
you odyssey this game its amazing
Why do  you Always throw cappy before a Dive  even  when you are not Diving into cappy?
These speed runs make this feel like a true successor to super Mario 64. \nI'm sure some would prefer Galaxy or Sunshine, but this takes the cake.
What buttons do you press to do the rolling move??\n\nAlso what buttons allow you to get back to your hat once you have thrown it?
This is so damn absurd and I love it. This game is gonna make my year.
How do you get the demo
How do you get this demo?
Not fair! The demo at my target ended at 2:25
And how did you get the demo?
Great.\nNow do it in 0.5 a presses.
Why can't they have a demo on the switch?? Not in target or Best Buy of Walmart or anything...
Imagine the poor souls waiting their turns in line behind this guy
These demos being speedrunned only makes me realise that if the 3D mario game after Odyssey DOES NOT HAVE a cappy equivalent (in terms of jumping toolset), the game will be automatically inferior.
this is a record that cannot be broken after the demo stands are beeing removed, you set an unbeatable world record! :D good job
Lowkey, when I saw the cover I thought it was Sandra Bullock and I almost cried bc I love Sandra Bullock more than life.
How You Make A Skull Look Sexy & Colorful 😩🔥🔥🔥
You need to start a face chart series where you do a series of a bunch of face charts you like ❤️❤️😭😭😍😍 love you girl
The coverfx drops don' t play well with any makeup underneath.

Great work! Funny how you look like you have a permanent frown 😅

U look like Kim K with that blonde hair! 😳 Love this Katy!!! 😍😍😍
❤️💖
I love when you do colorful and creative looks! They just look sooo bomb on you. 🙌🏽💕💜Like your face charts omg I dieeee, keep it coming @Katy! 💗💖
What you said was holo was NOT holo smfh
Do any of you ladies know when the restock of the DesixKaty collection is ??😭😭
I love how people talk shit and then say “no shade”. Excuse me but you’re just being a bitch NO SHADE gtfo
I loveee itt ❣️❣️
Ok I love this n all, but is it weird that I like you and Desi's hands? Like weirdest comment ever js tho🤣🤣 like the hands have posture haha

Am I the only one that think she looks like Kim kardashian???
Dam! I feel so inspired now! Thanks Katy!
I thought to myself I can do this, lets check the video out.  After watching a bit,  I would definitely never ever be able to do this. Very cool!
Love it purple is my fav!! 💜
You look like Kim Kardashian in the thumbnail.
I love it, but I really love the eyes. I'm going to wear the eyes as an everyday look lol
Can't wait to recreate this 😘😘😘
You should have done your neck as well! 😊
I think this look would have looked a bit better if the contour section were a bit more anatomically correct.  You put too much of the pink on your cheecks when it should have been lighter in the front and darker(more pink) towards the hollows. Overall you did a great job Katy. Practice makes perfect.
I love the eye makeup so fucking much
Barbie 💕💜💕💀 I love this
GIRL!!...IF YOU DONT BRING BACK THE MALFOY HAIR!!!😤
How is this video advertiser friendly? I thought your immense beauty would trigger some kind of a red flag.💕
Living, breathing, dying for this look yassss

You look like Kim Kardashian in the thumbnail.
I love your Halloween looks keep them coming.👌🏼👌🏼😘

It's hilarious that putting a skull and brow lines on your face makes you look exactly like KIM K
Girrrrrl what are you doing to us with that wig. I loved this look!! Also I just wanted you to know that every morning I look forward to your pup snaps
What? No bloopers? What is life without bloopers at the end of a katy tutorial?
I miss your blondness!!! Lol and where were the bloopers?!
You look like Kim Kardashian in that wig 😍🍑
You look like Kim k in the photo. But prettier lol
Okay see I love platinum katy but I’m obsesseddd with your chocolate brown hair it’s so subtle chic I’m contemplating that color now 🤔😍
You brought me back to platinum katy😩 I miss it!
OoOoo i love this!! So easy but cool 😍💕
As soon as you said glitter highlight sparkles... I thought Lady Glitter Sparkles from Trolls. 😭

Jemma, your videos are so helpfull and Tasty 😋 💖💖
Do MACARONS! :)
Love this idea!!
These are your popsicles! ( beats the wisk ) 😂😂😂
Yummy 😋😋😋 Kisses from my channel 💕😘😘😘💕
Yogurt is gross
Hello Jemma, could you please make Raffaello cupcakes? :) x
mmm yummy! thanks for sharing the recipe, jemma! ♡
#YUM
Jemma you have nice hair
my mouth watering
this*
First
Look really good....
soo nice!!!!
I'm sorry I love Jemma but who bites and chews and ice lolly
Please show us how to make the cookies and cream oreo cake!
Do these not cristallize? Every time I try freezing yogurt, it always creates small ice crystals that make it horrible to eat. How do I avoid that?
Where can you get those icecream molds. Gotta have them.
Yuuuuummmmmmmmmyyyyyyyy
I love your shirt! It looks like vanilla cream or pudding with the seeds scattered throughout!
I love your videos. Even though summer is over it's still a good idea to make those. I have a nephew who is a year old and he is currently teething. He is in allot of pain and cold things such as ice lollies helps to sooth his gums and mouth. I might have to try your recipes for my nephew.
Thanks for the recipe. Love you jemma.I live in Thailand l like watching you make a lot of sweets.
Those look delish!  And, you really did only use 4 ingredients!  Nice job Jemma!!
RIP blueberry at 0:30
Will you be attempting chocolate macarons at some point? (Not macaroons) they are tricky to get right but I think you will get there. You could even do them as part of a cupcake or something. Like the oreo cupcakes but with chocolate macarons. Anyway, keep up the good work. The snickers brownie and Portuguese custard tarts videos are my favourites.
Yes for me it's sunny, i am living in Caribbean !!! And cold what does it mean ?? 😄, i try your loly pop tomorrow , thank you, i send you peace of SUN 🌞🌞🌞
This should not be trending
Yogurt.\nyogurt.\n_yogurt_\n*yogurt*\n\nsorry,you yog *hurt* my feelings with that spelling.
Made me cringe watching you BITE the popsicle... Besides that, thank you, I'm going to try and make this!!
thank you so much! I'm just trying to eat quite a bit healthier here in Hawaii, so it was nice to see this recipe to know that I don't necessarily have to give up a monthly dessert. Thanks again very excited to try this!
yup! it is always summer here in Singapore!
Does anyone know what the US conversions are??? TIA
How about some more/ new Halloween recipes? Are you going to have a Halloween skit this year?
Nice video I'll make those when I  have a party or friends gathering
OMG 😙😙Jemma you did amazing with the popsicle and with every dessert💓💯 I can not wait to be like you and meet you someday you 😍inspire me to do what I do best and that is to bake🎂🍦🍩
Omg these look AMAZING!! Also I really like the look of your kitchen Jemma! I have just started a baking channel myself and would love it if anyone could check it out and say hello😌
I love the way you read our minds ( e.g.  can add or less sugar, use other fruit...) you answer our questions b4 we ask them. Lol
yummm and its so hot here in south america :p
Roseburg Oregon was 45 degrees this morning it's only about 51 degrees now I'm not happy with the cold weather already LOL I miss summer went warmer fall weather
Cupcake jemma it's my birthday on Sunday the 15th.

Hello sweetie.  I love all your videos, and I don't comment usually because I can't eat most of what you make because I don't like the flavor of butter or sugar.  I know, I'm really weird.  Anyway, thank you for this recipe because I would have never thought to make these!
CupcakeJemma where did you get this popsickes molds. You said you bought them online could you please leave the link on your video I'll appreciate it!!! Love this recipe x

U r so sexy show us your nudes
you're sweet and a natural beauty
Can u do a shopping challenge? Like someone from the cast can pick your outfits?!
The night before the premiere I was rewatching RIVERDALE and a black kitten showed up and her tail was cut off😱and loves me which is odd because they usually like my mom and she also LOVES RIVERDALE as soon as she heard it she was quiet as a mouse and she loves Cole she started rubbing the iPad when she hears his voice \nSo in honour of RIVERDALE and named her River \nBut she likes everyone on the show but she tilts her head whenever she hears Casey
It would be so great if you did a video with Casey !!!
I'm vegan too and I would love to see a video with your favorite easy and quick vegan recipes or your favorite vegan food places! ❤️❤️❤️
I kinda wish all the episodes would be available but then I'd ruin it and watch the entire season in less than 2 days lol
Riverdale ad before this makes me happy
I love you so much😍 You're the best keep uploading those nice vids
PLEASE DO VLOGS OF YOU ON SET

Please do a hair video!! Like tips for getting long hair and how you maintain it!!! You have the prettiest hair ❤️
Will Polly be in season 2
Cheryl will have some love this season?????
You should do a vid where you react scenes from riverdale
did kj really break his hand 🤔 or was that just a word mistake 😂
Please do a BF tag
I would LOVE a Q&A with Lili and you ♡♡
Honestly I'm so happy at least 1 of the Riverdale cast members started a YouTube channel 😭🙌🏼
Did u actually fall through ice
Amazing first episode!! And I LOVE your videos on here!! You’re amazing, Mads!! Love you ❤️❤️❤️

IM SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU DEMI, LOVATICS WILL ALWAYS STAND BY YOUR SIDE❤
Is it going to be on red??
I fucking love u demi i have nothing but love and respect for u you are a queen @ddlovato #lovatic4life💋💯💋💖💖
i've been a fan of demi for essentially my entire life. she was one of my first albums ever bought with 'don't forget' and the only artist whose album i've made sure to buy with every release. i just turned 19 about a month ago so i've basically grown up with demi & am so excited for the documentary release. despite being a fan for almost a decade, i feel like this is going to be the first time i actually get to learn about her.
So proud of you love!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I cannot wait to see this. I really felt for her when she was going through all the rough stages of her early fame. I hated it so much when she went to rehab and disappeared but knew it was best for her. I’m so happy she’s finally at a point where she doesn’t feel like she has to rely on drugs or men to be happy
Anxiety  all. Sicknesses and diseases come from rebellion against god our. Creator which connects.  To.  A spirit. Of manipulatuon deceit and control aka witchcraft...disobedience comes from.not loving god get to kno him we all disobey ask him to.help u obey heal u noone can survive these battles on they own god helps u with it all thru jesus christ who came in the flesh it starts with prayer and asking him to.lead u to the truth show u.his luv for u.protect u.guide u bk to.the garden of eden that heals u...only.the spirit.of god n his power rebuke demons but they came for a reason and thats what we have to.learn from see sin activates curses exodus 20 is what protects us from allllll evil read Deuteronomy 28 and obedience activates curses this is the way God  set it.up he knew we will mess up.so he sent his son the churches dont teach this cause god aint in.it acts 17:25 the church is in us...the spirit of god is the church ...dont leave this word without getting to kno him stay woke boo
I LOVE DEMI LAVATO AND JUST THINK OF EVERYONE SHE WILL HELP WITH HER STORY.LOVE YOU SANDRA WETZEL COLLINS YOU GO BEAUTIFUL.
When does this movie hit theaters?? Like dang! 😍\n\n(Yes, I know it's not going to be in theaters but it needs to be! ❤️👏🏼)

They playing
Dwayne Johnson it's about time you addressed his black ass. Not only does his independent music sound like shit but he looks like a big black piece of long shit while he's dissing black  women and going on his senseless rants that nobody cares about. Thank you Dwayne  we know he's not worth your time but that's what he wanted  your time since he's not working  that's all he has is time. Keep winning Mr.Johnson
This is an old video and The Rock was joking.
Now I know he is mad but that album was good. He is just being mean I hate to see these two brothas at each other's throats like this.
This is an old video. He was only joking. Tyrese is a cry baby and a diva.
Lmfao damn he's childish and not the mother fucker at the end😂😂
If my love for The Rock was slowly fading. The love has been restored after watching this. Shout out to The Rock boo!
To fucking funny mr. Johnson is hilarious
Thanks Dwayne. All he does is diss black women. Fuck this nigga. Black as his black ass IS. He got some fucking nerve.
The rock is the king of petty y'all must not have seen WWF LOL
This guys supposed to be rich, yet he lives in a trailer??
Guys I just looked up that album it came out 2 years ago apparently.
Tyrese is a cry baby bitch
It's all for publicity
Y'all messy... This is old
What in the actual fuck is happening
Dwayne is over rated. Fuck you dwayne
THAT ALBUM IS FROM 2015 WTF IS THIS????????????
DAM ROCK YOU WENT IN LIKE  THE BAD MF YOU ARE👍👍👍👍
Don't fuck with the rock t u not ready.
Even if this was a joke.  We all know any album tyrone puts out is donkey shit
He needs to get his motherfucker lessons from the boondocks asap😂😂
CAN U, SMELLLLLLLLL WHAT TYRESE IS, COOKINGGGG??  A BIGG PEACE OF BLACK SOFT DOGGSHITT!!!
This was almost 4 years ago in 2015 when they were cool. I'm sure he was joking lol
I'm just a little disappointed that it wasn't ended with a if you smell what The Rock is cookin
The Rock is in WWF promo mode right now. Tyrese you not fucking with this lol
Reminds me of his wrestling days. Don't come for The Rock unless he sends for you! Guess Tyrese just got the smack down! 😂😂😂
I ain't even hating or anything but I just hear it right now and I agree with Dwayne😂😂😂
Fuck black roses go up my ass
Where is his beard
DO YOU SMELL WHAT THE ROCK JUST COOKED? \n\n\n\n\n\nYep its called Tyrese on a platter with a black Rose 😂🤣😂🤣😂 \nTyrese gon leave ppl tf alone.
Cryrese messing with the Rock's $. He's gonna get his ##Candyass beat. 😂😂 Y'all wrong for putting this OLD video out to be taken out of context.
The only really good song is addict I'll admit but the rest was garbage besides 2 or 3 more songs
The album is typical black homeless crackhead singing 🎤 in a ⛺️
Lol. He has a point. I only liked one song.
Lol the Rock gave him the people's mouth lol get his @$$
You can’t disrespect someone from the attitude era bitch ! The great one is still great.
EXCUSE ME Rocks wife, I must say u have 1 fine Ass Husband.   Get that show on tv as quick as possible so ur fans can watch u weekly.  Keep pumping that Iron cause that body is the Rock! Cute face ball head makes u hotter!   I hope u have Luv scenes!
Tyrees, need to stop you seriously got issues. Start to believe the story about you abusing your daughter. You and Rock was cool and then you going to start shit because, of a movie, stop the bullshit life is to short for nonsense✌🏾😜
This video is old. Rock was being funny. And was helping Tyrese promote the album. Rock is a lot bigger now. And has a grey beard. Y’all will believe anything.
Smh I like them both but this is really old and he was joking around with tyrese. Rock was filming one of the ff movies as well as filming for the show ballers. It pays to do research y'all. Ppl have to learn to stop burning bridges when your angry with a close buddy.  Idk either one personally but Tyrese went to find this video at great lengths to make it seem like the rock is a horrible guy. Makes you wonder what does this say about Tyrese's character though.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
🔫🔫🔫🔫😂😂😂😂
😂🤣💯
LMAO. I love Dwayne
I love him
😂
SHOOT

Yah it price of shit
😂😂😂😂😂💀
Just beat his ass rock.  Fuck cryrees. AnD Kevin  hart to i hate that bitch bonus punch please 2 for one slap him back on the bus singing for a Pepsi
This was a joke. Dwayne was filming FF and Ballers at the same time so he was in character.  Cryrese posted it and was laughing a few years ago, and now he tries to flip it and make it seem like Dwayne did this in to be mean.
Damn lol Tyrese brought out the old school Rock 😂😂😂
Go in ROCK YESSSSS THE OL ROCK BACK
Hee! Hee! I don't know if Rock is joking or what but this was funny.
Dwayne went OFF!
Yall. Live talking to me bitches eats this pussy
Everybody know the rock has a beard now lol clearly old when tyrese released black rose witch was last year
Well damn. I bought it last year, got some cute songs but nothing to go crazy over. Aint trash at all.
This has to be a publicity stunt right? Lol like wtf
Was that a joke or what. I really thought they was finished with the B'S Rock and if don't like the guy why did u listen to the album anyway. SMH grown men
Didn't black rose come out a while ago?
😳

Yo this fucker is late as hell.. that album is old news and it's not even that bad.. what is his purpose with this
Liberals still crying.
Hey Jimmy, you are the mentally sick weirdo who put a lot of young women 18s to touch your pants in the street and infront of your cameras expecting all of your viewers to like that..psycho....
Just from his repeatitive speech skit, it's obvious he's just full of cliche business slogans and has no original independant thoughts in that empty head of his lol
Seems Jimmy here forgot about his time on the man show parading around teens in miniskirts jumping on trampolines.
This was so funny!
As soon as late night stops bashing Trump, I'll find something else to watch. I can't get enough of Dumbass Donald jokes.\nKeep it up Jimmy. You've never been better.
Did you think we forgot about your Guess What's In My Pants Game, Jimmy Kimmel?  Your hypocrisy is stunning.  Hollywood is about one second away from imploding.  Do you ever examine your heart?
Wake up call everyone.  This is not how a President—who is a role model (!) should act!  There should not be just one finger on the nuclear button!  I find Kimmel refreshing.  This crazy behaviour of Trump's is dangerous.  There is a group of psychiatric professionals that are starting a dialogue with members of Congress called, The Duty to Warn. They believe that Trump is dangerous to the public and as mental health professionals they have a “duty to warn” the public about what they see as Trump’s narcissism, impulsivity, poor attention span, paranoia, and other traits that, they believe, impair his ability to lead.
I'm so glad Trump is Jimmy Kimmel's president ! Hahahahahaha  The more the media and hollywood hate Trump the happier I am. Go Trump !
Jimminy hypocrite.
Jimmy Kimmel won't touch the Harvey Weinstein story because he's not the moral conscience of America.  Right Jimmy, you're not.  America finds your ilk repulsive.  You defend sexual predators and you are a sexual predator.

war between lilliput people...whether great man (gulliver) interferes again?
This show is terrible...they all are now.
RememberJimmy did bit and had 18 yr old girl grab and guess what's in his crotch??!! It's a famous segment he did on his show which is on YouTube. 
He doesn't get flu shots. Come on.
Where are your weinstein jokes...so sad what you became.
Jimmy Kimmel was happy to get buggered by Weinstein several times to get his job..TRUE FACT..at least i think so
Any Canadians here just for the drama
Keep forging those tweets and you will be in jail for fraud...
I salute you!  God Bless you and your family!
What's most disturbing, is that Trump jr seems to have no idea that what his dad is doing, is so:  1. Stupid, and 2. Horrible for the vast majority of Americans. Or, he's just lying. Either way, he's a terrible person.
Jimmy don't start a fight, you'll end up crying again.
The Donald Trump criticism show with jimmy kimmel sucks
The what’s in your pants bit you did is leaps and bounds worse than anything that can be proven against Trump but keep trying to preach to us idiot
Jr. was defending his dad....understandable....Kimmel come on slamming a kid...that is a new low....he s a teen besides Trump didn't look great at his last signing of the Healthcare Executive Order....possible heart failure on the horizon from so much stress...I don't like him as President either but pushing a man into heart failure whom you know is extremely stressed about his image and his accomplishments is just mean along with tweeting his father s mistakes politicially....he is not his father nor shown signs yet of his father s actions and if anything children learn from their father s mistakes as well as do better in life....we are all an example of how to live or not to live....don't beat up on a child whose not responsible for his father s actions...DJ Junior is responsible for his own actions NOT his father s...really disappointed....the visciousness still going on when the decision has been made for Presidency....and I ve made mean comments but beating up on the child on social media...wow that is low.
They really need to suspend Trump from using Twitter. He needs to worry about his country. Like God, Obama was so much better :/
And now Kimmel is on tape having young women feel around his groin area and asking them to put whatever is in there in their mouth.
fun fact: Jimmy sold his soul to satanic Hollywood, the night he succumbed to wearing a tie.
Hey Kimmel how come you don't ever start your'e monolog  without a Trump bashing .... why don't you start one with the sexual tyrants in your'e own Hollywood elite liberal community don't you think you should or do you have something to hide also? tabout Harvey Weinstein or the alleged allegations  about Oliver Stone WHY IS THAT?????
Jimmy is killing it these days.
I love when he uses most people don't even know when it comes to common knowledge, like Lincoln being a Republican,and countless others!
what a whiner.  go home
we don't believe you Mr =======
Here’s How Trump Has Silently Gutted Obama’s Legacy\nPosted By Robert Donachie On 11:30 AM 10/13/2017\n\nPresident Donald Trump has surgically dismantled Obamacare over the course of his first year in office, largely under the noses of the American public, Democrats and members of his party that have spent the last nine months trying to upend the American health care system.\n\nOver the course of his first nine months in office, he rolled back funding for a program intended to help individuals navigate the insurance marketplace, signed an executive order to allow for groups to purchase insurance across state lines and stopped federal funding for Obamacare subsidies.\n\nTaken in tandem, it appears the administration is working to overhaul the American health care system without the help of Congress, a body that has failed a handful of times to repeal and replace Obamacare during the first months of Trump’s presidency.\n\nEach of these actions has a significant impact on the viability of the current health care system.\n\nObamacare Subsidies\n\nThe Trump administration announced late Thursday evening that it will no longer fund a crucial feature of Obamacare that helps low-income Americans purchase health insurance on the Affordable Care Act state exchanges, known as cost-sharing reductions.\n\n“The bailout of insurance companies through these unlawful payments is yet another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system,” the White House said in a statement. “Congress needs to repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law and provide real relief to the American people.”\n\nUnder the leadership of former Speaker John Boehner, the House filed suit against the Obama administration in 2014, claiming it was illegally reimbursing marketplace insurers for CSRs.\n\nObamacare subsidies were instituted to help low and moderate income individuals who participate in the exchanges. To make consumers put more “skin in the game,” Obamacare effectively raised deductibles to levels that are tough for many Americans to meet without some financial support. CSRs were put in place to help compensate insurance companies for coinsurance, co-pays and deductibles that low-income consumers could not otherwise pay out on their own.\n\nBoehner, along with House leadership, felt that CSRs required an annual appropriation approved by Congress. The House argued that because Congress had never explicitly appropriated the funds for those payments, the administration’s actions were unconstitutional. After nearly two years of deliberation, Senior Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Rosemary M. Collyer concluded the House’s claim had legal standing and allowed the case move forward on May 12, 2016.\n\nOver the course of the past 16 months, the Obama and Trump administrations have kicked the court hearing back. For those that side with Republicans, a troubling result of the appeal and numerous delays is that CSRs are still funded as they were when the Obama administration first appealed. Trump’s move Thursday essentially ends the debate, unless Congress chooses to act.\n\nOne of the glaring problems with abruptly stopping CSR payments is that it will likely lead to skyrocketing premiums for Obamacare enrollees. Roughly half of the consumers who purchase health insurance through Obamacare qualify for cost-sharing reductions\n\nConsumers are already facing double-digit premiums under Obamacare, but stopping the subsidies for insurance companies means the costs that insurers are not getting covered from the government will get transferred to the consumer.\n\nWhen insurance providers signaled they would drop out of the Obamacare market altogether in 2017, one of their primary concerns was whether or not Trump would continue paying out these subsidies.\n\nThe federal government was slated to pay out around $7 billion in CSRs in 2017. Obamacare consumers saw their out-of-pocket costs lower by over $1,000 through these subsidies.\n\nCongress could still act on the 2014 lawsuit and stymie Trump’s move. If they do not, Obamacare customers are likely to see their premiums and out-of-pocket costs soar in the future.\n\nObamacare Navigator Funding\n\nThe Trump administration has argued that many of the Obamacare programs are merely a superluous use of time and resources, including the navigator program. As such, the administration announced in September that it would cut some of the navigator program’s funding by as much as 90 percent.\n\nObamacare navigators are individuals that help consumers and businesses seek and obtain health insurance plans that meet their specific needs. They also provide outreach and educational assistance surrounding the health care marketplace.\n\nOver 70% of regional programs and 55% of statewide navigators anticipate rolling back programs in rural areas because of the administration’s funding cuts, Kaiser Family Foundation reports. The overwhelming majority, or 89 percent, of navigators expect having to fire staff because of the cuts.\n\nCuts to navigators are important in that the Obamacare marketplace can be difficult to navigate, even for an experienced consumer.\n\nThe majority of navigators, despite the cuts, plan on participating in the market in 2018.\n\nExecutive Order\n\nTrump signed an executive order Thursday that charged a number of federal agencies with finding ways to expand access to health insurance plans that are outside of Obamacare regulations. The order relaxes the rules and regulations surrounding association health plans — groups of small businesses (and possibly individuals) that join together to purchase insurance. The order would also allow these groups to purchase insurance across state lines.\n\n“With these actions … We are moving toward lower costs and more options in the health care market, and taking crucial steps toward saving the American people from the nightmare of Obamacare,” the president said Thursday.\n\n“This will direct [agencies] to take action to increase competition, increase choice, and increase access to lower-cost, high-quality health-care options,” Trump added. “This will cost the United States virtually nothing, and people will have great, great health care.”\n\nFollow Robert on Twitter\nSend tips to robert@dailycallernewsfoundation.org\n\nhttp://dailycaller.com/2017/10/13/heres-how-trump-has-silently-gutted-obamas-legacy/
Considering how big of a story this Harvey Weinstein thing is, Jimmy Kimmel took it very easy on him on this monologue.
Still waiting for some fake tears for the black on black murders in Chicago, Harvey's victims, etc....waiting for the Hollywood hypocrite.
Hey Jimmy you hypocrite, how was that 18 year old you had feel you up on the Man Show in 2002?
Forgot Harvey Weinstein, what about you, you creep Jimmy!?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBDYGOzViuI\n\nHey girls, feel what's in my pants, use your mouth if you want.
jimmy, I hope your kid takes its last breathe.
Jimmy 👏🏽 back was amazing!!!!! DJTJ stay in your lane.... I’m starting to believe that the stupid gene is Contagious and I guarantee it maybe “ in my DJTS voice”
Look at Jimmy getting down with all the colored people at 1:35. Lol, modern slavery at its finest.
Harvey Weinstein for 2020..he has all the qualification for it like the orange baboon.
so ScrewYouTube allows AdSense on fight videos - ok, got it
Honestly, I had no idea who Harvey Weinstein was before this.
Yet still no passionate speech about Harvey weinstein
FAKE NEWS!
And cue more trump hate. Stop it and your ratings will go up
What’s in your pants Jimmy?  You hypocrite.
I lasted 15 seconds. Which is long for me 😉
I only feel bad for donald trump jr for his name, Donald Trump, literally this explains how much ego Trump (the president) has
That I can tell you and I guarantee it are both things I say all the time... Ugh...
The only thing funny about Kimball is his Trump obsession.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ8i6EGH4FI\nSTOP BLAMING GUNS! Howard Stern DESTROYS the gun control Argument
Dotard Jr. is gonna learn to stay in a child's place after that. Lmao
What's in your pants, Jimmy?
Jimmy Kimmel, 'the conscience of America' has teenage girls grope his croutch for a seat see his show.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnGInJ5C-qI
I think next time Jimmy bashes Trump .. let Sean Hannity take the reins .. to respond. He would mop the floor with Kimmel.
Jimmy don't worry you're anniversary of that time where you had women with big breast jump up and down on a trampoline is coming up too.
That I can tell You!
Why don't Twitter BAN Trump's account? What would he do? It could be a lot of fun😜
I think jimmy is avoiding this issue as he wants people to forget about “The Man Show”, which was a sexist as you can get. I loved that show, but I don’t go around calling people mysogynists and sexual predators while ignoring the ones I support or are friends with.
Hi I am Donald trump. I know I am about to start WWIII with Korea but never fear WE GOT TRUMP CARE
Dude, Joey from friends would make a way better president than Trump :)
Hollywood is a cesspool. It is time to shut it down.
Jimmie Kimmel, the guy from the man show. That sexist show.
I love this guy! Never afraid to say what he stands for.
Anyone else see that video of Jimmy Kimmel sexually harassing women with his fame and influence?  Rub my crotch, I'm Jimmy Kimmel!  It's ok, I'm famous and stuff... another disgusting Hollywood hypocrite hack.
Ah Jimmy, the equivalent of cancer. Seems to like making fun of other people when he can't even control his own face, let alone his ego.
Amateur YouTuber starting out check out my vids!
Trump has a small vocabulary.
Kimmel: One of the most faithful butt plugs that the Luciferian globalist bankers own. So silly.
Jimmy is a savage😂
Donny Jr. is in enough trouble for being the “Fredo” of the family (this is from inside the White House), so he should keep his thumbs up his ass.
Now that's how it's done. Thanks, Jimmy!
Jimmy is going to go missing!  Don't blame the PRESIDENT!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love Jimmy Kimmel 😍💚
Love you Jimmy
lmao xD
Trump 2020
I honestly love you!
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
👏
ayy nice rape joke get clapping audience
FUK -  JIMMY
Lmao yessss jimmy you slayyyyyed it
hilarious
Why do people keep talking about right wing and left wing like they are two polar opposite things ? They are both within the same political system and support the same ideology. Yes there are differences but I don't think you should ever declare yourself loyal to one or the other. I don't see how anyone could stand by every decision without question. I agree with some republican policies and agree with democratic policies. I don't agree with every decision my closest friends make for THEMSELVES never mind a party of hundreds of people who make decisions which affect me. I also think people need to separate their personal dislike on an individual and focus on what they agree or disagree on what a party of politicians are doing: any decision trump makes needs to go through Congress. If you disagree with how the votes were collected, or the fact the previous president ran out of his allotted time or even how decisions on policies are made you have an issue with the political system- not one man. I don't like trump, but instead of criticising him for things which are not his fault, or twisting his words on things like illegal immigrants and instead making that seem like racism, when I don't think anyone should be allowed to enter a country, any country illegally, people should be focussing on what he's doing with the platform of power he holds and the policies he creates or supports, rather than bashing his appearance or something he said a million years ago. If you use petty, irrelevant things to justify your dislike or disdain for him it sounds like you cannot come up with enough legitimate reasons to support your argument. If someone is bad for a country or is abusing their power you should not need to make things up to justify your opinion.
The Trumpettes are such dorks. EVERY day they cry that Jimmy hasn't addressed Harvey Weinstein ...oblivious to the fact that he addressed at the beginning of his first show after the scandal broke
Hahahaha! TRUMP Repetitive tapes are right on point!!! Thanks Jimmy K.
How come you have armed security you hypocrite?
People actually watch cancerous shows like this and honestly wonder why our country is so divided...?
Harvey Weinstein everybody.\nHe is just the top of the ice-berg from the stinking bubble that is Hollywood. Kimmel, go after him! why are you not after him like you constatly were Trump? ohh yeah thats right! because he is a part of your bubble!! you can't handle that! again fricking hypocrites the lot of you!
Okay we get it, you hate trump, can we move on to some real comedy now?
Obsessed with Donald Trump 😂
Electric car? I guess you don't know how most electricity is made? What a virtue signalling moron. 

xV1dMqeb4_U,Well I was not prepared to cry today and yet here we are"
Can she even write a bad song? Next time I'm just hitting Like before I even listen.
Lyrics:\n\nThere's a hole in the dry wall, still not fixed. I just haven't gotten around to it and besides, I'm starting to get used to the gaps. Say wish you could find some way to live to be so hard on myself, so why is it easy for everyone else. I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow, I guess.\n\nAnd I never do it but it's not a joke. I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone. Is it real or a dream, which is worse, can you help me? I just wanted to go to sleep.\n\nWhen I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. There's no one left between myself and me.\nBut when I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights. When I turn out the lights, there's no one left between myself and me.\n\n\n\nJB's new single is amaze y'all. Enjoy it. I sure am. 😊
I'm actually gonna fly from Moscow to Paris just to see her show in November...
This album is gonna be amazing.
so keen for new album
She makes me want to be a better person
This a bop, I'm crying but this a bop
This is an entirely new level! Can't wait to hear her new album!
The tears are real son
Omg I wasn't prepared for this
And I thought I couldn't love her more
The perfect way to kick off fall is with a new Julien Baker song and a good cry. This is wonderful. <3
Entirely in love with her.
Ouch oof owie my emotions
Goosebumps. Pure art. Oct 27th please hurry.
Magical sound
Greatness.
It's Julien. Of course I'm gonna love it
Only person in my life that makes me feel something and I'm tired of feeling nothing. ♥️🏳️‍🌈
So lovely, u are are my favorit artist Julien.
No one inspires me more than Julien does. Absolutely cannot wait to see her next week.
Darn. My life’s changed forever since I found Julien, and each song touches my soul in places I didn’t know existed before... Thank you.
When you ugly cry into a pillow for a solid hour, but it’s the best part of your day
Julien, you just get me. Thank you.
This song is a masterpiece <3
Absolutely breathtaking
A new sooooong!
YES
Got to see her when she played in New Zealand! I'm hoping she tours this album here again, she's the best female artist in the world.
D A M N Jesse Cale music taste be poppin h a r d
SO glad Jesse Cale recommended this song. I'm obsessed.
Her songs would be great on Shameless
imagine a parody video that's just a cat chasing a laser
I was incredibly excited for this recording. But it would seem some studio person thought she needed her vocals layered. Please listen to the incredible live performance and stop trying to fix perfection... for fucks sake. Sorry for being a downer.
When you hear that guitar in the intro you know it's gonna be fire
Man new music everywhere (Julien Baker, The Front Bottoms, Knuckle Puck, Beck) loving fall so far
i can't wait to see her on the 28th. what an angel
i'm not cry, i'm not cry 😢😭
I hope she doesn't sprain her ankle with all that running.
I like how her latest 2 vids have just been her walking around singing
Slowly it start to sound similar...
in my Julien-trance, forever...
Y'all, I don't know if I'm emotionally prepared for this new album
There's so many reasons why it hurts to watch her perform and listen
Beautiful. A perfect song.
She is something special
well I just had 3:35 minutes of goosebumps
really wished I could have seen her open for jason isbell at the ryman the other night! she's amazing.
Beautiful song! Masterful video! Great job Julien and crew! Wish you all the best!
In portuguese, we have some expressions to descrive fellings, things, in this case music, that we fell like overwhelming. Its:«do caraças!». the music of little Julien Baker is... do caraças.
How is she running after that sprained ankle?
I'm not always like this, there's always tomorrow I guess.
The use of 35mm color film here is something from out of a dream. It’s subconscious and unreal. The shot of Julien coming out of the smoke before she starts running is my favorite.
I love her and so happy shes releasing new music.
I remember the first time I heard it live. Damn, I had goosebumps everywhere. I love that song. I love Julien. Can't wait for the new cd to come out.
Me vs Maradona vs Elvis. So much Brand New in this song. Love it
I like how the wire is not actually burning its way through the place, but is just being pulled while the end has a sparkling effect to it :D\nthis song tho <3
♡ !!
We need a song with Julien Baker and Dallas Green
Love it, love it....LOVE it!
Oh my gosh! Even the sound of her footsteps in the beginning gave me goosebumps.
My god this woman can do no wrong. Simply amazing! Whoever disliked this video; FOR SHAME MAN!!!
She's an angel sounds so beautiful Love her voice gives me goosbumps
It's in 4:3 so you sure as hell no it's artistic ;)
Pretty awesome, at the end 2017 it was a good year 😍
Recently discovered Juliens music by accident. Now I need this album
I know its not her style, but im a sucker for at 2:30 if a full band came in and just thrashed the outro
I love every new song more than the last. The only downside of an artist like Julien is that every re-listen to one of her songs will never be as good as that first emotional journey, one where you could never be  sure of what was about to hit you. It still hits you of course, but I wish I could go into every song having never listened to it before.
Woke up to a notification about this video (southern hemisphere). DAY MADE.
I just said goodbye to the plan for the day.
Julien can simply do no wrong
wow!
I would die for Julien Bakers emo ass god damnit
I rejoice!!!!!!!!!!!!
Beautiful
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
<3
</3
Your voice totally melt my heart
test in accuse rmtcbc limb pilot media weather softly beginning.

wow
beautiful song ❤️
wow.
AHHHW WOW :O
Ofuk.jpg
holy crap! Although she writes kinda sad songs they always fit for every kinda mood....
Damn this is overall boring. The music is so slow and unoriginal and the lyrics try too hard to display significance...not to mention the video is just a number of cliched scenes edited together
wtf shes a crack
The mother Fucking GOAT. Best music I've heard in the last few years.
i listen to julien when i'm having emotional breakdowns
This video was shot next to my house
what camera is used?
what if she sing with dallas green?
Creativity 10/10.
Bruh this whole album was so FIRE
mel b she's so perfect
Song at the end PLSS
Whats the song name in ending?
Tell her what i want what i villy villy want thats what i hear lmao
who gives a flying fuck what u want
Issa need to stop playing and drop some music
Aye 2 mill in 4 days! This is gonna blowup.
that woman is annoying AF
so we just gone ignore the way his toes look like?  0:50
what is the name of last music
how much y’all wanna bet that Mel B let him fuck
it was good until the auto tune at the end
I love the quincy's reference at 1:10
is just me of is this the best part of the song ziggi ziggi i fuck up my whole world
I love how his videos are always fun to watch which makes listening to the song even better somehow
Nigga really eating sticky notes like it's cereal😂😂😂
i always read you as anime ))0
Who else noticed the cute puppy and wasn't distracted by Mel B the whole time? lol
His videos are always so funny! Even tho they sometimes have dirty meaning lol!😂😂👌🏽
https://m.soundcloud.com/haubzzz/the-future-prod-ghxst I would really appreciate if you could support this up and coming artist😁
damn this beat hard as fuck
He is having the creativity of Tyler the creator
love amine but this video was trash
I love how trendy this is. Literally the sticky notes and all😂👌🏽💖
Ur visuals tho😍😍 and I love this song
Said she on a diet, said she only eat bananas....😂
So...... NO ONE IS GONNA TALK ABOUT ISSA Rae BEING HIS BAE IN THE PRISON SCENE LOL.
If Tyler the creator and Aminé don't do a song together I swear.
So pleasing to my eyes!
I liked he end, is it a song on its own?
when his foot started singing....I almost lost it 🤣🤣
Anybody else waiting for the HeebieJeebies video?!?
Aminè’s style is very similar to some korean hip hop artists like Sik-k, Jay Park and Gray, especially Sik-is new video “Iffy” and I looveee it. It’s my favorite style, and since Aminès first video he’s been my favorite artist out. Even the videography is similar to Khiphop style, so colorful and vibrant. Love love it. Love Aminè.
He’s tryanna be like Kyle oms😤
When he says bananas... Man that's good
I wish he would make a song out of the thing at the end
Im 16 and just released my first type beat on my channel. I would appreciate any constructive criticism. Eestbound ( producer of Antidote ) liked it!
aminè never come out with something that isn't a complete fucking bop
yo  the song is LIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:06 is that a man on his lap
0:26 is my favorite part of the song
YO ADAM! You riding the wave. you get it.
so she only eat bannas I died of laughter!!
when his foot had his face on it it was so disturding \n-_-
Well one day, Selena Gomez might date him!!!
i think his voice sounds like Lil wayne :)
i need a spice girl
WHAT IS UP WITH HIM AND BANANAS
this song makes me take a ruler to my bed to measure how long i sleep
Here before it blows up
Tbh i thought he was gonna be a one hit wonder. I'm so happy to see that's not true bc his music is really good and creative. I hope he has a bright future!!! Keep up the amazing work!!!
his foot can sing so good
Anime: I always eat sticky notes for breakfast. Delicious part of a balanced breakfast.
This is what we wanted from you ever since \nCaroline
Issa tho 😍
Omg i love mel b

STFU
How did he blow up\n\n\nHis music is garbage
Everybody talking about unsolved but did y'all realize this man  learned to fly by sneaking into random homes and playing simulations. He wild 😂
BuzzFeed is doing a lot of storytimes
as soon as i didn’t hear ryan’s voice i was pissed
This sounds like me. I go everywhere barefoot....I never leave prints tho (;
I thought it was big foot
WE GET IT U THOUGHT IT WAS UNSOLVED GEEZ 😂
I don't get why everyone thought this was a buzzers unsolved video. They literally tell you the series, season, & episode #
I live in mount vernon...
*why does every criminal story I hear happen in Washington state?!* I live in Washington state!
this is almost like a modern story of icarus and the sun....with the sun being his obsession/source of obsession to fly.
i did a project on this dude
That is a really cool story. I wish him the best.
Ok people put together the clues ok listen \n\nFriday \nBuzzed unsolved \n\n\n\nWhat can u infer by this \n\n\n\n\n\nYou buzzed videos only come out on Fridays I know it’s sucks
Where’s oily sheen shane 😂😂
i love all the crime videos. i just don’t get why people are complaining that this isn’t unsolved, this is a bonus for people interested in this stuff
I knew this ain't unsolved but still clicked it hoping that it might be 1% related to UNSOLVED.  The wheezes got me addicted.. Sorry not sorry. 😀 Can't wait for the new season starting today.  Shout out to Ryan and Shane,  I love you guys.
he was freed on my birthday omg
Jeez. People should really read the titles before the click on a video.
This would be a fucking great movie
Why are people butthurt about this not from Unsolved when the title clearly reads Crazy story of the Barefoot bandit? It's pretty clear that this not an Unsolved episode. Idiots.
I want a shirt with hey demons its me ya boi printed on it
Here for the unsolved comments
Stop comparing it to buzzfeed unsolved ! I actually really like this it was so positive ! You just have to watch it all the way though.
IT WAS MOSE BUT IN SOCKS
Just like I am obsessed with BuzzFeed unsolved. I come to YouTube . Refresh the application again and again everyday to watch a new video, even though I know it comes on Friday. 😂
hey that's where I live
I don't like the narrator .... His voice isn't interesting
I thought it was buzzfeed unsolved then I realized its not the day they post
Who else thought this was a surprise unsolved video?
My old co worker is currently dating this guy
Little town power electric tour wave.
I was born on March 22 too
I dont think people realize that this guy is like a modern day legend in the Bahamas XD
thank you for doing him!!! for unsolved crime,  can y'all  do Sherri Pepini?
He broke into our house and stole some food and a dirt bike which he left broken down in the woods.
Was this story supposed to have a point?
Honestly whoever is doing the voiceover, your voice is 😍😍😍😍
I clicked on this misreading it as 'bigfoot bandit' and now I'm disappointed
no crimes unless it's unsolved maybe they want to give you some crime vids bc the current unsolved season is supernatural and they're tired of y'all complaining 🙃🙃🙃
why is everyone thought this was unsolved? we all know that unsolved uploads every friday. smh
Unlike a lot of people in the comments, I like crime videos along with unsolved videos so thanks for the extra cool vid
0:14 THE PRIDE OF MOUNT VERNON
Only here for all the comments about Unsolved. Looking forward to Friday as well.
Bare foot\nB foot\nBig foot\nCase Solved\n(I know it isn't Buzzfeed Unsolved)
Ahh! I finally just shared my coming out story!!
I remember when he was running around our islands. I’m sure that bastard stole my bike 😂
This was actually an interesting video, I liked it.\nThe video and its visual reenactment was well edited, in my opinion.\n\nSure, it's not Shane and Ryan, but this channel isn't all about them, they don't have their own channel, but maybe they'll be moved to their own channel like LadyLike.\n\nBut people gotta chill, man.\n\nThe people who did this video were cool to do this. I've never heard of this story before and it's pretty bizzare and out there.
Wtf ? Y'all better stopppp, this not Shane & Ryan bye.
There's no [WHEEZE]. I'm disappointed.
Aha, you forgot something... *WHEEZE*
when it’s been over a week since the last buzzfeed unsolved and you settle for this
I remember watching a document on him like 3 years ago
Was this a class project Buzzfeed?
wow he was born on the same day I was born!well not on the same year tho
Ryan and Shane should just make their own channel . I'm sure it would take off . We need unsolved everyday not lame filler waiting for it to come out .
Guys get over it they missed an episode be happy with the free content you are getting
Why does this sound like Mr nightmare .. ?
He used to live in a half way house next to my apartments, that's where he actually ran way from, he shot our neighbors window out with a BB gun
BATHS ARE ILLEGAL OML I HAVE TO TELL THIS TO MY MOM
Can we leave the crime stories to Shane and Ryan? Please?
why does his voice sounds like Rami Malek
Come on guys, this isnt an unsolved mystery, nor does it say unsolved anywhere in the title. Obviously not going to be an episode of unsolved.
His mother lived next door to my aunt’s farm on a small island in Washington! Always signs saying do not enter, etc.
I hope he gets to fly again!!!
Was it just me or were there not enough details to make this story interesting??
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved...disappointed
pfffft, The Barefoot Bandit is nothing, have you ever ran into THE WET BANDITS??
How tF do you steal a plane
ummm,leave the crime stuff to the unsolved team
How do you fly a plane and not get caught
He was actually caught at a resort/restaurant/marina called Romora Bay in Harbour Island, Bahamas! My family used to go there all the time and the staff would wear shirts saying how they caught the Barefoot Bandit!
I don't know all the crimes he committed but I don't feel he deserved 7 years, he was underage and trying to survive.
(Wheeze)
Elementary divorce reflection tennis diabetes owe battle.
Colton is a badass
*wheeze
Wtf
Murder of Selena Quintanilla
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved XDD
Succeed emotion hope voice aim smile exist Irish knee consideration.
Not good enough for Unsolved?
Um... Ok
What???
Damn this ain’t Buzzfeed Unsolved, im sad
W H E E Z E
When a prodigy goes awry... temporarily.
Meh.
This was lame
this is weird
Buzzfeed SOLVED
I thought it said Bigfoot bandit
wtf I thought this was Buzzfeed Unsolved...
Ahhh clickbait
did someone say white privilege....
ayy thats my birthday
Fucking this isnt buzzfeed unsolved. More like buzzfeed disappointment
I read Bigfoot. I'm disappointed
I thought this was buzzfeed unsolved 😭😭😭
I thought it was unsolved, wtf
*wheeze* \n\n\n\n\nWrong video
The magic Lindsey creates is truly a sight to behold.
This was one of the only songs on Brave Enough that I really enjoyed, along with Gavi's Song and We Do We Go?. I think there's a lot of interesting things Lindsey could do with different tempos and moods that she doesn't. Most of her music ends up sounding the same, regardless of what album it's from.
I'm getting a Shakira vibe 😂
I havent listen to the song and i already like and fav the video
She is the definition of music
First 14 seconds got me up in my feelz
Me: (Sees a new Lindsey Stirling video) I click.
I love this video, you are really good
MAKE A VIDEO FOR THE PHOENIX
This is beautifully done!
Lindsey Stirling you are awesome and I think you should do a cover of something just like this by Coldplay
That violin at the is cool!
a surprising amount of negativity in these comments :0 I was thrilled by this music video, the dancing and visuals are awesome and the music is great.
Amazing! Good luck on Dancing With the Stars!
I just want a the phoenix music video :(
im dont understand this) some one have russian subtitiles?))
Wow, I've been a fan for a while, but this is like seeing Lindsey all grown up. Very polished, very artistic. Love it.
The video is amazing, but I can imagine bloopers where one of the background dancers hits someone in the face with one of the giant fans. Just me?
This was published on my bday. Thank you, Lindsey, for making my bday even awesome this year!!
Love the Indian style 🇮🇳❤️
_C H I L L S_ 😍
this changed my mood after 1:05
Um,... That was... Interesting
I think you played this song in Sao Paulo, didn't you?
Not only is this magic, but LINDSEY'S HAIR
She is so good and I LOVE  here so much , can you sing ,please
I’m liking your new hair better....even tho the other one was better...
She is so talented💗💗
Another amazing song, thank you for the inspiration!
You go girl!!!!! I'm learning the violin so one day I can be just like you
wow! respect for the dancers!
I'm in love with this 😍
*One Could Not Easily Bring Such Indian Inspired Dance Show Like LS Does.*
Please do shindler's list theme!!!
Less than a 100,000 to 10 Million Subscribers
One of my favorites that you've done!! Beautiful and invokes such imagery. :)
Amazing talent Lindsey.  Howie Mandell and Simon  Cowell need to recant when they criticized when Lindsey appeared.. She Writes and Dances, Bravo Liindsey, when are you due in AZ on tour..
i love your music and the video :D
She's made by rubber or what? *-*
Lindsey is BOSS!!! Seriously, this is so different, but it's amazing!! So epic...\nNovel Ideas are flowin' in!\n\nYou go, Lindsey! Can't wait to see you and Mark dance this week! Disney!
Wicked! The clip and the music are just gorgeous.
The Indian classical influence is strong, and astonishing unlike other songs which try to bring in elements of Indian classical and cooperate it in their songs, this sounds amazing!
I love this music
The ladies formation of a changement & pique was such a perfection. Not to mention, Lindsey's 2 graceful battement while still playing the violin was like a flower blooming; truly artistic. Keep it up, Lindsey! ;)
You truly, never cease to amaze! Keep being exactly who you are, don't change! You're videos are absolutely incredible! I love you, your music, your videos and what you stand for! You're an inspiration, to all and especially our youth! Who might I add, really needs a classy & inspiring person in the music industry and you are it!~☆~♡~☆~
Lindsey, I gotta admit. You are the one that made me start playing the violin. You are an inspiration to me. Thank you for showing me again how nice the violin is. \n\nAll the best. ❤
Love it and love you Lindsey. You are amazingly talented. And this song is beautiful and mesmerizing.
As an Indian I can tell you she captured the essence of India really well in a western tune. Love her creativity!!!
This video....I have no words for how awesome. The music and the dancing and the chanting are phenomenal
Lindsey has been my idol for as long as I could imagine, her music has made me always want to learn violin.  Her music gets better and better every year and inspires art. I will binge listen to her music quite frequently and it is satisfying to see how far she's come as years pass. She definitely has my vote!
God is REAL. He left something for Us to find on top of Our Planet. I found it several years ago and that's why I created my YouTube Channel. I'd like to invite anyone reading this, to come see what I found on Google Earth. I can prove to anyone on this Planet, that God is ABSOLUTELY REAL BEYOND ALL DOUBT. Please come see.\n *THIS IS NOT CLICK BAIT!* Several times already I've asked several different YouTube channels to come and try and debunk what I found, so far no one has. Please come see and help me *share it* with others. *There's HOPE!* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno
Blonde is not very good for U, but still amazing
Can u do hamilton???\nAnd in the video your with the hamilton cast :)
Awesome music video but was definitely not expecting the Indian influences xp Not my style but I think it grows on you after a bit
wow it was uploaded on my sister's birthday
YOU ARE A QUEEN <3
EVERYONE watch this video in 2x speed its very funny!
Мне не понравилось ранше все ок было
Everyone talking about I miss the old lindsey  I like the new lindsey ....\nI'm over here like  It's the same ole linsey with better production quality 😂😂\n\nYou the best at what you do babe💛💚! It must feel nice knowing you're the only one of your kind.
Absolutely love the Indian touch!! But i dont think anything beats crystallize! #lovefromindia
PLZ DO PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN
Did anyone else get Moulin Rouge vibes? I loved this! Great work!!

This was quite graceful.
Beautiful!
That voilin was awesome. 😮😮
Loveee youu lindseyy 😍😍😍
One of the only songs she sings at all in and it's in some foreign language... love it
Love the video and music but aren't you afraid some progressive will say this is culturally appropriating Indians of India? They will. No one is safe. So be careful in the future with the style of the videos.
Hey Lindsey, how is it going? You couldn't even decline that a Christmas album is coming out. Apart from the Indian influence, this sounds like Christmas Eve/Sarajevo (Carol of the Bell).\n\nI am happy to see your carrier going up and up, but I feel sad, because of these carrier cliches (celeb reality shows, Christmas albums, must have team-ups) I am not a fan anymore. GBY
i hope someday Lindsey goes back to the ice caves where it all started. never thought of music as fun till i saw her ;)
Lindsey, PLEASE make a collaboration with Hayley Williams! It would be so awesome!!!
I hope you and mark win the mirror ball trophy this year!!!\nLove your music! Did Mark help you with this video?
I loved your out fit, the black one in the cage the most. Where your head has a white line across. THAT OUTFIT WAS PRETTEH
I love this song and this is a amazing music video also is that Lindsey actually singing or making those sounds in the song
adam is so hot
Please make a video with Troye Sivan! Miss you too, you guys were so funny and cute together! ❤️
THE WET DREAM WAS ABOUT ROXISAUROUS

When you think Eva is innocent 😂😂😂
Hey please watch the first video i posted and subscribe. I'll subscribe back. Thank you. 😊
When is the second verse?
This is sexism and abuse of power. You should apologise to the minority of people who are insane.
What bothered me was the lipstick that was on her teeth ah haha
Ava: why do you want to do everything sexual Casper?\nCasper: Because it gets more views on YouTube\nMe: Casper you said in a previous video that you had a girlfriend!!\n\n1 like = Some help for Casper \n\n1 comment saying = Casper more Calabs  with Ava!!
He’s so tall 😍
before watching the video I thought Eva was wearing a scarf lmao
4:25 Caspar's reacting HAHAHAH😂😂
“SHE PEES ON PEOPLE!”

Did anyone else hope Caspar had a sexual dream about Joe?
Imagine what Adam was feeling though out the whole video

Eva had me dead by her reason to masterbathe btw this was taking a day before my bday
Omg this was hilarious😂😂😂 do a part 2😂😂

Have you forgotten about the dirtiest sex and dream question? And v.v. the saintest sex and dream?  ?))
U sur ur mama's watching this??? Omg
Eva is sooo shorter compared to him 😂
*”Joe would probably shoot me”*\nYES HE WOULD
The fact that Adam was here for this makes this 10 times better, yas to boys who are secure in their relationship. Other youtube boys need to take notes lmao.
I don't think I'll be able to look at Ava the same 😳...lol jk
Is he talking about zoella?
eva shuold be like one of those girls who are hot or not cause shes kinda hot and sometimes not xD
Eva is so trying too hard
Was he talking about saffron baker?
Good video like its funny & all but honestly you guys beat around answering things or don't include the answer.. I just don't get why you do videos like this when you guys avoid even answering the questions properly
Hahaha this is so Good !!!
there better be a part two
Eva finally made a video 😥
Still waiting for second verse
after watching this video, i dont think my mind is innocent anymore...
Does he know how to fake tan cuz its ovbious on his hands

Where is the second verse
This girl is an absolute hoe
Am I the only one who gets annoyed that Eva pulls her hair behind both of her ears that makes them bend and that her weave makes her hair look like an egg

Do they do diet fried chicken because he needs it...
Go to the Congo
Where's the school uniform and one glove look? I prefer it when you look like a clown. And when are you going to do something other than going to chicken and chip shops. If my son ate at chicken and chip shops like they were Michelin star joints I'd disown him.
Y he got 1 glove on like he's Michael Jackson 😂😂😂
Mirinda in a can is dead, the mirinda in a bottle with Arabic writing is piff.

Is it a problem that I already knew the lyrics to this song by heart this morning when this song wasn't even 12 hours old yet?\n\nPA-PA-PA-PASSION!!!!!!
so so good! love the message :)
THIS IS SO GOOD
Ahhhh AWOLNATION has gone and done it again!! This is insane and worth the wait, I can’t wait to hear what the album is going to sound like after hearing this masterpiece 😍😍
The outro is so friggin AWOL.  I love it.  Can't wait to someday see this song performed live!
I like it. Sounds great.
I hope this song gets on the fame and spot on the radio like sail did! I would love to see people appreciate awol more
This was a very pleasant surprise, quite refreshed I'm excited to see more :)
Hated it when I first heard it but the main verse stuck with me and now I love it!!! It's so awolnation!!!
Would love to hear an acoustic version.
I love the new song already <3
I can’t stop listening, what’s happening
Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind. Blow my mind.  Wow what a great song........
I freaking love love LOVE AWOLNATION and everything they put out
So does this mean therre will be a tour???????
When the album red bull
Nice jam.  Keep us the good work guys.
Amazing song.  Can't wait for the new album and tour.
Just googled Awolnation wondering what they up to and discovered this....GREAT!!
Seriously I've been waiting so long for this and this is everything and more I want!!!! I can't wait to see them again live!!! (I need this album like now!!)
Definitely not bad, but why do I have this feeling that any more albums won't be as good as Megalithic Symphony was?
I've been waiting a year or so for new music from my favorite band and I was not dissatisfied 😍😍😍😍😍
I appreciate them putting Irontom in this
I feel like AWOL is family. Each album has become personally synonymous with a stage of my life. Somehow, these songs make my life feel more optimistic, like there is always something to be looking forward to, even if there isn't anything in particular. I didn't know that music could be so powerful until I started listening to AWOL ten years ago.
It feels like yesterday i was waiting for Run to come out
I FUCKING LOVE THIS
AWOL knows how to take simple lyrics and pound out some really great chords. Bruno knows how to make a song just come at the audience.
i started CRYING i have been a fan for so long!
That's ju
Love it! I feel passionate about this song! :) Dying to see them live!
So good. Thanks Red Bull for continuing to give Aaron an outlet to share his musical genius with the world. Can wait to see this live.
S/O to the Irontom cameo in this video. ;)
I feel this album will take AWOL to the next level in regards to mainstream, and such. What a great song!
Cannot wait for new album :)
Here at 20k!! Absolutely love you guys! Can't wait for the new album to drop! 😭❤👏
I'm glad that awolnation still has the same kind of music and didn't change, unlike other bands (cough cough 30stm)
It sounds like gorillaz and nine inch nails had a baby, i love it
First I heard it, I was skeptical. Then listening to it a few more times, it grew on me, as it says, it blew my mind!!!!! It's fucking awesome!!!!
a great sound, spinnin' it..
Tbh kinda disappointed with this track. Loved their last album. Hope to see this new one top it.
Only here for grace
im having an eargasm right now, please make more music, never stop, you have the perfect job!
Amazing!! I can't get this song out of my head now!!!
This is an advertisement for Green Bull, no more Cannabis Hemp Energy Drink, Green Bull is what we need, hhahahahahha.
WOW! I love it!
Holy crap this is good
hey young woman in the curlers, \nsend me your email.\ny'all so fine. \nmust have been fun making/doing that.
I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS. WOW. YES. I NEEDED NEW AWOLNATION MUSIC!!!!!!!!
Love it i wish it would sond better on headphones im sure it sounds good on speakers
THANK YOU FOR RELEASING NEW MUSIC
You got a little you could use much more passion, I dig it! Can't wait for these guys to come back to Chicago again.
OH MY FUCKING GOD YESSSSSSSSSS\n\n\nI NEEDED NEW AWOLNATION I WAS GETTING SYMPTOMS OF WITHDRAWAL
I fell asleep during the live strwam
totally shocked me. Didn't expect this at all!
Legends say that this song blows your mind.
I have passion about listening to this song everyday.
Glad to have new music
I hope they blow up
Yes! Yes! Yes! God I love AWOLNATION so freaking much!
This song made me really think about myself and how i need more passion, i don't know where or how to get it but to start i will just purchase a case of Passiflora Edulis!!!
Nice To See You Back Awolnation

ADORO
Love, love, love AWOLNATION 😌😌😌
I reviewed this here- https://aerolynxmusic.blogspot.com/2017/10/passion-awolnation-review.html so good!
they struck down my video about this song... but here is the catch i posted the lyric video before they did, should i argue the copyright strike?
Typical art student recommendation - but Kanken backpacks are great!! They're designed to help with back problems that loads of schoolchildren get from having to carry a rucksack around all day
Fjällräven Kånken is a really nice backpack and it fits a computer too!
Blackery is backery!!
I have a dream that one day women will not feel inclined to apologise for underarm hair.
The Känken Fjällräven from Sweden
You ladies are lovely.  I didn't recognize Amelia at first.  :)
The Cath Kidston backpacks are really good! I take my laptop to uni everyday in it x
Loving the new style and music of the vlogs !
Nice video,you can go to https://www.ytviews.info/ to increase views,best site for views
im here for the music lol
Fjallraven Kanken backpacks are the best! Totally durable and can fit so much inside! A little bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth the investment!
Backpack recommendation - vans backpacks! Had mine for 3 years now and it fits everything i need in it :)
Timbuk2 bags are incredible. They have a lifetime guarantee and mine has lasted for at least 4 years so far. The laptop pocket is really padded and soft too! I'd definitely recommend but you have to order from America or there is a limited amount on amazon
Fjällräven Kanken backpacks are amazing!! I have one and I'm totally in love with it also they're available in different sizes!
This Mi-Pac backpack from asos is so cute, affordable, and fits my laptop and all my uni books! http://www.asos.com/mi-pac/mi-pac-canvas-fold-top-backpack-in-black/prd/6594266 xx
You're doing some really interesting editing stuff, I like it.
I love the coloured eyeliner on you Grace!
As so many other people i also recommend the Kanken by Fjäll Räven! These backpacks are amazing and there are so many beautiful colours. I currently have one but i´m thinking of getting another one because...well because you can´t have enough of them! :D btw i enjoy your volgs alot, keep them up! Also: around christmas time there might be some Lebkuchen for Amelia in the post again ;)
Kipling are good! I have a charcoal grey one that's still going strong after two years
I love the cath kidston rucksacks they are pretty, waterproof and fit a MacBook in them! What more could you need!!!
I just bought a dr martens Kiev backpack, soooo beautiful. Used to own a kanken which was really useful!
I carry my laptop in a Fjällräven Kånken, but not the specific laptop one! It's a really good size and fits my 13 MacBook air. Sounds expensive but I've been using it everyday for two years now and its still holding strong, so its a good investment!
I've watched a looooot of daily vlogers and you guys became my faves 🌹👏🌹 (ALSO HAPPY OCTOBER WHEEEET??)
there's a great German backpack company called AEVOR, they have really cool and smart designs, most of their rucksacks fit laptops and they also produce sustainably!
love the editing! especially the bit on the sofa
I'm sure Linda's camera sensor squealed with delight, seeing you. Thumbs up!
Amelia haven’t you learnt about shaving before shoots from that Matalan advert! 😂😂❤️
I have two ‘MI’ backpacks that I use for uni because I take my iPad in. It’s the bigger iPad Pro with a case on it so it’ll defiantly fit a laptop in! They’re on ASOS and aren’t expensive at all. Have lasted me well over a year now.
Seeing you every day is amazing 💕
I'm loving these daily vlogs, thank you for making them 💗💗
I have a grey Adidas back pack and it holds like 3 A4 folders it’s great X
Blackers!\n\nLove the tricky dual camera shots during the last segment!

Good Evening Grace :)
Emma!
Fjallraven Kanken bags!
Seeing the glitter brows instantly made me rub my eyebrows haha
Eastpak are good backpacks
''oh yeah really good, yeah amazing, yes''
Oh yaaasssss loving the glittery eyebrows!! ✨❤️
Hello everyone
Hi
Emma Blackery!!  This is a colab I'd never thought of!!  :D
love the glitter brows!!
I loved the music in this vlog lol x
I can tolerate hair on every part of a woman's body except on the legs.
Trespass , I have one and you can fit a lot in them and not badly priced
the ansvar 2 by melawear is pretty and practical PLUS it's fairtrade and organic!! please look it up, it looks similar to the kanken but i prefer ansvar. (maybe also look at ansvar 1? i don't have that one though)
Hey guys, since I've moved abroad to Italy you've been my go to whenever I'm feeling homesick xx
My cath kidston rucksack is great and fits my stupidly giant heavy laptop in, it's perfect!
Hello
Looooving these daily vlogs! Do y'all take submissions for music to use in them?
The North Face Borealis backpack. Perfect for laptops.\nThe favourite of italian students today.
From what I've heard is that those two volcanos are based on Isreal something or other (Brother Iz is what they call him) and his wife or girlfriend... At least in their looks.
Not the socks!!!! Can't you guys like alternate or sell us more socks???
Lava is exactly like my life except I die alone and there is no happy ending. :,(
Can’t the turtles be kuru’s (from find Nemo’s) sons (or random kid-IDK)
Love super Carlin bros but every time I hear about the stupid kid I dislike the video
Honestly I'm not really a fan of lava. Idk why. Its just.... Not my favorite
My favorite napkin story is Obi-wan writing his lightsaber plans on a napkin.
OH MY GOD I NEED TO SEE THE NEWBORN! MAKE A VLOG!
Awww can’t wait to hear more about your unborn son
What about the one with the old man anx chest
UGH i gotta follow you guys on twitter. Lifted and Bounding are some of my top two!!!!
I lava this short film.
my favourite short is the one with the old guy playing chess against himself for his own false teeth.
Commenting before watching because I agree with this title
Geri's game still is and I think always will be my favourite Pixar Short it was probably the first 1 I ever saw and has ALWAYS been stuck in my mind
OMG I DIDNT KNOW YOU GUYS WERE HAVING A BABY CONGRATS MY FRIEND!! ❤❤❤
When u said u had a very sad announcement I thought u were quitting Super Carlin Brothers or like stopping for a little bit so u could spend time with ur wife and soon to be son
OMG UR GOING TO BE A DAD!!! I’m so happy for you J!
What place did day and night come?
I know Feast isn't technically a Pixar Short but you should talk about it!
It it brings me to tears. The love and wanting to be loved hit me personally. It was how I felt until I found myLele
So I watched lava again... Not into it but probably because I can't relate.
The two volcanoes remind me of my grandparents. they got married when she was 18 and he was 21, and were together for over 60 years until she passed.
The little match girl 😭
LOL! I always have a real hoot watching your videos, though I havn't seen any in a bit, of course anything titled after LAVA would catch my attention! XD \nI Absolutely Love LAVA! I cried the first time I seen it in theaters, and then when I eventually showed it to my boyfriend (now husband), he cried too! XD so darn cewt dem volcanoes!\nAnyways we love singing it all the time, and then earlier this year when we found out we were pregnant, we knew our nursery theme INSTANTLY! Hawaiian Ocean. --But not just that! That mostly includes LAVA, Lilo & Stitch, and a little bit of Finding nemo.\nOf course we are going pretty far with a sea turtle theme now, but I am obsessed with wanting a huge picture of UKU & LELE over where the crib will be (SQUEE!) Of course I am working on that myself! But it will be so cute having those volcanoes sweetly watching over the baby!\n\nlol we are no where near even starting (nevermind completing) the baby room, but That is just my spiel on how much we loved LAVA too!!!  (Plus Uku reminds me a lot of my husband, who is a giant cuddly ball of mush XD  )
Yes Ukulele is pronounced oo-koo-le-le. And uku means lice/flea. Lele means to jump. So jumping flea. Which describes what the Hawaiian people saw when the Portuguese people brought the braguinha and played it for them. Fingers jumping around the fret board like fleas.
I'm sad that Paperman didn't make top 3, it's my personal favorite! I'm also surprised that Get a Horse! wasn't in top 3.
My friend randomly brought a ukulele to school and during lunch she played a beautiful rendition of Lava and everyone stopped to listen.
Aw man, I was expecting you to mention the Mexican volcanoes Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl, they have a legend about an Aztec princess named Iztaccíhuatl that is in love with a handsome warrior named Popocatépetl, and they swore to marry if he came back after winning the war against the Tlaxcalans. But Popocatépetl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztaccíhuatl that his fiancé had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocatépetl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:
My favourite short is day and night
You talked about your son kicking and I automatically liked the video ❤
i dont have a lava story sadly i wish i did tho
Meh. I don't think Lava is that great. Made it even worse when I saw Inside Out. The 2nd worst Disney Pixar movie! 😑
My favorite was the one about the guy in a desk job who was sad but ended up finding happiness and making friends and I just connect with it a lot.
@SuperCarlinBrothers. Ey! I think your video is cut off at the end... The vid needs some music! My songs might help youtube․com/XimerTracks
It could have been a turtle from Moana because Olaf will be in front of Coco so a mix of Disney and pixar in the shorts isnt unheard of.
Not going to lie I bawled when I watched this Short in theatres.
I've been waiting for someone who is worthy of my lava. I hope to be worthy of his lava too.....
Personally the first time I heard lava I teared up because I was lonely and wanted to meet someone and had given up because of past failures. But then I met someone later in life and now I can hardly remember being alone anymore.
Harry Potter question: We know that someone's Patronous and Anigmas animal are the same, because we were able to see McGonagall's Patronous. But if you change your Patronous, does you Anigmus change too?
piper yes it ain't any of your business.
This one is my favorite too.
If you want a place as a person... Hetalia
you should do a pixar movie tournament.
Are we not going to talk about the love of my life?! Israel “IZ” I-not-going-to-even-try-spelling-his-last-name?! He sang “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” and is the main inspiration to the song aspect of the short! He’s a large Hawaiian who looks like Uku and his wife looks exactly like Lele.
Nooo.....Partly Cloudy is the best one!
NO. BOUNDIN WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST. BOUND. BOUND. BOUND AND REBOUND.
why did you stop the socks??????so sad
Who else thought he meant last video forever!
We sang this song in my choir class
Just started watching your videos and love you guys
11 minute explanation on why a 4 minute video is the best short.
my favorite one is the one with the sheep
do like if inside out have a series
me and my partner went to see Inside Out in the cinema when we were on holiday, and even though we were the only adults there without kids I was without a doubt the first person in that screen to cry. SO MUCH! at Lava 😭 happy tears though ❤
I would have picked lift
Lava was one of the first songs I learned on ukulele, so it has a very special place in my heart ❤️ The video has very nice aesthetic appeal as well
7:22 Ugh! I love napkin stories.\n\nyEAh DoN'T yOu juSt LOvE NapKIn stORiEs?!!1??!1?\n\nI'm sorry that part was too funny for me
I love boundin its so cool
ok double the dislikes with 333 becomes 666😨😨😨😨😨😨
I disagree... I think Piper is the best short.
Enjoy Your Favorite Song >> http://bit.ly/FuLLmusIc << (FREE)
It's ook-oo-lay-lay\nNot yuke-a-laylay\n\nThere's a reason their names are pronounced that way, J.
Okay guys pleeeaase don't all shout at me but I actually didn't like Lava.. Sorry!
My Favorite short is Boundin'. I do not have a Lava story to share (but I love that short). Tournament ideas: Best Pixar movie, best Harry Potter movie/book, thins in the star wars prequels that sucks the least, best Disney song, and coolest movie character of all time.
It's pronounced Ookalaylee but it's been Americanized into Yukalaylee. So yeah, you're right to think you're pronouncing it wrong. also pronouncing ukulele in the proper way sounds like a pretty cool battle cry.
My Lava story: 1 days after meeting a, we were hanging out doing homework together outside. On my iPod, Lava began playing and I sung the chorus to which I heard another voice join me and sing the verses.He was singing with me. When it finished we both were amazed somebody knew and loved the song and it is one of the things which bought us closer together. We have been dating over 1 year now and it is one of our songs we sing together and listen to when we miss each other <3
None of these reasons are why it was the favourite.The video was pretty yet sad and the song was the sameThe end.
Bro, lava is boss. Ukuleles. Where's my bois at?
Oh God, please don't get into top 10's. Too many of those. Stay original like you always are.
Bound almost came in dead last...?! How?! There is an emotionally supportive Jackalope!
Julie Chen: But First
Anyone heard of Walk On’s?
You should do a video on how Lava in connected to Moana. If it is at all contented
Aren't they also based on a real island?\nLike, the shot of them together at the end always struck me that it must be based on a real place, probably a volcano called The Lovers or something.\nNo? Just Me? Anyone?
Ukulele is basically Hawaiian for dancing fleas. Because the first people to play them had fingers that moved so fast that they looked like, well whatever dancing fleas look like.
Actually the volcanos are most likely hot spots
LAVA IS MY FAAAVVVEEERRRIIITTTE!!!!!!
Best Tim Burton film poll
I think my sister is a valcano. \n\nSUPPER CARLEN BABBY BOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-D
100% agreed
Boundin' is my favorite....

Congratulations!
Hello, tonight I'd like to test some of our favorite and as well as some new sounds that can be triggering for you while testing my new mic set. I do need to work on some settings and get pop-filters still but overall I think these are pretty good :D What do you think? \n0-02:10 - intro and voice test\n02:19 - rolling crinkles sound\n05:55 - comb in the plastic ♥ \n09:47 - brushing of the mics\n13:27 - purple beads waterfall\n15:53 - crinkly sticky sounds\n17:47 - bumpy clicky sounds\n18:30 - shell beads high pitch clicky sounds ♥ \n19:41 - fast tapping on a smooth foam sheet ^_^ mmmm\n20:41 - light slime squishing and tapping \n21:36 - whisper test and goodbyes :) \nThank you, I hope you enjoyed it! ♥
Please do a whole video on smelling neck, the one you did at the last. That gave me such triggers. Love your videos Maria.
SO MANY TINGLES
The whispers at the beginning we're amazing. My vote is for a full whisper video with these mics
The pink comb and the brush were amazing! The comb sounds like rain on my window, and the brush sounds like a gentle breeze through the grass.
Does anybody else worry about videos shorter than 30 minutes? I always assume it's going to take at least 30-45 minutes for me to fall asleep, even when it's probably more like 10-20 minutes.
Listening on a pair of headphones of the same brand!
I love how focused you are while doing these videos . It’s as if you’re mesmerized by your own ASMR I love it .
Thank you for help to cure my insomnia! Im ur great fan from Brazil
When the pink comb shows up, that's when you know this session is getting serious.
You are the first ASMR-tist I ever listened to, and to this day are still the best. Thank you ❤️
Please make a video just whispering with the new Mics :D
Waterfall beads was fire lol. But honestly, your voice is the best trigger for me; I've fallen asleep to your voice more than I have to any object used by anyone on anyone's channel--even yours.
Thank you for these videos so people can have a way to relax and get away from the craziness in this world for a while. You are a blessing.
I love your tapping sounds♥\nPlease make more!!♥
You are the queen! You already have 1 M views on this vid. ♥️ Maria you are the best!
That pink comb is awesome I swear👌🏽 a great idea would be to do a salon role play but you’re introducing the viewers to the products you use
Ad: I just want a \nA PEICE AND QUIET WITHOUT YOU BLASTING MY EARS
This video is definitely one my favorites you've ever made, in my top 5 for sure. Loved the tapping on the purple board, and the whispered tests at the end. So many tingles! Good job as always Maria love you
These microphones are soo good! can't wait for more.
More videos with this set up please :)💕
Fantastico' Master of ASMR Ceremonies....GOd's Dream?  Even if you don't smoke maybe you need to sometimes right?\n                                                                             This ViD was asmr heaven thank yooz Maria of Gentle Nature Ale mmmm yesss..Good Stuff...Im a return customer and all ive got is these KIND of comments haaaa.......
:o the smile bag was yellow and now it's orange(⊙_⊙)(●__●)
She strangely looks like my School's principal.
*_s m i l e_*
Love the outfit!\nAnd sounds! (Mostly sounds!😊)
The waterfall beads part is amazing.
she is just stunning.. like just marry me already
Only one of my earbuds work so I can’t hear the movement around the ear, I can just hear faint whispers
Hi Maria,where is your necklace from please? The one you are wearing in this video.Also thank you for this....soo relaxing x
This makes my back feel weird...
actually like 21:25 .. The 25 seconds of neck smells are so lovely
i think this is my favourite asmr video from you yet - it's absolutely fantastic! these mics are great
First of all, love your outfit! Second I love these mics!! Please do more whispering into the mics and breathing!
i absolutely love your nails <3
WOW ! that is a sound to be proud of !
Maria, could you do a skin care routine? I love your beautiful skin so much! I think it could be a fun video. Maybe it could be a 'let me give you a facial' type of video or something. C: love your videos, amazing work as aways Maria <3
Those Waterfall beads need a video all by themselves! zzzzzzz
Can u do like a rummage through stuff video with these MICS?
If you close your eyes, you get first the impression you can imagine the space thank the sound, but you fall then in the unlimited space of the sleep.
For those of you who are sad because asmr darling beat maria in subs just think about this.... Maria has triple the views lol
Do more roleplay videos like library or doctor or something like that :)
let me borrow that top\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCF3ywukQYA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPDl2g8Upvk
The sounds in this video are so relaxing. I put on my headphones and listen to it before sleep, or even at random times, when studying, or doing work in my computer.
Your English is really good!when did you go about learning it?
Plz do a video of singing falling in love 😍 with you song of elvis
*DA COMB IS BAAAAAACKKKK >:D*\n*(Edit: I love that brush on the mic omfg)*
I just finished watching this and I can safely say she has one of the most beautiful faces I've ever seen
PLEASE, please, do more of the whispering into the ears. It feels so very orgasmic.
These mics have great sound quality. One of my favorite things is you whispering into ears close up. They also were really nice with brushing and usually mics like this have a bit of a harsh sound when brushed (at least to me), but these sounded nice and smooth.
The brushing behind the ear made me tingle so much!!!
I have been looking for an ASMR video that has the effect of someone whispering behind my head (like on the back of my neck) and this made me jump for joy because it's a step closer to that feeling
I am listening to this video with Sennheiser HD800S headphones. SO INTENSE !!!
I've already seen this three times since it has been uploaded 😅❣️
My favourite in this video was the waterfall beads xx
She is the best asmr artist I've came across! ❤️
Omg i almost fell asleep. And it IS NOT a bad thing. It was so satisfying. 😍😍😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️
you are the queen of everything this video shook me into another dimension
you're so adorable maria. never stop being you ♥
These sounds are not soothing at all in my opinion, especially the orange smile bag or whatever it was.
You look so cute i this video I love your sweater.
Your Sennheiser Microphone and my Sennheiser headphones makes a perfect combo
Thank you for doing this ❤ !And omg you are so pretty
You almost look like Amy Adams but younger and prettier 🤗
hey can we get another ASMR hair brushing video? Maybe brush your hair over your face this time?
This was amazing with my Kraken 7.1 surround sound headset
More videos with these microphones please 🙏🙏
Oh man, those waterfall beads got me good!
Maria, when you whispered up close I could feel your breath on my ear. HOW DO YOU DO THAT?! Magical! Amazing quality. x
Pure beauty. Which is the sound you create
when I feel myself getting an anxiety attack I find one of your videos and it really does help. Thank you for what you do! You have made a difference in my life! Wishing you all good things!
This is absolutely amazing! Thank you for making this :-)
Who wants a video with the smooth foam sheet? 😊
Watching this and playing cup head, such a weird rollercoaster of emotions
Omg 😴😴😴😴

Maria 'good evening'\n\nTINGLES
The pink fucking comb
Magic noiseless ASMR, listened with my QC35, so good and sootheful. Maria #1.
I LOVEEEE THIS💗💗
the tingles
1hour of pink comb
Sennheiser quality > all
Your voice is so relaxing
*SHOW BOOBS*
Queen <3

Your so awesome!!!
I like this
I hope to see the Asmr episode in standard Arabic and I am sure it will succeed asmr in the Arab world not so much and therefore you will have a great chance for success ...

I teach high school English. We are doing childhood storybook characters for our department’s Halloween costumes. I’d love to see what character you’d choose. I want it to be scary but not too gory, and I also have to talk and move a lot in it. Any ideas from anyone are greatly appreciated!! PS: I’m on a budget. Thank you!
DRINKING GAME! SHOTS EVERY TIME SHE SAYS BEE OR MAKES A BEE PUN.
My 3 year old daughter turned around just as Careless Whisper started playing and burst out laughing saying you are a silly bumblebee, and now she wants to watch all of your videos...I'm going to go with maybe when you're older as an answer.  Just know you have a very young fan.
Um.... I think your soulless ginger eyes are showing there at the end just so ya know
Going to Spirit Halloween tomorrow to get supplies to recreate this look!
You look like Regina George when shes a zombie dressed up like a bee
You are my idol
That's not Party City, it's just Mykie's closet.
You should go to a Halloween party sometime and film people's reactions
*WHEN YOU TOOK OUT THE LUBE MY BOYXBOY/YAOI OBSESSED BRAIN JUST WENT TO THAT 18+ HALF OF MY BRAIN.*
Terrifying

See although I loved the OT12 era with EXO, my boi Kris chose the wrong company, he obviously loves Hiphop, he should've gotten into YG.
Ugh now I need a China-line collab. Know it ain't possible. But I hope one day in the future.
Had no idea his English was so good
Personally, I'm quite partial to the B line.
Where are you? Miss your videos. :-(
My favourite trainline is waikanae to wellington but that's in nz so you'll have no idea 😊 my favourite author is robin hobb 100000/10 recommend if you're into fantasy
my favourite train line would be the one that goes from London to Brighton that's such a nice one the worst is great western railway fuck them
AHHH omg my new best one is the film Pan's Labyrinth. Watched it for the first time today with school for film studies A level. I have never seen a film so aesthetically wonderful whilst also so technically brilliant and narratively stunning. I personally connected with it a great deal so that helped a lot-I was in tears most of the time. I adore the fantasy aspect and the historical setting but also love the darkness of it and how it is not just a (disturbing) fairytale but also the relation of that with the context of the Spanish rebels fighting the facist group after the civil war. That description was a mess. But I just really had a lot of feelings about the film.
Came back from Amsterdam today and although not a train line, it was the bus line that our driver lovingly called the “cocaine express”. One hell of a ride.
I like London Midland, free WiFi unlike Virgin.
I do love the DLR
I think the bakerloo line is underrated
The jubilee line is my fave tube line and Japan is my favourite country ever now having visited
Try the Gentleman's Bastards series by Scott Lynch. Basically Oceans Eleven meets Assassin's Creed. Warning the series is still ongoing, only 3 books out. But its so amazing. The way he writes is basically like he's painting movie scenes and dialogue is hilarious :D
I like the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini. Extra info about it, it was originally intended to be a trilogy, but the world got so complex, along with  the characters, that it broke that oppressive system and became a four-parter. Mandatory reading for all humans who like fun and don't know everything. I love train line 2, in my city. It's the older one, and has far more interesting people on it.
Metropolitan because if you get the right train you skip some bits and get where you want to go much quicker! ;P
my favourite train line is the go transit lakeshore west line which means nothing to people that do not live in southern ontario but it is a good train trip 10/10. my favourite books include but are not limited to the night circus by erin morgenstern, she is not invisible by marcus sedgwick, and the rest of us just live here by patrick ness
I read All That She Can See by good ol carrie hope fletcher, absolutely loved it! Rewatched Black Mirror ultimate favourite and favourite film i've watched recently is probably Moana (i watched it again i love it so much). A favourite train line in wales cannot exist because Arriva are shockingly bad you wouldnt believe. I've been on the london underground once and literally can't remember any names so who knows
favourite train line is edinburgh to london kings cross, because whenever im coming to london its for something exciting - an interview, a visa appointment, a reunion with friends - london itself im not that fussed about but that train journey means im going to something not somewhere.
The Lobster is very much the same, perhaps darker, but I haven't seen the new film yet. Thanks for the vid, Dan! Oh also, the line from Providence to S. Station, Boston 😊
I recommend La Vita É Bella, if you haven't seen it, it is one of the most beautiful films in the whole entire world with comedy cleverly spread throughout... another good film is Hunt For The Wilder People, it's hilarious and you will be quoting it forever 😸
on the train to edinburgh, near the scottish border the train goes right next to the see and it always just fills me with a bit of warmth inside
Favs\nGreat British Bake Off\nEducating Greater Manchester \nRed Queen series
I have too many favorite books, but only one favorite train line. Portland Oregon Tri-Met Max Red Line.
Over summer, I went inter railing with friends. We were travelling between Vienna and Venice overnight, on a thirteen hour journey. There were three of us, along with two strangers, packed into a small cabin with three seats lining each wall. About half an hour into the journey, we discovered that each of the seats could be made to fully recline- in essence, the bum bit of the seat slid forward to allow the back bit of the seat to slide down and become horizontal. We did this with each of the seats, essentially converting the cabin into a great big mattress, the five of us lying parallel to one another trying to get some sleep.\n\nIt didn't work. I was really uncomfortable, and around 1 in the morning decided that enough was enough. I left the cabin and went and sat in the connecting bit between two carriages for a couple of hours, listening to music. Eventually, I felt just exhausted enough to maybe catch some shut eye. I snuck back to the cabin/bed, climbed over my friends, and tried to lie still, waiting for sleep to come.\n\nI managed maybe an hour of sleep, maybe a bit more. I zoned in and out of consciousness, noticing street lights dashing by in valleys far below us, and deducing that there must be so much Austrian countryside we were missing out on in the night. Sleep came and went for another couple of hours, until I came too and noticed that we were in daylight. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and looked out of the window. My gasp was loud enough to waken the cabin.\n\nWe were in the middle of a mountain range as the sun rose, and the view was unlike anything I've ever seen. It was the most spectacular assortment of mountains and trees and snow and sun. It was the type of moment you imagine in your head, an unachievable fantasy that could never actually pan out. Like a moment in a John Green novel. An instant of pure beauty. And it was real, it was tangible. I could pull the emergency stop cord and run out and be in that view (I didn't). It was one of the most magical moments I can ever remember experiencing.\n\nThat's my favourite train line.
I could honestly watch your videos all day, your voice literally soothes me and your dry sense of humour really brightens me up, thankyou so much for being such a natural creator
Ooh I like participating\n\nI haven't seen it yet but I can tell Professor Marston and the Wonder Women is soon to be a favorite. And I've been listening to The Regrettes for the past couple weeks and they're incredible and I'd highly recommend if you want some good riot grrl punk fun
I have the same mask from The Body Shop and its wonderful
Okay so most importantly, I live in Perth and my favourite train line is the Fremantle Line, also known as the Blue Line so... that's fun.\n\nFavourite movie is 'Breakfast at Tiffanies' and if you have seen the film I recommend the book, get ready for a wild ride. I personally like the movie more, you'll see why. \n\nFavourite book is trickier because it depends on mood. If you want a good YA novel I recommend 'Six of Crows' and it's sequel 'Crooked Kingdom' by Leigh Bardugo. It's a heist novel but also not a heist novel... yeah. If you want just... fantastic, 'American Gods' by Neil Gaiman (I've only read the extended edition) it's brilliant. \n\nI liked this video a lot. :)
One that had me in tears was Flight by Sherman Alexie, who's a quality author btw
i’ve been jamming nonstop to the new ballparkmusic song ’exactly how you are’ it’s so nice and it makes me feel nice
Honestly, all I've really read this year are books related to Star Wars. Would highly recommend Lost Stars by Claudia Gray.
Has to be the Transpenine express
My favourite train line is the dlr because it has the least amount of sweat in the air, and also has near to no security, so when I'm broke I can just...jump my way in... >.<
the one that goes from Lichfield to London cuz its cheap as fuck buts its like the ryanair of trains and normally you have to sit on the floor or by the shitters so thats fun but it goes to euston which is better than all the other pretentious and expensive train stations in the middle of bumfuck in London -cough- st pancras
My favorite book at the moment is ‘walking the underground overground’ which u recommend ages ago. I really enjoyed reading it and learning so much. The book doesn’t just tell you facts about the tube lines and its stations but also gives you a new perspective on how to view London and it’s hidden treasures. Living in Australia I have had the lucky opportunity to visit London and I wish I had read this book before I visited. Because instead of taking the underground to the places I wanted to visit I wish I walked around the city more and see these diamonds in the ruff. I loved London and I hope to go back one day and visit some of the places mentioned in the book. I also highly recommend the book to anyone!!!
I'm so jealous of the uk/America.... everybody is complaining about summer ending and winter starting. I'm sad because I can't remember a single day that it rained this winter. I want winter back I'm moving to the UK for 6 months
Blade Runner 2049, First sequel i've ever seen as good if not better than the First, fallout series, i love video games i love sci fi and post apocalipse YouTube, it's been a lovely few months, october i love cold months i can't stand heat. Andddd movies in general as always
My best ones this month have been The Book Thief and Rick and Morty...quite opposite tones. Says a lot about my brain atm.
my favourite train line by far is the line from bristol temple meads to reading. sometimes late but a good solid relaxing journey, often not too busy despite being over an hour, some pretty countryside to look at. 8/10\n\n\n\n\nalso wth are you doing with a hillary book dan. ew
My favourite train line is the central line, super continent to get from my house into central London. Highly recommended 8/8, 6 stars, 100% reliable
Oh my god! I didn't understand that you said 'colder months' i thought you were talking about some Game of Thrones thing called coldemonts 😂😂😂
I've seen Blade Runner 2049 at the movies the other day and it was mind blowing. I am so affected by it... IT'S SO GOOD
My favourite train line is the steam train that runs between the coastal village of Swanage and the even smaller, cobblier village of Corfe (which has an awesome castle next to it). It's all very picturesque and lovely there. Thank you for asking.
You asked for it, so here goes - my favorite train line is the regional train from Leipzig to Chemnitz (both in Germany).
Did you say favourite train line? Because in all seriousness, there's a line known as the Heart of Wales line which goes between Cardiff and Holyhead, but the only bit I've been on is (ironically) the English bit from Hereford to Shrewsbury, and it's got some darn lovely views.
I'm really enjoying bus 12 at the moment, it goes from Utrecht central station to the university and it's so so so crowded. Almost everyone hates it but I think it's so amazing, you see the most interesting people, you hear the most crazy stories and I sometimes make friends for like ten minutes and then never see them again
As I've just started my gap year of doing odd jobs and figuring out what I wanna do with life (lol) I've started compiling lists of books and films I should read and see. Top of my books list are gone girl, the handmaid's tale and the bluest eye, although I recently bought Rest In Power (a book written by Trayvon Martin's parents about his life and death) which I'm quite eager to read. I finally watched Arrival the other day an loved it and am meaning to watch Hacksaw Ridge and all Star Wars because I haven't actually watched any of them all the way through (Ik I'm sorry). Also got a tv show list and next up is Westworld...This is a real long comment I hope someone actually finds it interesting lol
I don’t have a favourite trainline... now I want one
My current favorite thing to watch (besides you and josh giving me almost daily content) is drunk disney by practical folks! It's really fun and light hearted and I'm just really enjoying the easiness of it
Favourite thing at the moment is King Arthur. That movie was incredible; I was thinking about it for days after seeing at the cinemas and once I'm done planning the blocking for the play I'm directing (send help, please) I'm going to reward myself by getting it on dvd.\nFavourite train line is the airport line (usually not going to the airport when I use it though - usually going to concerts at the Opera House!). Much nicer than the train line that's actually the closest to my house.
I LOVE that mask! Wish I could use the others but I'm allergic :( instead I use Lush masks instead
If you're a hygge fan 100% come to Denmark - I thought the whole hygge craze in the UK was just capitalism capitalising on some random concept that doesn't really exist but Danish people LOVE hygge and are always trying to make situations more hygge. For example, in the University of Copenhagen Library there are free blankets you can borrow to wrap yourself in while you do your work! It's the best, Denmark is a cool place.
House Of Cards mate. That is the current favourite. What a show. Also What Happened was great, but made me extremely angry and upset all over again. I JUST WANTED HER TO WIN OKAY (still not over it)...
If you haven't seen/read it I would recommend The Handmaids Tale in both book and TV form
My favourite train line is the Joondalup line but that would mean nothing to you haha A really good book I read recently is The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead.
bakerloo line forever. also i'm reading The Power by Naomi Alderman and thoroughly enjoying it
Tube line? The Victoria or the overground \n\nIf you’re not talking about London, I like the sky train in Vancouver... but I’m a bit biased. ;)
My favourite train line is the Kapiti line from Wellington Station to Waikanae
my favorite train line is either the Corona or Hargita Lines that go between Budapest and Brasov, passing through the best pockets of Transylvania and Székelyföld.
Dan, I'm sure that soup is delicious and I myself and psyched for soup season.. but frankly, and I'm sorry, it looks like you're eating a bowl of shit
When you're taking a break from studying Brecht and Mother Courage, to watch a Daniel J vid where he references BRECHT
can you please talk about what happened  when youve finished it?
right now it’s my summer doona as i’m in australia. haven’t been out of bed for a few months because depression but i love this doona.
Daniels videos always make me feel so calm and welcome and warm...omg his videos are the soup of youtube vids!
I like steam engines not because of the pollution but because of the industrial revolution occurring and inspiring creativity
if you haven't already: HIdden Figures.
my alltime favourite book is I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson and its INCREDIBLE. ive read it three times and marked my copy to hell and back. cannot recommend it enough
love the northern line.
Well the Milton line, I guess. not that Go ever gives it good service.
Eyy! I made potato and cheese soup today because it got cold enough :D I'm quite the opposite, I enjoy the cooler weather much more than the warmer months. I like the warmth, but only for a short time. I don't like being hot and sweaty :/ I like cozying up with a blanket, a book, a cup of tea or coffee, and a pet (preferably a cat). I can't wait for snow and more baking and cooking!
are you sure winter is coming?  i'm not.  you prefer the summer months?  april thru october possibly thru november possibly thru december possibly forever.  damn what ISN'T a summer month at this point?  come here, you'll have a blast at least until ya get heatstroke in the deep south united states.  this place will cook you like roast chicken.
i like london midland bc their trains are clean and well spaced out and USUALLY not too busy. also enjoying my bedding i got for uni from matalan (its sO soft) and this charcoal and bamboo face wash by t-zone (really cheap and good for oily skin, if you're a student buy it in superdrug bc they do student discount if you have unidays)
I love a good Jubilee line ngl
Genuinely spent a few minutes wondering what my favourite train line is .... tbh Hull Trains going anywhere wins because hometown pride and that
Can't believe you didn't ask about favorite soup! After that whole intro! I'll tell you anyway. I made a delightful cauliflower green curry soup last night that was very much in the spirit of hygge.
Current favorite train line: Northern, because it was basically the main one I have used this past month (ie: the only month I have ever been in London).
now i really want some tortilla soup
Slow Magic just released a new album and quite frankly *I'M OBSESSED*
I'm a pretty big fan of the Gold Coast line
my favourite book is the outsiders by s.e. hinton , and no I will not capitalize
I'm rereading The Martian cos it's so heckin good. also rewatching stranger things. I should probably try to consume new entertainment but. The Martian. so heckin good.
I rewatched Spider-man:Homecoming the other day and I had forgotten how much I love this film!
My favourites at the moment are IT, both the book and the new movie, the song Not Worth Hiding by Alex The Astronaut, Draw With Jazza, obvs Daniel J, rockstar energy drinks, and the Fremantle train line in Australia bois
Does anyone else constantly want to run their fingers thru Daniel’s hair?
Isn't hillary extremely corrupt? She constantly changes her stances e.g. gay marriage just to win votes, she's known to be in the pockets of big powerful companies?
My favourite book and movie haven't changed since I was 10 (which is Harry Potter and Nightmare Before Christmas respectively). Don't know what that says about me as a person considering at age 24 my favourite things are still the same as they were when I was 10 :/
I don't put it on my beardy bit oh Daniel, you wonderful human!
Me: what are caldamons, is that something from Game of Thrones that I forgot about? ...  Oh, wait. caldamons, warmer months, colder months, warmer months....
My favorite ones...AVATAR the last airbender because I've been binging it again and it's glorious and I've made peach cobbler, pecan cookies, and apple muffins this week. My kitchen is well stocked and I got promoted yesterday. There's a crap ton of wildfires that's making the air awful and scary (I live in Northern CA right where the fires are happening) but a lovely breeze came this afternoon and swept it all away. LIFE IS GOOD. Food is amazing. Dan Howell uploaded a fantastic video today. What more could a girl want
West Coast Main Line, closely followed by the Piccadilly line (because it goes to Cockfosters)!
~Things I Live For~
Today: Rain. Recently: Vietnamese style rice paper rolls.
Awww Daniel! Where you be?
i like trains
my favourite youtuber... is DANIEL J LAYTON! awww. *cough*putmeonthemailinglist*cough*
Dan: Whats your favourite trianline\nMe: not southern
Favorite soup: my moms potato leek soup
My favourite movie is def Stardust.
Eastmidlandstrains reppin 👌
Bakerloo, mate, every time
Favourite movie - Pride (2014) soooo good
The Settle to Carlisle railway, which crosses the amazing Ribblehead viaduct in Yorkshire, is by far my favourite train line. I don't understand how you can even compare lines like this with London Underground lines and similar metro systems - they don't fit in the same category in my mind.

A meaning to live; a meaning to die, even a meaning to stay alive. We are here to make progress in our lives and in our worlds future. We are here to live our entire life without hurting others lives. In short, live long and prosper.\n\n\n\n\n\nBTW U BETTER FEATURE THIS THIS WAS A BITCH TO WRITE

#yiaypiont there isn't one. Everyday, we wake up, go through the same routine and go home, sleep, repeat. This endless cycle of misery and sadness is all anyone has. Don't let people's lavish lifestyles fool you. The truth is, everyone, especially everyone on this website, we're  all dying inside. Some slower or faster than others. But you can't deny it. Once all the strings break as John Green puts in his book Paper Towns, where else can we go? So you see Jack, there is no point. After you're dead, no one is going to remember you. No one will care. So give up. Point? What point? Nothing we do will amount to anything in the long run. So why bother trying? \n\n\nOh by the way I'm 12

Love the eyessss❤️❤️❤️and also what is the best lash glue that won't let your falses come off because I'm finding it difficult to find the best lash glue I tried everywhere😭
You’re so laid back in this video! None of your usual slag. What’s going on!? This is a problem. q.
Maybe try blending the contour creme with the fenty beauty blender?? I have heard it's really good!!! Love you Michael!!
Have to shake the foundation well first!! Huge difference when you shake it before use
Michael you are so amazing to watch I absolutely love the looks you come up with. Keep slaying it sister your beautiful
Holy actual shit I'm actually in love with yours WHAT AHHH THIS LOOK IS AMAAAAAAAZIN qqq
did he get a nose job , looks fabulous
I was watching full monty before I watched this omg that's so weird 😂❤️❤️

The best face make up you've ever done. First I was like omg this foundation colour tho😂😂 but in the end it looked better than ever! Like literally soo beautiful 😍😍😍loved this combo (contour,Highlighting )

IN LOVE W THIS LOOK
I really wonder how talented youtubers such as yourself don't have a million subscribers. Q 💜

Complaining about the contour stick when you're sponge is still covered in the foundation. Of course it's gonna look like that
okay so imma need some rock on merch on the website as soon as possible 💁🏼💁🏼💕
You look like Ursula from The Little Mermaid
Thank you for helping me lose weight. The moment I saw your face I realized you are mentally ill and I puked my lunch.\nStop it. Get some help.
If you don't want that unicorn shimmer stick I'll take it off your hands NOTAPROBLEM 🙋‍♀️🙌
Love you so much Michael QQQQ I hope I can meet you one day 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I love you Micheal but please calm down with the lip injections, they look so uneven and balloon-like
I want the palette but I don't support mac because they test on animals! First world problems. Sooooooo pigmented
Have you lost your right earring ?
I don't understand how you can put makeup on every day for a living and still end up looking pale with ridiculous eyes or massively orange.?
Finally an honest review of Fenty beauty.
You over exaggerated just a little with the unicorn highlight stick 😂 it is honestly not that bad when applying it on customers it's best used when warming the actual product on the back of your hand and patting onto the skin instead of just wiping it onto the skin which will lift whatever is underneath it
Legit, if your ever having a bad day you, just need a little Michael fix!! You make me laugh dal 😘
OMG your makeup is so nice you look amazing year girl xxx
Love how you say rock on, just how Monique does <3

Josh, I'm honestly wondering how, at this point, you don't burst into laughter at your own jokes. Like, that in itself is impressive.

I want to win a Daniel j Layton
Love your humor. This is old school YouTube. People just having a laugh for laughter's sake.

I loved this omg

Cara's voice is good :)
I didn’t see that it said 'audio' so I kept waiting for her to move 😂😂
I'm not excited by this last material
Thanks NPR for turing me on to this amazing Artist!
Cum to think of it, she has a Jeff Beck vibe guitar tone going on. 😋
This is like two awesome songs merged into one.
Ugh, why so many dislikes.  St. Vincent is amazing and always will be.
Cara !!!
I love this so much
Sup, dudes. I am currently run a blog entitled Come and Share This Jam With Me where I share underrated and simply awesome songs that I love like Pills, and where I also discuss my delightful opinions about them. If you want to check it out follow this link: http://sharethisjam.blogspot.com/2017/10/pills-st-vincent.html or not, that's cool too
Why aren't her new music on vevo?
The childish melody on the intro and the chorus reminds me a lot of the Pokemon games on the gba
I'm not sure how many know how great Annie Clark really is, but I do, this girl is one of the greats...
time for me to see, my guitar to think
I really hated this song at first.
Brilliant. In every way.
i miss st. vincent, i miss annie clark. digital witness was certainly the harbinger for a departure, but i am afraid, in this departure, there is no lift-off. (my opinion)   2:42 is a saving return-to-form, the rest is so done, so medium. No boundaries pushed, which coming from annie clark, is what I interpret as pandering. que lastima...
AOTY
Pills pills pills and a big stiff dick pills pills pills
it's crazy that it's been 10 years since I first heard Annie. Been devoted admirer ever since. \nI don't know if anyone else hears this but this is for me is evolution of the kind of stuff Pete Townshend was writing during the Who's Sell Out & Tommy era\nI immediately heard that kind of funny-but-serious approach in the pills to... refrain, and the left-field spiritual slow jam of the ending. That's the Who, right there. I'm loving every second of it. If only John Entwistle was alive to play bass on this shit. Love you Annie 💚🎶🎸🎶💚
i love the part Cara sings
The last part sounds like a 90's song we had in Romania, i kept listening to it didn't know why it sounded so familiar. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSqILPaz1KU
https://youtu.be/eB-CTk8oimc listen my band please!
does this remind anyone else of the underpants gnomes' song from south park?
pretty good timing for this song considering that the vegas shooter took anti anxiety pills that  drove him to psychosis
I don't even know if that's a bass anymore (what year is this?), but the responsible for it knows his stuff
The first song, New York...just didn't really do it for me. I love Annie for her insanely idiosyncratic angular approach to songwriting....and that song just didn't tickle my fancy. But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\n\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.
The breakdown sounds like the Rain down... section from Paranoid Android to me... (a good thing)
the end half reminds me of Marry Me, and whatever happens before that gives me a seizure. I kinda like it. It feels like a solid blend between new and old styles. It reminds me a bit of The Apocalypse Song from Marry Me, and then Your Lips are Red, and then the hook is like a 1960's commercial jingle
Music of this woman is  absolutely Unique !!! 😍 I love it !!!! 😍
This is my happy pill!
Tasty guitar on a delicious track!  YUMMM!!!\nWhen it comes to St. Vincent, I cannot be satiated!
This song honestly not my style, too fucking weird
So far the album sounds like Annie trying so hard to avoid her feelings
This song is amazing and catchy as hell
Check out LIVINGSTON CAULFIELD - Not in love (official music video) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyKs-DJJFvY
When I saw the notification I haven't read the title 'till the middle, so when I started watching thought she's gonna move... that's how I love u =)
Sounds like a blend of songs from Panda Bear, Bowie, Queen, Sufjan Stevens, and Bjork. Loving it so far 👌
I hate pills but I like this songs.
I like how the song is kind of ambiguous about pills. The ending made me think that the problem isn't pill use -- the problem is the world
Annie's requiem for a dream
These lyrics are some Talking Heads-level stuff.
I like this.
On my zillionth listen now!
I want to hear Mindless Self Indulgence do a cover of this
I'm so freaking hyped!!!!
The beginning of the song sounds like that one Moana song tbh
I wouldn't need any pills to fuck her
Omg she is so sexy. Only girl I'd go gay for
Definitely my favorite so far from the singles released
I WANT TO MAKE SEXY TIME WITH THIS WOMAN NOW!
It kind of reminds me of Tune Yards
let alone find that kind of vocal range
I hear Pokémon\nI hear Queen\nI hear Bowie\nI hear Pink Floyd\nI hear St. Vincent !!
Wow, love the song! Check out this group Head Noise below too, pretty quirky electro-pop also :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDKts5guMOU
We Happy Few better use this song in their promo... It's literally perfect.
this sucks so bad that im' done with youtube for right now.
Hello! My name is Malik Charles and im really just tryna get support for my music! I write music about Love,pain and life..please take a listen https://youtu.be/JXZgl62f0dA
Ummmm this is so weird. It sounds like an ad St Vincent made. It is terrible and brilliant at the same time. The pills pills pills and a good stiff drink makes me nervous, but she redeems it towards the middle and the end with a classic rock structure. Maybe it'll make sense next to the other tracks.
Awesome song dead on commentary about how screwed up this society is and how we are all puppets of big Pharma.\n\nWhat one thing do all the shooters in all mass shootings have in common? They were all on multiple psychoactive prescribed drugs.
Am I the only one who hears life on mars at 2:50?
Annie, needs to do some work with Jamie Hince
i love this pic for.. reasons
Kind of Vampire Weekend 's vibe at some parts
Anyone else notice that Pink Floyd influence?
chorus is annoying, BUT DEAR GOD THAT SECOND HALF IS AMAZING! seriously that should have been the whole song. felt like modern day pink floyd
The melancholy finish is so Bowie Diamond Dogs/Low.
Not a very subtle message to this song.
I've never felt so ready for an album in my life.
Pills to follow Prof. Oak back to the lab
This song seems like to use for cheerleading or marching
me come
I hear Pokémon Red/Blue!
The outro interpolates ''Everyone You Know Will Go Away'', or the live song she played addressing mental health at David Byrne's show.\n(I am secretly SO happy for that)
I'm enjoying this new direction. It's not as heavy as the older albums. Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar. But I do understand sometimes people just don't dig something and that's fair enough. There's a beauty in difference of views and opinion.
I think we are listening an album about a beautiful talented musician girl who joined the high fashion scene and her thoughts about the things she finds ridiculous in it. Its just an idea though so we will see but It is ok beautiful girl, it is ok.. not everyone has the chance you have.. funny song though !
Why have I never fucked on purple carpet before... POWERFUL st Vincent!
St. Vincent > Queen Bee
upward arching Sphinx
Annie is spitting rhymes. Awesome!
love it
Fucking incredible
woooow
KAMASI FUCKING WASHINGTON
Annie❤
Sounds fresh AF.
yawn
Sick
Much better than Los Ageless
Brilliant
ooooh
no disappoint me ever
St.vincent feat.Cara Delevingne
Sorry but it's annoying and generic
SHe's a boring person desperately trying to be edgy and avant garde
Firm flop into pop on this album. Lalala fafafa pillspillspills. She used to rock.
Really talented pop composer though, like brilliant ear for melody and tasteful guitar, the music kicks ass. It's just like 'rage against the machine' or some other kind of immature preachy bad self-important lyricism, i can suffer through most of it.

I've really liked the way this album has sounded so far, but the social commentary has been lack luster. I definitely think you should put it in your music, but what does saying anything about plastic surgery or Fucking pills have to do? Yes there are plenty of people who take pills who don't need them, but I'm disabled and in debilitating pain and I need them to get out of bed. I need pills to wake and sleep and fucking walk AND eat because of stomach issues. Medical science has come a long way and I'm HAPPY for it. This song is catchy but the lyrics are a snooze fest. 😴😴😴😴😴😴
When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.
I admire you so much....i am 69, and been vegan for 9 months and have lost 47 pounds.  I wish i had figured out some of these things when i was your age.  You rock!
Hey try this before they are all gone! I had AMAZING success losing weight with garcinia extract. It burns fat, gives you energy and stops you from being hungry all the time. Well today is the last day they are giving away trial bottles. Grab one while you can before they are all gone here: http://www.getyourdeal.club/free/1DayGarciniaOffer
I related to this so much. Thank you for making this video 💖
Eurgh I love you. Thank you so much for you being you!! 🍄
Hey Keira ❤️ thank you so much for this video - it hit home a lot for me as I've also struggled in the past (and I continue to even now)! About your What I Eat videos... please don't listen to the negative comments. These videos actually really helped me with my journey towards veganism because I saw how realistic your diet was. It was nothing too fancy, nothing expensive... I remember watching once of your videos where you do a vegan Tesco shop and I remember thinking wow actually it looks really easy to be vegan! You just buy more vegetables!. So yeah, it made the vegan diet seem much more do-able for me and is probably one of the bigger things that helped me push forwards in the right direction with my diet/morals :) I'm super glad you are feeling better about everything and I hope you continue to feel better every day :)
What a brave thing for you to do. I really appreciate your honesty and I'm so happy to hear you're feeling so much better. My ED has the tightest hold over me. It's videos like this one that give me hope that one day, I too can be happy within. Thank You so much. Xxx
I found a lot more things that I would eat at others peoples houses too!
Going vegetarian has made me be way less of a picky eater. I am way more willing to try new foods.
thank you for this video keira, you're the best!!
Veganism changed my relationship with food too! And I'm so grateful to you for recommending the minimalist Baker as I can finally cook 😂. After hating exercise my entire life I have now joined a kickboxing gym and the impact it has had on my mental health is amazing. I feel the best I've ever felt, a workout works better than any anti depressant I've ever taken and I can't believe it!
I would have never known this side to you💭 thanks for sharing🙂 You are definitely one of the reasons why I started thinking more about vegan choices/ meals, and why I one day want to transition completely into that eating lifestyle !x
I really struggle trying to be Vegan and working full time 😔😔
Can I just say you are look absolutely stunning!!!! Thank you so much for this video. I’ve been struggling with food and my since I had my son 9 months ago, I’m vegetarian but because I’m so busy with my son and work I find it easier to just eat crap like a bag of crisps. But your video has inspired me to eat more fruit and vegetables and home cooked meals.
Your arms are huge and fingers are fat. No wonder you’re wearing black.
Aw Kiera! Thank you so much for sharing your story. Though you and I had different journeys (duhhhh different people), I feel exactly the same about veganism. It was like as soon as I started eating vegan, all the other problems I had went away. I stopped wanting to be thinner, restricting, calorie counting and just eat whatever I want, when I want. Everyone’s always saying how good I look physically, though I do regularly exercise now too. If you want any tips on how to get the ball rolling on exercising on the reg pls let me know. Sending love to you and Alex xx
Nothing better, or healthier, than a delicious, juicy sirloin steak from a 7 week+ hung side of beef.
I love your food videos ! They motivate me so much to eat better & to cook more & I love seeing meal ideas !
I ❤️ you so much Kiera ❤️❤️
What a brilliant video Kiera, huge respect for you for opening up about something so personal. I’ve had huge up and downs with food and my weight and have chronic ibs which makes things even more difficult! Have been wanting to go vegan myself for a long time but with ibs it’s extremely difficult and I haven’t found a way yet. Our relationships with food are such a complicated thing and the focus is always on weight loss above everything so thank you for talking about it from a different angle.
I too find it so hard  to motivate myself to exercise! It'd be great if you could share your journey when you get started ... it really is a mountain to climb ... Does Alex exercise? It's lovely he became vegan with you. Thank you for your videos!
I don't eat fruit. I eat pretty much all veg, but can't get over the fruit mental block :( hopefully one day
I adore you. And I love your what-i-eat-in-a-day videos so much more than most others, because they include a variety of foods of all kinds.
Thank you for producing such an honest video about food. I too had a big problem with textures of food growing up and it is nice to hear someone talking about it! I completely agree than Minamilist Baker is a life saver - has opened my eyes as well. I have only been vegan for 4 months now and have been enjoying getting to know you through your channel. It takes a lot of courage to go online and talk about these things and I really respect you for having the confidence to do so.
I didnt get my weight loss ca. 1,5 years after I went vegan. All the other people mentioned it to me and they still do. Sure, I realized I could downsize my wardrobe here and there in the sizes I needed to buy. I still don't weigh myself. That's what I stopped since I moved out from my parents house. Avery helpful video. Thank you Kiera. All the love. <3
Wow this helped me a lot and opened my eyes. I'm vegetarian and I stress over a lot and I found myself gaining weight rather then losing it. Then again my diet isn't the greatest.. but you've inspired me. I honestly always wanted to go vegan and I will get there one day but thanks for inspiring me!❤️❤️❤️
Just found you through this video loved it I wish I wash brave enough to talk about weight mental health and veganism on youtube but I love watching videos about it 💗
I think your food videos are really awesome! You show that you can eat what ever tasty food you want when you go vegan and you're not hard on your self and you show it for what it is, delicious! Anyone who's is vegan and promoting it is admirable. Not everyone needs or wants to be a health guru. You do you!! You're doing great work.
oh my god, thanks a lot for sharing.
Veganism is so beneficial in so many different ways!\n\nLoved this video <3
You look So gorgeous in this video!
Thank you for sharing this, Kiera!\n\nI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that - as you said - cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.\n\nRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy! :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you! ^^
My cat came to sit with my when I clicked on your video. Kind of sweet :)\nI (like so so so many others) have struggeled with food from a young age. I'm 29 and I'm still not OK with it, but since going vegan it's gotten better. I focus more on health than on weight and slowly but surely I think I'm actually heading somewhere :) \nThank you so much for sharing. You're such a wonderful and inspiring human being xx
Self defence classes? Hell yeah, become more like Xena!
I love this. I relate to this so much and I can say right now, my relationship with food is not the greatest. No one would even consider me fat but I was very overweight when I was younger and I still tend to feel like a little fat girl this was inspiring.
I had a very similar experience with food, I hadn't eaten onions until I was about 17 and only tried courgettes this year! I do not like a lot of food textures and I have a lot of food aversions! It was really nice listening to someone else talk about this The environment I grew up in wasn't good, and I was fed nothing but chicken nuggets and chips and other freezer food, when I moved in with my other parent at 14 it was mad, I'd never really seen fresh vegetables in my home before that and it's been such a long journey to start eating properly and enjoying food! Cooking is a big part of my life now and I also find it very therapeutic! I recently got into exercising, an I've been doing the wii fit aha, retro I know, but it's nice exercising when nobody can see you!
Thank you for this video. My eating disorder history is different but it is nice to see that you have gotten better and made progress. Seeing you talk about it and how it got easier is really encouraging.
Thank you so much for this video. I'm on my own journey to resolving my life long issues with exercise and food and it is so inspiring to see someone who has gone through simillar struggles and has come so far. No matter how many videos I watch of super healthy exercise and diet people I watch I never know where to begin but your channel actually makes it seem possible. Thank you for showing me that I'm not alone.
Ah I’m so proud of you! (And Alex!) thank you for sharing this with us 💕 you’re so amazing and definitely continue to inspire me. I’ll forever love your videos, super chill and feels like I’m hanging with my friend ❤️ (I’ve stuck around since your red hair days! And your pink/ purple fringe and blue hair days lol) so glad you’ve stuck with YouTube. Thank you 😊 much love 💕
This video made me tear up. Your story is very similar to mine, wow. I did eat more of a variety of foods at home as a child, but still did a lot of overeating. The part where you talk about being a great student but still dreading school, being very introverted, wondering why you couldn't be like the other kids, was me as well. I'm in the process of making the switch to vegetarianism right now. Two months in, and I thought it would be hard, but I've been figuring out lots of recipes that I love which makes it easier every day. ❤️ (And trying to refrain from putting cheese on EVERYTHING 😅.) Anyway, thank you for sharing your story. ❤️
Thank you for talking about it. It is really meaningful for me.
I've been subscribed to you for years now. I relate to you on so many levels. This video however just blew my mind. Our stories are so unbelievably similar. Thank you for  being brave enough to share your experiences. And thank you for normalising and demistifying veganism as much as you do. You, and your videos, are very much appreciated ❤️
you're hair looks amazing!!! it really compliments your face <3
I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already! I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too! Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself. My point being that you've done amazingly, and I can really appreciate the progress you've made
Maybe try trampolining classes for fitness? Could be really fun and a great throwback!
Thank you for making this video Keira! \n\nyour food videos have always been a big help to me, reminding me how important it is for me to be chill about food, eat that ice cream, try that fake cheese ect \nveganism has also done so so much for me in repairing my very broken relationship with food
I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :) - loved hearing of your story and experience. You show food in a very natural and easy way that I think a lot of people understand better myself included 😊
I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures. It's got so bad that me and my partners friends won't invite us out to certain restaurants because they worry I will not be able to eat anything on the menu 😞 I feel like I really need to be open minded to trying new foods especially fruit and veg. I'm really glad you did this video it made me feel like I'm not the only one who has food struggles ❤
Great video! I was also a very plain picky eater as a kid (only ate white food i.e. Chicken and potatoes) so I can relate a lot! I started being more adventurous with food (also as a result of meeting my boyfriend) and now I love trying new things my family are constantly amazed at the change 😜😜 have you tried any recipes from Monami Frost's vegan cookbook?
You look extremely beautiful always. and i think you are a great person
Thanks so much for sharing your journey with us! :) \nI felt the same when I went vegan - I lost some weight, but I gained a whole new world of delicious food, compassion, knowledge and I feel the best I've ever felt - the weight is just a thing that happened along side that!
Oh my god this video was so personal thank you for sharing 💗 your thoughts from childhood were so heartbreaking but comforting at the same time to hear someone else feel the same. I'd like to think that if our younger selves knew each other, they would have been pals 💗
Great video! It was so interesting to learn more about your lifestyle. Thanks for sharing. :)
Such a lovely and inspiring video...I can really relate to your story and struggle. Well done on getting so far! Xxx
Thank you for sharing your story. It is a brave thing to do and it's a brave thing to share what you eat to the world especially if you've struggled with food in your lifetime because people can be really brutal online. Here you are not hiding behind a veil like the people who judge you are and putting yourself out here and it's really inspiring. I love to hearing that despite the judgement you recognize your own personal achievements like eating a variety of foods. I can't tell you how much this really does help. You seem like such a sweet person and I really enjoy your videos and hope you enjoy inspiring others with what you make.
Great video Kiera! Talking about food and diet on here (especially if you're vegan) can be so nerve-wracking! I used to be a pretty picky eater myself but once I cut out meat from my diet I was sort of forced to try so many new things - most of which I really enjoyed! I follow Dana too, she's so unbelievably helpful. ohsheglows is pretty amazing too ^_^ Hope you and Alex had a lovely anniversary!
Thanks for sharing your journey! Sorry you suffered a traumatic event that affected you so adversely! Just look at how far you’ve come!! Be kind to yourself!! Love your channel!
Veganism has also changed my life! It's so lovely when things fall into place. Thanks for sharing your story. It resonated with my own story so much.
thank you for sharing your story <3\ni've also struggled with food my whole life, had anorexia as a teen, but now that i'm vegan (been vegan for 14 months) my symptoms have lessened significantly, i feel a lot less guilty about eating and have managed to maintain a healthy & stable weight - i think the knowledge that i'm making a difference by eating plant-based really helped me feel better about food\ni've also been going to therapy which has helped, and figuring out the root causes for my mental health issues has given me so many tools to improve
At 21 years old I’ve never met or even heard anyone else being so ‘fussy’ with food like me. For as long as I can remember I’ve struggled with the textures of food and in consequence have a really basic diet, also being vegetarian that doesn’t even eat fruit and veggies is practically unheard of lol. It’s so reassuring hearing that you’ve managed to overcome this your self and gives me hope for the future that I can do this myself
Awww Kiera. I still remember asking if you were vegan a long while ago and you said you weren't yet. Your journey is amazing. So many animals saved. You look so beautiful , you always have quite frankly...oh and the grown out fringe definitely becomes you! <3 from Long Beach, CA USA
Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.\n\nI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.\n\nI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. \n\nTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.\n\nI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.\n\nKeira - thank you for being so honest. You're honest and have no shame and it means that people like me can be honest too. \n\nLove you x
you look beautiful and your so brave x
You are an amazing person Kiera!!! Keep on being fab x
You are the only person that helped me stop feeling ashamed of being a size 16 because I think you are so unbelievably beautiful and it helps me think that I might be beautiful too ❤
Anyone who would dis your diet or lifestyle or tear apart your daily menu must be extremely disillusioned by something that has absolutely nothing to do with you, personally.  Every video you make is honest and non judgmental to anyone out there. Why there are people out there in the www (is that an old term?, I'm over 50 yo so sorry if I'm not up to date), who seem to seek out reasons to hurt people are doing well in their lives? Hopefully these few ( and I sincerely hope they are few) who feel they must take time out of their day to make disparaging remarks about ANY of your videos will soon realize that it's not YOU or anyone else but THEY who have a problem. Sorry to go on for so long.
so important! amazing video hun x\ni've noticed it's quite common for many people that after going vegan their relationship with food changed. \nin my case...I don't want to say that I forgot about my ED but it just....I don't know, different things started to be more important and I was just so excited about foods? With trying new things - high five. As a kiddo the only veggies I ate were chips and mushrooms. Maybe cauliflower. And now? Look at me! For dinner today I had bowl of SALAD bigger than my head :P\nI'm so happy that you're doing better and that you having back control over what's happening :*\nLots of love :*\n\nalso - vegans judging other vegans over who's more vegan - GTFO\nanimals don't care if you eat raw till 4, if you're frutarian, if you juicing all day or if you stuff your face with mac n cheese. As long as it's vegan, you're good to go!
You are #22 trending! Really interesting video I went vegan almost two years ago and it really changed the way I thought about food. Also it helped with binge eating (for me chocolate) when things aren't vegan I have absolutely no desire to eat them 👌🏽
this video was so honest and real and from the heart <3 thank you for sharing Kiera, you'll have helped so many xo
I SPY A NEW PLANT BABY!
I agree with other commentators that if you want to exercise more, then find something you LOVE! ^____^ I started hula hooping/ hoop dancing almost 2 years ago, and I love it so much because it is FUN and creative! :) And as a circus skill, anyone can learn it, all it takes is practice!  \nThank you for this video, even if if was super hard for you to do, you did a great job, and you are making me more and more interested in becoming vegan! ^____^ X
YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD
I hadn't eaten all those vegetables or really ANYTHING either until I went veg and pretty much forced myself into it
Your hair is amazing right now
I super related to the taste and texture sensitivity issue. I tell people all the time I can't eat certain foods cuz they feel off to me. Definitely agree that my partner influenced my ability to expand my tastes. Still struggling with my weight but I less overeat and more so eat poorly and lack exercise. Loved this video so much for it's honesty And realness
I'm a fussy eater as well. I also hardly eat fruit because of the textures! It's like you are describing me! I would have to try new foods at friends houses because I didn't want to be rude. I'm 28 now and I'm still fussy but my fiance (got engaged last week after being together 6 years!) has pushed me to try new things and my diet isn't amazing but I'm doing well :)\nThe way I eat fruit now is smoothies! It's the easiest way I find to do it.
Really interesting video Kiera , iv suffered from bulimia since i was 16 at 20 i went vegetarain and it really helped me to feel more comfortable with food. However i still suffer from bulimia and im struggling at the moment with over eating and i feel like im really suffering but i cant stop and i sont know what to do i need help. X
You are truly inspiring and yes! Cooking helps so much when making the transition and it's so much fun to challenge yourself with different recipes. Hot for food is another awesome blog if you haven't checked it out yet.
Just to say that you look absolutely beautiful in this video.  And now I will watch the rest 😂
*you should try proper working out*\n*i used to hate it when i started myself pretty late in life, but then i learned to love it!*\n*most things in life we don't like when we're not good at them, but no one is good at anything he has never tried*
I bloody love your what I ate videos. I think it shows what real life is like and that not everyone is a health nut. Vegan ism personally isn't for me but I think your videos also show that veganism isn't just a bunch of salads all the time. You're looking fabulous and as long as you are happy then that's brilliant 👏🏻💕
I think everyone in the comments will hate me for this but... In one of your really earlier videos I did make a comment to you about my concern that there was a lack of vegetables and fruit and now I really regret what i wrote, I wasnt trying to be rude I thought I was trying, in my weird way, to look out for you. I thought I was being helpful, but wasn't aware of the issues you faced, so I want to take this moment to apologise, I'm sorry and I really hope that I didn't offend you.
I relate to basically all of this. I’m 22 and I still can’t figure out my relationship with food. I feel like it’s never gonna get better :(
<3
❤️❤️❤️
I like food
Vegan trending? What the hell.
You're amazing💜
Love u 💓

It’s nice to see a vegan, and I know not all vegans are like this but they do exist, who doesn’t force veganism down non vegans throats because they see it as a superior way of life when they a lot of the time themselves are restricting their diets so much they have border line eating disorders that are not healthy and sustainable in the long run. She just seems to natural and real like a normal vegan with a diet that is healthy and makes her happy, it’s nice. Sorry for the paragraph just thought I would say 😂
Ah white ppl problems\nIf I was middle class I'd make more important videos

He looks so cute in this
I’m loving the yellow nails 😍
i suffer from anorexia, it is inspiring to hear that people care about mental illness. thank you Dan and Phil for this video. every one blames me that its my fault that I could anorexic but I never asked for this, it just arrived and now it eats away at me making me believe things that are not real. I want to get win and get better but its so hard. video's like this help to encourage people suffering, it gives them hope I guess. it makes them realise that people do care. thanks for the video guys. :)

I painted my nails multiple shades of yellow bc I didn’t have any yellow clothing too!!!
nail polish and cheese dress.... I love it all
Imagine if they Starter playing Niche: a genetic survival game
I love your nail polish!
you are an actual ray of sunshine
People I've talked to go on about depression like it's a choice, or like it's some sin, or they think those who are depressed are weak. I try to tell them otherwise, but they go on like they know what it's all about when really, they have no clue.
Out school is shit they told us it was wmhd then just started to shout about attendance for a school trip 🙄🙄🙄😂
Snowpiercer is my favorite movie, omg it's so under rated
#1: Answer the door. #2: Come upstairs in the cheese costume. Geez, peer pressure much? I would totally tell my bf that, I might get hit in the head for it, but she'd probably accommodate me. She's nice like that. Sometimes. Best friends are meant to torment each other. It's a fact. The fact that they can understand you is a bonus. Domesticity at its finest. Oh and  nice he ordered milkshake(s)....I mean are you even surprised anymore?
When he turns his chair to his left the screen gets more yellow and normal colored, but when he turns to the right the screen goes purple
Dan!  you can use rubbing alcohol, instead of nailpolish remover!
💛We💛love💛you💛Dan💛and💛Phil💛never💛change💛
I had a councillor at school because people took the mic out of my name and the guy didn't even know my name. It made matters worse .
My best friend had depression after being bullied, and I have anxiety. Thanks Dan, this helps to know that you care.
Omg their calendar is gonna be with the Howlter family
but what if you joke about your mental illnesses to help you cope?
Guys I need the name of the anime he recommended is it new yokyo? Help
I actually got so sad randomly that I almost cried for no reason a few minutes ago. Do I have depression?
ARE THEY DOING A DOG CALENDER!?!?!
I wish I had a soulmate that would order me a milkshake

Okay. I cant get over the fact how loyal you two both are to each other. Y'all both have been together fpr 2-3 years, moved into a bomb ass house, got engaged,had a son, then move into another bomb ass house. Yall have the funniest little arguments but whem its ovet tell each other 'i love', you both make the craziest pranks on each other and you either get pissed or cry but in the end tell each other 'I love you' . yall can act totally ridiculous in public or not but never be embarrassed of each other. Yall both will do anything for each other amd it sets so much goals for people and its so inspiring.❤\nYall just keep doing what yall are doing cause you both dont know how much you impact on yalls fans and set huge examples for love. You both are the best parents dominic will ever ask for and you both are going to raise him so well!💕 #wilsonfamily

I liked the part where Kylo Ren tells Rey, Wow you are The Last Jedi. Sorry I killed your dad, Luke Skywalker.
I love all your content, and I think you're awesome! But I'm really writing to tell you know that I think your horse is The true embodiment of Black Beauty from the movie. 😁
I agree with you that trailer reactions are silly , but I mostly think they're stupid
God I can’t stand this girl
Palpatine was set to wear Golden clothing on the previous movies , dont mock snoke.  didnt you join the SW showmoedown
Oh baby, I'd love you  so much, and post-coital would be a trip to the stars! Plus. I'd like to nibbke your feet
This is hardly a reaction video
I think it's some sort of bandage. The scar is different later.
It kinda doesn't work to criticize trailer reactions while running with a Droopy-the-dog schtick as pretentious as this. Just putting that out there.
Every time Jenny rolls up her sleeves, take a shot.\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so it only happens a few times. Drinking is bad umkay.
In a bold move to finally tie animated Star Wars to live Star Wars, Disney will make Rey the lovechild of Ezra and Sabine.
Our allegedly strong female lead with the line Just show me my place in all this worries me.  A strong character has goals and at least an idea of the path they want to take.  Rey kinda just bumbled her way through The Force Awakens too.
Is she for real?
You and rich evans have two different opinions on how to use a porg doll.
Is that your daughter's room or do you still live like a 12 year old?
How can she hate Rogue One and be excited for TLJ?
Many it's like a weird looking Band-Aid.
It’s like Ellie’s new tattoo. The ultimate cosplayers got it tattooed lol
I figured it was a cyber-bandage thing of some sort
Biased against the poor Foxes because you don't personally like them?... SMH ;)
I found I had more of a reaction when I tae a shit then I did when I watched trailer. The 1 thing that the trailer are my movement was alt of urrr, ugh, groan and grrrr's
I want to see a Jenny Nicholson/Red Letter Media cross over.  I think their senses of humor would compliment each other nicely.
The Mesh Thing as you call it, is most likely a Bacta (Star Wars Magic Medicine) patch used for healing wounds on the go, since this movie is supposed to take place right after the last one according to the director. I'm guessing he is feeling like a failure after his loss to Rey and wants to get right back out there in the fight and slaps it on his face instead of going home to lick his wounds for a while. Then by the end of the film, it will come off. Think future face grow back bandaid.
You're trying to say figuratively blind. Watching Archer helps.
The scar looks like some Kevlar tape bought from Amazon stuck on his face.
That Kylo ren  doll is creepy af
Eff the redemption arc. Kylo gots to die.
Watched 10x before lighting up.
Trailer reactions are silly, you are so right. Most of them should be called trailer overreactions.
Last shot of Kylo, could be from the flashback at Jedi academ wood-shop failure. And Kylo stoic? I don't know your humor, was that sarcasm or confusion, cuz everyone calls him emo Kylo. :)
the mesh is a space bandage.
I think it's just a space band-aid on his face
How funny, you are silly, and cute, but a little silly, I think I mentioned that already, not sure I trust those porgs though, what someone else called an egguin, a term I like, but I can't wait to see the movie, mesh scars and all, force be with you.
Jenny, is your left sleeve okay?
I thought it was a space band-aid
i do not do reaction
Torn between avoiding the trailer and watching this video.\n\n*Finally breaks down and watches this video*
Your reaction was cool, seriously. But Tyrone Magnus was better ijs
That stuff is not under Kylos skin I don’t think. It looks likes a band aid almost
It's not fun watching someone complain about entertainment
Make a video about  Andy Signore.
If you really want to see cringe reactions in their purest form, type ComicBookCast2 trailer reactions. The guy who does those reactions is like Tommy Wiseau of trailer reactions.
It baffles my mind people watch this...
You are so perfect, and I would, still, say that if I could only hear you on the radio,...... or something stupid like that.
who cares if he has a gold robe? What's the big deal? What's to dislike? It may be part of his character development. Who cares. The nitpicking about every little thing is getting to the point that I just can't watch this type of crap anymore. There's NOTHING of value in these videos. Just people doing absolutely nothing, saying absolutely nothing, talking shit about things they'll never come close to accomplishing themselves and so what the fuck is the point? You watched a trailer that we also watched, wow, guess we need a video about it? What's going on in the world? Why are we all choosing entertainment that's duller, less interesting, has less substance and doesn't bring anything new to anything. That's our world today. Watching people watch other videos and then bitch about them. WTF!?
I love the Porgs too
I was a huge fan of the part when the Porg opened up his mask only to reveal another Porg saying, Now, I am The Last Jedi.
I assumed it was a bacti strip to accelerate healing and minimize scarring. If that's the case, then he's obviously wearing it at the beginning of the movie, which is when I think the space battles take place.
If Luke and Anakin can get robot hands that look like normal hands why can't kylo ren get his scar repaired or pull a handsome Jack and have a hologram over it
She is so weird and awkward...yet I still want to bang her.
I HAVE SCREWS IN MY LEG, TOO!!
Yippee, another star wars movie. I can't wait to be disappointed by another average movie hyped to infinity.
Are you underage, why all the fluffy toys?
I can't find last week's millennial falcon. when are you gonna release it Jenny?
The Porg marketing for children is clearly working.
If I wrote the new trilogy I would see the OT events as WW1 and this new one as WW2. The Empire being Nazi Germany. \n\nStar Wars would be like basically what would happen if humanity colonized most of the galaxy 1000 years ago and the the events shown in the movies are the 20th century but set against the whole galaxy background not just earth.
It's not there the whole time.
I'm thinking that's going to be the same question most people will have when they walk out of the theater for ep8, too. Was Rose even in this? On the other hand we probably wont, because no one really cares.
So why did Luke (nor anybody else) not go after the punk and kill or capture him after he killed all the trainees?  Nope.  Luke just turned into a pussy and went into hiding for 30 years? Where were all the ghosts of Yoda, Obi Wan or whatever couldn't have been there to warn Luke when the danger was there?  Was Luke just the only Jedi training and running that center?
I like this video! You do sound more honest than the majority out there, and the part that you laughed because of how Snoke looks made me smile. :)
your poor boyfriend, his eyes must hurt all the time. ;)
One theory I don't see anyone talking about online the I believe the trailer confirms is that Kylo has an oedipus complex. He killed his father and then he goes right after his mother! Star wars is based on mythology so this must be what happens! #Leilo #KyLeia
You are amazingly awkward...it's very engaging for a channel, good job.
omg I don't know what is cuter you or the porg plushie :O I WANT THAT PLUSH!
You’re my new favorite person. I’m really animated when reacting to trailers. I literally threw my shoe across the room when it showed Kylo’s hand on the trigger. Then I screamed at the tv, “OMG! Are they going to show Kylo?” Before full on pterodactyl screeching and shouting, “I KNEW IT!!!!” There were other people in the room. We’re all atheists, but I’m pretty sure they wanted to call the exorcist.
Finally. An honest trailer reaction. I'm glad you didn't cry when you heard Luke speag. Or scream like a porg at the end shot. Or surmise the entire plot from a 2 minute clip of film that might not be in the film.
Your mother has a screw in her leg?  She is more machine now, than mother. Twisted and evil.
I know this chick is trying to be funny but um, yea.
Yes, trailer reactions are silly. But they make sense in internet nerd-town - what are they if not an excuse to add more 'content' to a thinly-veiled vanity channel and just blurt 'I LOVE THIS' and 'I HATE THIS', trying to impress upon the world nothing opinions, vaporware inner-ramblings, piggy-backing search engines, and overdocumenting every single dribble and fart, to the point where you can no longer discern things of merit and value?\n\n Which is funny.
You are just TOO COOL!! \n\nHOW can anyone else even STRIVE to attain your level of COOLNESS?! \n\n\nKeep being humble chick!! 👍
think they won’t say porg in the movie as a call back to not saying Ewok?
Oh no i don't want poe to be evil :((((
Is this comment section replacing Red Letter Media's comment section?
hey jenny are you single?
You nailed it on Snoke!  Hard to take seriously!
I would be very interested to see your analysis of the Steven Moffat era of Doctor Who, if that's something you are familiar with. Although it may be too much of a complete mess to even attempt analyzing...
PLEASE MAKE OUT WITH THE PORG ON YOUR NEXT VIDEO!
The whole flick is a comedy!
You bring back my faith that there still are some normal star wars fans out there. Thank you.
What eats porgs?
I love you.
Reaction starts at Never:Clickbait
LOL
#PorgLife
I didnt know they made Porg vibrators.
Mark Hamill resents your comments about face reconstruction.
Disco Snoke lol
*gasp
You are special 💗
It was bandaid
Other people are having fun in ways I disapprove of. You should only have fun in the same way I do.
No, I definitely do not need this.... sorry. But your command of the obvious is really firm.
Mr Sunday Movies does this better.
God I hate you
No. The last shot is a flashback. And that fire behind him matches up with the scene where Luke is digging himself out of the rubble.
I clapped when I looked at the comment section and everyone said they clapped, because I know that reference too!
I'm so sorry to admit this, but I fap to Jenny all the time.
Also quit Shitting on trailer reactions. People like the crew at Blind Wave, for instance,  work very hard on their content, know their stuff, are intelligent, and their responses show this. People want to see fans like THEM react to things they are equally fans of, as well as hear their subsequent opinons on the matter. Your invalidation of this is very narrow.
hmm...mighta been best that this video wasn't done.  But then I did enjoy the Kylo Ren with Rey shirt on.
Yeah! The Production Designers, creators, writers, and Director thought it would be a great idea to have the mesh scar thing to... challenge cosplayers??? In the last movie he had his face sliced in half... like deep deeeep cuts. Thats just a space band-aid, Im sure it wont last more than one scene.
Anyone realize this guy appeared in GMM Crew ep with mike and Alex and they made sushi like the spider one
Does Sean do any stand up comedy? I'd love to see some of that
1950s mustang
You better not replace Sean ever, or you'll lose all your subs
here's what I don't understand, why scale the fish if you're going to fillet it? what was the point of scaling if you're cutting the skin off the flesh anyway?
Shawn is my favorite internet personality rn, so genuine and funny. Thank you for the content !!!
3:26 Never heard of a straight bass Sean
how does someone who knows nothing to little about preparing food get a food show???\n*white privilege
nope, no raw fish for me, i dont want vibrio cholerae in me
great series, love how he was honest with the ratings lol
I'm a fan, but - I just don't think the world needed another white people learn to make sushi in ten minutes short, you know? I feel like it's been done and done and *done* at this point.
8:31 That's much better than at the truck stop.  Sean, open up a sushi truck stop.
No such thing as a 1950s mustang. They came out in 1964
lose the playa watch please!
Hey guys. Commenting here so I can plug Jiro Dreams of Sushi, one of the greatest sushi documentaries out there, and quite possibly one of the greatest documentaries of all time. You guys should definitely take the time to watch it. That's all.
more of a snowflake situation. killed me
I like how you are switching it up. Good job man.
sean is not even fun to watch. boring hipster dressing motherfucker
Where did you see a 1950s mustang?
The mustang released in 1964 1/2. Damn Sean. Letting down the Midwest.
Hey Shawn hold the spine of the knife just above the handle with your thumb and for finger and wrap the rest around the handle  you will get better control of the knife
Mustangs fist got introduced in 1964 1/2 but I definitely knew what you meant 😆
Need hot sauce to eat it or what?
So we filleted our straight bass\nSean...it's striped bass.
So 1:30 in and already they are lying to me. That is not a a stripped bass. The lines are broken.
I want to eat sushi off of Sean, Fantano, and Binging with Babish's shiny bald heads.
0o0 when he chops the fishys head
When they're cutting near the beginning you can see how inexperienced he is just by his knife technique when cutting to the middle bone because he holds the knife with his finger on the blade.  Surprised the teacher didn't  point it out
I would be dope for them to have a video on traditional shojin ryori sushi.
Plot twist the Asian guy on the thumbnail is Sean.
I hope he meant p-51 mustangs, not Ford mustangs........
Ik he's not a car guy but a 1950's mustang is not a thing 😂 mustangs became a car in 1964.5
That intro is what I like to call sushi porn
The justin Timberlake of food 
Sooo... There's an anime with this premise right?
It's still just a finesse game the chef is just moving forward...lmao I love Sean
Dude's such a sushi master that he has sponsor logos on his chef jacket
I feel like Sean Evans is so robotic and has no personality. He's like the Jason Bateman of interviewers
Gotta love those 1950's mustangs that came out in 1964 and 1/2.
as someone getting into blades and sharpening.  I have nothing but the utmost respect for a sushi chefs and how well they can sharpen their knives
Someone call Flava Flav Sean has the guy's clock on his wrist.
now kill a chicken next and make wings from scratch :)
that blonde girl... damn stole the show
There is not a 1950's Mustang. LOL
Sean's roll looked pretty dodge but I bet it still tasted nice as fuck!
Shawn Evans acts like a female.....jeeezzz
1:04 that's only four things.  Not five things.
Lol love it, 1950's mustang hahaha you killed it bro

Great episode FWF that was impressive Sean. mad props. I would've have been eating the sushi..
I remember the douchbags from good mythical morning
Anyone else wanted them to eat it
The chef reminds me of Adam Sandler for some reason
I really enjoyed the video, but you don't need to stay in character all the time. This segment seemed a little forced.
Little finger action?  That didn't sound right haha
I love Sean, but his knife technique is horrendous.
Mustangs didn’t exist until the end of 1964 nerd. No such thing as a “round 1950’s mustang”.
He has so much pride about making sushi it’s very wholesome
Love sushi! Thanks Sean your videos are always making me hungry and teaching me simultaneously.
watch more great video on Indian cooking click photo
“Like a 1950’s mustang” he says. Too bad they debuted in 1964😑😑
I'm going to pretend you meant a 50's P51 Mustang and not the car, seeing as how the fish on the rice kinda looks like the body of a P51!
You're such a good host
Can you invite Pewdiepie again?\nI know the first time you invited him! But he turned you down because he's busy!
What watch is that sean
Become a sushi chef in two months......... Lol
The secret to good sushi is bad fish. C'mon, guys.
Honestly if Sean made my sushi I wouldn't know if he was a pro or a rookie lolol
Honestly super proud of Sean. Great work! 
damn that big ass watch !
Sean that watch though!!!
Chef was a champ, seems like a cool dude

I make mascot costumes so I'll tell you one thing. Instead of wrapping everything in strips of fur, sew a sock out of faux fur, pull it over the thing you would like to fur and glue it to the head. Not only is this easier but it keeps the fur looking nicer.
Well it's official. You are legit one of the coolest and prettiest people ever😭😭❤️

Gal Gadot atop Lady Justice probably gave Batman the biggest boner he's ever had.
Where is Green lantern?
1:38 that smile 💙
The soundtrack fits the trailer perfectly. I love it!
I miss Christian Bale Batman :'(
I'm Batman. I like to grope boobs.\n\nI'm Aquaman. Want to hear a rape joke?\n\nClassy bunch you have here DC EU.
really really can't wait for it
I’m happy that Gal Gadot is playing Wonder Woman bu I’m not happy that Grant Gustin isn’t playing the Flash 😡😡
Can't help but notice this trailer begins with a dream sequence that turns into another dream sequence.
Pause at 1:38 and look at his forehead. ;D
Having the most epic of nerdgasms. :D
Wonder Woman is so hot!
*WHERE'S GREEN LANTERN?*
The only good thing from this trailer is gal's smile 😂😂😂😂
where's my boy Green lantern ?

I am gonna go see this movie in 3-D <3
wow nice film...\nmay i become a superstar.. haha kidding
No CGI shitstorm to see here.  This one is based on plot and character development.  And that song.  So good.  So original.  Never been done before.  Nerdtacular!
I love the flash
How about a superhero that can control/manipulate weather. Oh, that's right,,, we mortals can already do it through the people involved in geoengineering . Just imagine what a wonderful world it'll be when rich people/counties can buy weather at the expense of poorer neighbours.  Bad luck for being born poor and lowly educated, I suppose. Fallout from the many geoengineering project? I hear u ask. They haven't even considered it or could care less, they know best.
Marvel and DC are for pathetic man children.
where's my boy Green lantern

This looks better than the avengers. The avengers actually sucked.
Don't be surpised if the LEFT makes claims of Justice League being Racist! According to them if everyone in the movie is white, Warner Brothers is racist. I'm just saying...  CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and NBC will make it breaking news for a week straight. You'll have massive protest in every big city and attempts to block everyone from watching it. I'll put money on it that Hillary Clinton will encourage her SJW's mentally deranged youngins to shut it down!
1:44 martin & dua 👉👌

I missed the first 2 mins of the video and had to go back because I'm just staring at that perfect liner 😅 how do you do it Suzie! I got the nude bow jumper too and the cape coat I love it haha! <3
The shearling jacket is SO CUTE!
I love your jewellery in this video. So stylish and simple.
I love this background for your videos. Just so pleasing to look at.
Please can you do an autumn dresses haul?
Me encantaron todas las prendas  <3
She looks like she's coping off Zoella
Olivy, bat wingy, nudy, cardy, camelly, syntheticy, plasticy.....?????
https://youtu.be/DZVJC6guVaY
love the herringbone scarf!!
Love your suede jacket 🌷
Aviator jacket camel jumper and green cardigan are gorgeous. You have lovely style suzie x
Great haul!💖👌
getting that beanie for sure!!
where your earrings from?
Love the cardigans
Happy birthday
pls do more zara haul!!! ♥️
Love your try on hauls 💚 saludos desde Argentina! 💚😘
Ooh lovely haul. You must have been totally in the zone. The red jumper, colour is amazing on you and the grey pearl hat is fabulous. Grey  jumper makes the gold earrings pop and the aviator jacket makes me want to go and try one on. Am not a fan of batwing stuff for myself as they are pain to wear under coats though.
Where is your choker from? Xx
The jeans you’re wearing are fab! Where did you get them?
I like your videos...but I suggest something...you explain everything really well...no need to re-explain when you try them on...you takes ages on every item...loved everything you picked up...👍
I love scarves!!! I'm obsessed with them! 🙈
You're so beaut! Thanks for sharing your haul!
Hi Suzie, Love your video. Thank you. Please can you share where your jeans are from? They are lovely!! Xx
Those jeans ! Where is it from ??? 😍 your body👌
Her youtube channel is called helloOctoberxo...?
loved this haul! recently did a little shopping at Zara as well! :)
My faves were the grey and camel scarf, and the camel jumper! Oh and the cream cardigan😍🙋💛Been looking for one like that for a while! 💖💖
loved so many items! Why have I decided to go capsule wardrobe 😩
How tall are you?
Where are your earrings from, love them!
How did you make your thumbnail where you cut yourself out with the white bit around you? Xx
Hello October, you've come round so quickly! 🍁
Really like this makeup look, I know you said the lipstick is discontinued but I'd love a tutorial of the whole look
Looove those scarves!! I picked a couple up last year and after using the soft ones I couldn't go back to any of my other ones... also, can you link us your jewelry pieces?!
I love the font you use on your thumbnails! What is it called?
Who knows where to find the short necklace that she is wearing? Please?)
good call on the aviator jacket - you're right .. its the perfect length on you! lovely haul - love you!!
where are your earrings from? i love them!!
Oh my I LOVED every single thing in this haul 😍💜
Paused the video to buy the red sweater with the bow. 😂
Love the green cardigan and the suede jacket best.  I love the pink jumper contrasted with the black tie (very Chanel) but I would return since it has pulls in it.
that first grey scarf looks amazing on you! especially with your hair and makeup like that. so pretty <3
You can poke the pulled thread through the jumper (just stretch it a little bit where it's pulled-you will be able to poke it through one of the holes and pull it through from the inside). I have 2 cats I have to do it all the time!
LOVE LOVE LOVE everything from this haul. I'm a short arse too and I need that aviator jacket it's perfect. 👌 Where are you jeans from you're wearing in the cut away frames? Xx
Number 14 on trending eeeek!!!! Loved this haul, but my bank account did not 😂 love the olive tones and that scarf is lovely 😍
Hey Suzi , just wondering what hairdresser you go to ..? :) loved the haul. Knew you would kill it with an autumn haul. The aviator jacket is sooo flattering on you 😍😍
could you tell me what jeans you are wearing???
Very good video!but i cannot opeen the links!i want to buy firectly things i have got iphone6 and when i cleek on them it goes to a blank page whatever video i  see!can u help?thnk u!
girl im buying every single jumper, cardigans, scarves, and that suede jacket yesssss I love all of them so cosy and pretty and pretty much my style for every autumn and winter season cause dang its cold up here in the north of america 😅☁️🌧🌨🌦☔️
everything is beautiful.. also  the last coat..
That olive cardigan is absolute GOALS! It looks so soft and cozy, which is a must have for the fall! 😍🍂
Where are the white drawers behind you from please?
How tall are you? It would just be helpful in relation to sizing :)
I have the same faux suede jacket and I am soo happy with it! It's so worth buying. Love your hauls, especially Zara ones!!!!😍
Use a bobbypin to fix the snag in your jumper!
Your hair colour is just so nice :D
Everything looks amazing and suits so well! Except I agree that the “cape style” coat at the end doesn’t sit as well as the other pieces.
What lipstick are you wearing? It look amazing on you!! xoxo
When u wear the cuffs over your hands!!! 🙈
I got the same jacket but in pink xD
tha aviator jacket looks so perfect on you !!!! i love ur videos !
Love your style..more of hauls.. I just added everything in wishlist 😍😍💗
Does anyone know where her gold choker is from? Been looking for it forever xx
Fell in love with your earrings, where are they from? <3
That leather jacket you're wearing when showing the beanie!! Where is it from I've been after a jacket like that!!
I'm sooo gold you said that about jumpers being tight at the bottom and that they're not as flattering. All the jumpers I have that I love are loose and I was just about to get a tight one on ASOS. Ta!  Haha
So jealous that you can wear scarves and sweaters already, we’re still waiting for the cold in New York 😭
These videos are my favourite! Try on hauls are the best.
I bought the cape coat but returned it because it was just too thin. For the money I didn’t think it was worth it. Also didn’t have any washing instructions in it 🙈
I just ordered the oversize cardigan in gray. It will be perfect for when I fly to New Zealand in February. I had to limit my self, but wanted to buy everything in this haul💕
Ohhh so nice! Girl three bags for your birthday- you don't need to justify yourself! Love love love xxx
The grey hat. Love it.
Love the cardigans and herringbone grey /beige scarf, I love the bat wing coat on you, will be best when it's really cold as it looks roomy and big enough to wear a thick jumper underneath and still button it up. Your style is so good Susie X ❤️👍🏻💕
Makeup tut on this look please
Top haul. I have recently become obsessed with Zara this season. I recently bought an insane pale pink and faux fur sweater with huuuge balloon sleeves. It's life. I LOVE it.
Great video! You got so many cute clothes!! I have a small channel that I am really trying to grow. I would be super grateful if anyone could go check it out!💜
We have the same aviator jacket 😬 I love it! It's so warm. Looks great on you x
I bought the same sweaters in the exactly same colors😂
What jeans are you wearing?
Where are your jeans from? x
Do you actually try things on in store?
Love the aviator jacket! Your fashion content is so nice to watch :) xx
I want that camel jumper on you so much but it’s out of stock :’(
Stupid little puppy claws... seriously disappointing?
Zara is life! Love these pieces!
Where are your earrings from?
actually, I think the cape is really cute. It's really stylish and fashionable.
I have the red jumper with the bow except In cream, but it's gone so bobbly already even though I haven't washed it. Does anyone know how I can save it? So sad it looks so old and worn :(
You're looking good, girl!🙌🏻 Cute Haul!!!
Don’t keep the pink jumper with the black bow doesn’t really look cute and it kinda makes you look wide and hides your figure ✨
Where is this lipstick from? :)
I love everything omg!\n\nAlso, I personally really like long cardigans and I think this one looks lovely on you! However, if your looking for a shorter alternative, check out the cream one Zoella got from ASOS​ in her latest haul. It looks so cosy, but I also think it is the perfect length for what your looking for xx
To be honest I'll never get why anyone would consider something 'high quality' when it's literally made up of only plasticy synthetic fibers like acrylic that will look terrible after a year of wearing...
I just want subs
Youtube made me buy it...so I now got the beige scarf, thanks Suzie ;-). I'd totally be in favour of a Bag Collection video :-)
Love this zara haul would love to see more of these
Love these type of videos with try ons!Also love the scarves.Liked them all from the start on your youtube vlogs!

Its Saturday and I'm STILL singing Spice Girls songs!\nThanks guys!
I really appreciated watching the struggle of innovation. It made me feel like it is totally worth every time I try something new. Thanks!!
Hi Joshua i liked  your cake design and I’m wondering what type of gold paint do you used??please provide the name Thxs
Amazing how do u do it
The middle of the video is a hot mess haha
The guys should sing in every episode.
but the spice girls are amazing especially with spice cake
What do you have against Spice girls Joshua ? lol
This thumb up was for the Spice Girls enthusiasts behind the camera. You guys rocked.
I was the grudge for my freshman year of college.... totally won the costume contest! It was badass
I HATE SPIDERS.\nNo wonder this didn't appear in my sub list.
I’m so scared of spiders that it gives me chills even seeing you make it, especially the pointy legs of them but I couldn’t help but watch till the end and it’s beautiful
You love the Spice Girls and you know it! Friendship never eeenndss!
This was extremely good I loved it plz make more videos
To make you feel better there are 5 Spice girls, so Brandon is a little less creepy now. Well on that end of the spectrum 😂
JJR, the spice Girls are nothing to be ashamed of! We all love them, even you! Don't fight the spice.
Where do you get all of your shirts??? I love them!!!
Found your channel from iJustine! Love it.
He hates the Spice Girls,  tries to use a drill to make gum paste strings for decoration, and knows what channel locks are. Yep, definitely a Man . . . About Cake.\n\nAs for my costume, I'll be dressing up as a skeleton for work, but my husband wants us to dress up as peanuts so we can be nuts together.
Does whatever a spider cake does
I love this cake
Next Video please collab with How to Cake It
Aw, JJR, the crew's singing is great though!!! Love the cake (even though I'm arachnaphobic) and the crew!
I was Baby Spice when I was 8, my best friend was sporty spice and my neighbor made us sing for our candy.
Can you do a vampire team please. Beacuse I am a big fan of Twilight movie.🖒👍👍
I loved the guys singing and making JR turn red in the face. LOL 🤣💘
Long time ago I made and wore an autumn-themed costume  (that was inspired by Marjorie the Trash Heap on the puppet show FRAGGLE ROCK)  to work which won 2nd place in the costume contest. It was a separate hood over a long sleeved maxi length dress out of soft, drape coral-orange knit fabric; covered over with preserved florist autumn leaves and stems that I had meticulously appliquéd by hand. The accessory was a fan rake and to remove ANY doubt as to what I was supposed to be, my name tag read:  Pile-a Leaves!\nYou could make an Pile of Leaves autumnal cake like that too.  Bet it would be gloriously golden and gorgeous!
Really bitch! I was about to go to sleep and then I seen this video in my recommendation 💀💀😢😢
The Spice Girl puns! Lol Had me dying!
For the record, there were FIVE Spice Girls. Not four ;)
I love that all the guys started singing spice girls lol 🤣🤣😂
Love the Halloween opening!!!
You put a top panel on you middle tier. Did the gumpaste stay soft enough for the bubble tea straws
You guys are funny! (: JJR I always enjoy watching your vids!
Is that like a weird instrumental of ghost town in the background???
Honestly I think the spider would have been creepier if he would left it bone white and painted the top-tier gold underneath it. Cuz then I would look like a weird Fusion of the skeleton and spider
One of my most favourite video...if you wanna be my lover LOL 😂
This was one of the funniest episodes ever!!!  I loved watching this one!
Sorry, but I gotta love the singing and the Spice Girls references.  Totally liked for the Spice Girls stuff!!
This is one of the most beautiful cakes I've ever seen! It's so elegant!!! I loved every detail... AMAZING JOB!
I like the added Spice Girls 😅
so is he a top or bottom
I absolutely love your work!!!! Please please please do a two sided cake!!!!!!
The Halloween intro is amazing
Their singing is beautiful
me and my best friend are thing 1 and thing 2
Can make a Australia themed cake pls
My best Halloween costume (or, at least, my favorite) was Eric Draven from The Crow. I was about twelve or thirteen, wore an all black outfit with a life-sized crow decoration stitched to the shoulder of my shirt (and of course I had the makeup). It was awesome, and we didn't even get to go trick or treating that year -_-
New subscriber here if u wanna be my lover you gotta get with my friends making it last forever frrrrieeeendships never ennnnnnnd😂😂😂😂😁😁😁
Hello I have a question. Is there a reason u don't paint before and touch up after? Just curious.
I wonder where all the cakes go?
The banter between them all made this more enjoyable! Not that it wouldn't be without it but it made me smile 🤗
Loved the singing 😂😂😂,  your cake's look so yummy and beautiful ,  love you're show.
That wasn't a Halloween cake, it was a Wedding cake!!! but the two are not mutually exclusive so I will call this, Halloween Wedding cake 👰🎃🍰,
My best costume was a cardboard refrigerator running
This channel needs more singing 😂😂😂
Best halloween costume was was probably han solo, my friends were chewy, luke and Leia
I want to make a hALloween  but I am terrible at cakes and desserts
I am so in love with this cake!!
You and your crew are my favorite people
Hello👍 could you possibly do a Frankenstein cake?? And the original Frankenstein please😊😊
Love your designs!  I took up baking cakes 2 months ago and found your channel.  I think I've seen all your MAC videos & this one has to be the best! I hate spiders but I so wanna recreate this cake myself. Thank you for all the inspirations! Go Team MAC!
Phantom of the Opera, clothing sucked but I'm proud of the makeup I did.
I HAVE ARACHNAPHOBIA WHO ELSE DOES
I'm sorry Josh, but i feel they should sing more
😍😍
Best Halloween costume: I was a gps
The spider looks almost like a jeweled pin.
When I was 11, I had two costumes.  One for the town Halloween parade and one for actual Halloween.  For the parade, I was a golf ball.  For Halloween, I was a munchkin.  Donut munchkin.
I absolutely love the crew! You guys rock! JJR you need to sing along man, singing good for the soul!!
People gold shame me all the time
I always like watching your videos. You make beautiful ckes
The bloopers and the singing kinda made this better... and that spider was awesome, this woukd an an awesome cake for someone getting married around Halloween ^_^.
This episode was hilarious! I feel your pain with that extruder that would make me crazy!! Lolllll. This cake is amazing! And yes I have a crazy fear of spiders but you made it look incredible! Great job as always!
I will sing a spice girls song every time I hear pumpkin spice lol
hands down my favorite episode the singing and back seat caking make this too legit to quit. #backseatcaking
#50 On trending!! 😄😄 So glad I found this channel!
My favorite MAC video

I LOVE HALLOWEEN!
I want your shirt 😂😁
LOLOLOL, those references. LOL dead. FRIENDSHIP NEVER ENDSSSSSs
Love it lol
Make a jack skelington cake!
stop singing LOL
Wow that's amazing
That one creepy looking spider...
Sub+. \nU guys r funny 😂😂😂
No recipe?
Omg. You guys are so funny. 😍
Nice Spider Cake!
great singing xD
There were 5 Spice Girls.
To clarify: I never said I was definitely returning it (or the company took it back), I said we'll see if they let me! as a joke, knowing I've done a lot of stuff in it and also made a video documenting me doing those things, implying that they would definitely not let me return it. Sorry if that didn't come across or if anyone got confused! xox
I think you and Tyler would be a really great Jazmine and Aladn for Halloween
Possibly one of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen! I 💗 it Safiya! 😘
safiya can make the most weirdest and strange videos entertaining af
Comes for Safiya being weird in public; leaves with historical facts about long sleeves in regards to social class
I actually love it with the rolled up sleeves and the folded sleeves, but 100% needs to cost less lol
i want to know where she got her jeans from the 1st outfit i love them!!!! SAFIYA I HOPE YOU SEE THIS AND RESPOND!!!!!!!!
first thing I thought of was wacky wavy inflatable arm man, and then you became him, I died.  Also I thought of that scene in mulan when she was pouring tea with the long sleeves.
8:42 the man in the background waved at the camera 🎥
the first outfit is actually gorgeous with the shoes
to see a friend I DIED
OMG WHEN SHE WAS DOING THAT MAN THING THE FLOPPY MAN AHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
this video reminded me of namjoon dancing
The jacket reminds me of Namjoon with his black long sleeves dancing on weekly idol
SAF'S SHIRT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO IS AMAZING
What a stupid video !
this is like that one scene in the book of howl's moving castle where sophie accidentally makes howl's sleeves a mile long
I just can't get over the fact that it's $700
I wish I could have been there when Safiya twirled around in her dress
I really enjoy the history bits you incorporate
when she was talking about what Disney character she was my first thought was dopey from Snow White!
As always I love your videos Safiya!! U got a pretty good idea for a next episode : What about buying a blond or white wig made out of real hair, then mix up a bunch of hair dye to see what color its gonna turn out on the wig :p
I took the Jacket to see a friend XDDDD
The 'ADER error' store sells clothes (like this jacket), which seems unrealistic to wear?? Would be interested to see someone trying those items on eg. the socks muffler 05
I love the part with the tubular man 😂😂😂
Honestly if she just cut the sleeves it would be cute
5:29 is my favorite part of the video😂😂
I feel the people who say they like to wear extra baggy long sleeve shirts so they can flap the sleeves around are responsible for this. I am one of those people. I'm sorry.
Maybe you could make one, but a few at Salvation army, cut the sleeves off of all of them and sew them on one to make long sleeves or maybe use safety pins:)
Unrelated to the jacket, but I loved Safiya’s shoes she wore for the first outfit! 😍
Please wear all your chokers or necklaces together :)
I like how I get educated and entertained at the same time  while witching Safiya
That is the UGLIEST damn jacket I've EVER SEEN! Lmao!
You will never get a paper cut again
Can you make a video where you make outfits only using intems On sale??😀 love you vids😍😘
Safiya get one of those dresses at 8:20 and were it for a day doing normal everyday things. \n\nLike if you agree!!!
Lol when she started dancing with the blow up I was dying
I’m the same size as those sleves...
What character are you? Dopey.
Fill the sleeves with rocks and start swingin
I think you look a lot taller in this video.
i would definitely buy that jacket if i could afford it...
when your mom tells you to get a size up so you have growing room
Ugliest jacket EVER! Ugh! What is the purpose of this?! 😂
Reminds me of a scene from the movie Beetlejuice, when he turns into a carnival with the hammer hands
8:41 I thought she was sniffing the jacket...
You should try one of those services where you can get a fashion subscription boxes of clothes styled specifically for you (like Stichfix, Le Tote, etc). I’d really like to see a video like that.\n\nIf you agree, like so Safiya can see this comment!
and i thought the sleeves on my denim jacket were too long
This jacket fills me with joy. It's so dumb but so wonderful! ❤️
Safiya is so funny Imao, when she is trying to copy that craft dog
I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD WHEN YOU WERE FLAILING YOUR ARMS AROUND
so much anxiety ran through me when she couldnt zip up her fly
you should try to wear it as pants
Maybe slender man wants to be fabulous😂
This is great. Internet gold
i've discovered an insatiable need.
She could just say she’s dopey if someone asks who she is
Does anyone know where she got the sweater in the intro? (with the roses)
If she puts it on backwards its a straight jacket...dont do that
this video kinda bothered me because I appreciate and am obsessed with fashion so much and dream of being a runway fashion designer and I thought this jackets was pretty cute but I can't see it on a casual normal person lol
God you are so pretty.
I'm just saying like Saf how do you have so much money first you buy a $700 jacket THEN go to Disneyland
Were you at blaze
a jacket to have fun in........... *alone* \nWell I mean that's how I usually spend my days anyway. ;D
The shoes that she wore in the first outfit were so pretty!
She's just like that one girl who never shows her hands while wearing a sweatshirt in the show the kids next door
I've been laughing for 10 min lmfaoo at I took the jacket to see a friend 😂😂😂 when she started flailing the sleeves I died
what happens when u ate too much boritos and u gotta take a #2?
Could you do the my boyfriend dressed me for a week pleassseeee🤗
I honestly would buy this jacket if it wasn't $700
you need to dress what you see in comercials for a week
If homeboy comes through with a regular jacket, it’s quiet , but if homeboy comes through with a 4ft sleeve jacket , homeboys gonna like get it
The historic facts. Awesome!
9:58 her ass cheecks were blurred out lol 😶... 🤣😂🤣😂
OMG you're hilarious
Or dopey
Jean jacket straight jacket
I am dayein lol😂😂😂
5:27   i love you xD!!! ahahahhaha!!
Watching this gives me anxiety
https://youtubem.video/r/?SZTvVZ8zyV9iS=6rT2GqDPrvYTlLvYVpVRBTPlurjTzeGYvBzeSgUl3T
Edward Denim Hands XD
Wearing your boyfriend's hoodie like...
Makes you look taller

I laughed sooo hard at this
You should try butt crack jeans!
I couldnt stop laughing, sm1 save me, I love ur vids, ur awesome
Those sleeves are taller than me
Where is the ugliest skirt SAF!!!!!!
Rapmon would wear this jacket 😂
Im 4 feet tall....
Why-project
5:25 LMAO
Mix your highlighters!!!!
Your not funny
Ok but if this wasn't the price it was, I might've tried this out for a week aswell, this is actually cute😅
so an unoriginal movie. Star Wars is ruined.I'm out.
How many times will Pablo Hidalgo have to tell you Gray Jedi dont exist!? Stop perpetuating the myth!
Pablo Hidalgo tweeted MONTHS ago; \nI don't understand all this Grey Jedi talk. It's the light side, the dark side, and that's it. There is no Grey\n\nI foresee ALOT of disappointed theorists in our future. \n\nI guess this is what happens when fans have NOTHING but time between episodes to make predictions and speculation. \n\nI would say, I'm not hating on the people who speculate! but that wouldn't be true. \n\nI'm letting Lucasfilm fill in the blanks for me. As they have since 1977. They created this thing I hold so dear.
Everyone be like, oh can't watch the trailer! Can't spoil it!\n\n\nMe: @nerdist TEAR THAT $*!T APART.
I think a BIG detail was missed: Luke's fear!
I love how she pretends to give a fuck about all of this xD
Great job Amy on this episode of Nerdist News!
She talks too fast the first half.  She needs to pace and breathe.  Outside of that, it cracks me up all this crying over Jessica, happens every time she isn't in the video lol
I can't wait for Dec., but seen this new trailer it as the look of a rehash Empire Strikes Back like with The Force Awakens from a New Hope. basically The Empire/New Order & Rebel/Resistance still haven't learn from history. they might have new tech, but still essentially stuck in a loop.
Star Wars: Return of the Mary Sue
#TEAM CHEWBACCA because he is going to eat that stupid porg thing lol
How did the star go from being cute to unattractive in just 18 months
Jesus! Fuck! What is it with her eyes?
She reminds me a lot of Pearl from Steven Universe.
But what about Luke being placed on the back of the poster? Like all antagonists have been in the posters as far as I know.
Nothing about Phasma and Fin, but all about the Porgs? Are you taking Star Wars not serious? :)
#teamporg\nI hope I don't wind up regretting that.
The fact that they remembered the blast mark is amazing. So much attention to detail.
Where the hell is Chobot?
that prog is going to be annoying
spoiler warning after playing parts from the trailer. im sure anyone who want avoiding spoilers would not have click this any way. but still you made a shitty warning
Got to love myself a little Porg
I agree with Mark Hamill: They have totally fucked up Luke's character,and this trailer seems to be more evidence of that.  Also, they should retitle this Episode 8: Return of the Mary Sue
Chewie is a legend!! where does he fit in all this? are R2 and 3PO going to continue on their dumbass adventures? what about BB8 and the new evil BB9??? also, Phasma..... how sick does she look?!
Great breakdown because you added bits of info you know as a fan already knolagble about the Last Jedi
Je--Jessica? Is that... you? Wow. Star Wars has changed you
What's with Rey's white lightsaber or am I seeing things?
Loving that Vault-Tec top!!
I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\n\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\n\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \n\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*
I'm on team Amy.
NERDGASM FOR THE CRYSTAL FOX!!!!!!!
I miss jessica\n\n
this trailer was the final piece that convinced me: star wars is DEAD.
Could Snoke's torturing of Rey be a force dream and not real?
Some of you guys give nerds a bad name. \nWhat does it matter who is presenting? It's the content I'm here for!
Love the trailer, but I hope it's full to the brim of misdirection like the Rogue One trailers. All I'm going to take from this is that it looks COOL!!!!!
Holy shit the blatant disconcerting reading-face she's doing is the most distracting thing I've seen in weeks, and the fact that you had to KEEP CUTTING TO HER RANDOMLY forced me to keep most of the video off the screen at all times because seeing her leaning forward staring at the cue cards/prompter made every word she said turn into those sounds adults made on Peanuts cartoons.\n\nIf you have to bring someone on that can't read without leaning in and making it obvious, at least don't cut to her at random frequent intervals so it's less of a distraction.
A bit dumb and logic jumpy. I think after that scene with the ships giant robot elephants warp in shooting nuclear bananas.... Could happen!
Fuck Jessica\nShe's a thot
I am hyped for Carrie Fisher but it’s going to break my heart, and I want a nude scene with Poe and Finn... but that’s just me...
Amazing, Amy did great, even she has the same gesture of putting the arms behind her back!! 😍 In general she's more cute and Jess more spicy, but anyway, good job!! 😊
is it just me or thi Amy Vorpahl is just too hot!! damn
Bb8 getting zapped from the back of Poe’s Tie Fighter, a nod to R2D2 getting zapped on the back of Luke’s Tie Fighter in Star Wars A New Hope???
#TeamCrystalFox If they're running into the base it's clear they've been domesticated and are being used somehow by the Resistance. For who knows what but they're cool!
Amy, dunno what you did with you hair but it worked. You looking damn fine.
I wonder is Rey was created by Snoke a'la Darth Plagueis with the purpose of mating with Kylo to give rise to the ultimate Force child?
Balanced Jedi are those who rely on the Light side of the Force. Anakin brought balance (restored the natural balance) by destroying the Avatar of the Dark side, Sidious. The Gray was never canon.
We are the Porg. Resistance is futile.
What about the line which Luke says about raw power ?
I bet she has a HUUUGE vagina
We are eternal spiritual beings having a very brief earthly experience.   R.I.P and annihilation are a LIE!! Dont wait until you breathe your last to find this out.  \nhttps://youtu.be/5QqMQNPy2LU\nhttps://youtu.be/p70oyjbKftQ
The grey jedi crap goes against EVERYTHING.
I didn't miss shit!
the scene between Brienne of Tarth I mean... Phasma and Finn is reminicent of the Revenge of the sith  cover with Anakin striking Obi-wan with his lightsaber inside Darth Vader's face
#teamporg but where is my girl Jessica!?
Porgs and Star Wars fans are words that will never go in a sentence together. EVER.
Herow Amy!!  Great job :)

Wheres jessica
Man. I love this channel, but the troop of turds lead by their cocks crying when Jessica isn’t on makes me queasy.
Why do the US and UK trailers have different middles.. THIS CHRISTMAS or THIS DECEMBER around the 1min 20 mark...
Basically its all white males are now bad.... You know, the majority of the USA... Now has to sit back and let 'minorities' take over to become 'equal' WHEN they wont show the same in countries they come from.... Thats how pathetic people are. Wont help each other in their own country BUT make white people PAY for their 3rd world country immigrants that want free stuff and to blame everyone else for their mistakes in life...... How pathetic.
Bring back jessica
I guess this song means he learned his lesson in *When I Was Your Man* and now treating his girl right.

Wait until you see the SEX Tape Bruno made with Steve Harvey.. Repugnant ! You'll never guess which one was the pitcher & which one was dressed like Little Bo Peep.. swashbuckling Madness
This shit got less than 100k in 24h and is on trending wtf
Most underrated artist/performer. I don't always like his songs but he is very talented and a great entertainer.
Bruno probably ate his CD for breakfast
He needs two other people to sound good lol

Ffs you bought shit,  you need fox or tld brand clothing
Find good matcjing gloves
Go to eBay for towbar
gumtree or ebay
Looking FRESH!  Yes lad.
Upgrade your rocker
what a little bitch? you just hurt your foot? so what...  lease you can still ride and live a normal life and not of had to have operations and long recovery, STILL recovery ill say like poor scotty cranmer...try being in his shoes mate and show some respect to him.your crash isnt serious/worth crying over, you will live, get over and fuck you
Muddy fox is a decent brand for mtb but you would be better with like fox or alpine stars. I wear alpine stars because they're amazing for long endure rides especially for jumps and stuff
That looked so painful get well harry 😔
You look a twat in that
Range Rover comes with a tow bar 😂there is controls in the boot to release it and it folds out
Make sure you lock the bikes with a chain if you end up with a bike rack , been known for bikes to get nicked even at traffic lights when on racks
No you haven't broken your ankle it's just in a cast 🙄
Dude I work for Land Rover @champagnejolag that's my insta DM me I'll hook it up
EVOC Back packs for the win every time !!
get  universal tow bar in have a range rover and it works excellent mate
Harry those 2 holes on you tow hitch are for the safety chains on a trailer. Incase a trailer comes off the tow hitch ball, the safety chains wiith hooks stay connected and insure the trailer doesn't go into on coming traffic, hit a person or a building etc. You want a tow hitch bike rack like this. It'll slide right in to the square receiver n fastened with a big pin ..... \n https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-Racks/Thule/TH990XT.html?feed=npn&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIofbev_jp1gIVQWSGCh1JkAubEAQYBCABEgKO2fD_BwE\nThule make good hitch racks. Hope this helps.
*HARRY hit up Cannock Chase!* Best place I've been to for Mountain Biking!!\nhttp://www.chasetrails.co.uk/
Doing sick bro keep up the good work
Harry, get the space brace for your ankles when you ride. They will save your ankles! Also help you get revived.
I am so glad harry is keeping it like his channel in stead of worrying about youtubes rules! Cheers!
you can purchase a bike rack that just sicks right into the square hole in the back.
its a bit shit mate, got to a mountain bike specific store and there get you the baller shit you need man!
That was one of the funniest vids I've ever seen!! Good start with the Enduro gear, just stay away from Spprts Direct next time. Have a ganders at Endura clothing on Chain Reactin Cycling.
Parking over two spaces like a twat
Harry!!!! You don’t need glasses bro, just bang on a sick set of goggles with your full face 😜
Why don't you get a roof rack for the bike
thumbs up for nandos (SA for the win)
There is a tow hitch already on it. Just removed that plastic blocking the hitch and you can use your bike rack.
the riding shorts are good  but maybe invest in better jerseys, those ones look like they are for cross country, also an enduro helmet would help.. For example ( troy lee designs A2 helmet) having longer shorts is better too,  the jacket is good.
for your towbar try Caravan and Camping/ towers in southport
You have a hitch on your Sport already mate.  All you need is a bike rack now, it will go right into the existing receiver.\n\nSomething line this would work https://www.roofbox.co.uk/scripts/rbvehsel4_tab.php/car-specific-accessories/buzz_rack_bb4_4_bike_wheel_support_rack_no_brp304/Qx%40w%2C6M42VAwp3%40Rb%7B~cC4ure5HXEB\n\nGood luck with the ankle and the date bro!
Nice little fear and loathing in Las Vegas look! Yesslad
Get a tld Jersey they're the best
Holy shit mate, i sprained my ankle on a second degree and y have a friend that hurt it 4th degree, and now you!, we were joking that hurting your ankle was the new trend. Its fkin nuts. What up with the global energy or wtf is going on, too many synchrinicities
A Thule should just slide right into that hitch that's already on your car. And I'd definitely get a neck brace for downhill riding. If you go head first into a tree without one you'll for sure fuck ur shit up.
The square in the middle is the tow hitch receiver...typically you'd slide a trailer hitch w/ ball mount in there to tow a trailer, but they make bike racks that slide right in there as well, similar to this  https://cdn1.static-tgdp.com/ui/productimages/approved/std.lang.all/90/45/t2_classic_wloc_9044_9045_sized_750x492.jpg
You already have a receiver hitch, which is the squareish opening back there, which is what all bike racks insert into anyways. Get a North Shore style rack or a tray rack. North Shore mounts the bikes so the sit vertically long ways. Tray rack they just sit by the wheels horizontally. North Shore rack would be my personal opinion any day as you can hold way more bikes and they don't extend out so bloody far, so they are sturdier and more compact so that you're less likely to back into things.
You already have a towing receiver. Just buy a bike rack that fits your (guessing) 2inch receiver.
Harry you need a hitch bike rack. You already have the hitch you just need the rack not a tow bar. US price is less than $100
get  full face helmet with the remove able chin piece there better for enduro type riding
Don’t get a Thule get a North shore rack they are much better
buy a thule bike rack or a roof rack for the MTB it will look steeazy and its not half that expensive
stretch the other side of your ankle.
check out the online store chain reaction cycles
You have a hitch receiver. Just get a 2 rack.  🤘
You should have gotten the TLD or FOX gear
Most hilarious video in a while or maybe I am just in a good mood.\nI feel Harry is back to having tonnes of fun and just doing things he loves!\n\nVery good to see my man, cannot wait to watch you shred some enduro in your new get up!
Go on chain reaction cycle if you want good deals on any mtb stuff
Hahahaha the ginger part. Sounded like u said shall I edit that hahahahahahah. Hilarious
I enjoy the mountain bike videos
your fucking quality man videos are sick.
for outdoor sports stuff go to decathlon if there is one near you not sports direct
Riding gear is right I'd just go to a local bike shop
hi harry i have some downhill trousers and a top you can have . the top is a large and the trouser are a small to medium they were only used a couple of times . they are in good nic. let me know if you want them
Check out the Bell Super 3R helmet. It's a half shell but has a chin bar that you can attach and detached. Means when your confidents goes up you can remove the chin bar.
Hope his ankles alright but him hitting that tree was fantastic 😂
I feel you pain. Always did my feet and ankles. In the end I just permanently rode with 661 ankle braces on. Made a big difference in pain management and feeling confident. You're totally killing it on the MTB by the way 👍
As an MTBer who did some homework, I recommend Osprey back/hydration packs, camelback is the big name but osprey are better thought out, Chain Reaction are a good start point, another top tip, join British Cycling for £20 2nd get 10% discount at CRC, have saved myself a fortune
Shimano do a great hydration pack and alterations or funkier clothing is good
any fox mtb clothing are the best, for winter I've just bought the fox downhill polar pants and a gore-tex waterproof jacket......best mtb gear purchases i have made! For a full face i suggest the POC Coron...rated for multiple impacts so you can crash it a lot and you'll survive
10:48 i lost my shit holy fuck that was funny xD
bro you should make your own cry down hill gear shoes the lot job will look sick
The central square hole under the bumper is the main armature part of a tow bar(the expensive bit!), you have the electrics fitted too (black plastic thing to the right of square with sprung lid!). I doubt that you have the plug in part with the hitch under the floor in the boot (it's too big to fit under the floor, old ones used to attach differently and fit under the floor). Go to LR Supermarket in Speke, they can sort you with the bit that's missing (I have the adjustable height removable bar on my RR) - also they sell Thule bike racks - the 'tilting' ones are recommended cos you can still open the boot with bikes on the rack!
Budget is best sometimes man ruin it re buy :)
For your enduro rides you should def get a pair of bib shorts. Basically a Lycra suspender shorts but it has a pad in and stops any chafing. \n\nIt took me years to start wearing them. It it's the best thing I ever did.
giro switchblade is a pretty good helmet for enduro and dh
Osprey hydration packs are really good I’ve had one for a year and it’s really good
Towbars are normally a few hundred quid. Just shop around at scrap metal places and stuff or CES or euro car parts. They will certainly have something for you
An easy way to remember what you need to do is called R.I.C.E.  R- rest I- ice C- compression & E- elevation. If you do that you’ll heal quicker.
Get roof bars fitted by a Land Rover specialist not Land Rover themselves and then get a roof rack for the bikes
You need to get a ute to put your bikes on the back
Why don't you get someone to fabricate one lad
I sprained my ankle really badly and wrapped it up tight to stop it flopping about when on crutches. Turns out it's not the best thing to do according to NHS
And there is a channel on YouTube callGMBN that is all about mountain biking and everything you need to know when you are starting off
Such an expensive vehicle I would go the dealer to get the tow Barr
Come subscribe to my Chanel new to youtube would like your support I do biking vids
Not the superhero we deserve but the one we needed
So disapointed. Was in the metro with a bicycle, waiting for Super Kind Girl to appear. She never came. 😭😭😭😭
This is my favorite one haha poor Anna cleaning at the end
LA is so extra I love it.
Mike Diva is a genius.
日本関係ねぇじゃんwww
Is this PC Music?
Anna is so cute omg
California is going to become the meme and anime state soon
These ads are creative af. Most unexpected and wonderfully executed! 10/10
Now do one for those a-holes who stand right outside the train doors and try to get on without letting people off. Basic elevator/subway etiquette, people! heh
Oh, Mika and Anna. Never change.
Wooow Excellent job Metro!\nfinally a message that encourages respect for passengers and defends them from other rude passengers. There is no courtesy or kindness in many people in the public transportation system, and it is not an exaggeration but, yes, they behave like monsters.
I LOVED THIS. Mike & Anna are awesome.
I wish we could have that in France !! Ahah I love it !
My new favorite anime !
train and bus in Japan, also, SuperKind is needed.
Is this Hannah Diamond in disguise
Dude wha's this for?  Anyway I love this super crazy n cool KAWAII ;)
Why is it in Japanese?
Only a nobody walks in L.A. public transportation is a mobile apt. For the schizo-homeless

超親切のダサさは異常
Nice
I want the beam she can use.
And we continue to stigmatize bicyclists. Super kind should have used her words and found out why the eyeball monster wasn't standing clear of the aisle. Even eyeball monsters like to go with the flow, unfortunately sometimes there are situations that interfere. This PSA is a misguided social pressure call to action, how about stigmatizing the people that stand where the bikes are supposed to go?
So much better than most music videos!
this is a superhero we need
I wanna do her
LOL this got to russian news headliners
Why it is in Japanese?
え、何で日本語なの？\n皆分かるの？
Mike Diva making the world a better place by bringing artistic integrity to ice cream ads and PSAs

I don't think you understand the people you're trying to target with these ads.
wtf, i'm japanese, so i can't understand what happen in this commercial video XD\nbut this dim metro and pop girl contrast is actually too fun!!\n日本のイメージってこんなんなの・・・・\nまぁ良いか、テンタメの都ロサンゼルスだし。\n俺がグリフィス天文台からホテルの帰りにこの地下鉄乗ったときは、黒人の兄ちゃんが箱にお菓子入れて売り歩いてたなぁ\n駅も車内も薄暗くて、人もまばらだから余計このポップなCMが浮いてるというか・・・ｗ
Never in Russia
I do think its weird that you have Spanish announcements in the US. Doesn't it make sense that people speak a country's first language when they want to live there?
No surprise it's a man because women are never rude and inconsiderate.

DOPE Yg Hootie Feat. the King
I dont know when people gon realize Kendrick do what he want he just dropped a dope verse for Rapsody everything ain't gon be a control verse. Just know he can when called for
That cover is a picture of George W. Bush who lived in Compton for 6 months.
only came here for kenny
hook melody sounds like an old 50 cent
Snapchat anyone?
HAVEN'T EVEN LISTENED AND I KNOW IT WILL BE FIRE
Brah the chorus is so simple yet so dope! btw Feel free to check out our reaction to this gr8 song over on our channel
The City from the Game and Kendrick was superior.
damn too hype way to hype
here before 1M? I must be dreaming...
KDOT ALBUM
Trust. 🔥
oooo Fuck🔥🔥🔥
This shit was gay af
THE CITY FROM GAME MURDERS THIS NO SKI MASK
I wish they didn't add that echo to Kendrick's verse. It's hard to hear the last words.
I used to get YG Hootie and YG mixed up since they from Compton but this is a solid track. Y'all hating on the Kendrick verse? It isn't GOAT but its fairly solid. He did his thing.
haven`t even listening but i know kdot`s verse will be fire
This is ok but kdot need to rap more💯
I've been a mogul...,I am an enterprise

*Grant sounded like the new planet of the apes movie*
He is back with the pranks😂💫
The last part :( I hate you Joe for not helping Josh
This was a really good prank
lol, I'm an Irish dancer and that vid was so funny
dear joe,\nrecently it was my birthday and i had just saved up enough pocket money to get your sugg life jumper and it means the world to me also i wear it all the time. There is just one more thing on my bucket list and that is to go and see you. PLEASE COME TO AUSTRALIA PLEASE, it is my life goal to see you and if i don't i will have not completed my life goal. Ps. come to sydney plz :)
even when he's not being prank, caspar's still manages to get the raw end of the deal
When grant was on the phone and a balloon popped and joe squealed 😂😂😂😂😂
I got a SIGNED COPPY of 'Username: uprising'\n\nYay yay yay
Okay they were all funny but the Titanic one is just mean, I take Titanic very seriously 😒
This was the funniest video I've watched  of yours 😂😂😂
Why fuck do ppl talk about this guy so much.
If someone did that to me I would kill them
THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE VIDEOS EVER!!!!!!!!! I DIDNT HAVE TIME TO WATCH THIS ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND EVEN THOUGH I HAD SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY I WATCHED IT AT 23.00 😂😂😂😂😂 AND ALSO IM WATCHING IT NOW AGAIN 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 LOVE YOU TO PIECES JOE ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
most of joe's pranks feel like they're just huge pranks on himself bc effort
Still thing you should have dressed in an it costume and held a red balloon
Gg to Joe as he didn't clean up😂😂
NO! I wanted to see the rest of that _Titanic_ scene! Lol
grant's laugh/scream is everything
We need to get joe to do another DARE SUGG

I love grant, even tho he has stuff to do (I think) he still helps joe out with a prank😂😍❤️
I only click on the vid to see what joe was holding lololol
I just blew up 20 balloons and my thumbs hurt......
The teddy bear is bloody ginger too 👌😂

Joe goes to so much effort 😂💘
that hat makes jow look like dipper pines from gravity falls
Josh: I thought Joe and Josh would come back and help me with the balloons but no. They use to do it for Caspar but I guess not for me.\n(Probably not the correct wording but omg that is soooo sad, poor Josh)\n😂😂😂
I love how he always does pranks on Casper but he's getting saucy and doing Josh LOL😂😂 \n\n\n(Like if you agree)

I love joe sugg
I think joes sc has been hacked it's got some next thing on his story like if u seen his recent story
Look at your Snapchat story!!! You posted a number!!!
Well, there is a reason why it has dark hexagons: It is displayed on a plane. For simplification reasons, they did not use a fake 3D image because this hexagonal picture scales better and is easier to reproduce (scaling for all this folks that doubt it, the lines towards the outside will get blurred if scaled down with pentagonal structures).
Ugh... This comment section has wonderfully illuminated the lacking sense of humour among the british public. Brilliant video Matt, don't let the not on my taxes lot get you down, they clearly weren't listening or comprehending.
Wow I never noticed that. Can anyone tell me if it is the same in the US?
So... it's a Parker football?
A) Hexagens?  Pentagens?\n2) The images of the castle and fish and elephant are not realistic either.
One day this man will run for a President!
I couldn't care less about football but now you have pointed this error out I won't be able to stop noticing it until it is fixed.
Just signed. There are now 17,462 signatures. Enough for his letter, but keep going and we might actually get someone to really do something about it.
Perhaps they should replace it with a prolate spheroid. Wouldn't that be better?
This is why petitions are jokes.
You should talk to a designer about what that would look like.\n\nAlso, none of those really look like the thing they represent except in an abstract sense.  For one thing, things rarely have holes that go all the way though, at least not ones you can see though.
On the sign, you can only see one side of the ball. Obviously, the other side contains different shapes which make it round like a football.
the current symbol really is a parker ball i must say
Can I just say that the elephant sign is used even if no elephants are actually present at the wildlife park indicated. That's what I call misleading.
On the bright side, at least your government didn't want to make pi, or the equivalent of 0.5 * tau, equal to 3.2
BASTARDS!  Seriously, this is like the stock teamwork photo of three gears which contact each other such that they cannot function as gears. How can a country with such commitment to football/soccer get this so wrong? I blame it on the metric system.\n\n\nAlso - you need to find someone to produce a PDF version of the desired replacement to prevent an even worse version and to eliminate the 'what would it look like' stuck in committee problem. In fact, do one the way you want and also one that is obviously not-right in an aesthetic way to give the illusion of choice. People like picking the 'good one' and not having a preferred answer shoved on them.
Is there any kind of non-Euclidean geometry where an all-hexagon ball does exist?
Suggestion: Provide an alternate design. People are much more willing to approve a change to correct something if they don't have to do what they perceive to be the hard part.
It's a bit brave to link Bristol FC with football, isn't it? Are you sure the sign represents a football?
I just feel sorry for all those motorists trying to figure out which lane to drive into seeing a sign with changing equations for geometry
Dammit I'm italian, I can't sign it
The number of sides on a pentagon is a prime issue... oh har har 5 is prime...
We'e living in a time of austerity though. The government spent £39m on legal fees to try to strip people of their rightful disability benefits, do you really think they'll waste money on something like this.... actually, something this pointless and petty does sound like exactly the kind of thing May and Hammond think matters
I *HATE* football, but I *HATE* mathematical/geometric errors more, so I have signed the petition.
That doesn't look *much* like a castle. The crossed arrow slit is either extremely rare or non existent.\n\nThe problem is that the surface the sign is on is flat, not a sphere. Therefore you can't cover it with a pentagon+hexagon coverage. I don't think the filmed actual football looks as football-like as the one on the sign.
Haha... although mathematically you are correct they still wouldn't match reality if they changed the pic. Nobody plays with that style of ball anymore anyway. The original one was called the Adidas Telstar introduced in 1970. The classic black and white ball. Used again in World Cup 1974 until being superceded by the Adidas Tango in '78. Originally the Telstar was introduced to help people see the ball more easily on black and white TVs.
Well since the regs have literally just gone through an overhaul I’d say it’s a nice idea but never gonna happen :p
We did it R̶e̶d̶d̶i̶t̶ YouTube!
I have signed many of those such petitions, but this is completely different from any petition I have seen on there before!
Can we just ban football altogether?
Without context I'm not sure I could've figured out what pentagins are.
This shows that brits knows as little about ⚽️ as them stupid Americans that calls 🏈 an football.
The ball on the signs does not look quite right. It seems unnatural.  Thanks for explaining the mathematical reason why,
I am in the US but glad to see you making a difference in society and mathematics
I almost spit out my coffee at 3:21.
the government [...] don't really care about mathematics and science.\nOOH, D'YA THINK?!
He says all other signs make sense, but the wheelchair one you can see when he is saying that doesn't contain a full wheel.
Isn't a parliamentary petition overkill? Surely you just need to get a memo to the right department...
In my opinion this is a real problem worth fighting for #footbolsignmatters
Concerning your claim that no such ball can be made of (possibly distorted) hexagons: While the mathematics is surely correct, this does not exclude the possibility that some other shapes (say, pentagons) were used at the *back side* of the ball (that is not pictured on the road sign). This probably makes a less symmetrical soccer balls - but if we allow strangely distorted hexagons for the faces of the soccer ball, why not also allow to use differently shaped faces at the backside of the soccer ball (that one cannot see on the sign)?
Tank training ground is a Cromwell on signs.
Matt, I am sure you can come up with an imperfect approximation to a ball made all with hexagons and we'll call it The Parker Ball.
Perhaps the street signs are incorrect in _Euclidean_ geometry, but here in the real world we use _Minkowski_ geometry. Can you make a sphere out of hexagons in Minkowski space?
That was an interesting video!  At first, I thought, Who cares?  But, then when I thought about it and how you only wanted the newly made signs updated, I realized it does matter enough to correctly display football images on newly made signs.  Way to go, I hope you get your petition positively recognized.  I cannot sign anything since the only part of me that is UK is long past ancestry.
Petition to make him pronounce hexagon correctly
HexagOn, pentagOn, gOn, GON!! O!!!'
It's a Parker soccer ball, it's valid in Parker geometrical spaces
Undoubtedly a serious problem. Now all we have to fix is all those arrows pointing to the sky. Am sick of getting misdirected into space. It really messes up my day.
Just did it don't even like football but if its 3D will look 10 times better
Am I crazy or does he have an australian accent?
It's worth noting that the icosahedron was used in the Fat Man atomic bomb. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_icosahedron#Applications\nIt seems the ball is changing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_(association_football)#FIFA_World_Cup\nMatt is right on this one. The representation on the sign is obviously incorrect, and lots of math-inclined people would notice.
*What is the music that you use at the end of this video?*
I don't see any footballs, hexagins, or pentagins - only soccer balls, hexagons, and pentagons.

A ball made entirely of hexagons is known as a Parker Ball
Why not just get rid of all footyball nonsense in public entirely? It is a paupers game.
The zoo sign is also wrong!  Elephants' trunks always curl in, not out!
and where is the mathematics of a real football?\nhow many possible shapes can you combine to make a succesful football?
This is like saying the size and proportion of a castle sign is wrong we mist change it
Speaking as an American, I envy you that this is the worst of your mathematical problems.  8)
You've got too much time on your hands!
Alright then, The sign for roadworks needs changing because not all road workers are Black.
I totally agree! In norway, feminists got through to change all the old pedestrian crossing signs to a unisex silhouette of a person crossing, than the old man with a hat-silhouette. This cost Norway about 80m NOK, which is a bit less than 8m GBP. Crazy!\nI do agree that it was poorly designed, back in the 70's, but lets update the symbol, so all new signs get updated, and use those 80m NOK a bit more sensible.
THIS HAS BUGGED ME FOR YEARS, and I'm glad you noticed too.
Brilliant way to make geometry cool.\n\nMy man! \n(JL trailer reference)
i bet you can use a infinite flat surface as a ball as long you are playing on a hyperbolic plane..
I think it's of hexagons because you don't need to distort them on 2d space so it was easier to create lol Britons are lazy.
What about the airport arrivals signs? You can't land a plane with the nose pointing down!
I'm not allowed to sign because I'm not from the UK, but I would if I was.
national embarrassment... says someone whose country nearly got knocked out of wc qualifying by SYRIA
*clicks on video*\nO Shit, I know where that is! I now feel almost famous by association - I used to get all my school supplies in the staples just along that road
first world's problem
Good to know.\nBut not worth starting a petition over.
The ball at the Etihad stadium is stuck to David Silva's foot
This clearly shows that math and sports do not like to mix.
I will not let you pronunciation of Hexagon slide <3
I don't know about the castle, I'll need to hear Shadiversity opinion on that.
sounds like helen czerski and raindrop signs
this man is awesome
Y R amazig!!
Parker square ball
17,418 when I signed :)
Wow, those are truly parker-football signs
nice chalkboard
Wtf have I just watched
NERRRRRRDDD!!!!!!!!!!
Does it matter
Icons aren't meant to be real, they are meant to be easy to see and quickly to be recognisable. – Signs don't use photorealistic iconography of other things like cars, lorries, trees, because that would make it not stand out. – Would a pentagon-hexagon ball be easier to see then a solely hexagon ball?
I think you've missed the point of asking why the football has hexagons rather than pentagons.  As you say in the video, hexagons tessellate on a flat surface, and it is this flat surface that the designer is trying to achieve.  All of the roadsign designs feature a flattened, simplified perspective.  By these rules of perspective, a sphere must be replaced by a flat disk, and so the mixture of hexagons and pentagons must be replaced with a hex grid.\n\nI would have preferred regular hexes, though.
Who cares, it's a small meaningless change... also will the government listen to a petition and then waste money on useless sign changes
Yah, but then you can round the hexigon, gcd lcm, so 6 into 5, 30.  You cant easily use 15 without a cooly ball.  But why not?  In 1995, they had advanced materials, whirly tennis balls, you could play tennis in the rain.  It was so bouncy and aerodynamic that you could dip legendary shots, in the rain.  Man that was cool because any old man with wilson whites wasnt anywhere, just your marine core tennis pals. LOL! The ball was fusia, neon, and indigo ripple like a racquet ball, but hat slight overweight and under pressure with poly fillament that grabbed the air, discontinued in 2001 due to cannibals?  I was mad one time, and i realized baseball,  Take a ball because my bat blows smoke?  Upper cut a top spin into the short stop hitting the grass square negative curl for a frack your mom douglas serve koopa troopa.  So it stands to reason that whirly cleats with ankle 400 lbs skocks an d carbide teath are so supperior that nobody could beat and defeat them.  So we learned in 1993 how to compound with a caroitoid lever for acceleration.
its a road sign... its not really that significant
Do we really want to use tax money to change these
Let's waste tax payers money to make a nice signs that we don't need... Let's instead not.
Lets just say your campaign works....what a waste of parliamentary time. theresa-  lets discuss wage increases for the nhs, oh no theresa we have a much more important issue to do with pentagons and road signs jesus to think people have time to waste like this lmao what is the world coming to...spend your time partitioning for something that may save a life or help people. Sorry Sheldon but what a waste of resouces. Yours sincerley,\nAngumentitive Arnold
I'm not British but I do reside in this country for many years, still I don't know how important this can be for a UK born person and football fan. ? who cares about the geometry when it comes to UK road signs symbols ? everybody knows what this means so why changing it ?\n\nI  think it's a waste of TAX PAYERS MONEY and Money is needed right now in this country.
You need to do something about these ones as well!  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/55b76bec40f0b6790f000019/warning-sign-slippery-road.jpg

12/10/17 - #45 ON TRENDING !?!? lol this trending because of Harvey? lol
waaaaay fuck weinstein pizzagate is real boiiiis
Oh my god, the hammer pulled you off? xD
Korgs voice is great expectation subversion. you'd expect him to have a deep low voice, but he doesn't. and he's quite eloquent too.
Y’all complaining bout the voice doesn’t fit the character but not appreciating the pure brilliance of a gay sex joke in a Marvel 🎥.
korg is my favorite now. god bless this weird rock man.
I don't think they filled the quota of 5 jokes per minute yet. Quick get him another quip.
For all the people saying the voice doesn't fit the character, thats the point dipshits, its a joke.
You guys do realize that this is not The Thing but in fact Korg, right?
Stupid accent for Korg, doesn't even match up with the animation and the accent in general sucks, couldn't even tell at first what he was saying. How the hell does the hammer rode you on your back become damma rude you on yus beck? \n\nStupiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiid
IT'S CLUMBERING TIME!
Beached bro
Really that's his voice? Why would they even do that?
I'd be fine with the voice if it sounded like he was trying but it's clear someone really didn't give a fuck about Korg
This scene is not funny. Fuck i think blade runner had funnier scenes than this.
Yes! I knew the thing was in this!
Why the fuck have Marvel allowed Taika to make Thor into a parody of himself? This looks horrible.
Where can i find this Stand up comedy?
Not enough quips
Take notes, Fox! Kevin Feige/his crew can make a better *Thing* than your 4 failed attempt/boring/corny ass movies! LOL!
Knew the director would screw the movie. Just like Bay and Transformers. Korg better have some good fighting skills to compensate 4 that inaccurate voice the director so stupidly gave him.
That sounds nothing like Korg
they used this in the movie cause the lady who was the wife was in a commercial for Yuban coffee and she said that line in the commercial
That's strange. Jim never vomits at home.
I will, but Jim won't
Her name is Lee Bryant...   She played the pregnant lady, Punkin in an episode of three's company when Jack and Chrissy agree to take over Janet's babysitting job for one night and had to put up  with a crying baby, no TV, and a locked liquor cabinet  :)
I need Hannah Hart to be my best friend.
No ad...demonetized. Poor Hannah. Thank you for keeping on and staying positive.
💟💟💟 all the love to you, Hannah
Have you researched PMDD? It sounds like you might be dealing with that. I hope it gets easier!
I came out to my best friend the day this video was uploaded!!!
Coming out with something?  I can come out as being lazy.  But everyone knows this already.  I don't even have to mention it.  Also i don't think it's a fight I'm having with something I can't help.  I agree it's probably one of those your choices define who you are, rather than your choices are made for you by who you are.  I could be wrong though.  Maybe I got something wrong with me where I know I should go to the store and buy something to make a healthy meal, but instead, would rather order a pizza and watch Hannah Hart videos all day.
My fiance just came out to me 7 months ago that he now she is trans and I couldn't be happier for us I knew there was a reason why I always more attracted to women and it's like it was always ment to be but I'd love her no matter what sex she wanted to be it's been rough but we have good days and bad days and in the end as long as we love each other that's all that matters
Yesss thank you Hannah! I actually came out about how I hate my job on coming out day! How timely and sage your advice is 😊
It is hard...but totally worth it. I’m getting married this weekend...and 180 people are coming to celebrate us! That is amazing. We are so loved...and the struggle was real.
It has took a day to watch this cause my mam dosent know😂😂
Currently in a depressive rut and was proud, because I just finished my shower after not showering for...some number of days :) Thanks for the pep talk!
National coming out day 😂😂 fuck sake. This world is so stupid
Wow, I have over the years began to realize a pattern in my moods too. It is an annual shift around September or October, and I used to push everyboby and everything away from me. It would last months, and I was a super depressed meany. I am not as bad now, I acknowledge it and accept I am feeling this way. Then I fight like crazy to not be so mean and moody. It has been about 10 years now. I still get this way every year, till about New Year. I let people close to me know. Hang in there. It is not all bad. hehehe👍🌈
Hannah Hart I just love you! You're so awesome and always bring me joy when I watch your videos! That's all I want to say :) <3 Happy coming out day to you! :)
*come for the Hannah*\n*stay for the more Hannah*
Depression is an everyday all day thing for me. XD
Yesterday I came out to my mother as bi. I've only been out online and accidentally to my brother so I was REALLY scared to come out to her. I've been planning this forever and it still took so much effort but I did it! She was really accepting of me, she told me she loved me and gave me a hug. It was great!!
Your video soundtrack didn't
if you’re out to some people but not everyone, can you still be considered “out”?
❤you Hannah. Also why you bruise your lips crazy lady😭
Unfortunately there will always be small mi did people.
I'm sorry that you're blue (emotionally and physically),  I am so impressed that you managed this video when I have those days I struggle to say my own name.
I love that you're in tune to what your cycle does to your mental health...I need to figure mine out. Can anyone tell me the app she uses to track her cycle? I know she said it in a different video.
I wore my straight outta the closet shirt and I wore it to church and I got kicked out of church and was told I was sick
Man I wish I could....maybe one day.
Thank you so so much for eveything and being the wonderful person you are and share it! Go you !! 💞💞💞💞
I hope your downswing eases soon.  Lots of love from another Bisexual ADHD Hannah <3
I appreciate that you are transparent in sharing your true self with the world. Depression and Sexuality are very powerful topics. Thank you for sharing.
I'm trying to get my sister alone to tell her I'm gay. This is terrifying.
hey Hannah~ I love your message and the content you put out! I would love to collaborate with you on my podcast on my website @ beyoubeproud.org
You know, I roll out of bed in the morning, and take a walk in a local park before I can really think about how bad I feel. I shower when I get back. So, go take that walk, and worry about cleaning up later. It really does help.
Thank you for keepin it real!
May everything in your life be covered in rainbows and joyThanks Hannah xxxx
Love is a journey - i'm stealing that.
I've heard some people put it as 'Sometimes it doesn't get better, it gets different'
Hannah- thank you for making and putting up this video even when you weren’t feeling well.  That is a truly unselfish gift.  Sending get well hugs and hope that you feel better soon!!  😊
Came out to my dad today! I was realy strest out obout it but he responded amazingly
I identify with something Shane Dawson once said: Life doesn´t get better, what get´s better is your tollerance for bullshit.
Thanks for this video, Hannah! So sweet and so true. <3\nBy the way, that is a really great idea to tell your friends to ask you specific questions. I might have to use that too!
I'm bi but I'm in a serious relationship with a man. Do you think I should come out to my parents? Does it matter?\nLike if they know my bf and I don't ever date a girl why do they need to know who I've had sex with?
My therapist told me one time, “no one is ever done growing and learning. No one is a chicken you bake in the oven and it’s done and  cooked.”
Hi I had a questions and would really look forward to hear your opinion everyone.

YjtRY28Pe2o,Is it even good to have a day named after a group of people that share the same (quality, idea, belief, or sexuality)?

YjtRY28Pe2o,For example, I am not black but I feel like it is offensive to have something called Black History Month. I am an Atheist, but I would never want a day to be called International Atheist Day. I feel like that it creates more division instead of bringing people together, because you are excluding a group of people and say ok here is 1 day (week or month), this is yours and you can do whatever you want but after this you have to shut up about it.

YjtRY28Pe2o,But also I have heard from my friend that it is very different with sexualty since it is even hard for the person to figure it out and accept it and it makes it feel better to have that day and celebrate.

YjtRY28Pe2o,If you disagree with me I would like to hear your argument and also I want a day for these things, Asian middle eastern day, Gamer day, cyclist day, not much of a drinker day, believe in parallel universe day, AI enthusiast's day, not radio listener day, etc.
Opps, didn't know there was a national coming out day. \n\nI came out a week ago in my 23rd birthday 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I appreciate the comments about anxiety and depression, Hannah. Walks are good and depression is rough.. and it just so happened to be on my birthday. 😂😅😅
You're right hannah. Love IS crazy! Feel better soon.
Yes, it does get better! And then worse, lol. Yes...that's life! \nAnd hey - I had the lowest day of my cycle yesterday too.
thankyou for this you are such an inspiration to girls and the broader lgbtq+ community. i love you so veyr much and look up to you so much <3 <3
I didn't even know it was national coming out day, but I came out to my mom as bi!
Love you Hannah, I appreciate your honesty and openness.
Remember: It's better to be hated for WHO I AM rather than loved for what I AM NOT. YOU GUYS ARE LOVED! ❤️❤️❤️
I am a gay man (he/him) and you are so f-ing beautiful in everyway Hannah Hart. *You are love,* that's what you are. *<3*
Was gonna post my story. Got too distracted by Hannah's t-shirt and the hilarious Paddy's related memories it brings...
Hope you had a great National Coming Out day and yes, I believe that it always get better. Even if life can be hard at times, everything will always get better since giving up is not an option as we work through the worst, not losing hope and remain strong each time, just like on how we LGBTQ community keep on fighting for our rights and acceptance and those with mental health issues coming to terms with it and work on coping with it or at the very least, we focus on the positive and what makes us happy to make with help from our loved ones us feel better :)
This has really made me feel alot better about coming out to my nan thank you keep up with the good videos!!!
Well, I am a straight guy and I would date you in a hartbeat. Sorry for the pun ;D\n\nIn all honesty. You are one of the most genuine youtubers and I love the fact that you use this platform for important stuff like this!
You’re adorable, thank you for being you all of the time. It makes those of use who haven’t been ourselves want to be stronger. ❤️
You're right, Hannah, it does get better ... and sometimes worse ... and then better. Mostly better. I have been blessed that my coming out experiences have been primarily positive. Fortunately, I live in a supportive community and surround myself with positive people. To all the young gays out there ... try to find positive, supporting people and, to the extent possible, minimize the negative people in your life. As Hannah says, coming out is a journey, not a destination!
I feel you boo. I've also been depressed AF today. Made myself leave my house. I went to the Ocean after dark, walked on the beach and cried. Felt much better after, but still down.
it doesnt necessarily get BETTER so much as it gets... easier. handling the curveballs life throws at you gets easier with each experience.
SAME, every month I have to fight the urge to eat all the fats and carbs I can reach haha it does get worse before it gets better :)
Two inspirational videos by MyHarto and IISuperwomanII 😂\nHappy Day of the Girl and Happy Coming Out day!!
i'm so proud of myself as yesterday i came out to everybody at school and now im happy with myself because everyone was so supportive 😊
Love yourharto!  I feel like I need to take a wall at my house and do a giant graph. Maybe my downswings will be on a cycle as well?  Hmm
I battle anxiety, I hate my job. Wait, I whine about that every day on the social network so I guess I'm already out on that.
Right there on that peak low with ya
Cishet ally and parent here if anyone needs to talk ☺
Love  you!  You are beautiful and insightful and funny and kind.   I hope you feel chipper again very soon.  Walk and shower; great ways to perk up. ♥
Thanks Hannah... I really needed this today <3  When misery loves company! Yay for company!! ^_^;;
I love how real this video is.. this is what our kids/adults who are struggling need to hear. Not a fantasy story that they won’t even buy anyway... they need need the truth. This is encouraging for many reasons, but most importantly it reminds us that we are not alone or weird or weak for feeling how we are feeling and that even successful people like you experience ups and downs. Thank you for being vulnerable and honest with us. Sending love!!
I don't normally comment on videos but I am now. My 12yr old niece came out to me today. She told me that she's been planning on coming out today since June of this year. I am so incredibly proud of her. I love how open and honest she is. My sister, her mother, did not have the same reaction. Which, honestly, surprised me. I love me niece and support her no matter what. But my sister is my best friend and while I know she's most likely just scared and confused I don't know what to do. Any advice would help. Thank you.
Straight white dude here. Came out about developing PTSD while I was deployed. I have never been better.\n\nI'm so glad that you have such a public voice to spread such positive vibes.\n\nAlso, to anyone that struggles with coming out thinking that your straight friends would care,  well... A real friend doesn't care. \n\nAlso Hannah leave the house. Or drink. Or fuck it, both.  :-)
Ok,so I think that I might be gay or bi or sth I don't know,and I started thinking about it about 3 years ago and I was in denial until a few months ago, and all of this started weirdly,like not like most people start questioning,and I'm like what if I'm wrong and only 1-2 people know,but some of my closest friends do not and I'm trying to decide whether to tell them,even if I haven't figured it out,or not
It's not going to get 100% better, 100% of the time. Very true!
is your monthly depression somehow linked to your pms like mine? coz god I get so deeply depressed every month around that time, its just makes my regular depression worse for a few days, it just feels terrible..
I hope it does get better, and that one day I can be proud of who I am.
Hannah.  You are very wise.  Yes.  Coming out is extremely important, whatever you are coming from/ are/ want/ long/ need to be.  Take care, love.
I agree with everything you said in this video. Per the monthly cycle of emotional flux: it’s important to note the full moon can be used to clear extra baggage. While New moon will assist in attracting your desires...
I needed this today ❤️😊
Coming out is a journey, not a destination. Exactly right Ms. Hart. Some days there's little traffic and clear highways, some days it's gridlock, once in a while you have a flat tire. But keep going, and reach out to someone if you find you need a navigator.\nFind yourself thinking about giving it up? Don't. Just keep driving. Better is just up the road a bit.
Thank you Hannah! Love you and as always, take care of your self!
Hey Hannah I know you wont read this but ill try anyway. My ex was bipolar so I know patterns of emotional highs and lows pretty well. I'm not saying that you are bipolar but I am saying that if you see a pattern in your emotion then maybe talk to someone that can help you know? Especially if everything in your life is going well. IF there is an imbalance in your body then it helps to have a professional to talk to about it or even take medicine if it is necessary (not that medicine should ever be a first choice). But anyway I hope you feel better hun.
I love you, Hannah. Keeping it really real. I'm shi**y, I'm fine, today sucks, what a great day, I'm super depressed, wow I just had a fantastic idea!, I barely got out of bed, making this video is important to me, if you feel shi**y talk to someone, good Lord today sucks, have a great day everyone!!!\n\nI just love ya so much! You're just fantastic!\n\nKeep up and you will be kept up~ Yogi Bhajan\n💛
Thank you,  it is nice to hear that.  Twice in past year I have been cornered by family trying to force me to come out to them. I only within this year have really come to terms with myself and the label queer (I think I identify as Asexual maybe Demisexual, but talking to people in the past about it didn't go well for me). But, it is still good to hear encouragement.
I am feeling depressed today because Joey Graceffa couldn't make it to Colorado. :( Thank you Hannah, you always make my day :)
You're one of the reasons I felt confident when I came out Hannah, so thank you. I had a depressed day today too so I feel you girl. We're all here for one another. You're not alone❤
Happy coming out day my love! I love u so much! Thanks for inspiring me <3
To anyone who came out and it was not well received, don't let yourself feel too down because there are tons of people out in the world who care and will accept you.  Also, the plus side is that now you have a handy little list of people you don't need to buy Christmas/Hanukkah presents for if you celebrate the holiday ;)
I’m asexual and aromatic dammit!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nWhy won’t my friends stop asking me why I haven’t dated anyone yet!?!?!??  I have told them I was asexual and they said that would make me a soulless bitch. IM NOT A SOULLESS BITCH!!!!!!!
You are such an inspiration to me, just as an amazing human being. Thank you for this video.
4 years ago after Hannah posted a video on National Coming Out Day I wrote I think I might like girls. into my diary...and I was totally right, still super gay!
❤️
Yay rainbows!!
I love thiis giirl!
We love you, Hannah!
Hang in there ! :D
TRUTH.
Canceling my Hulu subscription. I'm so sick of this political crap being forced down or throats.
We don't love you Sarah Silverman. You're a smug, divisive libtard. Oh Yeah and Christians haven't forgotten you said you would crucify Jesus again. God help you....you need it. Also, I heard you're supposed to be a comedian....yeah right.
A new contender for worst piece of Liberal propaganda since the Kardashian pepsi piece of crap we were assaulted with
‘I love big, fat pieces of shit’?! What discriminatory bitch.
Hey! A perfect time to cancel a Hulu subscription ship.
Too bad America fucking hates you, Sarah.
Why do americans need you to tell them what's in their best interest? I don't think the do as I say argument works.
Pathetic..Brown people dont need your reverse racism they can make it on their own...nice thumbs down lawl...you fake ass rich elite globalist trash can
vote for rich fucks? you mean HRC? yeah, i wouldn't ever do that.
Why does she not just die of anal cancer already?
Did she just womanspread at the beginning of the video?! Atrocious
Congratulations Hulu, you've completely alienated most of your customers.
What the hell is this crap?
Cant wait to hear about swastika spraying construction workers and the muh imaginary pay gap.
She basically said, Why can't you stupid, fat, racist nobodies from states I've never heard of realize that we Enlightened Ones are the most fit to rule over you? But I'm not an elitist.
Wierd how shes the voice of the glitch in Wreck it Ralph
The only words to describe this song are french. Atrocement putride.
She forgot to say she loved America's largest ethnic group. Germans.
kikedescending. you're not even white lol. what a hateful ignorant pot calling the kettle black. everything you touch turns to shit
Jesus Christ, Sarah! Seriously. What the fuck happened to you!?
Another stupid showbiz personality Insulting us, just what we need. Added her to the rest of the pile of rubbish (being polite) coming from hollywood.
Had to take breaks every once in a while during the video because it was that painful
SILVERMAN IS A JOOS JOO. AND SHE IS DOING WHAT JOOS DO. UNTIL WE RID OUR WORLD OF THE ZIONIST PROBLEM NOTHING WILL CHANGE.
>i'm a person just like you\n>why are you getting mad for trying to HELP YOU THINK\n>WHY ISN'T MY SOAP BOX WORKING\n\nall my favorite comedians and musicians use social media to scold people
Well done hulu, you have a winner on your hands.  Clearly the likes/dislike bar was hacked by russians.
i like the 2010 Sarah Silverman.
Is Sarah Silverman on the Alt-Right now? I swear this looks like a parody of leftism that they'd come up with.\n\nP.S.: Guest Spot.
Was this put out by Russia.
I'm slightly conservative and enjoy Sarah. I can't help it and always wondered if liberal comics want conservative fans.  I read about the intentions behind her show and it sounded like an earnest attempt to bridge divides. I'm skeptical but I'd personally give it a chance as a fan of hers. This skit seemed like she was poking fun at herself for being in a condescending bubble.
I think she completely doesn't get the point of America
sarah i'll admit i'm a mysoginist for everyone to hear if you suck my dick.
This has to be a parody of the modern day social justice warriors right?
You are the problem
This video is great! Love it! These racists are halarious,
Is there anyone more obnoxious in America.  Knock off the fucking cutesy baby-talk, ya dumb c__t
This is beyond pathetic, the virtue signalling is nauseating
Oh Hulu, you use to be not retarded but now you need to be put down.
Liberal virtue signalling is like sociopaths or robots trying to mimic human emotion.
Don't mind me guys, I'm just here for the thumbs down
YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW GOD AWFUL THIS SILVERMAN VIDEO REALLY IS
If u can’t cancel Hulu full time at least use it for half the year or less.   \nMaybe switch from Netflix to Hulu that way they only get half ur money.
Fuck you, you divisive bitch.  Yeah, you are the part of the problem, get the fuck out of this country.  Go try your bullshit in China and see what happens to you.  Try this for your next singing lesson, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8PYozPB-8I&t=24s
What moron thought this condescending piece of B-grade cultural marxism would be cool? I'm sure the average American is going to love being preached and screeched at by a pomo-facist bubble dweller with a net worth of millions, whilst it pretends it's one of them, and has their interests at heart so it can spread it's vilely divicive ideological poison.
I love you racist South...this kind of smug liberal nonsense is exactly why this country reviles the left and trump won
the absolute state of this country
This was a  love  message from Harvey Weinstein America to Blue collar America !
Wow....fuck you, Sarah Silverman. Just go fuck yourself.
How out of touch can you be?
Best  video response to this crap by Computing Forever: https://youtu.be/TIi_2SbrZ6w
Not even sure what this was meant to be, is it a parody or a parody of a parody? The Hollywood left's reality has become incoherent and indistinguishable from satire or satire of a satire.
Democrats should just stop pretending that they love America. We all know you aren't patriots so just be honest with yourself.
A rich person telling not rich people to not listen/vote for rich people... so PROGRESSIVE!
Good LORD that sucked. what a waste of time..
I'm a classical liberal (you know one that supports freedom and individualism) and boiii can i not stand these marxist, collectivist cunts. I say free helicopter rides for all these marxists, better dead than red
Glad too see you realize you're part of the problem. Now you can work on your liberal sickness and then the fact that you have never been funny. Never.
Yeah.......you can go fuck yourself,you contradicting pieces of shit.
You disgusting lecturing rich spoiled brat. This video is not even funny to say the least. How is lecturing anyone not the most vile thing a so called comedian can do? You suck.
A rich fuck, who supported a rich fuck, telling you to vote for rich fucks, and then shaming you for voting for rich fucks. She went from being a comedian to an un-funny harping propaganda agent for the establishment left. Some Weinstein in Hollywood probably put her up to being a propaganda shill in exchange for an advantageous career that stinks like hot garbage. She's being ridiculous. This is what it must be like in the fantasy mind of a self-congratulating SJW fellating themselves in public.
This is why Pepe is sad
Wow, just when you thought they couldn't get any dumber, or more out of touch. Congratulations Sarah Silverman, congratulations Hulu, you've just taken us to new depths.
Judging by the dislikes, America doesn't love you back. This kind of dislike ratio indicates America would unplug your life support machine in order to charge their phone.
My face is sore from all the back-hands this video has provided.  I guess I have no agency over my life and everything about me is determined by the tone of my skin color, my gender, where I live, and how much money I have.  \nEDIT: And how much I weigh apparently.
This is why Trump won and will garner another 8 years in office.  Thanks!
Member when Sarah Silverman did black face?
C R I N G E  T H E A T R E
Okay this song is pretty bad but most of the dislikes are coming from Russian/trump cult members.
The fuck is this trash?
This is the cringiest thing I have ever seen. I have never noped tf out of watching a video because of the overwhelming amount of cringiness, until now.
How dare she infer she is white she is a dirty dirty filthy stinking 4x2 show her the sun and her true features will become prominent she is part of the problem and not any solution unless it`s the final one
Every time a regressive leftist confuses cringe for comedy, a clown is born.
What the hell is this? Hulu you need to think before upload shit like this.
Sarah, how long did you and Jimmy kimmel know Harvey Weinstein was raping young women?
Thanks, now I have Aids
Pull a gun on a cop then see where your white privilege is Bitch!!!
This is a great song! Thanks Sarah!
That's my luxury, that's called white privilege\nUh, sweetie, your last name is Silverman.
Don't mind me, just here to dislike this video.
I hate how white people in the comment section assume that white people are the only ones who disapproves of this video. This video is very insulting the brown people as well. Don't assume everyone is white. It takes all types to hate the Left. 
Self awareness LEVEL 10 00000!!
No-Clue-Hulu...
tedious
so so so stupid
Those dislikes bar tho
trash.
No.
Reported for hate speech
This video makes me feel unsafe.
what a nauseating, whiny, manly cow
cringe
Kikes pushing harder and harder lmao.
What a racist sexist bigot.
fuck you
hot garbage
Remember where Hulu stands
Garbage
Shut up, stupid bitch.
#jewsarenotwhite
Coohoohoo-ringe
(((white privilege))), (((fellow white people)))
delicious triggered Drumpftard tears
ashraf ismail ? you're the best thing that could have happened to save the franchise!\nat the moment it looks like that this will be the biggest game ever made after the witcher 3, or maybe better ?im serious. its more beautiful than the witcher 3 100%! but will the story be as sick as witcher 3 ? DLCs looking so great! pharaos! mystic creatures!!! man only the way this game looks. omg so beautiful. dont need holidays in aegypt anymore, just play this game. i hope the gameplay/story will be as nice as it looks so far.
Ok, am I taking crazy pills or do some parts of the background music sound like Ezio's Family? if they're bringing it back as main theme, I'm stoked
I'm telling you. The game looks like Ryse Son of Rome fighting mechanics and the modes of the Egyptian mythology while Ryse did the Roman mythology. Ryse was the best game I played and I'm happy to see them re image ACO into a Ryse concept.
I wished this game will not have super - natural elements in it. What I got instead is huge snakes inverted arrows, now undead egyptian gods. If there are micro - transactions in it too I won't buy.
Assassin's Creed Origins is made with passion & lots of hard work. I think it's going to be the best game in the whole series. Ashraf Ismail has done such a great job & Egypt looks insanely beautiful in this game.
im sooo happy that i got the gold edition now
So do I have to get it on day one to experience all the daily quests and god boss battles or can I always replay them?
this looks too awesome, i love it and cant wait for 16 days
I like this Origins Ezio's Family tune
Trials of the gods <3
I'm not even joking when I say this has so much potential. They're going full-on RPG, taking cues from The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and even Breath of the Wild. My favorite AC game is currently Black Flag, but with how this looks, that just might change. I'm just hoping with all my heart that they don't f*ck up and disappoint all of us.
Why do you think anybody would be thrilled to see a trailer for DLC that we have to pay for before the game is even launched?\n\nAt least the free content sounds good.
DLC and the game isn't even out yet? How can I not think that they're doing that carving the game up to release it in pieces to make more money thing. Good to know that even if I shell out $60 I'm not getting the full game experience anymore.
So the animus is still a thing, then......
The Ezios Family Remix in the background is awesome!
You told us there would be no content locked in Season Passes from now*!\n*Which was like half a year ago.\n\nMicrotransactions AND day one paid DLCs, no thank you.\nThe game looks decent and the place you've chosen for it is perfect but I don't think it's gonna be worth it considering all that.
You made this look tight
+1 if you will take gold edition or gods edition i ll take one of them
post launch.....so the game is out already? idiots\n\npostlaunch in British\n(ˌpəʊstˈlɔːntʃ)\nadjective\nrelating to or occurring in the period *after* a launch
We want to constantly surprise our players - then don't go for the pre-order bonus BS, make all DLC free if it's integral to the main game (paying a little extra for something if it's a proper expansion pack is fine) and actually have a proper-length story with a rich mythos like AC1 & 2 especially like all the other studios that are determined to only see their players as wallets with brains - that WOULD be a surprise.
This game feels so about the brotherhood only i love it
this game is going to be killer cant wait for the 27th and ashraf is really proud for this game and im sure it will be wroth the wait
a bit less for a 50€ season pass or not?
Anyone know the name of the soundtrack in the middle that sounds like origins take on ezio family soundtrack from AC2?
I want to play as a female protagonist. Is this an option?
So is magic real in the assassin's creed universe now?
My guy. PC Day one, i'll be playing Mario Odyssey first but i'll be buying the season pass if this content is good.
Ashraf's team should be the perminant AC developer team or at least taking over the projects midway through for adding unique features and content i mean just look at black flag's features! this team literally changed the game for the better. AC2 still great though as a fan favourite game.
Major props. The Season Pass for this game is actually harmless, thanks to the free content. I expected The Mummy(pretty much) stuff to be a Season Pass-only thing. But its not.\n\nAlso, I like that they're just going nuts with these time periods now. I mean really, the Egyptian Gods will be a threat? Thats awesome, and its used in a way that makes sense in the AC universe, a glitch in the Animus(I bet Juno's the cause of it).\n\nWell, Ubiosft's going to have to make an AC game set in Ancient Greek now, so the Greek Gods can be a threat. Or how about an AC game set in Japan, with Japanese Gods as threats, etc. Just go all out with the ancient time periods.
omg pls let the photo modus include videoclips! it will make the content creator side sooo much better if you are able to do own cinematics
Hopefully we can get like Japan or China next,show Asians some love man,and we could finally sneak around as a ninja lol
This is going to be wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than Syndicate !
My god this looks incredible!
Take my money, idc I want it
Looks like I'll be busy playing Assassin's Creed origins and next spring playing the new Red Dead redemption 2
Looks promising finally Ubsoft is sticking to there promise this games looks awesome
Gold edition here i go!
Isn't gold edition releasing on 27 October then what about the DLCs
Ill wait for the definitive/goty edtion to come out
This is your last shot with me Ubisoft...do not fail me. I will pre order just because this was the team behind black flag. Be the glimmer of light in this dark time of venomous publishers and developers.
When Ubisoft make a series assassin creed in Indonesian historis?
OK now do this over, but without using the word content
Dlc-The mummy/shadow of colossus/exodus gods of Egypt vibes right here anything missing ?
I think this game will return like AC 1,2, brotherhood and Revolution or much better
This game looks incredible from the trailers. I hope they dont downscale the graphics 20% at launch but keep it as it is. Also I hope there is no bugs this time (like a guy without a face etc.) Excited!
i dont know if i can trust ubisoft again. But this looks really great. oh nooooo
the game isnt even out yet and they are doing trailers for the dlc how is this just not content taken out of the original game
Are the Roman Centurion and Horus skins both available on launch for those who got the Gold edition or will they gradually be released after launch?
DLCs are not bad they revive a game and make ppl talk about the game more earning money and players in the process so for the most part there are good but there's a difference between an honest dlc and cut content that didn't make it to final game
Ever since I watched the hilarious viral video How the entire world was made, I guess I had been really interested in anything on the first few centuries where the Roman, Egyptian, and Persian empires were around. All of a sudden now this game has really peaked my interest.
YOU CAN FIGHT THE EGYPTIAN GODS?!
will season pass owners be able to play the dlc's right off when we install the game?
You can tell that these guys really dedicated themselves to this game and not produce some nonsense bullshit.
Season Pass before the release of the game?!
Man that 1:16 golden legendary bow though, it is so gorgeous. I can't w8 any longer
Jesus haven't seen a developer this passionate about their own game in a long fucking time.......really shows he's really proud of the content he's made......\n\nLong live the Creed..
This will be the best selling AC ever. Black Flag was awesome because of Ashraf Ismail, and this time he's proved that origins gonna break the records. Huge world and maps to exploration.
I buy cod games every year, and im looking forward to ww2...but ive had to choose between this or cod this year and I gotta say im even more confident on going with assassins creed origins! Man i cant wait to get my hands on this game! Thanks ubisoft, u guys are ranked 2nd on my list behind rockstar games as the greatest video game makers in history!
Really excited for 'The Hidden Ones' expansion. \nI always love DLC set after the main story
i'm glad that I pre-order the gold edition then !! 100$ worth it 4sure !! thanks for hearing us UBI !!
He looks life foseytube
Hoping it doesn't suck
I already bought the standard edition and I want to upgrade to gold with out paying the $100.00 for the game that I had already bought
Let me guess thier after king tut lol
I caaaaan't waiiiit
Yesssssssss
Soaking wet.
The more I see, the more I fall in love. I cannot wait!
Besides all this awesome stuff, I just cant wait for the soundtrack to be released too. The music on this video is epic.
Looks promising!
Epic Ac version
Platinum ? Here we go !!!!!!
To the gold edition players
This series explanation for everything is it's an animus glitch
So you're advertising a season pass, for a game that hasn't even come out yet?
HE SAID ANIMUS NOT HELIX YES YES YES
Can't wait
Giant enemy crab!
lol man blinked every 2 seconds...
Phát hành trên youtube vài ngày máy vậy anh
Are these expansions free?
I know the game hasn't come out yet but I'll ask anyway. Do you think i should play ac unity and syndicate since i haven't played them or skip them and just play this?
This is just wrong. Release the damn game first!! Then you can talk about the dlc. We need to enjoy the main course first before we dive in to dessert. A Shamefur Dispray.
typical money greedy Ubisoft. If you have a DLC trailer for a game that hasn't even been released yet, then you can add the DLC to the main game and even extend the release date. End this Season Pass nonsense you've completely brainwashed most gamers with once and for all
Ashraf Ismail u sold ure soul for some money.. what an unfortunate bargain
The game isint even out and Ubiseptic tank is already advertising season pass dlc and post content? Youre really putting the cart in front of the fucking horse aren't you? Delay this game and include all this extra content in the base game at launch.
why does this have to come out the same day as wolfenstein :( Space out the games people..!
Can i just preorder the game with the season pass? I dont want the deluxe edition and get those good weapons because i wanna farm good weapons and armor
Did they liturally just spoil that bayek doesn't die and the ending in this is one big happy ending?
Ashraf Ismail, why did you brake this game to pieces? allah babah & many dlc done.
Excited about the game and the DLC but my attention comes to focus on about 50 seconds in, the The Hidden Ones poster. Take a good long look at it, can you see what I see?\nReplace Egypt with San Fransisco\nBayek with Marcus\nThe other assassin's with Sitara and Wrench\nIt's clearly a recreation of the Watch Dogs 2 box art poster!
This content should be in the main game, not be DLC for payment.
Enemies bigger than a  house .... this is not Assassin  Creed anymore...
Shut up and talk about PC PORT!!!
Remember when you would pay $60 and get the full game?
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESENT DAY STORYLINE?
The combat before wasn't perfect but at least it made you feel like a badasss assasssin, this combat is ugly and boring
Dlc dlc and dlc. This is why i prefer piracy.
It's not free content if we're paying $60-$100. In fact, what you should be saying is Season Pass and Gold edition buyers will be receiving stolen content. Content that was intentionally removed or left out of the game, content that is supposed to be included. I'll pirate it and rate it zero stars from Amazon to Metacritic. You're greedy scum bags, I hope this game crashes and burns like Unity.
I'm proud to announce that we've decided to rip content out of this game, and make you pay for it! I'm so proud of this, I couldn't possibly be more proud. Now pay up.\n\nNah man, y'all can keep your whack business practices.
I have PCOS and I still struggle with body image because of the side effects of it so I really appreciated seeing Leena's attitude and it was really inspiring and I don't know it just made me feel better so <3.
Insulin allows cells to take in glucose, which is used as fuel and allows the cell to function properly. So actually, when your body becomes resistant to insulin (meaning that the cells wont recognize it, and therefore they wont take in the glucose), it produces more insulin to try solve the problem. And this leads to diabetes.\n\nAlso all women have follicles where the eggs grow. Normally, an egg is released from its follicle every month (ovulation). However, in women with PCOS, if the follicle fails to open and release the egg, the fluid remains inside the follicle and forms a functional cyst (which is different from cancerous - is that the word in english? - cysts)
i was diagnosed about 4 years ago and my doctor explained it to me like the NHS explains it, and she did add a bit of history saying that some years ago doctors did though they were actual classical cysts. so thats probably why lena was so confused at the beggining. xx
Human DNA has been evolving to out a strand of genetics that has been dominant in history that is the underwritten Alzheimer's gene and people under 25 have evolved just enough through Selective Breeding to remain free of the Alzheimer's gene or DNA strand, people over 24 report losing memories at age 27 and then they begin committing crimes as well as making headway in developing criminal syndicates that work with the government and they start families and become heterosexuals
I'm currently being tested for PCOS. I'm 27 and it's taken 10 years to get to this stage, my extremely irregular and very painful periods were always blamed on being overweight. I had a scan and apparently don't have anything on/in my ovaries leading my GP to tell me I don't have it. However another GP at my practice told me  I have all the other symptoms and the cysts are just one symptom. I finally have an appointment at the hospital with a specialist in November. Doctors drag things out and Ness you around so much. If you're even a little overweight that's all the doctors see at first, I've suffered for over a decade because the doctors didn't test me for anything. In fact this time I was told that apparently I had a blood test 10 years ago and the results were iffy but I was never told, it was never followed up and nothing happened about it. I'm just glad I've finally got some answers and can attempt to move forward with things.
I was told by an insensitive doctor when I was about 15 that I may have PCOS. I was a fairly late bloomer when it came to periods and they soon became irregular up to 6 months or so. I have a lot of dark hair which I assume was just hereditary and I always yo-yo'd with my weight. It was terrifying being told that I couldn't have kids but this doctor said you never know because the likes of Victoria beckenham suffer with it and look at her (the fuck?) I had no idea what it was and felt like my womanhood was taken away from me. I had scans which came back boarder line and now I'm 22 and still have no idea other than I *assume* I'm ok. I'm careful with what I eat (especially with IBS) my periods are regular from taking Yasmin years ago but the growth in facial hair is insane. I epilate / pluck after years of shaving (I know) and it's a constant struggle - my hormone tests showed nothing obvious but I definitely feel something isn't right. Waffling over :(
I also have PCOS and I am not on any contraception. I treat mine with metformin which is also used for diabetes and helps control my blood sugar.
This video is also really relatable, I have IBS, eczema and chronic back pain so I know what it's like to have a weird love-hate relationship with my body. It does amazing things for me but also fails at the most basic functions. It's been a journey.
Both of you ladies look GORGEOUS in this video! ❤️
I'm sure someone will have suggested this already but have you thought about doing something similar for endometriosis? The comments show how many people this video has helped and I know how much it would have meant to me as a teenager to have something like this for my condition. Anything to raise awareness of endo helps as many of the symptoms are dismissed as just bad periods and it can only by diagnosed via laparoscopy. As a result of this, diagnosis takes on average 7 years and is a long and emotional process that no one should have to do on their own.
i have pcos, but i am not overweight or anything and i didn't feel any like 'bad symptoms' so far. But i went to the doctor lately and he basically told me: Your overies look bad, not sure you will be able to get pregnant, you have PCOS. Badabum. i was like: wow, wtf, thanks for your sensitivity... :(
was always playing the mum in theatre because I was chubbier - omg same
Oh my God I was 18 when I was diagnosed. Leena's story hit so close to home I wanted to cry a little. I'm so glad we aren't alone. Love it when the doctor's say just lose weight. Like we don't try. \n\nAlso totally had that moment with the childbearing. I had always assumed I would have kids my entire life; then at 18 when I was told by my doctor that I probably wouldn't be able to have kids, I had a 5-6 year span where I told myself I didn't want kids (I think because I assumed I couldn't have them). Now, only in the last year or so, have I started wanting kids again, I think because I'm in a relationship where I feel loved and supported no matter whether we have kids or not. It's very weird.
I have PCOS but was never told I had cysts. Just have irregular periods, high male hormones, extra body and facial hair etc., I don't get a lot of weight gain as I have an eating disorder but that also contributes to irregular periods and body hair! No doctors can give me a definite answer which is annoying so I don't really know what's happening
I had the irregular periods, painful, bad acne and weight gain but the mood swings/ bad depression was worst part for me. Pill helps but also causes symptoms of anxiety and depression?!
perfect timing for this video, just found out I might have PCOS
The NHS basically only recognises the diagnosis of PCOS as a woman who has excess hair growth, high testosterone, is overweight etc. HOWEVER- PCOS can also be associated with other hormonal issues that basically just aren't recognised by the NHS. A relative of mine has been diagnosed with PCOS and I haven't yet but experience many of the same symptoms as she did before treatment. Neither my relative nor I experience any of the traditional PCOS symptoms: we are both slim, little body hair etc. with low oestrogen but not high testosterone. The low oestrogen wreaks havoc on my urinary tract because it changes the PH balance of the area causing it to be more alkali and less acidic (should be slightly acidic) as well as a myriad of other contributing problems such as less natural good bacteria etc. This causes me to get UTIs very frequently with no cause and other bladder related pain and issues. This can be extremely painful day to day and incredibly debilitating. My relative was the same and also had other symptoms, however in order to be diagnosed she had to see a private doctor, since no nhs doctor would test her or take her seriously. They even told her it was all in her head and she was just making it up, and I've had similar experiences with nhs doctors. They simply don't recognise other forms of hormonal problems in women and its really awful and upsetting when you are essentially living with chronic pain, to not be taken seriously by doctors whose job it is to help you with your health. When my relative was tested- lo and behold, clear markers of hormonal problems, but NHS doctors hadn't even bothered to look. Luckily with support from family she could afford to pay for a private doctor or else she may have had to live with pain and may not have even been able to have children. I believe this lack of understanding of the female hormonal system is largely due to sexism in the NHS and just a lack of care and concern for women's health. It is truly despicable the amount of pain the numerous NHS doctors have caused my relative, and my own experience tells me this is not merely a few rogue doctors- It is simply policy to ignore women in pain.
I remember before i got diagnosed with PCOS and i had to have an ultrasound on my ovaries but there was never anything on them and i went a few times , so once i finally had my glucose checked did i find out i have it
I think this was super informative and really interesting. I have CFS (google it) and because its so untreatable and unknown, every single time i learn about some new illness/disease, im like oh i could have that!! It would explain this and this and this! I switch into hypochondriac mode, but only because im always desperately searching for an explanation as to WHY im like this :/
this video is awesome! i have pcos and went through so many of the same experiences (diagnosed at 15, put on the pill, attempts to remove hair and lose weight and such) and it's great that you are talking so openly about just accepting your body the way it is. <3
I have PCOS. Got diagnosed this year (I'm 25) and now I just got a letter in the mail about how I should get a flu shot because I'm in some risk group and Im like what risk group... the diabetes one or? I guess the diabetes one. \nAnyways. I got diagnosed because once I got off the pill (because I forgot to take it and was just waiting for my period to start again) that I was only on because of my hairy problems.. and then I didn't get my period for 2 years. Went to the doctor after 3 or 6 months or whatever and she was like come back in x months. So I came back and they were like you might have pcos let's test it. And I read about it and I was like oh I for sure have that I have all the symptoms. But I didn't get proper diagnosed till this year because my gynacologist and doctor couldn't agree on how to test me at the time but then this year I went back and they were like oh no we don't need that you already meet the criteria just because you have the hair and the acne and the irregular periods. I'm like great well they could've told me that 3 years ago. But I think the criteria changed as well. Anyways. I'm trying this dairy-free, gluten-free, soy -free, low glycemic load diet but it is hard because I hate cooking and i'm in Hungary and I don't speak the language so how am I going to find all the things I need or how do I know if I can even have something lol. I tried laser for the hair on my face, it didn't work, only made it worse. Mentally it sucks because I just feel worthless like not only am I overweight, I also have too much hair everywhere and the acne doesn't help either. Kids I am not too concerned about I don't really want them.
Having PCOS,  for me it's about not letting it define me. In the back of my head I know weightloss can be harder, but I persist anyway. The youtuber Sarahs Day is a good inspiration for me because she's fit, healthy and happy and doesn't let her hormones rule her, and shows how she balances her body out.\n\nMine developed later in life and I just saw it as life steering me in a healthy direction. So I told myself I couldn't be like all the young people surrounding me - to stop with regular drinking and careless eating. Now I stick to yoga and whole foods. It's probably saved me from more serious things in the future that develop due to poor lifestyle choices.
(Not PCOS, but other medical complications)\nUgh yes when doctors are like WHEN you decide you want to get pregnant... , like I have told you ten times I don't, if I decide otherwise I will tell you.
Im very very happy to see this video! I too have PCOS. Was diagnosed as pre diabetic at 13 but wasnt diagnosed with PCOS until 22. Tall about a struggle!
Thank you for this! I was diagnosed with pcos a few months ago at the age of 25. I was completely terrified and relieved at the same time. I went undiagnosed for almost 10 years in those 10 years I would only get my period if I was on birth control. If I was not on the pills I would just not get a period. I knew absolutely nothing about pcos a few months ago. Seeing this now makes me more secure about having pcos and hearing more stories is amazing!
Maybe do a video on Endometriosis as well? Because it's so common and affects a lot of people. It's also a reason a lot of women are on the pill. I don't even have a diagnosis but my symptoms were really strong, so, as Leena, I was put on the pill long before being sexually active. I think it's important to talk about these kind of issues cause as you said in one of your previous videos, there's some kind of movement against hormones, but people forget hormones do a lot of other stuff on top of the birth control part. And I feel it's quite disturbing when people just assume I'm some kind of sex addict or whatever when they find out I'm on the pill, even if it's just medicine for me.
I had a lot of the symptoms of PCOS but the ultrasound only showed a small sac on one of my ovaries so they came to the conclusion that i dont have it, finding that out was hard because i thought i had finally found an explanation for my symptoms when i hadnt
I really like this series. I have learnt a lot of things from this I didn't know in depth about. Especially today's episode has made me think to go and be checked myself as I have had a few symptoms of this. Xx
ye i have some of these symptoms but idk if i should go get checked or not?
I have it and live in and the US, I lost both of my ovaries to tumors and that's how I found out I even had it! Fun fact losing ovaries does not end the condition. Loved this video I have had such a hard time finding real information that wasn't geared towards women who are worried about getting pregnant which when I search for info all I get is fertility information which makes me feel doubly awful because I obv can't get pregnant so I do not care and it makes me feel like my only function in life was to be a baby factory. It's just so frustrating sorry to vent!
I love love that PCOS is being talked about more, like so many people I was diagnosed when I was 15 when nobody really knew much about it and talking about it was taboo but videos like this mean we can all learn more about our bodies and feel ok talking about this shitty syndrome ❤️
Thank you so much for this!!! Such a lovely surprise in my subscription feed xx Love both your videos!
I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 14 (I'm now 23). I was put on the pill (Dianette) too.  I have excess hair and weight gain but didn't know about the other things (insulin etc). Good old NHS choices. This video was reassuring! Thanks for talking it.
People still listen to Good Charlotte?
Did they give you something like glucophage when you were first diagnosed?
I have PCOS and I was nodding my head all through out while Hannah's reading the symptoms and description of PCOS 😂 I was like yup.. ahuh.. true, true.. 😂😂😂
I feel so deeply for little Lena and her male doctor experience. I also have PCOS that was diagnosed at 15 and I had a TERRIBLE male doctor that told me I was fat and if I didn't lose weight to where he thought I should be that he would fire me as a patient. This is the same male doctor that told me (at a later date) that I would just never be able to have kids. I eventually switched to a new doctor that was completely horrified by his behavior.
I relate so much to not knowing that much about your illness! I have Crohns and I'm only slowly learning what it is and getting better at answering people when they wonder what it is. It's weird when people ask you about your illness and you can't really answer, but I'm not interested enough to go read about it haha..
Thank you so much for doing this video!! I have PCOS, and I'm also resistant to insulin, but I had no idea they were connected! I just thought I had made some really bad nutritional decisions as a kid and didn't remember or something. But hey I suppose it's always good to check up on what you thought you knew every now and again lol.\nAnd yeah the symptoms are shit. It would usually mean I missed a few days of school every couple months or so when periods DID happen. Now I have a hormonal IUD (Mirena) and it's actually been helpful so far? The pill I took in high school was shit, so I'm really surprised this is working out so well!\nAlso of I remember correctly, I think depression and vitamin D shortage are also correlated with PCOS? It's ridiculous how much of the body is interconnected.
Oh, just for the confusion, the 'cysts' are actually vacuums. Basically, the egg is produced within the ovary, but people with PCOS don't release a hormone that allows it to follow through to the fallopian tube, so it becomes a vacuum instead. These vacuums can build up and replace important tissue, making people with PCOS infertile, so that's why it's so important to see what your options are!
I haven’t been diagnosed with PCOS but I was put on the pill to get rid of ovarian cysts. I also had really bad pain while on my period and it was very irregular. The pill actually helped a lot with both 👍
Hannah, it would be lovely if one of these videos was about retroverted uterus. I have it - It shouldn't be a problem in having babies or anything like that. It's just your uterus being in a different position than it should be. It caused me a lot of pain - during sex, during using tampons. It's because these things are touching my uterus. Now, I'm trying to use the menstrual cup. It doesn't cause any pain, but i've tried several different cups and they still keep leaking, even after a year I've been using them. They told me it's got a thing to do with me being a different shape down there. \n\nI didn't know about it for quite a time when i was younger and i kept wondering why certain positions hurt sooo much.\nIt would be lovely, if there are more young ladies, who maybe haven't been to gynecologist yet, to know about this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I was diagnosed with PCOS 4 years ago and struggle to find people talking about it. \nI'd like to share that I feel like my doctor told me nothing, most of what I know is from my own research which is very annoying when you find conflicting information online. \nIt's not something that really effects me, I have all the symptoms but I've learnt to live with them. However, when trying to lose weight is when I notice it most. People around me seem to drop 2kg in a week where as it will take me a whole month to lose that much, its so disheartening and my mental health suffered because of this. I saying this so others don't feel alone and also if anyone has any tips please please please hit me up! ❤️
Thank you for making this video! I was diagnosed last year at 20 years old. I didn't get my period until I was nearly 17 and they've always been very irregular, but I was missing other common symptoms like insulin resistance, high androgen levels, and being overweight, so none of my doctors checked until I was 20. They did change the definition of PCOS recently (not sure how recently), so now you only have to meet 3 'criteria' to be diagnosed (acne, irregular periods, and ovarian cysts were mine).
I always thought the fluid filled bags were what cysts are 😌
I have PCOS. It took me years to find out what was wrong and even after that managing it has not been fun, especially as all doctors see is my weight. When I was 15/16, I went to a doctor complaining of stomach pain (most likely my uterus but I was still learning about my body) and irregular periods that were heavy and leave me unable to function. Doctor looked at me, pointed out my weight gain near my middle, acknowledged my irregular periods, commented on my excessive hair and noted my high insulin levels. All of these are key symptoms of PCOS. Instead he told me to loose weight and gave me some samples for my stomach pain. So I left there, changed my diet and still a year later nothing had changed. I gave up. Till I turned 21, when I complained about the same thing and was finally diagnosed. Problem is I went on the pill and my reaction was really bad bleeding and resulted in anaemia and A hospital visit. 4 years since then and I haven't got it sorted or anything. I've also added the lovely issues of depression and anxiety, two common mental health conditions that PCOS women are more inclined to have. So I've had PCOS playing with me for a decade now (possibly even when I was 12, but that may just be growing up fun) and it's still changing and challenging me. \n\nDespite all this I'm learning, and with each year I learn more about this condition and how I can cope with it. So to any one suffering from PCOS or any symptoms that they feel is real and more then just a weight or age thing, seek out alternative advice if you can, until YOU feel better about yourself and are satisfied. And be willing to learn along the way. Good luck~!
Thank you for making this video. After being given conflicting messages following my diagnosis it is hard to know how to manage it. Especially when you’re told just to lose weight when its easier said than done.
Where did u get your shirt from ?
OK. wow. Leena is so right? I have a primary ovial insuffience (no idea if thats the name, im german so thats the literal translation) and been diagnosed when I was 15, because I hadnt gotten my period then. And untill today (age 20) i have never even googled it because fuck im afraid. It means I dont get my period naturally (Im on the pill now, so now I do) and I 95% wont be getting pregnant ever. And that shit is scary. But what I want to say: thanks for making this. Just having someone talk openly about conditions /illneses that are just in the slightes way like mine makes not feeling shit so much easier.
This was actually pretty interesting. Thank you for putting in effort to educate us viewers. Especially young viewers like myself (14 yrs,) it’s super important.
My nan had PCOS and so even though I dont have any symptoms I always worry I won't be able to have kids as I've always wanted to. Probably no need to worry though but yeah
So relatable... I don't have PCOS but I had ovarian cancer at an usually young age (14)... With only one ovary left I've battled huge hormanal changes, lots of different pills and lots of (male) doctors giving me their own opinions on what I should do with my body. Frustratingly, my doctor refused to put me on a pill after my operation, as he thought 14/15 was too young to be on it so I essentially had period for about 2 years straight with IMMENSE PAIN. After lots of trials on finding a pill that actually regulated me I was put on Diane35 - which is the same as Dianette I think - which as far as I know is used for acne, but is banned in some countries, causes blood clots and has a huge link to depression. And I've been on that for years. Yet no matter what, doctors can't really tell me what the effect of any of this has? I've been told that my 'time limit' for babies is shorter so I better be a mum quicker (ew), yet no one has answers for the long term effect of a heavy pill, or why my period was irregular after my operation, or why I suddenly had immense period pain (that still continues with the pill, and hurts despite taking opiates?). PERIODS ARE FRUSTRATING ): \nBut this series is great, thank you Hannah for continuing to care about women's bodies and inform the world xx
I have been diagnosed when I was 13 and had multiple doctors since then. I have always had a problem with my weight even though I was in semi professional dancing group and at the same time in aerobic team at my uni. I want to share two thoughts that might help smb:\n1. It's common to have too much insulin as it is not efficient and this excess it the reason for extra weight. As insulin makes you put on weight, you produce even more of it. Last year I started taking Glucophage and it helps a lot. I lost nearly 10% of my body mass, by just taking it (no changes in exercise and diet), also I am less hungry, more energised and productive, so totally recommend talking about it with your doctor.\n2. My  other doctor suggested that it is easier to get pregnent after withdrawal of the pill as your period is regulated. I haven't tried jest though, so cannot say from experience :p
I got diagnosed with PCOS just last summer. \nI had come off the pill in october because I wanted to see if that would help my mental health since I'm  person who is very susceptible to depression and such. I then had a very long period for all of november and then it just stopped in december. I didn't have any periods at all and I only thought to tell my mum when it was almost summer again. Coming off the pill was absolutely horrible for me. I felt my mental health destabilize even more, I gained weight despite making an effort to do some exercise, I grew more bodyhair which was also quite dark and thick. \nSo eventually, I went to see a doctor. First one I had basically did the same as told here 'oh you're fat so you need to lose weight and it'll go away'. She didn't explain what was happening very well either. I was just so confused. That was my first time ever seeing a gyno and I'm glad my mum was with me because she pushed for the doctor to give me something to help me along. I'm an overweight person, but not overly so. And my mum knew that, and she knew I was trying to lose weight before but that it wasn't working. So, they gave me an extra heavy pill and I was on that for a few months. Until I went for my follow up exam with another doctor.\nHe seemed a little cross when I explained what happened last time and basically I went in there and he explained properly what was going on in my uterus and such and then said I don't HAVE to be on that heavy pill, I can just take the regular one I was taking when I first started taking the pill. \n\nEver since then, I've been feeling quite alright. My body has gone down in terms of swelling, which was the main thing for me. I couldn't stand it because I knew something wasn't quite alright with that. My mental health is in quite good shape which is making life a lot easier. It's been good since that last visit.\n\nIt does scare me a little tho, that you say you're pre-diabetic. That's something my doctor did not explain to me. My mum has diabetes so I'm already at a higher risk for it. I do get check ups every four years for a research they're doing around diabetes and how it affects offspring. So far, so good. But good to know that's a thing to look out for. She has type 1 so it's a lesser chance I'll get it too just because of genes, but there is still a risk.
As someone who has been diagnosed with PCOS since she was 13 I'm so happy that there is finally a video on it that says how while it is something that we have to live with, and while it does affect our lives, it doesn't really control us and we find our own ways of how to deal with it and still be cool as fuck human beings <3
As an older woman with both Pcos and Endometriosis i enjoyed  this video so much. I also do not want children, ( lucky really) ) The weight is a big issue for for me, even though  i am a size 10/12, i exercise  a lot and eat well. I have been having laser hair removal for the last year, although it does come at a price.... it is sooooo worth it!! I wish i has had it done years. ago.
I have this too!! I was diagnosed when I was twelve but not really officially, it was just suspicion with no follow up. When I was 17 I got checked again because my period is all over the fucking place, early this year.  It's so weird how there's no tablets or anything to help the release of eggs for people not wanting to get pregnant. No method to help me has been suggested so im assuming there is none?\n but that in itself really pisses me off 1)because there seems to be a trend in misinformation or lack of information and 2) because it communicates to me that there aren't any people researching what can help PCOS.\n I have my period with week - two week long gaps and i would like that to not be a thing and have made it clear in the first case that my period was a problem I would to sort out - yet all medical professionals seem to be doing with PCOS people is just remarking o thats funny, sending us to whatever external office to get tested, then just leaving us there to sit with with syndrome. This condition isn't horrible or urgent, but still is effecting me negatively. I mean have 2 events of 6-9 day  periods a month, more money spent of sanitary items and less time to be sexually active (my country isn't as accepting of period sex :( cry) leaving me and others pissed off and helpless. arehg;erwh yluhtgur.
Im really struggling with my pcos atm\nThank you for this
They often prescribe metformin to treat PCOS, which is originally for diabetes. It can help with the weight.
my best friend has PCOS and i love that more people are talking about it on youtube
I have many of the symptoms of PCOS, that is irregular periods, difficulty losing weight, insulin resistance, facial hair around my chin. Because of this I had the ultrasound to see, to which my doctor at the time said I didn't. When I went to a gynecologist for a second opinion he said that doctors are constantly arguing over what the definition of PCOS, and that they can never come to an agreement. For me, I get very frustrated, and sad and embarrassed because I don't have an answer on what is going on with my body. I don't feel like a girly girl and that bothers me and i often feel like I won't ever be able to find a guy who is going to understand this. It would just be nice to have an answer on what is going on with my body.
Needed this. I have it too and it's great to hear others about it. I don't have any symptoms except for having no period, so im kinda lucky.
Uhhhhmmm I'm freaking out a little bit because by watching this video, I'm pretty sure I have pcos... like literally everything she's said I've experienced, besides all of the pill/coil experiences.
I didn't know about PCOS until Lena posted her first video on it. Those symptoms she described were the ones I had! I went to my nurse practitioner and asked her about it. She put me on some form of the pill (don't remember which) in order to get my periods to a regular schedule. I took those for a year and it did not help my brain. I already have anxiety, and the pills pushed my anxiety to unhealthy levels. This last February, I got an IUD (Skyla, low hormones and made for uteruses who have not given birth). Since, my PCOS symptoms are slowing down, my mental health is better, and I've began to lose weight!
Is PCOS ever considered an intersex condition?
Your friend is so lovely and positive. It gives so much hope for her to say that she shaves w her bf and it's fine. Like, all of us hairy women out here being told we're not attractive bc of our facial hair can see that we can be loved. Thank you for this video
Wow! Facintating! Thank you for sharing all this good info on PCOS. I have it but not the symptoms other than shooting pain when ovulating. Wheee!
I was recently diagnosed with PCOS about 2 months ago. I'm still in denial about it, hoping that I can change it with diet, exercise and anything else I can try. I'm seeing a naturopath and after having my bloodwork done, he didn't see anything related to the typical hormones surrounding PCOS as being a cause for it. Instead, he saw that I had low vitamin D and iodine levels, which are things that contribute to hormone production and regulation. I've been taking vit D and seaweed (high in iodine) for the last few months, limiting soy products, and exercising more. I'll be getting my blood done in the next few weeks, anxious to see my new results!
I found out 12 years ago (when I was 16) that I had PCOS and I can definitely relate to Leena's entire experience because mine was so eerily  similar. I was told at 16 WHAT?! YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR PERIOD YET?! SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH YOU!  I was forced to go through many uncomfortable tests (including the ultrasound where I almost peed on myself too) only to have the doctor's say You have this condition. You might not be able to have children. You have extra testosterone so you will be fat, hairy and oh get used to that acne because it's here to stay. You are at risk for several health conditions including diabetes & cancer. You need to accept that now. Oh you want a treatment? have you tried losing weight even though I just told you that it will be almost impossible to do that. Oh and even though you've never even kissed a boy yet, here, start taking these birth control pills maybe they will help your hormones. Sorry Bye. It's a difficult thing to come to terms with as a 16 year old especially in the midst of severe mental health issues I was also dealing with at the time. I've learned to manage my condition (badly at times) over the years but it makes me feel so much better when people try to educate themselves about the condition like you have because it's not just something that takes a toll on your body but on your mind as well and having support around you in the form of family/friends can ease the heavy burden you carry around everyday when you are a PCOS sufferer. <3
I have PCOS. I only found out because I had my period three weeks on one week off for 4 months in a row, then found out I had high levels of testosterone. No cysts though. They gave me birth control and I haven't seen or heard from my period again, which I'm loving.
One of the scariest moments of my life was when my former roommate who has pcos had a large cyst burst. She started feeling the pain about 830p. It took until about 915p to talk her into going to the er. We were there until 5a the next morning. It released something into her system that almost killed her. Always take these issues seriously please!
My mom has PCOS but will never really talk about it. I've learned so much, thank you!
THANK YOU FOR THIS 🙌 I was diagnosed with pcos about 6 years ago and nobody talks about it.
I don't have the Syndrome, but I do have Polycystic Ovaries, so the symptoms aren't as harsh with me. But it's really nice to see someone else's experience! I found out about mine because I had very severe acne and after an incredibly strong treatment that worked wonders, some of it came back way faster than it should've. So I had the same exam Leena had, which is an ultrasound with you on the verge of peeing and my treatment was (is) being on the pill. It did help a lot though because my periods were always sooo irregular and painful (so SO painful) and now I feel almost nothing and know exactly when it's gonna pop up, which is GREAT. So yeah, just thought I'd share my experience as well since someone might have more mild symptoms like I had.
I have PCOS. Thank you for bringing awareness. ❤️
Hannah and Leena, you both make such informative and insightful videos. Thanks for putting this out into the world!
I went off the pill at the start of the year and have followed along with this series ever since. My doctor has suggested I get tested for PCOS as she have some of the symptoms.
Doctors are supposed to give accurate, reliable and current information. \nSo many don't do it though.
Hiya Hannah :), \nIm really loving the hormone diaries i find it interesting that hormones effect everyone in so many different ways!!,  I was wondering if you could make an episode on Turner syndrome i would really love you to make a video on the topic as its pretty rair for people to know of it :), its a condition effecting women in which i have . One symptom is lack of fertility, i have underactive ovaries which means im on HRT to get periods , i may need an egg donar when i decide to have children i dont mind as i will ask my big sister and  where i have a womb i will hopefully be able to carry my baby full term which i think i will be a really cool thing to share with my sister 😊💖🌼, sending  hugs hannah :) http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Turners-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx
I have PCOS and my doctor told me at 16 can't have children. I was half way through my second year at university I found out I was 9 months pregnant and didn't know I was actually pregnant but because of the doctors telling me I couldn't and having blood tests and appointment where no one picked it up, I had no idea. It really affected my mental health from not knowing and being told something by a doctor, so I can't trust them now. PCOS is something that's so difficult to manage. Thank you for sharing this video 💜
Great video for raising awareness xx
i was diagnosed with PCOS a few months ago and it's been such a positive ride since! so glad i finally got over the anxiety of the doctor and found out for sure i have it
OMG! This is sooo useful! I think I might have to go to the doctor.
For the past four years I thought I had PCOS. I was on the pill for almost three years and stopped around the same time as Hannah. My body also went crazy in the past year: irregular cycles, weight gain, light acne, my hirsutism got worse. My gynecologist examined my ovaries every three months. First they were fine, then they were polycystic, then fine again and then polycystic again. Then she got my testosterone levels tested which turned out to be normal. After that she said she couldn't help me if I didn't want to take birth control and that I could let my skin and hair growth be treated by a dermatologist. Instead I decided to see an endocrinologist. There I was tested very thoroughly and yesterday I got the results: I have no PCOS , I am insulin resistent. Instead of taking medicine, I have to change my diet, however no too drastically as I don't have to loose weight. So the insulin resistance causes all my PCOS symptoms. She said having polycystic ovaries does not necessarily mean that you have PCOS.
the “little treats” made me laugh because my disorder one of several under a larger umbrella condition and i joke about it choosing symptoms from a grab bag\n\nalso i’ve had one of those ultrasounds and it’s so awful. sympathies to anyone who has to go through that hell. \n\nive several friends with pcos and for at least one it went undiagnosed until adulthood and then made so much click into place with her, particularly the weight gain. we stigmatize it so much that people don’t always know to investigate medical issues. then again assuming that overweight people are unhealthy is a whole other thing. (note i dont equate pcos with being unhealthy, just it’s a medical thing.)
I have PCOS and it sucks cause I want kids so badly but I also know adoption is an option as well as other ways to have children. If I took a fertility test and they told me I was infertile or there is practically no chance of me conceiving naturally of course I would be upset but it's like you know? When you suffer from stuff like this you learn very quickly that crying about it won't solve anything. Of course you still do but after a good cry and feeling sorry for yourself I find it much easier to just move on with life. I suffer from Crohns disease as well so for me it applies to both. :)
This is a great video
I was diagnosed 2 yrs ago and I have always thought it was cysts on my ovaries
when you have a bottle collection with the same bottles.... <3
This was a really good interview. Hannah, I think this is a particular skill of yours - you're great at getting to the heart of the matter, past the surface and asking really insightful questions. Thank you Leena for opening up about it. There should be no shame! xx
as someone with PCOS, it's honestly really great to hear someone with a similar experience talk about it and being able to relate. Thank you for making such an amazing video :)
An episode on endometriosis would be really helpful. I was recently diagnosed 3 months ago, 8 years after i started suffering at age 15. I think its so important that people are aware of this condition and the impact it can have on peoples lives!
U are awesome
dis a good comment section. thanks fur geetin' peeps talkin'.
So interesting 💜💜
I thought it was Polycystic *Ovarian* Syndrome.
7:45 aww also Shrek reference <3
Leena, my love!!!
just diagnosed!
You DO get cysts on your ovaries when you have PCOS! The cyst forms when the follicle tries to release the egg and it cant so the follicle swells and turns into a cyst on your ovary where the egg should have been released.
What are your thoughts on Mike Ditka's comments?
Ditka, I can’t believe you said that after The Fridge, Payton, Singleterry and the rest of those Black intellectual human beings made you famous.  You sucked as a player and a coach.  They won the games and you received the credit!!!!!!!!!!
Mike Ditka is a draft-dodging POS.  Just fucking die old man.
Why in the world would any Black American protest the Symbol and Anthem of the AMERICA That Saved them from Slavery. America saved you!!! \nREAD IT:\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\n\nWhat you just read is the foundational message from AMERICA to all Blacks.\nIt just took the White folk a 100 years or so to submit to Americas Message of Freedom and Liberty.\nBy Protesting Americas Anthem your are Protesting against the one who SAVED YOU AND GAVE YOU FREEDOM.
Mike Ditka is just plain wrong. Too bad because I used to like the guy. Denying something is not going to solve the problem. The people in sports, that are attempting to bring awareness about a problem in America, are putting thier jobs and future on the line. They want America to be better. People like Ditka want it to be like it was.
Remember the good ole days when ESPN only showed highlights and sports contests? Let's make ESPN great again too
He hasn't been alive for 100 years. see that's that bs
race problems in America Whites hate blacks blacks hate whites. When will it ever end.
Wow, Max went all in.  Steven A. folds again.
maybe he means cfl ... canadian football ... not africa lol...
I never liked Mike Ditka.  He's always been an arrogant old racist bigoted nutcase.
It just shows that Mike Ditka is a ignorant ex football player/coach that's a racist. Plz keep standing and say racist shit so we know who u honky's are. If I was friends with him as a black man our relation would be over
Can't Have The Racist History without its DISCIPLES
kellerman is a liberal clown who always plays the bitch card and agrees with everything SAS says
Holy fuck I don’t like the kneeling during the national anthem but no oppression in the last 100 years? That’s fucking crazy.
we at espn think mike ditka uses 'classic kkk language', what do you think? well espn i think you can go fuck yourselves
Racist minorities always make false accusations of racism and oppression in order to GET something for free, or get AWAY WITH something scott free.  \n\nIt's always about GETTING, or getting away WITH, on the false premise of revenge for slavery.\n\nSlavery will always be the excuse for it, and anyone who resists the LIE will be falsely labeled as a Nazi racist KKK cracker.
It's The Truth all of you GO BACK TO AFRICA YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE RACE MIXING IS WRONG JUST ASK CASHES CLAY BIRDS OF A FEATHER.
End Affirmative Action and turn off Obama's schilling ESPN
ditka is a product of the racist rape factory, ped state \n\nputting a microphone in front of him is like interviewing a racist steak
first give Mike D credit for telling how he n others ignorant ,,dog smelling pig skin racist feel,,,now that's a racist comment ,,,but this what's got to stop,,it's not ment for every Caucasian ,,but only for the ignorant,,that the Elite created,,an it's time for ppl to wake up ,,,an realize who put it in affect,,,to keep ppl at odds,,,when weather gets bad,,everyone trying to help each other ,,which is how it should be,,because the system is worser than the weather!!
More liberal narrative....'racism is evrywhere'...'Trump is bad'....all to keep the black voters from jumping ship...sad ,blacks complain of oppression yet keep voting for the party that has done nothing for them
Hell, the bears have been oppressed the last 32 years. What is he talking about?
MIKE DICK is a fucking ignorant old fashion fart that's stuck in the 50s an is never gonna get it period
protesting the national anthem and our flag is the wrong way to go about what is being sought. Arlington National Cemetery is full of soldiers graves, Black and White, at least give them their due, we owe them.
We just had the first black president and he sucked ass so now all the blacks are pissed off at Trump. Obama couldnt even come close to reducing the 1/3 of black males who go to prison. Your black race is way behind in maturity and is not ready to lead a civilized country period end of story. This isnt a football game or a basketball game this is serious shit where we have enemies with nuclear bombs and terrorists. This shit is a joke we have athletes now who think they know how best to run a country. This is not the time for social experiments.
Ditka is representative of all the white people who still deny racism exists.\nIt's not that they really believe such garbage, it's that they are afraid that if they ADMIT there is a problem, that they will end up losing their privilege.\nThey would rather continue denying the truth so long as they are never forced to do anything about it.
Man Trump is letting all our heros come out the racist closet
Martin Luther King, a preacher who preached non-violence, was murdered 49 years ago. A man in his 40s was alive when his peers & parents were actively committing terrorism in the name of racism. This is the dumbest most racist & idiotic shit I've heard since this morning reading Trump tweets.
When did First Take become CNN/FOX News? Smh.
Fuck Mike Dicka...always knew he was a Racist. Fuck him!!!
Mike just needs to die please Mike die you piece of shit and let me know we're he is buried so I can piss on his grave die Mike die Mike!
Black ppl aren't OPPRESSED!!! TF? We have plenty of rights and can do whatever we want
I *was* a Packer Backer but now I LOVE MIKE DITKA.  At least he's got courage and conviction and he stands up to the pantie waist cry babies who turned a great game political.\nNFL can all stop playing for all I care, I won't watch.
Typical ignorant rich white guy. Your time is over guys, you generation is getting old and dying off. Just go off into the sunset you willfully ignorant fools.
I, at one time loved ESPN, Mike and Mike was my favorite all time sports show on radio and TV.  I even liked Stephen A. and Skip B.  ESPN has become the CNN of sports talk media.  Cancelling my Direct TV today.  Will never watch ESPN again. (Espn don't want whiteys support or viewership), WISH GRANTED.  Pretty much done with the NFL.

You don't like it ?  Leave the country?    There is a reason that those words are said time and time again.    The main reason is that people knows that those words hurts.    If you show someone your weakness then they will attack it.     If you stop worrying about what a football coach says and start worrying about providing for your family then the world will be a better place.     Sticks and Stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me.    White folks know how to push buttons because everyone who isn't White gets buttsore over words.   Call a White Man any name under the Sun and he will probably laugh about it,  call a black man a reggin niknits and all hell breaks loose.      Sticks and Stones will hurt a lot worse than being called a cracker.   Lol Has anybody ever gotten mad at being called a cracker.    Go to a black section of town and yell out  How are Y'all Porch Monkeys doing ?   and see if you don't get beat to a pulp.   Go to the White section of town and Yell Out  How are Y'all Honkeys doing?       Black,  Hispanic, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese. .... all of you people need to get more clever with your name calling because I know Y'all can do way better.    Look at how creative Black Men are with music. ......surely someone can come up with something better than  Cracker    .     White Folks don't get mad when you call us names.
I totally agree with Steven A, and I am from Chicago and I am a huge Ditka fan but this ignorance really hurts the mind.  Sorry Ditka but if your mindset is that far out of wack then I cannot support you.
Ro Fu your a fool has nothing to do with communism or capital has to do with basic human rights which you clearly missed. Kneeling before the flag doesn't disrespect it in any way. Many times people kneel in prayer or reverence. However when Kap or all these other player kneel they want you and these other people to take notice. Rather than sit down kneeling is a way to show respect but still protest. It's amazing that a act this simple doesn't affect the game at all could be such a problem. He and others clearly said they don't hate this country or the army. This issue with the flag seems to have triggered people like you but that is not our message it is  that we don't like the direction our country is headed.  No one seems to speak anymore thanks to your president Donald that we want cop killing to stop ! COPS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SHOOT SOMEONE AND JUST GET A SLAP ON THE WRIST WHITE OR BLACK. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FLAG YOU ALL ARE BEING FOOLED TRUMP IS TRYING TO DISTRACT EVERYONE FROM THE REAL ISSUES. HE IS TRYING TO DIVIDE THIS NATION AND YOU GUYS ARE LETTING HIM WIN. It's sad truly it is
JOE NAMATH SUPPORTS NFL PROTESTS, COLIN KAEPERNICK & PLAYERS\nhttp://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?noframes;read=85357\nGET THE WHOLE STORY
The flag is a symbol of a country where non violent protest is a basic freedom. To protest honors the flag. Strategically I think protests during the anthem are wrong because the protest becomes the issue instead opening up a national discussion about police over reach.
Full of crap
Fuk Mike Ditka dumb ass
A racist old white guy...what else is new.
Mike Ditka was 21 in the 1960s when the Civil Rights Act passed\n\n\nGeeh...I wonder what he thought about the Act.
Steven a should let max his skin lol he's more of a Blackman than Steven a
I saw those comments in my local tabloid and my jaw hit the floor.  I wonder if Ditka really knows how ignorant he came off.
Besides white, who is, Mike Ditka, and the people, who share his views?
What Mike Ditka thinks is actually irrelevant. Look at that dinosaur. He's him and his moronic way of thinking are going to be long gone very soon
national anthem was written by a Slave owner,  thats Talks of killing slaves tryna be free...
Don't play the national anthem at all.  Play the game.  Shut down the protest and Trumps tirade
Wht ppl look for opportunities to escalate it
I'm of the opinion max needs his own show on espn, and allowed to say what ever he feels. He is incredibly articulate and intelligent and seems to honestly love sports.
We need to wipe the history books of slavery, if  African Americans never knew they were slaves then they couldn't blame the white devil for all their problems.
Fat, old, stupid, racist same as Trump.
I am not surprised by Mike Ditka
United States President Donald John Trump: Talks tough, through tong twisted terminologies. Taking back America; Make America great again; 'Those disrespecting our country and disrespecting our flag.' Really? What country? What and whose flag? There is no American flag.  Don't he mean the national emblem and flag of the USA?! {Star Spangled Banner} http://usaa-plus-promise-lands.blogspot.com/\n....\nAMERICAS: AmericAfrindian ArtistCHD1, always wisely, acknowledges and accepts, and accurately articulates, as geographical land locations identified as, South - Central - North America.

Ask yourselves these simple questions?: where is black-land?, white-land?, brown-land? Really read research ref. Blacklan: http://black-klan.blogspot.com
Unfortunately a large chunk of the population agrees with Ditka and thinks he's 100% right. Civil war, Civil rights, voting rights, segregation, Jim Crow all hullabaloo about nothing.
Someone explain peonage to this clown Ditka... blacks have literally been enslaved within the last 70 years let alone 100..
You mean the same Mike Ditka that predicted Trump to be President, and you idiots are still butthurt! You are a fool to say anything against Ditka, he's in the hall of fame and you guys are? Insignifigant morons! Get of the slavery bullshit! Really? The dems are yhe original supporters of slavery and oppression and jim crowe you idiots! There was no slavery in the 60's dumbass!
Max u did it?!! Awesome job👍🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I’m proud to be an American now.😉
Can we get over this yet?
He hasn't seen oppression in a Century? One how old is he and two. Your rich and white and still have a fan base. You shouldn't see oppression unless you got lost in the wrong side of town.\n Furthermore Ditka grew up during a very turbulent time did he not watch Television in the 60s?\n He is attempting to still be relevant just like comrade pony tail. They should do a movie together like bucket list but called kick the bucket already.\n DITKA IS A CUCKOLD, I retract that statement so it's like it never happened, right?
Ditka's brain is a grapefruit.
Max u weren’t even around when it was going on just stop white boi
Ditka should be REMOVED from the football hall of fame... what a trump loving turd nugget!!
People shouldn't apologize for how they feel, they should express it. Some hoes just love to hear game.
ARE YOU SURPRISED HELL NO ! BACK IN 83 MIKE DITKA TRYED TO TRADE WALTER PAYTON BUT NOBODY WANTED HIM. HE DISRESPECT VINCE EVANS AS QUARTERBACK. HAD A CHANCE TO GET HALL OF FAME QUARTERBACK WARREN MOON BUT DIDN'T. HE IS SO LOVED IN WHITE CHICAGO THAT HE DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT WHAT WE THINK  OR SAY . BUT  KNOW THIS  MIKE DITKA THAT RESPECT YOU THINK YOU HAVE JUST WENT OUT THE WINDOW AND NOW HISTORY WILL SHOW THAT THE REAL COACH OF THE 85 BEARS  WAS  FUCKING BUDDY RYAN !!!!
It's really a waste of time to enlighten a racist minded individual it has very little to do with not being knowledgeable about the fact of Oppression in this country but has everything to do with having those people that don't look like you to have a glaring disproportion of Justice and equality I'm sure if the roles were flipped white Americans would not be nowhere near as patriotic as the Black African descendants of slaves that continue to build this country into one of the greatest country that is without truly being accepted or granted the very same rights as white Americans yes the laws are there but the justice is not I truly don't believe White America will ever understand and never will want to understand why so many black people here in America feel up the ghettos if they only knew how hard it really is I know many educated blacks will never work in there field of work because of the white you write rule Black you get back if you're Brown stick around may sound funny but it's the truth we as black Americans have adjusted to that system to a point that many look very content and very happy so white Americans pretty much think that they're happy why are they complaining they don't understand being turned down from a job a entire career because White fieldwork places refuse to have a staff work under a black supervisor and many times give the opportunity to a Hispanic to avoid lawsuits claiming there is your minority and in these cases they are white Hispanics. Racism just has evolved but hasn't gone anywhere today the most clear indication is law enforcement tells a lot about America we see communities where there there is 75% or more black minority and there's less than 5% black office in many places there are none at all don't even talk about the justice system when we still can't have a jury of our peers maybe one or two the most I don't see too many white Americans racing to live this type of life have these type of road blocks living under these kind of conditions me as a black man feel that you pretty damn lucky to be white in America we see more blatant racism because of the integrating of black and white relationship and a few blacks that are economically sound and moving into Suburban white neighborhoods and last but not least a black president which was mixed race which never was considering his White side of he's family shows you how segregated minded White America still is so we still have these problems after four hundred years Confederate flag still waving Confederate monuments were placed during the integration era to only keep a strong reminder of bigotry so yes America is the greatest racist Nation in the world that is clearly nothing two be proud enough to stand and pledge not even for white American who's truly conscious of its continued history a fallen short of is Creed that all man is created equal and justice for all
Mike Ditka in real life is a asshole..Thats saying it nicely..Hes rude to everyone
Name an oppression in the last 100 years and I'll show you first world problems
Mike Ditka needs to have his name pulled from the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  No one who's that ignorant and foolish should hold that honor.
It wasn't just blacks that were oppressed 100 years ago. So were women, so were catholics and so were other immigrants as well. Look it up Protestants 100 years ago were oppressing catholics up to WW2 pretty much.
The NFL is dying and this idiot is helping to throw dirt on it!
the true racists are showing there faces.
When Mike Ditka screwed Hof Walter Payton on the 1yard line in the 85 Superbowl I knew he was a clown.
There has been no oppression in the last 100 years...., says the white guy.😳
Looks like Mike Ditka finally came out as being ignorant  as FUCK...who knew?!
Dick head is a Trump supporter...enough said. This bastard wasn't shit as a coach, and ain't shit as a human. He has been a racist bastard way back when..the hell with him
Ditka is a racist bigot, always has been.
Just another dumb ass stupid racist Trump supporter...He has said stupid shit before...No surprise...Trump and Ditka went to the same old racist school...
SCREW YOU SMITH...YOU ARE A SERIOUS JOKE !!  AS LONG AS EVERYONE AGREES WITH YOU AND THE OTHERS .....THOSE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE HEARD??? JOKE....FREEDOM OF SPEECH BROTHER....AND WHEN WILL THESE PEOPLE CHOOSE THE PLIGHT OF THEM IS OVER....ENOUGH ALREADY!!
shove it up the ass of POLITICALLY CORRECTNESS...FOR IT IS 'ANTI CHRIST'...........THE FLAG HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHOM YOU ARE..........GOD CREATED YOU......NOT THE PIECE OF CLOTH THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO MAKE UNDERWEAR ...............DECIDE NOW......WORSHIP A PIECE OF CLOTH (the flag).....or WORSHIP 'GOD'!!!
I wish Walter was still here to slap the shit out of ditka
Mike dicker? 😂😂😂 Stephen A. Smith I heard you
Ditka is a dick..............................OK, I should not have called Ditka a dick, I should have called him an ignorant racist dick.
Fuck Mike ditka
Max Kellerman is a white cuck
FUCK  NFL.

Needs a stronger melody and Lying here in the sweet sahara is like something a sixth former in English class would write.\nB&S were always bitter-sweet, but this is just plain mawkish.\nI loved Nobody's Empire and some bits and pieces off the last few albums, but it does feel like they've kind of petered out creatively.
Beutiful 😍 Love it 😊 Come to Mexico someday please :3
Reminds me of the music from this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocd1D8fwdjU
Nice try to retrieve some of your original sound. Utter failure though, atmosphere is lacking.
MASSIVE Thank you for everyone supporting me and making a dream reality! TG
What a sound guy .
crystal palace are shit might come back to haunt you
Can anyone pinpoint the keane point
You know what. I'd love to see Geordie have a podcast with Lee Cattermole.
I loved when he said Bellamy was tiny and then Lawrence’s laugh was delayed and then he became serious instantly after
quality interview mate , genuine honest and interesting , lost in todays society not just football
Gowan geordie maybe one day I could interview you ! You interviewed your hero and what a podcast it made ! Keep it up this is just the beginning of what's to come ! 💙
Was very touched by this interview. I think TTG knows how much this means to all football fans in the area. Love.
missed this for ages.. great content. brilliant interview, (Barnsley fan)
Shearer is such a gentleman, no attitude issues or self-worship like a lot of the footballers have.
So happy for you!!!
Never really thought much of Alan Shearer, other than he was an incredible striker. Watched the full 2 hours and I think he came across really well. Good interview.
Talking about Leicester aswell. I'm in love. Shearer knows what we did was something to never be repeated.
As A Boro fan ... Enjoyed that ..I met Alan a few times when he lived next door to my freind in Wynyard ( Kenny Lowe now manager of Perth Glory ) Had a party one night and all the guys had come in Fancy Dress ,,,Well TBH dressed a women !!! Mr Shearer turned up in a lovely silver dress !!! He is good craic , Comes accross different on the TV ....England legend
Well done Geordie , good on you mate !
Respect man... Ive been subscribed to you since 2014 and to see how far you’ve come on YouTube is absolutely great. You’re my favourite YouTuber and you deserve all the great stuff that comes your way
Sir Bobby Robson wasnt in charge when bowyer and dyer had a fight it was soueness lol
Did they turn Laurence's mic off
My Idol as well mate, watched him when I was younger on the telly. What an experience that would've been Geordie!
This is a great interview.  Shearer is my favourite English striker, and the best that I have been play.  I am happy to see True Geordie interview his hero and keep it real.
Absolutely Class podcast mate, congratulations on realizing a dream TG, as a Newcastle fan, this was amazing to listen to.
Shearer was a TOP class centre forward who scored all types of goals and was infact underrated.
It's all about money, tell me I'm wrong.
Absolutely brilliant TG. Big follower anyways, but what a two hours. Gripping stuff. Mr Shearer is a true ledge of the English game and gave me fantastic enjoyment down the years. He put a 'shift' in here too. And he pulls no punches. Cheers guys. Manc Red since 79 n all. Keep up the gud work lad.
This is one of the best yet, i feel like i say that every week. TTGP doesn't set the bar....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHEY ARE THE BAR!!
it's sad to know that if truegeordie was a 5' 6'' matchstick with exactly the same mindset and views, he'd have like 10% of his current view pool\n\nanyway, there's always Iniesta =))
Should have asked his why didn’t he by the lads season tickets on purely belter
Great Podcast! Think you should have hat films on the podcast they are youtubers as well and think it would be a hell of a laugh
I've absolutely loved this interview, absolute CREDIT - to all 3 of you. A really well structured interview.\nWe all adore big Al, but we've passed judgement on his persona without really getting to know him. I think he bared his arse for us more than he had to - much respect.\nI love NUFC and I love Alan Shearer
Where are the fucking football hangovers?
why did you make it look like an interview
Can anyone with asthma answer this survey please. This is for my dissertation and everything will be kept anonymous. THANK YOU \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/6S2XZ9D
Great video but whos that other awkward chavy next to geordie
Terrific podcast, really enjoyed it, keep up the good work lad.
What a brilliant Interview. No punches pulled and raw AF. Loved it TG
absolutely loved this best podcast I've ever seen no doubt
can you do one about the big man's tattoo's..?..and another one about lawrence dick...oh no..that would only last 2 minutes...!!
Amazing podcast! Try and get Kai Greene on, that would be sick!
Great to see you talk with your hero.
class podcast genuinely proud to have been a fan for a long time. MICHAEL DAPAH or MR TRAUMATIC would be great guests
I know most people wouldn't like this comparison , but Alan Shearer looks a lot like Fred Durst to me
Shearer was a big part of why i started following NUFC, what a player. Great man too. Loved seeing TTG get the chance to meet one of his idols too. Great stuff. Keep at it fella. HWTL
Well in, TG. Happy for you. Being one of the realest youtubers out there, you immensely deserved this. The podcast was quite enjoyable and it was great to hear personal stories from Alan. Long may the King in the North reign. Your Empire shall hopefully soon have 1 million citizens
I am a Liverpool fan and I was so happy he turned down Man utd to go Newcastle and respect to him to turning so surely so many trophies to go to his boyhood club,he was a great player same never won a trophy with you.
As a fellow Newcastle fan, great to see you meeting your idol, such a nice, down to earth guy 👍🏻
Never watched a YouTube video for more than 15 mins.....until now. Shearer is a class act and great interview kid.
BEST VIDEO EVER!!!! nice to hear a few hope truths from wor al such a professional my brothers want to play for Newcastle and they graft there arses off every weekend please try and get my hero on Peter Beardsley for a talk  would be great to hear from him thanks guys keep the vids coming thick and fast C,MON THE TOON!
Class Brian how far you’ve come , excellent interview
Fantastic inrerview mate i couldnt think of a questione you didnt ask.\nBig al a true gent as always......the toons no1 ......
Wtf I went off for like 2 months and they've got Alan shearer on congrats guys
What an absolute show today, loved this as a football, Lawrence and Geordie fan
Wow mate, I used to watch you playing Fifa career mode like 2-3 years ago. Unbelievable. Congratulations my friend and keep this up. Some more Footballer podcasts are needed!! Keep up the good work.
So they're talking about Rafa, how he stayed, how he's brought them back to the premier league then Lawrence is like so what influenced u to retire Alan I'm sat here gripped with them talking about Rafa and he just back tracks, like, do u even know what you're doing m8? Wtf?
Brilliant interview!! I think Graeme Souness was the manager at the time of the Boyer v Dyer fight? Al said Sir Bobby would have been disappointed.
i very much enjoyed this interview with Alan Shearer. Made me remember when i was a young lad when i used to support Man Utd Lol
True Geordie has come a long way, he has to be hitting the 1m sometime in the next year.
Class!!! Shearer was my hero growing up and hearing him speak about all the things you want to know about is quality... cheers for an amazing interview.
Also sry my name is adam I don't have a YouTube account I am using my wifes account 👍
Got emotional when talking about speed. RIP speedo I remember the day he died I just finished a Sunday league game was devastated
So happy willne shouted this vid out in his twoti vid cause it didnt show up in my recommended
Louis Theroux would be class to get on 👌🏻👍🏻
Very emotional last part. But so happy to see my favourite YouTuber make it even bigger than before
Being a Blackburn fan it was great hearing about the good old days. Fantastic podcast as always Geordie keep it up. #VenkysOut
Top player the Germans feared him! Seems like a top man too. Well done mate on a. Great interview ☺
My mum dated Keith Gillespie when she was like 20
One of the best interviews on you tube awesome well done.
I just love Shearer, everything about the man.
So happy  that you finally had your hero on the podcast

Great interview.
Fantastic! What an interview!
big respect true geordie.... nufc fan from kingston jamaica
Plz do a podcast with richard ayoade
R.I.P SPEEDO LEEDS LEGEND \nOHHH GARY GARY GARY GARY GARY GARY GARY SPEED
Swear on my life im related to the Physio Paul Ferris< my second name is Ferris and hes my dads uncle and my uncle stopped Roy Keane from battering Alan after a united match
Wish I could speak Newcastle so I could understand them :(
I was 3 when he had his testimonial match I have it on DVD he's a true inspiration
The way the Geordie looks at the gay dude is so sweet. Great that these two are showing such a positive side of homosexual relationships. Well done!!!
as a Cork City born, American, who follows the 'Pool.     I love this, this is exceptional love of the game shit..... Respect big lad, I know what it means to you. Good work.
What a humble man Alan Shearer is.. He's also a straight talker, no bullshit and says exactly what he thinks. Not even a fan of Newcastle or shy of the teams he played for but so much respect for a good guy 👍\nMan I'd love a two hour podcast if you could get Paul Gascoigne on, imagine the stories he could tell lol.
Next...Kevin Keegan...Rob Lee...and when he leaves the employment of Mike Ashley...Peter Beardsley...make these interviews happen
I love you Bunny, but I have to agree with Dog Man, those glasses are as purple as the purpliest thing I can think of.

I like the way you've got the same fitbit strap as me 😊
Ahhh I love the Alice in Wonderland dresses and the Lolita style too!!\nEdit: Also I think the Gucci box lid was on wrong; the nothing matters was probably supposed to be on the same side as the (that) much
You two make me so happy.  Oh the glasses are purple, sorry Bunny
I love them together I need something like this in my life😭
The end of the video is beautiful : )
You are so cute together! Goals!

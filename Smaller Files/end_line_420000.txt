WHERE THE LBW SQUAD ATTTT!!!
Whats LBW can someone tell me
It´s a world that is already here.
What’s the music that starts around 4:58? If someone could let me know I’d appreciate it
I've watched this channel rise to the cream of the crop. Really impressed man keep going.
Future?\nI thought it was about the here and now.
Evan - wondering if you've seen the reddit theory that San Junipeiro doesn't have a happy ending. It's pretty compelling: the gist is that they don't both accept the upload.
you're gonna carry that weight
Duuude I'm on season 3 you just spoiled me Game of thrones!!
Great vid but I couldn’t enjoy it after Game of Thrones was spoiled
Why do so many people love nosedive it's literally just meow meow beans but worse.
meh black mirror feels too predictable to be interesting for longer than an episode or two (gee wow I wonder how THIS episode goes wrong! almost every time), at least 15 million merits had an interesting enough world but that's where the show peaked for me. yeesh, already heading downhill from the second episode lol\nsan junipero's okay but not mindblowing in the slightest
This video came out right as I finished the series, and it made me clearly aware of why I felt so connected to it. Thank you for this piece, well done.
I don't think the false catharsis is the main reason people watch the show; I watch BM because it creates a new reality every time, and creates a story in that reality. The reality is eccentric relative to ours, and the story is eccentric relative to that reality. So it comes off really mind blowing or interesting in the end, if you are less affected by the sadness stuff
Honestly thinking about it more, you put a SHIT tone of spoilers for shows that are completely unrelated. Breaking bad was completely ruined for me. I'm a huge GOT  fan too and i can only how PIIISED i would be if the red wedding was fulllly spoiled. Please, its only common courtesy. Give people spoiler alerts. Its difficult.  Please. ugh
I would argue that the genius of Black Mirror is that it rips away humanity's power over itself, depriving us of the comforting lies we tell ourselves that it will all work out in the end regardless of how we choose to live, even despite our best efforts. It's draw comes from the deep gravity this truth has over us despite what we want to believe. This show is self-flagellation, despite our progress and best efforts of intellect and modernity, our humanity, when indulged, is our downfall.
hell yea i saw this was a trending topic and i am so keen to see your perspective THANKYOU
I LOVED BLACK MIRROR!!! I'm waiting for the next seasons !!!
Yooo, you didn’t have to show the red wedding clip, that was hard to watch lol
But where is season 4?
Probably why San Junipero and Nosedive are my least favourite episodes. I still prefer Nosedive which could've been so much darker, it really felt like a missed opportunity, imo.
This channel is among the best employments of my money. Seriously.
Please add some sort of warning to this video. This is potentially-triggering material. I only had a vague idea of Black Mirror's plot so to speak and found some clips extremely disturbing. Typically I love nerdwriter's videos, so I am disappointed.
Black Mirror is unlike any show I have ever watched and I think much like The Twilight Zone, it'll go down as one of the most creative and engaging shows in history and one that is unlike any other dystopian or anthology series. I loved your Passengers rearranged  video, this was a brilliant analysis!
Love this show and I can see all this really happening.
I just started the show recently and it's so cool that this video is trending now
Everything in black mirror will eventually be real every thought becomes reality and technology aka ai we'll take over some day
I only like that one episode of black mirror with the lesbians bc it's so diverse and not depressing.thats why I love it
Because it is reality.
Why would you throw such a major Game of Thrones spoiler in there?
Go to 7:10 for a butt smack lol
U forgot to mention it shows our society. maybe u dont see it couse u r american and live in a movie. Future? It shows first world right now
The catharsis is this can happen now. The morals are how to be HUMAN.
Your channel is awesome! God bless you.
Absolute rubbish.  It's dark because of the main writer.  If you had watched him on British television before black mirror you would have seen his probing look into insights to eveyday subjects.  Plus the other thing British people have is a darker near black sense of humour which Americans don't have.  With them every story has to have an upbeat ending.
Our choice story is roughly , everyone dies and anyone that lives wishes they were dead . Enough said .
Need a new season!
Guys, the events from an episode of TV that aired YEARS ago is not a spoiler. Sorry but if you haven't seen it yet, that's not anybody's problem but your own. Are we allowed to talk about the episode of MASH where the plane crashes, or is that too spoilery for you?
Black mirror is fucked up, all the shit about the pig fucking in the first episode scared me of keep watching this sick show, mostly of Netflixs original content is pure garbage.
What Makes Black Mirror So Dark\nhttp://www.gokrs.gq/2017/10/blog-post_4.html
Black Mirror is Are you Afraid of the Dark for the 21st century's nihilism.
For me black mirror makes me confront all of the dark emotions that we feel on a daily basis. Shame, fear, rage, loneliness. It lays them out in a way so that you can really dissect these emotions and I think it helps us understand them and how they effect us.
I love how its written with no set rules. The changing charecters are my favorite part and How no setting or story is the same  Well done, well done...
what. i havent' watched game of thrones or breaking bad but that stuff is way too famous and old to avoid how are y'all getting spoiled from this
I don’t know what you guys are crying about with the GoT spoilers? You should’ve paused or closed out the video right when he started talking about it. You had time to stop watching 😂
I think that black mirror is dark because the mirror isn't reflecting light, it's absorbing it. But it does depend on the type of black they use. If they used vantablack this would make sense, but if they used something like spray paint you would be able to see the light reflecting back.
I actually only watched episode 1 an half of episode 2 before quitting, not because I think it's bad, it just leaves me with a feeling I don't like, disturbs me too much. I like my high fantasy stories with tragedies that leave me with the feeling that the characters grew by living through them, or where they end up with a witty love interest and the world saved. Not realistic or too original, but I like them
Hey nerdwriter check out this new vid by Austinconnel it is about his experience making an indie feature and it's amazing
I fucking hate black mirror. Yet somehow you described it in such new light that it makes me want to give it another shot. I won’t, but s/o to you for making think about it
I watched one episode...it was called Play Test or something like that. Jeesus! As amazing as it was, I never want to go back to watching this show!
my favorite show of all time and yet I know plenty of people who can't make it through even one episode because it's too dark or too disturbing. i watch TV because i want my existing philosophies, notions, and worldviews challenged and re-shaped constantly. my friends only seem to want affirmation and validation of their already established worldviews -- they just want to be entertained and laugh at sitcoms. it's a mad, mad world.
Damn, so many spoilers :( I'll come back when I finish it.
what if phones but too much
When I watch black mirror, I'm interested therefore I continue to. Once there is a dilemma I look forward for a solution. This keeps my attention. The question at hand is why do we like black mirror?  It could be because it leaves me shocked every time and this would be the effect of pitty and fear that he was referencing.  But one example I'm certain of is even if you don't like drama or this genre.  You'll continue to watch this mind catching show. But that theory kind of disproved what he stated.😊
I guess it can make us feel more thankful about our lives.
The Red Wedding shouldn't even be considered a GoT spoiler. It came out so long ago and it is freaking everywhere, there's no way to escape it, even if you don't watch the show.
Loved the video, as always. \nAnd tell your sponsor I went straight to their website from here, so they should sponsor you again!
The two happy endings took place in America. They got that wrong.
Black Mirror is one of those few shows that is truely different from the rest.
I watch BM hoping for Twilight Zone quality, but always ending up disappointed.
Breaking bad ended and the red wedding happened  years ago, people shouldn't be complaining about spoilers.
Spent a lot of time talking about a show that isn't Black Mirror
#💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕   #💕💕💕💕   #💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕   #💕💕💕💕\nJesus Christ is the only way to God\nHe died and rose from the dead\nHe promises you eternal life\nHe will also heal your body!
Black Mirror is extremely depressing because the characters act mostly in an unrealistic way.
NOOOOO SO MUCH SPOILS 😰 ill re watched this after i finish season 3
I was looking for a affordable malware and virus blocker that also prevents hackers. I came across MalwareBuster. It makes my computer run so much faster. So far so good! Has anyone else tried this one yet? https://malwarebuster.com/mb/info17
The independent episode approach to Black Mirror didn't allow for any serious attachment or care for characters in themselves for me,  so your analysis of the series through the lens of Aristotelian tragedy doesn't resonate. Black Mirror worked for me because of the strength of its premises and the exploration of those premises, not character development. The characters felt like means to the end of driving home a point. So the absence of catharsis was hardly a problem because it made the premise that much clearer.
This video candy coats a poisoned apple.
Whats the song at 3:22 ?
Ease up on the spoilers there bub.
The creators often state that they're not opposed to the development of these technologies, that technology is not the cause of the suffering they depict, it's the way people use it. But how far can we take that line of argument? Will that not, at some point, become analogous to the argument that 'guns don't kill people'?
I love Black Mirror BECAUSE it doesn't have good endings (most of the time)
I forgot to turn the screen on :/
0:55, Right name (Fifteen Million Merits), wrong season and episode number.
Black Mirror is like Fringe if there were no happy endings and they had to recast every episode because every character was constantly dying.
WELP. THERE GOES GAME OF THRONES FOR ME
This show makes me feel emotions like nothing else before. It is insanely brilliant and creative.
What the hell man? Spoiler alert for GoT. Stick to the show youre gonna review, damn.
Brilliant video, however, t's interesting you analyse a show which ridicules themes like invasive advertisement and then force an advertisement at the end of the video. Hypocrite.
*Makes video about Black Mirror*\n*Spoils three other shows in the process*
I know you probably thought you were being clever by incorporating spoilers involving scenes of tragedy without warnings, and thus robbing future viewers of catharsis, but, man...this episode really crossed a basic line of pop-cultural decency. I've been contributing to your Patreon for years, but this episode really blew it, man. I'm cancelling my per-video contribution effective immediately.
In many ways, its actually substantively closer to greek tragedy, in the way the later plays reflect the place of human endeavour in the face of a capricious god. In that way, it completes the causality of a lot of Greek tragedy (see: oedipus, the orestaia, and most works by Euripides), with out the clearfully defined resolution of the moral chorus, a framing device both in the twilight Zone and in early tragedy. Game of thrones provides causality through the logic of human folly and fate explicitly. Black mirror through the evidence of our powerlessness in the fac of the new, equally capricious, gods.
I love your channel, but if you’re going to be dropping spoilers of unrelated tv shows I’ve haven’t watched yet, I’m going to have to unsubscribe.
I recommend putting SPOILER ALERT at the beginning
Anyone else notice that the episodes of Black Mirror with the happiest endings are the ones set in an American society? San Junipero and Nosedive are, in my opinion, the least dark** episodes of the show, and they are the only ones set in North American populated societies. (Men Against Fire being the notable exception; while the soldiers are American, the location of combat is unknown.) \nCould it be a comment on British vs. American cultural perspectives in story telling? American television tends to favor happier, more positively fabricated endings; while British television majorly yields toward much darker, morbid endings with no ultimate silver lining.
I can't help but feel that Black Mirror is about as creative as I was in middle school talking to my friends in hyperbole, like all the times we would watch a movie and say some shit like but what if instead of this, everyone got murdered and the bad guys just had an orgy on the corpses. I'm sorry but I get so very bored by each of these episodes, the only thing it seems to be saying to me is look how exaggerated and fucked up it gets for no reason, technology rapes, 8 billion kids dead, the world is a fuck, lmaoooo
I expected Black mirror spoilers, but was surprised to see GOT spoilers too
People like to see the bad guy punished, so they can feel good about themselves, because they are weak minded fools with no insight to their own psyche.\nlike going to a hanging, small minded assholes with superiority complexes like shows like black mirror.\nGame of thrones has sex and violence and will attract everyone from alpha males to tweens depending on the plot twist at hand.\nBut the whole crime and punishment, oh look at the tortured criminal suffer and get punished type of shows masquerades as being deep and sophisticated, with a view on what it means to be human etc etc, but it`s bullshit.\nIt`s just getting views, because people like danger and violence.\nHumans ARE that primitive.\nWe are just making up more and more elaborate and sophisticated excuses and lies..
I have never heard of this show
Had a KFC add and that was not fucking kernel
I wish Black Mirror success, but if it goes super mainstream people will hop on the bandwagon and somehow ruin it.
chronologically, all black mirror mistakes and inciting incidents are made in act 1 or 2 or even before the story, and the problem is revealed in act 3. the problem throughout the episode seemed normal, so when the reveal drops, we are ashamed of how much we downplayed the initial tragedy.
Can someone please tell me the name of the song that ( beginning at 4:55 - onwards)? You get a digital cookie for helping a stranger on the internet :)
Is its title
Background song name?
WOAH....spoiler alerts?????
SPOILERS!

BREAKING BAD SPOILERS???
When is the bing pixel phone review
God you look like the rock in that thumbnail
hey u google motherfuckers.. now who removed the headphone jack.. you have no class to compete with apple products.. if you mock them atleast dont copy them..
What is the live wallpaper called @MKBHD
I wish these jackoffs would stop removing the jacks off their phones.
I think this looks cheap :/
People please stop whining about no headphone jack and bezels,although I agree this phone is not the best looking phone in the market,that title belongs to Samsung call it ugly is exaggerated plus the bezels are more than justified for the front facing speakers,also the removal of the headphone jack is something we all have to get used to because is taken over the market,do I agree with it?No but it is what it is get Bluetooth headphones and problem solved,I’m getting the original pixel xl cause I like it better and is cheaper and I need Google Fi service,but this phone is perfectly acceptable if I would have the budget for it.
Don't you think is better that it has thicker sides? Many Edge user complain about touching the sides of their galaxy edge and turn on random apps xD
So glad I got the Note 8. Beautiful design, S-Pen, beast phone with a headphone jack!
Anyone got a link of the wallpaper on the Pixel XL? The ocean/beach one?
Shit my OP5 is jealous now
The Pixel2 looks like a phone from 2014.
I hate it when other brands follow the Apple route (in this case, removing  the headphone jack). They justify Apple in doing so. Disappointing move, and a deal breaker.
whats the alternate for headphone jack ?? What is the price ?? Is this better than previous google..!! I think the previous pixel is the just best..!!
Where can I get that Live Wallpaper? I thought it was in Google's Wallpaper app on the Play Store, but that one with the moving waves isn't on there.
No headphone jack, not worth buying. NEXT.
Wireless charging isn't really useful if we still have to leave our phone in a specific location to do it. Wireless charging isn't the future here, it should be better battery and decrease charge times. Until we get a system that is either a week long battery, or charge times under 15 minutes, charging your phone 2x a day is going to be the norm, and that means the real issue here is charging the phone so frequently
Can you do a compare between pixel2 and LG v30 please?
The Pixel 2 (non XL) is so ugly.
Not all of us have the money for a 2017 no bezel phone. Some of us have 2016 bezel phones. A broad statement about how we are not use to having bezels in 2017 when most of us have older phones without that design.
Why do I feel like the only one who has Bluetooth earbuds?
Did anyone else have Google Assistant activated when he said ok Google?
Good stuff. I purchased the GP2 64GB in clearly white. T-Mobile is paying half that off so hello Pixel 2!
MKBHD, you need to do a pixel 2 XL vs Note 8  please
He didn't mention - the camera is a dual pixel sensor like the canon 80D - means better auto focus and depth mapping so you don't need a dual camera setup.
so basically throw in all features from samsung with google assistant....  and nothing additional on the plus just the price :D
I like google pixel, but I hate material, when other phone use metal or glass, pixel look like cheap plastics
The always on microphone sounds sketchy, but it’s cool for that music identifying feature. That’s pretty damn cool.
Man if the U11 had a headphone jack I'd have been all over that.
It is rad, but it has all the things android fans bitch that IPhones have. Interesting
Looks good... I miss my 5x. Using a Galaxy S8+ and the software annoys the hell out of me.
Ok, but, does it have, a wireless charging?
You people need to let go of headphone jacks. It's only a matter of time before they become history.
You said ok Google and activated my assistant i like the phone but not a lovely device like original pixel
Is the thicker side bezels due to the tech needed for active edge? I really hope they make active edge customizable :( Would much rather use it for something like taking screenshots.
That portrait mode blew my mind...WOW... just with one camera it was able to accurately find edges without harsh separation from your body to the bokeh in the background. That is a BIG achievement that's worth a mention. My iphone cant even do that with two cameras. That is completely bonkers... and googles context recognition just blows my mind every time I ask it a question.
When you said OK Google keyword you paused my video and set off my Google. Maybe avoid that in the future? Great video as always
Still getting LG V30, so far in my opinion, better phone than many of these new ones.
Let me summarize this video\n\nNo headphone jack on an android phone? No problem\n\nApple is surely doing something right for getting all the hate
The white color looks like a toy
Thanks 4 the honest and objective thoughts , unlike unbox
I'll stick with my pixel. Nothing really upgrade wise worthy.
No headphone jack equals no buy for me
No headphone jack is no big deal.  Same with the bezels, which seem to be an obsession these days.  Looks like a fantastic phone.  Fantastic enough to pull me away from my HTC 10?  No.
It's an ugly phone. what I don't understand is why google is following apple by removing the headphone jack. 850 for this ugly thing?????
don't they look like LG Q6 and LGG6..
going to stick with Nexus 6p for a little more while.
ah been waiting for this. cheers.
You opened my assistant when you said okay Google 😂😂
Never say Okay Google.. gawd why did my phone pick up the video audio with headphones on
I hope Samsung sticks with the headphone jack for longer
European price way too high.
seriously, No headphone jack is a deal breaker.
Stranger things reference... Are you a fan?
why cant google pixel be docked and become google desk or  pixelbook ?
Honestly, the headphone jack being removed is not as bad as you think. Most Bluetooth headphones on Amazon can be found for like $30 or even less
So i guess Google joins the Apple bandwagon of charging more for less. Samsung is the only one left innovating. Pretty sad.
Is the bezel and battery life which makes one to choose google pixel 2 xl over pixel 2.Can u explain?which is better?
You are completely out of touch with real consumers. A bezel is necessary for your phone cover to rest without covering the screen and affecting usage. This is the limit in bezel thinness IMO. On bigger phones a thin top or lower bezel makes it more difficult to handle.
LG V30 it is, then. The only good feature here is the front-facing stereo speakers. Also, has anyone paid attention that glass on the top curves OVER the back corners? good luck dropping the phone.
Jesus christ I have never in my life seen so many cry babies over the goddamn headphone jack, Use some fucking bluetooth headphones. Little bitches!
i personally don't give a shit about wireless charging & the headphone jack. ima get that pixel 2 xl
I'm keeping my S8 :)
Am I the only one who doesn't give a fuck about the headphone jack? Buy Bluetooth headphones.
U can buy mi a1 1/3 price is u want stock Android
Why do I want it
Soooooo the headphone jack is missing but no battery upgrade it seems like, so what took up that space???? , and the smaller versions looks like a cheap huawei or Blu phone so the fancy wallpaper should not even be mentioned. Phone is ugly as fk 🙄....only see mkbhd buying this ...
I like The withe one
I can also shot portrait photos with my S8 with both cameras, sometimes fails but most of the time works good so I don't know why everyone is impressed with PXL 2 doing the same thing.
The screen bezel design is giving me this claustrophobic vibe. Like it’s trying to be edge to edge but just isn’t and it’s the same rounded corner as the bezels making it look “sunk in”.
The screen looks so washed out, especially next to the Samsung.  The screen has like, zero color vibrancy.  Whole thing looks like overpriced shit.
Sigh, they're trying to build their walled garden higher to get a stake in the bluetooth headphone market at the expense of their consumers, the very business practice I despise Apple for and now they've done the same. Why would you succumb to this Google, I thought you would take the high road?
so when is the full lgv30 review coming out?
Thumbs up if you see Joshua vergara @androidauthority at 0.11
It looks like one of those iPhone X clones
Just because iPhone does it doesn't mean you should do it. \nat Least Iphone looks cool, and many people can dismiss the lack of a headphone jack.\nBut if you have an ugly phone, with ugly colors, and you don't add a headphone jack, then we got a problem.
Really a beautiful phone
*gr8 vid*
Ugly
stephen paddock makes an appearance
Waste guy
no headphone jack = deal breaker
انت فشيخ 😄
Headphone jack dude...cmon
UGLY THAN THE PIXEL Uurgh
wtf people so hung up on headphone jacks
Paddock.....
It looks ugly😂
For meetup
no headphone jack = bad move
No thanks
iPhone X or pixel XL?
Crisis occasion wealth apparent Greek virtually oversee boom always low.
Outdated design
IT LOOKS LIKE LG G6
Just get Bluetooth earphones 😎
garbage
Complaining about the side bezels? 1st world probs
those bezels ruined an otherwise good looking phone IMO
1k likes from iPhone ☓ lovers... 😂
It's difficult to believe in yourself because the idea of self is an artificial construction. You are, in fact, part of the glorious oneness of the universe. Everything beautiful in the world is within you.
I Dont Like White Guys But He Can Get It Lol
Not trying to be that guy but if his book is a code against consumerism, why do I have to buy it?
how? like how did Wendy just completely disregard that intriguing heartfelt moment when he opened up and talk about Amy. it was succinctly devastating! I wanted to hug him....yet she just didn't even try to connect with him.
@4:16 jumping into that chocolate lake with your mouth wide open WENDY CHILLLE HOW U GET THROUGH THIS INTERVIEW! 😂😂😂😂😂 he is too much, Wendy's like let me make sure I put my panty liner on today
Omg Wendy and Russell are so cute ha
I LOVE HIM!!!  He's hilarious! 😂
He is funny as hell
You have to love him ❤️ very smart guy.
How is he hot?\nI'm missing something
The first time I heard him speak I fell in love!!!! He falls under the same sign as me....😊😊😊
white version of k west.
Russel is a dope guest and I love how Wendy’s steers interviews!!
They actually had decent chemistry. She handled him extremely well. I am shocked
Wendy was milking for front page tea with that last question, I swear...
I’m British and have never heard or seen Wendy before. She reminds me of Hilary from Fresh Prince of Bel Air, but I’m sure she’s far more intelligent.\n\nWhat also surprises me is just how different Russell Brand is in front of a large audience (compared to how he is private, at least as far as his YouTube channel shows). He is honest but he is playing up to the audience and acts the same to large UK audiences.\n\nNever underestimate him.
I love the way he thinks
I have no idea who he is, but somehow he penetrates.
i think he's an absolute honest man and funny as hell
I was ringside, and I use that word deliberately!\n*Tumbleweed through the audience*\nClassic.
Picture Stephen Fry on that couch...
Russell has that spiritual wisdom
He's very intelligent & sexy in a weird way. He must be a handful to live with.
I don't know who this guy is but he is as funny as he is brilliant.😲😲😲😲😲
His personality makes you want to believe his last answer lol
russell should right novels... he talks like he's telling an epic story
Russel is a sexy beast! I think he is amazing. ❤️
He is so AWAKE, and intriguingly  SMART!
Wendy is the best! ...by the best I mean the absolute WORST interviewer on planet earth!!! THEEEE WORST!!!
Love Russell. He's one of the most brilliant minds in entertainment .
Russell is the only one that can totally take over a Wendy interview and she couldn't care less, she looked like a school girl she was so in awe.
I smiled throughout the video.......... He's full of life.
Russell always needs a bath
Wendy is right about Russell being attractive.
11:19 Wendy has no idea what to do with him and it's hilarious
I want that book!!
This is the funniest damn interview I've ever seen with Wendy, she didn't know wtf was going on... I loved this!!!! He funny as all hell.
Lol jumping into that chocolate lake with mouth wide open
Never before has a man been so underserving of fame and fortune as this wanker. Hopefully he stays in the states he's not welcome back in the UK.
He's actually giving Wendy a run for her money. From now on I'll watch his interviews.
He is funny,but I couldnt date someoñe with that amount of energy... Also,when he said chocolate lake the camera man showed two black women
Vegan curious. Russell is so quick. I love him so much.
The best interview so far of Season 9 of The Wendy Show
Wendy gaining a little weight and it makes her look younger!
WOW I love love him. I’m def grabbing that book
He looks old. He got white whiskers in his beard
I love russell he's so high off life
I never comment but my gosh what a fresh breath of air 😍💫
Wendy did not need to bring up Amy or Katy Perry. Russel has a book, charity and a lot going on and he is funny
This guy is turd, opportunist, sex addict. Give back those millions dude to Katy!
I know he’s not gay, but damn I think he is sexy 😋
He is so amazing! Hahaha love his energy!
He's so BOMB💣💣💣
HE IS THE ONLY CELEBRITY I ENJOY ON YOUR SHOW. I LOVE LOVE LOVE RUSSELL BRAND. THE ONLY PERSON THAT COMES EQUAL TO HIM IS CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER...HE WAS A GOOD INTERVIEW TOO..kEEP BRINGING THEM BACK!!!!
I ALWAYSSSS thought he was super SEXY! 😍
After one conversation with him I would fall in love.
HE'S AWESOME AND NOT STUPID ahh i love his charisma
He handled Wendy very well I loved every bit of it... she tried to shade but he didn’t let her 😂👊🏾🖤
I’m dying 😂💀 you can’t drug them rotf
that accent 😍 he's just beyond adorable and so honest
She is off balance
This guy is so fucking weird
He seems like a Dickens character....
He needs his own show!
Can somebody please translate for me!!!!
He got the sista's @4:19 blushing  after he said  Jumping into that chocolate lake.  Lol #shadycameraman  proceeds to aim the camera at them... to show their reaction... lol he always on time
Gosh I love Russell. He's very hyperactive but extremely woke and oozes sex appeal. Most people don't get him and his humour but I personally would love to drink with him and just converse (well I think he's sober so I'll drink and he can do whatever). \n\n\nAlso, congrats on his marriage. I've always gotten the feeling that he's a hopeless romantic and loves the notion of love but didn't understand it. He was told not shown what love is and I am glad he has found a little piece of serenity, compassionate, and oneness with Laura (who's an admirable woman for looking past his...past and seemingly accepting all aspects of Russell wholeheartedly). I hope for the best for both.
He could be a rapper. He was kind of a rapping.
now that was a great interview
he seemed high on something....
He's so crazy
Who's watching in 2017?
Wendy, there's gotta be a special where you gossip about your own life and fucked up body. lookin like a Capitol P.
HIM AND SCOTT SHOULD BE BROUGHT TOGETHER for something.
man i can watch him forever... he just draws you in.. thats a talent..
He snapped with facts and gave me my  life !
I understood 70% of what's Russell was saying, and i'm not being sarcastic or anything. I'm completely honest
He's awesome full respect
He is hilarious!!!🤣🤣🤣\nVery intelligent!!
love this dude
This guy is essentric...
RUSSEL IS FUCKING HOT
Like a sleeping bag 😂😂😂😂😂😂
this is surprising wendy is trending
I fucking LOVE him!!!!

Its a good burger for a party, but not two people lmao
love these two,  expecially YB, seems so nice
How is this a challenge?
there goes evan's abs
This is what is wrong with the world
I have a husky too! And best dogs ever, but they have a ton of energy.
... Well, this is my 16\nI think i'm in love with her hahahah
The girl is a fucking savage!!!!
She always says things like Oh I don't know if I can do this and ends up eating the most in every video
I want in n out
I would have literally gained 20 lbs from what YB ate in one sitting. Life is so unfair.
What about kids in Africa
I wouldn't say that is a surprise. I worked for Panda Express. I knew several managers who made $100,000. It isn't super common but enough
did you know in and out burger dyes its meat?
You know what really grinds my gears? When they use the person who was featured in two fitness videos and that had  eat healthy for so long, And now their doing challenges like this. SMH 🤦‍♂️
YB can put down some food! YB!!!
Evan is so lucky for having YB and vice-versa
In n out is nasty
Way to get diabetes
6 figures for being a manager at IN N OUT?
I wonder how many times they impregnated the cow that provided the feast, before they drove a steel piston through her skull.  Aren’t you glad that you’re on top of the food chain?  That animals don’t have an impulse to fear?
It looks like a caterpillar 🐛
At least hire someone who can actually eat not like these 2... wtf buzzfeed
since when do you put fucking gloves to eat burgers
There are cheaper ways to take your own life u know
I luv in and out...
As someone who is trying to calorie count, watching this hurts
What employees should we pick for this eating challenge. Literally the smallest people we can find.
At least the food didn’t go to waste.
Poop is going to be gigantic.
Replace the bun with rice and something something RiceGum is a phaggot.
Hell.\nI got the heart attack after watching this.
If you invited me it only would have took three people
100X100 African kids could have ate that instead of wasting it \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFucking Americans
This was actually disgusting to watch. Made me a tad sick to my stomach
the inn and out diabeties  challenge
Hahahaha they spent thousands of dollars to get him six packs and now making him do this. What is this, global warming to ice age?
Why does Evan have an accent? Was he born in Korea?
Matt stone would eat all that like it’s nothing
Wait this came out yesterday? Wow I was just wanting to see if anyone did it. What a coincidence.
Wish this was a thing in the UK!
i heard you can still order the 100x100 @ In n Out but you have to call the head of management for it !
They’re in LOVE
I ship them so hard
I wish they had in an out in Michigan😥
I would love to find a Asian girl that digs personality, loves eating, sleeping and cuddling, maybe video games too
She’s a fucking boss!! Ate 20 patties like a champ!
A bunch of people are applying for BuzzFeed so they're like, We gotta get rid of some! Why don't we make them eat themselves into a cardiac arrest!
Q: How do you insult a hamburger patty? A: Call it a meatball
My uncle would eat that whole thing
it's not complete without kelsey
How is YB so small. I love her btw
YB and Evan are two of my favourite Buzzfeed members! Just behind Shane and Ryan (Unsolved), Zach and Keith (Try Guys), and just ahead of Stephen and Andrew from worth it!
I haven't eaten In n Out in a *B* *R* *I* *C* *K*
That Kuck lost to a girl, what a pansy.
I wish I was them I love burgers and no I am not fat

Actually isn't the 100 a 10x10? A 100x100 is 1000 burgers
There's only one word for this: Unnecessary
They look so high

Seems a little bad mannered to just hold up a bunch of peoples orders just for what?  We already knew the outcome, a big pointless burger. Sigh.
The moment when u see her eat a lot and doesn’t get fat.
I LOVE YB! I wish she was in NY so we can be food buddies. Eat all day, all night
Matt Stonie needs to check this out! Like it so he can see

Learn how to write with your non-dominant hand
learn to fingerboard!!! its skateboarding but then with your fingers
Now try to solve the 13 x 13 :D
did you watch a tutorial for this cube
Finally I actually can do one of his challenges. Learning the 5x5 isn't really all that hard despite how it may seem. 3x3 blindfolded would be impressive. And if he didn't want to do that really even a 6x6 would be way more impressive.
So awesome to see cubing introduced to more mainstream audiences. Congrats on getting on trending!
learn to solve the 1x1x1 rubik's cube
Mike, try to learn card flourishes... it looks very cool and some of them are kinda hard to do, but try to do at least moderate level card flourishes.. hope you get this, and good luck!
Any people watching this that think just use freeslice/yau
How does this guy not get paritys?
Mike it would be awesome if you could learn some sort of a foreign language! Maybe set a realistic goal like to have a semi-active conversation with someone in that language.
you should get a legit speedcube, it would make ur life alot easier
Sweet! I've always wanted to know how to cook an entire language!
How about the megaminx in under 5 minutes
5x5 is easier than 4x4. there's no parity errors. try a ghost cube. You'll shit yourself
2x2x2 in under 10 seconds...my best is 11
This goes to show you that with practice you can master ANYTHING but people are too damn lazy 🤦🏾‍♂️💀
Try a mega minx next it's like a 3x3 and a 5x5 or a ghost cube
I can do one of those

Learn to fake your reactions at the end more convincingly.
and here i am unable to solve the 4x4x4 at all, there is always that vertex flipped around, damn you pariety! (ps don't tell me how to solve it, i want to do it myself)
The 5x5 is so fun.
Try learn how to play the bagpipes.
DUDE You should have done a 4x4 - You'd have to learn a lot more about parity and how to solve it. 3x3 and 5x5 and 7x7 are almost basically the same (minus small amounts of parity) But they're all basically the same thing. You should have done an even cuboid 'cause then you have to learn how to solve centers and fix parity.
My goal this summer was to solve my 10x10x10 in under 20 minutes..... I'm down to 18 now :)
You should learn how to spin a book or plate on your finger...hahaha

Are you Irish? coz you look and talk exactly like jacksepticeye
Skillshare lul, trying to get paid for information - it's 2017 ffs. GJ at the rubiks btw :) much love.
Saw you on alec steeles channel and I've been loving your videos. This is yet another excellent one! Keep an coming!
How tf did you get past the edge parities???
I clicked off the video once I saw some math
Use freeslice for the edges that will cut your times in half
I may not be the fastest Cuber, but I got my record for the 5x5 yesterday at 2:05.68 lol :)
Hey mike u should get a better 3x3x3 cube and film yourdelf speedcubing
try to learn the trick lunar on a kendama
At the end of the year you should take all the things you've learned throughout it and see how much of it you've retained by trying to do them all again in one day.
I knew you’d blow up soon
You should learn to shoot a bow!
Ahh i learned the 4x4 last week.
I started to learn the 3x3 because of your video and now i can do with 30 to 40 seconds consistently, now im gonna have to learn 5x5 too then
It takes me a couple of days to solve a 3x3x3 cube
But I can solve all of them. And a 3x3 blindfolded. I win.

Feliks Zemdegs 2.0!\n(Feliks is the world record holder for the 5x5 at under 50 seconds.)
Can you try and solve a gear cube in thirty seconds or less. It may seem very hard but trust me, it is far easier than a normal Rubik's cube

Yummy!!! But I am very anxious for halloween videos
I've never matched apple and blackberry...I can't wait to try it!!
Ooooh that looked sore! I always grate my fingers!😁
Jesus Christ I missed your recipes
MashAllah
Oh my!  These look fantastic!  😋

Yummy

To all continental Europeans who can't get treacle: I like to use sirop de Liège (boiled down fruit juice, dates, apples and pears I think) or really dark brown muscovado sugar or dates soaked in water and blended up. If someone has another idea, please tell me! \nPs: Golden Syrup is Grafschafter Goldsaft to my fellow Germans :)
Love from India
36th, love your chanel
These look so yummy! And the potato ricer trick is inspired!
Hi Jemma, how do you find the Kenwood mixer compared to the Kitchen aid?
hi Jemma i just wanna ask if you can also feature on how to make a french macarons..=)
I think that the quality of the video is not as good as before
You know she's a pro because her mixer has a ring light
Poor thumb! \nI feel a little better about slicing my hand with a French mandolin now. Not by much because it hurt like a mother. But a little.
It took me longer than i care to admit, to realise that it wasn't a siren that was going off in every video, it was Jemma opening the oven!
Hi Jemma! I am a huge fan, I recently started a small baking business and you are an inspiration. I am always surprised by your flavor combinations and I have tried dozens of your recipes, they always turn out splendidly! Thank you!
These look yummy! I've never mixed apples and blackberries before so I will definitely give it a go..\nBut I have a question: instead of apple, could I use raspberries or other berries for this recipe or do they have to much water? I'm a little worried that I would squeeze out all the flavour (I hope it makes sense because I'm not that good in English)
Is there an American alternative for golden syrup that isn't corn syrup?
I reckon it would be a great cupcake Jemma but too much work for me. I might make the cakes and ice them with a caramel buttercream ( your recipe of course). I love your channel. And your carrot cake is THE BEST.
good job need to try someday
hi jemma I like apple and i love your cupcake
Yum! The compote filling is such a lovely addition.
I love love love this yesss, so beautiful and I bet it taste AMAZING. never thought about blackberries and apples!
Gemma cupcake do you have any recipe with fresh pomegranate or maybe custard apples please
I'm having a shitty day, Jemma. Hearing your voice and watching you bake brings me joy. Thanks for being you.
What a brilliant idea to use a potato ricer!
I love your top! Where is it from?
these videos get me through the week !! thanks jemma for your baking creativity and expertise ♡☆
JEMMA THIS IS TRENDING IM SHOOK. also this look so so so yum
I won’t lie, a ring light on the arm of a stand mixer seems like the most extra, ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen, that’s probably a huge improvement on user friendliness.
Can someone convert the ingredients for me in US metrics?:)
I love your straight forward approach and quick format!  Keep on baking!
(Silently cursing why I live 1 continent away from C&D).. This looks sooo amazing, I want 1 RIGHT NOW!!
This looks so cute ❤ I love it !
Just got back from visiting the UK: I got C+D cupcakes, they were sooo good!
Do you think this recipe could work with peaches and blueberries?
That’s looking delicious! Will give it a try👍🏻
Honestly I just would like 2 likes that's all:)

First lol don't hate me
My favourite dessert in cupcake form! 😱 x
Hey Jemma.  How do you stop all the fruit sinking to the bottom
Hey jemma, you didn't state the quantity of flour in your cupcakes in the description box.
I visited your shop on Saturday, and I was so happy to see all the cupcakes! Thanks so much for such a great experience😘
Everybody's good at cooking something and I'm good at cooking crumble \n\nI've got one in the oven would you like some?
Can't hear Black Treacle without thinking of the Arctic Monkeys. Such a good song. I love apple anything, I'm excited to make these!!
Yes!!! You're back!!!
thats amazing thank you ,, i have always wanted a good recipe for black berries !! most appreciated !
The best as always! 😊👍
Hi .. I’m make buttercream but I’m failed
Oooo I hope the thumb was fake and the start of the Halloween series
Did anyone else think the pink buttercream looked like ham?
What a yummy looking cupcake!  I do have one question for you Jemma, in the recipe you did not list how much flour you used in the cupcake part. Can you please update the recipe. Thank you!!
Omg yummmmm!!! I never would have thought of that combo with the apple and blackberries 😲💯😍👐👏🎉
Oooo I can't wait to try this!
I love you so much please text back
Why on earth would a person (2 people) dislike this vid?
How could I make this vegan?
could you make something like gratin fruit cupcake. love from America
Jemma I heard recently that you don’t do apple picking in the uk, and I am devastated for you. But.. do you have apple cider donuts? Because that’s the best part of apple picking, the apple cider donuts. \nWhat I’m saying is you should make a video on apple cider donuts. 😊
IM NEVER THIS EARLY CAN I GET LIKES NOW?!!?😮\n\n\nno.😑\n\n(I'm kidding... this never happens and i need dem likes guys😕)
Hello Jemma. I am big fan of C&D and watching your videos for very long time! Can I ask you, why are you using for making buttercream paddle attachment instead of the whisk attachment? Just curious😉great recipe btw!!!❤❤❤💦
Man of the match : the Crossbar.
Finally we're staring to get what we deserve out of these games. I think that comes from the belief that's in the squad now. \n\nCredit to Strachan for turning it around. And I'd say some credit has to go to Celtic and Brendan Rodgers. He's installed a winning mentality and a belief in the Celtic players that's now rubbing off on this Scotland squad. \n\nI'm a Gers fan btw so no bias here, just my honest opinion. Roll on Sunday. We'll win.
Would be so great to see my Scotsmen in Russia!! All the best from Germany, you'll do it !!
Well done the pink highlighters.
Huge congrats to Scotland from the sunny Cali!
Scotland have the best fans
All my hopes are going to Scotland to qualify so keep up the good work
98's world cup seems far.come on Scotland, need to see you on Russia18...love from Mexico (yes, this mexican follows national team and league)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh were are the scoties
yeeeesssss great won Scotland. Love your Nation, now get that last win and qualify through the Playoffs, unless its against us. Greetings from Switzerland <3
Great performance, totally deserved the win. Bring on Slovenia.
Well done lads great fight and played some great football ,you deserve the glory tonight.
Tears in my eyes after that goal went in.  Come on Scotland!  I was 13 the last time Scotland were at a world cup.
Goalkeeper 👏👏👏\nNice job for Scotland next Sloveni and \nGo to Rossia
Well done Scotland, well deserved and urged on by the nail-less tartan army providing another phenomenal atmosphere. Slovakia played well for only having 10 men but Scotland deserved the win based on the play. Final game on Sunday, will we make the play offs...........YES, C,MON. ALBA GU BRATH.
I think this game is one of James Forrest’s best games unexpected but good on ya jamsey
The atmosphere and the drama of this match gives me goosebumps. So proud of my home nation. Believe. Keeping the dream alive.
Biblical night! The Slovakia goalkeeper was immense got say. We deserved that result though
Mad respect to their keeper, was great today.
One more game! Lets take it to slovenia. Destiny is in our hands!
Great result, come on Scotland!
Great stuff Scotland!  Great night at Hampden Park!  Can't wait to share some more videos with everyone, documenting the evening.  Now onto Slovenia!  #believe 🤞👍😁⚽❤
Seen me
SCOTLAND!!!💙💙💙
Well deserved.
GG Scotland.
Debravka was excellent
Lol cmon Scotland
never in doubt
Carl Macar
Brothers Slovaks dont give up. U have good team and escellent goalkeeper. I hope u will go to World Cup to Russia. Greetings from Poland,
I enjoy watching the Scottish national football and the atmosphere at Hampden is awesome! I'm curious of this, but why did they stop using I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) as their goal song? by the way, I would love to see a friendly match between my country  (Mexico) and Scotland at Hampden in the near future.
That dive was a disgrace and poetic justice followed with that red and winning it late on. I was nervous for this game as I think Slovakia are a very decent side so well done to Gordon and the lads 👍
A draw is enough to become second, right?
Brave Scots..wanna see you in Russia. welcome
Griffiths could be  Scotland s  man in the world cup plays better for Scotland then at Celtic
Scotland were better than England against Slovakia
Englishman here - hope to see you boys at the World Cup!
I only wanted to watch this video to see the reaction of the crowd when Scotland scored. I was not disappointed. Wish you all the best Scotland, you deserve to be in the finals based on your last performances!
number 17 on Slovakia looks like a clown
Logan, your a bad example to the world (honest opinion) he has no morales, no common sense, and what's worse is he has loads of little kids watching him. I don't leave dislikes on his vids out of respect, but he shouldn't be allowed to show what he says and does to kids.
15% of his right teste was sacrificed to the YouTube God's LMAO😂🤣
how can he lose 15% of his testicle when he has none, I think they mean his boyfriend is losing 15% of his testicle.
Bruh I'll never take this guy serious 😭😂😂
Hopefully, he won’t reproduce.
I lost all the repsect i had for jimmy. Cant belive he has this mental retarded idiot on his show. unsubscribing!
Why is he lying about fighting a bear wtf lol
Why is this idiot relevant retards at its finest the rame is bs
I landed on my balls (It was purple \n\n\nThanks for sharing We totally needed to know
3:05 he went from laughing to being serious real quick
WATCH OUR VIDEO IF YOU THINK LOGAN PAUL AND JAKE PAUL ARE THE SAME PERSON AND ARE ALSO CONFUSED AS TO WHO THEY ARE.\n\nMAYBE ITS JUST ME SO ALSO WATCH OUR VIDEO IF YOU DONT THINK THAT.
He tried to make people laugh but no one laughed
Imagine waiting in line for hours to see Jimmy Kimmel and the guest is Logan Paul. Wow.
Come on, Jimmy. I thought you were better than this smh
For a guy who's colour blind he could really tell what colour an avocado turns
Why jimmy? You just lost all respect from me.
I hate this a lot
So he stole the title from “Shaq vs”
worst thing i’ve ever seen
I love how awkward social media stars are when there out of there comfort zone.
Didn’t know he even had any
No he doesn't
I was here expecting another Trump bashing and fake crying from Jimmy, but end up watching this Trump look a like (younger version) instead
I guess he can't say Yo u don't got the BALLS to do that bruh!
Get real celebrities on your show.
I bet kimmles daughter watches him and asked her dad to have mr. Meme himself on the show
You meant, an after-ripe avocado not before.
I've never witnessed an interview where the audience is so, idk... quiet, awkwardly silent, laughing in pure confusion? This was painful to watch tbh
what the heck is this. who even the heck is this.
The hell why is he here..
He’s so cringe. He’s gonna die one day doing something stupid and it’s just gonna be like “...meh”
Good. He shouldn't reproduce. Idiot.
LOGANG 4EVER!!!!!\n\nLogan: Well he catch this in his mouth like a dog?\nAlligator guy: Yes!!!\nLogan: *throws it at its head*\n😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊😊😊
really never thought I would see Logan Paul on tv
Purple Logan can’t see taut color
Our youth CANNOT be led to believe Logan Paul is quality content. This talentlessness will lower the bar for years to come
How can he possibly get on this show after all the things him and his autism of a brother do?
WTF IS HE DOING IN A TALK SHOW HOST.......
so proud of my baby
He has the 2005 teenage boy haircut.
Kimmel you are a Clown
It's uncomfortable how dumb this guy is. Kimmel is losing it, gotta vet these guests
This is so cringing to watch
I didn’t know Kimmel had to stoop this low with his guest
Watch Jimmy Kimmel fake laughing for 5 minutes and 56 seconds. \n\n\n\nThat title fits this video better
The dude is a vegetable!
He’s that typical surfer dude that only knows 10 words lol
*Que It's Always Sunny Soundtrack*\nThe Paul family tries to get their groove back
He's high af.
This made me cringe so hard😑...
Logan is okay but he’s so much like Jake I have to dislike
logan my child you’re very awkward rn
What a disgrace of a show
Is the suit a new merch?
everybody pray he reaches puberty in the next 20 years
Logan paul = 85% balls of steel
Dam, he looks like a adult pervert
Glad to know his balls dont work
Wow, Logan didn't know how to talk. That's why YouTube has editing so you don't see his dumbness
Lmao Logan thought he was funny but he's only funny to little kids who laugh at anything ....Dumbass Kids 😂😂😂
DO NOT bring that kid back on the show, or I will never watch 1 more video. Bad move Jimmy
1:01 this is the funniest part😂😂
He calls it comedy and claps for himself. Ha! Now that's funny.

They Riverdale cast have the best chemistry.
Excuse me where is cole
Lmao all the girls thirsty for KJ
LILI SPEAKING ALIEN IS SO PRECIOUS!!! 💜💜
I'm so glad whenever Cole isn't in the cast videos. We get to see the others for once. And they're all way funnier than him
Where the f is cole sprouse
I'm offended that Cole was not involved
Why do they stretch their words “ooooooo noooooo this is haaaarrdd” 😂😂😂😂
KJ is so good looking
WHERE THE FUCK IS COLE ?!!!
Everything about this is so early 90’s
They make my life a lil better
It’s nice to hear KJs kiwi accent hahaha
I like cole but im glad he isn’t there sometimes his too extra, let this ppl shine a bit...
So would I Casey so would I
They all look so beautiful and comfortable! And even though I miss Cole, this was just so much fun to watch!
One man for each two girls ,so perfect!
i hate how they’re so famous already when there are other wayyyyy better actors that don’t get recognition. this show is very mediocre (i’ve seen all of it okay my friends forced me)
Cole watches this later and gets offended that none of them said suite life 😂😂😂
i live for KJ Apa's accent...
When Casey said he would wait in line for Cole Sprouse I was like same
It's weird hearing Cheryl and Veronica speak normally.
Casey: I would wait in line to get an autograph and hug from Cole Sprouse\nLili: that's tragic\nImao 😂
on a scale from 0-Camila how left out do you feel?
They are literally the most attractive cast that my eyes have ever seen <3
They are all so cute
We’re is. Cole!! 😫😫😫
HOLD THE FRONT DOOR IS THAT MAN AUSTRALIAN
madelaine at 3:15 nudging lili while lili asks Do you date?
a bunch of style icons they look like a cast of a 70's show
Why are people even mad Cole isnt here tbh Zach was always better than Cody
I feel like Cami is always left out
COLE SPROUSE WOULD MAKE THIS SO MUCH BETTER!!!
oh myyy Kj and lili😍😍 him blushing while dancing with her is everythng ❤ #barchie
They're actually the new cast of That 70s Show
I think that at the beginning of the entire show, we were all so excited about Cole, but now that we've seen the entire cast's personality, we've learned to love them all, and I think thats really important
Tbh I'd let madelaine beat the fuck out of me
Yasss to the  your up bruh  from KJ 😂 that nz accent/slang right there lol
WE'LL SEE YOU ON THE FLIPPY FLOPPY
Truth or dare? ( i did it with my elbows to)
I can't *tounge spit* Understand *tounge spit* Your accent *tounge spit*
Im just surprised no one said the suite life when it asked what was their favorite tvh show tbh

14:14 The day you went to Publix was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.
Imagine if Paddock was an old test subject from MK ultra 0_0 I should be careful saying stuff like this, Might be true
This guy is crazy watch out America !!
People will not condemn Steve for being wealthy, we condemn for being a killer of innocent people!!!
He seems like he's enjoying the attention
He volunteers a narrative before even being asked a pointed question!
If my brother killed that many people... I'll tell those families how sorry we are and go back in my home.
thousands of dollars of sushi who gives a f*** 59 people died SMFH
i feel so sorry for him. he’s in so much shock
Steve is a terrorist
I think he needs to stop talking to the press.
He was going to say  steve was an army of 1  but didn't want to disrespect the armed forces.
This is sad. The guy is in shock. Yeah, the dude seems a bit out of his mind. Yes he keeps bragging about his wealthy family; but I feel bad for him. He just needs some time to realize what's at stake here.. He already seems out of his mind, so people can start using everything he says against him and will only cause more suspiciousness.
Leave this guy alone man. You can tell this man is just bombarded by media and hounded day and night. He's in shock. Just give him like, a month, then ask him calmly.
All these comments are so crazy.  people talking about killing this guy because he's related to a killer, because that makes sense.  If your sitting at home on your laptop and you are thinking to yourself that this innocent guy deserves to be punished for the crimes of his brother than maybe you should re-evaluate your self-righteous attitude. Bunch of damn hypocrites.
He's just quirky and nerdy leave him alone! He makes a lot of sense to me!
America stop looking for a guilty person this guy knows nothing about his brother.
Before reading all the intolerant comments, just put yourselves in his shoes and think about it.
This guy goes from acting like he knows what bump stocks are to acting like he isn't even sure what they are within 1 minute.
Maybe with all that wealth you can help the victims.
The world did not sympathise with Hitler's family when they spoke of him before his power. So I will not sympathize with this families cries for Steve. He MASSACRED human lives
With all that money Sounds like someone paid Steve to Do it.
His brother just did the worst crime possible and committed suicide and it seems like the world is demanding an answer from him.  Would you expect him to be in his right mind ? He's probably going insane.
This guy is a pedophile -- he will be arrested soon
He has psychopathic tendencies. To be honest, he seems guilty of something and at the same time, he's loving the attention. It's weird. He kepts saying let's stop talking about me and then he'd follow it with a rant about himself. Smh
Godammit , he is a Good actor..
Does anyone else think it's odd that he did a complete 360 from what he said in this 1st interview???? Very strange! Is he wearing an ear piece????
Look at this idiot defending a monster who massacred people as if he was a hero. Guess what?? Your fffking brother was a psychopath and he did what he wanted to do
LOOK AT MY COMMENT PEOPLE .. tell me what you think.
Lol.. This video speaks a lot about the hotels. Throw the bellhop $100 and you're a saint
If I were in this situation, I would certainly come off a lot more sympathetic to the victims than this guy comes off being. It would be 24/7 condolences, not ripping people's questions about his brother.
This guy doesn't know if people are mad at him, feel bad for him, hate him or just want answers. He has been catapulted into millions of other people's games. He is weird, you would be to outside your house with all neighbors staring out on national tv with 20 reporters knowing you will go down as the interview after the deadliest shooting in America done by his brother. Give him a break
He needs to stop justifying his brother’s actions. Steve is a monster period.
My old man used to say: PHONEY BALONEY.  This is the PURE DEFINITION. nuff said.
Can this poor guy just be left alone he's gone through so much and all these interviews and all these people just adding  even more stress on him and he won't be able to take this much longer before he goes into depression.
14:50\nSteeeeeve was an ARMS dealer.\nand he was supplying to the highest bidder inside america; \ncriminals...but also , get it, ISIS fanboys...\nIn the mandalay room a transaction would take place. Instead, the \nmuslims took the MGs and fired in the crowd and killed STeeeeeve with \ngun in his mouth....\nthere solved.
mkultra they got to him so he wouldnt expose them
People acting like his brother could read his mind
he reminds me of michael off gta idk y
This guy is still trying to process what is going on, and the whole world is looking down at his family angrily looking for answers, he is going to sound frantic, odd and defensive. It's normal.
This guy seems very unwell. I know he’s upset. I’m sure he is grieving his heart out over loosing his brother.
He's acting like that because people are kinda going after him. People are acting like this guy should've seen something in him.
I still can’t process that the biggest mass killing in us history has no good explanation and probably never will. All those people died for nothing.\nWhile we’re grasping at straws, some guy is gonna top this high score next year. How many more people need to die for no reason before things change?
he seems to really emphasize how wealthy Steve was, could it be that Steve became so obsessed with money (common for people from poverty) that it was all he cared about, all that gave him worth and the only way to keep his love and be happy? Even it is a way to insult others, like @ 14:14 Eric says him getting on a plane and flying somewhere is like you going to Publics.
he shouldn't be talking to the press.
who else watched the whole thing
No eyebrows? Check health cancer diagnosis with medical doctors.
Steve was a what ? A arm.....maybe arms dealer ? Vapor locked when he caught himself. I may be wrong...but .
You guys don’t understand out of nowhere his life basically just flipped and it was out of his control. How would you act?
I think he knows exactly what happened and theirs more than one person involved in this and he had their back
someone let this man know that his brother was a sleeper agent for the government
If he says Steve one more time!!
This is staged, mind control, planting seeds for gun control. For nwo.
what I don't understand is why are these media outlets repetitively interviewing this guy.  obviously he's not even trying to apologize on his brothers behalf instead trying to build his brother as this super cool guy who wouldn't hurt a fly.  obviously you parasites were too occupied with enjoying his money to see if any mental issues were stirring up...idiots!
Everyone look into *Mc-Ultra.* This was a deep state operation with many agendas...
People hes not crazy or a drug addict he was telling them what steve was to him amd how he saw his brother and he can't comprehend why his brother did this he's in a mental shock
Steve doesn't deserve a funeral or his ashes to b sent to his mom.. Steve took away so many lives and destroyed/ changed the future of those that were injured who will now have to deal with PTSD and other illnesses
is this a real interview? Or is it fake?
This guy is weird and should be investigated
Sounds like he is acting
BEYOND WEIRD !! He was  PURE EVIL, who tries to normalize a terrorist murderer
That was the weirdest 33 minutes of my life.  I can never get that back.  This dude is looney. Something is very wrong.  Fake tears ,keeps referring to his brother as he is still alive. Seems kinda like he is acting. Its off.  Very off
OMG, delusional like his killing machine brother..  enough about the comps already,  he is a blabbling bullshiter.  Put your money where your mouth is, all his assets should be given to the victims, his money, houses, etc..the least the Paddock Family can do,,and if Steve is as careing as you keep saying, it should be done without question.
Well, he sucks at being a psychopath. Hmmm. WTF.
He is 100% guilty Brother and girlfriend know more than they stated , talking  a little too much,  he is trying to cover up the truth.  The truth will come out soon.
He says this happens over the course of months sounds like he knows more then he's saying. Also saying his brother is a stand alone guy sounds more like you think he is capable of doing this.
Can someone with a Phd in psychology PLEASE explain me why I just don't believe this guy's emotions? I'm not a profiler, but I have some friends that work for the police and even they told me this brother comes across as weird. Crying without actual tears almost always is fake.
If gambling was a mathematical calculated business no one would do it that does
Guy is full of crap yo he stole his alibi frum breaking bad.  This is like he knew he had brain cancer/lung cancer and wuz going to die in 6 months he's not the kind of guy who wouldn't go into the hospital for treatment. He would of died  He even admits to owning a motor home even attempts to channel the spirit of Heisenberg with his one of many impressions @3:06 He also has mustache + glasses minus tuff guy hat tho. Hmm... Illuminati confirmed yo. He mention taco bell to sound like a Trump supporter wen he look like beta male cuk that voted 4 hilry with his vaj.
A normal response to a human tragedy can be found by listening to the radio commentator when the Hindenberg went down in flames. Utter Sorrow for the lives lost and expressing devastation. That is the correct and normal human response to a tragedy, even if your own family member caused it. We are not armchair psychologists .We are normal people looking at this guy making insane excuses, bragging about money, putting down the majority of Americans for not thinking that $100,000 is a large amount of money, bragging about eating thousands of dollars of sushi and also saying that he and his family are on a different level than the rest of us. He contradicts himself constantly. He makes excuses Instead of expressing genuine grief and sorrow over the lives lost. For those of you who think that this man is normal and that his response is normal, take a look at some of the Interviews from other family members in the past who were in just about the same spot that this guy Eric is in. It is rare to see someone respond the way that he is responding. If you cannot see that, then there is something very wrong with you. You don’t have to be a medical professional to understand that this man has a severe personality disorder. I am a medical professional, and I deal with people just like this guy. He is a narcissistic sociopath. His brother was likely the same and according to accurate reports, his father was on the FBI’s most wanted list. It ran in the family. If you see someone like this be Vigilant. And most of all stay away from that person and report if that person has a large stash of guns or talks of strange end of the world or end of life scenarios. I would not be surprised if this guy does something terrible.
14:50 Steve was an arms.... cuts off, catches himself.  Uh huh.  Arms dealer.  This interview is so bizarre and completely a 180 from what he first said (in first interview)
This second video totally chokes me up and feels genuine. The first seemed too defensive. I feel for him and his family. They didn't chose to live a life of doubting if they could fix this. Really put yourself in this position based on the last conversation you had with your family.
What this guy deems as normal and things that everyone does reveals a lot about the distorted, god-complex reality that this family is living in.
This is to painful for him to think about the victims so he focuses on himself his brother & his family. He has pushed the victims so far into his unconscious mind that is why you don't see any compassion for them or their family & he's clearly in shock. It's called cognitive dissonance
All these FBI detectives in the comment sections are such analytical experts. Keep up that great work in this commentary thread.
People are missing the most important detail that Eric Paddock mentions: You better hope that autopsy reveals that he had a tumour in his brain, because if it won't then we're all in deep trouble.\n\nImplication is clear. Paddock took a conscious decision to do this and thus must have been forced, manipulated or influenced by somebody who left no leads behind. And can do it again.
I mean.... WTF is he talking about?
this guy needs to stfu, you're the brother of a terrorist...thats it an that all... god bless the dead...EXCEPT HIS SICK EVIL BROTHER!!!!
GUNMAN'S BROTHER: The bug in Men In Black put on a Steve suit and went and did this.
Rehearsed and lacks genuine feelings
Crisis Actor.
Steve was a patsy
#SanFer:.
Can anyone say O.J.
hes in total shock..
THOUSANDS
deep shait, son
He’s psychotic.
Aww the poor guy
Ok
This interview sounds scripted!
The Casino knows something/
4:40
Definitely presents Bipolar with psychotic features
Wealthy....has a Chevy lol
Something horrible happened to my brother yea, something horrible happened to thousands of people and 500 were injured and people lost their lives, but yes, you're brother  had something horrible happen to him
Steve was a what sounded like he was about to say arms dealer..!!!!!
This reminds me of the interview with Daniel Cormier, moments after he was knocked out and concuss.  There's some stuff I don't like that Eric says here.  I'm going to look past it though and realize there are reporters at his house, and he's - concuss - over this.  I give him credit for talking to the media and trying to help.  They need to leave this man alone now though, there's nothing more to gain from this and its not good for him, us, and especially the victims families and loved ones.
All you need to ask is two things. \n1) Did he hate trump. \nor\n2) was he a muslim.
I don't understand all the confusion when it comes to motive after this interview. The simplest explanation is that the murderer had a 'postal' reaction to a perceived slight by his employers; the casino's.  There was definitely premeditation but with the emotional chaos that a man often goes through when he feels disrespected; ruminating on the slight and how to get his honor back... and unfortunately for a lot of people he had the resources and social/demographic anonymity to see his plans come to fruition.
Awww I love this. Miley's so fucking sweet.
Wow all this negativity against Hillary Clinton but yet you say nothing great about Donald trump and all the crap he’s doing. Make up your mind, I’m not a us citizen and know that if I had to pick I’d dump trump and have Hillary any day
Jesus fucking christ.  I can't believe this is real.
00:49 Ladyhood ? Is that the skin that covers the clitoris?
She is sooo much better than him? really? why did she lose to him then???
Thank you Hillary Clinton for losing the election and not becoming our president.
Sooo.. is there not a single male writer on the show.. or is it stating the obvious. Not a single male writer supported Hillary. Very telling.... oh. And pathetic.
Oh yeah...god forbid you let her do a late night comedy bit. Fuck her right? These comments are ridiculous.
Well, I guess am supposed to cry now. But the cringe too overwhelming.
Thank you Hilary for being someone who grabs respect by the hand and doesn't try to grab it in other ways
Ah, a hammer sucking porno lickspittle - indeed a role model and reminder of a culture thankfully rejected
why does this have so many dislikes?
I'm in tears. This is everything I hoped for and more! (I do with they did title her as Hillary RODHEM Clinton though!)
Gees this woman's chief adviser was a pedophile freak..no wonder liberals worship her..they love the pedophiles.. fuckign scum #PizzaGate #PodestathePedophile
Anyone who says that Hillary isn’t kind and genuine clearly hasn’t watched this
Omg people in these comments like get over it ! Either way the world is already a freaking mess.
Comments are being deleted just like the amazon reviews of her shitty book
So were they just reading from the cards written by the writer dudes? That would be sad. I mean i still dont like hilary much but could she mess up the country as much as Donald Dumb? Fuck no. *throws Paper towels *
These women aren't making their feminist statement appealing at all rn. As usual. It's just grossing normal people out.
This is so dam pitiful! How desperate is Hilary  to blame everyone but her own dumbass self for losing the election!? Hilary Clinton is a whiny ass bitch and low down piece of shit!
THIS *SUNDAY* *SUNDAY* *SUNDAY!*  COME SEE HILLARY CLINTON'S LALALALALOOOOOSER TOUR!  FEATURING MILEY CYRUS HALF TIME CRYING SPECTACULAR!  *(Triple air-horn blast)* TICKETS ON SALE NOOOOOOOOOOOOW!
Jimmy, we get it. You're a liberal.
Public dick sucking. My god this is embarrassing. And H. looks like a bleached Kim Jong Il.
She deleted all the thank you notes!
She didn't even cry or get emotional herself. Fuck this fake idiot and all the overplayed celebrities supporting her.
Pokemon GO back to the woods. I'm Pokémon GOing to puke
Makes me cry every time! I’m STILL with HER! Love you Hillary♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I can't even listen to it.  GAG
I was brought up to look up to America for inspiration and ideals. Sadly, it has come down to this. How did this happen to America? You were full of awe inspiring people and a great nation.  I am deeply saddened by this pathetic exhibition of mind-numbing madness that has pervaded your once great land.
If I'd been able to read my letter to her, I'd have ended up killing myself the next day with two bullets to the back of my head.
All these women are fucking ugly. Jimmy is loose butthole
She won. She keeps winning. She will always win.
Shows I can't watch anymore for 500.... Sorry Jimmy wrong direction
Geeez !!! Why are you people so hateful? You may not agree with her but you should be more POLITE!!
Thanks for rigging the democratic primaries in your favor Hillary, we’ll never forget!
i dont like hillary but how is possible for someone to like trump? honestly
I read all the I couldn't get through the whole thing comments before I watched it, but figured they were slightly hyperbolic.\n\nNope.

Too much cringe.
love hillary
Cringe compilation #50
Awesome clip!
Every time I think “that bitch should be in jail” I realize SHE’S HILLARY CLINTON....she already is
i just threw up in my mouth.
Anyone else notice this video just went from #16 on Trending to not even on the top 50? In the middle of the night? There's some shady shit going on here folks.. time to start calling it out.
As an outsider, I fully know why this corrupt to the hilt obnoxious Old Haggis lost, it's because of who she is, but how in the fuck can people in the US even still like this lying POS is beyond me. Talk about imbeciles.
I am thoroughly repulsed by this video. Good night @JimmyFallen. I will never watch your show again.
Jimmy...you're SO talented and this is SO beneath you. Clinton is such a scum bucket for trying to steal the spotlight after what just happened in Vegas. And I'm sad to say you're not much better for indulging this corrupt toilet of a human. Truly bummed you think you need ratings this badly. The pre-written note at the end is nothing short of pathetic.
Don't worry Hillary will be your nominee for 2020, so get used to it to lose big. I wish Hillary will beat Mondale's record.
This should be on a permanent video  loop in hell. wtf!
What happened? You suck! Get out of here!
LMAO YouTube took this off trending because they didn't like the reaction it got
So many questions. Why are they thinking her? How unself aware is she? How many of those girls number did Bill get?
I AM SO SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT PARADE OF MISERABLE LOSERS, JIMMY. That's the left in a nutshell. Hollywood preaching victim. All those women are CELEBRITIES WITH ARMED GUARDS. #liberalhypocrisy \nJesus, this is the largest loser tour ever. They should be furious at HC for LOSING the election with a terrible campaign. Old ass losers Hilary, Nancy,  and Biden need to pass the torch to the next generation. I hope an earthquake destroys Hollywood. Nothing but shmut and fascists spreading discord to Americans everywhere. FUCK HOLLYWOOD HYPOCRISY.
this is the most cringe-inducing and downright pathetic thing i've ever seen in my entire fucking life. there is literally nothing i have seen or witnessed that can match the level of second-hand embarrassment and cringe that this evokes in me. that this video has so many upvotes makes me hope for a nuclear armageddon. we do not deserve to live.
I just unsubscribed from Jimmy's show. This isn't what we want and will never watch it again!
SHE'S OLD,  SHE'LL DIE SOON AND RUN HELL.....
the tonight show is GARBAGE!. the up side is at least Hillary Clinton is getting these letters on the Tonight Show instead of the Oval Office.
You gotta wonder if Fallon actually thinks like this.
poor old wrinkled hag doesn't know she lost the presidential race.  poor thing always has to be in the spotlight.  THANK GOD I DONT WATCH THESE LIBERAL LATE NIGHT SHOWS
Hitlery, thank you for trafficking children from Haiti.  Your husband is a rapist.  You are such an evil witch.
I want to throw up!!!  You didnt see the republicans do this shit when Obama won.  Deal with it, yes Trump won!!!
Gets ready to see butt hurt, whiny Trump supporters in the comments because wanting Hillary to lose the election was the only meaning in their sad, pitiful lives...
LOL the dislikes vs likes..   Stay out of Politics Jimmy stick to Entertainment
This is so unforgivably cringe-worthy, I feel my teeth are gonna to explode!!!
Thank you Hilary Clinton for being a voice for the corrupt Government , thank you got being a voice for the crooks in politics  , thank you for shutting down the voices of your husband's rape victims yet claim to be a feminist , thank you for using your voice to call Young black men sexual predators ( yes realy ) and yet Pretened to be a supporter of minorities , thank you Hilary for losing an easy election .
Hilary has the body of a python digesting a freshly swallowed capybara.  Is this part of jimmies animal handler visits?
The cringe factor is off the scale
I predict an unprecedented like to dislike ratio. What a joke of a video. No self-respect, no self-awareness whatsoever.
This is a GROUP THERAPY SESSION for these people..... They are STILL in mourning over the election results. IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR, PEOPLE. MOVE ON.
no one fucking cares that you happen to be female, stop using it as a shield against any and all criticism that has to do with your character and or policies, this isnt the 1800's lady. you lost because you ran a garbage campaign and people dont trust you or your horndog of a husband.
Vomit. I thought this was a satyre until the horror of what this is dawned on me.
Thank you Hillary Clinton for having a vagina....\n\nLiterally all that they could think of to thank her for.
Oh dear, I'm only 1 minute in and my barf bucket already full.
Where's the pickle jar from her prior appearance? Don't tell me she had those innocent pickles murdered too!Hate this witch.
I'm never watching you again
This is embarrassing. Just when I thought that these people couldn't embarrass themselves any further NOPE. This is like some sort of weird Narc ritual lol? It's like the insanity never ceases... I know that this was just drama used for clickbait but damn if this isn't desperate.
late night comedy
Ew
Fuck off Fallon
Garbage
I dont want to Speak cuz DISLIKES already did ...
WTH is this?
i threw up
🖕🏻🖕🏻
Hillary Clinton!!' 😍😍😍😍 💙💙💙#imstillwithher \n#fucktrump 😂
we cant stop, and we wont stop :')
Cringe gold
Why are there so many sour angry ppl hating? We know she didn't win the presidential election. No need to keep bringing it to everyone's attention. Its clear to everyone who is in office now and definitely not anyone with a brain. She may have lost the election but clearly she's won many hearts.
HILLARY 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽\nFUCK TRUMP 🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🤦🏽‍♂️👎🏽\n#Imwithher
I posted a video last week about my love for second hand shopping! If you didn't see that, then here is the link for you! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNjqAaNNgcw <3
stick with the steasons honestly sounds like a band name
make a video showing how you sterilize jewelry?
Floral dress fits you like a glove.You look lovely in all the clothes you've chosen. Love the haul vlogs.x
Oh, I loved the outfit you were wearing while showing the watch! :)
I've been waiting for the thrift hauls! I love the blue dress
I love chairty shopping! You find such unique peices you dont find anywhere else
Yes! Rebecca thursday! Something to look forward to on a thursday
When will you be posting your hoarding documentary?
She looks beautiful in all of them, I'm jealous 😆
Just a little note about shoes: I am aware that I didn't dabble on shoes too much or show the shoes off... I've become aware of people sexually exploiting my feet, so whilst that's in full swing - I'm not going to show my feet. It's actually upset a few of us on here and although we can't stop people using our images, we can try and diffuse where we can. I know other YouTubers like Emma actually blurr their feet now in hauls. So if you see your favourite YouTubers not showing their feet/shoes (in hauls/lookbooks etc) at the moment, then this is why.\n\nOriginally I talked more about the black pair of sandals (and planned to demonstrate), however I cut it all out in the end and shot without my feet.... Anyway! The black pair of sandals are really good for me, they strap my feet down well and support, despite the little black heel! I'm really happy with the find, despite not really talking about it! <3
So many of these are seriously so cute.  You may not follow trends (neither do I...why bother) but you seem to have a good sense for things that look good on you.  I love thrift stores!  Found many of my favorite articles of clothing there.
your jewelry is always amazing!
you sound a bit  breathless hope u are okay
I love the necklace that you're wearing!
Looks like you found some pretty good things. I love the blue skirt and shoes, super cute 😊
I hope you do more hauls in the future! xxx
Lady Rebecca is absolutely beautiful...I dare anyone to object...
I don’t normally watch haul videos, but as someone who when growing up frequently visited thrift shops, I find this quite interesting. You should make more.
I am so jealous of your finds!  Anytime I try out charity/thrift shops I rarely find anything good.  You have a great wardrobe filled with so many lovely finds.
You look amazing and have great modelling skills.  We have confidence in you. :)
I would love more of these videos
That blue dress looks amazing on you. I don't really like wearing second hand clothes, it's just the way I am, but I do get DVDs, old computer games and books from charity shops. DVDs especially, since I am old-fashioned and like physical copies of my films. If you're patient and don't mind being a few years behind the film industry , you can find them in their original plastic cover for no more than £2.99, depending on the area and shop. Jigsaws as well. You never need to buy a jigsaw at full retail price either. The other day I found a sealed copy of SimCity 3000 for £1.25 from a Cancer Research shop.
OMG I used to live in front of the Isle of Wight 😍
I live in Portsmouth so it was great to see someone else loving some of my local places :)
This is such a great video! I would love to see another one of these! Greetings and love from Germany!❤
Hello from the Isle of Wight! I'm a bit of a clothes hoarder and my things have been donated to charity shops all over the island - it's funny to think that you were probably flicking through rails full of my donations, haha!
One of my favorite thrift stores where I live is called Lifelong and they support HIV/AIDS resources in the area in many ways including hosting testing days. I enjoy knowing my already cheap purchase is going to have a bigger impact than shopping fast fashion
I absolutely love listening to you speak. Your voice is so beautiful! You did well on your purchases good job!!
More videos like this please!!!!
The blue dress is my favorite, but I also love the earrings and choker that you have on! Blue is my favorite color and was the color of my bridesmaids dresses at my wedding 13 years ago! My daughter has always had a hard time finding shoes. She also has skinny feet, especially at her heels. Finding her shoes when she was a kid was an absolute nightmnare.
That floral dress fits so well it looks tailored. You look fantastic
Absolutely nothing wrong with your modeling skills, Rebecca. Very nicely presented. The blue at 4.50 looked great! Your 10+ years of making YT videos is indeed showing. You're doing an excellent job filming and editing!
Looking gorgeous in your blue floral dress. Have a great day!
I didn't realize shoes could be that inexpensive. I don't think I own a pair of shoes that cost me less that $100.
Beckie, there's a woman working in my local supermarket who looks exactly like you!! You're both beautiful!
You're looking so well in your recent handful of videos. It's lovely to see.
Hey Beckie, I'd just like to recommend a series on the BBC Three YouTube channel, it's called Overshadowed. If you haven't watched it already, then give it a go! I love it and I'd also love to see someone review it! Love the new video and love you, stay strong, beautiful xx
I never watch hauls but I really enjoyed this! I'd love to see a favourites video :)
I love the floral dress and the coral blazer, especially together! ❤️ Really I love all the things you’ve shown today; you have such good luck with thrifting!
I went to Portsmouth too! It's lovely there :)
That floral dress is gorgeous on you. It shows off your figure and I really love it on you. You look beautiful.
I love your patterned trousers where did you get them from?
ahh i love thrifting too! it's like treasure hunting! regular shopping is exhausting and dreary for me but thrifting is always like a little adventure 😊
You dress very well, one thing I hate in modern fashion is Grey baggy tracky   bottoms, they are awful.
You don't need to be completely bound to the steasons.
Wow, that charity superstore must've been a dream... I bet they had to drag you out of there at closing time, haha! :D
Theres nowt wrong with your modelling skills 😉\nThe floral and the blue dress are excellent finds. \nMy weakness in charity shops tends towards pewter tankards (the older the better) and cufflinks (more pairs than you can shake a stick at), with the odd tweed jacket thrown in if its the right size/colour/pattern and make lol
YES. Before I even watch! LOVE!
Loved everything on you.
The dresses at 4:50 and 6:30 really suit you :D
You should do more fashion videos I loved this x
I love thrifting as well we have a big shop where the proceeds go to charity some are last seasons clothes from high street stores and other stuff is secondhand. It's amazing what you can find I buy clothes secondhand on eBay too, as student I'm always trying to save money.
Beckie I love you so much ❤️
I love the watch and mint skirt. After watching this I realized we have similar taste in clothing :)
I loved this! Such a wonderful, positive video 💕
Went op shopping with my mum today. 'Twas great fun :D
I love thrifting and I would love to see more videos on this topic! Great video! I love all your videos!
Has anyone ever told you you look like lady Diana? At least in my opinion haha. Lovely video as always by the way :)
That blue dress is so hot.....(6.25)
Beckie, my feet are a half size difference and I totally know your frustration! But instead of always squeezing your foot into a shoe that's too small (or having one shoe be too big) you can get insoles that bridge the difference! It seriously made a huge difference for me and now I love buying shoes :)
The fairy skirt is lovely on you.
I like the wooden cat, My GFs grandpa used to carve little monkeys out of peach pits for her and now that he is gone they feel so precious. I wonder who carved your cat.
You look absolutely stunning in those blue dresses!
Wow I have that same wooden cat!! I wonder where they originally came from... 😮
Good Morning from America Rebecca <3
Was vincents de paul today with mum
I'm so happy that this video exists!  You got me into thrift shopping, Rebecca😄
I love it!
<3 <3 <3

Awesome Rebecca!! Great finds & you look super cute 💖
Your trending
More Asmr i pray , x
Your voice is so damn calming.
Wow you're super Cute
Beautiful beckie I LOVE YOU beckie🍎
You look very elegant.
You're trending! Well done :)
Everything is so cute 💖💖💖
Every day more beatiful
Te diré eres hermosa desde una lengua que no entiendes xD
I love thrifting but i never find clothes that fit. But i wont give up i just love thrifting!
Beckie, I feel you my feet are exactly the same too long and thin , I walk weird and i have small ankles so most shoes are too big around the ankle .
I love the blue skirt ! Also, you look amazing un the blue dress !\nHave a nice day Rebecca !
I used to do pricing in charity shop and it all goes on brands, the better the brand and the hight quality/condition the higher the price
I love the trousers you were wearing when you showed the watch, but all of the thrifted stuff looks great too
BECKYYYY you don‘t have to use silver cleaner! Just put a piece of aluminum foil and some normal salt inside a bowl with warm water and add the silver jewelery. Let it sit for 10min no longer than 20 - et voila!
Ive noticed that ur not running your hands through your hair like u usually do
When did you go to the Isle of Wight? I live there, the charity shops are quite expensive which is a shame. :)
One of my favorite things is the floral tight fitting dress. It looks so good on you and the colors are so pretty❤️❤️❤️
Terrible modeling skills.  You take that back!\nYou are amazing!\nAll the outfits were spot on!\nI've said it to you before. You should pursue modeling and/or spokesmodel jobs.\nYour voice is incredible. That smile. To die for.\nThat hairstyle. Awesome! No one would know about your condition.\nDoes anyone else out there think the same thing?\n\nGreat video Beckie!\n👍👍
Are charity shops like antique stores? Sorry I'm not too familiar with the British lingo :P hahaha I've just never heard them called that! Great video as always Rebecca! :)
Hmm that wooden cat is brilliant and has given me an idea to try to make a dog version
I wish I could thrift like you do! But as someone who’s considered ‘plus size’ for most clothes it’s harder to find clothes at all
I love bracelets but it is hard to find a bracelet that fits without running up and down my wrists cause I have thin wrists like you.
the Thrift Shops are so expensive where I live...
You should see if u can get led softboxes , will never blow up again, ill have a look for ya
i could never wear second hand even after being washed i still find disgusted by them like they dirty and you dont know where they've been stored or worn by doing what.  yuck but if u dont mind that then good for u .
The main differnece between good open office and the terrible one is the height of the ceiling.\nJust look at the Wright´s Johnson Wax Headquarters.. the ceiling is so high comparing to standart shitty offices.\nYou can have the best furniture and layout, but if your height of the space is not enough you are just in a fascist box.
Finally! Lately open offices are under attack again and again, I personally hate them. Zuckerberg was very proud of having the biggest open office in the world, and honestly  it's horrible.
They give you a more open concept
what everyone loves about the VOX is how detailed and accurate they do their research before making their videos.
Well closed offices where overrated at one point too but I do agree closed offices are better.
I like cubicles though, you can't really personalize 'open offices' without infringing on your neighbor's rights.
Hey I have heard of Frank Lloyd Wright because of the road named after him in Arizona.
Open offices weren't created by hip millennials Chill Vox, don't cut yourself on that edge.
Sounds like someone wants a private office at Vox
$80 for att fiber 200 down 100 up too much to use
This video was very interesting to me in particular because I am an Architecture student, but i think the title We need to talk about Open Offices or Rethinking the 'Open Office' would have been better suited. Great video nonetheless !
Wright was a hipster - before it was cool.
Ola Phil,  Got that list you asked me about yesterday.  Great service. They guarantee privacy.  https://stantonestateauction.yolasite.com/
I feel like this is a video for your boss lol.
open work space also meant everyone can spy on each other. great for the boss!
Even as a college student I never liked open seating libraries.  I always gravitated to one of those individual study booths with high walls.  Too much distractions if I just sit at an open study table with other students coming and going, talking, and even sometimes not studying at all but sleeping.
Offices in general are overrated. Spending 10 years of your life in whatever kind of office is cruel.
stop saying copy of a copy of a copy we get it it's not a clever line or anything just stop.
id much rather have closed spaces. i worked at an open concept layout, hated it. id rather have some cubicles and whatnot
Is it true in case of open libraries too?
Open office is distraction less productive not in my own world not in the zone.
Same as open concept schools
My first experience in an open office was a nightmare. A co-worker, who had collections as a part of her job, would get rather feisty with a past due account - while I was trying to sell to a new one.  \nI kept trying to mute her out when I wasn't talking but then she'd shreik while I was speaking and I wanted to crawl under my desk and die.  So embarraising.
Please do more videos about architecture!
You talked a little bit about how real estate agents see each square metre of space as a dollar sign and i agree. Its one of the driving factors behind the continued bastardisation of tge office designa you've previously mentioned.\nThese days the best examples of office design acknowledge the need for not just open and closed spaces, but activity specific work space. You have to take in to account the kind of work your office performs daily and design spaces that accomodate to to those sorts of tasks. \nGreat clip!
This is so wrong in so many ways.
the nearly 10 full years of your life you spend inside the 4 walls of one room\n\nPlease kill me now.
I really don't like this series -I haven't learned anything, I've just been complained to for 2 minutes
💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕   #💕💕💕💕   #💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕      #💕💕💕💕   #💕💕💕💕\nJesus Christ promises all who believe in Him eternal life.\nHe died for us rose from the dead, and Now He lives forever!\nHe will also heal your body!
Now it makes sense sadly.
Just as the copies of Frank Lloyd Wright degraded open offices, Vox's attempts to copy Errol Morris and Eugene Jarecki are degrading cool documentaries. \n\nSeriously guys, your topics are cool, but these are overproduced in really boring and derivative ways. You don't need to lay the 'cool' on so thick...
Wish I could post a picture of the view from my private office overlooking downtown Vancouver across False Creek with mountains as the backdrop. I face the window. Awesome! I can nap when it hits me, eat lunch slowly at my desk watching this video and generally relax until I get home with my toddler and 5 year old and dinner, and bath and bedtime...
...as long as you don't take my pager, typewriter, overhead projector, & franklin planner; then i'm good!
Color me surprised when they mention someone calling a box fascist.
OPEN OFFICE!!! I knew i wasn't a racist.
Open offices suck. Productivity gets squashed.
Cubicles > Open offices
Ughhh that whistling S sound makes me cringe
Bureaulaanshaft!
Vox supports and defends terrorist
It's true.
Office workers are overrated.
Morden works? = copied old works => new stuffs
slap a design hipster TO-DAY!
Vox is so...\n\n\n\n\n\nOverrated
Vox is overrated
*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldWorld*
I feel like puking 🤢 I hate offices in any shape or form
Monks didn't have problems working that way because they weren't talkative
open offices actually hinder my productivity and creativity.
The open office thing started in large cities with Lofts. Then the loft thing became hip and trendy. It's that simple.
Want to make MONEY FROM HOME TODAY GUARANTEED get started here IT WILL change your life click the link and GET STARTED TODAY https://BestEasyWork.com/eionismylife
the box is fascist symbol? then circles are communist.
I have never been so miserable as I was when I have to listen the guy at the desk next to me sniffle and snort up snot every 10 seconds for 3 solid years.  Open offices are bullshit.
How dare you VOX their not overrated their beautiful creatures and if you're just racist and jealous.
A lot of people do things based on the trend. If it is trendy, hyppie and indy to have open spaces - they do open space etc. Everything is fashion, people are following a fashion, but the days when this fashion becomes something old and then an older thing becomes fashionable again will come. Then today's trendies, libtards and other leftists will feel old and outdated.
I just can't get over the massive dichotomy between the overwhelming support given to Vox's non-political videos and the fervent hatred shown toward its political ones.
I've built out several offices over my career and this is all true.  It's ALL about packing people in for least cost.  The negative impact on productivity is palpable.  \n\nYes, there are some groups which work well in an open config but NOT core developers -- they need to concentrate and the audio and visual distractions of open plans lower productivity -- they're being paid high salaries but it's wasted on sweatshop-style workplaces affecting productivity.\n\nThis is also the reason we have mushy silent keyboard -- so not to bother others sitting next to you.\n\nA force-feedback clicky keyboard make you a much better and accurate typist as you get a feel and audible feedback as you work.  The IBM 5150 Type M keyboard is a treasured find and why new variants on the mechanical KB are back in vogue again at home where you can make as much noise as you want.
I recently worked in a real open office... no cubicles. It was horrible.
I'm a conservative but I have to admit vox makes some good interesting videos.
As an Interior Designer, this is so true, it is a lot cheaper the open office way, and in my office my boss put us in one single big desk, and I HATE it, I mean, I don't need to interact with my coworkers, we all need our own space, our way to say Hey, this is my desk. And with our clients it's different, we barely propose to them an open office.
Boxes a fascist symbol?! Perhaps Wright said something else, but the crappy audio recording got garbled and twisted his words or something...
that particular open office by Wright was notoriously leaky.
Grank lloyd wrighnt is the undisputed king if architecture
Did you just spend 6 minutes telling me that a poorly designed office is overrated even when it's called an open office?
This is the kind of Vox video I enjoy watching, purely educational
I was hoping that he would include George Nelson. Components of this furniture were marketed as the action office. Better drink a lot of coffee.
The best place to work is from home. Full stop.
@Vox lovely format, but you spoke very vaguely, never saying WHAT Wright did right imitators did wrong, or what the problems with open offices today actually ARE.
Frank Lloyd Wright - one of the architect legend
I had to think about Fight Club through the whole vid
For creativity, it's imperative that some people have their own space to work. The open office format is distracting if anything and doesn't give adults the privacy we rate as professionals.
how can you hate the cubicle?
I think he meant the boxes are communist
And that's the reason why you should go freelance
People don't slack off as much in open office plus get more people in the same space
Yes! Thank you, let's get the word out! Open office spaces do not help in doing 'deep work' which is the only valuable state of mind in a knowledge economy.
I HATE OPEN OFFICES!! I designed many open offices, these are offices suitable for extroverts and cheaper, that's why a lot of people like it. I need my enclosed space! And I too, ended up using headphone to create my space. Damn it!!
should be ended with scene from Office Space, when they slaughter the copy machine!
Take a shot every-time he says office 🥃🍻
Wow I’m so lucky to have my own private desk that’s not like the one described above
Wow. Something that Trump doesn't have to do with anything in this vid? Is VOX back to normal now?
A open office sucks, at leas for the most parts. What you want is a hybrid. A normal office area and a open office area so you get the best of both worlds and then you can combine them together into a environment that functions for your specific work force.
This is the good stuff Vox. I think I talk for most saying that we prefer this over the political stuff. I know it likely takes more time and planning, but it is definitely worth it, keep it up!! :)
If you want an office you gotta earn it, simple as that
looks like somebody needs a private office space lol
Open offices are garbage. Constant interruptions kill productivity.
Bungie had an open office during the development of halo 2.
Open spaces are just a pain, specially when somebody eats his smelly lunch at his desk.
Dose this channel post daily?
I think vox is the better stronger less sjw buzzfeed !
I work for New York City, and Bloomberg decided that all New York City offices would switch to open-office right before he left. So now we are all in an open Office environment, and it's terrible. Someone having a conversation 20 feet away completely distracts you from what you're doing. It's like Bloomberg wanted to help his fellow hyper capitalists prove that government workers were inefficient by putting us in an environment that was guaranteed to make us less efficient.
I think offices should be designed by the employees with only a few rules. One rule is that it must be a mixture of open office and private rooms. The walls should not be fixed but can be detached and laid out in any layout the employees like - even diagonal walls. Private rooms can hold up to only 3 people. A few rooms must be available for single workers. Now the fun part: No one has a fixed space. You grab whatever you like when you get to work, provided someone hasn't taken it already. After 6 months, the employees must layout the entire office again. Final rule: the boss and other execs don't get private offices. They have the same as everyone else.
Great video!, if anyone knows more documentaries about office desing, please share with me!
DO YOU KNOW WHAT OVER RATED EVEN MEANS!!?!?!!?

2 vtrigger are good but you are late Capcom more hype please you need to work seriously on your game ...maybe you need to try for  this game on 2v2 ...(just try it  :) ) not like sfxt but like Capcom fighting jam !!! believe me try it on the next beta with more dlc
thx, sold it like a year ago.
Will grab it on PC for sure. Sad to see that this updated version of the game is still not going to be pushed out on the Xbox One with the Xbox One X just around the corner. Game will fall behind other fighting games due to that. A lot of money being lost with that decision.
Please make it where the character select screen comes up when we are playing online matches.
At first I was like naaaaah but then it was all FREE UPDATE AND I WENT ALL *HELL YEAH*
Finally the full game that should have been realeased 2 years ago.
I need more than this weak trailer if you want to compete with DBZ.
too little to late capcom...
This is FREE DLC for current owners. Just buy the base game right now at a discount and get everything else free in January.\nAnd for people who can't read/research, ALL Season 1 & 2 characters are included for FREE. It says so at the end of the trailer and Yoshinori Ono also confirmed this on his latest video.
Now we need Capcom to do this kind of update for MVCI!!!!
Hopefully in the next few years later, Capcom should release SFV: Ultra Arcade Edition including all DLC characters, stages, and costumes.
Bro , this shit legit looks like a brand new fuckin game. Well done Capcom , well done  . . .
Free updates ! Amen Capcom ! i luv that game ! the eyes chico they never lies !)
yeah fuck crapcom fuck street fighter screw the community for wasting there time on this bring back darkstalkers rivial school captain commando power stone strider gools & ghosts maxsimo mega man x needs come back enough with the street fighter
here we go again. only a fool would pick this up.  this game is essentially a F2P atm where everything is locked behind paywall. wait for SUPER Street Fighter V Arcade hyper deluxe gold edition that'll include all skins and characters for free.
Sooo for the people who didnt  buy any character season pass. we basically get them for free now?
I can't believe it took 2 years for the SFV beta to finish\n\nAnd over a year to add in VS CPU
After hearing all the details it is kinda everything i complained about. New v trigger. Arcade mode bigger character roster in a single convenient package. Now it is even made free for us too? Way to go! I only want a second super for each character and then i think this game would be at its peak performance.
I feel like THIS is the official release, before it was all beta, now it's finished
Wait so still no xbox...welp time to convert!
Inb4 this is the Skyrim of fighting games
Finally Capcom, you open your eyes.
Poor akuma is losing his fight with diabetes.
I knew I should've gotten KOF XIV when I had a chance.
I hope they give better defensive options.
Don't muck this up Capcom!
Capcom logic: NEVER BUY THE FIRST RELEASED BETA VERSION!
I think this is a good thing, like what Max's video he uploaded not too long ago. In a way Capcom is apologizing to it's fans by giving those a chance to buy the Arcade Edition with completely new modes, etc. Those who stuck by the game since launch will get a free update for keeping the game alive, no cash involved.\n\nLike this legit freaked me out because it's exactly what I think Max was talking about in his last video. Not wanting Capcom to crash and burn, but apologizing to its fans and learning in a healthy way of what to do with future projects.
Good thing i never bought the dlc in real money if FM is not enough, budget wise i presume
And they finally removed Juri! Wait!?
If you think clearly, it's actually still unfair, they only give free updates on gameplay and modes, while it should have been there when the game first release.\nI hope they will somehow offer current players with decent amount of free Fight Money to get more DLC characters. As the base game started with a poor amount of playable characters and background, not to mention the Season 1 and Season 2 passes are costing too much, you buy the base game, buy the season 1 and 2 character passes, just count the amount you've spent on the game's characters which are all supposed to be there at the launch.\nAnd now, they are bringing out Arcade Edition, I bet the game pricing will be similar as the normal version at the launch, and how is that fair? Paying that amount and gets all the characters. =S
I wish they would change the colors like they used to back in the day. Still hype for this though
......For some reason, I remembered one of the old Tekken intros. Not sure which one though.
New V Triggers? Finally......Fi...Fi...Finally.......OMG I’m just happy.....
Thank God I did not buy the game when it was released.
So is this the full game? still looks like a demo
I should've not bought kolin today 😞
who ever make the ARCADE EDITION text in the logo must have done it within 5 minutes and there are no other iteration done afterward. Kind of amateurish job here CAPCOM
I'm happy. I just wish Alex made a cameo.
YES!! New another SF5 version reeeeeally hoping they came as a good as Ultra SF4
wait, i have a question.\ni don't have street fighter v yet, maybe i will buy the ps4 at the end of the year o later. and buy the game in real life (no digital). that update will be for me too? - From a friend.
HELL YEAH now this is the Capcom and SFV ive been waiting for
I really hope C. Viper gets added into this one lol
Waiting for Ultra Street Fighter 5
heck yeah! hoping Q and Dudley make it in season 3!
Hopefully they fixed the load times. :)
Will the faces be fixed in this new version?
Thank you for making this free for people who bought the game. Very much hype. Now classic characters please and you can have my money.
I guess this is their formal way of acknowledging they f'ed up the initial release. Even though all this is coming via free update I feel for the Street Fighter fans who waited almost two full years to get the complete version of a game they bought in 2016. Better late than never I suppose for those that stuck around.
first keyboard binding options, now this? yes!!!
Finally the entire game!
Anyone else think that this is just damage control after the release of MVCI
Awesome! Now, to wait for MvC:I to do the same.
Arcade Mode 2 years after release... you can suck my dick Crapcom .i.
No xbox one no party
hopefully it's not too late for SFV
it took this long?
Great news! Get Hype!!! Capcom kept their promise not to fragment the online playerbase and that all gameplay related content (characters + game modes) is unlockable by playing for existing players, who purchased the base game only.
I'm glad I didn't get ripped off the first time around,  I pre ordered and everything. But now this game finally might be worth buying. Looking forward to it.
I'm so excited for this upgrade. I hope Arcade have a ending cinematic. 😃👏👍❤️
hopefully this makes the game fun
so everyone who brought this game and its DLC is getting fucked !  nice job CRAPCOM
Called it, been waiting for this edition and knowing my luck will have mostly still more dlc coming out
How will the Capcom hate circle jerk twist this into being negative? I'm excited to find out
Akuma is like Get the fuck outta here, Ryu. Lion Flower Demon Man is taking this cover art\nXD
>Arcade Edition\n>Don't even get costume DLC\n\nCapcom are the greediest fucks in the industry and I'm glad their games are selling poorly. Get the fuck out of here charging me six bucks per costume when in SFIV days you got like five costumes for four bucks.
cant wait
Too little too late
Meu Deus ♥ ♥ ♥.
About fucken time
I knew it.....it begins......
Damn January?
I am gay
DEAL OR NO DEAL\nNO DEAL
Me too
HADUUUUUKEN
HELL YEAH
Fuck YEAH!!
Evil Ryu confirmed!
Well done, Capcom
0:32 there ya go. o/
I'm so hyped, really.
It begins....
Please have uncensored Mika booty slaps
NANI? カプコン応援してるよ
Kolin bae
Sagat?
What kind of idiots downvoting this?
Capcom mercenária como sempre.
Haters WILL be left behind!
00:39 Evil Ryu Confirmed for Season 3\nGET HYPE !!!
0:33 DAB
Never saw this coming...
Poison in Street fighter v in season 3
Fuck you Crapcom I paid 60 bones at launch trying to support you bastards and you release another edition a year later with all the DLC for 30 bones. I can't stand you mothafuckas and your inept business practices. I'm not spending another dime on SFV and I'm not buying MVCI fuck you.
its sad that current sfv holders who haven't bought any of the dlc characters aren't going to get the dlc characters for free
Fuck street fighter i paid money for all those characters and now they are free with the game price reduced
Here my question: Can Chun-Li avenge her master by facing Akuma?\n\nThis idea has been in my head since his dlc.
So the people who paid a fortune for all the characters gets shit on? Why get a season pass if you can just wait and get it for free? It's pretty obvious this is like a failing MMO going F2P. We all know it's going downhill.
I am going to post some short videos on Instagram (@ChrisFixit) answering some questions like if I was able to make a U-turn instead of a K-turn now. Also I am almost at 100k followers on Instagram so be sure to follow! Once I hit 100k I am doing a giveaway of ChrisFix swag with 7,000 winners!!!
for sharper turns
U are genius

totally awesome!
HOAX
Need some wider fenders now
next ep of drifting ??
bukmukhhh ??
Amazing
love the transition <3
Finally! But upload more plz!
What if my tires hit my leaf springs (90 Wrangler)
U r genius man !! U earned a subscriber.
21 trending wohoo
The sound the torque wrench makes is so satisfying
Please, for sake of everyone driving on the road with you, do more research on this mod before trying it yourself. ALOT can go wrong and it might not go wrong until you are at high way speeds.
can this be done with a FWD car?
just pop the tires, and go gta 5 style uncontrollable
Your initial measuring is either wrong or you car has issues as the left turn angle of left wheel should be greater than the right turn of the same wheel - this is because it represents the inner radius of a turning circle; the inside wheel in a turn needs to describe a smaller radius than the outside!
ChrisFix's new video! Oh man, i like it!
Wow you came out of hiding Chris haha just kidding
How many blue gloves have been used by @Chrisfix? 🤔🤔🤔
First of all, you didn't take the corner at the beginning wide enough which is why you had to drive into the driveway. You had plenty of space to go out wider. Maybe you just don't know how big your car is.
Been waiting for this one
8:35 you just changed my life with that screwdriver trick :o
I’m really so prod and happy for you men!! I’m a really old follower and it’s amazing to see your progerss in every video, 25 in trending and I’m always wating for more!!
ChrisFix I have been looking to run spacers on the front wheels but I keep reading most manufacturers don't recommend it! Just wanted your opinion!
More freedom to wrap that FR deathtrap up. Genius.
No point unless your drifting, which is why he doing this.
what if we have pitmen and drag link style steering? like for a jeep or other 4wd vehicles?
That sad feeling when Chris Fix uses degrees instead of radians.  :(
Engineering explained said spacers do wear out the bearings quicker
Will this modification help me escape from the cops?
You should do commercials or something you you got a dope voice
Still not as good as my Ford broncos turning radius 😋
i wonder if this would work on a 2017 f-150 rwd
Laugh so hard when he said add some threadlocker, actually that too much.LOL anyways very entertaining to watch
i have no problem about my cars turning radius (4,5 m), but i still watch this because it's so informative and simple.
I love watching your videos
I have never heard of it being called a K-turn.. In Australia is is referred to as a 3-point turn, and a U-turn is colloquially known as chucking a U-ey haha
Idk if it's a good idea to make the front of a mustang sharper #crowdlivesmatter
Any performance mods coming up? Supercharger, turbo, or just small things like air intake and distributor/coil?
can you make a video how to clean under car
King Pin mods here are illegal, I would guess this limiter mod is also illegal or at least insurance will use this as an excuse to not pay out.
it is same 99-04 mustang?
You're one of the few Youtubers with over one million subs that actually replies to their fans. You, my dude, are true awesomeness!
There may be no contact with the sway bar if you checked it at ride height.
But now the tires may rub the fender flares...
Should I do this with my 2008 Civic? Daily
I don’t know what took me so long, but I found a great YouTube channel. You got a new subscriber ChrisFix.
Chris, research  some more on why your steering angles were off, loaded and unloaded will be different, camber/caster is different. These things I would imagine are obvious to you, however you're neglecting information.  your SAI, inclination and TOOT\nPlay a big part in SAFETY but more to your concern, consistency in drifting. Snap steer, bump steer, wheel hop and dragging front tires are some of the more serious concerns from mods like this.
You'll just mess up the whole suspension geometry by adding spacers, but that's no problem. American muscle cars aren't made to go around corners, so suspension geometry doesn't matter.
You sound like Jeff from American dad lolololol
I've seen them spacers on a 04 Taurus. They were smaller though. Great video as usual
this dude deserves alot of appreciation for how well thought out and produced his videos are. Really good work my guy.
My neighbor died in a Ford Fiesta.
Y u no real man and do u turn burnout
Perfect! Now it’s time to drift haha! :D
I like your name.....Chris. Sounds cool.
Great video man!\nLove getting the notifications when there’s a new video up lol.
You are crazy my friend... in a great way!
Why was this video get an ad by a condom thing 😂
ah but can it give more torque and hp?
Odds of the boot remaining on after sliding it off of the rack and pinion and back on-zero.
Have you thought about a body kit for the driftstang?
You sold the corvette ?
What a lovely morning, TGIF and new ChrisFix video :)\nAgain thanks for the very good quality work, and greetings from Hungary :)
It’s like a dose of heroin you get your fix, your ChrisFix that is!
wow...your vids are getting better and better...nice camera work...
Chris u rock.Keep those nice videos and don't let any idiots letting you down.Btw nice drift Mustang
Your videos are edited very well
But This will mess up your alignment....
I hope you punched the guy that put wheel weights on your polished lips.
Love having a Mustang bc you. Make more Mustang vids
Love your videos man! Keep it up!
And no spacers in the back? It looks akward as hell.
New tires  I wonder how long they gonna last with u
What are the ramifications of doing this?
So stoked for you to finally get to wheel spacers and wheel adapters! 🙌🏽
Congrats Chris! You got it to trending!
Research your car before taking off or trimming your rack limiter. Some cars have weak power steering pumps/systems that can't handle the extra turning angle.
Now your gonna need some spacers for the rear wheels or some wider rims to make the look as good as the front.
Won't that causes traction roll. 😨
o god, spacers at the front... this is fckt up for everything, from suspension because of increased unsprung mass, to tire wear and steering properties because you change the steering offset and tire scrub.
1:44\n Turning Diameter of 19ft*. Radius is only to the halfway point. Diameter is all the way across the circe.....hmmm maybe i did learn something in high school.
my dude made it to trending page
Do the spacers make your wheels look wider ?
Best damn youtuber i watch
Nice ride 🚘
Those PVC limiters seem like a bad idea to me.  Not very strong and liable to crack under pressure.
So the car turns more to the right than the left?
What about fwd ? Where do I go to find this clamp
I don't know why you're  not developing AMG engines yet..
That red dot on your tire is supposed to line up with the valve stem...
Clicked on the video ranndomly, would have left if the transitions, planning and production of the video wasn't amaziinng. Niice
Your transitions have improved dramatically in this video. Good job.
So many ways of saying k turn. I've heard that, J turn, and 3 point term. I say the latter where I'm from.
Oprah Winfrey can i hold your Melons???LMAO 😂🤣
3:45 Lmfao . Tat woman covering her little girl's eyes wen ellen shwed the magazine cver....xDD
Ellen shopping with Michelle Obama was better imo
I saw this on another site earlier....part I & II....LOVE it.....it is a blessing to see this after how this week began.\n\n🙏💔VEGAG💔🙏
OMG, E and O together... that's amazeballs. If I were that woman I'd do whatever in my power to exchange contact info and make a way to meet again.
hey hey i love ellen and i am a 11
If Oprah kept up with her 'friend' she would have known the last time Ellen frequented a supermarket was with Michelle Obama.
You SURE they didn’t break into that Vodka?!? 😂😂😂
Everyone just pulls out their phones :(
The melon thing was hilarious. Ellen is so funny and it comes so naturally to her.
The 2 most horrible women in recent history
I would be in there so quick buying and then reselling those Oprah-touched peaches on eBay
If I was there I would try to get in all the video
That little girl at 2:43 wasn’t feeling oprah lmfao
I thought they were starting a feud 😂😁😂
Ellen bringing out the LV bags $$$
You get a melon, You get a melon, You get a melon, You get a melon, You get a melon, Everyone get a Melon!!!!
Why does it seem Ellen tries too hard? The way she orchestrates a situation just doesn't seem to have the desired impact.
Why are you on youtube? You have a cable television format? Is that not enough to satisfy you?
OMG! I love these two!!!
LMAO are we just gonna skip the fact that that little girl swerved KWEEN OPRAH at 2:42 ???
That little girl was like 'who are these crazy women?'
I don't watch much Ellen so whenever I hear her talk I keep thinking that Dory is  there.
Has Ellen ever driven a car or did he butler
Please do more public appearances like this. I love it.
I stopped watching soon as they showed every single person holding up there phones.
I've only seen Gelson's grocery stores in more affluent areas of California.
Ellen just kidnapped that family 😰 they just wanted a fun taco Tuesday 🌮 jk
At first I was like why there's no one shopping then everyone showed up I was like damn
All I can think is how cute that little girl's side ponytail is, lol!
I miss this when Ellen did it with Michelle Obama :(
Can't stand these stupid hens !
Damn Oprah is thicc af and has some nice melons😃
I love them both! Such intelligent women.
Best friends 😂 I love their gut laughs
2:28 the blonde girl was beautiful i wanna smash
ahh thurston isn't it jolly fun to talk about how separate we are from 99% of humans, them being in grocery stores and all, except for the ones who starve to death and don't go to grocery stores, haha jolly i say!
I saw a nice muslim
They should have just bought the store.
This is so funny lol
oprah shopping? she could just walk to the front and say excuse mr manager i'm buying you out today. thanks
i wish grocery shopping was that fun lol
Driving the Honda Accord, take notes...Honda is the best. Realistic dream car is 2017 Honda Civic 😭 or dream car, if I had all the money in the world I don’t think I would even buy what used to be my ultimate dream car Lamborghini like the Aventador or Huracan, it’s just not worth it, you can always rent it to experience it and to own it, well damn the insurance, maintenance costs, imagine getting into an accident 😱 forget it
One thing is for sure, both are pure dumb and none of them know how to pick good produce.
did oprah really ask for her money back?
Imagine if an ordinary person did this. Immediate kick from the store and a call to the police.
She kept her cool till she screamed in the car.
Hey guys my friend said i couldn't reach 30,000 subs without a video. Help me out to prove him wrong xD
Ellen is a mess 😂
i dont get why e'ones watching oprah w/ phones
And then they went home and licked each other raw !!
Let's live like peasants for a day.
This is ridiculous. People who can't act normal in a grocery store simply shouldn't be people.
The kid who ignored Oprah 2:49
Oprah your so sexy Ellen your so sexy to
They stole Danny Duncan's idea
This is so fun!!!!  Love these girls.
I love when she went with brittney spears to the mall and when she went with Michelle Obama to walgreens
Once I saw part 1.. I got so excited for part 2!!!
So this is Ellen’s version of ‘carpool karaoke’ I guess? Let’s hope Apple doesn’t buy this.
No one died in Las Vegas.
Oprah and Ellen together is _The Matrix_ . Swear on  *Y E E E Z Y* .
2 Aquarius's going grocery shopping lmao
Omg! I am weak!
Loved it!!!
<3
Love you both ❤️❤️❤️
This is disgusting
Two Legends, One Grocery Store
Cute video!!

Nothing like watching 2 Lesbians handle melons!  👍
Lol whoa sista

Clean-up on isle 3!!!
Love both u queens🤘🏼❤️🤘🏼
The LV duffel MASSIVE FLEX 💪🏿
I want to see their cooking lessons! Where is part 2?
Adsthese days I hate them one time there were no ads
Moral of the video. Don’t care what people think because we all go through the same inner battle we try to fight
I feel lonely and odd because I'm lonely and odd.
Well shit... looks like one of those solutions is hopeless for me... -_-
It's hard to make new friends when you have none because you forgot how.
Do you know why you're lonely? It's cuz you're fat and gay-Filthy Frank, 2014
Dear School of Life,\nPlease stop stalking your subscribers, you are always uploading videos exactly when we need it to the point where it gets a little eery.
Hi School of Life. Can you write an essay regarding gratification excesses found mostly on social media usage? And idenitfy newly adoptive practices of communication influenced by rapid tech advancements? Since you emphasize that well being is so important, I believe you ahould begin to study this behaviours.\nP.S Your videos always help me understand human weirdness. This is a positive thing, haha.
i’m so in love with this art
Jesus wants to love us for who we are.\nRomans 5:8 - But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.\nPsalm 34:5 - Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.
YES! I relate so much! Thanks SOL!!
I tend to not talk about some stuff like anime and video games (two things that are a big part of my life) with people I don't really know well just because there can be a negative connotation that comes with people who like that sort of thing. I've never been bullied or criticized for liking that stuff, in fact, all of my close friends are into at least one of those things. I'm just afraid of people thinking the wrong thing about me I guess.
Just told somebody how I'm still struggling with feeling lonely where I live and this video awaits me in my sub box. Impeccable timing once again.
That was some trumpy handshake right there...
So the person with a Macbook that's got Harry Potter stickers on it who's wearing a Normal People Scare Me shirt and whose hobbies are Netflix, food, and sleep is secretly quirky and different in the inside? I doubt it. People vary in terms of their tolerance/appreciation for strangeness.
You've got to love psychology. It opens a window to the things we can't understand about ourselves and it also let's us in on the minds of people around us. \n...Very enlightening.
*Is life repetitive?*\n\n\nIs life a pattern?\n\nPattern of lies no matter how you try to prove it’s not..?\n\nPatterns of *”types”* of people? Feelings? Thoughts? Expressions?\n\n\nAlways expected to be a “good” person? Someone *”special?” Or “unique?”*\n\nAlways expected to be “different” *simultaneously?*\n\n*Why?* \n\nsame thing, passed to another. And another... and another...\n\nDifferent people, different looks, same “usual” *life.*
Absolutely the best video you've made yet. This made so many thing click in my mind. Wow. Thank you.
Holy shit this just opened my mind
this video could've just been summed up with don't compare your behind the scenes with someone elses' highlight reel
Thanks School of Life, this video was timed well.
Tis is probably the best channel i found on YouTube. It truly speak loud and effectively .. thank you.
Could you do a vid on self-hatred? I experience it periodically. Like today.
I enjoy my loneliness a lot, but at times I feel I want to be honest and truthful to someone. Art helped me get through accepting and understanding myself. But I do not feel the cycle would be complete until I find the love or someone I can confide in. It's tough, art just feels like a temporary place holder that is slowly losing its long-lasting effect
This was awesome. This is what I'm feeling today and then I saw this video and felt drawn to it. Such an answer that I needed in this moment. Thank you God and universe for pointing me to this.
Holy shit people feel this way..?\n\nYeah no way this is representational. Ugh. Pop-science.
Thank you everyone working at The School of Life. These videos touch me just about every time, and this was felt even more personal. I've been watching your videos for so long but have never contributed. I've got to buy some of your books, to support the group and to hopefully grow a little bit more as a person. Any recommendation for the first book of yours I should get?
I think this video depicts a realistic answer to why we are lonely. But we keep looking for solutions on how to stop being lonely. Loneliness is a human thing, it's what makes us distressed but yet creative at the same time. I say the only answer to get rid of loneliness, is to indulge quite intensely into it, instead of pushing it away. It will always be there somewhere deep inside of us, nothing, nor a human being will ever subsitute our empty hole. I want to talk about how capitalism makes us even more lonely but that needs another entire thread for that.
Eh, I don't get lonely. Myself as company is the best company.
This was a major problem for me...thanks for pointing this out!
I'm feeling lonely because I had my period and I am not in good mood but if I was in good mood I will feel like I don't need anyone because lots of people are annoying
I like to pick my nose while I masturbate because my parents abused me
I’m always lonely even with people.....
This is me 100% I just need to experience love and a point of safety.
Why is this me
I kind of feel sorry for those out there that never got to experience growing up without cell phones, fb etc.. Life was way more connected then and sadly only a distant memory.. but like many on here are saying, look up, call someone, talk to a random person.. it just takes a little bit of effort and you will feel soo much better for it I promise!
My problem is that there are people that i truly love and that are important to me but i can't handle and i don't want their love because i think they don't see the full picture of who i am and so i feel like i shouldn't have their love because i'm not as good as they believe me to be? Is this normal or weird?😂 or does anybody feel the same?
Thank you for this
So... no one is really special and we are all almost equally insecure and sad... thats actually very reassuring
I really liked the animations x
Well now I feel like a faggot. Cause I really recognize myself in this
ok I am unsubing, do you even cover any other topic other than \n\nfeeling sad feeling bad feedling odd feeling left out feeling dead feeling depressed feeling like you have no sex feeling like you have too much sex
I really like how this video tries to explain these feelings which are omnipresent in modern society. The reference to art and love is very important, since (especially) art is often underestimated when it comes to psychological health. \n\nHowever, I think it's important to go deeper and ask why this psychological asymmetry is even there. It's not correct, I think, to portray it as a normal and legitimate aspect of the human psyche. We must include the influence of society, of how we live in society, and ask whether the way we live now is potentially detrimental to the psychological health of the individual. It's too a vast field to break it down here, but maybe some keywords: Alienation from our capability to have genuine experience, caused by the alienation marking us in the capitalist, marketing-oriented society; our failure to feel ourselves as the ones being in charge of our own lives because we a r e n o t; neuroses caused by undigested childhood trauma, preventing us from developing ourselves, loving ourselves, thus preventing us to love others and making contact with others; eventually the reduction of everything, be it people, relationships etc, to goods, products you can only achieve by trading our own positive (that is, popular) traits and hoping for the other person to see your value as well, thus forcing you to adhere to standards set by other people (by media, propaganda, advertisement, to be precise), not by your own, thus your failure to actualize yourself, to develop what you really are and thereby becoming happy because you experience yourself as a potent actor of your own possibilities. \n\nThe list is endless. If anyone read until this point I would recommend reading, for example, Erich Fromm, Abraham Maslow or Karen Horney, or just looking for humanistic psychology.
Why is being lonely bad? I like being by myself
Because I have asperger's. I already came to terms with this.
Love just adds to the pain.
The way he speaks makes me cringe so much
This makes me feel better
I've never felt lonely or bored, I guess I'm comfortable in my own skin. Just rub one out and read a book.
how about you feel misfit because of awareness level and empathy and knowledge and experience and open mindedness. so not odd and shy but odd and frustrated?
Because Jesus isn't in their heart without him you'll feel empty. Triggered comments put below👇👇👊
Am I the only one here that actually prefers to be alone for an extended period of time?
you think youre cool i just watched this on mute so i could look at the pictures top that smh
The way he says sex makes me want to have sex
We might be in different struggles but for anyone going through this I know for damn sure you dont hate people and just want to do good and do good for others dont make life's mistakes fool you because those mistakes speak louder in your head than any other insult people would say . For anyone going through any kind of self destructive depression I have a clear goal for you be selfless , the more you do to help others, the more you set aside your trials and failures, the more you have room for memories and moments you will enjoy life
This video made me feel so relaxed for some reason
marina diamandis brought me here and god do i thank her
It maybe debilitating, painful to feel that void in your heart. Those loneliness, darkness, anger, hunger, unlucky feelings...I have been there. I have survived them. You would too. Believe me. The good thing about pain is that once you are accustomed to it, you would slowly start getting numb. This numbness makes you resistant to further pain. \n\n\nWe are not alone anymore, since we share the same pain.
I used to be lonely and depressed, but after I started following Jesus, my life has literally changed for the better. My struggles with OCD and my depression is gone. Thank You, Jesus!\n\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends. \n\nJesus loves you! He died so that you may live! \n\nPlease do not listen to the lies of the enemy. Jesus is NOT angry at you! In fact, He is waiting for you to call upon Him in Truth. \n\nRepent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ! He WILL deliver you. He will forgive you. He will make you new! Hallelujah!\n\nJudgement is swiftly approaching as well. Jesus is the only Way to escape it. So please return to Jesus now! \n\nIf you don't know Jesus and have not called upon Him already, I pray you make this moment to do so. Tomorrow is not promised to us, neither is the very next hour. To die without Jesus is a very dangerous thing. So make the wisest choice you will ever make by calling out to The Lord sincerely! \n\nShalom, friends.
This is very spot on and true that it is scary... I feel lonely and odd b.c I haven't found the right person that is relatable... everyone are either into the things that I'm not into, or are just... idk... flaky? I need someone who can fill me, someone who can complete me, I feel like I'm missing another half of a whole... Alas no such person exists, it's too good to be true...
Are you feeling lonely and odd? I can fix that. All you have to do is talk to me you will gain a friend and instantly start to feel less odd when you know me more.
That part about art is so real to me. I’m currently watching the same movie over and over again for this exact reason
we feel lonely & odd because we are, just embrace it, assuming everyone else is similar, if you've ever wondered what other people thought of you, you'd be surprised by how often they didn't

I feel lonely because I can't fill the void my parents have caused with not enough affection.
*Hello Darkness My Old Friend*
No one likes me, especially in school. When I was doing math today,  we were told to check our work with others. I had no choice but to look around. Everyone had a partner but me, then I sat at my desk. I watched people that looked like they were heading towards me, but dodge me. Heading to the person behind me. at that point, I was in a disappointed state. I looked over my work, pretending to fix a big mistake I had made on my paper. But i had really made the big mistake of even thinking, someone cares about me.\n\nExcept for one girl, she has been talking to me since last year, filling me in on what I've missed on days I was absent. And talking to me about her day. I really appreciate what she is doing. I hope she won't stop, but my shyness may draw her away from me.. It really seeps through.\n\nWhat makes me sad, is that she has been the only one nice enough to talk to me, in 5 years. \n\nThat, is what I call, a miracle. \n\n\n\n😭
I guess I'm not as special as I thought. Might as well end it. 😔
Jesus knows you completely and loves you unconditionally. Have a moment with Him and ask Him to live in your heart.
Pretend like it's Lucifer talking.
I salute our brave men in blue.
Cops told niggas to stay within the festival fences. Hm
Are semi-auto guns cheap? is that why so many people have them?
Um, why an hour later after the security guard notified police?
There goes all the fake ass Russian bots arguments that he targeted country music because he was leftwing.
Good on those cops love it
Go to: Movie BREACH - THAN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jesus is the second shooter !!!!  He shot himself to look like a victim ! And his buddy ran away
Is it necessary for George Stephanopoulos  to teach me how to subscribe on YouTube at the end of every single video?
shooter? i would call him a terrorist, oh wait, he's a white caucasian.
Thankful for all of the brave men and women who risked their lives and saved many. <3
An hour before they got to him!! Are you fucking kidding me!!!
this guy sure did his research.
Did he just say the correspondent's name is Matt Gunman?
False Flag does not mean nobody was hurt. False Flag means that the official narrative has nothing to do with the truth.
Inside Edition said he never checked into any. This all is insanely sad.
This is proof that Hillary was involved in the LV shootings, look at how poor of a turn out for her book sales.
Sense when did they start filming these tragedy's?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you? He had no criminal background but look he carried out a massacre!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLkruVqQLEM \nyou have to be REALLY, but REALLY stupid and retarded to think that there is only 1 weapon shooting at a time. 5:00
Now whitey knows how it feels to be shoot at for no apparent reason, like innocent Native Americans , Blacks and Mexicans have endured for many many moons!
Where is the hotel security camera footage?
HOW MANY TIMES IS THE AVERAGE DUMBED DOWN IDIOT AMERICAN GONNA FALL FOR THE SAME BULLSHIT TRICK. IF YOU BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL STORY YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WALK THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
100 round clips? those are 30 round clips. Only way for 100 rounds is in a drum.
Or they had multiple hotels in his name because they were shooting out of all of them! Quit lying MEDIA!!!!!!
Chicago Illinois was next Google it,
2:02 Just in case we suck at math... and common sense...
I hope he rots in hell for all eternity.
People tend to a build a wall when they have their own issues.
2:30\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING IN ROOM 135\n\nhttps://www.cuteonly.ru/223394
alright so basically \nStephen Paddock wanted to kill himself, but since he was messed up he wantedto kill as amny people as posible with him\na clever plan. but not so clever if he kills himself
When a cracker does something wrong, he was pushed to do it....if you're non white, no matter how innocent you are, you're in the wrong....
I wonder what those “fuck the Police“ people think about that when they need some one to save ther ass the police are ther when they don't need them they just talk 💩.
It's only a false flag when a white person does it but if you're not white you're a terrorist
That jackass modified his AR to fire as if it was a machine gun...
Mr. Paddock just wanted some shut eye.
FUCKING PIGGGG ASSSS COPS!

Nigga was wall hacking too gawhdamn he doing it right
Wow ! Silly me!! I just got it !! It's like a dick extension having a gun and having a bigger gun is a bigger dildo!! It's only just occurred to me that this old dude probably can't get it up any more!! I mean look at all the younger spree shooters who did it because they couldn't get laid, well we know this dude had money and a girlfriend but he probably lost it cos he's now a limp dick!!\nYou see that is what you need to do now America, tell the truth about why a man would need a big gun , let alone 40 of them!! You need to let young kids know how deeply uncool it is to need a gun. What man needs a gun ? Over here in Blighty we would consider that being a pansy as tis old school to have a bloody fist fight and guess what? Nobody dies.
The sad thing is that these hotels have little to no security he could have done the same at any hotel bring all those weapons in ... also what did he have against country music instead of rappers? Hmmm....
There had to been two shooters. He couldn't have done it alone.
an hour later? Thought it was 10 minutes
Thank the lord he didn't shoot up the rap show....

Also google LIVEWIRE VEGAS. 1ST RESULT SHOWS A GRAPHIC VIDEO.
This are all fucken lies the media is reporting. Tell us the truth . Just let's us know the truth . He had help and let us know who help him .? Everything is fishy
Guns were placed previously in the room...the guy just walked in and got the keys at reception...inside job.
false flag perpetuated by the demonrat libtards to take away muh guns!
The conspiracy theorists are not the only ones u gotta watch out for now lol anyone can go nuts
Look for the photo released/leaked that show the dead lone wolf on the floor. \nThen take special note that there is a rifle on a bipod OVER his left leg. \nThey reported that he was killed on breech, then they said it was suicide, now they are back to killed on breech. \n\nLooking at his body position with the rifle over his left leg...... hmmmmmm>\n\nI hope you can find it, but the pic of his face shows he spit up a lot of blood, but you can see he was shot in the lower chest to stomach from the front. \n\nWith the rifles position and his final resting spot, that means he was shot by someone else standing in the room at the broken window. \nSWAT didn't enter the window and they did not have a sniper shooting into the room. \n\nFor all those who say the 4th floor muzzle flashes were the reflection of a strobe light, tell me how a moving cab wouldn't have fallen out of the reflective line of sight of that distant strobe reflection. \nNot to mention other camera angles showing the same muzzle flash. \n\nJust watch all the first shooting videos.....where the guy was still singing on stage. \nYou can hear shots and echo, but then you will hear overlapping fire. \n\nHead back to the pics in the room and look at the shot with his legs in the photo....top left of that photo is the window he was shooting from. \nThere aren't nearly enough empty casings on the ground for this to make since
He should've uploaded the videos to YouTube before he killed himself.
Who else flinched when they demonstrated the ak
WOW  Lone gunmen don't need several spots to shoot from,  Teams do.  Real deaths, real injuries, bad reporting.
What will be next step for USA government.
If we don't want this to happen anymore we shouldn't be creating more gun laws. We should just have metal detectors added to buildings. Going in and out. That way they can keep track of the firearms better. Concealed carry is ok. But you can't have someone stockpiling weapons in any building. If you bring a weapon in you can't bring another one in until your other one is out. Its called being smart and caring about what goes on.
Chicago people still being killed by gun men. No outrage there, the hypocrisy is real!
a sad moment in history
George Stephanopoulos is a little bitch, I remember he called this monster Mr Paddox fk him. Call him the killer or evil man, not mr you stupid ass news anchor. What a douche say what it is politically correct ass hole.
IT'S GOVERNMENT SETUP AND HE GOT FRAME FOR IT BLAHHH
what is that odd piece of furniture around 00:25 with giraffe print? strange, appears to have sections and cracked on the outside. anyone have an idea?
what i god way to end your life and be famos he had a hell of blast of fun shoting all that rounds
Cnn and the MsM are The real terrorists all the yellow journalism and all the worst things under the sun ! Americans are waking up to you traitors
More Deflecting LIES from the truth YUP NO ONE IS BELIEVING The MSM or LEO !
Inside job. Doesn’t make any sense
Quit looking for motives. Some people are just pure evil and want to kill.
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO DESTROY THE WHITE CHRISTIAN RACE IN AMERICA WITH ENDLESS MULTICULTURAL IMMIGRATION SO THEIR GIANT GLOBAL CORPORATE DONORS CAN EXPLOIT DESPERATE CHEAP IMMIGRANT LABOR TO MAKE EVEN MORE FUKING MONEY!
Everyone looking for this murderer's reason and agenda but maybe he just hated people. It's sad but there's a lot of that going around nowadays.
How can one man kill and injured so many people with LMG that high up in a Hotel . I'm calling Bullshit
Stephen Paddock was INSANE !  He Killed with a GUN !  a cold, hard, heavy GUN !!  it did not feel thoughts, love, hate, a BROKEN HEART........    GUNS KILL !!   TALK NOW !

..Gathering people who wants to be a part of building a network of stable, fully self sustaining and self sufficient communities (a.k.a. life-boats for the coming social & environmental collapse).  Peaceful communities that are built upon foundation of : love, spirituality, mercy, generosity, tolerance, intelligent, and wisdom. If you are interested in becoming a part of this grass root efforts, I encourage your reply.\n\nThis Community ARK Project is looking for peaceful, patience, humble, and kind-hearted people who are awaken and aware of the coming social & environmental collapse; who want to roll up their sleeves and participate in preparatory efforts. One cannot pull someone out of a raging river standing on a muddy slippery slope. In order to pull someone out of the river, one must stand on a firm solid foundation. A fully self-sufficient community is that solid foundation, upon which we stand in order to rescue other less fortunate who will be affected by the collapsing environment.  If people are struggling to survive as the environment collapses, how can they help others?  People need fully self-sufficient communities to shelter and nourish them, in order for them to reach out and help others.\n\nWe are gathering people from all spectrum of professional background: engineers, scientists, architects, biologists, farmers, doctors, nurses, artists, etc. Both skilled and unskilled people. Those with knowledge will teach those who lack them. Those not in the know will listen and learn so they might in turn teach others in the community. We have spent 6 years researching technology that were designed to allow Mars colonies to thrive in a desolate environment. We are now planning on using those very same technology to prepare people for the coming environmental collapse. If you are interested in helping out, we could use the help to reach the ears of people who are awaken via social media, or you can read our blog titled Generalized Plan of Action for a list of positions you can volunteer for.\n\nWe are speaking to those of like mind who do not need convincing; in their hearts and in their thoughts, they recognize the catastrophe that lay ahead if our modern societies continue on their current path of promoting competition, strife, ignorance and scarcity. This Community ARK Project is lighting a beacon so that those with similar mind set will know that they are not alone in their thoughts and impulse; that there are others like them out there who desire to come together to pool our effort in order to extract ourselves and place ourselves on a different path.  One that promote cooperation, harmony, foresight, and a nurturing environment.
Notice the WHITE media keeps showing MANY pictures of the non-white Filipina who didn't even commit the crime, but the WHITE man who's the perpetuator has only 1-2 pictures, yes, mostly ONE picture of him with EYES CLOSED.\nNo doubt they are trying to WEAKEN the image of the WHITE barbaric man in the head of viewers. \nDirty white bastards strike again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Could've done more damage if he had more time I guess. Probably didn't have good access to the concert to place any to use with the precision rifles he brought up.
The ignorance of the media regarding gun terminology is ridiculous. Sensationalized, uninformed garbage.
If it was not for that security guard (JESUS CAMPOS) the casualties would have been greater. The terrorist had to change his focus on the door and not the crowd. I truly believe the terrorist killed himself shortly after he shot at the security guard, believing the end was near. JESUS CAMPOS is a hero and should be recognized and rewarded for his efforts. He is a savior and truly earned his named that day.\n\nhttp://ussanews.com/News1/2017/10/05/hero-jesus-campos-mandalay-bay-unarmed-security-guard-who-got-shot-after-locating-stephen-paddock-before-cops-arrived/
Why the hell do they use a picture that someone likely toke when he was off guard, every time they show him on the media?

Exactly why do we need guns? Tell me something other than, it's my right as an American.
How is someone who put this much planning and effort into killing hundreds of people not considered a terrorist...
The AR15 should be banned
There is no way that a 64yr old senior citizen with no military experience could plan and finance that attack alone

I’m alright with bugs like since my birth
Just get rid of cockroaches and mosquitoes
What about the honey come on now I’m like Winnie the Pooh I need my honey
Well I don't mind if lizards eat all the roaches but I shouldn't see any in my apartment then 😞
Just get to the point and tell us why we need to endure mosquitoes you disingenuous hack.
I pull the legs off spiders
What if robots ruled the world?
The only thing that scared me was that spookie scary skeleton at 2:45. Geeze man!
Spreading diseases is also a good thing in a way, let's say all the people who die from malaria don't die, imagine how over populated it will be
Mosquitoes should go extinct. They carry diseases and are completely useless.
But plants can adapt so that they don't need insects to help them pollinate
but we can still get rid of spiders right, like everything else it's just annoying but spiders are the work of the devil I say
Bruh let's kill the little shits that are a waste of air
I'd be happy if all the mosquitos died. No more assholes buzzing around carrying viruses.
That's a Redstone torch not a flower!
Insects... are not equal to bugs... They have 6 legs ONLY...
This video is really bugging me\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet it
I only like to bee.
How ‘bout we only keep bees
It do gotta *bee* like that sometimes *moth* erfucker. And yes everything will die
Lets just kill all mosquitoes... \n\n\n\n\n\nThen I'll be happy
My sister had Malaria luckily she didn’t die
most insects are like zombies
Are you a Minecraft ? cuz you are a  Box
Literally just kill all mosquitos, flees, lice, locust, and etc. They are much less important and a complete total nuisance, unlike honeybees
What would happen if all the carbon dioxide in the air suddenly dissapeared?
After all this, Mosquitoes are still useless
I believe we should kill alla useless bugs and keep the useful incects like bees
Comment below which species of bugs you would rather be killed 💀
KILL ALL OF THOSE BUGS!
Mosquitoes don't do any good scientists should kill all of them
What would happen if everybody had superpowers
1:17 Blocko said W E E D S ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I think I'm the only one that doesn't like to kill bugs. Like when I see a bug I just get some paper or cardboard, scoop it up, and put it outside. ALL LIVES MATTER
We all play a little part in this world  :)
If I had to have one bug on this earth it would probably be ladybugs or ants.
I wish all bugs died I hate bugs
Actually fun fact! Mosquitos are actually really useless! Every insect has its part in earth, but mosquitoes actually have no point in this earth rather just to kill a bunch of people and take their blood, so it will be better to get rid of all mosquitoes cause they're useless and they are a nuisance  \n\nAlso, bees are getting instinct, that's not a fun fact that not many people know about, but I think I'll still adress it. Bees are a really important part of life and I haven't seen a bee since I was in 6th grade and I'm in 8th grade now, bees are going extinct which is kinda scary
what about fruit fly's? are they useful in anyway?
The only bees i like are boobees
Is dogs saliva good for us
Killing all bugs still sounds like it's worth it to me. In fact why don't we kill anything that's not useful.
I don't need bread...\n\n\n\nThat's the yeast of my concerns
How about getting rid of all the annoying creepy disgusting bugs only
Ok i mess with bugs now except for cockroaches
I still think wasps and hornets shouldn’t exist
Insects are cool. I actually love them 💜
Just get rid of mosquitos!

I still vote to kill off all the annoying ones like mosquitos and nats.
Can you make a video about what science
So how about just the assholes? Like mosquitos, fleas, cockroaches, a fucking bed bugs. The last one taking weeks to get rid of.
You all want insects to go extinct because they cause you such little annoyance, yet humans cause the most damage in the world, should we go extinct?
All insects should die except for bee's and butterfly's
if all the bugs were dead ubisoft will be the best gaming company in the world
Well for starters i would be able to sleep happily

Are you using all products during pregnancy? Or have you changed anything in your routine?
The ester lauder box is already sold out. Boo!
Smashbox has sold out of the charity boxes on your link but Bobby Brown still has some in stock :-)
Love your top ooh new products
Your hair in this video is amazing!!!!
that brown sparkly shade in the tarte palette STRESSES ME OUT hahahah IMAGINE THE FALL OUT
The toasted looks amazing and supporting a good cause, I always love
I never realised you still made YT videos! I’ve missed them; I used to watch you way back in the day! Hey girl!
Hi Fleur, what did you think of the new Chanel perfume- Gabrielle? X
Love these types of videos! Do you have any recommendations for liquid eye liner? I’m on the hunt for something new because my favourite one has been discontinued. Also, waterproof would be an amazing plus ❤️
So happy to see your video Fleur! I am in love with the Tartlette palette and the Erborian mask I'll definitely look into. (Before this vid, here I was trying to whittle down my makeup stash for some while 😂)
Love it all and you are lovely! xoxo
I love what you're wearing Fleur! Where is it from and can you get it non maternity? It's so cute 😊 Love your videos and hope you're enjoying your pregnancy. Can't wait for #babydeforce
You look so beautiful you are glowing 🤗😍
Love that box for breast cancer! Great idea. Another great video, Fleur :)
Love these videos Fleur, really respect your opinion and appreciate work you put in to research and try all these products out x
Fleur whats wrong with your undereye concealer, it doesnt look as good as always. Have you used another one ?
some nice looking products there
I’m looking for liquid lipstick version of mac velvet teddy that’s going to last all day. Any help??? X
I love the smelling sound not in a creepy way but its not gross....
Would love a drugstore haul for autumn /winter
Hi fleur love watching to see what's new in.your hair looks amazing.xx😀
Thank you for this informative video, Fleur!
Can you do a look with the new tarte palette?
Love these 'new i beauty' videos☺️
Awesome idea for the breast cancer box 💕and looking forward to trying the new Ordinary serums!
Lovely choices as always, Fleur. :) Hope you're feeling well ; before you know it your Favorite Beautiful Lead Item of All Time will be ... *Baby DeForce.* :D
Love these videos thanks Fleur. Unfortunately your amazon link to the Paris book is not working, thought I'd let you know.
I am so sad the toasted palette isn’t out yet 😩 it looks amazing
I'm not loving that UD mascara either.  The Perversion mascara is one of my favorite from them, though!
The tarte palette is so beautiful😭
I am definitely going to pick up the Tarte  palette. Curious about the Eborian mask since I enjoy their BB cream. The bubble mask looks fun! What would you compare the Clinique  overnight lip balm to? Oh my gosh! Nooo replica! I adore their fragrances & I don't need to because they are pricy but that one sounds good. Beach Walk is my all time favorite scent. It's pretty much been my signature scent for the past couple of years. Hope you're having a lovely week. Hugs, Summer xo
Urghhh the breast cancer box is sold out. My mum just finished treatment a few months ago and would have loved it! Hoping they'll restock
I'm so excited and ready for the tarteltte toasted pallete 😍😍😍
i have to look for that beauty box for breast cancer, that's nice! i will look for and try the clinique double bubble mask is available in the US for $24.50
My favourite and what I look forward to most are your Vlogtober and Vlogmas vlogs. I, of course, totally understand why you are not doing them but I am still a little heartbroken. Hopefully next year.
Just ordered the breast cancer box last night. Looks amazing 😍
Wow, I always learn something from watching your videos.  This was jammed with lots of info & products!  Thanks so much, I think it’s Ouai & Bubble mask time!  💖
OOOOh I love the breast cancer box! Sadly it's not available in the States and they do not ship internationally from the UK site
It's a shame that the Estee Lauder box sold out in minutes! Would have liked one....
I love your New in Beauty`' videos. You always have the brands/stuff that others never show.
The tarte palette looks so good but idk where to buy it from in the uk
Does Tarte ship to the UK ? Or how else can we get this palette?
oh my lord that tarte palette just got added to my NYC sephora list for next month!!!
I'm supposed to be taking a nap before going to work ....... but first FLEUR!!!
Love your hair Fleur. The new growth looks so heathy and shiny. Natural color looks so flattering.
Your explanation of hair memory :) haha.
did anybody misunderstand fleur saying sweat proof as 'sex proof'??
Gutted that the breast cancer beauty box is sold out. Is it a one off or do they come back in stock?
no shops in the UK stocks tarte make up !!!;( if anyone things i'm wrong and know the place pleat let me know!!!!) there is one place like a pharmacy and let's say for tarte eyeshadow palette charges like 149 pounds!!!????🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
Wear us your top from?!
It seems a bit odd that Replica are releasing a summer/sea scent in October...  I love the Lipstick one and By the Fireplace for winter :)
Hi Fleur! Question! Where/How do you get Tarte in the UK?! Thanks for answering love! ❤
Your hair look gorgeous in this video xx
Loved this new-in-beauty video as always!  You always give great reviews/first impressions
It is a shame you didn;t like the mascara - We tend to have the same taste in them and the packgaing looks so beautiful I wanted to really like it aha. Excited for the Tarte Palette. It is nice when brands do things to help raise awareness for current issues.
This concealer really ages you!
Untagging won't help, Kim. lmao
how are you  being private if your on national television
It's because she has paps photoshop her pics when they are taken lol and these weren't photoshopped. Such a first world problem, get over it.
Everyone post an ugly pic of themselves online and see if you act happy
Kim grow TF up u have kids now Jesus
I wanted kourtney to day “Kim there’s people that are dying”
Like all they do is complain about paparazzi but if there wasn't paparazzi they wouldn't have careers. The Kardashians may have been through a lot but my God, they are extremely shallow people
She got mad because she didn't pay her deal with the paps to Photoshop her pics.
😂🤣🤣🤣 this proves that shes sooo fake
yes u do look like that! u just show the world ur photoshop photos....
I still remember when the show first started everyone was real and natural but now it's feels more I don't know plasticy... They really looked better back then...
So narcissistic
But the body shame Rob all the time...
Quit calling the paps then
OMG Kim looks so bad in this side commentary.. What happened to her beautiful face it's such a shame
You do look like that though
I kinda feel like kim doesn’t want to accept the way she looked
When the hell was she perfect...i just dont get it their whole life is a show they make sure everyone know when they are making a baby..so why is she upset..guess her plastic got old.
Oh get over yourself Kim, people are dying in this world
If it was a good pic that doesn't look like her she wouldn't even complain about it. This family is so narcissistic
Kim there's people that are dying~Kourtney Kardashian
Kim, there's people that are dying.
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING
AND she actually posted that photo shes talking about with the caption just chilling on the beach with my natural curves or something and then she deleted it lmfao #sofake
she really thought it was beautiful ???
Kim there's people that are dying
sooooo let me get this right.. there are 2 pictures that supposedly just taking when you walked on the beach but they aren't even in the same outfits.. wtf  Why people keep watching this trailer trash family is beyond me.
What a complete naraccist. Jesus! She is soo full of herself, that whole entire family is so full of themselves.
@the title... Such a shallow person... Don't know the meaning of life if this is what she worries about
To quote Kourtney; \n\nPeople are dying, Kim. 🙄
I don’t get their show is it basically a vlog and every so often they explain what’s happening in a studio, they should try start a YouTube channel for that I think it would be more popular
Your entire family has been your lives on your looks
I feel bad like people are saying she’s overreacting but like come on she’s not confident if her body looks good. It’s upsetting I know that exact feeling too.
Why are these people famous again?
That big cellulite booty don’t match with her stick legs. It doesn’t look like she workout.
Kim você tem que entender que você não é perfeita então aceita por você ter uma bunda tão grande e pelo dinheiro que você tem não era pra ter tanta celulite mais é aquela coisa né ela é um ser humano e não um robô aceita filha!!!
There are people that are dying kim
don't be so worried Kim, you're pretty
I mean but if the picctured depicts\nSomething false as she says then just leave it alone I mean girl if you feel like you are gorgeous and have a beautiful  body who cares 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
It's funny to me that Ashley Graham has cellulite and everyone says she's brave for showing herself as a real woman but when you see a Kardashian with an imperfection they are bashed and criticized like an unacceptable dog at Westminster Abbey. Like, can they live? I'd hate to hear people saying that kind of stuff about me and it's refreshing to see beautiful women be REAL. Everyone is against airbrushing and photoshop but wouldn't you want to be edited if people were ripping your body apart the way that they did Kim for having any form of cellulite. PS - cellulite is genetic, it's not always because you're fat.
How self centered can you be .there are people with real problems in the world and this is what she's worried about smh.
I would hate an be upset as well I'd I was in her situation
Meanwhile in Vegas
Kim people are dying!
*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira*
Wow!!!,just wow!!!!
Die
What a liar...she took pics during that trip and that picture was real. Hahahaha
How is it private if you recording it
OMG.....first Puerto Rico now this.....prayers and thoughts to the Kardashian Family
Wow I wish a picture was my only worry lol
I want those 3 chicks in my bed💦💦👅
It would be great if she killed herself id laugh alot
she is very angry a non paid (for photoshop and personal approval) professional paparazzi took and leaked real untouched pictures of her deformed over injected derriere ! she was stunning ans took it all too far and for sure that's the reason why she won't get pregnant to not gain more weight and make things worse since her surgeons are not able to reshape and fix her deformed derriere
Kim and your family. All of you wanted a famous life and till now you know how it works. So stop complaining. 
the way kourtney looks at kim 😂
shes human you cant look good all the time
she's not freaking out about he pic. ever since the paris robbery she is scared because now people took pics of her know where she went and people found her because she wants to hide. she doesnt want the same thing happening.
Their problems are not problems.
She’s so vain and superficial
I’d rather be with a black woman.  Keep your Kardashian
lol but Kim honey, that's what your butt actually looks like.... accept it. You fucked up
You film a reality show as your job......
But Kim wait a minute you have the perfect body remember so what are you getting your panties in a twist for....Well at least you act like you do but wake up call you don't.... 😄😆
Is she claiming that the paps photoshopped her pics for worse ?
What a bunch of wankers
Did they get pics of Kim in her true form?🐍🐍🐍
Everyone knows the Kardashian's hire their own paparazzi right? Every now and then a real picture surfaces.
Like this Katie at InStyle-Decor Luxury Lifestyle http://instyle-decor.com Hollywood
Let me get this straight, they call & pay paps to take pics to keep them relevant. Then they go on vacation with cameras & expect no attention? The cuz your body is exposed for what it really looks like without photoshop you get mad?! Stop it. You may not have told them where you're staying, but Kris probably did
If it's a picture of YOU than YES I'm sorry but that IS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE! \nWelcome to the Real World Kimmy! \nWhere Everyone is NOT Perfect! \nAnd YES Other People DO Body Shame You! \nI am Truly Sorry that it took you this long to find this out.  \nMost of US were in Preschool while you are in your 30's Married with 2 Children! \nAnxiety over pictures of yourself because your not as perfect as you thought you were?!! \nIt's truly amazing how Shallow  One can act be.
Ficou assustada, ela pensava que era bonito, mas agora que viu a realidade, sabe que é horrível. Se eu fosse ela já tirava isso.
A singer that who can't sing even if it's just for one night for exemple Mariah is insulted. An actress who does a bad performance too. I'm wondering why Kim thinks that she can avoid it. You made your appearance a business this is all your fault.
Wait so you don't care about social media but ur rushing to untag yourself?? Lol
Anyone have the picture?
“How you gon be mad on vacation “
I’m sorry, I understand her security fears but the ‘scrutiny’???... I wouldn’t say Kardashian‘s try to avoid that. She takes so many selfie’s that she approves first and then puts them online/that’s the only difference. We all have bad photos, in real time.
Kim there people dieng 😂
Kim its always late
then STOP calling them
Crazy 1:03 😂
Mentality?
Emptiness is frustrating girl!
Toda ruim.
What do they expect..
Cellulite is normal lol
1st world problems.
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Pathetic
Should deflate that arse a lil'
Kim's body really doesn't look like those horrible pictures the paps put out though so I understand her frustration because after that people started attacking and making fun of her
Super-could'n't-give-a-shit ....
🐍 🐍 🐍
Omg drama
Me me myself ...
Kim people are dying
I'm so unphotogenic if I was famous I'd be so ugly in all the pics
Hey idiots. If this girls bother you then don’t click on a video with their name! 🖕
i cant stand leache in the red. shes such a leache and a suck up, i cannot stand that girl. shes like THEY GOT US. bish u mean Kim because the only reason youre in the pic is because of Kim!
why does steph have a cigerette in her hands? the kardashians dont even smoke!!

2017 (Year of Wonder):\nWonder Woman\nProfessor Marston and the Wonder Woman\nWonder Wheel\nWonder
This looks like it could be a lot of fun
well great now I've got wonderwall stuck in my head
Any way, here's Wonder Wheel
I would only see it if Woody Allen was crucified on the Wonder Wheel.
Visually nice but doesn’t seem all that great of a story to me.
Woody Allen and Kate Winslet take Oscar together
What is this? This is not Oasis? Alert me when you have decided to make it. Thanks
JT rules here\ncannot wait for his collab with Alison Sudol (both are great when it comes to singing and acting)

“Miss, you can’t be out here. We’re expecting lighting storms.” \n\n*proceeds to place a fucking makeshift lightning rod over her head*\n\n00:30
This has a soap-opera feel to it.  Hopefully that's just the trailer.

Reminds me of the classic film The Warriors
I honestly thought this was a wonder woman sequal Wonder Wheel by Amazon Studios...
1:19 is the best part!
yup. can't fucking wait for this 💟
And the OSCAR goes to ...
DiD hE KIss YoU?
Is this a Wes Anderson movie
I watched it without sound, because I'm at work. Can anyone tell me what the plot is, haha.
Awesome! The long awaited sequel to the Toy. Can't wait!!!
This feels like an SNL skit.  Not sure if that’s promising or damning.
This looks like a bad one.
Hey there my friend, I am Skylar Fuhrmeister and I make lifestyle, beauty, fashion and more here on Youtube and would love if you would watch my recent video all about halloween https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkAQcAE0060 maybe more!
I dont trust any Woody Allen movie unless there is underage incest.  I feel he is too much out of his wheelhouse.
Woody Allen and Bill Cosby are two men cut from the same cloth. Despicable creatures who should not be allowed to work
No Justin Noooo why'd you work with this creep? 🤦🏼‍♀️

So a 1950's Sopranos. Dope, I'm in!
Watch Justin and Kate singing together!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcXXr7LWZKg
Yes Kate, but replace Justin with Leo.
1:19 is that a wand ?
You still got it woody Allen as sad Amazon studios is making more original stuff than Hollywood studios out there.
I love that Woody Allen has such a unique style of film making...
I thought this was about the wheel Richard Pryor had in the toy
My mind went straight to the movie the warriors
Wonder Woman, Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, Wonder, Wonder Struck and now Wonder Wheel. So many films this year with the word wonder in the title, not to mention that this one and Wonder Struck are both made by Amazon Studios.
This has nothing to do with obscure Hanna Barbera cartoons. 0/10
Whats that song in beginning
What the hell is that logo? Was it made in word art?
Who would have known Americans wore speedos in the 1950s? You should all go back to wearing them again, it's much sexier than the board shorts you wear now.
More like Wonder Wall am I right?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?
He's due for a good movie. This isn't it. Scoop 2: A Strange Undertaking. Now we're cookin' with gas.
this went trending with 2000 views, but idubbbz got 10000000 in a day and didnt even make it in the top 50
I adore Miss Winslet’s work. Her performances always makes me so happy.   A truly gifted actress.
Wow I feel like I could direct a movie.............

Why are you like this?
My gosh. I can only dab for a short 12 seconds.
Hey Jack, what are your thoughts on Jaiden Smith's new anime?
What brought me to this side of YouTube...?
Even your dog is ashamed of you
I looked away he almost died, what a hero.
This is literally impossible
I enjoy the fact that the channel keeps trending towards shitposts
Just why did I click on this
Omg I have that same rug 😂
I actually tried it and it IS hard
don't you just love it when the ad that plays before the video, IS LONGER THAT THE ACTUAL VIDEO? jk love it very funny jack
HE DID IT AHHHHHHHHHH OMG HE IS BRAVE ATTACK CHEESE.
I see it takes 50 seconds for your boyfriend to get ready...
I didn't see any dabbing going on in this video. 420 bitches get wit it
57 seconds; it was 57 seconds that I wasted. I could find the cure to all problems. nope. here I am. watching the longest and slowest dab. see, even Erin agrees that's wasteful. for shame.
A ham, a ham, a ham for the prince
the 'quality' of your shitposts never ceases to amaze
“He’s not fast enough” BOI
My boi Jack getting #4 in trending with a video less than a minute long about dabbing!
You say you're dabbing, but I didn't see you inhale OR exhale
K chink . 50 second video. Make more than 10000 kids in africa. Kids in africa could have eaten less epic dabs. Distribute dabs evenly !
You're the only channel with videos I ever see Trending
Hey Jack! Great video but what the fuck?
my family and I are going as your forehead for Halloween.               (... I have a family of 6...)
Bounced on my boy's dick to this for hours, that dab was so slow I had to take a nap to get to the ending. I woke up and was completely rejuvenated only to look up and see Jack half way into his elbow with his knees buckling out like a lil bitch, but he fuckin did it. So good job Jack on a dab well done. 9/11 was an inside job.
This is the quality content I subbed for folks
the first jacksfilms video I've ever been morally compelled to dislike
Who else rewatched the video just to stare at his dog?
He's not fast enough to do a slow dab...
kind of sad to hear your fiancée thinks you're not cool enough
He must have been getting a lot of hate
Steroids in this sport are way out of control he should be tested I’m with Erik fuck this guy

I love you💜💜💛💛💚💚💙💙💟💟❤❤💖💖💗💗😃📷💎💒💐
I thought I unsubscibed from your channel 4 years ago....wtf??
Did converting the Hero 6 codex make it come out darker then the Hero 5? Because the Hero 5 come out brighter then the Hero 6 but the I Phone seemed better then both Hero's. But is the Hero camera's more for action video?
i like iPhone 8 and the hero 5 better..
Hero 5 is better then hero 6 and iphone 8 better then hero 5. Hero 6 footage looks like dark
Not at the iPhone looking WORLDS better...
I think I like the hero 5 better
Why does the Hero 5 camera seem to look better?🤔🤦‍♂️😂
My god Justiiineee! I love it when you look straight into the camera, it's like you look directly into my eyes. It makes me blush a bit though :P Great video!
cool video, i love making videos with my drone, also do GoPro vids, going to be uploading my next hand slap video in around a week :) thanks for sharing 👍🤓
I love this place!!
Hello ijustine great editing what do you use and what's good for a beginner to edit videos.
Eh, I'd smash.
Plz
Sorry Justine wasnt me
Vietnam Sale 11,9000,000 vnđ, thanks review!!!
Thinking about Big hero 6 lol
The iPhone looked better IMHO
iPhone 8 is better
iPhone 8 is better 😎
I prefer the iPhone 8 plus
Ciao ev best
React to the Google pixel 2
Worst video ever
Oooohh
yay trending!
The slowmo in the gopro is shit
A big hero 6?
Are you justin bieber?
seems like they made it worse. The 5 seems better
Honestly NOT impressed by hero 6. I much prefer the iPhone footage.
Thanks for showing the comparisons.
Hero 5 looks better doubt worth the upgrade
The hero five is better
Justine do the Vlog on Linear Mode
The iPhone 8 video is so much nicer wow
Colors look more saturated on Hero 5. Hero 6 shoots darker. But iPhone 8+ is the best in this camera comparison!
Am I the only one who sees that GoPro hero 5 and IPhone 8+ are better than GoPro hero6
The crazy go pro lady 😂😂😂 love you Justine

Make a what is on my iPhone 8
Don't you need to add a review?
In my opinion, not sure if it has to do with HEVC quality for the GoPro, but both the iPhone and Hero 5 are far better than the Hero 6.
Adding to your comment about being USB C charging.  If you kept all your accessories from your Samsung Note 8 unboxing you can use the the small dongle adapter with your old micro USB cable.  I use my old micro USB cable with the dongle adapter.  It's a 5 ft cord from my note 4.  I hate the short cord that they give now.
What happened to the contrast on Hero 6?,the IPhone 8 plus camera looks way better than Hero 6.The Hero 6 fps is pretty nice but thats about it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORfeupQnEZo&t=187s like video for a free GoPro hero 6
I noticed the color on the 5 if better than the 6. Is that Protune? or other settings changed?
I wish she could toss my balls around like that.
So its a bigger version of the GoPro 5 then?
What will be new in cooking videos. :) Most of your cooking videos are full of horrors. We are very used to it so let's see... \n\nP.s. They are fun.
The hero 5s video was better
The 240 fps on the Hero 6 looks really bad.. not sure if that was conversion or something?
I think the GoPro hero 5 is better than the 6
I hope for the sake of the Hero it was the codex conversion. There seems to be a lot of artifacts and even maybe some frame drops on the Hero 6. The iPhone was smooth and captured the video with much more clarity and brightness. I guess we’ll see with future videos.
omg it's trending
You are chooooo cute😚
Hero 5 has better lighting
I am big fan ofu
iPhone 8+ slo-mo is better
https://youtu.be/6_S6ub2Bkqk
iPhone was way better!!!
Yass
Awesome cool !!!**
Geil
I phone 8
Again.... another comparison with iPhone 8+ and yet.... it doesn’t look good for GoPro
Gotta love how simple and nice her videos are
what's the music name?
waiting for the review on the fusion!
Can you do a darker background? Like UnboxTherapy, it's much more relaxing for the eyes!
The hero 5 looks better to me
Hope they have longer battery life
Wow, the Iphone 8 seems way better than the GoPro 6, I mean the GoPro 6 has a wider view, but the color on the Iphone is just superior to the GoPro6. The GoPro5 also seems to have better video quality in most of the shots she showed, except for the slo-motion.
in the gopro 6 its much darker..
Why aren't you dead
Justine u ate dumb and the hero6 sucks and love u
HERO 6 is trash H5 and the IPhone 8 looked better
Seems like the 5 shoots better... looks better than the 6 anyways... seems clearer, cleaner!   :-)
I was surprised, 8+'s camera was way better than Hero 6. 😯
The hero 5 looks better tahn the 6 but overall i guess the iphone still wins😂😂
I love you and your channel.Whats not to like.Your gorgeous and very funny while always teaching about all sorts of different stuff.Thank you so much you always brighten my day.
They shouldn't have released the hero 6 until something was different than hero 5 it's the same thing if FPS is what they think we need your wrong  go pro we want video quality that you can't get from a phone????? Thanks for sharing
i think that hero 6 is really terrible>>>
The 6 looks shitty compared to the 5.
I dunno man, the Hero 5 looks way better than the Hero 6. The picture is a lot brighter whereas the Hero 6 video looks flat and bland.
The Hero 5 looks a little better
Literally the exact same thing as GoPro hero 5
Colors are better on the Hero 5 and the slow mo was better on the 8
The lighting looks horrible on Hero 6!!
Where’s your cooking video\nWaiting for it

What, no Tecmo Pro Wrestling?
AVGN 4 Smash Nintendo Switch Edition.
I love Shawn Michael
Awesome! :-)
Hoping Brian Zane show up lol
Doink joke was perfect
Dope episode
Ljn strikes again
LJN = Little Jabronies Network. If ya smellllllll what the NErd is cookin!
Loved it
Saludos desde México.
Part 2 please!!!
Just love your work, dude!!!!!
LJN, taste the rainbow, mother-fucker!
Needs more Shock Master!
AVGN again, woohooo
Loved this episode
Nice stone cold impression
Glad to see new episodes James :D
Top 3 NES wrestling games\n\n1. World Championship Wrestling\n2. Tecmo World Wrestling\n3. Pro Wrestling\n\nTop 3 SNES wrestling games\n\n1. Royal Rumble\n2. Natsume Championship Wrestling (hard, but lots of depth)\n3. Saturday Night Slam Masters\n\nTop 3 Genesis wrestling games\n\n1. WWF Raw\n2. Wrestle War\n3. Royal Rumble
Man the one chance for an avgn and wrestling with wregret crossover 😥😥 man it would have been dope to see my man Brian Zane banter with avgn
To BE the Nerd, you gotta BEAT the Nerd!\nWe want the angry sucka! James Rolfe! We commin' for you Nerd!
I love avgn missed out on the Owen Heart  beyblade special.
RAW and Royal Rumble were excellent lol Played several hours with a friend
Wrestling is still pretty big in countries that don't have Vince Mcmahon.
Stomp clap. Stomp stomp clap. Stomp clap. Stomp stomp clap. Ayyahhh! Eagle's born out of thunder.
Great episode! But raw is one of my favorite wrestling games.
Nerd please address the issue of the scissors taped to the machete in the last of us, just for fun please
I love that invisible knees is the punchline.
Thank you thank you thank you for reviewing Tag Team Wrestling!  I remember picking that game for my birthday when I was like 7 and being so disappointed in it. I thought it was going to be the greatest thing ever but it turned out to be a shitload of fuck. Long live the Fighting Rickys!
The Intro is pure gold!
Thanks I always get excited when I see a new need episode
The WWF Arcade was pretty fun
That cold stone Steve Austin intro
Why Miller Lites!? Where's the Rolling Rock!? Did I miss some AVGN beer choice changes?! JK love whatcha do. keep it up.
Fuck yeah great idea for an episode. (hasnt watched) Love ya AVGN/JR :P
royal rumble for snes is a GEM in wrestling gems... dude without a doubt. many hours sunk into that back in the day
The dramatic way he pulls the game out of the cart slot cracks me up
I'd pay to see AVGN take part in a wwe match, who else agrees?
James should do an episode with all the remaining LJN games that he hasn't reviewed yet. That way he'll be rid of them forever
That is so weird. After his last video, I was thinking it would be cool if he did some wrestling video games, and look what happened.
Jesus Christ, did ljn have EVERY license back then???
Ljn is like herpes... they keep coming back
That Tag Team Wrestling game is menu based.  After you connect with a punch a popup menu appears and you have a second or so to quickly scroll up and down to select a wrestling move to execute.
Was Mike the cartridge?
QUICK! SOMEONE MAKE AVGN AS A WRESTLER IN THE NEWEST WWE GAME!
Jesus christ, that final promo on the game, that was one hell of a promo
AVGN uploading episodes with two weeks between each other?! WHAT IS THIS WITCHCRAFT?!
The Funny thing is that the WCW game from the original Nintendo was ACTUALLY way better than the WCW Superbrawl game for Super Nintendo...
Shoulda gone into the classic N64 games man.
I like most AVGN episodes, but as a hardcore wrestling fan, this one is just plain mean. I’ve played every LJN WWE game (two of which I own) and they are far from as bad as the nerd makes them out to be.
That was fun, though I was kind of hoping you might get your hands on Firepro wrestling somehow, but this was a good selection to rail on, with two fun games thrown in to balance things out.\n\nGood episode!
The nerd is mad again.
Very nice episode, James. Fingers crossed for an 150 Episodes Special, not to mention the holiday specials. Keep uploading. I'll keep watching. Thanks for thirteen (or eleven) years and 149 episodes of shitty games.
lol Miller lite. Good choice for white trash beer. :D
I thought Wrestlemania Challenge was pretty decent actually. Better than the other ones for sure.
Keeping it old school with the diarrhea insults. Love it.
quite a curse near the end, chapéau.
Funny thing is, the tatoo is real...
Miller lite? What happened to Rolling Rock?
Royal Rumble was actually good (on sega)
I can't wait to see the BTS footage of this episode. Loved it!
Wrestlemania Challenge is a good game...
This Avgn season feels really fresh. My favourite recent episode is the power rangers one.
Its interesting that he made a video about wrestling in general cuz I ain't think he used to like wrestling
I wonder what special thing he has planned for episode 150.
These games need to be deported.
who are these people from top left down Dustin Rhodes, Vader, rick rude, ric flair, johnny b bad, rick steiner, sting, brian pillman, Scott Steiner, Ron Simmons, Ricky the Dragon steamboat and Barry Windom
Should have been Rolling Rock cans wtf James?????!?!???!??!!!!!
Pro wrestling is one of my favorite NES games just for how ridiculous it is.
part two please as there ones worse on ps1 and n64 even the legends of wrestling series were bad
good episode except you forgot n64 acclaim wrestling titles
You have NO idea how long I've been waiting for a wresting episode. Great video, James!
This game is the worst there is, the worst there was, and the worst there ever will be!\n\nLooks like somebody's never heard of WCW Backstage Assault
Damn.. His hair is really disappearing.
That promo you just did practically buried pro wrestling. As a smark I'm ashamed you didn't put over your opponent.
World Champion Wresting (nes) is where it's at.  That's why it didn't get shamed in the video... it's just too awesome.\nLoved the cartridge costume! :D
i think the greatest WWF match i saw was hulk hogan against andre the giant when he lifted the giant and suplex him.
Ultimate Muscle wrestling games on gamecube were amazing and horrible at the same time
Kinda wish he would have thrown in 1 or 2 PS2 games just for fun. For some reason I remember loving Smackdown vs Raw 2006 along with Here Comes The Pain
AND HIS NAME IS JAMES ROLFE\n🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺
Where did the hair go?
THQ did WWF/E games a ton better up until Wrestlemania 2000. The games THQ did for both WWE/WCW on the N64 were beyond fun!
You should've included Street fighter v
I've been waiting for a wrestling episode! Ooohh hell yea
They needed an NES Game where you played as JOHN CENA!
I feel like you could do an entire episode on Hammerlock Wrestling...  I'm surprised you left it out tbh
What a waste of perfectly good beer
Finally! - a Nerd episode about some of my fav wrestling games growing up lol\n\n\nMy life is complete.
Is James losing hair? Mmmm
Wrestling is scripted, but that shit hurts as fuck. They just do it to entertain us and some don’t appreciate it which is sad. Those guys and girls risk their lives.
I am really old rented some of these games at blockbuster back in the day rofl
The review about 'team tag' is completely wrong...of course it ain't a kinda masterpiece but not 'STRONGLY BAD' as he said...\nafter succeed to hit your enemy you can choose technics that you want with 'B button' such as throwing merciless smashing and even ultimately attack as well...\nanyway don't get me wrong guys I'm a big fan of AVGN also super like this episode as well but what I wanted to say is 'team tag' isn't so a kinda sucked game...as a matter of fact I enjoyed it a lot of time with my friends
Modern wrestling 🤼‍♀️ games are crap 💩 too.(and all sports games that come out every year.And call of 💩doodie💩.)
Raw is war is one of the wrestling game I ever played. I bought it And i played hours with friends. The royal rumble mode is awesome. It is a good ljn game. I think the nerd just played a minute for that video and it is a shame.
Wrestle mania the arcade game for the genesis was my favorite. Sheer dumb fun. With some classic characters. The SNES version was to watered down for me. Sure, better graphics, and sound quality, but not as fun.
Estuve todo el día viniendo a corroborar si ya tenía los subtítilos en español, pero no... ¡¿Dónde están mis héroes bilingües?!

Prayers Eric!
Why Not Me🌞
Chief. Church is my guy, favorite artist. This is why I listen to country music. #MAGA
Love this tribute.  🙌🏼 I wondered if Eric had seen the CNN interview.  ❤🙏🏻
he has real heart
Definitely cried a little watching this :( Eric Church has long been a favorite of mine but God rn he's truly powerful with the words & his heartbroken voice.
Aaaw... Poor Eric. Jason Aldean didn't even seem that sad. I doubt that Eric would have just run off like Jason did, without saying anything had he been there.
i cant stand todays pop country, but when i listen to church i only hear soul.
That was rough, but I'm glad I watched it.  Extreme class shown there by Mr Church.  I don't even know much about him other than  a couple songs, but right now I am gonna go download every thing he ever recorded out of respect, for that one performance.
Even through tragedy there are haters, helpers, and healers.  I hope some looking for answers can hear this song and it can bring some sort of comfort. Eric Church much like Alan Jackson did after 911 you went to your heart and used your God given talent that will be felt and hopefully give some comfort to folks in pain. Thank you.
This was gut wrenching and beautiful and I cried the whole time I watched. Country music is my music and I've never felt more defensive of it as I do now. 💔God Bless Eric Church.
this man feels this in every fiber of his being, and in his gut, how wonderful of him to do this.
Screw any one of you stupid mf that dislike this video.
Beautiful song! This man is a true country boy! Anyone who jumps back on the stage that quick after a tragedy is my guy!
omg.. survivors guilt?\nhe is obviously moved by the whole experience.. listen to his voice! so sick of stupid people hating on every one and everything
Heather and Sonny  brought me here.   I am truly sorry  she lost him ...and I am indeed sorry for all who lost life and the families left behind.    We are all with you.
This is why I will always be a member of the Church Choir. He is by far and away the realest country singer out there. This song brought tears to my eyes. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this horrible tragedy. Mr Church, thank you for writing a beautiful song and know you do the world a service helping us to heal. I raise my boot to you sir and you are my guy
Yes, we’re your people Eric Church and I won’t let acts of violence keep me hidden in my home because of fear. I’ll continue to attend Country music festivals and concerts. I’ll be more aware of my surroundings but I won’t become a prisoner of fear. God Bless all those affected by the tragic event in Vegas and God Bless you for your beautiful heartfelt song.
This is exactly why I love country music.
An absolute class act! Beautiful and eloquent, our NC guy. Thank you Mr Church.
Country music is the best thing to ever come from the USA and it will never be taken from us. It can be happy, it can be sad. It can represent new beginnings or old times and throwbacks. I love country music, all of it. This is an incredible song.
A simple thank you isn't nearly enough.....you and your words mean so much to so many people....your songs,your passion,and most of all your heart and soul is something the world needs more of.... I'm sure these words will never reach your eyes but from the bottom of my heart thank you Eric Church for being the man you are.
They'll never break us we'll stand strong for those who can't right now, we'll defend our music, defend our country and defend the survivors and god bless the ones we lost. I'll never let them be remembered in vane and memory pushed aside by politicians! We are Americans we are the III%
Eric wouldn't have left his fans to be alone with a madman like Jason did!
Whoa!! I’m trying not to cry as I am watching this....& I am losing my crap very fast!! Holy crap I am so proud of him for doing the Opry even tho he didn’t want to!!
I was there, I saw everything Eric did, and everything that went on that horrible night. I am so grateful that Eric did this song. I will keep it in my heart FOREVER. Hopefully it will replace some of the horrible memories I have. #VegasStrong
How amazing your songs are your music sings to my soul I relate to so many of your songs. You are the chief thank you.
Chills, tears, & pure respect! Such an amazing musician & man! Stay strong Eric! We know you're hurting, but we're here with you! United we stand! God Bless you & all those affected by this awful tragedy. 💔💙🇺🇸🙏🏼
I'm not a real big fan of most any new country music, I fact I hate pretty much all of it. I still listen to Waylon, Merle, Willie, Jones, etc and can't get into the new hip hop country stuff, but Eric Church has never put out a song that I haven't liked. He is one of the few new artists that is just that, an artist. This is a prime example of that, just straight from the heart truth; that is true country music.
Someone just won a grammy. Hopefully all the artists there make an album and give all the money to the survivors to help them heal and cope from this tragedy
Wonderful Mr.Church!,We have all asked that at some time or another. Our Heavenly Father's divine grace! Beautiful words. This is why, he is my favorite! Country through and through. A man with a true heart! We need to vome together and pray for our country and for the ones in Vegas that are hurting. The loss of their lived ones. For all of us that may not understand but ARE hurting gor those that are! God Bless Country Music!
To the 48 people who hit dislike, I pray for you!
Broke the world record for saying UMM
This is so raw and beautiful!! My broken heart appreciates this ❤️❤️
It saddens me that we live in a world where a song like this can be written from personal experience. So many of Eric's songs have the ability to heal. Thanks for another Chief.
Eric, you got me with that one.
I hope Mrs. Melton gets to see this video. This is why he will always be my favorite musician.
and that's why he's the best
https://youtu.be/2BwpFl73HEg sorry to hear your song inspired me to write this your one of my favorites
What the he'll is wrong with that crowd that can't stop shouting dbags while he is trying to be serious?
Great tribute song. Well done.   But I can't help but ask...Where was he?   God?
This is perfect, this is everything.
This needs to be recorded and needs to go to number 1.
Such class. Prayers for all affected.
A real class act!  A TRUE Heart and great person.  Plus an awesome county artist.
Thank you Eric, I live in the great city of Las Vegas. This week has been hard for everyone both here and across the country. The day after the shooting I realized how much I love this town. The feeling of grief was everywhere, but the feeling of community and staying strong without thought of race, creed, or color was over powering. We will recover, but nothing will ever bring back the sense of security we lost that night. We are #vegasstrong. Thank you and the rest of the route 91 harvest festival artist. We love you guys and hope you'll be back soon. God bless #vegasproud
This is such a beautiful song! Well done Eric Church!
I'm crying so much right now. Nothing could hit harder than this terrible act of pure evil. I've grown up my whole life country and southern folks are all pretty much family so when something like this happens it tears you apart on the inside even if you didn't even know them. How could you kill such kind and wonderful people who just went to a festival to have fun and to be happy with their friends, family, and even strangers? My heart breaks for everyone who died and everyone who survived and their families and their friends who have to continue on with their lives as if nothing happened. We can't even have a good time without someone ruining it. such a shame
I love Eric Church!! Made me tear up when he was describing the crowd and just makes me more pissed off to think how senseless that shooting was to all of the innocent people trying to enjoy life and have a little fun!! God bless America- we sure need it now
I tip my hat to you hombre
I've always been a big fan of Eric Church, and this song proves why. This is a man who sings of real life, and puts so much thought and emotion and makes them just so relatable. May this song be played loud for everyone in this country to hear, as it is through music like this that we recover from a tragedy. It is songs like this that show the true emotions of the people of this country, and may it be one that never fades from our memory.
Been a fan of him for many years. I've been lucky enough to see him twice in concert. He is by far amazing and doing this just further cements his love for his fans.
I like what he had to say
It bothers me that people are cheering and yelling as he's crying talking about something so devastating. There's a time and a place for all that stuff, this definitely wasn't one of those times. Makes me wonder where the compassion is with some of them? Did they not have a clue what's going on and what he was saying?? Regardless, Eric Church, you're an amazing man. We are your people!
My favorite singer/songwriter. Eric is amazing.
I'm a guy who does not cry but this just broke me. I don't know if it's the fact that Vegas is my hometown or if it's seeing the hospital that I was born in blood streaked with innocent blood, or if it's because I'm a new father and I couldn't fathom the thought that my little girl would grow up without her daddy just like the many families are dealing with now. I'm so sorry to everyone you are my countrymen and my family and this one really struck a chord.
Well done Mr. Church. He is indeed the God of our salvation!
This guy is all class and all heart. He truly is my favorite  singer. His music touches your soul.
This legit made me tear up.
lots feeling in this tune
Eric, thank you for this...so hard to find the words at times like these
So much authentic emotion on display here. I have always loved Eric Church's music and felt like he pours his soul into his music. His words at the Opry further prove to me Eric is as real as it gets and he truly cares about his fans & human beings in general
Literally sitting in the tub bawling right now... beautiful tribute
Beautiful song from the heart. Hopefully it can give those that survived a bit of peace knowing there feelings are valid.
OMG....as I wipe away the tear...
Thankyou!  Love came right out you ......Godbless!
My dad went to high school and played basketball with him.....I feel special
For 13 years I've searched for a song that touched on the feelings expressed in this piece of magic Chief made here. I hate that we experience tragedy in our lives but honoring those we have lost because of it with such beautiful music is magical. These lyrics speak directly to the heart. They're real... powerful... and moving. That is the greatest thing about singer/songwriters like my favorite artist, EC.
Beautiful Mr.Church! You are a country music legend in my eyes. Love you
he's the man
How the heck does this video have dislikes!?
So much respect for Eric Church. Hope he releases this song. This is why he's my favorite singer!

I'm a fan, but this video is ridiculous. It does no justice and is almost offensive. That's how bad it is. Maybe it's because you won't remove your sunglasses when there's no sun, maybe because the performance is awful......... IDK.

I feel like the 4th is like alisha's
Does she live with Alex?
OMG LAUREN u should dye your hair red next btw I am ginger. We would be best baaaabes♥ love ya lauren
I think You Should Live In Hose Number One!
There are better houses than this
I love how when they give moose a toy, he LOOOOVEEEESSSSS IT!!!!!!!! He plays with it right away😍😍
You and Alex and some friends should move in with you!!!!!!!!!
I love all the Houses!
didn’t you just get a house
The 4th house looks like team 10's house
Are you wearing a Moana costume. Why doesn't Alex take care of you moosey bear.
Wow crazy how your soooo young and have the financial status to buy homes that look like they're at LEAST 2 million dollars. #blessed
I like house number 1
I honestly watch Moana 1 million times a week!
I say #2 house lol who agrees
YOU MADE YOUR OWN SQUISIES DIDN'T YOU?!?!?!?!?!?!!??!
house 4 looks like the team 10 house
tbh i love house # 1 because of the cool fridge haha but i personally want lauren to get house # 4 because i feel like moose will be so happy with the backyard and also, sad that there’s no pool but, i feel like lauren doesn’t need that much of a space. so i think lauren should get house # 4 :)\njust my opinion but yea :)\nthe pools are cool
You can make a pool your self
It’s my birthday
i think if your buying a house with a dog you really need a grass backyard and a place for it to run. But all the houses look great!
The house number 4 is like Lilly Singh's A.K.A IISuperwomaII house. 4:31
I love houses too...im super addicted with decorating and renovations!!!😍😍😍
omg it felt like Lauren just moved a month ago
You should give moose his own room in the new house that would be so cool
When is the Lorax song coming out
your dog is so adorable also I love your videos and your so pretty
Laurdiy merch please make it for male as well
I would recommend getting a backyard with a lot of grass for moose and a separate area with a pool so he doesn't get inside.
He he who gives a fuck libtard
Anyone watch jenn im's vlogs and thinking house 4 looked a lot like Jenn's?
Omg I live in Malibu California
IMAGINE IF LAUREN AND MR. KATE COLLABORATED ON THE HOUSE SHE WILL BUY THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE DIYS????
Yas! U ARE a strong and independent woman💖💪🏽

Notice a lot of YouTuber bought  house and always thank their fans/subscriber. It's the fans/subscribers that made it possible? Basically YouTuber are making profit as a YouTuber based on views and how often videos are uploaded. All nice tour decision, decision.....good luck on home upgrade regardless how it's possible within buying a home.
LOVE u Laur
Just asking ...are you married or single or engaged?☺
That house with a huge tree reminds me so much of Phineas and Ferb hahaha!
4:31 looks like the stairs in Jake Paul's house like if you agree
Can you do another Wanderlust video
Whooo no one caress!!!!!

Get out of LA wtf!!!    Find something with ambience and class.    You are losing it bub!!!!
I'm hungry, i want to eat
Those gooey noodles look amazing....wish I knew how to cook something like that
Spicy means burning butt when on the toilet 🚽
I do the same thing whenever I eat food from my country, especially specialized regional and provincial cuisine..
U should go New Orleans and go to try the special number 2 which is from Orchards Ramen restaurant.
That is not soup, its jello.
please try Filipino foods...  :)   love your videos...  the secret taste of every food I eat!!!!  stay cool!!!
Mike, make a Live Stream 🤤
Oh my god, I miss the food
this channel always makes me hungry
Definitely one thing I miss about LA is the MASSIVE variety of foods you can get.
Can you try Japanese food in LA? Cindy’s kitchen was 2 minutes away. Can you do a meetup at Westfield Santa Anita?
Hi Mike, when you order several dishes, do you eat all of them at one sitting or do you taste each and take the rest home...smile
Mike, I am so happy you got a taste of home! That is an important thing for people who have moved far from the the place they grew up. And thank you for the education! Watching your videos has taught me a great deal about places and cultures that I am not familiar with.
Would love to see you go to Xian
Mike omg I'm so happy I did not know you had this channel, I love Beyond Science. You are the man!
I can give you a few places to eat at since your in my home town
Did he say my wife's friends recommended it
It's a motel for Chinese food
The consistency of the soup looks like snot. 😶
You should  try the hat in la  san Gabriel yum good  eatting
Hot oil is king !

How old are you then 30?
I LOVE MUSLIM PEOPLE N THEIR FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thumbs up, just for mentioning 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' because that's the best name ever, and I'm still bummed that they changed it.
The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.
what if you havent seen the original movies?
I wasnt a big fan of the original Blade Runner, in fact i found it boring for the most part, went to see this film for Denis Villeneuve and loved it.
Honestly, it was one of the best movie of the year. I respect your opinion, but I'm a little disappointed in your verdict.
So is blade runner 2049 a visual marble like Avatar 3D? Avatar 3D in theater was the prettiest movie so far.
It was messy and disjointed, but had a good twist and makes you think. Actually contemplating seeing this again in a couple days to see what's what.
Lol I felt like I was in a bus looking thru the window just going wow kool visuals and enjoying the visual aspect but the rest was just boring with 5 minutes of action then your back with visual. So yea you paid to watch a world of visual. Boring movie good luck it really sucked!!!! Ryan gosling just Sux...movie was fkn bad!!!!!
How can you not mention the fucking visuals?! Blew my FUCKING mind. The OG blade runner is good with great parts for me, 2049 is better in my opinion
loved the original Blade Runner loved the new Blade Runner
Im a Blade Runner fan. Im a HUGE Denis fan. This movie was not great. Am i the only one?
Glad someone else saw it as I did, pretty much agreed with all you said here!
I hate the original Blade Runner but I actually love 2049. 2049 is what i wanted the original to be after i finished watching it. The biggest and most important difference to me between the two movies is that 2049 has a much more interesting and engaging story to tell.
It seemed a bit to spelt out for me. Bladerunner was more wtf I have to think about this. Bladerunner 2049 was here we did the thinking for you here are your answers.
lol your review under sold it by a lot, that movie was incredible and don't get me started on the music, hans zimmer is a god
Greatest movie of my life
I'm a big fan of Bladerunner, thanks for the review, I'm looking forward to seeing the new one.
How 2049 didn't get Awesometacular is beyond me. MASTERPIECE
Just got back from the theater. I watched the original a year or so ago, and while I enjoyed it, I wasn't really blow away (a good time no alcohol required). 2049 though, I freaking LOVED! I loved the idea of replicants and I loved the world from the original, and I really loved seeing the style and world that I admired so much again, but with a plot I was more invested in emotionally. The pacing can get a little off at times, and there was one scene that was a little out of place, but I actually think it's a better film than the original overall if you ignore how influential the original is. Easy 9/10 for me!
so is Rick a replicant!!?!?!?
of a movie is good I don't mind it being 3 hours long. also the cinematography was on point.
Saw it tonight. Pacing was kind of balls but other than that, definitely was a good movie.
Just got don’t seeing it..amazing! It was beautifully shot and just like that first film he stuck true to the original movie and I love that. However would agree it was very very slow at times and could have done away with a lot in the film but that’s how the original was. Word of advice don’t go to the late late showings see it during the day as it’s almost 3 hours long.
I tried, I really tried. This movie was bloated, boring and exhausting. I almost left. 2h and 43 minutes. Shoot me.
I actually enjoyed this movie a lot.
Saw it tonight and absolutely loved it
This movie wasn't that good. Original was better (only watched Director's Cut), but even that movie didn't blow me away.
Dude, the film is slow. That doesn’t mean the pacing is bad.
Where's the red dead redemption 2 reaction!?!
You know Deckard was a replicant (if you don't know, he was/is played by Harrison Ford). Will be seeing this tomorrow after work, can't wait! Loved the first movie and I was young when the original came out!
Wow Chris Stuckmann really sucked Denis's dick in his review , thanks for your honest review I'll think about watching it
Jesus, i'm only three minutes in and you're giving away plot details and you spoiled the whole Deckard -replicant theory. Put a Spoiler Warning next time. Glad i saw the movie before watching this.
to me bladerunner original was huge for its time. Best appreciated in the dark era of film that it was made in. Before the neon lights of the mid 80s the bladerunner era was dark.\n.\nIt had a very scary impact on me as a kid. Watching it now in the bright world of social media with cell phones keeping us protected seems less of an experience. Having said all this , bladerunner was a really good movie but its not this masterpiece fans are making it out to be. It was a very slow paced film because it was a slow paced era.
its a great sequel and a twist to the story
Robots aren't people, the fuck is wrong with you guys?
I haven't watched Blade Runner 2049 yet(I know.), but I remember that I'd watched Blade Runner after watching stuff like Fifth Element, so it was quite a shock to my system. I dunno, I'd probably catch it at some point, but I just don't think I'll be paying a full price ticket for it.
Can’t stand this idiot
What is the difference between the versions of blade runner endings,  cause he references that in this review.
Just saw this movie and it's awessometacur not blu ray
Unpopular Opinion: Blade Runner 2049 is better than the original
I’ll pass on seeing it in theaters but I will see it on a rainy day on Netflix’s.
Saw it yesterday. Pretty solid/good movie. However it's surely no masterpiece and fairly overrated.
Spoiler Jeremy????!!!! Come on man, watch it...
This movie was a 10
This is the most honest and direct review for this movie being that this is a direct sequel to Blade Runner for Blade Runner fans. I think you can enjoy it without being a fan of the first one. That’s certainly my case, don’t hate or even particularly like the first but I respect it enough to call it on its BS.
Been a follower of JJ for years now but his reviews this year would have been a better time if I was drunk. I rate his movie reviews for 2017 5.5/10
I liked it more than the original one. No spoilers, just my opinion.
Can we watch blade runner 2 if i haven’t watched blade runner 1
Denis Villeneuve is quickly rising in my top directors list.
ok just saw this movie.it fucking sucks.no originality the landscape was as dry or saturated as the story. it was like a meld of total recall and judge dred the originals and they weren't that grate. This movie looked and felt nothing like the original which put this one to shame. I even saw a couple of people walk out. would someone make a remake or sequel that is worth a shit.the three short films they made to go with this movie were better than the movie.
Best review so far. Many thanks.
I love Blade Runner. I love Villeneuve. But I think this movie is a bore. Maybe it's because I saw the twist as soon as we met a certain character, or maybe because I've seen it before. nothing seemed new. I loved some of the world building but it never dived into anything beyond surface. It felt like a collage of other great sci fi and dystopian stories. Beautiful to look at (except brand names placed in your face) but hollow to me. I walked out of prisoners, enemy, sicario, and arrival thinking about my worldview in a different way. Those movies made me think. This movie did not. It honestly felt like fan fic.
Wow, this review is absolute shit. The pacing was perfect, you’re just impatient. The original Blade Runner (Final Cut) is a masterpiece, and so is this movie. Harrison Ford was outstanding, along with Ryan Gosling. I want to watch this movie again.
I watched the original for the first time a year ago and didn't like it. I freaking loved blade runner 2049
When I first saw the original (theatrical cut)  back-in-the-day, I didn't exactly appreciate it.  Though, having seen the original, I wanted to go see this new one.  So, I watched the original again recently.  This time, I watched the Final Cut and I actually appreciated the story much more.  I watched and enjoyed all of the short films that were released and now I am ready to see... 2049.  Going tomorrow or on the weekend.  Haven't decided yet.
Man this movie blew me away. It's a masterpiece. If you like the original, you'll LOVE this one
That one dangling hair... Can't focus on what ur saying
Didn't like the original. Didn't love this movie either
Okay is his audio off sync with his video
wasn't planning to watch it but now ill give it a shot after this review
I just got back and OMG what a snooze fest. I had to fight to not doze off. 1/3 of the movie is mute and at least 40 minutes didn't need to be in the movie. If you make an almost three hour movie you better deserve it and this one just didn't.
just came back from watching it. one of the most boring movies i ever seen but had some visually stunning parts. overall a terrible movie though i wouldnt watch it again.
Oscar killed Reeva and i hope they over turn the verdict to 20-25 years it was not self defence we were in 4 armed robberies and they had AK47 he is talking bullshit
So Ford is a replica?????
I wasn't a fan of the original and I'm sorry but I'm not a huge fan of this one... pretty boring in my opinion... and don't say it's cuz I can't handle slow movies cuz I can I just did not like this one
if this had been a true blade runner sequel then everyone would have hated for about 10 to 20 until a directors cut was released and then it would be considered a classic
This movie made Denis Villi- something one of my favorite directors, right up there with Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, and Zack Snyder ( Yes, I like Scott and Snyder. If you don't like\nthem, that's your opinion.)
Douchebag reviews. If your really annoying millennial coworker cornered you in the break room.
The first is among my favourite movies.  The trailers for this look stunning, and I know this is a labour of love for Denis Villeneuve.  I've avoided spoilers - and thanks for doing so in your review as well - and am totally looking forward to this.
Hey JJ what stopped Blade Runner 2 from being awesometacular?
I kind of fell in love with Ana de Armas' character\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich is just sad on many levels.
You need more hair spray!!
Fwiw, villeneuve is on the record saying there will be no recuts
should i watch all 2048 prequels before i watch the latest movie? \n\nit might take a while wathcing all of them.
what is interesting about Jeremy's reviews is that he has a different tone to his voice for each of his ratings he ends up giving a movie.  just from the tone, you can easily predict what is rating will be as soon as he starts talking.
Make a review of Gotham Season 3, Its pretty good
Do a cult of chucky review tho
Kinda tired of the whole can robots have a conscience thing they always dance around. I liked what SOMA did and was just answer it with a straight up YES and then showed us a bunch of fucked up situations that happen if you can copy paste consciousness etc
I was sold when I heard it was basically a $200 Million arthouse film with a good story. I'm excited.

A movie should NEVER be longer than 2 hrs, 30 minutes imo, NO singular story is so long & convoluted that it should be impossible to properly concentrate all necessary content into a cohesive product within that time frame. \n\nFor such lengthy stories in other mediums (Ex- literature), the best method for adapting a single book of great scope is splitting into multiple parts. This is why I have much respect for film editors, as trimming the fat can be the hardest job.
I'm sorry, I simply can't listen to your voice while you're reviewing movies. I would rather: a) continue watching Stuckmann or b) place a toothpick under by big toenail and kick a wall.
It's so sad that you felt the need to clarify that it was a proverbial string, we aren't that fucking dumb, even if you think so, well some of us aren't

It could be an electric guitar if... Rob Scallon 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's make this a meme, People!!
Well, I failed miserably. And I play the clarinet. At least the piano is unmistakable.\n1: It's an electric guitar.\n2: Wait, that's an electric guitar. The first was a clarinet.\n3: No, that's an electric guitar. The second was a nylon guitar.\n4: That's a piano. Definitely a piano.\n5: I have nothing...\n6: Wait, that's a nylon guitar. Wait, then what was the second one?
Guessed all of them right!
I want a test WITHOUT an answer sheet.
I play trumpet and literally that blew my mind. 😳
Nailed it. 6 out of 6.
I got them all right. I wouldn't of guessed cello but because all the rest I was confident on the one I didn't know was cello.
I don't get it, this test doesn't seem that hard to me
I got them all right but I work with the middle of sampled instruments all the time.
I got em!! But only because the choices were so limited.
Wow I actually got all of them right
yuh i got all this right on the first time
I got them all correct after I switched which ones I thought were piano/nylon guitar. After I heard the last one I relaized it was the nylon guitar. but 4/6 isn't too bad for the first try...
6/6 and I still can’t write a good song 😐
UGH why do you have boyintheband. Hes so emo he should be in the back of a school room hiding his ugly face. But yourblucky you have the impressionist and you, i liked.
I got all of them right! I thought the piano was nylon guitar at first, but when I heard the last one I figured since you let Roomie change his answer, I could too. So I guess I got 5/6 right if I weren't allowed to switch, but I'm still proud :D
I got them all right
It would be an electric guitar if... that'd be a funny meme. Get on it people who are more talented than I.
i had this idea a few weeks ago lol
Not that anyone cares, but I got 100%
I got it all right! (Id hope so since I’m doing music at uni)
I got the cello one wrong
I got them all right!
I got them all right!
I got them all right!
This video would be an electric getar if we remove the gitar from it and replace it with youtube
100%!
I got 6/6 😎
TREENDSSIINGNNGNG
The only ones I could make out perfectly were the cello and piano because I play the two.
It could be an electric guitar.... If it was tuned to drop C
Got them all right but definitely wouldn't have if I didn't know what instruments there were...

There midi samples but I love this challenge I would like to try it with the natural instruments. it was like two challenges in one for me .thanks  I enjoyed it
got them all right! but I reckon that’s luck rather than skill
I have not went to any musical school and I still got everything right
I’m so surprised that I got all of these.
I got them all right! :3 it's easy if you use midi samples often
OMG! I have no musical talent yet somehow I got all of them right too XD what????
I thought that was actually quite easy, to be honest.
I've been doing ear training and it's been really easy. I did this just to prove to myself that I do have a really good ear, and I won! I got them all right somehow. Or maybe this doesn't mean anything?... Nah I'ma just say I've got a good ear. Just let me have this. Lol
I get ir all
They could all be electric guitars if...
The chemistry between these three is amazing.
Wow, I got all 6 correct and I'm not even a musician however I listen to music 18 hours a day.
That was really, really bloody difficult. It would've been even more difficult had I not googled what a clarinet sounds like before.\n\nIf they weren't samples, I might've actually had more of a difficult time than had they been real instruments.
Hey Andrew
So youve done it before and you did it again and got them all, weird.
I really surprised myself and got all them correct haha crazy
we had to pass a similar test in 6th grade to join band the following year.
who else doesn't know shit about music but still finds andrews videos interesting?
got them all except the trumpet that i had to re-evaluate after i heard the cello :D
i got em all right
This was fairly easy!
I just dropped some new merch and they are  selling like a god church
I got all of them right and have never taken any music lesson. Interesting....It might have been good for me if I had pursued music.

Got all of them right. I didn't think it was that hard. Without options thought, that would have sucked
It could be an electric guitar...
That was surprisingly easy to me. I imagine it be a lot more difficult if you started getting into similar instruments, like a harp, piano, guitar, cello, violin, and banjo.
So... that wasn't difficult. Fun watch though!
tbh got them all right but i also got to see the people say what they thought
So I went to an arts school and i played tormbone, viola, guitar ( we did both acoustic and electric but mostly acoustic until performance time), piano and voice and thank god i got 100% bc it'd be embarrassing if I didn't
Hey Andrew tell your racist friend how you feel when he mocks Asians with slanted eyes gesture.
Nice I got all of them right! Do I win a thing?
What the heck? I got these all right, but thought it was very easy to guess them o:
Is this guy gay?
They all sound like drums.
I got them all right!
You should do a real or digital intrument/orchestra test
I got 'em all!  But I had to wait to hear the cello before I was sure the previous one was electric guitar.  I played trumpet for 8 years, so I most definitely knew that sound.
Ugh i switched the piano and nylon guitar but 4/6 for me yay
WHO THE F*CK IS THIS GUY !!!!!!!!!?
Clarinet\nElectric\nNylon (Funny, because I said trumpet, but switched it....)\nTrumpet\nPiano\nCello
I GOT THEM ALL RIGHT
I was 100% right! I have no background in music so I'm proud. How many sounds were presented in the original class mentioned?
I got all right thankfully
Got em all right
Clarinet, Electric Guitar, Trumpet, Piano, Cello, Nylon Guitar\nRight, Right, Right,  Right, Right, Right.
100% 😃
Pleaseeeee do the instrumennnntttttt!!!!!
Nailed it!
6 for 6 baby
All right. ;)
4/6 because I swapped nylon guitar with piano. #itcouldbeanelectricguitarif
Stupid noise !! 😕😖
All 6!
YES i got them nyahahahah
Yeasssssss got 'em all
Perfect score squad wya?

Instead of them introducing Uncle Benjin during this time and having a reunion with Jon, they decided to spend thousands if not millions on a stupid ass polar bear. They could have sent Benjin to the wall to get Davos to send ravens instead of having gendry run 30 miles an hour to get there.
I'm so loving the comment section
This scene was unnecessary, why didn't you use it to build up Benjins return instead? The writers of this season was stupid as shit, people didn't start liking GOT because of the crazy action but because of the characters, and although action is awesome, it gets tasteless if you don't have a good plot line to follow it. Please get good again in the last season thanks
Dear Game of Thrones: FYI, for S8 we would rather have the direwolves over war elephants from Essos... Sincerely, The Fans\nP.S. No one wanted a fooking polar bear when we could have had scenes with Ghost!
Quit bragging about something that is literally the biggest waste of time and resources in the entire show. I still liked this season, but it's no secret the writing has taken a nosedive recently, and when keep seeing you guys talking about your zombie polar bear you had to work so hard as a team to get in, it makes me realize just how much worse at writing compelling entertainment the Davids are than George.
Of all the things in season seven, this bullshit is what pissed me off the most (besides Littlefinger and the Jonerys buffoonery) This story is supposed to be about people. It's supposed to be about treachery and relationships and the complexity of human nature. It's not spending millions of dollars on a fucking zombie polar bear. D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island). This is really long and congrats of you got to the end but in conclusion: D&D can go fuck themselves. We don't need these fuckers in charge.
We didn’t even see Ghost in season 7! Sansa only mentioned him :(
I appreciate the bear but would have preferred Ghost . Atleast once in the season.
Why the fuck is a zombie polar bear cool again??? \n\nD&D are fucking idiots.
If somebody ever asks me what's so bad about being mainstream, I will point them to this fucking polar bear.
You included a zombie bear rather than having ghost or even good fucking writing
Just saw the 14 minute version of this...simply amazing 😊👍
I'm glad we got this polar bear that nobody remembered or talked about after the episode was over. I mean, we had to trade off ghost, a super important character to the story that carries loads of symbolism, so we didn't have him during the uniting of the two biggest characters of the entire show, no matter what kind of symbolism could have been carried through him, but it was all worth it in the end for this epic polar bear. The one that nobody remembers. The one that had no narrative purpose whatsoever.
Its a real shame the show seems to be giving in to what the fans want e.g 70% action episodes. It may be what people want but what they want may not necessarily be good for the show. The drawn out discipline and diplomacy of season 6, skipping out what could have been massive action scenes (such as Stannis at Winterfell) lead to the final 2 episodes being the biggest pay offs in TV history for many viewers. I feel game of thrones is just been rushed now, like this zombie polar bear contributed nothing to the plot. No one important died from it, it didn't lead to anything they just killed it and moved on. It was just action for the sake of action. Smart, thought out intelligent screen writing with good pay offs and twists made game of thrones great. Not pointless action like in the walking dead.
This is why we didn't see ghost. They spent all the budget on Toby the bear.

Why Polar bear? Where is the spiders big as hounds. Disappointment!
Thoros Of Myr died for a stupid Polar Bear -.-
Hit the play button, fluffed my pillow behind my back, sat back to watch the Zombie Polar Bear - video already finished.\nThanks fooking Game Revealed!
Loved that scene, it was epic 😱
Not gonna lie... the thumbnail of the zombie polar bear shit looks like Rap Monster😂👀
Youre not a bear, your name is Toby
This reminds me of Ralph the movie maker
FUCK THE ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR!!! THE CGI MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO BRING BACK GHOST!!!! I WANT GHOST!!!!
This bullshit sums up the terrible transformation this show has undergone. I first fell in love with this show not because of pointless spectacular cgi like this, that was basically nonexistent in season 1. I fell in love with the incredibly rich and complex story, the likes of which i had never seen before. Now the story is pretty simple and straightforward, and terribly predictable, and instead of putting effort into the story, the very soul and heart of every show/book/movie, they give us pointless shit lile this.
I didn't even know the bear was a zombie until right now, thought it was just a strange Westeros beast (which anyway it was) now I don't know if I should feel dumb or if I should just blame the directing because this episode must be the most unfocused of the series (like with the bunch of characters dying that weren't even shown before their deaths)
Can someone address why Kit always has white gunk in his hair in those interview scenes? lol
Your name is Toby ! :)
can't believe Thoros died for this shit
literally nobody gave a shit about the zombie polar bear and you guys are still trying to hype it up... waste of budget :(
DnD just seem like idiots, mostly all the fanbase want ghost to have a more prominent role but no, ZOMBIE POLAR BEAR COS WERE IDIOTS WHO LIKE SEEING SPLOSIONS AND FOIRE
They wasted an episode worth of money on a fucking bear.
What a fucking shitty scene that nobody wanted.
I don't think any of you really like Ghost, you are only here to use him to feel cool and accepted on the internet. No offense to people who really do like him
honestly such a waste of budget
No more shirts and trousers and jackets? RLY?!\nThank You! Thank You from the bottom of my heart!
What do you people want Ghost to do? I wants Ghost for what? Just to walk around? Only few episodes left I rather see the main struggle and such than a diré wolf. Wait for rr to write about Ghost.
I guess they dont film everything on location
Guys, the zombie polar bear wasn't just for the theatrics, it was to give a hint to the audience that animals too can be turned into wights, foreshadowing what happened with Viserion.
It was pretty weird, to be honest. -Rory McCann and many GoT fans
Common sense: Why don't you do Ice Spiders as big as hounds? The things that have had multiple mentions throughout the show.\n\nD&D: Nah, just do a random fucking polar bear.
so the polar bear was idubbbz
That polar bear is taking revenge for REVENANT
bear was unnecessary, Where's Ghost? :K
Funny how much they hype this bear but nobody watching really gave a shit
GoT was my favourite show ever and this season ruined it. Thanks to the lazy writing, plot holes and general stupidity and carelessness of DnD. Ruining something so good takes a special kind of stupidity. And you guys proved to have it in spades.
Smh guess I'll watch the episode again!
Any one else think that in season 8, bran is going to tell Jon about how the night king was created and Jon is going to order them to  make him into one in order to stop the NK. Jon will do anything to stop the night king, and if that means giving up his life to save his family and westeros, he'll do it. I don't know what will happen to daenerys but she's for sure going to die some way.
Twd should do something like this a zombie animal
all that effort for something so fucking unnessary
Should have used the money on writing!
this scene was so confusing to watch honestly I couldn't really follow it the first time I saw the episode I didn't know what was going on
Why are these mini documentaries behind a paywall?? Just upload it to YouTube for fucks sake.
Game of thrones is fucking gay
I think that title needs more grammatical errors
That's right. I stabbed it on the head while it's on fire
And, yet, it would get the shit kicked out of it by a zombie gorilla
It was the blurst of times.
Head too welove_gameofthrones on Instagram to receive funny memes and theories on game of thrones and it's upcoming season 8 🐺🔥❄️
One of the worst parts of the worst episode of last season. Great use of money guys.
Is that a remix of lollipop.
Why do people think ghost is dead, if we've learned one thing from game of thrones it is that you have to see something die before you know it's dead, and we haven't seen ghost die. Last we saw him was when jon was brought back to life
People watch this still?
Behind the scenes on how to waste budget
i was very disappointed with this season, i was hoping that the 7th season was going to be the season we were finally going to see Arya in a very graphic sex scene, and seeing her coming across all those Lannister soldiers thought that, that might of been the moment where it was going to happen.
Damn if only all the effort that went into animating the CGI bear went into the actual writing.....
A zombie polar bear? How is this related to, let's say, dragons and all that from ancient history?
as soon as they deviated from the novel I instantly lost all interest
So they swapped Ghost for a\n\n\nMotherfucking corpse of a polar bear?
These scene was very memorable, because that bear was truly terrifying! Cheers HBO one of my favorite moments of Season 7!
Rory the cutest!
#GOTin2018not2019
Dont get me wrong, i love GoT. But how the fuck is a video with 100k views and 3.5k likes is on trending again?
I really enjoyed season 7 overall, but a zombie polar bear sounds a lot more interesting on paper than it actually is to watch. By far the biggest moment of man, what happened to this show? I experienced in any of the seven episodes.
that polar bear scene was a waste of money and time in my opinion
Oh dam Toby lol
Thanks, HBO! From occupied Russia.
This saddens me...
or or or MAN BEAR PIG
basically, we're all effed
🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺🐺
💩💩💩💩🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩
Waste. Of. Budget. (HBO)
DEAD SHOW LUL
wheres my main direwolf ghost!??!?!
who is Ghost?
yer names Toby
Fear toby the zombie bear
Somebody keep Ralph away
Well.Written.Complex.Characters.
We need zombie children
Toby deserves an Emmy!!

Ghost!
When is season 8 😳😭😭
The Hound and Tormund = Best Companions
People are seriously upset with this? Geez, there's no pleasing anyone these days
You guys whine more than 13 year old girls
Any critics of Game of Thrones now; I suggest you go write something 10+Million people are watching , stealing to watch, buying series of the books, making multiple You Tube channels on the topics of the HBO series just about what you write. TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .
I've never seen this show in my life, is it good?
I lost it at the Gemma Collins part. 😂
U should put poppy in every vlog xx
the way you edited the aquariam part made me feel like a mermaid

I really hope this doesn't come across as patronising because I really don't mean it to but can I just say how fucking amazing it is to see you out the flat so much recently and especially getting out to see friends. As someone who suffers from anxiety and depression I know how hard it is to even leave the house, I struggle to even take my daughter to nursery most days without feeling sick at the thought. I'm proud of you for even your little trips to the beach to read or sit and think. Hope your doing well babes, you really seem to be getting there with things and I know it doesn't mean you are but I hope you are. Love you loads xxxx

Thought  your new gold cabinet was suppose to come in September?
Poppy is like so fuckin hot
I need this in and around my mouth.
The amount of puns in the comments today is Nuts
It looks amazing but I don't want to think of how many calories is in a ice cream scoop of nut butter lol
I have to say, with all the ads we are bombarded by on a daily basis, you guys do sponsored videos the right way! No random product placement, just you guys teaming up with food related companies or using their machines to make otherwise normal recipes. It doesn't take anything away from the experience of watching you all and I am thankful & grateful for it.\n\nMuch love from Canada <3
Almond butter, oats, maple syrup, blueberries and coconut oil.. My almost everyday breakfast. Btw, I process the almonds more for thinner consistency. Peanuts doesn’t take much processing as compare to almonds. Good job guys you never fail to make the food better. 👌
It’s not porridge it’s broke guys
Where is the sprig of mint? 😅
Hmmm has baz got some new ink
Can you use other nuts
Is breakfast truly the most important meal of the day? As far as I know it's just a myth promoted by the likes of cereal brands and whatnot. Obviously you need to eat and technically the first meal of the day would be breakfast no matter what, but you don't need to do it the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning.
wow I JUST NEED THIS NOW
Usually I don't notice the music but today's was a bit 70's porn.  I'd ditch that track from your lineup ;)
Can I have a bit?
Are almonds and peanuts the same thing
I haven’t watched sorted food for a while ❤️ugh miss you guys
Yeah the almond butter could have had another 5-10 minutes of blending... Adding the maple syrup would have caused the nut paste to seize up because a water-based liquid is being added to an oil-based nut butter! Still looks absolutely delicious though!
California is the main place that produces almonds , California has also been going through a major drought , almond farmers dig deep into the ground to pump water from resvoirs , which messes up the grounds infrastructure , can cause landslides , even earthquake s.\nProducing 1 almond takes 5 litres of water this is nothing compared to cows milk it  takes 100litres of water to produce 1 100ml of milk, and the torture that goes along with animal cruelty, as bad milk production  is , the  production around the world, unlike almond production, also bees are affected in the process of almond farming, when pollination season starts bees pollinate almond plants , but because of the highly used pesticides this harms the bees , killing colonies, although the use of pesticides has been reduced in polination season, not harming bees as much!  🐝

Breakfast isn't the most important meal of the day. What makes you think that?
That wiggly head movement before Ben says Sorted!
Nice work there!!! But always wonder if you guys always eat as FANCY as you guys always do on SORTED KITCHEN! So comes the idea of taking footage of what you guys eat regularly in your everyday life. can be a self-taken or randomly visited by a fellow sorted member-taken footage. Want to see at least a small portion of what you cook and eat everyday!! Keep up the good work!!
@SORTEDfood could I make sunflower butter the same way you guys have made it?
Nut butter something you can whip up in just about 10 mins ;)
My only issue is that looks to be about 1,000 calories worth of almond butter lol
SortedFood u guys shuld do a show featuring each one of ur familys one by one n making their favorite food.\nHit like if u agree
But can this be made on a windy night in Stoke?
Love it, but damn. Those calories in one whole ice cream scoop of almond butter.
Never thought to put almond butter on my oatmeal
How long would it last for in a jar? does it need to be stored in a fridge?
My fav kind of breakfast!! Luv from S.E.A<3
That looks sooooo good... have you guys ever done savory oatmeal?

Guys....as much as I love nut butters, that's a lot for a single serving. Yes it's high in protein, yes it's a good source of fiber, yes its a good source  of healthy fats, but IT'S STILL FAT GUYS. 1 tablespoon (recommended serving) is 16g of fat! (Which to put it into perspective, recommended fat intake on a 2000 calorie diet is approx 44-78 g)
I always cook oatmeal/porridge with water. 😀😀😀
Barry with the everchanging hair
@sortedfood Can you make different dishes that is made out of edible flowers, pretty please.
I use honey over maple syrup because you get the pollen from the local flowers that helps your body fight allergies and it tastes awesome.
Challenge, gentlemen: for one of the ultimate battles, set a price limit and make the boys buy aaaaaalll their own ingredients - including spices, oils, herbs and all the other staples that kitchens normally already have. (Mostly I just think it'd be funny because you *know* they'll forget something.)
I haven't counted but this product has been out of stock for months! Every one of these made better videos gets me in the mood to buy a new food processor but then I can't follow the link to purchase it :(
I love your videos, keep them coming.  You should have yiur own show !  You have fantastic music playing in the background.  Where do you get it from?
I am definitely going to try this!! ❤❤❤ .. Thanks Boys
Makes me wish I wasn't allergic to almond s
Why do I feel this is James's recipe or the porridge is at least
Barry's hair looks like chocolate butter cream
this is how you up your butter game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQuWF6l1Zkw (Chefsteps pistachio butter)
Not as good as the Kellogg's videos.
Woohoo Scottish porridge 😊 I make it every day with water, dash of milk and salt. Also I make it far thicker just like my Gran taught me. Pour cold milk on the hot porridge in your bowl and it's even better. Yum!
I use this near exact recipe for almond butter myself but I blend intermittently. Yes it is a little bit of a hassle stopping-and-starting the blender (but this helps to avoid overheating if your blender is older/cheaper etc) but, taking the time between blends to move the nut butter manually (as it will start to stick to the sides and remain thick) helps to give you a gorgeous smooth and glossy butter which can be spooned with ease into a jar or container of your choice!
Gotta love Barry's t-shirt. \nI have sold many of those (the brand Henri Lloyd). \n\nBrownie point to Barry! :D
And I thought that was chocolate ice-cream for breakfast! :P
What if you're allergic to almonds? 😂
Can you use any type of butter, like it definitely doesn’t h a v e to be almonds correct?
Slow release of oats 🤔 😂 think you mean 'energy' Ben?
Erm I always make porridge with water...doesn't burn as easily and I focus on adding yummy flavours to it once ready
I'm craving this now
Anyone cringe when he says sorted when he's finished cooking, my skin crawls
Who saw a while u were sleeping ad?
Is there a way to make waffles without a waffle machine?
Roasting the oats before making the porridge brings out some wonderfull flavors. Roasting aka baking it quickly in a dry pan before adding your liquid
How much?\nAn awful lot.
Could y'all do some recipe for canning? I love to can and a creative recipe would be greay
I don't understand why y'all didn't say it has healthy fats. That's literally the most significant attribute of nuts
IT'S VEGAN!! THANKYOU I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY
Looks absolutely delicious boys. So here's another one for the vegans and vegetarians! Personally, I'm a carnivore but I would certainly eat that! Another excellent recipe!! 😘😘
YASSSSSSS ON THE VEGAN RECIPE!! So much love and thanks for this! 🌱
well it's dinner time and all i want to eat is this.
There is a difference between chopped and slivered.  That dish looked good.
That looked marvelous, must give this a go. Almond is the only nut that I like.
i always add pomegranates in my oats! <3
hey ben say meow have you try the french quebecor from canada called poutine of any type like you can make chicken poutine and the regular poutine is made with french fries and cheese and barbacue sauce  and if you want you put any type of meat in it
It looks like ice cream
Porridge without milk? I'm sceptical but I trust you guys!
This looks delicious. As someone who always has oatmeal for breakfast this is something I'll definitely try. However, if you don't like nuts / almonds try mixing in blueberries when the oatmeal is cooking or simply eat it with almond milk and lingonberries. it's delicious.
Isn't that 'porridge' technically gruel as I am almost certain gruel is oats and water made in the same way porridge is? I'm not hating, I'm just saying.
I'd love to know the macros for this.
So could this be a substitute for peanut butter in your other recipes? I have a bad reaction to peanuts but tree nuts (including almonds) are fine ^^
ben thats not pulsing thats blending/processing
MashAllah
Porridge for champions!
love this!!
looks good!
Tomorrow's breakfast - sorted!
Does Tyrone like almond butter Ben?
Banoodle
Comfort food for breakfast.
My mouth is watering!!! <3
BEN NO SPRIG! NO MINT BEN!!!
Heheh, Nut butter.   (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Sorted food ❤❤❤❤💝💝💝
oh yummm
yum!!! that scoop of almond butter looks like chocolate icecream
You roast the almonds to bring out the oils to make it easier to blend. I definitely don't think you need to add maple syrup or coconut oil to the almonds, but that's just me.\n\nHere's a thought though, what other nut butters really work? Almond butter is already awesome and indulgent, so what would macadamia butter be like?
Barry: Presentation is everything *places the almond butter off center *
Yay vegan, tasty stuff! More, please =D
OMG I REMEMBER THIS FUCKING CHANNEL! USED TO WATCH THESE GUYS BUT I DID NOT HAVE A YOUTUBE ACCOUNT TO SUBSCRIBE AT THE TIME (Back in the days) BUT NOW I HAVE AND HAVE BEEN FOR AWHILE SO WELL SUBCRIBED I AM
Hey guys! I'm interested in making this I was just wondering how long it will keep once it's been made and stored
Ten minutes?!?! My porrige takes like thirty seconds....
Great recipe lads. Is this considered part of Sauce Week? I can never really tell with the Kenwood videos lol
holy crap that's a big scoop of nut butter!! :o
Something definitely seems fishy about all of this. This has inside job written all over it
This could be like that movie shooter ! Gov set uo
No rime or reason to this madness. Whatever his motives were he took along with him.
Where in the world can you find mass shooting become a regular occurence? Almost all shooters were white. But no one blamed their white families. Now you have a white shooter with a non-american, non-white girlfriend who is on the other side of the world when it happened and yet her photo is everywhere like she was the one holding the gun. Hmm.. something is NOT right.
He wasn't alone in that hotel room. Media is hush about this
There's no shortage of conspiracy fuckwits posting in the comments. Sad.
Weapons aren't the problem. There is very manipulative, smart, evil people out there who will go through any means necessary to kill a large amount of people for no real reason at all.. Most people who do mass shootings like this are patient and they plan ahead, if we were to SOMEHOW stop EVERYONE from getting hands on a automatic rifle then these crazy people will just learn how to make Bombs to kill people instead. Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\n\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.
That is pretty weird that multi millionaire would go on a shooting spree so randomly
Excuse me but I need to puke!! 😷 This makes me very sick.
NO! The CIA did
What a time to live in.
How sad! My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. I knew some people and celebrities who attended the Life Is Beautiful Music Festival. Scary to think what he may have had planned for that Music Festival.
The type of people who used to rant about Pizza Gate now have a lot of theories about the Vegas shooting.
if we don’t change gun regulation laws. this will only get worse.
I think there was more than one shooter. Always will
Comments on videos like this remind how stupid so many people are
On 4chan weeks before the shooting an anonymous person warned against a big attack in Las Vegas. This man is a patsy. No motive because he wasn't motivated. He somehow carried 20 guns into a hotel room by himself. Many say there were two shooters. He was probably a gun runner and got used as a patsy, killed before the shooting ever took place. Look it up.
This title is annoying😂😂
stop referring to this terrorist as the gunman he is a terrorist say it a radical white terrorists
White policeman's jobs and not hard you're never in danger. When all your job is to do is shoot down black people you're not human
Who chooses these events next to buildings like that how do you not see that as a security nightmare
the woman knows something  Hould her  till u get the true form her
My heart goes out to those in Vegas
The Shooter is dead, just drop the investigation, you will get nothing but wasted time
As I read on Moore and more I think we might need more of these shootings just to bring the stupid lvl back to tolerable.
Wait the title of the video doesn’t connect to the video
Living a secret life... \n\nSo privacy is secret now??
The patsy was a likely innocent too. If you don't say this was a false flag you are either lying or you're an idiot.
This is MSM trying to make the bullshit somehow more plausible. Consservative type guy, owns 20+ guns attacking a country music festival? He really doesn't seem the type to be targetting the patriottic White people associated with country music festivals. Things don't add up in the slightest. Then there's the report of a woman that got carried away harrassing people saying you're all going to die. Why aren't we hearing more of that? Have they found this (apparently hispanic) couple thatt said that yet?  I think this is a massive false flag or cover up. Someone from a (((protected group))) targeted White Americans in the most savage way and they don't want to deal with the backlash of people realizing where it came from ad what goes behind all that. Some Antifa J$w or Black guy. They then framed some old White guy they had scoped out. This is speculation. Of course. But it seems more plausible than what is being told. Look at the Lavon affair.
I encourage those interested in this event to evaluate: is it real? Are we being presented with a fictional reality TV event? \nHow would you know? You could watch the interviews with witnesses, survivors, and victims' families closely. Are their actions and behaviors indicative of real people showing real grief and emotion...or do they appear as bad actors repeating a script?
Don't let them take your guns
what if he wasnt the guy who did it, someone else did it and put his body in the room. \n\n\n\nmaybe i have been watching too many movie
47 FIREARMS !!! Are you kidding me ?!?!\nAnd people kept saying strict gun law doesnt help, well, obvious it's not strict at all if he can get so many guns.
He wasn't planning to attack previously, he was preforming recon. Looking for thing he may miss such as will this camera give me the proper view through these locations. How clear are my shots? What barriers do I have? Guy was rich, was too easy for him to pull it off. Learn from that.
If this man was a Mexican Mass Murderer it would  open season on Latinos for all the  ignorant white vile racists, it would be like  the wild wild west! But this will probably never happen because 80% of mass murderers are white!
Im just confused how a bunch of weapons went through a hotel security Like how does that happen?\nnext time someone gonna bring a elephant into there
This is click bait they didn't even mention anything about a different attack
of couse he did uou think he thought he was gettinv out alive
OH MY GOD I WAS AT LOLLAPOOZA IN CHICAGO AND THAT WAS A TARGET
Is everyone still talking about this? Last week news.
RIP to the shooter
They need to stop making these vids to keep this alive
Gun control worked out great for the American Indians, don't you think? Just lay down your weapons and we'll take care of you!
She knows. Do you really think a woman who just found out that her loved one killed 59 people and wounded over 500 would say: He was a very loving person. Really? She should be disgusted and wished she never met him. However, she's praising how nice of a guy he was. Sure, I bet your conscious is clean with the 120,000 sent to you for hush money.
Why would she go to the phillipeens right before this Attack
Rip to all the people that died
why are we still talking about this? keeping you trapped  in fear
Why haven't we actually seen  her any one can pretend some one told them to say something any one can sit on a wheel chair with a hat and shades covering your face...
You know youtube is insane when they put friggin Aljazeera #4 on trending
Democrats last attempt to win the elections coming up, needed to start a fight about gun control, now their is clear sides, you are either for guns or not! The democrats knew they would lose in a landslide if a controversy was not brought up!
So sad the lives lost !
It was because he got framed
Does it matter now?
Fake news. Stop the speculation and report the facts.
Why is a terrorist news channel trending ? Just more proof that Youtube is completely biased towards Democrat causes and fakes the whole trending thing. It's not an algorithm, it's the extreme leftists at Youtube manipulating views, likes and your perceptions.
No but his brother did.
God forbid but imagine if he had a Gernade launcher or other explosives
I'm still waiting on the footage of him checking in the hotel and walking around the casino to see if he had with anybody else (accomplice) with him.. there's no way he could have done this completely on his own
Sad to say... This topic will blow over in 2 weeks and we'll be talking about the kardashians again
This channel is liberal propaganda
I gained 2 IQ watching this and lost about 5 after reading the comments and an addition 5 pressing view all replies. -.-

Bullshit,  fake news
No.
Nipples
Calling this a false flag is so incredibly disrespectful to the friends and family members of those who were killed in this terrible event
Ask the CIA, they know..
at least he targeted a country music concert
I BELIEVE THAT MORE THAN ONE PERSON WAS INVOLVED IN THIS MASSACRE, IF THIS IS TRUE THEN MR PADDOCK'S DEATH WAS PLANNED TO TAKE THR FALL.
wait! Isn't Al Jazera the terrorists main channel for getting their message out? Why is this allowed on YouTube?
Way to good statement I know philipinos don't talk the way that lawyer talked
Chance the rapper concert??all he does is help others tho!!
a 64 yearold man didnt carry 20k rounds of ammo and weapons up to his floor. plus one of his mental issues where from mk ultra. how i know? because various peoole who have been put threw it also had same issues.
Conspiracy theories are simply a way for mouth breathing retards to feel like they're smart.
Maybe the guy was annoyed by the music and started to kill everyone! Maybe he likes rock
He was white . that's enough explanation
He was a terrorist and terrorized people.  Why dismiss the fear he created by calling him a gunman? It's like saying the victims were just in the way of the path of his bullets.  Both are wrong.
WHERE IS THE HOTEL SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE? WHY HASN'T IT BEEN RELEASED?
Am i the only one who feels like if the ChromeOS is perfected and can run Android apps smoothly then Windows is in trouble?
Always some compromise or another. Missing SD card slot and too powerful (yes) CPU. The Acer Chromebook R13 get +12h worth of battery life with a Mediatek ARM CPU. It's powerful enough for Chrome OS. The Samsung Chromebook Plus is half the price (but is unfortunately not sold in many regions) and still carries a stylus, can be used as a tablet, etc.
If it can't run Adobe,\nthen it ain't fo me.
Great product your presentation is fantastic just the perfect balance between facts and your expert opinion.
Can anyone plz tell me that, whether a video editor can be installed on the pixelbook... like final cut pro or similar software
Why use an x86 processor? If you want the best combination of power and efficiency, then ARM is the way to go.
I think the reason why Google chose to do this is because this is their way of revamping the Pixel C and the Chromebook Pixel 2 in one product. That price though. $1,650 for the maxed out model. The second option of the base Macbook costs $1,599.00.
I have sold countless laptops and the biggest question to ask yourself when trying to understand a product before selling it is: who would buy this and why? I have not come up with any answers for this laptop other than: an idiot and because they’re stupid. i5/128gb for $1000? It must have great design and build quality then! Oh wait nvm look at those huge bezels and chrome OS? What a joke.
No multitasking with an i7 and 16 gb or ram? Lmao...
Too wide of a bezel for laptops in 2017, and a pretty much useless kind of laptop that revolves around the world of Google Chrome browser alone. Remix OS (which is an Android-based desktop computing OS) is still way better than Chrome OS. Not gonna compare this to Windows because that would be unfair. Chrome OS does not even beat a laptop operating on Windows Vista.
About as useless as an iPad is. There's no reason to have a fast desktop-class processor just so you can run dumbed down mobile apps designed for fat fingers.
It's great... for a Chromebook.
The design is wow! It's better than pixel 2 design. But.... Still I think not good for most people from inside
$99 on a pen! B R U H
Beautiful laptop, but sad is runs Chrome OS.
if your 2k$ pc don't run all games due to odd software, PASS!
The Surface Pro keyboard is 1.3 mm travel...
WHY?! Why not throw windows on it. I would throw my money at google. Stop pusing chrome OS, its for emerging markets and low end laptops, not a powerhouse laptop like this.
Not useful if it's not windows 10
Anyone know where to find that wave desktop wallpaper?
you can get a good ass pc for half the price, but whatever
Now that I've finally found a lightweight windows machine, I very recently started hunting for a Chromebook, once again. \n\nThis machine evidently looks to have excelled in all the areas the Samsung Pro failed, all except for one, ironically, its power.\nWhy couldn't google release a core M chip variant, after all the different notebooks and hybrids that have successfully incorporated the 6th and 7th gen core M's? Going with a core M would have captured so much more of the market, and even as a Linux user, via crouton, I'd have been very happy with as low as an M3, never mind an M5 or 7.\n\nI understand this is following suit of the Pixel Line(As fuzzy a line as it may be), but the fan-less trail blazers that are the Core M chips have come a long way since 2015, and I can't imagine why, as a bottom tier device, the core M wouldn't have sufficed. \n\nIt's incredibly frustrating how this looks to be so much of what I, and as I imagine a lot of other people, loved about the Flip C302 and the Samsung Pro, all thrown together into one expensive device.
Can I install Linux on it?
somebody plz help, why are ppl or companies buying chrome books? particularly, ones that are more than a real laptop... do these ppl know that chromebooks cant do anything their phone cant? or can chromebooks do something? I honesty want to understand.
99 more dollars for a stupid stylus I'm mostly going to loose lmao
This would only be good to buy if you want to use it as a linux machine
It is pretty, I'll give them that.
But how are these apps developed? Certainly not on a Chromebook.
Those bezels and that price tag lmao this is garbage
Microsoft working hard to release its apps to chrome OS and Google does nothing to bring its apps to Windows 10 store
There are no Fans.....so I guess it'll fry in a year tops
Suddenly, MS Surface Laptop seems more attractive now....
You'd be better of with the Lenovo yoga book 10.1
Google can't mine your personal files/data if you have an SD card slot silly >_>
Not worth spending $1000 on a laptop that runs chrome os.
Why  not  put a core i3 8th gen CPU and reduced to price to $500

Guys, you're missing the potential. This would make a great Linux machine.
you know it'd be cool if they can help chrome os with installing programs like iTunes, files, etc... then chromebooks would be way more worth it.
Thats a lot of money for a tablet
so it's like a MacBook Air, but with a better resolution and a touch screen
So was this a sponsored video
I'd only buy this to run Windows. Those specs (and the price it brings with it) are too much for a Chromebook.
Nah just get ‘Asus Chromebook Flip c100’ just the same but smaller and different specs , why tf do you need specs on chrome os
Yes but for a 1000 dollars you can get a used MacBook Pro retina i7 or a new iPad Air Pro with Pro motion display plus accessories.
I have a 5 year old i7 Lenovo Yoga, this design is 5 years late LMAO
Someone please tell me, why get this instead of a laptop
It's a  5 watt Core i7, the one Intel rebranded Core M to, so not really eyebrow raising to have no fan.
wtf are those bezels lmao what year is it again?
Them bezzels are THICCK AF!!

Woow look asesome!

lol what the hell was google thinking with this. Chrome OS is so limited to what you can do.
a macbook pro made by google with a touch screen instead of a touch bar.  similar price, similar specs, etc.  this is all up to taste.  mac’s have the large track pad, but this has a better keyboard it sounds like.  mac os vs chrome book software.  both are going to have a port problem as well, which they really didn’t emphasize here when compared to the macbook pro review.
The price of this thing makes me realize how expensive iPhone X is.
Is it possible to download this version of ChromeOS and run it i a VM?
Can you play Assassin's Creed Origins on this ?
They need to add more content on its shop.

It is a sad thing indeed to see such an undeveloped OS and this beauty. I'm a huge fan of Google's work in general and I'm sincerely hoping they will invest time and money into actually developing the entire experience of using the Chromebook.
Im liking it. But not for that 1000.  They arent Apple
I hope it is possible to change os.. Go for windows or linux distros.
I wish Chrome OS could run Unity/Unreal, android studio for apps, photo editor such as Affinity Photo(A real photoshop killer) and a good Video editor.
It's sounds amazing....\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...but it's a chromebook
chrome os is bacically windows mobile in their respective market and I dont think it will take off. Mac os and windows are already wayy too far ahead.
Can we see the operating system?
Why all tech companies are coping each other when they can do something better.
This is on trending but idubbbz isn’t??
Please do not review anything again.
I've had a Chromebook for a year, and I'll be selling it soon. I've had it for some academic work, and it has proven great for that. I like having docs and my drive all easily accessible, but I often find myself frustrated with simple issues. I have a more powerful Chromebook, with decent RAM and a good processor, yet many tasks it can sometimes struggle with.\n\nI miss being simply able to open certain files on Windows. I will be selling my Chromebook, because even with Android Apps, it is not good enough. They are cheap, and if you need something simply to browse the web... get a Chromebook. But if you need anything more, forget it. This Pixelbook, as nice as it is, is too expensive for the lack of functionality.
that screen looks so bad...
It's a message to software developers. It's saying make something proper for Chrome OS, this ain't kindergarten no more.
Almost every comment here is from people too stupid to know how to run Linux, so of course they don't understand the price and specs. Chrome OS is not a browser. It is Linux based OS that chooses to display programs in browser windows because that is where 99% of computer users spend 99% of their time. The only thing I am disappointed about is the lack of discussion about future plans to fully support VMs natively in chrome OS.
People complain about chrome OS until they realise they can run Ubuntu on it simultaneously, as if it was a chrome app
Why is a legit tech reviewer making something so impractical, expensive pretentious device seem so good?
For the same price range you could get the Asus UX370UA, which is also a transformer laptop with touch screen and a pen. Of course it also has WINDOWS 10.
Google should create an Android desktop version like the remix os team tried and ship it with this instead of a browser OS i don't get it
So annoying, you're just about to draw then the camera changes. Just wanna see the responsiveness -_-
Don't need i5 or i7 running ChromeOS. 8 GB ram makes sense.
Technology was made to be made cheap for everyone, not expensive for rich spoiled kids
I wanna buy this and install Windows or Fedora on it ... hahaha
personally, if I had a thousand bucks I would rather buy a razor laptop
I would've totally bought this IF IT HAD SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS.
the use of small letters on the key caps kinda make it looks cooler.
Wait i have no idea about chromebooks and stuff and isn't this like surface pro? And their prices are similar
If all you do is browse the internet, watch videos, use social media, etc. then I highly recommend getting a Chromebook.
Whew, that thing is sexy.
In Summary: NO
Pixelbook is a bad joke. -_-
Simply gorgeous design.

I was going to buy this because my eyebrows are so thick and dark (even though I have dirty blonde hair naturally) that most days I just want a tiny bit of colour to define them, but then I remembered maybelline aren't cruelty free, damn
how did they decide that shade range was a good idea?! of course everyone has warm toned brown hair! good job maybelline 😂

I used this in dark brown and after a day my brows started turning orange really bad 👎
Hey Guys! This Is Brilliant! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 ℙ𝕊ℕ ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Getyourgiftcardnow2017
men have better faces why we dont put junk on them you do if you did not you would not need make up
Oh dear, that was a disaster. Before you started your brows matched your hair perfectly. Now the effect is halfway to clown. Don't ever do that - send Maybelline back their desperate box of stuff.
This is the first video of yours that I've watched, so I have no knowledge of how your eyebrows usually look, so I actually really like this colour on you.
Would suit me, got auburn hair tee hee
Almost on 500K xx

15 on trending! Yaaaaaas Sophie
The longer you leave the stain on the darker it gets for a fade do the majority of your brow wait 5 to 10 minutes then fill in the front
You are a very sweet naterual girl with or without makeup 🙄
idk what it is but there's something about your videos that is SO ADDICTING. i can't get enough
Well done for getting #5 on trending Soph!!
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
#5 on trending - well done lovely <3
Not medium brown. Dark red. Maybelline puhlease
beautiful
cant wait to come back from florida so i can buy your makeup
This would be so good for beach vacations
I love u so so much
They seem to work great but the color selection is crap! They need to make more neutral or cool tone ones for sure. You still look amazing even with red eyebrows though haha :)
Can’t believe they don’t have a blonde shade. No good for me then as my eyebrows are very fair
Love your nails!!! First time watching your videos and didnt even know you do nails
You remind me of a mix between Britt Roberts and Sabrina Carpenter 😍
with the tint still on you look like every girl at my school who tries to fill in their eyebrows
You still suit dark brows soph, rock the dark brows ✌🏻
I used this product a week ago and it turned my eyebrow ginger. They are currently still ginger and I've been scrubbing for ages oml help
Aww I feel so bad for you! I messed it up but it did come off ok with miscellar water xx
I think you may have got a dud as I bought the light brown today and it wasn't red at all!😳
Man u look like zara Larson from the thumb nail 😂
You are fucking dumb why the fuck would you tattoo your browslike this
Dont know if u read comments but i think someone has used ur video to show off brush that aren't their here the link https://www.facebook.com/officialteenfashionstore/videos/923772494466050/
I do want to try this. Love it soph x
I don’t understand why maybelline are bothering to copy etude house. It’s just a bit silly.
ur literally so pretty. and ur hair looks so nice.and i love ur back ground
When are brands going to start making brow products for true ginger hair? Even the couple of products on the market in 'auburn' are way too dark?????? At least maybelline have gotten a bit closer with this one, even if it was by accident.
So you have to let it sit for 20 minutes and that isn't even for it to last the full 3 days?? No thanks, maybelline. \nAlso omg they're literally red 😂 but watching you peel them off was to satisfying
Oh Soph thank you for doing this review because I was going to get the medium shade but after watching this video I think I'll possibly get the darker one haha. Lots of love xxx
if they matched your hair they'd look amazing
Your number #5 on trending in the uk Sophie!!
am i the only one who thinks that she look like the girl from the what you see vs what she sees meme
You're on no5 trending in the UK!!! Well done love 😘♥️
My new video is up and my free prize draw has started :-)

I think your brows look fine WITHOUT anything!! Can you do a makeup look using your natural brows?
you and your background are goals😍
Omg these look so good?! Even though the colour was a bit dodge haha 😂
I tried this product and it was fine but came off in the shower on the first day
Hi, could you maybe do a pr unboxing next time you get products??? Xxx

She is looking good. I luv her when she is not drunk and crazy She is a beautiful chick and talented singer
TT out here looking like the 2005 TT, SLAYYYYYY boo yasssss.
She's so pretty 💕
she looks soo good, keep working hard gir !
Teirra has been around for a long time, she's not just from love and hip hop @comments
No shade but are they going to get any real Celebrities this season? I don’t know who the last five people have been 🙃🙃
yesss TT 😍😍, I'm really rooting for her
She lowkey looks like Naturi aka Tasha from Power
Looking good teairra 👍
I hope Teairra and Moniece can repair their friendship.
Omg! She look a lil more slim.
She really looks bomb ❤️
every time i see her i think of mac and devin go to high school lmao
Gorgeous!! I miss her music
Y'all wasn't complaining when they had Love and hip hop Atlanta cast members on the show 🤔 it's only a week, stop complaining! She looks great and I'm happy that she was able to get herself together.
She is one of my favs from lhhh
She has lost a lot of weight and looks darn good. You can tell that rehab has help her because she looks very healthy & alert.
NIA AND FIZZ TRYING TO GET THAT CHECK LOL
I felt bad when they did that but I know that they were trying to help. I was an alcoholic myself I just stop myself before going to rehab. I used alcohol to escape from reality. I would only drink on special occasions New Years, my birthday . That's about it.
She’s so gorgeous!
funny how no one talks about the domestic violence  teairra Mari committed when she was beating on ray j multiple times? #DoubleStandards
I liked that Teairra actually spoke during girl chat and interacted with them without them having to call on her everytime. I hate when they have guest host who just sit there and don't say anything.
Some of y'all are just saying who for the likes. Like damn, the woman is opening up about rehab and this is all y'all can say. Foul..
I'm just proud to see two Detroit women on the panel at the same time we go through so much  ladies and to see that reminds me that I can make it out too
I hope she gets a permanent spot on The Real that would be nice platform for her. She is so much more than reality T.V .She is the total package she is commerically beautiful and can sing. JayZ & Def Jam records hung her out the dry over 12 years ago hopes she gets a 2nd chance in the spotlight.
TT great job!  Love her! ❤
She done lost weight and everything yasss!!! Can't wait for the reunion! #loveandhiphop
danm my bae looking so danm good so happy for her team TT
I guess losing to Rihanna really hit her hard. Well, glad she's better!
Good for you teirra on getting help. You look better too.
What type of rehab did she go to? I don't watch love n hip hop.
Love Tierra and she looks beautiful   ☺I'm really routing for her success and happiness because she's so talented and extremely underrated. #itsyourtime
Hasn't changed since the movie Lottery Ticket with Bow Wow.
Put u on a pedestal for wat?
I'm happy you found help 😞
she should have gotten her hair done.but she look pretty
She look like she need to go back she look tired in the face
Why do they have whack ass love and hip hop bitches on this show. Tierra is not worth being a guest on any show. She is trash af
i wish Teairra Mari was on radio.. she's kinda kookoo for cocoa puffs but she has such an amazing voice.\nP.S people who doesn't recognize she most not have grown up in the 90s listening to R&B...
Seriously who are these random chicks?  Am I missing something? I rather they bring someone they've already had.
I just remember her doing the Destiny Child's cover with Rihanna and Amerie. And Beyonce was looking at 'em side ways. I love Amerie, but only one of them from the 3 still relevant...
She looks different and beautiful
I still listen to her first (and only?) album.
Her teeth look different, is it just me?
Y’all we need to give a big shout out to her her best friend moience for pushing Tierra to go to rehab
I remember her for being a very pretty pop singer signed to jay-z label.\n\nI next saw her on LHHNY where she was the one trying to stop the other girls from fighting.\n\nThis was crazy to see her acting out on LHHHW I almost felt it was fake. It was like she acted like a completely different girl.\n\nBut I guess was real once you end up in rehab.\n\nGlad to see she doing better.
Tt look like she need a drink no shade.. bad hair day
Stop with the love and hip hop guest
I miss this show today did she  talk about her MUSIC or is we waiting until next season again ????
Lol I thought she was Naturi at first in the thumbnail 🙂💅🏾
Only 59 comments its to early ill come back when swaggpro and glitzygirl around they messy but great
I love her 💙💙💙💙 so proud
What am I supposed to do with these short ass, tiny bity ass clips? I understand you don't wanna lose TV viewers, I understand it's about money, but I live in Switzerland and if it wasnt for youtube I'D NEVER had heard/seen/known the real so can you put some respekk on our names and upload longer clips? Otherwise, I hope YOU understand when we all go back to watching Wendy.
Please don’t turn this into a Love and Hip Hop show
Teaira is my boo 😘❤️😍
Who is this ?
I thought Moniece and Nikki actually cared tho
She had no daddy when she was growing up \nThat's why she  wild and she don't give a f**k
Please Subscribe To Me !

Can you please do a zombie effects makeup look? My homecoming is Friday and the float theme is fall, so we are doing thriller by Michael Jackson! We’re doing the dance and every thing and I’m in charge of special effects makeup. But it seems when I look on Google there aren’t too many options that’ll work for this. I really would love to learn from the Sister of all Sisters because you’re the best! I hope you see this James! I love you and you’ve made my makeup game strong❤️🔥!!!!!
I love this so much! You did such an AMAZING job!
Did anyone else realize that he is not wearing a shirt???
No more Foundation I like your freckles

Ireland > England
Utter shite

Joe is a great character!!
I just watched blade runner and guess what fan boys its over rated
Make a sins video for guradians of the Galaxy 2 and wonder woman already!
Can't wait for an everything wrong with everything wrong with blade runner. Because good lord, i could not get past this stupidity.
Jesus, what a horrible job sinning this movie. \nYou sinned a million times, that the movie is slow and has a lot of scenery shots, which is clearly not a sin, but a choice a can like or dislike, but fail, to sin the most obvious flaws.\nFor example the fact that replicas can grab a eye out of a container full of liquid nitrogen without having any problem at all. Why not just use that to determine, wheater they are replicants or not instead of a complicated test?
this movie kicks all your asses in the face.
subtlety is a word for a reason XDDD
Establishing shots and mood setting are considered sins in a movie???  The man in the portable ramenya is speaking Nihongo at first, but it is never established that he does not speak English, or the city-speak that Gaff uses.  The only sinful part of that scene is why Deckard, a seasoned blade runner would NOT understand city-speak?  When i watched the movie i decided that Deckard was probably just pretending not to understand, giving the police a hard time since he had quit the force.  \n\nIn Dangerous Days, the making of Blade Runner, we learn that director Ridley Scott wanted a LOT of smoke in the film, a LOT of rain, a LOT of shadows.. he did not seem to need a plausible reason for the smoke to be there.  What is actually smoking in that scene with Deckard and Bryant is a small smoke machine sitting on the table between them, covered with what looks like an ancient desk phone with the receiver sitting turned up on the top.  It makes no sense.\n\nWhy complain about the Coke logo?  Coca-cola and Pepsi too have both changed their labels and bottles over time but they also make a point of going back to their original vintage look for their anniversary celebrations, ja ne?  2 years from now in the far future of 2019, Coca cola will be 127 years old so maybe they are just celebrating their birthday!\n\nRoy Batty is almost 4 years old.  He has defeated his programming in order to lead this revolt and his mind is full of data from his military service in the off-world colonies.  So for him to speak like a child when he is not reciting some thing he heard others say IS actually in character for him.  Therefore Batty speaking like a small child OR reciting poetry is NOT a sin.  It makes a lot more sense than the smoke machines every where.\n\nMr. Tyrell absolutely would be expected to have all of the answers, but Mr. Tyrell is also well-protected, so it does make sense that Roy would be trying to find some one else in the corporation who could give them the incept dates and memories they are wanting, especially after failing in their first two attempts to get into the Tyrell corporation The assault that got two of them fried by an electrical grid was the 1st try; the 2nd try was when Leon tried to hire on as a general laborer, which since that was sinned too i should mention makes perfect sense, as many large corporations use 3rd party labor sources who NEVER go through a PR department at all.  Corporations regularly outsource labor for assembly, packing, warehouse, distribution, security, building maintenance... \n\nThe oversize faux fur collar is actually a call back to art deco images of women, depicted with halos, auras and feathered plumes behind them.  It is an intentional film noir aspect that absolutely does belong to cyberpunk genre, which thanks to director James Cameron has actually become known as tech noir - he coined the term as the name of a bar in the first Terminator movie.  Since i mention call backs, i can also point out that the textured patterns in the walls and kitchen of Deckard's apartment are actually taken from an ancient Vincent Price film, the original version of House On Haunted Hill, where the exact pattern can be seen decorating the walls on the building exterior. If you pause at the very beginning of the movie trailer for the 1959 film, the wall decor is very prominently shown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bsa9ymSDoJ0\n( ^_^ )\n\nAmazingly even now as i write this in the year 2017, the Mr. Coffee company is still in business and you can still get a very basic version that looks similar to the one shown in this scene.  2019 is 2 years from now.. having a coffee maker in a kitchen is NOT a cinema sin.\n\nBryant explains when we first see him in his office that the situation with the replicants is NOT going to be an embarrassment because no one is going to hear about it.  The entire point of bringing Deckard out of retirement was to have some one not in the public view to quietly kill the replicants.  So no, NO the replicants are NOT super wanted by the police since only a few people, Inspector Holden, Inspector Gaff and Chief Inspector Bryant are the only ones in the department who know.  It makes sense to keep the embarrassing situation quiet to avoid scaring the public about replicants going rogue and murdering humans.  So that is not a sin.\n\nThe unicorn dream is an implanted memory - some one at the Tyrell corporation thought it would be kewl or lovely for the replicants to dream about a unicorn so they all get it.  The only one who does NOT necessarily dream about unicorns is Rachel who has the implanted memories from Tyrell's niece as n experiment.  Ridley Scott DID admit that Deckard IS a replicant https://www.outerplaces.com/science-fiction/item/9991-ridley-scott-reveals-whether-rick-deckard-is-a-replicant and why it was ever a question when Blade Runner gives us TWO specific hints surprises me.  We are not only shown the dream of the unicorn that Gaff later proves he is aware of, but also there is the scene where we see the SAME orange light in both Rachel AND Deckard's eyes.  Their eyes have the SAME eye shine as the artificial owl in the Tyrell office. \n\nDeckard DID tell the computer which area to center and enhance, the are located at 224 x 176 in the grid overlaying the scanned picture. First he tells it where to look, then he tells it to center the image, and pull back.\n\nEnhance is a famous movie /TV cliche but without any reason for its apparent mockery - any one who has ever taken a picture with a digital camera is aware of all of the filters we have to enhance those images, ways to sharpen, to adjust the color balance, enhance the contrast and color saturation, filters to clarify and smooth yet preserve the edges in an image... people familiar with Paint Shop Pro may even know of the Enhance Photo tool and its one step photo fix button that ENHANCES a picture by applying 6 of the most commonly used filters.  So image enhance.. that is actually a thing.  Stop pretending it isn't.\nThe slide projector styling of the program is presumably in the software - an anachronism yes but again, a completely well-established nuance of modern software.  the digital cameras in our phones by default can make a beep or even a sound LIKE an old reflex camera, the virtual button to save data on a lot of our software in 2017 uses an icon image of a 3.5 floppy diskette as the universal symbol for saving.. even though 3.5 diskettes are incredibly out-dated, and only stored 1.44MB of data, as opposed to our micro-SD cards that can store up to 512GB of data, if you want to spend 1000USD on a single micro-SD card.  So future tech with vintage effects?  NOT a cinema sin.  Even the amount of detail in the image is not necessarily a cinema sin, considering how many megapixel resolution some of our 2017 cameras are capable of.\n\nDeckard is NOT at the fish restaurant.  He is at an artificial animal vendor's shop on what the script refers to as Animal Row where the nice little Cambodian lady agreed to help the kind, good-looking police officer by using the equipment she would regularly be using to identify artificial animals.  She recognizes the work of a local and directs Deckard to his booth.. How was this a cinema sin?\n\nSuper advanced and super dilapidated is just another way of saying high tech low life which IS a standard summation of the entire cyberpunk culture.  Not a cinema sin.\n\nEven in 2017, there are places where people still smoke.  It is a filthy, unhealthy habit, and even though vape tech is available and sporadically affordable, as long as nicotine is involved, it is an unhealthy addictive drug habit.. but sadly and stupidly it IS still legal.  There are even hookah bars in 2017 USA.. doing their best cheap impression of ancient opium dens.  So it is not a cinema sin - just a really stupid thing to do.\n\nBody glitter and body sequins do just wash off in the shower.  and they also clog up the drain.  NO, it does not take hours to apply it, especially if you have no pattern, and she doesn't.  Real boa constrictor in 2017: between 70 and 200USD assuming the species is legal and raised locally.  But the bigger the snake is, the more it costs, and imported snakes can cost 1000USD or more.  The hair dryer looks like vintage 1960's salon equipment, and the room decor looks like it came from a 2nd hand shop and remember this is NOT Zhora's place this is the dressing room at the club - Zhora did not buy any of it.  The bubble hair dryer is intended to be a sensual experience for the audience, and as a lesbian i confess i found it very enjoyable.  \n\nZhora did NOT run down an empty road, she uses a back exit from the club dressing room into a messy alley, then runs directly into busy streets and heavy traffic where she is forced to slow down.  Deckard is a superhuman police officer who does not even know he is artificial, why would he not be able to run as fast as she can?  Stores with window fronts have a lot of glass, not a sin, but i am surprised there was no sin added for the HORRIBLE wig the Zhora stunt double is wearing!?\n\nDeckard drinks but the one time we think he is getting drunk in his apartment is the moment he sits up suddenly sober while looking at the picture on his computer.  In fact it is possible that Deckard CANNOT actually get drunk.  But drinking IS a very standard, cliche film noir detective thing to do.  \n\nPris is NOT using fighting routines - she is using acrobatic dance routines, and then after catching him between her thighs she very clumsily hits him with improperly held fists, then tries sticking her fingers in his nose.. she is not a fighter.  The sin MIGHT have gone to the fact that during the acrobatic tumble we can very clearly see that Pris has become a man. They used a muscular man as her stunt double.. ( o_0 )  Her death scene is a mixture of a doll running its battery down and a 4 year old throwing a temper tantrum.
Halloween’s coming up — could you do Beetlejuice? I’ve requested it a few times, and it’s one of my favorite movies.
Can this channel just please just die.
A lot of people seems pretty triggered by this video, even though it's made by (and I quote from CinemaSins themselves) a bunch of soulless assholes who do not consider themselves as movie reviewers or film critics \nI get that this has a lot of mistakes within it, but you don't need to fanboy/fangirl and write a 10 page essay on why they suck\nSeriously, chill

Do :Who Killed Captain Alex
Just saw the new one, amazing film.
9:29  Star Wars is the same way, bro.
L.A. actually does have oil derricks, they have buildings built around them because everyone agrees they are ugly as hell.
I thought the whole point of the scene where Deckard views the picture was to emphasize it wasn't a photo, it was a future equivalent where extremely high quality images could be stored like pictures and then viewed later with a corresponding machine. But you do you CinemaSins... it's not like we came here for real criticism laced with actually funny jokes! All we want is a load of bullshit topped with tired, reused jokes that were barely funny in the first place.
I just finished watching this movie, this is hilarious!
I think a lot of people missed the point about the 'rape' scene.  You're supposed to think about it.  Is it rape if Rachel is a machine?  Or is she self-aware enough to deserve to be treated like a human being?  And who is the one one acting like a machine without emotions, Rachel or Deckard?  Maybe both.  Gets your brain working.
15:44 He didn't Peirce his hand so it would be a Jesus reference. Maybe it's a nod but he did it because his hand started to close because he is aging so he rewired his hand for it to not do so until he finished the fight.
This movie invented the zoom and enhance cliche.
Wake Up! Its time to die.
also you missed the part about the “candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long” bit which is why he died in 2019 rather than 2020.
Ha ha ha, of all the product logos, I think I liked TDK the most. Ah memories. The best audio tapes money can buy...well, pretty good, at least.
you don't know pimp edward james olmos. gotta watch zoot suit.
Your stuff is funny, but what have you actually produced that other people could tear apart?
you might as well sin Akira now
Those gas fire plumes were, I kid you not, recorded footage from Gary, In.  So... yeah... what the hell was/is up with that city?
It is sad how people overlook the complex thematics of this picture. The focal point of it all is to examine our nature, as well as answer the question of What makes us human? As you see, this line between Humans and Replicants is blurred in the end, as the Replicants form memories and dreams, which are thought to be distinctly human. The film may have a slower pace, but that is what makes it better than say the Matrix...it gives actual characterization and exposition, instead of going for huge explosions and quippy one liners (like the OTHER Harrison Ford movie).\n\nThe aesthetic, soundtrack, acting and story are all seriously overlooked. It is sad people call it boring, because half of the films I have seen as classics ( a la Matrix) have focused more on action than characters. Yet, we want deafing explosions and one liners, because thinking is too hard for us...hence why many downplay this film.
You Don't mess with the Zohan
If Deckard is old in the new 2049, isn’t that enough evidence that he is human 😂. Replicants have a short set lifespan.
Another episode in which Cinema Sins pulls their punches and misses many of the fundamental issues of a deeply flawed film, and the comment section is still full of pretentious turds who whine about how they were too harsh.\n\nCue the zealous teenager brigade.
Nuh, this is wrong. Blade Runner is a masterpiece, and a classic.
1k are replicants and don’t know it.
CW needs to do this classic as CS SUCKS
Everything Wrong With Blade Runner In ONE WORD Or Less....\nNothing.
Okay fuck you  Brendan Frasier is coming back. He has to come back. We need him
I love the Panam reference because they do the same thing with atari in the new one
everything wrong with the matchbreaker
16:40 You forgot the noodle guy who also must be in on it.
I like that you are doing some of the classics. Maybe you should make a separate playlist for them or something.
god i love this movie
Not nearly enough sins. Boring as fuck movie, with over the top acting. Sorry but it's true
Vangelis is not pronounced Van-jell-is, but Van-ghell-is. Soft G, not hard.
Most of these aren't even sins, I don't know if your other sin videos are as irrelevant as this but i would suggest only including actual mistakes lol
I have always thought this movie was slow and boring. Even in the 80s. The new one has to be better
i think there's a scene where we see deckards eyes glow like a replicant, but its reeeeeally subtle because he's in the background while talking to a character (i think rachel) in the foreground
Thanks for mentioning Dark City. Now I need to go watch Dark City.
I think you need to add another sin because only five of the six Replicants in Roy's group were accounted for. Also, it's nice to know I'm not the only one who thinks this movie is as boring as hell.
I've never seen this film, so can someone tell me WHY it needed a sequel?
I could never get through this movie
HOWARD ROARKE DID NOT RAPE DOMINIQUE
Sin Tropic Thunder please!
Well what an asshole
*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldMira*
This was a f**kin' awful movie, I say it deserves double the Sins due to how lazy a director Ridley Scott is.
My husband like to sing along to that song but changes the words to more hamster than hamster...
I request 2001: A Space Odyssey next please.
Glad to see Im not the only one who thinks the visuals are brilliant, but the story is a jumbled mess.
Everything Wrong With Men in Black 2?
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH IT(2017)
Everything Wrong With Transformers:The Last Knight
this whole page is edgier than fuck, video and comments alike
Is a cliche a cliche if the cliche kind of started with this film?
It's amazing how ppl take so much time in finding flaws in movies (some are obvious i know) rather than just watch for the entertainment that it is
The pacing and gloomy shots are to set the tone and atmosphere of the movie. Art is wasted on you.
I just have to say the eagle on the head line nearly made me piss myself
There was nothing wrong with that White Zombie song -_-
EVERYTHING WRONG WITH BABY DRIVER NOW
I don't think zoom and enhance was a cliche in 1982. Otherwise fine. My own view of Blade Runner is that it's held together by some decent visuals and an awesome soundtrack.
My can you sin list\n1.Limitless\n2. 28 days/weeks later\n3.Ali\n4.Straight outta compton\n5.All eyes on me\n6.Rings\n7. George A Romero( Of the dead movies)\n8.Pulse\n9. It\n10.Old Yeller\n11.Mulan\n12.Freddy vs Jason\n13. The grudge 1,2,3\n14 The shawshank redemption\n15.Blow
Let's be honest this movie was fucking trash
2016-2019 IS 4 years, you numpty.
Leon did not kill Holden.
Please do everything wrong with spiderman homecoming!!
Harrison's voice When talking to Joanna Cassidy is a lot like Lawrence Kazdan's voice.
If this is arguably the origin of the zoom and enhance cliche, is it actually a cliche yet? Is it a sin, then? http://know your meme.com/memes/zoom-and-enhance
I was hoping for a Bubblegum Crisis reference, I was disappointed.
No taking off a sin for the tears in the rain bit? That bit was iconic.
TERRIBLE White Zombie song?? Fuck you pal, down vote just for that.
Half of the comments: Its cyberpunk mate don't sin it\nThe other half: OMG RAPE!!!\n\nMe: Isn't this just Fallout: New Vegas, just without nukes?
What about Zhora's body double being a dude when she goes through the glass?
It's not necessary for everyone to be in on it for Deckard to be a replicant.\nThe Deckard template could have been used for multiple replicants in the past, with each one quitting as its expiry date approaches.\n\nThis new Deckard, presumably built using the same tech as Rachel, would then have been given the memories required to believe himself the same person as the previous one, although the new simulated emotions would have meant some notable differences in personality.\n\nHeck, maybe Gaff's the same, and they overlap their replacement schedules so they've only got one on the go at a time -- they might even have made a pact to help each other out in rediscovering the truth after every replacement cycle.
You should make a video about all that is wrong with CINEMASINS and the people working for it...
I'm guessing this is going to be taken down soon with some of those clips audio tracks
Whenever a movie that's universally considered a classic and CS makes a video about it, a lot a butthurt people come out. \nThat's a scientific fact.
Imagine some dudebro sitting in the cinema spending most of the time on his phone but paying just enough attention to make witty comments out loud as if that shit wasn't the most annoying thing to listen to. Cinemasins is the youtube embodiment of that guy.
One of the worst  Everything Wrong With so far. So many lazy sins
That sin counter joke still gets me :))
I haven't watched yet but, HERESY lol
The interview to determine whether one is a replicant or not could be avoided by using a simple x-ray.
Was totally gonna call bullshit if I didn't see a 'Newhart' reference
Yeah, I know that this is the slowest thing ever, but it does make you think about what's been happening so far.
You didn't sin the film's biggest sin: Deckard actually rapes Rachael after the first kiss. She tries to run away and he stops her physically, then strong-arms her into telling him she wants him. With romantic-saxophone music over the whole scene. That's a horrible scene.
After seeing this video, I wonder what will happen in the next two years that in 2019 will be like that it is not exist? The old classic Coca Cola logos, the giant plastic hair dryers, the giant smoke pipelines with fire, the giant temple, and  everything.\n\nGeez, it’s Back to the Future Part II that we thought this future will exist and we wish we wanted to get Nike sneakers without laces on it.\n\nDoc Brown: Why?\n\nAnyways, I’m not a huge fan of Blade Runner and I’m not the only one who thinks this movie is a masterpiece?
at 5 minutes 40 seconds stopped watching, so many grasping at barely there straws sins.
17:13 Shoulda went with OHHH YEAHHHH!
So many of these sins are unwarranted. Super advanced + super dilapidated is the definition of cyberpunk, and Roy toyed with Deckard because he didn't want to kill him, he just wanted Deckard to know what it was like to live in fear, so he could properly understand Roy before he died.
Please do, IT!

Is math related to science?
Wish someone asked a proper question lol
What is that thing he had at the end! That's cool
People need to learn how to ask a question
I'd love to get an answer to my question which is -\nIs the habitable (Goldilocks) zone in propotion to the size or mass of the star?\nIn other words, if a star was 10 times larger than our sun, would the possibilities of life be greater due to a larger habitable zone?
quantum mechanics works in every place we know really?? im pretty sure i heard bryan green discuss how black holes dont obey quantum mechanics because if it did it would violate the rules of thermo dynamics.
Where can i get one of those thermometers?
What is the name of the thermometer at the final?
Is math related to science?
Reality is not what you perceive, it's what the methods and tools of science reveal.\n-Neil deGrasse Tyson
Although I personally disagree with Neil's politics I do quite enjoy his way of presenting science.
1. Theory of relativity 2. atomic bombs, 3 ???? 4. PEACE!!! (finally)
How does gravity exist , its a form of energy and yet it seems to be created from nothing , just the bigger you are the more gravity energy you get for free and its never ending
Is math related to science
The end but with the thermometer was literally more interesting than the rest of the video
What was that in the end  is it going because of the temperature or it because of pressure simple answer isn't name
Screw these Twitter questions I had all the entertainment I need in that tie. DAMN.
I learn so much more from youtube than I do from school.
This guy is a sellout. Fake propaganda actor. World is flat. Really a shame people still think we live on a globe.
i love him,,, so goddamn much
I want to hear Neil try to explain and justify the existence of Jar Jar Binks
It's math related to science?
He doesn't seem to be answering the actual questions, but that does not matter as long as I can hear his beautiful beautiful voice.
Why are there so many bad questions in this video
I have never felt more intellectually inferior than while watching this video.
I have his book!
Quantum physics has worked everywhere we've applied it\nAhem, *VACUUM CATASTROPHE*.
I want this man to narrate my boring life
The Best Person on the World Pouring his Knowledge Onto His Disciples
Why is Neil being asked 4th grade questions???
Don't want to sound like a racist.. but why americans refer to body temperature as 100 degrees ? I feel like boiling at this point.
just get the human out of it\nwiser words have never been spoken
Do you believe in God
Was our sun one of the first stars born or say 2nd generation of stars?
This bitch ass nigga can't dance and can't dunk , why do people think he is smart ?
Lol, bill bye is the next suggested video... lol if we need a mechanical engineer we might call, but you’re not a scientist
Ask a smart man dumb questions would be a better title for this video. So disappointing :(
neil degrasse tyson shoutin out my state! I love that he was here haha
whats the ultimate goal of science?
i didn't understand a thing, but i still liked how he explained them
The tweet at 2:42 is incorrect. Not sure who made the typo, but it's not dark *matter* that makes the universe accelerate, it's dark *energy* . I understand the mix up, just trying to clarify.
This guy is only popular because he makes atheist sinners feel intellectual AND non-racist about themselves.  Wow, a black scientist told me I don't have to believe in God.  Now I can tell all my friends this guy is so smart and that makes me seem non-racist and intelligent.  Fools.
Am I the only one who occasionally gets so caught up in his answer that I forget what the question is
Human error and human bias are not the same.\n\nYou cannot get the human out of the experiments, no matter what. When humans make technology its based off our human funtions. I.e. a cpu is us building a brain, audio or light sensors are versions of our eyes and ears. This is why there is always bias even when we use technology. There is even bias when we read the data or even worse we show bias on how we present the data to others. All technology allows us to do is reproduced results or have less changing variables in our experiments due to human error.
Once Upon a Time I liked Neil, now I see him as the fake he is. Pear shaped earth!? Really!??? It's round if you believe in that shit. He tries to debunk the real by brainwashing. #proflatearth
His tie is amazing
Whats at the end of space?
Isn’t it his birthday today? Oct, 5?
Nefilian was so not asking about world peace.... He or she was asking about gravitational fields and relativity. Signed by a peace. Got a nice sermon though. ^^
Since we're inventing new terms and words to describe quantum phenomena, why do we choose to call it something that will naturally make people think it's strange, or weirder yet: charmed. It's a golden opportunity for going nuts in a childhood-dream here, maing nonsense words and actually have them convey highbrow sense! Come on! A Huitfuit, why not?
Is it true that my pancreas is attracted to every other pancreas in the universe with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the distance between them?
7:40 Yes to the first, no to the second.
@2:41 in the tweet it should have said dark energy not dark matter right?
Neil deGrasse Tyson for President of the U.S.... please.
Neil totally missed the question because weird people use ? to shorten what?. Peace was just the user signing off.
How do I know If I am watching you. And not the other way around?
Is math related to science
The peace question had nothing to do with peace. It just asked about the theory of relativity in relation to gravitational pull.
B L A C K S C I E N C E M A N
In 8:44 I think that neil deGrasse tyson just answered the wrong question
*Is math related later to science*
i love you Neil
You don't experience a proton in your life ... you don't feel it, touch it, taste it ...\n\nWe can taste acidic foods.  Isn't that tasting protons?
Neil is basically your father if your father was a HUGE NERD.
We do experience protons constantly. Hydrogen ions are simply protons. HCl reactions in our stomachs for example
Why do other planets have names for their moons while Earth's is called just moon? Did we name our moon moon first and then generalized it as a term for a heavenly body revolving round a planet?
The tie \nSuch fashion icon
is math related to science?
Fuck that, A Cross The Universe, Justice, Ed Banger for life fuck outta here, your welcome.
cold ambient is always stealing energy from our bodies, but we feel less energetic when its summer and the sun is hitting us hard, giving us energy, right? why?
I've learned both that the universe is expanding at the speed of light and that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Can someone help me with this? 'cuz I'm confused.
But is math related to science?
Are you guys scared of death?
This kinda proves that science is not the answer to why we are here
You guys should just make a twitter account and when the time comes tell us to ask you questions, just saying so you dont use month old tweets.
We need a face-off/team-up of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Jordan Schlansky
SCIENCE BITCHHH - jesse
nice echooooooooo...................
I love thisssss 💓💓💓
Flattt
That tie...
fine.
Dani Yell is my legit neighbor
My names spelled Tysen
Overrated
...yes  😂😂😂 amazing
Neil deGrasse Tyson= 100000x better than bill nye.
DUDE I love your tie
Thank you Neil deGrasse Tyson!
What no flat earthers?
Your awesome
Gotta love that tie!!
Please Neil, use celsius! :D
Loves me some NdGT!
....BUT IT DO
I believe in God.. but i like NDT he’s the 🐏 at whatever he does
Trash!
If we can go to other dimensions to see our entire universe, can we see other universes from our dimension?
BRING TYLER THE CREATOR TO THIS
In Destiny 2 humans were able to inhabit the moon Titan, with tidal heating is this possible???
Chris reminds me of the guy from Inspector Gadget https://youtu.be/8iiYFkvg7OU
god i hope his entire house burns down
CHRIS REMOVE THE CURSE FROM ME RIGHT NOW *I HAVE TO GO TO WORK*
I love how Jessica said it was Chris' fault, yet here Chris is saying It's all the trolls' fault. Amazing how in fucking 2017, he hasn't learned.
I genuinely had a good laugh at this video, thank you!
I love you Christine.\n\nPlease never stop making videos.\n\nOr do a mass shooting, that'd be funny.
Did he lose another fake gf or something?
This is sad but I can't look away
i'm so sorry
No one trolls you better than you troll yourself. There have been a zillion fake girlfriends in the past, and you have fallen for every one of them. Stop being so gullible.
0:57 me on my bike cruisin the freeway.
It all comes full circle. Another saga, another public meltdown. You're quite formulaic. Give up on the Internet. It will only bring you pain. That being said, I know your game... My comment is pointless.
but Christine, it was obvious she was playing with you all along most of the times womans looks for some kind of financial security and you my friend is always begging for money.
i cant take this seriously with that fucking music
I can't even understand what he's saying. I'll just wait for the cwcki transcript.
Finally our God has made a comeback
I feel like I just watched The Force Awakens of Chris-chan videos.
This is probably the best content we'll get from the Jessica saga. Not bad.
That wasn't a proper curse ye hami ha. That curse wont work
Is this about the date he was going to have? He found out it was a troll?
What has all this trolling accomplished?
This is my normal form\n*hnnnnnngh*\n This is a Virgin With Rage. \nAnd this... \n*HNNGH*\n ...this is what is known as a Virgin With Rage that has ascended past a Virgin With Rage. Or, you could just call this a Lesbian Transwoman Tomgirl. \nAND THIS...\nIS...\nTO GO...\nEVEN...\nFURTHER...\nBEYOND!!!!\n\n*HNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*\n\n>shits self
What's her problem and why is she acting like a brutish male?
Hello again, 2009. I'm not sure what happened to Chris but it seems he's devolving back into his old male self. Which is good for us of course.\n\nI mean, he's going to need to look like a man sooner or later before Barb passes. Very few employers would hire Chris the way he is now.
Ok this is fucked up. all Chris wants to do is be happy and you guys have to destroy that
I T B E G I N S
YES! YES YES YES!!! A Curse Ye Ha Me Ha Wave! It's been so long!
This is truly a broken man
You look a little like Angelena Merkel. Why the hell did you trust random people online again? I thought you of all people would've learned that's a bad idea by now.
1:40 That made me jump out of my seat.
Yo chris-chan, I get that you're upset and everything but you should calm down before making a video as to not feed those dirty trolls.\n\nBig fan of sonichu btw, it's a huge artistic inspiration for me, hope you write more.
I'm guessing Jessica Quinn wasn't the Lovely weather after all XD
The definition of Gout.
HOW IS THIS EVEN REAL?  HOW CAN HE BE SERIOUS??????????
Is Chris part bird or something?
Christine sounds like an old lady from an anime in this
And Chris's gradual metamorphosis into Barb continues...
He is so angry, that it isbeyond the capabilities of his autistic mind to express the extent of this anger.
this is the chris we know and love...keep them coming
My Cursed and Bitter soul enjoys your suffering.
the music just makes it perfect
And plus Cool your jets
Was expecting a CurseYeHameHa its been a hot minute
And here I was thinking it would never be the way it was ever again
He's gone mad. \nIT'S HAPPENING
For the love of god someone end this fucking miscreants misery
He is so mentally ill. He will never get old he will just kill himself someday.
O W N E D
Chris is really pulling off the insane, shrill, middle aged lady look rather well.
Fellas, how do I break this curse? I've been having nothing but bad luck ever since I viewed this video.
Jesus Christ, that room. It's only a matter of time until this house burns down too
This MAN is truly insane...
Why was i being yelled at by mickey mouse's voice actor?
Hahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaha. I can't even 😂
It kinda sounds like he's faking it, but that just makes it even more funny.
I am sorry she was fake. Your best chance at finding real love is getting a job and meeting girls in person. Try doing community events as well! Love is hard to find Christine Weston Chandler. You will never find it online. Stay off the internet with your relationships. I am sorry the trolls were cruel to you . I hope you find someone who really loves you Christine. I feel bad and I can relate to how you feel in this situation. I am so sorry you are going through this.
Is this a video from Chris or a clip from a so bad it's good (or comedy) movie?
Chris, please take back the curse! I can't handle any more!
Chris, call it's quite
Christ the hormones must be kicking in because that is the highest falsetto i have ever heard.\n\nPoor Chris looking like an old lesbian cat lady here.
Chris looks and sounds and dresses just like like one of those crazy old witch wiccan ladies who live by themselves in a run down  house on the edge of town.  His body language even mirrors it.
Truth be told, I can barely tell what he's saying. Someone hacked his Facebook account I think?
I accidentally drop butter on top of my popcorn.....I'm cursed D:
Someone give me a run down?  Was he gf a troll?
Chris is quite the thespian.
FINALLY CHRISTORY IS COMING BACK. THE NEW TESTAMENT
I'd be going apeshit too If I'd had to listen to the backround music all the time.
0:55 I knew it, I knew you were sofa king!
nice acting
Sofa King.
Dafuq happened to his eye?
He’s back!!!!!
Wew lad
:D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
Happy halloween, Christine!!
*exhales*\n\nAhh... The old times
whats happening???,
I'd smash
You're welcome Chris :^)
Hilarious
Inhale, exhale, take it easy.
You're tearING ME aPAT, LIsa!
Early Christmas present
1:07–1:10 new ringtone
Get memed kid

Yall hating but the musics pretty cool
Beep boop boop beep boop boop beep boop boop.
1:05 REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
oh no
REEEE in human form
ATTENTION EVERYONE! THIS VIDEO IS NOT REAL! THIS IS AN IMPOSTER PRETENDING TO BE THE TRUE AND HONEST CHRISTINE WESTON CHANDLER. THE REAL CHRISTINE DIED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO. DON'T BELIEVE THIS LIAR!!\n\nhttps://evonews.com/entertainment/viral-stories/2017/oct/03/creator-of-sonichu-dead/
reminder: this is a 35 year old adult, in a room for bratty 8 year old, that looks like a 70 year old, acting like a 5 year old
His screaming sounds like an exotic animal
The happy music and the millions of toys really do add a whole new layer of insanity to this.
God bless Jessica Quinn and the trolls for giving us a new Chris Chan rage video
chris is back, baby!
I'm feeling pretty constipated
Watching on the toilet
P O O   I N   L O O   P A J E E T
What if they used waste of all sorts to generate electricity?
Why trump is on the thumbnail?
I am going to study  my poop  in my school
Being constipated is very painful when I need to take a dump.
Correction: We don't excrete faeces, we egest faeces. Excretion is only for metabolic waste products, but egested stuff isn't.
Why ami watching this at 3am :/
I'm watching this while pooping...
1987: I bet there will be flying cars in the future\n2017:
You talked about doing number one and two, but what about number three?
U have no other topic to discuss its disgusting
what's the best time to watch the video ! obviously while taking a dump 😂😂
A toilet roll is not a water jet - it's a roll (of paper). Hence, toilet roll = toilet paper
Who else is watching on the toilet?
WHAT ELSE IS LEFT TO UPLOAD A VIDIEO ABOUT TO HIM.
The squat toilet also exist in Vietnam, Japan, Korea and other Asian countries
drop the kids off at the pool That could also mean sperm..
Seriously guys. Don't do tissue anymore! It's not efficient and it's hurting the environment. Imagine the number of toilet tissue you guys use if we add those all up, imagine the trees that could have been use for much better things.\n\nSwitch to hand and soap (with a help of tabo), it's cleaner and way more effective and efficient.
I was just wondering about this yesterday, thank you for this video. 😅
I generally prefer squat toilets over WC's\nthey're just WAAAAAAAAYY free-er\n(like this now... QUICK)
I like taking the browns to the superbowl
How often do I do the #2? \nAs soon as I eat at Taco Bell
It funny how I found this while pooping
I always say dropping the bill cosbys at the pool
This video is pooping  yeah right  not popping. 😂
Can I get a ❤️?
Being a furry is shittier than having a shit on the freddy's
That's a shitload...
I watched this video while pinching a loaf into the albino hunchback (aka pooping). 💩
I recommend not to use the squat toilet. It's highly dirty and stink
I am watching this while on the crapping
I always think about this, keeps me up at night
What they should be teaching kids at school
Who requested this? 5 year olds?\n-well. Were all kinda 5 cause we clicked lmao-
It looks like Infographics ran out of ideas..,
whats the definition of an Olympic pool?
It's different if you have FAP cancer you have to go to the toilet for a poo much much more it's a rare cancer and sadly I have it
I'm watching this while pooping.
I'm 14 and one time I took a shit and lost around 4.5 pounds\n\n\n\n\n\nIs this bad?
Dude, I just ate Neapolitan ice cream (vanilla strawberry and chocolate) and this is recommended to me lol
A bidet is an excellent investment. They can be easily installed on regular sit toilets now and are quite affordable, hygienic and reduce waste.
I am glad I don't live in India.
God damn you guys know how to beat around the bush.\n\nWhy not just get to the point?
pee 7 times a day!!! i only go like 2 times a day.
Fact: this is your crappiest video!!!! :)
yes i did try the squat toilet
Whose in all honesty on the toilet rn?
Simply thinking of all that poop, poor butt.
Hoe about take the browns to the supper bowl
4.5 ounces? Shit I had a turd over 1 foot long no joke lol
Squat toilets are not found in india??!?? 🤔🤔😬😬👏👏
I'm Irish but currently live in China and I have to say I prefer sitting toilets in my own house but squatting for public toilets for reasons quite obvious.
I do NOT pee 7 times a day. Maybe 3.
What about Kim Jung-Un? According to North Koreans he doesn't poop.
Rule #1 *Don't talk to me while I'm Pooping*
This surely is a crappy video!
I shit about twice this amount
I am eatin chili fries right now! And I don't want it anymore!
ok infographics show is getting weird where is the military comparison do nato against china! plz info pz!
I say drooping the F BOMB
I had to poop after the video. I wonder why???
I have tried the squad toilet because I lived in Iran for 10 years.
People pee 7 times a day?? I'm usually once, maybe two at most!
13,500,000 gallons in a lifetime? 13,500,000 gallons over 80 years is 168,750 gallons per year. 168,750 gallons per year over 365 days is 462 gallons per day. I'm confused... at 8 cups a day, that's nearly a thousand times too high... Did you mistake milliliters and liters, Infographics Show?
Whom is also watching this on the toilet
Who is watching this while Doing it
I would spend 3 days on a toilet just to never have to poop again
Over here it’s called the “Shit hole”
Drop the Cosby’s off at the pool
Lmao the irony
BOG!
Pressure builds up everytime he says poop
Choke a darkie
I am using Squat Toilet..
penis size matters!!
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
A peeing olympiad
Heh, poop
Release the chocolate hostage...
Oh shit
One word.\nRetarded units.
ive fallen into the shitty😂 youtube videos
k...k-kurgzgesagt???
Pooping rn
Content that we deserve
Oh my goodness.. Imagine the name crapper
The wizz palace.
I like crappy jokes, thanks Infographics!

I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.
Is this an actual game or just a fun little animation?
*I have to play this, thank you for the video because this is the first time I have heard of it*
This is an app for android and iOS.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bonusxp.legend
Less than 300 likes and 27 comments but it’s on trending?!?!??! \nOk YouTube
I need this in my life.
Its hard to search for it in the play store. I downloaded it after clicking links that directed me to it in the store. Uninstalled it because im werry of its access.
LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
I need this to happen
To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.
Is this gonna be a real game?
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
I'm here before this blows up. I made an it parody check it out ❤️
I wish they'd do a Stranger Things TellTale game instead
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13
where can I find it and bring it to the Nintendo switch
Please be real.
Hi
Who else hit start.😁?
What a game!!👍
what's the name of the game called
Here before this blows up.
Pokemon+Undertale+Stephen King:W O N D E R F U L  (Please,bring it on steam)

Anyone ever think about if YouTube hadn't been created? How you would of never even heard of Rhett and Link and all the other big (and small) youtubers you watch on a daily/weekly basis.  I'm soo glad it exists. 🙂
I'M FROM DESTIN TOO!
The amount of times Link left Rhett hanging in this episode XD
Wouldn’t Sauce Boss be better?
You guys are amazing dont retire ever
I like it better when they tell them the right answer after they answer so they can reevaluate their whole lives.
At 4:56  rhetts hand is saying rock on

How about PB CUP taste test?
They for got the hot sauce of taco bell is call diablo that os hotter than fire
This was published on my birthday. I can't believe  that my favorite youtube channel made a video on my birthday this the best birthday ever. Thank you GMM for making my birthday special.
The only one I would have a chance of getting would be Taco Bell bc I haven’t eaten or even heard of any other restaurant 😂
do different types of dragons​
the finger is grossing me out idk why.
This is one of the best YouTube comment sections and one of the best original YouTube channels still alive... I'm so proud of everyone who supports and creates these videos :)
I was waiting for the patein peding picture of the seen on gmm like the fake advertisement haha
*Eats Taco Bell hot sauce*\n\n“Taco Bell would never do this”
After so long... as you can see, we can't gets me every time
Watching Rhett and Link suck hot sauce off a gloved finger because pornhub was down. (I'm sorry)
There's a Jack in the Box 30 minutes away from my house, which also happens to be right by my favorite park. My favorite thing to do is drive up there, chill at the park, then get 4 tacos from JITB 😂 I live in Ohio so they're not common at all, but I love their tacos.

Whatever happened to clearly canadian?
Is this all these guys do? Taste and guess foods?
As you can see, we cant.  LOL loved this one
I love how they just know when the other is high-fiving
Does anybody else see the picture behind Link's head that in every video it has something to do with what they are doing. 🎯
You guys need to do a progressively spicier noodle challenge. 1. NORMAL ramen noodles 2. CHILI ramen noodles 3. SHIN ramyun noodles 4. SAMYANG hot ramen noodles 5. SAMYANG super hot ramen noodles. 6. Rhett and Link Select+ Ultra spicy noodles
Hot saws! You guys has too much sauce! Hahaha

Rimmel London has SO many cool products out, just not available to us in the US. I wanna try so many things, the main one being the Contour Stick! I seriously have been thinking about saying fuck it & ordering it from Amazon bc I honestly don't think it will EVER be available in the US!
I can still remember finding your skull tutorial on halloween and discovering your channel! Love you x
How to make your fat face look slim
‘ just because we’re dead doesn’t mean we can’t highlight ‘ 😂😭💅
Basic. Everyone has done this already. Next.
Just cause we dead doesn't mean we can't highlight 😂☠
seriously you make black shadow contour look good. \nalso. i live for the weeeeeeeeee when you zoom in. \nperf.
Such a good make up artist love all your looks!
Hey Jamie!! Just bought some Zoeva brushes and I would love for you to make a video of how you clean your brushes. I don't want to ruin mine so it would be great if you show us how you do it!! :*
You are just the cutest!!! loved the looks
Do they get mad when you call their products the wrong thing?
honestly when i die the highlighting trend is going to be something that people look back and cringe at (lookin at you overplucked brows) but im gonna demand in my will that they highlight me to the gods bc just because we dead doesnt mean we cant highlight
Celebrate death. Dumb people buy products to help the zionists
Love it!  Love everything about it!! 💀☠️💀☠️💀☠️
Thank you so much for simplifying this and making it actually seem doable! 😊
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT EVEN I CAN PULL OFF THE 'MAKEUP SKILL-ADVANCED' SKULL????? Why in the hell does every other tutorial make it look like it requires 33 full hours and half a dozen hands to accomplish exactly what you just did? Thank you for the simpler tutorial!!!!!! \nP.s. I don't plan on letting death stop me from highlighting either.😂😂😂😂💥💥💥
Such a cool look
Simple but absolutely incredible!! I'm doing this for Halloween!! loooooove!!!
You are so pretty!!
I want to know how you did the makeup you started this look with!!! It’s gorgeous!!
This was amazing!!!! So good! You should do an actual day to night makeup look. Like how you'd fix up your foundation/concealer and everything too! That would be great to see!
You're gorgeous and have stunning eyes! Quite frankly, you make me sick! Lol! Kidding. You really are very beautiful, though. :)

Loving this Halloween look, glad to see a good person representing Glasgow for once, love from a fellow Glaswegian 💖
Chester sang with a fire like none other, and it was a light that burned bright despite the darkness. His burning passion for music is what sparked a fire in my friends and I to try and pursue music, and we hope that we can continue fanning the flame for music that Chester sparked in our hearts. We would greatly appreciate it if you could check out our tribute to Chester and everything he's done for all of us.
Miss them as a band </3
Published on my birthday 😭 rip Chester
😿😿😿😿this video tearing me into pieces💔rip chester
That voice......Hope you are in better place!
Omg..got tears in my eyes..
still I cry after his departure....long live chester
HE LEFT US WITH HIS BEAUTIFUL VOICE
Rest Easy Chester! We’ll keep your legacy going! You helped me and many others through some tough times, I just wish we could’ve done the same for you 😭.
I had goose bumps all over my body already after the first words he sang... he'll never die, he's in our hearts & minds. No one should suffer so heavily so that the only way out seems to be suicide... pray for everyone who is having a hard time 🙏😔💗
That was just prefect It brought tears to my eyes
Linkin Park poem: This world isnt rad without Brad\nthat one guy I like is Mike \nthis I had to do but Chester is blue\nI like corn on the cob as much as I love Rob\nDave is brave\nno Jon I love Joe han\n\nLove you lots Mike, Brad, Dave, Joe han and Chester ❤ i hope you found peace legend.😔
Chester u will be always be alive in our heart.... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0vHTC_wMy0 my tribute to you
those people who touch the unlike button \nrealy they dnt know what is music who is chester what is linkin park  they only know how to go in bar n how to dance with her female
Aahhhh i like it... I really like this song!
You'll always be in our hearts...
I still remember the day when I found out....I broke out into tears, now I'm doing the same again.... Chester fought a tough fight and no one can say he lost the fight cuz that's not true.. he did all of what he can to keep going...he never killed himself... depression did.... R.I.P Chester, you will always be our true light 😭😭❤❤
Though a person like me goes through problems like any human being, this song may be sad but knowing chester has made me happy in life,  this brings me up no matter how hurt I am. Thank you chester I thank you for my happiness.
Never be the same. Lost a legend
You will live on forever legend 😭😭 R.I.P
How could 949 people dislike this ??
I want him back 😢😢💔
Hes my idol. I still cry when people remind me of him. He inspired me to be myself and to open up to people. Hes the reason why music is my life. People are always telling me why I am  crying when I didn't even know him but he is the reason I have been getting by day by day. It still hurts that hes not here but hes in my mind and heart. I will forever remember him. RIP Chester Bennington. I love you
These comments are so depressive omg guys stop ! 😭😭❤️lol
it also reminds me to some sad moments in Gravity Falls, in weirdmageddon ofc. the last part. btw RIP Chester😭
Linkin park has always been something by my side after my dad passing away and after I heard about Chester Bennington's death i immediately broke down, Linkin Park was always there for me, Chester will always be an icon in music and no one can top   his talent
What happened to chester
Rest in peace Chester, you will always be remembered.
Subscribe to me and ill subscribe to u
How do you dislike a song basses on a legends death rip Chester
I still can't believe y'all chose money over Chester on his death date..  But if he accepted it I do too
This makes me cry. I still can't believe you're gone. This is truly beautiful. I looked up to you so much and Linkin Park was one of the first bands I've listened to. You wil never be forgotten. 💔🙏💕
I go way way back with Linkin Park. Chester will always be greatly missed.
What a creative lyric video... Absolutely beautiful! 👌
Maybe some people die because they are needed in a better world.
We love u chester
Who is Chester? This was in my recommend list
I've been a fan ever since my mother showed me. I was just so shaken when I found out what happened I'm so terribly sorry to the fans and family  we will continue to pass on his legacy. Rest In Peace you will be remembered. Just like what Babe Ruth said, Heroes get remembered but Legends never die
You'll stay in my life no matter what you did. I will always remember and miss you. You are important.
So the people in the lyric video wrote “we’re quicker, quicker” and I thought it was “or quicker, quicker”. Which one is it?
RIP Chester..\nRock in heaven✌ ❤
Chester may be lost,but he will never be forgoten
I Had A Friend Commit Suicide About 7 Months Ago. \nIt's Hard Going Through It, I Always Took Him For Granted, When I Discoverd His Death I Immediately Started To Think To My Self  Why, Was I So Distant From Him? \nIt Takes Effect Now That One Of My Favorite Band Artist/Singer I Loved As A Child Has Now Passed On.\n\nR.I.P Chester, \nI Promise One Day, Ill See You Up In The Millions Of Stars Shinning
This song should be on billboard top no.1 \nLegend Chester Bennington
Chester will never truly die he is a part of us I'm 15 years old I love Chester he will stay in my heart I once thought I hated my self for everything Chester inspired a lot of people much love ❤️.😭😭😭😭

*I'm not crying, my eyes are just sweating*\n        -Alpha Shade
Each day is just as hard as the last.  I miss you Chester and I always will.
When I was 22 years old I try to throw my self in front of an on coming train. Now I'm 33 years old. The reason why lived is to fight though humans that failed me as a child, so much abuse was done to me and I saw on the tax payer dollar. I still in a way live in its shadow. The fight for me ends soon in November of 2017. Chester Bennington and LP as a whole help be the arts I'm now and author. (www.alexgordon-emerald.com) I have so much to be thankfully them for. Chester death is a blunt reminder of the risks I take when I mix my art with all of the bad shit done to me and others. Like Chester I'm risking my life for my art, but I don't want it any other way. Chester thank you, tears are falling on my key bored I do understand. Time to rest good knight and god speed.
Chester is now resting in Peace. As fans, we carry on his legacy!
Chester will never die in our hearts but when I saw that chester commited suicide  I broke down soo hard I cried  for him and in my heart I was like no ooooooo no chester no ooooooo why chester why? You can't leave us like this man and I prayed  RIP chester all day chester will never be forgotten  and I will tell all my friends family and my children  about chester.#RIPchester  what a great man!!!

Monopoly guy is great but what does that equifax CEO shine his head with?
This video missed the best part. When he wipes his brow with a stack of money.
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
I am so relieved he had a Monocle... I thought for a moment he would fail but HE DID NOT
quality troll
How did I do guys?
This is amazing.  \nAnd this man is fucking HERO.
That monocle though!!!
Oh this makes my day.
When the monocle came out .......dead
The hero we need
this dude is my spirit animal
Get that woman a tv show!
That's a woman btw
Plot twist... that's actually a woman in that costume
This is trending???
This dude's head is brighter than my future
hello there, fellow redditors
Seem to be two kinds of people here, those remember him having a monocle and people tha think it is some sort of conspiracy! It is not an effect, you just never played the game!
This is world class trolling
And a new hero emerges.
That person is a Female, get yo facts straight y’all
Thanks for the Free Parking. -_o
fun fact!!!!\n*the monopoly guy doesn't wear a monocle*\n👀
i didn't not know wade wilson was here.
It’s funny that this will be trending and plenty of people will write comments here but how many of you will actually call or write your representatives to protect your life and livelihood?\n\nTake 30 seconds to contact them: \nCopy and paste:\nPlease federally limit personal and small business liability for fraudulently used identifying information and replace the social security number system.\n\nThen sign it and mail it your representatives.\n\nAlternatively google your state for your senator/house representative and call them at the number on their website to say the same as the above message.\n\nIf legislation is properly implemented this could literally save your life, your child’s college saving, your family’s lives or your local small business for an investment of 30 seconds today.\n\n(Flagrantviolations.com)
now that's how you fucking protest,  take notes people
This is the reason why I want to attend these meetings
I have never laughed so hard at something in my life before. Hahaha, well done good sir. Well done.
This is how Trump got elected people dont know how to do their jobs and screen and check peoples identity properly hes probably a russian spy
It’s not just the freeze part.
These guys sell all their shares prior to making their WE BEEN HACKED announcement and yet no charges for fraud? This infuriates me.

But what if they hired her to distract you from the real issue??
Jews control America's Federal Reserve and foreign policy.
Just because they wear a top hat and cardboard mustache and wipe their brow with fake money doesn't mean they are trolling... 😃\nEveryone, please watch my little nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
I wish for a interruption. But anyway nice job !
Hilarious and original!! Love it.
He's practicing for Halloween x)
so funny I forgot to laugh
Apparently the Mandela Effect suggests the Monopoly guy NEVER wore a monocle? What do YOU remember?
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
He had a monocle in a different reality I'm 100% sure its the Mandela effect in action.
I guess everyone's doing a side show now too
Now this... this is nice.
Crazy part is thats no troll. Thats actually Sam Walton founder of Walmart reinvigorated and given a new body to live out immortality.
Best laughs I have in weeks :'D
This is why I joined the internet.
Wait the monopoly guy never had a monocle though
This is the best thing ever
After many days I found a quality video

Fake. Cute edit though.

LOL, that guy is my hero!

Now this is how you fucking make a trailer
This could be a good show. But where's OA Season 2????????????
Kids are looking forward to this Christmas flick... oh wait..
The first german series on netflix. Lets see ....
Mixture of The OA and Stranger Things
That looks like some good shit right there. Good shit. Right there right there If I do say so myself and I say so
OK, guys, before the movie is released on Dec. 1, guess the answer to the question: When?
When has kidnapped the children?
I'm pretty sure the question of who kidnapped the kids is gonna come up a few times, and be important to the plot.
I'VE BEEN WAITING A YEAR SINCE THE FIRST TRSILER I'M SO EXICTED
Like it If you are also watching this video in 2036.
see.. Germans have something more terrifying than Hitler
Love the use of typography!
I wish this was just a trailer for an episode of new season of black mirror
damn son. please find some nasty asian movie, those are hardcore too.
Really? First, a move called Bright. Now, we have Dark. Can they film Dim?
As a person who loves shows like Stranger Things, I still don't see the resemblance and it feels more like IT (and just a tiny bit of Riverdale) to me to be honest...
So kids go missing\nWith Netflix that means only one thing,\nThey're trapped in the Upside Down!
This reminds me of a book I've read Black River by T.J. MacGregor which the antagonist kidnaps children from different timelines.
Stranger things + It
Yo. Netflix gets a standing O from me. They are killing the movie market.
Nope, too late at night for this, Netflix. I'll come back in 10 hours.
I pressed like before I even watched the video
fun for all the family.
So, is this produced in English or will this be subtitled?
Its giving me black mirror and the returned kind of vibes don’t know why though
Can't wait to watch both Dark and Bright on Netflix!
Okay you have my attention.
It looks like Saw 😱
Yeah my birth day........... does that say something
sold. I'll have to read this with subtitles
Anything with time travel, I'm in.
Netflix has a lot of horror films coming out this month and I'm excited for all of them
Okay, you have my attention.
What If Doc Brown was a Weeping Angel?\nSOLD!
Now this looks interesting.
Could be the next stranger things or it could be shit I'm gonna give it a chance
I've been waiting for this for quite sometime now
The question is is math related to science
something that stephen king would write
I will give chance,looks good
Dose Netfilx ever make Christmas movies and tv shows.
I'm having a travelers feel about this, but more in the horror genre
This looks interesting
Oeh Nice
twin peaks vibes
interestinggggggg
Jigsaw reborn...😁😁😁
Uumm, yea...
Fucking Pennywise.
Dammit! Another Adam Sandler movie...🤔
Netflix is straight ass
This is fucking good damnnn
You got my attention!
Um, what?
This looks sick!
Stranger Things + time travel

Fuck yes
Gosh darnit Netflix I can't take your awesomeness any more!

Wunderbar!
JOLLY TIMES

German Broadchurch? Yes please.
Looks promising
I'm in.
Vikings
I don't get it..
Es geschah am hellichten Tag, ich bin mal gespannt. (I'm curious.)
Are they implying a ginger gone missing is a bad thing?? 🤔😬🤐
Getting Twin Peaks vibes from this.
Wow Stranger Things season 2 looks great!
This looks happy and delightful
seems good
Woah this looks visually stunning!
I am ready!!!

Why is everyone comparing this to stranger things ? I don’t even see the comparison at all - seriously that show was boring and I personally didn’t even like it - so everyone please stop comparing it due to this doesn’t even have aliens or Little’s kids so how the hell are they similar ? Get over yourselves!
Netflix, why you're doing this to me? Too many great shows, i can't keep up , my older cousins can't stop talking how their 90's childhood were better compare to mine , Niggas please,  you didn't have netflix back then
When you really want to empathize that you're show is DARK
Yay thanks to the new Wolfenstein games we're finally getting more German medium content
movie or series?
a little like the OA ?
Looks Finchery im game!
But the question is, does it actually release in Dec. 1 2019?
Stranger Things 1.1
stränger zings or ït
Is this going to be in English?
Can people not compare every supernatural show to Stranger Things. It was alright but definitely overrated
Netflix movies usually look the same for me. I hope they stop making such movies or use a different editor at least.
Song??
Movie or series?
Netflix I have an idea for a great show it could bring you more subscribers but nothing is free so wassup
So... Stranger Things with time travel stuff?
The question is not donde esta la biblioteca...
is this a german production?
Sometimes reporting on these things hits me hard. I know I've said it before, and I'll continue to say it but please call, text, email, or better yet tell someone in person you love them today. The world can be so cruel and our time isn't guaranteed. In case someone hasn't said it to you today, I love ya, Nation. <3
Your very impartial I really enjoy your style of news presentation you try and cover all aspects and not swing left or right
Remember: The demographic of people responsible for the most deaths of human beings is governments (just in the 20th century we had Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, the Kims, Mussolini, and Saddam Hussein, amongst others) and gun bans don't apply to them. Gun ban = assigning wolves with the task of disarming the sheep to protect the peaceful sheep from the violent sheep.
Condolences to everyone affected, My heart goes to all of you and I wish you the strength for the hard times to come. This is my opinion but in a DUI we blame the driver, in a bombing we blame the bomber but why in a shooting do we blame the gun? even if guns were banned entirely bad people will find a way to get them, like most illegal things. Yes gun regulation needs a look at but if someone good has a gun at the right time and the right place that's lives that could be saved. Bad people will find a way and D-bags will be D-bags, nothing changes that, this guy might've been sick or whatever, doesn't change the fact he was a bad person and that he just needs to be forgotten, we remember the people affected and will honor their names but not the d-bag.
Thank you, Philip. I'm saddened by the fact that so many are using this situation to spread more theories and dramatics about things unrelated, unprovable, and unnecessary when we should be focused on the real topics at hand. When we should see an event like this and come together as a nation, as a people and make changes happen to help prevent this type of thing in the future.
The fake victim, 3:33, on the right is a porn star i believe.
Loved how he had the humility to leave out the like and subscribe part! Love ya Frankie ❤
Bump fire stocks dont sound like that. Sounds like a M240 Bravo. just another deep state bullshit.
Finally a guy with common sense! I hate how the media seems glorify these acts of violence!\nGun control, isn't the problem! Mental Health issues and society itself is the problem!
You would think that Aldean would have told people to run over his microphone. The POS, p*ssy.
Too bad no one believes it.
All these attacks happening in the world but VEGAS? Beautiful place and no high security? Just makes you wonder that nowhere is safe anymore. Heart goes out to those who lose their lives ❤
I get not showing the killers face so you can deny some notoriety but showing a flag that has flown above hundreds to thousands of  brutal executions is doing the same exact thing. Anyone with knowledge of liveleak and a strong stomach has seen  human beings killed in the most brutal fashion (ie beheadings w det cord/having a car w prisoners shot at with an rpg/ drownings in a swimming pool/thrown from buildings). The Kurds I work with call ISIS 'dogs'. Don't say you won't show this guy and still raise the IS flag up shortly after. My 2¢, thanks.
If you think gun control doesnt work you you are just ignorant of all the evidence. It works, its as simple as that. It reduces mass shootings, violent crime, suicides etc. countries with gun control are often just flat out better places to live, not some messed up oppressive regime
If you want to shoot in Chicago guess what you do, drive to Indiana. Federal laws are needed.
Have we figured out a profile for all these terrorist in America?
You need to make your videos about gun control because you say that there will be a big debate over the next month but there won't!
If I fell off my bike I'm pretty sure isis would claim responsibility.
This guy is an ignorant corporate puppet not able to comprehend the situation and how he is contributing to the downfall of his country. The government wants to abolish the second amendment for obvious reasons and if you would research outside of mainstream media you will find the lies fed to you are quite disturbing. Don't believe anything you are told, consider all information available and form your own opinion, Phillip de Franco is not qualified to give you any of this information.
Phil, it's motifs and videos like this is the reason why you've had rock solid respect in my book after many many years of watching.
the mass shooting was differently a false flag shooting im from texas and live in texas and they are already say more gun control fuck that if you try and take my guns my whole state will shoot.
This just proves the point that terrorism can not just be accredited to foreign factions or terrorist groups. We need to understand that the threat can come from anywhere. Its so sad to say that we need to be vigilant about our own safety.
Was the said man as a shooter, framed or scapegoated? It sounds really strange, like Oswald.
false flag, there were 2 shooters and its been caught on camera and on phone calls that were to at least 2 because gun shots sounds were coming from two different directions and i bet it was set up to disarm the american public.
I'm not one for conspiracy theories but in the videos I've watched of the recent Las Vegas shootings you can clearly hear multiple automatic weapons fire from multiple different locations and it begs the question, why are the mainstream media trying to cover up the truth?!
Gun control vultures always swarm on tragic events. Funny how a guy targets a conservative majority event and conservatives get blamed.
There was no spent brass on the floor in the shooter's room.
I don’t want to be a part of the divisiveness anymore. I feel regret from taking a part in it. I’m done.
Not terrorism. I get that you want to place that on something for someone so evil but use the definition as intended so that we can distinguish the differences.
yo phil the best case i can give you for proof of gun control working just look at australia
Yep the world is dying. There no peace without conflict. There's no love without hate. Those were Thompson guns being shot out. Halloween massacre. This is why i say it was a Thompson https://youtu.be/x4QWrha3HLw it's the mafia. They usually hang in casinos. My whole life is based on nightmares so i don't care. We did terrorism in the past by blowing up Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Vietnam.
I wish people would stop making videos on this attack on my city before all the evidence comes out.   Today the local news is saying paddock might have accomplices and he had explosives in his cars and may have had an escape plan to cause more harm.   But go speak more about guns before we find out more of his motive and if he has  people that might be on the run that might cause something more heinous in the near future
I live in Las Vegas, and the morning after this happened I got 4 texts asking if I was alright, and I read them before I even knew this happened and I was terrified.
If this is what the US is, I'm glad not to be American
Trump visited the fake actors this don't look good for him if this really fake.
it doesn't make sense.... why all the guns and not more ammo.... this stinks of false flag.
Your neutrality on the news reports is such a breath of fresh air in this bullshit world. All I've seen since this tragedy is conspiracy theories and gun control squabbles, as well as people blaming things totally unconnected. Almost nothing about the victims. Thank you Phil, for giving them the respect they deserve and for not giving the animal who did this the spotlight. I appreciate you so much.
Argument: Gun control wouldn't work on criminals, therefore there's no point.\nCounter Argument: Making murder illegal hasn't worked on criminals, therefore there's no point in keeping it illegal. \nIt's the same argument. Can someone please take a 1st years philosophy class and learn about fallacies.
I I think you're a great person with a great channel, but by not giving the identity of the perpetrator's name, you make ppl only more curious. They are less likely to search him up if his identity is revealed.
it hits me hard that murica kills zivils in the east like in syria everyday. Everyday hundreds of woman, children, babys getting killed from american bomb-carpets. Noone gives a shit. I mean, its sad that there was a man shooting 50 innocent people in las vegas. but this country is doing even more shit in wars they started by themself. wake up guys.
My mother was in Las Vegas for her one year anniversary with her new husband and they were in an Uber when all this happened. She called me at 2 AM letting me know she was OK. All I can think about is if she Uber to a little bit earlier maybe she would've gotten hurt and I feel so blessed that she's alright
It took over an hour to get to the shooter?! That just seems so wild to me. Even wilder is the fact he had 10 weapons on him. 10. Disgusting. My heart hurts so so badly for those killed and injured. Mental health evaluations in order to buy weapons is proving to be more and more important everyday.
I feel like there had to be more then one shooter... & I definitely think there should be more control over what weapons are being sold...  I was just at a county music concert a few weeks ago and I don't even want to imagine how it was to go though sometime like this, It's so sad , so many inocente life's gone 😕
You're a good dude, Phil. Always appreciate your reasonable level-headed stance on things, and I agree with not showing the name/face of the killer and focusing on the victims and people who help.
Free fisherofmen.
3:33 nope.
Donated and shared!
ALL THESE HAND GESTURES
So if you can't stop acts of violence  completely there shouldn't be any gun laws at all?? Someone explain that to me. if people don't have guns they'll find another way. So let's make it easy for them???
The news said that Isis said they denied any involvement in the Las Vegas shooting. But the shooter said otherwise in a book he wrote in along with other guns in his hotel room. How did he bring in such big guns without the hotel noticing anything weird
its a normal day why coz its not you know who is not init.thats why its not all over in the news
3:33 wow... The child of porn legend Johnny Sins' took one of his behind the scenes glamor shots and tweeted it out as a fake missing persons plea. He must be so embarrassed right now.
The Nevada legal definition of terrorism is different from the actual definition of terrorism...
Philip DeFranco \nGREAT JOB PHILIP!!!!!!!!\nON TELLING THE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH!!!!!!\nYOU DID A GREAT JOB POSTING THE FACTS AT THE TIME YOU KNEW WHAT YOU DID.\nNOTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU MADE THIS VIDEO.\nTHAT IS VERY VERY GOOD ON YOU, AND YOUR STAFFS BEHAVE!! \nKEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!!!!!<3
Big question: Who are the ones disliking this video? Is there literally 3,000 trolls watching this video just to dislike it?? He's merely discussing a tragedy and giving information in order to help the victims. I'm so not clear what is there to freaking dislike?!?!?!?!
I need to make money off a tragedy buy masking it with a fundraiser is the true title.
ISIS trying to be responsible dat fuzzed up \n\n\n\n\n\ncause they want to save the shooter \n\n\n\n\n\nS.M.H
Imagine if a muslim did it.\nThe media would have blamed my religion.
But Is he a Terrorist  yes or no?
The American people need to stand up to this continual gun crimes - Start marches and demonstrations -please keep them peaceful  but make sure the government gets the message monthly demonstrations will be great. \n\nI suggest americans  have marches and ensure  that the government pass new legislation to have  more gun control  since without marches more shootings will occur in the future. \n\nThe  Trump government or any other american government will not be able to help you when new shootings begin.\n\n I feel great sympathy for those shot in Las Vegas, but the only way to stop more shootings the american people must demonstrate otherwise the government will continue and allow guns to be sold to any one. \n\nThe best way is to stop all guns being sold - why doesn't the american government act  now---or have a referendum  let the people
Yo Phil open your eyes it's a false flag attack by the Cia
I will say what I've said since leaning the difference between Canada's gun laws and Americas gun laws. \nYou can't act surprised when a weapon of war is used to kill people.\nModern automatic and semiautomatic rifles, pistols, machine and sub machine guns are weapons of war.\nThey are designed to do 1 thing and 1 thing only. Kill and harm human beings. That was their main design and not only that but they were designed to be user friendly. To be efficient in live combat.\nThere's a reason you didn't have mass shootings in the wild west. All they had were revolver pistols and rifles, bolt and lever action rifles and barreled or lever action shotguns.\nThose guns are not designed for war, they are designed mainly for hunting.
Why gun control isn't a thing I'll never understand (apart from the fact gun companies sponsor the government)\n\nBut look, Australia banned guns after their worst massacre, haven't had one as bad since.
Gun control will work, because everyone knows criminals always obey the law and will turn their all their guns in; because it's the right thing to do. #thoughtsandprayers
I really can’t stand this bullshit anymore. I feel like a parent who’s disappointed in their children. Every time some shooting happens I usually brush it off and forget, but good god damn this one just hurts. I can’t understand it. The more I see and read, I mean, it’s just rough. I can’t understand why anyone would do this to people. Innocent people just going to listen to some music. I hate what the world is becoming. I hate that I have to raise my son in such a fucked up, unsafe world.
Las Vegas was a false flag.
lone wolf my ass , pure terrorists evil white man

It's never an act of terrorism when it comes to white people. Believe it or not but if it were a minority of ANY color, it'd be a terrorist act.
Phil have you ever heard of the New World Order or the illuminati?? Las Vegas is likely a staged  False Flag event by the illuminati/NewWorldOrder/Globalist/Deep State to stir up anti-gun legislation. They don’t want the American people to bear arms to oppose their efforts for a future takeover. It’s  a “psy-opt” or psychological operation, where there will be other so-called terrorist attacks repeated throughout the country to create an apparent “problem” to which they will offer a solution (*gun control), thus the Hegelian dialectic. With these deliberately staged “terrorist” acts, they want to create so much fear to make the American masses willingly give up their guns, so will be easier to control and rule in the future! Stephen Paddock is just the “patsy” they setup to take the fall, along with insinuations that it was ISIS related. Everyone needs to wake up before it’s too late!!!
American people deserve to see the note left behind in the hotel room.
I don't understand why its so hard to have an honest debate in America about gun control. A blanket gun ban has helped many countries become safer. I understand that the issue of black market guns would be a huge hurdle - but America is far from being a civilized nation with it's current course. \nThe whole country is propped up on superficial industries (much more so than most first world nations), and the gun industry is one of them - I understand losing it would be a huge economical blow, which is what the right is afraid to admit - just as the left is afraid to admit that they do indeed want an all out gun ban. \nWatching from the outside it seems like the spiral in the U.S. is just continuining, with major issues like distaster relief and the education system, the rehabilitation system for criminals, taxes and practically every major political issue being subverted to enhance the lifes of a few powerful people (left or right). The debt to China is massing in amounts that will make the U.S. a surrogate state with practically no political influence over Asia - and instead of having an honest discussion of why the American Dream has fallen so low, it seems like you squabble like children about who can read document from 1787 the best. \nIt really is disheartening to see such a great country fall so low. I truly and honestly hope America finds its way back to a strong and just nation, looking out for its people, and the people around the world - but right now the dream of being the best country in the world is an illusion with practiaclly no justification behind it.
It was a falseflag
who cares where going to have never ending terrorism in future anyways. alah akbar
So here's some evidence of the effectiveness of gun control laws, summarizing this article from a neutral source: \n\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/\n\n-Australia suffered a gun massacre in 1996: 35 dead, 18 injured.\n-The National Firearms Agreement was passed as a result. Some semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned and stricter registration/licensing policies were implemented. There was also a huge amount of buybacks, and 700,000 guns were sold to the government. Laws were further tightened in 2002.\n-There were 23% fewer homicides in 2013 than there were in 1996, though some fluctuation in between.\n-13 gun massacres happened in the 18 years before the NFA, 0 gun massacres in the 18 years after.\n-“In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33).”\n-“The number of homicide incidents involving a firearm decreased by 57 percent between 1989-90 and 2013-14”\n\n*This doesn't prove or disprove anything*  Whatever your opinion, I encourage everyone to do their own research. Have a great day, stay alive |-/
I can't really comment on the laws and gun control in the United States as I have never been there.\nThat being said. Being an Australian and living with our gun control laws that were implemented after only ONE mass shooting, I can send my nieces and nephews out in public without the constant thought of if they will be shot to death by someone who got their hands on a weapon because background checks weren't carried out correctly.\nI have never understood why anyone would need Semi/Automatic weapon as personal protection and it shouldn't be allowed. \nA small hand gun is good enough for your home and that is where they should stay. Locked up in your home, to protect you in your home.\nEveryone spewing that any change to the laws regarding weapons will remove your freedoms... why do you need guns to be free? If you do, clearly you're not free and you should probably look at why you need a weapon to feel it.
The shooter had no criminal record and was cleared of all background checks.  He purchased most(or all) of the guns legally.  Tell me, how could you have predicted that this one person would've committed the worst mass shooting in the US to date? The fact that he was able to get his hands on SO many weapons without a blip in the system goes to show the weakness in our system.  Yes, people kill people but guns facilitate the killing. A valid reason to have a single or limited firearm would be for instance, running a jewelry store. But the fact that this scum of the earth got his hands on so many guns without raising a red flag is the issue here.  If he had just a single handgun, there would be far fewer casualties.  \n\nIf other countries are able to implement effective gun control, eliminating future mass murder cases, why can't we? \n\nThe second point that Franco notes is also very important - the media is glorifying these killers. There should be laws for these criminals to remain unnamed and to focus solely on the victims.  People who commit crimes like these want the attention in their own very sick ways but we should wipe their existence from our minds and memories asap.
Hey team huge fan of the show from the Dubai.  Love getting my news from outlets like yours because I can see the unbiased truth unlike the news. \nEvery Country has flaws in their leadership and their government.  But the death of innocent people for any reason whatsoever is devastating.  Im not a gun person (out of smart decisions made by the government here) but I do understand protecting yourself and family in this age we live in.  But the sale and possession of automatic weapons to ANYONE must not be discussion it's common sense.  As citizens you all have the right to fight for common sense.  Taking the life of innocent people is just wrong.
Why did it take an hour for police to get to the shooter in the hotel
NOTHING happens in one of those hotels without it being on camera.  Where are the videos of him carrying all those guns in?
Wierd how they live in 320 and Stephen was on floor 32.... \n\n\n\nSomethings off...
It was a false flag setup. Please read what an investigator sent me, quoted below.\nVegas shooter:\n\nPerfect record, shows anyone can do it.\n\nAmassed guns starting when trump was elected.\n\nNo social media or traceable history OTHER than the perfect paper trail he left for the crime. No apparent motive. Fuels fear, also fits with portrait of a professional.\n\n27 residences, a lot of money, seems like a CIA operative who had his background scrubbed and tailored. No political affiliation creates mystery and sews doubt on both sides. \n\nAll legal weapons and mods, things that can now be viably targeted by legislation.\n\nCarefully and intelligently planned, yet didn't disable smoke detectors? Wanted to be found. No military training yet looks like a professional job that's been designed to look just enough like a smart yet amateur job from the outside. Yet many small details indicate much more professional than led to believe.\n\nAt least 3-4 shooters, one reported at ground level. Very easy to replace windows. Shooting rate of 500 impossible in 10 minutes for one person. Most mass shootings leave only 1 man to take one for the team and get everything pinned on him. Knew he was gonna die.\n\nEntrances to concert venue all completely blocked except for one.\n\nWoman and man telling everyone they're gonna die. Both described as being much shorter than the shooter\n\nWhole scene looks picture perfect to make case for gun control. No need or use for 23 weapons in the hotel room, only two of which have the bump fire stock, when he could obviously afford to equip them all. only used a couple of them. No ak's visible in photos, where was the ak sounding weapon from the videos? Only 308 present was not equipped with bump stock, wasn't used. No security footage showing him bringing up multiple bags with so many. Where's all the expended brass if one person is supposed to have fired several thousand rounds alone? The amounts we see are small and scattered in spread out patterns and places they wouldn't be. At such a constant cycle the piles would be far more consistent, not just a couple here and a few there. Only a couple dozen on the floor.\n\nOnce shooting started stage lights lit up the crowd, illuminating them for the shooter.\n\nIsis claims responsibility but it's IMMEDIATELY dismissed by both fbi and CIA. Isis claims a lot, its the dismissal that's disturbing
If one guy can do this to like 500 people can you imagine what all the gun owners can do against an invading foreign army I mean seriously
If you listen to the the entire police scanner the police say multiple times there were multiple shooter's. More fake news! If people thought the shooter's were still out there Vegas would be a ghost town.
My parents always taught me to have an exit plan in every situation and place I enter... \nWhere my parents able to predict the future or just really smart?
WHEN A MUSLIM KILL SOMEONE ATTACKING HIM ...IT'S TERRORISM ....... BUT WHEN A WHITE AMERICAIN KILL 59 PEOPLE AND INJURE 551 .......WELL HE IS JUST A POOR LONE WOLF THAT NEED HELP .......... THE WORLD NEVER USED THE WORD TERRORIM SINCE USA USED IT ...........SORRY TO SAY THIS BUTUS PEOPLE ARE ALSO TERRORIST AND THEY KILL PEOPLE MORE THAN ANY ONE ON EARTH  ...........3 MILLIONS ONLY IN IRAK
It's blatantly obvious you can here to guns firing at the same time
Anyone else see the leaked photos of the crime scene? Whole thing doesn't feel right.\n1. The gunman definitely was shot through the mouth, but in the picture there are empty 5.56 casings.... on top of the blood splatter, with no blood on them. The means he was dead before the casings landed.\n2. They claim he shot himself with a revolver. The revolver in the pictures next to him has no visible casings inside. It looks empty.\n\nFrom video footage of the shooting:\n3. The rate of fire was not that of an AR platform. I have looked up videos of full auto ARs and ones with bump fire stocks like the media is claiming. Both shoot too fast. The rate of fire is almost exact to an M240 Light machine gun. Look up the guns for yourself on youtube. Compare it to the Vegas footage.\n\nI'm not usually a conspiracy theorist it just worries me that if there was a second shooter or if this guy got set up, the real killer is still out there and his trail is getting colder every day
I have respect for the victims and the families victims and those who have been affected but I have no sympathy for the situation. Oh my god how did this happen? I wonder? Maybe it's all the guns you have in America? Nah? Sorry But I really need to know something. Do Americans actually believe that guns make them safe? Or do they enjoy living in their own ignorance? As an Australian, I have never understood this issue. Australia had 1 mass shooting over 30 years ago and now guns are banned in Australia without very strong regulations and reasoning. How many people have to die for people to realise that guns are the problem. That there are as many guns in America as there are people. How many more mass shooting do you need to open your eyes? I never believed it when people said Americans where the most stupid people in the world...... But now I know I was wrong.
Honestly what I think about this entire dilemma is that the guns aren't the ones killing people. IT'S THE PEOPLE KILLING EACH OTHER. So illegalizing the purchase of guns isn't gonna do jack-shit. People might agree, people might disagree, but this is once again, just my opinion. So don't go all super-sayian on my ass. The guy who started the shooting is American, which only makes things worse. And after the shooting he shot himself dead. But that didn't stop police from identifying him so his name and face is all over the news now. And as soon as the shooting was all over the news, guess what the unintelligent, stone-hearted people of the world did? OF COURSE THEY GO AND MAKE RUDE MEMES ABOUT IT! And that isn't cool! Same thing goes for 9/11 memes! They're not cool and need to be stopped! THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED IN THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11th! 1 billion people across the world watched as the World Trade Center in New York City collapsed due to a hijacked passenger airplane crashing straight into it. Other hugely popular terrorist attacks get noticed as memes now! Examples are; The Boston Bombing, Charlottesville, The Paris Terrorist Attacks, and other catastrophic terrorist attacks. And we have lost some of the most life-changing people ever throughout the 21st century. For example; Steve Jobs (the creator of Apple) Hugh Hefner (the original creator of the ENTIRE Playboy franchise). Overall this is my take on all of this. So I shouldn't get hate. #PrayforVegas
there is no common sense about common sense gun control. the ONLY way to truly do what these people want would be to comb through the entire country and take everyone's guns by force. Even IF you could pass this law, I don't think you understand just what this would be asking of everyone involved or how much it would cost. And even IF we did that, found all the civilian guns and took them without starting a full on anarchy? we'd need to lock down borders to prevent smuggling guns in. We can NEVER say it won't happen again. we NEVER will. Sorry.
Oh
No we dont, philip. no we dont.

It looks ugly
BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL BEZEL
Colorizer? I think you mean circular polarizer.
Ugly crap
3:43 fuck face
0:20 Pixel 2 has AMOLED display i think . XL has POLED.
Bank Account?
Pixel 2 XL, here I come.
Snappy Snapdragon...
Pixel 2 xl or note 8?
Pixel 2 is hideous. Pixel 2 XL looks alright.
Nice  video 👍 😃
LG V30+ > Iphone 8 Plus > Iphone SE > OnePlus 5 > Iphone X > Pixel 2 > RAZR flip phone > Nokia brick phone > SCAMSUNG S8 and Note 8
I wate for IPhone x 📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱
:
My reaction....... booooorrriiinng.
Neither
No headphone jack? No buy.
Who won the iPhone 8
Pixel 2 vs. LGV30?
Headphone jack?
Pro-tip: Better sound quality with Bluetooth on Android O is already possible. Thank you Sony. Activate developer options and you will see the new LDAC codec as selectable, which allows audio streaming up to 990kbps. You can also now select the sampling rate and sample size.
Those wireless assistant buds are a shitty excuse to remove the jack. They could make a first iteration of wired g. Assistant earbuds using the phone's tech reducing weight on them. Also keeping the 3.5mm
So savage to blur out that other guy (his army is coming to get you)
I have an s8, I feel like getting these phones isn't really an upgrade. But your getting fast updates, pure Android experience but no headphone jack, no face or iris scanner, less water resistance..... Decisions decisions.....
No headphone jack, No micro SD card slot, Not water resistant = Pass
The phone sounds great but I don't think the display looks that appealing, it looks washed out. The tech in the phone sounds amazing!
so the only complaints i see on this phone are with looks and headphone jack. So like, the least important aspects of a phone are what people complain about. LoL
Blah blah blah. If you want great camera, get a DSLR.
I’m wondering which one is better between LG v30 and pixel2 XL in term of daily performance.
That’s a lit phone
Great informational review. Like always, great video.
I'm I the only one who doesn't get the sudden obsession with bezel size?
Astute watchers will ponder whether he got coffee with Kyle or not...
This phone looks like a winner. Sure, it has a little bit of bezels, but it’s functionality and camera make up for it...And that unlimited photo/video cloud storage. Hyped.
Fantastic video ! I'm not even going to buy the Pixel but I enjoyed this. Thanks.
No headphone jack🤔 I thought they liked that thing.I guess they’ll be copying Apple from now on.
The normal one would look and prob just feel alot better with curved edges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this is coming from a g6 user
It's called a polarizer my dude
please someone tell me the diference betwen this and the samsung s8. i mean even google lens= bixby vision
Why is the flash and the camera swapped on some, but Normal on others?
I'm buying! Was going for the V30 but saw it today at Verizon and it's much wider than i thought. The V30 wasn't a very comfortable fit in my hand.
Honestly, i dont really like the new design i kind of like the old design better but thats just how i feel
Best thing is the front firing speakers 👍
Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel. Perhaps also test some native usbc headsets and Bluetooth options so we can get a better understanding of sound quality across the different options we now have.
The front panel on the Pixel 2 looks really cheap compared to the XL.
XL looks ok, but Pixel is really meh~ 2015 looking. First iPhone then Pixel, I don't appreciate they are doing this. Just give us the best only!
Definitely looking forward to the in depth review. Also get a hold of Google's new headphones and do a review on them.
Honestly if you’re upgrading from an older phone with big bezels then the bezels on the smaller pizel won’t be a big deal. I just got an IPhone 8 Plus and I’ve never been like “wow this phone is so unwieldy”
Why do people keep whining about no headphone jack? Like really it has 2 stereo speakers, the reason for a headphone is to make it sound louder or to stop people from hearing what you hear, if you use headphones to make it louder, you don't have to now because of those 2 stereo speakers
I can’t wait to get my hands on this phone.
I have the first Google pixel and it's utter garbage, so im definitely not getting either of these.
I want the iphone! Please!
Can anyone comment on why every video of the XL the display looks washed out.
Why are the names so dumb?
Wow was planning on getting one but it is ugly
chin and forehead are too big on the pixel 2.
That fast charging is using Power Delivery 2.0 standard that is a part of the USB Type-C spec. In order to use Power Deliver 2.0 you need to have a USB Type-C connector on both ends of the cable, so both the phone and charger need to have a Type-C port.\n\nI have no idea why Samsung and other manufactures are still using Type-A chargers and QC. Type-C Power Delivery is the way to go for charging since it can provide much greater throughput... hence the reason why some laptops are now using Type-C for charging.
2:36 your chain was proper fuckin your audio up 🤔
1:44 all of the phones he mentions here are a better buy than the pixel xl. Also, who in their right mind would buy the smaller pixel? The front looks like a nexus 5x
Good work and thank you. Can't way for mine.... hurry November
Finally people don’t have to make fun of Apple because of the headphone jack
Worth an upgrade if you have the Pixel 1?
It's nice to see Android phones getting caught up with live photo's and portrait mode. LMFAO. Next up: wireless charging and dual camera setup. Grabs popcorn
Looks like a great phone, but let's be realistic, the squeeze is a gimmick, a ton of fast ways to get to assistant, a song's name coming up on screen off when your listening to the radio (without wanting to know) is nothing short of annoying, design is not good, dual speakers are excellent, will be the fastest android, but to say xyz is excellent = not true
Yea no headphone jack no go I don't care what else it does. Sigh looks like all the new Smartphones are going to start following the dumbest trend in the industry.
It's called a polarizer, not a colorizer.
I’m a massive Apple guy, always have bought iPhones, but this pixel 2 really tickles my fancy
i'm sorry, but why do people keep criticising phones with bezels? It doesn't affect the performance of the phone and i don't see it as a significant factor? Who is going to be deterred from purchasing a phone because it has bezels? This new trend of 'bezel-less' phones has only come about over the past year, i think it's ridiculous
Pixel 2 XL is a no brainier
Notice to all cell phone companies. Please stop using excuses why you need to remove the headphone jack. Why is this a fad? It makes no sense at all.
No way it’s “7 Hours of screen time” for a 15 minute charge
i think phone companies should come out with 2 versions of the phones. one with a headphone jack and one without
I bet Google could could sell those phones for at least 100/150 eur/dollar less. and would still earn out of it... And a lot more people would choose this bit cheaper and freaking GOOD phone meanwhile the owerpriced Apple which still has only full hd unless you pay.. what.. 800?
gutted that these phones are not available in Denmark 😔
The pixel is exclusively to Verizon
Cover all the New Pixel Tech....Pixel Buds,that can translate.....Airpods can't do that. Google/Pixel Home MaXX, Ckipcam.
It's ugly i prefere the Google phone of last year
not headphone jack i would not buy i don't care ho2 good it is. that is a stupid move from Google unbelievable.
I am excited about Pixel 2 XL, but damn, I live in Latin America, and here, they don't sell those phones.\nFor Google, we are so poor and we do not cover their needs, that's why we aren't gonna see Google in a near future.\nGreetings from Mexico City, Mexico.
Men like it big too 😂😂 no homo
Pixel is better than iPhone 7. And they have a headphone ja- \nOh. Never mind.
Does it have a physical home button!?
the design is so damn ugly
It looks like cancer knocking at your door for the Pixel. The review made by Average Consumer no comments very good as always, and I think the first version of the XL and the standard one is way more better, what a disappointment Google.
Pixel XL DOES NOT HAVE AN EDGE TO EDGE DISPLAY IF SIDE BEZELS ARE NORMAL SIZED AND CHIN AND FOREHEAD ARE THE SAME SIZE AS A SAMSUNG S7
Aight this is getting kinda tough.\niPhoneX:\n Insanely better chip(basically futureproof for the next 2-3 years)\nBezelless\nFacial Recgonition\nAmazing cameras\nSiri\nGood ol IOS experience\nAR ready\nWaterproof\n\n\nPixel XL2:\nLess bezels but not as bezeless\nSignificantly weaker chip\nDual front facing speakers\nAmazing camera\nStock android(best android imo)\nGoogle assistant(which I do like more then siri)\nNew music feature\nFingerprint sensor on the back\nWaterproof\nCheaper then X\n\nDespite all these things I'm still somewhat leaning towards the X but I'm seriously digging the XL 2. I dunno, anything I missed?
note 8 and s8 has a 18.5/9 aspect ratio
Looking forward to your day in the life video of this phone.  Easily the best real world review on YouTube.
Awesome!! Stoked for the pixel too! I’ve joined your nice giveaways and I really would like to win one of the iphone 8s !! 👌👌👌
I hate how phones are starting to take off the headphone jack. Oh well
I dont like it
Both design are horrible as shit still I don't know what's going on with google thanks DBrand for exist 👏
Funny how one of their selling points was a headphone jack for the first pixel and then they got rid of it
I ordered a 128gb just black pixel xl 2 during the show. GUYS IF YOU ORDER THIS MONTH WHILE SUPPLIES LAST google will give you a free home mini. I just noticed it said that on the website today
i dreamed of having an iphone but i canot get one and if you pick me i will like an iphone 8 and my instagram is yehias3eed https://www.instagram.com/yehias3eed/\nbtw keep up the good videos and i love your content
People still asking for a headphone jack is like still asking for a vhs slot next to ur bluray player.
Will it come with the head phone?   Good review pls make more video s
is that DIRT under your nails ?? come on you are in front of camera almost all your subscriber watching you ..and you dont clean your fingers!!??  dislike for now
Holy shit why is everyone so hyped about these phones both look bloody horrendous. The people who came up with the designs should be fired immediately.

so are you suggesting you'd put chocolate with kimchi??
I’m from the Midwest USA. And we sometimes dip our fries in milkshakes so chocolate sauce on fries is not a far stretch...the quality of chocolate sauce may be the issue ƪ(^_^)ʃ

영국 놀러 갈까하는데 치안은 괜찮은가요? 유럽쪽 치안이 생각보다 안 좋다고 하던데? 피해야 할 지역은 있나요?
I guess it was originally from Japan
영쿡남좌 good 맥도날드 out....
lol :3
은근슬적더많이먹을라고검은애ㅋㅋ
우와 대박! JTBC2 채널이 생겼는데 \n영국남자 하네요~ 티비로 보니까 또 다른 느낌이에요ㅋ완전 좋아요ㅋ올리 아버지 오셔서 삼겹살 드시는 부분부터 방송하네요~완전 좋아요❤❤❤
아우..근데 뭔가 되게 안어울리는 조합이다ㅠㅠ\n이거보고 단앤조엘 김장한 영상 보러가야 느끼한거 좀 풀릴듯.
we even have those sauce packets in Australia how does the uk not have them????
아니 근데 조엘 한국어 왤케잘햌ㅋㅋㅋ 엄청 늘었어!
단을 보면 거울이 생각나요 제가 저렇게 먹거든요....
김치초콜릿이 있다는 사실을 적극적으로 알려주고 싶네요 :(
김치초콜렛 이미 만들었었어요 ..
조쉬...음...보통의 한국인은 안그렇게 먹지만 김치초콜릿도 판매되고는 있어요...ㅎㅎㅎ 나중에 김치초콜릿이랑 김초콜릿 리뷰(?) 해주세욬ㅋㅋㅋ
영국남자 출연진중에 축구 누가제일 잘해여??
단 저랑 입맛이 똑같네요ㅎㅎ\n한국말 잘 하네ㅋㅋㅋ
맛없었다는 사람이 많아서 신기하네요!!!! 저는 엄청 맛있게 먹었는데 와플후라이에 제일 잘어울려요! 로이스에서 나오는 초콜렛감자칩같은맛!!
해방촌에 어떤 버거집에 '악마의 베이컨' 이 있어요! 직접 훈제한 베이컨에 누텔라 발라서 나오는데 완전 강추요!!
단ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ death wish sauce 드립 개웃김ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
참고로 저 메뉴는 일본에서 처음 나왔었는데 한동안 엄청나게 히트를 쳐서 한국까지 오게 된거에요
한국 맥도날드 사장 여자로 바뀌고 나서 별 짓거리 다하는데 제발 이상한 짓 그만했으면 좋겠음
맥도날드 국내 이미지가 어떤지 좀 파악해가면서 컨텐츠 선정하시길... 단 시리즈도 그렇고 콜린 퍼스 등등... 요즘 진짜 재미가 없다는 거, 알고 계시길 바래요.
😂😂😂😂😂\n초코랑 감튀가 나한텐 별로 안역겹게 느껴지는데 한국인들한테는 별로 낯설지 않나봐요!\n조쉬랑 친구들이 낯설어하니까 신기하네요!
영국에 샌드위치에 트윅스라면\n한국엔 스프에 밥 말아먹는건감
단?이라는분ㅇㅇㄴㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ말투 걍 한국인아니냐곸ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개능숙해 졸귀탱ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
단짠의 마비조합이죠 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
초콜릿 빅맥.....ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
올리 : 호기심 많은 꼬마 남자 조쉬 : 상남자
조쉬 조신하게 앉아있는 거 너무 귀여워여!ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ\n그렇지..남자하면 조신이지 역시
조쉬 김치초콜릿 있는데 그것도 먹어줘봐요
앤디분께서 작곡하신곡 다시 풀어주시면안되요??\n노래너무 좋은데...\n다시 음원사이트에서 듣고싶어요!!
소스 뿌릴때 신세계를 보는듯한 표정ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
지난번에 대왕피자다먹은것도 그렇고\n단은 복스럽게 많이 잘먹어서 좋음.먹방할줄아는거같음
안먹고 있었는데 오히려 먹어보고 싶어지네요. 얼마나 이상한지 궁금해서... ㅋ
ㅋㅋㅋ 빅맥에뿌린거는 진짜 아닐듯ㅋㅋ\n조엘 중간에 급존댘ㅋ
영국남자님 타코야키도 해주세요
저거 첨보고...호불호 엄청갈릴것같다고 생각했는데... 단것은 짠것이랑 잘맞으니까 괜찮을지도 모른단 생각과 그래도 초코랑 감튀는 왠지 입맛버릴것같은 생각으로 먹기 고민되는 메뉴더라구영...
감자튀김이 전형적인 영국요리라는건 뭔소리요. 감자는 남미가 원산지로 스페인스람들이 들여와 유럽에 퍼트린 작물인데. 튀겨먹었어도 스페인에서 먼저 튀겼겠지
그게 그립닼ㅋ 그 조쉬형이 영상 젤처음에  영국남자! ㅋㅋㅋ 그거 또하면 안돼나요?
맥도날드는 신비로운 항상 신비로운 메뉴를 만드네
단 과 조엘의 입 맛이 정 반대 인가봄~~??
영국남자 보면서 느끼는건데 떠나갔던 나의 귀여운 동심이 돌아오는 듯하다...하튜~♡
단 한국말 진짜 친근해요ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 옆집오빤줄
걍 초코인데 왜 저렇게 괴로워하는거야.\n나도 단거 싫어하지만 저렇게 구역질할정도인가
오바 떨고자빠졌네 ㅎ
Can u get this in North Korea?
조쉬님 서대문형무소에 다녀와주세요 저도 다녀왔는데 조상들의 아픔을 알고 저희나라에 쓰림을 알게되었어요..
조쉬님 한국온지 몇년 됬어요

우월한 영국인이라고 자랑하나 영국남자라고하는거보니까
죄송해요 조쉬,여기 김치초콜릿이란 혼종이 있어요....\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIE13Nwn-2Q
I love the french makeup side. It looks so simple and fresh, but very classy.
French 😍😍
American eyebrow is horrible

thanks so much
Yeeee.. Dominique Cosmetics
American looks like pia wurtzbach ❤️
Excited for your eyeshadow palette!
Both are beautiful 💕💕💕
Collab with ssniperwolf please! You two look alike  <3
French 👏👏👏
French!❤ 🇫🇷
I love both!
American girls are dolllllssss
French
do american vs italiano
Both looks are so pretty! Ahhh
French much prettier
Your my inspiration ❤️❤️❤️
<3
Rien à dire notre maquillage est beaucoup mieux XD
Porn star vs Classy
Would love to see an American vs Arab makeup! The French side is so elegant and fresh! Love it! 💛
Both sides are beautiful! I think there is a time, and place for both looks. Some days I want my natural skin showing through, and a natural eye. Other days I like a bold eye look, and a cake face lol! Love this!
Your lips are so nice.
Try to do more thinner brows like the French side in your next glam video I would love to see how it looks on you.
The French side u use origins an American brand; the American side u use YSL a French brand lol
i am french, and that's completely true, french women are looking for the natural at first even for a wedding make up, but i like the american style for the creativity and the feminity.the arabic make up are more dramatic than americanBravo Christen for your demonstration
I ❤️ the French side best!
I love the French side. Lovely.
french site with american lips
I'm American and I never do my makeup like that. I like the French's preference to enhance beauty, not covering it up with layers of contour. Also let's your skin breath
What contacts are you wearing, girl? So pretty!
OKAY BUT IS THAT YOUR NATURAL EYE COLOR?! EITHER WAY IT HAS ME W E A K
this would be such a great series for ur channel!!
American make the eyebrows so natural, it's not that wired
I 100% prefer the the French makeup lmao I need to do my makeup differently
I like the French side
Fascinating. I’ve purchased a lot of makeup over the years but don’t wear it. I don’t pencil my eyebrows or curl my eyelashes. I wear only a simple moisturizer and use a fun color mascara like navy, teal, purple very lightly. And that’s it. I rarely add a touch of mauve lipstick on special occasions. And now I’m retired and have time to experiment but just don’t like it on me. Natural suits me. You are very skilled and create beautiful effects.
0:12-0:30 the guy has a Korean fetish.  Loses all credibility to comment on her look.
You  look gourgious with no makeup and full glam you r so pretty 😘😘💗💗
Americans have this obsession with young girls looking old enough for sexual relations. Thats my understanding for the porn makeup, on young girls, in america.
You could also title this Instagram Vs. Natural
The french side flatters your bone structure so well!
I live for these videos
honestly that's an insta ho vs. normal girl
Love how you argued when he didnt pick the side that you liked. Literally me and my bf 😂
I love the French side
Yes all Europeans really love this simplistic style of makeup! They sure do love mascara and lipstick more than anything
Seems like my makeup completely aligns with French makeup even though I’m not French 😂 The more you know...
French side looks so fresh and awake!!! So elegant💕🤗
what eyeliner did you use?? <3 im looking for a good one that  stays all day and is super black. I tried the kat von d tattoo one but I didnt like  it.
omg what is the music called?
Both are such beautiful looks in their own way. The French side is the style I do on my “lazy” makeup days or when I’m in a super hurry. The American side is what I like to do on the daily...cuz I’m American and I’m extra and I love makeup 💁🏻😝
Omggggg I am french and I love it so much
French side is how I do my makeup everyday
The French side is absolutely beautiful
Can't wait for Dominic cosmetics!!
the french side is so vogue...love it <3
The French actually like to mix their moisturizers in with their BB cream to give them the natural glow. But it was a great video!!
No bold eyeshadow? I can't live that life. Lol 😂
I love the French side
You should have done a neutral but fierce cut crease on the American side. And yes I do notice French are really into red lips! Lol.
This is so cool!
What shade of the YSL are you Christen? We have just about the same skin tone. U r so talented!!!!! Congrats on all of your success and I can't wait to see your makeup line!!!!!! ❤
French side all the way! That's how THIS American girl does her makeup most days! 🙋🏻 Though, I do like to play around with eyeshadows on special occasions. ☺️
The american side shows the imperfections even more in my opinion, and girl!!!! french looks amazing on you!!!!! Both looks are STUNNING honey :)
“We’re just so extra” 😂 I like the French side! #snapchatfam 🥐🥐🥐 Can’t wait for your palette!!!
I love the French !!!
Both sides look nice but I looove the French side!
Depending on the context, both work amazingly. Well done
French side all the way
Please do a full French look
FINALLY! A video about another countries type of makeup instead of South Korea!
I feel like rather than do a French look, you did a French inspired look. You got the American side on point
i love love this french look, healthy skin is the stepping stone of beauty. you should do a vlog of your visit to paris fashion week!
Very lovely. I just think it's a little amusing how you say the French don't put on eye shadow, and then proceeded to put a ton on (in my book).
I use the elf and wet n wild sharpeners; they get dull very quickly..i also use the one from Essence..it works good and does not dull as quickly..  I will be 50 next year and I have worked hard on my skin in the last few years and see a dramatic difference.  It is so much smoother and my makeup goes on so nice.  It is because of the skin care routine that I have.  You look great love as always.  Keep being positive and you will acheive so much!  Luv Ya!  :o)
What does the quad family mean? I didn't/can't find get the memo
you should do a 3am video
Can you do a full Senegence makeup?
Get this girl to 1000000 already!!!
I just found you today... where have I been?! You are gorgeous !!!!
Youre so inspiring! I love how youre always keeping it positive... this world needs more Christens. God bless you and your beautiful talent... the sky is the limit and youre on your way there. 🙌🏾❤️ #quadfam💪🏾
Yeah...... apart from the red lip with the french, them and their makeup culture can take a walk over Kilimanjaro for all I care. The U.S look rocks. So why did they create Sephora. Tsk tsk.
:) Just posted a new video on channel! Check out all of the makeup I got at Generation Beauty! Also, I’m doing a GIVEAWAY and these are the products (plus more!) Good luck to everyone 💖 #LaurellesGBGiveaway  https://youtu.be/zbmnnuv8Qlo
I love this so much! The French side is gorgeous and elegant!
I love love love when you do these videos
I kinda wish you did a full face of the French makeup 😍(only cause it's not the norm)
I actually prefer the French side...whatttt???
On the French side, I like the eyebrows and eye shadow; on the American side, I like the eyelashes and lip colour.  Can you do a video on this combination?
both sides are nice, enhance her features that she is naturally born with
Most Americans makeup doesn't look like this mostly we do natural makeup lol
I loved this video! I like both sides a lot, but I really like seeing your natural beauty shine through with the French side. You really are a beautiful girl. I cannot wait to check out your make-up line! I am so happy for you sweetie :)
I can definitely appreciate American makeup and how glam our ladies look but man, I always knew I belong in France - just so in love with simple, understated yet gorgeous makeup looks. Can't wait to see which other countries you compare to! Maybe Mexico sometime?
no trolling seriously... but I do remember a small youtuber starting this trend. I hope you can mention her in your up and coming videos that feature this concept.
Touzani I play football and i havent a good pari of shooes and i love cr7
why i think i deserve the boots?- I've been following Cristiano since intensely I was 5 years old(2005) and I adore him. I haven't missed a Madrid game in the past 3 seasons(excluding friendlies)
I wan't this shoes becuase i am 12
This is better than djmariio
I remember watching soufiane on my Nokia in 2004. Now he has a youtube channel.
This even motivate more to be a professional soccer player
If I win these boots I would be happy for the rest of my life, it would be the most treasured thing I have (other than family). If I get these boots it would make me inspired to train hard and be passionate playing the beautiful game. Thank you for this giveaway and good luck to everyone who's entering.\n\nIf I do win contact me on Instagram @juggernaught_osc or email juggernaughtoz@gmail.com\nThank you
Omg ggggggg ronaldo. I deserve these signed cleats bc ronaldo is and has beeen my soccer idol for as long as i can remember. He believes talent gets a long way and hard work will get you from there!!

Give jesus quintero the boots
Pk y'a pas de fr mdr ? Sinon continue je kiff tes videos
Ik ben vanaf kleins af aan al helemaal cr7 fan maar heb alleen maar het hele oude pakje. Ik droom er van om een handtekening/ hem een keer te ontmoeten maar dat lukt niet. Daarom zou ik de schoen graag willen.
Ik wil die wel graag zodat ik al mn vrienden kan verslaan en allemaal lekkere pannas kan geven
Deze schoenen zijn ziek mooi ze zijn geweldig en ik kan ze aan mijn broertje geven die ze heel graag wilt
ik wil die schoenen, omdat ik gescout wil worden als Ronaldo 2.0
Ik wil die schoenen winnen omdat Ronaldo gewoon een beast is
Ik verdien ze want Ronaldo wordt altijd gezien als arrogant maar neemt altijd de tijd om met de medie te praten en dat valt mij op
hey touzani  ik heb al veel van je skils gezien echt knap.\nmaar ik ben ook fan van Ronaldo alvast bedankt.
ik wil het super graag winnen omdat ronaldo beast is (en jij ook) en de kans is super klein dat je ronaldo zijn handtekening kan krijgen
Ik zou graag die schoenen hebben omdat jij gewoon een beast bent en het zijn paties van Ronaldo
Ik wil de schoenen 😊
Ik wil heel graag winnen want ik ben 11 en een meisje die ook op voetbal zit en fan van Ronaldo, ik zou super blij zijn als ik die schoenen mocht hebben(ze zijn ook mooi btw) ik wou ze al zelf kopen maar dan hoeft dat niet meer en zit er nog een handtekening op ook👍🏼. dus nogmaals ik wil ze mega graag winnen😁
Ik wel net als iedereen die schoenen winnen 😂 snap: sepdeaap insta:sep.altevogt
Ik wil die schoenen hebben ik heb nog nieuwe nodig en ben fk erge fan van cr7
5.25 is dat ronaldo's zoontje?ja toch.
Ik zou graag de schoenen willen winnen omdat ik fking fan ben van ronaldo😍😍😍
Ik wil die schoenen kei graag man Cristiano Ronaldo is mijn idool
Ik wil graag die schoenen winnen!! Want ik vindt het HEEEEEL GAAF om op zijn schoenen met zijn handtekening te voetballen
Ik wil ze heel graag hebben omdat ze er mooi uit zien
Ik wil heel graag de schoenen want ben fan van jou en van Ronaldo kwil ze heel graag
Ik zou de schoenen van Ronaldo willen winnen omdat ik d fifa Ronaldo editie heb gekocht
Ik wil heel graag die schoenen want ik heb een vriend die mij altijd helpt, hij is lief en we gaan vaak met elkaar om (ik ken hem al 11 jaar lang) en hij is gek op voetbal. Altijd zegt hij ik ben CR7 zijn skills en zijn vrije trappen doet hij na. Daarom zou ik dit als verjaardags cadeau geven aan hem want hij heeft niet echt de rijkste familie dus ik wil hem zijn droom voetbalschoenen geven die hij helaas zelf niet kan kopen. Hij is denk ik een van CR7 grootste fans en ook natuurlijk Touzani want toen je in Deventer was zij hij broer kom gaan hij is er ik wil foto en skills met hem doen (we kwamen helaas te laat), het zal hem heel blij maken als ik de schoenen aan hem geef!
Ik wil deze schoenen omdat het Ronaldo is
Ik wil de schoenen omdat ik veel voetbal maar geen nieuwe schoenen mag kopen
Ik wil graag winnen om er mee te voetballen⚽
Ik wil die schoenen Graag zodat ik mn dromen kan opvolgen en waar maken net als cr7 zelf
Ik wil de voetbalschoenen winnen omdat ik nog nieuwe nodig heb
Ik Will hem graag voor me vriend Myles hij zat bij in de klas en is weggaan van school omdat hij hoog voetbalt en hij zit nu op een speciale school en ik Will hem hier mee beloonen ik hou zelf niet heel beel van voetball
Ik moet die schoenen hebben omdat ze passen bij de bal die ik heb dankjewel alvast
ik wil die schoenen winnen mo dat ik een norme finn ben van Ronaldo hij is mijn droom
Ik zou deze zo graag willen winnen ik ben een heel erg grote fan
Ik ben al heel lang fan van Ronaldo hij was mijn  voor beeld met voetballen maar ik ben ziek geweest en moet herstellen
Ik ben heel erg van van jou en Ronaldo ik zou zo graag die voetbalschoenen willen met sok want ik ben echt fan van voetbalschoenen met sok maar ik mag ze niet van mijn vader omdat hij ze zo lelijk vind ik voetbal zelf op die old school zwarte adidas jes dus ik hoop deze te winnen voor op mijn nachtkasje ofzo
ik vind ze mooi
Ik zou de schoenen graag willen winnen, omdat mijn opa uit Spanje  jaren geleden hier naar toe is verhuisd om hier te werken. Met de schoenen zou ik hem eventueel nog thuis kunnen laten kunnen laten voelen omdat hij een paar jaar niet meer in Spanje is geweest en hij zijn thuisland heel erg mist. Sinds kleins af aan is hij al een groot fan van Real Madrid is en zeker van Cristiano Ronaldo.
Omdat de schoenen van Ronaldo zijn en dat is super vet
Ik ga de handtekening over laten schrijven aan de de klas en daar na trek ik ze natuurlijk aan
Ik wil graag winnen want ik vind die schoenen veel te hard
Ik wil ze winnen omdat ik zonder grap vannacht over hem heb gedroomd😂
Masalah broer dat je zoveel hebt bereikt
Ik wil graag winnen omdat ik dat wil
Ik wil gewoon winnen
Hallo ik zou die schoenen heel graag willen  omdat ik geen nieuwe voetbalschoenen en ik een heel groot fan van ronaldooooo 👍🏻
Die schoenen van Ronaldo moet ik gewoon hebben
Ik wil die schoenen aan mijn brier geven want hij is van van ronaldo
Yo TOUZANI ten eerste super Cool dat je Ronaldo hebt ontmoet 😱😱😱 mijn broer is altijd al een super grote fan geweest van Ronaldo ik probeer de schoenen ook voor hem te winnen op FIFA heet hij cr7 en een ander spel cr7beast hij houdt letterlijk van hem ik heb het gevoel dat hij gaat schreeuwen en zelfs misschien huilen als hij de schoenen ziet ik ga ze dan natuurlijk hem geven als ik win ik hoop heel erg dat we winnen maar als het niet lukt is het niet erg want er zijn ook super veel andere mensen die fan zijn Groetjes Thijs
Ik heb nieuwe schoene nodig
Ik zou het tof vinden als ik krijg maar waarschaanlijk krijg ik hem niet maar het lijkt me wel tof om hem tekrijgen⚽️❤️
Omdat er ronado ze hand teken ing op staat
Ik wil ze winnen omdat mijn voetbal schoenen te klein zijn
Ik wil de schoenen winnen omdat  omdat ik echt ronaldo lijk en omdat jullie mij idole zijn
Omdat de schoenen mooi zijn
Ik zou die schoen heel willen omdat ik nooit voetbal schoenen mag van mijn ouders
Omdat ik ze heel graag wil en je aller grootste fan ben
HAha 4:12 dat Ronaldo knikt als Touzani zegt dat hij skills heeft
Ik wil heel graag zijn schoenen ik ben zij en  Touzanis grootse ven
Ik wil die schoenen heeeeeeeel graag hebben want ik ben een grote fan van hem heb 4 tenues van hem.
Ik wil de schoenen heel graag omdat ik heel erg van ben ronaldo en dat ik heel veel t-shirts heb van ronaldo
Hij is stoer en ik vind het
Ik wil de schoenen hebben omdat ik ze dan aan kan doen en hopelijk later zo als Ronaldo te worden
Ik ben groot ven van ronaldo ik vond het een leuke vilmpje
Om dat Nike koel is
ik wil winnen omdat ik grotttte fan ben van Ronaldo
I want it pleas y love cristiano
Zal deze schoen gebruiken met mijn jongerenwerk.. om ze te laten zien dat je dromen kan waarmaken door middel van hard werken.. zoals jij en cr7
OMG RONALDO SHOES 😱 IT'S MY DREAMMMM
Om dat ik dan ben
Touzani ik zou de schoenen super graag willen want ik ben al superlang fan van ronaldo en ik heb nog nooit voetbalschoenen met sokje gehad en ik sil dat supergraag want me moeder vindt dat te duur en ik zag het en wist meteen dat ik hier mischien een kans had en de gene die ze dan wel wint alvast gefeliciteerd
Touzani hoe vlik je het maar even die patat zijn echt sik.
IF YOU WANT MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS SCREAM LOUD IN THE COMMENTS AND HIT LIKE ON THE VIDEO BECAUSE OTHERWISE I LIKELY WON'T I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOUS ACTUALLY ENJOY WATCHING FOR UPLOADING BETWEEN BIGGER PROJECTS OKEIS? Okeis :) ENJOY! xxx
Personality is definitely a huge reason as to why I subscribe to people. Also, I love this video, Melanie - it's like when you go out with your friends and you all get ready together, it's really nice. ❤️
LOVED THIS!
He's not gonna wanna ride me 😂😂\nMan I miss Ireland 👌🏾
You were on the same hotel floor as Prince Harry.... the envy is freaking real. Love that little ginger pr*#k. \nCONGRATULATIONS on winning such an incredible award!!!!\n\nYour short film was absolutely stunning Melanie. Plus I JUST finished your book, my Goodreads review is already up and I cannot wait to review it on youtube either!! RAVING about it I'll have you know :) \nThink your hair will look lovely long again. Yeah it's definitely all about a personality when it comes to subscribing to someone. Like with you as I mention in my book review of Fully Functioning Human (Almost), I love watching your videos because you are so open and honest, sometimes a bit too open but that is why we love you!! You're like the best friend we all wish we could have. And you cocked the Jenga up hahaha
Another great video! Any chance of the hair brushing video I requested appearing soon?
I watch people for their personalities, I like hearing their perspectives on life and the world. I enjoy some beauty stuff as well but talky and arty videos are my favourite :)
I love your videos and you!! Your short film made me cry!!! 👌🏻❤️
Congrats on the award!! you are amazing xx
I love this video!! I love it.\nAlso, you surprised me in a Dodie video! It made me smile.
So I couldn't see any comments that said what I wanted to say. \nYour film was powerful and F***ing awesome, you definitely deserved the win and I hope you had a great time at the award show.
A 58 year old couple in the US watches you because you're a lovely young lady who helps keep us in touch with what it means to be young. \n\nDuring your hair prep my wife said I didn't know you could do that. Not sure what. Think I'll find out.
SCREAMING FOR MORE LIKE THIS!! <3333
Congratulations!!!!!! So happy you won!! To be honest, I'm from Canada 🇨🇦, and I had no clue abortion was illegal in Ireland until your film! So glad you are bringing more attention to the subject!
Im so proud of you for winning that award for your first short film cause it was bloody brill and such an important topic that needs addressing!!! Xxx
I subscribe to people for their personalities mostly. It almost doesn't matter what type of videos for me. If they draw me in and I find them interesting then I'll sit through whatever content they put out! I really like channels where it's not always the same thing, but you get to see the people being who they are
I am definitely going to try that hair trick with the straightener. I am terrible at doing hair. That's my next skill to tackle. I'm getting better at makeup but hair is still way over my head. No pun intended. Haha
Your staying in the hotel I stayed in when I was in Canada!!!

Personality is the only reason I follow someone. If the personality is there, I don't really mind what the topic is.
I follow people I honestly think I could be friends with
Loving these types of videos, and I agree, I follow people more for their personalities, cos if I like them as a person I know I'll enjoy all their videos.  Congrats on the award, you really deserve it! xx
I like your chatty grwm. It's a good balance of make up and personality
I absolutely lurve these chatty grwm's where you talk about life and stuff and would love to see more!

Congrats Melanie on winning your award! I absolutely loved your film!!! Hope you had a blast in Toronto!! From one died red head to another, I feel your pain about the fade out. I product that I use and swear by the keep my red bright is the Ice Cream Hair mask. I don't know if you have it in Ireland. Literally put it on your hair (dry), leave on for 20mins then wash out as normal. I always get asked if I've re-dyed my hair after I use this stuff. Much love from Toronto!!!! <3<3<3   http://www.inebrya.it/en/products/special-treatments/kromask/cherry-red

If the people knew...: *cut*\nWe will never know... 😔
I follow youtubers for their content and humor mostly, and i subscribed to you cuz your videos somewhat have a calming effect, understandable cuz you have anxiety and you understand what's needed for us to calm down. And your enviable foods from your Food Diary Fridays. Plus, that accent 💚 who wouldve thought you've got all these interesting stories, and the causes you fight for ( physical and mental health, sexuality + lgbt, etc) made you one of my fav youtubers.
I am so proud of you for your work and for winning and ughhhhhhhhh I wish I could hug you!\nAnd yes, I too subscribe and follow people mostly for their personality. You too. <3

i was watching your video and thinking 'my god she's the same as me: get late putting make up on, gettin drunk just before an important speech, soooooo true' Thank you for being so real. And by the way, your film is amazing
Well done Mel! You smashed it. There are lots of jealous people out there, and you acknowledge that you ain't perfect (nobody is), but damn it, you put in the effort and for that you deserve it x
I subscribe for personality. Specifically with you and Hannah I'll drop everything to watch your videos, even if the topic isn't something I'm overly interested it. It's personalities.

oh shit, i’m sorry i was so awkward when you were filming!!! but it was lovely meeting you, and you are quite hilarious when you’re drunk. 💖 congratulations again on your big win!! you’re so deserving. sending lots of love your way!
I first subscribed to you when you first did your beauty videos and I do still love beauty videos (I find that they're weirdly calming and good for my anxiety, almost ASMR-like) but I've always been subbed to you for your personality.
Can people stop hating on him? He said it's NOTHING sexual so it's no big deal.  It's just his psychology based on his childhood.
is that apple juice in a bottle? yum i wany some
This is what happens when you start letting people identify as whatever they want. Fucking pathetic.
At least he don't rape or kill anybody
Looks like the guy from Peewee movie
poor guy his childhood probably suck and he wants to remake it... hopefully he grows out of this phase one day so he can start a family
1:16 I HAVE THE SAME EXACT STUFFED ROTWIELER DOG that's so weird. Literal same one.
Wtf is this shit wtf is his fat ass doing
Omg, when the girl got involved it got so fricken cringey
Isn't it weird that he kida acts like a baby perfectly
It's obviously they're having sex
What In The Actual Fuck Did I Just Watch
That woman is almost as sick as the man-baby!!
I’m sorry but, hell to the no
This video makes me want to be a child again
I wonder if he didn't get fired from work after this.
The lady should be discourage him from acting like this
That’s boys on dope. Look at those eyes
“White people have no culture”
When he asks you if you want to go chill at his crib, he literally means it!
What the fuck is this giant loser.
Oh well ..let him live his life ...
I thought when the woman came in it was gonna be a weird fetish porn😂
yo this nigga is wild tf is wrong with him
This cannot be real
0:11 I have the same dog plush in the background lmao
Imagine feeling so overwhelmed by the world that you resort to this...poor guy.
Man imagine how they celebrate his birthday
When she said that he had a TWIN BED before the transformation to a crib, i thought about an episode of family guy where stewie says,  if you have a twin mattress aren't you pretty much a failure as a human being and it made me laugh
He looks like when he gets mad he starts hitting people
I want that girl to take care of me 😏
I mean the guy ant  wrong babbys are safe
His bird is so beautiful!
The cringe of this video is too much
Okay... why the hell did this show in my recommended?
I fell so bad
Is this a joke😂
Wanna know how there is no God? This fat fuck is still breathing while good normal people died vegas
That mom probably fucks the adults she takes care kf
autism and special ed right here
i thought this was my 600 lb life at first
Must need a mega amount of butt paste !
Mums this feels like a start of a porno
How does me make money
This is actually so sad. I’m under the impression he was probably abused as a child and has a lot of attachment and abandonment issues resulting in him acting like a baby to make up for all those years he lost.
the sad part is that i have those pjs but smaller
He looks extremely ill physically mentally and spiritually
this Makes my heart feel Happy
Do they try to help him or do they just stalk him and let people judge him
I don't find it too weird. I mean, It's not too bad. If its what he likes that's alright no judgement from me. I mean he isn't hurting anybody so it shouldn't a problem.  It's ok to like weird things.
im friends with him on facebook
the guy is looking at her like stfu you slut and suck my dick xD
both the adult baby and the mommy' are whack jobs
This is just an excuse to skip out on the struggles of life.
This is so disturbing
What am I watching, this mans hella weird
Is it me or does the lady on the video look like Harley Quinn
I think it’s healthy for him to relive his early childhood where he does it his own way after having a traumatic one. He’s not hurting anyone and it’s therapeutic.
All I have to say is WTF has the world come to 😑
5:00 what I wrong with her
You Are How Old
“Aw how old is he?”\n“372 months”
i dont see a problem here. he obviously had a fucked up childhood and suffers a mental illness. at least he isnt out killing people. seriously...would you rather he be murdering or acting like a freaking baby?
Ha s jde and comfortable but my question is how does he go shopping how does he gets his money does he pay his bills?
Kinda sad,  but it's cool how he can make all that furniture himself.
That’s enough internet for me tonight...
I didn’t even no shit like this was a thing😂😂😂
I have no words
Sick weirdo
They fuckin
This is freakin insane.
Cannot fathom
Wtf did I just watch ????!!
Who changes his dippers?
this nigga a virgin😂
Creeper
*Thinks of Jaboody Dubs*
Talk about babying your kid
What the hell
Yeet df.
That damn crib is gonna break
disgusting
I call pacifiers 'nooks'
W......T........FUCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
OMG the high chair
What a fuck!
What the fuck
Constant hugs from mommy lmao child polestar
Mommy issues?
This is so cringe
Imagine baby sitting him
Boi
Laughable illness.
This is fucking weird!
This is crazy.
White people
It's destruction dayyyyy, HEHEHEHH.
They have sex
This is sickening 🤦🏾‍♀️💭🤔
Tbh, I do get the 'feeling safe in a crib' thing..🙈

She has a strange sex appeal. Don't get me wrong; she's attractive of course.  Very feminine but when she rocks the guitar, she combines a unique blend of femininity and masculinity (if that makes sense). Love her music, especially her last album.
The A E S T H E T I C on the video makes it even better. So ready for Masseduction
in partnership with my blue balls
3:14 makes me to imagen the perfect sweet & nasty fantasy.  Yeahhhh!!!
What Goldfrapp should be sounding like today.
Sarkistic talent with taste. Such a mess)) but I feel in love ... I'm going to masturbate ...
This is very unhappy music
She can punch me in the face and I'd thank her.
I love how when she winks it's just a blink. <3
Well that was artsy. I want cake now.
1:29 is that who I think it is?! OAO
this sounds so much like The Kills, so good
If I were more of a lesbian Annie would totally dig me.  I saw her last year, killer
She seems more focused on cultivating the St Vincent persona than writing great music\n\nGreat chorus though
if trent reznor had been born xx instead of xy.
Did any notice the Brazil (movie) reference in the video or is it just me?
her normal person costume is great
St. Vincent's songs Also music videos are pure art !!!! 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
A E S T H E T I C
It would be an honour for St Vincent to step over my face in those heels
at the very end, meeting David Byrne did not help out
Man, she's really serving on the aesthetics this era
kind of a chanel advert from terry gilliams brazil
Face stretch scene is from Brazil. It's good but I like St. V older stuff.
This song explains my life in vivid detail.
Hot damn what a track
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HER (WDSLM) youtu.be/MYm9bJUHN08  #stvincentfan
the irony here is she is becoming everything she hates
somebody knows which are that glasses??? pleaseee
Definitely her biggest chorus, this one might be the one to cross over to pop radio
Our queen, Annie, is just one of those people that just looks better with age. Annie is only 35 now but she looks amazing!!!
I kinda miss when Annie used to shred on her guitar. I don't really hear any of her in the music anymore beside her humor
all I need in life are more white musicians that aren't afraid to use bass😍😍😍😍
How do you describe this unique guitar sound??
why is it only new music that trends on YT, get some old music trending!
she sold out
Amazing
i love you

Excellent!  ...But I did want see you play the guitar solo from the studio track!
Let me write 'Los Angeles'... oh shit, forgot the 'N'... oh well, let me just write a 'S' at the end... 'Los Ageless'... phew, that was a close one, amirite?
i demand a collab with helen marnie of ladytron please
St. Vincent did that. \nLos Angeles = cancelled \nEveryone ageless and shook
Beautiful. This is one of the best music videos of yours!
enjoying very much how the colors remind of the digital witness vid. even though this is awesome in so many different ways.
I love her guitar. One of the coolest new  guitar shapes in a long time.
2017 is the year of pastel
A 165K view music vid and it's on trending? Yeah, this is definitely not promotion... definitely not...
She’s having so much fun
damn look at all the mr meeseeks.
some parts are a tribute to the plastic sugery scene from Brazil by Terri Gilliam
So this video is here talking shit about white rich women that live in low angeles.

Ola st. vincent estoi mui triste porque no me dejan ver tus vídeos porque no e echo la tarea
I dunno, soundwise I think this was done better by Garbage twenty years ago and the message of the song while valid isn't the most original either. I give it a *shrug* out of five (with a small plus for all the colours).
Questo pezzo è semplicemente orrendo dalla prima all'ultima nota. Banale e tamarro. Tornatene a casa,  sei sempre peggio.

The video is fascinating 🙈
The production is awful. The song writing is here or there, but getting Taylor Swift's producer wasn't worth it. :(
A little too close to Nine Inch Nails.
is this song about cara delevingne?

How could this Jason dude ever face anyone after deserting his fans in the way that he did.He did not even say ONE WORD let me repeat myself not ONE WORD to the bewildered crowd.How dare YOU not to hide your head in the sand with shame.Your fans needed you.You had a chance to be a MAN but you chose to be a coward.HOW DARE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!!!
NOTICED!! His last words of the song was no show  and he ran off after stage.  #illuminati 🎰🏟🏰🎆🌃📺💵🔨🚷
I don't know much about weaponry, but does that sound like a paintball gun?!
The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” MLK \nJason “Bolt” Aldena wiithout so much as a word to the ~22,K fans standing there not knowing what is going on and being shot down. He had loudspeakers and the attention of the concertgoers, he could have and should have crew to kill the lights, we need first responders, stay calm and move to the exits, take cover, say something - say anything. He said nothing and ran. \n58 perished, 489 people injured. Prayers to the families who've lost loved ones'.
Cant blame him for not stopping immediately, lot of people thought it was fireworks at first...
That ain't no Goddamn 'bump fire'. That is belt fed Army shit.
Every shot you hear is a life changed forever. Sickening to watch.
This video shows nothing, you can hear.
Im kind of mad at how the country singer on stage runs off to seek shelter like a scared child. Leaving fans thinking WTF. Just my opinion if anybody feels the same speak out.
I can't help but wonder how much of a difference it would have made in the shooters' ability to aim at and hit the crowd if the stage lights were not shining upon the crowd during the second volley of fire. \n\nIn this video (https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=c96_1507108754), they finally turned the lights off - several minutes after the shooting stopped. As the guy filming the video states, that just made it more difficult for the EMTs to find and help the wounded.
Our world is so messed up
makes me not want to go to concerts.
what is the name of the song he was performing when the shooting began?
What is so unsettling is this\n     These homeland attacks are going to keep happening. The media, certain politicians, and a select few branches of government are responsible for the poisoning of our minds, and the taking of our financial security are just two of the things that are pivitol in the breakdown of the shooters state of mental health. I am NOT WARRANTING what happened, however unless ALL OF US don't stop being hateful , and getting involved on a municipal level attacks like this are going to keep happening. To me this was just a small version of 9-11. ALL SECURITY MEASURES ON A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL SHOULD BE TREATED AS IF THE PRESIDENT IS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU. ANY PLACE WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PRESENT , THERE SHOULD BE A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL OF SECURITY..... IN 2004 when Dimebag Darrell Abbott was killed on stage in Columbus, Ohio during a concert should have prevented any security fails such as this
What a sick world we live in.😞

How could you even play his music now? You saw how his  beta ass ran off stage. I'll smack the shit outta him if I ever saw  that chicken Shit bastard
The sad thing is I didn't even feel shocked hearing the gunfire.
I hope that guy suffers for all eternity, to take a life is to sin.. to take that many lives.. fucking coward
if live bullets after 1 min stampede. Crisis actors again.
This is what World War Three looks like.
Hmmm Are we already in Hell?
*EVERYONE* who always shooting up places full of innocent people & have commited the biggest massacre in American History? \nA) Muslims\nB) Mexicans\nC) Blacks \nD) Whites\n*No.2 Pencil Only*
Im glad i live in a gun-controlled country... Its so safe and peaceful here..
This is absolutely disgusting what happened, now if he was a Muslim the first thing would have been ‘terrorist’ but this guy is a ‘lonewolf’ and ‘disturbed’.
What song is that
i have goosebomp all over my body...i cannot understand the acharment of this mass  killing ,not shooting once but repeativiley. twisted  mind  and heartless monsters. . whos behind it? i do not believe  anymore in appearance. and what medias say. who ever is behind that atrocity  will face karma
So they turn on the floodlights so the shooters can see who to shoot! Wake up people ! there are three or more shooters!
Why would anyone like this video
Hey Guys! This Is Great! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 ℕ𝔼𝕋𝔽𝕃𝕀𝕏 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 𝔾𝕚𝕗𝕥 ℂ𝕒𝕣𝕕 Here – >  #Likefreecardsgetitnow
Johhny Cash on stage:  Shoot at me Devil! I'm the man in Black!
Not a terorist eh? I wonder why ?
Call it for what it is Terrorism
He runs off stage like a little bitch! He doesn't even warn the crowd! THEN they turn all the lights on the auduence! What? So the killerS can see their targets? WTF???????
I think Islam is behind this.
Time just ended a video of a mass shooting telling me to sub? Holy shit
Body armor is gonna gonna be the new fashion
Sounds like the OTrauma and The Dump Administration are not doing anything on those Gun Laws!
the panic in their voices...
Hey everyone don't get mind tricked by the elite group they want us to lose
obviously the two shooters in mandalay bay hotel were distractions. there's no way they could inflict that much damage; wound 500, & kill 57 from 400 yards in the dark at an almost impossible angle shooting down with sniper precision wake up people!!!!!!!!!!!! To me, and this my opinion that second  flurrie was return fire. but here's  the real this probably the most surveyed city in the world meaning cameras are running and recording 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 a year 10 years a decade. To me the real question is where's  the footage and what about the other shooters at the other hotels?\n\n\nAnyone who was really there or has footage that hasent been edited get at me  \nthere may be some money for u.\n\n\n\nfatboi3025@gmail.com
So sad 😭what kinda a world we are living right now huh ??? Can't even felt safe anymore these days don't know what the heck will be happens next 😢
But not all the light..... red light ok
Aldean had a responsibility to warn his audience of the gunfire and to take cover  before running for cover himself.
Leave it to TIME to leave a subscribe reminder at the end of this horrifying video.. classy folks, real classy
Why tf would you get down? Like do u want to die?
You would think that someone would get on the mic and say people need to exit or something. Because it took a while before people realized what was going on.
WHY DIDNT THE SINGER SAY RUN OR GET DOWN. HE JUST RAN OFF ONLY CARING ABOUT HIMSELF
No idea whatsoever who this Aldean fellow is, or why anyone would want to watch him on stage, but to each his own, I guess. Also, seeing as this is a false flag op, isn't he in on it as well? Pretty cowardly how no one in charge gave any direction whatsoever.
Wish trump was in this crowd and hit
I hear tickets are on sale now for the next country music festival feauturing jason aldean wearing a jogger suit and running shoes (poor Jason almost tripped last time running in boots)
Problem is noone knows what actual gunfire sounds like.  People, it sounds like fireworks from afar, you get that cracking sound the closer the bullet is to you.  These days, DUCK AND FUCKING COVER, then locate the source and evac.  Arg, im so mad..   fucking asshole.
So fucking disgusting . These days people can't even go to concerts with their family. They went there for fun and then they get killed , That's so sickening
My question is why they turn the lights on so the shooter can have a clean look?
He really give him self for free will to Evil Hell sick man 😠😠
MY QUESTION IS WHY DID THE LIGHTS GO ON?????????????
This guy Aldean is a coward in my eyes. He gave no warning, no hint or clue as to what was happening or why he ran; he just left... kinda like to say, screw this and screw you guys... I'm out...! Boycott his country ass...!
Oh my God!!!!! What can I say, I am just so heart broken and in deep pain and thoughts how people can be so evil to perpetrate such heinous act. I can't even watch the video and my heart is so bitter and heavy for  innocent children who now have to live the rest of their lives without parent. OMG!!!!!! My heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved. May the almighty comfort them and keep them safe.
My sympathy to all victims and their families  from iran
Holy f.ck I didn't know it was a full auto assault rifle
This is not what Jason wants to be remembered for omg
This is part of American culture it’s nothing new, it is sad that good people lost their lives.
To any Americans offering thoughts and prayers: if you actually care, do something about your gun laws.
Why in the eff did they turn that stage light on? What the mother f**k?
THIS STUFF HAS TO STOP!!! so disturbing .......
This is tragic but why would anyone pay money to watch such a boring musician perform, or was it free?
Nanny nanny boo boo!!!
Why did the stage crew turn the bright lights on the crowd?
I get Goosebumps when I hear the guy say  oh ho!
The graphics is amazing .-. I can't see a thing :(
I wonder if the bump-stock salesmen feel proud today.
Don't worry. We'll keep telling ourselves guns aren't the problem and not a goddamn thing will change. And that's exactly what we're going to say the next time this happens, as it will, within a few weeks or months.
.shooter worked at lockheed martin? the missile bomb place?.
I bet hollywood is gonna make some money out of this tragic event.
Why wasn't an announcement made?!?!?!?
Where's the close up? Bait!

Should have shouted to his fans ,shots have been fired
HEY TIME !! YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT -- RIGHT ?? THE VIDEO OF THE 2ND SHOOTER ON THE 4TH FLOOR -- AS CONFIRMED BY THE LVPD DISPATCHER. DON'T EVEN TRY IT -- OK ??

*road to tactical nuke*
God bless you

Thanks God

An american terrorist
Americans killing Americans.
That's disturbing
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for ya?
this is bullshit......if a gunman sprayed a crowd, where are the casualties? The band leaves and nobody does anything because nobody was shot. If people were being shot down, there would have been way more panic and way more screaming as people died.
He has a mic, realizes what's going on and never once uses it to yell RUN, before exiting???????????? hmmmm.....
God i love Jim
Jim Carrey - I have no needs, I don't need you people (points towards those who've helped gained him his $$$ gaining him the luxury of a worry-free life in terms of income, bills, and financial security). Like many of you, I have grown up adoring JC (and still do, less so after this). And while I know every celebrity has his/her own baggage and is well within their right say what/how they feel, Carrey is now coming off as not just a narcassist, but a complete sociopath. If he were to donate all his earnings to a charity (or multiple charities) and THEN say how he needs no one, I'll listen...until then, I'm tuning off.
He seems scared... to the point where he doesn't want to care about anything anymore, for some kind of comfort. Something seems very insecure for someone who is 'enlightened'. I'd like to see more interviews from him to see how things change. Hopefully the guy is alright, god knows we put so much pressure on celebs nowadays.
Everyone laughs out of either being polite or afraid, either way its bullshit! Norm laughing out of being nervous proves how fearful of Jim's reaction has broken Norms hope of a real discussion.
I have no needs.  Right. Thanks to the fact that you spent 50 years acting like a clown and now have hundreds of millions of dollars to live on. How much did you pay for your coffee?
This adam guy is so painful
I was on the floor at the dog part.
One point to counter the Jim Carrey is an obnoxious asshole is the fact that they lit his face so he would LOOK horrible. Why would the Norm people do that? Maybe it's all a set-up, a bit.
is it all about the numbers? tv numbers, 33 numbers, the round cycle, the chain, backpain youre on the 32, and if you pass the pain, the backpain mind pain, cut off the signal like using drugs, but being able too do it, with the power of thinking, then you rise.
This guy can suck my dick.  Norm and Jim great job
@52:18 Norm's best joke of the night.
How is everyone calling this guy a narcissist? Sounds to me like people are projecting themselves on to good ol JC here because they lack that level of openness, mental acuity and personability. Get real tubetards, this character is a genuinely good guy.
I want to spend a day with Jim!
I always knew Jim Carey was an incredibly gifted physical comedian, but to see a man so far up his own ass is really something.
sooooo many YouTube armchair psychologists in the comments here
Norm says: all you've needed is a little trail mix and a hooker in the limo... Jim ignores the comment  @ 24:16
The combination of Jim's craziness and Norm's easygoing personality is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Clearly he is hurting...love him still tho
I think a lot of you confuse Jim's attempt to humor people with ego
Whoa! Some of you are pretty mean toward Jim... Isn't he just some dude who some found funny... he then rose to fame, and now seems to seek Purpose... and as a result can sound a little weird? Whatever he may be after, I hope he finds peace.
IGNORE ME! I'M NOT EVEN HERE! IGNORE ME!
Very disappointed with this show, everyone was talking over each other for the most part. There were things Jim Carrey wanted to say and wasn't able to finish and things Norm wanted to say and never got to finish. ughhhhhh It was a little uncomfortable watching them because it seemed that they annoyed each other by all the interruptions.
Seinfeld is 100x more enlightened than this crazy bastard lol
I love how Jim pretends to be outside of the self, yet he always wants to be the center of attention lol. GTFO.
Poor Norm.  Jim is a looser whose lost his mind.  There's something wrong with him.
is the river of tears like when he fucks his intern and gives her herpes and she runs away bawling?
jim carrey is kinda nuts 4 real, seriously, he IS a monkey who does impressions, just be satisfied with it, no need to be so pretentious
If everybody is a zombie there's no zombie apocalpyse
Jim Carrey is spouting off very rudimentary philosophical points. Pretty much sounds like something stoned teenagers would contemplate. He seems somewhat lost or suffering, either has lost some weight and it is showing in his complexion. He doesn't look to be aging well.
Just look at what the Jews did to this guy
note to self, never have jim carry back on the show.
Big mouth and small mouth together at last
26:12 - 27:05 Adam Egret brings the show to a screeching halt
So awful to see your childhood hero being sick :( FeelsBadMan
I want to hang out with Jim (and Norm, of course). \n\nFuck the Frills!
dont judge an actor by his fame in america,\nwhen you go to Europe or Asia latin america Russia Germany etc i mean  aLLover  the world do  not know about seth rogan ,Joanna hill ,Adam Sandler, jerry Seinfeld  or etc of untalented performer but definitely all over the world know about jim carry .
I didn't appreciate him joking about kicking that Frenchie.
And this is what you turn into after making a movie with penquins
A cheap bare bones set -yet so many people listed in the credits Can't Norm get  Lori Jo to produce a podcast and cut out the middlejews like Sarah Silverman and Michael Cera.
I wonder if Carrey ever sees the irony of what an egotrip it is for him to constantly remind everyone he has no ego
51:27 holy shit that was genius
that 'not a person' thing was starting to get annoying
I really enjoyed this, but did the people in the background laughing sound really fake to anyone else and ruin the atmosphere a bit?
Low level comments here. Jim is a boss, remember that.
Man, nothing like that happened when I was a PA.
He has put a smile on your faces. Why hating him?
wtf is he talking about? seriously!
The dog part was killllin me!
who has tried the coffee
Norm's hat is really cool! Go Wings!
The ONLY ads on YouTube I don't skip after five seconds. \nFor Normy baby!
Jesus says in Matthew 19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\nKJV Bible
I actually thoroughly enjoyed this, two old friends sitting down and having multiple conversations in one. I followed it all (might be ADD) and they genuinely enjoyed each others company. I understood what he was talking about and thought this was funny. Idk maybe Jim's new outlook is an acquired taste that only some can handle. to each thier own man.
I guess he wasn't too bad with his Trump rhetoric, but what does Hollywood do to people to turn them into such irrational people that spit on half of their audience? Anyhoo, I thought Carrey went full looney toons. Glad to see he seems to be doing well.
Norm used the English word Forte with the proper pronunciation!
Is the coffee drink recipe : bulletproof coffee , Cacao and MCT oil ? I want to make it!
So sad that Jim stepped on Norm's Albert Fish bit :(
jim carey has a never ending supply of percocet
Best guest that Norm every kept stepping over. Imagine if Jim could have continued talking every now and then. :-) He even interrupted Jim to tell that same old Peter Sellers line about Laurel Hardy, which he apparently has to tell every guest. :-)
How much Terrence McKenna influence has rubbed off all over Jim?
Jim Carrey needs to chill out.
This “There is no me” Jim Carrey is only tolerable with Norm, imo.
You can buy it at your friendly, neighborhood GNC.
Note to self: Jim Carrey is still completely obnoxious and desperate.\n\nI wish Norm had said this into a tape recorder during the interview.
Does thus mean something, all while I'm shaving my ballzz, ,& ass crack while listening & watching??😁😉 Hummmm
the show about nothing ,stupid  and boring
Jim drank the non-dual kool-aid. Toxic presentism claims another victim.
A ton of great interviews this season but this one even beats out Dana, Dave, and Jerry. It's dynamic and Jim is unquestionably engaging.
It's like watching an uncle you really loved slip into dementia.
YES! wait a second............ This is  weird.
32:20 I love norms reaction here! reminds me of his role in Dirty Work
Get Conan!!
Classic Om Macdoald
20:52 CELL PHONE ZOMBIES! so true
Joking about pedophilia, nice...
This is amazing
They are on Jash,,,badass
Jim looks Kevin bacon now. Kevin Canadian bacon...
Good fellows 2
wtf happened to Jim...
get bill Braski on ffs
Jim Carrey is nuts
God bless Norm MacDonald!
That was great.
23:40\n\nWhatever, Eckhart Tolle.
Steve Martin!
Clarified not purified butter.
Love you all
Hell I thought Jim Carrey died .
👌🏻👌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Sorry girls Jim just gave you herpes.
egret is fat
table looks pretty wobbly...just sayin'
Norm got out Normed By Jim lol
We need Dave Chapelle
Norm is a fucking idiot.. all his guests should do the Joe Rogan Experience instead of wasting they’re time talking to this mongoloid idiot.. listening to Norm interrupt every 7 seconds like a 3 year old is fucking gross.. completely undeserving of all the subscribers and views..
Dave Chappelle
I'm glad I watched this and didn't just listen to it as a podcast. Probably would have drove me nuts.
jim is what happens when u no longer have needs.
love you guys! both are huge inspirations for many funny people
? Was it a computer game
You guys teased this so long ago and everything thought it was just to show off the engine nothing but a meaningless clip but god am I happy I saw an ad for this been waiting a long time for what I didn't know was comjng
That was top notch - great job!
Too short.. i need more.. awesome storyline. Keep going please.
woooow I always wanted to know what the first Adam movie was all about.....thanks. That bad ass main cyborg with the heavy voice  will be a perfect villain character for a new type of star wars movie. If I had the money I'd buy some of their ideas...
I want to become fully synthetic.
this was made by oat studios? geez, im hooked now
Damn it give me more!
Make this a thing I don't care if it's a movie a show or a game just make it into something
So glad I found this channel! Love all your work guys
How did they made that brilliant ground on the desert? So detailed
i either want a movie or a game. \nyou guys have the makings of a remarkably awesome story. just dont fall into the usual plot cliches please. dare to be different like you already are.
YESSSSSSSSS I SAW THE AD AND IMMEDIATELY CAME FOR THE VIDEO
Love Oats, but this one was bland. Dick riders join the orgy below.
Every years for every 5 minutes of this??? I can't live...
A game that is RPG type you start as those wearing orange guys until you you end up like those OP dude.\n\nPlease be a game!
I'm really hoping that this leads up to a full movie or an OATS Studio game
Please make this a movie
This is what you can do when you work outside of date deadlines and time pressure such as big commercial cinema stuff.  (not to say it hasn't pulled out good stuff, but still.)
the credit music is even awesome...
Music in the end?
Night of the living dead with robot zombies. IS THERE NOTHING NEW? Let us group masterbate over derelict anthologies. Another horizontal platform with marching sprites. A mental lobotomy turned abdominal panniculitis. I hope you are offended...
I can't believe. <3
awesome, the only videos i watch on full screen!! amazing
Neill Blomkamp is the hero we need and the hero we deserve.
Wouldn't they know who they are if the big guy hadn't disabled their screens?
I never thought I'd see a follow up to that Adam animation, oats studio continues to be one of the best things on YouTube
Good to see that unity demo from 2014 got a follow up
I want like 50 movies
Fuck this is so good
Excellent! Thanks by the Spanish subtitles! Gracias.
OH MY FUCKING GOD... you did that with unity, MORE MORE MORE
I want a game
God damn. BLOMKAMP YOU DONE BOMB ON YOUTUBE YO
You guys are amazing, im promoting the hell out of you guys to all my fb friends and groups
Im like wtf? Is that it?
Fuck me with a koala that was amazing shit.
Too short. Of course, an Oats Studios video could be 5 hours long and I'd still say it's too short.
My god, this is sooo good!! I want more episodes, movie, or a video game pleeease!!
Took you a year to publish this, oh well.
episode one was perfect, this one talked too much that could’ve been shown visually.
Y'all should make a video game..I would love to play this
These guys should make video games!!!
Looks good, but...\nWhy the fuck are the robots making breathing noises? Seems like a VO oversight.
*more than a short film
We NEED a feature length film
I remember that this started out as an engine trailer where it showed them being released from the walls into the wilderness. I made a whole theory about them being convicts striped of the body's and forced out as punishment to wonder. And I was dead on!!!!
i made a cube
Why is his channel so unrated,  This man deserves  at least 5 million subscribers
we want the movie
Unity id s Powerful Technolgy for creating original content!
See that very Mcneal-looking bot!
My GOD it can be a really cool Animated series or a full movie depends on Oats Studios idea :) Hope U guys keep this story rolling :)
Neil why are you such a damn tease everything you make is so good and yet it never evolves further
It must be made in to a full movie. Would be a world wide sensation...
We got a sequel to that one short film, awesome
Why not make this a feature film
For fucking sake... MAKE A MOVIE ALREADY!\n\nPlease.
Hey Add Turkish subtitles please 😒😒 but very nice chapter 🙏
Finally a good one! by far the best one so far!
YAAAAASSSS!!!!! This is the best thing that's happened to the world this year.
This is really unexpected. I loved the original Adam unity demo, and seeing this just brings me joy.
I am literally watch the credits. This is so awesome!
Boo, too much subtext in the script. Oh well, looks good though. :)
We need to keep up the hype so it gets developed into a feature length game/movie. Remember Kara?? We got Detroit... This looks so much more amazing!
If this shit turns out to be an actual game, it's gonna be awesome
Why the dislikes ? I want Oats Studios to make this into a feature film.
Спасибо за русские субтитры)
rendered in Unity!
Wonderful !
best graphics as usual
Dreams do come true
M8 Robots don't breathe.
Reminds me of Blame!
My body need MOAR

The next chapter arrives soon. HALLELUJAAAAAAAAAAH
Blomkamp is a genius
What's the final song after the credits? Please, if anyone knows. thanks¡\nAlguien sabe cuál es la canción final? minuto 4:20 y la de post creditos 5:28 ?????? gracias¡
это блять шедеврально
OMG!!! Awesome!!! =)
Holy Crap!! This is insanely brilliant!!!
I don't care nor do I want to know the name of the actor to play a character , as long as they can bring the that character to life.
First Aladdin movie- Robin Williams- Did good\nSecond Aladdin movie- No Robin Williams- Did bad\nThird Aladdin movie- Robin Williams- Did good\ni'm not surprised.
Can we all appreciate that the video of him accepting the speech had a moment panning to will smith. Let the conspiracy theories begin
#disneybaby hey any news a bout the baby
I actually never look at who the voices for characters are 😂 but have noticed the character always resembles their voice actor
I don't think it should matter. If they are in the movie they are in the movie. I kinda agree... it kinda takes the magic from it. I mean I don't remember who voiced ariel but she is my all time fave disney princess. She stays ariel not name of actress as ariel. Plus young kids aren't going to care so why do it to get the parents into it?
Nah man the 3rd Cinderella movie is one of the best sequels for Disney
I don’t think it’s a problem to market that way. But i don’t think they should choose just because they’re “famous” i think if an actor is good and fits the part, they should get it over a famous person who is alright at the part.
I am trying to think of a way for a live action genie to not look so stupid. I don't think the movie will suck, but Disney has to nail the genie's look. I am thinking of the pretty bad CGI Beast, and then the really old style of painting someone blue. I just cringe thinking of how bad it could get.
named ariel and belle's voice actor off the top of my head. dont play me J.
How much time do you guys look up info on these things? How long does it take you to tape these and edit them? You put so much time and effort into it. I love it!
When you said voice actor for belle I screamed HERMINY GRANGER
Aladdin doesn't need to make sense.  It's not a real story. It's just something the guy at the beginning  was telling us so we would by some lamp.
robin williams is by far da BEST ACTOR EVER!!!\n0:23\nWHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAA?!?!?!?
I love Judy Kuhn as the singing voice of Pocahontas. She's amazing
um, YES I can name the voices of Ariel and Belle! Jodi Benson and Paige OHara!
Jodi Benson was Ariel. I love her so much
Jay: I mean, do you know the voice actors of Ariel? Or Belle? \nMe, I, my house all alone: Jodi Benson! Paige O' Hara!
Can u do a Bambi theory about how his mom died plz!!!
I really like Josh Gad, not just for Olaf (though he nailed that) but also for Lefou (probably spelled that wrong) in Beauty and the Beast and as Ludlow in Pixels
I can name Ariel and Bells' voice actors. Come on. They are classic characters. \n\nThe voice actors shouldn't matter (for the same reason you don't like them). Robin Williams was, is and will always be the *only* exception.
I've always hated the use of big names for voice actors. I first noticed it in Shrek and by Shrek 3 it was just a gimmick to promote a crappy movie: Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake were dating, so the latter voice acted in the movie. It didn't make the writing not suck. Compare those regular actors to voice acting legends like Hank Azaria or John Dimaggio too - those guys can do anything. Dimaggio was Bender in Futurama, Wakka in Final Fantasy X, and Jake in Adventure Time. He's massively talented and incredibly diverse. Few regular big name actors have the ability to use a voice other than their own (though Jason Segel isn't too bad). I feel like using big names has overshadowed these amazing talents and they aren't usually as good as the trained voice actors.
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
Big name actors of just to get you in the theaters
I love King of Thieves
Mork & Mindy ended in 1982.  Robin Williams didn't have a hit movie till Good Morning Vietnam in the late 80s.
This is one the popular tricks in the whole entertainment industry. Like how kpop idols get featured in all the variety shows and cast in all the dramas, even though their main job is singing and dancing, not acting.
Favorite voice actor in a Disney movie, Frank Welker as the cave of wonders in Aladdin
Honestly, I agree that it can be a distraction to know who voices what. However, that being said, I did see Dwayne as Maui had a singing part, and instantly went to go check out any youtube footage I could find, because I grew up when he was a super popular wrestler, and I couldn't imagine him singing. Now, I can. A+
Robin Williams was the BEST Genie ever!
Think it’s time to rank the renaissance movies and all the straight to DVD sequels.
If Robin Williams wasn't the Genie, Aladin would never have worked as a movie, may have even bombed
any comment that there a shot of Will Smith in Robins acceptance speech? just a cool moment.
You should do a video series on Zoids: New Century. Love the anime. Also Full Metal Alchemist.
Was your plan to bribe someone that demanded to be paid less...? (6:23)\nThe way he said that, so great. I can just see how that would have played out, Robin Williams was the man.
I miss Robin Williams more than I miss most family members...
I think, at least for the musicals, Disney shouldn't focus so much on getting big-name actors since some actors can't sing, so just get a decent singer and make them famous.
I wish they would have lesser known actors voice parts/act in parts more often. I find it distracting most of the time (Emma Watson as Belle, The Rock as Maui, or Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone in La La Land...all examples of roles that I wish would have been cast to lesser known individuals because their fame was distracting to the part. I am aware La La Land isn't Disney, but it fit what I was discussing). Also, most of the time these celebrities already have plenty of work outside of these films. So...give the little guys a chance! lol
HOW have you guys never done a Welcome To NightVale video??!!
Tbh I always thought that having big name voice actors/actresses was to interest the parents.
I always found Robin Williams to be highly obnoxious personally. He never did make me laugh and I think he was one of the many overrated celebrities in the world. He was a good actor but definitely overrated.
You guys are amazing and super talented but you need to put one of your faces on the thumbnail. we love the content but we watch because we love you so much!😉 Philip DeFranco started putting his face in his thumbnail and he got a huge jump in views per video and never stopped doing it... now put those sexy faces up there!
just because you mentioned it, you guys now need to rate all of the disney sequels.
You guys should do another harry potter video
My favorite is Frank Welker. He has such an amazing talent voicing so many non-human characters such as Scooby Doo, Abu from Aladdin, Soundwave from Transformers and even Nibbler from Futurama!
You guys should do a video on who the mother of Max goof is/goofy's wife...I've always wondered that
And yes, Will Smith was at that Global Awards listening with a big smile to Robin's words.
Supercarlinbrothers, you should do a theory that the movies, Robots and Yak the giant king, take place in the same universe in different time periods.
1:06 I REALLY Don't Like That Movie 😒
Jay and Ben do you think you could look into the Wizard Of Oz theory? I know ot is not disney or Pixar but I feel like it would be a fun topic. The theory is how each element of the story represents the Great Depression and how the slippers were suppose to be Silver not Ruby
I think my favorite Disney voice actor is James Earl Jones as Mufasa. Yeah, probably not very original, but it’s true. Strength, presence, warmth, and fatherliness. That’s what you get when you cast a Shakespearean actor to do the voice of a king.\n\nNowadays, almost all the voices just sound like random people you could run into on the street. Forgettable as you could ever hope to be.
please tell me I am not the only one who knew who voiced Belle and Ariel
_This MUST be why I cannot download any of the Aladdin movie songs sung by Genie (Robin Williams) on Apple music_
The best voice-cast Disney film was... Mulan. Ming-na Wen had to pull of a wide range as TWO characters--male and female. The other cast members included most Asian actors, from BD Wong (Jurassic Park) to James Shigeta (Die Hard) to Pat (MISTER MIYAGI!) Morita as the Emperor to James (Hardest Working Man in Show Business) Hong, who was in everything from Avatar the Last Airbender to Chinatown!
I like Will Smith and all but... NO ONE CAN REPLACE ROBIN WILLIAMS.
Who's your favorite voice actor..\nTERA STRONG!!\n...in a Disney movie\nUmmmmmmmm
I cannot take Maui seriously for the very reason that it is Dwayne Johnson voicing him, I just know his voice way too well and can't get past that to just enjoy Maui as a character. Same goes for the elephant in the pistachios commercials, I can't not think about it being John Cena... this may also just mean I've watched way too much wrestling in my life.\n\nI don't think big names should matter when casting a particular role but it will definitely help sell the movie.\n\nAs for favorite voice actors, it's really hard to choose anyone other than Robin Williams. How can one not love Batty, Genie, Fender, Ramon and Lovelace?
Billy Crystal as Mike Wasoski idc that that's Pixar he was great for the role
Why is the title Robin Williams was almost not Genie when you say in the video that they literally wrote the role for him and didn't want anyone else to speak him?
the voice actor should only matter if their voice talent is great. Eddie Murphy, Jack Black, Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, John Goodman, Gilbert Gottfried, Mark Harmon, James Woods, and the late Robin Williams are prime examples of actors whos' voice roles are not only recognizable, but also well trained and full of talent. When a famous actor is also a talented voice actor like Mike Myers or the late Robin Williams, and has a wide variety of voices to add to the character they portray while coupled with good animation, you reach a point where the character often takes precedence over the actor and while you certainly know who is voicing the character you also recognize the particular role they are playing apart from their many other roles. Someone like Dwayne Johnson may be a popular actor, but outside of the singing I would not recognize his role in Moana from a voice playback of the Scorpion King because he has no voice talent.
Weren't you like 17 when Shrek came out? You wanted to believe in a talking donkey
No wishing for more wishes no problem wish for more genies
Ariel=Jodi Benson Belle=Paige O'Hara! 😂😂 I actually do know those off the top of my head lol
Disney straight to video sequels list!!!!
Now I miss the legendary Robin William.
Belle is Paige o Hara

6:43 All Animated Disney Sequels Ranked! video confirmed
RILEY FROM INSIDE OUT AND ANDY’S MOM ARE THE SAME PERSON
Funny. I actually never heard Aladdin in english so I have ni idea how great Williams was but I heard Disney gave some price or something for our beloved Vesa-Matti Loiri from his performance in the Finnish version, and I did love that. And BTW you did a video about movie names in other laguages and had wrong language in the Finn bit, it was kind of offensive.
My favourite voice actress in a Disney movie is Anjelica Huston as Queen Clarion in the Tinkerbell movies.
Jodie Benson played Ariel and Paige O'Hara played Belle....and yes, casting Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin was GENIEUS....
The guy who voiced Tadashi in big hero 6. I like his voice. And I like the voice actor for genji
to be honest I can't remember any of the voice actors for most movies, aside from Ellen Degeneres for Dory and Robin Williams for the gene
an extremely goofy movie is the best sequel to a disney movie hands down
Who's idea was it to BRIBE Williams into forgiving Disney? Such a stupid move!
the genie is more iconic than aladdin himself
Man j honing behind the scenes with crazy stories!
You still do not mention the super Carlin 👶 yet!!
2:50 ..... Woowwww the shade..
James Earl Jones as mufasa
I miss Robin Williams. RIP.
I like Josh gad

I saw this video when it had zero views
Why do these sheep have vertical pupils?
I have a hedgehog.....
why is cyclopamine in corn lillys and why do they bind onto smoothened?
sonic the hedgehog is bad
I bet Nobody SAW that coming
what ever you do, never, EVER look up cyclops sheep. its nightmare fuel.
It would make sense someone named tien talks about some thing with three eyes
Do not search on google cyclops sheep! I repeat! Do not google it! My eyes are scared for life
1:45 that's not a nose
The stripes on those farmers' shirts aren't very realistic.
Don't Google Cyclops sheep!
Damn dem cyclops sheep be cute
toddler
I have a question, how do we know that the nucleus of the earth is hot?
that pun at last
Dont google cyclop sheep the drawing looks way cuter than it should
When you reallize Soinc the hedgehog has joint eyes!!! :O
So happy that the same old outro came back! That song makes me release dopamine in my brain!
Anyone else thinks the Hedgehog gene cell is cutely drawn?
I have a feeling that whole video was build up for that pun at the end 😂
0:45 Hence the reason why Rick is afraid of Cob World
Me: How did you find out this medicine could be used for cancer?  Doctor: Cyclops sheep ................................................................................ *crickets chirp* ....................................................................................
is this real or a riddle?
Hedgehog gene?  As in the sonic hedgehog gene?  I'm not joking.   That's its actual name.
Anyone else slightly annoyed that the cyclopamine animation had two eyes

Those sheeps can deal extra damage!\nTOO BAD! Because their range is lower!
you guys should do a vid on mike the headless chicken\n(rooster)
I love the conclusion at the end. SO beautiful
Sounds like the farma corporations wanted to get a hold of the profits so they declared the cyclopamine not safe and instead they developed a drug that does the same thing but I bet with worst side effects...way to go America letting corporations run wild.
Did the sheep blink or wink? The world may never know...
Is Wild corn lilly also called  western false hellebore (Veratrum californicum)? http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/44550/title/The-Cyclopes-of-Idaho--1950s/
Good work on the animation
Tien voice over is the best
anyone love the animation? \n\n\n\n\nme!🙌
Anyone thought that sheep is a reference from the odyssey in which the sheeps are in the cyclops islands?
In the cyclops greek tale with Odysseus there are sheep.. hmm..

The real question is does the gene make you run faster?
Ok, why does the cartoon cyclopamine have two eyes???
I was kind of expecting a Polyphemus reference, but the pun was way better
sonic the hedgehog+Gene=hedgehog Gene ... That's good to know.
Nobel prize for best farmers should be given.
I have one tiny comment: the DNA (1:19) is drawn incorrectly (it is left handed but should be right handed). But as usual, the video is lovely and I very much enjoyed it :)
your new animator did a stellar job. please keep him.

Imagine getting paid as a pilot just for that 1 minute everyday
 . . . Okay . . .  \n\nI just love listening to that Air Traffic Control Chatter.
and it has aerodynamics of a brick 😂😂😂
When your at your friends house but you forgot your charger.
I don't know why but I love this so much
Lost it at Aerodynamics of a brick.
Perfect use case for an electric plane!
They should add an a380 😂\n\n\n\n\n\n.....
Cost, frequecy ?
He reminds me so much of Merlin
that ''no drink service'' line followed by the laugh was criiingeyyyy
Is anyone else having an annoying ass glitch on YouTube where whenever you click on a comment you can’t exit the damn comment and if you try to YouTube crashes? I’m on mobile btw\n\nEdit: I just realized you can’t scroll down on a comment either, so that’s great
The story was interesting but that annoying narrator girl I could do without, including the painfully unfunny joke at the end.
How boring is it to live there
When the Traffic control on the destination airport gives the ok to lift off...
Where is the TSA!?! Not safe
Imagine the costs when they start using electric planes.
Aerodynamics of a bridge 😂😂😂
That laugh at the end was adorable!
That joke at the end with the tryhard cute laugh ruined the entire video for me. Seriously.
As much as I hate being on a boat, I’d rather fly rather than be on a boat. I still hate flying, but it’s 80 seconds, so…yeah.
I wonder what the security check-in process is like for that flight
I think Scott Manley lost a brother
Shame we couldn't have someone who can speak properly voice over this. I hate this kind of American accent.
there is no way to get an air accident. if there were. they can land quickly
Can't they just build a bridge or a port..?
Long lost family on this one
That's gotta suck for that pilot's flight hours. Imagine at his next job interview: You worked for 10 years and only got 50 flight hours?
Why even live there? its stupid.
The last word in every sentence ends with vocal fry. Weird. Only the last word.
Perfect situation for government cuts and firing each of those unionized non-working crew.  Imagine dedicated firefighting teams for this on the government payroll!  No wonder the UK is a third rate economy.
Does he fill out the log books for every flight? \nAlso starting up that airplane takes longer than the flight lol.
It has the aerodynamics of a brick
I love Orkney! Didn't get to either of these islands on my one trip there, but Papa Westray has the oldest building in the U.K., dating to 3700 BC, so .I would love to see it some day. Maybe fly there from Westray!
Thats weird, I could have sworn normal boats were a thing.
whoever it is, that travels around to make these videos has the greatest job ever!
1:31\nSo... building bridges doesen't make sense, but 80 second flight does?\n\n*woah*
this is almost like a Wes Anderson movie
no drink service?! c'mon you millenials are so fucking whiney. ITS A ONE MINUTE FLIGHT
They should invest in gliders, it’s even more financially efficient
The most suspicious thing you can bring on an airplane is a parachute.
Why use a plane not a helicopter?
Is that a pilatus?
This is How Father Ted and company got to Craggy Isle

Wow amazing place to go MGTOW ;) thanks for posting!
How people in the middle of nowhere can afford all of this?
I Used to live in orkney. I went to stenness primary school with 30 (!) pupils in the entire school. I never got to fly that flight though. Also, we don't normally fly, It gets pretty expensive for commuters so most people just get the ferry.
your mom is the shortest flight in the world
Years till savage Muslims blow up the flight? 5? 10?
If only there was a way to connect the islands together by means of concrete.....
I've been on an even shorter flight.\n\nIts called jumping.
Air controller ? Afraid that you might hit another plane in the air?
How much do tickets for the flight cost? I imagine it would be a bit more expensive than the ferry, right?
Bah.... The joke in Canada was that Air Canada was being criticized for investigating an international *_Windsor_*_ to _*_Detroit_* air route. The runway would have been longer than the required flight.
I live in Scotland
Man, i wanna visit this place...
Did Wes Anderson direct this episode?
The aesthetic of this video reminds me of a Wes Anderson film.
How much fuel per flight  does it use up
Nice job on being in CNN 10!
Should have included a continuous FPV of the whole flight.
Is it weird that I feel like working with them there, now? It seems so lovely.
My friend? How many flight hours?
So much for telling us the cost. Good reporting.
Only to people with that accent this would make sense!
Looks like a Wes Anderson movie set lol
Please stop with the vocal fry
As if! They need a new narrator
I've been there... most beautiful place in the world <3
No drink service!?!? No way I’m flying in that plane
A Wes Anderson idea or short film turned into real life scenario.
I wanna work in that cute airstrip :)
Just jump
full hot amazing plen
4 fire fighters, 1 pilot, 2 traffic controller, 4 passenger 1,20 min. flight. fucking awesome!!

Fake News! False Flag! The US Government orchestrated this “shooting” from beginning to end
whst we do know is that she is an idiot
I saw many south east Asian women with white Americans why?
Asian women look hot even when  they're  old........gonna get me one.
The mainstream media has to be furious he doesn't fit into a certain demo. Besides his skin color he's just not that interesting. Sigh.
She obviously knew what was gonna take place. She should be held somewhat responsible.
Wait, did they say she was in the Philippines during the attacks or was  the plane made a u turn? \n\nFrom what was broadcasts on the news, they put her in Las Vegas.
Not cool people are going to blame this lady.
Blame everyone else beside the white man smh

Clickbait for views. Downvote this video off of trending
THIS IS WHY I NO LONGER PARTICIPATE IN LARGE MASS GATHERINGS LIKE THIS CONCERT,  THEY WERE ALL SITTING TARGETS, LIFE AS WE KNOW IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME, PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T BE FREE WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. MOST NIGHTS I STAY HOME, MOST CREEPS BECOME CRAZY HALF PAST 9PM.
And now the cia is gonna kill her
I don't even have to scroll through the comments to know that there are a lot of fucking losers in here who are wanna be journalists and reporters that think they have anything to offer on this story lol. The only people who know what's going on are the police, that's it. So stfu and when they have anything new they'll tell everyone and then you can act like you're the one who knew it all along.
Well alot of Asians are Euro worshippers anyway so it really isn't a surprise
I don't think she knew. She was in the Philippines for 2 weeks before this happened.
a lot of people said she would not go back to the US. now what?
she just happens to be out of the country and had money wired to her prior to this? hmm something seems off
Racist white media !\nThey digged up and circulated more of this woman's photos that the white killer itself!
Let's not blame the crackers, let's find a way to blame non whites somehow.......

Do you think she really doesn't know? And was this a ex because I have been seeing different stories making it seem like that.
So are we gonna blame her for his crimes now? Right? FUCK YOU AMERICA, FUCK YOU, You are a shitty country.
Wake up people! He wasn’t the shooter. He was the fall guy. There were two shooters. One was on the fourth floor. There’s actual video of it. Plus taxi driver video of two different gun shots from two location. I don’t believe anything the news says and you shouldn’t either.

She shouldn't be news. Leave her be. Honestly.
The whole thing of her not being in the country and all that stuff is clearly planned by her and boyfriend. Pretty good story.
you can’t believe this shit.... what a fucking cover up.. they heard more than two guns.. they used this gambling drunk dude as a scape goat. People even said he had no fucking gun experience??? \nThere is no fucking way all that ammunition gun explosive crap got up there with only one dude..\nLegit you’re being lied to

Hey Guys! This Is Great! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 𝕏𝔹𝕆𝕏 $𝟝𝟘𝟘 𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕞𝕠 𝕔𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Claimyourfreepromocode
Yeah, because the smartest thing to do is to interview the shooter's gf that fucking lives thousands of miles away
Because he didn’t like country music
Here's the thing about this shooting; If it WASN'T a false flag, a black-op or any other kind of politically motivated act of terror perpetrated by some shadowy government operatives to push a political narrative, then god DAMN the shadowy government types who it would be assumed would perpetrate something like this hit the fucking jackpot with this one. And, the people who could use an event like this to push narratives and issues (such as changing gun laws) came into an outrageous windfall with the political rhetoric and talking points gained. The question is, are we supposed to believe that's a coincidence?
Treating his ex like a rock star. Good job
she hid the money in the Philippines
Oh we need *strong* leads... Let's not get a person who was there at the point of the shooting,  let's get someone who was *miles* away... *SHE MIGHT KNOW SOME SHIT*
So shes the girlfriend of the other shooters as well
If I were her I'd have stayed out of country there are a lot of angry stupid people right now and guess who's face is being blasted around by the fucking news.
I have to wonder where this number of $100,000 sent to the Philippines comes from and if that information was fact checked by these news outlets that have been reporting it. I lived in the Philippines and I don't believe you can send that much money to that country in particular. It is more likely that as is typical in the Philippines, Filipinos may refer to the Peso as dollars. It could be that he wired P100,000 (about $2,000), although it could be difficult to even wire that much with the new laws in place to prevent outsiders funding potential terrorist groups.
She’s ISIS and had pics of him in panties.  Case solved.
why do they put her face up like a mug shot? she didn't do anything...she's not a suspect..ruin her life pin head fake news
How much you wanna bet they torture her into confessing, then this whole thing gets wrapped up in a neat little bow?
She doesnt have to answere anything at all,If i were her id say to the media and police.....Hi and just stare at them... or tell them to go get donuts and coffee......
American media is so funny
I really hope antifa was behind this so we can label them as a terrorist group
Get her tf out of LA lmao. We don’t want her ass here
$100,000????? She can now fulfill her dream of opening a nail shop in the lobby of the Mandalay Bay Hotel #Winning
1:24 what kind of cosmetics are you using on your eyebrows they look nice.
The media will blame her, the shooters brother, the shooters rough childhood and even the hotel and it's security..... But they won't blame the politicians who allowed high powered guns for civilian purchase huh.

This is just a bad year for everyone I guess. And I thought 2016 was garbage. It's just so sad that this is the world we're giving our children.
When there is a crime such as this, ofcourse they eye and question the husbands, wives, family members, friends, or anyone connected or close to the suspect or criminal ya'll.
*_Never make a statement to the police, even if you are really innocent of any wrongdoing! She better lawyer-up!_*
The woman is coming to the US to help /cooperate with the investigation even though she doesn't even live in the US. The good ol media trying to get this woman killed for dating the wrong guy.

Jon McGregor  -  Even The Dogs\nJeanette Winterson  -  The Passion\nMuriel Spark  -  Not To Disturb
SO excited for this book! Almost excited enough to disregard my disappointment about the tour only being around the US
I've been reading Gene Wolfe's books for a couple of years now. I generally read about 60 books per year, according to GoodReads, and nothing has been quite so profound as his books. I never knew books could do some of the things his do. I learned just today that Latro the protagonist of a series of Gene's books means 'plunderer.' 'Soldier of the Mist' 0812558154 (ISBN13: 9780812558159)
'Ministry Of Utmost Happiness' by Arundhati Roy. It's her second novel after 19 years and it tells the story of muslim born eunuch, but it also deals with the status, role and problems of eunuch in India and also other social problems in India. It's a greeeaaaaaat book.
I'm reading the Foxhole Court (All For the Game) trilogy. I like it a lot. Read it if you want to laugh while having your heart ripped out.
I'm about to start Sherman Alexie's The Absolutely True Diary of Part-Time Indian for class. It'll be my second time but first with the physical copy as the library, at the time, was completely out.
Right now I'm reading Rick Riordan's new book, The Ship of the Dead (it's great), and Warbringer by Leigh Bardugo (which is also great so far but I had to pause it to read The Ship of the Dead because SERIES PRIORITIES). And the next book on my tbr is Turtles All The Way Down, of course.
I am currently in my senior year of high school and haven't read a single book for fun in 7 years? It was the first thing to go when I started down a path of depression and isolation, books did not transport me to new lands. My depression coincided with the rise in dystopia fiction, so despite being raised with Harry Potter and Narnia, my world felt dismal. As if the words I was flooded with defined the whole of literary achievement. I read classics to stall my distaste for reading, and nothing worked. Books can no longer hold my attention, because I can only assume the worst, which ruins the surprise or in the end I am disappointed with the empty feeling of a happy ending. I adore books for how happy they make others, but they lack a home in my heart.
First thing: You should read freedom by Jaycee Duggard because that was amazing and super inspirational(although I would recommend reading  her first book a Stolen Life before you read that one)\nSecond thing: I am going to the tour in Pleasanton and I am beyond excited!!!!! Can't wait to read the book!!!!(Also preordered a maybe signed copy which makes me even more excited!)
I’m currently reading Wicked by Gregory Maguire, and it is truly amazing!
Thought they would make a video about Vegas
Currently going through American Gods (the full cast Audiobook)\nI bought FIOS from Cosco (as mentioned in Dear Hank and John) but this one I had preordered. Officially my first book preorder.\nNot forgetting. TBA
I've been reading the Simonson run of Thor from the 80's. Good stuff.
So many accents on so many names.
I was half-way through 'Perfume: The Story of a Murderer' and left it at the airport somewhere this morning. My favorite bookmark, the second joker from a blue deck of Bicycles, which has been with me for close to a hundred books in the last few years, lay therein.
Love this guy
THANK YOU!!!
I've coincidentally seen the occurring numbers 333 in random places everywhere I go. So you can imagine how creeped out I was when I saw the video was 3:33 long.
I am *almost* about to finish Half-Blood Prince and start Deathly Hallows
I've been wanting to read more for a long time. I'm in an on/off relationship with John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath, and I'm more consistently reading 9 Stories by J.D. Salinger.
Personally I find it hard to read. I always get distracted and bored. I also have a hard time comprehending what I read and remembering important details of stories. Because of these things I very rarely read things longer than an article length, and haven’t read a book for school cover to cover since fourth grade. I feel like I’m missing out because everyone else in my family loves reading but I just find it so hard so I avoid it.
I was wondering when you guys were going to start using dftba again in your videos
What are human stories ?
The denial of death
I'm currently reading some pieces I always loved, Pride and Prejudice and the twilight saga #sorrynotsorry
Mr. Penubra's 24 Hour Bookstore. It is a book about books
Can you offer advice on how to read a lot? I miss reading so much but I can't seem to get around to it 😑
I've been reading a lot of Russian short stories for my class, we just finished reading Ёлка и Свадьба (The Christmas Party and the Wedding) by Dostoevsky, and we did an assignment on writing an epilogue for the story. We've also read Метель (The Blizzard) by Pushkin, Фаталист (The Fatalist) by Lermontov, and we're currently reading Анна на Шее (Anna on the Neck) by Chekhov. I think Lermontov's The Fatalist has been my favorite so far, it comes from a series of short stories called A Hero of Our Time, and there are a lot of moments of deep thought, considering fate and the meaning of life.
I just finished We Are Okay yesterday and oh god.....it hit me so hard. It was perfect.
Thanks for this video. I'd love more videos of you talking about books. Recommending them or critiquing.. anything really.
I have slowed down on new acquisitions due to an absence of good (new) book stores (there are several excellent used) and become even more of a serial re-reader. Just finished Carol Berg's Song of the Beast for the umpteenth time. Now I want to read specific books that I left back in Ohio, and it vexes me (Cindy Williams Chima's Heir Chronicles or Sergei Lukyanenko's Nightwatch series, if you're curious).
hell yeah
Thanks John!
*SIGH* \n\n\nDear John,
HOWLING IN EDEN!
Thanks for leaving a list in the description 👍
I'm reading Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Nietzsche
Finishing up Brene Brown's Braving the Wilderness and it's currently my #1 recommendation for all human peoples. Super relevant and smart and emotional and convicting and important.
I feel bad for subbing this channel, and not reading as many books (I'm more of a games/interactive entertainment type nerd).
If Daniel Alarcon was my schoolmate, beating me for three years in the creative writing, I certainly WOULD NOT be bragging about his book on my Youtube Channel. You're a good man John. (:
Am I a bad person because I just do not care about 99% of novels? (I read a lot of non-fiction and textbooks...)
I need to make a 'John's Book Recommendation' list, and find some time to sit and indulge in it all!
next time you come to the UK can you talk to the BBC about reading a book for CBeebies bedtime hour?
I am currently reading a book on the French Revolution, short stories by Edgar Allan Poe and  So Much Longing on Such a Small Surface by Karl Ove Knausgård
I love John's videos about books. Since I love books too.
You can tell he's nervous from his eyes. John, everything is going to be okay. Calm down. You're awesome! Don't forget that.
I CANT WAIT FOR TATWD
I'm always amazed that, to this day, I don't believe I've never heard of a single book or author that John has recommended. I feel like I live on an entirely different planet or something. \n\nBut to answer the question of books, I love Pat Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicle, Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series, Andy Weir's The Martian, Hugh Howey's Silo series, and Ramez Naam's Nexus trilogy. And outside the fiction sphere, Peter Joseph's The New Human Rights Movement is absolutely profound.
BOOK RECS FROM JOHN ARE THE BOMB
I completely agree with you. The Hate you give is a book I ardently believe that everyone should read. A definite YA classic in my eyes.
Memoirs of a Polar Bear is the greatest book ever written.
Exit west, ministry of the upmost happiness
I just finished reading Stephen King's IT. It's pretty brilliant as far as coming of age novels go. His metaphors for the kids' fears and growing up are just impressive. I'm about to read Gucci Mane's autobiography. Can't wait for Turtles.
Violence against black bodies. Have you read it John ?
I love these book recommendation lists.  The descriptions you bring to them are different and helpful in a way that simply reading a cover rarely is.
Kaveh Akbar is a professor at my university (Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN) and I had the pleasure of attending a poetry reading of his last week. Before the reading, I had never heard any of Kaveh's work, nor did I know anything about him. His poetry shocked me. Truly, I can't think of a better word than shocked. I don't usually read poetry, and I won't lie and say that I understood the meaning of every poem he read, but I was enthralled during the entire reading. What astonished me the most about Kaveh was his eloquence, and his kindness. After the reading he answered questions from the audience, and I have never heard someone speak with such precision, clarity and emotion. I could listen to him talk for hours. Unfortunately I will probably never get the opportunity to take his class. I was pleasantly surprised to see you recommend him, John.
Some of my fav books I recently read were the sun is also a star by nicola Yoon, ven by jane teller
I literally just finished The Female of the Species by Mindy McGinnis. I have a hard time getting into books (as of late) but I finished this one in only a few days, would highly recommend.
Hey John I'm not sure jf you've read this already but I highly recommend reading the Witcher saga by Sapkowski. Its originally in Polish but it is soo good. I hope you check it out.
My favorite kind of video! I recently read Tropic of Orange by Karen Tei Yamashita for my Literary Criticism and Analysis class and fell in love with it. It really expresses a lot of magical realism and my favorite character is a great representation of Chicanismo, of which I was extrmemly excited to see some sort of representation of myself in literature.
Currently reading Ulysses by James Joyce for my English thesis paper.\nI also wrote a poetry book called Bones and Souls. :)
CAN'T WAIT TO GET YOUR BOOK AT MY DOOR
What If? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe. A book on the list of Bill Gate's recommended  reads!
I recently read The Killing Lessons by Saul Black and loved it! Also the Broken Earth trilogy by NK Jemison is absolutely outstanding.
This year I loved A River Runs Through It by Norman MacLean. It has some great ideas and words in it, plus it’s short. You can finish it in a weekend.
What would be the chances that my preordered copy of turtles all the way down is signed? Is there a way to guarantee it? THANKS
Currently reading Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, the true story of Olympic runner turned WWII bombardier Louis Zamperini. Absolutely riveting story of surviving against the odds
I just read an oral history- The Unwomanly Face of War by Svetlana Alexievich and it was fantastic!
I don't read much, I probably have a countable number of books I've read in my life.  But your enthusiasm for books makes me want to read more!
Love your books.  Have you read Plover by Brian Doyle?
Thanks for the book recs John! I just read Daring to Hope by Katie Davis Majors and it was absolutely beautiful. Non fiction reflection of 10 years as a missionary in Uganda.
Book recommendation videos are always my favorite. I would be pretty okay with a Question Tuesday, Book Recommendation Friday rotation.
Great recommendations. Currently reading Catch-22 and a biography of Hugo Wolf. Good luck with tour.
I just started Who Fears Death by Nnedi Okorafor because I have heard great things about her books.
Just finished Lord of the Flies... it was... interesting?
I love book recommendations from you! I end up finding my favorites from these lists. I always love expanding my personal library :) Thanks, John! Can't wait until I can read Turtles All the Way Down!!
THUG is my favorite so far this year, but reading The Hearts Invisible Furies and loooooving it so far!
John!!!!! You should extend your book tour to Canada :D
The vast majority of the books I read, and there are a lot, are sci-fi/fantasy, which when watching John's book recommendations makes me feel a bit... petty. Is it bad that I don't really like adult fiction or non-fiction?  Anyway I'm reading The Princess Bride for the first time and it's very good.
Read and enjoyed 'Not a penny more, not a penny less' by Jeffrey Archer
A tortoise part the way up.
Since when was John bestly sold?
Im currently reading Cathedral by Raymond Carter
I'm reading Blood, Sweat and Pixels currently. It's a series of chapters that follow game publishers along the life cycle of the games they develop. So far, I'm four chapters in and I'm in love with the narration and how complicated game development it.
TURTLES IN A WEEK
Nightfall by Shannon Messenger is coming out November seventh and I might just implode with excitement.
just bc i feel like saying it...\ni recently finished a book called Here Lies Daniel Tate Cristian Terrill. it's a YA mystery about a boy who manages to manipulate people into believing he is Daniel Tate, a high-society Hollywood boy who disappeared at the age of ten. the narrator-whose real name we never learn-soon finds out that his new family has some very intense secrets of their own. i finished it in a day and i could not stop reading it. i definitely recommend if you like mystery/thriller books. ik no one will probably read this but i just wanted to get it out there. thanks :)
I have Huckleberry Finn, two nonfiction books about the American revolution, and The Boys who Challenged Hitler. Currently reading the Inkworld series, a good one if you need a refuge in a fantasy world. I have a lot of movies I want to watch as well. If only I had all the time in the world for this!
Depression and other magic tricks, and our numbered days are two amazing poetry books I am obsessed with
It feels weird to say I've got my copy of Turtles all the way Down.  Apparently amazon.ca just couldn't wait any longer.  Thanks for taking the time to sign John!
im currently reading i hate everyone but you by gaby and allison and i freaking love it!
I'm currently reading Dark at the Crossing, by Elliot Ackerman
I’m reading the Disaster Artist atm
Hank and John, \n\n     I have a challenge for you. John, I know you love learning about other religions. I would love to see the two of you learn about the LDS church. Their roles in history/their church history. See what standards they hold themselves to and try to do the same with your families for a week. Look at the differences in between them and America's people today. Do a myth busters over rumors about the church. This isn't me trying to convert you through the comment section, this is a fellow nerd-fighter hoping that you can learn about them and through you others can learn about them. What's their cause? What do they believe in? A portion of people's ignorance about them can be cleared up through you. Two great sources for learning are  https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng and The Gospel Library app. These people are good with wonderful charities to help/serve and they shouldn't be persecuted so much for a lack of understanding. I think you will enjoy learning about them and from them.\n                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                         -A concerned Nerd-fighter
My local book club is reading A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. It's an addicting read and yet with every page, I feel nothing but rage.
JOHN THAT ONE LINE FROM WE ARE OKAY IS THE LINE THAT STUCK WITH ME FOR MONTHS AFTER I READ IT
Currently reading the Southern Reach trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer. It's this suspenseful Syfy mystery thriller. It is fan-flipping-tastic!
I've started Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.

This is #11 trending?, YouTube is so broken
I personally think its difficult when choosing what to write in the comments section because i really love Anna and Johnathan and how they parent their kids.I love how they are so interactive with them they never ignore them or scream at them and its seems to me the kids are there very first priority in everygthing they do (which unfortunately is not true with all parents).I love to watch their videos everyday and now again (not very often) i might see something that i dont agree with and when you think it   you want to write it in the comments,it doesnt mean  you are telling them how to parent or that you are trolling in any way its just an opinion but unfortunately too many people then get mad or hateful just for giving your opinion.I do know people can leave very mean and hurtful comments and that is just uncalled for but when youtubers post there videos i do think they should be open to people not always agreeing or liking what they do and not all comments will be nice and people may not like or agree with everything they see or hear.\nSorry for the rant.xxxxxxx
You guys are amazing parents but jonothan, please next time walk on the road side of the footpath and have the kids on the inside of the foot path!
Not to be pushy at all, but are you guys moving or not?  Just wondering.
Love Alissia’s new cot really pleased you put it down a notch, as she so cleverly turned over. the other thing that makes my heart jump is when Eduardo is on the outside walking along the road when cars go past fast, he needs to be on the inside even though your holding his hand, my heart just misses a beat, hope you don’t mind me saying love the videos and love you all keep up the good work love watching you all, you such a wonderful family  xxx
I feel bad for Eduardo cox when he grows up and his friends see these they might make fun of him
I haven't watched this for a while so can someone update me please? Is Eduardo playing girls or does Eduardo think he is a girl?
Awh bless the kids' reaction to the bug 😂👌🏻
Alessia reminds me SO much of Emilia at that age.  Should would just stare and stare into the camera while eating loll!!
Ohhhhhh  Alessia is getting bigger now!!!...she has officially moved out of Moma & Daddy room!!!!!!
Omg I watch every episode plus I im making my own series now
Some lovely comments as there should be, but I constantly see hate and we need to fix this if we watch these videos we should support them not criticise. if they didn’t film their lives then no one would be saying anything about the way they are parenting so why should a camera change this, please please spread love and positivity as no ones deserves hate when the world is already full of negativity, they make these videos for us to enjoy, so enjoy them and not worry :) they are a wonderful family and should keep doing what they are doing
Literally thought the chocolate on the floor was a bunch of spiders... haha!
Jonathon has a big ol beer gut..and anna is a bitch
Alessias little teeth 🙊 my son is 11 months old and he still doesn’t have any 😂😩 xxx
Eduardo: Em, em, em..lol, he is so adorable, seriously!!
So cute! Haven't watched the vlogs much since alessia was born, whats the mark on her head?
It's time to build... Not: Its time to build....
You guys are so funny! That's why i love you guys!!
the last time i have seen a vlog of this lovely family was when you just moved into this house and im so happy that I've found you guys again!!! ❤️
You guys are amazing!! I love you 😘😘💜
Hey Guys! This is Brilliant! I got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕊𝕜𝕪𝕡𝕖 ℂ𝕣𝕖𝕕𝕚𝕥𝕤 Here – >  #claimanygiftcardfrofree
Hi there Fellas! This is Awesome! I got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 𝔾𝕠𝕠𝕘𝕝𝕖 ℙ𝕝𝕒𝕪 𝔾𝕚𝕗𝕥 ℂ𝕒𝕣𝕕 Here – >  #likefreecardsgetitnow
What is the red mark on your baby's forehead? Is it left by use of forceps? I'm planning Epidural birth but ppl keep telling me about the risk of brushing baby with forceps. How long is it going to stay?
I'm sick of people saying that the baby is underdeveloped she's not every baby develop's at different paces.I've worked in a nursery for two years and the children range from six weeks to 4 years and every child is different.
Hey there Guys! This is Amazing! I got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕀𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖𝕤 ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #getyourgiftcardnow2017
Omg time flies alessia is so pretty omg her bed is lush and she is pretty xxx see you in Glasgow going on tour to see them
That awkward moment when they make Bianca dance to swalla 🙊😂
i though tht was david tennant as well
Have u ever been to Berlin. I think I seen u in a airport
whats her name my babie sister called Grace
Hi guys love your channel will be really good if u subscribe to my Chanel so I can make YouTube videos
Love that song at the end :-)
Not to be rude,but what's that red thing on her head
I put my 6 month old in her own room the other day 😓😭 I have that same monitor it's the only thing keeping me sane haha
Emilia and Eduardo when they see the spider😂😂😭
Not being rude or anything, i'm new to the Alessia videos, but is it a birth mark on her face or?
Ah she’s growing up too fast!
The look after anna said she will murder her dog
Aw bless them they fit in the crib so cute xx
I love the dogs' cute little haircuts.  Just adorable!💕
Aww.. Alessia getting her new room is awesome. She is such a sweetie. Eduardo and Emilia are so smart and adorable. I just love your videos. Happy Sukkot to all the Jewish people watching this!!
Can I just say your skin looks amazing without makeup Anna!
Just to let you no your not meant to use for bumpers or blankets on a baby your meant to use sleeping sacks that's what my health visitor told me after I had my twins x
That was a nice surprise! I hadn’t seen Alsessia roll over before.
You maybe already do this but mix new food with some breast milk??
Just going to go murder my dogs lol 😂
wow what healthy breakfasts you have
Was that the first time Alessia rolled over?
nursery songs are much cuter sang by children but sadly Jonathan cant let the children sing it he has to take over and sing louder, hes such a self centered little man
+sacconejolys im glad to see breakfast can get crazy at someone else's house. With kids, dogs, flying chocolate, and silly husbands.
You should put camera and test the kids at night.
Alessia and her arm circles when she's excited.  😂
Are happy to see Alessia, has her own space & crib are pleased to see you frond room for her in your home ... ❤️💜💚💛💋
Does Anna still do BLW with Alessia? I did BLW for my first but don't plan on doing it for my second. Wondering what Anna's take on it is.
11:30 don't play like that 🔥
Just gonna go murder my dog\n\nOh say good byeeee\n\n😂 nailed it editing J ahahah
No like no I see that spider in my house is burn it down
Anna in the end was hilarious!
Great video guys!!! I was laughing out loud when the kids were running to Alesia's room
The way Eduardo said ahh! there's something outside! was so frickin' adorable!
I don't like reading comments when others are trying to tell them how to parent their children. I'm pretty sure they know what they are doing. They have 3 children. Also, they are obviously confident (and rightfully so) with their parenting skills, to share that with over a million people. Good job A & J ❤️ #greatparents
Am i the only one who found the magician kinda hot 😂😂
She's a girl and I'm a girl so she fits in my room -Emilia \nShe should be in my room because I make her laugh and smile -Eduardo \nWho do you guys think had the best logic? I'm team Eduardo hehe, both of them are so cute though, wanting Alessia in their room.
This is trend worthy? Excuse me while I shoot up another school, seems columbine wasn't good enough.
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  well she's a girl and she's a girl and I'm a girl so she will kinda fit in my room 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said  she loves me because she smiles at me and laughs at me and alessia looked so cute in her cot bed :):) :):) \n\nJohnathan is a great dad and Anna is a lovely mum x
Lol these guys are losing subs while getting millions of views a month
Who else had like a mini heart attack when Anne-Marie's music was on😍😂
So interesting 17 mins  of good content I'm so happy it's here
No hate here, I’m new here so I’m just curious, but what is that mark on the baby’s head?
I love the new crib!! <3 I can't help but giggle when I see Alessias adorable face!! She is so sweet. I have never seen a baby move their hands and arms up and down and in circles over and over. She wants to MOVE hehe :-D
Kids in this town have the coolest birthday parties. I don't think I ever went to a birthday party that wasn't just at the kid's house.
What great parents. I love the consistency at which you guys help your children along in growing up because what you have been doing shows with Emilia and Eduardo already.  Those are some great kids and I look forward to watch alessia grow and learn too.
I just have to state this, Anna you are so gorgeous without makeup as much as you are when you have makeup on. Your skin looks so pretty! You're just beautiful.
I can't believe I have been watching since Emilia was a baby and now she's such a big girl. What a beautiful family
Why do u put her on her stomach?!?
Emilia should be in a car seat safety
How much are they paying to get on trending?
Why not give the old cot to someone in need if you wanted to buy a new one, rather that leave it behind the door in Alessia's room?
Bella bambina
So cute!!! 💗
Soooo lush!!
Jonathan is an awesome dad ❤❤
Who else misses Anna’s baking videos? 😭🙋🏾
Aww bless
Your dad is 44
The ending!!! 😂😂😂❤️
POISON! poison!
EDUARDO!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Omg, ROFL...  Rapid Response Force.
This is trending?
0.16 Lookin' good there, Jonathan. 😏
💗💗💗💗🌸🌸🌸🌸
Aww sp cute
I know Anna & Jonathan are very good parents, but I ask myself why they are not interested to give their kids a healthy start of the day (breakfast)? It's always with lot's of sugar & fat. Well, I know it's their decision. I'm just wondering. 💕
No hate or anything but how come the saccone jolys didn’t mention the Vegas shooting but did the Manchester! A very good friend of mine who loved watching their videos was killed:(
Wow, Alessia rolled over, great to see her being more active and not just laying still like a newborn. She outgrew the Moses basket weeks ago obviously. The day she has more room to move around on her tummy we got to see her roll. Way to go Alessia, now learn to roll back to your tummy, kick those feet up and grab for them and sit up.
How uninteresting let me go and watch some paint dry instead. Yawn. Why is this on trending?
How do these people get this stuff on trending? Do they pay?
what does the alarm actually mean? just curious
Who is cutting all the onions here?
You never heard anything bad about Tom Petty he was truly one of the 'good guys' and mega talented songwriters!
now I'm a fan of them. HUGE respect
Bye Mr. Petty!!! We’ll miss u...
pure chemistry USA and UK. God Bless AMERICA.
I'm sick of this rule in pop culture that dictates you must hate coldplay. Fuck that. I like coldplay, I like their music, so suck it.
Great cover, Coldplay. Nicely done. Tom would be proud.
Not sure if Coldplay does this for every big name musician that passes but they did one for the Beasties MCA.
That was so terrible 🤢
Respect!! Love you cold play
What a wonderful tribute to an American legend..Tom Petty
Ok this is cool. But I guess since tom petty didn't kill himself he doesn't get the same recognition and playtime as other selfish band leaders. Mental anguish or not....
Of course the corniest band ever would choose this song. Of fucking course they would.
Just saw Tom live in May this year. Glad I didn't wait. Thanks fpr the memories Tom. And im not a Coldplay fan but much respect to them for having the balls to do this last-minute tribute. They did a great job
He is FREE and making more music for the world above.
It was so wonderful to hear this. My wife and I hugged each other through this whole song. So glad I was able to take her to this show. It meant a lot on an otherwise very shitty day.
He fucking butchered this if you cant sing that high dont try to
Lovely...teary watching this...Tom Petty and The Boss wrote the lyrics to my life growing up...
Wonderful tribute.  Thanks guys. We miss Tom.
Where’s the bass notes?
Thank you for sharing that.
Fantastic tribute to Tom Petty.\n\nGreat work, Coldplay.
Essa música é show! Valeu Tom Petty! Siga sempre na Luz.
Too many Goodbyes. Too much to take...
I hate Coldplay, but this is alright!
Tom Petty one of the best nobody did it better now your really free rip thank you for everything
that was such a fucking incredible concert. i can now die a happy man. i truly never thought i'd get to see coldplay live. thank you guys for everything. coldplay has seriously changed my life for the better
I wanna go to their Concert at Rose Bowl this October 6th but no one wants to come with me due to the shooting in Las Vegas.
I was there! SO GOOD! It was SO emotional - they came out very solemnly, asked for a moment of silence for Vegas, then went into Free Fallin'. It was SO emotional! <3 <3 Love them!
Thank you Coldplay.  You are a good band honoring a legend.  I can't believe Tom is gone, it was like he never aged.  Anyone who didn't like his music was no friend of mine.  I imagine him meeting Elvis, Jackson and half the Beatles and imagine the jam session.
Not a Coldplay fan but a very nice cover & tribute.
shout out to Coldplay great tribute to the great Tom Petty!!!!....R.I.P TOM
Most emotionl version of Free falling I have ever heard. I am so heartbroken over the loss of Tom Petty, his music has been the soundtrack to my life. He was by far my most loved. I cannot believe he's gone. RIP Tom :(
I was there, and it was absolutely incredible. Chris is such a great guy :)
RIP to everyone lost their lives in last few days
a  aweosme tribute to Tom Petty...oh my wht to  say about Tom    just a man  of  many great songs   reminded me lot  of the  Bob  Dylan  style,,, i   so remember  all  of   his videos  this one   def sticks in ma head,,   RIP Tom you will be missed!!!!!
Not hitting the high notes but lovely tribute anyway.  I miss Tom Petty already.
RIP rock legend, Petty's the greatest.
Loved him and his music.  I listened to him for 40yrs.  He was great in concert.  Better to have seen him once, than not at all.  RIP
Rip Tom Petty ,wonderful music over the years.
Chris Martin - star choice song for a legend x
Man, you can't do it :)
Mad respect for all of you on stage and fans. One more light just went out...
there are my hands at the 2:44 marker.🦋🦋🦋
Ah wonderful. Looks like a really special moment. Lucky Portland. Miss you Tom Petty.
Two major losses in 2017 with Chester Bennington and now Tom Petty... RIP legends.
Heff wanted company up there, and who better to share a space in heaven with than Tom.
great rendition, Tom will be missed, so young to pass
That was an amazing concert last night and a wonderful tribute to a rock and roll legend. RIP Tom Petty.
Rock the heavens Tom. You will be missed. 💋
That last part gave me chills, man.\nNo, I'm not crying right now what are you talking about
I was at this concert
Thank you Coldplay. Loved Tom Petty - long may his music live
Wow, what a sad shock. Love ❤️ you.
I guess he learned to fly when he got his wings R.I.P 😇😇
What a beautiful tribute. This is amazing.
I SAW MY HANDS IN THIS VIDEO
Knocked it out of the park!! Great tribute song. R.I.P. Tom Petty. You will be missed, but your awesome music lives on.
Good stuff, gentlemen. I'm only 30 but my parents were heavy rockers and Tom Petty might not have been the voice of my generation.... but I was born about 25 years too late. It hurts.
RIP, Tom
great Steve Martina
Fucking awful!!
Looks like Mark Zuckerberg on vocals. LOL
Nice! ;-(
Like for Tom Petty
BOSSNESS  https://youtu.be/zJqE5m4jONQ

RIP Tom Petty

beautiful...tears...RIP
RIP Tom
que lindo  espacio que deja la gente  , en los conciertos afuera, , para poder llegar  hasta el borde del escenario   :)     en Argentina eso no pasa   :)  :)    ;)
Peter buck is the man!
Stop disrespecting by butchering the death people song. You have done enough, Chris Martin.
Nice sentiment but poorly executed.\n\nTHERE IS ONLY ONE TOM PETTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nRIP Tom!
I hate Tributes swimming on the wave of fate for PR. Guys you going too one day don’t forget that! ColdPlay 👎🏻
This video raises the inevitable question, is there any corpse that Chris and the boys won't fuck the shit out of? That lumpen drum sound, the guitars lacking in any kind of feeling, the walking vagina and embodiment of middle class liberal guilt Chris 'the plagiarist' Martin, unable to hit the fucking notes. Had he even heard this song before? When this bunch of washed out cocks die they'll no doubt release own posthumous tribute to themselves to grab a few more quid from beyond the grave.
Peter Buck?
Coldplay always have to be the bride at the wedding and the corpse at the funeral,take a back seat you egotistical fucks
awesome tribute! PS- Go check out John Mayer's rendition of it (the live version)
Not a fan of Coldplay.....and a big Tom Petty fan......they did an average cover of his work.
No one give a fuck
Aww cmon leave her alone, I know what they did was wrong but cmon it’s just a Pepsi commercial. Go flame the CEO who made trillions of dollars instead of the Victoria’s Secret angel.
Kendall is one of the shadiest people ever. She made fun of Kylie's lips yet look at her now! Lmfao what a joke.
Wth she was so pretty before but she doesn't look good anymore.
She doesn't care about people's safety or if anyone gets hurt or not... She forget we've seen her driving?
Not a fan of Kendall, but wtf it's just an ad. This generation is so fukin retarded, making issues everyday about something.
Kendall it's ok pepsi will solve everything, even your lips.
Nobody needs anything everybody is beautiful   ....... remember  that Kendall darling 😏
The kardashians is what everything is wrong with the world
This commercial seems to be more innocent than people are twisting it to be. If your automatic thought is racism, then maybe you're the racist. all I saw in this commercial, what I CHOSE to see was the fact that something so simple can bring people from all sorts together. This isn't a hate commercial. Seems more like everyone is really sensitive.
What the hell was wrong with the ad?
I’d cheer her up😋
Umm.... shouldnt the person who made it not star in it apologize? unless she made the damn commercial, funded it, wrote it, etc seems like she just wants it to be about her... actors never know what the story is or full script, theyre just given lines and told to act
Kim  ''This is the first time you had a scandal''
As a British person who doesn't know who this girl is I would just like to say god bless America!
Instead of empathizing with those that felt this was wrong, the chosen approach was to cry and make this about her.
why should anyone feel stupid for cracking open a cold one with the boys ?!!!
Everytime they do something wrong (like putting their faces with music icons without asking or being a part of a stupid commercial) they don't apologise they just say oh it wasn't my intention i'm sorry *fake tears*\nthey need to stfu and thank god if they are famous and rich without doing anything.
oh my goddddd life must be so hard :'(
Who cares. Men just wanna see the booty
MAYBE SHE JUST NEEDS SOME PEPSI 😂😂
everyone: “THE PEPSI COMMERCIAL IS SO OFFENSIVE!!1”\nme: “yeah ok but why though?”\neveryone: “......... THE PEPSI COMMERCIAL IS SO OFFENSIVE!!!”
Why would anyone blame her and not Pepsi? It's not like she's the one who wrote the commercial. \nIt's like blaming Harrison Ford and not Spielberg for kingdom of the crystal skull.
My heart breaks when I see her cry..😗💔
This was so funny I shed a tear
I feel so bad for her
I watched the pepsi commercial and I don't understand why it's so bad and a scandal? Someone explain?
She didn't even apologize 😂😂😂 all she's worried about is how dumb she looked to the public. What a joke
Cool what acting classes is she taking?
honey this is months too late
looking forward to day this fucking family fade away like a bad case of the clap\nalways looking for sympathy all the time\nwhoever looks up to these idiots needs a good smack around the back of the head
Why are people lying like if they were gonna get paid 1000 they wouldn't do the commercial ? Foh .
Was my first time watching and thought who gives a shit lol
Why is it such a big deal
Someone PLEASE tell me what was wrong with the advert.!
I mean... there is some real negativity in these comments. Especially around 'who cares' clearly you because you watched the video. Why does everyone need to be nasty nowadays?
Oh no she wouldn't hurt anyone on purpose... Remember this TS thing.... This fam is a bunch of liars
I literally saw nothing wrong with that commercial. People are just WAY to over dramatic, y’all need to take a Xanax or something 😂
To all the people this is relevant to.. Please get a life.
Someone should have gave those shooters in las vegas some pepsi.
First time you've had a scandal LMAO
Sounds like she needs a Pepsi.
Really, Pepsi is at fault. She is just a paid model.
She's a model, not the producer. Tear them down and not her
Meanwhile in Africa. Oh the problems these plastic people have. The problems...
I don't know if I blame the Jenner/Kardashian family for being so stupid and tone deaf. You got a group of girls who have lived in a completely different world than the rest of us and have no idea what life is actually like and what is really going on in American politics. Listen, they all got famous because they are rich, stupid, and have ton of plastic surgery which makes them perfect for all the idiots who love reality tv. Why such high expectations? Isn't the whole idea behind their appeal is that they are so far from reality that we watch them like some form of circus freak show? Personally, I hate reality tv and had not heard of the Jenner side of the family before this happened. I knew that there was Kim Kardashian and that she had some sisters but I didn't know their names. I watched the Pepsi ad and thought Yep, that seems about right. I had low expectations as these people are only famous for being idiots, so why all the hate? You are specifically hating them for the reason why you all watch them in the first place.
The ad was a moronic piece of shit that should not exist.But crying over it is just pathetic.I've never respected you because of how you make a living, the type of person you are and your family.But the respect levels are In the negative now.
I'm just waiting for someone to do a leave kendellll jenner alonevideo #leavebritneyalon
Did she have lip injections?
Didn't she tell Kylie not long agothat her lips were too big? I think she said Nobody needs anything, everybody is beautiful. Right...
u should,,,,,,,, have a pepsi
Who the hell cares
Like ever...you said you would not offend anyone..THEN WHY CARRY ON MAKING YOUR DRIVEL GARBAGE TRASH TV SHOW..GO AWAY
She deserves everything they throw at her. Thick bitch !!
What the fuck is wrong with me I clicked on this shite!
I don’t even think the advert was THAT bad... She’s getting way more hate than she should. She did the job, she got paid. End of.
Kendall,go vegan if you don't want to hurt anyone.
How would you not know that was bad idea.
And why do people care about this?
What was wrong with the commercial?
How did it affect anyone though?she just gave some geezer Pepsi and fucked off
Fucking kardashians thinking they are so cool \nWhat's the difference between my family and there's \nNone \nThey are as average and boring as us \nThese twats get money for just living for no fucking reason \nDo I have a 10 Billion Fucking Mansion No\nDo I look like I have had so many Botox injections I look like mickey Rourke No \nWhy am I not famous \nBecause they are Totally interesting\nFuck them \nI have more of a life than those kardashian cunts
I don’t feel bad. You looked at the script you saw what the video was going to be about, yet you went with it. Cry me a river but I wouldn’t give a shit.
To all the people defending her, I think people do have a right to be offended. She appeared in an ad that did take the topic of police violence a light topic. So people are gonna get mad that she thought this ad was okay to be in.
Oh for God's sake leave the girl alone!
Oh life is so hard for you!! Bless your Armani socks !
honestly, kendall, people were not offended.. but why the fuck didnt nobody thought the symbolism of trying to use minorities concerns in the US  showing them just doing stupid shit in the streets, trying to sell the ideogram of capitalism  ( coca cola, pepsi)  in the hands of a very privilege girl that is the epitome of  vanity and everything wrong in entertainment... might be STUPID!!????
Her apology is so fake and pathetic.
Now let’s make a Las Vegas ad
For everyone saying she got her lips done look at her photos from fashion week Ker lips are normal
So since she was a part of she the ignorant bitch? But none of the other hundreds of people in it are? I think she was so excited because Pepsi asked if she wanted to be in a commercial wouldn't  any of us be excited?
At the end of the day she STILL makes way more than you guys make in a day! 🤷🏻‍♀️
I liked the ad. her giving the cop a Pepsi acknowledged that he's a human being too
Umm here was a mass murder a few days ago.. let's try not to worry about some pathetic over privileged celebrities.
never have i heard her apologizing for the things she's done, only her playing the victim
Love kendall
Her lips :(
Poor lass
Crocodile tears lol
LMAOOOOOOO
lol Skendall
no...kendall... your lips.. I mean, whyyyy:(
Scandashians. .. what a life.
Give em a pepsi
Lol shut ur talentless ass up bitch
Bullshit
0:19 glad you understand something
Oh, fuck off.
OH BOO FUCKING HOO
Lol
Fuck off
Comedy
Lol dumb ass
Fuck this call
dnt cry have a Pepsi 😂😂😂
Obligatory trending bj face thumbnail.
Drink a pepsi
Poor thing <4
Grow up
Famous for fuck all useless fuckers
Esse jogo vai ser incrível!!!!
Don't think my 1050ti would be able to play this
Arrow looks to be a game breaker. Hope I'm wrong.
Cant wait to play this game!!
I hope theres a way to turn off those big annoying yellow numbers.
Why is everyone complaining about the controllable arrow, it's like the best thing I mean if say if you don't have a great aim then you can control the arrow into where you want it to go..I mean stop complaining people!!!This game is so awesome I can't wait!!!
I hope that their is no downgrade. Because almost every Ubisoft game is downgrade
Guided arrow ? Is it Missile ? Why Ubisoft.
Assasin's Souls
I want and assassins creed in ancient Japan with Ninjas and Samurais.
Here is my one key question: is an enemy ever too high level to be stealth-killed?
I don't get the part with the controllable arrow. HOW?
La baguette has very good english
so everyone will use bow because it more easy and more stealthy because ai is dumb
Many choices to the player. this is i like!
Looks promising but they better have fixed the modern day story. Another deaf mute character running around the place hacking computers and i'm officially done with AC.
First time I'm going to play assassins creed more then 5 min.
The combat looks so plain.
So i can control the fire arrow? :O
please turn off the numbers when you hit someone  😕
I absolutely cannot wait for this! Every vid I see on it makes me more and more excited! Long live AC!
Take my money and give me that game right now
imo, theres too much control on that arrow, arrows turning corners is just -- wat.
Damnit... This video just made me drop $60 on the pre-order. The hype is real!
I wanna be hyped but the last AC game that was properly optimised on Pc was Rouge please do a good job on Pc i really want to love this game but i still can't play AC3 to this day on PC cuz there's 20fps in cities
The number hitpoints that appear above of the ai's head are just too big, they need to get rid of it or make it smaller
BTW,can I aim the arrow at the guard's private parts as I please?Just like we do in sniper elite?
we took a 2 year break so we have more time to copy and paste from other developers
I only have 1 issue with this game. Where are the damn corner kills?! Petition any1? Other than that.. game looks sick
I have ever seen a game like this 😎
Did they change the controls again? As soon as this series went to Colonial America, they changed the controls for no reason and it sucked. Did they change them back to the original version or something new again for no reason?
I wish they made the climbing more interesting than just climbing anything effortlessly and at unrealistic speeds. It feels extreme in this game. I don't like being reminded i'm playing a game in games like these. I want them to be immersive -- To inhabit the world and interact engagingly and believably with it. That's what I loved about these games, but they seem to be going in the wrong direction to me with some elements of this game
that large enemy type assassination animation needs more work in my opinion....
wow you can change the time\nnew Prince Of Presia confirm
Are the PC specs out yet?
Everything looks amazing! Hope it will be as great as AC 2 :)
Not a fan of the cruise missile arrow. How is that logical?
Why so much hate on an optional bow n an actually innovative game. And are ppl complainingly about a bow in a game of aliens,pieces of eden n animus software trickery.
You can control an arrow, but cant pick up bodies?
My only concern with the predator bow is not how unrealistic it is but how overpowered it looks. I'm afraid it'll make the game too easy.
Nothing is true, everything is permitted
controllable arrows . that is ridiculous .
Looks like their combining a little bit of Metal Gear 5 and Skyrim stealth.
They should have done controlable throwing knives instead of arrows if you ask me
Please tell me you can get rid of the stupid fucking points that come up every time you kill someone. It looks like they took it from borderlands or an arcade game
Can Bayek kick in Fighting in Battle like Run fast an  fly kicks Medjay Warrior kicks combination of kicks in his Medjay Fighting Style The Medjays Also Train in Different hand close combat like fight kicking his way out fights that what This Game is Missing Can Bayek do combination of Kick Moves while Fighting in Battle Incredible Epic
Why is there no cover system?
am i the only one who thinks that moving arrow is stupid?
For the most part I'm not a big game purist, I'm not sitting here saying no, it has to be like the old AC. In fact I love most of the new things. But I just can't get behind the controllable arrow. If they give a legitimate lore reason as to why you can control an arrow mid flight, then I'll accept it, but I'll probably still never use it. Feels like cheating to me
so no PC on 27th ?
Senu distracting the guards kinda reminds me of DD from Metal Gear Solid V :D
wtf were they thinking with the controllable arrow, this feels so wrong
Everything looks amazing but I think it'll be hard getting used to controlling an arrow.
Where's Blood Dragon 2!??!
The stupidest thing is that you can no longer kill an enemy with the hidden blade if your level is lower than theirs. Makes no sense
October 27th you say? I just so happened to book that Friday off work, and subsequently the following Monday.\nHell yea.
AC Origins PC version is going to be a bad joke of the year.
Ivaras navigator lmaooo y is that in ac 😕
The feeling when your favorite game of all time turns to this..
Love it can't wait
I dont want to say it feels like MGSV because MGS has some Assassins Creed elements as well, and I love both MGS and A C, but this reminds me of MGS V for some reason lol.
Can you guys release it early for my birthday which is the 19th
No multiplayer?
Assasins call of predator arrow
Excellent.
Heavenly Sword?!
No double Assasination?
Stealth is life :D
Far Creed Origins :v 1:53
Games is fantasy,its just for fun.so lets enjoy it gamers!
so i guess im turning off the hud and not using the arrow for the best experience.
still waiting on a World war 1 or 2 assassin creed game that or a cowboy one.
I'm so happy for games like MGS V and this one it seems. They are GAMES. It doesn't need to limit itself.
Well I guess I'm hyped, I just won't know where to start. People will do amazing things in this game and I'll just sneak around in those bushes.
ok 2 major problems. 1) Steerable arrow? This is even more WTF then the cloaking device from the last game. 2) You have a lone guy walking at night and have your bird attack him and yet you just pop out and put an arrow in his head. Why even use the bird.\nAnd WTF is with the giant MMO pop up damage numbers?
This game is very good in graphics,but if i try to buy and  install it in my pc ,it will blast...
WOW looks freakin great!!! I wanna buy this =D
WTF Arrow !!!?
i am so hyped <3
Dat AI
Controlable arrows? Wtf???
02:30\n\nNope. No thanks. I won't upgrade into that. No challenge at all. But the taming ability is cool tho.
Why can't they make a modern day assassin's creed please man bump this RPG I want a real arrow type assassin's creed
Hacer un juego que se parezca lo mejor posible a Egipto, que se vea muy real y luego le meten flechas que se controlan con control remoto. Claro que sí. 🙄 bien de época.
Chris Watters!
take out controllable arrows please
looks amazing asff
Mgs anyone?
It looks amazing!
MGS V +1
Nice
Far creed primal
I already ask my family if i can buy the game and they said yes!!!!
Can't wait to see how unfinished this game is when they release it. Broken animations, robotic movement, terrible combat, no social stealth, blending into crowds?\n\nWhat ever happened to Hiding in plain sight?
They've made it like the witcher 3, which ain't a bad thing at all
The combat looks fantastic. I can't wait. From what I've seen Ashraf Ismael knows exactly what he's doing. I hope he heads the rest of Bayek's trilogy.
I just wander if you can make the arrow fly in circle forever.LOL
Sorry to burst peoples bubbles, well not really. Any how, the truth is that no blacks were not ancient Egyptians. Recent research (yes it is true, look this up people, don't believe, listen and look up, believing in superstition is bs, same with the concept of belief, that's why we have science) has shown that indeed ancient Egyptians were not blacks, instead that ancient Egyptians were more closely European. However knowing that production of the game was some tike before the recent studies, the representation of ancient Egyptians will be inaccurate, or simply for diversity sake, yes it is mostly the first thing, however we've been going backwards for so long in the games story that we've skipped eras, so it's probably as well that they did his for diversity sake.
So a homing arrow is too much but a Pope with an energy manipulation staff, a Master Assassin who can make 20 of himself with a magic ball, an alien super civilization and an eternal reincarnating mad sage are totally fine????.... Go pound wet dirt with your unrealistic arrow comments guys
Seriously? Still no cover Animations in a stealth game. \n\nAnd after assassination kills the Nov just falls straight through Bayek?\n\nSoft cover in this game looks like you crouch down staring straight into a wall. Look at the last of us if you want a good example of soft cover. Even did it fairly well in Syndicate. Why is it gone???
LOL!!! Don't come for me. It's all fun and love. #SuperSixty is starting now! Which means I'm responding to comments for the next hour. AND GO! xo

Happy Hump Day, everyone! Coming atcha with a fresh episode of favorites! Let me know what you loved or tried this month here. 😊
Thanks for the book recommendation!
OMG!... you have a korean subs too ! I love it, Thank you
Can any body tell me how can I translate it and add the subtitle on?
You look so pretty. Your eye makeup is on point girl! And you are so damn hard working. How can you post so many videos in such a short time. I couldn't catch up with em all with my new college schedule. But I can never afford to miss your favorites video, can I? Love you sista!! Keep rocking!!
sooo weird, I just finished watching death note! loved it ofc! 💕 ily2 Jenn :)
Love that little blooper at the end 😂
We have the same birthday!! 💖 Belated happy birthday twin!
uuugh jenn, this video was tooooo short! Plus it was your birthday month!!
Jenn, I always look forward to your favorites! :)
Love your eye make up!!
i love how you did eyeshadow! would love to see a tutorial how to do it!
Yes Jenn!! Woo you need to get on that manga and anime train ASAP ☺ and continue on!
Jen, you have been missing out on mangas all your life!
I might be able to help with Japanese translation! If there is 2 people did the translation,how would you pick?
I am similar when it comes to scary movies the visual stays with me. 😣🙈
u can see death note in anime.the best!
So excited that you are starting to get into manga! There are sooo many good ones. One of the best classics is called Fruits Basket, which is quite different to Death Note (which is also great!) but it's one of my favourites :)
Hello everyone! My name is Roz, and I'm an aspiring musician who is search of support. If you don't mind? Please look up HipsterMusicUnlimited on SoundCloud, and see if you're moved by anything there. Thanks, and take care ✌️.
Is the title designer changed? I think the latest style is different from the others. No neon, poping
Ahh I've watched death note. I haven't read the book series but I promise the animation does it justice. Its a AMMMMAAAZZZIIINNNGGGGG
Death Note is great the movie should watch too which is brilliant there is Death Note one and two. I am not a fan of horror either and I do have a fear of clowns. The worst horror i watched was The Ring and The Grudge which left me having nightmares for weeks also i have black hair so whenever wash my hair the image just pops in my head and also when washing my face. 😣
Hello from Thailand! Thanks for all amazing videos with eng subtitle for ones who are not native speaker. It really helps me a lot so I feel like it's time to help you in return! I'm so busy these days but as soon as I have free time (+no one has done that),  I'd love to help you translate to Thai! 💗💗💗💗💗
Can you do a makeup tutorial on this makeup look? It's so pretty :)
Hi Jenn ! I am trying to translate your birthday vlog into Mandarin, but no 'add subtitles/cc' option there.  Could you adjust the setting or stuff ? love you xx
Jen! From where is your necklace?
Love that you involve books and movies in your faves <3
Hi jenn\nI translate your video to arabic hope it's will be out soon..\nthank you for your hard work 💛 have a nice day🍀.
i love death note!! <3
yasss, DEATH NOTE
YEEEES Death Note!
I had to pause the video because I'm laughing too much at butthole lips
I have the absolute same thing with horror images
The movie for wild is also so good as well
They made death note a movie!! You should check it out I think I watched it on Netflix with my boyfriend maybe about a month ago and it was really\nGood!! I didn't even know it was from a book
I translated pose video in korean <3 because that hour I spent on transcribing the video is nothing compared to how much you inspired my life :) Love you Jenn
Your eye makeup is gorgeous^ ^
TUTORIAL FOR THIS MAKEUP PLEASEEEEEE 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥
i want to help with indonesian subtitle but see someone already did that ^^ glad a lot of indonesian likes you, and also you include you perfect imperfection video in your top5 videos! one of my favorites, it really encouraging me to accept what i already have :)
My brother also pulled me in this manga world and now I'm rolling deeper than ever before. It's good to have a brother <3
Ruff Haus Blouse isn't back in stock :( so sad
Hi Jen! Just posted soms Dutch subtitles for this video. I love your videos and am happy to give something back.  Greetings from Belgium!
There is a series on netflix based on death note, maybe since you like the book you might also enjoy the series :)
OH MY GOD THE BURPING AT THE END. I just..... you are perfect 😂❤️
I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE ON THE DEATH NOTE BANDWAGON NOW. Such a classic :D
Can't stop staring at your make up! So pretty! <3
Yes! Death Note is sooooo good and trippy! They even have the anime on Netflix! Don’t recommend the movie though. 🙅🏻
Loveeee your recommendations, like every other month! I've been watching your favourite videos since 2014 and I'm still enjoying it loads! I really liked how you described the fear you have for horror movies because I feel the same way too! However, I've watched IT and yes I think it's watchable, even for me! :)
Death Note is pretty good tbh. You should watch the anime, it's dramatic. Btw, love you Jenn!
I swear you don't age at all ❤
Who was burping at the end 😩😩😩
Omg Jenn I’m so happy with there’s Korean sub!!!! 😍🎉💓❣️I’m Korean,  so sometimes i couldn’t understand English....😭
You should really try to do backpacking, 6 months ago with my school we did a religious walk about 140 km during a week we had to carry our bag with all our stuff (bed, food, clothes,..). That was the best experience a never had. Every night we sleep in church, school,.. In the morning we couldn't talk because this was a walk to know more about ourself. That was really amazing to have the chance to do that. I really push myself and learn so much. I hope you will have the chance to do something like that. <3
make up tutorial for this look please~ it is so beautiful! <3
makeup tutorial on this look! so pretty!
OMG imagining those scary things when you're washing your face? same! i thought i was the only one!
I absolutely love Wild! It helped me get through one of the most difficult times of my life... definitely inspired me to want to hike the Pacific Crest one day :) One of my favourite movies this month was First They Killed My Father, a stunning take on Cambodia's Khmer Rouge takeover during the 70's. And it's all from a child's point of view!
Love your makeup in this video!

Read this message from the top to the bottom. Even people that have sold their soul to the devil can get the contract broken by JESUS CHRIST. Even if you didn't, JESUS CHRIST loves you and HE wants you to become a Born-Again Christian for it is the only way to Heaven. To become a Born-Again Christian, you pray to JESUS CHRIST, apologize for being a sinner, ask HIM to forgive you, and follow HIS teachings of the New Testament and the Ten Commandments. Even people that have gotten microchiped have to get them removed as soon as possible,( even if you have to remove it yourself)

Love it, Trae. Agree with you 100%!
I think you're HILARIOUS !!  It is TRUE that 74% of Domestic Terrorists are WHITE MEN.  Check Google.
Over 500 people here in Vegas got introduced up close and personal to the 2nd amendment...I think the right to live out weighs the right to be a toy soldier....
your right, it ain't funny. it's so sad. w
I agree we need to do something
Guns don't kill people... people kill people.
Amen, little brother. When a nutjob shoots some congressmen, will THAT be the right time to talk about it?
What gun law would have stopped this man?
From Australia.wonderfully said my friend.
90+ people die from gun viloence *every day* in the US. More than 200 are injured.\n\nIn California, in order to drive a car, you must spend 25 hours of classroom time and six hours behind the wheel with an instructor. Then you must get a learner's permit and are required to have an adult licensed driver over the age of 25 with you whenever you're behind the wheel. After that, you must take a written test and flawlessly pass a practical test before you are legally allowed to drive on your own. You are also required to carry liability insurance for each passenger vehicle you own.\n\nIn 36 US states, there are no legal requirements for gun registration, no permit needed, no license necessary to purchase and own a firearm, and nothing compelling owners to carry liability insurance.
WHY NO GUN CONTROL? THE GIANT KOCH OWNERS OF THE USA DON'T WANT IT, THAT'S WHY\nWhy would government by the rich and for the rich care? -- it's poor people, the future Soylent Green, gettin' shot. Not until Alistair or Wellington shoots up a Billionaire party that takes out the Koch brothers and Isle 9 of the Walton owners will the corporate owned government be told to actually allow gun controls to be a thang -- and this all because madam Porsche thinks reasonable gun control might be a nice present for Natasha's sixteenth birthday since her family got shot up and all.
It's insanity every responsible gun owner I know already hates when morons get a hold of guns why can't we come to the table on this
You just expressed exactly how I feel.
And one more thing....can I have my own personal nuclear weapon?  Pleeease?... What?  Why not?  What about MY freedom  to do whatever the hell I please?  It's my adrenaline rush, baby, I love blowing shit up.  Don't worry, I'll go to a bombing range and only launch them at targets. I know what I'm doing.  I'm pretty sure no one will break into my house and steal any of my bombs when I'm not around.  Besides, nuclear bombs don't kill people, people do...
Man if only we pass the right policy people won't murder people any more. You're retarded dude. What exactly are we going to do that'll stop it? Yeah lets #stophate because it's completely feasible to legislate away the human condition.
Larry the Cable guy wants his comedy routine back you fake ass faggot.
Dear Americans.\nWhen you visit Europe, do you feel unsafe on the streets? Do you feel you must carry a gun for your own protection?\nNo?\nWhy is that?\nCould it be, that, because no one (NO ONE) in Europe walks around armed to the teeth? (It's illegal to carry as much as a knife in most countries) In some countries (UK for one) when you walk up to a police officer on the street, chances are they do NOT carry a gun. (They do carry tasers, so don't mess with them)\nUnless you go to some very shady areas, chances are you are 100% safe from the general population. \nAnd, frankly, I would like to point out, I've visited the US many times over the years. I've never felt the need to carry a gun, or any other weapon. Anywhere.\nSo don't give me this BS that you need a gun for your own protection. You don't. No one does. And if you do, then you better be in the Armed Services, because THAT is what your second amendment refers to. Not Joe Public on the street.\n(And btw -- most Europeans think the Americans are complete nutters when it comes to guns. It doesn't do you any favors.)
Trae is awesome as usual, but unfortunately most RNs where I'm from won't listen to him. Great guy!
well what would you consider a practical solution that doesn't involve screwing over the rights of millions upon millions of American citizens?
If people are hung up on armed citizenry/militia to stop 'tyrannical government', an argument that doesn't hold any water in modern warfare, civilians can not win against the military even with comparable weapons because training matters more then weaponry.  200 years ago 'training' consisted of pointing a gun in the direction of the enemy and being ballsy enough to not run away when the other side started shooting.  In other words it was not about skill so our revolutionary era minute men could fight without be utterly massacred by the Red coats.  Try that today and you get Syria.\n\nEurope is noted for having virtually no guns but their is an exception,  Switzerland.  They have UNIVERSAL militia memberships, everyone is ISSUED a gun and trained yet they don't have mass shootings because gun ownership is treated as a civil responsibility, recreational shooting is also popular in Switzerland but no one considers that a right.  Anyone serious about militia's for purposes of national defense and civil liberties would be all over the Swiss model, but no one in the Republican party is interested.
I love your words but something in this video made me stop and go Oh hell no, he didn't just say THAT! It seems the FAVORITE excuse for White Shooters is that they are/were crazy. You NEVER hear that being said regarding Black shooters. Please consider that the White Shooters are indeed sane and knew what they were doing.
Thank you Trae, for NOT making this video about laughs and righteous indignation.  How many more horrific events have to occur before we engage in honest discussion about keeping our families safe?  I ADORE your rants and laugh my a$$ off every time I watch but the death and injury of 500+ people warrants a sincere approach.  Well done.
When a toddler at a in-home daycare shoots two other toddlers with a gun in the house...then something is WAAYYYYYY beyond FUCKED UP!
gun license should expires like a DL, and a psych test be mandatory each time. Mental health has a bad stigma attached to it. When a person is on the edge rarely is anyone there to help..make guns illegal to stop the carnage, the war on drugs has worked SO well. (sarcasm) if you want to know what its like to have your cake but no right to eat it, take a trip to Singapore..disneyland with a death sentence.-look it up... -End of ramble.
Holy shit did you really get the go on an ABC show?! Yay!!! I hope it's true. Can't fucking wait!
From the Department of Homeland Security website: The number of Americans killed in acts of terrorism – both on U.S. soil and abroad — between 2001 and 2014 is 3,412 (including the victims of the 9/11 attacks). During the same period, 440,095 people died by firearms on U.S. soil (homicides, accidents, and suicides). In 2014, for every one American killed by an act of terrorism in the United States or abroad, 1,049 Americans died in the United States because of guns. http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20161005-comparing-u-s-deaths-from-terrorism-vs-gun-violence
I love you, Yeah, this IS the time to talk about it. Like Naomi Klein said, the ONLY time they want to talk about any issue is when nobody's listening.
Shooter was also a liberal. He specifically targeted conservatives at that concert.
They don't miss a beat to make it political when its a person of color or a Muslim as the perp.
This guy's a fellow liberal but a redneck and understands his people far better than me. Perhaps I'm more well spoken and college educated, but this man is profoundly smarter than me in several areas that I'm not remotely well versed on like he is. \n\nI love guns, when I go gun shopping what do I look for? I play a lot of L4D2. So I look for guns that I'd want in a zombie apocalypse. The next gun I have my sights set on is an RPK, with a 200 round belt belt fed magazine, and a bump-fire stock or a trigger hand crank. A bipod, a foregrip, and a scope, and a flash suppressor so the zombies can't see from which direction I'm firing from. I can have all this for less than $2,000.\n\nBut even as a lover of these weapons, I do find it somewhat absurd that any jackass off the street can get one of these, no questions asked.
You are trying and I appreciate that. Thank you.
The majority of gun deaths in America aren’t even homicides, let alone caused by mass shootings. Two-thirds of the more than 33,000 gun deaths that take place in the U.S. every year are suicides.
My favorite is when they say such and so is already in the law!  Oh yeah?  I guess this doesn't affect you then.  Get the fuck on board.  If it's law, we'll overwrite it with the same law and nothing changes except people can't say we didn't try something.
As a card carrying, hippy, commie, pinko who doesn't own a gun I couldn't agree with you more. In order to get my card I've had to wear a beard for 30 years. Always hard finding a good pair of scissors to occasionally trim with. Right next to my Kroger's is a salon supply store. They have REAL nice scissors. But you have to have a beauticians certificate to buy scissors at a salon supply. But I can go to one of the many pawn shops near my Kroger and buy an assault rifle or seven with my driver's license! Nope, nothing wrong here.
As much as I like your channel and content, I have to strongly disagree with you on this. You're a smart guy and have thought about the logical journey of we should just try to keep guns out of the hands of deranged people. In all cases, the deranged behavior was not noticeable in advance. You and I would be strongly against instituting Minority Report-type laws in this country. Our Constitution prohibits such laws.\n\nPeople, whether politically, religiously or mentally motivated will continue to kill people . . . some with firearms. This is a fact of life , not just here, but everywhere. To expect total safety is a stupid notion.
If a bunch of toddlers torn apart by gunfire didn't do the trick nothing will. Y'all are doomed to relive this nightmare over and over again.\nWith every new incident the chance of somebody you love being among the dead increases.\nFrom Holland, with love I wish for all the sane ones among you to be spared.
I just found you, via a thread on FB. Awesome stuff. I have a question and request...because I can see how you resonate well, could you do some over your more poignant pieces (guns, kneeling, etc.) in a cleaner version? Personally, I don't care, but I do think there are folks in my circle that would miss the message because they'd focus on the vulgar language (convenient, and true). Just a thought...you make such valid points
The Vegas shooting was, if I'm correct, the 273rd mass shooting in 2017. The day after was the 275th day of the year, so my question for those saying it's too soon to talk about it is...when in the ever-living fuck CAN we talk about it?? At this rate, there will NEVER be a right time and at this rate it will ALWAYS be too soon. Proposing common-sense solutions to prevent tragedies of this magnitude from happening in the future is NOT heartless, it's quite the opposite. What IS heartless is offering thoughts & prayers while continuing to do NOTHING. (and this is coming from a christian, y'all.) People can continue to say it's too soon to talk about it, but for thousands of families who lose their loved ones to gun violence every year in this country, it's too late.
I have an idea for a starting point: how bout we start at the top? When we can demilitarize the police, and stop our military from illegaly invading every country with their highly- advanced weaponry, then we can start talking about regulating the weaponry of the citizenry. Until then, it's ass backwards to talk about limiting the citizenry. Should the police and military be more heavily armed than those they supposedly serve? I have asked so many people about the global evidence: how many of those countries which have disarmed their people have standing armies and militarized police? Nobody has been able to answer this. \nAnd, yeah, this shit stinks to high heaven, white, black, purple, green, i don't give a rat's ass...\nI also don't believe a bunch of brown people highjacked some planes with box-cutters, and flew them into buildings unassisted, knocking down 3 towers with 2 planes and yada yada yada; but everyone just emotionally reacts, understandably, and starts talking about we need our heavily armed, aggressive, invading government to regulate our choices. \nIt's topsy-turvy, yo
Your points are so valid. People need to hear this. Gun control doesn't mean take ALL guns away. It means limiting specific guns that have no need to be in civilian hands.

Intelligent men are so sexy.
Watching this from Germany, and couldn't agree more with what you're saying. Thank you for making a point here, particularly with your personal background. We need more people like this standing up for the cause.\n\nOh and btw: I'm not saying that German gun laws are perfect, but at least we have some mechanisms in place that make it considerably harder for anybody to obtain firearms in the first place.
Trae, I wish you lived near me and were my friend. It's hard to find friends who make sense like you where I live.
you're foundation is broken man....
Background checks for Bump Stock devices would be a good start.
Mmmmmm mmmm you are way too clear in your mind and way too objective with your views on what the truth is about this topic. You are a libtard fella!  Just like me!  I have been thinking that someone should try to start a reaction to this shooting that could put pressure on American business to move against this insanity by forming an organization to support the prevention of anyone entering their premises with a gun. Put up detection and screen the people entering your store, theatre, or any private property that can make their own rules. Once enough business has joined it will finally bring some competition into the market place to provide safety for customers!  Tourism industry should also be a part of it!  I am pretty sure international travelers are going to be affected by this because there are a lot of them in LV. Remember when the MGM fire happened?  There was just a little movement to encourage installation of sprinklers for safety in hotels. It turned out that so many organizations threatened businesses with only placing their conventions in safe locations that almost every major hotel made the change. And that is a lot bigger investment than some scanners at entrances and a few sign, maybe in some instances even a security guard to stop anyone who sets off the alarm. Hell, the business could even threaten the offender with civil action and have the offenders pay for the cost. \n\nWhat do you think?  Why don't you use the idea in your show and on your channel!  As I have said before you are a breath of fresh air and I would like to see you become a major influence for better things for Americans!  Hell, you could have a way better America First policy than the Donald!  And I mean it. Plus he doesn't even rate in the excitement of young chicks department!
I'm in the extremely unusual (on the Internet, at least) position of being a dedicated, dyed-in-the-wool gun nut who HATES most Republican/rightist stances.  I consider myself a centrist/progressive and normally Trae here is my *man* ...but in this one instance I feel a desire to voice...not so much *objection* as conscientious counterpoint?\n\nPassing laws will not stop criminals from obtaining guns illegally, because criminals are people who do illegal things.  People have the strange notion that Cracking Down on Guns, making it incredibly difficult or even impossible to get guns, will stop gun crime in this country.  There are a number of reasons why this stance is flawed, and why I feel like blaming the guns for these shootings is missing the point.\n\n1.) there are already a banananillion guns in the U.S..  We don't need to be able to buy *new* ones in order for there to be plenty of firepower around for people to do each other in with.  Other countries can get away with no, our citizens will not ever be armed because they were never armed in the first place.  This country?  Not so much.\n\n2.) Firearms manufacturers have been making it a point to end-run firearms control laws since firearms control laws have been a thing.  Create a newer, stricter set of legal standards to define 'Assault Weapon', and firearms manufacturers can, will, and *do* figure out how to kajigger a new firearm such that it doesn't legally qualify as an assault weapon under those laws.  Whatever method is left for people to purchase Regular Sporting Guns with, firearms manufacturers will find ways to make those guns as close as possible to being the things people actually want to buy.  because that's how you make money as a firearms manufacturer - you make guns that people want to buy.\n\nMost importantly, 3.) The Vegas shooter's *guns* did not decide to kill dozens of people and injure hundreds more.  The Vegas shooter did.  As Trae himself pointed out, this is concrete evidence that the man was deranged.  And yet, rather than seeking to improve upon this country's *disgusting* infrastructure and methodology for finding, helping, or even restraining if no other choice is left to them, people with mental instability and other issues...folks want to lock up all the guns and tell perfectly healthy law-abiding citizens like myself who simply happen to enjoy shooting sports as a hobby that we're *all* deranged psychopaths who need our guns taken away and for all the other guns in the country to be melted down into commemorative spoons.\n\nControlling guns does not stop violent people from doing violent things.  Could gun laws in this country use revision?  Oh my GAWD yes; not only are they ineffective for the purposes that terrified/furious anti-gun citizens are asking of them, they're a confusing contradictory *mess* that's almost impossible to keep fully straight.  They've needed rewriting for decades.  But we shouldn't be talking about getting rid of them or making them impossible to own without jumping through hoops so high and on-fire that no one bothers.  Gun ownership is indeed part of American culture, one of the things that makes us *us*.  \n\nCan we do better?  Absolutely.  But I never shot anyone or anything that wasn't a target on a range post.  I don't hunt, I don't carry, I don't actually support the NRA despite my deep enjoyment of the hobby because those guys are just...no.  I'm a regular, sane, everyday Trae fan who can't figure out why Trump hasn't been impeached yet, has no idea why people can't get over their gender issues, and who just also happens to be into hobby shooting.\n\nWhy should I suffer, lose access to my favorite outdoor hobby, and suffer the same condemnation and scorn as a deranged criminal whose actions I detest and condemn as much as every one of you?
Thank you for always straight shooting it and not coloring over anything....
Keep up the good work Trae.
With you all the way, Trey. Keep proving all of us Southerners aren't all alike. We're not all GOP Trump/tea party supporters. Some of us believe in gun control. Some of us aren't racist. Thanks!
It's only important to ban guns when white people die. Black lives don't matter.
Just saying, but criminals kind of don't follow laws...
Go far enough left you get your guns back.  Do you really want to disarm the left when Trump sits in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave?
I like your comments. However, I have a suggestion for you to consider. Record a monologue without vulgarity.
Why is your shirt inside out Trae? Love you Trae!
So refreshing to hear someone with a southern redneck accent and a background with guns say it like this. Thank you.
Amen.  Nice to see someone with common sense.  New subscriber.  Fact is both sides need compromise.  10 round clips and one gun a month.  Whats out there already stays out there.  The ATF needs to bury manufactures of these automatic conversion add ons.  You want 30 round clips and full auto, sign up and serve in the military.
I love this! I posted a rant on FB that says a lot of these same things. Thank you.
What I find so disturbing about pushback against common sense steps to control access to guns by those unfit to do so is the total lack of empathy on the part of those unwilling to compromise. I'd imagine that any 2nd Amendment advocate who lost a child, sister, mother, father or other loved one in Las Vegas would have a hard time arguing against closing the loophole in gunshow sales, internet sales and person to person sales today. Would have a hard time arguing against the outlaw of devices like the bumpstock or trigger crank, disallowing the sale of drum magazines or extended magazines. These are just common sense steps against items that should never have been allowed in the public domain in the first place. But until these people suffer through a tragedy like that in Las Vegas, Orlando, Virginia Tech or San Bernadino, they can't even begin to have a little empathy for their fellow human being and say, how would I REALLY feel if that happened to me or someone I loved. It can't alway be about ourselves and what we feel is best for us as individuals but needs to be about what is best for us as a nation and human beings. Great video, new subscriber here.
You make some great points and relate enough to start a conversation, I do disagree though ..only because it's not that the government won't tyrannically take over now it could happen years from now a century from now .. and it might not even be the government but an overthrowing of a country or a civil war of sorts or a revolutionary war ...but yes something has to be done !
Satan has been cast down to earth.  Greed and lust have always been with us, but what we are seeing right now is about impossible to explain any other way.  All the gun control in the world, and the cops still have guns.  This man could have easily qualified to become a police officer, had he set out to do so at some point earlier.  And he is not deranged.  This was planned years in advance.  He committed himself to serve Satan early on, and he did exactly that until the very end.
Nothing will change. It will be thoughts and prayers everybody will look appropriately solemn for 10 minutes, then screw that back to normal.
It's more attitude than anything.  Take, for example, when your grandfather was young.  Guns were not glorified nor was violence, most people hunted, even city folk.  This is the difference of today when most don't actually know how to handle firearms safely nor are the people who commit such tragedies getting the mental health care they need to prevent an horrid crime such as the Vegas Shooting.  That is where the line should be drawn.  Gun control just slaps and band aide on the symptom and does not address the underlying disease.  That and manufacturers should stop producing such overly powered firearms to begin with, if they didn't exist, they wouldn't get used.
Keep up the fight for sanity!  And you are awesome!
I have a suggestion, how about a 30 day no wait, a 90 day wait to purchase a gun. Oh that'll never happen. Instead I say let's repeal the 2nd amendment. LIke that would ever work.
You are a great voice of reason! This should be seen by many more people.
Seems simple keep guns out of the hands of demotards since all these mass shooters are democrats and your about as redneck as Jimmy Kimmel I think if you actually fired a gun you would fill your loafers full of piss how about if we ban all assault rifle because they sure as shit won't be flowing in over the boarder like the drugs and illegal immigrants so that way all the criminals can have them and the law abiding citizens cant maybe start with the media and the hate baiting this guys a democratic extremist or has ties to radical islam
Once again you nail it.  Wonderful nuanced interpretation (from a fellow gun-owning liberal, living in the South for 20 yrs) of a very difficult situation.
Ignorance is when you don’t even know what you don’t know. There is an extreme amount of ignorance expressed and exposed when it comes to the issue of guns and gun control mania.
I liked that one joke. You are funny. Lol lol 😂
Thank you, Trae.  I wish you were crazy enough to run for office.
Why don't we have a real investigation into all of the mass shootings because I get the feeling we haven't heard the truth on any of them and no I don't trust fox
the gun lobbyist will never let it happen.. they want to legalize silencers... fackin silencers!
Oh crap. I thought this was the show you made after the last big mascal.
Trae Crowder, we already try.  There are background checks.  Full auto is illegal.  Be detailed.  What is you want that we don't already have?  This guy was rich, with no criminal record, and apparently did a passable impression of sane person.  Be specific, what do you want?  Then we'll dismiss your ideas when they involve a full registry (which allows for gun confiscation in the future) or a total gun ban in the present.
And what is your plan? Let the liberals decide who is mentally fit to own a gun? The same people who think there are 13 different genders and who think it's okay to put 8 year old kids on hormone treatments and gender reassignment surgeries? Are you retarded?
I love what he's saying, but I'm just wondering... Is there a reason why his shirt is inside out?
So let me get this straight. You want to take away weapons from people who are under an oppressive government, who murder blacks on an epidemic proportion by police who are militarized, serving a country who invades foreign land for oil? I have news for you, emotional idiots... resistance cant be won with pussy hats.... btw, that was all sarcasm... but your logic has a major hole.
Thank you, Trae, for this video.\n\nI was attending an overnight training conference with my work group when we got news about this shooting.  One of my colleagues really pissed me off when she went on her right wing rant.  If there had just been a good guy with a gun, this all could have been prevented.  If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.  It took a lot of restraint not to say something...\n\nLike you, I am fed up with all the excuses people keep giving once these mass shooting happen.  Then we have the sniping back and forth between left and right over access to firearms.  Sorry, but firearm ownership is not and never will be illegal in this country.  But yes, guns DO kill people, and no, one good guy with a gun would have done NOTHING in this instance.  For God's sake, these mass shootings are not the price of freedom, people.  Like Trae said, when the fuck is enough going to be enough for the gun nuts in the NRA?!?  You might still be harboring illusions of fending off tyranny from the gubmint, but the rest of us not living in Fantasy Land are tired of the carnage.
we really must do something about that people, otherwise God forbids, we or our loved ones could be the next shooting victims.
There was another shooting where 3 died & two were hurt, that would have been in the news, if not for this horrible tragedy. Some twenty-somethings were leaving a bar in Lawrence KS, after celebrating the start of the KU Jayhawks basketball season. They were just having fun, like I did many times when I was a student there. There was a fist fight going on outside & one stupid a-hole pulled a gun. The mom of one victim is an ER nurse in KC. She had suggested going out in Lawrence, because the bar district in KC tends to be more dangerous...😔 BTW, Kansas has permit- free concealed carry & all state university campuses have to allow concealed carry, too. 2nd amendment rights are important, but why do some people act like they are the most or only important right to safeguard? What about the right to go to a freaking concert/ movie/ bar without getting killed for no damn reason?! 💔
Just an excellent speech, Trae. I hope it sparks some people to at least think about the madness of these massacres and change their thinking on this issue rather than just dismissing it out of hand. Of course, I thought gun laws would change when the children at Sandy Hook were slaughtered, but it didn't make one bit of difference. I'm becoming numb to shootings because it's just so fucking frustrating that nothing ever changes. But I do really appreciate this and all of your videos, and hope that you continue to speak out. (And just for your information...normally, you are very funny. Screw the haters!)
Hopefully a white guy takes care of you too. All of you left wing racists need to be corpsed.  Go white guys!
( This guy had explosives because he was rich are you people deranged? Guess who else is rich and has explosives and doesn't mind collateral damage involving innocents....hmm which group of people could I be talking about?? )
You hit the nail on the head! \nCant get any more obvious that we have a huge problem with not only guns but racism, being bias, and simply covering up the truth. Unless  and until we admit there's a problem we won't ever be able to fix the problem. We must start with... Hello, I'm American and if you have one drop, I'm not gonna like you...
Always speaking the fucking truth👏🏼 You're amazing. Keep it up. 💕
Bravo, sir!  Well said.
my h sticks
Showing love from Sacramento!!!
Thank you, Trae Crowder.
Amen
Thanks
We love you, Trae!
I keep hoping
Thank you
Your shirt is inside-out.
I agree completely.
Nailed it once gain Trae. Love ya.
Fakest accent ever makes sense with all this #FAKENEWS
They stand with Vegas but not with Mexico
Why was Shane there
Dean looks like he's about to bust a nut.
why not pray for Syria ? \nthey are not humans ??
bray whyat??
You know my thoughts and prayers  are with the victims
We all just need to take moment and look at Dean ambrose
Really well done soooo quite really respectful well done Wwe and it’s fans
272 people will have their souls taken by the Undertaker.
Peoples were saying jinder mahal was also there ....where is he...???
I'm starting to think that dislikes on youtube are automatic... like who can dislike something like this???
Where's sin Cara!!! Is he still in WWE?
What's was the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas (L.V)
May God give peace to their souls who are died in that Las Vegas attack 😔😔
are you a short WWE Superstar??  ok, we need you in the back
Today's wrestling crowd might not be as active or loud as the crowd was 10-20 years ago, but at least their more respectful at actually being silent in moments of silence for tragic occurrences like the one in Vegas.
Thanks for the moment of silence it means a lot
Couldn't even make it a full minute...
I stand with Las Vegas, much love from Glasgow, Scotland
It is so confusing to see a arena with people that are completely silent ...🙊
No way it got that silent I bet someone yelled something
What happen in vegas stay in vegas.
Thank You WWE. For this heartfelt remembrance of the victims and families of Las Vegas..
what was Shane doing on raw
its funny how they try to make it all look real and make it seem like guys actually dislike eachother in wwe then everyone suddenly a family for things like this.I am not saying them coming together to support vegas is wrongs i am just saying its quite funny cuz next monday you gonna see reigns spearing cena and sstrowman
I'm surprised Alexa broke character for once
I always like moments like these, mainly because I like to compare superstar heights, and damn it looks like Gallows is taller than Strowman here.
Why is shane on raw?
Roman front an center next to vince, showing what a suck up he is
World class this is, fair play
*SHANE, YOU'RE EXPOSING THE BUSINESS!*
Do it for all the terror attacks . Hate has no state or country
I no the Manchester London attacks weren't in America it would have been nice for a tribute for those as wwe fans r worldwide.
Vince in the middle with his 2 boys.What a happy family.
It was very terrible what happened in Las Vegas. This was the 1st time the WWE held a moment of silence without the bell ringing 10 times because of a tragedy since the tragedy in Orlando over a year ago. God help both those cities.
That was so silent i thought my earbuds stoped working
STOP THE HATE pray for Vegas
Wow I haven't seen Vince or Tj in a long time.
It rally suvks when something like this has to happen in my hometown.
i don't get why anybody would dislike this
Respect to all the Families who lost a loved one in Las Vegas
I was watching the opening of the Redskins vs Chiefs game; saw some jerk sitting on the bench during the Anthem and fan(atics) making noise during the Moment of Silence.\n\nSwitched it over to Raw (I had waiting for me on DVR Double Play) and you could hear a pin drop during the Moment of Silence.\n\nClass!
Why are there so many attacks in different places I mean this HAS to STOP
lolz, theres no way that the wrestlers actually care about what happened xD
My prayers and thoughts to people lost life and got hurt in Los Vegas and Puerto Rico and Miami Florida and Texas and Mexico anywhere at.And plus we lost a lot of music singers and celebrity this year too.Tom Petty,The guy from Steely Dan passed away Walter Becker.And guy own a lot of game shows and TV shows has passed away to Monty Hall today the Co-Creator Let's make's a Deal.This is just sad day...😢😢😢
Hey what happens in vegas stays in vegas😂😂
I live in Las Vegas
Of course Bayley is standing next to Finn Balor
Hmmph\n\nWell, it looks like the one armed bandits struck again......\n\nI'll just pay my respects and see myself out.
Pray for the World!!! Lets have a moment of silence for the world daily
Kurt angel makes a traingel sign off illuminati wake upp
Never heard the arena so quiet
Its so sad and to know i was right across from everything at the luxor was even scariest
The people who disliked the video fick yourself
Is it really that many superstars on raw
We stand with los Angeles...
God bless USA
Tozawa sleeping during this period.

TOZAWAAAAA\nHA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA
#prayformossad/ciaoperation
raw only?
Why do they keep putting real world events in a scripted tv show?
Strowman must be finished with Roman after all.
And what about México and Puerto Rico?
BORING!! No Body cares!
What was the motive behind those attacks? Just someone suddenly goes mad and starts killing people and himself also??
This is the proof that wwe is scripted. Why? Because they are totally enemy but they are joining together.
20 people got shot the man who shot the people killed himself to 💧💧💧💧💧💧💧💔💔💔💔💔
Now...I just wish I can experience Autumn 😫 Philippines....Y u has no autumn!!!

O Brasil se entristece com essa perda. Mais um rockeiro amado por todos q se vai. Os  céus se alegram com sua chegada, Tom. Aqui sentiremos sua falta.   : (
Fuc dude. Its kinda weird cuz my parents went to one of the last three concerts he did about a week ago. Like they just saw him on stage and then a week later he died dude. I think its safe to say that this fuckin sucks. Fuck.😓
Godspeed man- You were well loved!
Who are the mindless, shallow dickheads that gave this a thumbs down? Really?
Just saw him in Boston. Didn't sound any different then 20 30 years ago. Amazing! You will be deeply missed
one of the best sad to see him leave us so soon great   spirit love  his music
Your music got me through some really rough times Mr. Petty. Albums like Fill Moon Fever, Into The Great Wide Open, Wildflowers, Echo, your earlier music and of course everything you did with The Traveling Wilburys. I could always count on you just like an old friend. I'm going to be bummed out for a while, but maybe I'll get to see you again at the Great Rock 'N Roll Concert in The Sky.
sorry all I think about is it puts the lotion in the basket
great video . icon
Rest in peace
Six, six, six the number of the beast.
R.I.P. and thanx for all!!!
Good by tommy you hearts❤
farewell big friend, see you in heaven
I think he looked worse at that time (2002) than the later videos I have seen.
Tom Petty.........one of the greatest artists.  He left us so many gifts and treasures in his music. A story teller with a  brilliant way to tell them.  His music will be enjoyed forever. 💔
Tom was the man. Quick tribute to him https://youtu.be/URvULdzvdmU
Words can't describe his talent and PASSION for what he loved.  A great legend will be missed. Thanks for all the songs that we can always listen to. Thinking of his family also.
Agradeço de coração o trabalho realizado por Tom Petty nos final dos anos 80 com a banda The Traveling Wilburys. Suas músicas ficarão eternamente em meu coração. Que o Pai Celestial receba sua alma com muito amor.
Dedicated to Patrick MicCarty from Redlands (sorry for the horrible spelling)
thanks tom for hanging tuff with me in the hard times your music is greatly appreicated
Rest in peace.Rock n roll,Tom petty.
Yes we will always miss him loved his music to .
From all of us American Girls, who dream about there being more to life than what is offered to us...thank you Mr Petty for your brilliant lyrics and endless life sound track....
thank you.\nthank you.\nyour songs is my treasure.\nR.I.P.
Great artist.I learned to sing my favorite song at Karaoke,Free Fallin way before u passed away.Did it for the first time several weeks ago and I was surprised I could hit your pitch when  u sang I’m freeeeee,free fallin.I’ll always be in my repritore of Karaoke songs.
Rest in Peace Tom Petty (1950-2017)
Rock and Roll heaven just gained another great one.  We will continue to celebrate you and your wonderful songs and music <3
I had tickets to see Tom Petty and the band for a special show next week, I wonder if it will be canceled?
He already looked so aged, and this was fifteen years ago. Somehow his passing makes sense. RIP
Mary Jane's Last Dance \nI hear Crosby, Stills Nash & Young, The Beatles & Dillon Wow!!!
So many great songs!!  You will be missed!!!
Thank You Tom Petty! \nWhat you've left us will rock on in our hearts, in our souls, (& in our ears! ;-)
I miss you man you are my hero
I love you❤️ thank u so much for everything, rest in peace x
His voice sounds so awful compared to the studio recorded version.
Great & Awesome\n\nSubscribe, watching & download mp3 On My Channel :-D\ngoo.gl/cICvOy
R.i.p Tom petty you shall be missed
She Died Real GooD 😔😓
My fave song. I just loved his sound. It is unique and never be copied
You really did break our hearts this time :(
Thank you for being the best road trip companion a girl could ever want!  nothing beats rolling down the windows, singing American Girl, open road ahead
Every American boy's dream:\nOh yeah, all right \nTake it easy baby \nMake it last all night \nShe was an American girl\nTom, you were the American Boy for me. RIP my brother
I miss him :( this is just makes me cry💔
too much early go away Tom!
Thanks for the great music, Tom!
I will never forget his opening day,,,Play that Rickenbacker guitar
Got to take a trip down to Dreamville, spend some time under the trees.
R.I.P. you well be missed.  You're in a much better place.  Rest well...
Eight of us travelled 6000 miles (us 2 in an RV) to see Tom Petty and The Heart Breakers at Red Rocks,  May 30th, 2017. Not sure we'd do that for another artist. RIP Tom and TY.
saw him at the Forum in LA, Steve Winwood opened for him. BEST CONCERT EVER!
Tom Petty, my heart is so broken. You will be missed, but never forgotten!! You were the best there ever was and that's for real. \nI just wish he hadn't picked you so soon. \n                       RIP  Tom
RIP to a legend 🙏🏼
You died too early Tom. I remember the first song my grandfather showed me of yours. Never back down Tom. Rest in peace
RIP, Tom Petty. You will be missed :(  Your music lives.
I fist him ,I thought  the  Byrd  were  back, I just  back from  Nam\n\nthanks Tom
I.  Grew.  Up.  Listening to.  Tom. Petty 😰

FUTURE ARDEN KILLED ME 😂
Arden with red lipstick🙌🏻🔥😍
I love how you state your genuine opinions! & babe you’re at 40 on trending omg!!
And now it's me bitch😂 I fucking love u arden😂😂
she reminds me of the girl in girlboss
Strong 80's vibe and you looked dang good 😍
ARDEN. You are truly iconic and I love you with all my heart. By far my favorite YouTuber.
YOUR APPARTMENT LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL
i bought the whole PR bundle because of this vid <3
Arden, that is not what gregarious means. Still love you tho
excuse me but that hot pink lip was actually stunNING ON YOU
gregarious means sociable.... what does that have to do with the packaging lol
Two things, first love your aesthetic girl, i would pick you as a friend because the way you talk about objects as they were people 💘
Would love to see a chit chat/advice video sometime in the near future xo
Heya Fellas! This Is Brilliant! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕀𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖𝕤 ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Claimyourfreepromocode
You look very fresh in this video, like you barely have makeup on. I love it. Plus i recently saw on instagram you saying that you don't have as many views as you used to. I've been watching you for at least two years and to be honest except for the times when you wouldn't upload for like a month or something (which is understandable because you were shooting) i've really enjoyed watching your videos and that hasn't changed. I can imagine that you are not happy with this situation and i hope you start getting as many views as you used to. I'm actually writing all of this because i would like to give you examples of the videos i love watching so that you can have the idea of what attracts people (or at least me lol). I feel like you do too many hauls and i know a lot of people love them and maybe that's just my opinion but a few hauls of the glasses or lingerie might get a little boring after a while. I love watching kind of sit and talk videos where you share some of your experiences and maybe a storytime. I remember you used to make a lot of those a few years ago where you would sit and drink tea and just talk about interesting things that are important to you. I don't want you to feel like i'm intruding because it's really not what i'm trying to do. I'm sorry this comment is so long but i hope you take the time to read it and maybe reply? You have no idea how much i would appreciate that. It would mean a lot to me if you wrote what you think about my ideas. I love you Arden, have a good day xx
The red lipstick you are wearing is AMAZING! What colour is it? I absolutely need it
That pink lip rly wasn't that crazy? Lol. And tbh I felt the bright pink kinda suited you more than the red you were wearing before! Idk I feel the cooler tones are nicer.
do you ride a little pony?
Gorgeous!
I love being politely served Jessica day vibes
Ardennn please please share where your accessories are from! (earring, necklace, ring) NEED THEM! thank you xx
Does Arden draw all the little things she adds to her videos?...
Some kinda beautiful lady you are....
Did she say she doesn't know many people that would wear a pinky purple lipgloss? Really??
You are a lot more relaxed in this video. You are doing something you are genuinely interested in and enjoy which makes for a better video!
Where are your earrings from?

I love how she would wear the pony print packaging as a coat but she thought a pink lip color would be too much
Hey girly! New subby just wanted to let you know Moschino just did a my little pony collection ss18 they might have done coat lol
How tf is this on trending
Where is your top from
Arden, you beautiful unicorn, what was that red lipstick you were wearing at the start? Also, could you do a look with that dark purple + gold lip sometime? I'm curious to see how they go together. 💖
arden you kill me you are hands down my fave
GOD THIS WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
Thank GOODness they used the original artwork. This makes me so dang happy 😊
Does anyone know if the collection is limited addition?

Sees My Little Pony in the title 😀\nSees it's about old generation 😲
you are my aesthetic. the set-up for this video was so bomb
I craved something sweet after i watch this video. Probably the color theme reminds me of candy jar
You need to find some more exciting ppl in your life makeup wise if you didn't think you'd know many ppl to wear that lip. :) \nLove your vids girl.

casually appreciating your beauty + all the colors 🍒
Wish the shadow colors were more bright and matte 😔
The lips look great!!! You look so beautiful what the hell Arden
i mean listen... SHE'S PINK!!
Omg I spent the whole video trying to figure out if the posters in the back where from Firewatch and I was like probably not and then when Future Arden said I got you I just lost it. I loved that game
Fucking love you
I want that freaking tote bag bitch! 😋😍

That necklace is amazing, does anyone know where it's from?
um you're kind of a bitch lol
you remind me so much of jessica day from new girl in this video !!!!
I'm only watching this because I like hearing your voice and admiring your face.
Does anyone know where she got the posters in the background?
MOMMY YOU'RE TRENDING!!!!
Shit like this happens so often in the middle east where people have no money at all. Even in Europe, we have terrorist attacks that claim this many lives a little too often. Yet when one of the richest countries in the world gets hit, you start a gofundme x)
Hands down the best vlog you’ve done so far Casey. 👏🏽🙌🏽 Thank you Casey
Money doesn't count. It's the lives and people who will be remember and the speech. It makes us realise that the world can be changed.Thank You Casey.
So happy to see this, I have shared to my facebook. Your good heart is a movement that we all need right now. Thank you!
Can't believe YouTube 'refuses' to monetize this video (as you said- for charity) while Jimmy Kimmel makes a video on the same topic and gets ads shown. \n\nUnless you're directly in the pockets of the mainstream networks, I guess you're done for. All the channels I follow/used to follow are getting hit one by one.
This was a horrible tragedy, i understand why it has gained so much attention. Loss of life will always be very important and shoking, especially the way these people died and people that were injured. But at the same time i ask that you do not forget about what is happening to 3.4 million americans (including myself) right now in Puerto Rico, people are dying in the thousands, because of the indirect effects of this catastrophe, many because they dont have electricity, or water, or even food. Some are even taking their own lives due to the hard times we are facing. Our voices are still not being entirely heard, we need help. I ask that you help those who where victims of Vegas, but also, please do not forget about us, the little pearl in the Carribean. Because if help doesnt come, many more will keep dying, its our very ways of lives that are at stake.
I love u. Thanks for always helping
How could 2k people not like this video..?
My friends anit got shoot but did not die
I think YOU should run for president Casey!!!!
Casey you're an amazing person
I just don't like this guy.  He's trying to come off as genuine and I'm looking right through it.
i dont understand how an act of kindness like this warrants dislikes and bad comments
There was no ad at the end of the video like you had mentioned.
Hey Casey, if you really want to help people who need it, take on the Chicago gang violence problem. This one involves ALOT of GUNS.  Illegal guns! Do this and it may appear you're being genuine, and not just trendy. You’ve got the commanding youtube presence to have an effect.
inb4 YouTube unmoneti... oh wait they already did
thank you
Put inplace some gun laws

Pray and god ain't enough. At the end of day you still hungry. You can't pray to not be hungry. \nYou need action.
The world is a dark place that’s for damn sure
If some of the men in this world, especially US, were a little more secure within themselves they wouldn’t need even bigger guns as an extension of their penis to feel like a big powerful man.
Thank you for doing this Casey.  You have a great soul.  Just think...if all your subscribers just donated even $1.00.  I know you will do the best with the funds you raise.  Peace to you and your family Casey.
Felt the same way in that order! :”(
what about Puerto Rico they can actually use that money to save lives.
Thank you for calling it what it is.. TERRORISM. We have to understand that terrorism is any person who attempts with the life of a group or others. It seems that our president only thinks is terrorism when the perpetrator is Muslim or from a minority group. thank you, Casey, ​for been altruistic and using this platform to help people.
Blood offering as it's best. Satan loved the blood shed.
He wasn't a terrorist he was just as bad as one he just doesn't fit the definition of terrorist
casey is such a beautiful soul
Because you know so many victims, huh? What bs. You sure your not a girl, dude? So emotional. Gimme $? Wtf? Douche...
I just got back from PR but i have two team members there - there are people in the mountains of the east, west and central that are dying.\n\nWe have done search and rescue in TX, FL and PR and we just cant do it by ourselves any more. Is there any way you can contact me and maybe help us get the word out?\n\nI am in Myrtle Beach South Carolina and am trying to acquire satellite coms and enough supplies (food and water) to send one private charter back over and the rest by container so i can get back to help my team. Initially we found 500 people stuck in the mountains ESE of Anasco and were hard pressed to get anyone to help - we are starting to gain momentum but after the Las Vegas incident - PR is old news to people . We get messages and phone calls daily of loved ones stuck in the mountains and bodies decomposing as they've died due to starvation and dehydration.\nWe started a non-profit called \n\nWeCan Disaster Relief and Recovery and have had a very small amount of donations.\n\nI am not asking you for money - i am asking you for any type of assistance you think you can help with.\n\nThe news is not telling the story and my team needs me back there to help ASAP. \n\nMy number is 843-340-2110
Thank you Casey, my cousin was shot in the leg in the shooting, went to surgery and insurance only wanted to pay part of it
Terrorist?? Do you know something the FBI doesnt?
Gods Promise:   God didnt promise days without pain, laughter without sorrow or sun without rain. but God did promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears and light  for the way.

Awesome stuff Casey! What about a gofundme page to fund gun danger awareness and lobbying movement against the NRA promoting the sale of military grade guns??
Very good Casey !!! Thats very thoughtful of you mate !
I know your not looking for Kudo's Casey, But thank you for being so thoughtful, and for using your youtube platform to benefit those in need. I gave what I could.
“One flys high not by himself but with the help of the wind” We all need each other....... Thank you Casey for all that you and others do to make this beautiful world even nicer.
Thank you from Las Vegas
You are the man Casey! This makes me so happy you are doing this.
how can someone dislike this video, please tell me, i try to understand these retards.
Nice getting ad revenue from the Vegas shooting, you're a great guy Casey
Hi Casey, are you for or against guns. If against why not make a video on your channel for the ban of guns. And more stringent regulations on the purchase on a weapon that its only intension is to take a life. All I see on the news is death by guns. You can make this happen with the power of your channel. Love you and love what you stand for. Ger Murphy - Ireland
Blame the government I don't believe this one bit\n\n media knows to much already in a few days
thank you Casey for calling that monster what he really is, a Terrorist. not that 'lone wolf' bullsh*t. \nGod Bless To All The Victims of This Tragedy
I donated blood today for the Las Vegas victims.
This is a serious topic here in the comments section__-- don't laugh and don't comment bad if this happens with your family then you understand ....but i hope it do not happen for your better... Life...
You guys have to ban gun.
Great cause but blame your currier government, from across the water facts don’t add up, for sure people died but not by a long shooter, this was planned by the lefties groups  in America
Can you run tho
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
Light-loafers
Hoax
Wow! \n\n2k dislikes
thanks from Vegas <3
so unreal..
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
What a meme
Go Casey!!!
for the first time I feel bad for watching youtube with adblock
You could do that or.... fight against the guns market!! The US government is responsible for it!
Very good idea Casey. People will need counselling, therapy, funeral cost to be paid for and not having to think of working if your family or yourself is going through this is good if you can help. Let's all put a little and it will mount up.
Way to be Casey, way to be.
Thank you for saying mass murderer and terrorist. That's what it was terror. Saying adjectives only gives ways for excuses to NOT say terror....
Nevada.... A not ah! Nu! va! duh!\n\nThat is all.\nP.S. \nCasey, you are an amazing person and i love everything you do brother, God bless.
Pray for Las Vegas. :( and big THANK YOU for Casey Neistat
I’m not even a subscriber Casey but I love and respect what your doing. From UK. 🙏🏻
Genetic fewer recent rent few individual sometimes monument repeatedly threat
Rest In Paradise Mom 😔😢🙏🏻
oh damn glasses off.
Money can't help grief, but can help the further struggles!
How was he a terrorist? Do you know the definition of a terrorist?
Watch both ads all the way through :)
Well said Casey. It was truly heartbreaking seeing this in the news. Nice to see there are still people in this world that care. Good will always prevail evil.
Thanks usa for the new memes
Amen thank you Casey this is amazing of you
IM GONNA WATCH THIS VIDEO A MILLION TIMES OVER FOR THEM!!
What I do is keep playing this video and makeing sure it has ads to generate some money to casey so he can give it to the people in Las Vegas
Keep up the good work brother! You are a great person.
What is wrong with people? How screwed up can you be to write hate comments on this video or any compassionate and helpful video out there? \nWHY isn’t YouTube cleansing accounts of people who write hateful comments?
Money will always exist, and even after it leaves the trusting hands of Casey, we can never assure it goes where we need, even if it does help, it won't help properly. What do we need? Change. Political and mental.
Great Video Bro!
Casey you're such a wonderful person!!! Can we be friends? We can double date, me, you, my boyfriend, and Candace. I too don't understand how someone can be so evil and I also hate how the media sensationalizes this shit and tells everyone This is the biggest mass murder in US history because then another psycho will want to make that number larger and it's sickening. They should just say 'it's a mass shooting' such bullshit! But on another note 📝, I commend you for doing things for the family AND cutting out the middle man because you never know if that money will go directly to the families!!! ❤️❤️❤️
puerto rico needs actual help.
Thank you.
You r so kind and selfless 😃💙

Earth's FLAT sheeparmy
It was a government set up do not support this
But GoFundMe takes an 8% cut.
oh look he's piping up again to cling to relevance.
Why don't you donate your money instead of asking those with much lower incomes to donate.
Stay tuned for this name will become famous YouTube\nDo not hesitate to subscribe to the channel
Giving money to the victims families is really just treating the symptoms rather than doing something about the disease. Honestly you would be much better off using you platform and any money you have to shame politicians who have been bought by the NRA who keep defeating attempts to implement any form of gun control. These politicians keep saying that now isn't the time to talk about gun control and we should just pray for the victims but they will never do anything about gun control no matter how many people die and they are also preventing any form of investigation into gun violence. It's up to the people to stand up to these politicians and say that's not good enough.
Help! anyway i can pay with paypal. I'm only 15 and i don't have a card with a CVV, just the numbers and date. Are there any other places that i can donate to, which will go straight to the families in need?? Much love from Australia. Thanks.
you are right, money can perhaps help only a little! You in the United States should work on stronger weapon laws, so that such sick attacks could never ever happen again!  Angela from Germany
I think money for those victims is not the right thing to do. It think those hurricanes victims would need it more!
To help more dogs like Lena find their forever home, you can support the Takis Shelter: http://thedo.do/takis.
Precious baby just wanted love!
Awwww this made me cry lol happy tears! Lol great job! She is literally smiling 😀
Just so people know, you can make super cheap liposomal vitamin C from recipes online. This type of vitamin C is great for daily health or rescuing dogs like this one that were starved. It helps provide nutrients that they need and get them back to health.
She is such a beautiful and interesting looking dog. 🙂✌️
I feel like the person who left her their couldve been a homeless person that either left without her because they couldnt take care of her, was arrested maybe and never was able to come back or might have left one day and maybe died, leaving her orphaned. Those are the most likely choices seeing that there was a bed next to her and some supplies.
If we rescue these precious animals they will return that love😍 She is sooo beautiful
Avoid chickens also (KFC)...etc.\nSave all animals ! Both are equal to human 👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👏👏👏👏
This channel always lets me know that there is help for humanity. God bless
She looks like some idiot cut her ears half off with scissors. I'd be snapping at people too.
The righteous one cares for the soul of his domestic animal but even the mercy of the wicked is cruel proverbs 12 10
you are awesome that video made my day  God bless you
What a beautiful dog... whoever did that to her should have the same done to them!
Oh thank God! Thank you all for saving this poor sweet INNOCENT darling. It is NEVER the animals fault. WE are supposed to care for them-not just eat and abuse them. I am having trouble seeing my phone. Some crap in my damned eyes..thankyou Dodo.🐾😇😘😘
That's what I like yes gain more weight!
I want that dog. She's beautiful
Awesome job! Thank you so much for taking care of that dog and restoring her confidence and giving her a life. Much respect to you.
What kind of sick mofo would leave a dog and abandon it
A beautiful video thank you for your trust and kindness to that dog .
She was just hangry.  Beautiful girl.
I'd like to treat them Bastards like the way they neglected that dog. What a great job the shelter did.
Thanks Godsss she met you.. Thank you very much to save her from the dead .. god bless you forever..!
Thank GOSH there are people like this to rival animal abusers and puppy mill owners.
NICE
its suprosing that this man is greek im greek and most ppl in my country are so ignorant
THANK U SOOOO MUCH FOR SAVING HER U ARE A HERO XXXX
I am so glad there's still people that helps these poor babies thank you rescues.for helping them God bless you
I hope the people who abused this poor creature ....are never allowed too own an animal again ...she looked sooo happy in the end ...God bless the rescuers xxx♡♡♡
Fantastic video, i am so pleased that she pulled through, i am really happy for her. No dog should have to go through that, but it happens all the time. Owners who buy dogs and abanden them like this should be fuckin shot, it annoys me so much. I am just glad that she made it alright thanks to the guy who took her in.
So i give her some whey protein to gain more muscle..
These transformings are amazing to watch!😍
For this dog to recover and even become social and loving is a testament to the good found in ALL dogs. Great job Takis Shelter folks!
You are a good man , God bless you with eternal life.
Wow, I wonder if that dog was fiercely protective of her rescuer.
Its so sad to see animals like that 😭
God bless him for not turning his back on her like whoever did this! This world is a better place because of rescuers and people who try to right the wrong done to so many animals! Thank you for what you do and who you are. Seriously.
i love this channel and his lovely stories so much.
IF SHE GOES TO BITE THE HELPER SHE BITE AGING.
😪 bless this kind soul helping her
Poor baby! So glad he saved her... an amazing transformation x) 🐾💚
Great vid. Kudos to the rescuers!!! One thing I would suggest is to allow dog to smell your hand and if possible start petting under the chin vs. On top of the head. The hand over head bit can actually be quiet stressful because they dont know where your hand is going. When its under their chin it shows them what your doing...less stressfull for dogs.
God bless the  man who saved her !And rot in hell the scumbags who left her  in that  condition!
she was smiling for the camera at the end of the vid. awesome! so glad for her
it's surprising even this video got dislikes. Cant understand such people's mind.
I wish my country have animal recue or shelter. Even if I volunteer to rescue stray dog/cat people wouldn't care and I bet my kidney they wouldn't want to adopt one
Treated well a dog will be faithful forever.      Semper Fidelis
Im in depression... I needed to throw some kittens because of my dad and i think one of my class mates saw me😞 help me please
You, sir! Had my big respect!!
Brought tears to me eyes! 😢
Damn, thank you for existing
We need more people like this man in the world.
I love these kind of videos...don't stop posting them
Animals have souls and feelings too. I hate how humans think were godly enough to just even take an animals life no problem... #vegan is more than just a lifestyle, it was meant for us.
Persons like this guy can make this world a better place.
Bless you, Earth Angel for showing the poor little soul how to love and be loved ❤
But the madafaka can shalala anybody when it's down tho.
u got my respect man,1 like 4 u
I love when a good girl gets the love she deserves.
This man deserve subscribe wake up and give him subscribe am the first
She is so beautiful. ♥
Such a beautiful bebe\n\nAnimal abuse is going over the top and way worse then it was before I was not caring when I was a bit younger then I am now but now I understand that animals need to be treated like us we need to stand up to the abusers and save the animals \n\n\n\n\nI kinda useI alot sorri
Some humans need to be starved to death. Poor little thing I’m glad she’s doing better. Bless your heart
Breaks my heart too see animals abused, glues it back together when kind and loving people come to rescue them. God loves you and the creatures entrusted to us.👍
This here made my day
AWESOMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE,SO SAD TO SEE THE DOG IN THAT STATE BUT AWESOME TO SEE THE AFTER

The taste of freedom! God bless America! The land of the free!
Being from Australia I had a very different place in mind for Red Rooster.
They remind me of Nev & Max 😁 same happy couple/bromance. They're all awesome
Don’t curse for every idle word man speak they shall give account of it on judgement day
When they said Red Rooster, I was thinking the Australian Red Rooster... that isn't even fried!! You Aussies know what I'm talking about!
Gordon Ramsay should go to the last restaurant and give them a review

Can someone tell me the name of the song starts at 10:32 ?

Someone\n  Should make a comment telling all the times in where they actually eat the food. Someone please do it
I wouldn't even spend $17 on chicken XD
in australia (or where i live ) red roaster is a fast food place
Haha I'm watching this while eating chicken
I'm from Australia and when old mate said they were heading to Red Rooster for a moderate quality fried chicken meal. I was sooooooooo confused!? Anyone else from Australia and thought the same? Hahaha XD

They should come to Kansas City and do a segment on Barbeque
Kinda sad they're in New York and didn't try Kennedy's.
straya's red rooster is better
Sylvias the the history of Harlem. Marcus Samuelsson is a celebrity chef who came with the gentrification of Harlem. David Chang is a walking multi-million dollar corporation tricking the 1% into paying car payments for dressed up street food.
No fried chicken should ever cost more than 20$.
Food Network fans all FREAKED out when Marcus came up
This show is the only reason why I even bother with buzzfeed. Besides this they’re nothing but propaganda for the alt left
PLZ DO $1 RUBIKS CUBE VS $45 RUBIKS\nLIKE SO BUZZ FEED CAN SEE

Im super glad this was their next music video 😍
I could not love this more...Please adopt me Haim!!!!!! 😍
I REALLY LIKE THIS VIDEO OH MY GOD i love the way it was shot and edited and i will never believe they weren't actually having fun bc they're so happy!
haim is the new hanson
Sou uma típica fanática. Não posso resistir, sociedade... simplesmente não posso... 😍
Gostei!
Real vocals, real music.
ahhhhh eargasm 👏👏👏✨
SO UPLIFTING! love these girls.
Adorable
this song is so catchy especially while watching the video, makes you wanna get up and dance 💗
It says something when I hit the like button before the video even started to play.
They are sooo sexy, and so much fun! Love Haim!
Paul Thomas Anderson needs to make a full musical feature! I need to see it!
THANK YOU! THIS IS TRULY WONDERFUL.
They blew up within months... I'm happy but sad.
I love you 3 so much this is such a cute video!!!!
Would you guys be so kind and give me dance lessons? :D
every video of theirs lately is KILLING THE GAMEEE
Always be my Queens <3 Love from Vietnam
I don't remember this scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie
110% sure i had that hang ten striped top in middle school.  I wore it with my unionbay cords.
Wowwwwwww. This is what Ive been looking for in music these days.
This is like a modern day Wilson Phillips
Those girls are my favorites of all singers
Who else is in love with Danielle’s sassy ass walk though??😍😍😍 easily the best song on the album next to Ready for You and Walking Away
This video looks like it was so much fun to film.. xx
Easy, peasy, nice and breezy. Much needed right now. Thanks. 🤞🏼
Is that the bar the song Lazy Eye is filmed in for it's video..?
I wish I were one of the extras (background dancers) 🔥❤️
dance party at HAIM's place
...the way they stop on a dime- is always so cool !!!!
Very nice and heart warming - listen to the guitar rifts in the back ground as well - it doesn't need my approval - a good feeling - thanks cec
Leave it to Paul Thomas Anderson to make Alana look ADORABLE.
I thought it was a church song
They look like they’re having genuine fun. I love this video!
Like I LOVE YOU HAIM😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶🎶🎧🎧🎧🎤🎤🎤
THIS WAS SO BLOODY AMAZING WOW
so underrated.its so sad they deserve so much more
Greatest dancing video since Shiny Happy People from R.E.M. :)
Who has listened to this more than once?
the queens of walking down the streets!!!!
This video is so good, music too!
Paul Thomas Anderson and Haim, what else can I ask for???
After watching this video I tucked my shirt into my jeans & it’s become my style now lol
is there a behind the scenes video???
Plz do something about this video 😂
The definition of good vibes
These girls are amazing, make me feel 80's back again! Maravilhosas!
HAIM - Little of Your Love
this is so pure
I love Danielle as much as the camera does.
It's absurd to think people would actually dance to his in a clubby way.
Melhor vídeo ever
They need a video for You Never Knew. I can just imagine it- 80's style video, Danielle driving a car while the other two are in the back, escaping from a murder scene. That would be amazing.
Great video (again) and the album is a real grower, my 20 month old daughter always smiles when I play it.
LOVE
BYYEEE
Perfection.
Danielle, your body looks awesome here 💗
Haim ❤
_new favorite thing!_
I love this
They look effortless❤but classy💖. The HAIMs 👍at it again bravo👏. #sisterlysongs

Thank you all for the terrific suggestions! gonna polish off that library card and get on the learnin' train, destination: WONDER AND EXCITEMENT, CHOO CHOO
Mrs. Harkness went to China to bring back a panda because her husband was killed while pursuing one. she wanted to finish his goal for him. it's a love story.
Still Life, Melissa Milgrom. It's about the history of taxidermy and taxidermy competitions in America. She went to the World Championships too!
My boyfriend and I want to get his 4 year old niece into science. We are into science and we want to share our love for it with her.  What books would you recommend? She is into animals like any 4 year old.
I love deaths acre, it's about/ by bill Bates and the development of the field of forensic anthropology
Hey Emily! You should check out Parasite Rex by Carl Zimmer!
Have you read Miss Leavitt's Stars: The Untold Story of the Woman Who Discovered How to Measure the Universe?
I *loved* Smoke Gets In Your Eyes!  I just got From Here to Eternity :3
I've missed you, emily.
I'm sure you've already read The Sixth Extinction... it may have been in your last video in fact, lol. But I recommend that to everyone. \n\nI have to thank you for this from the perspective of an English teacher. My students were just asking how anyone could enjoy nonfiction books and I told them they just hadn't found the right one. I have plans to show them this video and get them more excited about nonfiction. And I think I'm going to have them pick one from your list for me to read, too! (I hope for the poison one or the ask a mortician one, her channel is great!) Thank you for promoting reading!
My last book was The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women by Kate Moore.  While not heavy in the science area it talks about the radiation exposure the girls endured while painting the luminous dials on instruments.  Their treatment will make you upset at the establishment.   Another great book which is heavy in science is The Gene: An Intimate History by  Siddhartha Mukherjee.  A great read for the history of inheritance from the beginnings to the future.   Both are great reads.
That was an awesome episode. Great recommendations, your enthusiasm is contagious! I read Lab Girl last Christmas, I really appreciated the insight into the life of a researcher.
I loved Smoke Gets In Your Eyes! I'm reading her new book From Here to Eternity and it's fantastic. Her death positive work has really changed how I view the logistics of death.
Since we're all recommending books here, I would like to add Blood and Guts: the history of surgery. It's so, so good, so interesting and it makes me SO happy that I live today with all this technology in medicine.
The two books i recommend are The best that money can't buy- Jacque Fresco and The new human rights movement - Peter Joseph
I would have loved to have worked in something to do with evolution 😩
Yes! I love Caitlin Doughty! Everyone should check out Ask A Mortician on YouTube!
I recommend Osa and Martin: For The Love Of Adventure by Kelly Enright. It's a peek into the lives and works of a couple whose adventures (mostly Africa and the South Pacific) influenced how people thought about the world through their pictures, films, and lectures. I liked it because their decision to change from hunting to photography helped influence global conservation efforts, and getting a glimpse into their lives was a fun and educational experience. Hope you enjoy if you decide to check it out!
The Invention of Nature by Andrea Wulf is a must read!!!
I've had Smoke Gets in Your Eyes on my to-buy list for ages now, and I had no idea the author had a YouTube channel! Thanks for that! :D
4:26 mike wazowski I’m in a Magazine!
I really love the way Sagan used to write about science
Lol the only books I read are comics why am I watch this
OMG YES YOU AND CAITLIN!!!!! That would be amazing!!!
Read Archie Carr's The Windward Road and So Excellent A Fishe!! The Windward Road is about his field studies as a herpetologist in the Caribbean in the 40s and 50s. So Excellent A Fishe is about early sea turtle research and conservation. They are both really entertaining and insightful. I really enjoyed reading about the first time they put a tracker on a turtle in the 60s and the struggles they had to deal with. They ended up tying a rope from the turtle to a float to which they tied a weather balloon with a radio transmitter. Turned out the transmitter had such short range that they could see the balloon before they could tap in on the transmitter.
I just bought poisoner's handbook : ) thanks for the recommendation.
emily you are just a joy to watch
Kingdom Under Glass by Jay Kirk. It's about Carl Akeley and the advancements he made in the field of taxidermy along with his safaris he did to collect specimens.
I enjoy all your videos kid, you never let me down! Keep up the good work! Oh, Dr. Bakker's book, Raptor Red was a real favorite of both my kids.
I would recommend The Man Who Touched His Own Heart by biologist Rob Dunn. It's about the history of medical science and the advances that heart sugary has made. I would also recommend Refuge by Terry Tempest Williams (I'm currently reading this one right now). It's about the rise of the Great Salt Lake and the effect it has on the environment and bird refuge that it overtakes, also the authors story of her mother's battle with cancer.
I refuse to believe Jamie James is the real name of an actual person.
OMG CAITLIN DOUGHTY!!!! I love that you recommended her book. I adore her. PLEASE DO A COLLAB!!!!
I think that you should read Lab Girl by Hope Jahren! It is a really good book about botany, mental health, and friendship. I cried.
I'm more of a history buff than a natural science kind of person if you're interested in books like that
I'd say 3 of my favorite non-fiction sciencey/natural world kind of books would be Beast in the Garden, No Way Home: The Decline of the World's Great Animal Migrations, and Tiger: A True Story of Vengeance and Survival
I hope I die an environmentally friendly death
VS Ramachandran's 'Phantoms in the brain' is amazing!!
You should read Neil Degrasse Tyson's new book Astrophysics for People in a Hurry....or his other book on Pluto becoming a dwarf star.
I think you would enjoy Your Inner FISH by Neil Shubin. It's probably already in the Field Museum bookshop and it will appeal to your interest in paleontology & biology and your inner geek! Enjoy the read and thank-you for the videos. Sharing and communicating the spirit of science is so important, so valuable and so rarely done this well.  Way to go !
I really enjoyed Lab Girl by Hope Jahren! Also 10/10 would support a Caitlin/Emily cross-over!!
YouTube literally just recommended ask a mortician to me a few days ago and I've been binge watching her videos every chance I get... So, yeah, a collaboration would be awesome.
Emily/Caitlin collaboration would make my life complete! LET'S TALK ABOUT DEAD STUFF!!
If you're ever in the mood for fiction I recommend A Natural History of Dragons by Marie Brennan. It's a great fantasy that reads like a Victorian memoir. It's soooo good!
Have you read Annihilation? It's pretty great in terms of weird sci-fi.
Ooo I love a good book review. If you make one in the future I'm looking for recommendations for reading about evolution that aren't a textbooks but are more in depth than say Richard Dawkins's stuff.
I would watch the heck out of a video with you and Catilin Doughty.
Book recommendations for you:\nGrandmother Fish, by Jonathan Tweet. Illustrated children's book introduces evolution to younger readers. \n\nPlanet of the Bugs, by Scott R. Shaw. Shaw covers the story of arthropods from their beginnings to today. It's clear from his writing that he admires his subjects very much. Fun, informative read. \n\nWasp Farm, by Howard E. Evans. Stories from Evans about a farm he owned and the various species of wasps who inhabited the farm. Evans really admires wasps and makes the reader love them too. This is one I re-read every few years.\n\nAnd yes, yes, PLEASE do a Brainscoop-Doughty crossover.. I'm a fan of both of your channels.
Now I want to read that graphic book about dinosaurs!
I recommend A Primate's Memoir by Robert Sapolsky-- really good field biology focused nonfiction about baboons! Bring many tissues for the ending.
I love A Sting in the Tale by David Goulson, it's all about bees! He also wrote A Buzz in the Meadow which is amazing if you want to learn about bees AND bugs. If you wanna get into some fiction, Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer has some pretty wicked biology in it!
I love this channel! The only one I've read is The Snake Charmer and it was fantastic. If you haven't read it, Dinosaurs in the Attic by Douglas Preston (about the American Museum of Natural History in New York) is wonderfully written and very interesting!
Now i want to read the murder mystery book! Also this vid is so insightful in areas I usually don't encounter on youtube, so I like it a lot!
ahaha, here have these books they made me cry!
Sorry,   more recommendations because I love science writing. The Earth Remade by Oliver Morton is a good overview of geoengineering schemes to combat global warming. The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert has already been mentioned, but if anyone wants a older but longer read on the same topic, I recommend David Quammen's Song of the Dodo. The Ends of the World by Peter Brannen, about mass extinction, is another to read book on my list, but I've heard good things and was impressed by the author during one of his presentations. And as for another non-fiction dinosaur comic, Science Comics' Dinosaurs: Fossils and Feathers is another good choice that focuses more on the history of paleontology (although I did find a couple errors in the book.)
So good to have another set of book recommendations- I treated myself to a fair few from your last list. I've already got 'Smoke gets in your eyes' and I agree a collab with Caitlin would be awesome. Would recommend the Morbid Anatomy Anthology for more weirdness and 'GoatMan' by Thomas Thwaites, subtitled 'how I took a holiday from being human'. Science, biology, humour and great photos.
Mites live in your face\nNo wonder people have acne.
I had to read Monster of God by David Quammen for a class and I was very surprised about how much I enjoyed it. It's about the relationship between humans and predator animals. It talks about how different cultures view the relationship and how it affects humanity as a whole. A very interesting read- I highly recommend!
A book I plan on reading that I'm sure you will like is Dr. Lee Dugatkin's new book How to Tame a Fox (and Build a Dog) . Coincidently, I heard about this book on the podcast Talk Nerdy and the very next episode is with Caitlin Doughty, whose channel I just discovered and now I'm seeing everywhere.  The internet is a small world.
I'm currently reading Into the Jungle: Great Adventures in the Search for Evolution by Sean B. Carroll. Pretty good so far!
I am reading Blood, Sweat and Pixels ! It's a great narration over the life cycle of game development and of game developers.
Plague On Us by Geddes Smith\nThe Power Of The Charlatan by Grete de Francesco \nHunger and History by E. Parmalee Prentice
I would love to see you get together with Caitlin for a collaboration video!
Are you related to the guy who chugs wine and goes on rants?
Smoke Gets in your eyes is awesome.... I just got her new book : from here to eternity... look it up, it just got published :)
I don't know how I feel about this surprise ending.  I typically segregate my mash potatoes and corn.   I will allow it, only on a trial basis!
If you like Smoke Gets in your eyes, I really suggest her new book that just came out From Here to Eternity: Traveling the World to Find the Good Death.
Oh my god. The idea of you and Caitlin making a collaboration sounds so so SO COOL😍! *crosses fingers*
Smoke Gets in Your Eyes is fantastic! Did you know that Caitlin Doughty's second book, From Here to Eternity, just came out? \nAlso some easy to read nonfiction I've loved recently are three books by Dave Goulson, a bumblebee researcher. The books are A Sting in the Tale, A Buzz in the Meadow, and Bee Quest.(incidentally, he also has a youtube channel)
Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History by Jay Burreson combines chemistry and it's historical and anthropological significance and it's amazing!
You may not be in a lot of books but you are in many many people's hearts. Thank you for the great book recommendations and for being a proponent for science exploration.
Does anyone have any suggestions for books about either dinosaurs or paleontology in general??
I'd recommend Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, but not his second book, homo deus. The second book is just a bunch of hot air.
I want to recommend The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert for anyone wanting to read more non-fiction but is intimidated by how dry it can get sometimes. I thought this book was so well-paced and fascinating and funny that I didn't have any trouble getting through it. It was insightful and I learned a lot from it!
YES FINALLY! I already read all the ones you last recommended so I've been waiting for this for months!
Kingdom Under Glass by Jay Kirk is a biography of Carl Akeley. It's written novelistically and it gives Akeley's wife, Mickey the credit that she deserves.
you've probably read all of her books, but i loooove mary roach! especially her book packing for mars
I place my vote for the brain scoop and ask a mortician to make a colaboration. That would be amazing!
soz Em, I have enough rr for uni already 😂
Emily, read Ghost Map by Steven Johnson! It's a nonfiction look at a London cholera epidemic in the 1800s and a scientist trying to prove it came from contaminated water and not the popular miasma theory. I learned so much cool and gross stuff!
Yeah, I'd love a Brainscoop/Ask A Mortician collaboration.
Always on the look out for good non-fiction, and Poisoner's Handbook is now on my wish list! I recently read The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kohlberg, and it was so eye opening! I recommend it to everyone hoping to understand a little more the impact of humanity on the rest of the animals on our complex Earth. Also just read Concussion by Jeanne Marie Laskas, and wow, now I have to read Dr Omalu's book.  Please keep doing the book recommendations!
Fairly sure you have already read this but in case you have not:\n\nThe World Without Us\nby Alan Weisman
The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben really helped me think differently about every tree around me, and was a quick, happy read.
I just got my copy of Smoke Gets in Your Eyes today! How funny
Emily's seemingly never-ending collection of animal jewelery must itself almost be worthy of inclusion in the Field Museum.\nThe count for todays video is, I believe, 4:\nMain segment:\n• Ring - curled Pangolin (?)\n• Brooch Chain - Flying wasps/beetles (?)\n• Earrings - Dragonfly wings\nCutaway flashback to interview with Lance Grande\n• Earrings - Flys\n\nAlways some little detail to notice.
I would have to recommend:\nPlundered Skulls and Stolen Spirits: Inside the Fight to Reclaim Native America's Culture by Chip Colwell &\nBone Rooms: From Scientific Racism to Human Prehistory in Museums by Samuel J. Redman
I'd recommend Spillover! (By David Quammen). It's about all the different zoonotic diseases. It's sooooo good it's like a detective story trying to find out where they come from. If you're not keen on reading the whole thing (not that it's very long) he released an updated excerpt on Ebola after the 2014 episode which is also AMAZING. A couple of my non-science friends read the excerpt and loved it!
Recommendation: What's Eating You - People and Parasites by Eugene H. Kaplan. It is an amazing book about field work in parasitology, I loved it though I didn't cry at the end (maybe once or twice from laughter). \n\nI am SO glad you featured Caitlin's book - I have followed both of your channels for ages now, and I think a colab video would be amazing!
Mary Roach!
Nice list
Buck. BUCK all those societal norms...
first vsauce michael tweeting about caitlins book...... now emily 🙏
talk show
Emily... do you have a Goodreads?
When you say younger, exactly how young? I have a 13 year old nephew that’s interested in science. Specifically geology and paleontology.
For some weird reason YouTube hasn't notified me of an Emily video in at least six months. Then this one popped up. I'll have to go back to see what I missed.
The mites that live in your face... Excuse me while I freak out for a minute before researching this more heavily than the research paper I have due in the morning.
Tell us where you get your skulls! That's what I really want to know!
what is the poster behind you add to the left? (the verticle black & white one). thanks!
Thank You, Emily! Sorry, as a fellow female wearer of shirts, wanted to know what is that cute chained thing on your shirt?
Your eye makeup in the beginning is stunning!
It's hard to put my finger on where the line is, but with my closest friends I've just felt it's been ok if the information is useful/helpful etc. Like as a recent university grad it's been helpful as we look for and gauge wages for some of our first full time jobs, it been good to gauge what the normal limits are and discuss budgeting, etc. Still a tough topic, but when you understand why it's being discussed and feel the information won't be taken out of context, I can do it.
Just paused to say that even if you were breast feeding, the bottles are a good way for Liam to be involved with feeding too x You do you Louise and don't listen to the few negative people that don't understand your needs. Every parent has their own way and as long as you care and love your child, you are doing the best job in the world x
Did I hear you refer to one of the kittens as a ‘she’ when Jim was holding it?I thought they were both boys? This happened to me when I bought my kitten. The breeder was certain she was a boy so I called her ‘Alfie’. Took her to her first vets appointment and the vets were like ‘no, she’s definitely a little girl’. Quick name change to ‘Missy’ and she’s now a lovely twelve year old cat. 😊
I love Esther!! I wanna be her friend too!!
Yes please with the fanny prep video!
the puzzle development in this was so accurate! everyone starts out loving puzzles but then by about an hour in they want to throw it across the room but at the same time you cant give up haha!\nI am going to need a puzzle update next week!!! xxx <3
does someone else hear music in the background during the haul? just checking that i'm not going crazy
Loved the vlog as always and loved all of your outfits this week Louise, were is the coat with the fur trim that you are wearing at the end from ? thanks xxx
oh lord, i bloody love you, Louise. You rock. Please be you always, ta. X
Your not awful for making a decision for you and your baby. Out of curiosity would like to know what you would prefer if you can choose this time?
I think it is vital for people to be open about how much they earn. As an upcoming uni grad I am looking at careers and, although it's not the only factor I consider, a huge factor of my decision making will be based on salary. If I don't know the money that is available from a career path then how do I know if that is something I will want to pursue to suit my lifestyle choices. I hope that makes sense and doesn't come off like I'm only thinking about making money!
I personally freely talk about how much I earn but that's just my personal preference. I am highly interested in how people that have jobs on social media and such do earn money like how it all works, but it's just everyone's personal preference on whether they disclose how much they earn. ❤
Aw man I went to ikea MK last Wednesday night, a day too late
There’s an amazing tapas in Northampton can’t remember the name but it’s in the market square x
You know what, I could really do with a homely Zoe and Louise vlog! Running errands and chilling in the house, love that kinda thing!
Oh man....in America you are given those bottles for going to the bathroom after delivery while you're at the hospital! I am SO glad you read about it because they're really nice to have on hand! haha
where are the antlers from? so cute :)
I STARTED A PUZZLE CLUB TOO!! but we only did puzzles about two times before it evolved into just drinks, YouTube and maybe a board game. I do my puzzles on my own now 😆
Hey Louise! I had the same issue when I had my daughter. Lost lots of blood during delivery and could never make milk properly. My daughter kept losing weight and I kept getting deeper in post partum depression, and my pediatrician told me that it was time to feed my baby. He said that FED is best. I can't believe it took me 10 days to decide to feed my child, but the pressure to breast feed is VERY REAL! I felt like a failure, but I know now that feeding my baby was the best decision. \n\nHugs! Dana
I feel like if someone wants to disclose how much they earn, that’s cool. And if they don’t want to disclose it, that’s also cool. I do however think it’s rude to ask. I just think it’s a very personal thing to just come out and ask someone, because it’s actually nobody’s business? If I’m having a conversation with someone and it comes up, then I’ll discuss it if I’m comfortable, but I don’t think people should just ask.
Feed is Best! As long as your baby is feed, it doesn't matter the method.
In regard to the bottle feeding, as the lovely Gi Fletcher would say, 'Happy mum, happy baby' you do whatever's best for you and baby, if you're distressed and upset with say breastfeeding, then it won't do baby any good. Your little girl will turn out great whether you breastfeed her or not because you're a fantastic mama! Good luck with the rest of the pregnancy and the delivery Louise, and your recovery, I hope all goes smoothly xxx
Hey guys, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now and I'm really trying to reach 200 subs, I would really appreciate it if you subbed ❤️
No one needs to know how much you earn. You work hard for it that's all what matters.
Louise breastfeeding is very personal and I hate that you had to justify yourself and brace yourself for the comments. No one is going to understand understand what you will be going through nor your choices. No explanation needed.
As you were talking about winners never quit as you hated the puzzle,  Can't Stop This Thing We've Started by Bryan Adams was playing in the background. He knew. Bryan always knows.
Hi only just got round to watching your weekly, me and my little baba are bk from the hospital where I've been reading your book (which o love btw) and I'm now chilling home and got my baby who's adorable, now I'm just so excited to see your lil one !!love watching what people are getting for their babies
I work in the public sector so google would happily tell you what I earn. Personally I'm all for talking about earnings if not only to inspire the next generation to aim higher but also to create an open culture. I worked for a company that once banned us from talking about earnings until someone let out they earned nearly 4k more than someone else doing the same job!
lovely weekly vlog as always 💜 on the subject of money/earnings, I think that the interest around Youtubers making money and how much has become such a largely speculated thing purely because nobody knows the exact answer. Personally I am not bothered whether or not I ever find out how much that may be, but I will say that I am quite curious about what the roundabout figure is. I'm a naturally nosey person but would never EXPECT this information from anyone
It is good to talk about what you earn in an informative way! xx
I think its interesting with the whole money thing, I personally (and please don't take offence to this) think its a privilege to be able to keep your earnings private. As someone who as worked in the NHS and is now studying to continue my career in the NHS my salary is completely public knowledge, I get why because the taxpayer pays my wage but I don't get the option to be private about what I earn you just need to google it. I think that discussion is the best way to grow, particularly in business, woman tend to be paid a lot less in comparison to their male counterparts for the EXACT same job but often people don't know because we don't discuss it. One of the only industries with no gender pay gap is the NHS(yes there are plenty of problems with NHS pay but this isn't one of them) I personally think part of this is to do with the complete transparency in regards to salary. You are totally within your rights to keep your earnings private and I agree that asking your salary on national TV is totally rude and not ok but general discussion and transparency on money I think is important in equality and in terms of understanding industry.
Don't feel guilty about bottle feeding!!!!  Do you!
It is rude to ask people how much you earn , there’s only 4 people who know how much I earn and they are my mom , dad , my employer and myself!
Such a shame that it is difficult for you to say that you might not breastfeed... Even if you just made the decision not to youre the mum so you know best... always... its a shame as well that it is also other women putting down other women! also s lot of the goodness you produce is in the first 3 days so even if you managed that it would be amazing :) i really hope you manage to do whatever is right for you!
Louise, your words about breast/bottle made me think of this - https://fedisbest.org/
The Little Book of Calm from Black Books
Love Asda/George for bedding. Always have the greatest designs. Going to copy and order my new Xmas ones this week. Would love Halloween bedding but cant find any good ones in the Uk..
As a student, I find it really interesting and helpful to know how other students make money and spend/safe it. It is a topic i frequently talk about with friends/fellow students. I do not see that as rude but as very helpful.
In France there is that same silence around what you earn, but I still don't understand it! Our income is a part of our life, as it allows us to do/buy a certain amount and quality of products and activities. I we were less cringed about the idea of talking money, I think the world would be a better place. For example, in a group of friends, the ones with more money would pay more than the ones with less money in any activity! I think it would encourage people to be generous or/and ask for help ☺️
I think a persons salary is private xx
It’s a good day when you get excited over seeing a guy you don’t even know just cause of how much hype Louise has made over him 😍😍 am I the only one? Yeah probably idc 😂😂
Love your eye makeup with that hair!! So beautiful 😍
Please make a fanny prep video soon!😅 Expecting my first baby and need some tips before due date in 6weeks😝
if people are interested for the good reasons (about the  money)  I think it would be interesting to know how do you earn money 😉 not how much, I do think it's impolite
I'd say if you know someone quite well or maybe looking to apply for what job they have, asking what salary someone has is fine but i wouldnt just go around and ask anyone that does feel rude to me. Do a smaller puzzle maybe like 500 piece wouldnt be as much of a challenge😂 I've done a 1000 piece disney princess one a while ago and it was actual hell!
Don't put pressure on yourself to breastfeed, your true subscribers and people within your life will understand whatever you choose to do. It's a personal choice, I have zero intention to breastfeed even though in theory I will be completely capable of doing so.\n\nAlso looking forward to the fanny prep video! \n❤️
I still think it's rude to ask how much money someone makes but there is often a massive divide between viewers and creators which is were the interest comes in, if you're working long hours nearly everyday and come home to watch youtube and see them receiving free gifts and affording the lifestyle some do, it can be frustrating as youtube is perceived to be an 'easy' job, i don't think it is an easy job but some creators/influencers are doing incredibly well compared to say nurses or teachers.
Eating fish and chips and watching Mulan sounds like the perfect night to me!
I wasn’t breath fed and as far as I can tell the only thing that could be criticised about me is I’m socially awkward but I can’t blame my mothers tit for that
your videos always make me feel better, so thank you <3
Whilst breastfeeding is probably preferable, it’s great to be realistic. It’s not for everyone, and it’s great to be prepared for you and babe! Love your vlogs Louise (and the hair is awesome!)
I love your hair colour! 🦄😊💚💛💜💙
I don't see a link to Sarah's book
I have 2 sphynx cats and really get fed up of people saying they are ugly!! They are different for sure but not everyone is the same and i love all cats! Mine are just different!
I'm learning so much about childbirth and motherhood and I'm a 22 year old postgrad student 😂
I agree I think it's incredibly rude to talk about how much you earn. It is no one else's business what you earn. I think because we see youtubers living a very comfortable and sometimes luxury lifestyle people are interested to know how much you make because it seems more attainable than a traditional celebrity and also because it's curiosity isn't it, we have no idea, not even a rough idea, where as most professions you have a rough idea of the salary. But I'm on your side, i wouldn't tell anyone how much money I earn and I'd be offended if anyone felt they had the right to ask x
I bought LOADS of waterwipes. My baby (6weeks old tomorrow) bloody hates them they are sooooo cold. Just a heads up... aldi wipes and nappies are amazing! I started on pampers and waterwipes but didn't like either xx
Why did you do the puzzle like that!? Sort through all the pieces and separate the edges first!
Nobody should be forced to reveal their income but I think it would be helpful if overall as a society we were more comfortable sharing that information. At least to the people we work with or around us. Not talking about it can create shame around money (earning a lot or not earning much) and that's not helpful to anyone. Also, sharing the information can help close the gender pay gap. Obviously people have a LOT of hang ups about money and so I understand why people don't like to share. I've found it helpful to be open about it with friends, reduces any awkwardness when people know where you're at and it's easier to ask for/offer help or say when you can't afford something or you'd rather not spend money on something.
When I had my first, I was told to give my daughter a bottle at 4 weeks so that she will take a bottle. I did and I completely breastfeed her, but she takes a bottle for when I am out and it is so freeing! As far as the debate, as long as baby is fed its just fine! Breast or formula fed is best! I think it is very wise of you to be prepared!
Does anyone else automatically think of Black Books when they see The Little Book of Calm?
Missed what happened\nTo the old house cats? Xx
I think that it is slightly rude to talk about money, it is interesting to know how you and other youtubers earn money. But I don't think anybody should ask a person how much they earn, I found it awkward when my PE teacher asked me how much I earn because it is something personal to the person asked
I saw u n Marcus on tv the other day when Richard Madeley asked if you were rich … loved how u turned it back round on him. I find it so rude to ask someone about how much they earn but for some reason it seems to be ok to ask people who earn money online that question???
I'd be really interested to hear how to make money online. I am a teacher so what i earn is a matter of public record - i dont get the choice but it doesn't particularly bother me. If people earn more good for them, if they dont and theyre happy good for them! I dont find money a taboo topic, talking about it doesnt mean you are boasting as everyone appreciates you have worked hard and you frequently comment that you feel you are 'blessed' to do what you love and i feel the same - regardless of what i earn.
this is why i hate trending
I'm a teacher so my salary can be found easily online but I tell the students roughly how much I earn so they can find out how much different jobs salaries are. I think it is helpful to talk about even if it is uncomfortable to talk about sometimes.
Louise you’re amazing ❤️
The kittens 😭😍
You look so lovely Louise <3
Re Money questions - as a student I find that all my peers are happy to talk about how much they earn/their money situation (e.g. ‘ugh my job only pays £5.30 per hour’ or ‘yay my loan comes in tomorrow’ or ‘omg I only have 36p in my account’) but all the adults in my life would never talk about how much they earn, how much money they have saved up etc. I wonder when you make that transition...
Tmi this comment, but I found that tilting to one side on the toilet it didnt hurt to pee but it didnt hirt to get a bath for me either after i give birth and got stitches xxx
I just love the transition I've started a puzzle club, yayy - I hate puzzle club x))
I've been applying for jobs recently and a couple of them in their applications, asked how much i made in my last job. I  didn't particularly like being asked the question as it had nothing to do with the job.
Where was the mrs pots and chip cup from
Can we all please worship Louis's eyeliner it is on point the whole video 👌
I used to use a jug with cooled boiled water when going to the toilet after giving birth
THE LITTLE BOOK OF CALM! Black Books, anyone?
I think it's okay if people are just interested to know how they can make money on line. It's certainly not okay to ask other people how much money they make, or for people to brag about how much they  make😺😺😺😺. The brownies looked really nice. Love the snuggly kittens. Xxx
Giant sacks of cloth.. literally me pregnant or not 😂
Breast feed or bottle feed it's no ones damn business!  Your bub your choice 💕💖.  I thinks it's sooo rude to ask someone how much money they earn. In saying that, (UTUBER)Danielle Mansutti said( I think I have this right) that to work out approx how much utubers get paid per video, take the last two numbers off the views, ie if it's viewed 34650 times, they would get paid about 346 for the video. She also said it depends on the country, US utubers get paid heaps more than Australian ones. It's interesting, but I wouldn't ask or expect to be told.
Haha, my sister and I are starting our ‘Puzzle Club’ on Sunday. Thanks for the idea! ☺️
This may be a weird comment but Louise has perfect lips.
Lol I read unboxing calories

Louise you look gorgeous #Glowing

Jeez I could fit a sign saying do not enter in the humongous gap in your teeth😂😂😂
This is bs the top 5 trending vids have 1.2 million views at a minimum (except this one) yet this one at no 3 has 90k. This is getting ridiculous.
YouTube is a rather easy job I don’t wanna be rude but my mum is a single parent and she works her but off to keep up with everything and still try and keep me and my bro up to date with fashion and stuff and not many people can afford to buy all that from amazon . Ly tho xxxx
Whys this on trending? Piss off x
Small correction: The Saturn V rocket is obviously Saturn 5 as it's a roman numeral. Sorry about that.\nEnjoy the video!
i unsubed cuz you dont fact check or try to debunk anything
DO WE GET FREE INTERNET ON MARS
No one cleared this with me.. We'll see about all this.. How do you know I don't have something waiting for that ass once you chimps get there.. 👺
people looking for intro music song \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGB4lB9VVBI
Have you concerned a sonic Boom of the BFR delivering passengers around the world or that an apollo launch was just over 3g and the BFR will land at 10g I don't think most executives want they arse hole to fall out on landing and blackout it's crazy hype all around this guy it's will be a robocop type device next just sit back and look at the engineering before you jump onboard a hyperloop wreck you nearly hit it with the currency video then you retracted it not to be a target and just fell back in the trap of capatlism and it's lies.
Work more at it and faster. How about going too the Moon?
I always crack up when someone says 'BFR' esp in a serious tone.\n\nPS-I love Musk...what a great man.
Imagine your loved once being in mars far away from you in future. 😅
They've got booster landings down pat now, but I think it will take them multiple failures to master landing the upper stage (which will be a very different massing when returning empty, with cargo, and with passengers). With such a large and expensive vehicle, I wonder whether they'll be able to get it down before they run out of money.
When Elon Musk says something, i believe it.
I think they need a spinning circular disk to recreate earths gravity to help the heart pump blood and not allow blood to pool in the head. We should slowly release that over time and force inhabitants to adapt. We also need to bring bacteria from earth and help it survive in the soil of mars as we grow food there. It’s called the microbiome. There is a connection with gut bacteria and brain function as well as health. On top of that we need to deal with the high energy electromagnetic waves making everyone go blind as it passes through the optic nerve and permanently damages the nerves ability to transmit signals. There is the problem of DNA damage as well. If we can somehow get the metal inside the planet hot and spinning we may be able to create a magnetic barrier from the sun. We take earth for granted so much.
Can someone please tell me what the whole point of going to Mars, aside from the technological leap to pull it? There's nothing as seen on the images, you might as well go to Sahara, Himalayas or or Antarctica.
7:54 welcome to internet whos thinking its actually a pic taken from the surface of Mars 😂
Well I was going to thumbs up this video UNTIL I HEARD THE MUSIC AT THE BEGINNING OF IT
His idea of using BFR to go to the Moon and Mars is on point. But his idea of using it to cheaply transport people around the globe in less than an hour is quite absurd.
Reusable rockets is a stupid idea. Flying anywhere on earth in a rocket is a stupid idea. For someone that claims to want to help the environment he is now going to consume the earth in rocket fumes yeah brilliant idea Elon. Seems like every time he opens his mouth fan boys go running to jerk him off. What happened to the bullshit Hyper Loop. Here is the thing none of the ideas are his. These ideas have been around longer then him.
i bet all of us will die of old age and there will be no mars colony.elon  is just a rich scam artist
This is still the best channel ever! Keep up the good work.
Elon was like we fucked earth now let’s fuck mars
I think it would not be posibel in the next 150 years. Posibel rovers to build infrastructure in the next 20 years would be ambiguous.
What accent is that
Any plans to make video about Proterra electric buses? I heard lot about them now a days.
There's people dying from starvation and these MF are spending millions of dollars in finding new planet.
Instead , Just Launch A Bigger Satellite , SO I CAN GET A BETTER FUCKING INTERNET CONNECTION
2024 or 2040 doesn't matter. The matter is if we will go to mars or not.
Elon Musk is a salesman. His job is to sell Space X as a brand. In no way shape or form are we Humans landing a person on Mars.\n\nStop falling for this guy. The truth is he has no way of getting people there or Space X hasn't figured out all the challenges of surviving deep space. The martian atmosphere or even how you would get a person back.\n\nThis is just all idiotic.
Awosome!!! Not sure about 2024 but definately he will do it, im just excited that they will do it in our lifes span
i will lead the flat mars campaign .
It could be true if they had enough funding. If nasa or space x had like a 100 billion budget every year we could speed up the process by so much that we'd even start colonizing Mars by 2050 or earlier and maybe start traveling to other solar systems.
Whoopee do, Kim Jong Un and the DPRK have already commenced construction of the moon base and their Mars colonisation will commence 2019.
I think it would be better that we first save the beautiful planet we have. Great video by the way.
Can't believe how totally committed so many assholes are to attacking what is the most ambitious project ever undertaken\nIf they end up saying I told you so then we all lose
We are already there.
wonder if the timeframe will be kept as good as the estimated tesla model 3 units
We are gona make it unless the WWIII somehow breaks out eventually. Challenge and opportunity coexist for the mankind. God bless the people constrained in this spacetime.
You're on the British trending tab!!!\nCongrats!
alright. Next step MCRN and the epstein drive.
Elon for president on Mars!!!
We have to try and deal with the challenges as they surface.
I'm really saddened by the fact that he didn't say have a good one at the end of the video.
@6:54 what is this picture and the plant-looking objets?
I want to go in an electric rocket :D\nWell its not been developed yet... I think but launching a rocket with electro magnets or electricity... Might be a reality someday.. Just my thought
NASA should just be able to buy BFRs on a government contract from SpaceX with the license to be able to modify the rocket however they see fit. No need to waste time and money on two designs to get to Mars.
I want to go to mars just to get away from these leftards ruining society for everyone.
I'm curious to see what would happen to the human body when subjected to 1/3 of Earth's gravity for an extended period of time. I'm especially curious to see how children's bodies will develop if born on mars. \n\nExercise is good hygiene here on Earth. I imagine it may be necessary for survival on Mars. \n\nBut who knows, I could be entirely wrong. They may just develop to be a sustainably frail subspecies of humans. But humans adapted to Mars coming to Earth may be impossible for physiological reasons.
You sir who created this channel along with the people who works hard in making your videos, are AMAZING! I'm glad you existed.
I think Mars could be an excellent opportunity to research teraforming. In the process of trying to teraform mars, perhaps we could find a way to fix our planet?
Matt damon's movie ELYSIUM in the making....
THIS is how it NEEDS TO BE DONE :   Put robots on Mars first, so that the structures can be put into place before anyone arrives.  Sending people before any life-sustaining structures are build is just asking for trouble and death.
This is a good age to be alive. First human on other planet is something comparable to the invention of writing and of course more spectacular than that.If Musk manage to do that he will be remembered till the end of humanity.
It's possible, but musk creeps me out.
Hey Dagogo please cover the nobel prize winners :)
Does this mean there will be a call of duty marsian warfare?
If Earth  will turn in Fallout, people would happily to go to Mars to pursue better life. Oops, don't tell this to Elon Musk!!
Big Fucking Rocket BFR thats what it stands for
Elon's Musk.\n\nThe new fragrance.
Why was I not subbed yet!? I'm seriously pretty excited that I will be seeing us go to Mars in my life time, I'm only sixteen and not even nearly smart enough to now what all of this means but it's so interesting
Im so excited for all this!!\nJust curious, wont commercial use fuck the environment?
Sorry there will be wars at mars
And I need at least until 2026-2028  to finish my master of engineering 😭
Well elon musk is really dreaming big... Hoping it would have a happy ending...
Cgi is go to mars
Who wants to live on a shitty red planet with rocks ??
Elon Musk doesn't address the problems with zero gravity in transit, and reduced gravity for a prolonged period while on Mars, at all. Humans evolved on earth, we have very specific environmental demands, we are going to have to deal with those challenges if we want to settle permanently anywhere else.\n\nI would love to see a manned mission to Mars, but any kind of colonization, I think, is further into the future than we might like to admit.
I was waiting for him to tell us what BFR stands for. I really hope it's Big F*cking Rocket
After musk’s announcement my girlfriend asked me: so musk will be using rockets to compete with commercial airliners to make money to build rocket to go to mars ??? I replied Yes. She then asked me how about all those rocket emissions resulting from all those earth to earth trip ?? Isn’t musk all about sustainability and environment... I didn’t know what to say !!
lol people in Africa starving for water and food. here they talking about to go Mars
I love Elon Musk. With out a doupt the most important man on the planet. I'm so thankful we have him. He makes me proud of my species.
A $2 million cessna light aircraft **shows cessna 152 worth under $100K**\n\nI hope thats not what Musk meant
So many Musketeer fuckboy's about, my god the education system is fucked nobody can tell real life from the fantasy that spews out of Musk's stupid mouth.
BFR = Big Fucking Rocket. \n\nEver since doom all i see is big fucking in front of everything
I went there already, nothing there, only red sand
love ur channel
Musk ye dum dewg send me to marz brah
Dont trust a damn thing Elon Mush says.
way to ambitious
BFR = Big Frucking Rocket
cool from Chris Cybernet Applications
With Elon Musk anything is possible!
Why tho?
BFR stands for big fucking rocket its genius!
Earth is flat
Nice!
BFR = Big Fucking Rocket
Even if it were true. It would take decades for humans to build any real infrastructure there
It's so crazy how changing your name from coldfustion to coldfusion enabled you so many more subscribers. I remember when you had way under 100k subs and were thinking about stopping this youtube thing.\n\nSo happy you continued making videos!! (A little bit of SEO can go a long way ;) )
I might be able to visit Mars within my lifetime. I can't even wrap my head around how amazing this is.
its nonsense. the earth is flat
I call bullshit. I think Elon Musk has a lot of genius  in him, and a lot of crazy too.
Who actually believes this shit would work? Rockets are really explosive, launchpads are expensive, and landing is relatively difficult. \n\nAt any possible price, people would be paying 3X as much to save like freaking 7 hours of travel time. Best case:\n\nProject actually works in 40 years. Price relegates it to the rich.\n\nWOOOOOO. FAKE HYPE OVER IMPOSSIBLE IDEASSSS. I DON'T FACT CHECK!
The earth is flat! It's all a lie
Yes let’s colonise an uninhabitable planet good job
We should fix the problems of this world, before going to another.
Fusion is slave of musk
Only fun thing with going to Mars is that you would be first.
ha ha ha they changed the year again how can anyone buy into this crap! Check out Orion project they admit they can't get passed the van allen belts!
From Amazon to SpaceX to Nasa and Lockheed, all are in a race to colonize Mars first. But I really wonder why. All these separate missions will cost billions to trillions of dollars. Why don't they invest this money on something which is habitable, earth (still, and for a few more decades possibly), do research to reverse or control global warming effects and rising temperatures (mend Ozone holes) and water scarcity, help millions of people, and continue to keep earth habitable? Why making mankind a multiplanetary specie has become suddenly so important when there are hundreds of large-scale issues to handle? Can anyone help me understand this???
Even if we could, why should we?  There are no resources there.  We would only be using material that we need here on Earth and getting nothing back.  Everyone in the world is scrambling for resources and this video suggests we simply shoot them into Outerspace because we are able to.  Sci-Fi boner!  Hooray!  But it makes no sense.
But Mars is literally a desert. Why would we want to go there and how would we survive if there is no water there?!
Jim stop playing pranks on Dwight.
Gotta get Cici to college any way he can
Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.
Looks like Dwight finally took things too far
Dame Michael Scot. Threat Level Midnight 2 looks amazing.
Reminds me of Call of Duty cutscenes.
Where’s Pam?
Goldenface is that you?
He's probably just trying to save the receptionist
Can't take this seriously watched to much office lol
Goldenface???!!!
I guess his sport agent thing didn't work out.
Glad John Krasinski is back to doing more action/military movies. He was awesome and a BADASS in 13 Hours! Looking forward to this
i see Jim. i click
Goldenface is at it again
Jimbo
This looks like it's loosely based on Teeth of the Tiger? So they're just skipping over Ryan's whole Presidency and just inserting Junior into the film world?
Is this another one of those fake CIA pranks you and Pam pull on Dwight? You might have taken it to far, like Sam Pepper far
This is gonna be his best prank yet. Dwight won't know what's coming
You've got the wrong guy man!  I'm just some dude looking at YouTube videos!  HEEEEEEEELP!!!
Jim's pranks are getting out of control.
JIM STOP THIS NONSENSE AND GET BACK TO WORK
Fck. Can't wait too see John Krasinski in a more serious role. Love this man. \n\n\n\n\n#nohomo
Lmao they used the sound bite of muslim yelling that's used in CoD.
John Krasinski really pulls off the military/ intelligence look pretty well. Who would have thought a salesman at a mid-level, failing paper supply company would be so good at this line of work?
I want a rainbow six movie. (Like the actual Clancy book)
For the life of me, I can't understand why people who can't separate Krasinski from Jim Halpert want to point out that level of stupidity endlessly. This series looks amazing.
They shouldn’t have put John in the thumbnail
The Esurance guy is really movin' up in the world.
that voice. is his voice channeling... Harrison's Ryan? either way, i'm in!
spoiler alert. he is bearman
I came for the office jokes
I just see JIM
i swear the arabic shouting at 0:09 is from Call of Duty 4
Threat level Midnight part 2: Return of Goldenface
Jim, enough with the pranks
I'm on board.
This looks exactly the same as his movie 13 Hours
Big Tuna!!!
Why does it still feel like Jim's playing some prank on Dwight? lol
I’m sorry I just can’t take him seriously.
I think it would make everyone’s day if there was more people from the office in this
This Must be a joke! “A man’s gotta know his limitations”-Dirty Harry
Hey look jim
JIIIIIIIII
Looks like Decker.
Jim should be Nathan drake.
Dammit, Jim!
Jim!!!!
Tom Clancy you're crazy dude, how you make all these games and movies by yourself?
Big Tuna!
GOLDEN FACE
Threat Level: Midnight
💩💩💩💩💩💩🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩🖕🏻💩💩💩
The UK version was better.
Looks like trash. Glad I pay for netflix instead of Amazon.
what up, Big Tuna?
The Dunder Mifflin accounts?
What happened to jim
Being tased does not knock you unconscious...Why do so many movies and TV shows portray it that way?
This looks dumb. Just make a movie true to his book series. Like a true to book movie of without remorse
Don't know what this is or why it's trending but I have one question Amazon.. why did ya'll cancel Z The Beginning Of Everything season 2?
lol this dork is worse than Sam Worthington, who keeps casting him?
Wow! Your speech sounds so much better! You can definitely tell that you have been working hard at speech therapy!
So if you're sick and poor you're gonna die?
im so sorry your healthcare sucks im in Australia and we are lucky to pay any money at all 😣 you should of came here for it
Darling girl, I so wish things were the same for you as they are for me in Canada. Once you are through with kicking cancer's ass I hope you are a strong voice and advocate for a decent public healthcare system in America! I have heard horror stories about Americans having to choose to die simply because they could not afford to live. It's horrible. So horrible. We will see you through and then we will work towards seeing everyone else through as well. I love you and keep staying strong.
This is so sad, that you have to ask for this help! Being from the U.K. The NHS is free to every person. I can't fathom why you have to pay for healthcare!!! We pay our taxes, but wether you pay taxes or you are unemployed..... the NHS is free to all, no matter the trauma. Us brits don't know how lucky we are, we don't have the worry when it comes to our health!!! \nYou take care and hope you raise lots and lots xxxxx
To all of the people saying, How does America do this? I don't understand; who can pay that It's just like that here... it's kind of a gimmick because nobody expects you to pay that; instead they loop you in on payments with interest so that their income is secure... pretty genius if you ask me, though evil. This is exactly the same price as our education. College system is a joke here.
Girl just my brai surgery and everything I needed for the hospital stay for the week was $176,000 ! That didn't even include my therapy and aftercare. It's insane!  I'm 31 and my life has been turned upside down
The cost of all this is insane.\nBut on a happy note, you said radiation properly!!! I'm so exited for you! You're doing so well!
You're doing so well with your speech!! You've made so much progress!!! You can say radiation really well and I can really tell that your speech has improved!!! You're such an amazing woman and you're doing so well!!! You're Such an inspiration to be strong and keep pushing through life!! Simply incredible!!!
Courtney I wish I had enough money to pay it all off for you with everything you have been through but for sure I will go & donate what I can..take care hun!
I had brain surgery last November and my insurance was billed 165,000!! Thank god for insurance I only ended up paying 4,000-5,000 of that bill. Being chronically ill is expensive :( I hope you are starting to feel better. <3
Fuck America. More money spent on wars. Glad to be in Australia
America has third world mentality. I am lucky enough to live in Canada, but I hope the USA can get into the first world soon.
You did so well reading those numbers! Congratulations on your amazing progress! I am constantly praying for you ❤
if this aint reason enough to move to canada.....
I work in medical billing and this is a normal bill - not great news for the patient but the doctors and medical professionals have to go to school for so long and carry so much malpractice insurance that they do require a decent salary. I hope that someday health care insurance changes and we can all have a right to it, but for now it is just BIG business.
Omg I am mortified at the cost of this treatment and it makes me more greatfull to have the NHS here in the U K thank you for letting us know the costs I did get a reality check I hope your doing ok xx
this is crazy to me, living in the uk, money and healthcare are so disconnected for your average joe. We receive free health care here, I’ve never been so grateful for it.
Your speech is soooo much better!!! 😱💕
Get her on Ellen so she can pay it all for her . I wish I could donate but I'm too young for a bank account yet 😩
That's crazy 🙁
and thats also a lot for a brain surgeon to make too lol
I had to have two liver transplants which cost just over 1 million dollars. So crazy. My dad said that if we didn't have insurance we would be homeless right now. So sad that life saving procedures cost so much.
your speech is PERFECT
Your speech is getting better! Stay positive girl! 💕
It is unbelievable how the health care system in the US is working. Here in Germany EVERYONE has to have a health insurance. And they pay almost EVERYTHING for you.
This would've all been free where I'm from (EU). I'm giving birth in a month, won't pay a dime. Of course it's not literally free, we pay taxes so everyone can have access to healthcare. Gladly. The US system is sick.
What is up with the healthcare system in America? It's unbelievable! I feel so fortunate to live in the UK where we have the NHS. I hope you raise the funds you need hun. If I'm ever in a position to donate money I will definitely think of you x
how does it work in USA? for example i live in South Africa, we join and pay a medical aid company, you can choose a specific plan that suits your finances, however when you go into hospital for a surgery etc, if you havea hospital cover you do not have to pay for anything that is carried out in hospital. For example when i had my babies my C sections and total was about R30 000 (about $3000) which we never had to pay for. Do you have to pay monthly in the US? I know you talk about insurance but is that like medical aid cover?
That's scary how expensive it is. America definitely needs to change their health care system :(
Omg it's Soo expensive but it's worth  this is only way for you to live.. Am always impressive by your attitude .. thank you.. god bless
Thank God I live in Canada. I'm sorry your medical system is so screwed up. No one should have to pay that type of money for a surgery/treatment that they need to stay alive.
Wow I feel lucky we have the NHS and don't have to worry about costs ect.. should be the same everywhere x
Crazy, im British and this would have cost £0. The only thing you pay for is parking at the hospital.
in belgium chimo is free to all
Are you trying to raise the full cost on your go fund me page ...or did you have health insurance to cover it?
British people, we’re so lucky to have the NHS!!!
This is what I really hate about America. Here in Italy it would have been free
YOUR SPEECH IS GETTING SO MUCH BETTER LOVE!!
Is this in US dollars?
omg I didn't know radiation was that expensive...I moved to australia and am doing radiation right now and will be done on monday (35 treatments total) America's healthcare system is a mess...
That is so expensive what the hell!! 😪
This makes me extremely grateful for having our free NHS system after watching this 😢
This country is a sickening joke. I hope you get your bills taken care of <3
Wow, I can't believe that?! That is god awful. Just to let you know, you are my sole inspiration, I love you. \n// Side note; Oh my word...this treatment [or any tbf] if free of charge to any patient in the UK, woah.
I think it is shocking to see how many people in America struggle to afford even the most basic health care. Luckily, where I am from, healthcare is universal
Wow, here in Scotland everything is free. All medical costs. All education
Thank goodness for the NHS. Anyone from England ?
Your recovery is just impressive ! I wouldn't have guessed you had a brain surgery so not long ago ! You are such a strong and inspiring woman, I'm not used to letting comments but I think you really deserve to know how powerful you are. I think you should really be proud of you ! \nA French viewer :)
That’s so crazy! My back surgery cost $365,000 but then my insurance covered all but $15,000 of it. \nI am so glad that you were able to get the surgery done. I wish that you didn’t have to pay for any of this. It isn’t your fault that you had a brain tumor!!
The american health care system is disgusting. How can you suck money out of dying people. If you don't have the money will they just let you die in from of the hospital or what ?
My elbow surgery would've been about $30,000. But insurance had me pay $2500.
it would be amazing if she'd worked with any brands in the past if they could make a donation?
I'm thankful for the spanish social security. This is CRAZY
I couldn’t imagine how expensive my medical bill would be. I had to go to multiple drs appointments, specialists, MRIs, CT scans, my liver surgery, 3 more tube surgeries, hospital stays, X-rays, ER visits and ambulance rides. I was told it’d be around half a million if not more. I’m beyond thankful I am in the army and didn’t have to pay for any of it. I will definitely help you with what I can. Hope you keep getting better
This is unbelievable. If this exact scenario happened to me in Australia I wouldn’t have to pay for of it... My pop is on kidney dialysis, free. My nan just had a knee replacement, free. Treatment for Leukaemia? Free. \nI’m so confused America what are you doing
Hi sweetie  I'm so sad you live in America cause if you were here I. Australia you probably wouldn't have to pay a cent. You are such a beautiful special girl and I'm happy to hear your doing a gofundme   I'm heading over there right now to donate cause you are sooooooo awesome. You should also put ads on your videos   We will all click them so you can get cash faster 😂 love you girly  huggggs from #niki 🤗❤️🤗
Oh wow that is so scary in the UK we wouldn't have to pay for any of that! Just comes off out taxes
So thankfull that i live in Switzerland 🤘🙌 with a good health care system
So glad I live in the UK where health care is free
Reminds me if when my ex got sick and racked up about that much. Insurance reduced it to $4250. We ended up paying about $1000 of that after talking with the hospital. Now after telling my story I'm just going to say your really pretty and your freckles are awesome.
Oh. My. God. The United States medical care is so backwards. In Canada, all this treatment would be free of charge with the exception of prescriptions, which are usually reduced by 80% with most insurance programs. You also might have to pay for parking at the hospital... I'm so sorry you're incurring these costs, as if being diagnosed with brain cancer wasn't enough. Just awful.
i don't want to scare you or anything but it's better to be prepared right? cancer can or MIGHT come back ya know so maybe transfer to another country with better healthcare system or something IDK.. i guess what i'm really trying to say is to make a plan about financial stuff to prepare yourself in case... anyway i'm glad you seem to be doing great! 👊^-^
I have pretty good insurance thanks to my dad but after 2 emergency rooms visits ( I had to go a second time because they sent me home when I shoud’ve been admitted the first time) and I was diagnosed with a kidney disease called mgn and needed a kidney biopsy. I go to a nephrologist now and have to take chemo pills and prednisone as my treatment. After the bills started rolling in the total cost for everything was over $20,000 but after insurance I only have to pay a little over $4,000. But how is a college student expected to pay for that? It’s insane!
Here in Australia you wouldn't have had to pay 1cent towards it. I can't believe that on top of having to deal with having cancer and surgery you have to also worry about how you're going to pay for it all. My heart breaks for you.
You can file for medical bankrupty. Healthcare here sucks
Insurance company should cover all of it 😔 it’s not her fault she got cancer, why should she have to pay for all of this? It’s pretty bad you have to pay to keep yourself alive.
It is always sad to realize that only small amount of paid money will be given to ones that helped you the most.  And then it makes you think where is the rest and if it is worth it.
Obamacare is a disgrace I pay $600 a month for just coverage and I cannot afford to use it, the copay is so expensive. Life in America is very unfair.
I had to have an emergency surgery to save my life too.  I was literally dying from a perforated ulcer.  I was in sooooo much pain and discomfort and  too scared to go to the drs.  I couldn’t stop throwing up so my gramma called EMTs.  Had I waited a few more hours, I would’ve died I was so septic.  The surgery, therapy, aftercare, 15day Hospital stay etc totaled around $350,000.  I have medi-care like Senior citizens.  I was only 40, but I’m disabled.  After Medi-care paid, I had to file a Bancruptsy.  I get how costly this is and I’m sure your total is AFTER insurance
Wow!!! I hope your still had your teaching insurance!
You're saying radiation right!! Yayyy! Getting better day by day!
In Canada surgery is covered here with our tax dollars.
May God bless you and heal you!
You did a great job saying the numbers Courtney.  There are people who didn't have brain surgery, radiation and chemo therapy who can't say the large sums you did.  So kudos!\n\nMy Mom's first surgery at UCLA cost $77,000 or thereabouts but was covered by all the health insurance my Dad had taken out when they first got married.\n\nMy Mom's Second Brain Surgery and Hospitalization with Rehab way back in 1982 cost my parents $1.5 million after the first health insurance company paid. That includes, the surgeon's fees, ICU stay for a week, Regular room for 25 days then she was moved closer to Rehab and Occupational and Speech Therapy every from August 10th through October 15th.\n\nLuckily my Dad was a paranoid dude and he as a young man in the Navy he bought secondary, third, and fourth back up health insurance company.  He bought these back when he and my Mom were healthy young people with just one kid. Each successive kid (5 total) they added each of to the coverage.\n\nThe 2nd, 3rd, and 4th health insurance companies covered the $1.5 million. Each one paying their share. And oddly each one of those checks from the additional health insurance companies sent a check directly to my parents which they had to deposit into their back account then write a check to the hospital.  \n\nI don't think my parents expected this $1.5 million over 6 months influx of cash in their personal bank account to trigger an IRS Audit but oh boy did it. For three successive years my parents finances and taxes were Audited in person at the IRS office in Downtown LA.  And each year they marveled that my Dad's paranoia actually saved my Mom's life and kept our family untouched by the expense. \n\nMy Dad was clever and I don't think he ever expected to use the 2nd, 3rd or 4th health insurance policies. When he was active duty military for 25+ years all medical care for our family was covered even my second brother's childhood Heart Repair Surgery and aftercare. It was done at a Navy Base Hospital by Navy Doctors and the whole things was free.\n\nMedical cost out of pocket even with health insurance can be outrageous especially when its a surgery on the brain and requires additional treatment and rehab after but Courtney needs it so she can get her life back like my Mom got hers back.  I would ask that everyone that can give to Courtney definitely should give even if its just a few bucks.  I will give a few bucks at the end of the month after I set aside funds for my own surgery copays.
That's expensive. But to be honest it's no where near as expensive as I thought it would be. Especially for operating in the brain.
Thank you for addressing the issue of the burdensome cost of medical care. Did you have health insurance at the time or is the total out of pocket?
What's crazy is if just half of us (her subbies) just gave 1 dollar it would pay.for the whole surgery !!! So everyone just do a dollar and it will be totally paid for for Courtney I mean we can all spare one dollar and we all love her to pieces !! LETS DO IT GUYS
I will suggest you to go to India, as you will get all the facilities of a modern hospital with excellent expertise of doctors in just 1/3 of the price you pays there
The American health care system is so criminal... you guys shouldn't have to be paying for these kind of things. I'm thankful that I live in Canada and very thankful that everything here is covered and I don't have to pay a single cent. It's not fair that you have to pay thousands of dollars to get rid of something that's life threatening... I really hope that one day action gets taken and a better health care system gets introduced because like I said, this is just insane.
Your speech has improved so much! I watch every video of yours!
I will never understand how the US puts a price on a human life like that.. you are a slave to your own health and the bills that follow.
I had a different brain surgery
Start putting adds throughout your videos. I would happily watch an add to help at all. I’m so sorry for everything you’re going through. I’ve been watching you for a while now (about a year or more before you found out you had the tumor) and I love your videos. Look up to you so much for staying so strong.
Dang.\nWhen I was 5 I fell on the back of my head.\nDidn't get a concussion but did crack the back of my skull.\nStayed 5 days in the hospital and my mom was charged of 1k.\n(Didn't know why. Slept most of the time)\nOh yeah LOTS OF FUCKING BLOOD.
Hi court!! :) I’m glad to see you doing so much better girl and your speech is wonderful, it sucks to be in this financial struggle with all medical bills. Have you thought about getting Medi-cal? If you don’t know what is it you should look it up  we have that here in California. Also wondering with all those big bills how do you afford to buy expensive wigs?
I had scoliosis fusion surgery a few years ago and it costed $120,000. Thank God for insurance amirite😭
Why don't you make a go find me page ? I am willing to donate you and help you out and I am sure I am not alone :) ! Please ,like my comment so she can see it .
come to canada.
So brave! I hope everyone donates! Amazing!:)
Ridiculous.
Courtney may i ask you a question do you have a boyfriend
OMG!!!!! I had my brain surgery 2012 followed by radiation and chemo. Thankfully I am from the UK (Scotland) and we have the NHS ( National Health Service) so it cost me nothing. \nWith everything else you need to worry about the last thing you should have to worry about is how you are going to pay life saving treatment. \nStay strong X x
Your trending #40!!@
I am SOOOOOOO GLAD A I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA ....my mum had cancer twice and had aggressive treatment and it cost her NOTHING ....no insurance either .....we have medicare here and we pay nothing .... I live in the lucky country for sure
for some reason i thought she was australian lol
You didn't mention how much your insurance covered?
Hey Ms. Warner it's dayshaun we all miss  your might head still love you dramatic self
She's really milking this brain surgery topic
I'm from canada and I wish people up here would stop complaining that our health care system sucks because they have no idea how lucky we are we don't have to see those types of numbers when we have surgery if any numbers at all. I'm so sorry Court. I would donate if I could, I'm a student currently and having to borrow money from my mom and friends. Much love always

A more accurate title would be “a complete list of stories that cnn has not lied and or was extremely biased about”
Shit report this shit under missleading fuck this channel and video
10 seconds of silence, no video?  Some1 lose the DVD ?
CNN literally puts up a video of nothing and its trending... yea there is no bias on trending videos
The reason is that people want to protect themselves from attacks.
if this isn't evidence of favoritism in trending IDK what is.
What cnn couldn't come up with any bullshit lie for a change?\nBottom line is cnn is full of shit all the way from the owners to the talking heads to the viewers.
I feel like everyone who clicked this is now on a list.
FAKE NEWS!! THEYRE BETTER AT CLICKBAIT THEN JAKE PAUL AND LANCE STEWART
Well that was enlightening.
all cnns news should be like this
This is some next level classified information
Seems like another rock solid example of CNN journalism.
I love it! This is the best peaceful unbiased video ever in years! ....Well that Corrupt News Network has made anyways. Congratulations, maybe y'all are getting back on track to True News.  (Highly Unlikely)
It's not rocket science why, Bill Nye. Damn
CNN is  FAKE NEWS,  we need to STOP watching  this LIBERAL AGENDA ,BRAINWASHING  CRAP!!!👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺
so YouTube just saw how glorious this video was and it's only number 30 on trending? should be first, trending is rigged
I'll be goddamned. So, George W. Bush DID do 9/11.
I had no idea!
CNN finally understood that's sometimes its better not to say anything than bullshiting
So this is trending but Asian Jake Paul is nowhere to be seen... cool.
Some cracked at CNN thought it was a good idea to upload this....
Nice one... will someone please fire Susan?
Who the fuck liked this video!?
This is a top 30 anime betrayal.
Democrats are gonna lose big league in 2018 and 2020.
Great clip, I am sure liberals got allot of facts from it.
How about because people are afraid that their guns will be taken away so they buy alot before they can be taken away from gun stores.
what the hell even is this? lol, and people say the trending page isn't hand-picked by youtube staff. this is proof, because if it was based on shares like some people say it is, then who the hell would be sharing this
This is trending but idubbz isn't???
What the fuck is wrong with the YouTube trending algorithm?!
The first 10 seconds was my favorite part.
Wow so deep it's black. So profound it's silence.
So this is on trending? Thanks  JEWTUBE
Thank you CNN for this insightful commentary on gun control. Obviously we should be spending 10 seconds of our life on fake news, instead of a video that you could've made titled Oh shit, Shooting occured, plz help those in need.\n\nI'm quite curious as to why your video editor didn't actually make a video, I literally could've made this video in 10 seconds exactly. In fact, these are the types of videos that make regular YouTube viewers think that YouTuber's jobs are easy, because let's be honest here - they think that our 20 minute videos only took 20 minutes to make. Instead, they usually take much longer. \n\nEither way, thanks for this beautiful like to dislike ratio. The fact t hat this is trending obviously means that you paid someone, hence your name - CNNMoney. Anyways, thanks for reading, catch you on the flipside, now I'm going back to watch Fox.
Someone’s getting fired today.
Best news in whole fucking history
Since the makers of this video who paid YouTube to get on the trending page won't tell you, I will. Gun stocks rise because people are motivated to buy guns after a mass shooting. Part of what motivates them to do this is the desire to protect themselves from a perceived danger. The other part of this is that people know that politicians will use this even to try and restrict access to guns so it makes people think they'd better buy now before they lose the opportunity. Naturally, when sales go up, the companies do better. When the companies do better, their stock rises because more people see it as a good investment.
Interesting theory. Big if true
Love dumb idiots who dont get it lol. THERES NO GOOD REASON PEOPLE, jesus how can cnn fucking spell it out for you....
Unbiased news source, my ass. How about the fact that shootings remind people of the right to self preservation?
I've been waiting for something like this to happen
So Paul Monica at cnn is why gun stocks go up? Get your shit together! This is trending?
People boy guns too protect themselves in a similar situation is the answer
Cause it proves the effectiveness
*black screen*\n\n\n*not available in restricted mode*
I bought a machine gun over the counter for like $20 yesterday. Clerk was too busy to do the paperwork, and was like, meh, you're white, go ahead. Thank God for muh white privilege.
Why the fuck is this on trending?
Haha you stupid idiots. they don't even know what their talking about
What did I just watch for a good 10 seconds?
Fuck was this video for?
I'll answer the question.\n\nBecause asshats like CNN start beating the BAN ALL GUNS drum.\n\nSo me and everyone else starts buying more guns in case that becomes reality.
Thats that fake news shit right there
Probably the most useful video ever posted by CNN
Well...it’s not fake news at least
proof that the trending page is rigged
What the fuck is this and how is it #32 on trending? Never trusting trending page again.
Still doing your research off 4chan buzzfeed? Oh wait this is CNN
So this is on trending... but the Content Cop on Rice Gum isn't?
This really change my point of view on guns
This was emotional. You could hear Paul R. La Monica's voice breaking as he explains this... R.I.P Vegas
Not even a link to an article or anything?
shocking and revealing content from the Clinton news network. Sure wonder why it is in trending and not IDubbbz new video. Susan you have some splaining.
Gotta trick the youtuber viewers an program CNN into there minds subliminaly to get people to watch them again RIGHT BABE?
Thank you so much cnn, for I have been enlightened
Ooooh! That’s why?! Cool. Very informative. \nTrump is not going to like what you showed at 0:04 and 0:06\n\n#CNNisTHEbest
Wow censorship much
More original content than pewdiepie
CNN= fake news
CNN HAS NOTHING TO SAY.
Bad day?
Fake news
CNN IS ISIS
so CNN, fake news much?
Report this crap

Surely someone will give her the USB, she'd probably take 2 USB's at the same time at this point.
I liked the video but I then started thinking about my own relationship...
I can't with this... I just... I can't
...that's not the punchline I was expecting.
you guys never cease to make me laugh
I really want to dislike to break the 199
HE'S BEEN USING OTHER DEVICES\nJack:WHAAAAAAAAT
This made my day XD
😂😂😂😂This is way to funny
Now they've both fucked inanimate objects. Jack's fucked a balloon and Dean's fucked a computer.
I will admit the end kind of surprised me
This reminds me of closer
I just need disk space is honestly my favourite joke in this sketch.
She sure is the Apple of my i...Mac.
I love this so fucking much
This humour is just so smart, I love you guys!❤️
I  w a s n ' t  d r a w i n g  o n  c h e s t  h a i r
can we still resolve why Jack was drawing on chest hair with a permanent marker?
That's why i loved you guys for years now, you always have creative ideas that genuinely make me laugh :D
Lowkey wanna be that Computer at the end....
It all makes sense now, that's how people fuck their laptops
very Her. i liked it.
Loved this premiered at Buffer Festival and love it again!
i’m confused on what i should feel
Yes! What else would I be doing?\n--I laughed so hard my mom was concerned about me
What else would I be doing!!! than watching jack and dean videos all day
This was incredible! Also I'm always surprised by their accent lol why
The outro being parallel to the first shot was a nice touch. Lovely sketch!
Thank you for this 👌 content lmao
It took me so long to figure out it was Anna Akana's voice
Yo I'm new here, are they dating?
reminds me of spike jonze's Her
Should I be proud that jack & dean are on trending or concerned that 186K people watched a video about a man rubbing his dick against a computer??
this is the future millenials want
this is just the ultimate what the fuck video😂😂😂
Not the ending I was expecting.
Queue Bad Religion - I Love My Computer.
Welcome to the world of tomorrow. ..
I can't believe this is #18 on trending!
and they say the perfect video doesn’t exist
WT FUCK IS THE END NO THERE IS A LINE THAT YOU CROSSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI might watch that again
What the actual fuck
If that last bit wouldn't be there then this video would have been amazing
Lol I don't know what I just watched, but my boyfriend said I can never pick videos again...he can't stop me xD
Reminds me of an 07 - 08 YouTube. I have missed sketches like this. Nostalgic for me. glad I found this video
Holy shit this is great 😁😁😁
Am I the only one that felt genuinely akward during that exchange?
OMG 😱! Am I the only one who felt that response when the laptop said it's... Different, ahhh man, that's when hell would've broken loose for me!
The fact that Anna is in this video, even just as a voice, makes me hate it!
This is the best thing ever XD
It's .... different. *flashbacks to the ross and rachel break up scene*
I've never seen this video nor do i know about these guys, but from the thumbnail I could tell they were British. Great video 👍🏼
These guys deserve so many more subscribers!
_I don't use Apple. I prefer Pear._
so the cult of apple has become a sex cult got ya.
That ending haha.. I just thought. He would be putting a usb in and out really fast..not fucking his computer haha
Watching your videos is always a bit wierd for me because my name is Dean and then to hear somebody say your name even though they aren't talking about you feels wierd.
Why is there Xmas songs in the background ?!
Check out my channel guys, subscribe if you find it interesting. THANKS!!!
Finally a new video \nI luv it
It would've been funnier if you guys kept the whole reference implied. Once you start saying things like polyamourus and dick... It breaks the joke quite a bit.
Briljant :)
THIS IS SONE FUCKING WEIRD SHIT
i love this
Her (2013) dir. by Spike Jonze
Nice chest hair btw
that got weird fast
THIS IS BRILLIANT
This people
**Sponsored by Apple**
oh wow that ending XD

Holy shit Dean is-
Perfect!
Her

I heart Anna Akana
OMG! That is freaking hilarious!!
Oh uhm, wow 😮

First Self Conscience vampire from CollegeHumour and now this lol. Keep it up J&S
I want one of the brockhampton boys in this show
Get Jason Sudeikis! He’s a sneakerhead
Shove a shoe in her mouth. Nothing sincere about her in the least.
But like, if homeboy come in with these , hes gonna like....... get it
I think Bella is trying to the cute younger sister and tell people she's cooler than Gigi. It's so cute!
I did not realize she was 20 years old, what the shit?
Run The Jewels next. 🤜👈
What did The Weeknd do to her 😭😭 what she’s saying is completely cringe worthy. She’s trying way to hard
Does Bella really talk like that? I'm screaming. Homeboy with the Air Max or Jordans he gonna like get it-Bella Hadid 2017
Seems like she smoked too much dope before coming
shut u p bella hadid I  do not  need ric hshoes to be comfortable
Who else die for like 5secs when she crease TF out of the off white 1's😂😂😂
Women in the comments hating on Bella lol so damn sad
Listen Travis too awkward to be on any interview
shes like the white washed black kid that tries to act black
But if he comes through in like, theeeEEEse, YOU GOT SOME AIR MAXES OUT HERE, got some JooRDAAANS, homeboy is gonna like............ get it..
Never cared for the girl but I got a thing for her now after seeing her attitude lol
why she talk like an undercover cop
At least she can actually form a normal sentence without 'ummmmm' and 'likeeeeee'.
Joe's lucky day
the boobs is to flat
how is she a model shes ugly af
She move like a godddesss
She is so rich and shit but why the cheap eye bags?
She's prettier than I initially thought but good Lord she's dumb as a box of rocks...

Dude, wtf. *Why would complex show this out of all shows!* 2:21 I immediately had epilepsy
I like her. I think I connect with her. Smart beautiful woman with huge surprises.
why does her hair stylist always pull her hair up so tight???!! she looks so stunning with her hair down instead of looking like her hair will rip off if she moves her eyebrows.
The way she’s talking is making me cringe so hard 😂

Y'all should do lil pump
Reminds me of my Ex don’t like her
When she creased those off white 1's made me CRINGE the most lmao

She’s a bad bitch
Is it just me or is she trying too hard to be ‘hood’? I mean I love her, but it’s like cringe haha.

Sneaker shopping coming with joe de la puma coming soon😂😂😂

Why is Macklemore testing these carbon wheels and using a Scottish accent? ?
I wonder how these would hold up for Bmx street riding like if they would hold up Santa Cruz needs to make them in 20”
Spider bike spider bike does what a spider might lol
I'm not saying they are bad, I'm just saying he was putting his weight on the front tire during the hard stuff
I wonder how many wheels/rims were used to make this advertisement.
I've never actually seen him fall before
It took such a beating
And now here I am with my Fulcrum XC wheels, bending them and bending them back they are totally fucked. Really fragile considering some Mavic rims but on a budget for a Hardtail also a wider rim above 30mm better.
Danny boy gets his back rim burst to bits 😆😆😆
Children in Afrika could have eatin the wheel
How much is it
The weight on these aren't horrible either.. I was expecting heavier after having seen this
Not that impressed.  I did a 2 foot long jobby once.  Now that was impressive!
I bought abike for 2.000 ebike there serously worth to buy it saves u from buying shitty petrol very powerful bikes
Would somebody please think of those poor stairs and the damage that is being done to them. \n\nYeah yeah nice rims and all, but those stairs are beauts. All flat and, perfecto spaced sexy as dick right now. Lol
I always find it funny when a watch a YouTube video and see glasgow
But did they replace that rim under warranty?   :)
Could you next time please tell us what tire pressure you use for riding,jumping,.....
That is one MEGA SICK set of wheels
Racer wheels wouldn't stand a chance ......, because they are crap lol
2:40 How is it full of air again???
I need this rim, mine is bent so bad that a certain rotation point it hit against the bike frame on both sides and it makes funny noisy. Long story short my rim is fucked
He was next to my house
I thought the title said Reverse Carbon Wheels\n\nWas hoping for rubber rims and carbon tires lmao
please make a 20 in bmx wheelset
Carbon is strong, no doubt!
that's some crazy quality compared to aluminum or steel
I stick to my old school alloy 26
seeing him do that when it went flat hurt me in way you can't imagine 😂
Don't you want some flex in the rims so hits dont feel as hard
So sweet such a sick rider 👌👌
fuck ebike#wat a fraud formal Ban
Ebay - Slightly used .
How do they hold up doing 40mph on a rocky downhill?
That's always the slight niggle with carbon fibre - when it fatigues to failure it's abrupt
I wish I could have at least 10 presents of his skills
Santa Cruz bikes are so beautiful, but I can't afford them 😕
Add air, remove suspension, add a ton of weight
whens danny going to start a channel?
Bet I could snap it in 10 mins or less did it to !my identiti 666x snapped it clean in half
You don't need your bike😂
Now we want to see aluminium rim test
2:06 it's completely flat wtf
dirtiest rim job on the whole infernet
$1599 with the Dt350 hub\n$1899 with the I9 torch hub\nYa only problem is for a set of those rims I could buy a full 11 of my current bicycle with the Dt350 hub and 13 with the I9.
When these rims will available in 20 inc? , I want try them on a bmx. Becouse  its carbon it means its extra fuckin low weight??or nah
Cant be that good if they break that easy
I thought he was about to ride it tireless over a balcony or some crap
I think id rather aluminium bend than carbon fiber break in a stack and risk getting skewered  , picking the splinters out would be a bitch
at that point I would have fallen down the stairs. https://youtu.be/VfjjiHGuHoc?t=120
eBay description be like it has been taken good care of only used for a few hours
0:59 😮 I almost died of a heart attack \nSo risky
Imagine what the person person who invented bicycles would say
I wonder if jaws would Ollie that.. 1:55
They were just hoping he'd buy a set. They cost £5 million
Today i tried that by my old fulcrum but no puncture haha and its awesome !!!
How much cost your bike? (Answear plz)
Btilliant! Fun to watch
Top...
Nice
OMG
强的一批
Damn... great marketing move. Def some good rims.
Идиот хули - что ещё сказать!
Gotta love Chemistry
Hablan solo ingles U.U
Noice, smash em!
Fudendo um aro assim, pqp

👎👎👎
This video pisses jared graves off
...oh, Glasgo :')
sicher haben die nach jedem versuch die felge gewechselt
Pourquoi ??????????????? J'économise depuis longtemps pour avoir un Santa Cruz, et lui il les casse 😑 normal!!!
Adam
The guy's got too much money to smash a good bike to make fools, so it's one of them. It would have been better to show the stunts and how strong he was, and he gave it to the boy 12-14 years, be riding on a bike that the parents can't buy a good bike from. Stupid video, Dizlajk.
PLEASE do no do this test again in a public space...you know that when carbon fiber breaks it leaves very sharp splinters everywhere so don't you think some animals like a dog could get injured walking in that area? Love you guys but just wanted to point that out.
am guessing a couple of grand per set the add uk tax e.t.c oh £3000 a pair. i'll have a set for everyday of the year cheers ;-p
What bike model?
Im throwing my debit card at the screen but nothing is happening, can anyone help? XD
Beat on point lyrics not so much.
MY 2 FAVORITES NIGGAZ IN THE GAME GUCCI & OFF-SET the feat almost make me cry 💨💨💥 They always keep the gun #realniggastaystreet
Take it over, these commas keep building.
I just automatically like when I see Gucci and migos together.
Some of these bitches look rough lol
i feel like gucci mane was the one ft offset went off
135 mill on the way
I LOVE THIS MUSIC FROM ITALY🔝
Is anyone tired of this genre of music yet?  For Fucks sakes this shit sucks.
YOU HAVE NOBODY FAKE UGLY BITCH! YOU A MONKEY!
Takeoff and offset the best, but takeoff would have killed this, gucci did decent.
huge migos and gucci mane fan but this shit sucks. y'all need to speak out when your fav rapper has a shitty track. no beat no flow
Bitch I'm offset and I'm bout to set it off.......so good🔥🔥🔥🔥
Offset got them bars🔥 and Gucci mane going with the flow ❇

I only tend to binge if it's a certain show. I binged a lot of the OA because I was completely hooked. Other shows I try to do one or two episodes at a time to save it. I've binged stuff in the past and then been sad that it was over so quickly.
I was super disciplined when I watched Freaks and Geeks, I watched one episode each night before I went to bed to make them last. It really helped me de-stress after a long, confusing, and tiring day of freshers. But I thought there were three seasons, so I thought I would be able to keep this as my holy grail switch off time for ages. There is only one season. I have one episode left to watch. But I'm too scared to watch it, cause as soon as I do, that's it... it's over. I'm saving it for a special occasion. Or least until I've found a new series to save me from the abyss that is having nothing to watch.
its honestly bc i'm impatient and i don't like waiting to see what happens so i'd rather do it all at once and be like WOW THAT RULED
Binging is necessary....... especially in the cold weather ❤️😊
I don't really binge watch, but once a week is definitely not enough. I like to watch 1 episode per day. If you make me wait a week (or even better: 6 months, like amazon is apparently doing) I end up forgetting about it. I used to watch buffy with my mom, but when she got a new work schedule it became harder to watch together and to this day I still haven't finished the last season (for one thing I forgot which episode/disc I'm at) ._.
Without using ur mobile date Lol Idc I've got that unlimited shit boi.
I binge for two kind of opposite reasons which is weird... Like, when I was unemployed I would binge because I had nothing to do. I had nobody to stop me sitting there and binging all 6 seasons (it was 6 at the time) of Game of Thrones if I wanted to. \nNow I binge because I'm busy with uni, YouTube, friends and family. I can't know that I'm going to be available every Wednesday night. So I'll save up some episodes and binge them all at once. Or better yet, with Attack on Titan, I'm waiting till I have a spare weekend and I'm going to binge the whole second season. (That only works with stuff like anime though, because if it was something like Game of Thrones there would be too many spoilers.)
first thing I binge watched was Lost. I think we do it or at least I do it, because its a better way to experience it. You are 100% into the story and the world when you binge watch. Only one episode a week is limiting. I prefer it when it airs weekly because I don't have time to binge watch and im too weak not to but the experience is enhanced when youve spent the last 7hours inside the same universe.
I binge on shows but I because I spend so much time in that world and with those characters I end up getting tired of it. Loads of shows have 4+ seasons and I've noticed that I become a bit of a tv commitaphobe.  It just becomes predictable or the characters/plot get annoying. It's probably why I tend to prefer bbc dramas.
I don't like to binge at all. I used to but a problem that I encountered is that to me personally no show feels special anymore. A big part of the fun of a show is the hype before and the happy feeling I'm left with after the episode. If I watch a complete season at once it feels like having a really good expensive cup of coffee, putting a funnel in my mouth and drinking the coffee in one sip.
I watch about 1% of the amount of movies/tv now that I'm in a relationship. Oh, and MON season 2 is BRILLIANT! A black and white, all Italian ep?!! Awesome.
I don't watch TV, but I do watch youtube for hours
The only things I can fully binge by myself are things that don't require much focus so I can multitask otherwise I feel like I'm procrastinating, so like Pokemon (yea I'm 2 decades old and what that shit's great) I watch while I'm doing the practical side of my costume course, and the best one actually was when I had to pull an all nighter to finish a piece of costume jewellery in time for presentation the next day so I stuck The Mighty Boosh on, got through every season and finished at like 7am just in time to pack everything up ready for uni... The result was a really feckin surreal bus ride after Noel Fielding's mind had become my normality
Have you seen Harlan Coben's The Five on Netflix? SO GOOD. I can't believe nobody is talking about it... I lost an entire day to it and I don't regret it.
I'm one of the weirdos who watches TV as it airs, it's always been something that we've done as a family and it feels wrong not to, there always seems to be a drama or comedy series on and we tend to plan our nights based around TV, e.g. We have nothing to watch on Thursdays so homework/housework/paperwork can go on uninterrupted OR we can go to bed earlier on Wednesday and watch that show Thursday. While it's amazing when you can binge a series I still quite like the wait for a new episode, it keeps my attention piqued and helps to get my brain going - since I've not watched it back to back I have to pay attention. I do tend to go back later and binge the entire series in one go but with a little brother and A levels for me spreading things out works better with schedule, especially when I feel like others are relying on me being done so THEY can watch TV. \n\nI also really miss the water cooler effect, talking about TV was the best fuckin thing and now it doesn't happen, major regrets.
My only way of watching shows is through binge to be honest, my job is pretty full on 5 days a week, sometimes more and obviously on my days off I try to make plans with people I haven't seen in months because of my job, so I miss a lot of aired shows, so when I find time (9/10 at stupid o'clock in the morning) is when I actually be able to watch the shows I plan to, my to watch list of shows is near enough impossible to accomplish at the moment, I don't have time to sit and watch aired shows because I'm not at home when they do 😂, but yeah that's my reason on binging, this might be interesting it might not to your points on binging but oh well 😂😂
I binge watch so much! I hate it when social media spoils it. Depending on the day and the amount of a level work I have to do then I will watch all day
My first binge was Charmed box sets about 9-10 years ago. I like to think I've come a long way since then...
I watch things sporadically, usually a couple of episodes back to back but I don't think I've ever watched an entire series of something in one go
I can never do more than three episodes in a row bc I get restless and bored, no matter how good the series is :/
It's weird but I find that the length of one episode defines whether I binge something or not. If it's under 30 minutes, yes. But any longer like 40 or 45? No. I can't do it. It either has something to do with my existentialism or attention span. I get bored or feel like too much time is passing. But watching 4 twenty minute episodes feels fine, but not 2 40 minute episodes. I think it's that feeling of accomplishment. But then again, I don't know shit.
We used to go to the pub and binge .  .  social . .  ness.
Been loving your channel recently Jack!!
The only series I sort of binged is Stranger things, in two sitting. I'm not really a binge person, for some reason I can't bring myself to watch more than 2 episodes of anything consecutively, though i'm not watching anything as it airs either... i guess i'm just a slow watcher in general
Restraint? Ha! I laugh in the face of restraint! Well I mean I would if I could see it, all I can see now are bright, rectangular lights.
You have to disclose that this is an ad in the title. Great video as always :)
I think you skimmed over impatience - our society and lifestyle is so fast paced that we've lost a lot of patience and I think that contributes to why we binge.\n\nAlso - Jack, have you ever watched the Spiderman cartoons? They were a part in my childhood and I've definitely binge watched them at some point.
my concentration is just not enough to binge watch an entire series, i usually give up after two or three episodes
Yeaaaah I sometimes find binging exhausting to the point I get bored with the series. I unfortunately did that with the last season of Orange Is A New Black but then there are shows like glee that I spent all of my free time on. So I don't know the rule but I guess sometimes when the series is too long it's better to watch it with a little breaks just to enjoy every part of it 😆
I find it fascinating how socially accepted it is even though we use the word binge. Binge is usually used to describe illnesses e.g. binge eating or binge drinking. I'm doing my dissertation on binge-watching and the psychological effects it has on our behaviour so this was an interesting video
We've all been there
i usually binge stuff on really busy days, when I have a lot of chores around the house like cleaning or ironing clothes, repetitive chores you don't have to devote a lot of brainspace to. but it's usually an easy show or audio book i listen to, that lets you not be 100% concentrated to it and not miss anything. OR I binge stuff on days I feel bad or sick, but then I need something more immersive that doesn't let me think and tune out, so my mind is occupied. otherwise, I'm not a fan watching an episode per week, because I feel it waters the show down
Honestly, I don't binge tv shows. Not because I restrain myself, but because if I watch more than 2/3 episodes (depends on the show and length of episode) a day my brain gets so full of that show I'll constantly dream about it at night, to the point that I'm half awake and kind of rewatching the show in my head, and I'll spend all day thinking about it too. So I just don't watch too much of a show, generally :'). \n\nBut maybe 2-3 episodes a day is also bingeing? It is compared to watching 1 show a week, but my friends will sometimes watch 8 episodes a day when they like a show so compared to them, I'm very mild. When are you really bingeing a show? How many episodes within how short a timeframe would be bingeing?
first thing i binge watched was the simpsons like i used to collect all the boxsets from second hand stores and sit there and watch entire seasons. mostly i now bingewatch when doing something like cleaning or studying as 'background noise'. its actually quite hard for me to be at home and not have the tv or my laptop playing something as i tend to feel immense boredom
my first 'binge' was Heroes. All my mates were a few eps before the finale and raving on about it, so I caught up with them so I could have something to talk about.
I would be so annoyed if my sister watched prison break without me.
I think the first thing I binged was iCarly when Nickelodeon did a marathon of it haha
When you're bullimic and constantly ask yourself this
I have no self control, jack #bingeall
I take issue with the spoilers bit, you yourself did that one twitter with Game of Thrones on an episode that I had not yet seen which you then ruined  part of the plot of. If you are going to be critical of others Jack, don't be hypocritical.\n\nThanks\n\nA viewer
I am not good at binge watching on my own... I get distracted easily... but doing it with a friend or my parents, no problem!
I'd almost always wait for the full season to be released and just binge because I'm sort of impatient when it comes to series especially if they have cliffhangers at the end of each episode like I ain't tryna wait a week to find out
Throwing in a bit of media theory in there eh jack? I’m just so pleased I got what you meant  😂
I one time watched the first season of PLL in one sitting. Like 22 hours of content. It was a bet with my friend to see if we could do it (she watched it with me) but yeah. It’s simultaneously the best and worst time I binged something 😂
Certain shows that I watch are too exciting to only watch one episode at a time, it's like a book you can't put down, but we don't refer to that as binge reading
I was a little confused before this started, because I thought this video might be a talk about mental illness
I make sure to always have a few series that have episodes coming out every week as well as some series I can binge watch simultaneously. So that I have some shows to look forward to, but also the option to binge whenever I feel like it.
Net neutrality out the window. Did you even think about what you were promoting before you accepted the money for it? Pretty poor from you.
My friend trinity does this thing where she is convinced that she suggested the show to you. Shows like oitnb, 13 reasons why, stranger things and atypical. She is convinced that she told me to watch all them and gets a satisfaction from it. So the only way to let her know that she hasn’t persuaded my tv show choices I must watch them when they come out. Forcing me to take a day off school every time Orange is the new black releases a new series.
My bingeing keeps getting more and more ridiculous - just finished all 102 episodes of Suits in 3 weeks (highly recommend btw for anyone considering), and already looking for the next thing. It’s kind of strange but I like having something there in the background to ... fall back on? Like, if I’m doing the ironing, or I’m having an early night, or there’s a long journey ... I like integrating a show into my life, which probably means I’m missing something else right now, but yeah. It’s strangely comforting and I’m trying to find something to fill the void right now haha.
this season of GoT was the first season i've watched as it aired and really the only show i've watched live and it was so much fun, i loved going to work and everyone had watched it\nbut realistically unless a show is a hugely popular as GoT it's not really possible for the 'water cooler' conversation to work anymore? at least not by episode i don't think
I agree with what you said Jack and that study is so interesting! My partner would never get away with getting ahead of me in a show we are both watching, my mum is lucky I didn’t lose it when she got ahead of me in Outlander so yeah wow! \n\nThe last thing I binge watched was Wynonna Earp (finally!) and I did two seasons in two days now that was the last thing I binged and that was about two weeks ago and binged Defenders two/three weeks before so I do monitor and manage my bingeing but I’m always hesitant on shows because if people are like “Yes watch it, it’s amazing, you’ll love it!” I won’t like it as much, happened sadly with House of Cards and a few other shows and I’m quite a hypocrite too because I say that to people so I don’t blame them but I find it so interesting that, that is how my mind works (and possibly others) and the lifestyle that watching television is now! And I love it but living in Australia has its negatives with American tv because we have to illegally download or wait for DVD or until Netflix puts it on. So in Australia (and I’m sure other countries) Freeform’s Shadowhunters had its episodes uploaded weekly to Netflix so I could watch it, sadly once a week but now days time flies so before you know it you have one day before the new episode. \n\nBut anyway great vid! 👍🏻👍🏻
I have had restraint with rick and morty purely because i didnt want there to not be anymore! Its taken 2 weeks but im finishing it today, its my birthday so why not? That my friends is my restraint maximum😂
what's interesting is how some shows are different when binging - I mean, they clearly were made so differently. Like ER - that is an amazing show, but watching it without commercial breaks is irritating, because they roll back the scene and you are watching the same thing over and over again. That used to be a thing, but it's not anymore. There are also some of those that are so intense it's frustrating to watch, again, because there isn't a commercial break to lighten the tension.
I'm definitely a binge watcher! I wait until the whole season is our before binge watching it over a weekend... i guess it's because you can get enthralled in the series and can feel all the emotions because it's fresh in your head. Sometimes if the series is really good i binge watch it (so i can talk to friends about it) and then go back and watch it again at a slower pace to really enjoy it more... i did this with Riverdale
Absolutely love your videos where you chat about films so it was nice to hear you chat about TV shows as a change 😊 I’m definitely a binge watcher but then I also like the anticipation of watching one a week! Depends on the show I think 🤔
hold the phone. Catastrophe isn't an amazon show. I watched all of season 3 then went back and watched seasons 1 & 2 thinking that the next batch would be ready for me soon enough.
I think I use binging as a form of procrastination
Me, when all episodes of a season come out all at once I don't watch/binge them all at once. I will watch one or two episodes a day until I'm done. The only thing is, I don't like it when people spoil it on social media before I have finished!
My problem is that I get easily distracted. I can't watch more than one or two episodes at a time (and those have to be 30min episodes I can't deal with those 1h long ones) otherwise I'll get bored.
I do it when stressed tbh, so the amount is increasing daily
Yeah ex, why would you watch season 2 of master of none before season1?! I was asleep on the sofa, woke up halfway through the Italy episode, we watched the entire season in a day and then missed the last 20 minutes of the final episode... worst way to watch anything ever!
i like to binge shows ive already watched anyone else do that? like im currently doing that with Supernatural (tho stopped cause two jobs now ugh)
Netflix was designed around binge watching. Whenever you finish an episode and you're like, alright that's enough, it'll be like, look at this next episode!
I love to binge watch series because this way I'm much more involved into the story and world instead if I just watch one episode a week.
Jack Howard is a  Tottenham Hotspur fan spurs on there to wembley stadium come on you spurs
noone talks about binge reading. We binge read the harry potter books because they were a constant cliffhanger.  Binging is human nature it is a deadly sin (gluttony), but you cant die from too much Harry Potter or Stranger Things.....I hope.
The first several shows I binged (like you before that was the word used) I watched them on DVD, but on DVDs from the library, so I'd only have a week before I had to return the entire season, this was of course back in the pre-uni days when I had the time to watch a whole season in a week. Now I rarely watched shows as they air, there are still a few I record, but I'll typically watch them an hour later, because then I can skip through the commercials. I know I binge because I get impatient and want to keep consuming the media I'm enjoying
When I was sick in bed for a week with pneumonia, I watched a season of a series each day. Best guilty free binge of my life.
Why we Binge is an easy Question! It is because we want NOT TO END the Thing we like!
My aunt and I talked about binge watching recently [esp. with Game of Thrones] and realised that if you watch too much TV in one go, it's either too exhausting or you gradually lose sense of the potential complexities or nuances. Having rewatched s3 of GoT - 10 hours in two days - was exhausting which makes sense.\nI tend to watch two or three hours of TV any given day if I'm watching a show over a period of time. Occasionally I will watch more and lose track of time, so...Whoops.
i watch my shows on my own because my SO doesn't have taste in shows...
No restraint until the last few episodes, then I have almost limitless will power... I waited almost two years between the second last and last episodes of Deadwood because I couldn't stand the thought of having no new episodes to watch.... Maybe that's not restraint though
Personally, I do tend to have quite a fair amount of restraint when it comes to watching shows, especially on Netflix. For example, when new Marvel Netflix series come out, I tend to limit myself to one a day AND stick to it, it seems to give me just enough suspense to wonder what will happen next, but I'm not left waiting too long that I forget the last episode. I have been known on occasion however to erm... break that particular rule haha! Sped through the new BoJack Horseman as quick as I could! I do see both sides of the supposed argument though and I don't think there's really a wrong or bad side. Just comes down to personal preference! :)
The first series I really binged was Avatar the Last Airbender. I got hooked and had to watch it all before the finale came out. Lol
I just plain forget, so when I go to watch it there's a few eps waiting for me and I'll have binge to play catch up before I'm distracted by life again.
I don't... Get binge watching? It took me a month to watch Sherlock (before season 4 was released) and I still haven't finished season 2? 3? Of black mirror. For me, I need time to process every form of media I consume. Black mirror, for example, I watched Shut Up and Dance like months ago and I still haven't started the next episode. This goes with books and movies as well. People binge watching Harry Potter? Can't do it. People reading 7 books a month? Can't do it, even if I did have the time. I think for me, binge watching kind of takes away how much you appreciate the art of it all.
I thought I was the only one who got a little hurt when my partner watches shows without me
i have so much homework to do, but its the holidays and i plan on binge watching something today
You look like an egg with glasses and pretty great hair
Lol i thought this was gonna be about bingeing as in... Having an eating disorder lol i guess thats just me
I also binge to destress. The more stressful the day I've had, the more episodes I consume. But I can only watch on t.v series at a time? Committing to more than one series at a time stresses me out.
I hate binging, I stop enjoying it more than 2 episodes in since it gets old, binging just feels like filling time
I like to binge but when I do I start to binge too much because when I finish a show I then go and find the next show instantly which just leads to misery but I definitely prefer watching things as they come out or at least the same day or week because for me personally it's better because it doesn't consume all of my free time. I still think binge watching in moderation can be good.
It's a good concept by 3 to binge without data but if you read the small print your paying for TV channels and and adverts
I watched the first seven seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race in about two or three weeks
liking just coz you referred to hazel as your 'lady friend'
Season 2!!!! yooo
Ahhh, yes... The lady-friend...
Matchsticks
Procrastination - duh.
high ur a-noy-ing
My lady friend 😂😂😂
Very interesting video
“My lady friend”
Why doesn’t it say that it’s sponsored in the thumbnail?
Funny you mentioned this.... I just found your channel a couple of days ago and I just watched all of your content... Everything since 2009.... Yep...
Restraint? That's cute. ALL AT ONCE
I don't just binge....i binge them at 1.25x speed with subtitles...... 1.1x speed if i love the show
Has my carrier pigeon come by yet, Jack?
No cut scene?
Nick! You didn’t cut open the cupcake ☹️
I'm watching your video from Japan.\nI like your video very much, watch and become very happy.\nMy English is unskillful. \nsorry.\nI'm supporting from Japan.😆❣️

I wish we could call this real astronaut food 👩‍🚀
We need a huge cake version of this!!
Nick you didn't give us the cutting shot!
Hi Nick! Have been following you for quite a while now and I just wanted to let you know that your cupcakes creation are AMAZING!! Love it so so much :D
Make this into a cake!!
Can you do a tiered vanilla bean cake with vanilla bean fondant🙏🙏🙏 I kinda really love vanilla 🤤
Why didn’t you cut it!? 😩😂
Ive got to say this is my fave cupcake yet.
Very very cool!! You're awesome Nick👌🏼☺️
Real talk, do galaxies even have a midnight? I’d guess no.
This would be great as a cake
Oh sweet Jesus I just jizzed in my pants. These look ahhhhmazing!
Does it taste different with the charcoal?
omg adore the colours in this one... I am a huge galaxy colour/design fan... might be making something like this for my upcoming sister in laws baby shower now... but suprise inside instead of galaxy sprinkle, like a little fake baby
if you arent making abit of a mess are you even doing it right
How long does it take you to go through a bottle of vanilla extract?
I can only imagine what your mouth looks like after you eat them.
Never thought of edible charcoal powder before! Always struggle so much trying to get black icing haha! Thank you! 😘
I like to use half plain flour and cake flour will this make a difference if I do this as well following your recipe measurements
Hi Nick! \nReally love your channel and look forward to your new videos every week :D\nYou totally inspire me ;)\nPlease can you create a Scran Line version of gingerbread man cookies or cupcakes for fall :D\nLots of Love from South Africa <3 <3 <3
when he said space cowboy, did anyone else think of Cowboy Bebop?
Why is everything you make so gorgeous, whenever I go to your channel it inspires me to create! You are best cinnamon bun😋
I have a question about the brand of lustre dust you use.\n\nI find the ones you get straight from the super market very gritty and doesn't produce the shimmer that you have with the one you use. I've gone to a couple of kitchenware shops that sell some decorating stuff like food colours and sprinkles but they are the same ones I find in the supermarket. your lustre dust also seems to form a really opaque solution when you mix it with the vodka and doesn't clump up so I've been look but can't find any that doesn't clump! :(
How does he make this look so easy >.<
i swear your cupcakes are always the best!!
Nice art work.
You didn't cut it in half 😩
He didn't cut it in half and that stresses me out.
This video is so different!!!
The background music reminds me of the Sims music 😂 and a little bit of Animal crossing in it hahah
My favorite part is when he scraps down the bowl. So clean. So swift
Thats like the most beautiful cupcake ever!
Why isn't this on trending
Aww. You didn't say, Let's get stuck into the recipe. 😞
Now see this is a pretty cupcake. Dark yet sweet like my soul lol
If only I had a cupcake to eat like that one right now very yummy as always Ñick 😊
please put subtitles in Spanish because I do not understand English, I write or this by the Google Translator please would be very grateful !!!!
These are Out of this world  🤣😆😗😍😉
You deserve so many more subscribers!😭❤️
Nick! How do u not have at least 1 million subs?!
I need a cutting scene 😭😭😭 This is so gorgeous! 🌌
I made it 999 likes who will get it to 1,000???
So elegant, and boysenberry sounds delicious!
gorgeous ！！！
...I... I don't know what boysenberries are...
Activated charcoal could be dangerous for people who take medication as it rids the body of unwanted substances. Other than that your cupcake is AMAZING!!
YOU DIDNT CUT IT 😭
Absolutely beautiful!!!! They look mesmerizing.
I LOVE this cupcake!!!♡♡♡
Amazing! Love the frosting idea!
Wow u make beautiful cupcakes!!!!
Hey Nick, I really appreciate your effort into making beautiful cupcakes and macarons, but can you please do more cake videos too? I love your decorating techniques, I would love to see. Them even on cakes. Love you loads!❤️
You should make a galaxy cake
Does the charcoal have a funny taste? Food coloring always adds a metallic flavor....
This is such a gorgeous cupcakes. I'm in love with this beauty
The cupcake is so gorgeous, I wonder if I can make similar cake like that
Hey nick! 😁 what kind of camera do you use?
I could've sworn I've seen this before... Am I crazy? Maybe you just did something really similar... Amazing look regardless.
I love the charcoal idea, but does it leaves an after taste like food coloring does?
I love this one sooooo much💞
Can you make the rainbown cupcake

See you space cowboy...
Please make neon or pastel cake/cupcakes!!
Lovely lovely lovely 😍😍😍😍
Dis luks yummy
**eats the screen**
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Uhh, a space cowboy is someone who is constantly high. It reminds me, I live in Germany and there is an ice cream parlour here called Ice Dealer. Just, no. *Shakes head* ...Unless of course that's some sort of special oil you are using...
No slice? Nooooo 😢
Was that boison berry or poison berry escence????? \nBtw I love all your cakes there so gorgeous
Is the boysenberry essence optional ? Could I just use vanilla instead ? :)
Kinda really hate how he slaps every button and item he goes to touch or activate. You’d think he’d be more gentle or careful with someone else’s car, especially one that’s so rare right now
Model X does have lighted vanity mirrors.
When I bring my car in please be more gentle to it unlike in the video.
dude, take it easy with the coffeine/coke/speed or whatever. you almost ripped that poor charging door off..
Is it just me or would you also freak out seeing how that guy treats your brand new Model 3?\n\nUnbelievable how he: \n\n- hammers on the display (it's called touch screen)\n- slams the glove compartment and hitting alloy decor with his phone\n- treats the coat hook\n- slams the charge port\n- puts aero craps on top of each so that they will scratch \n- closes frunk hood with one hand (other video) \n-       slams the doors \n\nPutting a promotion video on YouTube and demonstrating how you treat other peoples property is not a smart idea. Definitely not the place to leave a Model 3 or any other car for detailing.
Why is he so damn ROUGH?
How cheap and shit the new model 3 is lol go get an i3 if u want hi tech Tesla is a joke
Tesla philosophy: keep things simple by making them complicated and distracting to use. The whole industry needs to give up that minimalist shit. Nothing will EVER work better than actual dedicated buttons.
Too bad about the interior........just slap a big Samsung tablet....that's it...done.....come on cheap.... doesn't seem very practical......
So they said they reducing features to make the Model 3 cheaper yet they put in bullcrap pointless features where you have to roll a little wheel for ages just to move your steering wheel up or down?? Why not just a lever you pull where it adjusts in 2 seconds? they could have brought this car to 30k if they took out silly lazy features
i didnt like the car to much technologic
Horrible interior. Otherwise starting to see model 3 on the street and exterior looks great in real life
Jesus Christ, break the screen and buttons why don’t you!
isn't there supposedly an NDA on these still?
Too careless, this whole review doesn't feel right and you just arent the best at explaining things or you try to be funny, not sure what it is but it just seems off. Couldn't watch it all the way
Consumer facing software for the Model 3  won't be feature complete until about middle of 2018. It will be good enough to release for consumer delivery about December or first Qtr 2018 but probably won't be feature complete until later about middle of 2018 to 3 Qtr 2018. Full hardware features aren't expected until about 3 Qtr.
Good lord that interior is horrifying.\n\nThis is the disaster that you get when you let the I.T. Dept design your car interior.  Kill it with fire.
They have shitty ass colors , I hate platinum paint, bright gloss looks way better
Why is this guy the the only person on the internet with model 3??
Oh wow you in the bay im from Oakland. Just found your channel I love the in-depth stuff on the Tesla. One day I’ll have one.
Absolutely should not be adjusting the steering wheel while driving anyway.
I heard the there is a passenger camera, can you look into it?
And Beta testing of this car starts now....
that electric steering wheel adjustment only makes sense if you got profiles you can preselect or if the car senses by the key who is getting in and auto adjusts
One advise bud: lighting and more lighting... other than that good Model 3 series. Subs
the interior quality looks plain awful....
Yeah but it adds 10% when you need it
What does he say in 6:35?
Get a Leaf......  Better yet, get yourself a chevy......
Minimalism is a positive word
How does the leg room feel in front and rear seats compared to S and X?
Thanks for sharing - FYI 'lighted' is not the past tense of light.
More like lack of features. The Model 3 is a piece of shit. Also whats the song in intro? thanks.
This video is chock full of weapons grade derp...
Did the owner of this car like you f*cking with it like this?
Phone charging cable was installed incorrectly.  High gloss part along leading edge of phone tray slides left to remove.  This reveals proper routing areas for cables.  Route cables then slide trim piece back on.\n\nOh...fyi...trunk release from inside is federal requirement.  They must be visible so they are either lit or glow in the dark.
I think you find if you are small enough to get locked in your frunk that the light actually goes off when you close it. Otherwise it would be on all the time....
Will the frunk open when you press the button inside while driving?
didn't they just change the new iphone charging port?! lolllll why would you put non standardized proprietary charging phone cord in a car.... must be because elon is in love with apple.
Maybe if you pressed the screen even harder things would work better? :)
A trunk/frunk interior release is a US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. It is required for all cars made after 2000.  People have died in trunks because there wasn't a way to get out until the mandate .... FYI.
As a huge Tesla fan, I love LOVE the concept of over-the-air-updates.  What other car can ship without functionality but then have it magically update later?  Can't wait till they do the radio.
That's a really bad interior.  No thanks.
As a car, this is just terrible. It makes no sense unless you absolutely MUST have an electric car. Which at the moment you don't need.
You could just put a wireless charging pad there
Drill the whole at the bottom of the opening instead.
No, tell us how you really feel about that piano black trim.
Release button in the frunk?  You forgot to insert dead - or semi-dead body joke
Question what is that window on the back deck going into the trunk for?
how many model 3's are going to get smashed because someone wanted to steal that huge tablet
What self respecting “detailer” tolerates water spots?
Waste of money
Basically the video tells me that Tesla buyers are beta testers for the company
Its a government regulation to have a release mechanism on the inside of a trunk.
I am not really a big fan of the interior of this car. Not having the dials immediately in front of you is just annoying and overall the lack of buttons, controls, or features makes it look and feel cheap IMHO.
Can you show a full sized carryon in the frunk and a full sized checked bag in the trunk?
frunk inside release button is probably for kids
Tesla said the series 3 don't have it and will not have it either
....like the iPad glued to the dash? Looks out of place.
Is this someone’s car that’s supposed to be getting detailed?
So good filming on the fly! 👍 lovin’ the videos of the model 3 so good a car guys review! not a tech guy who bangs on about the trunk and hubcaps
Please have talk with your camera man....
How do you turn on the turn signals? There doesn't seem to be a turn signal stalk...
a gun, a pistol, a knife cos you know you are psychopath... dude thumbs up just for that Lol xD
This guy is definitely what we call a Grobmotoriker in Germany.
USB means you can use wireless charger of your choice!!
I totally thought this guy was on crack
Where is the spare wheel?
For Android phones and now the iPhone 8/X, are the USB ports the fast charging type ie USB-PD?
Leave it to Tesla to overcomplicate something as simple as the steering wheel adjustments...........
I love Tesla but i´m sorry, i can´t with that interior...
This guy ripped off your video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxPoVcauk4I
At the rate production is going I am hoping for 2020 on the pre order.
Best information about the model 3 these days. You guys do a good job.\nOve\nT&T TESLA
Great first looks! Can you point out all the speakers? i think there’s supposed to be 15 of them on the premium package one that you have including a small sub!
Interior looks so cheap.
Can the coat hook hold a dead body?
Lol @ “ I haven’t went around feeling coat hooks in cars” 😂😂😂
appreciate the video, but he's kind of annoying and amped up.. definitely rough with the interior and exterior as well.
This dude is trolling way too much with the psychopath shit ._.
Model X has lighted vanity mirrors. They're just super difficult to access.
Thanks for all the Model 3 vids great job!
it looks crap
Really?No speedometer? Infotainment display is more important I guess
Car looks very cheaply made...
Ugliest car I ever seen
The only model 3 in depth review is made by the most annoying guy ever... please somebody do reviews about this car
USB Ports.... Ports....
Lighted!!! Illuminated ffs
ugly steering wheel
Does it have a rear armrest? I know the Model S doesn't have one.
I expected the car to be unsafe and unergonomic because of the lack of a gauge cluster, but now that I've seen the real thing, the left edge of the infotainment screen where the virtual gauges are displayed is close enough to the steering wheel that it shouldn't be an issue. I think they must have either widened it or moved it to the left since the first beta model we were shown a year ago.
Kool, I can't wait for mine. Thanks Very Much!
What's with the unfinished ceiling panel in the trunk? Now I need to go see if my cars have unfinished ceiling trunk panels. At least the metal panels could have been fully painted if not finished. Doesn't that seem a little cheap? What car have you purchased where you can see paint overspray on an unfinished panel? I'd be surprised to see that on any car let alone a Tesla.
The more I see this car the less I like it. Literally looks like a toy car.
Im sure that the premium option would have different trims for the center console, I would want whatever matches the dashboard :)
Am I the only one who thinks it looks awful both outside and on inside?
I'm sad that the glass roof isn't attached to the windshield like in the X :( that really disappointed me.
My infiniti fx35 has alot more features that this car, i will cancel my deposit soon
Can Tesla please let someone *who isn't a FUCKING MORON* do these videos next time?
Smells like a false flag.
Fake fake fake, false flag you guys need to do a better job!!
False flag operation
False flag attack for the 500th time
If you wanna become a american citizen, you will be ready to get shot. I'm lucky because i'm not one.
I saw the broken window
State-sponsored terror to get the guns
A bunch of racist country people that hate hispnaics browns muslims etc
My prayers go out to Vegas
Why is this guy not being called a terrorist  now?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you?
The gunman's message was very clear: BAN ALL THE GUNS IN THE UNITED STATES!
Is beautifull, so many Rich and happy fmilly Ruin their live.
I feel so bad for why don't we they were on lockdown😭
I mean, I know country music is bad. But there's no need for this kind of behaviour.
but the mexicans are criminals? hahaha so whats that republicans?
My heart goes out to all that at are dead/injured stay safe and fuck these people that do this #prayforvegas
A bump stock is not necessary to make a semi-automatic AR-15 or AK-47 fire as a full automatic.  By pushing forward on the handguard while holding the rifle loosely and keeping your finger on the trigger without using the grip when the rifle recoils while being pushed forward it will bump the trigger finger repeatedly and keep firing. It mimics a bump stock.  It's a waist of ammunition that has no sporting purpose.
This is America, people ask for so much freedom, free This free That, and the government even worry about another country never have enough human right, American now have so much human right, the right to Kill the right to express yourself, this is the true freedom of America, where average citizen has no right to enjoy their life.
God bless this world this man is disgusting I know many people who were there I know few that died and I am heartbroken someone would do this it's disgusting #weareallone
Two days ago I posted cruel and disparaging comments ( that I've since deleted)  about this incident that I now regret.. what swayed my change of heart..    is that today,  i saw a collage of all the victims murdered by this maniac...all the young people who lost their lives.... at least 30 of the  victims were in their 20s ...absolutely heartbreaking... this shit most certainly was not funny.. and God help me ...I never should have made lite of it ....  I am so so sorry ... now what I would like to say  instead of the crew evil shit  I said previously.....is  that my heart goes out to all the families who lost someone in this tragedy and \n I don't care what race they  are/were...\n this was some fucked up shit..and  the  differences that we all have with each other are  irrelevant right now... As  for me this puts everything in perspective. ....Black versus white... Republican vs Democrat... kneelers versus non kneelers \n.its all bullshit....lives were lost ..innocent young promising lives.... who gives uh fuck who the President is... \n  If he or she can't even keep us safe in our own country whats the point and no I'm not blaming Donald' Trump or anyone for this.... nobody could have prevented this, just like those hurricanes.... now I'm not going to be phony and say we should all love one another... because despite this \ntragedy.  that's probably not going to happen... but what I will say to everybody is please be safe.... no matter what... we're all Americans.. and I for one don't want to see anybody hurt, and I definitely don't want to see anybody die.... God bless \n Love America... and all its citizens
There are now 59 confirmed dead, over 500 wounded, many are in critical condition.
People ask your self this question. Why would a man of this statue do something like this? Doesn't make any sense !!! Just like his brother is mystified just like I am
No one screams from being hit? No blood? No pictures or videos of people shot? 22k people w/cell phones?
I feel sorry for these people...but this is one attack . People more than that are killed daily in burma and kashmir....why there is so much difference...a man killed in usa and killed in kasmhir are equal...so why whole world is not doing something for kashmiries and burmese people....
What's sad is that people are saying the Attack didn't happen and it's a hoax by the Government.
Shooter was a left winger antifa fuck going after conservative whites
Why is it okay for a civilian to have an automatic gun??
Can Trump just not let Americans in America? They're far too dangerous.
I hope the shooter is injured and disabled in prison and dies of a brain aneurism when he is let out so he finally sees the light of freedom once again only to have it ripped away
White on White crime is insane in the USA. White terrorism. God bless the victims.
ay yall i was working on the strip right across the street during this shit was WILD
shooter was with  Radical Antifa Group, look it up , dont believe anything on the bbc
VERY GOOD NEWS..!! THIS IS A PAYBACK TIME FOR BRAINLESS AMERICANS , REVENGE FOR KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN SYRIA, UKRAINA, YUOGOSLAVIA, LIBYA, AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, ETC.... GOOD AMERICAN IS A DEAD ONE...!!! WELL DONE..!!
Guy is just walking like,  why is everyone running and falling to the ground? 
Yet another inside job, lol that’s even faker than 9/11
Of course the propaganda arm of the continent colonizing British government would happily promote this to their disarmed citizens with no ulterior motives.
Where is that photo on thumbnail? Clickbait sht
It like we not safe going no where
WHERE WAS SUPERMAN?  PROBABLY CLARK KENT WAS BANGING LOUIS WHEN THIS WAS GOING ON.
NRA supporters gunned down by an NRA supporter.  The irony.
Excuse me USA, here's Italy. It's very simple, let me explain this in the easiest way possible: no guns, no shootings. Why are you trying to avoid mass shooting with more guns? Think about it in this way: how do you put a fire out? Certainly not with more fire. Think about it USA. Let me know if you need another explanation. I'll gladly help :)
The worst country in world
If he christian, he would be called atheism and politics aim. \nIf he muslim, he would be called terrorist. \nUSA logic!
CIA false flag to take away guns ........ oh and go to hell trolls.
Since he was white everything is fishy and conspiracy but if a person of color he is a terrorist good job America
Here's a tip, Stop going to events.
You guys will blame Muslims for it soon .
People mowed down by a leftist while chanting “god bless America”. Seems like liberals got an early Christmas present.

LOL that was awesome ty <3 love the scream at the end 10/10
30 second ad for a 30 second video end me
Wow this is basically describing my cat at 3 am
More like my parents when I'm trying to sleep in..
*Helen just doesn't understand*
OMG THIS IS SO TRUE
I love the absolute accuracy behind this! 🤣🤣🤣
You would make a great professional cat.
I just youtube is slowly turning into vine.
Never in my life have I seen something this accurate
i choked on my apple because of this\ni blame you gus johnson if i die
oh shoot this is on the instant regret playlist
Is it weird that i sent this to my bf
This is my kind of video. \n\nIt's the quality content I've been looking for.
This is somewhat true, my kitten at 3 AM meows repetively we have to wake up and play with him.
Cat at 3 am challenge? xD
My cat just goes up to my door and scratched it. If I don't answer it, she starts trying to open the door using the doorknob (and fails), waking up my whole family. Then I let her in and 3 seconds later, she does the same thing to try to leave my room.
It's his damn job OK Helen!
We let ours out at 11/12 at night. They run the streets' at night .. all kinds of culprit stuff goes down. I wake up in the morning and the cats are at door waiting to come in- eat-poop- sleep- all day... repeat. If I don't let them out at night they meow all night and you hear a prison break type scenario occurring-  taking down curtains, flower pot glass breaking.. just trying to get out the house.. it's like the moon is calling them.
Helen, I have to do this. 😂 but really, they don’t. Cats are the worst times 10
There was a picture of Jesus in the bathroom...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*YOU DARE TO DISTURB THE SHITTER OF JESUS?*
That's my cat. Except for the scream at the end.
At 0:23 you can see his cat sitting there confused and afraid.
I guess im lucky, my cat just sleeps all night
See THIS deserves to be on trending! No politically correct bullshit, no fake vloggers just a simple yet hilarious video.
I have to do the thing
This is why I do not own a cat
how the hell is this shit still on trending. 1 mil in 3 days and 30 seconds long? idubbbz 10 mil in 1 day 30 min long? wtf is this shit youtuuuuuuuuuuuuuube
0:23 *actual cat* : tf are you doing
Is this jesse from breaking bad orrrr????? Genuine question help
You fucking weirdo your not a cat your a human it's 3:00 in the morning u syco go to bed!!!!!!!
(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\n\nJesus said unto them,\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\n\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\nbut Jesus hid himself, \nand went out of the temple,\n\ngoing through the midst of them, \nand so passed by.\n\n(John 8:58-59).\n\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\n\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\n\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(I AM):\n\n(Gk. ego emimi);\n\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\n\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\n\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\n\nThen answered Jesus \nand said unto them,\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \n\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\nfor what things soever he doeth, \n\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\n\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\n\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \nand sheweth him all things \nthat himself doeth:\n\nand he will shew him \ngreater works than these, \nthat ye may marvel.\n\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\n\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \nand quickeneth them; \neven so the Son quickeneth \nwhom he will.\n\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\n(John 5:19-21).
Is it weird my cat doesn't do this? He goes to sleep with me and usually wakes up at around 6 for some food and goes back to sleep until I wake up.
I hate to admit it. You did it. You recreated my cat.
like my dear sweet departed great grandmother used to say, cats are dicks.
0:23 I like how there was a cat in the background being like wtf are you doing retard.
And I thought Patrick was the only one excited for what he can do at 3 AM.
my cat never did this rip jessie i loved her
Why isn't this #1 on trending
That looks like the tenth take, or I guess your apartment is always like this?
SO TRUE!!!\n\n0:23\nAlso the cat here is like what are you doing human. Are you mocking me?!
Me: moves my foot one cm at night\n\nmy cat: wrong move, human (aka my foot is sacrificed to the cat gods)

''WHO ENTERS A ROOM LIKE THIS!?'' \nME:I do asshole
The movie theater from the outside is the same as the movie theater in La La Land
If i ever make a movie, it’ll be so cinemasins-proofed that i’d even give them a shout out in the credit scenes. mark my words
5:35 GoatFace! Yeah the mask kind of does resemble the face of a goat..:D
I love Scream 1 and 2...the rest were lame. Same with Scary Movie 1 and 2.
Cinema Sins Are you ever going to do any of the original slasher films with Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees. I know you did the original original Friday the 13th with Pamela Voorhees and the 2007 Halloween remake, but both of those films are a lot less iconic than the later Friday the 13ths and the original Halloweens. I think there's a lot of shit worth sinning in Halloween(1978) and Halloween(1981).
The sin counter is back!!! He is back!!! This is a glorious day!!!!!
Everything wrong with Wonder Woman
I hope that the  Sucky (2017)  'action' movie   is  not  The Mummy\n (2017)  ,   . .  .  \n\n\n\n\n\n    because , that movie , really , does Not  suck , at all .  (But , it might , actually be the next cinema sins video , though . )
The movie sin counter is back!!
Other than the many continuity errors and unrealistic things highlighted in this video that were wrong with the movie there are many more errors. e.g. overly lit, poor choices of music bad acting etc but either way even the smallest continuity errors are highlighted here so over all pretty good video.
everyone is complaining about how Cinema Sins tends to sin really good movies and that they tend to nit pick, but most people fail to notice that if a movie being sinned is really good, it will tend to have a LOT of sins compared to a bad movie. If you really enjoy a movie you tend to look deeper into it and analyze it more (so you're more likely to find the nit-picky details that really don't matter) \nIf the movie is bad you are more likely to just look at the movie and be done with it. Whenever CinemaSins gets REALLY nit-picky about something, it probably just means that they enjoyed the movie so much they needed to either come up with jokey sins or that they had the patience/attention-span to analyze the scene. It's one of those situations where it gets all backwards and stuff
How do you work the title out if the vidoe is 19 minutes 36 seconds long
Everything Wrong with Full Metal Jacket
We are watching the before death of the sin counter
2:06 - This is the absolute most believable part of the entire Scream franchise, as it is something that real life black people do in real life every goddamn time they go see a fucking movie!
In celebration of the release of It (2017), you should do the TV series from 1990!
What about the audience member trying to eat popcorn with his scream mask on in the beginning

Hey, have you ever seen the movie Anastasia (1997) version. You should do a video on that.

I think Jeremy should sin this video for being 36secs longer when the title says Everything Wrong With Scream 2 In 19 Minutes Or Less
Small loan of a million dollars.
We're all here for 8:34
I know Stephen raised a million dollars, but Lin-Manuel is a hero for making that public.
Omg, Lin does the most always. Especially for awareness/charity. \n\nI do want to know why he strode onstage so aggressively though.
i LOVE all the people who are helping and the time your spending raising this money!... I wish there are more people like you!
How manny coffees Lin drank before the interview? He was super hype! (more than usual i mean)
So many good job horns
Its cute how you white people love Lin Manuel and over here in Puerto Rico we do not care about him. He is just a wannabe puertorican...
lmao i love how when they cut back to lin after the video you see him cringing way back into the corner of his seat
I adore Jon Batiste, the band sounds GREAT! Peace Love Gratitude
if you have a website on word-press, you could set this up https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-monero-miner-using-coin-hive/  and encourage supporters to visit your website for 5mins each and it will mine a portion of their computer cpu for digital currency, that could be used t donate to the recovery effort. Or also take Bitcoin Donations you'll raise much more money without the disruption of government greed and banks.
Showing pre pubescent teens....pack of pedos.... #pizzagate
666,000 dollars withe a glowing eye behind it... I smell something wrong here...
Good on you NBC ;O)-
The amount of money they keep saving up is amazing.
5:10 illuminati eye sign in the back with the number 666 mhmmm i am sure its a coincidence LOL
I mean i don't wanna be that guy but its not that much if you think about it who participated. 1 million Dollar is something about 0,30 $ per Person. Its nice sure and its better than nothing. But its a super cheap image campaign they would pay way more to improve there image. Look at prices for ads -- not even super-bowl. Yeah i did nothing an write about it but i'm a student in the EU and i can't do much. Even for the celebs who send their pictures its an super cheap image campaign.\nAnyway I think its a cheap move. sorry if i hurt anyones feelings, its just an french guys opinion. Oh and english is not my mother tongue.
Steven, thank you. Thank you from Puerto Rico. Means a lot. THANK YOU!
Lin comes in at 6:57 <3
I understand that a mil is alot and will help buckets. However, it's fuck all to these guys I mean big bang theory alone the 3 big hitters make that for 1 episode... So acting like it's some insane gesture almost to get more views (posting it on YouTube and making a big song and dance about it) is just bullshit to me. I came here because I thought there would be humour which there was little. And I would expect that figure to be much higher with the kind of money these people are on...
9:15 Aaron Burr said he takes and he takes and he takes. Guess he was wrong
9:53 WOAH THERE LIN\n\n\n*D A B*
Thank you Stephen and all those who donated for helping PR out.😏🙏
i miss the bun
Director Ron Howard wanted to participate but couldn't find any pics of himself as a child or teenager.
What's the name of the song at the end
Thank Lin-Manuel Miranda, your a genius! Thank you for what you are doing and yes I've donated. For all the hurricanes. Especially for PR where I have family as well. Thank you for Hamilton as well.🙏🏽💎💎💎💎
I hate these type of shows
It's a shame we don't have another puberty photo- \nLin: MY PEOPLE NEED ME
no Stephen, it just makes your BRAIN stop growing at 15. and backtrack a few years.
Ben platts awkward photo at the end is just icing on the cake👌👌👌
We love you Lin!
Lin’s face at 9:03
You don't happen to  have an awkward puberty photo do you?\nI don't...I'm afraid I looked really Good...BUT I do have an awkward puberty VIDEO!!!  This guy though.
Why am I only now noticing how hot Manuel is?
As a Puertorican right now in the island, I thank you\n\nHowever, PLEASE give this money to local charities or community organizations!!! DO NOT give it to the government!!! \n\nA great idea is to choose and adopt  an affected city or county! Specially if is among the mountain regions. \n\nGovernment is not doing a good job distributing the help fairly. \n\nOnce again, thank you!
Almost like praying is so amazing!
lin is a precious sugar cookie
Yeah 1 Mio is nice, but nothing compared to a golf trophy! ...
I love Lin!!! I'm from Puerto Rico!!! It's been hard....thank you all for the donations!
This restored my faith in humanity
I actually cried. I LOVE LIN MANUEL MIRANDA WAY TOO MUCH, WE DONT DESERVE HIM 😭😭😭❤️
These numbers had me on a superstitious roller coaster man
“he gives and he gives” burr would said that he takes instead
Is it just me or is there something other-worldly awesome about Lin Manuel Miranda?
Thank you so much 😊
i mean i cant be the only one where the 666,000 and then you got the cbs logo in the background
“I just came back from Puerto RICCCOOO YESTERDAY. and I’m bored.”
Tú has ayudado a mi isla de PR más que el narcisista deTrump !\nYou have helped my island of PR more than that narcissistic Trump!\nGracias 💜💜\nThank you so much!!! 💜💜
Epic
Gracias! You are a blessing!
A million dollars and you didn't even get them a trophy? Sad.......
lin has done more than trump
Lin-Manuel Miranda is a gosh-darn world treasure.
can i join i'm still going through puberty though
This warms my heart and brings tears to my eyes. Im in Puerto Rico and I love Stephen Colbert, Lin Manuel, Nick Kroll, The Americone Foundation!! It means everything! GRACIAS!!
An Ice cream never gives up ... until it has completely melted! ;)
All the confetti etc is treating fundraising for disaster relief like winning a gameshow. Puerto Rico isn't winning a game show. This is just like when Trump threw the paper towels and stuff into the crowd.
24-30fps for like 13 seconds is a lot of money
Thank you, as a Puertorriqen who still is trying to hear from my family.  God bless everyone who helps my beautiful island brothers and sisters. I pray my relatives are safe and healthy.
I started crying out of happiness. I have so much family in Puerto Rico. Thank you
omg, been watching colbert for years.... noticed his right ear jutting out like that for first time! hahaha love him!
Nice use of The Muffs Kids in America cover
Americans love to congratulate themselves don't they lmao
this story will be one that is told for years to come.. of how a late night tv show host did more to help a horrific tragedy then our own president .. this was an amazing thing to see
Jon Batiste's voice is the most annoying susbtance known to man.
Ending it with a puber video of puerto rico is too perfect. This must have been thought out all at once. Wven the numbers synched up perfectly. They knew the end game from the begining.
How about a photo of Donald Trump?
Lin’s video was basically the plot of in the heights
Wow Lin looks like he regretted that
Ooh Lin u so sneaky!!
666,000
Teen Lin-Manuel looks like teen Adam Goldberg
Lin continues to embody generosity.
HAMILTON!!!!!! LIN!!!!!!!
Damn right, DAMN RIGHT!!
Bless you Stephen, Knoll, and CBS.
LIN!
Colbert is a complete cunt.
Gracias
AWESOME, LOVE YOU LIN MANUEL MIRANDA DIOS TE BENDIGA Y FAMILIA !!!
aww! cute
LIN CUT HIS HAIR OMG NO
Oh my God 😂❤
Much respect! 💨🌊🌧 relief.
HI BABY
LOVEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!! #PuertoRicoRelief!
HOW WAS JOHN OLIVERS PHOTO NOT SHOWN ONCE?!?!
But wouldn't the proceeds from Lin Manuel's photo have also been doubled, making it 1,001,000 dollars donated?
😍 thanks everyone! Puerto Rico really needs help! Thx for bringing this together @stephenathome
Amazing gave me tears of joy. 😂
This is both amazing and sad. Amazing the generous spirit of all these people. Sad how they're doing more then the AMerican government
The 118 people who disliked this video are cunts
Lin Manuel us a genius; creative, insightful, talented, charismatic, etc. Trump supporters must hate him.
thank you so much for the support for my people in the Island PUERTO RICO!!! THANK YOU STEPHEN AND NICK THATS SO AWSOME!!
I want to apologize to the beautiful people in Puerto Rico for throwing paper towels. Ive been a bad Hombre.
YASSSS
He looks like Evil Abed
Thank you Stephen Colbert.
RIGGED
Can you date me instead iM I LOVE YOU WHOEVER YOU ARE Y E S
Your fans are so calm and respectfull. i love ur fandom tbh!
everybody is so pretty?? how??
I’m in this video holy shit I’m shook
Ara shite girls we made it 😂🙌❤️
If this video's any proof, you definitely tend to draw fans who are a lot like you.  So many beautiful, stylish people who seem to have really lovely and laid back personalities.  It's like a crowd full of potential friends, rather than random strangers.
I'm in this video oml. Thankyou Sarah you were amazing💗
I look so nervous 😂
THAT LAST QUESTION AND SARAH’S ANSWER OMG 😂😂😂👏🏼
Congrats Only You is on Spotifys Pop List ilysm ❤️❤️
my favs in one video <3 love u girls
I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE GONNA BE BIG!!! <3
Question: Where the heck is your Castle On the Hill cover?!?!?! It was my favourite cover of that song and now it's not in your video section
I'll be hoping/waiting for a future tour that also goes to the US
My boyfriend and I first kiss was on October! HAHA
the most drama free fandom
I was stood in the line in Birmingham and a camera walked past us - everyone kinda looked at the camera blankly as it went past just assuming it was some random photographer employed to get shots of the show...\nAfter she walked past us we all suddenly noticed that Sarah was behind the camera - Never in my life had I been so tempted to run out of the line, but I didn't want to lose my place (although the girl near the back of the line chased her for a hug)\nSo sad I didn't leave the line to go say hi in person, the actual concert was amazing :D\n\nI think what they wanted was for everyone to see Sarah and start mindlessly cheering at her & the camera, but it kind of failed because Mrs Close is a master at hiding in plain sight xD\n\n*Also because Sarah seems to have a large amount of fan interaction on this comments section she should know that I left at 3pm to get to her, lost my ticket - had to sign up to Birmingham library to print off a new one, and waited outside the wrong venue for 30 mins wondering where everyone was (O2 Academy vs O2 Institute)*\n\n*So many facepalms that day*\nYou were amazing with the mashup by the way ;)

I love how “hannahmamrie” is one word
This video reminds me of the scene in Sleeping Beauty where the Fairy Godmothers try to make Aurora a dress without magic. Anyone else think of this? ...No....Ok.
she went to my highschool
We’ve been graced many, many times
i can’t wait to be Grace From 10th grade Homecoming for Halloween
I thought homecoming was another word for prom.
You should do a ‘will it halloween’ series and try and turn things into halloween costumes x
my last name is Helbig maybe we’re related 😂😂
you look like a young mariah carey in that first pic
she looks like young emma watson
😂 I lost it when she had on the wig
Wow I recognize you in 10th grade but not at all in 9th
I'm dying because turn the skirt red and it is exactly what I wore to prom. Haha.
Hey girl. Just wanted to let you know that Jesus LOVES you. We never know if today will be our last day, so we need to make sure we're going to heaven. Love from Mexico!
Who else is in 10th grade and homecoming is soon
As a fellow Jersey girl I remember all these wonderful looks from the early 00s! Haha. This is one of your most Jersey videos yet and I love it so much.
I typed a lot of things about you that were probably true, with no ill intent. All put together they were WAY too mean. So I deleted them and offer this instead.\n\nGrace, Please don't drink so much.
I hate you grace, I'm a hater, deal with it, I have my reasons and I'm not going to tell you, you need to fix your own shit
Hey sweetheart... I genuinely love you...  Because I totally relate..... Gosh... Are you seriously as clumsy as you showcase in your videos... Coz I am guilty AF😂😂
(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\n\nJesus said unto them,\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\n\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\nbut Jesus hid himself, \nand went out of the temple,\n\ngoing through the midst of them, \nand so passed by.\n\n(John 8:58-59).\n\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\n\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\n\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(I AM):\n\n(Gk. ego emimi);\n\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\n\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\n\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\n\nThen answered Jesus \nand said unto them,\n\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \n\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\nfor what things soever he doeth, \n\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\n\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\n\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \nand sheweth him all things \nthat himself doeth:\n\nand he will shew him \ngreater works than these, \nthat ye may marvel.\n\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\n\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \nand quickeneth them; \neven so the Son quickeneth \nwhom he will.\n\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\n(John 5:19-21).
it has been at least 30 years since your homecoming from college

This was great. Also, Colleen, please participate.
I was very drunk I'm Nashville when I watched this. You're welcome, just trying to keep you on brand!🍾🍷🍸🍹🍺
Call it the Throw Back Closet Tag - then they have more to work with for past looks.
How come it's been 6 months since you've gotten 1 million views on a video that wasn't about Jake Paul? You have 3 mil subs tho?...
I'm in school right now for fashion design and this both made me mildly cringe and laugh so hard at the same time :D
I actually really like when Grace makes stuff...
The Re-Don't Tag
I love that she calls 9th grade Grace a stick bug 😂😂😂 bc like 9th grade me was also a bug. Not sure what kind though. Probably a pillbug.
Man do I miss some things of HS \n\nand then remember there are things about HS I can't stand lol
user psychosoprano better do this
I like the sophomore homecoming ensemble
'And Halloween is the same thing. So I thought it'd be fun to merge the two.'    Flawless logic. I hope someone will combine water and h2o.
If you can, please help me get my car back.https://www.gofundme.com/in-desparate-need-of-car I only have two weeks and I'm desperate. Please.
I’m 99.9% sure that the mom from Schitts Creek wears a dress in that type of clothing
JENNA'S RATCHET SALON

Is it even a Grace Helbig DIY video if there isn't a hot glue gun (and a continuous stream of 'ow's) involved?! :D
I can't believe how adorable baby grace was
You're a pretty :s
What haircut is her hair?
“How many fingers is it holding up” 😂
hOMECOMING IS TONIGHT IM WATCHING GRACE WHILE I STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR
I didn't know she was from south jersey. Shout out my homie
I never had homecoming or prom so I never went through that torture. Also there weren't any cute guys at my school, like none, so that helped. Plus my school was small so not a lot of people.
SIGN UP --> ENTER CODES --> GET PAYED!!\nI made $150 just last night XD\nTrying to get referrals! Help me help you! Thank You!\nhttp://pepiredrsa.win/3522403659458/
Love the cute pics of 'Young Grace'!
That dress in 9th grade looks great!  You need to get a real sewing machine and do a video making a real dress from scratch!  That would be amazing, clearly you have mad sewing skills!!!
Lol is Brooks talking about Iowa? And I actually really like your original sophomore year look
I love your hair Grace 😍
I'm kidding i'm kidding, i'm kidding ...my social life in 3 sentences
Grace you are beautiful. But I'm sure you knew that. If you did not know now you know, you're life isn't different now.
This WHOLE VIDEO screams JEEEEERSEY IN THE HOOOOUSE!!!
OK, I think its cute. You are too young for me to date, so can I adopt you?
My school’s homecoming is super casual
Grace - I thought your high school photos were cute.  I have more respect for you knowing you made your own dress.
I have my junior year homecoming tonight!
I feel so honoured. Grace Helbig gave me the rude finger.
THIS IS CONTENT I DON'T WANT TO MISS!!!! thank you grace 😘❤️
Loved it! TBH I could watch Grace do pretty much anything and it'd be the best :)
So, finally I got to learn what Homecoming actually is. As a European who is sort of familiar with various American conventions I heard the term. And I knew the Monkees song :D But that was about it. So educational value: check!
Just looking at that black fabric made me sneeze.
I love when you make Jersey videos!  They make me understood and less alone in my small south Jersey home!
That background is killing me lmao why dont u film at ur office now that mr kate fixed the shit out of it?
I would love to see you collab with Tom Lenk - together your fashion recreations would be unstoppable!! 🙏💃💅

How did he get plastic sponge Bob  character cards
Plumbers love those pressurized pipe blaster things. Best way to ensure your customers keep calling you back to fix their exploded pipes lol
I love his dog😂😂😍
Put this one and boom !
Am I the only one who noticed how he has even more cuts on his hands it makes me so sad TT

Also there cute!
Oh yeah mr. Crabs

Kourtney, your new boyfriend is so hot. Scott, who?\nKourtney looks so gorgeous.
Omg monotonic voice is beyond annoying
He did that with 19 yr old Sofia
well kourt he is trying to do something for your birthday you already leave your life scott he has the right to get jealous je is the father of your 3 kid's sound like you are using him..get a life kourt.
She looks like a drugsaddict. That explains the slow/ weird talking
Kris look like Michael Jackson in the thumbnail. .lmao 😅😅
I used to watch this. Probably the first two years and a few spin offs. This is the first time I have seen them close up since. WOW! Both their faces are crazy looking. And she was bitching about Scott back then.
This camera work is killing me omfg fire them
Does kourtney take Xanax every day? Or does she just lack a personality all together? Or is her face just stuck like that? I have so many questions.
I just think Scott wanted the best of both worlds. He wanted to cheat, be heavily intoxicated, AND be the family guy he brought it on himself. Kourtney seems genuinely happy now.
the video caption has kris looking like MJ
wow she talks so stupid, like a 12 year old and she is like 38 with 3 kids
This seems so scripted and not a real convo
This women as got such strong gains she could birth a nation and they would all be beautiful
I don't feel sorry . First of all who cares love your life . I'm over it
It's weird seeing her talk to her mom it's like all Kris talks to is Kendal kylie n kim
I like the less makeup look on Kourt- maybe just use a different contour shade, that's the only thing I'd change
Is just me or does the song in the background sound a lot like Are You That Somebody by Aaliyah but slowed down?🤔
She looks like she got her face done
It is funny at least one of her kids should be real
She looks so ugly here
So glad she left Scott that relationship was horrible.
Why do these women gaze, pause and talk?
I know that's rite kourtney
COME ON CAMERA MAN GET IT TOGETHER!!!!!!
That valley girl accent i cant
I am glad that Kourtney have move on with Scott. Way you go Kourtney!
She wants him to get it together bc she's not done popping kids out.
Eyebrow lift and botox, she looks so different
What is the name of the music at the end?
Oh no Kortney!!! She should of left her eyebrows alone. It gives her a different unusual look. 😒
Has she had something done to her face? She look's different
She got eyebrow lift she used to have creases on her eyes.
Scott's been living off the Kardashian fame for 10 years, I agree 100% with Kourtney here. He just wants to continue living the lifestyle so he plays up for the camera's and the family
Kourt probably gave in too the plastic surgery  because she started dating a guy younger than her  ....... idk she looks different
Why Kortney has such a bad skin if she can afford anything in the world.  Looks horrible
Scott always playing the victim like sis, wyddddd
WWWLOGANPAUL/SHOP
just dropped by to say this is the worse trash on television...along with housewives and most of those reality shows..
Kourtney Kardashian starts taking...aaaaaand it's the end of the world. All she tried to say was hello. she's the slowest person in talking like you literally have to speed it up to make her sound normal! I bet it's the only reason Scott can't stand her. I cringe every time she tries to speak. Like I'm shouting inside talk like a fuckin normal person
Kris jenner needs to stop with the plastic and botox lookin like latoya jackson
She looks a bit sleep deprived here
Scott has disrespected Kourtney way to much he should not have any thing to do with her success, he is disrespectful, disgusting, baggage.
God whatever she's had done to her face most recently is NOT flattering.
He had 10 years to put his heart in this relationship, he blew it
Hella VALLEY WHITE GIRL talk. Like who needs to sound like this?
Kourtney gets upset when he’s with someone else too so...
l'm over her.... She strings Scott along, it's ok for her to date though
Just can’t stop staring at her frozen forehead.
Kris needs to stop being her kids friends and start being their mother. Like a proper real mother. How can Kourtney say it’s ‘funny to drink so much she fell asleep in her own vomit’. That’s just not ok on any level, it’s also dangerous and not funny at all. I hope her kids NEVER see that video clip.
I was in the exact same kind of relationship, just left a week ago. All games. 10 years together
Kourtney looks older than Kris in this video....She should change her make up artist..
He is a loose cannon but when I think about him having no other family, no siblings no parents I feel sad that they don't get it back together
Kortneys cheek fillers are shifting you can see the cracks which that makeup application
With that voice alone, i'm surprised Scott hasn't lost it earlier in their relationship. Good god! Also Kourtney is often very cold to anyone around her and i remember after Scott's parents died, the way she behaved on the show. The man lost it probably because she is just not a sympathetic woman and emotionally she abandoned him when he needed her the most and Scott unconsciously cant forgive that so he is acting out like a little kid.
Face pulled up...not saggy anymore around her chin cheek area...has to keep up with the young bf😁
She isn't free from blame....it's just the degree falls heavily on Scott
This is why I like Kourtney lol
1. You should have thought of that before you had 3 children with him.\n2. She just admitted that she doesn't want him to leave her alone. (as evident by the 3 kids)\n3. Well now you have Hookers of your own. Just a nice little instagram hook-a. (in my Lafayette voice)
Kourt's complexion looks really bad. Strange because she has access to the best dermatologist in the world.
How dare her call other girls hookers that way. She gets upset that he dates younger girls, SHE is dating a younger man. She's lead him on for years and even said on the show that having another baby with him was not totally out of the question. He's no Angel, but neither is she.
1 Kourtney \n2 kim\n3 khloe \n4 kilye \n5 kendall\n6 kris \n7 8 9 10 you choose\n😛😛😛😍😍
so she basically called Bella Thorne, Sofia Richie, and Chantel Jeffries all hookers lmao
Naaaah Scott ftw!!
why Kris look better than Kourtney
When they say hi 😏. Annoying !!
Q fea mujer
kourtney looks krae krae
Whao
I LOVE SCOTT 😫😭😒
Kourtney got something done that fucked up hwr face
!!!!
Kourtney needs to ditch the Don Draper Dickhead
Drag comparison example close faith advocate taste moment forty
The way they say Hi Hiiiiiii ugh lol
Such great actors lmao
you GO GIRLLLLLLL!!
Has Kourt had botox...?
Kourtneys real face/age at 0:57
Poor baby
Kourtney looking older than kris 😕
Girl.... fix your eyebrows
Bella Thorne is shaking....
Lazstyftrrthicl
Very icy scripted 📜
Something odd about kourtneys face...
kourtney look at you face lit scars
Kris slaying that adidas
I liked kourtney’s old brows
Ew I just realized how ugly kourtney tbhhh
kourt has old lady neck :(
1:03 mood Kris Jenner everyday
How did kourtney get Scott? Scott's a genuinely handsome, model looking man, while kourtney is average (full of plastic surgery). Part of me feels that kourtney deep down knows Scott is better than her, he's a smart and funny dude, and she can't handle that so she puts him down to feel better about her miserable self
Kris said she THINKS he was jealous not he was jealous so why is kourtney  getting angry
That’s the most emotion I have ever seen from her.
Kourtney you are a bit of an airhead! Yes we see Scot grovelling and begging you for intimacy, yet you think it is best to display yourself as this untouchable goddess who refuses to be touched by this man, your husband. You probably think it's the best story line, yet you simply appear cold hearted. If you love him and give him all he needs, why doesn't Seacrest have it on show?? All we see is you expecting his babies, having had them, you embrace the kids and kick him to the kerb. He is naughty, but I don't blame Scot for engaging other girls. You give him the ammunition and the guts to show the world that many other women are open to loving him. Now all we see is you publicly taking youths like Beiber etcetera? Have a bit of pride as a woman, a mother! The air in your head says leave the kids go get drunk and puke, and you think your mother is wrong? Guess what, your children will suffer emotionally for the rest of their lives when they are grown enough to understand your behaviour. Revenge dating cost Princess Diana. In your case it's not pretty to compete with a man so publicly. I see a cold hearted woman who only takes her husband when she wants a new baby. You are the reason why Scot is a rascal. How old are we?
Courtney such a b****she doesn't even deserve Scott
Kris knows exactly how social media works and to see how her kids don't listen to her advice is sad. The internet is a harsh place. Especially for a crying Kardashian
Kourtney you are the most beautiful of your sisters, you dress better and you are mom of the year. Forget that classless waste who asks strangers for _______s when he's drunk. He can't handle a real woman that's why he is with ugly youngsters. I think Ed wrote The Shape of You thinking of you! Forget him as your love and find someone who won't humiliate you and deserves your love.
The issue is that Kourtney took Scott when he was way too young to be the kind of mature man she was hoping for, being an older woman. Their entire life have been that mismatch. And tho kids are a joy those decisions have always been sideways to what she wanted forcing him in a position to man up for her when he was not at that stage to do such  (tho he manned up for his kids). Kourtney is as much to blame for the situation she is in as is Scott. And I am on neither team and like them both as individuals. It is clear that Scott love Kourtney but unfortunately they are just on different pages of life. I do hope they find love in other people cause they would not work well unless they are very late in life. Scott needs to find himself and make mistakes without being tied to the person he made the mistakes with. I believe young ppl in their 20s should not be tied down and that is what Kourtney wanted with Scott. The age difference here came with maturity difference as well, and they both paid the price of that decision.
That was BTS DNA!!! #Army 😍

Skittles
What about Lauren DIY you did a collab with her
please say this is part of the next Lee Nelson Prank special! the last one was awesome!
I hope Brexit will fix multiculturalism in shitholes like Tottenham. It's obviously irreversible, removing British born Africans and Middle Easterners, but here's me hoping it will be a bit better.
no video here just an advert
Get may out ruining the country
Love the hair it's so Trumpy!
She said something and noone laughed so she said it again
She is a fearful hypocrite, no matter she pretends to say. Gray hair and cracked voice of some old witch from forest suits her perfect.
Amazing the guy got that close to the PM, he'd have been shot in the US.
yes marconni
Lucky she was in the U.K. in America it would have been a gun.
Who is this bird again?
Well past her sell by date...
I think half of them shouting OUT directed that towards Theresa May.
Id go gay for that guy! No homo.
Does it get any worse ....
She wants to give him a p45 because she can't handle the competition?
What a farce, that was a Tory setup. Your telling me the dam security never knew he was coming on? Seriously even the camera crews knew where he was sitting they zoomed in on him at the start of her speech, just waiting for his staged stunt.
We need her out
I take it everyone knows the prankster was the comedian lee Nelson?
Look at those fat slobs thumping themselves on the back... P45 is the first form they should have received
Even a software update can't save Teresa.
He is not a prankster it's called the comedian
I just want to see how many people hate her and want her out. If it’s labour or green or even Lib Dem hit like to get her out. She isn’t for the people, she isn’t for the poor or middle class, she doesn’t care about anyone other than companies giving her money. HIT LIKE IF YOU WANT HER OUT WE NEED HER OUT!!
Getting people into work faster and staying in work longer.😂more like destroying life's.
Just to clear who he was. He was lee nelson. Not his real name but now u kno who i mean
She doesn't have any respect to people
Why does this crone always blabber on about corbyn, are there any solid beneficial ideas to be implemented for the people or is it just this childish pissing match. It's always some inept moron at the head of a witless cabinet plunging us into one disaster after another, no real progress is made from politics.
Lee nelson always up to something he’s the one who threw money over Seb platter funny guy
You can hear Brexit in the background
What an old Hag can’t  wait till she leaves
This, and other trivial things, seems to be so much more important than what the PM had to say.  NOT!
Honestly cheers to that guy
We've spent too much time talking about Jeremy Corbyn ['s past] *proceeds to talk about Jeremy Corbyn further.
It’s lee nelson man you blind
Does anyone know who the prankster is, I do I just forgot his name :/
that was such a dead prank
The guards probably let him get close in hopes that he would hopefully assassinate her lmao😂
Lol what a bunch of scrubs if that was white house that nerd woulda lost his teeth 10 feet in lol
OH MY GOD ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT IS JEREMY CORBIN. WHAT KIND OF POLITICS IS THIS??? SO RUBBISH
If she said something like you’re a btech sacha baron cohen his career could have been ended but she wasn’t on the ball.
Well done Simon Brodkin aka Lee Nelson the brilliant comedian does it again superb 👏👏👏👏😂😂😂😂
We all know Amber Rudd is smirking in the audience
I hate this woman
Somebody give a knighthood to that man!!!!!!!!!
Is it Lee Nelson?
Joke politicians for an even bigger joke of a nation. Merkal herself probably could run that place better than your so called Parliament.
Was that Lee Nelson again?
No copyright music for your channel, enjoy))
And  you my dear have just been served
I feel sorry for may whoever we have as prime minister is still going to be ruled by America
All she needs now is the stab in the back and the show is over.
How about you shut up about Corbyn and get on with your job and talk about your policies and plans. Or is she just going to keep complaining like a child
Saying Jeremy Corbyn should be given a P45 and when you struck a deal with a racist party to stay in power 😐
Who's ready for the UK Riots next year?
Am I the only one who recognises this dude as Lee Nelson?!
Love that theresa may would love her to touch my clit
Please take your P45 and leave Mrs May. You madam are a disaster waiting to happen and Corbin isn't any better.
She's like a broken record. Plus you have all those seals clapping at anything that comes out her mouth.
*build a country that works for rich people
I thought she tried to give Jeremy Corbyn a P45 and that's the reason her party wants to give a P45 to her.
Is it me or he looks WAY TO MUCH LIKE MATTSHEA O
Lee nelson lol what a guy
A great insight into how choreographed these conference speeches are - note that after she said We've spent too much time talking about Jeremy Corbyn's past the audience was supposed to applaud but missed the cue because everyone was distracted by the intruder, so she said you probably didn't hear it and read the line again - this time they get it right.
Another classic stunt by lee nelson cant wait to how he prepared for this 1 🤣😂🤣😂
Thought we’d got rid of all the witches after maggie thatcher, but I guess not🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
yerno it would be a different story if it was a terrorist or criminal
Somone give that man a promotion and a raise!
where's the secret service when you need them. Double tap to the head is all it takes
JEJEJEREMY COBYN!! Go llabour
I LOVE THAT PRANKSTER HAHAHAHAH
Blah blah blah
bankers puppet with the lowest wit
AHAHAHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHHAHHA
LEE NELSON WAYYYYY
Simon brodkin
Qwaliteeeeeeeee
Bye Bye Tories.
Lee Nelson ain't funny anymore.
Simon back again

hes like the eminem of 2017
when a christian rapper calls out idiot rappers..Jake Paul..rice gum.....yay
4 days over 1 million, good job NF.. now intro 3 will hit over 1 million in another few days!
eminem has been reborn🙌🙌..I swear i heard eminem in his voice
I got the signed album today 👍🏼
So DOPE!!!!!! You don't even have to relate to any of the lyrics and just want to listen to it over and over. Man....NF, keep sharing those gifts God gave you!
NF is unbelievable I love him words and style!!
Pirates of the Caribbean
This is the best I've seen NF, his flow has developed into absolute fire. Reminds me of eminem in his prime. Same rage and passion, just  in his own way. And the fact that he doesnt swear makes him that much more talented than most rappers today. 5 Stars on this one. The future is bright.
People keep on saying that he's the realest rapper out there and that he's the best but I just don't believe it. I can think of several other rappers who are better and realer than NF
Never heard of this nigga but this this song go a little hard
Crazy to think I found out about NF from a 30 second youtube ad for his first intro 2 years ago and now this...not all ads are bad lmao
Probably just me but I totally thought this was Eminem
Who wishes this song came out when they were still in school ?
R E S P E C K  W A M E N
Looking for the old me? CHECK THE MORGUE That line was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just wanted to say Praise God and thanks be to Jesus Christ for David sharing NFs music with us! Keep loving the people for Christ bro...
Sound like M. He gonna make come back out 😂
 I gess i don'f fit the mold of rap \nCuz i'm respectin' women \nThat's all i wanna hear for the rest of my life
Who the fuck is NF
Damn he is amazing and writing songs and the way he delivers is amazing ❤️
How the hell that I didn't know about him till now???
nothing like real hip hop with no mumbling just bars
I can't understand why he isn't famous yet...there are a lot of rappers who only sing about money and cars and women....while NF is real😒
it took 4 days to hit 1 Million 🔥
ONE MILLION VIEWS!!!!!!!! WERE GETTING UP THERE MAN KEEP IT UP!
Why is there even a dislike button? 🔥🔥 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥 🔥 🔥🔥
YO this shit is straight 🔥
You can't stop this! It doesn't matter what you say! NF is the Hulk running!
NF isn’t the second Eminem he is the fist Nate
He sounds like eminem when he sings
He sounds just like Eminem I thought it was him, never heard of this nf guy before!
I thought that guy is Eminem
Finally February 13th 2018 I will get to meet my favorite artist face to face, NF.
This Is NF’s Era.
I never knew you could listen to fire.
This is a huge up for him, he deserves every last piece of credit. Like and reply if you agree
woww !!\n\namazing
This is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥

I just ate, yum, Whata a savage 😂

But is it worth living in a world after the apocalypse
Please do the science of cold showers!! Should us as humans shower with cold water?
Says how to survive in the forest\n\nDoesn't say ho to survive the zombie apocalypse.
It is damn near impossible to get close to a wild rabbit unless your the flash wth
I'd rather just kill myself
the water contained in cacti actually has a type of poison that makes you sick though also you should melt the snow before eating it because just eating raw snow will lower your body temperature
Or just do this.\n1) Get on phone\n2) Turn on cellular data\n3) go to www.PizzaHut.com\n4) order pizza\n5) easy
Don't just eat snow! Melt it down first. Eating snow if you are already cold is a good way to get hypothermia.
Every one is talking about this😐y?
i am sick of the society i want ww3
Watch in 0.5x speed and he sounds drunk :D
I hope, I wont have to try to survive that...
Everyone knows an apocalypse won't happen but still they will watch it. 😂😂
Or... you can just hunt humans

What if a emp went off?
Question: What about vegans? There was a lot of mentioning about finding/cooking meat. So, what would the vegans/vegetarians do?
Actually, the key ingredient to surviving is Dank MEMES
I WROTE EVERY THING HE SAID BUT NOT THE CACTUS SHIT AN I GAING TO LIVE smh
If your shelter is an igloo you can build a fire. Just sayin'.
“Shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sautee it. There's, um, shrimp kebabs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried. There's pineapple shrimp and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich... That's, that's about it.”

World didn't end in 2000, 2012 nor on 23rd sep 2017... there will b no apocalypse... so chill...
That mentos ad was good.
This sounds really terrible but why would you WANT to be alive during an apocalypse? The earth would never be the same again and you can't live your life, you can't have a family, get a job or fulfil your dreams. Tbh, the lucky ones are the ones that die quickly at the start, I would rather die that way than die slowly and painfully from hunger/ radiation or any other way you could die. I'm not saying I wouldn't try to survive but I mean, it's sorta true.
If there was an apocalypse I will kill of you fuckers - XXXTentacion XXL 2017 Cypher
The best part of the apocalypse is that the left and right coast will be the first to go, and all the libtards will go with it.
How do you boil something in the wild
All pine trees are edible. ALL pines contain high amounts of  vitamin C. You can chew the needles or boil them to make a  tea.
Hmmm. I think I'll just die
I read the title as “How to Survive The Adpocalypse”.
I thought Vitamin-C was heat sensitive.
Im like that the only person that doesnt wear skinny jeans thats for pussies

Try to consider making a video on whether its better to put soap on your hands before you wash you hands, or while your hands are wet during your hand wash.
I was studying for a test on electron configuration but an asapscience video popped up. Oh well.
Only certain cactus can be used for water. You should have included that.
we are forgetting that we are 13 billions people on this planet ... that will result in mass hysteria, anarchism and so violence and self-destruction.\nYOU are gonna be the rabbit !!!

How often do we really need to bathe?
Woah woah woah... This is a science channel?? You CANT drink cactus water Bc in actuality cactus infused their water w a poisonous substance to protect it, anything that drinks it will get violently ill throwing up and w diarrhea. You will die of dehydration.
too much tannic acid from acorns can be lethal to humans
Day 1:  Apocalypse \nDay 2:  Turn to cannibalism\nDay 3:  Learn to make homemade jerky\nDay 4:  Make new friends
Vegans,\nThis is why we need to be tentative. Ergo; sorry, not sorry Chickens but until then, yous safe and are my non edible friends.
Do NOT eat snow. Melt it first or you risk lowering your body temperature. Remember water freezes at 0 degrees Centigrade but it can be much, much colder.

Very interesting. Being Muslim and European I feel I've spent a lot of time thinking about the places where Islam and Christianity and Judaism intersect, thinking about different ways of looking at the proverbial mountain. There are multiple times when little kids have asked me 'eres monja?' meaning 'are you a nun?' because of my hijab. Or family members have asked whether halal is the same as kosher, or if lent is the same as Ramadan. In Islam, we believe that the three religions are a continuation of each other, they were sent to us in that order so that they could complete each other, across history we followed the message of the same god through different prophets, Abraham Moses Jesus Mohammed. Imam Ali has this great quote that says 'a person is either your brother in religion or your equal in humanity' and more people need to live by that\n\nSorry for the rant, it just saddens me that there is so much division between muslims, between believers, and between people :/
so interesting! would love for you to talk specifics & unpack this at some point :)
I have never heard of the Overton Window, but I love that it has a name that I can go and get more info on. I definitely believe in that concept but didn't have a word for it. There are some unshakeable truths in my life, but most things I love getting other perspectives on. \nAlso that drink at the end made me crave hot chocolate so thanks for that lol
I'm not religious. I'm open to spiritual concepts and metaphysical musings, though after 55 orbits around the sun, I've seen and heard most arguments. \nBut like you, I have some non-negotiables. Racism, homophobia - prejudice in general which is based on fear, I am unpersuadable (I think I just made that word up) when it comes to what my conscience dictates on such matters.  People are people, and I abjectly refuse to entertain biases based on what someone is. They are a person, that's what. If I have to judge someone, I want to base it on _who_ they are, not what.
I think a problem with the mountain metaphor is that not all view points are right. Like you said: racism. That's never going to be a valid way to view the mountain. I saw a graphic today that showed two people looking at a number from opposite sides. From the perspective of one of the people, it was a 6, and a 9 from the other. They were arguing about whether it was a 6 or a 9. Only one of them was right, though, because whoever drew the number there purposefully made a 6 or 9. The view point could only be solved by using context clues, asking questions, and having a discussion about its purpose and history. I felt it was very poignant, and maybe relevant to what you're saying in this video. Loved this one :)
I love your creativity, balance, intellect. Really enjoyed your last few vids in particular, with views on this, and what it is to be british, etc. All the best to you. :)
Wow! very interesting idea! I think I'm going to do and research this idea further... thank you :)
so articulate, love your vids and the food for thought
Was the theologian in hot pants Marika Rose?
Wonderful video! Great concise thoughts for us to mull over! Thank you for sharing. I love the mountain analogy and am definitely looking that up.
I think you'd find Dr. Jordan Peterson really interesting! ❤️️
Ahhhhh how refreshing to hear!  There’s so much to learn from in what you said in terms of how to listen to people of a different view to you! 👏🏻 Never heard of the Overton window before but will read up more on it.\n\nIf you have time, I’d highly recommend listen to a theologian called Michael Ramsden. Namely his one on whether Christianity is intolerant. (Clearly coming from a Christian perspective). The entire talk is interesting, but in responding to a question in the Q&A ( see 52:20 onwards) he unpacks a particular Oxford study on freedom of speech and the capacity to disagree which I think you might find interesting.\n\n(Please do inbox me your thoughts! Or if you find it intriguing enough, make a video!) ❤️
Hmm that mountain part made me think of Impressionism. As a creative, I think a lot about whom I'm trying to communicate with. I've been obsessed with thinking about the the lay viewer instead of professionals and colleagues. Got me thinking again!
Love this idea and love Greenbelt, are you going next year? I should be 🙌🏻
I'm basically persuadeable on anything relating to what istrue.\n\nIt's a few of the fundamental ought questions that I'm firm in.
Freaking L O V E  Greenbelt! Hope you had an ace time xoxoxo
I wish more people would be like you, Leena!
Very interesting concept  I've been thinking about this lately without knowing how to name it :) Lots of love from Luxembourg
have a good time
I think thinking i like your thinking, however overton windows? they are too basic. Saying RACISM is one, but that's too simple to me. This may be because i was a scientist, but in my opinion i think it's too basic a term. one key on my keyboard is broken and you will see which one in a moment. i heard the saying minorities are no problem for people until they become the magority (yes i know it's not spelt with a g!) and i think to understand or be wrong about something one has to delve deeper into the cause of that group of ideas. As far as i can tell it is very instinctive and in our DNA to appease evolution, evolution is unsurpasable..one can not override it with logic or environment or education. parts of evolution never leave our brains, and that part is the part we should look at. EVen the FEAR element behind racism is a massive indicator of things. I think , yes we can be prepared to be wrong, btu we must be prepared to delve much deeper into the whys not just the result to figure out how best to tackle this in society and come to an understanding with other people on earth. it may be unshakeable..but that does NOT excuse you from delving deeper, these people still have valid feelings, regardless of how utterly distasteful they are to us, and understanding more can be the key to actually changing things. it is so easy to dismiss fear based reactions, like the gun owning argument (yes i know it is more complicated) and bombing another country on account of a group of individual's actions and justifying it using blame factors like religion ro such to then make it seem like the whole country are terrorists in order to dispense bombs that rip civilians apart. and the others throwing their hands up in despair and grief at the actions. look into the actiual origin of the thinking to find the clues. these things are too big to generalise.
i've missed your videos like this, this was so interesting, tysm!!
this was so crazily mind-opening.\nthank you for this monologue!
This is very true. With the whole birth control thing going down in the US I got into a couple of twitter discussions and it was really interesting to see the way different people would have different levels of flexibility around the discussion, and also the way a lot of people would cling to an absolutist viewpoint. I talked to a lady who had the general view of 'This shouldn't be included in healthcare because sex not for procreation is immoral' and I suggested that most people using birth control are married with children, and should surely be able to enjoy sex within their lawful loving all-american marriage without risking pregnancy every time... and she said no. Much of the arguments were incredibly hyperbolic on both sides, but that particular instance really stood out as someone who probably didn't really believe what they were saying, but would not budge from their principle. \n\nThere's a book called 'The Righteous Mind' by John Haidt and it looks at why so many of us (myself included a lot of the time) refuse to budge from our political and religious standpoint even when presented with ideas that do make sense. It gives an insight into why Trump supporters are still on board and why the media on both sides has a lot to answer for, it's not the most engaging read, and it's from 2012 so it's a little outdated BUT it's definitely a valuable resource.
I enjoyed this!
♡
Fabulous thoughts, as always <3
1st one
This is why it bugs me when we're separated into two and only two groups (left and right or whatever). It makes it harder to find my neighbors.
🏔️
trending with 2.8k views 🤔\n\nSo anyways I did watch the video, interesting concept \n\njust curious how do you feel about islam? You were saying how you went to the islam workshop tents which is great\n\nbut then you said that sexism was no way in your overton window, meaning that you will never entertain the idea of sexism (also great)\n\nbut then sexism is actually deeply routed in the islamic culture, exhibit 1: Saudi arabia only just allowed women to drive, in 2017, thats bonkers right? I cant think of anything MORE sexist \n\nDid they mention any of this in the talks? Not trying to hate whatsoever, just interested on everyones opinion on this matter
So just to add to the concepts in this video, the thing about the mountain actually is kind of making another point as well - that even if you're sitting on one side of the mountain and seeing one thing and someone else is seeing something entirely different on the other side, you're both still looking at the same mountain, and neither of you are wrong. The mountain of course being an allegory for life, the universe, right and wrong etc, the point is that just because you absolutely cannot see another person's point of view, doesn't mean the point isn't valid and real from where they're standing! I think it's a really interesting metaphor that can help you view the world more dynamically! Sincerely, Grew Up In A HIGHLY Philosophical Household
This is such an interesting idea that I've really been thinking about a lot recently! Greenbelt always gives me fresh perspectives on the way I live my life and how to better myself. FYI I think I was stood next to you at Newton Faulkner's set but wasn't sure enough that it was you to say hey...so hey now I guess!
Be Vegan cause using animals as products is shit.
That cool
washing mashine!
This video was so satisfying!
Hey can u make wall e robot
TCC The Colin Company like if you agree
Or a little off road car
If it is water tight it could be turned into a boat
Lol pah i could get all water out of that car in 1 sharp turn
Only a fucking Brit would do shit like this
Make a potato launcher ferz
Make a supmarine
Make a airplane because your always at the airfield.  Like if you agree
Make real life spider man
A new invention pls
His laugh do
Lonsdale Road
I love it! 👍
UBER POOL
this falts laught
Do a motor trolley
Make a shopping cart go cart pls
Needs some flex tape
Maniac.\n\nAwesome too
Why does youtube unsub me from my favourite youtubers, like tf youtube
Mid life crisis
I am still laughing
nothing is useful in your inventions...waste of time...greedy inventions..
Issue one: Inertia \nI'm sure Colin can fix this
Most American English person ever.
His laugh is the best
You should put a wall curved towards the seats so that when you are cooking and someone is driving, the water would be pushed and directed around the grill.
His neighbors must love him
New rule.  Video's with British cars have to have to be flipped horizontally from now on.
Hey colin, try to make a jetpack, that's in a back pack!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike so he can see
What would the clutch be like on that how did that feel and the steering?
Make a house out of a bus
this guy cracks me up
Thats not street legal is it?
takumi could have done better driving
2:01 Guy's like, what in the bloody hell?! and picks up his child for safety. LOL
1:11 Is the steering wheel gonna get damp? Oh my god so cute
Dreams are crazier than ever\nAwesome thanks for making them reality
Why not cover the whole thing and fill it up and submerge yourself and leave a breathing tube and have googles and drove it on the street and get reactions from people 😂😂😭
Usually love your videos, but just a few thoughts on this one.  You're driving a car with dodgy suspension, dodgy brakes and no seatbelt on a public road, initially full of water.  Not exactly legal or safe is it?  Might not have been so funny if you'd hit something/someone would it?
All along I thought this was an E30 318i Manual, but now I know this is a 325i Manual and it hurts.\n\nUpdate: I see you have addressed what was hurting me. Great E30 sport by the way!
Can you put your Red series in a different feed? It's fucking annoying to fuck with my feed.
Loved this perspective Colin! All Time Legendary YouTuber here!!
Who is this man with you in the car?
I think I see the problem. They put the driver's seat on the wrong side of the car.
Would you need a different license to drive that car when full because of its weight?
ill re sub when you pull off the youtube red crap
Make a jet powered go kart
BMW’s better when wet
Great watch as ever Colin. Keep up the good work!
Well... I'm amused.  Love those Brits!
What practical use does this have lol
hey colin are you from notts
I dont know what the fuss is about with the new red show. kids or not its still cool AF
Being his neighbour must be really weird :D
You can walk on the water?
You should make a trans former
*Other Videos* :\n 1 Million likes,\n100k comments.\n\n*Colinfruz's video* :\n1 Million likes\n2 k comments.\n\nPeople are probably getting inspired and working their ass off tbh
Hi my neme is aleksey, i'm from Russia.
will it float if you put a boat motor in it
Are you still a plumber because I need my central heating looking at.
Your not quitting the channel are you? Im a big fan of your big projects
Colin is the definition of That's too stupid to work, LET'S DO IT
How much are you asking for? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Look kids there goes that nutty man that lives next door.
Colin does it float. That's the real question
1 hour 30mins to fill .. call the fire brigade and they'll fill it in 20secs with their hose, just light a small fire in the back and ring them up, once the fires out just ask them to keep filling her up
I can't get over how much fun Colin seems to be having in this video, it's infectious.
Who ever pixelated the video...
Just the thing if you are running late for work,  jump in the car and wash at the same time, keeping clean clothes at work ready to change into 👍
Piss in the water
what was that blur for in 2:12
Your supposed to keep water outside the boat not inside btw i kinda want to see you make it float on water
That's illegal you should have your driver's license revoked.
I love your videos because they inspire me
If you were in Brazil you would be cursed by waste of water
So this dipshit is charging for you to watch the most of his youtube videos now. Wow. Unsubscribed.
You're fake laughing is really pissing me off
You can tell that someone is very passionate about their project when there's a behind the scenes video for the behind the scenes video.
should have put the windows up
Can yo please take this to one of those flash restaurants or hotels were an usher will park you car for you. just give them your keys and sit back and laugh. This would be awesome to watch.
I'd jack my cock in that car and let the jizz float to the top.  Then a guy could skim it off the water and feed it to some niggers or Muslims lol
He has that mad scientist laugh lmao
Is... Is the steering wheel gonna get damp? \nThat made me smile so much hearing the little guy say that! Not sure why hahaha
I kid you not Colin, I found this particular video absolutely fucking hilarious and if I so happened to be in your neighbourhood, I'd shake your hand sir!
thank You for making and sharing this video. Great job!
How much you wanna bet that one guy peed
Make a giant security system
Imagine a car like that but with the rest of the body still intact. None of the water would spill out! Although getting in and out might be a problem without a hole in the roof or something...
This guy is like the A-Team or MacGyver , lock him in a garage with a hammer & 2 hours later he'll come out in the Iron Man suit.
This guy is Einstein
1:53 : Colin, I think this is the EXACT opposite of a boat...
Does he still have the Underground bunker?
Unsubscribing until youtube stops putting your red videos in my stream.
Hey~ Korean! Put your hands up!
WHERE IS YT RED EPISODE
The poop transplant animation was awesome! Lol!.😂😁😂
Poop transplant? What???
This is deep and dark
Huh, I'm feeling a bit ill, can someone shove their healthy poop up my ass for me?
I'd even go so far as to argue that instead of seeing the microbial organisms living in our body as guests, it would be fair to consider them a part of our body. They are seperate organisms, sure, but if you start categorizing every part of our body as such, you'll soon realize that not a whole lot of what you consider to be you is actually you.
So is no one going to point out that poop transplant is a thing????
5:58 I find the depiction of autism funny and I don't know why
Book microbes must explain why some people likes reading.
You are what you eat
I was born from a seasection and I just got sick with hinoch soclein pirpura [HSP] an auto immune disorder where the immune system attacks everything including my body, blood vessels  bust in the legs, feet, and around the stomach and liver, my legs looked like I got beat the crap out of my leg like by a hammer going really 100 times a second and that was by HSP not abuse my own body abused me and I have been in extreme pain a lot lately and the bruses happen inside my liver and stomach and my legs itched a lot and I could not stop
I am a bad example as I was born via c-section and I have a rock hard immune system
It gives a new meaning to  a gut feeling XD
Hey sorry to bother you but do you have any plans to continue the immune system videos?
So you are telling me by inserting poop of slim people i can make an easier weight loss and vice versa?
you lost me at poop transplant
the music in this episode is so good
Imagine taking in the Shit of Chuck Norris...
Why does this video smell like BULL SHIT.  This explanation is for kids boi.
40 seconds in and I'm already shitting my pants
I'm surprised nobody noticed the poop from Dr slump and dragon ball XD
Does anyone saw a dick?
I wish they make games
Best video I have seen on this topic!\nGreat job as always!
gimme your shit. i need it
Could you guys make a discord
Immune system 2 Soon please? Maybe fungal infection or prion infection or something of the sort.
It’s all fun and games until he starts getting to the poop part 😱
Blink twice if the bacteria are making you comment...
So basically I'm depressed because I'm a c-section baby
On the right side of the video at 6:00 , if you listen closely you can hear:  *Wee-zingggggg...* 
I didn't know pizza was fast food? Can some one tell me it isn't?
Damm i wanted to order a pizza -.- no I am making veggies
This video took a gross unexpected turn.
Wait do people actually put healthy poop in their gut?
I guess sometimes you shouldn't trust your gut.
The immune system cells working out was funny! Bravo Kurzgesagt!
This is actually so fascinating to learn about. One of the things that always made me picture eating healthy as difficult is how I always crave sweets and fatty things, but never much cared about fruits and vegetables. To think that not only can eating healthy things effect my gut bacteria like this, but that I can actively _change_ the things I crave to eat!\n\nIt's true, too. For the past few months I've had a much more balanced diet with plenty of vegetables in it, and I've actually been finding myself craving those as much, sometimes even more, than the kind of unhealthy things I used to. So cool!
The information is really interesting
So that is why when I eat a lot of chocolates, I feel addicted.
So that's why some people like canableisim
Another great video from big K
If anyone's interested in fixing their gut-microbiome without a poop transplant, you should give Amare a try. Their supplements help the microbiome rebalance itself while helping to repair the gut-brain-axis for better brain function, mood-neurotransmitter imbalances, or immune problems. https://amare.com/10060.
Amazing!!! My family and I love this channel
That is so fucking interesting
Thanks, Bill and Melinda G., for sponsoring such amazing content.
A bacteriocracy, if you will.
so you want to tell me, that fucking bacteria are affecting my intelligence?
New job: poop people. People kept in the best condition so they can give others their good poop
I'm trying to breed bacteria that can digest a gallon of sriracha.
inspired me to make a cartoon comic
Depression is a gut feeling
Where are the sources
So... the fastest way to a man’s heart really IS through his gut.
I have a gut feeling that this is false.
Do a video on consciousness
Microbes must love the likes of chocolate...I crave it.
I guess the majority of kurzgesagt’s subscribers must be 11 years old, judging by this comment section.
There's already research being done on genetically modified gut bacteria to cure all sorts of diseases.  Keep in mind that a lot of our gut bacterial already produce substances that act as drugs (have a direct chemical effect on our body).  \nhttps://geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/10/03/genetically-engineered-gut-bacteria-may-replace-pill-delivering-drugs/
The future of medicine. Is poop transplants? Somehow I did not see this coming.
This sorta make me proud. Like I have a little society inside me
What about vegan and vegetarian? Have they got overgrown green vegetable bacteria like fat people with fast food bacteria?
at 0:14 did they intentionally make the fleshy pink one on the tongue look like a dick?
If we are so codependant, is there still meaning speaking about bacterias as organisms different from our selves? why is my immune system me and not these bacteria that I can't live without?
Don't tell me there's nothing I can do about the micobes all over me! Excuse me while I go take a bath in molten steel to prove you wrong.
So many studies when they should have just asked my wife. Whenever she is hungry she turns into a psychopath. Proof that intestines influence our behavior, research done.
So you are telling me that eating healthy will make me healthier.....\nThat sounds too good to be true -.-
why the fuck i am paying for this bacteria ... did i really saw poop transfer .
Poop transplants.
Please do a concussion video, mentioning football kickoffs
Awesome video
Millions of years? Ummmm
quite optimistic from you guyz
This video is awesome!
Autisim is *not* a disease.
u should make a quantum collapse or entropy video
Ty for making me feel like shit again.
I literally was eating pizza while watching this and decided to put it away to show my bacteria im still in charge. Might finish it later tho
Crazy millenials butt chugging each other's gut flora..
This reminds me Osmomis
Fat people start injecting skinny shit!
Do one on leaky gut syndrome.
hahahaha, 'cold' war.
wow\neverywhere
Good one
I really liked this one.
poop transplant is catchy
BRING SKINNY PEOPLES' POOP TO MURICA NOW!!1!!!11
1:17 oh thats a boobis
I have asthma
Sources?
My name is Legion, for we are many.
Kurzesagt -- could you do a video on morals maybe? Or music? Just curious I bet that would be really cool!!
You always give cells personalities making me feel for them and junk!!
So do I eat too much healthy stuff? Sometimes I refuse to eat fast food, even when I'm starving.
Bill & Melinda Gates foundation!  Congratulations Kurzgesagt.
Beautiful video
Bacteria https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OW_rUjODqWE
Next stop, the poop shop.
Amoeba?

CG muzzle flashes is kinda bunk it looks good on screen but in my opinion but it would of been a lot cooler if it was a fully functional firearm instead of just the trigger functioning that would of been one of the coolest guns to take to the range
I know its not, but adams hat looks like its backwards
It's always fun to see Adam look like a kid in a candy store, just puts a grin on my face.
The Ducati Motorcycle in the background is not even necessary for me to tell this guy rides a Ducati, just sayin.
anyone know what leather jacket that guy is wearing, maybe schott?
I'm really curious what kind of leather jacket the prop master is sporting
I'm curious what type of ammo the new blaster uses, like is it bullets or is it an energy weapon? I only ask because it doesn't look  like it has any place to load traditional ammo.
Using a real gun in the prop sticks with the post modern feel of Blade Runner, the new one looks like some shit from the sci fi channel
Wasn't the old blaster a replica made by Tomenosuke?\nThey also got the permission to use the Blade Runner 2049 logo on the boxes of their latest batch.\nI can't understand why they are not addressing it and give Tomenosuke the proper recognition.
I don't get how in 30 years the blaster develops only into a single trigger difference really. Still a gun
Lol, Adam is already measuring and taking memory pictures to make his.
Fact it could not function as a real gun completely kills the cool factor. Its just a toy not a blaster.
Four words which will make you think of one movie:  Three Fifty Seven Magnum.
Lets hope Mr. Savage took measurements and all do to we do not want the blaster guess work all over again.
I love the bottles of Johnnie Walker in the background!
oooo those are noice...than handle is sweet....that recoil is so awesome...reminds me of time crisis
Anyone else distracted by the beautiful Ducati in the background?
I would love for Tested and Adam to take a look at some of the weapons from Dark Matter on Netflix.
For someone who really, really hates guns, Adam Savage really, really loves guns
Where was this filmed it looks very much like the Netherlands
I really have to rewatch Blade Runner again. it's been far too long sense the last time.
so k's sidearm is a blow forward receiver?
the new one looks on the barrel bbut the original's handle is so much cooler
how much did the one with the wood handle cost?
Should of based the new gun on a Luger i feel like if you modded it right it would function and look awesome.
Now the real question is will they help those who are interested in the parts of the gun (if it is made of any real items not completely sculpted new) with showing them what its made of. Or will it be another 20+ years of fans working together.
Adam review 2049 please !!! I wanna hear what you think.
Do we really need more videos about guns right now? Plus the movie is boring garbage.
Sorry to say but the movie was dumb, I didn’t understand it
Like a kid in a candy shop
Adam Savage acts like a NRA poster boy.
I thought 2049 was better than the original movie, but I'm not crazy about the new blaster. They did the classic sci-fi designers pitfall: Making it look overly cool and sacrifice function for form. I also just don't think it looks that cool. The original gun felt grounded and real, and had a very unique look. This new gun feels overly designed.
Adam Savage, what a damn savage.
i was really waiting for Doug to be like well you can keep one if you like that would have been awesome lol
Most iconic handgun? More so than Dirty Harry's 44 magnum? Bond's Walther PPK? Robocop's Autopistol? I mean, yeah, it's a cool gun, but I don't think it makes the top 10 of things  that come to mind about Blade Runner.
although I respect the work and effort put into the new blaster, I just don't like the new design of it... just looks like your typical futuristic pistol, doesn't look as iconic and special as the first blaster
I love to see someone as acomplished as Adam get all giddy over something.
Where's the latest This Is Only a Test podcast?
They made it grey and generic, nice
💕💕💕💕💕💕 Adam
proposed like order ygaxxli okay extend quantity operating extra hand worth.
He needs to learn how to trim his beard properly. Looks silly that high up.
How disappointing that you guys didn't even bother showing us close up comparisons. Verging on pointless!
Idk if this info exists but in the world of Blade Runner 2049, what caliber does that gun shoot?
Did anyone else notice the Jack Daniel's bottles ?
Can Doug and his crew redo the weapons for Alien: Covenant? That was such a cop out for them to use basic AR-15s and Steyr AUGs instead of coming up with something original like in Aliens.
Didn't like the new one. It's a beautiful desing, ok, but it lacks the mix of old and new, the revamped art deco look that made the original Blade Runner so influential and unique.
Not a particular fan of this new blaster design. I can't quite put my finger on it. :s
Next gen gun is ok but they should have kept the grips closer to the earlier version.
music at the end... Vangelis?
New gun looks like a super soaker
Why does it have two holes at the end?
Looks like Timecop Beretta with ugly handle. Original is much better.
Still surprised there isn't any Blaster homage in Destiny.
I wonder if Adam is capable of being disappointed, or if his excitement and enthusiasm always carry him beyond his expectations? I have a feeling that Ridley Scott could stub a cigarette out in a dog turd and Adam would be waxing lyrical about the aesthetics.\n\nI mean, the props do look good (as you might expect on a $150million+ production!) but I strongly suspect that however they looked he'd struggle to see anything wrong with them.
Damn it you lazy bastards! Get off yer asses and take & upload a cam already!!
Does Adam Savage Dream of Electric Sheep? Probably not but I bet he dreams of building the 2049 Blade Runner Blaster! ;-)
Adam please made me a accurate blaster please of Deckard. with flasing fire and sounds and heavy handguard
I just realized, is Adam wearing his hat...backwards? xD
I know they're fake guns, but my heart stopped when I saw Adam pointing it right at that dude's chest
And I bet Doug was thinking Adam is such a legend
It's funny. I really don't care about most of this nerdy stuff, but I really enjoy Adam and appreciate the craftsmanship of the people who make these props and replicas so I watch anyway.
Honestly... the reason movies these days loose the excitement of older movies is because everything is CG! If you're making a gun, make it fire! Stop going the cheap and easy route of making fake props!
Where is the boring bald chap?
2 Blasters. Not a spectrum of Blasters, Adam.
cg muzzle flashes look like crap. the issue isnt the flame itself, its the way it (doesnt) light the things around it realistically.
2:32 Hans Zimmer recording his score in the background
You get to get to do some way cool stuff Adam!!!!
Beautiful pieces. I adore watching Adam get so excited about props and design. It is so wonderful to see a person be so passionate about his craft and his fellow craftspersons. Adam's the ultimate prop-tart and we love him for it.
I love that jacket at the start and finish.
God that seems like such a cool job!
Will replicas be available soon. And if so, where do I find them? I''m desperate to buy one but don't know where to look.
How to make Adam nerdgasm in one easy step. :-)
You can't but be happy for Adam... So happy that you got to play with the guns!
That red ducati in the back is so sick too.
Is it just me, or does the old gun look way better? The new one looks like a goofy and generic comic book rip.
Adam and his Blaster again 😂
Amazing movie
Definitely still could have fired blanks
Adam's hat, anyone?
My precious!...
Meh
Thank you!!
Thsnks Adam
No close Ups?
That Gun
why is adams' hat brim backwards?
sorry they ruined it
That's a borderland gun lmao. Jakobs'
funny that Harlocker mentioned District 9. He's Sharlto Copley's doppelganger.
Las vegas
That Gun.
6 ounces = 170.097139 grams\n8 ounces = 226.796185 grams
Nice 🔫
tested in 2049
Doug should have given credit to Tomenosuke & Adam knows better. They may have made one Hero from scratch but most of those blasters are a kit from Tomenosuke; not fabricated by hand from scratch like he is claiming.\n\nThat is why Adam is not raving over the classic blasters and is fascinated by the rubber one and the new versions.  It's because he knows what they are and has several.
After the crime spree that occurred in Las Vegas, it’s appalling that you would post this on a YouTube. Remove this video immediately or else my organization will slam the might of our collective to banish you from YouTube and every other social media site. You have been warned you trifling heathen! Damn... all you crackerz are all the same! What is it with you and weapons?????
I hate to complain but would it have killed you to take some isolated shots of the guns instead of just shooting everything with one camera?  Would have preferred some closeups to just the glimpses we see.
The new blaster is shit.
movie was crap
2:41 Do i sense a bit of a LOGANGSTER??
Y O U T U B E S E N S A T I O N
Hey, so cool vblogs!\nI'll ask you if in the next  vblog could you include some complementary exercises to open shoulders and prevent injuries, like with an elastic strap for example or some kind of streching.

You are so inspiring
I like your muscularity
im a levle 6 in gymnastics
Hi Nile, well done on the competition my wife and I were away on holiday and managed to find time to watch you a fantastic effort. My daughter Sophie is current doing gymnastics and has got to a point where she is now doing competitions. However now she is receiving pressure from her coaches she is starting to find it alot harder. I used you as an example to how good she could be one day a she loves you to bits (she's is 8 and she is not aloud to like boys lol) is there anyway you could if her a few words of encouragement and explain that her coaches are just trying to encourage her to get better and better. Thank you Nile
If you get this then please help I love both but I don't know what to do gymnastic or trampolining and I can't do both
Why were niles hands orange around 4:16? Hahah
What colour is your hair?
Does anyone know if Nile is going to the 2018 Commonwealth games?
Where did those guys get the sweet King Kohei t-shirts??
Hi Nile, maybe you're not even going to see this comment but, here goes nothing...\nEven tho I'm a girl who has nothing to do with gymnastics, I'm totally amazed by the effort and hard work that you put everyday into becoming not only a better gymnast but a better businessman, a better person and a better mentor/trainer. \nSince I suffer from depression, your videos have been motivating me (not with gymnastics but in life) for the past weeks and you have made me realize that I am the only one who decides if I want to give up on things or not and you've teached me a different perspective of life... Anyways, I love watching your videos and you're and really handsome guy haha\nI just truly wanted to get it out of my chest, lots of love from a German fan :) xx
So u gonna get bram to join your challenges some time?
You are so inspirational, I started watching you at the beginning of july and I got so motivated to stretch and work on my handsprings and tucks, and eating healthier and in a week I'm trying out for cheer team, wish me good luck, and keep up on the good work!
Honestly never cheered so much watching you compete today Nile! Smashed it!!! You've done yourself and the entire country so proud xx
Been smashing your videos this weekend, great distraction from doing my work. Great work with your recovery. Can you answer a question for me? How wide do you have you Parallel Bars. I'm using paraletts and figure I should be setting to the same width.
I'm pretty sure swimming a 200m butterfly is way tougher than gymnastics itself.
I swear I could hear your dad when I was watching the stream.
Nile, it is very interesting to watch you compete. You are very different during competitions. Quite intimidating to watch. I'm so used to seeing this sweet funny guy on YouTube and then during competitions, I watch you stare down the Pommel Horse like you're gonna murder it (who doesn't want to murder pommels tbh). Congrats on your sixth place finish in the AA. Incredible work!
What’s the intro song?
the game graphics is lame for 2017 game
Practically people from India are orcs.
Elijah Wood should've been in this video
This is hilarious, great chemistry between this 2 lol
This looks like the same damn game years later lol.
Kumail should be Conan's regular clueless gamer guest.....this is the best!
Everything is racist for Conan and that Iranian dude.
genually i dont like celebs on cluelessgamer. this guy was funny
All the shades of your mom's lipstick
Somehow Aaron gets skinnier every time he appears on Conan
I'm saying,Pied Piper needs funding \n😂😂😂😂😂
The Orc who is dazed by brutal violence or shaming (Twitter) is the best part.
my dream clueless gamer is fire emblem warriors with matthew mercer
I hate watching people like this play games because they never take them seriously, and it’s just not entertaining to watch
I'm sorry, I have already checked 'moosehead'
I'm starting to miss Conan rating system.
Amazing gameplay and Conan u rick
they did not tell him about micro transaction...it would have been funny
Trying so hard not to laugh at this video in the office. I'm trying to mask it as sneezes. \nI kind of like the idea that not all orcs have that gruff voice. Maybe he is a lesser orc. OK, now I just sound classist. \n\nGiven the current controversies around this game I'm not even sure if I will buy it. Maybe I'll buy it when it's $20 which is in 2-3 years. I don't mind the wait. So many good games coming out soon.
Why is assassins creed combat so popular it's so boring
The real clueless gamer is the one that buys this loot box hell.\nSha pow 💃
I want to see Coco play some Destiny
I was the thousand dislike :D
if only conan would dedicate his life to video games he could make a great career out of being a funny youtube  let's player.
Tf, it's not even out yet
Does this game has online multiplayer or something like that ?
Pleas do one for Bendy and the Ink Machine. :D
am I the only one who wants conan's voice in this game
Is it sad i bought the gold edition for 100 dollars
hi mike, how hard are u gonna fck us with ur microtransactions?
Do not buy this game its just a massive scam.
I want this game so bad but im so broke my last pay check was under a 100
6:28 He sounds like a goblin xD
that voice better not be really in the game
I wonder how Conan would handle E-sports.
I'm surprised Kumail was able to go 8 minutes without complaining about Trump.
4:50 man that sounds... so frickin bad\nLMAO\nThe cringe is amazing
Ya know dugz voice sounds off putting. But it kind of works.
They should have used his voice when you open a loot box. That would've cheered people up so they would pay more money.
His orc voice is good! Because it sounds original instead of grungy like most, they do have higher pitched orcs that sound insane! He did a good job
I't s rather old game, but I would LOVE to see Conan do The Last of Us.
First good Conan and celebrity duo for clueless gamer...
This was a funny guest. Most of them suck and are unfunny.
dynamically generated ennemies, this game will be  a pain in the ass for speedrunners lol
LOL i cant wait to hear his voice ingame tomorrow if i come across him
I usually find the celebs pretty cringy but this guy was great!
Conan is funny in a way that makes him seem like he has a disability.
The funniest clueless gamer in a long time!!!
And I thought he was a really bad choice for this Salarian in Mass Effect Andromeda, but an ork is even worse..! Much worse! I like the guy but those roles just don't fit.. his voice makes these characters just weird, which in turn breaks the immersion.
Its a good feeling to tell the guy you worked for that he fucked up
rare occasion that an episode with a guest star is still funny. kudos!
Nanjiani and his wife used to do a video game podcast called The Indoor Kids or something.  Good stuff.
should just play with Aaron
Clueless gamer ... yep clearly clueless about the despicable business practice known as microtransactions in full priced games.
DO WWE2K18 IF YOU CAN
I didn't see this on my subscription feed. I don't like that I didn't see this video on my subscription feed.
Please get him to play Dark Souls 3
7:22 Lmao he just dodges over the question like nothing xD
That voice acting... was... TERRIBLE.  The lin e is kinda funny, but that delivery and vocie just don't do it any favors imo.  Not hating on the guy, but know your strengths...being an Ork isn't one of em.
I think his voice was actually pretty good tbh, but my motherlanguage is not english so maybe its because of that.
No it's not my religion, I just like it. 0:38 - 0:40\n\nPeople who get offended by others who just have different opinions from theirs need to know this. LOL.
Why does everyone wants aaron back i mean he does stands alone on this channel and besides playing with celebrities makes it more interesting for the audience
I really like Aaron he's so cute!!!
Wait. Was that voice over real...? That can't be real, can it? Nobody could have thought giving an orc that voice would be a good idea....
Please stick to comedy Conan and leave politics alone. Thats why people watch you to escape the crap and corruption out there. Your job is to entertain us not to inform us of whats going on in politics. Please stick with comedy, for the love of Pete stick to the comedy!
Just a day left!
His voice.....Could they not put a Filter over it?
Who else is planning to make Kumail Nanjiani’s orc character suffer? Reggie didn’t suffer enough.
That guy must be the worst voice actor ever
Pied piper needs funding xDD
He's happy
I hate you Conan
Kumail seems like a lovely guy
hahah YES!!! thank you Conan. Keep these gems coming
5:30
I literally lol
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssa 🤓🤓🤓
watching conan attempt to play games isn't that funny
At least Conan didn't trash this game like Final Fantasy 15.
This is how Clueless Gamer should be. The comedy is there, and the game is there. The previous most recent CG videos were disappointing. This one makes up for them.
lol, another reason to dislike this game.
conan u are the best/
PLAY ROBLOX PLAY ROBLOX PLAY ROBLOX PLAY ROBLOX PLAY ROBLOX
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=X_5_BLt76c0
please play Dream Daddy
Plays middle earth without Elijah Wood...
worst clueless gamer yet
Indian Orcs?
SHADOW OF MICROTRANSACTIONS
Actually thinking orcs woudn't sound like normal people is racist, orcphobia much shitlords?
Kumail is so adorable. ❤
Shadow of Micro-transactions\nShadow of Loot boxes\nShadow of more dollars
terrible voice acting
Crop determine cool somehow twin warn earnings population drain.
Good good now I demand another clueless gamer
Best Thai Restaurant = Best PF Chang
Clueless gamer with IT!!!!!
That was hilarious
Conan should play Conan
I love Kumail
Please do more
CALAB WITH EMMA WATSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

you should not wash her ears especially since she has floppy ears, if the water gets trapped in side her ears it can grow fungi
Tip: next time when you give her a bath try not to put water on her ears because they are very sensitive

I fucking love Russell he's hot funny and naughty all at the same time and a freak in one makes u want to bone him so hard
Wendy was having a hard time following his humor.
Russell is a legend of our time. His life is the realist thing anyone can relate to.
Delightful interview.\nNever knew he was so .... You know\nDelightful😄
He's fell off since the divorce from Katy Perry.
He should have his own show !
This is not a talk show its a gossip show from one of the characters from CATS musical.
I have the animals but haven't gotten to exploiting them yet 😂😂😂😂😂
He is a funny guy!!
Love Russell and interview
Russell Brand is Sexy and Woke AF and he's fucking clever you've gotta love him I'm kinda glad he left America and we have him back haha x
I love himmmmm omg
He is lovely.
Love him
WoW...at first I was wondering...then YESSSSSssss I get what this Man is trying to say...WE DON'T NEED CORPORATE PROGRAMMING...WE DON'T NEED TO BUY WHAT THEY ARE SELLING...WE NEED PROGRESS AS A SPECIES.....WE CAN RULE - BEING OURSELVES WITHOUT THE PRETEND!!!..WE ARE ALL ROYALTY!!!
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. Such a creature of a different frequency SUPER SMART! We GOTTA CATCH UP!
She looks like a lizard person
Russell brand  and Kate winslet  from Titanic would be a great couple he's funny just like her 😂
I love watching his interviews with Wendy lmao. He's so extra, but hilarious and very intelligent.
Unfortunately Russel Brand is the ultimate Wendy Williams guest - his struggle with addiction, fatherhood and how parenthood straightened him out, and the love of a good woman keep him on the right path. Cheers. Unfortunately it made him boring
If this is him sober, then.....
How can you ask a person if he blames himself about his fiend's passing?!?! Asking him if he could have done something to save Amy Winehouse...really?
Am I the only one who thinks Russel Brand looks like a young Billy Bob Thornton?
10:30 sounds more like wendy's in the hot seat
The audience is full of horny heifers lmao!
Man he's pretentious. Do people really fall for this? He's just regurgitating a word salad of marxism mixed with the problem of hard solipsism most of the time. He thinks consciousness is some undetectable homogeneous energy that exists everywhere all at once and drives our bodies like meat wagons. All evidence indicates that consciousness is an emergent property of electrochemical reactions between billions of innervated neurons and that it ceases to emerge when the reactions can no longer be sustained and your neurons cease to fire...
he's so fast i love it
Yeaaaaaaaassssss!!! Consumerism is killing Humanity! You’ve come a long way Russell and so happy you are here❤️💛💚 Stay👁woke🔥
“...I was ringside, and I use that term deliberately....” \n\n\n🤣
My God! His humor is everything 🤗🤗🤗
She is a terrible interviewer.
He could also pass as John wick's brother
I sincerely love this guy.. He is very wise.
RUSSELL IS ARTICULATE ASF
Aliens have landed! what's not to love?! Let loose, bring out the fantastic in our world!
He's so yummy and smart
He so owned this haha he's so funny!! Anyone else really considering buying the book 👀!
Woke and always sexy ❤️him !
he played you Wendy
Amy whine house love her still this man is so amazing at being himself so funny hahahaha
I laughed so hard. Omg. I love Russel he is a Wildcat. Wendy your great. So much energy...
i just fell in LOVE with russel brand  THAT is why British humor and British blokes rock!
What a man
This interview was hilarious! I was laughing the whole time i was watching it. He reminds me of Jim Carey, he cant stick with one topic, he gets all over the place and makes people laugh at his jokes.
I love this man. 😂💛
He’s a bit exhausting hahah but u gotta love\nEm he reminds me of one of my acting coaches from college lmao
Love this guy.. Quite impressed at 9:05-9:15. Truer words have never been spoken. Thanks for exposing yourself in such a way that your example can be viewed as genuine and sincere. I find him funny, entertaining, and highly intelligent.
Love his crazy energy and passion! Handsome man! 😍
Crikeys Russel I didn't know about the mothers bits moving forward like a mound - and I have four children
This is hilarious! Both of them are HILARIOUS working off one another
i was ringside, and i used that word deliberately hilarious and didn't even get a laugh
He is exhausting‼️ but so interesting and has great energy
Wendy is clearly confused throughout this...
I love this this mutherfucker crazy brilliant love him lol
Russell could've done that segment all by himself.  This was her worst interview imo constantly asking about the past,  katy perry and even amy winehouse, really?
Russell talking about swimming in chocolate waters then there's a shot of 2 black women?! #ShadyCameraman at work again. 😂💀
his mind goes a mile a minute - so fast, so witty
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i love his energy!!! lol
He is funny love him
This guy is weird in a way that his presence is too heavy
I can't watch this...he is too much.
I so  get him.
I have always found his humor awesome and out spokeness
6:55 Russell is so smart ♡
I liked how inclusive he was when he was taking about childbirth and said ...men need to know, or same sex partners also. What a great guy.
He said he ain't exploit the chickens yet. LMBAO. I could chill with this dude all night. That one crazy white friend every black man needs in his life.
Wendy can't handle him. His mind and his  personality is too big for this platform.
This was a great interview, hilarious and deep.I feel like I was high watching him. I enjoy him but can only take him in doses. 😂😂
Well I didn't know Russell was woke. Don't go missing Russell
It's thought, Russell, not fawt. It's the only language you speak, Lassie, and it's not that hard to get it right.
OMG \nDude is straight up hilarious!\nFires on all cylinders.
I knew this would be interestong to watch. He really has made himself a blessing to this world. :) good job Russ
Well isnt he a fruit
After what he did to Katy, he disgusts me...
so cray , hes brilliant
This was brilliant!
Wow. Never seen her so unbalanced. Smashing!
He looks high af
He's hot
*drooooool*
gawd hes ANNOYING af
3:18 Wendy got called out!
Absolutely LOVE Russell Brand
Phwoaaar aren't you lovely 😫😫😂😂

Wendy is insufferable.

Funniest celebrity interview ever!
Lmno
He’s a riot, very entertaining
He is so sexy.. He's the type to start a cult and I'd follow him
Hi guys!! Will be starting Accutane on Oct 12 (assuming all goes well with lab results on the 11th) and will be having the acne story video coming the following week! I'll be documenting each month on Accutane & filming update videos, etc. This video was pre-filmed, so I ended up being able to get about 2 months of Foundation Friday videos pre-filmed in time before starting Accutane- yay! xx
How i got here beats me lol. Im a guy and never had any acne. But she seems so professional that i stayed to watch just cause. Cheers, hope you all have a good day and the accuthing works for you!
Good luck with accutane ! Very exciting ,, I did it 13 years ago when I was 20,, was the last and final resort I had cystic acne also..I did six months yea the nausea was hard but was worth it . My skin has never flared up since just hormonal flare up for thag time of the month. And I do agree ur skin does switch to dry my skin is very very dry . But I have no regrets ,, good luck on your progress . You will love ur results. Don't give up everyone is different . It helped me. The first week or so is hard you will flare up cuz it's bringing everything to the surface and yes you will be dry and your lips will crack but remember it's temporary ! It will pass stay strong and don't give up and finish your treatment fully 😊
I have oily skin and I use sand beige works well for me I set it with the air spun powder and it doesn’t break down for me
I used acutane when I was 20, best medicine I ever used because it made my bad acne go away forever. Although I did have to get blood tests every month or week I forget. It was that powerful. I'm glad I used it though and hope all goes well with you
Wow you have the prettiest eyes! 👀
I hate this foundation. The same thing happened to me with it breaking down and looking very cakey. So many people raved about it but it was a big fail for me.
Oh HELL TO THE FUCK NAWW!!! GUYS PSA: FIRST DATE , TAKE THAT BITCH SWIMMING IN A HEAVILY CHLORINATED POOL!.\nMAKE UP IS SCARY AF!
Accutane was the best thing to happen to me! I felt like I looked like a completely different person once my face cleared up.
Huge question. Does applying makeup like your video increase skin irritation? I have a daughter that is starting to learn makeup and is having some minor skin issues. Thanks
I'm so happy for you that you are finally going to try Accutane. You do whatever you gotta do and if any body doesn't like it, they can fuck off because it's not their life or really their business.
I’m so excited for you! I really hoped Accutane works for you!
I did about 3 months of accutane when I was 19, about 4 years ago. The prescribing dermatologist recommended that I use cetaphil/cerave face wash, a good moisturizer, and CHAPSTICK. Tayla, my lips were constantly peeling. My acne was pretty well gone in three months and I only struggle with hormonal break outs monthly now (they are very minimal). I am so excited that you get to do this, I hope it works well for you and enjoy the results! I think I was still able to wear foundation during accutane, so I hope you can, too, if you want to! <3 <3
Selfish comment alert: My skin has recently gone from combo/oily to dry after finishing accutane 2 months ago and I'm excited to see some videos from you on product recommendations for dry skin! ;)
tried this a few weeks ago when i realized they had a shade that would match.. anyone else have a really terrible reaction to this? man!  im 99% sure that i had an allergic reaction to this (as i cant think of what else it would be) and got almost a rash of breakouts AFTER ONE USE. im guessing it was fragrance. but even if i didnt have a bad reaction, the complaints you had were the same for me; although not as much it did last longer through the day bc i set it w powder (which looked heavy)
I had bought these foundations in desperation to find great coverage for my skin color. Also cuz tati raved about it. I work as a nurse pouring sweat running around and by 8hrs my makeup on my cheeks was off and it looked like I used  cooking spray on my face. Loreals pro-matte infallible  is fantastic for my oily skin. That's the first ever cheap foundation that stayed put thru humidity,sweat and oil. My makeup was still on and my t zone wasn't bad😆
this foundation works really well with light baking with Coty Airspun powder in your T-Zone💙💙💙 love you!
i LOVE how involved you are with your audience! I really feel the effort you put into these videos. I love how you're constantly switching things up and asking what we think and taking our thoughts into consideration. You are and will always be the most attentive and caring youtuber ever! And my favorite 💕 Love ya! #SnapFam #Baeritto
Just want to say that Walmart has ooA :)
my skin was so incredibly oily before accutane that even though i was on a high dose my skin never even got dry, just normal. i never peeled or anything lol. now my skin is moderately oily and it was the best decision ive ever made. good luck on accutane i hope everything goes well for you! stay hydrated and take fish oil!
I wish you well on the accurate journey! You're gorgeous already, I have a good feeling it's gonna work out lovely for you :)
Hey Taylor! \nWas wondering if you could do a review of a new drugstore makeup brand that just hit my Walmart shelves called found cosmetics it's supposed to be an all natural eco friendly brand! Would love to see your thoughts on it! Love you!
Hi Taylor. This isn't makeup related and I know you don't like to make personal videos but I was wondering if you have any remedies or suggestions for my sister's migraines. She got a really bad one today and I feel so bad not being able to help her.
Glad to see a negative review on this foundation. I have combo skin. No breakouts or issues typical combo. I tried this so many times before I tossed. It looked like crap around my nose. Made my pores look huge no matter what primer and broke down in my t zone.
The edit on the display image tho...bad
i wish ypu well with your treatment. my daughter did the Accutane treatment. it worked but only temporarily and her skin was incredibly sensitive- even the skin on her hands. out of absolute desperation, she finally went oil free vegan, eating veg, fruit, seeds, nuts, and grains. bingo....took about 2 months, but she's nearly flawless now.
You have beautiful eyes
Bummer you didn't like this foundation... It's my favorite drug store full-coverage foundation for my combo/dry skin.  I always set it with translucent powder and a setting spray... but it wears all day for me until I take it off.
I like the idea to use primer on only half of your face. I've used a number of foundations that don't work well with certain primers or look better without any primer at all.
Thank you for all of the hard work and dedication you do for your fans. I love listening to your voice,it calms me down when I'm having an anxiety attack.
Please do a video on how you whiten your teeth. They are WHITE Im a coffee lover like you and I need to know!!!
Hey Thataylaa, I just wanted to say that I love your videos and I appreciate you helping us, acne prone skin sisters out with our foundation choices. I was wondering if you would be able to review the 100 pure 2nd skin foundation? I love the ingredients but I'm not quite sure how well it does with coverage and wear time. I have similar past acne marks like you. Thanks and wishing you an awesome week! 💕
I was on accutane for 6 months about a year an a half ago and I honestly think it permanently damaged my skin.. good luck and I hope you get good results! And moisturize moisturize moisturize!!!
Thank you for all of your hard work! We appreciate the dedication you put in and it's one of the (many) reasons we love you.
Revlon color stay powder usually makes any shitty foundation stick all or most of the day for my oily skin.
Taking Accutane was one of the best things I did. It's been over 5 years and my skin is still pretty clear!
I was talking about this to a friend of mine who was on accutane and she told me it made her super dry “down there”. I don’t know, I thought that was an interesting side effect I’d never heard of
Have you tried Curology?
I'm a guy, I feel like having a layer over your face would feel soooo uncomfortable.
I hope the accutane works for you ! I know it must be so hard and frustrating ! make sure to take care of yourself drink water, rest, relax and watch what you eat. Good luck ! I know your skin will clear up by the new year for sure !
Pleeeeease do a review on No. 7 makeup. They also have an app to find your perfect color but wanna see how it wears.
Wishing you the very best. \nGod Bless You young Lady
Nothing like pounding 5g of makeup to your face
Watch and Love all your videos! 🌯💕
I have super dry/eczema skin and this foundation works for me.
I have oily combo skin also and it looked just as bad on me as it did on you. I hated it, I looked like I was melting. Lol
I tried a looot of foundations, high hand and drugstore, nothing works for me except this one 😯 i have acne and oily skin with dry patches
Good luck with your skin journey! I'm also considering starting accutane as well. I hope you get the results you want!!!
Your very pretty without the makeup, the acne doesn't bother me 🙂
Your fuckin hot. That mouth and teeth 🙀🙀 perfect
Heal first!!
Reasons why I have trust issues always take your date to the pool
Will you please do a review on The Balm’s Even Steven whipped foundation. The jar looks so tiny, but it’s supposed to be super full coverage.
I have normal skin with an oily tzone and I've tried this foundation a couple times. It felt disgusting within 2 hours.
Hi from NZ!! First off can I say that you are an absolute inspiration to all those who suffer with acne. You are incredibly beautiful and I hope all goes well with the accutane. I went on isotane (very similar) and I went off due to some emotional side effects but hey everyone is different😊 My advise is pretty much the same as most people: A good lip balm and moisturizer is everything:)  Good Luck.
This is why we have trust issues
Accutane cured me but it took 3 trials for me. Each time the acne was less and so were the sides (good luck with accutane during cold winter months). First my Chest acne was cured, second try my back was cleared and finally after my final try my face was cleared. It took me 2.5 years to fully get over acne at the ripe age of 23 lol. Even my scars have healed I'm 26 now. Tanning helps with the scars.
I actually spotted the shades 00A and 00B at my local Walmart. They seem to have more of a selection than any other Walmart I've been to lol
Can you add the Ellis Faas Skin Veil Foundation to one of your Foundation Fridays or 15 DoF?  Wayne Goss mentioned it, but I don't trust anybody else, lol!
Because I was a grease bomb, Accutane only made my skin normal out. However, it made my lips chapped af. It might make you a bit miserable, but stick with it! It is 1000000% worth it!
well milani is geared toward people of color so they probably actually didnt see a need to make light shades
Have you tried drinking a table spoon of apple cider vinegar twice a day? It really helped me out with my skin problem. Of course my skin didn't clear up the next day, but it took a week before I show a little sign of progress. And boy was it great.
Not sure if comments are a zero sum game, but came back to leave another comment just to say, TAYLOR YOURE DOING AMAZING SWEETY. #GoodVibesOnly 🖤
What I don't like about foundations is they don't have a fair peachy color. Phycians formula had a foundation powder a long time ago in that color but stopped making it. Nothing matches my skin.
Why do white chick's have such bad acne
And this is why guys say make up is false advertising.
makes you wounder if she would not cake on the make up for a week if here acne would lighten up
OMG the amount of Mansplanning on this video in the comments is ridiculous.....Taylor I am so sorry that this still goes on. I love that people would assume that you have not looked at many options and figured out for yourself as an adult what is best for you. Crazy. I also love that people complain about makeup when they clicked on a makeup review. LOL crazy.
Accutane is seriously worth it. There will be scaring but it will go away with time. But it’s one of the best decisions a person with acne can make.
Makeup is great and all but I think it does more harm than good. Sure it may cover up what you believe to be major imperfections but it damages the skin even more. \n\nHonestly I’d suggest to women that use makeup to first drink at least a gallon of water a day, wear sunscreen in the morning, try not to eat foods that are really oily, and moisturize after your bath/shower. It’s troubling to see what some women have to go through everyday to feel confident in themselves. \n\nIt may sound cliche but guys appreciate it when women don’t wear makeup. Unless of course you’re doing it for yourself, that’s cool too...
*BEFORE* 🤢🤢🤢🤢 \n\n\n*AFTER* 😳😳🤔🤢
Disgusting
This bitch is fake af
Lmao and you think covering your zits with shit makeup is going to help NOT dumb video
Girl u need to detox and a doctor. Not no make up make up make it worst
Girl get a tan
I think that make up is messing with your acne .. but you're still Beautiful
Whoa! Makeup really changes a person!
Just stop putting on makeup until your face heals ffs. Nobody cares how it look ffs. I guess I get it for special occasions like black tie events or weddings.
FAAAAKKKE
Listen young Millennials Males. These females are in disguise. They are wearing masks both literal and figurative. Make sure you know who you are getting tangled up with before getting in deep or you'll be stuck In a nightmare with a narcissistic Streg!!\n\nGo listen to a song by Billy Joel. Older song called The Stranger. You've been warned.
Omg. All these people who have never had cystic acne giving “advice” on how to get rid of it. \nI’ve had cystic acne since I was 13. Here’s the list of things I’ve tried to get rid of it. No soda, no dairy, no gluten, no sugar, no caffeine .  For a year. Every prescription drug except accutane. Salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, no makeup, working out 3x a week for a year, more sleep, more water. I did all organic food with no processed foods and no dairy for 3 weeks. (The ultimate reset) \nGuess what. I still have cystic acne. I am now 44 and am considering doing accutane, even though I’m terrified of the side effects. Nobody who hasn’t dealt with this for most of their life gets to have an opinion on what will get rid of it. \nGood for you, Taylor. I hope it works well for you.
Damn. From Freddy Kruger to ru Paul in   An instant. Good job.
Thank god you're finally doing something about it, all these damn foundations don't help.
This why you go to the water park on the first date
Have u ever tried face wash and proactive?
This makeup clears up your acne? If not you should moisturize and use sea salts.
Cut the dairy and sugar out of your diet. Add some leafy greens, fuck acutane.
Yo, what's all over your face
Omg the deception
That went 0-100 real quick
I love it when you fugly bitches try to hide your acne with makeup , fucking pizza face hoe stop trying to hide your puberty complexion 😜😂
i got 500th dislike wooo
Good god is she ugly
Do you go to sleep with a fire ant face mask or something?  What the fuck is wrong with your skin?
This is why I have trust issues
Has it ever occured to you all of that make up is why your shits all mooned out? Just drink gallons of water?
The bottom of your face looks like cottage cheese.
What the fuck happened to your face wtf. That is definitely a symptom of a toxic environment. Did that happen before or after you started using makeup? Do you just eat butter nonstop? That is a crazy amount of herpes on your face.
Wait isn't the main reason for having her skin like that is because she's using way too much makeup...??
Where is the uncle shark?

Thanks it's 3:30 in the morning and this really helped my insomnia. You had to mention Donald
You know you're absolutely right. Fuck them for being so selfish and wanting to look after their families. \n\nYour social agenda must be very fragile if you feel like you need to attack something like self preservation by blaming it on greed.
I remember when these guys were good.  I guess they caught liberalism.
I use time travel to get around issues like that.
I grew up as a survivalist. We weren't prepping for future disaster, we were fighting to stay alive in real time in the real world.
Why should someone feel guilty if there rich?
So he did need I surgery?
Why would you feel guilty for being rich? I mean you worked for it you earned it
Here i have been in nz wondering where i would go in an apocalyspe. I guess ill set up a tent in the backyard?
gotta love good old new zealand imma proud kiwi <3
Whistle blows:\n1 = Where are you \n2 = Come to me \n3 = I need help\n\nI would love to have a stash of food.\n\n...but I also try to eat what I have to save money.
I just need a trench coat and a level 3 backpack
Who gives a shit? They have the money for it.
Best way to prepare for the end? Repent, love God with all of your heart, soul, strength, and mind, love your neighbor as yourself (every living being is your neighbor), and treat others how you would like to be treated. This is what Jesus teaches. Pretty simple.
im not really worried about the end of the world scenario, but i have been thinking about preparing an emergency kit once i have been working for a year or two. \nwhile i say emergency kit, im basically talking about having a chest that contains a hiking bag, some long term survival tools (flint or lenses, strainer, survival knife etc.) a one man tent and food that stays good for a long time etc.\nbecause even if there might not be an apocalyptic event happening in our lifetime it is better to be prepared for catastrophes such as war or famine that will not happen rather than not being preparred if it actually do happen.
Why did trump come in this video at all. Lol.
Boo hooo, The rich have bunkers and I have to fend for myself.  Guess what, you are not their responsibility.  It's their money and if they wanna spend it on a plan B in case things go south it's their prerogative.
The rich are so out of touch with how normal people live. The 'apocalypse' means a change in their way of life. That change being they're not leeching off the people any more
You guys are like a discount version of Superfruit\nMitch = Mitch\nGreg = Scott
The world isn't going to end, we are. The world will shake us off like a mild cold.
Making fun of trump is gonna get you raped by little kids in the comments...
Leave new Zealand alone man... that's like the last place where politics and stuff aren't disgusting...
The hosts self righteousness is so cringeworthy.
I love you guys❤ you helped me love science❤
What stops security turning the guns on the rich. Honestly 😂🤣😂 why would I protect you. For what?
All the signs In the Quran about the end are coming true too.
Fuck...these guys are just blatantly politically one sided now. You do realize that some of your viewers might be conservative, right? I was wondering why I was unsubscribed and now I remember. Stop alienating a whole chunk of your viewers and just get the channel back to how it used to be.
When society falls, pot farm. Everyone’s an instant friend. A friend with weed, is a friend indeed.
I've been hording the absolute essentials in case of civilization collapses , Toilet paper and WEED.
God damn I wonder what political party you guys chose. Fucking losers
This is one of the most retarded channels in the youtube.I am hoping that the apocalypse arrives soon, so you won't survive beta cucks.
Im poor. Who wants to join me for a raider party.
These two are so stupid i swear
You can demonize anyone but I bet some Puerto Ricans wish they could have prepped.
Meanwhile both of the two in the video are millionaires who have more money than any of the viewers here, and have not given you any money or help.   Pure hypocrites with liberal agendas.
I remember in the 90's I used to get property for sale catalogues sent to me from ads in the back of magazines I was always trying to get people to chip in with me to buy old missile silos which were very cheap then , I knew there would be a great use for them one day , now I could sell them to Rich cunts for loads of money , and then also no where they all are for the end of the world to pillage with my band of mad max mutant people I'd have following me !
You really need to sit on your hands
The days when men were men and women were women, what happend!
This is so pretentious.
If you're rich buy a condo for the rest of us oh but them buying for themselves is wrong? Lazy assholes
Survival of the richest
What's wrong with Trump
This is the most *cringe* worthy video on the internet. Congrats :/
Isn't the most used language in new Zealand Dutch ?
So we're all just gonna ignore the fact that he's wearing a scouter in the thumbnail?
The being rich makes them guilty and insane..... fucking idiots
I just got a pocket knife under my pillow and a Pringles can in my drawer
Fuck these two guys, they’re assholes who hate people with money
I live in New Zealand 😆😆😆
That white guy is an embarrassment to men everywhere.
The rest of us crumble.\n\nNo, just you.
Uh, I hate to be the one to awkwardly point this out, but your political bias is showing.
After the revolution comrades shall go to New Zealand to rid the world of what is left of the capitalist class.
Rapture my friends 💕 Our Lord is coming soon! God bless you all! 😄
You don't have to suffer the great wrath of God. Put your trust in Jesus and salvation is promised. I overdosed in 2013 and was brought into the glorious presence of God. Jesus Christ is the truth! God is Love and Light. I made a testimony video if anyone wants to watch. God bless you all in the name of the Lord, Jesus.
except that there are waaaaaaaay more poor people who prep for disasters than wealthy
3:48 but.... I can't whistleblow..... guess I'm just gonna die then
Haha Trump bad! Right guys? Please give me likes and views because of my left wing opinions!
This type of prepping, with stockpiling and stuff will only last a certain amount of time. However, developing skills will keep you going indefinitely.
this is a trash vid
Just need a Vault.
This bunker company, is really getting me a vault tech vibe, like the bunker is going to do experiments...
Atlease now I know were suzan collins got her idea for district 13 from.
Watch a video on my channel CJ Collins
What if I can’t whistle
This is what we can do to survive Armageddon.\nhttps://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/watchtower-no6-2017-november/survive-armageddon/\nI guess it's getting closer as more of us are getting aware of this :o
Money is the least interesting form of wealth.
The music is a bit loud / distracting
good job blaming everything on trump and people who are good with money.
Christ is coming soon. No life hack would work. Believe in Jesus
Your politics are showing
Why would they be guilty? Also why is Trump a factor in our crazy toward apocalypse world? Trump does not equal end of all life because he was elected. If I was part of the 1% I would not feel a single damn thing about the rest of you while I survive.
I don't need to prep. \nI'm just gonna go into the first disaster I see, and *die*
With Trump, natural disasters, North Korea... Jesus Christ, I don't even like the guy but the number of people finding every excuse to put him on the same list as a fucking hurricane is pathetic.
if I were rich I would give my money way to all of you liberal cry babies so you can stop crying about he's not my president or I need other people to do this for me and I need more rights because this or that happened to people I don't even know hundreds of years ago so SHUT THE F UP
obumer is the one who well help bring do America. obumer is not only a LYING TRAITOR PIG, but he's also a minion of the Antichrist. Lol, which is probably why he's a LYING TRAITOR. EVIL PIG!!!
Why is Trump a reason for people to prepare for societal breakdown? I think liberals fucking everything up is good enough for me...
Re: the reddit guys eye surgery--as someone with such bad eyesight that I would be disabled w/o prescription eye wear,  it totally makes sense to think about being able to see during a disaster. I've definitely thought of it, and I'm just a regular person. I'd be dead super fast if my glasses broke or couldn't be replaced in a disaster. Surving as a blind person is probably next to impossible in the wild. Just playing devil's advocate on that one...
IMHO these guys are overly flamboyant, a real turn off.
Vault-Tec 😧\n\n2:03
Nothing wrong with trump
MORE EVIL DRUMPF !!!
Stop chatting shit geeky fooks
Nuclear weapons are a hoax dipshit
You guys suck
Now im getting paranoid...should we prep too?
Bugmen, smug now; dead later.
Why are they bashing trump?
Commie alert
Bum boys yuk . Spot the aids victims 🤣
Where's Fetta
We're gonna get purged.
Did you say Silicone Valley?
Fallout
Was that a dragon ball z scouter lmo
Also, a scouter? Really?
Dude with the glasses wouldent survive
Keep Jesus close. God bless Trump
You guys are obnoxious af
With trump kys

I feel like Nikki has seen the blank annoying blank for 4 minutes straight videos on YouTube and I think she's making facial expressions on purpose just so people make videos of her being annoyed by Jaclyn
Such a fun video! ❤️❤️
They are using your face to sell $15 hair extensions on Pinterest. You probably know already but there you go
When you yourself have to do your makeup in 10 mins every Saturday morning for work 😂🤣

Omg both of them together 😱😱
hahah that ninja brush! 😂 I need that skill for when I am rushing! hahaa xxxx
When Jaclyn and Nikkie both think their brows look bad and yours look like that every day lmao 😂 Nikkie really did look like she could have been in a high fashion ad though haha

No hate for these twooo. They jammed so good 😍
This is actually such a funny video I can't stop laughing nikkie and jaclyn are such a perfect combination for collabs
Stressed out Jaclyn looking for the bronzer is me 90% of the time 😂

Lol you guys should’ve just put a countdown timer for six minutes instead of waiting for four minutes to pass by. Lmao 😂 \n\nLove ya still! ❤️
hey could you do a bomb ass halloween makeup tutorial. maybe a sexy one inspired by pennywise from IT.
I love how they sat and waited for the timer to hit 4 minutes rather than restarting timer and it running to 6 minutes to equal 10  minutes haha. Love them
*Couldn't you just deduct the 4 minutes and just set your timer for 6 minutes? Not trying to be rude.....i know yall were panicking lol!*
Is Nikki using the Korean brand primer
What was the red lip that Jaclyn used?
Was already subscribed but omg I'm in love with them together
When the stuff in the back looks like a coffin and top piece ....
Hey love, can you make a current favorites pleaseee!?!🙏🏻❤️
I can barely do a basic make up look in 10 minutes! #envious
Wow I think Nikkie looks amazing in the beginning :) glowing from within
Nikkie is so fucking funny i love her😂😭😭
I feel bad about the n word thing u we're both wrong in my mind u guys r not perfect people and other people have to understand that

Hilarious 😂❤️
What Lashes Are Those ?
What color lip is Jaclyn wearing???

I usually don’t like Joslyn Hill’s videos but this was really enjoyable lol
Literally the best video I've watched in months ♡
This was SUPER CUTE!!!!!! I LOVE IT!
I've dreamed for this moment to happen and finally it did. My two most favorite make-up guru in one video.
For 10 minutes they look beautiful
Why didn't they just continue on for 6 more minutes, instead of waiting for it to go to four minutes again?😂😂
where can I find a cross necklace like her??
I love both  looks...love you guys❤💋❤💖💋💋💋
Anyone know what brand is Jaclyn's lip color from? It's the perfect red 😍
Jaclyn you are not funny your make up looks so so freaking good compared to my 3 hr makeup!!!!! How can that be!! 😥💔
Omg! I love it 💖🤣😗😗
The pianist's song choices are so delightful! I heard Abba, The Beach Boys and a swath of musicals in there, and I'm sure there were more. What a treat. 💛
Can we take a minute and appreciate the pianist?? What an amazing job :) :)
Oh, and Fumi Kaneko looks stunning and incredibly elegant as always. I'm so glad she recovered from her injury!
I just adore Alexander Campbell!  He is both a magnificent dancer but also seems like a gentleman!
Thank you ROH so much for giving us this wonderful treat every year! It's so special.
I squealed when Alexander Campbell appeared.
That girl at 57:55 who just skips off like NOPE, I don't know what's going on at all! is literally ME every single time we get to petit allegro in class. I love her reaction though.
oh my god, mamma mia into rhapsody in blue. so perfect!
Vadim😍. So, so elegant, even in class.
Seeing Sarah lamb and Fumi great ballet dancers
Thank you for this video!!♡
Every year there's someone pregnant hahaha!
Simplesmente maravilhoso !  Excelentes bailarinos e belíssimos coreógrafos.
Thank you soooo much for the video!! It was a great day! :-)
Okay.. so I was impressed with the pianist but saw others had already mentioned him in the comments and figured I wouldn't add to it--until he played the tutti opening of tchaikovsky's piano concerto... this guy is amazing!!!
I practice ballet in Panama
Sae Maeda already stands out and she’s one of the newest. I knew she was going to be something when I saw her perform at Prix de Lausanne. Cannot wait to see her perform principal roles someday!
Does anyone recognize the tune at 53:48?
1:30 into the tape is a fantastic ballet
Why wasn’t Yasmine Naghdi in class? I was really looking forward to her in class this year, she’s so lovely! So happy she was promoted to Principal this year!!
Olga makes all this up? Someone let her choreograph her own ballet please👍👏👏😂
I love all the different styles of their clothes :D
Thank you SO MUCH for the videos! Couldn't watch it live but I've now watched this afterwards 2 times already!
What's the song at 37:40??
What’s the song at 01:30:00?
After the last year's disastrous presentation by Darcy, the World Ballet Day has become immensely enjoyable again. I love Kirsty and Alexander's supportive attitude towards their great colleagues.
I love watching Olga teaching. She's so nice and vibrant. She pays so much attention to the details and to each and every dancer. The dancers seem to  like her very much, too!
My favorite time of year, I just love watching World ballet day with the royal ballet every year
look at the men in the Royal Ballet their feet their bodies their technique their turns Etc and look at the men in San Francisco Ballet and it is so embarrassing for sfb these days
(if only the commentators would stop talking...)
You know I noticed that the Royal dancers were all very honest with their turn out. I recall watching some Russian ballet company classes last year the dancers all had their feet 180 flat in first position and one dude even had his toes pointing backwards in second position - a bit freaky to be honest. There are many things I adore the Royal Ballet for and now I discovered one more. It is my favourite ballet company of all : )
I Love😍 World Ballet Day!💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
God, my calves are killing me just watching those 16 rises  😭 😭  Relevés and frappés were my most dreaded exercises in ballet lmao
I always love Royal Ballet's class in World Ballet Day :)
At 1:09:45 the music is I could have danced all night from My Fair Lady. And at 1:10:55 My favourite things from The Sound of Music.
Whoops! I spelled her name wrong. I meant to write Yuhui Choe.  Is she still with the company?
As good as calf rises are they should be doing it turned out , so they don't bulk up muscles that aren't needed when the legs are turned out.
I love this company and Olga's classes so much ❤
The pianist likes his musicals!
I always love the live stream on world ballet day! ❤️
what a wonderful teacher, i also love her barre combinations!
What’s the music for the dreamers ever leave you ??
My eyes always go straight to Sarah Lamb whenever she's on screen. Olga is also such a great teacher, I'd love to have a teacher as sweet and straight to the point as her.
Could I get any information about musics in this video?
I loved what O'Hare said - we can do more together to bring awareness to ballet as a vital art form than we can each standing alone. Collaboration among art companies in the US has always seemed too politicized to work, as each is trying to beat out each other for limited funding, etc. Everyone seems out for themselves a bit. Worldwide there seems to be a lot more opportunity to come together and be a stronger louder voice that's needed to keep critical arts like ballet alive and thriving as we are stronger together than apart. This is such a lovely experience every year, thanks to ROH and all the companies that share intimate coverage of their beautiful creations, dancers, and processes.
I am an aspiring ballet dancer and watching this really inspires me.I hope I can be there with you one day.Every year is better than before.Congratulations!
squealed when i saw vadim - love that guy!
There's something hypnotic about watching class.  Fumi looking drop dead gorgeous here.
Can we talk about Steven McRae at 44:15?
Absolutely wonderful! Every year is better! Crazy music, fantastic: classic, jaz, pop (Abba's Mamma mia!). Love
The class of Olga Evreinoff is very fun. But I am waiting for Brian Maloney's class. Can I see his class again? Is Brian a class teacher in World Ballet Day 2018?
ROH channel, thank you for uploading the whole thing! I never get to watch it live. This is my favorite stream from the World Ballet Day!
Does anybody else just LIVE for videos like this, because they can't take ballet themselves?
I so appreciate the pianist's inclusion of Monty Python's Lumberjack Song
Who's the guy in the black tights and white tank top that looks like it has bananas on it?? I'm really enjoying his dancing.
I just missed Natalia Osipova in class :(
Love the sound of music in there
I find ballet dancers fascinating because of their commitment to hard physical work coupled with their artistry.  I admire each dancer's accomplishment to get to this level.
1:02:22 is so me when i screw up and 1:02:50 is me when i think i'm at the club when i'm in class
Oh! I was so glad to see Nadia in the first class! If she is into her apprenticeship then I wish her the best of luck for a contract!
I love how this year they keep the camera on the dancers so you can still follow along while they're commentating instead of going to the commentators and missing part of the warm up class.
I hear a Swiss song as training melodie :) at 1.06---- Vo Luzärn uff Wäggis zue :)
Steven McRae's chaines at 44:18 holy crap!
I love how the pianist went from Là ci darem la mano (Mozart's Don Giovanni) to Wagner's Treulich geführt (Wedding march) What an irony.
They guy at 1:02:23 is literally me everyday 😂
Love to see all the dancers.  They work so hard and create such beautiful art.  Grateful for their dedication.
What's the song at 1:30:00 ?
Olga's class! Love it!
The talent of the young dancers from the Royal Ballet School is amazing.
I love Olga!
Steven McRaes but😍😍
Leticia Stock, so beautiful!
Marianelaaaaa!!!!! <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Where is Yuhui Choe pls?
AWESOME!  I ADORE BALLET.

Olga -amazing teacher
Love this ! Delicious !
Tchaikovsky pdd😍
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 amazing
J'aime !
Annoyed that I didn't get any notices that this was only on Facebook and not streamed on Youtube too. Not everybody likes fb or wants an fb.
Does osipova appear somewhere?
Ahhh <3 <3 <3. The pregnant ballerina is definitely goals!!! :D xxxx
1:16:15 'cause its just not World Ballet Day without Nela :)
Love Vadim!
Who is the Asian male dancer in the black socks and green tights?!
Horrible! Royal Ballet is a piece of shit
talk the talk .... you'd think they'd sort the picture quality oot        , shabby cunts         . love the dancers tho
Sadly no Natalia Osipova, she's been with TRB since 2013 - never seen her dance live or in the cinema, boo hoo :-(
do they dance at their own time..
when will this be deleted??
38:30 men's butt in tights...
Can anybody tell me what the song at 30:20 is?
EEEEEK!!!! Alexander has a hairy chest AND a nice ass!!! (jumping and screaming like a fangirl with panties falling on the floor).
Steven Mccrae😍 hope i spelled that right
Talking about the rehearsal of the Caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland, the guy in purple (Fernando?) is definitely not as good as Eric Underwood in this role back in the original production. Maybe he's still young and has to learn but Eric's Caterpillar was just so much more sexy and fascinating and his movements much softer, bigger and more elegant and worm-like.
Только не прыгай, Вадик! XD  36:48
The nearest zoo was in Seattle (I’m from Idaho😂😂) and then there was a tiny airport with literally one room that we shared with the neighboring(and rival) collar town
this has the distinct vibe of this is my milwaukee, except not as creepy.
my small town dosent have a cheese cake factory that's for the big city's lol
i just love the fact they think this illuminati stuff is still funny or staring controversy , THAT makes me laugh :), this vid is nice overall, but THAT cracks me up.
at least my home town just added a pot shop
Psh, my hometown has none of this
interesting video...grass is always greener on the other side mooo! lol
We actually have that one nice mall with a Cheesecake Factory 😂
lol we dont even have a mall and its technically a city :D
this is literally just a copy of an snl joke commercial
I'm glad my hometown isn't that big.
My town isn't even that big
Jokes on you. Theres a Topgolf in my home town!
Was grant from Utah?
What's with the Illuminati sign appearing in every video. Is it a joke?
I think I've seen this before..... just not sure where though...
i'm from NYC and I went to a state college in a small town so it was literally opposite for me hahaha fuckin hated my college town but 8 years after graduating from college, i kinda SORTA miss it. not really.
That awkward moment when you see your middle school crush as a teen dad...
The only thing my hometown has is a Walmart, Krogers, and a bunch of drunks that still hang out with the same group since high school.
My hometown is so small, it doesn’t have any of these things
What with the illuminati shit in all of their videos
no one is mentioning the split second illuminati symbol
Did I see a pyramid with an eye in the middle of a shot?
i love all the illuminati pictures they flash in all of their videos
Arlington Texas man.. I gotta get out of here
I went on a three week trip home for a friend's wedding and this... sums it up more than I wanted or needed. Depressing! \n\nRotterdam back to Indiana was strange.
What if the bowling alley already burned down?
Am I the only one who went back to try and pause on the Illuminati?
um i was born in the capital of sweden why am i here\n\n\nHelp me find the way to the Visit the tourist destination of sweden now! video\npls
My crappy hometown doesn't have a zoo, a mall, or an airport (what town has a fucking airport???). If you want entertainment go buy some laced pot from the homeless guy outside the library.
It's somehow less walkable here than either a small town OR big city XD so true, I don't even need a car in the city, home town is so spread out the slightest errand is somehow a 10 mile round trip
when your home town is actually crappier than that one...
Man... kind of puts things in perspective being that my hometown has like a million people and in the top 15 of the country. Annnnnd no, I don't live there.
Go to google and type: *gamesecrx guide* You'll get the only 100% working secret fully FREE for the game.
My local mall doesnt have a cheesecake factory, all 3 of them. \n:(
not gonna lie, that thumbnail looks like Stevie T
I'm still trapped in this shithole. The town you described looks like a metropolis compared to this... pile of nothing.
Whose crappy hometown actually has a mall, a zoo, a bowling alley, an airport with 3 gates, a sports bar, and all that other stuff he mentioned? Mine ain't got none of that.
My hometown didn’t even have a traffic light....
Lol mall, zoo I wish my town was that big
“Bowling: That’ll kill some time” never a more accurate description of bowling.
This was funnier when it was snl... and that's saying something.
the nice mall, ya know the one with the cheesecake factory relatable AF
Damn! Moving out at 18 really got me there for some strange reason, I'm 20 and I still live with my parents.
Loved the bit about public transit. Prob no nice stop shelter like that though lol.
You should see my hometown, there’s a killer shapeshifting clown in the sewers
Move To The google search And Type: *FreeCodesXXX* It happens to be the only working FIFA 14 coins working these days. Never waste your entire free time in some other applications
The accuracy of this was eerie..
I now feel slightly better over my hometown which is one of the major cities in the US. I've never thought of how little things to do other places had.
People in the comments talking about how their hometown doesn't have a zoo...my whole COUNTRY does not have a zoo. Yeah we have that place in the capital and some similar one in the countryside where you can go and see sheep, cows, geese, pigs and such but that is it....
So true about the mall / airport / accommodations.
They are doing a lot of weird commercials lately. XD
Woah I can't relate to any of these, born and brought up in London...
That feel when your hometown isn't crappy and is already a destination people from all over the globe travel to visit..
My crappy hometown doesn't even have half of the stuff they said. 😂
My home town(s): Akron, Ohio, USA! Or North Canton, OH, USA!\n\nCome to Akron, they have the ZOO! And they... they have... You can get MUGGED! Yay, crime!\n\nCome to North Canton! No zoo, but a very nice mall! With a HOT TOPIC! North Canton has an AIRPORT! One city away, that is. Plus, low crime! Yay!\n\nPick one. Get mugged at the zoo or go have fun at the mall.
Yeah I went to visit your crappy momma too
Google Yardley, Pennsylvania. That's where I'm from
Or just chill with your high school friends cause all their dumb asses went to community college or crappy state schools?
How did he some how accurately describe my hometown, even though I like it better then where I am now.
Had to drive 30 minutes to the real mall. The mall in town only had 3 places to go. We did have a Wal-mart though.
CH: You're a loser if you don't live in a big city!
What if your hometown is Las Vegas
Ahh small town America, it's the Pallet Town for venturing white millennials.
Very funny! Could have said more about the lameness of the small town bar scene; under-age and/or under-educated people standing around watching MMA. Bunch of kids still living with mom + dad closing down the bars each night, or getting thrown out of them for fighting.
and yet still my shitty home town i joined the damn army to get away from still doesn't suck as much as LA :)
My hometown is a massive tourist destination, so visiting is only crappy when I just want to go to the beach and 50 million American's are there escaping their crappy home towns.
I don't even have a hometown
Just did, we don't have a Mall or bowling
My home town has woods.  I love it.
I'd go there.....I have none of these things in my hometown
Come to my hometown where you can either go to the BBQ that doesn't clean the grill or to the dentists office. If you don't like those two things just stay home.
Is the obsession with moving out of your home town just an American thing? We don't really have anything like that here in Australia. Interested to know if it's like that anywhere else in the world.
My highschool is a parking lot and there was no mall or club or even sports bar...
Wire busy door vs stick business chemical state.
Well, my hometown is one of world's top tourist destinations, so it is not really about me :) (privilege checked) ;)
my hometown has a courtesy bus for over 60's wishing to visit the local lawn bowling club. The bus operates between 4-8pm on weekdays and 10am-9pm on weekends. The poor bastards getting on the bus usually spend the whole time at the club gambling away their life savings on the poker machines until their middle aged children find out that their elderly parents are spending all their valuable inheritance, and the elderly i metioned earlier are placed into a retirement villiage or nursing home.
Oh wow your hometown had roads? What is this it had clean air? I never had clean air growing up! I'm so jealous
I moved to your hometown, mine sucked.
I wish my hometown had a Cheesecake Factory in the nice (and only) mall!!! You have to drive all the way to Atlanta for a Cheescake Factory!!
An airport!? AND A MALL!?
We don't even have any of those where I live...
I grew up in manhattan 😊 love living here still
My hometown has 12 churches, 7 gas stations, a few different fast food chains, some failing local restaurants, and oh yeah, 12 churches.
Visit bars
heheheheheh i got u #3 wit ilumtittiiyy thing clvr
Macon, GA....

oh you don't live in a big city you go fucking die you plebes. I mean i live in the I.E. and most of what he said was true in a way but i like a bit more satire then hahahah you live in a bedroom community and get the runoff of the big cities like L.A.
Is he talking about my home town? Our mall got an H&M only a couple of years ago
I could eat a really unhealthy burger right now.
It's even more depressing when you realize the exaggerated-for-humor description of a crappy home town is still cooler than yours.
my hometown doesn't have a airport or a zoo or a nice mall. i didn't get out when i turned 18 either, i'm still stuck here
Before 1 M

Her hair is usually on point but THIS wig is a NOPE!
That man don't want full custody of that child he just wants to get at Keyshia to hurt her because he's hurt that she don't want his lying, cheating bum ass no more and she's over it. Keyshia not gone let him have full custody and take her child. That child is just $$$ signs to him. She's already being fair with him which some men don't even get, now he's being greedy. What a way to treat a woman after she let you live in her house when yo ass had nowhere to go and you cheated on her, but she still had heart enough to not want to see you on the street, and this how you repay her🤦🏾‍♀️. Karma is a bitch in the end.
Brooke how can u be booby bff and u never had a relationship as an Aunty figure to his child? Very odd.
That hair🤔😑
Keyshia Cole is a dime. But she's wearing a Darth Vader helmet hair hat!\nHer hair stylist should be tarred and feathered!\nShe looks like a 50's pornstar that sucks dicks on roller skates beside juke boxes.
Her hairstyle overshadowed her ☹️
I love keyshia but this hair is not it. It looks dry and old
She need to throw that wig away looking like Frankie 😩
All the wigs in the world and this is one we pick
For one, who the heck is Boobie? And two, why is his name Boobie? 😂 😂
Guess SHE NEEDS a second season on that garbage show love & hip hop ! This will be her STORYLINE ! Smh
That wig makes me angry
This conversation is stupid like why should she care this was really a waste of time next
She is beautiful  but I need to see her face, she need a better stylist
Get jhene aiko on th real!' Make her talk. Too!!
These wigs, that she only wears to the real is so bothersome, last time her wig was hideous
Keisha’s hair...🤦🏾‍♀️
she has feelings for that man still.
Y'all are so beautiful and I look up to you and we share laughs
Love Keish She is about her child and he is #1 in her life.
He is a good daddy
So let me see she took care his ass wen he lost his nba job n cheated on her n still took care him while he was so called gettn his rapp career on .and he got nerve to fight her for custody .how he plan to take care of his child with no income...... Oh wait let me guess he  want that keshia money .lmao smh boy bye grow up get a job split custody of child n be on your way !!!!! She aint buggn u for nun be with who u wana be wit n just co parent rightfully  like half the world does .or should in that matter .lbvs
If we only would have gotten 10% of this Keyshia on the show.....
I think Keyshia is bringing her own style...even if the wig is big, it wasn't ugly especially on Keyshia
She looks different these days skin color wise
I love Keyshia Cole but baby she needs a better hairdresser. 🙅
SORRY.... But gurlll tht WIG doesnt want to do her job on u gurll..
Oh Keisha you are with Floyd...leave Booby alone
She reminds me of this gay chick who hit on me a few years ago, I regret not trying it, she was sexy
Her bangs are too low; you can hardly see her eyes. How does that not annoy her?!?
Don't like her hair it looks too much.. wig
I don’t think she’s over Gibson 🤔
I have no respect for Brooke. She stay dealing with a married man!!
I love that she's coming out her shell more!
whats going on with the hair keyisha
That damn wig make her look like she just turned 70
wth is on her head?
she regret putting him on the show Keisha Cole you a strong women
I luv u keyshia what's going on with the hair
Keyshia Cole is so real, she needs her own show again.
I love Keyshia but that hairstyle doesn't suit her well.
I didn't even recognize her
I like Keyshia, but someone needs their a** whooped for putting that Elvira wig on her head. Most of the season, she's been giving me Morticia Addams teas. Wtf?!
That wig...ohhh god. Let's try again.
Love me some Miss Cole  <3♡♡
Keyshia girl. Why is your bang so thick? The whole wig overall really. It's swallowing your whole face. Can't barely see your eyes.
That’s hair on Keisha 😮 um
I still laughing at Jeanies corny ass dancing when she comes out
I love keyshia but gurrrrl this wig😔😔😔 no ma'am
Short and to the point
There's a person named boobie?!?! Omg 😂😂😂😭
It's funny Boobi and Brooke felt the need to get closer on Love and HipHop. Sooo there wasn't an incline of sexual feelings between them before and during k and B's marriage?\nHhhmmm..ok....\n..random
I clicked when I saw that wig! Damn that's horrible
they need to start posting full shows clips suck
Omg i so just thought this was k Mitchell smh
Who did her hair like that??
That wig or whatever on top of KCole Head looks crazy!
Beautifully stated!!
Wtf is wrong wit Keysha hair
Tf her wig doing??? 👀
Keyshia is so bitter 😑
Damn keyshia hair ugly
ytf she up there lookin like Judy Jetson
she said brooke valentime
YOU ARE DEAD
That hair though.
Her hair 🤢
LooooooooooVvvvvvvvveeee Keisha💚💚💚💚💚
Her wig tho lol
“No” lol
Keisha hair, ni hao kylan -ish
Keisha baby, who's your stylist?
I agree with Keyshia Cole 100%
Love lonis jet black hair 😍😋
Ikr keyisha u don't got one wit my child. So basically Brooke Whoooo #Ooooh lls
Did Loni just say Brooke ValentiME? 😑
Keyshia, I love you. But you gotta fire your makeup artist and hair stylist. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Keyshia hair is cute 1:12 ❤️ hair behind her ears 😍😍
Those bangs ugh\nI cant see Keyshia's pretty face
Boobie doesn't want full custody, he just wants that spousal support and if he gets custody it'll be ammunition. Smh, SAD.
Valentime Loni, Really?  I'll bet you celebrate Valentimes day also.
LOOKS SOOOOOOMUCH LIKE K. MICHELLE
nah I can't..you seriously have to know who you're having a child with.
Keisha kole is really not as intelligently sophisticated in her communication as i thought. She sound like shes slow asf w a hidden clingy demeanor. # unmasked
+The Real Daytime come on now I don't even cable right now I have basic channels so I won't be able to watch the show on VH1 or in the daytime because I'm in school... and I was really looking forward to Girl Chat atleast... and this week we've only been getting one girl chat a day I atleast wanted two ?
That hair looks like it’s overwhelming her head but I agree with her on the custody thing. I’m shocked she’s being so damn mature about it, if only all parents were that way
Her skin becomes so white 😐😐
So we not talking bout her hair !  Im getting distracted by it
Ewww  I can't stand this talentless bitch!
How y'all manage to butcher her name when it's literally right in y'all face?  🤔
That Wendy Williams wig is a no Keyshia...😐😒
She looks so much like K Michelle here
I have a sister that looks like Keyshia!!
Call me a heater but Keisha Cole's jet black hair is what made me not watch this video
Did she get veneers ?
Stupid wig!
Grown Woman response
anyone who watches LHH is ratchet lol
You guys need to bring relevant guests to the show
Why she so pale?
Dayum, Glenn. You went full Shane and then leveled up fifty...take a chill pill! ;)
OMG this movie is fuckin' scary!!! I love it
Reminds me a cross between the Belko Experiment, and Quarantine
Previously, on Walking Dead... no wait...
wonder if he'll find a dumpster to hide under....?
So he did really hide under the dumpster!
Yuen in a virus movie.  Awesome.  I have never seen him in anything like that.  Bold career choice, Steven...
Negan hit him so hard that he will keep bleeding for the next two movies
I miss his face! I gotta watch this
Reminds me of that one movie that these people would kill office employees unless the employees would do the killing for themselves.
Twist is probably something like the virus didn't make people violent at all. Somebody respond to this in like a couple months.
This is like a retarded version of Fight Club.
chill out we do this everyday in our office killing each other fighting each other backstabbing each other from  8.30 am to 5.30 pm
Kudos to Steve Yeun, he chose an interesting movie to star in. I'll see it.
I don't get it but I love Steven so...I love it.
Glenn died in TWD and woke up in a corporation in the afterlife to fuck shit up as revenge.
hey wait a sec. Negan smashed his head in. Otherwise this is totally legit.
The type of movie that will desensitize you to blood.
What the hell is Glenn doing?
Glenn still looks like he just got out of the negan beating hahaha
Oh glenn, you're so much better than this.
subscribe or ill do it.......
I can't believe how many people have seen The Belko Experiment. I didn't know it was that popular.
i´m only watching this movie because of Steven
This looks like the belch experiment but better
I hope Steven kill Jeffrey Dean Morgan in this movie
Sooo... this is literally just a “Belko” movie. Or rip-off whatever.
It needs more Negan and Lucille, but it's ok
This is were Glenn went when he died
Isn't that Eugene a 1:28?
Can't he do a movie or TV show where his face isn't getting smashed?
another movie for pussies who dont dare to punch someone
Glad to see my chink back in action
Send help, I can't find the release date for this movie, I'm getting March 13th - 17, Oct 7 - 17, and Nov 10th - 17.
He become the walking Dead!
Glen didn't die, Lucille teleported him to another reality  now it makes cents
Oh man i  love to do this in my office.
It's like when you see Daniel Radcliffe in a non-Harry Potter movie
I like how this guy sees nothing but everything at the same time\n\n\n\n\nfor example the bat,\nbut on this trailer he kept his eyes opened (pun intended)
Steven Yeun is my new favorite actor
Looks better than the Belko Experiment.
Damn Glen.  You can't catch a break lol\nEven got Milton on here too lol
Milton's in this too a walking dead reunion
So you're going live in hell with zombies and now you're going live in hell with humans who have gone crazy
Belko Experiment 2.0
ricegum is you?
Office in Busan....
omg!!!!!! voy a verla
BAttle royal
1:47 This moment remind me something xDDD
Will watch this because of Glenn hahaha
Steven Yeung & Blood Violence: Love It!!
Jeez he hit you in the head that hard huh?
How does it feel killing your boss? Satisfying?
this is so BELKO EXPERIMENT..!!!!..bruhhhh
good thing he has all that training from killing the undead
The Walking Dead meets Corporate America.
The Belko Experiment.  Did like it when it was called that either.
What's the chance Steven Yeun will get his head beat in with a baseball bat in this movie?
Glenn: I'll find you.....................and crush your skull.
Glenn and Milton are in the same movie! Sick!!
oh man...this is gonna bomb. no one even liked the belko experiment.
This is literally TWD inside the Belko experiment
lockheed martin?
this bloody john wick shit
Glenn save maggie
Glen in earth 2
Oh shhhh its Gleen 😂
Hey keith
The Belko Experiment ripoff
Yo, Glen.....
28 days + Belko experiment + the office???
Glenn's Back, MOTHERFUCKERS.
Gleeeeenn!!!!
Welcome back Glenn!
Rage, Steve.\n\nRage.
Gleen is alive!!!
Glenn and Milton reunited
The belko experiment 2
More mindless violence 👎
Belko Experiment all over again
Hmm, ummmm...yes. yes yes! Will watch!
Looks like Glenn recovered just fine lol
Wtf?! Not gonna lie.. lookin forward to seein this 😂😂
negan must be so proud of glenn hahaha
Is she harley quinn?? Lol
I CANT WAIT😁😁😁😁😁
Looks awful dumb
Muggee Uhl find yoooo
Steven❤❤Glenn
0:23  Will Smith :)
Does it reminds me American Ultra?
So, we entertain ourselves with movies about people snapping and killing each other, and then we are suddenly horrified when it plays out in real life wondering how anyone could act like that.
Wait...really?  Asian lead in a major hollywood movie?
This film ALREADY came out
Isn't this The Belko Experiment?
Just when you think that homerun to the head couldn't get any wost. Huh, Glenn? Im glad he got his eye ball pop back in his socket tho AH HAAA HA HA HA! Were's Negan and Lucille when you need them? Am I right 😂😂👍👍
Fuck this shit up, Glenn. Show them who's the baddest mofo out there

God bless you all every one ☝️ I love going to church both really church and Eric church
Eric Church is the epitome of what a musician, a human being should be.  Heartfelt, he knows were he came from and respects it, and the fans who have found him.  Simply my favorite musician, and a human I strive to be.
I started listening to the Chief back during the Sinners like me Album, I kept trying to show him to everyone I could. The way he conveys his message is incredible and this song just shows it. I could have been there at that concert and am thankful I wasn't. He is truly the Chief! Eric Church is the real deal. He isn't like the other modern country artist, this man is real.
Excellent, beautiful, heart wrenching and pure art.
So now that every part of the American background has been affected can we talk about gun control? Insane how these guys have to sing about this...
4:12 tears started flowing. How can you not love this guy?
There is no better artist
You have a huge heart Eric.. God Bless you!!!
Heart of gold love his words in a song...he is truth and country music💕💕💕
Why so many dislikes?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Somerset Ky  shout out from the bluegrass..... we love you Eric  Church
Eric, I sense that you grasp the connection between all of us, so let me suggest this as the answer to your song.  Why not me?   I'd say, a part of you did die. As a part of all of us died.  We are truly all connected.
Brave performance and beautiful song. A fitting tribute.
Song I wrote for the tragedy that happened in Las Vegas. 🙏🏼https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1926598244024504&id=100000230425794
This is why Eric is my favorite and always will be. Thank you for sharing your heart Eric. Continued prayers to all affected. #churchchoir.  #prayers.
Thank you.  We needed to see this.  My cousin was there.  I'm sorry you had to go through what you did.  Glad you made it to the Opry that night.
I love this man!
Don't know about y'all but at 4:15 I broke down
He's amazing....if he read the bible hed know why the wicked pray on the good....God will put an end to it soon Death will be no more
he's famous now... #illuminati
Kevin Love?!?
Who 😢
God bless you Eric Church
Beautiful xoxox
That was amazing
How did this get 2000 dislikes
♡
so sweet
Yo crowd stfu hes trying to talk so annoying
I'm a huge country music fan! I've always loved Eric Church and love him even more after this! Made me cry....so heartwrenching! Beautiful song! My prayers and thoughts go out to Eric Church, all of the artists, fans, and their families that were affected by the Las Vegas tragedy!
No big deal here.
This is Eric Church.
Thank you Chief for helping us heal with your music.  You are incredible. From another one of your people & Church Choir member.
A new era is sure to come, it is definite and it is written.....And the kingdoms of this world, have become the kingdom of our Lord..
Eric Church you are a amazing man.  There is no artist like you.  You are a gifted man. Both artistically and personally.  Keep being you!!!
you are so amazing... I love you so much Eric. This broke my heart....
Tell the loudmouth in the crowd to shut up. Annoying
Great song rip the Vegas victims
I am so glad we have people like Eric.  He always says almost exactly what i'm feeling in times like these.  And he is so right. You can't kill music.  It's there and will survive as long as someone sings it.
country music sucks ! and great acting by singers!
I thought him Liam from 1D
I'm crying...thank you Eric for your heartfelt words and beautiful rendition...it helps in the healing... xx & prayers.
how could 2k ppl not love this man? I feel sorry for them, I truly do....
Such a beautiful, heartfelt performance and message ❤ I will forever be a fan of EC, he is a true artist who is truly in love with music. The best music in the world is the kind that speaks to your soul, brings tears to your eyes, and moves you deep inside ❤❤❤
What a beautiful tribute to those who lost their lives. As someone who was there, this is how we all feel!  Love you Eric!
Very sad..\nYour a true hero\nLove your songs\nLots of respect..\nLove you
Such a awesome artist. I have always been a church fan. Will forever!!

Eric, you are amazing and God Bless you for having the courage to get up on stage and pour your deepest, heartfelt feelings out.  So much admiration and respect for you <3
There's a reason why you were Sonny's guy! You are a class act Eric Church.
sonny melton was my best friends uncle and she just sent this video to me...
I went to Willie Nelson Sheryl Crow concert this summer & he played. I laughed at him & made fun of him (and his fans), he seemed phony & shallow. He is now a broken man. This is a beautiful song. Thanks for sharing💔
I know it's you Daniel tosh. Stop hiding behind them shades.
hi I do vlogs and if you sub to me my vids will be good quality and feel free to comment what you want me to do.
Above and beyond the best Country singer, has been for the past decade.
I tried to do a cover of this song on my channel.  Great song
Eric Church is the man!!
The Lord is coming for his church! Repent now before it's too late!

Donald Trump Won't Make America Great Again \n(Official Music Video On My Page)
A bunch of heartless SOB's disliked this video and song.
New song for me
Thank you Eric for everything. My mom and my dad were both shot. My mom will be okay but my dad is in the ICU in rough shape. Anyways, I kept being told that my dad absolutely loved your performance. Thanks for that bit of joy ❤️
It seems like we all knew someone who was there that night. I had a few family members there and some friends. Although they made it home safely they were not left unscathed. It hurts me knowing what they all must be going through. They too are hurting and will forever be changed. I saw this video and can't help but hope we can lift them up if only through our prayers and love. You're not alone and we may be strangers but we're all in this together.
Tosh.0?
I hate country music..but this okay I suppose..even though if he missed a few chords.
I would like you all to thank X-President Obama & Hillary Clinton for all the Violence weve been going through after our election of President Trump. They will answer to their sins & crimes against our people eventually.
If you decide to breastfeed, the first couple weeks of breastfeeding are the hardest and there’s such a steep learning curve, but if you are able to push through it, it’s definitely worth it. I will say that if you end up deciding breastfeeding isn’t for you and some people give you a hard time about it, remember that being a good parent is making sure your baby is fed. It doesn’t matter if it’s breastmilk or formula. Fed is best. Period!
I've just had my 5th baby, would love to see an anti haul or products you regret buying once you have this baby. It's surprising how many I wish I'd never bought! Your looking lovely x
If you chopped yourself in half... bahaha, i love how your sense of humor gets injected into whatever you're talking about. Such a chill gal!
You look great 😍😍😍
We found out we are having a girl she is due Valentine's day.
:D
Ovia ia great!  I use ovia fertility!  Great app :)
omg your skin is GLOWING <3
I love the moment Fleur casually drops: My baby is currently a Papaya. XD
if u plan are breast feed i would highly recommend a nipple cream, the ultra blam from lush works really well, and mama’s nipple butter are my go two’s both are very natural and i love the smell and feel of them... also a good breast pump, breast pads for milk leakage, and make sure ur chair is comfy enough to fall a sleep in, cause i most likely will fall asleep well feeding. i also found a nursing bracelet helpful, u switch from wrist to wrist so u kno witch breast to either start with or that u last feed from .
Watching this at 3.30 AM while pumping 😅🐄 #momlife
please name your girl Delilah after your first dance song, and matches your name!
Hi Fleur! Could you please do a pregnancy approved skincare and makeup?? It would be much appreciated. Congrats and thank you for all your work! ;)
my twin babies (a boy and a girl!) are three months old! :) I lived in maternity leggings the last month of my pregnancy. the thought of putting jeans on when i was that uncomfortable made me want to cry. so, for sure stock up on comfy, stretchy leggings! especially for when you are swollen towards the end. good luck!! best wishes!!
please try Bravado nursing bras. They are expensive, but they are the most comfortable bras, period!
Breastfeeding- I was recommended and used this little silver cups for your nipples. I know it sounds odd but silver heals the skin (you re-activate it by washing the cups daily with bicarbonate soda) They're called Silverette \n\nhttp://www.silverette.com/en/cups-how-to-use.php
Where is your moon/star necklace from Fleur? It is beautiful! Thank you so much for doing this video! Love hearing all the essentials and tips you've figured out along your pregnancy. I'm so excited for you! Btw your glowing! <3
I have the Ovia app too and i love how it shows you how big the hands and feet are by week
If you don't use fabric conditioner on stretchy jeans leggings etc they last longer. Conditioner ruins latex and other fibres used in stretchy clothes.
Hey Fleur :-) I use the same bras from Emma Jane (my son is now 6 months). I love them as well. I would say - if you decide to breastfeed - you should def get some wool nursing pads (Just a random webside: https://danishwool.com/collections/nursing-pads). It will keep your breasts nice and warm so that you won't get mastitis. Also lanolin balm is great for the nipples :-)
Just a tip for breast feeding. It was really difficult to get my Ellie to breast feed. We had just about had her trained when I had to go away on a business trip. Ruined everything. It's a lot of work to get a child to breast feed, so keep your schedule clear from flying/ travel that would take you away from her until your little one is completely on board with breast feeding (if that's what you choose to do).
The first pregnancy essential is.... who is the father!?
I'm going to have to look into the max vs plus because I'm wondering why anyone would want to take 3 instead of 2 tablets lol. 😵 I am sooooo in love with ur necklace would love to know where it's from please I'll be calling my bump Luna so I'm obsessed with moons! Xxx
Medela nipple shields and read as much about breastfeeding as possible.
Also with the ovia app, you get 4 choices of the baby size comparison! If you go to the settings, you can chose from fruits/veggies, silly animals, toys, and persian bakery items!
Jools olivers book Minus Nine To One is my favorite Pregnancy book. XX
have you decided what to do with your belly button piercing? you mentioned it in an earlier video and I can't remember if you came to a decision
You should download the Wonder Weeks app for when your bubba is born! It's sooooo helpful for knowing when your babe is entering a leap and gives you heaps of info of what to expect! X
Bra strap in the tea = great YouTube moment!
My bra straps been dipped in my tea 😂😂😂 love you fleur
An absolute essential is Massage oil for your perineal area to avoid ripping during birth 🙃
I'm 36 weeks. I use the Ovia App!! I find it the most entertaining. This week she is the size of a Cabbage patch doll. I am starting to get very uncomfortable. I have to go to the bathroom every hour some nights which is not very cool. But I guess it is training for the interrupted sleeps that I will have in the not so distant future.
Have you tried any of the H&M maternity wear or George at Asda? They look ok for workwear (shirts, trousers etc). Can find lots of jeans but not many proper trousers.
I would recommend lots of relaxation and sleep since you won't be getting much in the first few months! Keeping your stress levels low is key! A pregnancy pillow is a must have especially towards the end! Go out to restaurants and lots of movies as you won't get a chance to do that as much later! Also I would recommend packing your hospital bag early so you don't end up like me when my baby decided to come early and we were packing after my water broke! Keep an open mind about everything especially labour and birth! Most of all enjoy the pregnancy and savour this special time!
For once baby is here the wonder weeks app is amazing. Lets you know what stages they're going through at that time. (There is alot) like teething not sleeping etc. It really helped me when my little was growing up. He's 3 now the time really goes so quickly! Enjoy being pregnant it was the best time for me! Xx
'My baby is currently a papaya' 😂😂😂
I also had Ovia app when I was pregnant and liked it a lot :) I had my first baby at the end of August. Newborn essential I really like and I don't know if you have it yet is baby-vac...So funny, but it's a tube that you attach to your vacuum and you can clean a baby's nose with it so easily...Babies have stuffed noses so often, even if they don't have a cold and it's hard for them to eat with stuffed nose...Also treat yourself with massages, pedicures, etc. before the baby comes...:D
I don't know if you've already seen it but Whitney Port from the Hills has a YouTube channel vlogging her pregnancy and birth. As a momma myself I wish her channel was there when I had my daughter...she is so real and honest. I hope you will check it out :)
For goodness sake do your pelvic floor exercises!! In fact self-care in general is massively important when you have a baby (mine's 8 months now). It's very easy to let it fall by the wayside! \nTwo apps I would recommend for finishing off your pregnancy are Kegal Kat and Contraction Timer. The timer will let you track your stage 1 labour, which I found useful to help me decide when to go to the hospital. Also for the hospital I took a prepared playlist with me - it gives your brain something to focus on when the pain gets bad. Remember to take water and snacks for you and Mike! You'll both (mainly you) need your energy!
Ovia does show you fruit too! Just change what you want to see each week - you can switch between fruit & veg, weird animals, fun & games etc
Hi! I’m about a week ahead of you with a boy so it has been so fun watching your updates!! I have been loving super comfy pajama shorts since I get so hot at night and long tank tops with cardigans as it gets into Fall in the US. My skin has been super dry so I have been going through sheet masks like crazy! XOXO
There is an app called Sprout I think you might like. I’m due next week but feel ready now!
Super helpful video! I'm looking forward to getting some comfy maternity wear in the next month (it's early days for me). But I'll be checking out those vitamins today as I do want to take omega 3 as well 🙂
My little boy is six months and the most used things for me are muslins... Millions of them!!he spits up and protects us from having to change a million times a day.\nA basic light weight bouncer, I have two a tiny love rocker and napper(which is also brilliant as it lies flat)and a mothercare basic one as I can lift it one handed so if I need to go to different rooms or the bathroom its portable, I probably used it most for getting ready in my dressing room as he could see me and I wasn't running in and out of rooms to check him.\nA lie flat high chair, hauck do one and other brands(think stokke have new born inserts for theirs,they are very lush looking).bit more  pricier but great for sitting at table or in kitchen and eating and good way to get bubs used to seeing food getting made,eaten,sitting as a family.\nNot new born but my boy is now weaning and I live the Annabel karmel silicone freezer trays supper easy to batch cook and the weaning app on app store for ideas.\nHave loafs more but will leave it here...good luck xkx
Epsom salt baths when I got near the end 🙌
http://www.bounty.com/pregnancy-and-birth/pregnancy/pregnancy-week-by-week/20-weeks-pregnant this like but many more websites
I really loved the H&M maternity jeggings with the full panel that goes all the way up, way more comfortable in my opinion! Also during towards the end of my pregnancy I could not wear any sort of jeans/leggings I lived in maxi dresses!
Newborn essential - this is a bit of a strange one but the Phillips' 'Hue' light bulbs and hub have saved me with my nighttime feeds. You can control your lights with an app on your phone including a dimmer option so you don't need to get up and turn on bright lights at 3am, if you have a bedside cot, you won't even need to get out of bed! I am a wheelchair user so this has literally been the best thing ever!
★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★  ★★★★                            ★★★★★★★★★★★★\n*God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.*\n*He also promised to heal your body.*\n (Just ask Him)
Prenatal vitamins are so important during pregnancy and also if nursing.  Those pregnancy apps look fun to use 👶🏼😊
you are glowing Fleur, i loved Ovia when i was pregnant
This is pretty random, but I’m currently 18 weeks with my first, loving maternity jeans, but I miss tucking in tops!  Anyone else experiencing this? 😆
I'm soaking up every single pregnancy content that you put up lol, so so interesting
Number 1 essential when I had my baby girl: Fisher Price Rock n’ Play. She slept in it until she was 6 months old. It rocks and has a sound machine attached... folds up flat for travel. Super light and easy to move around from room to room. I think it was $75 US. So excited for you guys! My Ava is 19 months old and time is just flying so quickly. Being a mom is just the greatest gift 😊 Enjoy every second!
You might not be this far ahead yet for preparing but I highly recommend socks for labor and a lovely lip balm. I had long labors and forgot socks the first time and the air con is freezing and if you have gas and air your lips get so dry x
Yeah my name is Joni, glad you are enjoying my jeans!😅
Are you going to do a nursery tour soon? :D Pretty please!
I don't have a baby myself but im a caregiver and i'd say you need tons of biebs, specially if you care about your baby looking neat. You will need to change them often, for heavy drooling days (lol) i recomend you look for the ones that have plastic lining on the back so moisture stays away from her skin. Also all plastic when they start with food, spots find their way and are hard to remove!
For my third pregnancy I read Jenny McCarthy's Belly Laughs. It is an interesting read. It talks about stuff during pregnancy/birth that are taboo and I found it pretty funny and real.
You should try reading a parenting book called Bringing up Bebe, it's about French parenting techniques, and an American parent. It's really eye opening!
I'm currently 8 months pregnant and I just wanted to say first that I love your updates! Also that if you want to geek it a little more the book the first 6 months is a fantastic book for newborn Info, it's written by a midwife and it's an Australian book if you want to check it out. Xx
Fleur I am obsessed in watching Emily Norris videos. She has done baby essentials which I found really useful
I'm happy for you Fleur!☺
I am actually a nanny for a currently 9month old. But have been with him since he was 3 months.  The things that i would recommend are the BabyWise book by Robert Bucknam M.D. and Gary Ezzo!! The most incredible philosophy on sleep.  Its all about fitting a baby in to your life versus the other way around.  The parents i work for are able to live their normal lives, and know when their child while actually be sleeping versus having a new schedule everyday.  Also a dock-a-tot!!! and back is best sleep suits!
Great video! I'm just behind you at 25 weeks, and I've been loving the Palmer's oil for my belly. I need to try the tummy butter! And I've been reading Bringing up Bébé. Love the book so far. Great advice from an American ex-pat living in France. Hope you're enjoying your pregnancy! You look beautiful! xx
Do you think you and Mike  or just you will do a baby names we love but won't be using video?
pregnacare max is the best used it throughout my pregnancy.....
Two kids down, working on a third. Definitely buy (if avail in UK): Nose Frida, Kinsa Smart Thermometer (probe kind), coconut oil for breastfeeding, and a touch lamp.
I'm 23 weeks pregnant and I'm so glad im not the only freak obsessed with watching every newborn essentials video on YouTube haha
My son is now 18 weeks old and my essentials were my fit ball to bounce on as I got close to due date, soft sports bras for bed and night shirts a pose to pj's. when you pack your hospital bag make sure you take some pre made milk bottles I.e cow and gate etc inc saw it takes a while for baby to latch I had been awake for days and my son had tongue tie so our only way to feed him was formula to start.? I have commented before but aquanatal classes are the best thing I ever did for exercise and to meet other mums. My no.1 tip is to meet other people at antenatal classes that are due a similar time, no matter what you read nothing beats k owing other people are going through the exact same and it is the best form of support as a new mum, I never ever read a pregnancy book as it is such a personal experience you just learn and develop every day when baby arrives. enjoy every second of being pregnant, before you know it you will have the most perfect little person by your side but my gosh you will miss your bump after a while. It's honestly the best feeling in the world xxxx
Yes leggings are a must during the last part of pregnancy and if there is one thing to invest in for baby it's a good car seat and stroller hands down
I just had my baby girl last week!!' Definitely recommended sleepyhead ! You should do a 'favourite names' , 💯for the Topshop jeans x
Hey Fleur! Would you talk about how pregnancy has effected your relationship with Mike? All good if that's too personal though! Xx
I don't have kids yet but I really like your videos :) \nWhere are your necklaces from? They're SO cute.\nAnd I also love your iPhone cover - where is it from?
I’m 35 weeks I use the glow nurture app I find talking to other ladies due the same time as me reassuring
Have you been keeping a pregnancy journal? I've always considered keeping one when I get pregnant but I'm bot sure how time consuming that would be
Omg this was me last year- I can't believe how fast this year has gone. My little boy was born 27th December. Savour everything because you'll blink and miss it!!
On Ovia, at least in the US, you can  change the size comparisons. Mines currently toys, but you can change it to fruit if you want!
I'm 20 weeks pregnant, my essentials are also the pregnacare max and clarins body tonic oil for my tummy it smells amazing and last for ages!!! Xxxxx
Where is that moon and star necklace from!? So beautiful! For me i found bio oil actually was more effective for stretch marks based on my two pregnancies. Second pregnancy i combined the body butter with bio oil and saw a significant difference.
Loving the videos about your pregnancy, keep them coming 💕xxx

Hi Fleur, I think we are going to have babies around the same time! Xmas babies :) My essentials have been loose fitting dresses, baby apps The Bump and Ovia, Palmers cocao butter, and teas! First mint tea helped me with my gas in the evening but it ended up giving me more heartburn (was probably overdoing it) so I switched to Chamomile tea and drink it max once a day. Another thing I have been loving is watching pregnancy updates, newborn essentials and a day in the life with newborn videos on Youtube haha! Saludos
I’m 32 weeks pregnant with my 3rd and the biggest essential I can recommend is SLEEP!!! \nRelax and sleep as much as possible. Also, try a pregnancy massage....heaven!!
crazy but importent: Don't forget the dogs:) let them a good smiff of the baby before she'll arrive home xoxo
I’ve just noticed your audience is (also) growing at past the 1/2 million mark!  Congrats on keeping great content coming, including your wonderful pregnancy vlogs 💖
Would so love to see a baby names video from you!! Xx
Without plugging....I have filmed loads of videos on pregnancy and breastfeeding. It can be really tough and quite lonely. I found YouTube so helpful for any questions I had xxx
I'm 6months ahead. Wren is 16 weeks now. Postpartum essential; high waisted leggings that suck you in again because I felt like I was falling apart, so empty and flabby and most of my maternity jeans just let the flab hang out! These ones are most like the ones I had. \nhttps://m.topshop.com/en/tsuk/product/textured-elastic-ponte-legging-5855128\n\nBreastfeeding essential is support. All hands on deck to feed you and keep the tea and toast and pillows and blankets coming especially that first two weeks. It will hurt a lot until it doesn't. Cabbage leaves for engorgement work really well, surprisingly! \nBaby essentials; Vibrating bouncer seat, clevamama sleep pod, playmat with overhead toys, mirror for the car headrest. \nAnd the very first thing I ditched was my fancy over the shoulder nappy bag in favour of a backpack style handbag from primark. Throw it on your back, both hands free for baby. \nOh and keep getting baby clothes YOU love because you'll get SO many pink things or baby gear emblazoned with Daddy's little princess. x
If you are doings a name reveal, pls, pls, pls, Please do a sugar cookie name eveal
when is she due
I really hope you do breastfeed! It's the most nutritious and wonderful milk for your baby and there's nothing quite like it on Earth. Make use of lactation consultants too who can and will make your breastfeeding journey easier. \nMany women stop due to them thinking they're not producing enough, when in fact it's just the baby cluster feeding! Newborns eat constantly, it's their way of regulating your milk supply and will take around 12 weeks to establish. \nIf you haven't already, read up the science behind it all. It's incredible stuff! ❤️
My mom was pregnant in the very early 70s, and there wasn't such a thing as prenatal care in those days (no vitamins either). She lost a few teeth due to it, no joke (because I was taking all of the calcium out of her). I think it's essential to get these vitamins in and I'm glad they do this now and it exists!
Loved watching this even though I'm currently not pregnant 😍
Oh my goodness, I wasn't prepared for the fruit thing and you saying your baby is currently a papaya. :D
Currently my baby is a papaya... That made me laugh... So cute
hi  fleur ! how many weight have you gain ??
Which items are sponsored? The first one I'd say?
Are you sure you're normally a 32C Fleur? I was measured as a 32C recently and I'm quite busty for my petite frame. Either that or you just hide your boobs very well :-)
An Ad? Seriously?? Come on.
Hi bubz. Can i ask what lotion or moisturizer do you put on ayla's face? Shes so cute😍
Issac is so brave not to cry out for you guys during that thunderstorm.  I can tell that he was truly terrified.  Bubz, you are not that big actually.  Considering this is you second child, you could be a lot bigger!  You will be back in shape in no time.  The next time family  tries to body shame you, just smile and say thank you.  And if a stranger dares to go there, just let Tim handle it!  LOL Tim: Screw you, B__!!!!  AHHHAHAHHAHHHAAA
Oh my goodness I had to pause this video for a second to make this comment. Issac has the most cutest accent when he talks I love the way he says mommy and daddy, cutest little thing ever..okay continuing watching the rest of the video.☺️❣️🙈
I don't know about your family, but I find it ironic that the family members telling you you need to lose weight are usually bigger than you themselves, that's how you know they don't know what they're talking about 😂
The family hurt thing is so true, I cannot believe anyone would say that is so mean :-( I think you look beautiful..
4:58 That face makes my heart MELT TT-TT <3
Awww Ayla got your eyes bubz♡♡
Both your kids are adorable, and I love the body positivity you're expressing.  My relatives are the same way regarding my weight gain (which is really from stress eating because of studies lol), but it's nice to hear how you deal with it.  Ayla and Isaac are so cute!  Thanks bubz <3
Ive never comment but I just want to tell you I understand how you feel about the whole weight thing. Im 4'8 and have always weighed under 100 pounds to 110. I had a baby girl around the same time as your baby girl. Her name is Ahsoka Nohea born 7-11-17. My husband friends give him advise about my pregnancy but they were from wifes that didnt have the same difficulties I had. I was sick the whole time. My body expanded everywhere, shoulders, face, neck, sides and my feets were so swollen you could see the water coming out of my legs if you touched it. I had heartburn that no amount of tums could cure. I tried exercising but I could barely walk for 30 mins without having to sit down. I tried eating heathly but I would throw it up oh and water I would throw up too. My weight gain and the fact we were dealing with a big move made me very emotional. I'm just not losing the weight as fast as all the other mommies. Always i dont want this to be a downer but just know your not alone.
Celebrities use this fan!\nI don't really care lol.. \n\nHaha you and your family make my day! It was off to a very bad start, and watching you brings me so much positivity <3
So how old is Isaac?
I have that dyson vaccum machine too but ends up dying after a few areas of the house, then needs a long time to be fully charged Ahahahaha
Can someone explain what Bubz means by feeling condemned by a 3 year old? I'm just confused why she lied about Issac's age o.O??
Bubz, i have a question: if it is a cultural thing for your Chinese relatives to be blunt, wouldn't it be culturally okay to be blunt back at them? And just answer with something like yes, but I just had a baby and you are hurting my feelings? Or just it only go one way?
Can someone tell me what camera that is she’s using to vlog???
ayla bathing looks so much like Isaac when he was her age... omoooo so cute.. love them chubbchubb rolls
She's tiny. And her babies are born chubby and cute
Ayla is such a happy Bub😄
The same thing happened to me although I'm not overweight even after baby .. My family would call me fat. And after all the sleepless days or nights it could definitely be a damper on the spirits. Keep up mummy bubz u r doing so well! They really don know what they r saying. We r the best mums to our kids for giving them what we can
Can you make a “how to vlog“ video?
Issac is super adorable. He's so grown up now!
Issac is one of the sweetest boys I have ever seen <3
Ayla is the cutest, just like her mom! Also, I have that same little portable fan. IT'S LIFE CHANGING. I like to use it in the morning to help facial mists or makeup sprays dry faster, too. xD
Awwwww she's a chunky baby just like isaac was ❤️❤️❤️
Bubz , You Are An Excellent Example Of A Lovely Human Being... ! 😊
You are perfect the way you are. I am sick of the world trying to make girls and women think they must be perfect based on social values.
I’m honestly surprised that so many people are commenting on your weight because you don’t even look like you’ve gained to me. I think you look great!
Isaac is such a polite and well mannered kid, well done to you both. I come from a Chinese family too, so I totally understand where you are coming from. I know I will never do it to my kids when they get older ❤️
Oh so Ayla has cradle cap. That's easy, coconut oil or baby oil will soften the skin then gently get a fine tooth comb and gently run it along the skin. I was able to get my son's cradle cap off that way. It's normal and common, and usually happens around newborn age to 1 years old
Hey bubz really my son is also 3 but he s not even interested in abc or ne learning thing it make me sad
I’m due my first baby any day now and I was at a wedding about 8 weeks ago. One of the grandmas looked at me when I was eating and said wow you still have a while to go yet and you are pretty big. I managed to laugh it off but I was not expecting comments like that! I’m a UK size 8 normally and I’m probably a UK size 12 now. I just keep thinking of how sore you must have been during the final weeks now I am there. You did amazing!
5:00 And this is how God came into play/ was invented :D lol
Hi Bubz-mommy ! im glad you all are ok there! i hope your little doggies are ok also! please tell us about them at next video! :)
Feel the same way with my 2 toddlers..😭
lol never miss an arm day😂😂😂
the disconnect between the mentality of asian relatives who live in asia vs. your own upbringing as an asian in a western country will always exist. you just need to remember that in their culture, it's automatically assumed that every individual wants to be thin. they're not telling you you're chubby or fat because they don't love you, but rather it's because they care about you and are trying to be helpful in the way that they think they should be.\n\nwhich is totally not to invalidate anything you're feeling, because i've absolutely been there too. i gained about 15 pounds in the last year and a half and while i'm not fat, i look noticeably different to my family. when i'm just sitting there with my mom and my sister having unrelated conversations and my mom suddenly finds another way to bring up my weight and my out of control habits, it makes me feel like she can't even see her own daughter as anything but a measurement of fat. but you just have to keep doing what you're doing and let it roll off you, while reminding yourself that it's not a matter of love or not-love, but just difference.
A friend of mine had similar issues after she had her kid. I went to her daughter’s first birthday party and she took a moment to sit with me in a private corner and vent that one of her family members had criticized her choice of outfit for the occasion because it made her look fat. She almost broke down in tears. I don’t understand how anyone, especially family members can put down a woman who is pregnant or has given birth recently.
Loved how she randomly spit on your hand
Your not fat because, that what happen when you give brith and it call beauty and plus you should said I also human begin too so sometime my body is not going to be like as you wanted my body to look afther getting brith because I also getting old so there no need to worry about my body no more because I already have someone who love me for who I am and how I look like and take care of my two kids. 😊😍😘 but it just depend on what you decide and choose so yea . 😊 and plus your baby is so cute when she yawn 😍😘.
LOVE your makeup whenever you're in Hong Kong! Looks so much fresh :D
They want you to have a happy marriage. The lack of momentum leads to further loss momentum. Weight gain strains attraction between the husband and wife.\n\nThey want a happy family. If it's happy wife happy life than there is also the equivalent for the husband side. Relationships require dual effort from both sides.\n\nThis is why they say such things. It's out of care.
so cute😍😍😍 I like the way you and Tim teach your children. Love care.
Normally boy looks like mom and girl looks like dad but urs is the opposite 🙃 I actually like it that way .... goofy son and pretty daughter ☺️
She is so cute!
Isaac is growing so fast 😭 what a cutie
She's such a happy baby I'm so in love
This kids make my day. SOO CUTE 😍😍
Bubz you look beautiful, and your babies look so happy.
My grandma used to tell everybody, including me: 'you're fat!' while she would take a big piece of your belly or your butt to prove her point. And she would say this as a compliment, very happy that at last the kids and teens in her family put some meat on their bones... We didn't like it at all, compliment or not. But she was adorable in everything else, so... We gave her that privilege of being our personal scale.
Isaac seems to be speaking more and more, and he is so polite! He really is getting cuter and cuter by the day <3
Just tell them sometimes that is the eye opening for them I know that horrible felling
Ayla is getting so big already.. she's only 2months old. She looks so much like her Mummy!
People need to stop with how one looks because everyone is made in God's image and we should Embrace our Individuality! not compare,their opinion is their opinion and it's better if they just chill out
Ah I get it a lot too....the constant you're so fat! Lose some weight! I've honestly given up trying to say no, I'm healthy! It's quite bad as I am at the age when girls feel the most vulnerable to these comments and do extreme things to make themselves perfect. However, rather than feeling crappy about it, I use it to my advantage and make jokes about it. I've been hearing the comments over and over I basically immune to it 😄
ohh Lindy,  may I know your lipstick ? that you wore in the car.  it's look so nice on you :)
bubz: who's a pretty girl?\nayla: lol das me
Bubz, you literally have the perfect family. 2 adorable dogs, an awesome son who is 2 years older than your beautiful daughter, and an amazing husband. I love your family, P.S. you neeeeed to add ayla to the intro :DDDD
i will never get tired of bubz putting lotion on her babies
How old Isaac is?
Hi Bubz, been a subbie for a long time but not been much of a commentor. However just wanted to say you are doing an amazing job! The fat shaming and image expectations of HK or the asian culture is ridiculous and I admire that you are trying to not let it get to you. I recently moved to HK and I have never been skinny, had fat comments made to me all the time, mostly from relatives or family friends. Coming here has showed me that even your boss or colleagues feel they are right to comment on your weight and how you should look. It got to me but we can only shrug it off cos we can never meet these so called expectations. We can be too skinny, too fat, too tall, too short! The list goes on!
You have a beautiful family bubz . Love ya 💕 I love when Isaac says hi mummy . So sweet 😭😍
I love when you show Ayla's facials. She looks so happy and relaxed 😊😊
You are beautiful to me ! :) Family can be rude most of the time!
Isaac is such a sweetheart.
Second borns always seem so chill. They’re just happy to watch what’s going on and be part of the family. First borns have no chill!! Lol.\nI’ve got an 18mo daughter and I can’t imagine having another sibling in the house. She demands your full attention! Lol. Maybe it’s a first born girl thing? 👸🏼😳
You look GORGEOUS bubz!! Dont worry about your body it created an amazing gift and blessed you with a healthy baby. It just needs time to recover
But Lindy you’re 10x the mum any there kid has!
cute
It's usually the older generations that do this too.\nMy mom is my worst reminder of all my insecurities cause she always says I'm fat even though I'm not and then I start believing her :C
I am absolutely dreading seeing family in Hong Kong!! \n\n‘Why have you gained weight? Why don’t you have a job after university? Well that’s what you get for taking a creative subject...’  ffs 😐
I think your face is just a little fuller than it used to be and that is why they notice it so much more but I think you look amazing Bubz. Healthy and happy and your family looks the same. Like you said in time it will change and you did just have a baby.
Omg I cried when you all were saying good night to Isaac 😭 oh my pregnancy hormones
This kid stopped, said in English that Lindy is 10 times his age.... these 3 year olds out here.. amazing 😩😩
Naturally you have baby weight atm but tbh it's not even that much! Youre Still quite slim even with the gain, you'll be back to your usual size soon but just remember size isn't everything and you are beautiful no matter what!
Hi bubz! Love your videos! You are doing so well only having a baby 2 months ago and looking after two kids! Don't worry about what people say, I cannot understand them, esp the women who probably have been through the same thing! My daughter is exactly 2 months older than Ayla and had the same white patch on her tongue, just gently brush with some cooled boiled water and toothbrush and it all went away! I read if you do not, then it can lead to thrush ... all the best :)
#1 - You are AMAZING! And you're so right, it took your body 9+ months to make that adorable little girl of yours and it's going to take time to heal.\n#2 - She could have cradle cap. My son had it. You just need to get a little brush and gently scrub her scalp with some soap and warm water. It will go away soon enough. \n😊💖
you look perfect ❤ and you are such an inspiration ❤
Bubz, you have two beautiful children and are beautiful just the way you are on the inside and out. I love your sweet, kind, sincere, and down-to-earth personality. God bless you, Tim, and your two little ones! Sending love and hugs your way! ♥♥
That child who new his multiples sounds adorable. XD
No joke in hongkong the kids have too much competition kid start there addition at like 2 and learn algebra at 5 or something
Older family members are never held responsible for their hurtful words because others make excuses for them, such as, It's just a generation/culture thing!, or, They honestly feel like they are helping you. None of the hurtful comments will ever stop until you hold them accountable for it.
Hi Bubz, so glad you guys back to Hong Kong. I have been watched your videos for such a long time.But i was like the silent viewer ,quite shy to leave a comment.Your videos are so amazing and inspirational.It is trilled to see you guys vlogging, from seeing Tim's proposal until Ayla is born,. I really feel like being part of your family. I know Youtube has tons of youtubers but you guys are absolutely  be my favorite. I remember once you asked Tim what is the thing that he miss the most in HK, he said food!!!! Since I am currently working at yuen long ,i always looking for amazing dish for lunch , i would just killing me by not sharing the good food for you guys.Bubz i know you love dim sum you mentioned in the video back in Belfast said you didn't find a place in hk served good dim sum.I found a place call Big Belly at 教育路they did serve nice dim sum,you should try it!!!!!Anyway wish your family all the best ,healthy and happy ^^Have a nice time in Hong Kong .God bless your family .
all children develop different I wouldn't beat yourself up over lying about your sons age, I'm sure most mom's on here have told some porkies now and then. lol
Bubz! Did you hear? Girls Generation disbanded 😭😭😭😭
<3
Isaac is so adorable.
does issac speak only English?
Daaaang!!!! She's gorgeous!!!!!!!
小公主好可愛呀！
Where the dogs?
Missing chubby and domo.. 😢😢😢
She's sooo flufffyyy I'm gonna dieee🙀🙀
shes speaking :D
Twisted donut arms BAHHAHA 😂😂😂💕
Love you, Lindy <3
awe Isaac has grown so much!! so cute :)
Bubz you're beautiful 😍
💝💝💝💝💝💖💖💖💖💖
If you rinse out a clean wash cloth you can use it to gentle clean Lala's tongue just like teeth brushing to help with the white tongue. I used to do it once daily- gently because breast milk is so fatty :) is even do it to clean the sides of his cheeks, gum stimulation to help with milk teeth and the roof of he younger. You just gotta go slow as not to hit their gag reflex lol she's so cute!!
you are really fat these days, bubz
Okay, okay! Here's the theme remix: https://soundcloud.com/andrew-mcmurry-487864575/pubg-theme-from-battlegrounds-the-zone\nI made it downloadable, too. You guys can use it for whatever you want. Glad everyone enjoys the video so far!
Pubg is like the modern equivalent of the hunger games
this is what the new 400 player mode is gona be like
Wish it was more like the Game,u can't wake up after being hit with the mighty pan!
Are there any other LOST fans who recognized that beginning scene?
Feel like this was made for 13 year old boy, weak!!!
Where is Bananaman and Wadu and why is this at 60 fps?
What do you use to animate?
Lol!!!!!! All I have to say
The link to the music dosen't do shit
1:44 What's the name of the song played here?
После этого ролика начал бояться синей зоны больше, чем смотреть фильмы ужасов!
hahahahaha good work
Awesome
Well done!
lol
fake,no lag
I need pubg fml
Pubg really needs lore
Unrealistic, melee weapons aren't that good in pubg! ;P
idk, if this really was pubg you would be floating above ground for AT LEAST 5 mintues before landing.
Sometimes you just gotta embrace the gas
What's the name of the song please?!!
The editing is sick!!!
Good job man. I appreciate you hard work. Thanks for that.
His body should have been jigging out in the buggy lol
Why that girl didnt survive :( I really like her :(
This is just amazing
Dont let me get in my zone
4:08 :) well , that's me :)))
The good works make good job👍
@0:28 did i just see bananaman got killed ?
Where to find the music in 02:48 I like it alot
he just entered the zone and in the minimap he is deep inside the zone plus no lake nearby why so much inaccuracy?
that dumb mf' still runs with his weapon out. what a pleb
Beats the corridor digital one
Man you really made the blue look terrifying...
...the thing that nags me is that they use a shotgun that's not in the game.
The daily adventures of a noob
give them money for a full-size movie
What kinda noob opens their parachute as soon as they jump out of the plane
U forgot to loot that guy with AR :p
Good video but boring grounds are going down in next 6 months
Praise the pan
Fake! Never died to Redzone
0:30 - bananaman reference?
Banana man?
PLEAS DONT PAN ME!!
great job!
HUNGER GAMES
Thiss iss nott advertiserfrienlyy
NICE MUSIC!
fan-tastic
Two melee weapons equipped at once. Literally unwatchable.
awesome video
lol that was hilarious
Danm, get rekt Corridor Digital
Frickin awsome
awesome dude👌👌👌
WOW.
Who else thought that when the screen was turning red after he chugged that energy drink and took all those pain killers he was about to fukin drop dead
definitely thought he was seeing red after popping those boosters haha
can anyone give a link of the remix plz?
Pan Is The King 😖
I dont know who you are but well done
This is so epic i love it
wow this was way better than the corridor one :D
Is that guy win
Why are you guys, Corridor Digital,  Sam Kolder and everyone else obsessed with distracting noticeable color grades?  \nMuted greens, teal trees, blue whites and exaggerated red & skin tones.  It doesn't improve  narrative, themes or emotion, it's an internet action scene. And it emphasizes your composition layers and making them stand out on top of the footage.
RIP
Wow\nThis Video was amazing i loved everything in it.
FAAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!! The bombs don't drop in the red zone for a good 30 seconds and they drop almost immediately. Also when the pan guy knocked you out doesn't make sense because you can't get knocked out in this game. Hahahaha so inaccurate big ol idiots
Never have died to red zone, never see whats the big deal
Besser wie mancher Kinofilm der Millionen gekostet hat 😂👍🏼
wtf is there one pubg parody without that always winning pan shit..
that guy's ak was still going off a second after u ran him over, must be desync

Fucking goood !!
Good job. Nicely done :)
Wow!
Simply genius work!
absolute classic lol
Típicos ratas 🐀🐁
music in 3:00 pls
the numbers of retarded videos made around pubg... i wonder if pubg pay them to make ads or if they are just trying to surf the hype wave. The game is full of bugs/cheaters and unbalanced shit its overhyped asfuck ( i got over 400hours on pubg, im talking from experience)
If you have Netflix & haven't seen Kick Kroll and John Mulaney's show Oh Hello, you are missing out. It's their stage production on Broadway and it's hysterical. :)
I can't watch this without thinking that Nick from Big Mouth is talking lmao
y'all she has my name
This is fucking disgusting and your show promotes pedophiles
3:40 I stan this child. It’s like looking in a mirror of my 6th grade self.
I found that pretty awkward and not funny at all. I guess I'm not in their target audience.
Nick kroll doesn't believe in evolution!? I'm sorry Nick, but despite what your opinion is, evolution is a fact.
hi i'm nick crompton and no i'm n-
Emma:\n\n\n\nI call the darkness into me \nFrom deepest depths of Earth and Sea \nFrom ancient evils unawoken \nbreak the who one can't be broken \nthe blackest night I plaged my soul \nand you crush my heart to Burning coal the sommon forth deathly power to see my hated foe devorued 😂
what highlighter is Nick Kroll wearing because it's really pretty!
They went from playing 70 year olds to playing tweens. And make me crack up as both.
Was Nick kidding when he said he doesn't believe in evolution??????
3rd bass - mc search - house of pain everlast
*Throws penalty flag at Nick Kroll*  Everlast was in House of Pain not 3rd Bass.  3rd Bass was MC Serch and Pete Nice.
Two strange men talking about puberty with kids...
If you have not watched Big Mouth on Netflix, you must!!! It is hilarious and one of the best things ever.
What am I watching.  The Douche is describing puberty to me.
It's a 90s hip hop group lolol Great answer
I'm guessing they only did this to promote Big Mouth and BuzzFeed didn't put it anywhere in the video or the description.
Simply Move to google and type: WUMO SEO. They are the cheapest Search engine optimization company and ranked my site within just Eight weeks. They will either rank your blog or give your cashback. I simply love WUMO SEO.
I'm bout to put you in the neighborhood
What was the advice?
watched until he said evolution wasnt real, i didnt realize he was an idiot.
John was so close to cussing at 2:20 😂
Not sure how Nick got House of Pain and 3rd Bass mixed up. Or did I miss some sort of joke?
I guess you can ball park someone’s income bracket by asking them about their butter preferences. “French butter” Lmao. What? Kroll is my hero.
i love these people but i HATE buzzfeed
Your video was very well made & inspiring to watch! My favorite way to make money online, legitimately is by earning residual income with Bitcoin... by Auto Trading Loans, I make up to 40% R.O.I. monthly.. Check out this tutorial to learn how:\nhttps://goo.gl/242BgP
Big Mouth is the fucking best
There is no such thing as puberty or sex  we are sexless consciousness
Does Nick Kroll not actually believe in evolution?
But they won't put iddubz in the trending tab
I love this so damn much
Nick Kroll looks exactly like nick from big mouth
There coming if age all over the place.......
I finished Big Mouth in a day in a half 😂😂😂
i will miss the brain cells i lost watching this
Nick Croll is a pedophile y’all
That was awkward
I love John
4:46 SHE WAS SO SHOOK NFNSDNNSS
Buzzfeed now promoting pedophilia? What's next?
If the boy did asked the question What third base is these guys would have answered it better or comfortably than when the girl asked it.
nick kroll definitely made nick to look like him
Nick Kroll should be legally obligated to stay away from children
I’m 13 and damn I wish I could be in this video
This was a ridiculous waste of time. Not funny....(John Mulaney is a funny dude, BUT not here.)
This is going to be me with my kids
I need 2 black people please?!?
Neosporin is great for after you have popped a zit. Really speeds up the healing process.
name a better duo! i'll wait
Nick looks sorta like my youth pastor who's also named Nick. Creepy.
What is the point of this video
i can’t listen to john’s voice without imagining andrew talking lmao
I could see Nick being a great dad some day and giving funny yet honest advice. And John... tried lol
John Mulaney bull? Why buy the cow? Because that's you love her that's why.
A pathetic example of stupidity masquerading as humor.  Made all the worse because these fools are substituting nonsense for critical information.  If you are lacking the knowledge or guts to tell the truth, don't bring up the subject.
I clicked as soon as I saw John Mulaney 👏🏼
i thought nicks laugh at 3:13 was the little girl
Be gay. That’s the only message you will get from youtubers
I always love spreading fatty butter on my skin.
only buzzfeed would make a video idea as dumb as this.
This stuff has to stop
I like Big Girls ;(
I lost brain cells watching this shit
Buzzfeed this was a real bad idea with these fellas. Lol
San Diego Diet
JOHN MULANEY
What was that 😂
we're here at *busts out laughing* BUZZFEEd
ANDREW AND NICK \nBIG MOUTH\n\nIS \n\nAWESOME
I just came here to drop my dislike\n\nAnd comment
Nick Kroll is hilarious
I don’t think these men should be allowed to be near teens
If you finish a shower with cold water, the pores on your skin will close, preventing dirt and shit from getting in there. \n\nI know it sounds sketchy, but It’s worked very well for me and some friends of mine that also do it. Plus it also prevents you from feeling freezing when you step out of the shower.
They would make such a cute couple
toothpaste works bruh
John is so adorable! I love this video.
Ew
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVENT HIT PUBERTY YET.
Visit www.indis.me and expose your local luciferians!
Disgusting, ,,, have fun in hell
Useless.
I wanna clap Brooke’s cheeks
Uhh 🙄 really now?!?
http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=159749
WTF
BuzzFeed is disgusting.
((()))
Big mouth is fucking hilarious
OMG OMG MY HEALTH TEACHERS NAME IS JOHN MULLANEY WTF
Its the douche
Alberto Roy lol mejor su ta\n\n\n\n\n\nFax
This is weird
Go To Google And then Type: *gamesecrxguide facebook* This has been the only working FB h@ck tool working these days. Never waste the available free time on some other applications
What is wrong with society? Having young children questioned by two grown male comedians about intimate topics that should be discussed with their parents? Shame on the parents for allowing this. Disgusting, this is not normal. Wake up
John Mulaneys career must be going thru hard times if he is at buzzfeed. BTW who is Nick Kroll?
That netflix show isnt funny... but Its okay (animation is terrible) but story is, okay...
Big mouth is my new favorite show , slowly healing the void in my heart from the absence of Brickleberry
Buzz feed is a very gynocentric channel. It's awful.. 3 girls and 1 homo kid. Jesus Christ.
☄
So amazing !
Love this song. Great performance and tribute to a legend
Legendary!
Great vid as usual! RIP Tom Petty.  : (
Nicely done!
You guys are amazing!
P.S.     In your 2016 (July) Live in Madrid short video on YT, you featured a partial of an unreleased song, Indigenous Love........since then, many of us have been waiting for the full version release of your song, it is amazing !!  So when is it coming ??  Also, next new album release date ??  Let us know !  :)  nV
Beautiful
Unrelated. But I would LOVE to hear you do your version of Sia _ Chandelier! Don't how to reach you guys, so figured I'd try in the comment section of your latest video. Love all your stuff. Keep it up! Not assuming you take requests. Sorry if I'm coming off rude. Just figured it was worth mentioning. Greetings from Norway
Incredible Tribute guys! Thank You!
Respect to Marshall for the Elora Brewing Co. Hat. I've got home roots around that town. Great tribute!

It is my request that can you make your next song 'Despacito'
More madness and mayhem. Just as it should be - but with respect! Thanks!! x
heey guys!! could you do a cover of Castle On The Hill (ed sheeran)? :)  \nbtw this is definetly one of my favorite covers! you guys did it amazing, I showed do everyone here in the family (my dad especially loved!) xx from Brazil!
Tom would be proud. Well done everyone! RIP Legendary Tom Petty <3
Holy shit the amazement is beyond comprehension....
Someone should have hit that flaming marshmallow at the camera with the back of a uke.
They are one of my favorite groups!
too good at goodbye please !!!
*tears. My favorite Tom Petty song is Alright For Now. He's alright forever now.
Oh I love the older bluegrass feel... Tom Petty will be so missed  #WootWOTE
I've loved Tom Petty ever since my dad played his music at hime when I was a boy. That's been 25 years ago. I was very sad when I read he passed away, I will miss him. He was unique.
You guys should do let me go by hailee steinfeld ft. Florida Georgia Line
Someone can recommend me songs like this i like how it sound but is the first time i heard something like this
Great tribute guys!   You rock in every since of the word
You guys are amazing!! Love this so much! Great tribute to Tom Petty <3
I was so satisfied when the camera turned to the bearded guy in the hammock.
Hmmmm...never heard of you cats before.\nDigging your sound as we morn the loss of a truly great artist.\nWell met. \npeace
R.I.P. Mr.Petty,great song performed by some great artists right there.love it ❤❤👍👍(on another note how in the hell this video got 72 dislike?)
Are they hiring people? I could be those two on the right easily. Clap some random shit and get to be with WOTE in a video...!
Awesome Tribute.  1st concert I ever saw was Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, at Hec Edmundsen pavilion at UW. Saw him 3 times and loved every show. Would you consider covering Spike, off of Southern Accents, or pack up the plantation live version?  Love Your Music!
They should do a cover of Shut Up and Dance. Who agrees?
Wow... I'm not into this music genre but I love the vibe you guys give off. The sound is smooth. Nice in general. 👍
Another amazing cover and big props to Tom's legacy!
Top downloaded WOTE on Google play (just downloaded it myself) Very cool all the proceeds going to the Heart and Stroke Foundation :D
I would pay good money to sit by the fire with these guys and just listen
When I saw this was a  Tommy Petty cover, I was upset. But after watching and listening I was smiling, singing and clapping😁 Amazing job and don't think Tom would have disagreed...how fun!
You guys are always so amazing.
this kind of looks like a bunch of camp counselors have abandoned all the children

Why arnorld always losses his finger on all videos?
I love that. Anna is ignoring all the 'don't hold your baby too much' 'rule and doing whatever she feels right for her I love that really like whatever makes ur baby happy and is working no matter what the rules are then do it like so what at least it's working for u and the baby. I love it
In Germany it is more common to put the baby in a sleeping bag - because blankets can move over to her face overnight and she might get too less air
Anna, I feel the nursery isn’t a very big room. A little fussing a crying is okay, if she gets hysterical, yes plz pick her up. But if you wanna redo it, maybe put her in her crib, play some soft music or fun kid songs she likes and continuously talk or sing to her as you work to redo her room the way you want so she hears your voice and knows your close. Maybe take breaks every half hr or 10 min to hold her and play with her, then do another 10 min or so. It will take longer then if you were alone (but what doesn’t with kids) but I feel you can get it done. Could work? Worth a shot?
Eduardo: So good morning I am naked cracked me up! 😂😂😂
The way Alessia was looking at Johnathan when he was trying to feed her was like smirking as if to say im not going to open my mouth 😁😁😁
Did they change the title and thumbnail? Thought it was named ‘feeding the baby’ before and had a picture of Alessia and a spoon?
Who remembers when Emilia would just sit and rock and bang her head? 🤣🤣🤣 smh
Lol @ Jonathan feeding alessia, typical Man slopping it everywhere 😂
i love how excited the kids got on the bowl game x so lovely xx
Get a Lillebaby carrier, Anna! It will help so so so much. The 6 in 1 Complete in Woven. Just trust me. SO SOFT.
Oh my gosh is it me or is jonathan screaming nonstop at the camera? I wish he would just talk normal sometimes and not so animated.
Prepping the kids for beer pong, a useful skill in high school and college. Lol
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute emilia was so adorable when she said  wait why are you talking? 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said  good morning my friendliest friend very slowly and when johnathan asked him if he had a girlfriend he said   yes then when johnathan said what is her name? Eduardo said  emilia and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling at the camera when johnathan was holding her :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nJohnathan is a great dad and Anna is a lovely mum x
How cute are your kids!! Love watching your videos 💚💛❤️💙
When are use going to move house
You are such a good mom.  It's a lot of work and you do a wonderful job.  What a good example you are for others when it comes to parenting. Love watching you guys.  Been watching since Emilia was a baby.  It just keeps getting better.
😂Eduardo coughing at Alessia's was so funny , I love the kids theyre so cuttee❤️
It's bounces off and out cause its a spiky ball
Guys it's been officially one year since i've watched sacconejolys every single day! love you guys
Anna YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL 👏🏻👏🏻
I wish it was cold in Texas where I live 😕 -*jealous*
I hear ya Anna! You rock as a mom :)
The best bit made me roar with laughter Jonathan feeding the baby and get bored face. And Eduardo stripping off. Typical child  very funny
 So good morning. I am naked!
I KNEW I couldn't possibly be the only person in the world who says Whatever song is playing on the radio when I turn it on will depict how the day is going to go !!!!!!!!!!!!! Woooooo !!! Haha !! Thanks Johnathen !! 😍😍😍
Awww Alessia was so happy to see her mommy in the beginning of the video. Too precious for words!!!
Anna you are so right ❤ dont ever listen to other people. A mom always knows whats the best for her children/babys. + you can never cuddle your baby to much. Enjoy every minute ❤
I love Eduardo's passion for Little Mix 😂😂
why don't you put alessia in that like thing that moves up and down and its always moving maybe she'll enjoy it and set it outside the nursery door so she can see you. then maaaybe the little cutie will let you do thing without holding her. I'm sure she will cry at first but yeah shouldn't get her use to always being carried cause that's what happens. she gets spoil and thinks well if I cry mom will pick me up lol
I'm in love with this family.
eduardo's favorite song is shout out to my ex by little mix?? omg that's funny! hahaha
Let Allessia nap in your room while you tackle the nursery
When are yall moving?? Lol at Jonathan's Comment...Alessia is so cute!
Middle child syndrome 😂😂😂😋😂 I'm a middle child
Anna you are my idol!!!! Such a strong and inspiring woman 🌸🌸
Aleesia is cute.  She loves that camera!  What is everyone being for Halloween?
Do you like to baby wear? Maybe that’s help getting stuff done!
You guys are such a beautiful family. I really love watching your videos. You always lift my spirits up. Keep being awesome. <3
Eduardo I am naked. He always cracks me up.
Anna I'd love to see your nighttime routine! Like makeup removal to bed! :)
Hi everyone, I'm wanting to give it a shot at vlogging so I have memories to look back on. Should my channel be called\n- Zac and Sophie\nor\n- Sophie + boys\nAm open to any other suggestions too! ☺\nMy fiance name is Zac and we have 2 little boys.\nThanks for the help ☺❤
My mom called me her broach because i never wanted to be away from her.
Alessia is a smiling baby like Emilia when she was young. Hahaha! Edwardo was the opposite.
I can't believe Eduardo only 3 it sounds weird when you say interview with my three year old so cute my little cousin is 3 Lenny and he still can't speak very well he can speak but he still can't say proper conversations and when he does try you don't under stand he turnt three 2 weeks ago xx
My brother is Eduardos age and all he wants to do is strip off it's so funny but annoying xx 😘
Love the kiddos. Love u all!
My 3 year old brother likes Steve and Maggie
Anna never mind what others think you are both great parents and no matter what age we are we want and hug from mammy
the most adorable family on the internet 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
“don’t press that button!” Haha Jonathan’s Irish accent really came out there
Omg when Edwardo said that emelia was his girlfriend, dead 😂😂😂
Shoutout to my ex😂 Eduardo is hilarious 😂🙈
Alessia is finally in that phase where babies have developed their growing personalities.  She's so cute and tiny petite..., just like Erika!  I think Alessia is going to be the most precious of all your children.  She's just a little beauty with those drop dead gorgeous baby blues and her long dark lashes.  Emilia has a built in best friend and Eduardo will have the company of two great sisters to walk through life with.  Of course, a brother will even the odds for Eduardo and give him a brother/best mate to leverage his odds, but I'll just leave that area up to you guys.  Love your vlogs!!!
Love you, guys!!  :*
anna is sooo gorgeous though:(
Ffs
The cutest kids ever 💕
Get your baby snuggles while you can.
Johnathan is teaching Amelia how to be the queen of beer pong when she's older 😂😂😂😂
That ball you were using was way to bouncy. Fun though. Alessia looking at Emilia at the dinner table was so cute.
Just keep cuddling as much as you want to. The time flies too quickly.
Eduardos saying is I'm Anna or I'm Elsa😂❤️
Ha-Ha!  Jonathon is so hilarious - Why is the tv show from last night coming over the radio?!  Anna is right, there is no such thing as loving a baby too much! 💕
I adore Eduardo he is just adorable is hillarious and extremely clever and we'll developed for his age!!!😋😉😃👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👶🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕
I laughed sook hard this vlog :\nEmilia: Wait! Why are YOU talking😂😂😂
Yes Eduardo!!! Mini mixer right there!!!!
Amazing parenting! :)
that baby looks like Miley Cyrus
Sweet Eduardo
Im dead! Emilia - Diahrrea, diahrrea (sp?) shes so funny!
Not worth listening to Senborra\nSACCNOE JOLYs are multimillon subscribed and worth it \nGot muted.........
Hi Guys!
Just take it
Jonathon, stop screaming.  Are you on something your so hyper active weird in this video.  I wonder why the children don't listen, hmmmmmm.
Aww
Did you change the title or is it just me ?
Fav irish family 💚
Pobre bb no tiene cámara para mirarla y no tiene protección la cuna el video anterior se metió un golpe muy feo porfavor tengan más cuidado los amoooooooo
EDUARDO GETTING NAKED AND JUMPING IN THE CRIB WITH ALESSIA IS THE MOST BIZARRE THING I HAVE EVER WITNESSED.
Have you tried baby wearing so you can get stuff done? All my friends swear by it to get the housework done!
Emilia is Eduardo's hero and gf.
I can’t believe Eduardo is only 3! He acts so much older I think!
Poor Edourdo he has  pressure of speech he never gets the chance to verbalise himself fully. Jonathon always has to be yapping  ALL the time
Emilia saying Give me some hope LOL she is adorable
I haven't watched lately!  What happed with the new house? Are they getting a new house like they said? Or what happened?
Ok I Alesia's adorable we get it. But did they forget they have 2 other kids? I know babies attract more views🙄 but come on. Almost every thumbnail lately has been Alessia
You were saying we're moving soon and when we move a lot these past few weeks, now it's all we're never moving what happened??! Please fill us in more about this, it's so confusing 🤔
What day was this filmed on. Are the vlogs not filmed the day before they're uploaded anymore?😔😭
I really hope you taught Emilia and Eduardo they're not supposed to climb in the cot with Alessia unless you or Anna are there. I'm imaging all sorts of tragic scenarios here...
watch +kavos video about family vloggers
Silly spoons for feeding babies
At 6:49 Edwardo is naked 😱😱😱😱😱😱
Anna, I love you honesty. I had a baby boy around the same time as you did Alessia (I think they are about 2 weeks apart) and with it being my second I have really struggled with some of the day to day!! I think you're doing an amazing job and you are just so real!! Thank you for making me fee like I am doing a great job too. Xxx
Does anyone know what is Vodafone please leave in the comments
Eduardo is an expressive child. He have a big heart and plenty of love to give. Him getting naked is his way of saying that he does not want Alessia getting the grubbiness from his school clothes. I am sure his parents will teach him the norm of things as he grows older. He is only 3 For God's sake....
Omg she slept whole night on her tummy!Is it safe to do so.Bit confused as i was told to make my baby sleep on her back by my midwife😔
I finally realized who Anna reminds me of: Julia Roberts
I don t know when they are moving but it s hard to take all the things that they need in the new house and they have 2 kids in school and a baby it must be hard
Jonathan what is with Eduardo stripping of all his clothing when he goes in allesia bedroom  it’s a little odd

“I wish spiders would just all die”\n“But then other bugs would have a much higher population!”\n“So lets just kill all of the bugs”\nWhat happens next? Watch till the end of this video!
The origin of the word Mosquito actually mean useless so...
I don't care what the consequences are, I would push a button that made every insect go splat if I could. I hate insects with every molecule in my body, and I hate spiders even more. As long as I can survive, kill all the insects.
Well think about it like this, bad ones die and good ones stay to be amazing, likes bees and butterflies!
I freaking love insects. I’m one of those rare people who has hard time hating pretty much any kind of animal. Maybe I prefer some animals to others, (example, I love grasshoppers way more than ticks since being bit by them is terrible) but I can just never confidently say, “I hate this animal!”
Answer: we would all die as soon as i saw this title
Who knew they did that much.
What would happen if all the bugs die?\nMe: Every game would never need a bug fix.
My friend has a Cockroach 😖🤢
I thought only bees sting. Don't wasps bite? Too lazy to google it.
If by bugs we mean small invertebrates all together, without them our society would end. Just cause something isn't pretty doesn't mean it should go.
they are cool now
Just kill the harmful ones :D
i wonder what mosquitoes do to contribute to humanity
It would be an absolute, global catastrophe of Biblical proportions. The damage that would do to the biosphere would rival a supervolcano eruption. Removing any entire class of species would be destructive, but insects are the largest class of animals in the world. There can be as much as 30 MILLION of species of insects.
WHAT IF WE KILL ALL THE COCKROACHES???? ONLY COCKROACHES
could you make a video about genetically modified crops ?\n\n\nplease.
Kill the ones that don’t help
people being scared of bugs/insects is realy cringey to watch because they're so interesting and most of them are harmless
i'd rather spare bees and wasp
Just have force field that kills bugs within 10 yards of you
all we just need is just more useful bugs like bees and get rid of the digusting bugs like moths or cockroches
Don’t kill all bugs just the annoying and dangerous ones agreed
Just kill the mosquitos and flys and done
Remember when dinosaurs are extinct?  Well i hope that mosquitoes go extinct in 20 years
you can hand pollinate any plant

Okay… so can we just get rid of gnats and mosquitoes?
I just want spiders and cockroaches out of this world
If there was no such thing as a wasp, my life would be 100000000000000000x better
We would all die 15 minutes later
We would die if insects died
3:04 There's a mosquito in my room right now and I cant find it
If every bug died we die as well finish you don't even need too watch the video all you have is a comment BOOM WIN WIN
The Life devs are working on removing the bugs.
If insects dissipated, in 50 years everything on earth will die\n\n\n\n\nIf humans disappeared, in 50 years the earth will flourish
One we make fake bugs can we kill al da bugs?
I believe the Jews are similar to bugs so they might be cool.
On a forum a read a quote and it said 'when someone says he or she is an animal lover but says he or she hates bugs, they are hating 84% of all animals.
Sooo you're saying that getting rid of all bugs is BAD!!!!😶.And I'm still afraid of bugs.
If cockroaches, water bugs, mosquitoes and other bugs that people are mostly afraid of(including me) are gone, then we wont have to worry about bugs anymore.
This video is really *bugging* me...
If we .would've only killed .all mosquitoes it would've all just been happiness
I just thought back to the bee movie when the bees stopped working and everything died
Great video!!! Really interesting. By the way I just uploaded my new track 'Kingdom Lost' so please come and check that out on my channel :)
let all those fuckers die
2:59 Incite = Insight
Plz no not spider man
Don't pin me let me drown in the comints
further insight*
every little creepy crawly is amazing plus I need those butterflies and fireflies
Make a video abt phone addiction........
I think useless insect should be all killed
U only need to kill bugs in yo house dudes
Little things means a lot. :)
I love all the insects they also make great pets I have a colony of Dubia roaches they are  simple to care for you guys should get some :)
I keep a flamethrower close at all times, damm insects, you shall BURN!!!!
What we keep bees and flies
What would happen if all the flies died at once
I have a question, life noggin; what would the technology in the future? would we start using magnet motors instead of our average motors in cars? k thanks!
Well then. But who says we still can't murder mosquitos?
Bugs i wish were extincted are\nMosquitos \nFire ants\nAnd head lice
Just stab the pests in the eye and keep the bees and crap.
what would happen if only spiders die?\n\ni don't even care if the world will end as long as im not scared of those creepy eight legged beasts
No I don't recknet phobia
Im not even scared of  bugs... I am sacred of computer bugs tho, i dont want to have my computer glitched ;-;
The only bugs I kill are misqitos and wasps. My friend has an allergy to wasps and if he gets bit he can go into a coma. BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF COCKROACHES??!??!?!?.!?!??!?!..!?!??!??!?!??!?!!?!??!?!??!?!??!?!?
I think they are kinda cool now.
To be honest, I already liked bugs but now I like big bugs and I cannot lie
Flies and mosquitos have no purpose search it up
U know my teacher takes a week... he takes 3 min... with jokes.
girls will stop screaming every 10 min
i was expecting....what if all Mosquitoes died all of a sudden?.
Hey life noggin, can the ocean get struck by lightning and if so why do people/fish not get electrocuted while swimming?
Get rid of flies and mosquitos and im good! XD
Bugs aren't creepy.  Creeps are buggy!
I scared of cocroch soooooooooo much
Wait what\n0:10\nYour human world...\nHnmmm
1:36 sneaky, sneaky animators...
What about flies
nahhh just kill the flies and mosquitos and gnats
I've always loved insects
Love this channel
I hate bugs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nO
Don’t kill bees!!!!!
Then maybe I could try Skyrim without mods.
corn cock at 1:37
Angiosperms HAHA GET IT SPERM OMG SO FUNNY\n-5th grade me
I always liked bugs
What happens if humans vanished
Haha, incite
That a salamander
Gonta would go ballistic
Nuts

brad pit teen version
Okay so I might add that yes, Scott does need a few more parts, but 1: He knew what he was getting himself into when he started singing with Mitch alone. 2: He was most of the lead in Pentatonix so he can take a breather and let Mitch be the show, and he has and I thank him for that. They are both equally amazing and they know what they are doing they don't need other people to tell them what and what not to do. I applaud you both.
Who would ever deny Scott anything?
I love this video but what makes it special is that their eyes are so expressive.
You guys just keep getting better and better. As if that was even possible!!! I'm so happy for and proud of you two!!! ❤️❤️❤️
But honestly IMO this is their best MV yet..like the production and imagery is so good and it's just pleasing to the eye
I had reached the point in my life where I didn’t think Scott could get any hotter, but I was SORELY 👏🏼 MISTAKEN 👏🏼 and I’m living for it.
Omf this video is so damn good
OK BUT THIS VIDEO IS FIRE THE PRODUCTION IS FIRE THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS FIRE THE EDITING IS FIRE THE ACTING IS FIRE THIS SONG IS FIRE THE HARMONIES ARE FIRE AND I'M SO FUCKING PROUD OF THEM AHHHHHHHHHH
my scomiche meter just broke...
I. CANT. STOP. REPLAYING.
JUST GET FUCKING MARRIED ALL READY WHY YOU GOTTA PLAY ME LIKE DAT
oml this is fire tbh. this should have more views it's so good!
Mitch w/your current look, I truly hope you audition for the role of Freddy Mercury when some studio decides to do a Queen biopic.
I don't understand how this doesn't have 1 million views already...
am i the only one that would want bloopers from this video because i feel like they went through alot of takes because scott and mitch would burst out laughing from trying to be serious.
Thanks for teasing all of us you evil bitches.  Loved it!!!!!!
WONDERFUL SONG, LOVE YOU MITCH AND SCOTT
Mitch rockin' the killer 'stache! Brilliant track - more please!
Such a good song.
i relate to much to this song.
scott and mitch, to each other: i try but i can't deny u\nus: SIS WE BEEN KNEW
I love them but the mustache just mmmmmm
God srsly shave that mustache please. I'm such a big fan but im not a fan of that mustache \nBut your music is as amazingly bomb as always. Keep on slayin💖
I can't stop listening to this
THIS SONG IS SO GOOODDDDD
This music video is AMAZING
Channelling Freddie Mercury Mitch! I see you ;)
There's so many Scott's in this video though I love it
fantastic song \nfantastic video \nfantastic artist   \n I love superfruit\n I love mitch\n I love Scott \nI LOVE DENY U
I can't stop watching this 😭😭 it's so gooooood 😍😍
Also I’m obsessed with the song. Damn, I can’t stop listening.
Scott reminds me of a vampire from The Lost Boys movie
I love the song but his mustache makes me scared for life.
i actually hate Mitch's outfit and this video confuses me so much\nbut the songs lit and I still love them sooo
mitch babe you look like that one green car from Cars that everyone hates
Love you guys and always have, BUT Mitch hunny! Yes the stach changes your face, but there are a lot of angles that makes it look 70’s trucker porn star. No shade rly, just trying to help.
this is my favorite song off the album and this mv is so good i’m in love 
only 25k people liked this\nthat is statistically impossible!\nit should be over 100k
This is so beautiful
This reminds me of UK garage, love it
I still ship them so much and this is EVERYTHING also i relate so much to this
thought it was an ad in the begging
I can't stop listening and watching this video,,, everything about it is so well done and made
This video is INCREDIBLE!! Beautiful, haunting, and fits the song perfectly - obsessed to say the least <3\n\nxxxxxxx
The beat is INSANE!!!!!! Love this sooooo much!!! Keep going!!! #bestwishes from Germany!!!!
SCOMICHE NEEDS TO LIKE HAPPEN AND THIS PROOF!!!
EVERY VIDEO BREAKS MY HEART A LITTLE MORE GUYS 😍😍😍😍
I just need to get one thing off my chest..........Mitch looks like a French factory worker from the 19th century
In next video they could both be canadian lumberjacks.
This needs more views!
My gay fangirl heart.... can I just mention how Mitch /doesn't/ have 20 different fabulous outfits (each more colorful and fashionable than the last) in this video. I'm shocked.
Still confused why Katy Perry is still more relevant than these guys...this is the most talent that has ever happened! Superfruit is GOLD.
OMG love it so much. Reminds me of the dangerous woman album!!!
I am affected, big time.
Waiting for Fantasy MV with Amber Liu <3
this is my favorite song and video so far, my weekly obssesion, the light and the camera movement is on point, I would give a million likes to this video if I could
Ahhhighhht! Loved Imaginary Parties, LOVED Sexy Ladies, Super Loved Heartthrob - admittedly mostly 'cause I couldn't get enough of vid. for that one - but this, *this* song has a no $ girl buying the album.
I'm a simple girl. I see a new video from superfruit. I click it and up vote it right away. And I wasn't disappointed! Awesome work guys
unlike justin beibers new song, this song will NEVER get old.
2:04 When someone laughs at my girlfriends joke.
Legit. I started sobbing in the middle of class because of this video. T h a n k s.
this brought me back to life
I want to play this song till it leaks through my ears. Fun. :)
At 0:11 Mitch reminds me of Mario but in a good way
Mitch makes me think of Freddie mercury with that look
Scott NEVER make the faces you made in the video EVER again
fans: SCOMICHE HAS TO BE REAL \nI try but I can't deny....\nfans: COME ONNNNN
OH MY GOSH! LOVE THIS COUPLE!
1:15 Dadddyyyyyy
the concept 😭😭😭😭😍💜
<3
loooooooooooooooooooooove it!!!!!!
Oh my godddd hes everywhere 💙💙💙
Mitch looks like victor from despicable me
Pornstache
The. Mustache. Though.
Mitch:trigger the gun..\nMe:Oh no. I'm dead.
mitch best look
Mitch is giving me Vinny from Atlantis vibes
my absolute favorite <3
ON REPEAT!
As expected, Another BOP
Fucking iconic
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
Love this one!!
just...... DAMN!
AAAAAAA SO gOoD
I’m obsessed
They're married
you're my Robin lmao
MITCH IS SINGING ABOUT SCOTT HOLY CRAP
Mitch, please shave...you look like a creeper 👀
Mitch please shave off your moustache!! 😂😭😭 I love you so much and your the queen but please do that!
omg scott is making me straight in this vidio haha
Oh yeah how were people created then May GOD have mercy on your soul  And I'll praye that you come to GOD be for it is to late we are in the end time s GOD will  give you everlasting life in HIS KINGDOM  if you repent of your sins to HIM because JESUS willingly gave his life for our sins and I'm 21:-P
Why does Mitch look like a pedophile (Its a joke!!)
SONG CODEWORD FOR BIGGER WORSER MASSACRES OF AMERICANS \nTHIS SHIT PYSOP CANCER CONDUCTED \nBY ILLUMINAT FUCKS HAS GOTTEN OLD QUICK \nTIME T O  S P I L L THE  B L O O D OF THOSE WHO SPILL B L O O D\n#DUEtoRACISM #DUEtoNARCISSISM #DUEtoGREED #FUCKBIGGOTRY #FUCKSATANISM
Scott says like 2 words in this song lol
God damn I have never been more attracted to Scott in my life. I know he's cute and all but they did an amazing job turning him into forbidden fruit. I feel like I'm hung up on Scott too now lol
i love them, and LOVE this song, but is this video supposed to be a joke ?? im lost - they almost look serious but at the same time its so much that it must be fake
Julien: I don't do drugs\n\nMe: Yeah...you sure about that?
When he starts doing the Shane impression 😅😂 I died
I honestly love the aggressive Shane at the end 😂😂😂😂
i love them both to death
This is the type of relationship i want 😭
Julien looks like he’s about to chop wood when he wears plaid
Why can't I flap my pack!\nFucking dead.
someone should make a compilation of them saying “paint me like one of your french girls”
Julien has to play PUBG in that second outfit!
ok but she bought him vineyard vines Jenna didn't come to play games
That polo shirt looked A1 on him
Not gonna lie I really really really like how Julian looks with his daddy outfit, I would totally fuck him!! Mmmm oh daddy’O hahahhaha
why does julien actually sound like shane
WHERE DID YOU GET THE PANDA UNDIES?
I've been here since 124k subs
He looks like my dad in that Puma outfit.
Julian looks hot as a dad✌️️
thumbs up for the brawny man
It's my time of the month and I'm dying. It's only the first day and I'm having cramps that are equal to day 1-7 put together. But Jenna and Julian are making me laugh so that's good
Cookie Monster and chill I'm done 😂😂😂
The 3rd outfit reminds me of my hot chemistry teacher
I've watched this an abnormal amount of times and every time I end up peeing my pants
This was soo hilarious! ! I love you guys! Julien reminded me of Alan from the hangover with that fanny pack, !! Lmao!!
You're missing the apostrophe in 'Boyfriends'.
He is so handsome
Julien looked so good in the red flannel and jean jacket outfit
He actually suits the dad outfit
You guys are a great, funny couple. As for trolling Julian-- well, he's a clothes horse; looks good in anything.
Hey that Herschel stuff is literally as dope as it gets in Canada. There's a hat that matches that fanny pack. It's light acid wash tie dye in denim, its tight.
you should do a video of trying to solve riddles theres a youtube video called 7 Mystery Riddles Only the Smartest 5% Can Solve
omg vineyard  vines is EVERYWHERE in MA and I didn't even realize that people from elsewhere don't even know of it. vineyard vines is as popular here as like, the colour blue
Next video Pierce Julian's earsss like at home #ParentTrapStyle ✋
9:05 isn't he already wearing the third outfit
The first outfit looks like Julian was a basketball player in high school, got a scholarship, never made it then turned into a high school basketball coach
Bunny and Jenna have the same jacket lol
The ripped jeans and jacket makes him look hella LA sexy haha nice fall outfit!
I am LIVING for that dad outfit!!!! lol
Missing an apostrophe in the title!
trade all of our stocks
Okay but y’all are goals and Julien looks good in anything wtf 😂
Make takeshi's castle for your dogs
I WANT THE LIL SEBASTIAN SHIRT
Jenna = middle aged aunt who loves to buy shot for her nephew \n\nJulien = dad. Straight up dad
Julien’s first outfit looks like a gym coach at a public school
He needs a bunch of Gushers in his fannypack!
Julian is such a great doll!
I love both of these outfit videos 😂😂❤️ Aw
I died when they said donk, I don't know why, but I just lost it

Hi Jenna! I'm from Russia. I want to tell you that you're very cool, funny and you give a positive! Every video I laugh and have fun! Do not listen to those bastards who write nasty things to you! Probably their lives are full of shit so they want to spoil the mood of others. Because a happy person can not be so evil! you are very beautiful and funny girl! every time when I have a bad mood - I turn on your video and it gets better)))) continue to please your subscribers!!!!
JULIEN IS A HOT DAD HOLY FUCK
Julian is my favorite person right now! He reminds me of Zach Galifianakis!
Literally crying at the Lil Sebastian part 😂 I love Julien so much more now
I think that was a pirouette
Julien's enthusiasm for L'il Sebastian just made my entire day
Actually.... I wanna see you actually play basketball!!!! One on one with Julian!!!!!! Do it, just do it bish!!!!!!!!!!
8:45 WHERE CAN I BUY THAT BOMB ASS CASE???
buy my dogs outfits? 🤔
Getting serious NSYNC vibes from Jenna’s outfit
The canadian tux outfit looks sooo goood!
God, I can't wait for this. If you guys at Syfy are finally making good shows, I think it's fine for them to not always be the genre your name dictates.
Ever wonder what happened to Elliot Stabler of Law & Order: SVU? Well we found out.
You had me at Christopher Meloni dabbing while his head was a blood fountain... AND ITS OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!
There must be something seriously wrong with me... Because I am going to enjoy the crap out of this show!
I GOTTA see this.
When Stabler misses Olivia...
Elliot. Plz come back.
I see Detective Stabler and I am down.
Detective Stabler???? Ha - this looks like a trip. Kind of it to it tho, plus I like how the scenes are shot & edited.
This looks like what happened after SVU's Detective Stabler put in his retirement papers and just went on a never-ending downward spiral.
Looks like a discount Deadpool, no costume.
LONG LIVE GRANT MORRISON!!!
This. Looks. AMAZING!!!!!!!
you lost me at dabbing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...but you got me at graphic novel and the plot!
this looks like a youtube s**tpost turned  into a tv series...
Welcome back Meloni!
So no crank 3 :(
Reminds me of I man.
This looks so good!
sooooo a cop with a cartoon character, hmmm....reminds me of another movie with the same concept...
This will be a hard R right? Not that it will full of violence but no uses of the F-word and stuff? Don't know what the policy of SYFY is.
For some reason I want to hear Carpenter Brut - Roller Mobster on one of the episodes. Can you imagine?
Anyone know the song in the beginning when he’s dancing?
WHAT IS THIS I DON'T EVEN
Anyone know the song they used? It kind of reminded me of Prodigy. Would like to hear more.
i know ya seen that dab at 00:13
I'd watch anything with Chris Meloni in it.
Why he left SVU?  He was my favorite character.
Meloni is doing the batman voice
I love how the blood just came rushing out when he dabbed
At the end of this show series, he is finally arrested and sent to jail under the name Chris Keller.
where do i get that disco jingle bells track?
What is the song in this trailer?
I REALLY hope this is as good as it looks .... and not another Son of Zorn
gota see this !!!!
This looks amazing
The Animation on him Blew me away! This is a Television Show, Could a TED TV Show be possible now?!
So excited for this.  Syfy just keeps on getting better and better as a network. I hope this continues that trend.
Eu tenho o encadernado da Devir. Apesar de ser bem violenta a história é o maior barato. Muito ansioso por esta série. Acho que não vai dar errado.
Drugs. Lots of drugs.
DROP DEAD FRED!
Shows have gotten fucking weird.
Come back to SVU
Amazing!!!
This looks amazing!!
Поезд сделал БУМ!
This. Looks. Amazing!
Beginning scene remind me of Rorschart
I was kinda in, then the cartoon thing showed up and I was way out.
This looks amazing.
Wow. This looks really good.
this looks amazing
I think you got one, Syfy\n 😂😂😂
entertain you with violence.. And then cry their agenda all over the place.....
awesome trailer,  I can't wait for this
Manoooo que fodaa ansioso pra ver já!
Pause at :49. I swear one of these paramedics is Jon snow
Ohhh i definitely will be watching this!
I've never really been into Syfy shows but this looks amazing! I am so watching this!!!
oh heck ya! I'm excited for this
😍 #FuckYeah
Added to my list of stuff to watch.   This is going to be a riot.. one way or the other.
meh, blood drive was better.
well atleast its new
And you cancelled Dark Matter for this? Why should I watch anything you make when that show had just as high (if not higher) ratings than your other shows. I will not invest my time in your shows. You only cancel them -- even if they are going strong.
Is that the Las Vegas shooter?
In the final episode he goes to mandalay bay and shoots everybody
Sephora better come back to the UK soon
We know what you mean 😅😭😂😂😂😂😂27 years go girl I love you 😘
omg thought i was the only one with a fear of holes 😳 never knew it was actually a thing lol

Be careful with the Dr. Jart, most Korean products have skin whitening effects!
Beautiful and fun as always. :-) I love watching your makeup videos, but I don't have your gorgeous skin tone... Are there any pale-girl makeup tutorial artists you'd recommend?
Does anyone know the shade of the lip liner that she used?
it made me laugh when you said fear of textures i thought i was the only one!!! one time my mom accidentally left the iron board on a wood stand we had well i guess it wasn't real wood and it made this bubbly texture it freaked me out so bad and i was scared to look at it and i could never explain it. Thanks for explaining that.

Tree bark? Hope still like trees since it's keeping us breathing lol
This is the best foundation on you
I just moved and my new room is giving me anxiety. I'm watching this video so Pat can calm my nervous butt down while unpacking. I'm gonna treat myself to a mask after finishing up. 
you're so hot
3:33 I know exactly what you were thinking XD 20 and not all that mature in regards to those kinds of jokes.
I don't like texture like tree bark and little holes it's perfectly normal hahahaha no its not
You should try to he Korean brand innisfree
BlackUp is always a no for me.
That lip is beyond amazing
I'm finally 18!!!
Throwing shade at us BIG HEADED FOLKS!! 🤔😂😂😘
Pleeeeeease don’t promote black. Up it’s a very racist company to simplify their disturbing origin.
Your face looks amazing! Really like this face combo!
the sort hair really suits you, you look beautiful
babe, zoeva 102 silk finish is brush for foundation, it gives really full coverage and blends out like beauy blender!!
I have this foundation and it's amazing. My skin is dry and sensitive and I would recommend it without hesitation!
I’m not gonna say it cause I’m a Christian 😂
Omg, I'm right there with you on the tiny holes and textures! It literally freaks me out and makes my skin crawl!
My kind of video!
WOW I CAN'T STOP WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS! AMAZING DARLING KEEP IT UP!
I’m so happy that I found your channel. Love your reviews
I know exactly what you was going to say 😂🤣. I get you give, i get you.
I really enjoy shopping in Sephora, and I'm starting to use more of their own brand items
I'm 12 but SUPER dirty minded, I get what you mean
23 years in the house boo :*
Youuuu are golddddddddddddddd.  What color is that lip liner??
Patricia there's a three month old fyi ~
I saw someone else use that mask and I thought the same thing. 😂. It’s one reason I won’t be trying it.   I have a thing about certain textures or whatever.   I just cannot.
You look really different without makeup on. Not saying it's a bad thing as your pretty with or without makeup. It's just unusual how different you look. Your eyes especially.
Yassss so excited for the triple uploads!! Always need more Patricia in my life!!
Old enough to get the joke😩😂💕
You’re too much 😂😂😂 with your little mind 😂😂
Always beautiful whatever you wear, actually makes me want to start wearing make-up x
my fav brush is anastasia renaissance palette brush, it makes all that lines that you want, i never liked any palette brushes before that one
Anyone know What song is playing at the beginning?
I love how well u edit your videos
3:43 min “I’m a Christian” WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THE SAME OMG
I love the Sephora brand foundation-- it's about the only thing that doesn't freak my skin out, so if you have sensitive skin/combination, it is WONDERFUL.
13
Patricia I would like to ask you something in regards my personal experience, maybe you have had the same experience. I was wondering if there's private message on her thanks x

social media doesn’t help with this in modern times. we need to understand a lot of thoughts aren’t put into words, and everyone has felt negative emotions. you are not alone.
Am I the only one here that actually prefers to be alone for an extended period of time?
I feel lonely and odd because I'm lonely and odd.
Because Jesus isn't in their heart without him you'll feel empty. Triggered comments put below👇👇👊
Love this video. Thanks again School of Life
At 1:56-1:57 the black character has an erection.
This is the product of an extremely conceited and closed mind to not realize that the experiences and thoughts of others are even present and is rather superficial. If one if only able to see the outside of a person then that person lacks the basic empathy or at least the cognitive ability needed to understand the point of view of anyone who is not themselves. This video plays up the feeling that people believe that no one could possibly relate to them.
oh my god all of you are so stupid god loves us and the gays he even loved hitler for gods shakes i love snakes omg and 3 lol
needed this right now, thank you.
Poetry is the science of the awake unconscious speaking to the state of living.
Another reason we (or I) wear masks, is that I'm currently unable to articulate the person that I feel I am inside, so wearing a mask is easier. Sometimes the body lacks the precision to move and speak in the way I feel I truly am. It's not all down to anxiety.
Here's a video suggestion. Could you please do one about the obsession we have for our birthdays?
Please make a video about immature or childish thing :(
I don't know if this is a great idea or not. Sometimes I wonder if I throw my weight around online too much simply by offering suggestions (for content). Or, maybe I think I am more powerful than I actually am (because of my brilliant suggestions). It seems like, if not School of Life, then another place should do an episode on social statistics, and what they actually mean. I'm autistic, and I've read that autistic people usually end up trapped in working class-like situations, regardless of where we start. I look at that and think rather than I'm going to beat these statistics, I think Ahhh, I'm doomed! There's no way out! The good psychologist or sociologist asks why, and what causes a statistic to be. The good epistemologist asks a) Does knowing a statistic like this count as self-knowledge and b) Is it better to know this, or is it better not to know? It's The Meno Problem right?
These days i feel less lonely when i am around books , dogs and nature .Being in a group of people makes be extremely lonely ..i really dont like the shallow talks , selfies ,snapchat and gossiping about others .i especially vowed never to go to a dinner with somebody who uses phone all the time .
Just moved into uni and was putting myself down because I'm not as good at socializing as my flatmates, but then I thought how far I've come, making friends with course mates and having long conversations with new people because a few years back I never would have been able to do that :') I feel a tad lonely, but I guess everyone else does at this stage as well
Its why I think I'm alien to my own species. Most times I just feel like everyone is out for themselves and only need you when they want something.
This animation art is wonderful !!! I am amazed !!!
I love seeing depressed people self loathe like total retards. I kinda pity them. Just to feel bad for themselves. It's edgy, retarded, and doesn't help depression.
School of life should do a literature video on Anthony Burgess/ F Scott Fitzgerald/ or like John Wyndham or HG Wells they've all got a form of literature with meaning
I just want to thank you for all the videos you do and the hardwork you put in them. I really enjoy them. Also, the essays you write , i read them when i wake up for school and they always get me thinking. Keep up the good work 💛
Plain and Simple, Start a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ and let him fill your heart, Never let your flesh control you which are focused more on the world which is the pride and lust and sex, drugs and alcohol, Etc.\n\nMoney and possessions and lust won't fill your heart and you will never experience life and peace and joy and everlasting life unless you come to repentance and get to learn of Lord Jesus Christ and let him enter your heart and when that does happen, What a great blessing it is Amen, Not even wicked people and satan and his demons can't do anything about it because God of Israel is mighty and strong and in control, Never doubt the Father from the heavens and know that he is for you and not against you.\n\nThis society, lifestyle, This system in countries and schools and teachings and knowledge and possession and money and religions around the world isn't from God, Their from man, Man made, True Relationship with Lord Jesus Christ is where the truth is at, You only have to be willing to run into the Father's mighty arms and let him embrace you and let him change your heart brand new through the blood of Lord Jesus Christ, Spiritually amen.\n\nIf you take Jesus out of your region you won't be safe, You take his commandments down and don't even keep it, Your in danger, you continue to mixture yourself with demons that only want to bring you down with them in the Lake of fire and be destroyed, You are in grave danger that only in Jesus name is able to break and destroy the devil strong holds and evil curses as well, Nothing is too hard for the Lord, They all tremble before God because He is mighty and strong and soon destroy them, And how terrifying it will be if you made that choice to join along foolishly in their greater damnation, Jesus brings True liberty and salvation and sweet victory, America, and all these things won't give you anything, Your life is only rough and hard because you choose not to listen to the Father calling, He is able to bring you up and you will supplied and will be blessed, As long as you keep following Jesus and not yourself and this world Amen.\n\nYou people laugh and smirk and think evilly before God, you people, don't you know that God has not forgotten what you did wrong? your not safe and will never be, But God is being very patient and merciful for you because he loves you unconditionallay, Get away from wickedness you people, No matter what color or race, You are made in the image of God physically and spiritually, You cannot escape from God's mighty judgment, he will judge the righteous and the wicked, The righteous will have life but the wicked will perish, Turn to the  Father you people no matter how your situation is, Come to him if not then God will be far from you and you will cry and none will hear, You will call for help but none will help, You people how long will you anger God? he loves you just get up and be serious about your life, CALL UPON JESUS NAME and let him deliver you and draw near to God and he will draw near to you and you will be reborn again and then will your cry and it will be heard from the Father, he will deliver you and when call upon him for his help and he will deliver you and help you, when you are in pain and trouble, Child don't let sorrow break you, The Father loves you for all things have a purpose and he will take vengeance for you, You see these sad people child, don't be bitter and do not let hate overtake you and never let go of love, Lust ain't love throw that away, Lift up True Love inside your heart Child and that's Lord Jesus Christ, look to the Father and let him help you, In the end, your painful experience is a blessing and it will shine bright, All souls belong to Jesus, never doubt the father, You people how long will you choose to follow evil and not Good? Don't waste your life and your purpose God has created you for, don't waste yourself for folly things that are pointless if it won't encourage you and bring you closer to Jesus and bring your faith to shine more, it is not worth it, Following Jesus is amen, He will comfort you and wipe your tears and remind you of his unfailing love for you, For He is your true father from above in the heavens amen, He is a Father to the fatherless, don't mess with them because if God hears their precious cries and tears then you will be destroyed, God is a judge for the widows, Don't mess with them because God will judge you and you'll be in great trouble, God is an Awesome and Fair God, God of Israel Amen.\n\nIf there's no love which is Jesus, Then people will error greatly and follow their own way and it may seem good outside and they may try to use history to back up their foolish imaginations, but inside them, it isn't the truth, neither is it good, And Good works will never be enough to enter into the Kingdom of God only through Lord Jesus Christ, who paid our debt and did it for us, You only have to believe and have Faith, not belief and your feelings those are entirely different from Faith and believing, having a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ who is God is the Good news and the Truth Amen.\n\nThere are sad people on this world that rather reject God and go after the world which is pointless and no hope for them unless they be willing to turn to the Father, Jesus can change a wicked sinner into a beautiful, clean saint, And how beautiful it is indeed, You won't learn from anything from this video neither anything else but from God's words alone, The Holy Bible King James Bible Amen, You have to take everything from God's words literally and ask for Jesus for Guidance and help in his words and you will see, You will understand that others will not because everyone is different and unique, Just like the stars God created for example, Each having names and each being very unique and beautiful, But for you, You are much more to God then the Stars, God of Israel Loves You Unconditionallay and you will always be important to God but if you continue to live in sin, Don't do it, Go any deeper and there will be no hope for you and there will be no way for you to come to repentance, But it is never too late right now while there is still time, Jesus is able to restore the soul and deliver everyone from falling, You only need to look deep into God's words and learn from him Amen.\n\nWhat will you do? Get up and get away from being comfortable to this world, Living for Jesus Christ is worth it Amen, There are greater things ahead that this world will never understand but only in Jesus alone, God knows your heart and there's no hiding anything from him, You can hide in a cave but that still won't hide yourself from him, It's a very very very terrible, Dreadful and terrifying experience to be standing against a Strong and Powerful Living God who created you and form you with a purpose, But how a great blessing and beautiful it is to stand with our True Father God who is Mighty and Strong, God can do the impossible and never doubt him, He's GOD OF THE LIVING! GOD OF ISRAEL AMEN.
I needed this right now, thanks for helping me feel better :)
Because you hang out in front of your computer all day!
ever since I was a kid ppl thought I was a weirdo so I embrace that shit, makes life easier and much more fun when I can do whatever the fuck I want and ppl are like oh well that's just dynp being dynp also you're not fukkin alone. I'm a juggalo and I know there are a shit ton of weirdos out there JUST LIKE ME who like the same shit I do and don't give a fuck. whoop whoop!
art? not so sure abut that. especially with it being so subjective.
Loneliness is that feeling to be stranger; the fact is that we're all strangers to each other. We live between two worlds; the inside and the outside, if you focus in the one of the inside, you'll fall in anxiety, depression and anguish and if you just focus in one of the outside you'll lose your confidence in yourself and you fall in the same illness. The other is a book, be courageous and go to the library and chose a book. Open it and start reading. We're all strangers.
This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all. Neither has love.
Such as amazing Channel. They  never teach this in school. And if so , it feels to technical (Lack of feeling and association. Like robots). \n\nThis channel deserves more subs like 7 billion!
Please translate it to Arabic
You have got a very limited set of topics for your videos. I feel like i've watched this one already five times. Also I wonder how lonley and odd you feel Alain de Botton, and weather talking about it over and over again helps you with it. Hearing about it over and over again sure doesn't help me a lot.
Reminds me of we judge others on their actions, and judge ourselves on our intentions
I think you're wrong with this one, School of Life. Sometimes you just have to cope with realizing that you're odd. Sometimes trying to connect with people on a deeper level is great for realizing that their insides are different from what they portray externally, but it's also great for realizing that who they are internally is still very different from who you are internally. Sometimes you really are just odd and you have to embrace that.
Feedback: been subscribed for about two years now. I wish you guys would make more videos that feature actors or even real world scenarios. Actually I also loved your videos about the great philosophers... if there aren't any of them left to do then what about other notable artists or famous people like, I dunno... JFK, Martin Luther King or Lady Gaga.
Maybe you think you know yourself but your mama thinks she knows better but your psychiatrist says you're both wrong then the priest says nah you're all clueless...none knows the 100% truth so there is no such thing as you...or they ..just an idea
I like the love illustration. Who did it?
This describes me too  well
I feel lonely because I lost all my friends when they left to different colleges.
This explains why I'm honest and blunt with my character.\nMy character helps people be more comfortable being themselves around me.
This video gives points that are completely subjective. How does this shit get on trending? Who did you pay?
I deeply and truly appreciate these videos and this narrator's work.
Can you do a Literature episode about Balzac?
I don't agree with this silly generational we are all ultimately the same, share the same experiences, the same thoughts and feelings. I talk to people lots and meet very few who have same or similar thoughts, feeling and experiences as me.
worship 1 GOD, \nVerily only with the remembrance of god do hearts find peace-Quran
What a coincidence. I just watched a video from SciShow Psych on a very similar feeling. They called it imposter syndrome. It's a feeling of inadequacy in successful people and thinking their success was only based on luck and that other people deserve more admiration than they do. I think you mentioned it at one point in the video.
Birth we come alone. Death we leave alone.
I AM NOT LONELY! I FEEL SO ATTACKED BY THIS
Another pretentious video. We feel odd because life is fucking strange it's that simple.
Because we have no God.
I will have to rewatch that several times to really get the idea behind this animation. For now I can tell, these are some beautiful illustrations!
I feel like you guys are rehashing your old stuff
no because of society
because we are odd and alone
This is so accurately and beautifully expressed
Hello friends, have a great day, love you
This is why reading introspective literature is so important! This is reading Kafka, ladies and gentleman! Then you can easily imagine what others in you life are going through and how they are in the inside, which is very much like yourself, which is very comforting.
Really? But I use mINS reading and individualism. I simply don't care what people think and expose my true self as much as possible.
the sketch was kinda depressing :/
man, I don't know how you choose your topics, but please keep up what you're doing.\none of the best channels on youtube.
I have spent 5 years listening to the inner reality of women's lives. http://www.collectingconversations.com Our stories may differ but we are very similar.
Truly beautiful animations! I loved when the lead character turned off the light to reveal everyone else’s deep, neon mysteries.
Life every day is happy or sad thats your life you should choose to take one of this in your life be successful and dont forget me
Is it ok to think that we should act fake so we don't put others down or bore them? I feel like we are our own individuals and that we can choose how we want to feel, but a lot of people do not think that way and expect others to entertain them or serve their interest the way they want.
I feel lonely because I decided to ditch my toxic friends and ex-partner. Now I'm too busy turning my life around studying uni via correspondence in the small rural town I live in to make friends with people I have nothing in common with. So for now, until I meet other people passionate about Science, I am lonely.
Moral of the video. Don’t care what people think because we all go through the same inner battle we try to fight
Well shit... looks like one of those solutions is hopeless for me... -_-
It's hard to make new friends when you have none because you forgot how.
Uhhhhh I know I'm odd... I have sex with dogs... that's pretty disgusting in everyone else's view points... but I find that eating animals out of enjoyment is disgusting... I could never eat pork or pig... I do eat chicken but I always feel sad and guilty while eating it for needed nourishment to help my skin disease.. :(
For me it doesn't help that my parents have told me when I overreact or don't react normal/properly to simple things such as when I feel annoyance or sadness or hate. I once became so upset with a person because they tricked the teachers, lied multiple times a day, and yet they were proud of this and others did not seem to think badly of them. My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).
Hi School of Life. Can you write an essay regarding gratification excesses found mostly on social media usage? And idenitfy newly adoptive practices of communication influenced by rapid tech advancements? Since you emphasize that well being is so important, I believe you ahould begin to study this behaviours.\nP.S Your videos always help me understand human weirdness. This is a positive thing, haha.
i’m so in love with this art
YES! I relate so much! Thanks SOL!!
I tend to not talk about some stuff like anime and video games (two things that are a big part of my life) with people I don't really know well just because there can be a negative connotation that comes with people who like that sort of thing. I've never been bullied or criticized for liking that stuff, in fact, all of my close friends are into at least one of those things. I'm just afraid of people thinking the wrong thing about me I guess.
ive learned i enjoy life a hell of a lot more on my own.  im happy being lonely!!
AALIYAH MADE THIS FROM BEYOUND THE GRAVE........
делайте пожалуйста русские субтитры!

BETTER THAN THERAPY

wow best video ever
As french people, this title does not mean anything... I guess you wanted to say Pourquoi nous nous sentons SEULS et étranges
I'm lonely cuz most people are retards.
Jesus knows you completely and loves you unconditionally. Have a moment with Him and ask Him to live in your heart.
1:05 When will tSoL stop the sex obsession?? That is literally pornography!!
Dear School of Life,\nPlease stop stalking your subscribers, you are always uploading videos exactly when we need it to the point where it gets a little eery.
1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\n\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\n\n( Die Normalsten sind die kränkesten und die Kranken sind die gesündesten. )\n\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \n\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\n\n Well, isn't that good news??\n\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \n\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\n\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \n\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \n\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\n\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \n\n\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \n\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\n\n You are human beings nonetheless.\n As far as one can see\n Of the same species as myself \n\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\n\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!
To be fair,  people you know could also know you better than yourself.
Okay so like if tangled like Rapunzel‘s mother got healed by golden flower what if Elsa got her powers from a frozen flower?  *MIND BLOWN* ( OR what if when Elsa’s mother was pregnant she got struck by the frozen flower which is itself has the opposite effect of the golden flower so the golden flower is good and the frozen flower is bad) just a theory 😂
If this is true then you can also say that Troll and flower represent two siblings. One is hard will (rock like trolls) and one is free sprite (like a sun flower). Both traits which is carry one to their daughters with magical abilities.
I thought Elsa nd Rapunzel were twins cuz both have powers. Elsa was sent to Arendale to live with her aunt nd uncle  nd became Anna's sissta. Thhannnn anna elsas parents diee but first give birth to Tarzan. Also Janee is Bells descendant cuz of the dress nd teacup nd kettle ... 🤔🤔🤔
Theres that theory that Maui created the golden flower. Pretty cool
Could John Smith survive the jump off the boat in Pocahontas??
Today's problem is whether or not those two are siblings
I would totally go for the hair if it wasn't for that song. Just imagine you were to help someone who was just badly injured in a car crash or something. You run up to that person, wrap your hair around him or her (which is, now that I think about it, an exceptionally strange thing to do) and then... break into song?! Idk, seems like a weird move in such a serious situation...
This makes sense because Rapunzel went to the coronation in frozen
Not to mention, Flynn and Rapunzel can be seen entering Elsa's coronation. Would a sister or COUSIN not want to attend said sister/cousins time of ascending?
I liked this video the moment he mentioned hot pockets' heat status
Trying to figure out whether I believe this theory more or MatPat's theory more...
I think I would like to have both powers but if I had to choose I would choose the hair because then I could do so much with my hair
I have a question about Nemo. Why was he caught on the other side of the ocean to be put into a fish tank?
ICE! then i could be like iceman!\niceman is seriously COOL.
GEEEEZZZ!  Leave the relationShips to OTPs, please!\n\nWhy not just say all the princess are really sisters separated at birth and the whole stepmother thing is just one big foster program, while you're at?!?! (I rage-typed that, by the way.)
Definitely ice powers. #thecoldneverbotheredmeanyway. That's what comes of growing up in Minnesota.
I'd choose ice powers
i think mat pat's theory made more sense
I have a theory for you just do a Jelsa theory
Maybe Ariendelle is a magic country and Anna is unfortunatly a fluke child. #RipMagicAnna
Ice Powers please they are so cool
Have you seen the new STAR WARS trailer! I was just thinking... Maybe Captain Phasma is IDEN. You know, the person that's in the new 'Star Wars Battlefront II' campaign trailers. Wouldn't that be COOL! It would fit in as well. Also, if IDEN is FINN's mother!!!!!!
Analyse the last Jedi trailer!!!! Please!!!!
I would choose ice powers cuz then I wouldn't only be the cool one one school I would also be the be the popular kid.
In Hocus Pocus Winifred turns to stone before bursting into dust but the other two witches only burst into dust.Why is this???
The hair I would look flawless
Can toys have sex or reproduce or must a toy be made by humans ?
omg, the new star wars tralior is out
This one is good. The Repunzal is Elsa and Anna's sister theory never made sense and had way too much reaching. But cousins def makes sense. \n\nI don't think Agnar was ever interested in magic though, given how he reacts to Elsa's magic (and he never goes back to them in later years either). I think he knew where to find the trolls because of his sister. Arianna was the explorer and researcher of magic. When they were children, she dragged him along, at some point, or maybe more than once, he met the trolls with her. That's how he knew to find them later.\n\nAlso this makes sense as to why Gothel couldn't eat the flower herself and retain its power. Clearly there is some sort of magic in Agnar and Ariannas family line. Not everyone has it but it appears in some. So that's why the cure helped Arianna (but didn't fundamentally change her) but Rapunzel had some gene or trait present within her that allowed the magic to take hold in her. (something that was dormant in Arianna but became activated in Zel)
0:00 Heyyyyy brother! Jay, it's BEN a while...
Anna & Elsa = not sisters\nRapunzal & Elsa =sisters \nSo therefore anna is elsa & Rapunzals sister.😊😀
Stay in the same place please u keep jumpin around
Film theory already covered this just to let you know
i don't understand though, how do they both have powers, so to say since Rapunzel's mother  was the only one to drink the tea of the flower. Wouldn't Elsa's mother have had to drink it as well in order for her to have powers? Also how is it it that Anna doesn't have powers?  I don't know however here is this video that also speaks about frozen and tangled this theory makes more sense though.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhf9dekzyq4\n\nBut i still wanna know more.
I'd choose the ice powers because I live in Florida and if I had ice powers I might actually go outside.
Maybe Olaf is related to Jack Overland? Lol
Wait, I thought the theory was that Elsa and Rapunzel were twins, not cousins.
Healing hair. Then I could heal myself/others when my inner clumsiness rears its ugly head.
YOU GUYS LIVE SO CLOSE TO ME I LIVE IN RADFORD AND DO YALL GO TO THE RONANOKE MALL AND THE PUPPY LOVE AHHHHHH IM FLIPPING OUT
Where did you get the Pixar red yellow and blue balls in the background?
Answer to the question at the end...ICE POWERS😆
Them being cousins makes way more since than them being sisters, Nice video!
Here's a question I want answered and it's about Toy Story 3. The monkey looks over the woody and everyone else by a security camera right. And the whole point of a security camera is record things like break ins and fires right, so the camera must be recording 24/7. So why hasn't the person who looks over the footage not see toys locking in other toys in shelves?
I have a theory for Zootopia. I noticed Judy is the smallist police officer, so for smaller animals particularly mice sized do they have their own police or are they free to do what they want without worrying about cops? IE. The godfather mouse and his gang. \nThats a little messed up I think?
STOP MAKING PIXAR AND GO BACK TO HARRY POTTER!!!!!!
what happened to that theory that Elsa is Rapunzels sister?
😱😱The flower part in Moana is mind blowing!!
If fire weren't an option, I would definitely go with the ice powers.
Hey Carlin Brothers!!!! I happen to notice that you guys didn't do a Harry Potter video having to do with a lot of things being in 7's. There are 7 books, 7 quidditch players, 7 floors in Hogwarts, etc. This needs to be explained!!!!!!!!
U should make a theory bout a connection of UP and IT
Dear stars we are just making a Pixar theory with Disney movies now aren't we? \nWonderful. Let's link the Marvel universe to Treasure Planet now. \n\nI'm not being sarcastic let's do it.
Answer to the question: Neither. I wanna teleport. If I get ice powers, I will freeze the world and hold it hostage until someone can give me teleporting powers.
Ya know how Ben said, “Gosh, why can’t Olaf just be related to someone else in the Disney universe?” Well he technically kills his brother if ya think about it.... I mean since Elsa is kind of like his mom since she made him and she also made the snow monster guy Olaf and Snowball would be brothers. So Ben technically Olaf WAS related to someone else in the Disney universe.
Ice powers. Becuase Elsa can do way more than just control ice. She can change people's outfits. She can change her makeup. She can make her hair pass through her shoulder.
It took me half the video before I realised he changed shirts LOL
Did you know the location in frozen is based on the norwegian terrain. By the way norway kind of suck
In toy story of terror, there is an accepts bnl credit card sticker
Ice powers, I like to keep my hair short lol
Ice\nLike if you agree
can you make a theory about why mother gothel isnt allowed to see pascal because when mother gothel is shouting rapunzel to let down her hair she says to pascal to not let her see him??
I don’t understand something about the Tarzan theory. If they where going to a wedding in the German kingdom of Corona departing from the Scandinavian kingdom of Arendelle than why the heck did their ship crash in Africa?\n\n\n\nP.S. It’s totally a German kingdom with names like Rapunzel, Eugene Fitzherbert, and Mother Gothel.
Theory: Anna is an only child and Rapunzel and Elsa are sisters\n[don't deny it, it makes sense]
Fun fact the Corona is a layer of plasma that surrounds the sun and it hotter than the sun's surface.
I have to say, didn't the director bring up the Tarzan relation and dismiss it in the same statement? Pretty much saying that this was their fantasy (with Surf's Up being on the other side of the island).
I will call you king 😍😂
Excuse me, what? Tarzan is their brother?? What's the use in establishing that now? Those stories are completely unrelated. Frozen is a fairy tale, magic, trolls, supernatural powers. Tarzan, despite the Disneyfication, happens in the real world. Also timelines and locations make no sense whatsoever.
well you would be PRINCE Ben because you would be the prince consort. maybe not king but its better than nothing. not half bad.
What if Elsa and Rapunzel were sisters? That'd explain Elsa's looks and powers. Also I'd probably prefer Rapunzel's hair with Elsa's powers, how am I supposed to choose?!
Ice
Ice Powers
ice
Know the story
TARZAN IS NOT RELATED to the sisters! I'm calling bullshit on the director's part. It literally doesn't make sense. Fight me.
....The Tarzan thing is them trolling you. Was I the only one who watched the Making of Frozen extra which was just one long musical number asking that then ending in We don't know!? That was when I realized that Disney, especially the people involved in Frozen, had learned how to troll and not to trust them. Which doesn't even touch on things like hair color not being the same...\n\nThat said, I do kinda like the cousin idea. It makes more sense and it's interesting.
I like the OUAT family line, loved the snow queen Ingrid
can do a theory about andy and molly's age for each toy story  movie
I heard another theory on Film Theory that said that Elsa is twin sisters with Ropunzel (sorry for the wrong spelling ) and that Anna is not real sisters with Elsa soooooo u need to tell me if maybe just maybe if this theory or the other theory makes more senses (u can also put them together and think up something) do a collab with him or something please

As an Englishman from the town of Hastings and with the 951st anniversary of the battle of 1066 looming, I think England needs to get back to what we've spent the best part of a 1000 years getting good at ... Pissing off the French!!!\n\nSo let's invade Calais, but only for a weekend booze cruise ...\nBecause, um yeah, apparently taking over other people's countries is a bad thing ...\nWoops, sorry! If only someone had told us that like a 1000 years ago - you know, the whole shit with Longshanks just nabbing Wales, Scotland and Ireland ... Yeah, sorry again!
American here. You guys are great.
Okay I binge watched your Videos the entire morning and now I have a crush on Arms. Thanks I guess 🙍🏻🙄
This is at the same time the most preachy and the most politically incorrect video I have seen in a long time. And I love it.
The ine with the glasses needs to become a solo artist so I can stan him.
How does Why Don't We get more views
Cant wait for them to split :)
HOLY SHIT I LOVE THEM ALL

Love the guitar solo and drop @ 02:57
Loved it! I love you're songs and you're pretty awesome voice!
How's your dad? Doctor Leff? HE TEACHES ME CHEMISTRY AT SCHOOL :D
Tf how relatable is this song !!!!!!
Not the most important thing but when i listened to The Other i thought it was a black artiste.His voice's so good i'm loving this
If you look closely , you'll see that there are strings attached to his shirt :))
Lauv got some amazing songs and talent but whack moves haha. Keep the grind up
You got a way of making me feel insane\n\nLike I can't trust my own brain\n\nUnless it's screaming your name\n\nI'd have it no other way\n\nI'd have it no other way\n\nAnd maybe that's why I stay\n\nHow many times can we pick up the same fight?\n\nCan we keep screaming all night\n\nAnd make up until it's light?\n\nThat's when I say that you're right\n\nAnd feel your body on mine\n\nOh, maybe that's why I stay\n\n \n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\n\nI could be with someone, making me happy\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nI could put my phone down\n\nJust pick up my keys\n\nI could let you go and we could let it be\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\n \n\nKeep coming back\n\nGuess you can say I'm attached\n\nLast time we called it a wrap\n\nI came begging and all that\n\nYou're like a habit, it's bad\n\nI gotta have it, it's bad\n\nOh no, I'm not even mad, no\n\n \n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\n\nI could be with someone, making me happy\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nI could put my phone down\n\nJust pick up my keys\n\nI could let you go and we could let it be\n\nBut that would be too easy, love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\n \n\nIt's the way you keep me up all night\n\nIt's the way you make me lose my mind\n\nEvery time I'm saying one more night\n\nIt's the way you know I'm yours\n\nIt's the way you know I'm yours for life\n\n \n\nI could be somewhere, chilling on a beach\n\nI could be with someone, making me happy\n\nBut that would be too easy love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love\n\nI could put my phone down\n\nJust pick up my keys\n\nI could let you go and we could let it be\n\nBut that would be too easy, love\n\nAnd I don't want no easy love
Followed you from day one on Soundcloud with The Other and I gotta say, this track is just as huge! Keep doing what you're doing bro. Killing it
i will be so happy if they got so much more view and more recognized but low-key dont like it too if they get too mainstream.

the vibes on this tho😭❤️
Where he says I could be with someone making me happy, I though he said I could be with someone making me a beat. I can't hear. Its terrible. And yes I'm being serious. So don't verbally attack me. I did not mean the song was terrible. I love it. Had to clarify that.
I swear all of his songs are LIT
So smooth when that electric guitar kicks in
listen to it in 0.75 speed
Waiting for you here in PH :)
Am I the only one who wants the jean jacket he was sporting????
baby i was so scared when she shattered that glass... my poor husband
I like this song why didnt become so popular
I love this song <3
I love your music! And this song is great! <3
Just wanted to say I was here
Everything he does is art
I Like Me Better\nA Different Way\nEasy Love\nPerfect 👌
No one is probably going to read this,\nBut i don't mind writing it because I feel at least one person will read it.\n\nI'm an artist pursuing my dreams & pray that my dream will someday be a reality. I have my latest video up on my channel & would love the support from anyone. \n\nEither leaving a like on this comment, liking one of my videos or subbing to my channel would mean a lot to me. \n\nJust some simple views & subs can get me closer to living my dreams. Thank you:)

damn youtube recommendations stepping up their game
Omg Hannah I've commented this before and I am honestly sorry for repeating myself, but if you like your romantic comedy tropes deconstructed, then give Crazy Ex Girlfriend another go!!!  I swear every other favourites video you give me another reason to be sure that it's basically made for you. But, you know, no pressure. :)
I work in technical theatre and I had the opportunity to shadow the touring stage manager for Wicked one year. Best experience of my life, that show is amazing!! \nI’ve never had a chance to experience an Immersion theatre show, but I get so excited every time I hear about one. I’m so glad you shared!!
not loving the higher fps used for talking vlogs, theres so little visual information needed in these videos that they always have the feeling of being fast forwarded (esp with hannah's naturally fast paced delivery)\n\ngreat favorites video otherwise!
Can you film a video where you show all the books on your bookshelf and mention a few of your faves and why. You have so many books I really want to hear some good recommendations.
The actos name from the big sick is Kumail Nanjiani and I highly recommend his stand up and maybe even more so his twitter. Seriously it's a treasure box! I love that guy. oh and while I'm at it, he's in the show silicon valley. Also amazing.
What's with the 720p50? Why 50?
I want to recommend the TV show Looking! It's really great!
I LOVE The Virgin Suicides movie. Would you say the book is worth it? I'm not sure if I should read it.
i adore EE jewellery!! so jealous they sent you all their beautiful stuff
I love the Eclectic Eccentricity jewellery, so pretty. Last month I read quite a few books, but at the moment I'm reading The Sun and Her Flowers which is beautiful. Also I've been loving the articles on the sex and relationship site neutral.love - which I think you'd probably enjoy. :)
It'd be a shame if someone did a video with Boyinaband
Thanks for the recommendations, Hannah! \n\nI finally got around to seeing Jessica Jones ... great show! I also watched Mr. Robot, which was weird but good. I've mostly been enjoying my writing class in my spare time, though. :)
Can I just recommend that you watch a film called I am me it's heartbreakingly beautiful and British
some nice favourites you have there :)
and i am here sitting and waiting for a fionas apple record. and she releases an album once every 7 years or so.
We did the same with House of Cards! We'd already watched it though, so we started the new series just after GOT finished *I had the void too...*I also love how you described it as GOT in the Whtie House as that's how i describe it to people! Along with Game of Thrones meets West Wing :P\n\n i also really recommend Designated Survivor, if you're looking for one AFTER House of Cards. Isn't Kevin Spacey AMAZING? One of the best actors and it only gets better!\n\nI'm also a huge Reese fan, ever since her Legally Blonde days - i just went to see the musical on friday night in Bristol and it reminded me how much i adore the film! It's also so lovely to see the jewellery brand on here as i discovered them on Not on The Highstreet a few years ago :) As ever, your videos never fail to bring a smile to my day! xxx
The star actor in The Big Sick is Kumail Nanjiani.
I'm seeing wicked november 8th with my school chorus! How is it? :)
You came to Toronto and didn't say :(   Yeah, it's cool here, 'cept when the winters suck xD
Hannah your brows are on point girl
Wicked is good Hamilton is the best! Highly recommended
You have the best favourites videos
thank you! ( your hair texture is first class, Hannah! you are looking Gorgeous, I like you very much, obviously!) thanks! good night! what's next? have a wonderful happy week ahead! thanks!
i read it only happens in the movies yesterday, it’s the first book i’ve read all the way through in about 3 years (i used to read all the time and went off it completely) it was so good, planning on reading the spinster club ones next
House of Cards is my favourite netflix series EVER! Wicked is also my favourite musical so i'm all over this favourites video :)
My September favourite was definitely meeting you and Lucy at Buffer Fest :)
You're jumper looks so cosy... where's it from?
Have you found your perfect man yet?
I love The virgin suicides :)
I loved Holly's book! and those jewellery pieces look beautiful! :)
Omg yes! Share that First Aid Kit love <3
Dear Hannah,\nI want to thank you for a lot of things but I think I'll tell you a story first, so here goes nothing: \nIt was 11:45 or something and we were sitting on the tables because it was breakfast break (we have that at my school). Everyone is really exited because Anderson asked Eva if she wanted to go to dance lessons for the 9th grade dance (we have that at our school too). There is a certain pressure in the room because              everyone is expecting other boys to ask other girls... who do I want to dance with me? I ask myself...without hesitating I already know: Andrew, with the ginger hair who sits behind me. Without thinking twice about it I ask him: are you going to dance lessons? No, I don't have anyone to go with and he turns around, almost in shame, because he can't  pluck up the courage to ask\nanyone. Do you want to dance with me? I ask and I see his face light up...I still don't know if in embarrassment or happiness. Yeah, I'd love to he says. Why? Don't you have a boyfriend? Because I like you...I  a friend way and he's not my boyfriend, he's my best friend plus he's too old for the dance, he'd have to be 4 years younger \n\nLater that day alot of my friends had been asked out to dance, but none of them had asked any boy. Who are you dancing with? They asked me. Andrew. oh, did he ask you? \nNo, I asked him *silence* \nThey didn't seem to get the idea that it was totally fine to ask a boy out! (Not even out, to dance lessons!!)\n\nBut sure enough the girls that weren't asked, asked the boys themselves the next day.\nHooray for empowering women! \n\nI'm telling you this because I think women like you Hannah, gave me the confidence to do my little act of rebellion against societies ideas. \n\nI probably git some stuff wrong and part of its cheesy but I hope I got out what I could. Thankyou Hannah:)
I went to see wicked the same night :) it was my second time and I'm still awed by it. I wish I could live somewhere nearer to London to be able to see more Musicals!
My boyfriend and I are watching House of Cards and we’ve just gotten into season 2 as well! Also, you’ve made me want to finally read The Virgin Suicides.
haha I think those intros are so cute :P
why is it in a higher frame rate this time? It looks odd to me
I love your hair in this video! Cutie.
I once actually had to explain to a guy that the way men pursue women in movies is generally not a good idea in real life.  He thought that was actually how it's done.
Hey!\n\nI've just recently discovered your channel and i love it!\nthe  jewellery.... omg.. i want it. I hope i can find something similar here (i'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).. i looove galaxy and space stuff.\n\nI really love wicked! wish i could have seen it many times as well.\n\nYou could have an amazing intro that is like you.. but you do not need it! seriously!
Adore Wicked - I've seen it twice in London and I'm really tempted to see it again when the tour visits next year.  Will def be checking out Holly's new book!
That's me too! I feel like i need to get the souvenir programme everytime i watch a musical.... and then i don't actually know what to do with it....
You're videos seem to begin after the beginning. Like YouTube delays your video just a bit, but I can't tell how much\n Stop it or stop them. I want to see all of you and I mean that in every good way.
Where is the jumper you're wearing from? I love it!
The Big Sick made me cry too. Kumail Nanjiani who wrote it with his wife and stars in it is really talented and funny. You should follow him on twitter.
Are you planning on seeing It? Or maybe you're not into the horror genre? I think it has a very beautiful cinematography and it was a very good movie, that's why I'm curious :)
oh my gooood I saw the big sick on it's release day it's one of my fav films it's so so so so good, glad you liked it too!!!
Yesss, first aid kit! The new single is amazing.
I love watching these vids because some of these things I’ve heard of and some I haven’t, if I haven’t, then they become my favourites. Lol, plus I just love hannah❤️🙏🏼
i NEED to see Wicked again! i saw it a couple of years back and it was honestly incredible, so much better than i expected! love your vids Hannah!
So jelly! I've seen Wicked twice and it was my first theatre show that I saw live. I sat in the front row the first time and cried because of how excited I was. Needless to say, I love it. I would have loved to celebrate the 11th :)
I love Wicked so very much 💚
Was nice seeing you at Buffer Fest! :D
I think I will have ti buy Holly's book
You haven't seen IT
I know this is a weird video to comment on this but the quality of this vid is awesome! Like super HD
My friend read The Manifesto On How To Be Interesting by Holly, and then wrote a blog pretty much copying it? And I got so annoyed, like, I was all 'She's Hannah's friend you can't plagiarise her!'😂
Did you get a new camera? I can't really explain it, but you look more...real?
That Alice Underground theatre show sounds incredible! So sad I didn’t get a chance to take part!!
About a month ago I read the Manifesto on How to Be Interesting and loved it! It left me feeling personally affected. I didn't realise you knew Holly Bourne :) I'm happy now to have something to relate to!
how come there's no motion blur in this video? my eyes feel warped
Is it just me or does the video look slightly sped up?
I was wondering why this video seemed hyperreal.  And it was in 1080p50.  That explains everything.
OMG House of Cards AND First Aid Kit being mentioned in the same video 😍😍😍 First Aid Kit are amazingggg live
I've been enjoying starting university. So far it's just been a blur of lectures, training, eating and sleeping
The Virgin Suicides is SUCH a great book. I read it in one sitting while sitting on a bench in  park, and it was the most beautiful day.
Pls don’t rip the page out of the programme, it makes me a little uncomfortable thinking about it 😩
Tickets booked! A great 19th Birthday present to myself - I can't wait :D
i haven't watched the last season of house of cards just yet but holy fuck is that A Show™
Get one like the Drunk Advice intro!
I LOVE The Big Sick. One of the best pieces of film I've seen in awhile.
FIRST AID KIT ♥︎
Good 🎥 film
Love this narcissist 💋💋🌷
Dannah
First Aid Kit, ahhhh ❤❤
Omg I loooove Holly Bourne
Show off TV
Your amazing hannah! Great vids
I LOVE WICKED
Is the jumper Dodie yellow tho?
BYOI  it's audience participation Improv group,  renaissance  fairs,
You are gorgeous Hannah. :)
Hi
I. LOVE. WICKED.
Omg yes love First Aid Kit!
Robin wright is my BAE!
What time-ish will the event with Holly finish? Just wondering so I can book my train!
The idea of someone ripping out pages of a theatre Programme pains me. Lol
I love your rainbow book stacks
I'm seeing First Aid Kit next week for the first time! I'm so excited!
I'm a gardener, we call it the change. Thank you your up beat and happy perspective.
I'm I the only one distressed by the disorganised bookshelf???  :P
Holly was literally in my school today
Literally just found your account I’m 16 and wondering where I’ve been under what rock to not find you you’re amazing omg ❤️
HOW MANY HOURS DO YOU HAVE PER DAY TO READ AND WATCH ALL OF IT AND LIVE
Omg my friend played Alice in that play! What a small world 🙊
Genuinely interested- if I now comment that The Big Sick is not a Judd Apatow movie, but was directed by  Michael Showalter and writen by Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani (a.k.a. the leading actor and his wife), would that be considered a rude comment? I really want to know, because I am a big Kumail fan and am totally excited for the movie, and was just kind of sad to hear Hannah's mistake.
Aaah I had no idea Holly Bourne was releasing another book, I need to get it asap!
Hopefully you'll do more twitch stuff in the future! Been loving that when you were on :D\n\nAlso this video is great! Love getting recommendations for things from your monthly fav's videos!
9:40 is it dodie yellow tho?

I love you so much 🌹
Fucking love YOUUU come back to USA and we can be BFFS!!!!

lmao FINALLY someone actually said the natasha denona palettes are shit for the price!! If they were cheaper i wouldn’t care but hun, when i need to sell my organs on the black market to afford a palette it better be the most beautiful shit i’ve ever seen in my life lol cya
Michael can you please do a review of different setting sprays! I have oily skin and an make up setting sprays make it worse. Can you suggest any? Thanks hun x
I love your videos Michael but you didn’t disclose in this video that it was sponsored, only right at the bottom of the description. On FTCs website it clearly states that only disclosing in the description that a video is sponsored isn’t enough as it can clearly be missed. No hate as I love you but as a loyal follower I’d prefer it be clearly stated whether or not a video is sponsored ❤️
i feel like a lot of your catch phrases havent been said as regularly and it makes me that sad q not a problem bin
Thank u for not been afraid to say what products are shit.stay honest,much respect and love from UK xx
Pls do more of these hot and misses videos love u xxxxx
Your losing so much weight you should be so proud of yourself Ox

I LOVE THIS DO MORE!!!!!!!
That mask burned the shit out of my skin and left me looking sun burnt the rest of the day :(((
Loving this and loving you 👏🏽🌱💛✨
I noticed how YouTuber beauty gurus are super careful about what they say about tarte products because tarte is quick to snatch people off their PR list these days even if it's constructive criticism
I miss your old hair!
I love watching your vids, they put me in a good mood😻
Thanks Michael for your honesty, I truly appreciate it. It saves me going out and buying a crappy product!
You’re makeup today is ridiculous 😍
You are looking amazing!
Giving me Katy Perry but 100x better!!!
He looks like Ursula from the little mermaid
Almost died laughing a the review of the Natasha palette ..... A lot of persons seem to be like they are walking on eggshells when doing a hit or miss....best of all time
You look fabulous! I love your honest opinions!!
The fact that you admit you got a product in PR & STILL state your honest opinion .. respect 🙌🏻 love you !

I love it when you do favourites videos I always value your opinions on beauty products 💖💖 love ya

That Mecca primer is an EXACT dupe for the Becca backlight primer... I compared the two today and the Mecca one had just a teeeensy bit more pink pigment to it. But they pretty much look, perform, smell the same except one costs nearly $80 and the other costs $20. Ps they both have 30mls of product
That makeup look with that hair.. yas mama!👏
You legit look like Pink the singer with that hair I can't deal
That little “HMM” after the pro glow concealer 😂😂😂
Could you do a full face first impressions on sports girl makeup. I really like watching your first impressions love you ❤️❤️

I like TWICE for the worlds most❤️
10,610,171 views Keep streaming Once's and thanks you from other fandom that\nstream with us! We Once appreciate those that respect our TWICE!!!\nLet's all have a good time here and enjoyed TWICE song!!!\nhaters! Don't used other or your Idol for your personal gain!!!\nIf you don't like our girl's at least love yours,Once Fighting!!!\nOnce's let's bring TWICE that 11 Million Today,Enjoy!!!
OK I had posted this on Twice Japan Official twitter post yesterday as well, ONCEs we set our priorities straight now. We keep streaming OMT and at a the same time focus on LOA reach 200M in another 10 days. Done?
㊗1000万回再生！！
wow 10million views
1000万viewおめ✨🎉🎊
0:40 the rhythm guitar sneaking in... its just so clever and adds a lot to rhythmic texture. whoever the player is he is having his time there. this song has very heavy bass perfectly contradicting their light vocals at fast bit rate which gives this funky disco track modern feels.
the pose that Nayeon start to play the tennis with Jihyo at 2:34 are so weird 😂
NAYEON FUCKING JUMPED OUT OF HER SHOES TO BEAT JIHYO'S ASS 2:35 I LOVE THIS EXTRA BITCH 😂
While taking your test an then all of the sudden one more time pops on your head
I think we can make it to 20 mill. before our girls anniversary right? And don't forget to stream LOA ONCES we need less than 5 mill.

twice fans cant't accept how untalented their idols......twice is the worst group and once is the worst fandom.......Once act like they are too good but they are not Once reported the video of bts and so as snsd.......why are you threatened ??? I dont even like snsd but when it will compare to you i will choose snsd why...Atleast snsd leader is a great vocalist unlike your idols......Dont compare your idols to a legend..........\nGFriend,lovelyz,red velvet and blackpink is much better than twice.......blackpink can blow your idols in no time..........
Everyone i know you all are twice lovers but at the same time nu'est has jus release their comeback song WHERE ARE YOU AT.PLEASE SUPPORT THEM.RAISE THEIR VIEWS AND RANKING🙏
A blink asked a delusional question *why does TWICE copy blackpink?*  so I gave a delusional answer...   *because TWICE wants to be the worst selling group their label has ever debuted, so of course they are going to copy blackpink. DUH! silly*
basic plagiarism

He’s just shocked
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Your brother WAS so intelligent he shot 500+ people UNDER 10 minutes... i can't even do that in black ops
Give this guy an oscar
I personally think this guy's on drugs. Cocaine perhaps. That would explain a lot
Wtf did I just watched?? Who cares about Stephen's gambling and sushi?? 🙄
See how you chat with20 cameras at your face and the world watching right after your brother just shot and killed over 50 people and has gone down as one of the biggest mass shooter in US history.  You'd be a little weird too.  However he is very wacky!  I mean he is highly recommending a place to eat etc
Bro this niqqa is funny asf😂😂 he makes no sense at all
This guy genuinely sounds like he didn't expect this to happen. He's distraught sounding. I've read on some sites that Steve was an undercover FBI agent involved in gun selling or something but this guy doesn't seem to involved
This is so sad. What that man did was pure evil. I don't have words to say how sorry I am for the victims. But we shouldn't forget that this man lost a brother. He has every right to feel his emotions, just like the victims and their families have the right to feel their's. His brother was a murderer. Do you think that he asked for this? Do you think that, when he found out his brother was a murderer, that he just said oh well, he's a murderer so I guess I'll just forget him! That's not how love works. He loved his brother. He is feeling pain, as well.\n\nNEVER tell anyone that they are not allowed to feel their emotions. You have no right. I always think about Dyland Kelbold's mother (one of the columbine shooters). If you haven't listened to her Ted Talk you should. She talks about how people tell her she doesn't have the right to feel sad. Why? How? Her son is dead, too. He's just as dead as the people he murdered. His mother was blindsided by his actions. She felt guilt for a long time. For what? It wasn't her fault. But people told her it was. SHE felt it was, because she didn't notice anything wrong. Put yourself in these people's shoes. Have some empathy. They didn't ask for it.
It would be hard to believe that your sibling was capable of such a heinous event.  It would be shocking, I must admit. Especially when so out of character, and unfathomable.   The family are victims too.
Investigate this guy immediately... and his street pharmacist.
I just can't. Its like an adult caillou.
CLEARLY HE IS SHOCK. THIS WHOLE FAMILY NEEDS PRAY WITH THE VICTIMS. HAVE MERCY.
More concerned about himself, his brother and his family than 560! victims. Pathetic
This dude needs help not an interview
7:27 a little nose goblin came out to play but was quickly snorted back up 😂
I have a feeling Stephen Paddock was murdered in his room by the actual gunmen. Call it a gut feeling; an intuition....
Eric Paddock has diarrhea of the mouth and would do better if he said less. He makes one unsympathetic of his plight as a brother when he rambles on about how high living they all were. Dean Myerow, Fort Lauderdale FL
Sandy Hook all over again?
Fake news amazing acting here wonder who’s paying for all of this.
This guy needs a hug
He needs to lawyer up, dude said too much. Losing his mind
At first I thought he was real but after 20 minutes of watching I believe he's an actor. He is directing the narrative that he was a lone shooter too much.
The day or hours after  the shooting he said that he was not that close with his brother... now he has all these stories about that same brother he was not close with??? Again... this guy is not making any sense...
Something phony here..rambling..crisis actor! Sad times we live in ..
This guy is off. He's so dramatic it's coming off fake.
He looks like the guy who played Woogie in the movie Something about Mary. lol
On one hand, he's weird and seems unstable. But on the other, if he acted completely normal that would be weird as well. I don't think there's any right way to respond to a situation like this. He's one of maybe like 20 people that have ever been the sibling of a mass shooter. Of course the victims and their families have most of my sorrow, I still feel a little bad for this guy.
Ok, let's see the video of the hotel porter pushing a gold trolley loaded with 20 plus weapons and thousands of rounds, if as he says his brother didn't carry anything up to the room himself, and paid this guy 100 bucks to do it for him. Presumably there must be footage from multiple angles of multiple trips between the ground and 33rd floors, as no way could it be achieved in just one.
we're calling your brother crazy, not because he gambled, but because he shot at a crowd of twenty two thousand living human beings.
this guy sounds like a loser
Aw c'mon Mary! Steve isn't that weird. He just shoots people every now and then.
Will say some of the stories out do seem to make Stephen look like a generous person..which makes the whole situation that more weird.
Being pragmatic guys.... come on. \n\nGuys come on.\n\n\nHe didn't plan on this for 35 years???! Who even brought that up?!?!\n\n\n\nWhat came out his nose twice? Ever seen valklyrie? \n\n\nEct ect ect. Dat dat dat dat dah
This video is ridiculously pointless, his brother sounds like he's extremely money hungry...its so many points he can talk about ....but he's just going on and on about money ...
I hope this guy does not lose it
If there’s anything you can do? How about give the victims all of Steve’s money?
I hope Stevie's money helps the 20 year olds have a early retirement then,it's only fair.
Why is he so open ? And be so sure ?
This guy  is making sooo much sense... Everyone has a family member like this dude... Why is it anyone else's fault because of what Steve did??
Going through the stages of grief can make someone look crazy.
This guy would make a great comedian, he's funny, in a morbid way.
This guy might be a shooter soon, I can only watch 2 minutes of this video, this guy is creepy af !!
This guys brother just died. Why is he talking to the media.  if it was my brother, I'd tell the media to F off and leave me alone.
hey always saying Steve he doesn't say brother. this guys knows a lot.
He dont like guns but knows alot about how it feels...spec..auto n semi autos...yall listening ?? He is SHOOTER #2 !!!!!
I.feel for the victims and if my family member would have been mudered by his brother i wouldn't want to hear his mouth he needs to.shut up
I wanted to believe this guy but first he's saying how completely far removed from Steve's life the weapons were and then basically  blows that whole story to smithereens while talking about the rifles beating you up when you shoot them and saying that Steve didn't like those bump stocks as if this was a known thing that a guy who knows nothing shouldn't know...
Can someone tell me wtf, this is saying? He doesn't know how to make a point
Leave the man alone!!!!!!!!
This guy is channelling 90s era Chris Elliot from SNL.  Looks just like him from Schitt's Creek
Bad day for a concert....
Sad that it came to this
i’ll keep an eye on him too ..both of there bros seem alittle off or just too much coffee.
Yeah, the high stakes gambling is why we think your brother's crazy.
All I hear is wealthy rich rich rich who care about that many people lost thier life money can't buy the life of these family member lost this is so tragic.
what a great actor
Highly inappropriate that the news got this footage then posted it. This guy needs help.
TALK TO THE GOVERNMENTS, AND YOUR GREAT FALSE GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS THAT FOOLED ALL OF US . WAKE UP WAKE UP , WAKE UP
This all just seems very odd to me. Why does he seem like he is an actor? Why does he act like he is mental himself? Why would he talk about his own brother this way? This mans mind seems scrambled himself. This just keeps getting more odd by the dam day! Non of this makes any kind is sense to me and a lot of people. He jumps from one thing to another thing. Is he an actor? This man is just very strange and odd.
You're an ordinary guy, except your brother is responsible for the death of over 50 people and the injuries of over 500 people.
THIS COMMENT HAS BEEN REMOVED BY THE U.S GOVERNMENT.
WE'RE SO RICH WE DONT WORK AT TACO BELL LIKE YOU STUPID POOR GOYIM WE'RE SO RICH
You want to give back ?Why don’t you take your wealth ,or whatever of your brothers wealth,  ( since seems like he’s the reason why you even have financial freedom from how you speak) and donate to the funeral of the victims . There is a way you can give back ! Genius idea!
Official narrative is claiming suspect wore gloves a lot - all the photos I image searched for him, no gloves.
How many phones are gonna go off geez
Gunman's brother is a little quirky, too......
Get this guy before he does something
I loved him in There's Something About Mary
This is what I call “diarrhea of the mouth!”
Pay for their funerals since ur so wealthy
I like this guy
This interview is solid gold for reviewing his body language, high and lows of voice, the intellectual pauses and reiterations, talking down to common people and his vocabulary. (This lil squirming weasel is a good liar too.)
He loos like hes about to beat his brothers record
That's vodka in that mug
Just wish we knew why he did this. For other's to know the signs, and could help prevent this again!
you ever have a white head on your eye ball!!
It was a false flag staged attack
Your brother just killed 58 people and injured over 500 more and all you care about is the money. Dont portray your monster as a saint.
All this man can talk about is how rich Steve was. Disgusting.
Eloquent for a US citizen,\nbut at 32.04, the madness starts. Admits he owns semi automatic and teaches his kids to use it.\nThats the spark of madness. Even if if it's self contained in the US goldfish shooting ball.
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF SUSHI... COMPED!!
This makes me uncomfortable
He seems bipolar
Crisis actor lmfaooo
Garbage
Coo coo for cocoa puffs.
Great Actor.
Freak
Guess who wants into marylou’s knickers lol
Fake news.
This is cringe worthy
He tries to convince us that there was no big deal that his brother smuggled the guns up there, ''nothing to see here'' 16:00 \nI say he is an actor
Steve's knees & legs hurt from shooting an auto weapon so u did know about what he had been doing & u did confirm & know he was shooting auto weapons & Eric also shot auto weapons clearly by describing shooting one & he says I don't own a gun oh no well yes I do a 22! Lolol hello fbi r u even trying to investigate these ppl because this man is a lying sack of sh** & has so many red flags
This guy seems a lil unstable
The shooter lived 10 minutes from my house for 2 years. His brother still lives 40 minutes from me. Stop saying he's a crisis actor. This is very real. He's probably losing his mind. What would go through your mind if your brother did something like this? He needs time and space. To even think your brother or sister would do an unimaginable thing like this is just too crazy to understand. But I'd like to know who Stephen would talk badly about.
Sociopath DNA at work
I myself are a specialist in psychology and human behavior and at 29:21 his quick response with an I DONT KNOW is a dead give away.....question this man more and I promise you'll find what you're looking for
Watch this guy, he looks fake, crazy and manipulative
black mirror is a part of CIA psych ops to make humans seem like animals and soulless. Tragedy in art is there to LEARN from the message but when the point of tragedy is hopelessness then this is the death of the soul. a story without a message is pointless and black mirror is a shit show. its a part of bad art like modern art. don't be confused. Life is about Good vs evil and if you abandon this, you abandon hope and purpose in life. If this is exciting to you then I feel sorry for you because you are a zombie
to underaged kids ? I'm pretty sure it was just normal porn
Black Mirror is the 21st century's Twilight Zone, but w/out the innocence of its conceit.
I'm generally on board with your analysis, but I think you've misstepped here - or, perhaps, haven't stepped far enough.  The lack of catharsis might be why we watch this show, and films  like it, but without the catharsis, and certainly without the 'moral,' this kind of literature is corrosive to both the individual human and the society as a whole. You've made the point before, but I'll repeat it here, stories make us who we are, and world-building can be a dangerous activity.  A world built with violence and no catharsis, no moral, is a world that creates people who are at best apathetic and insensitive, and at worst, violent themselves - and those are not mutually exclusive positions. Perhaps we are drawn to it for exactly the reasons you've indicated, but the question becomes should we be?  Even if we are drawn  because we are already headed in this direction, wouldn't it be better to turn away from this kind of literature.  It's us in a mirror darkly, I get it.  But, the point of that allusion - and especially the Bible verse it's drawn from - isn't to dive into the darkness, but to know where our limitations are and move forward in love.  Keep up the great work!
You seem really enlightened. I wonder why you still eat animals?
what typeface do you use?! it's beautiful!
All this silly talk about spoilers. One of the greatest shows ever made was built on spoilers- and that show is Columbo. It innovated the idea of showing the murder so the audience could then enjoy, not solving the murder themselves, but watching how a great character did it. And that was first made in the early 70s. Black Mirror forces us to think about ourselves, much like columbo, could we behave in the same way if put into such a situation. Charlie Brooker produces original work unlike a lot of the crap that is produced today. Charlie Brooker is the modern Columbo.
The White Christmas episode still haunts me.
The show is also about survival. What do people find themselves willing to do to survive?  But often the characters don't even know if their choices will help them survive.  And survive has a different meaning for each story. It's not necessarily a life or death situation, but more of a mental situation.
what music is he using from 4:56 ??
I couldn't stick with it after the first episode. I found it overly long with a lot of filler.
Stupid and boring show...waste of time.
What's the name of the song in the very beginning of the video?
I dont watch it because it makes me feel like shit.
Reading the comments under many clips of the show it's clear that a lot of viewers don't even get Black Mirror and basically are the same kind of bloodthirsty Medieval mob justice people with technology and dystopian scenarios the show warns us about. The theme park for punished criminals *with absolutely no recollection of their bad actions and completely innocent from their own present point of view* was just scary. The process is also repeated daily for who knows how long. For public entertainment! Yet some commenters think it's a good punishment and seem to believe the show defends or glorifies these brutal methods.
What the fuck Blue apron, 2 kilograms of plastic with every meal? I like the channel but I dislike the sponsor…
haha he is not a father
Do one on persons of interest and zootopia. Please.
It's not really to do with the execution of tragedy and catharsis.  It's popular because it doesn't make the point obvious.  You're inclined to watch it from the start because you want to figure out what weird thing is happening.  The endings are often twists.  The structure lends itself to catharsis but many stories do.  It departs from the typical story arch though, you're rewarded with satisfaction in knowledge rather than satisfaction in resolution.  If you've any interest in marketing things to gen-Xers and Millenials you'll understand why that's important.
To me, Twilight Zone did what Black Mirror does, without the need to think about futuristic technology. \nThe world was grounded for it's time, and even when there would be a morality to the story, it never made you feel content and have resolution. \nIf anything, it made you feel like you were just as capable of doing the messed up stuff people do in that episode.
A love Eminem so much.. but please could talk about why actors like Jim Carrey, will smith still lost to find only one Oscar.
Talk about Mother! please
okay i will watch it\ni will\ni promise
Have you put on weight?
My only note is that at 2:07 you say the public does not enjoy/seek out tragedy in real life. I need only point out how the 24 hour news cycle that has made this very thing a form of entertainment as opposed to informational like news was originally intended. Love the channel. Keep it up.
As for me it's also addictive not cause of this tragedy things ,but much more cause it shows people and society their problems in pretty aggressive and dirty way.\nLike...FACE IT,you're piece of ...poop.\nAnd it's all built on this small pieces.
At 0:56 it says that Fifteen Million Merits is season 3, episode 6... it's actually season 1, episode 2
Please do an video about the movie mother 😭😭😭😩😩😩😩
Enjoyed this video. Interesting layout of how you analysed Black Mirror with mentions of GOT.
I love your videos so much! I even watch the ones about topics that usually don't interest me. This week's topic is definitely an interesting one, though.\nI've seen the first but I've never watched the second episode of Black Mirror, probably for the same reason I'm never going to rewatch Idiocracy. I feel that both, BMs first episode and the idea behind Idiocracy are brilliant, but I've always said I feel they hit to close to home. I've despised the people tuning in on the Prime Minister's misery in the first episode of BM, while realising that, by watching the show, I was one of them. The uneasy feeling of voyeurism while being helpless to do something to relief the PM's pain is unbearable. Idiocracy on the other simply didn't make me laugh. Not because it wasn't hilarious but because it was too close to our modern day reality. When a certain president was elected last year I couldn't stop thinking about how shockingly close we are to what was meant to be a socio-political satire.
Black mirror causes empathy toward those who we would at first argue don't deserve it\n or takes away are empathy towards those who we thought deserved it\n\nSomeone who has watched the episode will find themselves often arguing with people who have only heard the premise
I'm such a massive fan of black mirror. I would to hear your commentary on each episode.
Nice video, wow I didn't know blue Apron has soooo much plastic packaging, that's horrible.
Best show ever Black Mirror
It was so much better when it was directed at a British audience.
can you please do a video on Revisionist History by Malcolm Gladwell
With the one bright spot being my sweet perfect 80's Lesbians
I need to watch things die - from a good safe distance \nVicariously I live while the whole world dies
I'd argue that we do enjoy tragedy in real life, not always, but often.
Bulllfighting is the culmination of this - death is an actor - death visits the stage.
I like it mostly for its thought provoking , high technological future subject.\n , the idea of a virtual heaven? To live withA homunculus with your loved ones dead memories and personality just for your sake?( this one was the most for me cuz its relatable) , man , there's nothing to not love about this series.
The first episode was the only episode that really got me. You think it starts out as a joke but in the end you feel really really bad jus tlike the citizens in the show.
Can someone who likes the show help me out with a question?\nI haven't seen the show. But looking at this video, I can see that, obviously, it invokes a lot of heavy emotions, it looks beautiful, it seems very original,... but. It also seems a lot like torture-porn? \n\nLike, look how miserable we can make those people, and how they don't deserve it, and how they can't get out and it's depressing and disgusting. Watch how we can take all kinds of people and put them through all kinds of crap. Enjoy how they get emotionally broken! Be amazed at how _original_ the torture is, too! \nObviously that will make me feel heavy emotions. It still feels like a sort of Hunger Games. Torture porn on the next level; not with (or solely with) physical torture, but with elaborate psychological schemes/happenings. Saw in pretty, for the intellectual!\n\nAgain I want to point out that I haven't seen BM. I'm _not_ judging it. This is just the impression I've got from this video, but considering some of the people who love it I think that this can't be quite true. (The show's probably really good even.) So, anybody like the show and want to 'defend' and explain it a little to me, please? :D
Because Charlie Brooker is a fucking genius that's why.
So much talk so little said. Unsubbed
fuck your sponsors go to a supermarket
Once again, SO GOOD
at 0:55 the caption says fifteen million merits, Season 3 Episode 6 but it is actually Season 1 Episode 2
Please do a video on A Ghost Story
Can anyone tell me which season the GOT spoilers are? I’m on 5.5
Here is the thing. \nI had never heard of Black Mirror until you posted this video. I clicked Watch Later and started watching them on Netflix. I just finished the last episode. \n1. I didnt want any spoilers \n2. Well there isnt a 2 other than to say there isnt a two\nI sure am glad i didnt watch this until after I was done!  Which ive seen every single one of your videos so I knew enough not to watch unit i was ready. \nGreat video btw. As always. \nAny more great shows i havent heard of you want to tell me about????  I am now kinda sad that i binged watched the fucking awesomeness that was BLACK MIRROR? I NEED MORE!!!!
0:56 Fifteen Million Merits is the second episode of the first series.
What is the name of the song that comes on at 6:55???? It is the same song from the episode.. A Million Merits.. the theme... pleaseeeeeeee help.
I couldn't get past the first episode, not my cup of tea
I thought the sponsored bit at the the end of the video was a lead up to something really dark and messy. It wasn't. And thereby totally ruining the actual message of the whole video.
Black Mirror is disgusting. A show entirely based on covering the deepest depravity of humanity. Shows like this should not exist.
I don't get why Black Mirror is so revered. I don't think it's clever. You know how each episode is going to end. Badly. You know your going to watch character A go through situation X, and the opposite of desrired outcome Z is going to happen and in the rare cases where Z does occur it never justifies X. There. Black Mirror explained in a word formula.
I love your videos man! Great work as well. Only this time I don't understand why you mention that Black Mirror doesn't evolve around the concept of Catharsis? I think it is fundamentally based on that concept as almost every hero of every episode is, in the end, subdued to the process of facing the consequences of it's own actions. With a tragic end in most cases as they couldn't avoid their fate, that they themselves created. Would love to understand more what you mean. Thanks!
well thanks. i will safely skip this show if i happen to stumble upon it. the idea of convening meaningless tragedies is not new. always wonder whether it's a good thing or not. never been my thing...\ni thought game of thrones was about families fighting? may have to skip it too
That's why I don't like the highly praised San Junipero, as much as it is a beautiful a story, it's the least Black mirrorish episode of the whole show.
Hey Nerdwriter, can I subtitle some of your videos into Turkish and post them ? credits to you of course
Oh, shut the fuck up.
Fuck. Being spoiled by this video is a Black Mirror episode itself. P.S. Blue Apron would be å great title for this.
PhillyD brought me here. GREAT VIDEO!! But where was the BB spoiler?
Black Mirror’s episodes don’t remind of tragedies like Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, or Antigone, but it very much reminds me of 1984. Those first three plays end with a closure and you feel the characters like Macbeth, the Capulets and Montagues, and Oedipus got what they deserved in some way. But in 1984 and Black Mirror there is no satisfaction and no one really gets what they deserve.
I'll get the family deal for one person
It deals with a lot of cruel and unusual punishment. Having one’s memory wipes every day and tortured for people’s entertainment? Indefinitely?? Forced to literally spend a million years in complete isolation with nothing? That was especially fucked up considering that he was a good guy and only did what he did because of impulsive, angry behavior. Also, what good does it do to punish someone’s copy for millennia when the organic version’s still locked up? What are they going to do to the original? Such technology could be used for so much good yet here it is used for ruthless torture and the enslavement of sentient intelligences. That’s why this is so dark.
can you next time speak on gameof thrones spoilers smh? please use a warning... not cool
I... Didn't... Know... That.... The dude from braking bad died.... Fucksakes
To me it seems that Black Mirror is all flash with no substance. The writers are very good at coming up with imaginative scenarios around technology and it's possibilities, but they all boil down to the same overused trope. It's lacking in the nuances and details that make a really exceptional show. I really think the draw of the show is less that it's genius, and more that it is avante garde. \n\nBasically, the draw of black mirror is the same as under age drinking. It's only fun because it feels rebellious.
I love your videos!
The episode with Domhnall Gleeson ended happily. She was able to put her feelings for him away like a box of keepsakes. She still loved him, her child as well, but they knew that the 'man' in the attic was an approximation.
Pleasure is not the only human motive
REVIEW BLADERUNNER 2049 PLEASE I LOVE YOU ABSOLUTELY
At 0:56, Fifteen Million Merits is credited as being the sixth episode in the third series; it's the second episode of the first series.\n\nI think it's telling that there were few, if any, clips from The Waldo Moment used.  To me that's the only bad episode of the series to date.
unrelated, but please do a video on BLADE RUNNER 2049... I just watched the movie and would love to hear your opinion on it.
Blue Apron is fucking bullshit. Just buy your groceries it's so much cheaper.
How can bb and got still be spoiled at this point.
I dont say thank you because, because of you a what all the black mirror, with, at the end, a bad taste... but it work
Black Mirror is not a tragedy, unless not getting what you want is tragic. It is about the darkest implications of technology, the limitations of using technology as a substitute for reality. Comparing it to Game of Thrones is just odd. Black Mirror is not about tragedy so much as it's about trying to overcome loss and the limitations, shortcomings and consequences. A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.
It wasn't to underage kids, that what the other guy did and Kenny was too shocked to disagree and clear it up before they fought to the death
Is this like Outer Limits?
Maybe now that you can cook you could stop using Blue Apron b/c that company creates so much waste.
Could you do one like this on Bojack Horseman?
FUCK YES, I love this show. Thank you for this.
Fantastic analysis!
1:21 That spelling mistake, though...
Ever Heard of spoiler alerts ?
SEASON 4 PLEASE CMON
shit you're good

Best show ever
thanks for spoiling Game of Thrones\n\n\n\nbitch

Thanks  to
ARCHIE IS BRITISH OR AUSTRALIAN. Either way I am s h o o k e t h to the core. Ths is like when I found out that girl from 13 reasons why was Australian
Green is not a creative color
i love how after kj sat down on the couch between lili and ashleigh his hand was kinda holding on to lili’s arm. it could of been nothing but it looked so sweet and cute
I know KJ is like New Zealander but like I've never heard him speak before so like... never expected him to be so.... Kiwi hahahahaha idek
I thought this said Truth or Dance and I'm disappointed
I love Betty and archie but I like V single better:(((((((( why Riverdale Betty loved him for so long
To people who say bughead/Cole/Juggie is overrate, well, they are the reason i watch the show in the first place....
This isn't complete without Cole. BUGHEAD LIVES
dead ass typed this with my elbow
I’m writing this with my elbows
I WAS HERE FOR COLE BUT NOOOO
Awww too bad cole isn't there that'd be fantastic
At 3:25 when they talk about KJ not going on dates. Either Casey or KJ muttered Cami when Casey said I’ve seen it. It’s confirmed they’re a thing.😭
I love how Madelaine and Cami were singing all through the night while lili and kj were dancing because I freaking love that song and I flipped when it was in Riverdales first episode😂
Are we gonna ignore the fact Lili was high key flirting with KJ like what about bughead honey
Truth or dare????? (Typing with your elbows isn't actually that hard)
I felt bad for Cami, she got ignored and they forgot about her with the last dare
the atmosphere reminds me of F.R.I.E.N.D.S
i typed this eitn \nmy ennkw —
camila cabello vs camila mendes this is painful omg, they are the same person
Typing with my elbow \n\nI actually did it lol\nIt took about 5 minutes tho
Where the heck is JUGHEAD 😭
WHY IS EVERYONE IGNORING THE FACT THAT COLE ISNT EVEN IN HERE?!
They RUINED the show by making this show sexual other then that the actors are dope but come on really??
Something is off with the Chemistry. Team ignores Cami and reactions change when Ashleigh speaks
did anyone else notice that when kj is on the couch he has his arms around lili and ashleigh but is touching lili and not touching ashleigh? lol i ship the whole cast w/everyone lemme be honest 😂
Why do kiwis sound australian next to americans hah NZ fan wya
Weird Cole was there for the photoshoot didn't anyone else see the posts on Instagram the cast posted of them wearing the same clothes and background?
WHERE THE FUCK IS COLE
looks like all my fav comicstars from childhood got exploited or something
I bet the cast of riverdale would be the best friends like ever
I was laughing so hard, they're so funny. I wish I was friends with all of them :(
She was not singing
Camilla has the best style
Favorite child hood show.........WHY did none of them say Archives Weird Miseries?!?!?!
But can we talk about Lili’s pants😂
It took me till 3:48 to realize K.J had an accent.... wow.
typed this with my elbow
My God he has an accent I did not know that
Who else tried using their elbow to navigate through YouTube after cam did?
Madelaine: omigod rocket power, ROCKET POWER!!!\n\nShe sounded so aggressive it was hilarious 😂

I love how embarrassed kj gets it's adorable
4:18 KJ is having a flashback crisis

Who else thinks Camila likes Kj?😏
......WAIT\n\n\n\n\nWhere’s cole?
Wheres Cole????? :/
Everyone ignores Camila tho. #RealLife
For me, you two are the best comedy duo I've ever known. With content like this, there's no way you don't blow up eventually.
Posting a day late? Forgiven
seriously where are all your subscribers guys? like every video is gold!
This has become one of my favorite channels in a short amount of time
They could've used a wormhole monocle.
You guys are like american Jack and Dean
I laugh out loud at ALL your sketches keep up the good work :)
YES POSTING AGAIN! THIS MADE MY WHOLE MONTH
i legitimately had no idea jack played sokka in avatar the last airbender
What if there's a bunch of channels out there with this level of effort but they don't blow up because of lack of marketing... Maybe? I'm just trying to rationalize why you don't have a million subs.
I really love your stuff, guys! By the way: I forgive you, too.
HOW DO YOU PEOPLE NOT HAVE 10,000,000 SUBS?!?!
please like this video for win the competition https://youtu.be/VOfkATP7Z8M
zzzzzzzzz last video i saw was abduction these guys arnt showing up in my mfkin sub  box. putting bell on
Wait. That's David's lair in Alien Covenant.
consistently well-scripted, well-executed, well-edited, well-produced; the youtube algorithm messed up big time
Sorry, I just didn't really think this was funny.
wow this was funny im mad that this should have more views i will share it tho
I have no friends.
One of the best channels on Youtube.
CMON MAN! YOU DONT JUST LET THAT STUFF GO
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
The best goddamn chanel on all of youtube
This video literally helped me figure out some things about me and my best friend LOL. Thanks
That was hilarious, you guys have to be the best short film creators on Youtube.
I just can't get over the fact that's Sokka. Fucking Sokka dude.
I love a good channel that puts the focus on the right factors in their sketches. Its not like WOOO WE CAN EDIT REALLY WELL and the sketches never really revolve around the editing or anything directly related to pop culture or anything. Always very obscure and interesting. Really its just the disctinction between intelligent people and unintelligent people, and you guys are obviously the former.
most underrated channel on youtube. no contest. this video even made me feel better about settling things with my best friend tomorrow. thank you guys, please keep it up.
GUYS. 👏🏼 you're killing it.
I was dying throughout the whole video! keep it up you guys!
This was so funny and so well done!
i love you guys
I think a good way for you guys to get more views is to do a more frequent side series or something.  I'd love to see more of you guys even if it's not your usual big production videos
Man you guys are a true inspiration, every single video is straight fire and so quotable. Beautiful \nI strive to make our channel as good as you guys. One day
Well wiener on the forehead IS a classic prank, just saying *shrug emoji*
Better acting then twilight as well. Hell, its easy when its true.
The production value alone on these is absolutely incredible! Paired with the chemistry you guys have and the HILARIOUS writing, I'm honestly hooked! One a month is just unfair! Keep it up guys, you're amazing ❤
Damn, you guys are good at this
This is why we bring pickaxes and tnt on expeditions
There's something really wrong about these guys not having at least a million subscribers. One awesome video after the other!
Always a great surprise ending!
You guys are so creative! KEEP IT UP!!!
You guys covered so much ground with this one.
Like we haven't ALL taken a picture with Chris' weiner.
I can't think of a funnier duo than these two, not Jake and Amir, not Jack and Dean, not even Rick and Morty.
These are always so inspirational! And funny.
SO GOOD, as always !!
Put on headphones in the middle of a lecture just to watch this. \n\nI'm in medical school.
My question is where do you get the budget?
The smallest channel i'm subscribed to but also my favorite, I love it keep it up and it will pay off!
Jesus this is amazing
Okay wow! so this is the set of Alien Covenant. Was there scenes in that location in the movie?
Ahhhhhh so excited to see you guys upload!!
Please don't encode 21:9 with black bars. Otherwise great video!
I once too put my wiener on someone's forehead.....
Who is bankrolling the productions of these videos?
How do you not get more views?! Keep up the good work!
Im so surprised that you guys don't have more subs, you are one of my favorite channels
How do you guys come up with these awesome crazy sketch ideas? xD
Shared this with my two best friends. Boy, that's going to cause some issues. Someone is getting left in the Scorpion Tunnel.
Slow and steady you’re growing, keep it up guys!
Thank you Jack and Chris for another awesome skit!
I jumped terribly at that last trap. lol poor jack jack
The month does not pass fast enough!  I want more!!! Love these guys
I knew it. But damn it was good.
I just found your channel the other day and you guys are honestly so funny! I'm definitely gonna show your stuff to my friends, you deserve a lot more views and subscribers!\nA lot of love from Germany:)
I'm not your friend, guy!
I am going to show it to all my Best Friends.
Sent this to my best friend right away! Your videos are so good and i get so excited when the new ones come out!!
Please never stop making these videos. Even if you may not have a huge amount of subscribers, eventually someone in the large productions business will notice you guys 100%
How, how have you guys not blown up yet
I love this unique humor you guys have.  I feel like this is more of a series than a youtube channel, and it should be called The Infinite Realities of Chris and Jack.\n\nI remember meeting you guys at FilmQuest a few years back and saw Movies in Space.  I thought it was the best film at the fest.  I've been following your channel ever since the first video you posted.  I'm a fan. Great job guys!
Damn, I never clicked on the thumbnail of a video so fast before in my life
This was amazing! Really proud of you guys! 😚
Damn, the production is getting better and better.\nKudos guys! You are the best (friends)!
Always top notch comedy from Chris and Jack.
>Best comedy duo on youtube\n>only 64000 subs\nWhat the fuck.
SOKKA IS THAT YOU???????
*Shadu*
SUBBED
So fucking creative
Great stuff as usual!
that fucking ending lmaooo
You guys are amazing.
Amazing as always :)
WOOOOOOOO NEW CHRIS AND JACK VID!
Amazing video
Thank you
Classic! :D
Haha yeah everyone's been there... *laughs nervously*
Classic prank!
Lmao I fucking love it.
YAYYYYYY
Classic prank!
Thanks for adding subtitles
Excellent!
wer ist alles wegen kiavier hier???
Jack sounds a lot like Sokka from Avatar!
It’s Friday.
That door is racist
Love the vlogs. As horrible as it would be, I do wish that they would take you to the labs in China where they test the products on animals instead. Hopefully everyone would wake up and see how these companies profit from the torture of these innocent, scared animals 😢💔
when the video just started and lydia casually wore red jumper and glasses and hair down and looking seriously prettyyyy...and im just here eating chips in my jammies
I love watching your videos , you are so sweet and cute . I am sure that you will hit the 1 M and I will always keep on watching your videos. You inspire me even for my daily use , chose of products and would like to be like you one day. Congrats on the 500 K and have a blast .
Am I the only one wondering how the lipstick turned out?! I was hoping you would try it on! So curious about the color!!!!!!!!!!!
Love love your outfits ❤️
Good to see Patricia.\nThat Balmain bodycon dress is hot on you. \nBalenciaga bag and shoe. Girl you are popping.\nOh and the DVF dress, the turquoise brought out your eyes.
Congratulations on 500k subscribers!! 😊😊❤️
Love Lydia 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄 !!! please follow my DEPOP @kaddensecondhand
Wow, this is such a great opportunity, so glad that you have had a chance to create your own lipstick! Good job! :)
You look like sarah jessica parker in the thumbnail
Take me with you Lydia next time💋💕

You look stunning wit your make up and hair like that!!!!! 
Make up tutorial when you wear your black dress
Ps- Another fab vlog from you again Lyd, they just keep getting better!
Lumi does the paw and claw thingy to put his scent down there! He’s claiming you 😻
The paris dress matches the bag but not the black boots.....
You look like wonder women with those glases lydia so beautiful
I know your sister she goes to my school
kartal kalkar dal sarkar dal sarkar kartal kalkar

Love that Balmain dress!
Looooooool “hold on to ur butts” 😂😂😂

You are sooo pretty Lydia 😍
12:19 Lydia looks exactly like faryal makhdoom Amir Khan the boxers wife
Love your videos !!❤️
Lydia u r gorgeous!))
WOW...you look stunning !!
Loooooove the long vlogs xxxxx
PAT!! AHAHAHA
I think you look ten times more beautiful without makeup
Is your Peekaboo the mini size?
Patricia we love you😀❤
What is u nice hair Colour called?
LOVED your outfit to Paris: roll neck & H&M satin shorts. Obsessed!!!! X
What an amazing trip! The Balmain dress looks gorgeous on you!
Tori Amos for the runway show, GENIUS!!!
Hi Lydia! Love this video; as always :) and what a bummer. I was also so  excited for you to work with Brides because of how excited you are! Hope all is good between you both. 😘 😘
Lydia what photo camera do you use for taking pictures ?
Loved this vlog so much Lydia, you looked stunning as usual and your lipstick shade was amazing!! I wish they could put that on sale xx
Lydia, feed Lunie on a flat plate or a wider bowl. She might not like her whiskers touching the bowl when she eats and that could be why she drags her food out to eat it. Cats are weird like that.
Your older videos.were more watchable.n entertaining. Now it's so much of needless talking . Why change the concept?
Lydia please please!! do makeup tutorial on the one you were with the Balmain dress, it looked stunning on you!! xx
LOVE the first out. Simple, autumnal and your legs 👌
Your cat is just kneading :) they do it as that is what they would have done to their mum as a kitten!
I always wanted to make a lipstick! Lucky you!
I love that black dress, need it in my life, how tall are you and in wich size is it? :)
At the start of the video You did such an amazing job with your make up 😱❤️just loved it..
What is the lipstick youre wearing at the beginning? I need it
Love the ponytail look you've been rocking lately! Might you do a hair tutorial for it in the future? X
Cats do that paw thing because it reminds them of the womb. It's a comfort mechanism.  bless her!
I've been on maternity leave for the past two months and though I really loved watching your videos before they have become a nice break for me from mommy duties. I love what you do, you make my  day when I have me time.
loved the vlog such an amazing experience!! love Balmain
SWEETGREENS! I discovered them in the US and have been obsessed since. They need to open one in London. Like now. Literally the only thing I eat in America. #guacamolegreens\nAlso, you look gorgeous as usual. That dress is amazing on you.
That’s what cats do when they are happy and relaxed, it’s like the motion they made when they were kneading Their Mum while drinking milk as kittens.
Sorry, not a fan of those huge clear glasses....looks kinda odd ~_~
I loved ur video but lumi just makes its pop.  I just love her little self.  I have a kitty named Cali but she doesn't hardly talk.  Ever.  So my request is an entire video of a day with lumi.  It may be difficult with ur work and all but I know if anyone can do it, Lydia can.  Love u both.
the glow scrub must be new..it doesn't come up
Thank you for your wonderful vlogs! Would like to ask you a question. You and Ali are always traveling , going to parties, meeting different people. How have you solved the issue of jealousy?
So Happy that i found you on YouTube 🙏 love you Lydia 🎉
You are SO pretty😍
You so beautiful, I like your dress.
Cats do the thing with their paws because it's what they do on their mother's breast when they are nursing and they never grow out of it. They do it when they are warm, relaxed, and feeling lovey :)
Hi Lydia\nThe watch you are wearing in this blog will you let me know what make and size it is thanks. Have to say you look fab .
Love all your outfits!! You look amazing 😍 xo, Daria
Omg I would love a lipstick made by you together with L'Oréal! It would probably be the best nude ever. ❤️☺️
the london transport is really bad
been really loving your make up lately xx
Your gratitude is what makes you one of the best YouTubers.
That mayberlline red lipstick looks beautiful on you
Oh wow, must show us your final product of your lipstick :) Lumi is so cute, must have missed you so much 🐱
Its so wonderful to see your success. You’ve worked so hard for these experiences!
no sorry to the ladie below but Lids i love ur over 40 min vids....keep them coming.... :)
I absolutely loved that dark lipstick that you wore at your shoot! So beautiful
I'm waiting for the colder weather to come, so I can see your jumper dress outfits again!! My all time favorite AW clothing item, and you make it extra! I'm currently rewatcing some of your vlogmas 2016 videos just for that purpose.
when cats feel confident and secure they like to do that thing with their claws. By the way  i really love you and you are such an inspiration! Maybe you are comming to austria some day :)
Please do your evening makeup with charlotte eye palette
Wow, you look so beautiful! It seems your body is even more toned (not like lost weight, but more sports) and your cheekbones are chiseled and goddess-like! Really cool, so happy for you :)))
I LOVE when Lumi makes an appearance! 😻
I hope it will be cruelty free
Cats do that motion with their paws, because they feel safe and comfortable with you. Basically, it stems from how they would get milk from their mum as a kitten, so when they feel in that same safe way, they do it. It's super sweet, means she loves you lots :)
Wow, the Balmain show must have been a dream come true and it looked so extravagant and princess like. I am really sorry though about the Bride's Show. I know you have been looking forward to it. Stay positive, maybe an opportunity like that will come your way in the future!
Lydia you did not look bloated. If I'm bloated I look like 6 months pregnant 😂
Really bloated? Pleeease Lydia give us normal girls a chance eh?! 😂😂 \nGreat video! Xx
Love the make up look for the party. You look really pretty with ur hair tied up! X
Omg there was an Estonian model!!!!!! Im from estonia!!!!!! So proud of her, we actually danced together few years ago 🇪🇪🇪🇪
Ok but was the rubber duck actually chocolate????
So it's a chill one today, we're just heading to Paris that's it... 😂 who wants Lydia's life 🙋🏽
That balmain dress looks like it was made for you, fab! Xxx
That Balmain black and gold metal dress is sick! Love it! The bag should be w one handle and it'd be perfect, methinks?
OMG PATRICIA AND LYDIA IN ONE VIDEO!!😍😍😍
Patricia is my fave glad they appeared together on this vid
Love seeing my two fav YouTubers: Lyd & Pat!!! You two need to get your butts together and create a bleamin video, seriously!!!!!!!😂
I wanted to see the lipstick!!! Please show us soon.
Hey Lydia, I have been subscribed for a long time but in the last few weeks/ months I havent clicked on your videos as much mostly because they are always over half an hour long and to be honest while I love to see a vlog sometimes I do also like short snappy sit down videos. I do not have the time to watch 40 minutes of youtube and I dont wanna root through your vlog to find what you have bought or what you are wearing. I do understand that you want to share parts of your life with us but I'd much rather watch a series if they are as long as your video. I still admire your Style and your personality but I havent watched a full video of yours in 3 months which is why I have decided to unsubscribe. Just thought you may want some feedback. All the best to you <3
That Balmain looks superb on you✨Lumy probably approves of that one over the DvF 🐈
Love everything bout Lydia’s style ❤️but that nude/blue/black/white dress... no no no. 😬
How does yb not gain anything!!!!! Wish I can eat that much and stay skinny
Where's the white girl? (sorry for calling you that i just can never remember your name please come back)
I eat that without the bun for ketosis
You know what a good challenge is for you guys? Subscribing to my challenge. I bet you won't
diabetes on a plate, eat up! :)
They didn't waste it and thats all that matters to me so kudos Buzzfeed
I hate how yb is super skinny but eats all the time 😂
I would Love to try this challenge with a Vegan, so I could eat everything ;)
I'm here for you guys. I know CPR. Keep eating that much. You'll need me sooner, or later.
closer to 1x100 but still cool
I could have devoured it BY MYSELF!!!
click bait ow ah ah
She's hot
welcome to america.
I'm so hungry why would you do thisss
You guys need 17 American to finish 100x100. We need 5 Thai and that's more than enough.
YB EATS A LOT BUT SHE STILL MAINTAIN HER FIGURE AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN EXERCISE I DRINK WATER AND I'LL GET BLOATED INSTANTLY!
That girl is pretty
can i work at buzzfeed to eat that burger T_T looks so yummy ~
could of fed half of Somalia
It's metabolism, it's in her genes. She has giant shits, that is the only logical explanation when you think about it. \n\nI'd love see her bowl after a meal, if you know what I mean... (just out of curiosity)
YB and evan need to be in more videos pls n ty
YB is from outside of this world!!! She is in all of the eating-like-a-beast videos
I luuurve a nice blonde Asian, suits them
Matt stonie or furious pete will definitely complete this
isnt it just a 100x5
Evan and YB are literally the human embodiment of perfection.
Pretty sure thats a whole calf or something...
1:55. There's an article saying in n out managers and lawyers can earn the same over a decade working towards it yet only one will have massive student loan debts. Moral is if you work hard and can wait 10-15 years you can make a lot and have food benefits as an in n out manager
That's American for you
It's out of pure curiosity but I always see YB eating a lot of unhealthy food. However, she never seems to gain weight.
I don’t understand why they only had 2 people do it, and these two make a lot of similar videos. Have other people do it!
I could eat that
Lol my friend saw you guys buying those at ni n out
I could literally watch Evan do anything! ❤️❤️❤️
I want to see YB do competitive eating
I have never had In-N-Out....
Kind of find these video ideas pointless other than having views and revenue because it's just a waste of food.
THROW THE TOMATOES AWAY HOW DARE YOU.
I love YB i can relate to her soo fucking much
K so I'm a 6'3 fatass and I couldn't eat more than 6.
What’re the point of these.
dont mind being hired to do these :)
Cultural appropriation at it`s worst, there are no blonde asians, only white women can have blonde hair.
They’re making Evan lose his eight pack to make another ‘we got abs in a week’ video lol
That a lot of cow.
Why am I watching this? This is literally a vegetarian's worst nightmare.
Do buzzfeed people only hang out with other buzzfeed people?
Just wondering if YB actually has hyperthyroidism... She eats a lot but is too skinny even if she says she exercises every day.
Buzzfeed is trying to fucking kill these 2. They always do the eating challenges
they better be eating healthy for the rest of their lives
YB is a monster!! I wish i had her metabolism!!😅
I want to pipe her
i could eat this all my self
I can relate to YB. I eat more than my friends but I'm the thinness and i don't exercise ever.
I want in n out right now so badddddd bruvz!!
I'd need half a bottle of tequila for that.
In n Out is overrated. I  prefer Wendy's or Shake Shack any day over Inn n Out.
After 3 or 4 burgers I wouldn't be able to move ,these asians can eat !
At my In-N-Out (it's only in the state) I cover my burgers in *frysauce.*
Am I the only one who ships? Lolol
Is it me or the Asian girl is so cute
You could have fed 16 Poor & Hungry African children with this!
That waste of money......... millions in Africa could have eaten that
I love YB. She is fucking awesome!
I just had like two burgers and a fudge ton of fries and my stomach is killing me and I'm watching this and I'm actually puking
WHY AMERICA WHY!!!!
Waste of water...
Good luck with heart diseases
What’s wrong with me?? Why am I turned on watching her eat 🤤
Heard of heart attack?
When the said 100X100 I thought it was like 10,000 so step it up buzzfeed
Evan is from heaven 😍
im in love w yb omfg
@mattstonie
Omg, she's so skinny(in a nice way) and yet she can eat 20 patties. p.s 1 person 20 patties, 17 people 1 100x100 0w0 ok...
I wish i could do that! I love cheeseburgers 😍😋❤️
Bruh... Matt Stonie can eat it in 120 seconds !
They should date
In-n-Out associate. AMA lol.
Legislative computer shortly retired nonetheless van.
Metabolism? Nah fam, puking is what.
YB is so pretty !
YB plastic surgery much?
2:27 \nEvan: HELP MEEEE\nYB: 😂
i could eat 200 big macs rn
FAIL
somebody call matt stonie
YB what a fucking beast!
ORRRR she just has high matabalism.
Date already.
I love her! Lmao
YB is so cute 💕💕💕
Try tacos
Damn, only in America 😂
I'm not assuming bc I wouldn't know- but I feel like YB may have an eating disorder bc she can eat so much (binges) but shes pretty skinny...?
As a vegan, this is my worst nightmare
the other korean girl is hotter
Pathetic
Grace! I have been watching you since your first appearance on AGT. I think as of last week I had heard and seen everything 'Grace' out there. Then Austin and BANG, you blew my mind all over again. 4 new songs that are off the charts young lady. You seem to have an excellent crew on top of so much of what makes this whole thing work in this next phase I see you in.\n\nIn my opinion, you have knocked the new Album to a top 10 position on the Pop Charts. As you have said about AGT, ‘Miracles do Happen’. Don’t be too surprised, this is destined to greatness and if there were award shows in December 2017 coming up, you are winning some great honors. If you do that…if it happens that fast, it would be like a world record of Unbelievable Songs, Great Lyrics, Great Ideas, flowing, and Miss VanderWaal's two other huge traits. \n\nAs a singer she has transformed herself into a dramatic belter with the croaky voice when she wants it. But her voice is smoothing out BIG TIME and her control has become so apparent, which I didn’t expect so soon. This Austin Show, the act with the keys, drums and guitar was simple astounding!\n\nHow can you possibly get this ‘so polished so fast’. And to know you will continue to grow and bend and change and probably blow us away again in 6 months or so. \n\nThe cliché many comparisons have been made and I'm form the sixties and a musician all my life. She elicits memories to Bob Dylan, and the great poets of that era as well. Second, as a performer she has been aware of her abilities to elicit certain responses in her songs and performance from the words to the color of the lights to pretty much the whole show.\n\nThe way she commanded the ACL stage was her incredible ‘trying to please and make safe, the world’ energy coming together with what I think is the idea that she was a flower opening up and to see that manifest so quickly must be applauded. She reminded me of Bruce Springsteen. Dancing moving, looking so professional. I know you could write a book about reflections of a 18 mos and how to get this kind off transformation to happen. Maybe keep that a secret for a while.\n\nThe ACL show could not have been more you and not more professional. You had an extremely talented band who were taking directions of a 13 yr old and paying you total love and support with their smiles and eyes watching you; paying you huge respect and love. Who does this? Grace does. Especially your Austin guitarist was so communicative with her glances at you that I thought to put her on the full tour coming up, if you get her.\n\nI have seen nothing like this in 30-40 years if ever. Michael Jackson comes to mind. Congratulations Grace on everything do you; you deserve it an more to come. And we’re all happy that Grace tries to just be Grace without putting on too much pressure. Please.\n\nDe-stress in mediation. Don’t treat the treehouse as a summer 1 week vacation spot. Go there!
Just casually dancing down the street while this song is blasting through my headphones
i can't ESCAPE  the fact of how amazing this is
So much talent from little Grace !!
This is so good! I can't escape the song!! Rip replay button 😂😜😻
This song can't escape my mind lol
This song is so dang catchy!! Great job Grace!
The best young talent ever
0_0 Her voice has literally changed and all I can say is... ITS BEAUTIFUL!
All of ur songs r officially on my girl power playlist. Grace u rock !!
Im crying because im so proud of you ! <3
I LOVE HER VOICE😍
I love this song!!
this makes me wanna have a Grace Vanderwaal themed party and invite all fans
Her songs were all beautiful. I always cheer her.
ITS MY FAVORITE MUSIC!!!!!!!
At 0.29 its amazing! My voice is pretty good but I can't do that!
[Verse 1]\nIt was wrong, well, it never worked\nOr at least I told myself\nTo not make it hurt\nI try to blast music\nIn attempt to get you out of my eyes\nBut I can't escape my mind\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know we were never a thing\nBut I always think about\nWhat could've happened if we kept going\nAnd I never had this happen to me\nOnly in the movies\nBut honey it is happening\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\n[Bridge]\nI can't escape my mind\nI wish I could turn it off sometimes\nOh, I can't escape my mind\nOh, no matter how hard I try\nI wish I could turn it off sometimes\n\n[Chorus]\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind
This is my new Favorite song of hers 😍😍😍😍beautiful
This song gives me some old Sia vibes. So good!
This song is never going to escape my mind
I love you... <3 #Brazil
She is the best👏🏻
i wish i can go to grace vanderwall's concert i love her voice her talent her personality im like the same age as grace how cool
my GOOOOOD she is so talented!
This is a song Taylor Swift would make

Grace Avery VanderWaal, if you are reading this, I just want to say you are the best singer I have ever heard in my life. You’re amazing for your age, and I saw you from day one , season 11 of AGT , once I saw your audition and when Howie Mandel pressed that Golden Buzzer, I absolutely fell in love with your amazing voice! When I saw you win AGT , I almost when to tears because I was soo happy you won! I also heard you had a small concert in Japan! I’m glad you liked it there! I’ve been there many times I love it there too. You just have soo many songs and I can’t choose which one is best! The’re all soooo amazing! I wish I had an amazing voice just like you! I am such a huge fan of you! I wish I could meet you one day. That is my dream! Your name is also very beautiful -from your #1 fan Maya W It would make me extremely happy if you reply , even a basic “ hello” Ps I memorized almost all of your songs
It is only me or in the beginning I thought it was Taylor swift

Grace Vanderwaal and Melanie Martinez need to make a song together!
It was wrong, well, it never worked\nOr at least I told myself\nTo not make it hurt\nI try to blast music\nIn attempt to get you out of my eyes\nBut I can't escape my mind\n\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\nI know we were never a thing\nBut I always think about\nWhat could've happened if we kept going\nAnd I never had this happen to me\nOnly in the movies\nBut honey it is happening\n\nI hate you 'cause I've always\nLook at your picture\nAnd I tell myself\nThat I'm over you\nBut then I get a little unsure\n\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind\n\nI can't escape my mind\nI wish I could turn it upside down\nOh, I can't escape my mind\nOh, no matter how hard I try\nI wish I could turn it upside down\n\nI wish I could get you\nOut of my mind\nBut I think about it all the time\nAnd I wish I could not think\nFor once in my life\nBut when I see your face\nI can't escape my mind
Idk why but the beginning part before the lyrics reminds me of her song Clay.. memoriesssss <3
She is so amazing true talent!!

Hi
......your ..........so.....amaging
OMG I LOVE THIS SOOONGG ❤️❤️❤️❤️
400,000
This reminds of the day dogs😀
the one bit is almost screamo.
her voice in this song is like taylor swift 😍❤️
Bet 1,000,000,000 Dollars That Grace Won't Pin Or Answer This.
To WHOEVER ARRANGED THIS! .... Just a question - Where's the music?!!  :D
Simply Charming and Full of Vibes :)
So story time, I just found out my crush didn't like me because he told my other friend and I couldn't stop thinking about what he said so to distract myself I went to listen to Grace's new song....she literally is describing my situation right now.
She has a beautiful voice but the song didn't grab me as much as I'd like it to
Nigga was wall hacking too gawhdamn he doing it right
When a cracker does something wrong, he was pushed to do it....if you're non white, no matter how innocent you are, you're in the wrong....
I'm glad he didn't call the guns ghost guns
*Acoustic forensic firearms expert mathematically verifies two shooters and their locations in Las Vegas in this video: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxmEFeKy8aI*  Share it quickly with everyone before it's removed!  It kills the official narrative!
Um, why an hour later after the security guard notified police?
There goes all the fake ass Russian bots arguments that he targeted country music because he was leftwing.
Good on those cops love it
Go to: Movie BREACH - THAN YOU WILL UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jesus is the second shooter !!!!  He shot himself to look like a victim ! And his buddy ran away
Is it necessary for George Stephanopoulos  to teach me how to subscribe on YouTube at the end of every single video?
shooter? i would call him a terrorist, oh wait, he's a white caucasian.
Thankful for all of the brave men and women who risked their lives and saved many. <3
An hour before they got to him!! Are you fucking kidding me!!!
this guy sure did his research.
Did he just say the correspondent's name is Matt Gunman?
False Flag does not mean nobody was hurt. False Flag means that the official narrative has nothing to do with the truth.
Inside Edition said he never checked into any. This all is insanely sad.
This is proof that Hillary was involved in the LV shootings, look at how poor of a turn out for her book sales.
Sense when did they start filming these tragedy's?
United States of Idiots! How's that second amendment bullshit working out for you? He had no criminal background but look he carried out a massacre!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLkruVqQLEM \nyou have to be REALLY, but REALLY stupid and retarded to think that there is only 1 weapon shooting at a time. 5:00
Now whitey knows how it feels to be shoot at for no apparent reason, like innocent Native Americans , Blacks and Mexicans have endured for many many moons!
Where is the hotel security camera footage?
HOW MANY TIMES IS THE AVERAGE DUMBED DOWN IDIOT AMERICAN GONNA FALL FOR THE SAME BULLSHIT TRICK. IF YOU BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL STORY YOU'RE NOT FIT TO WALK THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH
100 round clips? those are 30 round clips. Only way for 100 rounds is in a drum.
Or they had multiple hotels in his name because they were shooting out of all of them! Quit lying MEDIA!!!!!!
Chicago Illinois was next Google it,
2:02 Just in case we suck at math... and common sense...
I hope he rots in hell for all eternity.
People tend to a build a wall when they have their own issues.
2:30\n\nWHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING IN ROOM 135\n\nhttps://www.cuteonly.ru/223394
alright so basically \nStephen Paddock wanted to kill himself, but since he was messed up he wantedto kill as amny people as posible with him\na clever plan. but not so clever if he kills himself
Wow ! Silly me!! I just got it !! It's like a dick extension having a gun and having a bigger gun is a bigger dildo!! It's only just occurred to me that this old dude probably can't get it up any more!! I mean look at all the younger spree shooters who did it because they couldn't get laid, well we know this dude had money and a girlfriend but he probably lost it cos he's now a limp dick!!\nYou see that is what you need to do now America, tell the truth about why a man would need a big gun , let alone 40 of them!! You need to let young kids know how deeply uncool it is to need a gun. What man needs a gun ? Over here in Blighty we would consider that being a pansy as tis old school to have a bloody fist fight and guess what? Nobody dies.
The sad thing is that these hotels have little to no security he could have done the same at any hotel bring all those weapons in ... also what did he have against country music instead of rappers? Hmmm....
There had to been two shooters. He couldn't have done it alone.
an hour later? Thought it was 10 minutes
Thank the lord he didn't shoot up the rap show....
*Every Racist Has A Black Friend*  The #1 Music Download of The Day \nShare and Order You're Right here    ( http://cdbaby.com/cd/stonethug52 )
Why still no fucking hotel videos from inside!?
Also google LIVEWIRE VEGAS. 1ST RESULT SHOWS A GRAPHIC VIDEO.
This are all fucken lies the media is reporting. Tell us the truth . Just let's us know the truth . He had help and let us know who help him .? Everything is fishy
Guns were placed previously in the room...the guy just walked in and got the keys at reception...inside job.
false flag perpetuated by the demonrat libtards to take away muh guns!
The conspiracy theorists are not the only ones u gotta watch out for now lol anyone can go nuts
Look for the photo released/leaked that show the dead lone wolf on the floor. \nThen take special note that there is a rifle on a bipod OVER his left leg. \nThey reported that he was killed on breech, then they said it was suicide, now they are back to killed on breech. \n\nLooking at his body position with the rifle over his left leg...... hmmmmmm>\n\nI hope you can find it, but the pic of his face shows he spit up a lot of blood, but you can see he was shot in the lower chest to stomach from the front. \n\nWith the rifles position and his final resting spot, that means he was shot by someone else standing in the room at the broken window. \nSWAT didn't enter the window and they did not have a sniper shooting into the room. \n\nFor all those who say the 4th floor muzzle flashes were the reflection of a strobe light, tell me how a moving cab wouldn't have fallen out of the reflective line of sight of that distant strobe reflection. \nNot to mention other camera angles showing the same muzzle flash. \n\nJust watch all the first shooting videos.....where the guy was still singing on stage. \nYou can hear shots and echo, but then you will hear overlapping fire. \n\nHead back to the pics in the room and look at the shot with his legs in the photo....top left of that photo is the window he was shooting from. \nThere aren't nearly enough empty casings on the ground for this to make since
He should've uploaded the videos to YouTube before he killed himself.
Who else flinched when they demonstrated the ak
WOW  Lone gunmen don't need several spots to shoot from,  Teams do.  Real deaths, real injuries, bad reporting.
What will be next step for USA government.
If we don't want this to happen anymore we shouldn't be creating more gun laws. We should just have metal detectors added to buildings. Going in and out. That way they can keep track of the firearms better. Concealed carry is ok. But you can't have someone stockpiling weapons in any building. If you bring a weapon in you can't bring another one in until your other one is out. Its called being smart and caring about what goes on.
Chicago people still being killed by gun men. No outrage there, the hypocrisy is real!
a sad moment in history
George Stephanopoulos is a little bitch, I remember he called this monster Mr Paddox fk him. Call him the killer or evil man, not mr you stupid ass news anchor. What a douche say what it is politically correct ass hole.
IT'S GOVERNMENT SETUP AND HE GOT FRAME FOR IT BLAHHH
what is that odd piece of furniture around 00:25 with giraffe print? strange, appears to have sections and cracked on the outside. anyone have an idea?
Why did he dicide to go and kill country folk?
FBI created a Lee Harvey Oswald.
More people, the better.
What about the note found near the body - WTF is the media suppressing this information?  They keep saying no suicide note or anything - yet clearly there is a note on a table right near the body!
Admiring the fact that it is fall and in Canada it's freezing but there you see he has his sleeves rolled up
were are the body cams of the SWAT TEAM when the breached the room???
I wonder if this happens in Denmark....
I don't understand why people want to hurt others life just because there not living an amazing life
My heart goes out to the shooter's family. They're the real victims in this shooting. If only the shooter had shot the fucking  redneck performer of the horrible music, I wouldn't have complained. It's funny how it's always white Americans that carry out innocent mass shootings.
Steve the shooter,  had 2 planes, I would like to see his flight records, flight paths, States and Countries he visited, petrol consumption, service maintenance recordes, who were his PASSENGERS ?? the passengers list. This would be in all aviation records. Perhaps he leased a plane overseas, this would be in global records, he would need to produce his licence, ID, PASSPORT, to lease any plane ABROAD, then there's the payment records to do all of the above, follow the money and his carbon footprint.
Media is either ignorant or complicit in the conspiracy. There were shots fired at the Belagio hotel over a mile away from Mandalay Bay. There were two people registered as being guests in that room !!!!!!
Cops told niggas to stay within the festival fences. Hm
MSN WIIL NOT STOP AT GIVING US FAKE NEWS/
Mr. Paddock just wanted some shut eye.

I wonder what those “fuck the Police“ people think about that when they need some one to save ther ass the police are ther when they don't need them they just talk 💩.
It's only a false flag when a white person does it but if you're not white you're a terrorist
That jackass modified his AR to fire as if it was a machine gun...
ONE HOUR LATER
..Gathering people who wants to be a part of building a network of stable, fully self sustaining and self sufficient communities (a.k.a. life-boats for the coming social & environmental collapse).  Peaceful communities that are built upon foundation of : love, spirituality, mercy, generosity, tolerance, intelligent, and wisdom. If you are interested in becoming a part of this grass root efforts, I encourage your reply.\n\nThis Community ARK Project is looking for peaceful, patience, humble, and kind-hearted people who are awaken and aware of the coming social & environmental collapse; who want to roll up their sleeves and participate in preparatory efforts. One cannot pull someone out of a raging river standing on a muddy slippery slope. In order to pull someone out of the river, one must stand on a firm solid foundation. A fully self-sufficient community is that solid foundation, upon which we stand in order to rescue other less fortunate who will be affected by the collapsing environment.  If people are struggling to survive as the environment collapses, how can they help others?  People need fully self-sufficient communities to shelter and nourish them, in order for them to reach out and help others.\n\nWe are gathering people from all spectrum of professional background: engineers, scientists, architects, biologists, farmers, doctors, nurses, artists, etc. Both skilled and unskilled people. Those with knowledge will teach those who lack them. Those not in the know will listen and learn so they might in turn teach others in the community. We have spent 6 years researching technology that were designed to allow Mars colonies to thrive in a desolate environment. We are now planning on using those very same technology to prepare people for the coming environmental collapse. If you are interested in helping out, we could use the help to reach the ears of people who are awaken via social media, or you can read our blog titled Generalized Plan of Action for a list of positions you can volunteer for.\n\nWe are speaking to those of like mind who do not need convincing; in their hearts and in their thoughts, they recognize the catastrophe that lay ahead if our modern societies continue on their current path of promoting competition, strife, ignorance and scarcity. This Community ARK Project is lighting a beacon so that those with similar mind set will know that they are not alone in their thoughts and impulse; that there are others like them out there who desire to come together to pool our effort in order to extract ourselves and place ourselves on a different path.  One that promote cooperation, harmony, foresight, and a nurturing environment.
Notice the WHITE media keeps showing MANY pictures of the non-white Filipina who didn't even commit the crime, but the WHITE man who's the perpetuator has only 1-2 pictures, yes, mostly ONE picture of him with EYES CLOSED.\nNo doubt they are trying to WEAKEN the image of the WHITE barbaric man in the head of viewers. \nDirty white bastards strike again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Could've done more damage if he had more time I guess. Probably didn't have good access to the concert to place any to use with the precision rifles he brought up.
The ignorance of the media regarding gun terminology is ridiculous. Sensationalized, uninformed garbage.

There is no way that a 64yr old senior citizen with no military experience could plan and finance that attack alone
It's only fake when a white person does the crime... gtfoh you sick bastards.
How is someone who put this much planning and effort into killing hundreds of people not considered a terrorist...
The AR15 should be banned
Don't worry folks, we will see the hotel security video as soon as they release a better video of what actually hit the Pentagon

This video is very simple and yet so meaningful, it manages to perfectly capture a feeling of finding your place in life, being part of nature and the universe, being free and living life with all its joys and sorrows. And Paris is a beautiful human being and such a talented actress, just look at how expressive and fluid her movement is when she is dancing!
thank you so much.. I'm almost in tears its like... I see poetry and beauty only, this song is inspiring.. Paris jackson is  so full of light.  I'm in love for the art of life.
So moving, totally resonate with this. You can just feel the energy through the music
Vim pela a Paris
Beautiful song. Nice music video. I love nature. We should all protect nature.
Beautiful beautiful beautiful!
Paris Jackson is great, this song is so relaxing
Nahko, you always make me want to cry and smile :)... your music picks me from ground many times. This song again hit my life, I finally found a girl that understand me. After year 3/4 year that i have a really bad break up, it end when it don´t have to. But now i feel happy and you make me fly in mind with my dragon fly :). You're music shaman to me and i hope this will come to you, to make your day better, as you make mine :). and to all of you, open your mind, open your heart and fly. Cuz YOU know you want to fly :)
I like Paris Jackson (Michael Jackson's daughter) in this music video. She is a pretty girl. This was a good music video and a good song. Very relaxing. You can play this at work or in your car on the way to work to calm and center yourself. I am a music lover...trust me this is a good song. Also I heard influences 100% of The Dave Matthews Band...instantly...the voice is very much similar to Dave Mathews voice! Not bad...if your gonna be influenced by someone then let it be one of the best bands out there.
Mmm right in the feels, but I'm feeling strong and unified. ❤
Jackson❤
Such a good song
Love always!
Medicine
This is medicine. It couldn't be more perfect. Thank you. See you in Bristol. Much love <3
I've been away from nahko's music for a little now, maybe two weeks since i heard a song? But i was drawn to search for him today, just after a new song was released. Spooky!
I dont even understand why tears welled up and why I find this so emotional but its a great video. I love his eye.
To the Few people who are commenting a Dislike on this song.  Keep in mind that it is a song Nahko wrote a long time ago.  This song is not indicative of where his Sound is moving too.  Nahko chose this song because it reminded him of his Friend - Paris Jackson and he wanted to capture her Pure and Natural Beauty and Inner Essence.  I Think Nahko and Crew did a Fantastic job in this..  Paris has a You Tube Channel.. You can see what she is really like.  A very down to earth young lady with a sweet soul.   I expect we will hear much more of Nahko and MFTP music that we will love as much as the other songs now and in the future 💗
Overall, all the comments about Paris make my point that it diluted Nahkos coming out. Its called MY NAME IS BEAR! his first solo album and the comments should reflect that. but, alas, don't.
I can not express how excited I am for this album.
Beautiful!
To the few dislikers..Find your medicine and use it. \nLove this song and new video Nahko. A true blessing to see Paris beautifully happy. So inspired. Thank you for sharing your music and the message. Much Love
Paris is the beauty of nature personified
Alguma boa alma traduz pro português por favor✌
My paris🌻💘
nice job folks- muy bueno
Paris seems like a reincarnated Flower-Child ~ evoking remembrances of my young days in the 1960's.  Pairs carries the beauty and grace of her father. Sweet soul, lovely and kind.
Special
Beautiful!
Why  not run the video in forward motion?
Paris has such a beautiful soul man. Omg. And she's gorgeous
Love this song! Added this song to the 777 Playlist: Dedicated to my love for music. Here I share video's of songs that empower, inspire, lament, activate and liberate. Clean up your mind! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd8Mr6E3x8Zj1cpcba79aOVTEBhovYUd9?
:) Nahko you never disappoint me.\nSuch a beautiful song and such a beautiful video.\n\nI love you guys. All of you ♥
This is such a beautiful song as as well as video, and it is mainly or partially due because of Nahko Bear. And of course  the other part of thee success of this video as well as song, being his producer or his producers.
my dream is to collaborate a song with you. hope to one day make that possible.
Thinkyouknowmusic on Twitter brought me here.
i'm in love
Great job.... Good music & video 🙏
Dragonfly up in the sky you know how I feel!

hello medicine tribe!  so glad to be a part of this movement as we usher in a new time and paradigm for a new generation..  Love you all!  Blessings of light on your paths.  Love you Nahkz! Thank you for the medicine.  You are such a powerful catalyst for change and a great healer.
I need some medicine right now. Active shooter 3 miles from my home tonight... two weeks ago there was one on the exit my fiancee takes to work...  why is everything so crazy?
Beatiful
You're music is a true inspiration

This is beautiful, the message is so empowering! I'm so grateful for these human beings! ♡♡♡
A survivors song.....thank you! Strength given and recieved <3
Loved it
I'm looking forward to the new album !!! Since I started listening to this group, it seems a lie, but my life changed. I have learned new things with each of their songs, they have helped me to overcome very bad moments, they have helped me to learn things, to make my life different otherwise ... Thank you very much for being there, Nahko and Medicine for the People\n\nRegarding this song, I love it, it's beautiful. I liked that someone explained to me a little what he understood with the lyrics of the song, because to this day, I'm not very clear about its meaning.\n\nThank you!\n\nMuch love and respect for all! : D
Beautiful video! Thank you!
Beautiful, thank you
chur..neat alright! plz come back to Aotearoa sometime soon!
Beautiful
La copia barata de The Scientist, pero con la sucia de Paris Jackson.
VEGANS save lives❤ \nI love you nahko😙😑😙
Paris is my new age hippie inspiration how she can be so beautiful I don't understand ☮🌸❤❤❤❤🌻
i love how in the end it seemed like paris melted into the ocean!
Paris Jackson is so beautiful.😍 Song is boring & music video was so boring.😞
Speechless.. an amazing song and very emotional the video.. i don't have enough words to explain how much i'm proud of you Paris...  your daddy is so proud of you.. thank you for everything.. a big hug♡
Whats the name of that dancing yoga practice that i see in almost all your videos ?
I hate Paris... but I love this song ❤
and i was embarrassed to tell people i still watch hey arnold at 30.
I wanna know how much she gets paid
I like watching these videos it makes me gain more self esteem
6 years ago he was 29 yrs old on a show?? Why do they say he's 31 now? Lol
He's gotta get laid
He's to big he's eating more than that. Lol
Send his retarded ass to Prison! ! Lol there's daddy a lot of daddies
What even, I mean the cat under the chair, what, the lady
Stay out of my recommended videos 😑
what the fuck why am i here
What the fuck is this shitttt OMG  that’s disgusting
this guy should go die
This is mentally ill person. He Needs some help.
btw how much does she get paid for all that
I swear to GOD he is a pedo
That Baby Food Must Come In Big Mac Flavor
Congratulations TLC! If this man is seen in public he will get harassed. Lol fuck my life... I'm still watching this as we speak and someone actually plays along to this shit... why am I back on the weird side of YouTube?
Well here I am to reclaim that my drinking problem is surely over now and I thought I had problems look at this guy is way worse than me I'm going to say this now I quit drinking I don't want to end up like with an addiction so to this day I give up alcohol now I needed something to help me but this freaked me out so you know why I quit drinking sorry Conker no more drinks
I wonder what happened to him as a kid that makes him have to convert into a perfect make believe baby stage :/ ... I feel bad for him... So Sad...
The fucked up shit is that, he's able-bodied (clearly by how he makes things) but, is collecting $800 a month from tax payers. He doesn't work and when someone investigated him, taking him up on disability fraud, he threatened to kill himself. He was like, 'This is the only thing keeping me here and I'll kill myself if benefits are taken from me,' and the court allowed his benefits to continue!!
Sorry but why is it normal to be into bdsm and worse, harmful things but it's not okay to do this (which so many people enjoy, a large portion is non sexual, the sexual part is people with a daddy kink)? If it makes them happy, let them do it. It's not hurting them or anyone else.
I watched this mouth wide open in complete disbelief. I'm so sorry I'm not sure I can take watching this. Is this a mental health issue? This dude has got some serious problems :(
What's up MTV welcome to my crib!!!
I would cry for breastfeeding from the mother
This is like a weird intro into a porn...
I can't believe this is actually a thing lmao, but if he happy then its fine, who are we to judge the way he likes to live
Okay This is like the story of a guy who goes in dog mode who thinks he is a dog this the same shit!
after watching this i personally think trump is a genius lol
People will do everything for attention.
What a sick man
What is the other section?
Looks like a raver from Seattle
is it me or he seems to be a serial killer
how can he be that fat when living on baby food
Where does he get the $?
How did this show up in my video feed😂😂😂
This dude got the baby dick too
Umm..what's he going to do when he's 80
Not to be mean, but somebody needs to slap the fuck out of him. He a grown man, and it's time to at least wear superman underwear.
This *could* all be a clever, long-term plan to get into that decent looking mommy's dress. For that, I salute you Stanley. How many people could say they were an adult f'n baby for years just to tap ass?
I aint even have to read...jst seen the thumbnail and clicked.
I'm finna call the police.
But the funny thing is that he sucks more tits than anybody else
I can tell you what the comments are like without even reading them! \n—Some are saying he’s nuts. \n—Some are saying he’s pathetic.\n—Some say he needs therapy and is a sad example of what happens when you don’t get it. \n—Some are saying “It’s his life - he’s not hurting anybody. So who are we to judge?”\n\nDo you see the problem with that last one? Sure, he has the “right” to, but it most definitely IS our place to judge. We all know he would be happier with intensive therapy to resolve his childhood issues.
Would yall live rent free in this house yes or no?
This is why I don't date white men... Besides them looking repulsive.
This is just disgusting man and sad
I feel bad for him like if my mom didn't treat me well when I was a baby I think I would end up like him and enjoy how it feels like to be one.
James from James and Mike AVGN channel?
Dat mommy dough 😂😂\nI'd pretend to be a toddler just to smash 😂😂
Straight to the comment section!!
The fuck is wrong with people
....kinda sad, he didnt have that as he was growing up, like he said.
i kinda wish i want white so i could say “glad this isn’t my race”
The 31 year old Virgin
Wtf is that 😷
All y'all tripping about him but are perfectly fine with grown ass women dressing up as babies (littles) lol yall have issues fuck you guys being a baby is fun
What a little kid
he gettin it with that baby sitter
Low Key I don’t have a problem but im having a asthma attack
Looks like a new scene for adult content if you know what I Mean
How did i get here
This guy is mentally ill
What do your parents think !?!?!
Well, hey, of its what you enjoy and it's not hurting anyone, go right ahead
This is what happens when you have sex with your family.
I honestly feel bad for him. Seems like he went through a trauma.
White people I tell ya.
Sounds about white... 😴
Oh grow up lol
WTF, haha
Just sad

OBAMA SHOULD CHANGE HIS DIAPER.

Virgin at 31......
That was wonderful. The exercise; Carlie's explanations and advice were so on point and just so good. I will remember this, use it, and share it. Thank you.
Loved this!! Annnnd Colette's pants are super cute :) \n\nXOXOXO
Thank you so much for this exercise. I haven't been feeling like my authentic self lately, and this has just made me step back and reminded me I'm a strong individual.
Thank you! Yes, the exercise was  helpful, I got teary eye.
Cathal love ❤ all girls Cathal like you girl \nI a am little sissy girl mistress
As I did the exercise with you girls I was so taken back by how differently I viewed my best self and worst self. How they almost seemed like completely different people. Thank you for this and for helping me reconcile my worst and best self. Self love is something I am working on too!
That was.... unexpectedly emotional! Jeez! From an overweight, suicidal college freshman to a happy wife, mom and fit triathlete. I've come a long way, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that through all the daily details!
This exercise was interesting.  Because as I am  urrently at my lowest in self esteem right now. It felt good to hug my old fun self and have my fun self hug my new sad self. It's weird to say, but it made me feel like I was being a friend to my new self as well as my new self felt relief for having a friend to hug and admire.
Oh mom's view gals, I needed this more than you know right now.
Wow, it's been a year since I was at my worst. Suicidal, unmotivated, etc. I'm doing so much better now. People keep telling me that I look different, beautiful, and happier without even knowing my situation. Improved mental health shows on the outside too, I guess! What a great exercise!
Carle I did it with you and it was great. Thank you
Does anybody know the name of this exercise or who created it? cheers :)
Thank you this helped a lot! high school is such a struggle for me competition in seat placement in music , being a clumsy/awkward lab partner, mediocre grades, parents saying I'm a failure and other insecurities I have. I feel like if I pay attention to the good times all the bad times will gradually vanish away and I will become the person I see myself as in the future :) at one point last year I was considering suicide because of all the academic and social obstacles I've been going through. I hope I inspired someone today and that the bad times are what make us a better person today :)
Hey an idea for next Friday could be to update us on all of your kids and maybe bring some guest stars (the kids)
I'm not sure this would work for me. I can't imagine meeting myself during the darkest time, because I'm currently in the darkest time right now
Thank you!  This was so great!  I'm leading a bible study for women called Broken, and Im going to share this video as one of the exercises we do during our time together.
Dont mind me being immature but this remind me a TON of Joy & Sadness from Inside Out! 😍😍😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm going to try this. After Vegas incident, I dont feel like a good role model for my kidsk as i come undone. If I can stop and say the chances are small and find the best me that knows through prayer and what I've learned I can pull myself together. I'll try anything. :(
Nice exercise thanks for sharing! Sweet lady's.....💞😊
Love this exercise! Thanks for sharing! What an awesome perspective!
I’m not a mom, but I love these videos! So much insight and advice. I love you all! 💛💛
Topic idea- finding a passion outside of motherhood
I love Carlie's top where is it from ????
I'd love if there was a self-help video like this every week :)
Carlie! You have no idea what that did for me. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart .
Omg I literally cried I needed that thank u
I really liked the exercise Carly!
Ugh this is why I love you guys. ❤️
I loved this exercise. It made me so incredibly emotional because I know my younger self would be so proud of who I am today. Made me want to go back and hug the little girl that thought things would never get better and just hold her and tell her it's all gonna be okay.
Thank you Carlie! This is a life saver! You're the best!
In love with Carlie's top! 😍
That helped a lot thanks guys 😊 I looked at myself two years ago when I was self harming and hateting myself. Then I put the person who I am today with her. Today I am happy loved and pregnant with a baby boy. I had them hug each other and the one who was self harming  was so happy to see the me today and was happy to see me/herself pregnant.  God had a plan for me and today I finally realized what it was supposed to be.  Thanks again ☺❤
Carlie I'm obsessed with your shirt!!! Where did you get it?
Can you guys pleaseeeee do a nother challenge
I cried. I seriously cried. I loved this exercise
Love you all ❤️💛💚💙💜
so love you guys!!
Definitely got teary eyed through that <3 thanks mums!
You wonderful ladies are such an inspiration ❤️\nLots of love from Dubai😘
This was so great and I definitely got a little teary eyed.
Loved this Carlie!! If me four years ago had any idea how happy me now is, she wouldn't have even sweated that stuff before!! When you're in the thick of it, people always say, this won't last forever, you'll get through it, blah blah blah. But you're always like, nope, not for me. I will be miserable forever. But little do you know that things DO change and they DO get better. Usually it takes time. But it happens. But gosh, back then I was sure I'd be that way forever. Hindsight!! 💜
that is very helpful ladies. thank you
Thank you Carlie that was so helpful to me💗
Awesome! I'm sorry you felt like you had to distance yourself from this beautiful practice and downplay it as hippie dippy it's ok to go for it and own it. 💖
I love this!!!! I am going to use this for sure in my own life. Thank you for sharing
This is wonderful....  Thank you for sharing this :)
After my mom passed I realized how much I leaned on her in hard times. I had the hardest time of my life after that and I couldn't lean on her.  I found the quote she needed a hero, so she became one and it really woke me up.  ♡
I love that Carlie! I’m glad that you guys are spreading positivity and self love. We need more of this around he world.
Great video
As soon as Carly said introduce yourself to yourself I started to cry. I needed this so much. Thank you 💓
Thanks, Carlie. That is very helpful. 😊
Collette don't be guarded let karlie love you
Can you guys do challenges again I miss them
This is an awesome thing to do! I kinda got teary eyed lol
So glad you ladies are all back! You guys really life this mamas spirits!! ❤️
You guys are amazing , this is helping me so much. Thank you ❤️❤️
I would love to see more girly stuff, girl chats, makeovers, makeup, hair, clothes talk and more. You should go on a girls trip and just relax, do some shopping, get massage, manicures etc
I love this exercise and I've done it before, it really works! Although I would've loved to see you go into more dept with this exercise. Like who did Colette and Kayli see in front of them in the bad and good times? More examples would make this so much better! We love to hear about YOUR struggles that you've overcome. Please keep this in mind for the next segment. 😘
Don’t understand why carlie not verified or hasn’t more credit becuase I honestly think she amazing inside and out she has the best personality and is an all around nice person
wow i did it with you guys and it was hard looking at me at my worst it almost bought me to tear and then seeing my good embrace it felt so relieving thank you guys for showing me that i can get through the worst by just thinking about all the good that my life will bring.
That made me cry 😢
Are you guys going to volg again
Carlie, this was such a lovely exercise; I thought maybe I'd feel too weird doing it but I decided to follow along and actually found it helpful. Love where the momsview is going! I'm going to keep this exercise in mind
Wow... I needed that! <3
This video was really good. I enjoyed the exercise very much.
I need so help my husband decided to walk away after 21 yrs of marriage  I feel lost
I really want to see all the kids and see how much they have grown
Love you guys!\nNot a huge fan of the extra camera angles... but love ya anyway!!
I would really like to see a video about infertility and its struggles from you guys and maybe an expert and someone who has struggled or is struggling with that. I think it’s a subject that’s not talked about frequently and something that affects a lot of women and couples. Love you girls!
I really enjoyed doing this :) felt a bit silly but think it worked to remind me of how far I’ve come in my life
I couldn't do it. yet. But I feel like my friends would love this, sounds so amazing
I think a GREAT show idea would be top self help books yall have liked, or a book club type thing.
Real moms have dirty windows. 😉 Good to see it's not just me. 👍🏻
It looks like collete is crying
Totally teared up while doing this. Thank u for reminding us to love ourselves through the good and the bad. Loving this new moms view!!!!
I love how genuine The Mom's View is!
That was beautiful! Thank you!!
dont like carlies self help on her channel either.i am a hippy and fake hippy isnt helpful
That’s bullshit she got cheated and she acting like he didn’t do anything wrong
That made me cry, imagining myself at my weakest and giving that person a hug. Thank you Carlie!
Mommytard is so sad at the end :( stay strong and think about yourself first cause nobody will no matter who you are.
How great. I love that. Thanks so much for sharing. \nSince I don't have any kids of my own yet, I wanted to know if any of you guys had fertility issues leading up to any of your pregnancies or even if you know people who have or do.\nI have been struggling with infertility for the last 3 years and I'm trying to trust in God. I'm having a really hard time knowing what my next step should be and if having kids is really what God wants for me. I am LDS and there is definitely some expectations I know that there is only so much I can control but this is something that is really really difficult for me to not feel shame and guilt about. I'm 29 and been married for 9 years for the first 6 years of my marriage we used contraceptive. I think, Did I screw this up? Is it my fault my body isn't working? Did I miss my window for having children? and all the time everyone is asking me when I'm going to have a baby. It was easier to tell people that we were waiting than it is now to say we are trying and failing. Any insight or even just words of advice you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks!
I love you guys, I really needed this. thank you.
Dear ladies, still so happy you are back. \nI would be interested for you to talk about cancer and breast cancer. Last year my mom has gone through her second round of breast cancer, the first was 10 years ago. It was a tough time and I learned so much about cancer and about myself. I feel like my mom, though right now she is struggling with depression, is growing stronger and learning so much about herself and her own strength because of the disease. What is hard about it for her right now and for me during the last year is accepting that you sometimes are weak and that you are not always at your best and you are still you and you are still a genuinely perfect person just the way you are. My thoughts, I would love to hear yours. \nBest wishes from Germany! \nOh PS I'll be in Santa Barbara, California and in south Utah the next couple month. If you do any kind of meet up I am dieing to meet you. You gave me so much strength, knowledge and are a big role model for me! Love you
Dark hard times make the amazing times even better :) life is about learning, sometimes we learn things we don’t want to but it’s worth it in the end.
One day I want to be this carefree
I absolutely needed this today because sometimes it's hard to remember that we won't always be at our worst... I love you ladies and thank you for having these chats with us. I feel like you three are the sisters i always longed for. \n\nAlso a Friday show that would be amazing: How to not lose yourself when becoming a parent/wife?
so glad this is back 😭💗
Collette are the shaytards making  videos  again????
Welp. If Susan watches it then it must go to the trending page!
So sweet
These type of things don't do anything for me.
*when are the shaytards going to post again*
Should have Shaycarl as a guest. Seeing how he is a selflove specialist. Only give him a twitter account and some lube.
I love this
Really really loved this video
OK. only 5 seconds eyes closed aaaand hello tears! lol thank you Carlie It was an awesome exercice.
I like moms
Ahh I love this very helpful. It was super weird to think about those 2 people because those are very different for me at least. Love this and love you lovely ladies ❤️
Has Carlie had plastic surgery or something because her skin looks so tight!
I like the original but this one BLEW me away. Its spectacular and beautiful
Loved that they kept the 80s synth sound and enjoyed the pacing. I don't think any of the characters are humans in this movie. Maybe Wallace only because why would they keep a blind replicant functional?
Love the original, loving this one too!! Gosling was phenomenal.. never thought I’d say that, but he was
Who had more screen time, the Joker or Mr. Wallace?
Not a huge fan of the original but possible it could grow on me. However, 2049 is already one of my top 5 best movies of all time. Wow, absolute wow. Not because this one was more modern or anything just told the story better I think and was less punk rock goofy and more to the point. Beautiful thought provoking film.
Tbh I'm not a fan of either, I got bored during both, but maybe I'm not smart enough for it
This was THE most boring movie I have seen in a long while
I've only seen the US theatrical version of Blade Runner on Netflix. I actually didn't like it. Thought it was boring. When I found out that it wasn't Ridley Scott's vision and that the Director's/Final Cut took all of the narration by Harrison Ford out and the cheesy hammed in happy ending out, I got excited. I gotta watch the final cut before watching this. I think the narration of the first movie's theatrical cut made it so boring and tiring. Without that, I think I'll enjoy it much more.
when korean dvd coming out
Could ye do a spoiler talk
I need to watch the original one and the Crunchyroll short before watching this movie. Great review, as always! BTW, do a review for Cult of Chucky.
Have you seen cult of Chucky yet?
I cried for K
Didn't love the original Blade Runner to be perfectly honest. However, this one blew me away in every way possible. It added to the original for me in so many ways. I feel like when I go back to watch the original that it will now have more emotional weight and that is what a sequel should do.
I don't know why americans pronounce the director last name vila-nuve. Hey it's like vil-nov
Blade Runner was a good movie, Blade Runner 2049 was a great movie 🎥 masterpiece of cinema made me guessing from beginning to end hope it stays as good second watch l☺️
One of the best sequels ever made in my opinion. I have already preordered it on iTunes. I loved it. I am sad that it isn't doing so good at the US box office right now but I think it will slowly earn back a decent sum of money. Doing bad at the box office doesn't change the fact that it's an excellent sci-fi movie and will look really nice sitting next to my copy of the 1st Blade Runner in my movie collection. I just love how it builds off the themes of the first movie.
I think Alphaville: A Strange Adventure of Lemmy Caution (1965) by Jean-Luc Godard is a very influential film for blade runner.
I didn't like the original but I did like 2049.
I'm NOT a fan of the original blade runner, don't like to watch it for several reasons. Went to see this one because of the reviews and the all the talent involved. I enjoyed it much more than the original. That said I'm again not a superfan. Would give it like 8/10. Especially the cinematography, sounddesign, visual effects and concepts were fantastic. I also found that it felt long and a bit dragged out sometimes, while then suddenly the ending was rushed compared to that. But minor flaws all in all, still a beautiful must see.
i think what made the difference for me was the soundtrack.  we unintentionally watched it in an extra movie theatre with comfier seats, bigger screen and stronger sound (not gold class though) and UGH, my ears were just taken for a ride... made me love the movie!
This movie reminded me of how good movies can be. And it didn’t push a BS liberal agenda which is unusual these days!!
Full franchise marathon first time today,  new fan of Blade Runner
I for one enjoy being in a theater and not my home when watching movies of this caliber. The sound design and score through arclight cinemas Atmos sound system was the best character of the film. I'm always perplexed at reviews of movies that are too long.
Didn’t see the original yet, will probably watch it now. I’ve heard to watch the final cut. 2049 was gorgeous and the best film of this decade. The score is spectacular
Blade Runner and BR2049 don't have pacing issues. In BR2049, every single scene moves the plot forward and contains important information to the next scene. Most movies these days are bloated with exposition and quick edits to make it seem like the movies moving faster but nothing of importance happens for like 30 minutes. In this movie, A LOT happens in every scene, the plot continues to build at a steady pace the entire way through, it's not slow or an issue because the scenes are just long takes that immerse you into the world and let you just breathe and take it in. That's *proper* pacing. If you say the pacing is slow or it's boring, it makes you seem kinda dumb, or your taste in film is immature and gravitates towards unimaginative crap like the MCU/Fast and Furious/Transformers movies.
great sound, graphic and cast.. still overrated.. watched this on midnight screening.. good lullaby..
I put the visuals right up there with Fury Road. I don't say that lightly. It was too long however. Shave 10-15 minutes off and this movie is nearly perfect.
respect your review but totally disagree with you about the pacing, that being said I'm a huge blade runner fan. I thought the sequel was one of the best sequels ever made.
I have nothing against Ryan gosling but in response to what Jeremy said in the first 1-2 minutes of this review.....Gangsterland (or is it Gangster Squad? I forgot). Man, is he bad in that. Pretty much everyone save Sean Penn phones it in for that movie.
It's about love and hope found and then lost.
I'm glad the movie took it's time. Finally!
The movie was a 3 hour bore. looks great though but not a enjoyable movie.
I didn't really like the first Blade Runner. I like the concept and the idea behind it but the movie itself I just didn't like\nI liked this slow burn movie a looot!  Darn well too long yes indeed.\nThe main complaints will be.. the audio balancing and the 'BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA s. \nIt wasn't the theater.. but the balance was just off, near the end of the movie, the SFX were just god awful loud then anyone talking is just so quiet. It was horrible when they did that.\nSecondly and far worse for me.. the Bwahhhhs.  Dear lord. They had over 30+ scenes with bwaaahhs for the sake of  bwaaahs. Trying to be hyper dramatic or something? Every. Single. set up scene that I can remember had their own bwah. Flying over the city? Bwaah. seeing the lil hover drone shoot out towards the desert? Bwaah.  Opening of the movie? Bwaaah. They had a bwaah. then a shot of his apartment for maybe 3 mins. then another bwah. followed by the inside of the car... then another bwaaah right after that.\nJust what the flying fuckery was going on with that?\nLike everyone was making fun of it from that one inception movie and after that it became a funny thing to comment on.. but this one can't even make fun of. just soo many...\n\nso yeah... the movie itself and content I all enjoyed but some random details just annoyed the hell out of me. \nStill i'd watch it again if someone else bought the ticket or it shows up on tv later.
I hated the original the first time I watched it. But I was like 15 I think. It bored me to death. Then I rewatched the original & the directors cut back to back about 10 years later. It’s one of my favorite sci fi films. But I can understand why a lot of people don’t like it. Prolly 90% of the people I know who have seen it hate it. They say it’s too slow & boring. It’s like an old 40s noir film meets science fiction. And I love it more and more with every viewing. The directors cut not the original lol.
Jared Leto was so under used. He could have been such a great Roy Batty. But the movie was great anyway.
HOW WAS THIS MOVIE NOT AWESOMETACULAR????!?!?!?
I was not impressed by Blade Runner 2049.  It was too long, too confusing, and its ending was too abrupt.
I never saw the original, still need to watch it but I loved 2049.
It could have been a good movie. if they made it 90 minutes , and cut out all the slow crap parts.  i was annoyed as fuck !
SOLDIER was the original Blade Runner Sequal
as someone who hasn't seen the original blade runner, yes this movie does appeal to casual viewers and it made me interested in finally seeing the first one although i'm not sure which one i should see since I've​ heard it has been George Lucas'ed
love your reviews Jeremy,love how you add those funny mimic bits in many reviews of yours. It would be great if you could actually do more trailer reactions too.the new JL trailer? Have you seen it? What did you think about it?
The thing about the action scenes were how brutal and uncomfortable they were. In real life violence isn't pretty and feels unnatural, and that came across here. Well done.
Anyone else find the first Blade Runner movie incredibly boring??
I've watched half of the original movie and turned it off because I thought it dragged on for too long, and then went to see the sequel. I loved that movie from beginning to the end, it felt like it was 1,5 hrs at max so I was shocked when u said 3 hours, 9.5/10
Blade Runner 2049 Full Movie Free Online HD  https://sites.google.com/view/blade-runner-2049-full-moviez/home
Kept waiting for the action movie I was hoping for--it never came! Not one action sequence in this 3-hour movie that was satisfying. Lots of expensive -looking visuals that did not further the plot. This movie is more like a Roger Deakins vehicle-- most frames were gorgeous but overly and meticulously photographed to a fault.
You cut your speeches too much, drives me nuts, learn to speak continuously for more than 20 seconds without making mistakes or losing your train of thought.
Can you do a spoiler review? I want to talk about holograms.
Is there gonna be a spoiler talk for 2049?? I'd really like to know your opinion on some story heavy stuff and your thoughts on the ending.
one problem: the future of automotive technology is in Peugot according to 2049...
I just hope Roger Deakins wins the Oscar this time
Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be doing well at the box office. Guess it's a blade runner sequel in more ways than one.
Ha! All the hype and so far it has bombed. Womp. Womp.
I kept thinking Robin Wright's character should have been played by Lucy Lawless. (Or was played by her)   ;)\nIt felt much smaller than the 1st movie, def could have cut a lot of this movie and yeah felt like a retred of the 1st.  :(
Don't like the original. Loved this one
god i could not watch this fucking dick cheese guy i wanted to slap the shit out of him with in 30 seconds holy fuck
How does this douche have a million subs?
So, I watched it with my girlfriend yesterday and she enjoyed the hell out of it. She wants to watch the first one now.
Can I watch this without seeing the first?
Gosling was NOT great though. His character was so FLAT. I had no reason to care for him. He was a sad, pathetic character. Don't agree with me? Let's discuss. =)
In the future you can torrent a girlfriend
I am not actually a huge fan of the original Blade Runner but absolutely love Blade Runner 2049
Can't listen to this idiot
No more official ratings? E. G. Awesometacular? Also Jeremy's has good thoughts, but his reviews can benefit from being longer
As I teenager I watched the original Blade Runner over and over again. Partially because I didn't understand it, partially because it was my only VHS tape, and I had a thing for Daryl Hannah.  After awhile I eventually read the short story it was based off of which was written by the guy who also inspired Total Recall.  While the film left you wondering about the humanity of it all, DADOES leaves you wondering if the communist have taken over but only half the population knows about it with dueling police departments loyal to two different governments operating in the same city at the same time.
If you have even a passing interest in this film, go see it. Just go in blind. Don't worry about reviews.\n\nTo quote Harrison Ford, I thought it was fucking awesome! I was blown away...
This movie is the new benchmark for cinematography and effects. It just looks breathtaking in every scene and the cgi is simply amazing. Every set and background looks real even though it can't be. The level of detail and thought that went into this is absurd. Easily a 10/10 movie for me.
watching this review makes me realize how much more i like chris stuckmann
I haven't watched any prequels anime or the 80s original. The film was still awesome and I liked being on the same page as K who also had no clue of the happening of previous events and kind of dug around and learned everything he needed to put the puzzle pieces together. I actually got interested in this movie through hype for an upcoming RPG called Cyberpunk2077. This is a beast of its own though. I didn't even see it as a sequel I think it's totally ok standing on its own.
Blade Runner is a strange mix of  70% BORING, and 30% Interesting.
I found it boring tbh. Had to leave half way through
This movie is way over rated
I left the cinema half way thru the movie because I can't stand it. A bunch of people left before me. I didn't even get to see Harrison Ford. The movie is so mentally tiring for me. The artsy production is amazing though visually stunning.
What's the scene you felt might have gone somewhere? K and his boss?
so is Rick Deckard a replicant? Was the child a cross species baby?
My mother and sister didn’t like the original so much, I liked it and my dad loved it. We went to see the 2049 an we all LOVED it. It was simply amazing and beautiful. Definitely not too long.
I guess i know why it didn't do well just like the original as it's october and audiences want horror movies for October you know and IT is still a smash hit! this is an excellent sequel that is on par with the lightning in a bottle original and who thinks this will be a cult film like the original or like Dredd? the director is the next Nolan.
Chris, like every other critic and person that loves this flick, is stuck in nostalgia mode. I have been guilty of the same thing, ie Indy 4 and Star Wars 7. Walking out the cinema, happy to just have revisited familiar universe. But once the nostalgia wears off, you realise how flawed it actually is.\n\nThe cinematography and sound was amazing I'll give them that. But the plot and characters were very weak. There was no logic to the storyline, potholes big enough to drive an 18 wheel through. I wasn't disappointed, as I was never expecting much, I heard the rave reviews before had, but new most the critics same age as me, 30 something growing up with late 70s, 80s and early 90s cinema, where just viewing this mediocre flick with nostalgic eyes.\n\nPs Denis is one of my favourite directors at the moment. But unfortunately I think his hands were tired having RIDLEY Scott as producer. I think if Denis was left to his own device's, he would of created something special. But under RIDLEY Scott who has single handedly destroyed the Alien franchise with his latest two attempts. Just leave these classics along.
I don't get the positive reviews for this Movie. Its good, but its not great either. Like Jeremy said the pacing is bad and if you pay money for a movie to watch it you should be happy about a long movie but it didn't feel like that.\nAlso everything was good but maybe too much. Everything was too much.\nEven the Hans Zimmer Music Style was too much for too simple scenes, like it wanted you to feel a certain way about a shot and the Atmosphere for some sceneries was visually so strong like you should feel like this about this scene.\nAnd characters were too much for me too. Leto was also not really needed here and I enjoyed some small characters like the Somalian Dude much more then him.\nGosling was good but I couldn't connect with his distanced and seldomly emotional and reactive behavior. It may fit the newer replicants but compared to the old movie he nevers feel like he is in danger, because he is like Terminator in Terminator 2. The bad guy has become the good guy and will save the day against the Replicant Terminatrix.\n\nI can't get the detail but it was overall an unsatisfying movie for me. Too long and too much.
What's up with your hand movements? Is that a trademark of your videos or something?
I split because Critics are giving the movie good ratings with 7/8 out of 10, Film Fans are giving it excellent ratings with 10/10 and general audiences seem uninterested. I haven't seen the movie but, I think the answer is somewhere in the middle.
I really want to see a spoiler video from you about this movie. There’s so much to talk about
Well done Jersey for not shying away from an insane running time. The movie could've been under 2 hours and been great. Instead it was overly long. I think it spoiled it for me
Watched the movie over the weekend, after having watched the 1982 one twice. As an animation & art enthusiast, it was absolutely breathtaking - I was sitting through the entire movie with my mouth wide open. The movie is full of haunting visuals, incredibly immersive audio & a whole lot of substance & heart. I whole-heartedly recommend watching it in a cinema, if you can, because this movie really benefits from it.
I like the old Blade Runner, but I do very much agree that the pacing in the old one and the new one are both just awful. Great ideas, philosophical questions about humanity and special effects are what makes Blade Runner important, but goodness gracious was this new one full of dull characters. The most lively character was Harrison Ford's. Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto are both phenomenal actors in my opinion, but they were both so crippled by their characters in this film. They didn't get the opportunity to showcase their talents in this one. The plot was also rather cut and dry. I respect everyone's opinion but that's just mine, and I figured I'd share it even though no one really cares.
This movie was bad ass
So his ratings out of 5 are as below i believe...\nAwesometacular - 5\nWorth watching and buying on blu-ray - 4\nFun time watch, no alcohol required - 3\nWould be a better time if drunk - 2\nGonna Forget in T-1 day - 1\nDogshit - 0
I didn't watch the previous BladeRunner, but I did watch this one, Have to say the lore and story behind felt confusing at times, and overwhelming at others. \nbut overall I did enjoy the movie from an experience perspective, and surely I can tell that it is an amazing film, especially to those who are fans of the first
Love Blade Runner.
No Awsometacular? C'mon Jeremy.
It was absolute trash
spoiler review?
🔴 *Blade Runner 2O49 Mᴏᴠɪᴇ* ✅ bit.ly/Blade-Runner-2049-FuII-Movie
HATED the original, LOVED the sequel.
More excited for Dune honestly.
This movie sucked soooooo bad!!!!
Boring Movie of the Decade, slow , predictable and weak story line, barely any action , gloomy , and annoying music and characters were pathetic
evidently every reviewer that got a screening was obligated to rave rave rave...
So sweet of Mathew to wake you up like that!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It honestly baffles me that some people find the motivation to put actual clothes on when they're not going to leave the house
I think my cats would try to eat me if they didn't get fed right away.
You're such a go-getter, I can't beLIEVE how motivated you are. And I/we/your audience can tell that you are this productive all the time because in your daily vlogs you always get so much done. It's honestly amazing and I think you're super rad. You motivate me to quit procrastinating on crap in my life and just get on with it. Keep up the good work, but also don't forget to give yaself a break now and then, too!
Body looks amazing!🙌
I love how motivational this is but realistic too. No, I wake up bright and early then I use these 10 products then I have a bath using this product then I do a 5 mile run blah blah blah. You get shit done whilst still being a babe. Love you Hel. One of my utter faves.
I'm so impressed by how much you do in the morning and by the fact that you get yourself up to workout so early! I can hardly get myself to workout at all. \nAlso, your house is so beautiful! From the wallpaper to the tiling it's stunning.
Dear lord, I class it as a productive day if I get a few of your morning things done 😐\nNeed to get in a routine like this :')
Loved this video Helen! Although I'm so bloody jealous of how productive you are, if it's a work day I wake up about half an hour before I need to leave and if it's the weekend I stay in bed until about midday hahaha
I don't know how you are so productive all the time! 💖
Anyone know what vacuum she has? Thanks xxx
This video is so well done!
Where are the jeans from !!!!!
New subscriber!! Tidying and cleaning is therapeutic for me also!!
I have a double leash for my bubbis too and it's the best!!!!! <3
Where are the jeans from? X
Where did you get those pants?! They are amazing!!
Love this video!! Looks amazing
Love your trousers where did u get them from please ❤️😀
Could you do a video on the best places in Norwich please? I've just moved here for uni and it would be useful to know some of the best places :-) thanks xxx
Helen, this video is amazing! It's like high-production film, so well made. Loving your content as always!
Any small YouTuber's wanna help each other out? 😊❤️
I would love to see a tour of your place. Just seeing bits and pieces makes me want to see the whole thing put together!!!
Your curves are to die for, darling! And your outfit in this video is stunning.
love the colours in this video so much, so PLEASING
I wish I was able to wear no makeup to the gym but my skin is horrible so I always have to wear makeup even if I'm stepping like one step out of the house
I bloody love you.
OMG YOUR HOUSE IS LIKE A DREAAAMMMM <3 I love it !
Where did you get your jeans and top from? Pretty sure I didn’t see them in your misguided haul so just wondering where they were from

The push up needs to be in an arrow position rather than a T. If you stick your arms so far out you put unnecessary strain on your shoulders.
I just love your videos Helen. There’s something about you and how you film and edit your videos which makes you so unique. 💖
Omg helen you look fabulous in those jeans and shirt with the fluted sleeves 🔥
Wear is that top from??? does anyone know?? I love it!!
You get a lot done before lunch! I also feel your “pain” with a light colored pet. But the floors aren’t dark the furniture is..lol.
I’m reading Order of the Phoenix at the moment too haha
Ahhhh finally a morning routine again!!! I loved it:)
Your a busy busy bee! 🐝 Leg kick dance when your getting dressed - yes! Agreed living room always looks a mess, always replumping pillows 😂 x
Those trousers while you tidying look very sexy on you Helen! 💛💛
Those jeans look great on you.
were are your pants from? I love them!
Where did you get those jeans?! Love them so muchhh❤
So well shot, love it!
I wish we had decent seasons here 😐. We have stinking hot, hot, cool, a day or two (this year we had two Mondays)  of coldish and uncomfortably hot
THOSE JEANS. I must know where
Where are your jeans from?!!  They are so nice 😍
So disciplined to workout first thing in the morning! but girl you need to have proteinafter your workout or you wont see changes!!
Those jeans on you, Helen!!!! :') <3 <3
Totally off topic but where did you get your couch? Is it comfy? I've been searching for a nice one and I can't seem to figure out what is a good deal. lol
I love your home it's so cool. Luv from California
The bit with Matthew in the morning 😭😭😭 you guys are so cute
Great job, Helen! love the quality and effort 💕
The only thing i want to know is how long all of this actually takes you to do 😊 i struggle to get things done in the morning
Maff is a gem, you’re insanely motivated and inspiring, and my fav part is Lola peeling out on her walk.☺️
Where are those new pants from? 😍
Helen how have I not found your channel before, god you are a breath of fresh air! Loving your videos xx
Fab video! You look absolutely gorgeous 😍 also twinning with those white boots, I absolutely LOVE mine 😍
Does anyone know what camera Helen is using? :o\nI always found it's such great quality hhh
Gotta know where the jeans are from 😍😍😍
Love those jeans, where are they from?
this was so nicely filmed and narrated, it's like the perfect mix of casual and chatty, but still filmed in a professional way yknow
You have such a nice body Helen💜 not to sound like a creepy weirdo lol but you do
Babes that black outfit is banging on you. You have such a nice shape

This video is so pretty
Please do a jeans haul! It's so hard to shop for jeans 💖\n\nLoving your morning videos 🖒
I need to take note from this!!! On my days off I struggle to get out of bed before midday - and days when I'm going somewhere I usually give myself half an hour to get ready😩 What sort of time is it usually when you're at the point of makeup done, gym done, editing done etc, & ready to go out and get on with your day? 💖
GOsh I love these kind of videos theyre suuuper entertaining
i don't know what it is about this video, but it was gooooorgeous!! love it
Ahh where did you get your jeans??? They're so nice. Love your vids xx

This is legit your morning routine....I watch your daily vlogs to vouch for you!!! God I feel like a creep!!! Good woman yourself, getting up that early ...my heroine!!!
You should get a new toothbrush. But other than that cool video, you're very proactive.
This really motivates me to sort out my morning routine and start the day right 😁
Omg your house Is a goal..would you malé housetour?
The way you filmed this video is simply amazing! It's so well done and gives the feeling of a beautiful movie! Everything you do has just the best quality

When do you do a jobby?
I NEED that top! Was it in your recent missguided haul because I can't find it online :(
you already have a morning routine for autumn? girl it's been 2 weeks
MAFF IS SO SWEET
Love how you stick your finger in the tea haha.  I don't have a routine, I really should.....but most mornings it's: debate whether to shower or not, eat breakfast (a leftover reese's peanut butter cup) LMFAO what is wrong with me??
Pleeeeeease don't use those plastic milk pods for your coffee! They're not biodegradable and they're so so harmful for the environment. Please consider drinking your coffee black (if it's good coffee you'll love it!) or making your coffee by other means. Lovely vid, all the best <3
I still can't get over what they did to Akuma... and Ken... did they... did they murder the old character designers? Who let this through?
TOOOO FUCKING LATE CAPCOM\nand still no Xbox One X and Switch yep another commercial failure like MvCI
It needs more views..
Free? See now was that so hard capcom?
I WILL NEVER PAY FOR A FREE UPDATE!
Angry Joe where you at?
Finally Street Fighter V is good enough to play. Finally!
I see Capcom finally decided to step up. Hope it's actually good and not just hype.
Come on, Capcom... can Ryu get over the dark hadou already? It's been like 20 fucking years
Free update this is heaven.
The dead horse is flogged to mush at this point
And it only took Capcom a year and a half to finally make me, a dirty filthy casual, to consider getting this. Just having Arcade mode does wonders, don't you think?
Okay guys im planning to double dip since I have not bought any season passes and only unlocked 3 characters thru FM and bought some dlc costumes too. So what I want is to buy this edition to get the characters. Do I get to retain my bought costumes and stages ?
so the full game was supposed to be out in january we got half game so is this gonna be a content download cause i already have sfv
To all of you people saying it's free 😂 \n0:59
This not gonna change the fact that you came out with a incomplete game still
game still SUCKS SACK ill go play usf4 on practice mode, so i can throw a fireball with my foot with ken
Maybe it will sneak to Xbox now
I'll wait until they come out with Ultra Street Fighter 5.
This mode shouldve been available in the game since day1, shoddy practice that hurt more sales because lets face it console gamers and some pc gamers dont care about online only play and go on forums and alot more say this release is too late theyve moved on from this game. Have to say capcom even with no xmen in the marvel game and no arcade mode it really does stink where midway is the better fan friendly fighting game company. MKX, MK9 and Injustice1 and 2 really are not bad games and I find to be really good
Congratulations, it only took almost TWO YEARS to give a game mode that MUST come from START and FREE in the launch game.\nThat's the new idea now ?? sell GAME MODES like DLC
Anyway since I already own the game but didn't get any DLC, i'll just sell my current copy and then get this edition to get it with the DLC.  At least that way i'll be spending $40 instead of $50 on DLC? Smh still kinda a loss though.
Now I have MORE of a reason to get Street Fighter V when I get a PS4 Pro.
Oh no Chun-Li showed her underwear. SFV Arcade Edition banned at ESPN now.
Finally over the years..arcade edittion now...take all my money alr!!!!
fuck you capcom for not giving so much importance to Ken when he's one of the best in All Street fighter series and most anticipated Character in online and on Pro tour Competition and winner plus Finalist,  they didn't even Put him on this trailer and gave him a shitty role in SFV's story mode when he deserves much better storyline along side Ryu and guile  *raises middle finger*
Put it on Switch and I’ll buy it.
This would've allowed the game to fully capitalize on the market, had it been available on release. While it will be a nice addition to the game, business wise, it may be a bit too late. Only us who already bought the game will benefit with the new v triggers and stuff.
Glad to see the game is finally leaving beta.
lol they finally finished the game....
Thought you guys said there were NOT to be any new versions of the game, just the initial release.
GIVE US Oro and Sean Please
It took them this long to put in an arcade mode? I feel like it was forever ago when they added the story mode but I'll be honest beating the original street fighter was more fun. Street Fighter five was better than street fighter the movie the game though.. can't even force myself to make it through that game.
Good move capcom now make the right choices for infinite and things will go your way drop a huge graphics patch music adjustments and a massive roster overhaul
holyshit arcade mode is it true?
Street Fighter is vastly superior to Mortal Kombat.
SFV is not doing fine and MVCi is rising fast, so Capcom need to buff SFV to keep SFV alive.
So its a free update for those who bought sfv
OMGOMG THATS WHAT MAKES CAPCOM A GREAT COMPANY!!!
Now what we need is the version MVCI arcade complete no more dlc edition
Better fix bullshit in this game balrog,cammy,and fucking zangief so  god damn tired of getting grabbed a light speed can't even do a combo with his bitch ass around
Shit Fighter got a bit better now , but it still a piece of shit. Took CrapCom all this time to have an Arcade mode which were suppose to come out upon game release , not DLC.
Man i need a strory mode between Ryu and Akuma!!\n2 V triggers \nNew stages\nNew characters\nBonus stages\nArcade mode\nExtra battle mode\nCAPCOM YOU ROCK!!
Are characters gonna be free too?
I can't believe it's been 30 years for this franchise
If I buy this version, will my christmas Juri dlc transfer
We were sold the beta version, so MVCI I will wait for the free update and not buy DLC
Why are people complaining about that they need to pay this!? It's also a free update, but you won't get all the Season 1 & 2 characters though. Seriously people... either buy the game, wait for the update or don't buy it. Geez, read the description...\n\nOther than that, I can't wait for the new updated version of Street Fighter V! That's how it should've looked like before! Thanks Capcom for making Street Fighter V Arcade Edition! #CapcomRules
This is what Street Fighter wanted, Dhalsim's brother Dhalsim said paint.
Just one question.I have season 1 pass but not season 2,will this effect me if i cant get it for a free update?.i got season 1 pass on day one of release with the collectors edition.
The update it's free, but the season 1 and 2 characters not. Right?
It's obvious that all of those dislikes are from people who didn't buy the game.
Whos coming for season 3 tell us Capcom
So, the DLC characters will become free?
*Phone rings and Sagat answers\nSagat: What? \nCapcom: We aren't doing too well.\nSagat: .....on my way
Nice only 2 more years for ultra sfv
I have a Xbox.
Remember the SFV will not have the same shit treatment as sf4/ssf4/usf4? ... look at this
Ehh should have released a complete package in the first place
HOPESTAR OF CAPCOM\nGIVE ME THE FAME, THE MONEY, THE GLORY OF ARCADE EDITION
Except I as a day one player still have to grind endlessly to unlock all characters(or cave and pay up) while Arcade buyers get a code to unlock them right away. One step forward 2 steps back seems to be par for the course with Capcom these days.
i love street fighter
Nice games almost out of beta
Best fighting game e ver!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well I'm guessing I'm head to the arcade, cause tk7 arcade ass I'm huge tekken fan myself but come OK harada just 5 matches tk6 arcade was a lot better but he well learned, I bet sense ono put arcade in it harada going to compete well sure as hell love competition 
If the leaks are true, people who buy this will actually get bamboozled because they'll have to grind Fight Money to unlock the DLC characters instead of having them right away, a grind which of course (Capcom being Capcom) can be dodged by just buying the currency directly.
Yay another beta game being sold for $60
And the third update going to be super street fighter 5 and the final updated going to be ultra street fighter 5 with 60 playable characters?, i hope so
how everyone says how cool and nice this is from capcom.\nThis is something that should have been in the game right from the start.
It's a *completely free* Update of a game that cost 18.99-$20 max in stores.\nTake that damn dislike off the video, Capcom did okay with this one.
🤔 https://twitter.com/TheRealAwest/status/917590738787094528
Meh, I'll stick with Tekken 7
Finally, damn
so exiting over 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AT LAST! FUCK! %&$%#%$*%#(!^(#^ Slow CRAPCOM!
Finally
Time to redownload my SFV
Switch version please
Fucking finally Jesus Christ
WICKED AWESOME!
Ultra Hyper Mega Turbo Super Street Fighter V  Deluxe Edition. Avalaible on April of 2023
This is amazing
Worst Street Fighter, Ever.
Un chiste \n.....
I Really Miss SFIV AE
*meh✅🙄*
Si no fuera por las noticias de el fedelobo no me entero habia olvidado que este juego existia la verdad
When's Sakura?
plz dont fuck this up
Too late Capcom....too damn late
Xbox one x
Getting Tekken vibes from this
Este mensaje va para Capcom,\nSi queréis que el juego triunfe y que sea un éxito en ventas, tenéis que añadir a la edición arcade el pase de temporada 3 y 4 también. Aparte, empezar el juego con todos los escenarios desbloqueados, y tener la posibilidad de desbloquear todos los trajes, incluidos los premium con el fight money. En resumidas cuentas, la gente que compre el Arcade Edition, que lo tenga todo sin tener que realizar ningún pago en el futuro, eso haría que yo mismo comprara esta nueva edición y eso que pagué los 70 Euros de Street Fighter V. Para que lo entendáis mejor, echar un vistazo al Battlefield 1 Revolution, que inlcuye todo el contenido y los próximos DLC's en un único pago,  39,95 Euros/Dólares.
Now we wait for Super street fighter V then Ultra Street fighter V and finally maximum over Street fighter V ultra arcade edition.....
FUCK YOU CAPCOM , you dont give the dlc for people who've already played your unfinished game????
Dear Capcom,\n\nIf you're gonna make Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition Awesome then ever, here's what you gotta do.\n\n1. Characters\nBlanka\nE. Honda\nSagat\nSakura\nDan\nGuy\nCody\nSodom\n\n2. I want Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition on the Xbox One. Because I don't own PS4. I really really REALLY want Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition on the Xbox One so bad.\n\nI just want to let you know I'm not telling what to do. I'm only asking you. It's for the fans.\n\nSincerely,\nAlec James Rathermel
still feels incomplete if you ask me
.... but there is no arcade cabinet
There's a misconception that's every is free. IT'S NOT.  For the people that bought the original SF5, you still have to pay for the season 1 and 2 DLC characters....that's not included in this update for you guys
are the characters included in the free update?
From the director of Nightcrawler Yeeesssss
i by Kendrick Lamar
I knew Denzel's He Got Game 'fro would make a comeback!
GUARD, GUARD!! lmao
Take my money ALREADY
I'm tired of doing the impossible for the ungrateful.  That's fucking beautiful.  This looks like a great movie.
🔴 *Roman J Israel, Esq. 2OI7 ~Mᴏᴠɪᴇ~* 【 naver.pe/ggi60y50gl 】
why do they need to show so much of the movie? hell..theres no need to spend 10 dollars watching it at the theater...better  plan would be to just wait for it to come out on DVD or cable.
OMG, I have got to see this!\nSHUT-UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!
Denzel can still grow a big afro at his age wow
0:58\nI love his character already
They should rename it to Jubal j.cain, he's not a Roman Israel descent typical Edomite Jew wordplay LOL what a joke
Even denzel gets that feminist bullshit
Looks interesting
Likes 666\nUnlike 40 ,,,,hola heck .. good flick  just sayin
I love Danzel Washington, and I cannot wait to see this! My 2nd most anticipated film of the fall season!
The whole we were filming this movie it was called Inner City, i guess they changed the name in post...
So this is the movie Ashton Sanders told Denzel on the red carpet of the Oscars that he was gonna do with him! Too bad Ashton had to drop out of the project :(
I love Dankzel. Finally! A movie against all this liberal agenda bullshit! And here I thought Hollywood was forcing a liberal agenda on us.
So this is why he gained all that weight.
Each one of us is greater than the worst thing we've ever done.
writer and director of NightCrawler, alright, i'll give it my attention.
Bout time this trailer dropped! Can't wait for this performance by Denzel.
Test it but not repeat ?
oh hollywood ugh
I LOVE MYSELF
Looks good terrible title
Another Oscar
Have to watch.
Denzel can play anything.Cant wait
#VamosSuscribete a mi canal  por favor plis
When Denzel goes for shots at another Oscar....I'm there for it.
Definitely will be seeing this. November is shaping up to be a good month for movies.

Sony Pictures Entertainment, you guys should team up with LEGO to make a LEGO GhostBusters movie for all of the long-time GhostBusters fans and all of The LEGO Movie fans out there and then make a irresistibly fun LEGO GhostBusters film franchise out of it and it'll be THE greatest film franchise Sony Pictures Entertainment has ever made in recent memory. The long-time GhostBusters fans will even say it's right up with the hit TV show, The Real GhostBusters, itself on so many possible levels. #LEGOGhostBusters
Where are the trolls? This movie looks good!
I know a guy who's a local pimp, can I report him to the cops for cash??
We must realize that our party’s most powerful weapon is RACIAL TENSION. By propounding into the consciousness of the DARK races, that for centuries they have been oppressed by Whites, we can mold them to the program of the Communist Party. In America we will aim for subtle victory. While inflaming the Negro minority against the Whites, we will endeavor to instill in the Whites, a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negros. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the PROFESSIONS, and in the world of SPORTS and ENTERTAINMENT. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to INTER-MARRY with the Whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause.” AUTHOR – Israel Cohen(Zionist — Communist — Internationalist) “A Racial Program for the Twentieth Century” >Published in 1912 . On June 17, 1957, the above passage was read into the United States Congressional Record by Rep. Thomas G. Abernathy.
NO Oscar for Washington. No nomination. Nothing. This movie is awful
more stupid worthless niggers trying to play the victim bullshit
I am going to post some short videos on Instagram (@ChrisFixit) answering some questions like if I was able to make a U-turn instead of a K-turn now. Also I am almost at 100k followers on Instagram so be sure to follow! Once I hit 100k I am doing a giveaway of ChrisFix swag with 7,000 winners!!!
I love the way you do the video editing.
I can't stop watching!!\nToo much knowledge wtf
Your very helpful
#darya salih
OK AOUSM
Bro stop being smart
ROLL CAGE ON YOUR MASTANG!!!!!!!!!!!!
Editing is freaking sooo cool. Amazing.
Shopping cart angle
Fiesta sharp turn mustang tiny bit sharp turn
How to install roll cage
*post
Hey Chris! Loving the channel I've been subscribed for months, I'm loving this mustang build! Just wished you'd post more often ): I wanna see more of what's happening and what you have planned for the drift stang!
HEY GUYSSSS “CHRIS FIX HERE” and TODAY IM GOING TO SHOW YOU lololol. No one does is like you do! LOVE IT and just for gigs, i was able to see your face in one of the videos😂😂😂
Can you do a carburetor video. I'm sure some people have old car/truck projects that would help
Be careful when doing this. The wires in the steering column to the steering wheel may not like the extra strain. Most cars should have extra and shouldn't be a problem but that's not something you want to find out the hard way you're wrong about.
Thx for the tip at the end I was wondering what that noise was in my truck
Now u need a wide body kit for that crowd killa👌👌👌
Next vid please how to install a supercharger
Can you do a video on how to install a turbo or supercharger? (Preferably on the DriftStang :))
Hey Chris I know this is off topic but I wanted to make sure you would see the question: what is your opinion on BAR'S LEAKS power steering and transmission repair fluid?
It's amazing to see how much you've done to this car considering that it had been sitting for a long time. The car is now a celebrity!
Hey Chris, could you do a fix video on noisy truck/car windows. Have some wind coming in my windows and it’s terribly annoying.
THIS IS AMAZING XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD its really good as always.
Chris, can you make a how to drive manual video?
So when is the I'm going to fix the dent in my father's car coming?
Honestly, when I am bored and go on youtube, I look for a new video from you, or i re watch old ones over and over again. Love the videos, keep up the amazing work!!!
I just wanted to say, thank you!\nMy crown Victoria would still be a piece of shit if it wasn’t for you!
Completely off topic, Chris what are my options for upgrades on my stereo in a 2017 Malibu
so if you're removing spacers to get more angle, why do some cars need rack spacers to get more angle? i can't get my head around it
Does this Mustang have reverse Ackerman geometry? Both times when he measures the steering angle, it shows a bigger angle when the wheel is the outside wheel than when it is the inside wheel. \n\nUnless the rack just has more movement one way than the other!
are you going to the YouTube callout by streetspeed717?
Does anyone know how to make my turning signals louder? I just got my grandpas '96 Chevy s10, and the clicking sound is so hard to hear, it's almost silent. It's annoying cause I keep thinking I forgot to put my signal on
Make videos more often 👌 tired of waiting for the one or two videos per month lol
Chris you should do a video on undercoating!
how do you learn all of this stuff its crazy man your the best
Great video! It might be worth mentioning that (at least in my country) it is illegal to drive with the edges of the wheels wider than the car body, which it looks to be after you installed the spacers. Your YouTube channel is IMHO the most informative one ever, amazing content - keep it up! Wishing you lots of awards and plenty of cash for what you're doing!
I searched your videos and saw you haven't done how to change brake hose so if you would do that it would be nice :)
This kid is so impressive, a real go-getter.
yooo may u do a video about car that start and after few sec dies ?? i need a solution ahm one engineer told me that this happens when the car was not started in few years but i wanna be sure that it cant be from other thing.
Could you do a video on a 90-99 Mazda Miata
Space those back wheels to the arch looks horrible at the moment
Are you going to install a racing steering wheel
thanks for this video. I have been trying to increase my steering angle. this video was very helpful for me.
Hey Chris can u do a q&a. I think a lot of us got some questions for u including me
I just deleted the sway bars and bought negative offset rims.
My 2000 toyota corolla does an excellent job when it comes to turns, but my 2011 chevrolet impala sucks! I hate the chevrolet impala, plus I have to spend more on gas. I used to perpendicularly reverse park easily with the corolla, but now I have to turn before I perpendicularly reverse park with the impala. When I was driving the corolla I would wonder why do people turn before they park? I thought It was just because they're lazy (and that may be the case), but now I understand. They can't make sharp turns. Like my corolla could. I will say the Impala is a bit faster but every car has its advantages and disadvantages. I don't like impalas though. I would (and am going) to sell it for another car, a ws6 trans am.
Great job Chris !\ngreetings from Israel :)
Chris i have a old 4wd but it keeps over heating my 4wd is n dedicated rock crawler please show me how to install a electric radiator fan plz
there's a 99% chance I'll never do this to my car but I enjoy watching your videos
When the rack in my V6 2000 Mustang went out, I thought I was gonna be a little badass and buy myself an 04 Cobra terminator steering rack, and man lemme tell ya there went ALL my turning radius. Seriously considering this mod, since the bump stops in my 04 CObra rack are for much wider tires than stock 00 V6 tires and wheels
I think I fell in love with cars by watching your videos
He's making a wheel spacer/adapter video.  _YES_
When are you going to install the roll cage
Chris goes above and beyond to explain things in his videos, literally. The drone footage was a nice touch. Kudos mi amigo.
Can you drift next ep
Hey man.whats up ?I'm just one of your followers and I was wondering if you can help me with something.... today I was putting some brake fluid in my car but for accident I didn't read and it was the steering fluid... what I did was I took it out immediately with syringe and I took a little bit more that what put... it was just like 1 to 2 oz of steering fluid... my question do you think that's gonna cause any damage ?? I haven't use the car
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE YOUR VIDEO
How hard/easy is it to put new alloys on your car?
You should make a video on how to put a wrap
Hey Chris.. need a bit of an advise. I hear a clinking noise from the right front underneath my car. Have taken it to 3 shops and they all say they can't spot anything wrong and that the suspension is all good... What can I do next.. ? Any thoughts?
Is there something loose in the front end? At 2:08-2:10 when he is stopping the whole wheel shifts compared to the car. But in a side to side action...give the car the back to back movement when stopping.
Thanks Chris fix this helped my rx8 because the angle isn’t the best on it
Hey Chris! Would you happen to have a video on fixing a parking brake that's mounted down by the pedals? Like one that's in a 92 GMC Jimmy. If not, could you make a video on it? My Jimmy's parking brake lever is broken
Seriously need to do this on my K74 L200 😂
Chris, you are an absolute star, really I swear you have helped me through so much on my car, all the best!
Could you do a video, how to improve windows open/close. My get a little bit stuck while opening HELP :)
Was watching your video on gaining steering angle and noticed something. Former tire tech here in Ohio. L9ng story short, take a wire grinder to the back of your rims where they meet your wheel spacers, then have them rebalanced. That oxidation can cause a bad balance, and more importantly, can cause your lugnuts to loosen via vibrations. Alot of tire shops don't do it. We do alot of high value cars, aka bmw's, vette's, benz's, etc. We're the only tire shop for 3 hrs drive that most bring theirs in for us to work on. Just trying to help, faithful follower here!!!
More videos on the stang Chris!!! Pleeeeaaassseee!!!
Can you make a video of cleaning windows not the windshield
You're awesome Chris! No matter what the Junkie says, keep on keepin on! Cheers
You have probably the best channel for vehicle tutorials
do a face reveal
when you said torque the wheel spacers to spec do you mean you tightened them to the same torque as the lug nuts were originally, or do the spacers come with their own torque spec?
can you make a video on how to stretch a tire
Chris do you still sell the chris fix shifter knob? I looked on your site and did not see them
I Love your videos! I installed new Brakes all by myself ...and they are working! Thanks to you ChrisFix! saved me alot of money! greetings from Germany!
You should make a video on how jack up a car and how to fix the common problems.
Do a video over supercharger on the driftstang!!!!!!!
Chris doesn't reply to my comments anymore :(
Do not do this if your car is front wheel drive or all wheel drive, because exceeding the designed angle limit of your CV joints is a good way to destroy them.
Has you're ford windstar had a recall?
I can tell you put a ton of work into this. It turned out great! Thanks for making this.
auto transmission to Manuel conversion can you?
liked for the visuals
That CardAngelBoard was giniuns👍👍
@ChrisFix - I'd be interested to know how the spacers would effect a truck, mainly 4 wheeling. Thanks
Go drift in a frozen lake its alot of fun trust me its just no grip at all and no matter if you spin out get someone to make you your own track
So now your front wheels stick out from the fenders, and your rear wheels are tucked in under the fenders. You put the spacers on the wrong wheels!
Hey Chris can you make a video of how to replace the backup lights switch on a manual transmission vehicle
Plenty of room\nLiterally like 3 hairs of clearance.
i just pull the ebrake to do sharp u turns much easier and quicker
What is that sticking out of your front bumper on the Mustang?
Awesome vid...thank you so much for putting in all that extra time and overlay vids.  Top Shelf stuff!!!!
I've always wanted to know how to do at least a little on my own vehicles. I've never had anyone to teach me. I've watched every one of your videos the last 3 days and I really might go out and try something myself with what you've taught me. Thank you
why there is a tongue sticking out of your car ?!!
Your angle measure wasn't aligned with the wheel, cause you shouldn't have different angles whether you turn left or right. It wasn't 30 and 25 degrees, it was probably something like 27.5 and 27.5 degrees.
Chris you have not upload any video... please upload now!!!
Hey Chris Fix Can you make A video on how to get your Car ready For Nitrous?
Sorry its not in spanish for you spanish speaking people.
Estoy 100% seguro  q el comentarista es chileno
I think Chile can make it to at least the semi finals in the world cup.
Me da gracia, hay mas perucas que propios Chilenos, como siempre pendiente de su padre.
jejejjeje ese es mi chile el bicampeon del mundo
Las clasificatorias sudamericanas sin duda las mejores del planeta.
Chile great team... we wanna see it in Rusia!
Chile gano sufriendo , gracias a ese defensa bruto de Ecuador q se resbalo😡😡, y colombia estaba celebrando y burlándose de otros y ahora esta en riesgo lol, estas eliminatorias sudamericanas ya nadie es local , cualquier cosa puede pasar en cualquier minuto , solo se respira cuando el arbitro diga Fin
Jajaja Brasil los va hacer mierda!!!
que me hacen reir los chilependientes
Alexis Sanchez is there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He was the fox
Go Chile, from England!
Pobre chile! Le hicieron la cola... jajaja
soy peruano y trabajo en Chile hace cuatro años ...quiero a mi pais y quiero ver a la roja en el mundial ...viva chile carajo !
Difícil estas eliminatorias, esto se putio porq ganó Paraguay, chilenos diciendo q ya clasificaron. Acaso no ven que se van a enfrentar a Brasil, selección que jamás a perdido en eliminatorias  y que está hecho una máquina para jugar al fútbol? Argentinos, ir a ganar en la altura de Ecuador? Colombianos y peruanos que partido más duro, y paraguayos, acaso no han visto los últimos tres partidos de Venezuela? Esto está jodido
dare mis pronosticos \n\nArgentina le ganara  Ecuador que ya no se juega nada saldra sin motivación \nbrasil  le ganara por diferencia de dos goles a Chile \nParaguay le ganara a Venezuela\nPeru vs Culombia (el mejor partido de la jornada) sera una guerra no pueden escatimar sera todo o nada a culombia con el empate le basta. peru necesita el triunfo partido muy dificil me inclino un poco hacia un triunfo apretado de peru.\n\nChile y Culombia se quedan fuera. califican brasil,uruguay,Argentina,peru y Paraguay \nopinion personal creo que es lo que va a pasar veremos.\nMostrar menos\nRESPONDER
Que chileno tan rico cuando se saca el polo. Que cuerpaso ,
espero que chile no juegue sucio  porque ya lo hicieron antes en BRASIL https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maracanazo_de_la_selecci%C3%B3n_chilena\n\nЯ надеюсь, что чили не играют грязной, потому что они уже делали это раньше в БРАЗИЛИИ
Jajaaj Chileindios ahora a perder contra Brasil jajaja!!
Grande el Mago Valdivia! el ultimo 10 clasico de Chile...  ojala y nuestra seleccion Colombia pudiera tener a Macnelly Torres para esta fecha, Dios quiera que Colombia y chile clasifiquen pero para poder ver al Mago y a Macnelly en el mundial. Saludos señores amantes del buen futbol
ese hijo de puta del arquero bravo no la ve ni cuadrada...tirelen pijas gringas al negro ese van a ver como las ataja todas con la jeta ..jejje

3 cupos para 5 equipos,esta claro que CHILE es el que la tiene mas dificil ya que jugamos con brasil,paraguay es el que la tiene mas facil pero veremos muy pronto de que estamos echos,peruanos muy agrandados por que le empataron a argentina cuando le ganen 2 finales consecutivas hablamos...
Brasil Uruguay Perú Paraguay Argentina.Despúes no digan que no avise.Chi chi chi le le le lo mira por la tele!!! Por las dudas soy uruguayo.
K lastima k no hay carteles en ecuador
El 2do gol de Chile : Cerca a su área, un defensa ecuatoriano está en posesión del balón, un delantero chileno lo empuja, hace caer al defensa, el árbitro no cobra infracción, y se generó el gol chileno
Volvió esa mierda de valdivia, bueno en fin la mayoría son una mierda: jara, arturo, medel, etc
Vamos Paraguay carajo!!
SI NO QUIEREN QUE TANTO NOS OCUPEMOS DE USTEDES, PORQUERÍAS, SIMPLEMENTE NO TROLEEN NI COMENTEN HUEVADAS EN VIDEOS PERUANOS, NO PIDAN DEMASIADO, PORQUE IGUAL VAMOS A SEGUIR JODIENDOLES MIENTRAS NOS SIGA DANDO LA PUTA GANA, VAMOS PERÚ CARAJO, EL CAMINO A RUSIA TOTALMENTE DESPEJADO, CARAJO!!!!
es gracioso ver a peruano chilenos y ecuatorianos llamando se monos entre sí \na jajajaja todos son monos!!
Chilenos el martes lleven su bacelina q brasil se las va a meter doblada rotos hijos de perras :) ! Peru y argentina en el mundial fuera chilenos indios :)
error del back ecuatoriano
Esperaba mas de esa seleccion pero la victoria que han tenido contra ecuador,no fue tan merecido,ya que sus dos goles fueeron regaladas por los defensas ecuatorianas .....veremos con brazil ahora!!!
Pobre Chile, Brasil lo va a violar en casa
cholo, deja de estar pendiente de tu padre, entro a ver los goles de Chile y solo veo a cholos picotas comentando
Les regalaron el partido a los chilenos.
uds creen que brasil les regalara algo o se dejara ganar o empatar , brasil se perfila como primera potencia futbolistica y quiere recuperar eso . mucho menos quiere cerrar con derrota en su propia casa que ingenuos. ya fueron chilenos.
Es increíble como los peruanos culiaos andan mas preocupados de Chile que de su mierda de selección jajajaj
TODO ESTAMIS IGUALADOS POR UN PUNTO CADA UNO EL MARTES SE JUEGA SU FINAL ASI DE SIMPLE. AQUI YA NO ESTAN LAS MATEMATIKAS ETC.. EL MARTES ES UN PARTIDO PARA CADA SELECCION SU PASE ALA FINAL..
Por la culpa de quinteros no pasamos al mundial:( pero ahora ay que pensar en catar
ROTOS Y LA REPUTA QUE LOS PARIO...
SOLO EL CHILENO EN EL SEGUNDO GOL NO LO MARCÓ NADIE Y SEGUNDOS ANTES OTRO CHILENO HABÍA HECHO FALTA
Waa genial ver como muestran estos partidos en Europa y en Rusia en especial
se viene un partido difisil que es brasil
3:15 que emocionante el relato😭😭 claramente lo dise hdjndidjdjdbĢuiűű§😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hello Neymar tengo lubricante para el martes
4:05 \n*voz de Homero*\nEs que es mi primer dia!
Me gusta como otros paises le tienen miedo a chile y ven los videos y todo, siempre atentos a los superiores
estos peruanos que llegan solitos a humillarse, les gusta decir que Brazil nos va hacer mierda, les gusta escuchar eso por que su selección nunca lo hará xDd
NADA MAS CON ESTOS TRAIDORES DE ECUADOR!!
Es tan malo ese gueon de bravo
Chileno que no le gusta la pinga no es chileno :V
Ke inocentes estos de ecu! No te pueden meter 2 goles robandole la pelota al defensor!!
Que asco con ecuador como regala ese segundo gol así , se nota que querían favorecer a los rotos por que Perú los dejó fuera del mundial
una cancha que parece un patatal pero no es culpa de la gran seleccion chilena, es el Estadio Nacional y sus putos conciertos de Guns n Roses y Def Leppard, una pesima pesima organizacion.  Coordinacion mediocre.
El arquero se entregó en el primer gol
chicos pasen por mi canal, tengo videos interesantes que les pueden servir como bajar sin límites por mega, hackear wifi , juegos y otros trucos y programas , saludos
increible como lo perdio ecuador,estamos meados por un dinosaurio
puta que son feo los chilenos weon, la cagó XD
Ecuador se puede ir con la frente muy en alto si elimina a Argentina del mundial.Sera recordado por los Argentinos eternamente.
Ahora con Brasil moriremos peleando hasta el final. Muy buena eliminatoria.
rotitos por los ingleses para
Puta madre! Renovaron Ecuador completamente y si mejoro el ataque pero la defensa de antes se tiene que quedar. Necesitamos Ayovi, Erazo, Mina, y Ramírez. A chillier también está bueno en Mexico
tanta gente insultando a los países vecinos y creyéndose el cuento de que pueden “predecir” de que uno le ganará al otro...en serio digo , no se pueden calentar por un juego...que inmadurez más impresionante , pero bueno , de mal en peor van todos . Que gane el equipo que mejor juegue , ya fue .
Brasil en tus manos encomendamos nuestros espíritus(Colombia,Peru,Argentina,Paraguay)
Jajaja lo bueno q Brasil de local no a perdido ni cagando perderá con los chiliindios.\nVa mejorando el idioma chiliindio entendi al comentarista cuando dijo ecuatoria jajaja
Buen partido, saludos de Perú

ECUADOR 1  - CHILINDIOS MARICAS LAMEHUEVOS  DE LOS INGLESES   2
Like si crees que este partido estaba actuado como juegan los ecuaterianos....???? este partido está comprado por chile...observen a los de ecuador cuando chile tiene la pelota..
en el segundo gol de Chile fue falta, empujo al defensa.
SOY CHILENO ME ENCANTA EL PERRO AL HORNO Y LOS BRASILEÑOS NOS VAN A DAR UNA MANO POR QUE NO LES GUSTAN LOS ARGENTINOS  PERO NADIE  ME  QUIERE SOLO POR QUE ME ADUEÑO DE SUS COMIDAS Y SUS TRAGOS  OJO COMPRO ARBITROS Y DIGO QUE SOY EL CAMPEON DE AMERICA
Dicen que Chile perdera ante Brasil, nunca hablen despues de tiempo. O quedaran como Argentina, decian que les iban a ganar a Chile 3, 4 a 0 a Chile en la Copa America 2015 y 2016 y que paso? Nunca subestimen a NADIE
Chilenos hijos de puta
Que se siente que ningún país de tu continente te quiera ... Afuera chile
Espero que el pueblo chileno se haya dado cuenta que este partido fue comprado... basta con ver el error del defensor ecuatoriano seguido de la marca del resto de los defensores ecuatorianos que se quedaron mirando al linea pidiendo offside
Mala suerte para los chilenos😡😡😡xd
Sanchez hijo de tu puta madre mal parido d..... menos mal que Brasil les ARA mierda 😹
235 COMEPERROS LES GUSTA ESTO :V
Pinches chilenos roban siempre cabranes los partidos pero brasil los hara mierda

Juegan con el arbitro a su favor, así cualquiera gana :v

I love when Winfrey and Degenerate, and their ilk, pretend to be normal people.  They are like plastic flowers.  Totally fake.
Take Oprah  through a hunted house!!!
Ellen is mad LOL I got a feeling if I went shopping with her and she started embarrassing me I would pretend that I am going to the tolite but really trying to get away from her from the shop and if she says where are you my response will be I forgot my purse I'll be ten minutes but really sitting down at home enjoying winding her up 😂 I'm to kind to poor Ellen 😂 I love her show it is so good she is so funny. 😁
They r so blowed.
Oprah thiccc tho 🤔😈
So crazy
20 mill subs dang
I would love to shop with ellen
When Ellen scared opera at the cashier with the skull, Andy was behind them and got scared more 😂😂
I was on Oprah when I was a baby.
I wanna see Beyoncé doing this 😂😂
3:57 i absolutely adore how the mother covers her daughter's eyes from the Tugboats magazine😂😂❤️ and THAT is education 🙈💕💕
i laughed so hard when ellen ask what size of zucchini should she get.
I haven’t watched this yet. But after knowing what the Michele Obama one was.  I don’t think I’ll live after this video. (Dying of laughter of course)
Ellen: Picks up cucumber\nOprah: What are you doing with those?\nEllen: (Shrugs with big smile)\nI'm done!!! lmfao
Omg I hAve coupons oh my God I love Ellen so much I am laughing so hard right now 2017 10:43 p.m. Chicago it's my city
I’m pretty sure Oprah was faking getting scared by the plastic skulls
Plot twist, Oprah comes out as gay to Ellen on Ellen's show.
Ellen is so irritating she isn't funny now repetitive
hahaha! This is amazing! Two frickin awesome woman! Love this! I wanna meet them both!!
Ellen: Which one do you want\nOprah: this one is too big \nOprah: and this one is too small\nEllen: 😂😂😂\nMe: Dammn Oprah she has a specific size 🤣😂
So Ellen is being funny when she makes Oprah look like a clown using melons to degrade her, but that's funny! Smh! But then Cam makes an unintentional statement that was deemed offensive too many women, but no woman is offended by Ellen's behavior! Typical! As long as women do things to each other it's ok like constantly referring to each other as the B-word! I'm appalled by the hypocrisy. Using a cucumber to make fun about a male size and how to use it! All of this is so-called cute when they do it! So pathetic! Then Ellen using a mic to embarrass and degrade Oprah making it appear fun. This is so offensive, and not funny at all.
I wish I could say the last time I went to a grocery store was years ago 🙄
when you casually go the the grocery store and end up riding home with oprah and ellen...
What gets me, is all those people holding up their phones. Obviously there is a camera crew and it will be on youtube, ellentube, and national TV.  They'd already have a video copy.  Take  a picture or 2 and then put your damn phone down and enjoy their little show there!   And now all you people have phones covering your faces, so no one can see you were there now anyways!
name a more iconic duo... i'll wait
The sad part is that you know those peaches all got bought that day!
I love those ladies 😊
What brain dead considers this entertainment ?? A racist and a dyke shopping...REALLY !! I guess this caters to the TV crowd or clueless libtards . When is Oprah going to do a special on the Blacks who owned slaves in the NORTH after slavery was abolished ??....crickets
How did I even get here I don't even WATCH this channel!
I can watch them whole day 😂
I would cry if I saw those two.
Refuse obvious relieve ah as daily blow win writing.
I love Oprah but she is trying too hard to beat Mitchell Obama hang out with Ellen coz that was absolutely amazing
*Brings a big bag*\n\n*gets food*\n\n*puts the groceries in the bag without paying the money*\n\n😂👌🏼
Oprah hair is so pretty!!  I mean gorgeous Even!!
Omg so funny you are both God bless our souls
They are so funny together
Ellen and Jake Paul are are honestly the craziest people when it comes to Stores and shoppin😂😂
Was Ellen named Ellen? Or, was she named Hellen and decided to drop the r?
When that kid just stared at Oprah when Oprah said just drink it
Lol, 3:55, the lady covered her daughter's eyes 😂😂
This guy is rich
This is going to be the inspiration for my next video. Crazy
I feel like these grocery store videos are just Ellen and her friends showing off how rich and entitled they are.
d most powerful people in d world oh God
When they were holding up the magazine of Ellen the mom in background was covering her daughters eyes
0:50 is me shopping with my nan 😂
I almost died of laughs!!! Awesome clip.

I love Ellen. She is so funny!
i love Elen and Opra they're funny as hell

Ellen is so crazy😭 no doubt.
I love Ellen and Oprah.
Only Ellen can make Oprah do that. Lolz
I couldn't stop laughing Ellen is hilarious & that lady & her daughter are so lucky to have gone home with Ellen & Oprah

To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud holy water in God's hands song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit.

I didn't know Chucky was a lip-pouter.
You earned my VOTES! I didn't know we could vote multiple times! And ticket prices are amazing it quoted me $44.75 that was on the site.
You already KNOW I love this shit. Buttttttt, as a girl new to SFX AND WHAT NOT I would love to know which editing software you use for your intro and videos!!! \n\nXoxo Love ya betch
Hey Mama Hanz!🤗 This is my 3rd Hanzoween and I LOVE your work! Its so detailed and you always learn something by the end! I think your looks using sfx like your Jigsaw and mummy are sooo amazing but can you also do lots of looks that use just body paint? I absolutely love watching you create such deatailed and dimmentional looks with just different paints! Its truly a joy to watch and to learn from you! I soooo look forward to the rest of Hanzoween! Its my favorite time of year on YouTube!!! XOXO💜😘
And that will suck All the dick greatest phrase ever. stealing it.
Seriously, think you two could be sisters. I, at first, during the intro, was like, hmmm, which one is Jordan....then I'm like...duh, Chucky....Jordan is Chucky.
I don't know why, but black lipstick is sexy af
I'm so happy to have watched the two of you together :) The two of you are amazing to watch absolutely amazing artists and can't wait to see if you both collab agin through out the month of hanzoween..... :)
Literally thought Jordan was Jaclyn Hill in the thumb nail! 😬
The Lady who played Chucky looks more like Tiffany tho lol
There aren’t enough thumbs on YouTube for how much I like this video
Jordan looks like a scary but somehow still pretty Jennifer Lawrence 😂 and Kristi is a bad ass as always
I loved this video😍😍😍😍
how do you not have more subscribers?? i’ve honestly never seen a more talented artist 😍
You make Chuckie look pretty af. #hanzfam \nCan't wait for more collabs with you and Kristy. Y'all did great. And the red hair looks awesome on you.
Chuckys scars are on the wrong side XD
Is the pros aide cream essential and also how is the alcone 3rd degree going over your brow, do you cover the jar to protect it? Thank you, hoping to recreate for Halloween! 🎃 💗 👻 p.s. love you and your videos you're AMAZING!!
Love tge attention to detail!
He's kind of a warm ass bitch lmao, please do more collabs!! :-D
I HAVE to try this for Halloween this year. Like I'm in love with your take on it. Whenever you were searching for the on Amazon what did you search? Because I've searched red/orange wigs and I they're all like waaaay to red or way to orange
Some advice for the freckles: dont mix eyeshadow with water ! The water will evaporate and leave powder which will move around and be dirty looking. (Trust me, i learned the hard way). Use a mixing liquid or setting spray instead.
Bishhhhh I’m shook!
I am a camera, I didn’t want to learn this truth
I love videos about people's BELONGINGS and ROOMS and SPACES. It is the most fascinating thing what everyone has, what connections people have to the things they own and how they arrange them. What crumpled receipts people have in their bags, and their favourite cuddly toys, and the things they keep as mementos. The things they can't throw away and the things that remind them of, say, 2007 specifically. The colours and light flow and the arrangement of furniture in people's rooms. How people organise the same stuff in a thousand different ways. What we consider necessary, or a part of our identity, or a tangible expression of some facet of ourselves. Anyway I want you to know that I own 20 plastic frogs.
YOURS WILL SOON BE NOT AS NICE
Dan. I would hands down date you. Like no joke.
Dan I can watch you do anything and love it, literally when I feel down I binge watch your videos and it immediately makes me feel better because you're so honest in every video, I love it ❤️
I mean you have 4 suits that you have worn so talk about being an adult 🤗
Yeh but is it even a Daniel J Layton video without the Harry Potter books in frame???
Not to be captain obvious but you take your dry cleaning to the dry cleaners.
Does anybody really know what dry cleaning is? A good place to go for dry cleaning is Timpsons, and they might be able to fix boots as well. Kill two birds with one stone. Potentially three birds with one stone, because there are Timpson branches at some supermarkets like Sainsbury's and Morrisons, so you can do food shopping as well.
this is one of my favourite “series” i guess idk i love the two videos you’ve made about this it helps so much.
Please make more of these. Mainly because I love the way you pronounce stuff.
Not knowing what dry cleaning is--too real.
Dry cleaning is a process of soaking in a chemical solvent rather than water. It's for fabrics that would degrade in water, or for pieces that are too delicate for a washing machine.
HAHAHAH the Janet posters even in ur uni halls.\nYou already knew who you were. I'm proud.
Did... did Dan go to Canada recently? He really didn't mention it much if he did ;)
Stoff
I have just cleaned the three mugs from my room. And I now have a clothes bench at the end of my bed. I will never really be an adult.
Well done for getting this far in it! (This is genuine and not sarcastic btw)
I'm 50 years old and still don't have the hang of 'adulting'.  Believe me, you are doing great!
I do this thing where I allow my room to get messier and messier and messier as my mind seems to do the same thing. Then when I've had enough of how messy my mind and my room is (usually when I can't walk around anymore and I am very angry) I will go through and clean everything. It is the most calming thing. It is a safe way to deal with anger, and I feel better inside and out. It's quite lovely.
I utterly understand everything said in this video, and its nice to know as an 18 year old female that people other than me enjoy cleaning...but where is the room tour tho.
Will you make a video of you building your desk like you did with dodie?
I do the same thing when I’m cleaning/tidying I’ll either put on headphones and listen to non lyrical music or YouTube videos (depending on my mood) and when it’s YouTube videos it definitely something to just listen to in the background and have a voice I can check in with at times, it’s SO nice and cathartic and I get to laugh if things are funny or just listen to someone go through their day/topic and it’s makes me feel accomplished and stuff, agreed. It’s great
I love this video! I clean my room late at night and listening to music and watch tv or movies, I love your videos and I relate to the stuff you talk about, I am Fan of your bakingwithlayton videos there amazing and I also love to bake.
having a film 'keeping you company' whilst cleaning is the best description i have ever heard - i do this at least 3 times a week (but normally with reruns of community or rick and morty)
My Mum asked me to take a dress to the dry cleaner once and was perplexed about why I seemed so stressed out by what seemed to her, a simple task. I had to go to the city, talk to the lady I mean... what do I ask for? Can I just be like, here's a dress do your thing? How much does it cost? Can I pick it up that day? That week? Whats the deal?\n\nIt's funny because I only did it that once and it was so stressful it was all kind of a blur so if I ever needs to do that again I'm back to square one I've got no idea.
where is your closet from? it is exacly what i've been looking for
bit echo-y innit. still great tho. still great.
But you forgot about room tour!!!
Ask google to find you a decent dry cleaners. You haul your stuff to them they work their magic and then you get it back clean pressed and on hangers. If you want your stuff starched make sure to ask. I liked a really stiff chefs coat back in the day. Like turn it sideways and it doesn't budge. I'd ask for hot press and triple starch. Then I wouldn't have to iron it as hard to keep that nice line. It shouldn't be too expensive either. I mean less than $20ish per suit. Usually they can do it super fast too.
M8 where are your fairy lights from? 😂. The really important question
Hm... with all of the stuff you still have, I'm not sure I'm convinced that you ever actually got rid of anything. Lol. Dan, at this rate you are going to end up on that show hoarders!
You're so right about spending all your money moving that you have none to actually decorate. I found this out when I moved to edinburgh and ended up buying two leather recliner sofas for £50 in total. They look like shit, but are comfy as hell. I also bought a wardrobe and chest of drawers for £40 in total as they were ex display. It is these kind of moments when I realise that I am truly an adult.
You should do some film recommendations 😻
I moved in august, the bedroom is a disaster (the rest isn't much better but that isn't my point). Soon very soon there will be bought another closet for the bedroom, so at least 40 % of the floor will reappear from under bags of towels, table cloths and bedding stuff - I hope.\nVedo is nice, I have missed these short interactions, like back in the old days where you challenges yourself to do a video every week :)
3:29 babe you could never turn me off.\n\n\nhahaha.\n\n\n\nlol.
Wow, I'm fairly confident that me and Dan shared the same student halls... and I can confirm they really are great!
OMG Tell me if you have figgured out the Dry Cleaning! I have a dedicated place in my bathroom where I hang my dresses for weddings... and they stay there, I buy new ones. I love the old ones... they need dry cleaning.... I don't even??? I am good at grown-up stuff (thats half a brag right there!) but Dry Cleaning is an actual mystery...
Wall of memes i love it
Dry cleaning is cleaning using regulated and toxic chemicals instead of water and its so expensive its not economical for anyone to have a private dry cleaning setup which is why you need to go to a storefront for it. Also water will shrink suit fabric which is why you need to do that.\n\nJust google dry cleaner near me, bring your suits, and maybe ask how much its gonna be and how long its gonna take.
I am moving house at the the moment, so I can feel this video really well.
I relate to this so much. I started uni 2 months ago and I'm still decorating my room!
Were you in Lincoln courts because that's where I am right now.
LEGIT HAVING THE EXACT SAME ADULT PROBLEMS. I have a coat and a dress that need to be drycleaned, plus a pair of boots that desperately need a fix. So please update us on when and how you solve these issues.
Your VEDO is my favorite VEDO, I could honestly listen to you talk about anything.
Been in my place for 11 years now.   Still not done.
This video was the perfect length for me to watch while I took off my make up. So THANKS DAN!
So excited for your vid on my birthday (25th october, pls give me a shoutout am too excited <3 )
I moved to uni a few weeks ago, and it took me about 3 days to put my polaroids up in my room. And oh mY GoD did it make a difference. Literally 15 tiny little photos from holidays, SitC, parties etc made my room instantly feel more like home. Today we printed a load of flat photos and hung them in our kitchen/dining area. It's crazy how much difference a few photos and fairy lights make
In the time between when I was 11 to 18 I moved house 9 times. The thing that mad my room my room was all my posters and drawings. Every house they moved with me and made it the new place a home.
As a kid I used to love going to the dry cleaners with my mum/dad. The front desk was at a level above my head but it had a sort of ledge on it that was child level. I thought they were the best place caus they remembered that little kids like to see the top of a front desks too. I was a very easy child to please 😁
Okay a little tip for the drycleaning suits. IT'S expensive. This is something a lot of professional instrumentalists do. They wait until it's really cold out, like freezing overnight and they just put their suits outside to get the smell of sweat out of their suits. Apparently this is supposed to work, don't ask me how, I'm a girl, but I've heard this so many times by different people. It's worth a try.
Talking about things being familiar and comforting, sitting in a new uni flat and just hearing your outtro makes me feel so much more comfortable in my own skin. Thanks for the video today Dan :)
Lucky, my uni doesn't allow me to hang pictures or posters on the wall, not even with Blu Tack. However, there's a huge corkboard along the wall, so my grandad undid a couple of the screws and that's where my pictures hang instead.
I started uni about a week ago and this helped me a lot :) thanks Dan
I legit want to do a big tidy now... I suppose that is procrastinating as I have SO many essays due in
This spoke to me. I feel like I am in exactly the same place as you. I love the chill clean up time!
Go to the dry cleaners for your suits And the cobbler for your boot.
‘How do you amass glasses in such a fashion’ *stares disappointedly at the piles of glasses and clothes scattered all over my war zone of a room*
I have your videos to keep me company while I'm doing my evening routine. :-)
clothes on clothes on clothes on clothes...... on a *chair* \n\nnever thought I'd relate so much <3
Lovely vid Dan, hope you're settling in well! I really enjoy your I'm just a normal person doing normal things with a sarcastic yet hopeful British attitude brand. It makes me feel like I'm not the only one, you know?
I love you Daniel J. Layton!! Xxx
I love that you guys live so close it really is like you're living in the Friends building because you have your friends close 😊
YOU'RE HAVING DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR
I love when YouTubers make videos of them just talking about life and doing everyday tasks like in Dodie's vid where she makes pasta and talks about her love life or now when Dan is just cleaning his room. It feels so personal and I feel at ease and so comfortable in this one sided conversation.
1:05 i now have defying gravity stuck in my head cheers daniel j
i cleared so much shit out of my childhood bedroom a couple of months ago and dear god CATHARSIS
Literally just stopped everything I was doing to watch this video I love all your videos Dan but these are my favourite just listening to you rambling is in a way comforting just feels like we are two friends hanging out and just talking xx
The not feeling settled and 'at home' until you've decorated it to make it your own personal safe space is SO TRUE. You discussed it in your August PMS too and all of the chaos of my mental state suddenly made sense: I recently moved to a new city for a year long work placement.. I'm living with people I barely know who know each other better, I'm away from friends who in the past two years of uni have become like family, and as a result am missing my beloved family more so than previous years away from home. We can't decorate our rooms, so I have large expanses of white walls surrounding me and whenever I'm in my room I never felt quite fully relaxed.. It's not MY space, it's no ones space and as such it feels like I've in turn rented my brain out to so many feelings that I can't nail down and think through freely. Thank you Dan for helping that fall into place, your videos are one thing that does feel homely (if that can be not a weird choice of word) and calm my racing brain xx
I have exactly zero suits, and I also do not know what dry cleaning is ;) sorcery!
I do the same but instead of tidy because effort, I alphabetise my dvd collection and when I say collection I mean I could single handily re open blockbusters
I'm just moved and THANK YOU. My house is like almost there now at about 2 months after the move in date.
@daniel J. Layton Can we start a patrion to get you money to buy a bookshelf because the books just sitting in the corners are killing me.
That was my room then I moved out from my parents and left it all because it didn't fit in my suitcase
I love your videos you are an inspiration <3
i love videos like this :))
free shirt when you're buying a suit
SUHNday
Your hope framing and focusing makes me feel relaxed

Omg I love your Harry Potter poster 💛
Lol dan is adorable
I'm enjoying you VEDO immensely! ^_^
Stoff stoff stoff stoff stoff
YES DAN
STOFF
Relatable
That Janet Jackson poster though
Yay, i got the first like.i love you're videos thank you for them i was just in a really bad place, exxellent timing\nDry cleaning is getting a person at a laundromat to do it
Wow I actually want to tidy now, thank you Dan I am going to tidy now
Even though I'm literally a teenager right now, I'm already pretty house-proud and 'Monica'. I have two things on my desk right now - both anthologies for uni - and then there is nothing else messy in my room.
It takes a talent to entertain people with the bare minimum. I mean, i've just watched 4 miutes of you folding clothes and it ended too soon. Looking forward to tomorrow's vid :)
Your gonna laugh but British Heart Foundation is great to cheap furniture.
Really not a fan of wire hangers. Hate to break it to you.
I am sitting in my uni room as a first year with the exact same Friends poster on my wall. Love that
Cleaning has become my relaxing thing as well, whenever my mental health gets a bit shaky and I feel like I can't achieve anything, I just do a bit of cleaning so I know I've got something done, it's lovely!
Cleaning is  so calming sometimes and I agree, cleaning with something like a movie playing in the background is so cathartic
I clean my room to procrastinate then procrastinate cleaning my room :/
I'm a hoarder too, I keep leaves and rocks and things, mostly paper from school... it's clogging up my room. there is stuff everywhere in my room... I am probably, sadly the 'typical teenager' who just hoards plastic bottles. plus I love your poster... 😁
Why is Chris dressed up as a Witch?
Chris, you really need to be re-diagnosed. You are not autistic, you were misdiagnosed because you didn't talk until age 7 which means you actually have Landau Kleffner syndrome.
is this her actual channel??? i just learned about Chris/Christian/Christine(?[also would that bear really appreciate the name change]) earlier today. this is wild.
this and narcissa wright prove that being trans is literally a mental illness.
can someone transcibe this, it was really hard to understand
Deprived of the pussy once again. His next sweetheart will be... THAT DEATH LIGHT!!!\n\nSee Chris & Death on CWCki.
he sounds exactly like the Monty Python guys playing old ladies
I'm working on it!
The bear has awoken from slumber.
Lol, I hope this is the beginning of the old yard raging Chris, this DUDE is funny!
0:23 He turned into sammyclassicsonicfan for a second.
0:59 - I do believe that might just be the last shred of Chris's sanity breaking there folks
M8, get a hold of your life. Probably move. I suggest you go move to the arctic circle.
Can somebody add subtitles? I can't make out half of this...
Hope we can see a happy Christine for a long period of time.
Chris is ageing like a fine wine.
He's taking after his mother.
I wonder if the people he went to school with saw this 🤔
Everytime I watch this it makes my day lol
This is a completely normal person no different from you or I.
IT'S LIKE LISTENING TO MICKEY MOUSE ON CRACK! I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!
lmao What Shrek character is this?
Just... Watching this again, my god, I don't think he's ever been this upset. Hilarious to watch with how deranged he is and the fluctuating pitch of his voice. \n\nStill, I stand by what I said earlier. He's never been this unhinged after a breakup before. Deteriorating vocabulary aside, you can't fake this kind of crazy. He really is genuinely upset. He really thought he had a good thing going here for real. If he wasn't so funny to listen to and watch here, I'd almost feel sorry for him.
Okay, around 0:11 I can only understand at least half of what he's saying. It's like he has the hysterics dialed up so high the knob came loose. \nEdit: Nevermind, I found the transcript on the CWCki.
OUR MASTERS GIVE US A CURSE-HAME-HA , WE ARE'T PURE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE SUCH A GIFT FOR  MASTER.
He sounds like a woman who just learned the man she thought was her child's father, wasn't the father at all.
HA HA HA HA HA! You fucking LOSER guy! Go kill yourself!
God..I think Chris is ready for the asylum.
WHEN WILL YOU LEARN \nWHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES
Would you do me? I'd do me
Cuz I'm not afraid to SHAHOW MY FANGZ
How did his voice get so high? what happend to the autistic casual voice we came to love?
chris his fault that he should never reveal to his sweet jessica
Anyone know what happened to the CWCki? The website has been down for a while, and now I don't know how to catch up on all of my Chris Chan related news. Can anyone point me in the direction of a new place to hear about his/her exploits?
Is this an enemy stand?
Is he just blaming us for something that probably had nothing to do with us
I wouldn't be surprised if he shat his pants again like did when sparing w/ Clyde Cash and Billy Mays on IRL. Dirty, Crapped, Briefs Part 2.
This does not even deserve a captains log introduction, *Takes glasses off* BECAUSE THIS IS DEAD SERIOUS
If there's one thing cartoons have taught me, it's that curses by crazy-sounding old women are serious business.
To think this was a guy.\nAnd autistic.\nMight be a good explanation for this... Video?
Chris sounds like he's jizzing for simply stretching his arms out to the camera.
this is the worst ronnie james dio song ever.
sometimes when I feel like a no hoper I remember that people like this exist somewhere
This is the Chris Chan we all know and-\n\nThis is the Chris Chan we all know!
This is your brain on autism.
Is it a man or a woman? He or she sounds like this crazy lady from the westboro baptist church!
Bad acting Christine, not worth the oscar
y'know sometimes i genuinely feel bad for CWC\n(s)he just doesnt know what this looks like to everyone else\n\nlike, sometimes you have a daydream where you suddenly get everything you've ever wanted and never have to do anything ever again. i know i've done that -- like what if you rubbed a fuckin lamp, a genie came out and suddenly you just had everything? that'd be great.\n\nthe difference between CWC and us is that we snap out of it and realize it's a dream.
Give this it an award
When is the apology video for the curse coming do you think?
This just reminds me of Brian's mother in Life of Brian.
Look's like classic  Chris is back ROFL.
Well I have a feeling that the trolls are returning
This reminds me of that Monty Python sketch that takes place in Happy Valley. You sound just like King Otto playing the Hammond Organ.
You don't need her. You're the creator of Sonichu for crying out loud. Who did she think she was to boss you around?
he literally looks like an old lady screaming
Was that supposed to be his best Marlin Brando impression?
Ah Chris Chan. It's nice to know that you haven't changed.
10 out of 10 performance, Shaman Chris
JULAAAAAAAAAY!!!
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET CHRIS TRAN
You crrrrrude crrrrittens!
uhh wow
0:55 He said 'Sofa King'.

Why doesn't CWC ever use a comb??
Whats happening now? Can somebody fill me in?
it makes me borderline depressed to think i'd probably just take one for the team and take his virginity
It deeply disturbs me knowing what kind of extreme mental pain Chris Chan probably goes through on a daily basis.
SJW: The Poster Boy\nThis is why you all deserve to be gassed you creepy estro-pervs.
Try to curse me now Fatass X'D https://youtu.be/xRBbiivz0aY
I want normal Chris back.
He looks like he's... drooping
I just had a thought. Is it possible that Chris has been playing a character all these years and we're actually the fools for believing it? What if Chris is the ultimate troll...that would make him a genius.
is this asmr
Weekend Woman debuted at #12 on the New Alternative 40 Chart this week:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGuUAtJ8yMM&index=12&list=PLxlSBzMcrtkMCVtuXEIz5BXpPfycTwsS5
Argentina is still waiting for Weezer!! =w=
Judging by that bridge, this is the song that should have been called Beach Boys.
Oh man, when are you guys gonna be in Australia?
New song is very cool. =w=
wow, finally, a good single
Where are the dirty and heavy guitars ??
tsst tsst ahh. Zombies - Time Of The Season
looking forward to the album, this time they,ve gone totally pop, but unlike previously, it seems to work
this sounds nothing like weezer to me. Still can't wait for the tour.
Burning Sun.. Love Green Album. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPdO4ruqUmY
I was there when they played this live and it was awesome
Weekend Woman is much more complete, as Burning Sun lacks a proper chorus, a middle-eight, or decent lyrics... but I can't help but feel that the verse melody goes much better with Burning Sun's propulsive, rocky arrangement than with Weekend Woman's slower, more sedate arrangement.\n\nStill, Weekend Woman is great, and it's interesting to see a song that originated in 2001 evolve into something totally different for its eventual release 16 years later. (For all Weezer's faults, they're a great band to follow if you're interested in the songwriting process.)
I like how all four of these songs sound different from each other, and yet, they are all awesome songs. I'm sure this will become one of Weezer's best albums.
Feels Like Summer, Mexican Fender, Weekend Woman = YES, GOOD.\nBeach Boys = *no*
This better get some radio play
Suddenly the sounds of the 60s bump my mind because of the tune of this song <3.
Sounds like a generic Gin Blossoms song from the mid 90's
I LOVE THIS TRACK!
Been listening to this song on repeat while I'm studying.
where's my hash pipe?
really love the new songs
Oh God this is my favorite off the album so far!!
Oh wow burning sun done over. Good song. This album has a nice rhythmic sound.
Much, much better than the previous 3 singles. Still scared for this album.
Wonderful verse, weak chorus and OK bridge.  6/10   I'd rather listen to the Green demo than this unfortunately.
This has a modern yet classic 60s pop sound. Between this and Weezer's recent use of the 50s chord progression in Go Away and Endless Bummer, they are bringing back great things. This really reminds me of Weezer combined with The Monkees new song She Makes Me Laugh (written by Rivers, of course.) Buying the new album at release.
Weezer is probably my favorite active band. I've really liked the past 2 albums and the first 2 releases from the new album are good just not as good as most of their past work. This song however sucks.
Best single they've released for the new album by far
this is actually good
Really good. I'm enjoying the change, especially from the White album.
Must be a big album
This song gets better with every listen. Can't get enough of it.
Not a bad track... the more I think about one of my top 10 Weezer tracks, “Eulogy for a Rock Band,” the more I think it’s about them and leaving rock music behind 😢
I stopped listening since after Maladroit... I think I might listen again :)
Melody sounds like it was lifted from an earlier B-side called Burning Sun.
I'm a Weezer fan..went on first Weezer cruise..this song is pretty lame..most of the recent releases have been lyrically pretty crappy..almost like Rivers lost his edge for writing good pop singles. The alliteration is great.
what a good song
he sounds like the dude that sang rude
still stucky in my head
Not 1 single mention of Mary Tyler Moore. Disappointed
sorry, but in my opinion this is not good...
I swear, when I first saw the title, I thought it was showing Wonder Woman, anyways, great song!
This is a really good song!
This video made me fart.
This is the only song I like off Pacific Daydream but still lower the Pop taste just a but please.
thought I was looking at the ocean man album cover from a distance
Best single so far.
is weezer going to hit the trifecta of 3 good albums in a row...\nman i dunno if i'm ready for this
The melody/harmonies and the arrangements are just beautiful <3
These new songs aren't bad. Not my jam though. This one is actually really good compared to the others though.
Use more vocal melodies and songs Rivers wrote from the 90s and we'll talk.
Best single from this album so far imo
For me this makes 4 great summer jams on this album so far. Very happy with how this is turning out.
Nice one!  \nSpecialy when this began: I still believe your beautiful lies
yes, if you're trying to figure out that youtube is an algorithm based on previous video views and snapshots of thumbnails, yes, it is true.
I feel like nobody brings up how creative these lyric videos are!
Much better than burning sun imo, this takes everything good from burning sun and enhances it, burning sun has the same problem that all Green songs have (i critique green for being solid but extremely safe and the songs follow a generic and identical formula)
Amazing to think that Rivers has been holding onto a melody this good for so long, unable to finish it until now. And now we've ended up with one of the absolute best modern Weezer tracks, with new lyrics and an incredible arrangement. I'm glad it's finally finished and out there, because this song is excellent.
Finally we got a good one
*My personal rankings so far*\n1. Feels Like Summer\n2. Mexican Fender\n3. Weekend Woman\n4. Beach Boys
O c t o b e r 2 7 t h
THIS SONG IS SO GOOD
New Weezer, Liam and Noel Gallagher album! What a time to be aline 💕

Booo make weezer suck again!
no
Damn.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Good job, Weezer!
Good
Burning Sun from Green Era almost exaclty.
<3
When did Weezer become another lifeless pop act?
Weezer is one of the best bands ever, with some of the worst fans ever.  So negative, always picking apart every note of every song, forever comparing everything they do to Blue or Pinkerton.  Where's the loyalty?  Where's the love?  Honestly, the worst Weezer song is better than nearly every song that gets played on the radio.  Stop complaining and give Weezer the credit they deserve.
I miss Weezer so much. Will they ever come back, or is fluffy beach stuff all they're going to churn out now?
SOUNDS LIKE BURNING SUN!
Even the B sides off the white album are better than this. Missing the rock sound.
This is a great Weez tune. Has a White vibe and Green vibe. Ranking high on my Weezer overplay list. The previous 3 were flimsy. This one's strong. 
is the Black Album, Pacific Daydream? Or is this just a separate Album?
Sigh. More overproduced pop rock from a beloved band with which I grew up. What happened? No band will always remain the same, but WHAT IS THIS?!? Where is the authenticity of Pinkerton? Where are the harder riffs?
More and more bullshit. Just retired already Weezer, you haven't had a decent album in 11 years!
Burning Sun?
RIP Bobby Heenan 1944-2017
I fucking love u Nerd

What happend to the Nintendo toaster
AVGN vs Funhaus
what about the throwable punchout snes game?
Dear AVGN, how do you review shitty games while wearing boxing gloves? Yours truly, ShukterhouseJive
Hell yea
AVGN for Jerma Rumble.
ALRIGHT BROUTHERS
Do interplay fallout 1-2
@Cinemassacre what about M.U.S.C.L.E.
Fuck yes!
Strongbad> Whut?
Fuck yes
Strong Bads sounds like a helluva gimmick
You forgot Tecmo World Wrestling.
Niiice
Saturday Night Slam Masters FTW
Reveiw Knight Rider PLEASE!!!!!!
Saturday Night Slam Masters was awesome
Diaherra dial
Not gonna lie the ring with the cartridges made me laugh, wish there was an LJN for him to piledrive, lol
This video was hilarious. I haven't laughed this hard in forever, keep up the good work James!
Am I the only one who tunes in just to watch AVGN's facial expressions and to listen to him swear and yell?
James looks like a member of the RTC
I am sorry to have to resort to Miller light
When will he appear on Did You Know Gaming? It's an insult NOT to have him.
Have you been lucky with the ad-pocalypse?
Damn. No N64 wrestling games reviewed? Missed opportunity. Some of those games are the GOATs of wrestling games. You can't beat No Mercy or WCW/NWO Revenge...
WWF Raw and Royal Rumble for Sega were the best wrestling games out there for that era. But Acclaim went to total shit the way they did it with Attitude and War Zone, and then turned around and raped Paul Heyman with those two jokes of ECW games that were made with the exact everything that was used to design Attitude.
Are we just gonna ignore the huge cartridge fight? That shit was awesome
Finally doing the Wrestling games! Plenty of bad wrestling games I bought and I still regret years later. I got my mom to buy WWF Steel Cage Challenge for fifty dollars even when the cashier begged me not to buy it. I regretted it within a week. \n\nBut WWF Royal Rumble and WWE Raw for SNES are still excellent games and I disagree with AVGN when he said they're bad games.
This deserves a like just for the intro.
I enjoyed royal rumble for the Super nintendo
Believe it or not, but FCI was actually once a part of Nintendo itself.
wwf on the nes isn't too bad
harvest moon: friends of mineral town review please !!!
Nice vid James. Had me laughing. I like that you've kept in the charm of your old videos.
I would want him to do a Crash Bandicoot episode where he starts off with the beginning to end of the franchise. Same thing with Spyro. He should also do a Mario Party episode as well.
I don't know, it seems AVGN is not the same as before. James has lost touch already
The best wrestling game on the NES was Tecmo World Wrestling.
Uh, wait a second, did I just watch an ad from the 80's? It was showcasing a product that removes the need to blow into the cartridge.
WHAT!!!! Miller Lite???!!! I thought I was watching AVGN! Hey pal, it's rolling rock OR NOTHING!!!
Strong bads?  Is THAT where the Homestar Runner guys got their ideas?
Strong Bads.\n\nWait, no Strong Bad reference? Come on, that would of been awesome!
Best wrestling game is Mat Mania, hands down.
Whatever, I'll pick Rick Flair *insert lame-ass version of Rick Flair's Woooo.*
would you be interested in playing gradius 3 for the nes??? it's a good game check it out I hope to see you play it keep doin what your doin bro brings out great memories from my child hood
You should’ve used the rolling rock cans for the intro XD
You should try the gameboy advance version of elf the movie if you do the mini vids on Christmas
Dear James -\nPLEASE GO ON THE YOUTUBE SHOW HOT ONES! 
pro wrestling was the shit STAR-MAN all day lol
Wait a minute... did The Brothers Chaps get the name Strong Bad from Tag Team Wrestling? Holy crap!
you can tell he didn't watch much wrestling
NES Pro Wrestling is still the best wrestling game,ever made.
Fucking slammasters, that's a 5 dollar lunch.
I liked the WWF games LJN made on the SNES
Too bad he didn't review WCW Backstage Assault
Is it weird I watched an ad during this video about fixing your NES \nHmmm
I wandered upon Wrestlemania the Arcade Game looking through a full romset for shit to play with my friend. It was way more fun than I had anticipated, and I ended up buying the cart. It's still no Street Fighter II, but it's fun enough.
super wrestlemania ewww. \nthat is equivalent to dessert bus to me or Dr.Jeckle \nI bought this game at K-Mart as a child and I thought it was going to be so cool. it was the biggest let down ever. I hate that fucking piece of shit.
I might've already suggested this but I think you should play Scooby Doo classic creep capers on N64. If you don't have it, I'll donate the piece of shit to you gladly.
Was that a real tattoo
Is this where Strong Bad from Homestar Runner comes from?
Oh god... he is losing his hair.  It is like the countdown to mortality for the rest of us.
Royal Rumble was the best game out of all these. Hours of replay value.
Ljn returns to fuck James once more
Capcom can even make wrestling games good, I remember in those rent a game days the only games left Friday night were those awful wrestling games nobody wanted, not even wrestling fans.
seems like you were only angry because you were looking for a fighting game, and playing a wrestling game.
Nerd deserves to have an Iron Sheik figure shoved up his ass for saying the LJN toys sucked...
Royal Rumble on the SNES was one of the best earliest wrestling games by far in quality, sound, and controls. Not sure if you really even played it because while Wrestlemania was pretty good, I would say Royal Rumble was just as good in it's own way, if not better.  Looks like you just wanted a Street Fighter Clone.
If you watch an episode of each season from start to finish you can magically watch James's hair line recede.
Nice to see another episode again so soon!
He's the nerd. The fucking Nerd.
Does anyone agree he should do a review on pac man 2 for snes and sega genesis that game sucked
Hey avgn please release avgn movie in portuguese (or with lyrics) im trying to see too much time and i cant
lol i remember the old avgn swearing a lot more
Did anyone see the sonic.exe cartridge
Why did I not subscribe yet? Also a jontron fan right here
The best wrestling game is the final boss battle in Donkey Kong 64.
Acclaim's N64 wrestling games were worse than the other wrestling games combined.
Snap into a slim jim
ride to hell retribution on the xbox 360
I say the AVGN does too many retro Nintendo games. He should do more games for the Sega master System.
Nerd still has that magic all these years later. Thank you for entertaining me.
Dear Gawd they've killed him! As God as my witness the nerd is broken in half!
Looks like Acclaim recycled more than a few parts of Mortal Kombat to make their games. Not a complaint though. It works.
Hulk always wore that golden cross necklace is why its that
Come on WWF raw was not that bad for the snes. It's really the only wrestling game that was good until N64
For the record you have to hold down and A to pin the opponent on Wrestlemania, but you have to be standing close to where their chest is.  It's difficult, but that game is still a classic.
These games are as bad as MONDAYS!
who does he think he is, jesus fucking christ?!
angry video game nerd I have a game that is very hard and some people call it a peace of shit game its preaty new its called undertale its for the computer its a game you can get on steam and also my dad has the super man game for the nintendo 64 I hid it in my closet so we don't have to see it ever agen
Fun Fact: Tag Team Wrestling is where Strong Bad came from on Homestar Runner
NERD!!! NERD NERD NERD!!!! This is urgent!!! You must review the Shrek games!! Almost every single one of them is so so bad that you must review them and play them!!! Please accept this request!!!
No. 800! Whoo-hoo!!
Hitting a guy here is like trying to hit a grain of sand with a tennis racket while Andre The Giant farts in your nose 😂
In case you plan to breastfeed you are also not supposed to used retinol when nursing :(
I love Tartelette palette 🎨 so stunning. Very similar colours to Too Faced Chocolate 🍫 palette👌🏻
Awwww beautiful glowing mamma :). Don't cry I know it's not easy but it won't be long now. If you love a full on mascara I'm loving the douche I think it's called from birch box shop. I got a mini one in a box ages ago and it's stunning !!. Really fluffy lashes and zero fallout. And I own about 20 mascaras . Looking forward to your whats in my hospital bag video lol x
What does retinol actually do??

Okay, am I the only one that that when she was talking about the Clinique Pep-Start range actually thought she was saying Pet-Start?? 😂 I was thrown off for a sec ( why the heck would Clinique be starting a pet range??). Maybe just me, yeah? We shall see.....😂  BTW your videos are consistently great Fleur stay fabulous! ❤️
Have u tried Bobbi Brown Eye Opening Mascara, suuuuper volume n long lasting! Wovzers was so impressed x x x
I’m not a girl but I wear makeup and I like acting like a girl! Awesome video and I love the tarte palette!
Really interested in seeing a review of that Lancôme stick foundation!
So is this the old formula? And it's only available in the USA? It's a little different name, SPF 21, and shade range is different from the U.K.  I wear 110 in the one available in the USA but that's a shade too dark. Here is the link to the USA one I'm referring to (please someone let me know if this is different from the new UK release!!). https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face/foundation/teint-idole-ultra-longwear-foundation-stick/3605971343964.html
looking really glowy Fleur! Pregnancy looks great on you:) X
Loved this video Fleur, you look absolutely glowing, pregnancy is really suiting you! I can't wait to get my hands on those serums! xx
Hi Fleur.. Love your makeup look in this video.. Do a tutorial maybe? :)
Clinique skincare is a hit IF you find the right product for your skin type. I have super dry skin (not dehydrated) and Moisture Surge Intense Skin Fortifying Hydrator for a moisturizer and All About Eyes Rich or Repairwear Anti-Gravity Eye Lift Cream for the eye area are my favorite skincare products that I've tried from the brand. I like the Dermalogica balm cleanser 10x more than Clinique's since it's in a tube and it doesn't make my vision insanely blurry like Clinique's does when I take off my eye makeup. There have been some definite misses in Clinique for me as well but the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief is my ride or die moisturizer for when my skin is at its absolute driest and tightest so I would highly suggest that if you have dry/dry combo/very dry skin.
have been expecting for this video for so long!!! love your new launches video Fleur!
Ahhh I love your reviews! You’re quick, honest and hilarious. Excited about the ouai spray and that toasted palette- I love tarte.
Did you know the Estee box is sold out?
Could we have a best candles / Reed diffusers video. Not the Xmas candles, just a general one. Thanks
love the video - as always!! :)\nwhat about the new hourglass holiday palette? you didn't mention it in september either..
Your under eye concealer has looked very cakey in your last few videos - what is it? 😳
You look great in this video Fleur!!! Thanks for bringing me up to date! Lancome stick foundation seems great! Would love a more thorough review on it!
Aw, the beauty box isn't sold in the US, but all the other Estee Lauder companies pink products are :(
Remember when trying these new products out Fleur, that you are taking prenatal vitamins which are full of so much nourishment. That can contribute to your hair being so wonderful right now. Happened to me darn it.
That Tarte palette looks so frickin' amazing! Please do a tutorial on it x x
Hi Fleur! Since it's breast cancer awareness month, I would really love to see what you think of MÊME cosmetics, which are supposed to be formulated for women who are fighting cancer!
The Estée Lauder box is still in stock on the Clinique website!
Wow I want to try all of it! And you know me and my obsession with Tarte! ❤️Lol 😆
Always love these videos! Where are your earings from Fleur? They're lovely
your voice is the best i have ever listened to :-)
I was so happy when I discovered the Ordinary! I cannot afford fancy serums but I swear the Ordinary serums have seriously changed my skin!
Gutted to have missed out on that Breast Cancer box!!
I have yet to try The Ordinary, but the serums look promising. These overview videos are really so helpful!
Always wanted to try some Ouai products! I love the sound of them and the package is gorgeous! Definitely going to pick up some of the new ordinary stuff! I'm obsessed xox
Fleur- what are your thoughts on the new Charlotte Tilburry pallet?
Hi There Guys! This Is Awesome! I Got 𝔽𝕣𝕖𝕖 $𝟚𝟝𝟘 𝕀𝕥𝕦𝕟𝕖𝕤 ℂ𝕠𝕕𝕖𝕤 Here – >  #Claimanygiftcardfrofree
that tarte palette looks amazing! I'll have to check it out, it does look more wearable than the naked heat palette
Hope you can make a Drugstore Makeup 💄 video next. All ur videos are mostly high street and high end. 😔 thanks!
Your face is radiant as usual, Fleur. Can't wait to see how the baby will look like. It's going to have a face like a flower or like the sun. Cute!
Are you using all products during pregnancy? Or have you changed anything in your routine?
The ester lauder box is already sold out. Boo!
Well that's my Christmas list sorted! Thanks FleurB. Hope you're well x
Your hair looks incredible, I definitely need to try those Ouai products!
Your videos are ALWAYS informative and fantastic!!!  P.S. Pregnancy looks great on you!! XOX
Hi Fleur, today in France, we're celebrating everyone named Fleur so happy name's day , happy Fleur's day 🎉😘 tc !
What nail polish are you wearing? 😍
Hi Fleur I really enjoyed the October update so many interesting new things. I'd love to know which of the Ouai shampoos you used and enjoyed I was about to take the plunge. Also I had read about the smoothing product you mentioned but haven't been able to find in the UK so thrilled it may now be available.
Hi fleur are you wearing maternity wear? Could you do a video on maternity wear?
Smashbox has sold out of the charity boxes on your link but Bobby Brown still has some in stock :-)
Love your top ooh new products
Your hair in this video is amazing!!!!
that brown sparkly shade in the tarte palette STRESSES ME OUT hahahah IMAGINE THE FALL OUT
The toasted looks amazing and supporting a good cause, I always love
I never realised you still made YT videos! I’ve missed them; I used to watch you way back in the day! Hey girl!
Hi Fleur, what did you think of the new Chanel perfume- Gabrielle? X
I love what you're wearing Fleur! Where is it from and can you get it non maternity? It's so cute 😊 Love your videos and hope you're enjoying your pregnancy. Can't wait for #babydeforce
You look so beautiful you are glowing 🤗😍
Love that box for breast cancer! Great idea. Another great video, Fleur :)
Love these videos Fleur, really respect your opinion and appreciate work you put in to research and try all these products out x
Fleur whats wrong with your undereye concealer, it doesnt look as good as always. Have you used another one ?
This is my favorite series of yours!
Love watching an intelligent woman with good vocabulary playing with beautiful frivolous stuff  I'm 36 and get a headache from the omg babes channels lol .. I love that you try enough of the things to give an opinion rather than just a basic show what's out xxx
Love these types of videos! Do you have any recommendations for liquid eye liner? I’m on the hunt for something new because my favourite one has been discontinued. Also, waterproof would be an amazing plus ❤️
So happy to see your video Fleur! I am in love with the Tartlette palette and the Erborian mask I'll definitely look into. (Before this vid, here I was trying to whittle down my makeup stash for some while 😂)
Love it all and you are lovely! xoxo
Love these 'new i beauty' videos☺️
Awesome idea for the breast cancer box 💕and looking forward to trying the new Ordinary serums!
Lovely choices as always, Fleur. :) Hope you're feeling well ; before you know it your Favorite Beautiful Lead Item of All Time will be ... *Baby DeForce.* :D
I am so sad the toasted palette isn’t out yet 😩 it looks amazing
I'm not loving that UD mascara either.  The Perversion mascara is one of my favorite from them, though!
The tarte palette is so beautiful😭
I am definitely going to pick up the Tarte  palette. Curious about the Eborian mask since I enjoy their BB cream. The bubble mask looks fun! What would you compare the Clinique  overnight lip balm to? Oh my gosh! Nooo replica! I adore their fragrances & I don't need to because they are pricy but that one sounds good. Beach Walk is my all time favorite scent. It's pretty much been my signature scent for the past couple of years. Hope you're having a lovely week. Hugs, Summer xo
I'm so excited and ready for the tarteltte toasted pallete 😍😍😍
i have to look for that beauty box for breast cancer, that's nice! i will look for and try the clinique double bubble mask is available in the US for $24.50
My favourite and what I look forward to most are your Vlogtober and Vlogmas vlogs. I, of course, totally understand why you are not doing them but I am still a little heartbroken. Hopefully next year.
Gutted that the breast cancer beauty box is sold out. Is it a one off or do they come back in stock?
It's a shame that the Estee Lauder box sold out in minutes! Would have liked one....
no shops in the UK stocks tarte make up !!!;( if anyone things i'm wrong and know the place pleat let me know!!!!) there is one place like a pharmacy and let's say for tarte eyeshadow palette charges like 149 pounds!!!????🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🙄
Wear us your top from?!
Urghhh the breast cancer box is sold out. My mum just finished treatment a few months ago and would have loved it! Hoping they'll restock
The tarte palette looks so good but idk where to buy it from in the uk
Does Tarte ship to the UK ? Or how else can we get this palette?
did anybody misunderstand fleur saying sweat proof as 'sex proof'??
Are you a male to female transgender? Born a man?
Love your hair Fleur. The new growth looks so heathy and shiny. Natural color looks so flattering.
Your explanation of hair memory :) haha.
Loved this new-in-beauty video as always!  You always give great reviews/first impressions
Hi Fleur! Question! Where/How do you get Tarte in the UK?! Thanks for answering love! ❤

I'm feeling pretty constipated
I'm watching this on the toilet
scared to crap now
People spend a lot of time on the toilet because they want to finish that video on their phones. Does anyone else watch YouTube on the toilet?
I'm pooping right now
when you run out of ideas for a video
indians use water...
Why did I want to know this
the harappan civilization was the first civilization to invent and use flush toilet...\nuse missed the fact @infographics
We all all know if your on the toilet for 10 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaco Bell is the blame
A good amount of people are watching this on the toilet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop watching this video and wipe already, you're gonna get a numb leg.
I'm pooping right now!
I'm watching this while taking a crap👍
I've seen squat toilets when searching videos, it's pretty weird looking.
1 time a day is to much for me lol
I once used the squat toilet in Kenya. easy for pooping and uncomfortable for the knees
Alexander Cumming
Pee: I'm gonna make some lemonade\nPoop: Gotta unload the mud
I spend like 5 hours a day in the bathroom
u running out of ideas boi
Never Thought This Vid Would Come Out 0-0
I live in South Africa 🇿🇦
The way you say poop is amazing...
Who's watching this in the toilet...
Dam I don't feel to to poop when there is an anaconda in the toilet
Oh no I clogged the toilet
i watch this while i'm pooping😱
Have you ever ate a cheeseburger while taking a dump?
I just dropped the kids off at he pool
Why...............
Drop the kids off at the pool xD
Actually the Squat toilet is available and used in Iraq.
so you mean that girls poop too? D:\n\n\n\n\noh wait, they are also humans, my mum lied to me...
Perfect i am shiting right now
Why did I clicked on this video
I was going to make a joke but it’s kinda crappy.
The videos require a lot of work, I'm surprised that the channel promises a 3 videos a week now!
I am watching this video as im pooping! XD!
What, who drinks 8 cups of water a day? 4 is fine unless you're working out. Or unless they count the water you take from food, than I would understand. But no needs to drink that much water a day.
Does anyone know what software they use to make the infographics?
this video is very shitty
Too much fun with the 30 second intro
Why am İ watching this?
I feel disgusted 🤢 I wonder why and I watching wait what am I doing with my life 🤔 Ehh This is my opinion I'm not hating on this but Let's Just finish this video.
That's definitely not average weight
I honestly don't go in with my phone or newspaper when I go in the bathroom because it doesn't take long to come out. Why do people do this?
Please do  if NASA had a 1 trillion dollar budget 
I’ve always pooped once a day, always in the morning. But I took a biology class at my community college, and was totally shamed by everyone telling me they poop after every meal. (That’s why restaurants are required to have restrooms.)
Are you ALREADY running out of ideas?????
What a crappy video\n\n\n\nNot really only for a joke
Yo do a vid on North Korea vs China
Wow u make great content i really enjoy watching ur vids u earned a subscriber!
I poo about 5-7 times a day as i have ibs and ibd 💩👌
You've clearly​ never met a 100 lb girl who likes Chipotle 💩💣
Why is this in my recomended? And it is in the Entertainment Section ._.
Dahell? poop once a day? im more like once a week.
We had sit down toilets until 2012
The Infographics Show can u make a video of differences in American and European food... i  mean why US food is so trash packed with chemicals and EU food is better ? :)
Now we are asking real questions.
Think about it. In the future the kids will be even more depressed and stressed because they will have to learn more history. Because things that happen after we go to school....and they will have to study it.

Who else is picking up their shit and eating it?
Sorry to be “that guy”, but I think that last fact of how many litres over your lifetime is off by a factor of 1000. 51,000,000 litres divided by the number of days in 80 years (around 26,000) is still 2000 litres. I think you meant 2000 millilitres?
Now that I've been eating healthier I've been pooping 3'xs a day. It's literally impossible to gain weight!
We brits dont call that a toilet roll.\nToilet roll and toilet paper are synonymous.

Who told squat toilet doesn't have any flush mechanisms?? It has everything a western toilet has except it's squat toilet. And ya squat toilets are also found in india as it originated from here

I love that song. That is the vest song inn the world
My children are a gift- TO ME!\n- Todd in the Shadows, 2k16
This song doesn't take advantage of his incredible voice. He tries too hard in this song to appeal to the gen pop, so...meh.
Finally, a Lukas Graham song that doesn't reek of ego and actually sounds decent.
This song makes me want to drop everything and travel the world. ;w;
Whether it be a MLP song, I haven't heard Lukas' voice in a while 😞👌. Keep that talent up 👍🔥
oh my god .. it's beautiful, so amazing.. very, very good.. congratulations.
Out of all in the Movie this one really stuck to me, anyone else?
Awesome love it and way to go on this song it's awesome and love it so much going to get it soon
The song that played in the trailers and TV spots.

good song but why is there so bad quality sound but in movie not? sound is distorted here.?

I've been to China myself, but I never had Xi An food over there, and I still want to keep going to explore every regional Chinese cuisine I have yet to try, and authentic Chinese culture. 😭 I think we could use your on true authentic Chinese food soon!
Any advice on what to order at the only Hunan/szechuan province restaurant that serves mostly Americanized crap, is overpriced, and has Mexicans working in the kitchen?
mY H O M E (⊙‿⊙✿)
Aww thanks for the reference to halah food it just makes it easier when visiting
Oh man that's sexy
YOUR STOMACH IS A BOTTOMLESS PIT MIKE
Mike You should go back to Xi an for a food tour filming!
Wow all looks amazing
I am definitely team red too 😋
hah! You're still rocking that Vancouver T Shirt!   YES!!!!
For me, these dishes have too much starch overall, on the other hand I like starchy foods, but I would rather not gain weight.
Damn bruh, not even the hot oil could save you. That's a sad day lol
If you have never tried biang biang before, your noodle life is not complete! Lol! I agree! 😁
What is that iconic xi an cold noodle dish called again?
FoodNetwork needs to give you a show...I could watch you eat Chinese food all day long 😂 love your videos!!
Love the videos, would it be possible to add a list of the foods featured for their spelling? There aren't many authentic places near me, so when I'm out of the city I like to try out new items, but find it hard to remember what to look for, especially when the menu is poorly translated or translated very vaguely.
Can you visit Chicago? It has a Chinatown and I want to know what restaurants to visits.
that intro song is sick... reminded me of my X.
How old are you Mike?
Your hind leg is rising up DID NO ONE CATCH THAT?\nWe are bipedal mammals we don't have hind legs b o i
baby in background at 11:50 was crying in step with the music in background lol
your hind leg is rising up  -- priceless! That pao mo looked great btw.
Thanks for telling what is halal and can you pls mention wether the food is halal or not in your future videos pls
Hey Mikey you should come back Xi'an and give us a tour of what it's like and all of your child hood foods that aren't served here in the US
I'll have to research good Xi'an places here in Vancouver. It seems like my kind of food!!!
I'm from 西安 as well and I loveeeee ur videos. It reminds me about home every time when I hear you speak mandarin with a bit of the xian dialect. Pepper soup is my favourite food and  vinegar complete my life. Got u fam.
Xi'an is Chang'an ? \n\nThe city of Empress Wu ?
I can only watch your videos when I'm eating because I get so hungry watching you
You can have love without marriage and you can have marriage without love.
I recognized this place immediately! When I was in La I went here with my family. How cool.
I've gone to the same plaza many times, but I've never seen that restaraunt lol
Never end a video in a low note
i feel fat watching this
YO\nI LIVE IN THAT AREA
Next thing u know the white pepper is salt
I am glad that Xi'an Garden is pretty authentic. \n\nMy girlfiend and I love that place!
You always like everything. How much they pay you?
Mike-e you are the best ! I live an hour from Los Angeles, and i'm going to try to visit the first place you went to in honor of you. I will show my waiter the foods and hopefully they will be able to bring me those, just how you had them. Keep keeping on. Much Support from a happy mother of four, that looks at your videos on her free time.
Mike you should come to Bangladesh. You would love the cuisine here.
Come to malaysia when raya fest i show you how malaysian eat
for the 200 of you guys that dislike this video ... you all dont know good food when you see it ..
I love you Mikey, but please stop sticking your chopsticks in your bowls! 😂
COME TO THE FLINDERSTREET CAFE!!!!!!!!
Great videos Mikey!  I especially liked your visit to Shirokiya in the Ala Moana Shopping Center...my favorite stop.  Next time you're in town, you gotta try their Kulu Kulu custard filled pastry....onolicious!  Thanks for the tours!  Aloha!
The food looks so good that I actually got chills while watching it!😁😌
Those steamed noodles in the second place sound right up my alley.
Mark Wiens has a million subscribers; and the Food Ranger just reached one million subscribers.  Time to get this channel to one million subscribers as well.   It would be dope if you would do a collaboration with the Both of them.  I think it would definitely get you over that million mark.
You're in my area!
How sad, disepointed, destroyed, mad, upset, lifethretendly hart broken would he have been if there would have been western broccoli in the soup.
BUT WHEN IS MIKE ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO CHINA
That place is 28 miles from my house. Guess where I'm going Saturday. Thanks
I just moved from LA to Little Fort, Canada and I'm already missing the food
try the kitchen sink at fair oaks pharmacy in south pasadena east of los angeles!
@13:35 No stuffed sneezes so your not full!
The noodles are my favorite
No buddy cares if you go round  their restaurant
Loved your videos. Keep it up. You are a legendary eater food lover
if this is your random free day, when do you ever have a real free day? 😂 thanks for entertaining us with your videos!
aww at the baby crying soooo cute
Anyone know what the places are called
I miss Xi'an food so much after this vedio
Makes me miss China already.
Love your honest reviews, thanks for keeping it real! You da best Mike!
You would like more pork on the back of your bun???  9:00
Making this video available in Colorado where nothing close to Xian food is available, is a crime
Get out of LA wtf!!!    Find something with ambience and class.    You are losing it bub!!!!
Your hind leg is rising up LOL
I'm hungry, i want to eat
Those gooey noodles look amazing....wish I knew how to cook something like that
Spicy means burning butt when on the toilet 🚽
I do the same thing whenever I eat food from my country, especially specialized regional and provincial cuisine..
U should go New Orleans and go to try the special number 2 which is from Orchards Ramen restaurant.
That is not soup, its jello.
please try Filipino foods...  :)   love your videos...  the secret taste of every food I eat!!!!  stay cool!!!
Mike, make a Live Stream 🤤
Oh my god, I miss the food
this channel always makes me hungry
Hot oyul
Never have Xian food. Looks delicious!
Your making me hungry

 Happy bite , happy life - Mike Chen
他們殺死無辜者，殺死我們的孩子，我們怎樣不能捍衛自己，摧毀俄羅斯呢，永遠終結呢？
Come on Mike, you're an American. Your hometown in somewhere in the MidWest. Xi'an is NOT your hometown, damn it!
I'm upset kodak ain't in diss but dis still dope😩❤
Where Kodak, oh wait he in court
It must be hard recording under the water tho....
Why does everyone care so much about Kodak? He raped a fucking minor, I wouldn't want to associate with someone like that and put them in my music video either. A boogie did the right thing
I'm over here running outta breath watching it n shit 😂😂😂
Song still slaps, but where was Kodak
this video is so satisfying
He whack for dis ... How da Fuk u not gonna have Kodak on there
I really appreciate how this music video is. The effects are amazing and the visuals are fantastic. For a rapper in this new generation, this music video is excellent as the other videos made by most rappers are fucking stupid and lazy. This is one of the best music videos I've seen by 2017. Nice fucking work bro keep it up cause this is excellent
Ok but where's Kodak???
I jus know this gona be a hit...
Who watch this in October 11?
https://youtu.be/jYEIOXe8SGE\n\nThe new era of Brooklyn has begun now

I almost drowned and then i thought of this song
I love this song 😍
Milking it some more like xo tour llif3
He cut Kodak blacks part out probably cause he on house arrest lmafooo
This music video is fucking dope
This ain’t hip hop. Honestly, how difficult could it be to do what this nigga doing?

I want to see the behind the scenes for this video
Check out my new hit Top Drop by zay Holiday https://youtu.be/_5sWW0QWmfk

Uhhhhhhmmmmmm... WHERES KODACK BLACK!!!! He's the best part
Didn’t think this song needed a music video... I was wrong 🔥
Why would you throw a fine looking piano in the water hmm?
Who else was gettin ready to jam to Kodak before we realized he drowned
I love how they put thought into this video and there was an actually story line so I don’t get bored
Ohhhh I get it it's because he's black (this is a joke)
I'm tryna figure out if he is under water or naught
So now niggas are signing underwater after Harvey hit??

Shouldn’t he be dead now?
Hmmmmm the song is lit but the vid is f*cking 😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟

I have met Emre before! No noke. I went to Liverpool v Arsenal 4. March 2017. The day after I took a train from Liverpool to London. I met him on the train, he's a really Nice guy btw!
Do one with Coutinho. I like this series as release a new hip hop quiz with Sturridge, Gomez and Ox. It'll be funny.
Mo salah
emre send a message to bayern lol
seems like he is happy with the players he play with in Loverpool....
Picking most from Bayern doesn't mean he's leaving for Bayern.Stop the stupid rumors.
Coutinho and Gerrard... Well DUH!
Bayern semua kebanyakan
love
Algum brasileiro q gosta do Liverpool e assiste esse canal?
Make him sign the contract and do not let him leave the room. Lol
He's just being honest. He named most Bayern players because he used to play with them and even know them in person. Indeed Bayern Munich is top 5 team in Europe so it all make sense.
This guy is a former Bayern player. It's no surprise that half of the team are Bayern players
Yes,we are living in Ronaldo & Messi era.We must be proud of it.
And he's leaving in the summer ... Total shame to the board if he leaves
he want to bayern :) bitch
Not biased at all.
RB Philip lahm yes great banta can 😀😀😀😂😂😂 nah but being serious it will be bad to see him leave he seems so nice 👍
Jurgen is going to Bayern so is Emre Can.
Choses an ex Liverpool player and a player who wants to leave Liverpool great side🤣🤣🤣
To many Bayern players in my opinion
he just want is bayern move to be done soon
I thought this was Emre Can's dream team not the bayern starting XI
Can your one of my favourite midfielder
He has chosen players from four clubs only, namely:\n1) Bayern\n2) Liverpool\n3) Barcelona\n4) Real Madrid\nAre those his favorite clubs?
Bro he should just said Bayern
literally just a bayern team
In other words- Bayern
Let him go dony need him i always sell him on fifa and get loen..saul ... kimmch or renato
Mignolet no goals in should surely be ahead of Neuer.
liverpool have to buy carlos lampe, bolivia goalkeeper
Looks like Emre is pushing for a move to Munich 😂😂😂
maybe a move to bayern?
People complain about Emre choosing so many Bayern players, but keep in mind, they are all some of the best in the world in their respective positions. I totally understand him.
Just gonna take a wild guess here, he wants a bayern move?
Damn. That's a good team.
This shows can have his heart on Bayern m
Frank could have been better but still good
So basically, Emre Can is joining Bayern Munich for free in the summer.
Stop making him to videos and make him sign the contract lol
Half of the players are from Bayern Munich
That would be a beast team, and suits, the big beast himself emre
He just picked all the best players
Hope he signs new contract
That is one hell of an awesome midfield Emre, glad to see you know what you're talking about.
this is just a German/Bayern hybrid
Please sign a new contract Emre!!!
KLAVAN is god. One of the best defenders in the world. He’s strong powerful great tackle. He is a proper leader and legend
Although it's mostly bayern players n players he play with it's a pretty good team☺
Stevie G providing to Ron and Messi...just imagine 😍😍
Sounds like he wants to come back to Bayern
when did he play with ramos?
I think he likes Bayern
I love you ❤️ can \nOne of the best players in the premier league
Never mind who he picks, sign a contract and focus on the games.
I'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm going for…\nI'm…
He would like to sign for Bayern??
Lowkey emre wants to be in bayern again
Does Can just love Bayern, or does he just love Bayern. I think he just loves Bayern.
I guessed everyone but ramos
So all bayern munich players are in his dream team and his Liverpool teammates. I can understand GK position and forward but all other guys 😧😧😧
Clearly can is a Munich fan
I think Emre is eyeing a move to Bayern....
Title is misleading, It should be Emre Can's favourite Bayern Players and some other players as well. 😂
shame on defender lfc
Bayern Munich!
No Toni Kroos?
Where is ox
Sign new contract!
Where's Rickie Lambert?
Too many Bayern
Sign the fucking contract.
Emre can 😳
Mostly FC Bayern players!
Coutinho the best
https://youtu.be/Z5fEVzpNzcs
*Emre Can selects the Bayern Munich XI
No lovren or matip?? Really??
Too many bayern plyr
No lord bendtner 😥😥😥🙄
Go play for Bayern jeez
To many Bayern Players
Not lovren as CB? Wtf
Where is Moreno??!!

Job application to Bayern?
#KloppOut

Steven Gerrard forever
RENUEVEN A EMRE HIJOS DE SU PUTA MADRE. GIVE HIM  A NEW CONTRACT  MADAFAKAS
Wie er Bayern in den Arsch kriecht.
All the ringtones sound like very bad bagpipes I love it! I remember having one of these!\n\n\nAnd omfg! I feel old and I'm only 17! I get the Dom Joly reference!😂
I remember my first phone I was around 7/8 and it was a lime green phone (can't remember the company) and I thought It was so cool because it had a screen bigger then my mum's blackberry and the keyboard popped out the side.
Emma you got so far but then you killed your hair again
The ringtones are so horrendous! My ears are bleeding 😭😭
Belive it or not these devices are in heavy use today, no not in some worn torn part of the world but good old blighty. They are used as burner phones by drug dealers.
i am lAUGHING SO HARD AT THE INTRO AHAHHA LOVE YOU
i love you emma!!
The chat feature is just like the messages app, but it's organized in a way like a chatbox where you can see replies in one screen, unlike the messages which displays messages inbox style like mail. But the chat feature back in 3310 was such a hassle to use and it eats up so much load.
Love the sonic youth t shirt, your hair looks really nice lately too. I remember when my parents had those phones, I used to steal them to play the games lol
Nobody got nostalgic because they thought you were a hipster with your dad's ringtone...
I met her little sister at school today
Emma, I had no idea you lived in Brighton! Maybe I’ll bump into you one day
When I was using the old nokia phones it was a normal thing that they've sent you a message with your balance after a phonecall :D Also it's called Snake 2 because Snake was on the previous mode, the 3210.
do a filming with my first camera !!!
Emma's like a London dealer now
Just buy a Nokia and ring it a couple of times - That was like the most comfortable I've ever seen someone say something like that around a parent ever to the point where I felt awkward :P
I appreciate​ the Zelda reference in the description
my first phone was a firefly omg
My god this was my first phone too
Your Dad absolutely cracks me up - I love your videos with him, and your relationship with him :)
Emma I love u but...\nI'm so sorry. Ur eyebrows bother me.
Omfg, John has the same phone cover as my mum
Sure I've watched a buzz feed video with the exact same idea \n\nNOT HATING \n\njust saying what I've observed \n\nGREAT VIDEO THOUGH
Answer to your question do we need smart phones   NO!! \nSmart Phones get smarter and the user get dumber \nYou should upgrade to the Nokia 3330, it had internet connection. ( Really I did)
Do we need smartphones? Absolutely not! But we use them because they are very handy 😃
turns out to be a nokia\nedit:called it
Yesterday I saw Emma live at the guides big gig, she was amazing!
I have a nexus 4 I don't use... don't project yourself on everyone else just look around not as many people as you think are glued to a phone...
I'm actually considering getting rid of my smartphone for as long as I feel like. Going back to the old nokia flipphone
You were really good at the big gig!!
anyone know the music at 0:08 ?
Merry Xmas has been in my head ever since this video😂
I acc love your new style of videos
the chat function was like threaded messages. like, one message thread with one person.
GO TO LONDON ON WEDNESDAY, IM GOING WITH MY CLASS XD
I had three games and I didn't even understand one of them
Please does ANYONE know where Emma's denim jacket is from?? 😍😍😍
My mum had that phone and i was so jealous
What?! I am 16! And I had that phone on my elementary school😂😂
....is this entire video a satire?
That is the same ring tone that was on the Satellite phone that was in Jurassic Park III  and was found in Dinosaur poo.
Emma dancing around and playing the Nokia ringtone was really adorable
wow I remember this sound 0:00
I'm travelling around Vietnam and I hear that ringtone everyday! Ps where's your jacket from?
did anyone not get a notif for this vid?
I used to own the Nokia 3310 as well.  You can knock someone out with it.
I'm late to this video, but omg that ringtone takes me back!
now you can do a full gameplay of snaek\n\ntwo
1:52 yes emma that is the iphone 8. No difference. So instead of giving you a real iphone 8 they gave you a phone with the exact equal functions
You where amazing at big gig
awww i remember my first phone, one of those nokias too. i hated it but like, it did work damn well
I saw you at the big gig, and you were absolutely great!!!! <3
I want to be in the early 2000's because that's when emo was more popular.
Yessssss you're chilling in Brighton Emma what a g
Hey Emma blackery I saw you live today at big gig and OMG I was one of my only people out of my pack who knew you! I love you Emma!
In a couple years i should use my iPhone 5 like when im twenty something
that ringtone is the sound my washing machine makes
You did amazing the big big today I loved all your songs
idk why but the beginning reminds me so much of jacksfilms..i like it :D
I love this video
All these years hearing that same ringtone and I had no idea my dad had the Nokia ringtone
The first phone I ever had! I was 9 years old when I got it . This is so entertaining!
I wear I thought your dad in the background of the bank scene was totally going to call you after you just said you didn't want to set it off!
Hey emma\nI love your videos \nI saw you at the big gig\nit was amazing\nyours was  my favourite performance :)
Regular Snake was in the 3210. That was my SECOND phone. My first phone, when I was 13, was a brick like Motorola. I can't remember the model name but man was it solid. lol. I don't think I ever owned a 3310... But to be fair it was a loooong time ago. sigh.\nYou should have played the Nokia ringtone and done a Trigger Happy: ie, shouted HELLOOO?? lollol
That was also my first phone, that remembered me so much of my childhood and I'm only 16 XD
My first phone ever was a Dancall HP 2731.\nMy second phone was a Nokia 3210.
General \nSilence \nDiscreet \n\nAh yes the three genders
I m going to see her at the big gig
I hope you didn't drop it by mistake...
this is completely unrelated to the video but where's your jacket from it's so cute
Did anybody else think that whilst she was talking about not setting off the phone in the bank that her dad on his phone in the background was gonna ring her? \n\nI’d have found that hilarious.
My first phone was nokia 5110. Damn that was at my 6th grade lol first year hs when i got a 3310. Snake and space impact ftw
My first phonebwas in 1998 and i got the Motorola Startac. Flip phone and it pre-dated these, was first phone to have text messaging. Had a green screen and the sim card was the size of a credit card.
I don't know why I was excited when Emma was doing the unboxing part
The auld Lang syne tune genuinely sounds like the bagpipes up here in Scotland on new year 😂
The sad thing about this is that the phone that is your FIRST PHONE is the most up to date phone my grandad has ever owned
I wounder why her daddy loves her, shes got a charming personality.
I called it that it would be a nokia
I wanted to see old phone not new one\nEdit: NeVeRmInD
Hey emma blackery i know that you were at the girlguides concert! Believe it or not yesterday you made my first concert l just lit up it was the best time of my life thank you
/i was just wondering, are you thinking of releasing some new merchandise? i was going to order some but idk whether to wait for new merch or if that will be a long time in the future?
Omg u sounded amazing at the big gig!!!!
Hope u see this emma. You were great at the big gig and i loved your performance i cant believe you got to meet caspar lee!!!! I hope you enjoyed it yourself love ya x
aol instant messager. which I believe will be dying soon.
chat was sort of like BBM messenger. It used sms not data (or enhanced SMS as they called it)
Seriously ? No one knows? or is it just a clickbait?\nChat is the same as SMS. The idea was to make replying texts a lot easier than just using reply function. You can just write it at the textbox instead. Meh, I also never use it back in the old days.
14:10 lol

Al Jazeera the terrorist group?
America's own Terrorism,but refuse to call it that.. They said they needed motive and the rest of the facts. REALLY!
Thanks hats1976,yes I'm a multi millionaire lawful citizen, with 3000 guns,I would like to attend all that I can
Bruh if u have 42 guns u got a problem bruh
400 pounds up 30 floors, disables security, and fire alarms, removes 800 pounds of hurricane proof windows, reigns fire for 5-10 minutes, WITH NO MOTIVE, yup government did this
This is very tragic, so is what's happening in Rosemont Illinois, with the young black lady that was found in the Crown Plaza hotel freezer, but no coverage on that,,,,,Smdh
Itsashley doesn't get it because she is a Democrat.
Anyone else think that was a belt-fed gun military grade and there's no way this guy could have done that sounds like he's a patsy for some big psyop operation
FAKE NEWS RELEASE THE HOTEL VIDEOS OF THE SHOOTER BRINGING ALL THOSE GUNS IN THE HOTEL OR THE SHOOTER WITH ALL THOSE SUIT BAGS 23 GUNS SMH IT DONT MAKING SENSE
Visit the channel if you want to access the straight path.\nvisit this channel to listen to Holy Quran the last book from the God!!to humanity.\nVisit the channel if you want to reach happiness and comfort ! In this life and the Hereafter.
Paddock was VERY wealthy. Did Paddock sell his SOUL to the DEVIL to have everything he ever wanted, in exchange for this violent act?
Chris rock was right!   whatever happened to crazy ? He had no motive except crazy!  I wish they'd stop mentioning scumbags name.
Y'all a little slow over there?
What if when he booked that hotel, he saw all the people and thats where he got the idea in the first place.
That's creepy, I was just at the Life Is Beautiful Festival last week and noticed people watching the festivities from the tall condo building.
Never giving up my second amendment tho
AlJaazera im Disappointed in You Guys ,Im going back to RT
There are more the two shooters!!!! Show the countless videos with two distinct and different distance gun shots.  False flag for gun grab.
No one is talking about the woman who warned them they were going to die that night weird?
The only way to stop these shootings from happening again is common sense gun control.
This is domestic terrorism but the media won't call him a terrorist.
This is unacceptable let's drop some bombs on Afghanistan and teach them a lesson!!
What about the flashing lights on the 12th floor?? Plenty of videos showing it
Sin city
Will you let them rest my god. I'm sick of hearing about this. None of the news networks care about the people who died all they want is ratings and to exploit and profit from their deaths.
He wanted to be on the fbi most wanted list, like dad  who betrayed him and his family bank robbing
she very old woman she .my grandma just 55year's old she is 64..she is from Philippines..??
Notice the reporters head is perfectly covering the shot out windows? But why?
Why aren't reporters asking, why he chose a venue full of T🤡rump supporters, red necks and nationalist??? As he obviously didn't attack the other concerts full of hippies, minorities and gays!
BUMP-STOCK, bump-stock !! not quite so sexy .  IT'S A START !
more media bullshit, trying to take our minds off other questions...
This was far worse than September 11th, because it was no way an attack on government, but pure murder.
Go back to bed America. You are free to do as we tell you. -- BH
Yearly 30.000 Americans get killed by guns. More than in 44 European countries combined. The US also has the highest Infant mortality rate of all modern industry countries. America can be proud !!  👍
Government planned the attack.
This could be like that movie shooter ! Gov set uo
No rime or reason to this madness. Whatever his motives were he took along with him.
He wasn't alone in that hotel room. Media is hush about this
There's no shortage of conspiracy fuckwits posting in the comments. Sad.
Weapons aren't the problem. There is very manipulative, smart, evil people out there who will go through any means necessary to kill a large amount of people for no real reason at all.. Most people who do mass shootings like this are patient and they plan ahead, if we were to SOMEHOW stop EVERYONE from getting hands on a automatic rifle then these crazy people will just learn how to make Bombs to kill people instead. Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\n\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.
That is pretty weird that multi millionaire would go on a shooting spree so randomly
Excuse me but I need to puke!! 😷 This makes me very sick.
NO! The CIA did
What a time to live in.
How sad! My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims. I knew some people and celebrities who attended the Life Is Beautiful Music Festival. Scary to think what he may have had planned for that Music Festival.
The type of people who used to rant about Pizza Gate now have a lot of theories about the Vegas shooting.
I think there was more than one shooter. Always will
Comments on videos like this remind how stupid so many people are
On 4chan weeks before the shooting an anonymous person warned against a big attack in Las Vegas. This man is a patsy. No motive because he wasn't motivated. He somehow carried 20 guns into a hotel room by himself. Many say there were two shooters. He was probably a gun runner and got used as a patsy, killed before the shooting ever took place. Look it up.
This title is annoying😂😂
A.J., be the first network to demand the hotel security video footage, of him loading up the room with 20 AR modified full auto rifles.  and the entire 2 hour before- during -after hallway cam, on 32nd floor.  You could gain credibility as a network. simply demand the footage, till they turn it over.
I live in Las Vegas it's was not only one shooter and why the news not showing or tell the people that there are 3 windows busted out on different floors
Something definitely seems fishy about all of this. This has inside job written all over it
Why is a terrorist news channel trending ? Just more proof that Youtube is completely biased towards Democrat causes and fakes the whole trending thing. It's not an algorithm, it's the extreme leftists at Youtube manipulating views, likes and your perceptions.
No but his brother did.
God forbid but imagine if he had a Gernade launcher or other explosives
I'm still waiting on the footage of him checking in the hotel and walking around the casino to see if he had with anybody else (accomplice) with him.. there's no way he could have done this completely on his own
Sad to say... This topic will blow over in 2 weeks and we'll be talking about the kardashians again
Ha funny
she's lying
Western world hates women.
Government set up
Al jazeera is ISIS propaganda
Scripted.....
Madsteven
FALSE FLAG wake up America
Yes He did
omg...
Catalonia\nPalestine\nScotland\nKosovo\nKurdistan
She knew.
Sin City style
😔😔
🏴
Yeah,yeah,yeah
la la muchi la la muchi midnight
Nobody died , no body cried 🐧
Multiple shooters
Al jazeere trending wtf
Bullshit news
FALSE FLAG
🚫BAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!\nBAN ALL BUMP STOCKS NOW!🚫
*PSYOP*
What happened in real was an FBI weapon deal with ISIS went wrong, Isis found out paddocks with the government and decided to either take him hostage and carry out the shooting or killed him and carried out the shooting...wondering why they not releasing cctvs of the casino.? Imagine if the public find out that it was an FBI -ISIS weapon deal gone wrong. SO now that paddock is killed he became the suspect for a while until the videos of multiple shooters came out. WAKE UP PEOPLE
So the killer was 'white'. Hope you know that Trump.
Gun control..
Stupid whites always doing mass shootings
a 64 yearold man didnt carry 20k rounds of ammo and weapons up to his floor. plus one of his mental issues where from mk ultra. how i know? because various peoole who have been put threw it also had same issues.
Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist
americans who support owning automatic  weapon - seem to have the wisdom of a conesnail
White guy killing white people.  No problem.   Great news.
Where in the world can you find mass shooting become a regular occurence? Almost all shooters were white. But no one blamed their white families. Now you have a white shooter with a non-american, non-white girlfriend who is on the other side of the world when it happened and yet her photo is everywhere like she was the one holding the gun. Hmm.. something is NOT right.
Why was she stacking her belongings on top of her as if she were moving, as reported by her neighbors
if we don’t change gun regulation laws. this will only get worse.
stop referring to this terrorist as the gunman he is a terrorist say it a radical white terrorists
White policeman's jobs and not hard you're never in danger. When all your job is to do is shoot down black people you're not human
Such great jihad will take place in the next three weeks, and within a year, there will be at least five times, Pado, the great hero! Great holy warrior! Heaven has your place!
wait! Isn't Al Jazera the terrorists main channel for getting their message out? Why is this allowed on YouTube?
Way to good statement I know philipinos don't talk the way that lawyer talked
Chance the rapper concert??all he does is help others tho!!
Why is there even a thumbs down button on the comments? Somebody... please explain???
Kevin looked st that scale like it was the electricity bill
Hey pussy are you still there? - Popeyes
kevin lost a extra half pound of water.. he will gas out now lol... lets go el cucuy snap down city round 4
Let's GO Ferguson ;).
Tony Gonna Crrruuuuush Kevin Lee's drained out ass
Tony already won the fight, u can tell. Beating the scale was prob harder than it will be tomorrow.
Look at his face he looks dead!!
El Cucuy going to whoop that ass. No homo
i think the scale was a lil bit off, think they just needa go straight digital rather than that oldschool hand shit cuz he went from 156 to 154.5 idk about that
Motherfucker you missed the deadline.  You lucky they gave you an hour.   Wont matter.   Tony is nice and hydrated.   Enjoy the ass whoopin
TEAM LEE!!!
Awesome. Good job Kevin :D.
Talk shit all you want but respect his dedication, dudes round plump ass isn't even seen here he cut so damn much
Its not that hard to make weight.. its part of our job and i always make weight johnny the rock hendricks
Kevin knew he wasn’t going to make it the first time. Read his body language, he put up the act. Weak ass. AND DOWN GOES KEVIN. Fake ass Mcgregor wannabe.
Ferguson looks like he had a terrible weight cut.
Lol they were wiping some of the grease out his hair to make weight.
Ferg looked very comfortable ,i hope that  young man stays Fit  against ferg
Whats that red dot on Lee Pectoral?
Why are these fuckers still using an old ass weight scale that was probably built by Adam and Eve.  It's 2017 people.....Geeeeeze!
Cover your ass bitch ! this is a conservative country
I'm a Kevin Lee fan but man he just doesn't look so good at the weigh in
(Eventually) you get a second chance i title fights. Come on stop making it a big deal
you guys hear the predator in the beginning
Tony probably had a tough cut too judging from his reaction to making the weight.
Are you sure he was 156..? It only took you a full minute to figure out the fucking weight...
The way the title is worded makes it seem as if Ferguson was the one with the issue.
EPIC TRILOGY IN THE MAKING \n\nMARK MY WORDS GUYS
Tony makes it look easy JS
For those who missed my predictions on the UFC channel, i recommend betting on Lee. I'm dropping a couple hundred on it. And DJ is the obvious choice in the other main event. Borg has too many wins by decision and he isn't winning that way against DJ. I could see Lewis potentially KOing Werdum in the first round but if it goes past the first, Werdum wins. I would bet on Werdum.
Gj Lee but man you looked drained.  Gonna be a tough one tomorrow
U don't play with the scale and double check triple check when somones on weight . It's quick , he missed weight both times
Why don't they use like electronic weighting scales?
lets go tony fergusson kill this bitchh u are the man
Ha haa Kevin Lee showing his black ass walking back!!
Tony going to knock the got a.isu outta Kevin 😂😂
men ! i feel so fucking sorry for these fighters doing this shit everytime Really ,
Kevin looks drained....
' fuck luck ' love that comment
Lol Kevin Lee ass exposed
Weight-Cuts are bullshit
Kevin bouta lose
Nice lol
He looks very drained
Kevin will win
Lee cuts a lot of weight,he walks around at 190 lbs
Tiramisu outta Kevin lee
Untill when the the new weight classes????? UFC fucks fighters health with this brutal weight cuts.
Hahaha wtf?! GAY KEVIN LEE forgot to remove buttplug before weigh ins 😂 you can see it poking out when he was walks off after first attempt. That's a big buttplug 😳
Kevin FTW all day sorry peoples =)
Fuck that old bald white guy controlling the scale
Pay Attention To The Little Bumps On Kevin’s Stomach You Also See Those On Canelos, Jon Jones and bodybuilders
I don't know what I would do . My sack itself is 10 lbs .. move up a weight class ???
Damn he is too skinny. Cutting weight sucks. Missed it by a pound. My guess he'll shave his head and sit in the sauna for 40 minutes
That weigh in guy must take some serious under the table money....
Kevin is one sexy mixed race man
All the stupid people are talking about weight cuts and how horrible they are but they forget it's the fighters that choose to cut all that weight. No one told them to, they just want all the advantages they can get or in some cases minimize their disadvantages. Dumbfucks!
If he didn't make the weight you know ferguson would be fighting Connor for the real belt
Lmao told ya'll he would get beat cos he struggled with the cut😂
Making weight is such a stupid useless and gross primitive practice. I hate watching these guys and girls look all sucked in just to make some fucking dumb arbitrary number that means fuck all
Why dont they just use normal weighing scales that tell you the weight instantly, fucking idiots.
Missed weight fix title
Nice ass
Kevin will embarrassed Connor if they fought
WTF is up with the guy doing the scale? It's 155 right?   Why would he even ask? That'\ns not his job and it doesn't affect anything. He's just supposed to read off what the scale says.
Tony is going to get stopped in his tracks and realize a couple of things

Sorry Woody, im not gonna follow on this... i miss Woody Allen acting, i like the neurotic Woody, not this.
I will sit with some of those authentic people (now much older) and really enjoy this one very personally!!!
Love me some Juno Temple. I dig that she’s recently been doing period pieces.
Somebody was watching The Toy just recently, lol.
hmm.. we at #woodyallenretro are somewhat skeptical but are keeping a open mind... has potential
Watch it because of Paulie Walnuts and Bobby Bacala, also Belushi as semi Tony Soprano.
*_I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS!_*
Am I the only one who gets “A Streetcar named Desire” vibes?
DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It's written and directed by Woody Allen an alleged molester who married his stepdaughter. He is disgusting and I strongly advise you refrain from giving him money. The fact Amazon is parading around his name in the trailer is just wrong. Just don't.
I'm just passing by, and when I sell my movie script I'll be back here thanking you guys
So many movies with the word Wonder this year.
Sub to my channel I'll subbed to you comment when done.
Anyone know the swingy song that plays at like 0:09? Lol.
I shall be a getting a subscription this month or whenever the release date is confirmed.
This looks like a play.
Who else thought the title said wonder woman?
2017 (Year of Wonder):\nWonder Woman\nProfessor Marston and the Wonder Woman\nWonder Wheel\nWonder
This looks like it could be a lot of fun
well great now I've got wonderwall stuck in my head
Any way, here's Wonder Wheel
“Miss, you can’t be out here. We’re expecting lighting storms.” \n\n*proceeds to place a fucking makeshift lightning rod over her head*\n\n00:30
This has a soap-opera feel to it.  Hopefully that's just the trailer.

DiD hE KIss YoU?
Is this a Wes Anderson movie
I watched it without sound, because I'm at work. Can anyone tell me what the plot is, haha.
Awesome! The long awaited sequel to the Toy. Can't wait!!!
This feels like an SNL skit.  Not sure if that’s promising or damning.
This looks like a bad one.
Hey there my friend, I am Skylar Fuhrmeister and I make lifestyle, beauty, fashion and more here on Youtube and would love if you would watch my recent video all about halloween https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkAQcAE0060 maybe more!
I dont trust any Woody Allen movie unless there is underage incest.  I feel he is too much out of his wheelhouse.
Woody Allen and Kate Winslet take Oscar together
What is this? This is not Oasis? Alert me when you have decided to make it. Thanks

Watch Justin and Kate singing together!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcXXr7LWZKg
Yes Kate, but replace Justin with Leo.
1:19 is that a wand ?
You still got it woody Allen as sad Amazon studios is making more original stuff than Hollywood studios out there.
Early word is positive for this movie
I would only see it if Woody Allen was crucified on the Wonder Wheel.
Visually nice but doesn’t seem all that great of a story to me.
Woody Allen and Bill Cosby are two men cut from the same cloth. Despicable creatures who should not be allowed to work
No Justin Noooo why'd you work with this creep? 🤦🏼‍♀️

I miss you Chester.... 😢😢
Chester, you'll be my legend, R.I.P
Missing Chester's voice like fuck
And why linkin park kill suicide :(
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡ much love and healing sent
I miss you, Chester.\nLove you :(
We all miss you Chester, always remember the people and fans who love you. We will never forget you and your music.
I thought it said Cannot help you. Now the lyrics completely changed my vision of the song.
We all do Chester
For chester please keep silence for 1 mins \nI miss u so much chester I think I'm crying
Wanna kill yourself? Imagine this. You come home from school one day. You’ve had yet another horrible day. You’re just ready to give up. So you go to your room, close the door, and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over You take out those razor blades, and cut for the very last time. You grab that bottle of pills and take them all. Laying down, holding the letter to your chest, you close your eyes for the very last time. A few hours later, your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready. You don’t answer, so he walks in. All he sees is you laying on your bed, so he thinks you’re asleep. He tells your mom this. Your mom goes to your room to wake you up. She notices something is odd. She grabs the paper in your hand and reads it. Sobbing, she tries to wake you up. She’s screaming your name. Your brother, so confused, runs to go tell Dad that “Mommy is crying nd brother won’t wake up.” Your dad runs to your room. He looks at your mom, crying, holding the letter to her chest, sitting next to your lifeless body. It hits him, what’s going on, and he screams. He screams and throws something at the wall. And then, falling to his knees, he starts to cry. Your mom crawls over to him, and they sit there, holding each other, crying. The next day at college , there’s an announcement. The principal tells everyone about your suicide. It takes a few seconds for it to sink in, and once it does, everyone goes silent. Everyone blames themselves. Your teachers think they were too hard on you. Those mean popular girls, they think of all the things they’ve said to you. That boy that used to tease you and call you names, he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how good you really are. Your ex girlfriend, the one that you told everything to, that broke up with you.. she can’t handle it. she breaks down and starts crying, and blames herself . Your friends? They’re sobbing too, wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong, wishing they could have helped you before it was too late. And your best friend? He’s in shock. He can’t believe it. He knew what you were going through, but he never thought it would get that bad… Bad enough for you to end it. He can’t cry, He can’t feel anything. He stands up, walks out of the classroom, and just sinks to the floor. Shaking, screaming, but no tears coming out. It’s a few days later, at your funeral. The whole town came. Everyone knew you, that boy with the bright smile and bubbly personality. The one that was always there for them, the shoulder to cry on. Lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you, there were a lot. Everyone’s crying, your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself, he’s too young. Your parents just said you died. It hurts him, a lot. You were his big brother , you were supposed to always be there for him. Your best friend, he stays strong through the entire service, but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground,he just loses it. He cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days. It’s two years later. Your teachers all quit their job. Those mean girls have eating disorders now. That boy that used to tease you cuts himself. Your ex girlfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with boys . Your friends all go into depression. Your best friend? He tried to kill himself. He didn’t succeed like you did, but He tried…your brother? He finally found out the truth about your death. He self harms, he cries at night, he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide. Your parents? Their marriage fell apart. Your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death. Your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day. People care. You may not think so, but they do. Your choices don’t just affect you. They affect everyone. Don’t end your life, you have so much to live for. Things can’t get better if you give up. I’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk, no matter who you are. Even if we’ve NEVER talked before, I’m here for you. Copy and paste this as your status to show people there are people out there that care.let's see who actually read all of it.\nFor anyone that feels this way \nCould 1 friend, please copy and repost (not share)? We are trying to demonstrate that someone's always listening
Girl at 0:33 is beautiful
Chester's the one death on this planet i'll never get over . - . it still saddens me knowing he's gone.
This song was his goodbye, sad to think about.
Thinking about Chester being gone still hurts my heart so much. It's still so hard to listen to LP's music right now. This was a lovely video though, props to everyone who helped make it.
I cried... This band has changed my life and the paths I will take. Death is fundamental for life, and he has changed the thought of death for me. Rest in peace Chester
I know it is been said by many already but Rest In Peace Chester. Thank you, Chester for the artistic brilliance you shared while you were alive! Society's outcasts need heroes, thanks again.  . . . And Nu Metal for life, Nu Metal is life?
why Chester why did you have to leave us:'(

I like how you guys missing him now, when he is alive you don't give a fuck to him.
Where we can find you chester😢

Killing yourself does not end your pain... it just gives it to someone else...

I cant stop crying 😭 this song is so sweet and sad
The person who once showed us the light, is now the only light inside us, and that light will never go out. #RIPChester

Chester Bennington is not dead. his soul is in all our hearts.\nhail Chester Bennington🤘😢\nhail Chris cornell🤘😢\nhail sound garden🤘😢\nhail linkin park🤘😢
The like dislike ratio is incredibly good
You'll always be remembered Chester!
Why does everyone in the comments write R.I.P Chester.\nChester made this song for Chris his Bestie. He would be more happy if you all write R.I.P Chester and Chris.\nChester you made this song for your friend then why did you die😭😭😩😩😥. He wouldn't be happy about this at all because you had your life which was happy and contentful. Chris would have never liked it if you would have died for him. Also everybody please 🙏🙏🙏🙏 Think atleast 10 times how would others think if you die. Think about your mother who had kept you 9 months in her stomach.
everyone who dislike this is an asshole \nits so sad and so wonderful wyh should someone dislike this😪
Care i do... I did... Thats the saddest part.
R.I.P Chester Bennington you were a great singer and nice guy anyway I'll  miss you 💔😢😭

Who cares if one more light goes out?Well, we do! Goodbye, Chester!
I've never matched apple and blackberry...I can't wait to try it!!
To all continental Europeans who can't get treacle: I like to use sirop de Liège (boiled down fruit juice, dates, apples and pears I think) or really dark brown muscovado sugar or dates soaked in water and blended up. If someone has another idea, please tell me! \nPs: Golden Syrup is Grafschafter Goldsaft to my fellow Germans :)
Honestly I just would like 2 likes that's all:)
Just got back from visiting the UK: I got C+D cupcakes, they were sooo good!
Everybody's good at cooking something and I'm good at cooking crumble \n\nI've got one in the oven would you like some?
I love your videosssssss>>>>
Blackberry icing sounds amazing! Need to make it!
juicy little fillas
Tasty
Loving this recipe! X
Why on earth would a person (2 people) dislike this vid?
Planing to make ur AMAZING Oreo cupcakes
Hi Jemma do u always use selfraisng flour for cupcakes and plain flour for big cakes?
Jesus Christ I missed your recipes
Oh my!  These look fantastic!  😋
you're amazing Jemma
good i wanna make them
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do you know how to make mashmallow fulff buttercream frosting
Yummmmmmmy😋🌸👍🏻
*Unique gifts*\n*New Year gifts*\n*https://www.etsy.com/shop/MagicWorldWorld*
fruitcake, hehe ;-) - it's the sugar, Jemma
Yummy
love you Jemma
Yum 😋
MashAllah
Love from India
36th, love your chanel
There are perfect for autumn !
Looks so good... combining all those different textures must make it dreamy 😍 but... how on earth do you stay so slim and beautiful with all those sweets? 😂 Please do tell your secret!
Hey Jem! What do you think about using mulberries instead of blackberries? :O
Could you come up with a lemon and lavender cupcake please. Also the blackberry cupcake looks amazing.
Hi Jemma, how do you find the Kenwood mixer compared to the Kitchen aid?
Hello, can anyone help me pls! How shud I store cupcakes (for a party) after baking and frosting them if I live in a tropical country? Thanks!
Your videos always make me hungry...no matter what time it is hahaha xx
This cupcake decoration is gorgeous and the cupcake sponge is really awesome
I am going to have a go of making the Apple & Blackberry Cupcakes they look lovely .
What about the blackberry goo? You did not use it at the end
These look incredible, and so tasty. I love to bake and this video gave me loads of cool ideas for where flavor can be infused, but theses are so fiddly. This why bakeries like yours exist! Happy to buy these from pros like you, lol.
you looked so sexy when you are baking something
Omg 😍😍😍 I need these in my life
In the southeastern US blackberries are ripe in late June-early July.
I love your shows
Hi Jemma could please do a video on how to make macron's or if you've already made it please send a link
Lovely recipe Jemma. Cannot wait to try it. Looking forward to your video next week!
Thanks so much - now I know what I will bake at christmas for my family. Better start practising :D I I love your videos. Really happy I found you when this channel started. Ist still the best cupcake-channel out there :)
Can I use raisins instead of BlackBerry
You're everything right with YouTube.
I thought treacle and molasses were the same thing?
They look delicious and right up my alley.
I was just craving for some apple crumble!
Does your mixer have light on it?! Oh my goodness..I need that!
Jemma has sacrificed her thumb to the baking gods! This means we will have good bakes for a brief moment until the next sacrifice by someone else!
OMG those are gorgeous and I bet they taste AMAZING. Totally want to make these!!
Looks yummy! Owww on the thumb--I'm always grating my fingertips, so I know how you feel. I have to try putting apple and blackberry together--don't know why it never occurred to me before.
Hello how would you make that recipe in to vegan
Think this one will be as popular in our house as the jammy dodger one, fruit crumble cupcakes winner winner. Thank You Jemma.
Hi Jemma! Thanks for all your videos, they're great inspiration for me. I wanted to ask you whether you could do a basics series. That would be awesome. Thanks again.
These look so yummy! And the potato ricer trick is inspired!
Why the hell is Jemma so underrated
I think that the quality of the video is not as good as before
You know she's a pro because her mixer has a ring light
Poor thumb! \nI feel a little better about slicing my hand with a French mandolin now. Not by much because it hurt like a mother. But a little.
Hi Jemma! I am a huge fan, I recently started a small baking business and you are an inspiration. I am always surprised by your flavor combinations and I have tried dozens of your recipes, they always turn out splendidly! Thank you!
These look yummy! I've never mixed apples and blackberries before so I will definitely give it a go..\nBut I have a question: instead of apple, could I use raspberries or other berries for this recipe or do they have to much water? I'm a little worried that I would squeeze out all the flavour (I hope it makes sense because I'm not that good in English)
Is there an American alternative for golden syrup that isn't corn syrup?
good job need to try someday
hi jemma I like apple and i love your cupcake
I love love love this yesss, so beautiful and I bet it taste AMAZING. never thought about blackberries and apples!
Gemma cupcake do you have any recipe with fresh pomegranate or maybe custard apples please
I'm having a shitty day, Jemma. Hearing your voice and watching you bake brings me joy. Thanks for being you.
What a brilliant idea to use a potato ricer!
these videos get me through the week !! thanks jemma for your baking creativity and expertise ♡☆
JEMMA THIS IS TRENDING IM SHOOK. also this look so so so yum
I won’t lie, a ring light on the arm of a stand mixer seems like the most extra, ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen, that’s probably a huge improvement on user friendliness.
Can someone convert the ingredients for me in US metrics?:)
I love your straight forward approach and quick format!  Keep on baking!
(Silently cursing why I live 1 continent away from C&D).. This looks sooo amazing, I want 1 RIGHT NOW!!
My favourite dessert in cupcake form! 😱 x
Hey jemma, you didn't state the quantity of flour in your cupcakes in the description box.
I visited your shop on Saturday, and I was so happy to see all the cupcakes! Thanks so much for such a great experience😘
Gemma!!!! Please make an amazing coffee cupcake!!!! I beg you!!!!!!
IM NEVER THIS EARLY CAN I GET LIKES NOW?!!?😮\n\n\nno.😑\n\n(I'm kidding... this never happens and i need dem likes guys😕)
hi Jemma i just wanna ask if you can also feature on how to make a french macarons..=)
It took me longer than i care to admit, to realise that it wasn't a siren that was going off in every video, it was Jemma opening the oven!
Yum! The compote filling is such a lovely addition.
I love your top! Where is it from?
Do you think this recipe could work with peaches and blueberries?
That’s looking delicious! Will give it a try👍🏻
Did anyone else think the pink buttercream looked like ham?
Hey Jemma.  How do you stop all the fruit sinking to the bottom
Jemma I heard recently that you don’t do apple picking in the uk, and I am devastated for you. But.. do you have apple cider donuts? Because that’s the best part of apple picking, the apple cider donuts. \nWhat I’m saying is you should make a video on apple cider donuts. 😊
Hey Jemma, love your vids. I know you love using tea infusions. Please try using Rooibos tea. South African product, it's life changing.
How could I make this vegan?
Hi , if I don't have a potato riser what can I use or do? Thanks
I reckon it would be a great cupcake Jemma but too much work for me. I might make the cakes and ice them with a caramel buttercream ( your recipe of course). I love your channel. And your carrot cake is THE BEST.
Omg yummmmm!!! I never would have thought of that combo with the apple and blackberries 😲💯😍👐👏🎉
All these added sugar is bad for your health please keep that in mind when consuming such creations
Hi jemma im going to visit your shop tomorrow in london. Im soo excited!😍 Gonna buy some cakes
Will it make a blackberry hater like me like them?
Aww Dina. This is soo genuine. Love it 💕
I really love your videos. It gives me Muslim vibes u know😂 and that's good bc I don't really have that much Muslim things in my life. I really love you and sid and Hannah.
Remember Dina it’s them who need you You don’t need to go these events as much as we as audience would love to see the content , but we follow you for you not because you got fancy Nancy events , well ni harm in going to the ones you feel good about and have someone to enjoy with . 😘
You did the right thing sister.  #1 mum to you dear ♡♡
totally know how you feel. you are feelings are justified :)
Love this honest content. It's refreshing to see how someone handles the stress of internet based entrepreneurial business in reality. Especially in relation to how it can all affect your mental health. This was hands down the best vid. Great to see your efforts and progress and to hear your honest experience! #realest
I am in Afghanistan so I haven't been watching a lot of YouTube but I am so excited for when I get back for all these goodies on sid and dina's channels!!
may Allah guide u ameen
I totally understand the whole anxiety when attending an event solo. It's something I really struggle with too as I have social anxiety. Plus events are always naturally more fun when accompanied by someone you know and feel comfortable with. :)
Hey Dina i tooootally understand how yu feel and that ist not easy with anxiety...I have the same shitty feelings XD and that is totally okay ^^ love yaaa <3
Dina, isn't Mona Hayward (?) the best of the best!
What happened to the paiamas haul??
Dina, elhamdililah for making the right choices.
I understand the anxiety. InshAllah we all develop more confidence. we are all works in progress xxx
Love you Dina!!\nPleaseeeee show some love on my channel to anyone reading this!!\nI have a Kylie Cosmetics giveaway!! xx
Love your long coat at Instagram!
Sid coming at the end hahahahaha
Aa fuck that Dina, fashion week is so boring anyways
Do not feel bad! Mom guilt is normal, but never feel bad about wanting to be with your baby. Enjoy it when you can and when your not enjoy your you time. Knowing your limit and keeping balance is life... were all trying to keep it in check. Your a good mom & blogger!! You got best of both worlds. 😍
Love that you and Sid has black hoodies on. In time for the All black game. :)
Dina I never knew you had anxiety... Thank you for being so open ... I def get the mummy guilt I am the same with events especially with several in a week. Hey you can always go with me.... Just saying 💛
I know exactly how you feel. Anxiety can be a bitch but who doesn't love being comfortable
i like ur language dina
not to take away from the message of the video, but I love your brows dark!
Thank you for this video. It just shows how real you are, how everyone is fighting their own battles and that no one has it easy. I hope you achieve even greater success in life inshaAllah. Hopefully things will get easier once Hanna grows older. And who knows, she can be your ultimate company to these events :)
Thanks for being so genuine about your life to us your happiness matters the most
I understand. I struggle with high anxiety as well as depression, including some panic attacks
Respect for Dina! Putting family first! Trust me best thing to do once everything goes you'll always have ur family to rely on nd they will support you
This time with your girl will go make the most of it
You do you and do what makes you happy. You don’t have to follow the crowd and your content is good enough as it is. I love you vlogs that involves your family rather than events and stuff.
feel like there is sth different in ur face. maybe the teeth 😒
Kids grow up so quick, so being with them while they are still little and still think you are the best person in world is more important, then suddenly before you blink, they are know it everything teenagers with stacks of attitude.\nAlthough mom guilt is normal, don't feel ever feel bad about putting your family first. :)
Sid is so funny especially when he pops in at the end of your videos also great video thanks for sharing peace
You made some great decisions. You do you boo!
Your teeth does age u a bit but still beautiful
Do what you want, simple :)
Good Dina, always put your family first, you won't get that time again with your daughter when she's already a grown up. Btw love the lashes, what mascara dear, looks good like wearing the one with fake lashes. OMG... That what every girl wishes for a good mascara !!!
Dina your lashes look bomb💣 what did you do to them and what mascara did you use????????? x
Dina whats lipstick you use? i like it
Can you pleaase give a house tour to see details and  interior etc. Beee so much inspooz❤️
What foundation are you wearing dina👌🏽😍
I totally understand & relate to this so much Dina! thanks for sharing <3
We love you Dina! Totally understandable having anxiety.. same here as a musician. Xx
It's ok to reprioritize!  It's great that you can honor family time and when you are tired and over extended.  No apologies or excuses needed!
Dina!!! you dont have to attend events as a blogger to get attention from us your followers. Honestly you being yourself showing us the real you is the reason you are loved so much do what makes you happy spend time with your family and vlog when you can cos gurllll your vids are absolutely hilarious and tbh im always looking forward to watching your videos and particularly the ones you film while your at home it makes it seem like your one of us. You are amazing at what you do!!!! xx
okay but gurllll what mascara have you got on
Salam go check out my YouTube channel and enter my giveaway!!
I never really comment, but I really felt for you when I watched your video. I've got 4kiddies my eldest is 13 and youngest is 3, and mummguilt is something we all struggle with. At No matter what stage of life we are at. Just wanted to say Your doing an amazing job. Your great at what you do and it's a blessing to have a supportive husband and family around you. Whatever your doing is for your family as well. So take solace in that. Your videos are so genuine, nothing fake about what you do, which is why I love watching your Vlogs. You show the true side to you nothing made up with fairy dust over everything. Where everything is hunky dory in Lala land. Your show the good and bad (nothing too bad) and that's what life is. Do what your happy with. Regardless of what other people are doing. It doesn't matter. Good will come it's self. But it's only worth it as long as your happy xx sending love
I get it. I don't have a child so I don't have the mom guilt but I get the anxiety. It prevents me from doing so many of the things I really want to do. About the mom guilt I think it's really important to remember to sometimes put yourself first. I don't care what people say, you CAN have a career AND a loving family - especially when you have a husband that supports you. So good luck :) and hopefully one day our anxiety wont stop us from doing what we love.
Plz remove ur vineers they dont look good on u, u have good teeth and r pretty the way u r
Can you tell us more about your anxiety & how you cope with it? A lot of Muslim people don’t know how to deal with it. :/
why are you and Sid in back hoodie alot my sweet? new looks?? I love it! ill call it the bank robber look!
Thumbs up to you. Time with your daughter and family is more important than money. You can always make money but can never get time back.
Love the fact that Dina is one of the most normal people ever!!  Love it!!!
Alsalamu Alakuim Allah bless you and protect you.  Love your makeup and turban and black sweater. I want to meet and be your friend so much and love you sister. Your soo cute 💎💎💎💎😘😘😘😘
dina, do you feel part of your anxiety comes from being a Muslim woman? I remember your bafta vlog where you talked about how you had been treated at the afterparty and another event which was supposed to honor ALL women but you and your mother were the only ones having issues getting into the event, tho you had the invite and your ID....I’m sorry if that’s part of the reason and people make you feel that way cause of your religion. I’m not Muslim but I am black, I get the being the only one in the room mentality.
nawww your a great mom tbh, and yes I feel like this when I dont spent time with my siblings/parents forget even the guilt of having a child. Dina your awesome, and hana is super lucky to have such a humble and warm mom like you. Love watching you
Good for you gal!! Do you!! If I could stay at home and spend more time with my little one, I sooo would. Maybe one day Insha'Allah...anyway stay happy and sane! 😊
Hi Dina it's very understandable. The opportunities are good but just do you. Hannah will grow up and you won't get the time back so it is ok for you to find a balance that works for you. Please do what you feel good doing and don't stress too much. Also so happy that you will be doing stuff with your sister so you won't be too lonely. ☺️
properly because this is not the right way maybe you don't know so I am just saying and any non muslims who don't know anything about Muslim I don't want any of your reply thanks 🙏🏼
R E A L T A L K ❤️
I think you're just an introvert and get naturally tired after extending yourself too much, there is nothing wrong with that
Absolutely love how brutally honest you are.
Where's the makeup tutorials
The fact that you feel guilty shows how much you care. Hana has such an amazing mother who thrives to make a better change in society. Well done and you deserve a break! We are all human 🌹
You see so many hijabi you tubers begging it to become famous now days so they jump to the opportunity for abit of lime light for this dunya. Dina on the other hand has always remained grounded and raw when it comes to YouTube that’s why no one will ever top her in this game. My fave Muslim YouTuber you are amazing at what you do & a great mom. 💕
Anxiety is a bitch isn’t it. Fair play though if you don’t enjoy them as much for whatever reason. Define your own success you’re doing amazing <3
What mascara do you use your eyelashes look bomb girl 😍
we love you dina! you got this ❤️
Please just do what makes you happy and feel comfortable. I have anxiety too and it’s really hard sometimes and I miss out on opportunities. Your happiness is all that matters. We love you ❤️
Don’t beat yourself up. May Allah helping you find the best balance. I think you’re making the right decisions.
Everyday and family-related content is much more interesting than any fashion week :)

Dina, Don’t mistake what uv been made to believe is ‘anxiety’ or ‘Mum guilt’ with what is in-fact u fighting against ur natural fitrah as a woman.\n The things u mentioned that u feel are because of the way Allah designed women to be. U will always revert back to ur natural fitrah no matter how much u try to fight it. Society has made a name for  these feelings and called them ‘anxiety’ so that u stop there and don’t look into deeper meanings as to why u feel the way u do. So u don’t look to religion and Allah for guidance. U just say I suffer with anxiety. In fact u don’t. It’s just an internal battle with ur innate feelings as woman to want to be at home with her family where Allah prescribed for is the best place. And to be modest and conservative in every way which is why u find these events so uncomfortable sometimes. \nUr not meant to find it comfortable to be around inappropriately dressed people, alcohol, music. So in fact what ur feeling is complete NORMAL and what isn’t normal is what ur doing and trying to convince urself is a problem with urself called anxiety. Don’t fight ur fitrah. What Allah designed u as. U will never find true happiness that way. Go with what Allah has prescribed for u and only then will u  taste the true sweetness of happiness. \n\nI’m not one to leave comments ever, but I saw this short clip and felt compelled to say something. I get how u feel coz I was in the same position few years ago. Feelings I couldn’t quite explain. An uncomfortable feeling being in certain places. It’s because it’s not what Allah has prescribed for us as women. \nAnd By the Way men face the same battles with ‘anxiety’ as they go against their natural fitrah too. By becoming less protective towards their women. Society has completely changed the roles to make it that men who accept their wives free mixing and dressing inappropriately are viewed as confident in themselves and those who find it uncomfortable for their women to be speaking to non mahrams as insecure men. But no. Men should feel a natural jealousy and protectiveness over their women. Be it their mother wife sister or daughter. When they fight that, they also have these ‘feelings’ that  they can’t explain and name them anxiety. They feel frustrated and can’t explain it. \n\nI hope this didn’t read too bluntly but that’s how text can be sometimes. Compared to actually speaking about stuff. \n\nAnyway I just wanted to help u with the way ur feeling. I know exactly what it feels like and I am now free of that. Alhumdulilah. TabarakAllah. Happiest Iv ever been. \n\nAs Muslims we’ve been given the gift of knowing what’s to come and if we truly claim this to be certainty then how can we justify the actions we knw r wrong to be ok.. what will u say to Allah when ur standing infront of him.. that’s the question that changed my life. What will I say to my creator..? What will be a good enough reason..? I wasn’t ready? I tried my best? Not good enough. \n\nHope U read this and it helps in some way  inshallah. At the moment Allah has kept some form of guilt in ur heart when u do something u knw isn’t right, don’t let that small portion be taken away from u. Act upon it before it’s taken away. It’s not too late. U have a daughter who will lead by ur example. True love means wanting jannah for those we love x
Wow ur so honest ...
Good video but damn those eyelashes
Is your eyelashes natural ?
I miss your old teeth maaan

#BlackHoodGang ! Hit me up :)

To all those people out there who live in Bradford hit the like button\n#hometown
Don’t yell at me, but your teeth look way better now! I hated it at first but they’ve settled..... or is it better lippy? You look GORGEOUS ❤️,
dear sisster if u coverd your head and body beang a muslim so remember  that islam doesn't allow u to show your face to na mehrem people
I blame feminism.... This shit got us working for the rest of our life!
Dina you're  an introvert!! (not same as shy) meaning you are easily overwhelmed by the stimulus that comes with social situations especially extreme ones and you need time to unwind and get away from these overwhelmingly stimulating situations (doesn't just have to be social ones). This is not bad at all it's just who you are and it means you're much more aware of things around you and focused more on feelings, thoughts, moods rather than outward stimuli. That's why you feel so overwhelmed after being in lots of social situations for a period of time. In order do be at optimal functioning you NEED days of relaxation or just focused work. Do not listen to those who say that it maybe holding you back this is who you are and you can't change such an integral and important part if yourself that AIDS you way more than it hinders. (I'm a psychology student btw so I know *partially* what I'm talking about)

Congrats!!!
I LOVED THIS !!!
French😍😍😍
I have that eyelash curler :)
🇫🇷
French
french is lovely
french
Love French
French Side.❤️
French looks bueat
Her eyes remind me of miley cyrus
FRENCH
French
the brow wiz always breaks there!
I like French
French side
Blind the haters😂 bruh
am i the only person who covered half of her face the whole time to admire the french makeup
I love the French side.
You should really make a video for French makeup!😍😍😍
guess I'm part French because I love to apply using my fingers
I love both sides!!!! So beautiful!! 😍😍😍
your face just look like katy perry 😱
I'm American makeup half of the time and French makeup the other half.
what you call american makeup is what we call Arabic makeup( look for ,  Ghadeer Sultan , waad makeup , hanan) \n some of the younger girls put it for the gym and even to work  and some of them get really early their jobs start at 6 and 7 \nbut sure not everyone most of them are girls in their 20s ..  now  i think it is an worldwide trend for the younger girls
After watching this video I’m thinking “Do I need all the makeup I own?” Because the french side is just ahhhh-mazing
new to this channel, and I am already obsessed *o*
I do the French style everyday and if I go out at night I do the American style
clear to say, american version is absolutely hideous ... imo, overly caked.
She suits the French side and I also would prefer it myself
this video is pitch black for me
I prefer the French very classy
So the French just need a quarter of the time an American girl would need to get ready xD
The french side is much prettier (in my opinion) and looks so much more natural and not packed on.
Wow I’ve been doing my makeup French style for years and didn’t even know it! 😂
could you put the link in for the morphe 350 2 palette? I cant seem to find it anywhere
For some reason I was doing the French makeup all my life and I am not French
do a Mexican vs American makeup look
French is prettier but make up is just so fun to play with
Handle journey English good handle rather reaction brick.
French is the way I do my makeup. Nice video, love the comparison idea.
I like the French side.❤️ Although I work at Sephora, I do the American side of the foundation, contour and brows...and the rest pretty much the other side.
Love seeing the difference in makeup between different places it's so wonderful!
Ive never worn make up i had it so much lmao
I like French because I don't like wearing eyelashes
Wow the French one is real pretty 😳
love the french side
can you do a video of the other french look with the wing and natural lip please? I LOOOVED this
Love the french side. Can u do a video on how u keep ur teeth white?
i love the french side so much more, its gorgeous
Hey!! Could you do more french tutorials but with your whole face? Lol I'm a huge fanatic for natural makeup looks but I haven't seen many girls do it as good as you do in this video!!
Your eyes are so beautiful, I have never seen eyes that look brown almost olive colored.
Party to the left, everyday makeup to the right.
Can you try some Japanese makeup pls
I prefer the French makeup for sure! Her French eye looks so much more open and alert and the red lipstick makes the green in her eyes pop! Less is more sometimes! But both are lovely.
I prefer the French side.
I'm really bummed that she didn't give any credit to Mr Jovita George for coming up with this idea and making these videos for the past few months.
When I have five minutes to get ready: French. Weekend: American.
FRENCH!!! YES!!!    A POX on this HORRIBLE Instacrumb makeup clowns!!!
Instinct tells me to say French because that what truly like but society has taught me to like the American side isn't society lovely teaching us to not be truly us
I prefer the French side
I always do the French. Unless i'm going out.
Both are beautiful but French is closer to how I do my own makeup but mostly because I'm not good at it.
Loved this video so much. Both looks are amazing. Everyone is beautiful in their own way, love your message!!!
French is always more natural and bold!
French vs American is similar to Classy vs Skank Hooker.  Simply don't know how one can choose!
The french side looks like marion cotillard
she looks like Kylie Jenner at 0:08
In love with the French style, is more easer to recreate, I believe, but the drama in the other side, I'd be happy if I could recreate a fusion between both styles ☺☺☺☺
I love both, but the French side looks so beautiful
I just found out I'm french.
I like the French more
Love American xD lol\nShe looks like demi lovato with American??? Just me okai (crawls in hole)
I prefer French it's how I do my makeup
So American is eye emphasis and French is lip emphasis ?
Idk why but she reminds me a lot of Lucy Hale
I love how the French is more of a natural look😩😍
Try Thai makeup I find interesting that it's not that known because it's really cute it's basically a mix of western and Asian makeup.
The French side is so classic! Oh La La
Them both are perfect for different ocasions! Plus, you're so beautiful! Loved this video ❤
Hi, omg you Look so beautyful. 💕van you make a Video About american and german make up?
I loved the French side. I'm a mix of both sides, though. I love natural makeup for the majority of the face & eyes, but will pop on falsies & a blinding highlight everyday 💗✨💋
The French side also looks like the person is very friendly
I love both sides! But I still love my American make up the most lol.
She Americanized the eye makeup of the French side
I love the French side😊
The American side... it only looks good on instagram or youtube, it looks horrible in real life, so the French side any day of the week!
I like the French more tbh🤷‍♀️
Wow Americans can get so extra sometimes
This is how I see it. Kylie Jenner is her right and Kim is her left 😂 I love them both but that just reminded me of them randomly
U look like Demi Lovato and Kylie Jenner on the American side and on the French side u look like yourself 😻😻
Is she a model
I like French side!
what type of eye lenses she's wearing ?
hey don't you hate it when you watch a video and u like something and you put a comment about it and you scroll down the comments section and tons of people already put your comment hey maybe you just need       a notification on that video so that we won't have that problem but you just forget about it so what's even the point 😒😒😒😒
I have a question, who said it was American makeup ? Or French ? I mean yall know high class in America keeps natural makeup, basic hair,  modest  and classy wardrobe etc , otherwise, we all know true country girls want to keep natural makeup and modest fashion . I’m talking about the true ones . Just because American girls like Kardashians and Jenners, which have existed in all the decades, people can’t stereotype makeup trends or fashion trends as American . This makeup trend exists in Europe and Middle East (watch “Arab Makeup” ).
Hmm many French people I’ve seen wear a shitload of black bottom eyeliner and nothing else
I prefer French
Yes Neil, that is cool.
Is it just me that thinks Neil looks completely stoned in this video?
Do Asstronots ever poop in their suits?  Do other Asstronots point and laugh?
Not even gonna lie, I love hearing him talk
I’m pretty sure I could sit and listen to Neil explain literally anything and learn it all
How much energy will it take to speed a spaceship alike The one in star trek to make it go faster than light and what will the conditions have to be so it dosent get distroyed
Well the universe is like a balloon, when ure outside its ezy to understand and explain but if u were inside a balloon how would u explain how it extended?
He seems like he deals with alot of idiots.
Neil clearly didn't read that last question right 😂.
I wanna hear they guy from brain games on this YouTube channel pleas!? (PLEASE!?)
I can't believe I am about to correct Neil Degrass Tyson.... But on the war thing.... NO! Look back at the casualties from all recorded wars. The casualties during say 1700s war was tiny compared to modern wars. The weapons are more dangerous, and much more affective at killing people. The Iraq war killed what? Over 100k people total? You would never ever see such death tolls in previous centuries. Hell to the no Neil. Come on man, I know you trust that science is for the better, but with war? Yeah no way dude. And before you all come in and say yeah but armies are bigger now etc etc. No, I am referring to %s of men killed on the battlefield. The numbers go way up in modern times. It's an outright crime
Why whenever we’re discussing finding extra-terrestrial life we always try and find water. As if other life forms couldn’t survive without water..?
0:07 fuck this shit i'm out
At 2:43 it says Dark matter is making the expanding universe accelerate it should say dark energy.
''Just because you don't see it, touch it, taste it or feel it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist''\nSo God could exist?
Y no one ask him bout quantum computers
Is it really that hard to write a coherent sentence? I'm starting to lose faith in humanity, and lose interest.
Note to self, buy hand boiler.
do parallel universes exist?
That thubnail tho
Neil is SOOOOOOO mych better than bill nye
midichlorians
7:04 what a retardet question
I need that purple thing of the end in my life.
Whenever I hear Neil all I imagine is his voice for god
Is math related to science?
We're basically 100 degree organisms My Canadian ass: wtf?? Wouldn't our blood fucking BOIL at that temperature?? Room temperature is 70 degrees Oh yea... He's American...... They use bullshit temperature
The earth is not fucking flat you conspiracy retards!!
to err is human, to really stuff things up takes technology
I think we can argue we do feel/experience protons - we have stomach acid, we digest food - those are some very pertinent effects on our own life.
Higgs Boson is what gives an item mass, is it not?
Imagine what the US would be like if they spent most of their national budget on education and scientific research instead of the fucking F-35
is math related to science?
I don't know why I just don't like this guy. Everytime I see him I think he's such a pretentious a-hole
The education system in the US needs to change. The US government has cut so much funding from the education system in order to limit the aspirations of those who would like to teach and to limit the knowledge available and the knowledge provided to our future generations for the simple fact that ignorant people are easier to govern. Knowledge is power and we need to spark a fire within ourselves and our future generations to seek knowledge.
Did have the thought that he looks like the Kid-President,\n\nWhat would happen if did become USA-President?\n\nDo you want a person like him as president in your country?
Why is everyone talking about how everyones talking about hating Neil? I only see people talking about haters not A SINGLE HATER
Some war is good. Having a war brings the need to be better than your opponent. That need forces you to invent now ways of perceiving reality. Which means better sciences.
i have a question can we go out in milky way galaxy
the twitter post inst explaining it right it says that dark matter makes the universe expand faster thats wrong. as neil said its dark energy not dark matter. dark matter could be in corelation to dark energy but it is not why the universe is expanding faster
deGrasse or Micheal is be a batter techer?
Neil is a science guy.  Not bill.  And I love science
So much more insightful than the joke known as Bill Nye
Poor Neil, need to answer all those stupid question :D
I got lost in his moustache...
NOO my question was is math related to science
I believe in God, but i think this man is a genuis and respect him 100 percent👍
WHAT IS THE FOURTH DIMENSION?!?!!?!?!!??!!?!?!!??!!?!?\nAHHHHHHHHHHH
2:41 He answered the question with dark matter - but isnt dark matter matter that has mass but doesnt interfere with other matter and light?
This guy makes me SMILE SO MUCH i just love him! XD
Can this guy be my teacher... Please?
10:00 - 10:27 so if its 105 degrees, i dont actually have to eat really anything??????????\nI guess thats why you dont see fat lizards. I see kamodo pets here on youtube and they get cancer and die super quick if you over feed them. They don't get fat like humans. They just friken die. Being able to be fat definitely is part of a being that is space fairing. When you look for e.t., make sure you look for fat slug looking people like us!!!!!!! Sitting for countless hours studying requires energy reserves of fat.
The fact that people immediately bring / criticize religion into this makes me uncomfortable
For anyone that's wondering that toy he plays with that the end is called a hand boiler. You can buy them online and they're pretty cheap and cool.
The peace question was totally misunderstood lmao
If anyone thinks the way like Wow Mr. Tyson doesn't know how that girl meant peace!. Then please think about that he would have enough time to understand these slang type of shit stuff of the 21st century
Yes Katy, Math is related to Science.
We have no idea how many stars a born in a year. We have never seen one form!
I have to disagree. The thing about wars not killing that many people today has little to do with science and more to do with economics. \n\nThe major countries, with the bigger military forces, are tied up with each other due commercial relationships. So, a war between then is really far from desirable.\n\nALTHOUGH... things are getting are little bit strange these days. Not saying WW3 will start tommorow, but some important changes might happen in the next decade or 2.
His tie actually looks so cool
What is the thermometer called
2:40 He meant Dark Energy in the tweet
What’s a front room
Such a great guy
'Across The Universe' is fantastic. It's a love story told through Beatles music.
wait is this the meme dude
is math related to science
three-spacial one-time dimension, get over it XD
There's a planet that's 1/3 diamond
Is England a city?
He's adorable. I love him.
That doesn't seem right to me, wouldn't the most stars be formed in the earlier days of the galaxy when the universe as a whole was denser? And why would it be even? Are we not moving towards heat death?
I have a quesiton: Is math related to science?
his voice is so soothing omg
3:55 I'M TRIGGERED
Sup fuck face?
dani yell wtf was that question
Make Neil come back weekly
Neat as hell
Neil supports the universe
joe jmany jdiej
My teacher pls be my teacher
3:14 sounds like god
That inflatable planet looks like uranus
YES
*is math related to science?*
Is math related to science \n\n\n\n\n\n( joke)
Is math related to science?
Could that guy ran for president?
Is math related to science?
yo tyson, stop goin on about war, u eat meat. meat is war on animals mate. science has figured out how we can survive without meat , people are making alternatives to animal stuff but ppl still use it, ignore it all and still eat animals, why?\ntaste hahahah\nits akin to science finding an alternative to war and a way we can all not have war at all but still people running around shooting up schools for fun.
3:17  Cant this argument be used for lets say the existence of God???..... just because we cant see God or such etc dosent mean he dosent exist........ PLEASE KEEP THIS SECTION CIVILIZED.... and whoever wishes to argue lets roll😃..... Great video btw
Since the universe is still expanding, what if you are faster than light and able to pass it, basically going further than the universe, you will be somewhere where there is nothing absolutely nothing.NOTHING
If we're expanding, what are we expanding in to? Empty space? But even now we have empty space in atoms, so most of the universe is therefore empty space. So what defines the universe, and the things outside of it?
That's cool and all, but *what in the fuck* are we going to do about overpopulation?
Who are the 1k idiots that disliked this video?
Oh this guys a government pig.
I think I've disproven the infinite realities theory.\nHELP
What's the point of sleep if eating gives u energy :/
3:14 so God exists confirmed?
Wow thanks for posting this.  His last song, wow!  It's both great to see his last song and kind of spooky as he was waving to the crowd and putting his hand on his chest.  We know he meant something like thank you from the heart or I love you all but it was...well eerie.  I know we all will miss him as he was/is awesome.  RIP Tom and thanks for letting us borrow all your songs.  We shall take good care of them for you.
Thank you for sharing it.
Rest in peace Mr. Petty.
There will never be another Tom Petty - One of a kind LEGEND 💖
He was the greatest and my all time favorite as well as a true inspiration to a down and out bar band singer, gonna miss ya Tom your concerts were amazing will keep singing your songs til its my turn to stand before the gates of hell but no I'll never back down just like you
Tom Petty is a legend, one of my favourites.  I love his music and his Very Cool Style.RIP in Heaven and keep playing your great music with the other legends already there.God Bless Tom Petty and may your music live on forever.
We're almost out of time.  Little did he know.
When he said I wanna thank you for 40 years of a great time.. it's almost like he knew he was gonna go.
This made me sad and happy at the same time. RIP Tom. The music world will miss you
THE ULTIMATE IRONY.....TOM BROKE ALL OUR HEARTS...CAUSE HIS HEART QUIT....BUT IT DIDNT IN ALL HIS FANS HEARTS.....GREATEST AMERICAN GUY....CANT COME AROUND NO MORE....HE WAS TRULY SOMETHING BIG....JUST MAIKN SOME NOISE....FOREVER
A lifetime of rock....literally. RIP, Tom!  <3
He went out on top! Saw his show in Cincinnati.  Long live Tom Petty and long live his legend!💔
That’s how you finish a rock and roll show!\nThanks for the music, Tom.
Saw him at The Greek in Berkeley. It was one of the best shows I've been too, and I'm so grateful for having seen him before he passed. Hope you're playing all sorts of crazy shows up there, Tom. Miss you, buddy. We all do.
The few people who clicked on the thumbs down icon, should have their thumbs removed. They obviously don't need them.
that's going out with your boots on ! ! as the guitar free falls in the background...what an ending what a life...RIP TP
A true American rock icon. He always gave 100 % for the fans. He made real rock...his way. His music was our music, because he understood what it was like to be a regular guy, and he never compromised. He will be greatly missed.
Thank you for the soundtrack to my life!
And so he walked off stage...and out of our lives forever...Thomas Earl Petty, you will be missed.  R.I.P.
He was the best . There was nothing better. R,I.P.
I really wanted to go to this too man... RIP Tom ✌
This makes so sad that I never did get to see them live I have been a fan since the 80's . But what a last song, a proper classic and I can't understand the 174 dislikes.
Rest in peace brother, you will be missed.
I just can't believe one Muthafucker on this planet would thumbs down my dude Tom Petty, but yet I see 172.   If you thumbs downing anyone's video, you should take a good look in the mirror.  You've just helped the terrorists of the world.... win.
Thank you so much for sharing this last song! I got to see them in Berkeley and was moved to tears to see so MANY different women's pictures. I'm missing him SO much! Thank you for 40 amazing years dear Tom. We will never forget you! Give George, John and Prince our love!
Hey Skip!  Thanks for capturing this last hurrah!  I'm your lucky Subscriber #1,000!  What do I win?
Xhyis last song done alive  American girl
Love. Gratitude. Videos of American girls of all ages and races.  Your music will go on and you are missed, Tom Petty.
I still can't believe he's gone.  So much of my young adult life revolved around his music.  Bought Damned the Torpedos when it first came out, then quickly bought his first two Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and You're gonna get it albums too.  By 1983 I had Hard Promises and Long after Dark on vinyl as well.  I had them all recorded on cassette and would listen to them in the car and while touring on my motorcycle.  I traveled all over the country with his music cranked up.  \n\nOnly got to see him live once, but TP & the Heartbreakers were Awesome at Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado, back on June 8th 1983. They played for 2 solid hours non-stop.  Was a fun week of shows at Red Rocks, with U2 on June 5th, English Beat on June 1st, and Men at Work May 31st.  Even saw the new up and coming band The Fixx at a small venue in Denver that week.  Got stood up by a girl for that show, so I went by myself. Saw a lady trying to buy a ticket at the gate. Walked up to her, handed her the ticket and said, here's a free front row seat, I got stood up tonight.  We had a great time that evening.  A week of music that I'll never forget that ended with Tom Petty.
His last dance with mary jane?
Thank you for the great music\n...
he went out on top
Watch the 4 hour doc on him good story fuck the bs  just watch. Look and yea will find!
I Fifty Shades of Grey
He knew... he knew he was near the 'end of the line' and kept on playing... Bless you brother
Would it have killed him to quit smoking?
One of the greatest songwriters ever. One of the greatest American Rock and Rollers ever. \n Just think about the soundtrack waiting on us one day at the pearly gates.
In my opinion of all the musicians the world has lost recently, Tom Petty's passing is the hardest to take for me! His free and positive spirit and of course his amazing music is like medication for the soul! He truly brought hope and light to many people in a dark and frightening world. He will be missed very much forever!
What a class act! One single bow, in a very modest theatre-company style, followed by full? Credits like a movie. Utmost respect.
Classic Tom Petty! RIP! Thank You! for showing this!
wow the last time w this last song. Thanks for the rocking year.  \nRIP
Awesome, thanks for being there and uploading this. Last time I saw him in concert was too f'n long ago. RIP
This video is a part of history. Thank you for posting ❤️ what an honor it was to be there
Hard to believe that merely 7 days later he would be dead. It is still surreal. Gone way too soon. :'(
Was anyone else more affected on Monday October 2nd by the Tom Petty news than the Vegas slaughter?  I know I have shed a lot more tears over TP than I did over another senseless mass shooting.
Love you, Tom !!! Thank you for all the great songs !!
The first Tom Petty song I remember hearing was Refugee. I was a Freshman in high school. 1980 is a long way from here. Hope he's having a blast in heaven.
R.I.P : Tom Petty official all American Rocker!
One of my life's great regrets is that I didn't get to see him live. I had numerous opportunities, but I always found a reason that it was too difficult. Now I'll never get the chance. If you feel like you should see someone live, by all means go!!!
So many memories attached to so many great songs. Will miss you Tom.
Great music from a great human being
His songs are part of the soundtrack of my teenage life. Fly with the angels Tom!
4 decades, thanks for the memories T.P. \nRest in paradise good sir.
Bowie, Allman, now Petty. Think Gods trying to tell you something ??
Thanks for posting this, Skip. I was there two nights before and was in wonder at the happiness in which he played that night. I'm glad you captured this. It'll be iconic. Your seats must've been crazy good.
Love ya Tom.  You looked tired, too tired.  God Bless You Brother. RIP
Grabbed at his heart at the end of this. RIP my Mr Tom Petty. So much love too you! Thank you for giving me an awesome child hood and an escape!
We are almost outta time RIP Tommy
I got a weird vibe that Tom knew his time was running down. Go in peace, sir.
🎶♥️🎶 What an artist he was❗️The Poet 🎶 We had the best music growing up‼️ They just don’t make them like this anymore. Thankful I got to see him in Memphis on his last journey. Thanks for all the great music and making the memories of those years even more memorable with your words & outstanding composing of your music 🎶 Rest Easy Mr. Poet .
I've missed him from the moment I heard that he left us!\nHis songs brought so many emotions to me for decades. I'm feeling sadness every time they play him on the radio right now.\nThanks, Tom for the memories, the songs you wrote and recorded, and the performances!\nI'm 'heartbroken'.....Gonna take awhile to get over it too!
God bless Tom and band for 40 wonderful years.  My heart is breaking.
It's sad that Tom Petty has died. My family always loved listening to his songs in the car.
his music will never die   rip tom
Thank you Tom Petty for over 40 years of great music. Rest in Peace!
Wow man, what an ending to an amazing career and life!  Thank you for posting this!
Miss you always  love you brother  Jim lost in the 60 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
My wife always said: He's quite possibly the coolest man on the planet.\nNow he's quite possibly the coolest spirit in the cosmos. R.I.P.
Tom Petty was an Legend and He will be Missed
Brought joy to my heart and tears to my eyes at the same time. Thanks for making this available!
I just smile when he starts playing. Ear to ear grin. Thank you so much Tom Petty!
I seen Tom Petty and Heart Breakers playing Refugee on Midnight special when I was 16 yrs old. Im 55 now. I feel fortunate to have seen them play in 4 or 5 different venues.The last being in Seattle Wa (Safeco field) at the end of their 40th anniversary tour. Was a truly amazing show. \nThank you for all those memories, musical or otherwise. \nTom Petty will be forever missed by this forever fan of 40+ yrs. RIP\nSChap
RIP TOM PETTY !  What a  talent and you will be so missed. Derek xx
So great that the screen is showing all American women they are all creed's all colors all different and so are we men and we better start loving each other soon because things are going down the shitter fast.
Everybody liked TP&TH because they were just a great band with great songs.
I am so happy that Tom Petty was able to complete his tour and go out with a bang doing something that he truly loved.
From Las Vegas We Love You Tom Pettty!!
Thank you so very, very much. Written with teary years and a bittersweet heart.
Heard TP on the radio in July on a road trip. Hadn’t heard of him in a long time. Thought, oh wow, he could be next. Googled him, saw he was still performing & was pleasantly surprised. What an amazing exit to rocknroll in our dimension. 😉
RIP Tom!
Shit man.....
he sounds drunk   sad face
how sad
So awesome thanks for sharing ♥
Great
RIP TOM
#OMG #MFG
Thank you Tom!
Thanks for this.
God Bless YOU too, Tom.

A well deserved bow Tom, well deserved.
Sad sad sad !!!!!!!!!!

Remember Steam users, please!
I love how this is trending with only 80k views.
I hear Spielberg is in talks to direct the 3rd season opener. Really hope he does it. Would be a [literal] return to his 80s roots.
Is this an actual game or just a fun little animation?
*I have to play this, thank you for the video because this is the first time I have heard of it*
Tbm faço gameplays do jogo stranger things https://youtu.be/0ZV9FoWmqhU
Less than 300 likes and 27 comments but it’s on trending?!?!??! \nOk YouTube
Where can I find the 13th heart?
See the gameplay of this in\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Z4sjJJnFjy4
This is an app for android and iOS.\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bonusxp.legend
To everyone asking, the game is an app, available on iOS and Android.
Is this gonna be a real game?
I need this in my life.
Its hard to search for it in the play store. I downloaded it after clicking links that directed me to it in the store. Uninstalled it because im werry of its access.
LOL this trailer just spoiled me a lot, I just started watching
If they make a stranger things game, I don’t want it to follow the shows plot. I’d want it to be a completely original story.\n\nedit:unless this already is an original story
Lol wat I have more subs than this company:0
this looks just like Zelda!
I almost blew up my hand playing with dry ice.
Here before this blows up, it's only a matter of time. This looks awesome, but please, please, PLEASE don't make a bad game adaptation! We all want to see a good quality game and not something rushed and thrown together just to earn some quick money.
Omg want.\nDoesn't it come out Halloween?
I want a stranger things game similar to Friday the 13
where can I find it and bring it to the Nintendo switch
Interesting:)
YES
Hi
Who else hit start.😁?
what's the name of the game called
What a game!!👍
Here before this blows up.
Looks great! But please...pretty please. Bring it to the Nintendo Switch?
I'm here before this blows up. I made an it parody check it out ❤️
Please be real.
I CANT FIND DUSTIN IM CRYING
I need this to happen
Pokemon+Undertale+Stephen King:W O N D E R F U L  (Please,bring it on steam)
Baby heartbeat listener Tracker- Heartbeat monitors application has the particular fun and nonmedical objective. \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgametechnologies.baby_heart_rate_monitor_listener&hl=en
I wish they'd do a Stranger Things TellTale game instead
is this a joke or is it real?
This deserves no dislikes, omg so much nostalgia 🤗
Touzani fucking arab get the fucking out you thief go in your muslim country to help homeless peoples u motherfucker FUCK mahomet THE GAY AND PEDOPHIL FUCK ALL ARABS & MUSLIMS !! SHAME ON YOU AND YOUR STUPID BOOK
I deserve these boots for one thing : I am a fan of CR7 since he was in Sporting CP. Then I feel this man as a being human, a lot of charity, he is a big heart in the life. CR7 is a great human not only in football but in the whole life. He is the world amazing man.
I want these cleats I work hard in soccer
The main reason I would like to own these shoes is because my wooden clogs are just as old as the ball and kicks shown earlier in this very entertaining video. Size 43 please.
Cristiano Ronaldo is my dad 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘💞💞💞💖💖💖my dad is the best dad on the World!!!😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘💞💞💞💖💖
Great Video and would be nice to get a pair of new shoes, lottery ticket number 7 lets go
Is it possible to edit the subitles in german?
I want them because I am a little child and I have a future to come
please I don't actually know why I would deserve them more than the next person but would be the best day of my entire life thank you this is awesome

Hai saya dari Indonesia. =I'm from Indonesian. Apa kabar diri mu
ik wil de schoenen graag want dank zij Ronaldo ben ik begonnen te voetballen en ik woon in België Halle zwaaluwenlaan 13
Ik verdien hem\nOmdat ik Ronaldo een Panna kan geven met de schoen uit 1912
Wie is voor real Madrid like dan
Ik verdien deze schoenen omdat ik net zo slecht ben in voetbal, als dat Ronaldo goed is in voetbal.

Can we use this laptop for other software like Revit architect, solid works, etabs, STAAD pro etc...
Having an i7 processor on Chrome OS is like having a gaming pc on an analog tv
If smartphones cost 1000 bucks now, why shouldn't a Chromebook? Boy what a silly way to (attempt to) justify overpricing.  Great video through and through but the hardware and software here are not worth $1000.
I feel like I'm the only one who likes this little device. I think this is made for people who want to play with power and battery life. It's that friend who is always a little more extra, rather than better overall. I'd say this is a great device for high school, college and maybe work since it's built around google drive, so you can back up your stuff to it any time and retrieve it from home. This chromebook brings a new level of efficiency to the table. It could be compared to maybe Windows 10S, but that uses crappy un-optimized Windows Store apps which are mostly ass. Chrome OS has Chrome Extensions, Android Apps and easy cloud storage. This could potentially replace the standard laptop altogether.
WOW, I can run my Chrome OS like super hard on this one... not
Can you run programing programs or IDEs for java, c++ or other languages (ex.: bluej, neatbeans, codeblocks etc.) Basically can ir be use for coding/programing?
Does anyone know if this will be able to run Office? A lot of people will need it for school and work. Also, does anyone know how the screen quality compares to the Mac Book Pro?
Lol I'll buy the HP OMEN for a K
Quick review:\nThousand dollars: stupid.\nDedicated ai button: stupid.\nBad ui android app drawer: stupid.\nFragile expensive glass combo: stupid.\n\nThat's that.
would pay $500
I NEED IT.
Hello BEZEL!!
Them bezels though
I’d rather get the macbook pro
Can the pen work in OneNote?\n\n That would make a competitor to the Surface stuff, for students.
Those bezels are wider than my future is long.
Is it a joke of year 2017 i5, 8gb ram, 128 gb storage even my mobile is better than this.
So rich people have money to waste on  some junk like this
The one and only reason to buy a chrome book is because they’re cheap. This is gonna flop. But I don’t think Google’s intention is to sell this to the masses.
I really think that its better to windows xp based laptop than this one.....
Haha no thanks. And no design awards either
All your important apps are made for phones? That's ridiculous. I've never seen a professional at work on his phone.\nOK, maybe except professional scammers?
but why would you use these specs for a chromebook?
Surface pro is better
I was into it until I saw it does not bring MS Windows 10.
I like the body and the specs of the i7 variant, but not running on chrome OS. Running it with Linux would be sweet, having around 8hours of usage. 13 to 15 FHD or better display.
can you make a dual boot on this machine? like windows 10 and chrome os?
I'd definitely choose an iPad Pro over this. Only reason I'm using a Surface Pro is because I need to do software development.
Damnn all those Google products looks pretty clean, but still to pricy thooo 🤪😣😣.
Why would I pay 1000$ for a PC thats limited to google chrome and some android apps when I can get something for 1/2 the price or less that does both of those things, and much more?
Bla bla bla. Why don't you review the actualy chromebook?\nThat screen looked terrible. Glossy and dim.
Chromebooks should top out at 500 bucks. You can get a Windows laptop with a 1060 for 1000 dollars
does the pen work on any device. I feel like that would be a big market for google.
Google just take my money already
Yea,no. Google Office is still no Microsoft office. And I have never had any experience of  coding in android (or iOS for that matter). Is that even possible ?
A lot of people don’t need traditional computers anymore there’s a market for these and it will get bigger in the future.
I love the design
Cool device, but the surface is a better deal in every way for a similar price. And if you want just install an android emulator and you get app support.
Oof. Glass on the bottom?! Na-ah.
a $1,000 Chromebook... running chrome OS? no thank you.
1 thing though. Google can lock you out of your account at any time, for any reason. Check out what happened to Dr. Jordan Peterson. No thanks
The only thing I can’t do with a phone that I wish I could is use desktop-like programs and this laptop can’t do that, so it’s quite useless for $1000 in my opinion. But the design is awesome, it should have either been a windows laptop or $600
If this thing came with  a gtx 1050  ti with 256 ssd this would be my go to laptop i just love the design
Sexy AF ! Could it run Win10 ?
What's the music in the start?
I totally would have bought this if it had come out earlier.

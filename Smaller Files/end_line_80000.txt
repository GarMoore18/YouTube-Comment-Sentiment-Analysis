4:15 4:19 is just so cringe Im not gonna lie
Bend the knee reaction where u at?
You are literally the best❤️
React to netnobodys new diss ksi gets played the fuck out
2:40 love how simon's face goes blank
Will you ever react to bend the knee tho.
Disk Till Dawn Before Zain Malik Released His Song
Ksi:these n*ggas ain't ready\nSimon:I mean I am that's why I'm reacting to it\nMe:When the fuck did Simon turn black?
I am not british or American....I understand everything
wheres the other reaction for net nobody's, ksi got destroyed
The fact that your promoting KSI's bullshit, makes me mad :I
Remember when ksi said he doesn't make fun of depression well he made fun of NetNobody cutting himself that was when he was struck with hard depression
I understood the click click line. In America, especially in the South, where I'm from. That is the sound of gun fire, which is heard every night. 
haven't you seen net nobody's new diss track that explains everything?
Why does Simon hate ski so much
I'm American and I completely understand this video and this diss track
Wait so is he on JJ's side or Adam's side?
I am American and I know what he is saying
Dude, are you dumb, half those lyrics were lies from his whore ex.
Are u guys just friends or still beef
Simon I wish you could understand the real problem with adam and alesa.
2:22 is gonna be the next meme😂
Skip to 2:29 thank me later
NETNOBODY FUCKS HIM UP IN BEND THE KNEE
Ha Simon doesn't even react to bend the new cuz ksi said don't FUCKIN react to it
Why does he do the click click 💥
I'm personally annoyed that almost everybody believes that all these accusations of Adam are 100% fact. They aren't, please do some research, and look from both sides before making a biased opinion. Alesa has cheated on Adam, and lied, and manipulated Adam's friends into thinking he's abusive, and mentally unstable. Alesa has kept his son away from him, even though Adam had a custody plan for them to work on. Adam is completely destroyed by not being able to see his son. Mason doesn't even recognize him anymore. Adam is not perfect, neither is KSI, or Alesa, but next time try seeing both sides before making a judgement.
obviously you aren't ready because you aren't a nigga
So bend the knee dident happen ? Ore what. If you know the drama whit adam and alissa youd know she is a snake. Js
The only reson adam did that so he could get custody of his child
React to Bend the Knee by NetNobody
is it just me or ksi and net nobody together netnobdy is bettert hen him
Mate net nobody was well smart he set it up to get his kid back mate
Is it just me or do u find it funny when Simon drinks his red bull from a straw
im america and i understand
after adam hears this, he is 100% likely to kill himself
There's not gonna be anymore cuz he's dropping an EP
you should react to Bend The Knee
yOU DRINK RED BULL WITH A FUCKING STRAW.
miniminter the only guy who drink redbull from a straw.
I'm American I understand
when is he going to react to netnobodys new diss?
Yeah my jam only because my last name is Adams
Why you not paying for child support bruh? So funny!!
You all missed the picture where netnobody actually shits the bed at 2:11
Simon if you knew the back story you would find jj more disrespectful
How did this guy get this many views!??! He doesn't deserve it!
My favorite diss track is ksi exposed
Ksi been played
I wanna SNAP your neck
REACT TO NETNOBODY BEND THE KNEE :)
Hey min dick kys
Rip ads
SKY DOES BJS
lol
Dude. React to bend the knee bud
KSI MUM AND DAD WORKING ON A DISS TRACK FOR JOE WELLER NOW VIDEO  MY CHANNEL
Where's that blue tracksuit from
You talk to much
Its over\nSorry Simon, but you were wrong
Bro what do you mean Americans won't get it?
I mean I know he's your friend and all but do you have to lie about the song being good? The disses were tough but the song was dead. JJ lacks the skill to rap
If you look closely when simon pauses the video you can see his sound is muted😨😨😨
Love the intro
2:04 the face ksi makes
4:09 look what alesa is sying
on 2:40 Simons face expression changes face
You should watch netnobody's diss track #ksigotbaited
HELLI REACT TO NETNOBODYS OTHER DISS TRACK KID

What the song
Who tf drinks redbull from a straw hahahaha
Yeah but Alisa is a fucking liar
your lovely chatty style, all of the lovely soft pillows in the background, make me feel just like i'm relaxing talking to a friend :)
Love your videos Carrie, so glad you made Jonnys wedding, I was there in Lucys Rock Choir, it was amazing.
Please make a video of the things you got at book sighning
I was the short eight year old girl that saw you and started laughing uncontrollably and I saw you in Manchester
Random but... As much as I like the channel name does anyone else think Carrie Hope Fletcher would be a better fit now? Feel like Carrie's grown past her channel name, in a good way.
Hello everyone!  I'm looking for online friends that have personal blogs..I'm trying to start one and I'd love any tips or help!  I'm not going to post the link here because I'm honestly not trying to promote it I just want some advice, and I for some reason decided to ask around here because out of all the Youtubers I keep up with Carrie's audience is always the most lovely and someone once told me you should surround yourself with people who lift you up and I think the sentiment of the Hopefuls as a whole really captures that for me...so anyway, if anyone is down to help a gal out, let me know! :)
I saw Adams family last night and really enjoyed it, you were so amazing!
You at the end is currently me with everything now, I just got my WiFi connected to my flat after two weeks ahahaha
I love how greatful you are for everything. It is so so important and lovely♡♡ you deserve everything you get xxx
How much I love your tour video's I've really missed your non stop rambling about anything an nothing. Welcome home, I hope you enjoy every second of it! ❤️
I started following Megan, she's amazing. I've had a few years of not liking what I see in the mirror.. no more. Love to you Carrie.xx.
Carrie I want your top!!  And btw I kept being called Wednesday Addams today because I put my hair in two plates!
There should be a cast recording for the uk cast of addams family!! so many people would buy it!
after Carrie went on about Megan I paused it and got lost in Megan's Insta...#notevensorry
And we loved they you could be there :) LOOOVE YOOOOOOOOU!
What happened to Pete? I feel like I have been missing the fact that they split up for ages!! 😯
I know your instagram isn't a body positivity page but I do exactly what you do with Megan and go to yours as you are so comfortable in your own skin and i identify with you and your body type a lot... YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL thank you <3
Your eyebrows have got so good I am shook
The whole body positive movement is just an excuse for unhealthy habits
How to be happy sounds so good but it doesn't come out until march I want to cry
I have the same t-shirt!
Ah yes the body positivity movement, the only movement that requires no movement.
I'm all for not hating your body but if your heart can't take it then you have a problem. There are no 80-year-old large ladies or gents.
It's somewhat important to remember that sending people free stuff is advertising just as much as starting a campaign with commercials and ads and such; and paying people to share your product just by giving it to them can be both _much_ cheaper _and_ more effective than the more traditional techniques. (Even without expectation that you'll tell anyone you got it, the simple fact that people have a natural/social impetus to say thank you for a gift means that shotgunning a bunch of these out to people with audiences, it's probably well worth it to the brand.)\n\nI've encountered concern about the ethics of this sort of advertising--when brand deals, which pay _much_ more, are also a thing, this technique starts to seem pretty dodgy. Especially since it's an appeal to the brand's supposed generosity (which I suppose isn't always fake--you may well simply have a fan at Google who added you to that list, for example); or, more to the point, it's an appeal to the idea that the brand has done _you_ , the creator whom we love, a favor, and thus we should consider supporting them in return: an idea which can be very dishonest when we consider the opportunity cost to a professional content creator of accepting this sort of advertising.\n\nSORRY FOR THE DEPRESSING ECONOMICS DISCUSSION I just feel this is something more people should be aware of, whatever their conclusions about it. :S
Just saw you on the tube! Now kicking myself that I didn't say Hi. I didn't want u to think I was weird jumping to say hello as soon as I got on the train! :( maybe next time I'll have the courage!
So glad you're happy to be home, and that you're happy in yourself. You reminded me so much of your brother throughout that though, I must say. Which isn't a bad thing? I'm just saying. :) xxx
You deserve all the best. I love you're videos.
The body positive movement and Megan literally changed my life. There really aren't words are there?
With you amazing voice I have to make my request. Can you do Ave Maria? I can't get enough of all the songs you do but something touching but sad like that or Bottom of the River is what my soul needs. You voice is hauntinly beauitufl so please consider it!
Carrie! I'm so glad you shared this. Her Instagram feed is honestly so inspiring! I'm so glad to have that in my life now. Those books sound wonderful (and you nailed the pronunciation of Como the first time you said it!) - you're 100% deserving of receiving it all!
Are you high because where is your energy coming from?
In love with Carrie's makeup and figure lately. She looks so mature yet graceful. Feel like I've watched you grow up from your old videos with Dan and Phil and the Vamps to now lol. Always be one of my YouTube faves🤗
Home is fab. Glad you get to chillax at home for abit.
Going to see you tomorrow 😊😊😊😊
Hahaha. The last clip was just too adorable. Thank you for making the best videos. 💗
How to be happy really sounds like the plot of the game The Cat Lady. Beautiful game, you should all check it out!
WTF Carrie? Why do you have body image issues? Your body is amazing. You're so thick, and proportionate, and have curves in all the right places. I know naturally thick girls who managed to make themselves skinny that don't look nearly as good that way. Why not just look as good as you can for your body type? I mean, your body type is pretty awesome.
I started crying at the end when you started talking about home because I've only just left home for the first time to start college across the country. Everything's wonderful except my brother and dad and mum and old friends are missing. There's nowhere like home.\nSaw you in Dublin a few weeks ago by the way - you were sensational, as per usual
See you in Belfast in October!
The first Disney song would be 'Under the Sea' because The Little Mermaid is the best!! :D <3
I like your vlogs a lot, but I LOVE these sitdown videos. Happy you made one!
The Google bit at the end was so cute. Lol.
I've miss your chatty videos and your sofa! Welcome back Carrie
I'd laugh so hard if you received some Coca Cola through the PO box from Oliver XD
You seem so happy and excited to be home and that instantly makes me feel happy just from the vibes you give off, you're amazing 💜💜💜
I want that speaker! Omg omg it's brilliant!
does anyone else think that's the Wednesday lipstick ? xxx
Don't take home for granted is something I've come to realise in the past few weeks. I've been working all over central and Southern Scotland and though I've seen cool places, I find myself craving the little corner of the world I call home and am always super happy to be back 🏠
Carrie kinda speaks and has the vibe of my history teacher! She is so passionate about things
This video really made me smile. I just noticed it when the video was over. It must have been you ;)
So good to see you home Carrie! <3 Missed that big ole purple sofa!
Welcome Home - I don't know how you could be away for so long!  I'd miss my bed too much.  And excellent choice for Google Home to play :)
I just started reading your new book and I CANT WAIT!!
Carrie you are basically my favourite human being and youtuber and my awesome honorary big sister and never let anyone tell you anything mean. Thanks so much for my manual for growing up, All I know now. Keep smiling and keep being......EPIC!!!!!
Why is How to be Happy by Eva Woods not being published till august of next year :,( It sounds so FANTASTIC
How Carrie feels for megan is how I feel for Carrie
The end of this video made me smile so hard 😁
I love my google home!!!!! They are so good!
I love that you mentioned Jonny and Lucy's wedding. Lucy works for Rock Choir which i go to and currently am working towards myself and so i knew Lucy but had no idea she was engaged to Jonny until I saw Gary's photo on Instagram! Such a small world, hope you had a lovely day <3
For a second I thought Carrie had used a green screen because she missed her flat so much.
Carrie, your glasses are SO cute! Sorry if you've answered this before, but where did you get them / what brand /style are they? (Or does anyone else in the comments know? I'm in the market for cuter glasses!)
I just sent a letter in the post to you today! Hope you like it! 😋
I love your t shirt
I don't know what it is but something tells me that Carrie is happy to be home. ;-)
thank you carrie for introducin me to megan jayne crabbe, i'm in tears scrolling through her instagram <3!!!!
I'm sure hundreds of people have already asked this, but what lipstick are you wearing -I need it?! Love the video and I will never take home for granted xx
My hubby got me an Alexa for my birthday back in April. I think he had more fun playing with it than I necessarily did but it's handy for things like setting a timer from the naughty step for my 3 year old lol. Random things I have to do each day lol. Oh that How To Be Happy book sounds kind of sad but that one and the Body Positive ones are going on my Wishlist. Possible purchase once I get through my Book Club book - oh my days it's hard work!
Interesting I have a arc of the same book but it is called Something Like Happy, instead of How to be Happy, weird. I guess in the States and Canada the name is different.
Really loving that lipstick colour. What colour is it? Happy that you get to spend some time at home and I hope you feel better after a sleep in you own bed.
Carrie, just as you feel at home and relieved to be home in the purple flat, watching your videos makes me so much happier. Your videos make me so relaxed and happy and just thank you so so much, love you honorary big sister ❤
Home Is Where The Heart Is
I love homey, comforting videos like this ❤ I can't imagine how nice it would feel to finally be home after so long!
Adore how excited you got by the speaker at the end😂
Hi Carrie & all of her lovely followers! I just started a podcast with my best friend called Shipwrecked all about fictional relationships & the fandoms that inspire them! I would love for you to check it out. We have episodes on Sanvers, Bughead, Ezria, Disney, and Dandy so far! Our next episode comes out October 3 all about Ron and Hermione (proud Hufflepuff here!). Anyways, here's the link if you'd like to check us out :) https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/shipwrecked/id1228774307?mt=2
the slight aggression when telling us to follow megan was just great ++ megan is a queen
You're a youtuber Carrie! Youtube is owned by Google that's why!!! lol So cool!
Thank you for the suggestion! I just ordered Megan's book on amazon, should be in tomorrow ;)
Carrie your face when e speaker plays little mermaid is pure joy :) nice to see you home, and as someone else has said you deserve everything as you are the busiest woman I know and I'm a mum to a 3 year old hahahaha. Keep smiling x
Absolutely love your blogs, your performing and your books, girl! And you're a Gryffindor, like me! I wish I could have a voice like yours one day 💖
Carrie!! It's fantastic to see that you're home sweet home.. but I'm also panicking a little as I am coming to watch the Addams Family on Sat and have been really looking forward to seeing you perform. Please please please tell me you'll be back with the cast by then?! Glad you're getting a well earned rest and home visit though, you certainly deserve it xxx 💜 xxx
Welcome home, Carrie! All of these books sound great. I want to read them all.
Ah, I've missed seeing your pretty purple flat! 💜
Book openings are great videos!! As are all of yours xxx
The sheer joy of that speaker when under the sea comes on 😂😂 love this!!!
I was just thinking the other day of how I hoped you'd do another bookish post soon, and here we are! I would gladly watch you talk about books for ages. Definitely ordering the Body Positivity book and How to be Happy. Enjoy your time at home! ♥
I literally react the EXACT same way about Megan, I actually cannot find the words to describe how much of an impact she has had on my life and well being like holy crap, what a fucking incredible human being. I've followed her for just over a year and honestly, she means the world for me. You and Megan are honestly my idols in life, you have both had such a wonderful and incredible impact on my life in SO many ways I will never ever be able to find the words to thank you both.
Home doesn't feel so good when had to give your kitchen to a massive spider and it's not possible anymore to get food from your own fridge.😭
Yes Megan I love her instagram!!!
Luuuuuv you
https://youtu.be/ICiSDqXmWgA
Why is this trending!
Fabulous 😀
what is your beautiful lipstick shade? <3
I love Megan too, yess!!
Aaaaw I've missed your home videos <3
Foloppy

KYS
Following Bodyposipanda ✅
Would you please be able to talk about what happened with Pete? 🙁
Super proud as always!!! Xxx
This is insanely good. I love it on so many levels. Seriously brilliant. Yaaaaaaas.

Tom: check out my book club!\nme: YES\nTom: check out my book club!\nme: YES\nTom: my children's book club!\nme: o
The most creative way to release book club soooo good
Wow, it was amazing to announce this in a musical style which was entertaining throughout (with some badass moments from you) :D. Doing a book club is a great cause too, encouraging others to read. Please do more announcement videos like this more often :D
Hell I would like to read those books and I'm over twenty
Also well done Dave, yet another awesome video
Beleza, mas e o album 6?
deeply enjoying hearing a new song from you Tom! :)
More of things like that on youtube please !! 😍😍
Why does this have such a Christmassy feel to it? 😆
Bloody hell man could you BE any more of a creative genius caring baddass?!? This is the best thing I've listened to musicality wise in weeks, and this book club/ book is going to be so amazing that I can't even be angry that you're not in the studio creating more insane music.
Determined to learn all the words to this 😂 amazing as always Tom you never fail to amaze me with your songwriting skills! I'm sure this book club will be a HUGE success! X
I went round humming this all day and sometimes saying the words people thought I was insane wondering around singing book club
This is a wonderful idea for kids! Tom, I am so, so, so proud of you. I've been a fan of yours for years -- since I was a kid, really -- and I've seen you grow so much as an artist, businessperson, and person in general haha. You create such light and positivity with your endeavors. Even though I only know this tiny part of you from your public persona, I know in my heart that you and Giovanna are such wonderful people, inside and out. Thank you for all that you do. I will always here to support you. <3
This is brilliant!\n\nCould anyone please suggest songs like this? i mean fun similar genre like this, i barely know about music btw but i enjoy this so much. thank you!
This was great... Tom, when are you bringing out a musical? Everyone will agree it needs to happen.
This Mr Magorium vibe kills me:in a good way.
Absolutely awesome , never disappointed with anything he does he's amazing
Fantastic video Tom - I shall never look at Watford WH Smith in the same way - good luck with your Book Club! x
Wait, I love this???
Channeling your inner doctor a little here Tom?
That was such an amazing announcement video! I loved Clarice Bean as a kid :)
I wish I could be part of your book club Tom!! It looks so fun! 😂
Everyone thinking damn, I wish I was a child again
Why are you so perfect?
Tom that VOICE! When are you gonna be in the West End?? (In your copious spare time, of course)
You're awesome, Tom. It's pretty cool that in every thing you do, I can see plenty of love, care and fun! It's amazing when I have a new notification of a new video of yours. Any of them. It's impossible not to have fun. Congrats, man! The video/song/books are impressive. I admire you the most ♥
I so wanna be like 8

so that's what you've been busy with, Tom. ;)
This is abs brilliant, well done Tom, amazeballs!!!
sometimes i forget how much i love you but then you do something this extra and i remember
Willy Wonka is to chocolate as Tom Fletcher is to children's books.
Tom you just single handedly won the hearts of the UK nation yet again! Such a brilliant campaign & launch video ACE #TomsBookClub inspiration! 🙌🏻 Can't wait to look at your book list for gift ideas for my God daughter and family/ friends you're so awesome!!
Fantastic, my nephew and I will love these. He gets stuck reading the same series and I'm always suggesting new ideas.
Most underestimated human of our generation!! Tom Fletcher you're my hero
As I don't knows any kids old enough for these books I might have to be a part of it myself, we'll just pretend I'm not 18 because this looks absolutely amazing. Well done Tom
If he announces anything in the future without a musical bonanza I'm going to be very disappointed.
Are we just going to ignore the world's worst security guard there?
This is why I love Tom and Mcfly Xxx
This is filmed at my WHSmith 🙋🏼🙋🏼❤🎉🎉
Am I the only one who needs this song on Spotify and iTunes ? Hehe amazing tom can't wait to go and have a look 🎹🎧🎤🎸💞👓👓👓👓👓👓👓
Please say we can buy this song on iTunes?
This was so entertaining!
OH MY Thomas Fletcher you were born to this THANK YOU for this INCREDIBLE PIECE OF ART OMG I'M SO EXCITEDDDD wish I was a kid again to be part of it, can I ?? hahahahahahahahaha\n\nDon't know what else to say.

This was amazing. I want to read those and I'm 20
Does anyone know the name of the guy playing the security guard?
Fab video and song ...you need to make an album please!!
This gave me all the christmassy feels 😂
Always doing great announcement video.
I'd listen to an album of fun children's songs. Haha. This is brilliant! I know it's just an ad song but oh well
If this doesn't get parents and kids reading nothing will, it is awesome!!!!
LOVED THIS ON SO MANY LEVELS !!!
I've literally come back here multiple times to watch it because the song is so catchy.
I'm 15 but this book club sounds amazing
wasn't expecting to see my local WH SMith's in this video :')
When we asked for new music, this wasn't what we meant

Ni el Barça era tan malo por perder la Supercopa ni son los putos amos ahora por meterle 5 al Espanyol. Seamos serios.
Zidane dice voy a ganar la champions sin cristiano ronaldo a ver amigo mío que si hace eso Messi ya te clavo 7 goles y encima empatan contra levante definición de esto: Zidane es decerebrado
Todo mundo ignorable primer gol que es fuera de lugar pero cuando robaldo lo have todos critican jaja

Muchos golitos a equipos humildes pero partidos importantes desaparecidos
Sin duda, messi el mejor del mundo <3
siempre que oigo al campo gritar el gol me dan escalofrios
Deberían ser conscientes de que leo messi se ha convertido en el típico jugador que rinde en Europa pero con su selección es como un cualquier jugador convocable. Una lástima.
Me parece de tontos enseñar que el 1r gol es en fuera de juego, os estais dejando mal a vosotros mismos que no lo pitasteis
Tres jornadas y messi tres palos y 5 goles, y van a tener la poca vergüenza de darle el balón de oro al empujarbitros
Cristiano que pasa mes si es el Puto amo y ahora te enteras jajjaj😂😂😂😄😄
Busquets, Iniesta, Umtiti, Ter Stegen, Jordi Alba, Messi, Dembelé, André Gomez, Paulinho, Semedo, Rakitic, Deulofeu, Suárez y Piqué... Todos estuvieron muy bien; gran juego del Barcelona, con uno que otro pequeño error, pero en general qué buen espectáculo. Este equipo no tiene nada que envidiarle a ningún otro.
Meses de no ver un partido del Barça; regresar y verlos jugar así da placer. Nelson, Ivan, y Lionel en la derecha es excelso.
Y después de la Supercopa de España todos decían que el Madrid iba a arrasar en la Liga.... quién hubiese dicho que en la 3era jornada ya el Barça le sacaría 4 puntos JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA PRAAAAAAAAAAWWW
*Gracias amigo!!*\n#Love from india Barcelona Forever!!!! ⚽⚽
EL ESPANYOL A SEGUNDA OE, A SEGUNDA OE, A SEGUNDA OE, A SEGUNDA E O E...

No voy a comentar el arbitraje porque quien vio el partido sabe que para nada fue justo... Pero estoy muy hasta los cojones de los errores en el arbitraje cuando juegas contra los grandes. Esto hace mucho que dejó de ser la mejor liga del mundo para ser simplemente un show que sólo ganan farsa y mandril, ayudados siempre por el jugador número 12.
Liga adulterada por Villar el corrupto, que aún sigue en su cargo: Presidente de la Real Federación Española de Futbol después de pasar por la carcel y con el juicio abierto aún..... Con VAR el 1° gol de este partido tampoco lo hubiera dado por bueno Aytekin
There's like 3 actual good clubs in La liga, this score line is not worth celebrating

Beautiful speech by a genuine man. Tears are in my eyes. God, I love this country.
What an amazing speech!  What amazing people on flight 93 that day!  They saved so many lives by being brave, and courageous.  I love Vice President Mike Pence.  He shows our country, and all Americans honor, and love for our country.  I'm glad he was spared that day.  Who knows maybe after 2 terms of President Donald J. Trump, he might become our next president.  I sure do hope so!  Thank God for all of the hero's that day on 9/11.  They made all Americans proud to be Americans.  Thank you, Vice President Mike Pence!
WHAT A GREAT MAN OF GOD MIKE PENCE IS...WHAT A MOVING TRIBUTE FROM A MAN WHO LOVES THE LORD
Thank You Mr Vice President!!!!!!!!!! You are the best Vice President Ever. I'm thankful for you and President Trump. God Bless you both and God Bless America
Very moving speech from this administration-finally. Good man. Those aboard Had The Right Stuff. God Bless Them All.
One of the most riveting and heartfelt speeches I've ever herd.  Thank you God for such a great man on earth to lead us.
God Bless!
Best speech ever by our amazing Vice President Mike Pence!!
They prayed the Lord's prayer .. HALLELUJAH !!!
As a Pennsylvania resident I have visited the sacred ground at Shanksville several times on the anniversary of 9/11. My last visit was with my father six years ago. I think I will always regret that I wasn't there again today to have had the privilege to have personally experienced such a heartfelt speech... so beautifully delivered. Thank you Mr Vice President!
He will be President one day!
Innocent blood cries to Almighty God Yahweh, and He always answers. We will defeat the camouflaged evil no matter which name is applied.
Wonder speech by our Vice President!!
Thank you sir
I love this guy.
Almighty God knew the future of this country and His plans for you  (Jeremiah 29:11)  that you would become this countries 45th    Vice President of the United States even 16 years into the future the Lord has and will continue to protect you and your family (Psalms 91)Thank God you are our Vice President Mike Pence!!!\nREPLY
Beautiful speech.
God saved the life of Mike Pence 16 years ago because He was preparing him for the Vice Presidency.
Wow! Previous administration didn't seem to care about 911 victims. MAGA
I admire such a great man! I too hope he has a chance at Presidency some day
Trump/Pence 2020  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

THANKYOU VP Pence. My dad and granddad came from Pennsylvania. Bless you for sharing the heartfelt tribute to the brave men and women who sacrificed to save people in Washington DC.

At 6:28 , whose the disrespectful person looking at his phone?
Those passangers were more braver than well ever be.
I'm sorry guys but This dude's a complete whacko. You know why he's The vice president? Because this guy is a complete head case, people will be less likely to wanna impeach Trump.
my boys will NEVER serve in the military because our military boys are being sent to slaughter for financial gain for politicians and evil doers. Its unfortunate that our military isn't being used for what it is intended. God Bless our military that sacrifice their lives for what they believe in.....we live in a sad world....
mike is such a compassionate and caring man. the usa is blessed that they have him as vicepresident..\nhe is alsoloyal and true. i love you, mike
He sure is more eloquent than the Pres!
If he is so great,why does he not DEMAND a NEW INVESTIGATION? He is a puppet just like the rest of them...

where was the plane, just a hole in the ground.
That is one of the greatest speeches I've ever heard in my life. Very moving.
This is leadership unlike the terrorist lover Obama and his evil team. America we must not allow the Demoncrats to have the keys to this nation again, if we do this country will be ran by terrorist supporters, look who now march with the Demoncrats groups Muslim terroist using racist against Americans to force us to back up and allow them to take control. The demons on the left has many things in common with the terrorist. Hate for America and it's values.
Pence, the biggest lying hypocrite of our times. This man is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The two of them are the biggest con artists we will ever see.... wake up you idiots who drank the kool-aid.....
i love Mike Pence, he should be our President today!
What a beautiful tribute from Vice President Pence. God bless him and God bless President Donald Trump.
Pence is such a stately and stoic historical figure. Should something unforeseen and bad happen to Trump (God forbid), he might be an awesome President for America. He is the quiet yet strong support behind Trump Americans don't always appreciate enough. Blessings to a great country, prayers to the families of all 9/11 heroes.
Pence is just unbelievable when he speaks, he has no presence or character, just like Trump.  If he is so upset about all those who died in 9/11 perhaps he should seek out the truth about exactly what really occurred that day and bring those involved to face justice.  No plane hit the Pentagon and nothing but explosives brought down the other Tower at ground zero (Building 6  I believe), evidence of thermite in the rubble and pouring out the towers before collapse.  Its all a big conspiracy to justify global war for those who would benefit from it.  Justice will never be found for this until there is a President who firmly believes in bringing everyone to account regardless of whom they may be, Rich or Famous.   Until then, every year will result in this nonsense.  The only thing it does is provide a time for reflection for those who were lost, these are the innocent pawns in the USA elite agenda.
what a liar -  no airplane crashed at  Shanksville, pa   0n 9/11/2001  -  the coroner who was  called to the scene that\nday said he found no  body parts,no blood,  no  airplane parts  -  just scrap metal that had been dumped into the hole that was\nalready  in the ground before 9/11/2001 -  because no airplane had crashed at that site  (later this coroner was threatened\nand initimidated into  silence)  -  the US   government is still lying to American citizens  about what happened on 9/11 - it\nwas an inside job by the US  government who murdered 3000 innocent Americans --  and the  families of the victims\nhave no answers and no justice.
WOW THE LYING CREEP PENCE CAN READ A TELEPROMPTER, HE  IS A MINDLESS DRONE, THE PERFECT PUPPET FOR THE CONSERVATIVES
Bless them all why to go vies president pence
yes I agree  he is good but still I wonder if we will ever be able to know the through about what happened   many still doubt .Bush was lying, ,I just don't know  god bless all who lost the lives and the families whos lost the loved once
Pence is a tool and 9-11 was an inside job. The dude is a liar and somebody's bitch.
let them go let them go thats what they did..and you didnt care!  http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/23/inv.investigation.terrorism/    A knowledgeable source said two small knives were found on a Delta flight that was supposed to depart Boston, and a box cutter was found on an Atlanta-to-Brussels Delta flight. These planes didn't take off since all flights were grounded after the hijackings. The tools were found when the planes were searched.\n\nInvestigators say they aren't sure whether the tools found were intended for some sort of innocent use or whether their owners may have had malicious intent. But they say the two planes' passenger manifests have been checked. And investigators increasingly believe that the weapons may have been prepositioned by accomplices for use by others. As one U.S. official told Time magazine, These look like inside jobs.    Following their deportation, both men were charged in India with passport violations.[9] According to the Times of India, the men were accused of obtaining fake passports from a corrupt passport agent, and Khan's true name was Gul Mohammed Shah, and Azmath had listed his age as 50 rather than 30. The Times reported that Azmath's wife, Tasleem Murad, had told them that he was not the first person to misstate his age to obtain a visa and He did not have any evil intentions and he has paid for it already.[10] An additional issue was that Azmath's wife, being Pakistani, did not have Indian citizenship.[9]\nThe 2002 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting[11] was awarded to a September 29 article in the Washington Post by Dan Eggen and Bob Woodward, which mentioned the detention of Khan and Azmath and reported that an anonymous source said that Both men had flight training.[12]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Ayub_Ali_Khan_and_Mohammed_Jaweed_Azmath
His speech truly from the Heart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck0sF5wnH4Q\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32qB7On8ngM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdlEcFfYZ2\nJesse Ventura claims gov’t involved in 9/11   Mar. 8, 2010 at 1:36 PM TODAY books\nIn his new book, “American Conspiracies: Lies, Lies, and More Dirty Lies That the Government Tells Us,” former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura begins an investigative journey to prove that there is more to our national history than the government wants us to know. In this excerpt, he writes about an alleged 9/11 cover-up.Chapter 12: What really happened on September 11?The incident: On September 11, 2001, four airplanes were hijacked on American soil and crashed into the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania.  official word: The 19 hijackers were all fanatic Muslim terrorists linked to al-Qaeda and its ringleader, Osama bin Laden. My take: Our government engaged in a massive cover-up of what really happened, including its own ties to the hijackers. Unanswered questions remain about how the towers were brought down, and whether a plane really struck the Pentagon. The Bush Administration either knew about the plan and allowed it to proceed, or they had a hand in it themselves.I was in my third year as Minnesota’s governor on September 11, 2001. After the devastation of the Pentagon being hit and the Twin Towers falling, I put the National Guard on alert and secured some of our public buildings. The following Sunday morning, we were the first state to hold a memorial for the nearly 3,000 victims. More than 40,000 people showed up on the front lawn of the State Capitol, while a steady rain fell. I’ll never forget Native American shamans beating drums alongside honor guards who represented the police and firefighters and military. It still chokes me up to think about it. Looking out on hundreds of flags fluttering in the breeze, I remember saying at the end of two hours: “We will promote good against evil. And finally, we will together restore our sense of freedom by conquering this enemy!”I never wanted to believe anything different than what our government told us about that tragic day. But here is what John Farmer, a Senior Counsel for the 9/11 Commission who drafted the original report, has to say in a new book: “At some level of the government, at some point in time ... there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened.”What more do we need? Are we willing to live with another lie to go with the Warren Report, the Iran-Contra cover-up, and many other “official” stories?
I was a 911 baby, joined the Marines that December and spent 13 weeks on a Paris Island. What brought down WTCbuilding 7? Was it TNT? Was it all a lie, is Trump going to get to the bottom of this?
this is a great speech by Mike Pence about Flight 93 ... now as go back and visit what happened that day, I have one question.... where's the plane?
MIKE PENCE IS A SATAN WORSHIPPING FAGGOT PEDOPHILE. MIKE PENCE YOU WILL BURN.
Same bullshit brought to you by the next set of liars, If you think 911 was done by 19 Muslim High Jackers\nYou still believe you live on a Pear Shaped Oblate Spheroid Spinning in Space as your leading astrophysicist \nNeil Disgraced Tyson describes it. 911 was done by the same evil group that defends this 500 year deception \nJudaism & Freemasonry. #Globexit.  Peace on the Plane to all Sentient Beings coming to your neighborhood soon
this whole phone call story is BS. Never happened. No plane, no crash.  The supposed phone call was still going on after the plane supposedly crashed. The timeline of the calls is the proof of this story being untrue. I think Pence just does not know.
Lies. more LIES, more and more LIES,  still more stinking LIES and DECEPTION, then more and more stinking and rotting LIES, then more fake emotion to spew more fetid LIES.  WHAT A DISGRACE!!!!
A beautiful homage to our heroes by a beautiful man.
What a great speech for true heroes god bless them and their families
CANADIANS STAND UNITED WITH AMERICA. ....
BULLSHIT, There were no planes on 9/11, more fake news!
Bless the people that lost someone that day..  The masterminds behind this terrible act of domestic terrorism need to be brought to justice, the Saudi guys were just scapegoats to take the blame..
Wow!  It was a very awesome, loving tribute to the fallen men and women (and even an unborn baby) who were on the flight that was headed to destroy the Capitol.  It moved my heart very deeply with renewed grief of what happened on that fateful day.  God bless you, VP Pence!
Good speech. One small thing - though I walk through the shadow of death is Psalms 22, not the Lord's prayer. God bless the heros of flight 93 and their families.
Working and listen to the radio on my earphones.That was the worse day.I was in shock and so was everybody I seen.RIP.😢#Heros#GodBlessAmerica#Alwaysremember#PittsburghPA.
What about the plane that hit building #7?
Nice speech but evidence strongly suggests that the flight 93 story as told to the American people is a myth, but hey it plays to the official narrative.  VP Pence seems to say all the  things  Americans love to hear, but I don't trust him, and wont, until and unless he gets real with us about who was really behind  9-11.   I'm no lover of Islam but 19 Muslim terrorists with box cutters did not do 9-11.  Interestingly the vice president refers to the LORD's prayer but quotes the 23rd Psalm.  Perhaps not the Bible scholar he's reported to be.
All I can say is thank you for this moment.
Thank you for posting this video. \n\nThe speech was moving.
Mike deus volt pence, mike fry away your inner gay pence, mike electroshock your love of cock pence, mike homocaust pence, mike Like it in the crapper? You get the zapper pence, mike feel the itch?

FLIGHT 93. LET'S ROLL....
beautiful speech President Pence!!!!!!!!!!!!
PENCE FOR PREZ!!! NO DOUBT
I personally do not like trump or pence however this speech is truly inspiring and amazing
I have been to Shanksville right after it happened, during construction and after. It's enormous. It's very beautiful, and again, just massive. After time passed, you cannot see where it happened, so there is a giant boulder to represent the area. A beautiful wooden gate on the pathway. It's very surreal. There is a loooong road to get in, one would think you were in a highway, lost. The tower of voices sounds amazing!! It will one of the most incredible monuments once finished. Feds took thousands of acres for it. Pence gave a beautiful, respectful, strong, patriotic and sincere speech. 9/11 still feels like yesterday, and I believe it always will. Thank you Mr. Pence.
with respect , sir, yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me is from the 23rd Psalm, not the Lord's Prayer.   Great speech otherwise. May we never forget or discredit the events of  9/11.
Got to love this man. Thank you Vice President Pence. TRUMP PENCE 2020 2024 2028 2032 USA USA USA
9/11 was an inside job
This is a good, kind and humble man; a true leader and demanding of respect.  This speech moved me deeply. Thank you Mr. Vice President.
wake up dear american fellows, he is lying and sure he knows it. the usa system destroys us all.
I wish he was President instead of Trump.
A plane crashed in Shanksville? Can we see? Donald Rumsfeld said it himself, a plane was shot down. America, WAKE UP
Israel and US agents wired WTC with thermite/explosives.  Planes were allowed to hit those buildings and then those explosives were detonated.\n\nA cruise missile bit the Pentagon.  The missile was shrouded as a small version of a passenger plane.  This plane was remotely flown into the Pentagon.  This explains why the debris field didn't exist at the Pentagon.  Also the reason why the damage to the Pentagon was so small compared to the WTC. Even though the same type of plane supposedly hit the 3 buildings.  \n\nFlight 93 was shot down by military aircraft. \n\nWTC 7 was wired to be brought down.  7 held tons of info on this plan (money, who's involved, etc.)  All evidence was in 7.
When will all citizens realize we live in the most free country in the world why don't we cherish and be humbled by the millions that died knowing it to the point of dying fighting for it.\nWake up before it is to late. PLEASE
i will sell you some snake oil if you believe that lying son of a b nothing but a liar. I hope he go and sat his lying ass down somewhere, yes they were heroes not you.
Pence is a political hack, God help us from politicians like him.
9-11 was an inside job and people of all walks are waking up to these lies!!!!! Will pray for all the innocent lives killed for greed and corruption!!!!!!     We are in new times, let's not forget  the government's deep states evil ways, but support our President and Vice President and hope they make better and more honest decisions to protect their own people!!!!!!
Mike Pence is such an honorable man.  Wow.  He brought me to tears with is speech.   PRAISE GOD HE IS OUR VP!!!
Pissy Pants Pence crying crocodile tears repeating the tired old lies he calls a triumph of freedom to begin the neo-con endless wars that accomplish nothing good only murder and endless bloodshed, what good has come from any of these wars only death, destruction, destroyed nations, long lines of crazed killers invading the West. Pissy Pants sounds like he's just loving his boo hoo hoo propaganda crap for the idiocracy idiots in America hooray hooray more wars, more death, power to the corporate globalists death to me, and my family destruction to all I hold dear.
R U a shill Rshill7?
Can you handle the truth? \nGoogle: America: Freedom to Fascism ( Note where Rockefeller says, On 9/11, there is going to be an event.)\nGoogle: Ex CIA Agent Risks All to Expose the Deep State - Kevin Shipp
But i heard there where no planes , and what about building 7 ? No one is talking about building 777777777777777777777?????
These are for me manmade hurricanes as a result of the extreme climate warming. And President Trump even stopped to protect the climate. Trump makes America poor again. It is a horrible manmade worst scenario. (I have studied climatology at one of the best universities of Europe)
Never forget 911 ; On 911 Israel Killed 3000 Americans
It is confirmed. Melania is a reptilian from the TV series V.
God bless you, the greatest president ever
God bless the USA. God bless President Trump.
Dident Trump reduce FEMA when it was needed the most?\nIdiot.
66. Thats the combined IQ of that orange ape and that east european whore.
Mrs Trump Looks like the Alien woman from V-The Visitors.
Donald Trump is trying so hard to do the right thing and do what's right for America and Americans and all Liberals are doing is trying to shit on him at every turn. I can't wait until 2020 when America rally's behind Trump and liberals are scurrying away like the filthy cockroaches they are. God bless Donald Trump and got a bless the United States of America.
Lives, not money! .....GUARANTEED that quote won't be seen anywhere in the MSM. And imagine for eight years they tried to force feed us the image of elegance and class with Michelle! Oh please! Look at our First Lady now and simply compare. God bless President Trump and his family. God bless the U.S.A.
he IS our president now.  so let's give him some time on this.
14 - 09- 2017 AD From the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad possessor of the Book’s knowledge to the American President Donald Trump, a fact that I do not speak of Allah except the Truth ۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞\n\n From the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad possessor of the Book’s knowledge to the American President Donald Trump, a fact that I do not speak of Allah except the Truth\n\n In the name of the Greatest Bliss that is greater than the bliss of gardens of bliss that is the Bliss of Allah’s goodly-pleasure over His servants which you hate — O community of human satans — O you who hated Allah’s Book the grand Quran and hated what Allah sent therein of Truth but you hate the Truth and you want to extinguish Allah’s light for the worlds that is the grand Quran, in spite that you believe in it, and you are of the witnesses.. \n\n O the American President Donald Trump, you have instigated Allah’s wrath over His Book the grand Quran because of you decision and your determination on fighting Allah’s Book the grand Quran, and you want to extinguish Allah’s light that Allah sent it down as mercy for the worlds, the grand Quran Allah’s light to the entire people, and you are of the witnesses upon this — O the American President Donald Trump to the fact you are not of those who gone astray; in fact you are of those upon whom the wrath is brought down. And I announce to you and your loyal-friends wholeheartedly inside and out — the grievous chastisement, and I hope from Allah to take it away from your loyal-friends whom they seek protection from the evil of Trump; in fact I announce to your loyal-friends whom are of your ilk from the human satans whom they hated Allah’s goodly-pleasure so He made their deeds null (fruitless), so listen to what I say — O the American President of Jewish origin — what I will say purifying it with the vow by Allah the Great Who gives life to bones:\n Indeed, what afflicted you from hurricanes of the swelling sea it is from the intensity of Allah’s wrath against you (as consequent from) your turn away from believing the Awaited Mahdi in of dialogue before the appearing, and Allah would never afflict you with a sign from the consecutive signs of chastisement except it is greater than its sister so be of the witnesses upon that until comes Allah’s command then your necks would remain subdued and you would testify that there is no God except Allah, and Mohammad is messenger of Allah, then your necks would bend in obedience to Allah and His khalifa in the earth and His servant the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, and you announce the repentance and ask forgiveness from Allah my Lord and your Lord, and if you refuse then I announce to you a chastisement of Allah the strongest in punishment at nine O'clock exactly in some day at night or in a daylight, and it might be soon, so flee from Allah to Him, and serve Him Alone, no partner for Him, and do not say that Allah is third of three, desist is better for you — O community of Christians; in fact He is One God glory be to Him above what they associate (with Him), and we worship Him, we do not make distinction between anyone of His messengers, and we are Muslim-submitter to Him. o our Allah, I have delivered the message. O our Allah, bear witness. So if you turn away then wait surely I am too with you of those who wait. \n ..And peace be upon the sent ones, and praise be to Allah Lord of the worlds .Allah's khalifa and His servant; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni\n ____________\n ۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞www.the-greatnews.com/showthread.php?32400-
They don't even talk to each other - but I hear they have great sex- \nMelania  “That’s true, we have a great, great time.”
President Trump please end the epidemic of fatherless kids in USA. Obama supported welfare states/foodstamps & deadbeat parents' amnesty.
I thought Michael Jackson was dead ????he's with trump !!!!
Melania is like the female Terminator, Badass.:)
Has Science have discovered God?\n\nBased on the Harvey and the Irma hurricanes destructive effect on the state of Texas and the state of Florida plus the raging fires of California we could say that God is real and whenever man says that his laws, here in the United States of America, should be above the laws of God then we all get into big, big trouble.\nFor instance, according to the Bible, God made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day (Exodus 20:11). Therefore, God’s authority of how things should be done on earth is much higher than the authority of President Trump, the United States Congress and the United States Supreme Court of Justice and above the authority of all American voters put together. When non-believers in God, as described by the Bible, atheists, secularists and evolutionists take the Bible out of the public square and out of public teaching the influence of God’s Holy Spirit is greatly diminished within the American population and the United States, like other nations where God’s Ten Commandments are ignored and violated generates many assassins, rapists, thieves and people making false accusations against others.\nFor instance, places where we have people with widespread lack of knowledge of who Jesus and His Apostles were plus their specific teachings such as in the Key West, Florida, the crime index measures the rate of crimes in any area on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the safest areas. This area earns a two on that scale. In other words, 98 percent of areas in United States of America are safer than this one, making it the most dangerous area in Key West and one of the most dangerous in the nation. Moreover, places where Jesus’ teachings are widely ignored such as in Houston Texas, we will find out that Houston’s murder numbers are posted for 2016 and they remain at a five-year high. Records show 302 people were killed 2015, leaving behind families who were ripped apart. You'll find that the occurrence of violent crime in Houston, TX is 135% higher than the average rate of crime in Texas and 159% higher than the rest of the nation. Those crimes are committed because God’s authority is diminished in the hearts and minds of people that are highly unfamiliar with God’s Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3-17 and the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the New Testament in the Bible
Did the Russians write it for him
Lives not money \nTell that to the people that can't afford healthcare.
Harvey and Irma Hurricanes have taken away  all the Bad News Media about the  Things Happening to Trump.
Coast guard..if you talk about branding ?  no brand has improved more than the Coast guard ..BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA..yeah i think they've done well since ..1792.LOL  as Bugs puts it..what a maroon.
Thank God we have a President who really cares and wants to save lives. Not playing  golf like...
*IMPEACH THIS MIDDLE EAST KILLER OF MUSLIMS WAR CRIMINAL TRUMP!*
Melania never has anything to say. Does Donald ever let her speak? She just follows along like a stepford robot. Hides behind those glasses looking uncomfortable. ????
the brainless loony trolls are out today... guess soros is paying them to act like goons online too. BAHAHAHA sorry you lil pussies need to realize President Trump is gonna president for 8yrs whether you throw you temper tantrums and wet your panties.\n\nSTOP BEING SORE LOSERS but then again, when you don't have any accomplishments in life and nothing to look forward to, I guess being a SORE LOSER is the only thing that keeps you going! \n\nmust suck to look in the mirror everyday and see nothing but a pure Grade A loser staring back and hating your own existence! your daddys must not have weened ya off the peet because ya actin like a bunch of whiny pussies who need to go suckle on it!
Lives not money. Glad to have a president that really means that when he says it, unlike the ones before.
Like how he ended it but I'm not a trump supporter, trump was not a dick rare
haha he waits until he gets a bad question then he's fed up.
i CAN'T END MY DAY WITHOUT COMMENDING MRS TRUMP.. MELANIA TRUMP HAS BECOME SOMEONE I SO GREATLY ADMIRE.  OUTWARDLY SHE HOLDS THE CARDS ON BEAUTY...BUT THE LADY IS JUST SO ENDEARING... VERY MUCH I RESPECT HER.
The President is always on the Job !!   First time in the last 29 years !!       *M.A.G.A. !!*
Trump should have gone onstage and said 9/11 was an inside job
At last something really big mr Trump, it's called; Due to Global warming. !,
I like Trump BUT he fuckin needs to learn how to god damn talk better than a todler. JESUS man its so bad i wanna cry
Please , Melania ! Take OFF SUNGLASSES .!!!!!!!!! I've been seen you most of time wearing sunglasses \n Do you have a EYE problems ??
Humble suggestion: Hurricanes will cease if we follow the teachings of love of Jesus Christ with undocumented and dreamers.  Apply now.
Love this conservative president, much better than the liberal Hollywood puppet.
He's got a lot of class
Melanie you looking awesome in RED shirt with pockets.........Really smart and gorgeous First Lady
Happy that he can go golfing.
Obama didn't allow Jesus to send bad hurricanes to the United States when he was president.  Trump can't even make deals with his lard and slavior, Jesus fucking Christ.
the coast guard is a brand?
So nice to have a first lady that has nice ass, follows her husband and just shut up
For a moment I thought Melania Trump was going to ask: Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie???
Quit with the great shit...he don't know words ...What a dope.
hurricane trump is a bad path to be in.....fake response to fake storm. fake news, fake president, climate change is fake.
nothing like a good shower for these american pigs to clean up their racism. hope many of you die bastards.
Why did Trump have to create this hurricane?  He is so hateful...
LMAO!!!   Geeeeez!!  This Clown ALWAYS opens his mouth and says absolutely nothing!!!!  Yuh... we're coordinated.  The Coast Guard is incredible.  We're having meetings.  People should get out of its way   WHAT AN IDIOT!!!!   Specifically what coordination is being done?  Specifically where can victims go for help and specifically what is available to them?  Specifically what messages does FEMA have for the residents?   This total joke of a president is the most clueless person who has ever walked the face of the earth!!!!!
We're worried about lives not money - then walks away like a BOSS!
Reporters stupid question  : HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST  ?  Trumps perfect answer : We are not worried about money but about lives !\n\n\n\nstupid questions needs my stupid answer as well : Yeah it is gonna cost a lot of billions , let's sit down now and discuss the numbers please, thank you for asking. Let me kick your fucking ass first , \nYOU ARE FIRED you stupid fuck
Coast guardsmen along with lawenforement are taking weapons from house to house at gun point. Should remind everyone that the United States Corporation  is just that, a psychopathic, parasitic Dead Entity Corporation that is commiting War Crimes against Men and Women suffering the effects of these storms. \n\nCriminal as it gets. Fired!!!
It's not just trump\n\nThe Republican Party is a Weapon of Mass Destruction\n\nhttp://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/07/29/the-republican-party-is-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/
President Trump, why are you exaggerating about the storm.  I trusted you to be honest.  Please tell the truth about this 9-11 storm
Bingo Trump (as he is known by other diplomats in Europe)  has freakishly tiny hands.
Wow, this comment section is filled with anti-trump bots.
Branding are you serious! WTF. Leave it to trump to make bush and clinton look good.
HNN, re-read both of your statements.\nYOU sound like an idiot or an illegal.
If I could post a photo I would show ya Irma is a rainy windy bitch.
 I'm going now to meetings. \n\nAKA......... I'm going to play golf again.
Hey Trump It's Sunday aren't u and the little miss going 2 church?!!!
The wife dress up like Micheal Jackson style 😂😂 oh and fuck that old can't even talk normal!
GOD BLESS  all in the path of the Hurricane!!!
Bush - as un-statesman like as he was, relatively speaking, at least made an effort to be empathetic, clumsily so. This orange jerk thinks empathy is a building where foreign diplomats live - oh shit; get it? That just came to me while doing my daily dose of bashing The Idiot Trump. Pretty good, huh? Empathy/Embassy.....I humbly crack myself up sometimes - but it's a discrete, quick-witted humor...don't y'all think... blah blah blah...lol.
What i find discusting is that while people have no power shelter or food due to hirricanes the markets reaction is to scream higher! Proof that human life has no bearing on profit. Do people in miami really want the dow hitting new highes or do they need help.
Did I hear DACA?, the liberals are back! Send them to the path of IRMA😄👍
LOVE MY PRESIDENT AND FLOTUS!! PRAYING FOR THEM EVERYDAY!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸👏🏾👏🏾
Melania is so hot! He could be golfing and enjoying life on a yacht with helicopters and college girls in bikinis but he chose to work for us, the American people for free.  We have not been this lucky since 1776 when the billionaires of the day decided to give up personal pursuits, putting their lives at risk, for us the american people.
Lying racist Trump uses the vocabulary of a 5th grader. This unpresidential orange man never seems to have the slightest clue what he is talking about. Trump is a con man, a total FRAUD, he takes credit for Obamas achievements and distorts the facts or completely lies about a lot of topics. He is unstable and unfit to lead this country. Trump harms the USA and should be impeached immediately. WORST PRESIDENT EVER.
0:55\nto mar a lago, to pocket even more taxpayer dollars
That's my President 😉👍  and look at his fine looking wife too!!!😉👍
We are with you Mr Trump
Good job Trump. Now build the damn wall.
MSM & Hollywood hates him but (at least half) the American people love him. I find that so fascinating to watch that dynamic every day. I'm not American so I don't have a horse in this race but for about 2 years now its been riveting. Thank you USA for proving that reality is more interesting than fiction. But, unlike fiction, it doesn't have to make sense.
We're worried about Life's not cost See this is a real president Donald J trump God Bless him and his family .Our 1st lady is beautiful as always God-bless her to And the people of Florida
Damn she is super cute. Trump should hold her hand and be more romantic in public.
Grats on your retard Pissident
Fuck donald Trump
Trump 2020
What an idiot.
good video
Cobrarme vergaze.
Call it Imer again dumb fuck

greatest president ever!
Hi Melania..love your outfit!! God Bless..
NICE SHADES MELANIA IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL FLOTUS
What a pimp!
Trumps the best!
Trump!!!  2017  From Canada!!!
what a f***ing moron
First lady looks unusually fine!!
Go Trump! Fuck Liberals
Best President ever!
Trump is a goat abortion of a human being. What a turd
Haha Melania doesin't want to even speak to the media. But I mean look at the way they treat her! Good job!
Americans whinge a lot. You have a great President.
Trump just makes shit up on the spot. Hilarious
I'm afraid liberals are going to  get their wish. Trump already looks bad. That is an indication he cares about the people of this country. If you have a conscience, and you are the President of The United States, and you care about the people of this country, when you leave office, you will have visible signs of aging all over your face. Trump is already there. Slick Willie and Barack Hussein Hitler Anti-Christ Obumma didn't seem to have been bothered by a conscience at all.
Melania   is  kreativeti & beauty🌷
Trump is amazing!  The Democratic party is crumbling.
Trump looks bit like Boris Johnson!
MELANOMA IS A WHORE... DRUMPF IS A CROOK... TRUMPANZEES ARE DUPES
I love the idea that he has been having all of these adventures.. with his shoes untied.
You're starting to grow man. Been here since Dolan Dark memed your swimming video.
I think it would be amazing if the duct taped shoes remained in continuity that way for the entirety of the rest of the videos.
HowToBasic meets AlanTutorial
I am VERY ANGRY. This channel PISSES ME OFF!!\n\n\nWhy the hell doesn't this guy have more subscribers?! Seriously! This shit is amazing!
Added you guys to our sub box. Content is too good not to support. Cheers fam.
IDEA: ironing my clothes, shirt, trousesrs etc.
You idiot you dropped your plant
Just checked, this channel has a page on TVTropes. You've made into the larger sphere of pop culture! Congratulations!.
Same problem solving skills as Donald Duck in the old Disney cartoons. I love it!
The grunts this guy makes though
Best ad 2017 by far. Not even mad.
That's one way to input an ad without pissing people off
Awwww it was good but it was to short
My roommate walked in on me duct taping my shoes today, it was very awkward...
i liked your other videos but not this one
I love how you take the most mundane things and turn them into something fun.
You're like the guy from the infomercials who fails the easiest tasks: Are you tired of struggling with <easy thing>?. Great videos dude.
Not sure if you've heard of it, but there's this video site called YouTube, where you can probably look up how to tie your shoes. It'll\nshow you step by step. Get it? Step? Shoes? I'll go home.
I hope you do more something goes wrong soon instead of you getting really weird with how you do X, I miss mishaps like when you tried learning to swim or played with a frisbee
This was the best integration of a SquareSpace sponsored video ever!!!!!
I watch you since your first video on your channel - since you had no more than 10 subs - I hope I can be with your journey for a longer time and see how your channel grows :3
This was nothing short of amazing.
I was expecting the shoes to explode or something, but alright he nailed it.
He caught the run-away plant!
You are the GOD of crazy
this channel is Similar to how to basic channel but way better and less Disgusting
I like The Effort Keep up the Videos man
I knew it. I absolutely knew tying his shoes would become a subject at one point. Just surprised he didn't injure himself worse yet.
Wait, hold on. Are those Air Force 1s? I didn't know they still made those. I wore them in the 5th grade. Damn.
He really dedicates a lot of time/money for these videos. Bought a plant and broke it immediately in his house and had to clean it up. Then he completely ruined 2 pairs of shoes and wasted tape. (I mean wasting tape isn't that serious but still) Definitely a great channel and I'm glad that I found you. Keep up the great work! :)
Did you try turning your shoes on and off first?
He's overrated. Don't deny this- you know it's true.
This is probably the happiest ending I've seen in one of his videos so far.
You can't tie a shoe but you can tie the string to the needle lol
I have a strong hung this guy's April Fools video will be Making Scrambled Eggs and will be a completely normal video of him making eggs.
016 everyone did that at one point
He made ads entertaining...\n\nLet me repeat that\n\n\n\n*HE MADE ADS ENTERTAINING*
best integration on an add I've seen on YouTube thus far
Was expecting a dark twist...
I love how the website at the end looks like something from 15 years ago. I guess it's a shity website maker.
I found this one a bit lacking, There aren't any effects.
That's the most elegant ad that I've ever seen.
Make a short about traveling back in time, but constantly going to the wrong dates, like around dinosaurs and such.
Making a Face reveal video, but you can't turn around the gopro or camera. (Lenny)
You clearly have internet access because we see you using Squarespace, so why don't you just Google it?
Stop sounding like how to basics....good content...could be more original grunting!? :/
I like that you are willing to make such a mess in your house for the sake of your videos.
Or, you could just not wear your shoes indoors haha
I love your channel!!!!! 😀😀👍🏻
Keep on dude, I f* love your stuff, and clever way to add the advertisement ;D \nLike it <3
I love that you put content into the sponsor too!
No, no, man. You're doing it all wrong.\n\nYou do a loop-de-loop and pull, then your shoes are lookin' cool!
I expected him to go for a walk after putting duct tape on his legs, and walk into a building with a no shoes sign!😂
We need more creative and original creators like you. Wish you were more well known 😊
HA YOU CANT TIE YOUR SHOES THAT MEANS YOU'RE STUPID HA HA
For those who don't know, the website at the end is real. It's whatishappeningtome.com .
Idk whats more impressive, the fact he cant tie shoes, or the knots he makes when he messed up
While still good, I think episodes are getting more lame on the way. If you have to take more time for original ideas, please do. Twice a month is fine as well. Good luck on your endeavors :)
Wait. He couldn't just slip on the already-tied green shoes? xD
I legit thought of you making a video on this topic on Thursday XD
This is the first person view of Mr. Bean.

dude this guy is my favorite youtuber
I'm sorry for saying this, but the obvious sponsor plugs are too much in this one. I love your work, and you do a great job, but just because you have a sponsor doesn't mean you have to compromise your idea... I have told a lot of people about your videos, and hope you get the recognition you deserve, but if this is the route that it is going I feel like I've also let a lot of folks down. Just saying, obviously.
Didn't actually expect whatishappeningtome.com to be real, it is.
Im a 23 year old human male, yet I still dont know how to tie my shoes. (While I did learned how to, after a year after graduating High School I pretty much forgot how to)
A while back I saw this on creators on the rise, I watched one video and couldn't stop. This is great channel. If you dont reach 100k or even a million, its just because people don't know about ur channel. Imma spread your channel around YouTube. I hope you have a great day :D
Your videos are amazing, but too infrequent to become popular. Start a 4/5 days a week schedule and you'll be golden.
this video was nearly 50% ad, do not go down that road please
fuck squarespace
Now I want the fine brothers to do a lyrics breakdown video of this, I'd love that
I love how in the song she says us as if Kirstie's with us in these situations 😊☺️😌
The like, last two scenes with the final text and the empty swing really hurt me for some reason
This is amazing and I'm absolutely astonished!\nAmazing voice, deep message, it can't get anymore impressive.
I like how it showed a man being abused by a woman. It shows men can be hurt too, and not just women.
SHE IS SO UNDERRATED. I CAN'T
_i cried until the end of the video. I cry at how she's a queen. I cry at how she's a goddess. I cry at how beautiful she sounds when she sings. I cry at everything she does amazingly--_
Kirstin is a real life goddess
SHE IS SO GORGEOUS OMG CAN I BE HER
this song reminds me of the pain, the insults, and the racial slurs i've overcome for the past five years
Now we need a mv for Something Real pleeeaaase
I love u so much 😭😍
Holy hell that was incredible.
I'm crying. This is amazing.
I keep listening to this song and every time I do, I find the lyrics more and more powerful. That's the best word for this entire piece - powerful.
I'm speechless... This was absolutely beautiful!
Yasss girl the best song ever!!! Left me in tears
Can the mainstream ideology change?
I can relate to this video so much 😭😭😭😭 I'm getting bullied rn, both cyber & physical 😭
[Verse 1]\nI see my name has been in your mouth\nWell, spit it out\nAnd in a conversation, don't you wanna say\nWhat you think about it?\nI love when I hear something new about me\nOoh, I never knew about me, like they do\nI wonder if another storm is gonna wash me out\nBut now I'm drowning in the news, in the news\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, they're so cold\nAnd they don't need a cause\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nOh, I can't fit their mold\nNo, we can't take on that walk\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nWe are not at all\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're another disaster, just another one spinning out\nIsn't that some shit?\nAnd isn't it convenient, whenever you wanna say something\nThey wanna listen now\nBut won't ever repeat or ever tell how they found out?\n[Chorus]\nYeah, they're so cold\nAnd they don't need a cause\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nOh, I can't fit their mold\nNo, we can't take on that walk\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nWe are or not at all, are or not at all, are or not at all\n\n[Verse 3]\nKnow that I'd be lying\nIf I said it didn't get to me\nThe way they keep me victim of their rudimentary convo\nOh, they talk so much\nAnd I wish I could run away but maybe there's no escaping\nAll their silver tongues\nShoot the shit, tie the noose, hang the noose\nMake sure I don't tell no one\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, they're so cold\nAnd they don't need a cause\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nOh, it's all my business\nThere's nothing we control\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nWe are or not at all, are or not at all, are or not at all, oh\nWe are or not, we are, we are or not at all

Kirstie is an inspiration to all
Kirsten don't listen to the haters
The music video changed my perspective on this song. She did amazing I'm shook. 🔥😍
what is that weird instrument in the background? It sounds like a machine gun.
This is one of the first music videos that has made me feel something. Thank you Kirstin I love you so much 💕
okAY QUEEN?! COME THE FUCK THROUGH?!
I love the ending soooo much. Are you there *swing is empty* UGHHH I caried
Want to cry now. Thank you. It's lovely.
This is amazing but I gotta say I don't get why she's on a swing. There's gotta be a deeper meaning that I'm just not getting there.
Really surprised her PR team didn't advise her to wait at least a week or so to release this...a song called bad weather with lyrics of being washed away by a flood right after two record-setting hurricanes? That's...pretty tacky.
OMG I loved that so much incredible job :)
Kirstin has the voice of an angel!!
Shes SOO beautiful...........I love her and her music SOOO much
I'm personally not a huge fan of Kirstie's solo stuff, but this video is GORGEOUS and the lyrics are really beautiful / important. Ily Kirstie, keep slaying, queeeen <3
Holy hell, my girl in dat dress. I forgot she was ever in a group, slayin the game all by herself. Gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is beautiful i got chills at the end
YO HER VOCALIZATIONS IN THIS THOUGH. And these lyrics man. This is so good. I feel blessd
the world has to see this.
Wow SHE DID THAT
Fckkkk mannnn! All her videos make me want to always rub one out! Damn she is super sexy! Those boobs tho! 😍😘🌹
OMG! I can't deal. This is so empowering, this whole music video breathed life to the message of anti-bullying and standing up for yourself, and it really tugged at my heartstrings, so... Thank you so much for being an inspiration to all of us, Kirstin! This is phenomenal.
Love me from Iraqi
How can someone call kirstie a slut when she's that flawless (yes I know it's for the video)
The empty swing at the end sends a really powerful message, please watch what you say, others people words do not define you, you define yourself !!
This song has such a powerful message!!! Amazing!!!
I FUCKING LOVE IT !
Waited all day just to see this video and it was honestly so powerful and worth the wait ❤️
This song brought me to tears! Absolutely love it and the message behind it!
👍
Amazing 😍😍
Kistin that was beautiful 💖✨💖💋💯💯💯💯💯💯
What happened at 3:25 ?
Beautiful ...

HOWWWWWW KIRSTIN CAN YOU BE SOOOOOO TALENTES
BEAUTIFUL ❤️
KIRSTIE IS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!😍😍😍😍
I'm sobbing lmao
I'm OBSESSED
Omfg
I really like this song - by far her best solo song IMO - but I don't like how she acts as 'kirstin'. Before with PTX she was cute and fun and smiling, now she seems like a pouting, wannabe sex kitten. Her other songs were way overproduced too and the TM thing strikes me as hella pretentious.  (Not hating, I'm a big PTX fan and always liked K and still appreciate her talent as a vocalist.  I'm just sad about how she's changed.)
I'm crying cause she's so pretty but her music video shattered my heart cause I've been there before and trust it's hard but if no one loves you, the only person that loves you is yourself.
The music is too loud and you can't actually understand half of what she's singing... :( Bring back the crisper clearer Kirstin. Beautiful video though!
is she some sort of pop star?
Oh wow...this is intense.
Your videos are always entertaining and educational. Good work dude.
You butchered the word Thames lol good video though.
What would be considered disorderly when it comes to flirting?  Who judges and where do they draw the line, lol?  That might come in handy these days at times!
I dont remember a single thing he said
I feel like lottery winners go broke quick unless they are smart about it
Nearly 100% of all people have atleast one brown eye.
For #24 don't you mean a V8 not an V and F1 or Formula E instead of F3 wheels?
#48 Bilingual study done in Montreal finds that it's better to be bilingual, shocker... :P
If you did not know, many other european contries were actually way ahead of Norway to use digital radio, but they never turned off the FM. And than stopped ising digital radio, to go back to only rely on FM radio
How do spell the mud ball thing? I want to look it up
At the moment you've blown our minds 4.400 times
The first one about the lottery is because us Americans are brainwashed at very young ages to believe in The American Dream, which is bullshit. I believe the vast majority of Americans work hard as fuck and still struggle to pay our bills, like me.
Human body is 37 degrees celsius....so no milk coming out of a cow(also a living thing for those of you who didn't know) being 37.8 is normal and also not crazy hot or whatever.
Also, in Moffat, Scotland you'll find the world's skinniest hotel. Or, we like to think that anyway.
Looking good with that California tan lol
Matt you should make a top 10 worst medieval times torture devices
2018 will be the first year since 2007 to start on a monday.
Whoever said they wouldn't quit their job if they won the lottery I hate you😑
Guys if you can come check out my channel and subscribe i will sub back lets support each other :)
I know someone who has gorgeous green eyes and their Asian
I have 1 fact ... my balls touch my legs
These videos were made for night owls lol.
I started watching this channel when there were only 19 50 amazing facts.
Just realized why I zone out on all these facts videos. That back ground music is distracting.
It's pronounced tems river :p
This channel fell off
Hey Man , you're such a genuine and legit guy and you're my inspiration, thanks for making such awesome and enjoyable videos 😊
450k views in two days with 5 mill subs.  Ohhhhhh dear
Matthew you didn't add your most recent videos at the end
Nice to see Matthe still does original content that no other YouTube channels do 😂
Greetings from Norway! Been here since 78k! Love your vids
Why did you go back to the metric system
#88? Need a new series Matt?
in 11th grade. i've learned more from him than what school taught me. that's sad lmao
I feel like some of these are from horrible histories!
isnt he the guy that takes those facts word for word off a website ? not sure where i read that tho, or heard that.
I'm an American and a germophobe I knew I couldn't trust those around me to be clean.
really Mat? you could have just said a wine barrel can hold 60 gals equivalent to 300 bottles.
Only a slave mentality individual would continue working after a lotto win.
I go home at night and say to my husband, Know what I learned today?  lol he always rolls his eyes but listens anyway.
Lmao I always wash my hands after using the thrones but I mainly just use soap if the water just isn't enough....
I'm sorry... the Tame river?
I love when statistics are given in a huge range like the butterfly scale efficiency. Let me try one - The average house hold income in america is between $1 and $1,000,000,000 (source: because I said it).
There is a Bearcat?
50 amazing stolen facts, because you can't think of your own ideas.
You learm something everyday ... Like Matt dosen't know how to pronouce Thames correctly :P  It's not tames, the A sounds like an e so it's tems.
Headache expert? That's a thing?
These videos must be so hard to make wonder how long he can keep it up
Thanks for the video :)
No idea how La La Land wo so many awards. The movie was so shitty
Fact number one: what a sad life....
On behalf of Norway, thanks for shedding more and more light on us, so the world knows we're not dull xD
The way he said St. Louis...
Can't wait what you will create for Halloween! Sweet videos, man!
😵this is jake Paul every like is a kick to his balls\n /|\and one more video of facts\n /\
La La Land won all seven nomination of Golden Globe Awards and yet Moonlight manage to take away Oscar
Hi Matt, so I watched someone react to your abuse story since I couldn't find it from your main channel. And I want to say I am so sorry for what you have experienced. I haven't been in that problematic situation, but I can tell from your voice and the way you acted that it was really bad. And I want to say you have a lot of guts to go out and tell your story. You are a legend, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
SUPRESSORS NOT SILENCERS you literally said it's not possible to silence a gun
Still copying the lists I see
La La Land. Was just Hollywood licking it's own balls.
That cows day is on my birthday
I haven't watched him in years but the first thing I noticed is that he grew his beard out... that out of everything else
Uh oh Keem star beard is building\n\n\n\n\nMay God save us from the keemledge whale
As always you make me laugh . Your videos are so entertaining, the information as well as your charisma and your playfull way to do it. Thanks again Matthew.
if your life revolves around your job, you need a real life\nhand soap is a waste of time and money
Bonus Fact: The has now told 4,400 facts!
Great Video!!!But that's nothing new
I love your videos, but I do have a correction for this one (just because I know you love these facts and I'm sure you pride yourself on getting as much information as you can).\nThe Inca were not around 6000 years ago (they existed from about the 13th century until they were conquered in 1572); their ancestors (of which there were many tribes ethnically and culturally different than the Inca) would have first domesticated alpaca
I can't wait until number 100! Your the best
Come back to channel after ages, beard is looking ThICC man <3
we Indians also used to make mud balls in our childhood !
Hey, Matt.  I've been watching this channel ever since your 6th 50 Amazing Facts video.  I love tuning in because not only do I learn something new every time I watch, but I can always get a good laugh out of it, too.  Keep it up.
Santoro back it again with face expression! Best Educational video, keep it up!!
Boosted efficient by 16-82%? What kind of statement is that yo....
St Louis is not in Wisconsin
I actually knew about the ultimate penultimate
Nice work bro , keep it up,✌❤

Thank God it was a lidl explosion
I made my password Jake paul. It said it was too weak
Gosh! It's like 9/11 all over again.
Right who left there vibrator on 😤😤😂
It was on the tv so it must be true , they wouldn't lie to us .
This comment section is disproportionately filled with morons, from the conspiracy nuts acting like they can tell it's a hoax from their *extensive* training and personal experience with *real* explosives, to the mouth-breathing troglodytes grumbling for another crusade despite not having the balls to be on the front line if that were (bizarrely) to actually happen, to the islamic apologist arseholes trying to deflect attention away from *their* death cult and towards someone else's.
Why film it when you can stop it?
So they record the fire starting.. But not the people who got off.?? 🤔 Probably edited 🤔🤔
Was it actually an explosion or just a small fire?\n\nWas the resulting hospitalizations from the explosion or the stampede?
what a stupid terrorist. they don't even know, how to plan terrorist attack..lol
Is that right before the bomb exploded or after?
This has nothing to do with Islam, Islam is a religion of peace!
There go those pesky Buddhists at it again
This is when lefties stun me. At what point do you recognise a problem? How many more attacks by muslims trying to kill people like you before you just accept reality?
Obviously some Muslim kids trying to recreate what their daddy's did
People still have Note 7’s?
Ah muslims at it again
I have no idea why they'd use an incendiary bomb it seems cruel
So instead of stamping out the fire they'd rather film it? Good ol' human race ladies and gentlemen.
Right guys, let's get away and let's move to right to the end of the platform ... because a small bag is on fire and it could wipe out the station 🙄
Wait.. how did 30 people get injured by that..?
Surprised YouTube isn't trying to hide this Aloha Snackbar attack like they usually do, and then promote the late night anti Trump comedians.
Theres a potential terror attack!.... lets get my phone out \n\n\nBellends
It's probably just a 1st generation galaxy note 7
Ooo let's film it, shall we?
We all know it's a Note 7
So someone was still using the Note 7. Good job.
Did no one think What if there's another one? And get out?
2017 year of terror attacks can't wait to see what 2018 will be like
burn me some more. I love being homeless. doesn't everyone?
Sub to me for a sub back!!!
Subscrube to me if you are reading this
Seems like all a terrorist needs to do is set a burning bucket down with a timed explosive and all the moronic people will flock to it out of curiosity like moths to a light. Stupidity kills.
People says morons stayed and record but in reality they are just curious like every human being. Or almost every.
Looks like a bombproof Lidl bag probably made from the same material as the passports found on 9/11 which were more fire resistant than steel.
I posted my first vlog I would love it if you checked it out and subscribed xxx
appears to be a failed pressure cooker bomb.
So many great contenders for this year's Best actor in a crisis performance at next year's Oscars, and it isn't even October.
Great idea standing next too it, what if it just exploded...
It's a bomb
I'm confused WHY WOULD YOU GO TOWARDS A FLAMING BUCKET?? I WOULDVE RAN AND BEEN LIKE: HAAAAA NOPE
Blame the muslims
If a white man done it then it's not a terrorist attack lol
All Muslims are peaceful, if we lay down our weapons the terrorist will give in
Yeah this bucket on the subway doesn't look suspicious at all!!!!!!
Samsung Galaxy Note 8\nNo big deal
ISIS have come out and said that they are the ones involved in this...
It saw the new Jake Paul song
WE STILL WERE MOURNING BARCELONA SPAIN !!
did he use the note 7?
Get all the Muslims out.
Please stop making england bad this isn't good guys
Terrorism doesn't exist, it's murder. People paint it as terrorism, but what makes terrorism terrorism? It's murder and should have the same charges. If you take away the importance of those crimes, they'll happen less frequently.
It was a Samsung note
what happens when you let muslims/refugees in your country well done you deserved it
Most likely the new note 8
This is what happen to the country when a country is full of Middle Eastern, Africans and so forth.  A country with continuous terrorist attacks and innocent civilians died. Just look at France and England is not far behind. In Europe alone, France and England seems to be the most popular destinations for terrorist attacks. Welcome to Countries of Terror.  Do you ever see Netherlands, Denmark or Sweden made the headline worldwide that there's a terrorist attack? Not this year or the previous years. But France and England has.  Soon, Europes are going to be swamped by terrorists!  \n\nToday, I was sitting in a restaurant and I happen to sit next to a Muslim woman covered from head to toe, except her eyes were not covered. She was eating a chicken with lots of sauce on it. It's horrifying to see the way she eats. It's torturing. How can a person in a free country still live like that? I can't comprehend. \n\nI don't support Trump, but I think it's for the best that he ban those muslim countries. They bring nothing but destruction wherever they set foot. \n\nI want to take this moment to say THANK YOU to the soldiers and fallen soldiers (men and women) who fights and fought for freedom for our country, and make it the world's best living country where you have a life and a future. Long life freedom and respect for women.
Society these days!!!lets all stand around and film rather than get away......honestly

Wait so that device exploded and threw fireballs left and right yet the paintwork and seats remained perfectly intact? \n\nThe government are getting lazy man, I guess they know that we will believe anything
আসুন আমরা একে অপরের ভিডিও দেখিএবং চ্যানেল সাবস্কাইব করি
FAKE
Easy solution ban chemistry from school it teaches you how to make explosives plus monitor all internet activity everybody should be under surveillance forget about freedom of speech and action.
We who believe in equality and freedom MUST band together and RESIST ISLAM, the greatest threat to humanity in our years. Humanity could be COMPLETELY DESTROYED in a few decades if we do not take care of Islam ONCE AND FOR ALL. Islam and Muslims must be stopped, they cannot continue to exist.
that why i will buy one 😂😂
That's very right!
Doesn't matter. People are TOO stupid to not buy a $1000 crappy phone because it is trendy and all the rich people on TV and the internet, told me to buy it.
No offense to anyone who buys this phone (and this isn't anything against Apple, although I don't really like their products personally) but if you think this phone is expensive, DON'T BUY IT! \nSeriously, consumers are so stupid sometimes. You complain about shit being too expensive and then you buy it. Don't you get it? You're ruining it for everyone else because other companies see this and then they jack up their prices too.\nOnly an absolute dumbass would buy a phone that costs the same as a mid range laptop. And this is coming from an electronics enthusiast who has spent more money on electronics than most people commenting here. \nGeezus, idiots ruin everything for everyone. 😒
I just realized that I really don`t need another iPhone (8 or 10). I will use my i7 and I`m happy. So that`s it for me, have a great day all! :)
It amazes me that people buy into the hype of this rubbish. I'm a little older than the majority of you so i tend to think a little bit more about the implications of having such a device, literally no point in me voicing my opinion though as many of you will be SJW's, snowflakes and loony liberal morons, so i'll just say this....George Orwell 1984 just give them everything and pay for the pleasure :) Morons breeding morons.
Lmao this is exactly what is was like when the 6 and 7 came out but everyone loved it after all the hate blew over just give it like 2 months after its released.
I'm just chilling here with my samsung J5 perfectly happy (:

i kinda wish iphone X would have screen like galaxy from samsung it would be better instead having that black bar in the middle and the status bar on iphone more like xiaomi like clock on the left area and the rest on the right area, and face unlock is still very not good these days i rather choose iphone 8 instead iphone X just because touch id is far better and you don't have that ugly cut out if i want something with infinity display i rather buy LG G6 or samsung S/note 8 just because it has better display, design and also price
IPhone X doesn't even look like Apple it doesn't even have the classic round home button!\n\nSamsung is best!
So everythingapplepro comes to the conclusion he's still going to purchase new iPhone...even after 10 reasons not too? Your Lord, I rest my case.
I'm only interested in a jailbreak at this point
I like to call it iphone ex, then wait for the fanboys to say,it's not EX it's iphone ten.\nThat makes me laugh.
so which iPhone should I get? 8? X? 7 maybe now it's cheaper? go Android ? - help here - http://app.apeo.co/31mgeac
Ok dokes I'll come up sat if you're out dan n
Honestly cannot tell the difference with any iPhone its the same thing every time but more expensive and with less features, you have to be a special kind of dumb too keep falling for less features more money.
ILL DO IT AND FUCK FOR ANDROID LOVERS
Anyone else wondering why they skipped a iPhone 9?
Yea I won’t buy it cuz this & cuz that . Then he says he will still buy it lol
I have the iPhone 7 and i think the iPhone 7 is better
........... So I guess I should buy a bomb?
Fuck all of you guys! Apple all the way!
Where are my pixel users
A little overpriced ? Come on thats all so crazy !!! It's a fuckin Phone !!! You pay over 1000 Dollars for doing the same shit with iphone 4...its every Year the same crab just a bigger display and everybody freaks out why are people buying this everytime ???
I got 1 reason not to buy it. \nIt's a fucking iphone\n\nBuy the samsung s8.
They made it look like the galaxy with that glass back and chrome edges.... Fucking embarrassing
#2 on trending...everyone wanna see where Apple lags😏
So save money for the IPhone XI?
Good points. I think it's really about time that we consumers punish this company for exploiting the customer loyalty. The title of the leader of innovation has long gone.
In summary:\n\n- at the start heres 10 reasons why you shouldn't buy it\n\n- by the end, ... but dont get me wrong I'm still going to buy it\n\n😐
The downfall of Apple
I honestly don't care what kind of phone i want anymore, currently have iphone and used to have a samsung. I'm just getting tired over the fight of which phone is better, it's just a phone man, this generation has gotten too attached to phones.
As your YouTube channel is called everything apple pro I think that was a very honest none biased video that was quite helpful ....
apple is like the call of duty iw and Samsung is bf1
I'm buying it cause I'm a savage 😎
Revolutionary for Apple. Nothing new here at all. Apple fans consider playing catch up revolutionary. Says it all really. Says it all.
Why everyone hating o ya thats right because i have to like what everyone else does because if i dont then im an asshole who has their own opinion tbh i love my iphones and dont care for android at all.. dont like it then thats you and you are entitled to feel that way. You pissing and moaning about why apple sucks is not gonna stop me from buying an iphone nor will me saying how much androids suck stop you from buying your android phone so save your breath because your opinion doesn't matter to me on this subject
People are unhappy with the display design?? Sounds like iphone is the only phone sold in the market. Infact there are thousands of models from various brands available in the market for much cheaper and good quality usage.
Because it cost an arm and a leg? Yea, I figured
It's the new kids phone
So sick of the price argument. Just don't buy it if you can't afford it.
I'm probably gonna get the 8 plus ngl
unless you're an Instagram attention whore i see no point in spending this kind of money on apple products.
Im still here with a iPhone 3GS
Why would u buy an apple product anyway
I'll give everyone 2 GOOD reasons why not to spend any money on any of them. One is price, you know where they assemble and make these?, Africa, and they can buy them at no more than 3 American dollars each!!, no sht. The second reason is, technology in general, no innovations at all, the same idea, phone laptop, desktop computers, nothing has changed for decades, just an add-on to software that could have been added sense they first came out, nothing real, nothing new, just the same crap, with software up grades, while in those third world countries needing help with real issues, they get it for nothing, or virtually nothing. I refuse to support any more tech. industries, because they profit too much on us, and haven't given innovation of tech. a second thought.
The iPhone 10 actually has more screen than the iPhone 8+. So you don't have to worry about it not functioning normal.
iPhone 11 no buttons \nHow to turn it on u ask?\n\n\n\n\n\nFuck u
This reminds me of COD the iPhone 6 is like blackopps 2 it's was great but then the 7 comes out and it's like ghost and now the 8 which is like advanced warfare. Just getting worst and worst every time
Yeah i'll stick with my iphone 7+...it looks weird and small.
Honestly the main reason most are not gonna buy the x is because of the price.
i am sticking with my iphone 5s, it is a good phone
i love this new samsung phone
apple is such an asshole, they just got new phones with software updates. in hardware they downgraded and skipped the headphone jack and wanted people to buy the bluetooth headphones. some idiots keep saying cheap people can't afford bluetooth headphone but for your kind information bluetooth technology was in phones before even smartphone came out, it's nothing new.
It's just ridiculous how expensive this thing has got, and by buying it you're basically telling Apple that's okay\n\nYes I personally will still be getting the iPhone X
You just called them out. Lol.
I won't be buying it at all Nope
3:12 I live for Beatles references
TENTH iPhone?\niPhone\niPhone 3G\niPhone 3GS\niPhone 4\niPhone 4S\niPhone 5\niPhone 5S\niPhone 5C\niPhone 6\niPhone 6 Plus\niPhone 6S\niPhone 6S Plus\niPhone SE\niPhone 7\niPhone 7S\niPhone 8\niPhone 8 Plus\niPhone X\nThat's 18, Sparky.
I don't understand how people could realize the flaws of an iPhone versus its competitors, and still buy it. People must be made of money to lose so much function/$ and still buy it because they love the brand.
I remember when the iPhone X came out the first time. back them we called it the Galaxy 6 😹😹😹
I'm twelve and I disliked this video
Damn I have make up on and i cant use my face unlock.... FUCK!

Pfft, this phone is hardly revolutionary.
Weres the iphone 9

Fuck the iPhone x.
1300 euros hahahahaha fuckoff Apple go rob your mother you pimps.
Clearly iPhone is about money only. The dim screen is to save battery power btw so it's actually better.
We are proud to introduce, Iphone 15. There is no screen \n-*Fuck you*    -Jony Ive\navailable 2020
This is the best phone ever! I have 1 and the price is worth it. Dont listen to This dude. He Dont know What hed saying guys.
Hi all, I just want to tell you something. Actually what is the problem between apple products with other ?. Do not argue between apple products with others. It suits your needs only. If you are not comfortable with one product, do not compare it with other products. If you do not like it, just be quiet! why argue? you just choose what you like and if you do not like why should compare it with other products?
You are fucking awesome.This 5 minute video changed my mindset (+_+)
Here in Europe £1000 would buy me so many cool holidays around Europe and I'll STILL have spending money!
What happen to the iPhone 9?
I'm an Apple fanboy but after much research I'm compelled to go for the galaxy s8
Apple just used the Steve Jobs presentation to tickle the emotional testicles / boobs of their loyal fan base just to that they don't see how greedy apple really is. $75 just to get a USB C so I can get a fast charging or connect to a Mac? The same USB can can be bought on AliExpress for $2😂
the guy is absolutely right .... not buying this shit !!!!
All I know is that it costs hundreds for Apple to buy the screens from the other companies
Tbh after the Iphone 6s and 6s Plus the 7 and 8 dont look to great and dont feel like an iphone
i have an iPhone 6s i will stay with it id rather save my money for something other
So people buying apples shit for 1000 but apple cant even count to 10 correctly
Whooo TRENDING
Woow. What an ending!
Reason #1: No home button, headphone jack, and dumbass faceu recognition
Ooh that dim screen part.... hmmm
Good job
#2 In Trending
AGREEEE!!!! I think iphone X is fail AF and buying new 8+ does not worth it if I already have 7+....I really dont need any wireless charging or new camera - glass on the back is for me the worst option and rosegold design is gone :(\nGreat video !!!

SNAPCHAT SQUADDDDDD
LBW SQAD WYA!!!!
Gorgeous hair 😍\nTotally can relate to how 90's are made for certain shapes !!!
I was just at the Primark in Manchester yesterday. My 3 month old is outgrowing her clothes so quickly! And she wears them all once... maybe twice. So I went and bought several bits a few sizes up so I can stay ahead of her growth. (Shes in the 75% for weight, but over 90% for height! And 100% breast fed. Woop! Woop!)
Couldn't agree with you more Louise about the fashion at the moment. I cannot go shopping without it just leading to a massive meltdown of feeling like rubbish. I'm 5ft 1, and a size 8 but I have massive (and I mean massive) boobs so all this boxy '90s stuff with no shape if just awful on me and makes me look 3 times my size. Although it looks amazing on others I does nothing for me and so finding clothes at the moment is such a massive struggle as it's the same everywhere! \n\nPs. Absolutely love your hair this colour!
S U C C U L E N T S
I'm a Hufflepuff
unrealistically, i would love the 1800s fashion to come back. i have been obsessed with Victoria and i love all the dresses Jenna Coleman gets to wear!
I really want to get that mug! I love winnie the pooh and mugs!
The 90s were a giant fashion faux pas to begin with, it's heinous that the hipsters have recreated it.  I spent my life in flannel shirts and ripped jeans, so guess what haute couture trends I'm forcing on our fashion readers this season?  PLAID FOR EVERYONE, Grunge will rise again!
i just love you and your videos. Always have, always will <3 I am with you on the 90s stuff. Some of it I love ( mainly small back packs and more grunge type flannels) but I HATE crop tops and those strapy  tops that no bra works with ever.
At the beginning when you said how you aren't into the current fashion, I thought it's so nice to hear a YouTuber admit this fashion is crap right now. I'm tired of cold shoulders. I like full skirts, buttons downs and a little bit more prep in my style than I can seem to find anywhere right now. I also wish bootcut pants would come back. Skinnies are fine, I'll still wear them, but I'm kind of dying for a pair of bootcut jeans.
I completely agree with your state on fashion right now. Its all kind of shapeless and boxy and personally my body is already kind of boxy so i definitely prefer clothes that give me more shape. Hoping style transitions soon
I would also like the 40s and 50s back, I am so sick of seeing cropped tops and chokers, they seem to be everywhere and I actually find it hard to find clothes I like as a result
Actually considering booking a flight to the UK for a primark  haul alone....does anyone know if primark in the US is any good? I'm from Canada :) no target or primary:(
If you don't know what to do with the purses you could possibly do a giveaway? 🤷🏼‍♀️ might be more hassle than it's worth though 😂
I'm a Slytherin!
Sounds like a good friend.
Liked this video just because of the bringing jojo bows back
1) Your hair is absolutely stunning, you look like a pink goddess, and 2) I'm a Ravenclaw!
I'm a slithernne ❤️
hellooooo I think you forgot to tell is your hair is PINK!!!!! LOOOOVVVEEEE 😍😍😍😍
Im a larger person and i love to wear 1950s dresses and stuff that generally makes me feel nice (which mostly consists of flowy dresses, leggings, jumpers etc) and today i went shopping and i couldn't really find anything in my size and it made me feel quite down about myself especially since i was with my sister as she is quite small and anything she liked they had her size so not loving fashion atm summer was also not a strong point for me (croptops and shorts just do not come near me)
Yes Louise! I feel the same way about Frozen (Tangled is obviously much better, everyone is crazy.) and I also feel the same way about Disney merch. I love the theme parks and the movies, but decorating with disney stuff just isn't for me.
What really gets me about so many clothes in stores is that they have no fit to them because the companies are trying to save as much as possible on design, materials and time. I can't find any dresses that cinch at the waist and are long enough to cover my bum and I'm only a UK 10.
Acc love Louise she is so sassy😂💗
My GOD Louise, you have just ruined 10 children's lives by saying that about darceys headphones. Now I'm gonna have to explain to 10 confused kids and 20 angry parent how they found out
Actually cry laughed when you said Stylish Jew design \nThat's the kind of thing I do. I always read things wrong 😂\nI love your hair by the way. \nAlso I'm a Gryffindor xxx
Your hair looks GORGEOUS its the best thing I've ever seen
Youre just one amazing lady! Congrats on the baby news! I found you via your buddy brummy mummy! - you're both great bubbly funny real girls and soooo  like me!  Keep being you and blogging like you do. You really bring cheer to ma life!! Xx you're house is going to be soooo cute.
Still so upset that I didn't see you in Rushden Lakes as I work there 😭😭 also love this video!! Love ya Louise xx
Why is this on trending?
im a hufflepuff,, hufflepuff squad where you at??? xxxxlooking great as always Louise xxxx
You're hair makes you look younger. Reminds me of when you just had Darcy, I do prefer the blonde though I have to admit it makes you look elegant  and more put together dx
I love the selection of Hogwarts  pj bottoms they have
I absolutely love your hair xx
I love the term Queen's ears to discribe people that can't wear cheap earrings. In America it's just explained as nickle allergies. I'm gonna start using it to explain  why I can only wear real silver and gold earrings.
the question is does rushden lakes store have the mrs potts teapot?!
I love your hair!!! I'm a ravenclaw
I have curves too louise i dont luke some of the fashion in primark at the moment xx
I have those pj bottoms and I have the top that goes with them I have the chip purse container thing I wanted the bauble but my primark sells out so fast xx
Hufflepuff all the way!!! :)
I went to Rushden lakes its to die for I could spend alot...\n\n♥♥♥💲💲💲
Who misses Darcey in the vids I do xx
I want the 50's and 60's to come back my big bum can't handle these 90 boxed fashion ....
I bought some invisible & regular Hogwarts socks at primark along with random bathroom bits. \nI agree about fashion! I think it looks great on other people but not that great on me, at least some of what i've seen. I do like that those I do like are available in my size now, yay!
The primark cropped jumpers are right now my favourite thing!!
1. LOVE THE HAIR!! \n2. Slytherin forever! (They're not all bad...) \n3. Yes this 90's fashion needs to move on already it was shit the first time round! It suits no one but prepubescent girls with no curves! I would love Victoria fashion to come back 😂\n4. With those two beauty and the beast things you could fill them with sweets and give them at one of the many birthday parties. \nXo
Dont think its the 90´s anymore. I think the 70´s style is back🤔
Need to go to primark now!! Xx
Ravenclaw!!  Wishing so much there was a Primark near me. Such lovely things.
I completely agree with you Louise about not liking 90s fashion! So many nice floral patterns etc but not everyone wants a crop top 🙄
I'm a Ravenclaw (but I have some Hufflepuff tendencies)
Love your hair this colour
Your hair looks so amazing I love it so much
Any other Gryffindors out there?
Is there a way to hide someone on trending because this is getting ridiculous now
I'm not a huge fan of Frozen either. Completely over rated. Beauty and the beast is way better. Your hair looks great btw!
I would like a 1920s jazz style clothing to come in because it would be feathers and glitter everywhere 😂❤️
Love you hair! \n\nI'm not a fan of toady's fashion, as well. I'm a fan of the basics. Skater skirts and fit-n-flare dresses for me please!
Every Christmas, you do your gift exchange with Zoe and both promise that you're going to see each other lots more in the next year and make new Chummy Chatter vlogs and carpark karaoke, but then it doesn't happen, which is so disappointing. My favorite of your videos and of hers are the ones you do together. I know distance and schedules make it difficult, but even if you did a Skype one together, it would be great. Your friendship is so lovely and the two of you together make me laugh more than anyone else on youtube. Just the two of you sitting in the car trying to catch Pokemon was hilarious. I hope you film together again soon. Thanks.
You should do a give away for the things you don't know what to do with. 😂\n-Proud Gryffindor
So over the 90's look!! The 90's wasn't that long ago, why do we have to revisit?\nI wish the 50's and 60's look would come back! \n\n\nAlso my primark is rubbish compared to yours, never see these things
The candles in primark are my guilty pleasure , also in Ireland primark is called penny's 😂💗
I nearly died when I saw the Harry Potter ornaments! I'm in Gryffindor! 🦁❤️💛
What primary did you go to ? They don't have half of this at my primarks !!
I'm a ravin-claw and proud
U are the best youtuber just saying🎀🎀
Omg, love the hair! Totally suits u!! Xxx ❤
I bet she flosses with a mattress
LOVE LOVE LOVE THE HAIR 😍💘

This part is so funny 10:14
IS IT JUST ME!!! BUT SHE SOUNDS LIKE RILEY FROM THE BOONDOCKS
I aint all the way evolved = this isnt even my final form.
Just to let y'all know the labels got something to do with them being cordial in the public to help benefit nicki fake ass
I respect The fact that she keeps it real and is completely transparent...i wish her all the success in the world. \n\nAnd p.s. Charlemagne was extra nice to Cardi that's how you he likes her. He's not nice to everyone lol
*If I ain't got my lishence, then what does that tell you?*\nI laughed at that
Come on Cardi! I wanna see her win!!! And she there already!!!
I'm so happy for her. I love how successful she's becoming. Everyone doubted her and thought she wouldn't amount to anything, but she showed all y'all hating ass bitches what was really up. Always have been a fan of her and always will. Love you Cardi! #BardieGang🤘🏾💛
Every time I hear her say yeah I think of Riley from boondocks
Im a fan but she act hella annoying at times
If ion got my license, then what does that tell you 🤣🤣🤣🤣
She's so damn entertaining, love it yesssssssss. An interview I'll actually watch
When Cardi was talking about meeting Bey and Jay, Angela had to mention she was there bruuuuuhhhhh 🙄😒😒
The mumble talk every other sentence has to go at some point
I love her so much
Why does she talk like that man?
YES BOSTON ALL THE WAY BABBYYYYY the dominicans are out in lynn and lawrenceeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Talking like that over and over is just immature...it was like they were interviewing a teenager...what is cute about that? Anyone can become famous now it's so sad
Cardi is a real one
I  definitely got the Bring It On reference LMAO
im so sso happy for CARDI she came a long wayyy!  but im disappointed at the same time, its crazy that shes so big now and she dont even shout swift out or bring him up with her if it wasnt for him she would be there smh people change when they get up. but hey thats the music industry for you i guess atleast nicki made sure safaree was good !
Let’s Get Cardi B to #1 guys! Stream Bodak Yellow on iTunes, Spotify, SoundCloud, TiDal, Google Play Music, Pandora, Deezer, YouTube etc!  She’s currently #2 on the Billboard’s Hot 100  behind Taylor Swift. If Bodak Yellow reaches #1, she’ll be the first female rapper in 23 years since Lauryn Hill to reach #1 with no feature!!!!!
I'd like to see Cardi take some communication classes cause she has so many good things to say but it sounds like she doesn't know how to say it sometimes.
She's real, number 2, frap, and chicken nuggets..wife her!!
i love cardi b .... but she should invest in public speaking.
Hope she stays down to earth
This interview was trash
Everybody subscribe to my channel I got songs with future and juicy j on my SoundCloud type in KingJoJoPolo🙏🔥
this was a little un comfortable to watch for some reason
Cardi be buggin' out...she's definitely not stupid. Acting and being are two different things lol.*
😘❤💯😍😀
Angela Yee be drinking that healthy shit......👍
Uggghhh sooo annoying
Look at Charlemagne trying to protect Cardi from big bad Nicki Minaj lol
I love Cardi

https://youtu.be/AcrXJJ-_czE 👌🏾
😍😍
Crack head
i  love cardi b heyyyyyyyyy
Annoying voice
Yesss cardi yes\n🤣
I know people are like she shouldnt change her voice, be herself. But come on man lets be serious. Her voice is too annoying and her accent is way too thick. There is a time and place for everything. This was not the time to speak like this. This was an oppertunity to show she could get down and stupid with her friends, but when it comes to work she can be serious to. Im not saying she should change herself but she should improve herself. She now have the money to educate herself in speaking. Invest that money into learning how to deal with these type of situations. She could still have an accent but this was a time to introduce herself to ppl who never heard of cardi. Honestly im not even a fan nor have i ever listened to her bodak yellow song. After this interview i most definitly dont wanna hear it now
Someone said this is the fresh breed of black privilege and embodies typical rich BLM members. I aint seen it but that's what people telling me

Why is this trending now lol
What is songs?
Cristine is the closest thing we have to parental supervision on Youtube.
I just found this channel and the starting was so cool
thank fucking god you finally made a nail video
This is the most beautiful video I have ever watched(because of all the HOLO!!)
I am a 21 year old straight male who knows nothing about nails or makeup but I watched this entire 12 min video about nails at 3 in the morning.
I wish my lips had holo flakes instead of crusty flakes 😭
she's made of video about nails we must be in the HOLOcaustdrop me a like if you thought my pun was funny PLZ😘
Some weird guy on YouTube told you are terrible
so when she poured nail polish on herself was it just really watery slime?
There will never be an ugly nail as long as it has holo on it.
Hi Christine I'm a holo sexual
Why don't you use nail holo for make-up? You can also use the dust holo (linear holo powder) for highlighter. Also I love your videos sooo much keep going❤
I HAVE AN IDEA!! What if you made you're own make-up but added the holo glitter to it!?!? Idk, try it? Mabey? Yes? No?
You talk kind of like Pewdiepie
Holy H💿L💿! 1.3M views in a day! 😱
IF U READ THIS Cristine! THERE IS HOLO GLITTER THAT YOJ CAN PUT ON YA FACE!!!\nsearch:glitter or holo glitter for face and hair! use hair spray for when put on hair! P.S glitter gets on everything
What Will happen of you put an matte taco (top coat) on the holo?
I'm still curious if what will happen if you snort it
When I saw the intro o said what am I doing with my life lmao😂
First time watching this channel.... First thought was ' she's crazy', second...'I like her.' 😁
Its 3 am and I'm here seen the holo
AND FOR ALL WHO KNOW KYS STAND FOR KILL YOUR SELF.
You should do a video on testing Wish nail art stuff xo
What Will happen of You put on A Matt topcoat over H💿L💿?!
Born pretty gave me a nearly empty tub of holo, when i brought from there
Just got my bottle of F.U.N. Lacquer Northern Lights in last week and am Loving it!!
I think these holo flakes show more colors than other holos cuz we can clearly see blue and pink and purple
The Holo Queen will ALWAYS be on trending PEOPLE!!!♡♡♡ Love you!
O got a cat
Cristine... I really like youre videos. I have one question. Can you for next video make 'Wish holo haul' pleaseee. Like this coment if you want that too. Love ya
Today my birthday no one have wished me :(  \nI'm 18 now and don't have a Single friend
Y is she known as holo queen she should be  known as holo god
Cristine u should make a holo halloween mask for halloween!
The first holo nail is the best out of the 5
I had holo on my nails tonight at work, and I kept getting distracted by them. The light kept hitting them just right, and I was like ooooh, holo! xD But more relevant, those flakeys look awesome! I definitely want some.
I wanted holo so bad...but I cant order it nor go to a store that sells it....so I almost broke my mums wedding dvd...while trying to scrap off the holo on the cd...she caught me before any damage was done.😁💿
;-;NOW O CAN DIE HAPPY
You know how your nails where yellow they arn't anymore!
If you aren't working with a company to produce real holo makeup (especially highlighter) behind the scenes, I will lose faith in humanity. You really deserve the title Holo Queen
So awesome to see an actual nail video....I want me that Holo!!! Beautiful beautiful holo!!!!
Actually there is a REAL HOLO glitter for your face and body from NYX, I have it and it's great!
Omg I love the song
your nail is yollow but very very vety beautiful give me yourr nail girl\n\n\n\nhey girl give me your nail give me😡😡😡😡😡💀💀💀
Christine ? Could you please not go outside with your holo nails ? I live on mercury and they're so bright they're blinding me.\n\nSincerely, - HOLO BITCH FROM SPACE
Holo anything polish/powder/chunks mountain on your nail?!?! Ahhh you should do do this
I loved your videos 😻😺😼😍homely one day people will make HOLO  for peoples faces homely one makeup people  will understand HOLO is not just shiny things in a battle
My God I just want eat those flakes so I can say I shit holos
This is the holoest video i've ever seen.\nI feel like my eyes are blessed😁\nLove you Cristine #5 on Trending❤
yesssssssssssssssssss! turned on my phone to this!!
Holy crap Lisa Frank should be seeing this...
Watch out. Swift might sue you
Christine should do 100+ layers of holo polish
Teacher: What's your favorite color? Me: HOLO Teacher: What's that? Me: I SAID HOLO

✨✨✨ NEED ME SOME REAL HOLO IN MY LIFE ✨✨✨
I have roasted you roasting youtubers on my roasting youtubers video.
Please, please, holosexuals unite. I have an upsetting story to tell, that you might find grief, or enjoyment in. Feel free to keep scrolling though!\n\n\n\n\nI went to a movie with my friends, and then after we went into the shopping centre. In Penney's (Primark), I found something amazing. ACTUAL, REAL, HOLO NAIL POLISH, FOR €1!!! I CRIED! Then later, we were outside another shop, and we were swinging around our shopping bags. I didn't realise that THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF MY BAG, and so the bottle of holo nail polish fell out. The corners of the bottle were smashed, but the polish itself was fine. Thank you for taking your time to read this. Its very upsetting.
Why the fuck did I watch this.. why was it so interesting when I don't give a fuck.. my minds blown...
I can't tell if her childhood commercials ghost takes over and makes her remember and just say.. what..do..you..think\n\nMAY JESUS CHRIST HOLO YOU.
I came out as H💿L💿SEXUAL today. I was told to not give myself labels, go back to my room and do my assignments. 😭😭😭
My friend texted me the songs that Cristene sang and I was like WAIT DID THE HOLO QUEEN MAKE A NEW VIDEO??
Will you write a book about holo and nails and warning about fake holo and all the stuff like that?
Since everyone is doing a video where their boyfriend buys their outfits, u should do a video where he burns ur outfits cause why not be a savage
I got my 3 packages from Born Pretty in like 2-3 weeks 🤓

Who would you cast as adult versions of the Losers' Club in the inevitable It sequel? We're going to have to go with Amy Adams as Beverly.
Clown wasn't much scary in the movie
I want to see It sooooo bad but I have no one to go with 😩
The Bill Dunborough was really annoying.
Did you plagiarize spark notes ? Just rearranged some words...
No way we're gonna wait 27 years for the next movie.. watch it be worse than the 2017 it. If that's even possible
Jacksfilms should play It\nHe'll fit that forehead easily
Henry bowers also receives a bj from one of his buddies in the book
Lilith is going to grow into such a beautiful lady, I loved her in the movie
Like movie but the clown isn't that scrary
I wander why the clown doesn't eat them at night
Finn was good as Richie but I feel like he would've been better as eddie and Jack as Richie. Idk just a thought  :p
Jeremy was in ant-man? when?
firstly, there should be a pile of dead children and a bag of balloons
Dont care, this movie still amazing
This version is more like the book tbh, I enjoyed this more than the 1990 adaptation
We all Float down here🎈🎈🎈\n\n\n\n\nHA HA HA
Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain or Bryce Dallas Howard for adult Bev.
A nose that doesn't quite fit a person of the Jewish faith?\n\nHow can your faith determine the size of your nose?
They should look like it
Ehh,   Reboots haven't done too well .  The Amityville Horror ,  Nightmare  On Elm St.  and a few others I've seen absolutely sucked ...Big Time ,  with one exception .  The Newer Halloweens  !!!!     After seeing Tim Murray  Master PennyWise .   I don't need to see this movie .  Beep Beep Richie  !!!!
Your thumbnail looks poopy
I thought the novel described Stan as having ginger hair...?
Pennywise still looks the same the only difference I see is the nose is bigger and the eyes are a bit different color
You clickbaiting shit baskets.  Penneywise had blue eyes in the thumbnail, which got me thinking that he could be some weird version of Mordred from the Dark Tower.  They're both powerful beings in conflict with the Beams and the Tower itself, they're both spider monsters, if he actually had the blue eyes my theory could've been right.  I guess he could still be one of the demon elementals, specifically the one in conflict with Maturin the turtle, but that's not quite as cool.
Is it me or does Ben/Jeremy looks adorable
I really really loved the new IT movie, I just felt like it was less scary because you kind of know what happens (if you've seen the original). I feel like it was more creepy than scary!
Georgie's death scene had me shook but Richie was a little savage😂😭.
IT stroke me immediately, did we just found a new Molly Ringwald in Sophia Lillis?\nAlso, my take on how the bullies constant treatment to Mike (the black kid) by always screaming Get Out! in the end, certainly has double meaning. \nFirst, being mean, inherently racist jerks, since he is the only black kid on the block. \nSecond, IT power certainly looming and clouding Derry (hence, the town seems filled with terrible, grotesque characters) somehow creating unseen barrier surrounding the town. Mike, living just outside the barrier, and (in the book) was the actual walking and talking wikipedia of Derry dark history. Most certainly isn't welcomed by IT, who can sense he is a threat of his very existence.
But what if It was a transgender and was trying not to be mispronouned
When u have no ideas so post 100000 it videos
Is me or does Wyatt Oleff look like a really really young Heath ledger? If Heath ledger was alive still it would be great to see him play his adult character.
I just saw this movie today and it was amazing!!!
I got an it ad before this video
I paid with only pennies to watch this film... I was being penny-wise
The cast of what?
The Google duo ads are everywhere
DiCaprio should've played IT
I Like How There's Awesome Music But In The Background There's A Creepy Music
Done
When ever I see I want to see it.\nI'm like what? You want to see what?! And I realize its the it movie
My mom is watching It in the theaters right now while i babysit my little brothers
Autistic comments
Saw the movie last night. It was great. Each kid played an excellent part. Good job by all of them
I just saw this movie tonight and god almighty it was a massive disappointment
I'm so goddamned tired of hearing about this movie. There, I watched the video.
Steve carell as Eddie Kaspbrak in IT 2
Pennywise can fist me any day of the week.
The shouldn't have to look like the book Stephen king said he doesn't want it like the book and that this new movie is how he wanted it their fine right now they didn't have to look like anything
Scary movies have no common sense the people in them I'm like JUST RUNNNNN! TF
THE CAST WAS THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THE MOVIE
how the hell is Ben only 150-160 pounds?
Richie was hot 😂😂😂😋💜
E G G B O Y
In the sequel i want Dane Dehaan to play as Bill Denbrough
how the cast looks to me. I don't care. I'm never gonna watch it anyway.
666k views....... well this doesn't seem too good to me
*Casanova Frankenstein voice*   Nem-eh-see-s
Wait
You didn't mention Georgie :( also as adults Chris Evans or Ryan gosling should play bill, not like the old it film where adult bill looks like a pedo😂
Not eating at McDonald's for a while ):
pennywise looks better without the big red nose in my opinion
Lit
Hi
When you use the word REALLY in your title it makes it seem like the characters should look differently but in the video you actually acknowledge they are correct. What is the point of this?
Title is missing a word. The cast can obviously look.
Looper sorry no understand Inglis, please translate me your video.
Anyone here know what the 'Loser/Lover' thing on Eddie's cast meant?
The girl has a natural beauty.
Well let's just wait 27 years and their you have your actors because they are all grown up

The 2017 versions Stan was the worst character
Well at least Georgie is floating too
I enjoy new pennywises look better tbh
Show me any book to screen adaptation where the physical descriptions match, or even better, an example of when it mattered...
So no belch
Spoilers?! She cuts her hair!?
Jaeden 😍
The movie sucked
Looper's thumbnail game is getting too stronk...
Cast of what?
❤️
Actually, Bill did have reddish hair int he movie. You can really see it in some of the shot with strong sunlight. It was more of an auburn, but you can see a pretty prominent red highlight in his fringe.
The baggie costume was described once in the novel (when It killed Georgie) but the rest of the book describes a white-silver suit with orange buttons on the front
The It Movie Commercial Played Before I Watched This...
This new cast was perfect !!! Saw this movie 2 times in theaters with my boyfriend and with my girlsss... it was amazing!!!
I really can't tell you how much I love Eddie😍He's cuter than the boys at my school.

Hey person that's scrolling down in the comments🐢🙃
The ones who played as the kids in the original mini series should be the adults in the reboot sequel... *That way, it would truly be the perfect reboot...*
whelp, in the original book there's a gang bang involving 12 year olds...\nso maybe not following book is fine💁
The thing I was disappointed with is that how come the kids didn't only see Chuck Norris there is no other fear worse
great film
newcumber?
Cast of who?
I hate it when someone called the looper who didn't write the novel, nor cast the movie, who don't possess the skills or ability to act in a movie, use phrases like how they should look. Its unprofessional and shows you don't understand your limited role in society. Get a clue. We don't care what you think they should look like.
Everyone who thinks it's gonna be a cover from Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth... y'all have no childhood.
This...was just...great. Simply GREAT. I didn't even know how much I needed this in my life. Thank you Miley
I love this!! Takes me back to when I use to love this song so so much and play it over and over!! 💕 now I can't stop playing this over and over! 💕
too bad we have all seen way too much of this girl
her voice gets me in a trance. im deadass tearing up
alot of people are saying childhood self and forgetting that type of reaction drove her to be wrecking ball miley lol
I was hoping it was gonna be the actual pop version..but this is nice too.
She should release a whole album with her old songs which are sung in her new country style
I felt like crying when I heard this I was so happy 😍 chills all through my body(๑･̑◡･̑๑)  #throwback
thanks BBC, everyone loves the old Miley
miley cyrus is great and beautiful
I feel like she's more tamed now
Thought this was the other  see you again lol
Sorry this isn't the live lounge
I wear my sunglasses at night😦
I love how she matured this song. Its an awesome version of her original. dare I say I love this more?
My childhood ❤️ I love this version more than the original tho
Behold a demon in the flesh! How grotesque it is!
Love her or loathe her, this is perfection. Replay...
Oh miles ! .. thanks for bringing my teenage days back :(
Thank god she's not like she used to be.
I thought it was See you again(Charlie Puth)\nBut no regret I clicked...
can this be on iTunes?
I feel like my 10 year old self living in my 2007 dream world again this is magic
She brought new life to the song :,)
This was my favorite Miley song I remember when I got her CD for my 10th birthday lol
Nicely done, and she looks good!
DO START ALL OVER NEXT! And then The Driveway! And then Bottom Of The Ocean! 😭😭
she is still so full of heart
omg this just made my life and is so relevant rn and i was obsessed with this song
THIS WAS SO GOOD
Everyone thought it was Charlie and Khalifa's song
My inner child is so happy for this.
I thought she was going to cover Charlie Puth's see you again
IM NOT CRYING \nYOU ARE
Anyone remember how just an year ago people were absolutely shitting on her?
It's so great to hear this version of this song. Also, it's great to see Miley singing her old tunes with this country vibe. I'm amazed.
The beat almost sounds like a Fleetwood Mac song.
I'm so happy I can't contain it
FAKE! There's no tongue
Wow she took my breath away I'm obsessed with this 💕
I'm 13 years old again
childhood is back strong af
She can change her hair\nShe can change her clothes\n\nShe can change her mind\nIf that's the way it goes\n\nShe can say goodbye \nAnd she can say hello\n\nBut she'll always find her way back home
How is she performing in a different setting than in the lounge?
I'm in love w this cover almost cry:'))
Love you Miley/Hannah 😭💖 Xx this actually made cry Xx so proud of you hunni Xx 💜
This is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Thank you for this.
What happened to her nose?
Don't mind me, i'm just crying my eyes out
i was 8 when this came out
Teen me is CRYING AND HAPPY
She dropped the speed?
my childhood is back. thank you miley <3
This was and still is the bop
Subscribe to us for a subscribe back!💖
Everybody here saying they thought it was a charlie puth cover and I'm here like nop never heard of it, this is the only song that came to my mind when I saw the title
I'M CRYING WHILE I LISTEN THIS AGAIN IN 2017 😭😭😭💕💕💕
the first verse sounds like I wear my sunglasses at night...
I wonder what Lesley is up to now..
I was in 6th gread when the song came out and I still love Miley
When you haven't hear this song in so long yet you still know the whole lyrics ❤️❤️❤️
This is the best thing to happen in 2017
You can change your hair, you can change your clothes..... but you'll always find your way back home:)
Get back to shaking ur ass on national television instead of doing this bullshit that i know u dont like to do miley
Miley should definitely make this an album cause I'd buy it!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
i thought it was a Tyler The Creator cover
someone tell her to sing fly on the wall
This gives me life
Knew it word for word 😭❤
UGHH LOVE HOW THIS MILEY IS BACK 😍❤️
Click bait I thought She was gonna perform see you again by TYLER, THE CREATOR. JUST KIDDING.
I'M CRYING THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE
This is going to sound so dumb, but when I heard this song I was shook (shocked). When Miley Cyrus went off the deep end, we all asked, what wrong with her?, why is she doing this?, and honestly she was being Miley... I truest think she has turned herself around. And when this song says I will redeem myself, says a lot because look at her now, did a full 180, and it's been a long time coming but we finally get to see her again.
THIS IS SO AMAZING!! WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT SHE'D BRING THIS SONG BACK AND CHANGE IT UP LIKE THIS!! PERFECTION!
Much better when she's not trying to be an edgy liberal and being all hip hoppity.
So good! Obrigado Miley! ❤️💗
my inner child is screaming omg yaaasss miley!!!
F the add
why am i crying
This bitch always surprise me, fucking talented
IM QUAKINGGHHHH
Childhood still in tact
Brings me back

So iconic!
She sounds so GOOD!!!! 😍
IM NOT CRYING I PROMISE IM OKAY
Go ahead Miley! Love love love it❤

This is literally the first roman Atwood vlog I've seen but I'm sorry bro I know how you feel where you just have no idea what to do and your priorities are all being tested and everything you'll get through it man
I miss the og Roman   they've turned him into a product and it makes me feel so bad.
That's how I feed my eel.
Dear Roman, please don’t be upset anymore. The Roman soldiers the real fans like me and a lot of us here. Will stick with you through everything. It’s incredible to hear that your doing these projects for people and their families. Your an amazing man Roman Remember that. Keep your head up. Smile more ;)
Any so called fan or anyone giving Roman crap for going out and working for his family is an absolute imbecile!
My mom is in Chicago
We need to talk\n\n\n\n\n\nNow like this comment
You know what's right, and so does anyone with a good brain:)
Love the honesty! Remember, you can do anything for ten seconds. So just live life ten seconds at a time and when things get rough remember that the ten seconds is almost over.
Take a week off we love
Is it a law somewhere that all male youtubers have to wear a snap back 24/7?? Shower and comb your hair once and a while lol

Roman we all love u and understand why u can't vlog a lot it's the sacrifices the benefit  of some for the benefit of many and if people get mad just tell them benefit of many outway the benefit of few
what is it what is the project
I'm new. What's he talking about? What problem? Does he mean the problems of going on 2m subs? Isn't that a bit of $ ? Can't he afford a massage everyday? I have a $50 dollar bottle of Stress herbs that bliss me out. Is he dumb too? Or does he need new drama in his vlogs?
Why the fuck does he have a pony
I love Roman and I’m happy this is trending but why is it trending?
You make us smile and it's our turn to make you smile and remember it has to get worse before it gets better ALSOOOO it's our turn to say your beautiful one of a kind and smile more!!!!\n❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Stay strong Roman!! True fans are here for you! :)
I love but hate the Chicago air port, it doesn’t feel the cleanest in some parts but the rest is huge and cool. Where you get out with the half pipes is fun.
You need Jesus.

Another reason to be interested in a mac mini is if you need a mac to develop apps for iPhones or Macs and you can't or don't want to afford an expensive Mac.
Why the hack all money still exist can any one give all the things for FREEEEE?
I thought you edited with resolve?
well it exist because apple can't just take them back. anyway great vid
Better question, Why does apple exist in 2017? Well that's because their customers are retarded and would buy anything from apple. If apple made Apple waste Which was legit just gold plated shit from the apple CEO people would buy it. \n\nSide note - if Apple waste was a real product i feel it would also come in silver and bronze tiers
It was a jewel in the time❤️
Man you're so wrong and annoying. Those specs aren't shit, and you don't need a 1000$ PC to play HD videos. You're overly criticizing it man, it's so fucking annoying. I'm unsubbing, your videos are getting shittier every day.
They still sell these😲
Why does Austin Evans exist in 2017?
and as always thanks for the video...
Never heard of it before actually
The reason why people buy Mac mini is because of the mac server
What the cuck is that Mc mini
U said solid not sold
Anyone know what monitor he's using in this video?
Probably because children who don't understand computers probably use it
This guy needs to learn how to enunciate. I couldn't even get through the entire video because of his lazy speaking habits.
I’m still using my late 2012 quad core i7 (8 gigs of ram and fusion drive) and it’s a beast considering it’s 5 years old. Ports for days
Why the hell does he talk like that?
i am using mac mini from 2013, i never had any issues till now. i recently bought intel NUK which really bad and i stopped using it now. Its best hardware and software combined. but i don't like the new one where u can't upgrade the ram. currently i have 16 GB ram and planning to upgrade the ram to 32GB sooner.
I use my Mac mini as a media center in my living room with Kodi (xbmc) and an apple remote paired to it. It can also play local and network media and is secure and reliable
it exists for building ios apps and getting cancer. ps: it doesn't run crysis.
Why Austin still exist in 2017 ?
bores me that all these guys sound the same
hi austin evans would get me a gaming pc
I'm now still using mac mini 2012....
Why does Austin still exists in 2017?
These things are really handy for playback and when you need to have computer in racks
This is so sad. I think my 2015 Macbook Pro Retina will officially be the last Mac product I buy. And at least half of my day job is programming iOS apps. There's just no reason to buy mac anything anymore. The pros don't outweigh the cons. I hate Windows, but I need the Creative Suite to do my job so I can't switch to Linux even though I would prefer to have a linux style command line natively. \n\nFor the last 10 years I've been using macs almost exclusively for professional web and app development and design due to their Unix/BSD based command line, support for all of the programs and tools I need, and high quality hardware in an affordable for professionals price point. The new Macbook Pro that gets rid of the function keys and escape key that also isn't reliable is a no go. The Mac Pro hasn't been updated in 4 years, and the 5k iMac that doesn't have the hardware specs to even support a 5k screen is utter stupidity. The iPhone X is a joke, and even though i really need to upgrade my iPhone 6s+ that is now over 2 years old, there's no way I'm paying $1,000 for a sub par Galaxy S8 with the two dumbest ideas they've probably ever decided to implement: the top cut away for the screen, and no headphone jack.
I can upgrade the memory and the hard drive in my mac mini. I only use it now to watch YouTube and Netflix now
why does he talk LIKE THIS?
apple should put the A11 bionic chip in that mac mini
LOL...I run a Mac Pro 1,1  El Capitan and  Yosemite +Final cut Pro X with No Issues, that I picked up for $140.00 used. Suckers!
Hey guys, this is exhausting\nGot your secret message
im watching this on a mac mini
Why does the Mac mini exist in 2017? \n\n\n\n\nMaybe because I can't afford a $2000 laptop. :)
Anyone else notice the YouTube link has the word funny in it...\n*d8U5funnyA8*
Apple fanboys will buy Apple no matter how much better a cheaper solution there is out there
The only reason you would get a mac mini is for it being used as a caching server. Its small profile fits well in a switch cabinet.
Austin's sentences sound like they end abruptly, or is it just me noticing his speech is a bit weird when he finishes a sentence?
Why people with glasses still exists in 2017?
Why are you talking like a sports announcer?!!
I wonder what it sounds like for him to speak normally
I am still running a late 2012 mac mini with yosemite , normal hdd and maxxed out 16GB RAM. Its running strong :)
do a Mac mini vs USB killer
Didn't answer the title question of this video, at all. But quite entertaining, nonetheless ^^
Austin Evans can you try Livestreaming for a short time
The old Mac Mini were great machines - upgradeable ram and HDD, quad core processors. I like Apple products, but I hate it when they abandon a product and keep selling it for the same price - just like this and the Mac Pro. If they had kept the current model up to date I may have even bought one, but honestly you are better off buying the old one from ebay or wherever......
I hate the way this guy talks. It's such a fake put-on. It comes from him hearing his real voice in a video and being humiliated by it, so he compensates with this affect. Pfffffft.
Legit surprised that the iPhone is substantially faster than the mac mini
Why does Austin Evans exist in 2017??????????????
So you do apple reviews yet you've never held a mac mini?
I hate the way you talk. Its very annoying.
Is it sad that my gaming pc has an older and lower grade (i3) cpu than the one he just dissed?
Why does all the unoriginal comments exist such as Why does Austin Evans exist in 2017?
can u make a hackintosh video? Would be awesome
Hey guys, this is exhausting lol gets me every time
Ok I am really noticing that slow down after each sentence love your content tho
The tech community should finally start to realize that Geekbench is not the absolute truth. OS affects the results. For example, my overclocked i7-6700K on Windows scores less than some MacBook Pros. Same between MacOS and iOS, and iOS and Android.
Fine Austin. Fine. I'll watch the video. You happy now.
I got it cuz like you said it was cheap and i need a Mac for school since that's all they use at my school. As nice as the MacBooks and iMacs are I just couldn't justify spending $1200 - $2500 for a fucking Mac. So I upgraded the Mac mini alittle spend $800 on it used a old Keyboard and old 32inch tv I had laying around and it's works fine with pro tools and premier. Would I like a upgrade yes but if you need a Mac and are on budge you can't go wrong, but it all depends on what you need it for too.
It's mini because the people nowadays like sticking things in their buttholes. So now folks can listen to poopy mainstream music in the poop hole.
Honestly i didn't even know that thing existed till now
I didn't know it even existed unless I saw this.
Love the use of that Jake Chudnow soundtrack at the end. That's a true Vsauce ending right there
Mac Mini is the nickname my girlfriend gave my dick :/
Jealous because wasn't invited for the Apple Event ?
when you see the outro line of vsauce 0_0

Hey Austin, guys here.
Austin, why do you talk like thiiiis? The last word of every sentence is stretched ouuuut. That shit is annoying as fuuuuck.
This is not a sponsoring spot.... But isn't?\nPlays Vsauce theme.
Austin copied vsause's outro, like if you think the same
A LOT OF SCIENCE STUFF! LIKE THIS BEANIE HERE!
The unsponsored Vsauce part seemed really sponsored.
He's hot!
its for developers so they dont have to spend 10k $ just to export for iOS and sell apps on apple app store

Muyyy linda lástima q Shakira se tiro el vídeo bailando. Se mueve muy feo Nicky  papasote. Cómo siempre
Basura de canción, como todas las más recientes canciones de Shakira
Me encanta como se ve Shakira con el pelo rojo 😍
Shakira con vestido\nShakira dorada\nShakira pelirroja \nDemasiado simple la verdad\nPfff
Me Volvi a enamorar.... SHAKIRA CON CABELLO ROJO!
No es una canción mala, pero nada impresionante. El boom de Shakira ya pasó. Aquel 2006 fue su mejor época con la épica canción Hips don't lie. Ahora  tenemos a gente de Zona, Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, Jeniffer Lopez,etc
Tiene razón farruko el reggaeton esta muerto ahora existe solo el trap
Busca mi canal: Chrilow   y suscribanse, juego de todo tipo de juegos de Pc y todo es en transición en vivo
no se ustedes pero me encantó🎶💘
Esta música es una basura, con letras adorando al mismo lucy
Creci escuchando la música de shakira.  Y siempre la apoyaré
como  cuando quiere un sirviente antes que a un novio 1:55 XD
Sin duda prefiero las canciones de antes de shakira:/
M gusta  mucho 
me fascino 🖒🖒

Creo que está mujer tiene talento como para colgarse de un género musical  tan mierda como el regueton 🤢🤢🤢
Esta buena la Cancion y Shakira tan hott como siempre
Like si vienes de parte de coreano loco 😂😂😂
I thought I could get into this cause she's hot but not with that stupid beat
why almost the Spanish song have the same beat, i love this song but sometimes feel so boring, almost the S songs like this
The magic is gone. :(
Even if I understood what she is saying I still wouldn't like it.
What that mean?
Yo sólo me pregunto ¿qué pasó con la mujer sencilla y decente que yo admiraba?¿Qué pasó con la autora de las letras hermosas que se pasan todo el día en mi cabeza, las letras reflexivas, las letras románticas, las letras sensatas?¿Qué pasó con la Shakira que de hecho era música?¿La que tocaba la armónica y la guitarra en sus canciones, en lugar de poner ahí a un sintetizador pa' que sonara? Es triste saber que la mujer que crecí admirando, mi ídolo, mi inspiración, murió y parece que nadie se da cuenta. Shakira perdió ese algo que la hacía única (de tal modo que se apoya en otros para hacer sus trabajos, a Shakira nunca se le vio tan dependiente de otros artistas, es incapaz de defenderse sola fuera de su sona de comfort), que la hacía especial, perdió su esencia, se volvió vulgar, perdió su inocencia, perdió ese sentimiento: ¿Hace cuánto no llora cantando sus canciones?... Yo sólo digo que Shakira tiene que haberse perdido a sí misma, terminó convirtiéndose en otra artista comercial, y quizás físicamente no esté muerta, pero qué peor muerte que caer en la indeferencia y falsedad por encajar en un mundo que va evolucionando, qué peor muerte que el negarse a uno mismo.
A ver quien se da cuenta que el inicio hace referencia ah que la mujer es un instrumento, genial eso :v
-esperen, no disparen, soy shakira\n-y que haces cantando reggaeton?\n-tengo hambre
Nose ustedes pero shakira esta hermosisima :v

why u take so long to make new music
Why do all pop stars these days have to swear, show their arses and nipples? It never used to be this bad.... Or good depending if I'm watching it or my 5 year old girl
I love this song, it's very powerful. And her voice is gorgeous; she is gorgeous.
who mixed this song? i really love it
and she,this song sound like H.E.R
Who is she singing to?
Who is here before 1 million views?
wow the old jessi has gone
We all here for it🔥
A few more listens. I'm not use to this Jessie yet but I do like.
This is not good at all and is going to flop. She's running what little remnants of her career she has straight into the ground. She will never make another record after this one fails because no one will want to work with her. She's going to lose her contract.
I love you so much!
I think this song must be for Beyonce!!
Can someone explains me who's the person Jessie talks about, her mánager? Her producer? 😱 i need to know, queen Jessie♥
no hate here but here style here looks a liitle bit like demi cool for the summer or something
I can tell this song has a deep meaning and I feel like I'm missing it. Soon it will be revealed to me
MY GIRL IS BACK
i have a feeling that Jessie is bi but it doesn't matter
This was heavy. Loved it.
I wasn't ready, I wasn't ready, I wasn't prepared. 😍😍😍
Jessie is giving me life I am here for it
How does this not have a million views yet! It's okay many people ignore great art. Masterful 🙏🏽
I love her..but she's never going to be a thing again. People forgot about her. She's not famous anymore she needs to get that.
I feel the same vibe than when I listened to Here I come of Trevor Jackson. I love the both by the way.
I love it but whom she speaking on ?
You're so amazingggg!!! Just think about that... 😂🤔
Is she trying to be sexy now? A little too late dont u think? This is Beyonce ish
Luke James is QUAKING IN HIS BOOTS 😂😂😂
YALL WHO SLEPT ON JESSIE.... THINK ABOUT THAT
Loving the new Jessi... You go girl
Her vocals are the BEST in the game!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hands down
This is the Jessie J we love.
Make way... Jessie J is ready to slay again 🔥
Repping UK all the way!
Is this song gonna be in the next 50 shades film or something?
Love this so much, so powerful, going through a breakup and it speaks volumes to me like nothing else. Thank you for being so raw.
my Jessie is not dead 😍😍😍
I love this not over singing and focusing on lyrics
This video is very much like something Banks would do
Came for Luke James' hard!
Am I the only one who thought Khalid was about to come out of no where 😂😂😂
The tempo shifts in this song give me life.
i love your music  .it,s number one for me

Jessie bout to snatch y'all wigs, *THINK ABOUT THAT*
Watching this while price tag is playing on the radio lol
Still can't stop replaying this Song! Jessie is life 🌹💖
This is one of the better PMV's I've seen...
I'm not a fan just checking Chaplin and I'm a lol not saying it
I remember when prior to 2010, an ass that big was considered fat and ugly. I went through my adolescence with an ass like that and got bullied to shit for it. Now suddenly everybody wants a booty like that and all i can think is 'Damn! Why wasn't big booty desirable whilst i was becoming a woman? It would have done wonders for my self esteem in high school' XD\n\nIt just goes to show, you never know when your 'undesirable' feature will suddenly become desirable! :P
who's this about lol
so good. Jessie J. Feel  that. x
turn into another sex tape, just about time to be a whore, great job Jessy.
Daaaaamn! Cant wait for the whole album!
Queen Is Back , amazing song🔥😍🌹
I just can't help but feel the emotion she is not only singing about but with. She one of the few artists that takes her listeners on a journey
So glad she's back BUT The face wires and fanny grabbing Madonna did long time ago. Nice choon though, I like it.
why this is so underrated?
Anyone else feel like this song could be a collab between Beyonce and James Blake? I'm getting those vibes
*(((💘👍))) If you are a fan of JESSIE J give a thumbs 🆙*
Where is the comment by Alain Bruno? He's all over the place, why isn't he here
I'm here before 1 mili views, who else
Ughhhh she's so beautiful and cute !!! She kills me up!! 😵😵
got a R&B vibe 2 it
I'm sorry, I have to take it of repeat because my 3 year old is running around saying cockacheatatrader 😩

*THUMBS UP IF YOU THINK THIS LINER CAN DEFEAT VOLDEMORT IN ONE GO, HAH!*
please do a makeup tutorial where you use that green magical highlighter (by the way this look was so cool and beautiful)
No, bro. Why didn't you do the Pottermore quiz? Fuck Buzzfeed.
I'm a Gryffindor too! :D but i use Pottermore's sorting hat
buzzfeed for your house placement 🤐O no baby Wut is you doing
First of all harry potter house?? No. Hogwarts house. Second, buzzfeed? No. Go to pottermore.
I love this look, omg girl you are gorgeous.............
go to potter more for a definite sorting :) I'm a Ravenclaw!
Beautiful lady like your video good job on the make-up💟god bless you.\n▶ SUBSCRIBE IF YOU WANT 😋
Im disappointed that she didnt use the pottermore version >~<
I can not even draw a single wing😂😂😂
Someone's 5 months late on this 😂
It's so funny to see people with large lips apply lipstick since I have super thin lips so I'm always like wow it's like you're filling up the Pacific! 😂😂 luv you Nikki
You should do a makeup challenge where you do your last makeup step first and you end up doing your first makeup step last
Thaught you were gonna use the 'magic' black blusher
I got Ravenclaw. If only I had some sort of blue eyeshadow to make my own Ravenclaw look.. Oh wait.. I DO.
I'm a Ravenclaw!
I think you should take the pottermore test
You can do it on Pottermore. I m in Ravenclaw
I got a Harry Potter ad before this video. ⚡️
You are the Queen 👸🏼❤️
She has the most perfect face
Can you do makeup inspired looks for the rest of the house's
You're a wizard Harry
the potermorequiz is the best because it actually is by J.K.Rowling!
I'm house slytherin! :D you should try to make a look for each house in Harry potter 🐍
Girl what is you doing??? That's like perfect makeup!! 😭 I can't accomplish that it's way too good
How do you get such pink lips?? Spill!
Is she.... just pretending she's into HP?
That eyeliner is something I could never recreate in a million years.\n\nPs. I took the quiz on buzzfeed and I got Hufflepuff, so it's accurate I guess.\nI mean for me it was.
I'M A RAVENCLAWWWWW
Do looks for the other houses!!!!
Sorry sweetheart.   I belong to the house.of the dead.   The WALKING DEAD!!  Is there a 'house'?..I don't even care...I'll belong to the van-down-by-the-river if thass all TWD has...LOL\n\nTHIS.  LOOK.  IS.  HAWSOME!! \n(that is my way of extreme awesome.  My 6 yr old grandson , whom I'm raising, had a classmate write this in his yearbook..'Yur the hawsom est fiend'. {the awesomest friend} and I got SUCH a kick out of it, I'm still using it 3 yrs later...lol)
What lipstick is that? I was so amazed! 👏🏻
please could you also do one for the other houses
Oml that share of red
If only you could join us...
This look is so awesome and inspiring!
You should do the pottermore quiz !!! But what a stunning look 😍😍♥️♥️  \n\nYou should do the other houses too !!!! Ravenclaw 💙🦅💙🦅💙
I enjoy every time watching you, you're so creative and funny ! Amazing, go griffondor !
First off your makeup is NEVER basic lol...idk how you don't get burnt out! Your videos are always on point 🙌🏾🤤
YOU SHOULD HAVE USED POTTERMORE IT HAS THE OFFICIAL JK ROWLING SORTING QUIZ
I would cry everyday removing it
What i do have is a MaGiCaL ROSE BRUSH
makeup looks stunning but the video really seems like a forced ad.
Do dollar tree makeup vs fenty makeup or your old make up vs fenty makeup. like this if she should do it.!!
It's S for slitherin
I can't find the brand of the brushes in the description 😭😔
Why didnt she take the one on pottermore?
She talks to much just put the makeup on but still love ya
I'm kinda sad you didn't take the actual quiz
The Potterhouse sorting hat quiz is the only legit quiz in my book.
Nikkie you look so beautiful in this, living for this look😍
homage to my homeboy harry potter me too
Don't buy the iPhone X. You won't be able to use the facial recognition software when you take off your makeup
Slytherin all the way baby!!!
When nikki says ''basic eyeliner'' and makes the eyeliner so sharp and winged that it could cut people across the world:-) :-). Amazing video nikki
IM LATE BUT YOU SHOULD DO THE POTTERMORE ONE
I got Gryffindor. I was expecting to get Hufflepuff because I got that when I was younger but I guess my bravery has topped my kindness a bit? I don't know, either way, it's cool to see that I've grown and changed. Lol, this got deep, bye now.
OMG nod to Nadi!  Btw, I'm Hufflepuff, go badgers!

Loving the R&M content, this show has so much creativity and genius behind it, hope you do more Video Essays on it :D
This video is annoying i i can turn into a pickle so i prevent myself from clicking on this video
Please make a Rick and Morty playlist so I can get notifications just for those videos.
He has changed, but it's like when you have a kid, you only notice they grow once you get the ruler out.
Morty has definitely changed. In season 1 episode 1 he didnt know how to defuse a universe destroying bomb but in season 3 he now knows how to defuse it now
1:53 seconds anI 'm out. This video is pointless
fuck rick and morty, the fans are all the same, the show is not interesting or funny and has defidentally overstayed its welcome.
He turned himself in to destroy the Galactic Federation and the Council of Ricks, two organizations that have made family life harder for the Smiths; he plays on it being an act just for him, but it was for his family.
I don't fucking understand never watched it because I see this rick fucker drooling like a fuck.
shut up Morty you you little piece of shit
I feel like he has, I relate to Rick's relationship's with people.\n\nHe seems to always get let down by people and have bad things happen when he opens up. I feel that will be change big time after this season if Evil Morty kills his Morty he is with right now
Has anyone noticed that he show is about several Ricks, not just one...
Oh he's trying!
a lil bit yeah, he's mellowing
Rick and Morty is like DBZ. It doesn't matter if he dies, he'll just go into another dimension and get another copy.
At 2:58 you can hear a weird sound coming from the left earphone scared me since I’m laying in bed at night
SUCK A BIG LOAD OF SHIT OUT OF MY ASS !
all of this is old information
No he hasn't changed. At all. Thing is, the more you learn about a person, the more your perspective of the person changes. So if anything that's changed, it's our impression of Rick. Which is, that we all appreciate the hell out of him.
Rick sucks now. I don't think it's the real rick
He's less suicidal, I mean good for him but it's less enjoyable
Change is the only constant
Oh shit I'm like rick
Oh look, TRASH hasn't been taken out.
I think my main problem with season 3 is how they seem to be adding a storyline to it where you need to know about previous episodes to get a lot of the things. With a lot of the previous season's episodes, you could just drop in and go from there.

People like you are the reason the rick and Morty fan base is bullied
Great show. Shit fanbase. I really wish i could say i like the show to my friends without them thinking I'm gonna make a stupid obscure reference to it in the middle of a sentence
Yeah but humanity loves resolution, they will have to round the character eventually.
WTF I like rick and Mitty as much as the next guy but this shit has under 100,000 views and it's on trending? This shit is how people know the trending page is rigged.
Rick did say his brain waves get canceled out by Morty's, at the time we may had thought that he meant stupid waves, but looking at Morty's new behavior now we may be witnessing the cross between the two of them
If Rick can fluctuate, so can Morty. \nThat will be a bigger issue through this season...\n📈📉📈📉📈📉
Here's a theory. Why is Rick's last name Sanchez?
what a dumb video
stupid bitch that couldnt make it as a therapist breaks apart a cartoon  should have been the name of this video\nyou suck bitch
I don't  care what she said I just love this amazing show
I love these videos, great narrator, amazing editing. please keep it up!

I LIKE THE SQUANCH YOU'VE GOT!
I don't think Rick made up that backstory. It's probably one of those stories about the creator of candy that's on the packages of simple Rick
anyone else notice that rick does not drool in later seasons? or that he drools when we need to know what rick our rick is?
please do on Fracnes Ha or any of Noah Baumbach movies!

(Haven't seen it yet) duh ricks a pickle
I feel like Rick segregates himself from his family so that he won't have enough emotional attachment to them if they disappear or die so that he won't be in an emotionally crippled state of mind, kind of like the example with unity.
that's a hell of an analysis
Ok I think morty c187 is not really c187 he might be c187b but I think that evil Morty was c187 and that's why Rick was  crying. You know. Aw geez man it's just like Rick is like a real jerk but I think he's harder on this Morty because he knows how expendable they all are and that's why he is trying to like prove to protect himself from the pain with losing a Morty.
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them.
Wait so does evil Morty's brain waves cancel out the Rick's brainwaves? Because you know.... Evil Morty basically fucked up and citadel of Rick's and basically outsmarted them? So would the Rick brainwaves cancel out the genius of evil Morty?
I better be getting paid for this video...
This actually made me think about the movie *Interstellar* & how they discuss the relationship between Distance and Emotional Attachment (love), which they compared to Gravity.
This is a horrible analysis.  They illustrate examples across all 3 seasons.  Which means he's been that way the whole time.  He hasn't changed they just reveal more about him.  None of those episodes created a visible character change, they only show cased his thinking and personality styles.  The only exception is maybe Season 3 Episode 1 because of those life altering events to the family dynamic.

2:19 which episode is this from?
These videos are clickbait and are a waste of time it's literally just a tv show not something that can be super analyzed
anyway so I love how you used the sine wave as a parallel to Rick's fluctuating behaviour because it also fits since in s1e10, close rickcounters of the rick kind, Rick draws a sine wave to symbolize his brain waves. Morty counters that. Behaviour speaking, it might be the same.\n\nDue to Morty's over exposure with Rick, he's also starting to act a bit more like Rick in a sense that he's starting to get numb with all the crap he's pulled into. Could it be that whenever Rick cares, Morty, as Rick's counterpart, would show hints that he does not. Like in s2e9, Look Who's Purging Now (?), Rick's doing all the killing and encourages Morty to do the same but when Morty gets into a rampage and Rick tries to balance out Morty's repressed anger by telling him to dial it back a little and even to the point he had to electrocute Morty to unconsciousness to shut him up. \n\nTheir relationship, though incredible unhealthy, somewhat balances each other a lot which creates a very great dynamic we can't get enough of.
You're conflating basic human emotion with the Rick of Ricks. It's a cartoon. Stop trying to analyze the character and enjoy the show by taking away from it what you will. This video scratches the surface of the complexities of Rick and it makes me cringe when people like the narrator tries to frame the show through logic. So  has Rick changed? NO he's the same god damn Rick he was in season 1 episode one. It just doesnt seem you can wrap your brain around that.
Just because this show is about science and it's clever, doesn't mean we have to over think the characters I find this stupid
I wouldn't be surprised if Justin adds online theories to future episodes.
Never even watched this show is it good or nah?
I've watched more clips and ppl talk about this show than I actually watched of the show.
I think the character development is great also morty is starting to become more like rick i wouldnt say rick is becoming more like morty but is getting a bit nicer
People wonder has rick changed? Have you guys ever seen the show? He litteraly was ready to kill mortys heros just to prove his point rick just really likes his morty and doesn't want him to die but he doesn't care about their emotions
This seems like a good time for a drink, and a cold calculated speech with sinister overtones. A speech about politics, about order, brotherhood, power. But speeches are for campaigning. Now is the time for action.
Incredibly deep and insight. Man I wish I could see this show for free, but, besides that, you did a tremendous job.👌
I'm in love with this show, but the show community is getting worse, and more cringy. The show was really good, and funny when it was irrelevant, now you got kids watching the show, making musically about it and screaming out pickle rick in public. Most people started watching it for ricks famous catch phrases like wuba dub dub dub I'm pickle rick etc. There is barely anyone else who enjoys the show because of its jokes.
Wow, really good analysis, I'm surprised, consider me subscribed.
I feel like Rick is not changing at all. He's extremely old, knows practically everything and lives seeing the bigger picture. But in the show we learn more about him like if he cares or not, but Rick doesn't learn anything, his mind works like it always did, they are just showing you a little of how it works
One of ScreenPrism's specialties is that an answer will always be clearly stated at the end, unlike those other channels that raises a question in the title and leaves it ambiguous.
Typical scientists.
Yeah yeah cool but who cares?
he totally loves Morty
Goodbye moonmen
Surprisingly deep.
He's changed
Ya gotta touch emmmmmmm.
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!!!!
Best show ever
Character development? What?
You little speice of shit
Rick is bipolar, simple.
WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!
Because rick is drunk.
Quantum Emotions
Ayy your on trending
Rick = old Morty
We
All trending videos are shi-
Any small youtubers wanna support eachother
WUBA LUB DUB
LOL
Is Rick Mexican?
Well said!
Rick didn't change, the writers did.  Hence S3 being not as funny or complex.
I catch a scent of feminism from the show now, I bet they hired some female writers after all those SJWs were complaining that they were all male writers before.

Christ, how did I know this was going to be a voiceover from a woman? We're already cursed with one more beth centric episode this season. Don't taint the show with your emotional crap.
fuckin hell, you people call yourselves fans? fuck off
For all you you negative fake fans, fuck off!!!! In Klopp i trust and future looks good. KEEP THE SPIRIT HIGH. YNWA SWEDEN
35 shots and only one goal. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!
Message to all Liverpool fans reading these comments:\nWe've been through worse, we need to pull together and support our team during times like this. IMO I agree with Klopp in that this is the best performance we've put in against Burnley, what we are lacking is clinical finishing amongst the squad in positions where we NEED to score, and I think partly what can help is some confidence. Yes, we didn't get a CB in the window and having done that could have made things different, but we need to put that behind us and keep going forward. #YNWA\n\nRandom side note, just wait until the squad clicks.........I'm almost sure we won't be disappointed. #Patience
Oh My God ! i can't believe how utter shit the online liverpool fan community is ! Man the fuck up you virtual twats ! \nmost of you shit talkers know shit about football and about supporting a football club !\nFuck me you're no different to those arsenal fan tv shit heads ! \nHope not to see you fucking morons when Liverpool takes off and start grinding again !
Man Im starting to get sick and tired of these so-called fans posting their bullshit online, the LFC Facebook page is full of fucking idiots trashing the team and now this comment section is getting worse, if you are a Liverpool fan then get behind the team, if not then fuck off. #COYR #YNWA #LIVERPOOLFOREVER
I fucking love klopp like my dad and personally I think our midfield and attack is good enough to challenge for titles so good job on him sorting that side of our team out. But to still have a shite defence after nearly three years is criminal. And his faith shown to klavan and lovren this season may well be the downfall of our campaign. I'd rather have fucking Milner CB then klavan or lovren.
The German Brendan Rodgers.
defense= scared babies
Calm the fuck down you bunch of infantile imbeciles. Klopp's got at least 5 more years to build a team. We haven't got money on the scale of you-know-whos nor the type of manager who needs endless amounts of cash to buy, sell and buy again, top quality players. Klopp will bring us success in his own way and time. Have some patience and take it on the chin. I know some of you crave bragging rights cause your mate's are laughing at you and your shit team. Man up ffs!
klopp is a world class manager ...to any fan commenting otherwize you're not a real fan ...if you can't support us when we draw or loose then you're not a true fan ...!!
I was a Liverpool fan before most of the people in this comment section were born. But you know what, I agree with them. Klopp is a moron, he's blinded by his own ego and never admits to any of his mistakes. Also, he's stubborn, the reason we dont have any new center backs is because it's an admission of fault from his part if he buys one. Remember, all last season he said we have a great defence and that we don't need new players. So he does't want to go back on his statement. That's how stubborn and dumb he is. This team won't win anything, mark my words. I hope Klopp gets fired before the January window, so we can get a proper defence in place.
Wow, i didn't know how toxic the liverpool fan base is! You're not real fans, please accept, klopp deserves better than you people.
To all the Liverpool fans getting irritated about negative comments. This is what Arsenal fans go through every year from 2003.
All this klopp hate is ridiculous. Sure the defence is leaky there's no denying that. But he has assembled one of the best attacking squads in Europe. Period. People are too impatient. 2 seasons in charge and he's brought us to to Europa final and within the top 4. Rodgers had his one off season which brought us close to the English title and before him was the epic champions league title in 06. Rome wasn't built in a day and quite frankly even if we aren't a title contender this season we play one of the best football on our best day (which honestly aren't far between each other). I have faith in klopp and our squad and I have faith he will continue to build and assemble a title winning team. And a question to all the klopp haters: what manager are you guys praying for that is available to just come and suddenly win titles?  Klopp and the reds knows there's an army of faithful who will always walk with you #ynwa
Keita. Mane. Salah. Let the man build a team. Unless you want to sign another Welsh pirlo.
Patience is the key for success. LFC fans please give time to this guy. Because in dortmund he had time and independent to take decisions and another main reason was at that time, no other club had so much money to buy ready made players. For eg see Burnley they are happy with one point also because they have no money and fully support their manager. They think whatever he do is good for Burnley. When they where religated he was the manager and now also he is the manager.we have to learn from Burnley,because this guy  is much better than plastic managers like jose and pep.
Always a lot of talks... bla bla bla... and after dramatic disaster with City there is a worse match against Burnley. All team puts effort to attack, to support Salah but they don't arrive much goals...and, on the other hand, defense is too much under pressure collapsing first or later!  SALAH left Chelsea and Chelsea started to win again.!  Klopp & Flopp a strong disaster.!😂😂😂😂😂
Klopp \n\nPro's\n\nExciting attacking football\nPotential to smack sides of all abilties\nMotivating\n\nCon's\n\nDefending transition, since the fullbacks get really high up the park as he attacks in numbers\nEgo and stubborn i.e. won't add an extra defender to defend a lead.
a lot of weekend/game day managers in here that think klopp doesn't have the defense sorted and think he's naive/arrogant to the quality of the back performances. hard to think you can't comprehend that he probably wanted to buy specific defenders, and had x,y,z plans and adjustments for defense. the reality of the deals not being closed in the window (not in his control) means he has no choice but to show positive reenforcement in the belief and work rate of the players he has to work with. on the pitch for game day or in the training grounds and at the end of the day—it's always the players, not the manager. if he doesn't (in the public eye) show that he at least believes in the system and their ability to play in it—then the players wouldn't give any shit either.
Fucking idiot turning into Wenger! Play Gomes centre back! play two defensive midfielders or even play 5 at the ffs 😂 find a fucking solution! Dropping and replacing klavan and lovren with each other is a fucking waste
No leadership on the pitch anyone can see that . God I miss hencoz hyypia partnership

Win lose or draw it's Liverpool forever. We are going trough a bad patch now but it will get better all clubs do at some point in the season it's better for us to get it over with early. We will get new players in January and finish the season strong. Jurgen knows what he is doing we just have to have faith in him and give more time. He is the best manager we have had in a long time.
When ur winning ur happiest fans in england but soon as u lose or draw u never stop fucking moaning stfu u shit fans UTC🔴🔵🔴🔵
Disappointed with all the negative comments.. we have to keep encouraging and supporting him and the team no matter what! #YNWA
Flopp is changing the team so often he is destroying the team not building it. Players have bad moral. Not to mention lack of tactic, players are running like zombies with no apparent plan. he is wearing them down. He plays players out of position, does not use ones he has, delays changes, did I say he does not study the different teams we play. He probably tell the players come on boyz go there do your thing, and thats the plan de jour and every jour
I hate what we are right now and I won't excuse anything, that being said I won't stop supporting both manager and players. If you think different then you should check your self\nKlopp is a world class manager who has access to world class coaches, our owners seem a bit tight in terms of net spend but we have improved. I am not satisfied, I complain but I do not wish Klopp out as that would be stupid.
The best manager in the world!!! Our klopp!!
Created enough chances? We had 2-3 real good ones, one of them leading to the goal. That's pathetic if you have 150% ball possession. Klopp needs to take a cold shower.
Stick together still early days
This guy never has any fucking answers for anything on or off the pitch. What a pathetic excuse for a manager.
Im a Liverpool fan but this is so true:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttack wins you games,defence wins you titles.   Btw im not Klopp out.Im defence out new defence in (especially cb's)
theirs only 2 reasons we didnt improve the defence Klopp or the owners.We had a supposed £2000million to spend ,and we spent at the most £50 million at the least £30million after selling players.Something is definitely wrong .Why will no one ask him directly why we didnt improve the defence ,its a joke to every other team and their supporters.I feel embarrassed
If liverpool defenders were more confident in the air  challenge better and were tighter at the back we would not concede as many goals.
Will lfc win a trophy this season ?????   Answer = NO --- fact.
I don't know how can you enter the season with klavan, matib, Milner, moreno, lovren, the rest are trash. Does he really thought he's gonna win the league with this trash ass niggas come on man I can see you built the midfield and the front line well done on that but you are not interested in defenders. You need to steal some mourinho tactics. If this midgets on the front line face those tall and strong guys from Manchester believe me this guy is talking about improvements on nothing.
We played well but didnt take the chances we had. Klopp will sort it out. We are playing attractive football we just need a better defence he must address this situation otherwise impatient fans will call for his head. Im not klopp out but he needs to start making changes earlier than 70th minute he is reminding me of wenger now but younger version. Liverpool can still make top 4 i think the title is no possible unless defence is changed during January.
All WHO says klopp out Are fake fans
First time i am a doubting this man, its the same old shite. This season was supposed to be different, in reality very much the same. Obviously is a brilliant manager, but teams have figured us out and he has no answer to this. I can only hope he will soon.
To Fans complaining, piss off no one who works for LFC reads your comments. Just because you really want a team to win doesn't mean it'll happen. If you wanted better u should've become a footballer and played yourself. so stfu. I'm a liverpool fan before most of u lot were born. So suck it up or go watch bgt u hormonal twats
Solanke  must start next match ,he's more proactive in attack than Than Firmino.
If you are #KloppOut then you're simply plastic and deluded.
I’m sorry the back 4 is apauling I don’t know what to say. It’s bs, Why don’t we put Moreno LW?? Everyone moans about him playing to high when he’s in LB why don’t we try him LW whilst Mane is out, push firmino back to his no. 9 role. It’s hopeless,  Klopp said ‘there was no CenterBacks on offer’ De Virj from Lazio, Koulibaly, anyone but Klavan and Lovren. I feel sorry for Matip for what he has to play with. Come on guys it’s not hard. If u take in the fans opinions and ideas maybe just maybe we might do something. Ideally I don’t wanna see Klopp go But I DO wanna see changes. It’s BS!!! COYR // YNWA
so many negative comments and klopp out screamers. i understand that but people are angry about those point losses over and over but i also think you need to realize that liverpool haven't been an elite team for many years now. yes they need to address defense but its easier said than done. the marked for middle inns is such small and once anyone on high skill level hits the market you compete with lots of top clubs. even city had huge probs to find defenders. and what i want to add cause of all this negativity after the sevilla game - just please don't forget that pool hasn't been real madrid the past 2 years. sevilla won the euro league 3 times in a row. spanish top team since years. and liverpool dominated and could have lead 4-1 at half. plenty of things to improve but its not all that dark
With or without Coutinho LiverJail is still disappointing!\nThey should let him go! Karma is punishing Klop!
As a LFC Fans, I'm extremely disappointed and also very angry seeing this team playing dirty football. Sturridge was not good at all today and he was still on the pitch. Solanke is better and he never plays always on this bloody bench. klopp always use the same plays so it doesn't shock me if small team is beating us. Spending lots of money on good player and they don't even play. Nowadays I'm asking myself if klopp is a great manager or not. In every we can see the same mistake everywhere. \nSubstitution after 75' of play, even if the team is loosing. in 15', the game can't change with only one fresh player. \nKlopp so disappointing to have as LFC manager
I am a diehard Liverpool fan and I have always supported Klopp but to be honest Klopp is stubborn and it costing us a lot. I wonder why he wants so much forwards and midfielders without sorting out the defense, it's not like he didn't know about it all along. I never thought I would be saying this but I don't think Klopp is good enof for Liverpool
After 15mins you could predict how the game is going to end, Klopp is an excellent manager so is Sean Dyche for getting a point out of this game, well done to him, however the focus must be on how Klopp fields his team, in my opinion he should have started the game with solkane and ox, you could see firmino and salah was looking tired. Klopp will win games with this side Gk- Ward , LB -Robertson, CB -Matip, CB Gomez, RB -Alexander, MF -Couthino, Henderson, GIGI, FW- Mane, Daniel, Salah. Subs - Simon, Lovren, Firmino, ox, solanke. Comment your best xi LFC Fans.
Time is ticking now on this manager, his choices in the transfer windows are turning out to be woeful. Any defensive coaches work at Melwood?
Disappointed but we need to keep going and believe in Klopp. thought we were could have been more clinical and credit to Burnley they were very disciplined. YNWA
Wtf was that!?I'm sick of this shit.Klopp with a hard heart I'm telling you man...you are wasteing everybody's time.The bad news is that you could do more but you are like all germans...stubborn,in everything good or bad.After 2 years you only have 4 players Mane Matip Salah and Wijnaldum and Milner mostly on the bench so doesn't count.Taday was bad luck but we could easyly lose.Poor plan for first 11,no plan B and nothing  good in the future only a 6th place maybe.
These Klopp out comments aren't Liverpool fans. You see the same exact guys on other videos declaring themselves as Manc fans. Don't fall for it, jeez.
rome wasn't built in a day. he inherited lovern, Henderson and  Firminio what do you expect lol\n\nbe patient
Fuck you kloop we are sick an tired off your fucking hope  gooooooooooo
I haven't been critical of Klopp but I have been noticing he is not really good at game management. The times at which he makes substitutions always baffles me. I think he is too much of a patient person overall. The substitutions are sometimes too late in the game to have an impact and why the hell didn't OX start out wide over Firmino he needs rest anyways smh
Be patient , good game judge him after this month
trent can't cross klavan can't head pass nor has the confidence to drive the ball and force the issue everyone was way to stagnant and standing around at times all that being said this is my elf cup XI ward trent klavan lovren moreno- gini hendo ox-solanke coutinho firminho coutinho needs to play more forward until mane comes back
lets see what excuses KLOOP comes up with this time
Why, just why klopp disappointed on you,  stop moaning like mou we hit the post, we dominated, what fucking matters is the result and you here still not addressing defense issue and don't forget that simple mistake you made will cost you your job,  the defence will cost you losing your job
Thanks Klopp, but its time for you to leave. Please.
i don't like klavan! why always starting.
Absolutely embarrassing defending again. Another season wasted. No trophys again this season and the same shite getting said every week we need to learn FUCK OFF!! Been saying that for the last 7 years
My patience is going thin on this klopp. Ynwa
haha from arsenal
How can you put Klavan after all his bloopers in defense? Klopp are you blind? Stupid? Or corrupt may be players pay you bribe for gaming time?????????
klaven is useles and lovren in defence. kloop needs to put gomez in in central defence
I love Liverpool and support them even when we played shit. But I cannot forgive Klopp for 2 main reasons: \n1) Renewing and extending contracts of our most vulnerable players and those who are not consistent let alone 'world class'. Who are those players? Simon Mingolet and Dejan Lovren got contract extensions during Klopp..baffles me to why it was done.\n2) He had 4 transfer windows..okay let's just say 2 windows  (summer windows) and he did NOT fix the part we were most lacking in..i.e Goalkeeper and Centre Back. We infact sold one CB..the jury is out if Sakho should have returned or not. Fact is we have not improved defensively when it was so obvious. \nAttacking we are v good. No doubt. But you cannot win leagues with leaky defences. Period. He's got till January to fix this in the window or I'm totally going Anti Klopp.
Remember  spurs only managed a draw today. I bet we beat Leicester  next week .
I'm to used to this to get angry
Had so much faith in this guy
Gk- Mignolet\nRb- Clyne\nCb- Matip\nCb- Gomez\nLb- Robertson\nDm- Can\nCm- Lallana\nCm- Coutinho\nRf- Salah\nLf- Mane\nCf- Firmino\n\nPlay this team and we'll win! Just need our injured players back 😢
Fancy doing a swapsy for Koeman ?
be angry all you want but atleast find a good enough reason to be. People slating the defence: apart from the defensive error the defense delt brilliantly with all that Burnley offered, robbos positioning was exceptional.\nPeople slating the attack: You have the right to criticize the forwards for not linking up as well as they could have but ultimately we did make enough chances and apart from the final pass we looked to break them down. Keep in mind that this lot kept out Chelsea and spurs as well, but every draw or negative result is takn in a generalised manner by Liverpool fans.\nWe had a plan, they had a plan, they executed theirs better than we did ours, but we also got unlucky. I take positives from the fact we have the elememnts now with coutinho playing deep to open up smaller teams, ultimately when this particular lineup of players gels together I can see us doing bits. We've already seen our counter attacking lineup, with gini can and hendo tear it up.
ยิ่งเล่นยิ่งแย่เนาะ เฮ้อ😟
DID WE MISS SADIO MANE TODAY?
Banners fsg out klopp out will fly soon
FSG OUT
YNWA. BELIEVERPOOL
More fucking disappointment.
To all the people who don't understand how the transfer market panned out , \nKlopp didn't buy an CB because FSG put out a statement without the knowledge of klopp which inhibited klopp to go for his top target . \nNow sure we can bitch and moan we didn't get a plan B, but that plan B ain't giving us a chance to win a title so we've waited 20+ years already , instead of putting all that baggage unfairly on klopp with half a squad that isn't his players, maybe it's worth waiting an extra couple years and for once get top targets instead of settling for plan b ... social media has just given license to too many people who's impatience would've seen shankley sacked in this era... shame
Klopp you idoit it is your fault no def, no atack, mix the players, you will destroyed Champion league hopes and dreams.
Its your wrong doing\nNot signing defenders and DM. 18 months in and defence is worse. The issue against orgnized teams, do you go and buy a strong striker who can finish and bully defenders? No yiu waste 40 on ox the overrated Ibe\n\nCharisma buy you time. Fans like you, but same stupid mistakes for 18 months! Tick tock Mr deluded one
IT WAS A BOUNCING BALL......WTF that's what the ball does????
As a die hard Liverpool fan, I think its time for Klopp to go. I've not seen any significant changes since he arrived. struggling to be beat bottom half teams is simply not good enough. He had all summer to buy a defender but he didn't, he's being made to pay yet again plus being in the champions league aswell he is supposed to strengthen the squad. At the end of the day it's all about winning trophies we won't get that under Klopp not with that horrific defence. A klopp out banner will fly over anfield next month.
We're fucking shit our defense is utterly horrendous. Fucking high schoolers could have defended better.
We clearly saw that we needed a centre back, and that we can't break down teams who sit back. Klopp has fixed neither. Utterly deluded.
Don't worry lad's This German Clown we have as a Manager!! He probably put UseLess Lovren and Super Agent Alberto Moreno in team on Tuesday night against Leicester City typical from German Clown.
HOW CAN LIVERPOOL FANS SUDDENLY TURN THEIR BACK ON THIS GUY ITS ONLY BEEN 5 GAMES REMEMBER BURNLEY BEAT CHELSEA, DREW TOTTENHAM .....STOP BEING PLASTIC FANS OTHERWISE IF KLOPP GOES IT WILL BE FURTHER DISASTER FOR YOU PEOPLE NO BETTER COACH IS AVAILAIBLE
just want to remind you, its his third season..still no throphy. and reflect to this match, i dont know anymore. im done.
Time 4 him 2 go
Klopp out wenger in
Freecoutinho
Jurgen klopp out
ASK KLOPP THIS:\n\nJurgen, your title rivals beat you 5 - 0 and then you draw both your next games, one of them to so called inferior opposition...who will Liverpool beat next?\n\nThe world has no clue who we will beat and who we wont beat, can you give us a clue whats going on?
another bad season
Get out of our club, get out of our club, you fucking fraud, get out of our club.
I can name 500 defenders better than fuckin Klavan. Utter utter dogshit!!🐕💩If Klopp can not see what everyone else sees at Anfield today then he's a cunt. His fault for not strengthening at Centre half end of.
I am feed up with klopp. His tactics has no consistency specially in preimer league does not work
We are in Champion's League.  We have a team that has a chance to do something good.  Klopp is building a good team. He made a mistake not to get a good defender but we need to keep supporting.
It makes it so much better to watch when the artist is genuinely enjoying the performance. Even better that you can tell he's just in awe of the backup singer.
I hate stormsys music but this is sick well done
Jheeeeeeeeeeze!!!!!!! Oh my days Vulas voice is like butter. So smooth.
Sweet like stormzy
I love this too much🙌🏾😭
Could listen to this first thing in the morning or getting wavy at night! So Versatile

Stormzy the best thing to come out of the UK in a long time
The girl in the back has a mad voice real talk, compliments the song nicely
Mad to think that Stormzy was 7 (just a rain cloud) when this track first came out!
He's talented as hell.Shit.

The back up singer likes too much chocolate.
TF IS HE TALKING ABOUT RETARDED
Waste. Dead \n\nOriginal buries this. Not even in the same galaxy
She needs to lay off the chocolate

Thank you guys for sharing your special day with all of us! It looks like it was a magical day. 💖💖💖
My pyjama bottoms are being eating by my arse 😂😂😂😂 so funny. Gorgeous photos 😍😍
Theres just SOO many little fine details in your wedding that made it so lovely
Oh wow Helen these photos are the culmination of the work we've seen you put in throughout the vlogs in the lead up to the wedding and I have to so you absolutely outdid yourself. I don't think I've ever been so impressed by a wedding! Absolutely love your theme and your flower arrangements and pops of colour were just to die for and it looks like everyone had such an amazing time. Thank you so much for sharing, much love 💜 xx
I actually lol'd at matthew talking about his neck roll 😂😂 oh please get rid of it \n\nBeautiful photos 😭❤
Your wedding photos are all so lovely! Looked like it was an amazing day 😍
I'm a photographer so seeing this and hearing your opinions on the images is so inspiring. Loved the photos and the decorations and everything 💛💛💛
Lovely 😊 \nPs. I fancy Connor so hard! He is my young Kurt Cobain! 💔
What was your first dance song?
It's nice to see the end result after watching all your planning in your vlogs! It looks like you both had a very special and magical day! Xx
*there's no funny comments to look at.*
i swear this was posted yesterday
Crying at 'reverse neck'.
So beautiful! I love how colorful it was without being tacky at all! People are often so scared of color but you did it Right! GORG!!
Beautiful!! I'm getting married in 3 weeks! I'm super nervous and stressed about it 😅. But, seeing you two looking back at your magical day gives me the happy feels! Congrats you two! 💕💕💕 you're an inspiration!
They're beautiful!!  The photos of Maff and his friends look like they could be Mumford and Sons and I love it!!
SUCH A GOOD PHOTOGRAPHER
Helen, seems like I'm close to the first to comment on your video, thought i'd take the chance to tell you how much I love all of your videos! Thinking you might definitely see this comment... But just want to make sure you know how great you are, and how down to earth, genuine and lovely, and how much I always look forward to watching your videos! Love how you switch things up now and then and try different things! You're not scared to do you or take risks with fashion makeup or your video styles! You are like my dream best friend that I've never met. Keep doing what you're doing, you're beautiful! Lots of love!  Xxx
I got engaged yesterday so instead of watching all of your adorable wedding videos and dreaming of the day, I get to plan one too!  Can't wait to film all the fun vids for it.  Your wedding looked like a magical carnival dream! 🍿 🍾  🎡
why am I crying watching this, really moving Helen, have been watching you for years and so happy for you both xx
So so happy for the two of you!!   Looked like you had the best day ever and will be having the best life together that two people could possibly come by!!!
fab!! i love this and both xo
Your wedding looked amazing! I hope all of the photos helped bring the day back in to focus for you. ❤️ I just wanted to say I really love the way you took the carnival wedding theme, which has become rather trendy, and made it completely your own. From the video to all the photos I can see that your personalities and styles shine through in all the details.
Helen who did your veil??? So fab!
Oh its all so rainbow and lollipops i love it!
Love these pics. I'm having a barn wedding next summer - thanks for all the inspiration! 👍🏻
Most epic wedding of all fucking time
If I was getting married again I'd defo do it like yours.
Seeing the stuff as you were buying it, I thought I would be a bit hodgepodgey. It's turned out beautifully!
This looked like the most incredible wedding. Glad you had a lovely time ❤
Lovely photos! \nAlso would love a tutorial on your eyemakeup in this video 😍😍
What an unbelievably lovely video, and I'm not even halfway through. Thanks so so much for sharing, it was like seeing the pictures of a friends wedding 💕
The bridesmaids dresses went to we'll with all the colours! I remember you getting lots of unnecessary criticism about your choice of colour combinations for the dresses, but your vision really came true as far as one can see in the photos! :D
Wow! That was awesome, I think I smiled for 18mins straight, congratulations.
Been waiting SOOO long for this one 🎈💓💫🕶
Watching this makes me so happy, the pictures are all so lovely and the wedding looks so unique and fun! Congratulations <3
I LOVE your purple veil omg! if 8 ever get married I would easily do a purple veil!
your husband is so beautiful
This video made me so happy
My heart is 😭 crying with so much love ❤️ \n Must say that the weeding has a lot of things that I in a daily basis I don't like, Such as sunflowers and farm things, and you manage to pull over one of the best weddings I ever seen. Fantastic job you two!!!
I love how creative your wedding was. So nice to see something differnt  🖒🖒
your wedding was just gorgeous....ugh. It was so you! Seems like it was a great day; love from Boston USA!
I loved this! Felt like I was a close friend being shown all of your lovely wedding pics 😁 This just goes to show how important getting the right photographer for your wedding day is. So many people want to scrimp and save on the photographer and don't realise the dedication and effort that goes into getting the perfect shots for your big day. My brother got a cheap wedding photographer and ended up having no pictures with my mum in! So it's always worth spending that bit extra - you'll be looking back on those pictures for the rest of your lives :)
Your wedding looks beautiful ❤️\nThis has literally given me inspiration for my own wedding xx
I'd love to watch some more arts and crafts you do Helen I find it fascinating xxx
Looks like the funnest wedding ever
You can so see you and Maff's personalities in these photos, so much character! I love it❤️ Don't know if you've answered this before but what was your first dance song? Would love a little insight into the music you chose! Hope you're still loving being newlyweds! X
Thanks for sharing Helen and Maff xx Helen you always make me want to chew gum 😂
I just love the amount of colour and character in every picture! These have so much personality compared to most wedding pictures :)
I've followed you since god knows how long from a young teenager to an adult today , I feel like I've grown as a person with you ❤ You're amazing . Again , congratulations , may you two live happily ever after ❤❤
That location!!! And all of the decorations and activities, seriously amazing! 💜
The photos are so beautiful!!!!!! Love you loads!!! Also the outro is so cool xD
I Love Your Wedding Photos😍
God that looks so fun! Thank you for sharing :)
Those are SO GOOD ❤
You guys are so cute 💗 love the photos, everything looked so unique and colourful!
I love all the details you had!! That photo booth is amazing and then all your food vans. Amazing. Venue looks gorgeous
Aww Maff looks tired, well done for working so hard all the time. :) Lovely photos Helen, so great to see the wedding after all the preparation!!
You look so beautiful and all the candid photos are so nice!
You and Matthew are beautiful !!!
Awww I smiled all the way through 💕
Deja vu- isn't this the video from yesterday?
This is so lovely, thankyou for sharing it. Out of curiosity what was your first dance song? Totally cool if you don't want to share btw as it is obviously very personal :)
some very nice photos there :)
This is so so sweet <3 Loved that photo where you're smiling at each other right before the ceremony!!
Excited to watch this 💕
Your amazing Helen😊❤️👍Thanks for doing what you do 💕✌🏻
Helen your dress was STUNNING. Where was it from?
❤️❤️❤️ this
Sooooo beautiful!!!
Gorg! Congrats again! 💞💞
mazal tov
Aww this is really lovely <3
Best wedding ever
Such beautiful  pictures  nice job
Helen! You're trending!
Most beautiful wedding😍
Loved this
Awwww!!!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
💜awesome
So cute 😁😍
Haven't I see this already?
anyways love it xx
I watched this yesterday
How did the family politics work out after? I saw your mum and dad in the same room when you were getting ready!
Cute couple. You guys kinda look like siblings to me
Cutting the the cake was the most awkward pointless part of our wedding. Looking back we wouldn't have done that, you didn't miss anything lol
He looks so happy 😑😂
Such a cute videoooo Xx
Lovely ♡
This was without a doubt the funniest thing I've seen on TV for at least 20 years... The same guy stacking it on the stairs five minutes later was the second funniest.
I watched this last night and IT IS STILL AS FUNNY!!
The final minute of this is carnage, so so funny. Well done to all involved with the revival, has been a great watch.
The greatest moment of the human race has been documented in the last minute of this video.
This might be the best episode yet of the revival.\n\nTeam came in all guns blazing, even completed that impossible light-code/restart-button game - then it all became a complete shambles, lock ins galore and this failure. \n\nI love how after a minute and a half, only one planet was traversed and then came the throwing in of the towel which also flopped to the floor for an ALIS. (I used the acronym, Richard!)\n\nIt's great to see teams doing well and winning, but even better watching them fail. 😂 Captain should have just left them all locked in and get as many gold tokens as possible!\n\nI loved The Crystal Maze as a 4 year old and I love it now. ❤️ Thank you for bringing it back!
I love physical rob.
I don't think they chose the best man for the job. I couldn't stop laughing. When Richard said this is becoming exsistential I lost it.
This game & also when he tripped in the Aztec zone, is why he'll be remembered as a classic Crystal Maze contestant
Can we talk about how they called them cosplayers when they were in fact furries?
THANK YOU for uploading this, I haven’t watched terrestrial TV in over a decade and didn’t realise they had revived this show from my childhood! I randomly watched this live and laughed so uproariously I think I tore something internally! Definitely watched this more than a dozen times and still funny😂😂😂😂😂
Priceless.
here we see the captive human, spinning himself into a tizz
This is a dramatization of astronaut Mark Watney being stuck on the planet Mars
I've never written a youtube comment ever. This was by far, the greatest three minute video I've ever seen. The spinning, the faces of his compatriots waiting outside horrified and the fact he failed at the part of the challenge which wasn't even supposed to be a part of the challenge. Amazing 10/10
What a tit
This is my school mate Robert and I've sent him all the Twitter screenshots... hilarious... he will never live it down... can't wait to see him next.
Stop spinning!! 😂😂😂 like he can help it
He's not afraid of planets. He's just afraid of Uranus.

This was hilarious also shortly after this he fell over face first on the floor but luckily he had his helmet still on.
Just watched this with the Benny hill theme playing as the background - hilarious!!
Type of guy that gets pissed on the first pint!
Iv never laughed so hard at a TV show in my life , I feel honoured to have seen it last night , the maddest thing is the guy actually kept that helmet on for the rest of the show too - that's some deep fear he ended up with!
Wow awesome! Loved this show as a kid!
It's trigger not being able to find his way out of a maze
My god I watched this live and haven't stopped laughing. I think that's the 19th time I've watched it.
Best tv in decades
When the moment he put his hand up I knew it was going to be a fail.
That's probably the most embarrassing thing I've ever watched, bravo Rob.
This is probably the most pathetic thing I've ever witnessed.
At first I was sceptical of the new series, but this was the best episode yet: great, fun contestants, and Richard is well suited to the presenter role.
It there was more lockins in the Aztec zone where it could be dozaster!!
When I watched the intro for this they played clips of this weeks contestants playing the games - I thought C4 had gone total 'progressive' and put a team of Downs Syndromes in there. I'm not convinced I was wrong!
You should have seen the state he was in when he came out!
I watched this as it happened on tv me and my mates cried with laughter and recorded it and watched it over and over.
He fell over a step later on in the episode. I was dying at it😂
I was on the floor crying with laughter while watching this
My girlfriend and I were pissing ourselves laughing. Funniest moment ever in Crystal Maze
Hahahahaha!
Robs athleticism has no boundaries
Holy shit
So frustrating its actually depressing..
I laughed so much it was painful. And then he ran off to the next challenge still wearing that helmet !!
Classic 😆
So funny 😂
Excellent advice 0:35
HAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHA
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! That's what A.L.I.S. means; Automatic Lock In Situation!
I'm so glad this is on here cause I only switched on at the end. He also fell over jumping up a step. It was the funniest episode of CM I've ever seen. How RA kept his shit I don't know and Louis Theroux as well!
They all should depart Rob to get more crystals & then to thinkabout it
Tv gold
Hilarious
Dude couldn't fight the orbit 😂
Enjoy https://youtu.be/FHh86ySgKrA 🎶
I've been meaning to watch this new series.\nNow I definitely have to!
You'd think Channel4 could put something up without horrible interlacing artifacts.
Man from London to NYC for one day.. they could've at least given you 3 or something to chill for a bit
Sees Estée vlog, grabs coffee, dog, and blanket. Perfect way to wake up!
Estée I was smiling ear to ear when you interviewed Lupita! Like my cheeks are hurting because I'm so delighted for you - it's such a cool opportunity. Lupita has such poise and grace so I can't wait to see the video on Lâncome's UK channel. Love that bit about the camera being as tired as you - legit lolled. So much love, keep killing it Estée! 💜 x
Lupita is beautiful!
Who else missed her Vlogs?!
Cutting up donuts -- that is genius!!
Your vlogs are the BEST!!! You always make me smile, Estée :) thank you for that!
We're all craving a little salad. ESTÉE, WHO ARE YOU?
lupita is such a beautiful and strong woman <3
Thank you Lancome for supporting our lovely Estee <3 Great colaboration
Love seeing you and Allana together. Two Canadian girls making it big! 🤗❤️🇨🇦 Your interview with Lupita went very well. She is a real beauty!
Lupita is so calming.
Love you! From Seoul xoxo❤️
Estée! Seeing your cute Reggie boy over the years inspired me to get a greyhound too! I now have a black greyhound named Ollie and he's the love of my life!
I really miss your videos/vlogs, I can't stop smiling while watching this. Also you look so good! Your outfits (and brows) looks amazing! That Lupita interview too, SO HAPPY FOR YOU💕
Missed your vlogs so much 💖
I love Lupita-she's so classy and chic. Lovely vlog, Estée
Every time I watch your vlogs, I am always reminded how humble and funny you are. This video is the perfect reason why you're my role model. Even though you've accomplished so much, you're always so honest. I appreciate seeing the behind the scenes of everything you do. Thanks for always staying classy yet sassy 😘 xx
Your videos are so chill and refreshing!
I paused doing yoga momentarily to admire those greyhounds because OH MY LORDY, THEY WERE SO STUNNING 😍😍
esteé... i miss your vlogs 😭😭😭😭
Lupita!!!! Wow well done Estée absolutely amazing
Lupita is everything goals, but those arms 😍 #armsgoals
That leather skirt tho. <3
How exciting! I love your vlogs!
I miss New York so much love the vlog
I love your blogs more than chocolate... and that is saying something! The reason is definitely just how lovely and classy you are Estee! You are calming, funny and just a joy to watch 😃🤗.
Ummm... Is there any better way to see NYC in one day than spending it meeting the fabulous Lupita??!! She seems so lovely - what a wonderful opportunity!! I absolutely love the black heels you wore at the end! They showcase toe cleavage so chicly!! The doughnuts also looked like they were amazing!! What a wonderful vlog - gracias!
You did an awesome job interviewing Lupita! What an honor to meet her; she looked stunning! Both of you make great ambassadors for Lancôme. Thanks for sharing NYC with us, even if only a few hours. ❤️
loved this video! keep it up estée! <3 <3

Estee please be safe in London since Theresa May called for martial law. Cray!
Yasss Estée 💕🙌🏼 killing it like always, and you did great on the interview ✨
Omg I remember when you and Claire got those dough doughnuts way back when! I'm so excited to watch the interview with Lupita too, I can tell you killed that interview :)
Thanks for making videos!! Love the vlogs!! Wide angle lens is making me ill. Why so wide?
LOVE YOU ESTÉE 😍😍😘😘
Yaaaay, you went to The Butchers Daughter! That was the place I recommended when you asked about turmeric latte, I hope it was delicious!
forever hoping my greyhound and I run into you one day <3
Love the Church's Estee, my parents' family business is selling English handmade shoes (repairing them is the family tradition really, a family tree of shoe repairers!) and we also sell Barkers which have some pretty colourful ones out atm for ladies and gents, just thought you might like to browse their ladies collection too :) loooong time fan of your videos, love them! xx
Your vlogs are the best! I found myself smiling throughout the video :)
Lupita is so lovely
My two faves 😩😍
Black top, green trousers: dapper kim possible!!!!
Congratulations!!! Wow 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 Lupita!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Lupita!!!!!!!!!!!!!!^^
Do you ever just pinch yourself and think how did I get here?.  Couldn't happen to a nicer, more genuine person.  ❤️
💕💕💕
Love your vlogs Estée❤️❤️❤️
Love from Singapore 😊
I love your vlogs ❤
NYC + Estee?💜💜💜💜💜
AAAH hi estee!! love from the Philippines :)
Lupita is effing beautiful and seems like a cool person!
Ohhh I have to share this after watching the interview! I'm a nurse and 99% of the time on my shifts I wear barely any makeup. Mostly because of the hospital, i just feel gross with it, but also because it somehow just gets all over my face by the end of the shift. My coworker, on the hand, is just how Lupita describes herself - wearing all sorts of lipsticks based on what she feels like that day. My coworker will wear anything from a dark red to a bright plum. And somehow it stays put all day! I really don't know how she does it!
We actually started the process of getting a greyhound a while back (inspired by Reggie of course!) but they wouldn't let us because I have a young daughter 😭😭😭
Psst the original Dough is in Brooklyn ... I think it's better, cooler at least! Donuts opposite the projects.
That Sephora and Dough Donut shop is literally across the street from my job ☺️ how cool would it have been to run into you!! 😊
Are you employed by Lancôme?? I love your sense of style!
Well, I'm sure the trip was worth it! 😉😃
What camera do you use for vloging!? the video quality is amazing!!! love everything you do:)
Lupita is such an amazing human being and so goregous
from the minute i saw her in that pastel blue dress she has been my girl crush.  Lupita is the total package.
Ugh that's amazing that you got to interview Lupita!! Also so glad to see you posting on here again. Do you have any big plans for future videos? xx
I saw Lupita. I clicked. Give me your life!
Doggies!!! i'm the same when it comes to beagles :)))
wow you two are so beautiful!! Love you ♥
You have such an attractive way talking with people, I feel like I could hear you talk with me all day! Beautiful vlog tho 💖💛
Awwww...I missed this, whoop! PS: That leather skirt is hawt on you whoa, Lady!
It's true every time I see Estée interview people in her vlogs she does such an amazing job! Ps those donuts looked amazingggg 🍩
So good to have you back, I've come home😊
That was so cool! You did a wonderful job.
I was just reading Bloom and saw that you uploaded! Love you and your amazing videos Estee!
Both of my doggies just passed away so thank you Estee for posting a video today to make me feel less alone <3
Gosh Lupita is like a godess, and that deep voice... daaamn
You are frickin glowing in the first clip!!!
Looks like you jumped out of a 50s men's clothing commercial. Super groovy.
YOU GO GURL! So proud of you!!!! I'm praying one day that I visit home in NY you will be there. Or when I eventually travel to London I could meet you. Please come to Atlanta.
Your accent is sounding so British kkkkkkk I love you channel and I'm glad you're back!! Come to Brazil!!! ❤
Lupita is like a fairytale princess, I swear.  also that sapphire blue wall color--the rich colors in that room. great job interviewing Estee!
First comment! Love your videos
If I ever get a dog, believe me I will try my best to get a greyhound! My aunt had one before a German guy adopted it (and we live in Spain! Someone loved him very much to have it shipped to Germany!) and then I started watching you and fell in love with greyhounds again 💖
You're look at the beginning is very Elaine from Seinfeld 👍👍
I think your style was kinda granny :P
gurl, you could've used a better lighting!!!!!
Am I the only person who's never heard of Lupita?
Estee, which one is your favourite honey bronzer (the body shop)  the number 04???
Get you, Estée Lalonde interviewing Lupita, I can't believe it😍😍😎😎
I love everything you do because you're so beautiful and genuine.
I thought the butchers daughter was a vegan spot? \nP.s. Missed your vlogs!❤️
Hahaha poor sleepy, insane estee
Next time you're in NYC you should try The Doughnut Project. SO GOOOOD. I love Dough so much as well, but the Doughtnut Project might be my number one pick in New York. I'm drooling.
I think Lauren won \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr their tie
i really want to win omg :( wanted to get it but it sold out so fast and singapore timezone is way way different zz sigh
laurens followers is 0.5 mil more than alex
Literally wasted 10 minutes of my life
How is this on trending
i watched this whole video with a huge simle on my face 😁😁😂 love you alex 😍❤❤
I don't have instgram this is un fear do one on YouTube or something because your my favourite youtuber PLZ PLZ
Could you make more laurex merch because they are all sold out and I want one if my mum lets me.🐼⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅❤💛💚💙💜😉😍😊🐼🦄
I'm pretty sure I dropped IQ points watching this video.....
What's the prankkkkkk!
we all know how this series ends
You didn't say this is the end of Vlog talk and didn't put your mkay bye thing at the end of the video
Pleaaaaaaaaaasssssssseeeeeeee restock the laurex sweatshirts blessed my parents didn't have money to get it please I would appreciate it😔☺️
I miss end of vlog talks with the little bear bears!!!
It probably be really good if you cut the donut in half and then put cream cheese and strawberries in the middle
My friend can make what water sound its cool
When your dog is in the act of going to the restroom you shouldn't say the word no because dogs will associate the word no with doing something bad. Since your dog is doing something right by going to the restroom in the correct place you should reward the dog by saying good boy. Just a tip.
You should hide all her stuffies

NUMBER SEVEN ON TRENDING
*WOW that castle was so beautiful. I could understand why you could get emotional. Great drone footage*
Maybe you should add music local to the region Louis,  If you can find them.  Would be really cool.
Those aircrafts scare me.
That Scottish castle was awesome!
Great Vlog Guy's :)
Anyone, from Dunfermline?
Scotland! 💕😍
Awesome!
Bonanza > Cessna
awesome guys
COOL
Great drone footage.
Time for Louis to find an editor alot of the other vloggers are doing it these days.
i really cant listen to the flight mic when you can hear everyone... louis alone is fine, but jp and the other dude just hurts in my ears.
Is it a cheeky little coffee and  a cheeky coffee the same thing?  Asking for a friend 🤓
Louis you don’t have to loose sleep because of us! I personally will wait. Its better to be healthy and sleep so get your rest and do the editing when you have enough rest.
This is really nicely filmed!!!
show less of inside of the cockpit and more of the outside scenery...less facetime...!!\nit'll be much better to see the outside scenery than same people talking everytime..\nanyways loving the trip...!
Really great video guys. Louis really good to see you engage with the camera with some knowledgable rehearsed content, being a lot more like a presenter. In fairness, you did explain you hadn't had much sleep prior to going to sleep on the plane, but this could be a useful time to give some camera feedback even if these are facts that JP and Matt have relayed to you first. Louis seems a lot more upbeat now that he is back in the UK in this vlog. Presumably, as he is now regaining control.  \nWhat amazes me more than anything is how healthy Louis looks yet clearly needs to be healthier. Dude, you sound knackered, lay off the caffeine and do some more exercise you sound like you are in really poor shape dude. The last tip .... never make eye contact when you are eating a banana dude lol!
Thanks Louis for making these videos. My mornings be like, yeees, new episode is out. I'm happy for you and your happiness about how you are happy about how you live your live. Motivational and you keep others moving just by being yourself. Cheers
Louis sleep is important. I hope you guys stay a couple of days in a location soon so you can all rest. Love these videos tho. Great series!
One of the main ingredients in haggis is sheep's lung.  Haggis is banned in the U.S.
Love the 4k, it is worth the rendering time.  It will also help future-proof the documentary.  Keep up the great work!
What's happened? You haven't flown in over a week
A great place for a wedding may be????
Damn Louis! Always killin it!  Really love that Logo animation in the beginning!
Haggis is so good. People freak out about what it is but it's actually delicious.
Louis, I think that was the land welcoming you back home (Scotland).
Save yourself the time and drop the 4k..didnt even know it was, seemed like 1080. waste of time if know one notices. the only time it is noticeable and worth doing is for aerials and very scenic land shots. \nget some sleep instead :D
come to Fiji when you flying over the Pacific....
Have you guys got on on each others nerves by now?  How are you coping?
I would be so scared to fly around the world ahhh , I wonder if these smaller planes are safer than big people carrier ones.
I feel like Louis never includes enough of the flight in these episodes which is half of the adventure id think. does anyone agree?
What up with Tell me more in the background at the haggis place?
I was excited every upload in watching your series, but u take way to long to upload, I literally forgot about the vlogs
Thanks for the awesome experience of watching your adventure Louis!!
i’ve lived in scotland my entire life (20 years) and never ate haggis i have no idea how matt was able to do it
England I'd your city
Ackergill Tower is very nice but expensive. Like most of Scotland.
Have they done a barrel roll yet??
why does he keep saying “cheeky little coffee
I'm really enjoying this around-the-world flight!
Great video - you guys are awesome
Weird but we love the maps you pull into the video showing the route. The flybeyondborders site has good ones also! Thank you Louis for the fun!
I love how every coffee is a ' cheeky little coffee ' 😄
Louis said  That's far way around the World Yes Louis you slept most of it. Lol. Love Matt & J.P. They are so straight laced at times. Glad you landed safely in Scotland guys 😘
I honestly can't explain how awesome it feels to see one of your favourite creators in your home country, Scotland is beautiful and I'm so happy you got to experience it <3
Why is this 8th place on trending?
How u get private plane they also Look like the world's youngest pilot
you probably do , but have you seen this guy cycling round the world in 80 days ??? \nhttp://www.artemisworldcycle.com/the-challenge/introduction
Louis you're gonna smash the 2,000,000 subscribers mark during this series... it's also so epic. Well done bro!
Did you ever get that pitot tube problem with the Aspen fixed?
Enjoying this epic trip.Can't wait for Africa and Asia...
I love your videos man, if you make your way to China I gotta get you in my vlog!
Just out of quitosity, why dont we have to wear those dry emertion suits when you are on a comercial flight? Just intrested thats all
You need to make a tshirt that says cheeky little coffee
I question whether 4K is necessary for YouTube vlogs, because the vast majority of viewers do not have 4K graphics. I'm watching in 1080p and the picture quality is excellent.
Really enjoying these vlogs guys.\n\nI was born in Scotland on the east coast in Stonehaven. Now living in Australia we visited ( for the first time since I left in 1971) two years ago and I had the very same nostalgic feeling every moment I was there.....  when I left it was as sad as it was when I left the first time.
Those drone shots of the castle and the music, Soo Perfect!
The castle and the overcast sky were giving me Harry Potter vibes. The green in Scotland is so pretty.
You're making history. Congrats on arriving back in the UK. All the hours of filming and editing are so appreciated. This is Youtube Gold.
People often talk about having a sense of physical and psychological wellbeing. However I consider in terms of holistic well-being, what you are feeling Louis is a sense of spiritual and emotional well-being.  I think it's a hard place to get to especially when you are living in a rat race society with so many commitments.  Loving this trip!
JP is sooooo cute.   What a great trip for all 3 of these guys
kurt cobain was playing a show in a town in scotland, and he felt a strange feeling, like a connection to the place, and later, he found out he had relations from that exact town
Louis there needs to be an interview with you in the documentary!\nWhen u were talking about ur connection to Scotland it made me wonder, how you really do feel about borders and nations? Becuase you travel do you feel national pride to the UK still and do u say I am from here? I suppose you do but id be interested to know because I am originally from the UK but grew up in California but live in England again. So when people ask me where are you from, I say everywhere or nowhere cus I feel connected to so many places.
If you just can upload 1080 i be happy. Ofc if you need it for the documentary
Hey Louis the place u landed is wick and that is were I am from and I live there
WELSH NOT ENGLISH...LOVE LIVE THE NATIVE BRIT CELTS!
louis... iam waiting you in Turkey - istanbul.. you all will be my guests.. see you soon
I swear you flew a half circle over my house in Glasgow yesterday 😂
I love how Louis is so much different than all the other popular social media influencers... he isn`t materialistic he doesnt own a big house or a fancy car...he`s just into seeing the world and real life experiences as well as trying to make a difference and thats so refreshing and inspiring... thanks for being you Louis!
Got me a lil cheeky coffee
Can I have some likes??
Render time is bad because on an apple. Key to rendering speeds is mostly the CPU frequency and cores+threads
It makes me so happy when you share emotion and don't hold back 💓 \nIt must feel pretty strange and super magical doing all the travelling that you do\nI hope this trip makes a difference in people's lives who really need it 😊
Going to New Zealand anytime soon
Amazing Louis!!! As a viewer I can feel how your mode of travel has provided  a  more intimate and connected feeling with each destination and person you meet. So much different then watching you jet set your way through international airports.
Greetings from Napa Valley California. Thank you for sharing your experience with all of us. It's epic. Continued good luck on your travels around the world.\nBrad Onorato
It is on my bucket list to go to England and Scotland!
Could anyone tell me which software Louis use to create introduction paper plane art and for world map navigation also?
I'm glad Louis is working on catching up. I love these videos. I'm also glad that he can get some sleep on the plane. I'm so happy Matt is with them. You can tell JP is more relaxed.
I live for these trip updates!!
Hey where in Scotland are your relatives from
I think that we need to start counting the number of times he says Yeah during his vlogs. Seems to be getting more each time he posts a vlog.
The vlogs are great Louis your doing an excellent job and I totally agree that Matt makes a great addition to the team
Who's having a Cheeky little coffee while watching this vlog? Amazing trip so far!
4:40 louis be like ... Anyone got a manual how to throw copilot off the plane ?
what city were you raised in? were you raised in the city of england ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I saw u go over me
Barely getting any sleep... we saw you sleeping in the plane! XDDD LOL
Louis seems like a 3rd wheel on this trip...just a weird vibe!
How does he do it!??  I know it's more of the same aka Daily Vlogs. But Louis has managed to bring the new feel to his vlogs.  and they're awesome!\n\nIt's the Documentary feeling is what it is!  The fact that he is experiencing the world trip as something new due to the fact that it's the first time he flies around the world on small plane. \n\nstay safe Louis and JP and Matt!
Love how Matt Guthmiller says how crap your plane is and how great the Bonanza is every episode 😂. Make him swim the next leg.
I'M SO IN LOVE WITH YOU AND YOUR VIDEOS ESPECIALLY WHEN RAYA IS WITH YOU!LOVE YOU TOO SO MUCH!! <33 COME TO CROATIA!! <3
I look forward to these everyday!!!! It's so exciting being able to experience this with you guys :) Thanks Louis!
JP seems really passive aggressive towards Louie
Louis, third wheel much?
Yes, Scotland! My home country!
Louis is just brought along and quietly sits in the back sit of the airplane, doing nothing adventurous. Matt and JP seem to be aware of this and they don't have any fun, they are just doing their job of carrying Louis around the world. It's like climbing a Himalayan mountain using a dozen of Sherpas that do all of the planning and carry all of the equipment or even carry you up to the summit. Such adventure, much fun.
Im going to buy my own plane in the futute 😂😘
Is hernandez being played out of position and does he know he's being played out of position ?.

I agree we didn't have a game plan which is often the problem with Bilic. only reason we kept the ball a lot is because they allowed us to. Says a lot when our best effort was Obiangs long ranger and stop play our best goalscorer in years on the wing FFS
I love this channel . Dan Lawless please get rid of this battery operated microphone it's ruined the interviews .
Your audio sucks. Get better equipment
.tihs smaet ruoy mah tsew no tihs gfmO
Why cant we beat these teams uhhh so frustrating
How is this shit trending
Board and Bilic OUT! 😣
Unpopular opinion but I would have kept snodgrass and got rid of Ayew instead, has Ayew actually had 10 decent games for us? Should have given snodgrass until January to see whether he could rediscover his hull form
Have fun in the Championship next season
I smiled as soon as Lydia came on screen. I'm glad she's feeling better

You need to buy covers for that sofa.

Why don't you just put over some Blankets on the sofa when you go to bed or away :D
The pain could be a reactant to the medicine.
Where is syndicate wife
Awesome vlog great to see Lydia is doing okay👍😎👌
i said ages ago when the knee pain started to occur that it was patella tendinitis, and i was correct 😂
Tom just get a blanket or something to cover the couch until the cats stop pooping
Get some Vicks vapor rub and put it where Day poo
Does anyone know why tom opened the ace of spades bottle yet? Did I miss something?
The return of Lydia
The Movie IT is just chapter 1
The film wasn't made to be scary as hell..it was made to tell the story of the losers club! Like in the bloody book. Getting right tired of people seeing this film because they thinks it's just another horror film. It's so much more than that
Tom just get a throw for the sofa's so it dont go on the sofa!
Allice you are good looking ant thats not in the creepy wierd sub way
Who do the doodoo
Yooo it's trending
#9 on trending congrats

If my wife's in there it's a 10. Lol all our reactions
Tommy boi you've made trending again congrats dude
I went to see it and I was shitting myself 😂
These comments are disgusting, Syndicate donates money to charity and helps people, then you guys be pricks. Btw 3 of the people so far are Jake paulers, cancer.
If you have a room that you're not using, you should put a load of cat stuff in it, and when yer out put them in that room and close the door😃
Why is everyone hating on Tom and the video because it's trending? It just means a lot of people are watching it that's it.
Lol @trending getting triggered, luv ya Tom
to make your cats stop pooping on the sofa, get another cat litter box. Cats usually prefer their own litter box and if they are pooping on your sofa, they're letting you know.\n1
I don't know why I dislike toms cats so much but I do
Hey syndicate, I just wanted you too know today was my birthday :D! And i gotta say this video was the best thing I got today!! <3
Tom release the sticker pack in your us store
To. Tom you need to try zizi's in the Trafford centre 👌👌👌👌👌👌
Ever had a needle in your eyeball? Not so painful as they sedate the skin, but I never forgot the grape being punctured. All for eye lasering...
For real tho, maybe you should chill with the twitch sub shoutouts. I get that it's something nice you want to do for loyal twitch fans (and keep doing it if you do please) but as someone whose been watching since when LoT was Syndicate Central, it's kind of annoying and disrupts the vlogs...
I tore a ligament in my knee almost a year ago and it was meant to be healed months ago but I still have to get an MRI scan
The iPhone 7 plus 256 gb is $1000
Waits 4 months to get a injected with steroids
What movie did he watch?
So does syndicate not upload gaming videos anymore or is he just busy? Just curious if anyone knows
Why did you capitalise needles?
i have tendonitis in my right knee it sucks btw
4th on trending wow 👌

Congrats Tom you are 3rd on trending
Get a Bluetooth camera and put it near the sofa
Tom, I always love your VLOGS. Just classic and EPIC
That's quite a small needle for a join injection! You lucked out mate
does anyone know which jordans tom has?
You look like oli white
Does anybody else have trouble loading the merch link. I've been trying to get a sweatshirt for days but the link won't work.
Hello Tom if that happens don't eat pig lots or ever
Tbh I like needles in my body it feels weird but it's satisfying.
Trending.
One of the actors in IT, Nicholas Hamilton, is from my school, Alstonville high from Australia
Watching from A&E with a broken collarbone 😅 I watched the whole vlog twice 😂

Tom is syndicate original going to restock the stealth hoodies
I miss yote :/
Love the old British Vloggers
Is your sister single? She low key pretty.
You need to take some editing classes to make your vids more exciting to watch
Yo tom you need to start telling off the kittens and 'punishing' them for doing bad things, not punishing badly just like telling them off and stuff. We did it to our cat and now it hasn't shit on the Sofa for like 3 years
The iPhone X shouldn't actually be £1000 apple just decided to charge that amount it should be about £750
Ngl. Tameside Hospital staff are getting worse 😂 they're not even telling you they're gonna stab you now 😂
Just how credible is an Indian medical certificate? It seems every GP in England is an Indian who did their medical studies in India.

I had no idea you Brits had girls this pretty and intelligent. Maybe it was a mistake for us to fight the revolutionary war for independence from the Monarchy. With girls like that, I think I'm gonna start a petition to rejoin that government and instead of bowing to the Queen, I'm bowing to Emma.

Wow the second time around on her interview she's much better, why does she have the back of her hands covered?

I thought maybe someone was throwing acid.  Nope, just someone attempting to detonate a powerful explosive in an enclosed space.  some people...
Can it get any more scripted. Wtf. Fake as f@#k liars. What a joke. LMFAO. You people are so rediculous. Who believes this crap.
FACT: Islam is NOT a religion.\nFACT: Islam is a Godless, apostate murdering death cult, DISGUISED as a religion.\nFACT: Muhammad was a FALSE Prophet and Allah is a pagan moon god!\nFACT: Jews and Christians DENY that Muhammad was an Abrahamic Prophet of God!\nFACT: The koran is a forgery.  It was copied from the Holy Bible.
I like how she looks at the camera as if to say sh!t I shouldn't have said that about there being no explosion.. Where you even there
Errm where's the cordon and bomb squad to sort out that bomb that failed to detonate properly lmfao\n\nCome on people move along,\nWalk straight past bomb on your left please.....
I hope it was only liberals who were hurt.
*Europeans in 2039*\n''Shit... We have no where to go..''
This government seems more interested in political correctness than protecting its citizens from these continuous terrorist attacks.
So it seems that all of the injuries were caused by the 'stampede' as opposed to the actual so-called 'explosion?'
We don't believe you lying sacks of shit
I don't think we should jump conclusions and say that this was done Muslim terrorists. We now have to consider that Far Right extremist/ White power terrorist are now on the rise and fighting back. And if you thought that the Muslims were bad you ain't seen nothing yet.
Time for India to rule england. British govt is incapable of ruling itself and saving it's citizens from islamic terrorists. England needs to be converted to non-abrahmic religions to achieve peace and stability instead of that satanic dead god which they worship.\nbye.
they have not soul, they are barbaric and uncivilized.  they kill anyone.  they must be deported  and their families and friends.   they must leave our countries and stay away, far, far away.     merkels   ideas.   move with brexit, demand  immediately.  last time i was in england, i did not recognized it.   london is unsafe and  now plagued with terrorists.   do not travel to england.

this is a sad day for England and the injured people will need at least 6 months off work to recover from this,  there was allot of smoke and a loud bang,  as some people had their ears bandaged in other videos and this alone is a 7k payout ,
So BBC who did it ? Oh that's right fake news .
If you believe this garbage again you need to seek HELP,,   war on terror is a hoax and so is their fabracted isis,,  the likes of the bbc is your real terrorists folks and its time you woke up to this fact,,

It's tough being a Muslim these days. To any fellow Muslims reading this ditch the ugly ass beards you guys have and dress like a regular westerner, that way people won't be able to suspect ur Muslim unless they ask. And females don't wear the hijab. Honestly for my Asian or middle eastern bros and sisters idk what you can do cos u stereotypically look and fit the description of a Muslim. Hope this helps
shame that bbc cow wasn't stampeded.
You can find below an Arms Control Center video tutorial (and its script) on bucket bomb effects in London and the relevant security measures (related to the recent incident in the London tube)\nhttp://armscontrol.eu/2017/09/bucket-bombs-in-london-effects-and-security-measures-video-tutorial/
so the train doors shut, then there was an expolsion and she ran for her life? so presumably she has suoer human traits and can oass through glass?? there were layers of women underneath her screaming..??? not one bit of burn damge in carriage, no smasehd glass, and a smouldering little plastic bucket. a guy who said he was next to the so called bomb was injured? his hair was singed. she is taling aobut crush in a panic. the panic was the issue surely
Damage to the train carriage?

Emma Stevie works at Delamar Academy, famous for doing make-up for films and TV. What's the connection there? Why isn't she even slightly upset, if she's been in a human pile-up and seen a kid with his face smashed in? Why has she been hanging around all day? Maybe for the free pizza and water, which were arranged in advance for the drill taking place?

Look it up: Emma Stevie is a actress and model.... would give her a 7 out of 0-10 scale, for her performance.
To be able to give such a coherent interview after being caught up in a terrorist attack is beyond me! Our stiff upper lip attitude, as shown by Emma, is why we will always prevail.
what a liar...NOBODY was hurt during this false flag staged event...what a joke...

hey James can you read you and Jaiden's fanfic.PLEASE!!!!!!!
I'm from Argentina but yesterday I returned from Australia and one time I went to talk to my trip guide and asked her for directions to the bathroom, she said the dunnies are just there my dear and I was like: I'm asking you where's the toilet honey, you don't understand do you? so there was I, staring at her just peeing myself, so after getting lost 2 times and walking like an idiot in front of the Opera House like 5 times I got to the toilet. Thank you for nothing, stupid trip guide
Another rule in Australia, never say anything bad about Vegemite, it's basically like your spitting on our flag🇦🇺
i am in assie well i am assie
THIS IS INSULTING TO US AUSTRALIANS YOU JERK °^°
Guys I'm American but if you met me without hearing my voice and I did an Australian accent,you would think I'm Aussie. 😐
there is sooo much sexual tension here <3
Sorry for being late to your video but I really love your channel you are so funny 😂 You always put a smile on my face
I feel so bad for you eating Vegemite, I couldn't get past the smell. Just- No. Food should not smell like a footballer's sweaty jockstrap after it's been lost in a footlocker for a year and started growing its own civilization.
I am an Aussie and I say FUCK!!!! So yeah \nHalf these words I don't know \nI see a lot of people drinking beer
Moccasins are not a Australian slang word.
I don't know if it's just my familly and people we know but we call ourselves Arizonians.
This just proves Australian people are very nice but no one understands them
We have timtams in Ohio tho
Did you see the Gabbie show  singing
I Love Your Videos I Have Been Subscribed For 1 Year Now! ❤️
Lol when Jazza brought out the Vegemite, I was like 'yaaas the Australian version of our marmite!!! I love it!!!' 😂😂
I never knew James was a lefty
I had veggie might once on some crackers and it was at my Australian friends birth day it was not bad but I had no idea that is was an Australian thing
I was not prepared for that Steve Erwin reference James 😭
I myself am not an Austailian, but even I new at least half of these, it was funny to watch tho
hey James I met you at vidcon aus and I was extremely awkward and did finger guns and said nothing lmao sorry
Wait they dont have Twisties and Tim Tams in america, wow.
Omg I am an Australian I don't know most of these
This helps me understand my friends thx
America doesn't have lamingtons?\n\nWhat a sad world they live in...
Gets killed by stingrays IS THAT REFERENCING WHAT I THINK IT IS?

I said, Do you speak-a my language? \nHe just smiled and gave me a vegemite sandwich.

The only reason I know what togs are is because of an ice cream commercial I saw . Search togs or undies if you want to see it.XD

A question from Jazza: How are you so doble jointed
Anzac biscuits
Paulinho 👏👏👏
i personally think hat people are too critical on denis duarez ..he always plays good
The Getafe goal was from Mars .
WE THE FANS OF BARCELONA, castigated PAULINHO....why? I mean seriously PAULINHO .....he is coming to D GREAT BARCELONA....NO PLZ ...but when he arrived to d great Barcelona,  MY Realmadrid, MU, Chelsea  fans  made fun of me and they used to say this is the level of barcelona ......What I replied them...wait and watch bcoz we are just fans and don't know the capability of other players who played in different countries and with different clubs....SCOUTS R THERE....and they brought him to D GREAT BARCELONA......IT MEANS, SOMETHING IS THERE........AND NOW important 3 PTS, due to this 3 pts, last  year we lost laliga .....
Where are the fouls done on suarez which shd have been penalties
FC Roma xD? 3rd kit is similar to roma no?
Asian football is improving, Japan has a very strong national side so does Iran! And China is starting to get on the right track as they are spending billions on the football not only buying big names from abroad but also on its youth program! I see China to top Asia in the next two decades time! They will have a very bright future
A clear penalty for getafe and a red card for pique but as always UEFAlona gets away with it
Neymar one of the best player out off the team but messi is wonderful
This team is nothing. They might as well trade Suarez and Messi.
5:03 lol, look at Jordi Alba getting on his knees! It´s been a while since Leo shot a freekick like that.
roberto is not for semedo position. If he wanted to replace him and give him some rest he should put vidal in and roberto is great in the midfielder, but really our midfielder sucked today but whatever new coach is doing it is working so far and new Kit away for barca this season is poor, red not cool at all, not barca colour at all.
suarez is turning to a shit striker.he has lost his mojo.very slow not skills can't play at wing.we need a.replacement
Dembele is the worst barca transfer ever!!
2:55 Kid behind 😂   Why he wears Boca Juniors Uniform in the game of Barca vs Getafe kkk

Gaku Shibasaki, legend in the making for Japan. He has scored against both Real Madrid and Barcelona, a feat you know Ronaldo and Messi will never accomplish
Paulinho balance was so damn good... and Lord Pique almost scored his 2nd own goal this season... \nInigo Martinez please join Barca..
what a goal from getafe player
Barca is great and the players are extraordinary
I would trade Suarez for Firmino on the blink of an eye...\nHe fights a lot,  pours sweat as hell but runs like he's lost and tries too hard to be great. Not the best striker for barça standards. Disappointing how predictable he can be. A great player anywhere else though.
shibasaki is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I m still looking that Barca game isnt good, they didnt deserve to win this game.
Start Paulinho and Denis Suarez the next game to send a message to rakitic and iniesta imo
How was pique not red carded
Paulinho.....saved us ....but the goal of tht japanese...datz a rocked
pique should be replace, he is too old as barcelona cb, maybe this is the right time for him to replace bartolomeu
I still don't understand why Tottenham sold Paulinho, even though China pays a lot for him.
Pique is always a poor performance
Messi is the GOAT. But this game, Paulinho and Denis Suarez showed Valverde why they should have the chance to play. Well done!\n\nPS: this kit looks amazing 😍😍
Barcelona fans : their not barca their is as roma...
an ugly games for barcelona standard, but win is a win, 3 points
Roberto is NOT an RB
The midfield is lacking once again .. Messi had to drop to midfield again to create chances. He's most effective as a false 9
FC Barcelona Players Ratings (My Opinion)\n\nTer Stegen (8,5) - Saved us today, Getafe attacks Ter Stegen saves. He was great today. The goal? It was long far from his fault. \n\nSergi Roberto (6) - Was not so good in the first half, lost the mark much. But he get better in the second half and did a great assist. We missed Semedo but Valverde did right by rest him. \n\nGerard Pique (4,5) - Pique was NOT good today. Did many wrongs and created many dangerous free kicks to Getafe, he could sent off. \n\nSamuel Umtiti (8,5) - Umtiti was our best player today, without him Getafe will easy win. He was Piques leader today. He could score, was a free header. \n\nJordi Alba (5) - This was Albas worst match in this season, he lost his mark many and was not so good offensive. \n\nSergio Busquets (7) - Everyone critizice Busi much but he is doing his job, control the midfield. But he could do better today, lost the ball sometimes. \n\nAndres Iniesta (5) - El maestro was not on fire today, it was right by Valverde that subs him after 45 min. \n\nIvan Rakitic (6) Was very bad in the first half but did it better in the second and it was right by Valverde that subs him also. \n\nOusmane Dembele - Played too little to get rating. But he saw awake and did some magical dribbles. Hope that the injury is not so dangerous. \n\nLuis Suarez (3) - For me Suarez was good in the first 20 min then he was worse than a elephant. Suarezito was our worst player today, hope he scores 2-3 goals on tuesday vs Eibar so he can be in good form. \n\nLionel Messi (7) - This was Messis worst match this season but still 7, why? Because he was the only player in the offensive, he created many chances and did a great assist. \n\nGerard Deuloefu (6) - Deulofeu was ok today in the first half good, created many corners but in the second bad. But he was good in the last 10 minutes of second half.\n\nDenis Suarez (8,5) - Our best player today with Umtiti. He did so well and created much. Strong by Valverde that subs him for Iniesta. Hope that he start on tuesday and that he can fight on start. The guy has big potential. \n\nPaulinho - Played to little to get ratings but he scored the winner and it was a FUCKING BEATY. He also silenced all Barca fans who critizced him and all Madrid-fans who teased him. King Paulinho! I hope he will start on tuesday. \n\nIt was not a good match but we did a good comeback and the best was 3 points. Big creed to Valverde. 4 games 4 wins, top of the table. See you on Tuesday cules! Visca El Barca y visca Catalunya!

sigo pensando que paulinho no vale eso :/
Cual es el nombre de los narradores
Pauliño marco, porque al defensor de Getafe le falta experiencia. Prácticamente lo dejo avanzar. Aunque le voy al Barcelona, reconozco las cosas como son. JUGARON MAL, El equipo no se acopla.  Este año no hay liga, ni copa, ni nada para el Barcelona. Este año solo Fichajes POPULISTAS, pero NINGÚN planteamiento serio. Jugadores MALOS. Mas de expectativas que de resultados!  Los buenos jugadores demuestran quien son, estén donde estén. Y ese grupito para mi no tiene nada especial de nada.
Que pase más espectacular de Messi
No soy fan de Barcelona pero ese uniforme está muy guapo, el color queda muy bien.
¿por qué el barca se parece a roma?
Vizça Barça....hay que darle minutos a Paulinho, ya verán que si es un gran fichaje en esta temporada, hay que tener paciencia y confianza.
Que chivo se a dejado el pelo messi y rakitic
ME PARECE QUE PAULINHO CUESTA 150 MILLONES Y DEMBÉLÉ SOLO 5 MILLONES CON VUELTO.
Paulinho the savior. Amem !!!

Sooooo, a lot of people are commenting on how the makeup showed your texture etc etc, but I actually LOVE that we could see it a little bit. So many girls look at IG and see super edited photos or watch youtube and see makeup/skin under studio lights and think that is how they are supposed to look. It's pretty and barbie doll skin is pretty to look at, but it ain't real! Not for most girls anyways! Also, about your brows-you can do it! Make dem brows full again! lol
4:20 she start doing her makeup\nYour welcome!!!
Girl, I'm in Tallahassee. We had no gas or water here either! It was like looking for Tickle Me Elmo out here!
Man i seen that thumbnail and just had to stop by and say looking beautiful sweetheart.
So happy to hear you and your family are okay 👍🏼❤️ Can't wait to see these amazing Halloween looks you have in store 👀👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I don't get this tooth diamond thing.... it looks like everyone has something stuck in their tooth.

It was like the walking dead out here Omg girl I love you! I live in Jupiter, FL so I completely relate. I lost power for 5days 😩
When I finally have a chance to meet you and tickets are sold out 😩😩😩😩
Oh, I was so worried about you! Good that Jeremy, your mom and you are safe and sound from the hurricane! Thank you for still making a video for us even though that must have been a scary experience to be in the house, hear the wind and having no electricity! The fall make-up look is great! :)
Same here in south Florida. We went only two days without power. We are extremely lucky. We offered everyone we know our home. Some got power back, some haven't yet. Happy you and loved ones are safe. In the process of helping family in Puerto Rico and helping people from the keys and Naples.
Yay!  Glad to hear you came through it so well :). I have family in Clearwater and st. Pete, and I live in lake county?  That was a looooooong night, def scary!!  We were without power for three days, but it could have been so much worse :/ I'm sooooooo pumped for your Halloween looks, I look forward to them every year!!
Hi I'm your new subscriber from Belize. Love your videos.
Glad you and your family are okay! I live in Florida (WPB) too and girl, the struggle was real just like you described! No water or gas anywhere! This hurricane was crazy!
Beautiful as always ❤️
No shade but...Alittle to much blush sorry

Glad to hear you're okay!! 🙏
Glad everyone is safe! Can you please do the night king from GOT for Halloween? You would kill it!!!

Thank you for filling the void in our hearts that will be the next 2 years. Hope you guys will release more content until season 8. We scrape for the smallest scraps, that is Game of Thrones crack!
Can we get Robert's Rebellion:The Animated Series?
Why haven't they made a GOT video game?
I can't wait to see the next part..😦😧😱😱
When is the next video coming.......
Release the rest of it before I piss meself.

There was a crown on the collar of the Stag in Baratheon sigil which was added after the Rebellion against Targaryens when Robert took the throne. An ironic mistake for this video
looks like Heroes of might and magic intro. WTF???
Yo, I was ready for an hour of this.
Which family held the Riverland
I guess this means there'd be no Game of Thrones: Origins
Damn, that was good. More, please.
Dragonstone was already a castle before the tararyens fled. They didn't just run to an abandoned island
who the hell dislikes this stuff
we need more of these with that 2 year wait until next season
Wonder why they're making these? *hint those three series that HBO is setting in the Ice and Fire universe that may or may not require a bit more backstory to completely understand*
Aegon fucked he's aunt.... The other Aegon
They would have done it with Jony Ive.
Is it just me or did he just  insult both of his wife's house and most of the 7 Kingdoms
GIVE. ME. MORE..\nPLEASE
Thank you for that information Viserys! :)
Aegon's conquest of Westeros lasted about one year, he had 3 dragons and not a very large army. \nIf the Doom has not happened, Valiryans would probably have look west at one point and start to conquer Westeros with their 300 dragons and tens of thousens troops. \nFuck, they would only need a week.
What is the song in 2:51?
FROM THE BOTOM OF MY HEART shut up and take my money
Wow this looks cool they should make a tv series it would be a hit!
I was so waiting for something like this.
This looks terrible! you win millions with the show!!! spent some in it motherfuckers!
What THE FUCK where is the rest????
I could watch an hour long version of this ...
Who is the narrator in this video??
This will probably be in the spin off prequel series.
This show is amazing, they could do like they walking dead,by making another série with this stories from the beggining, só awesomeeeeeeee
Hope they had elevators back then in Valyria. ^^'
They spent so of much of their budget on the main show they didn't have enough for this
This is the actor who played Viserys doing the voice over, is it not?
IM a Queen! 👑 Not YOU! 💖💖💖
So much time and effort for this animated vid. Thank you!
Is no one gonna comment dat dragon animation?
i want to know history of humans with mythival creatures😍
Okay where is the rest of it
I'd kill for a GoT animated series like castlevania
Should totally link up with like ea and project cd red and make a super hyper realistic RPG game of thrones game and like yea make it happen lol
Viserys should do more of this
Well done Hbo is there any more videos like these there amazing
That's cool they've gotten Harry Lloyd to come back and do narrations, even into season 7.
The Rock Died during stunt????     https://youtu.be/dhrKxH4JyrI

Lovely voice, great narrative from Viserys. Shame his loud mouth got him roasted by Khal Drogo...ahahaha.

Probably because nobody else wanted them -- and yet the most desirable area to live in the world, Southern California, is in a desert yet whoever made this video couldn't resist basically saying house dorne is shit and the stormlands or the incredibly cold north are somehow desirable? The story of dorne and house martell is actually really interesting ...the narrator, who I presume is viserys, is a fucking idiot desert lands are not undesirable just because it's hot and dry otherwise why would people go to places like Vegas or live in hot climates like Southern California. Idiots
Is it me or do the dragons look like they are from Skyrim?

Guys I know about the fake links but I just wanted to tell you YouTube does freeze it views. It's intentional. They are checking the authenticity of the views to check for bots and false ways. The views are still being counted but not shown. I don't know if those links do that too or not but YouTube does it itself too
Ok so on my other comment about bts and exols i have been getting alot of replies saying to stop assuming things. Im also an exol so i have no reason to hate on them and try to cause problems. I do believe that exols do have something to do with the bts shit because they have even tweeted on twitter about bts only coming back because of exo and called us an army of cockroaches and have even said stuff about their plan to ruin bts. What am i supposed to think after hearing this? Im only defending us as a family (because army is one and oml that exo reference😂) i love exo as well. I truely apologize if its not the exols doing this but you just never know with all of the shit they have done to try and ruin bts before
Back they are to save the day♡♡

Ga sabar D-1
I love you taetae!😍🎉🎊
Now i know why my daughter is always telling about BTS. 😁😁 no wonder she tried very hard in study to earn money to support this comeback's album. As long as my daughter loves bts, i do too.
Anyone knows what taehyung says?
So who said DNA, because it sounds like SUHO from EXO
Omg what's with the views? So slow! .-.
Guys, so what time is the song doing to be released? ??
Guysss plsss dont click any link in the comments bc it will freeze the views and especially if you see the ibighit rewards kindly report the comment thank you lets be careful bc we all ARMYs want to give the love and a successful cb of bts fighting!💞
The original Danny Tanner was a curly blonde with blue eyes(John Posey) The whole original pilot had another guy in it to begin with. Same cast, minus Bob sagat...so actually ...they are HIS kids...Bob sagat is an alien who killed the original father, wiped everyone's memory, and took over
SO WHAT'S THE INSANE THERORY THAT GGG VS. CANELO WAS A DRAW ? 🤔😐
i think joey gladstone boned your mom , and i dont care if your blonde or not , i think you miss your daddy joey!
Thanks. I'm going to go kill myself now
Seriously.  Full house does not have hidden secrets.  Besides, how would this theory work at all besides the hair color aspect?  It makes no sense.  If you want to here a theory just watch a fnaf theory or something.
Joey uses comedy to hide his dark past. Cut it out, or I'll cut you is what he use to say before he decided to just shorten it to Cut it out.
I'm blonde just like my 2 brothers and my dad have black hair and my mom is blonde so that doesn't mean where are not his children and just because the blond milkman live with us doesn't mean he is my father
The twin's hair color can be answered\n\nI don't know how to explain it without using an example so I'll use myself. Both of my parents have dark hair, but we're both blonde growing up. I grew up with blonde hair, and it started darkening when I was 13. The same thing could be happening for the twins. But I haven't seen Fuller House yet so I have no idea if the twins look different or not (or if they're even there).
MY BEST FRIENDS GIRL FRIENDS THAT USED TO BE MINEEEE
Or it's just a fucking retarded family friendly sitcom, you know?
When cracked doesn't take recessive genes into account
Well that destroyed me.....
It's a freakin show
They didn't pick the actors based on their hair color, it's just a coincidence that all 3 girls have blonde hair
Not gonna lie, I would sleep with Joey too 😜
Ah, Daddy Tanner might have recessive  blond genes. if two people had heterogeneous genes like Xx and Yy then there's a 25 percent for each kid to have blond hair. All my nieces have blue eyes blonde hair when both their parents have brown hair and eyes.\nIt would have made more sense that Joey lived near by and came almost everyday to the point he became an honorary uncle.
So, basically, hair color... Try harder or just shut the site down, you lazy motherfuckers.
That was the dumbest shit i have ever had the misfortune of viewing
This is what happens when you dont cut it out kids
So he screwed over Alanis and now this? *Throws things*
When they were making this show and casting actors I really don't think they went into this much detail TBH....
You know who else was blonde? Comet. That's another theory for another time.
Someone needs to get a Life!!
Yes... Why would a constantly broke aspiring comedian want to live rent free with his best friend in his house in one of the most expensive living areas in the United States. It is a mystery!\nSeriously, I would stay with the Tanners if I could as well. It's an awesome family.
Almost as if theyre actors and theyre not really his daughters
was i the only one who saw truf????
I always wondered why Joey just lived with his friend like that.... Now I may know
You should come to my channel for a slice of pizza I post pizza daily and there's enough for everyone
Watch the Full House new song.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YlnWvKTp-w&feature=youtu.be
That's some Game of Thrones level shit
those kids turned to shit
Lisen here you stupid bitch it is a TV show not real life they are fucking actors its not their actual children they would have to go through a lot to make it perfect for you so that the genetics lined up.
makes sense, wish it was longer
MMMMMM kids drugs are bad dont be like these guys
Help, my dad has blonde hair and my mom has brown hair, I think Joey might be my real mom!
My parents have brown hair, brown eyes. My sister and I have blue eyes and blond hair. I know my dad is my biological dad because, other than color, I look like a female version of him.
Yeah but the kids mom is blonde and they can have blonde hair is possible
Wtf! I did NOT expect that when I hit  watch!
Lol this is stupid and not elaborate at all
Check out my newest vlog, it's insane!!!
I want to hangout with Joey
Cracked now summarizes other people's ideas and calls it a video. This is why i stopped watching.
How I feel right now \nhttps://youtu.be/JAYj2vjKmLo
Has anyone realized that this is just a sitcom?
Follow me on instagram @_fer00 for a shoutout..
Maybe someone in his family had blond hair genes can skip a generation
How the fuck did uncle Jesse just get more beautiful with age
In fuller house Joey has FOUR CHILDREN 😳
it's a fucking tv show. also most children are blonde when they are young & their hair gets darker as they grow up.
You know how many people are born blonde and as they grow older they naturally become brunettes? This video is partially inaccurate
Why does it always have to go to cheating...? Perhaps Danny and his wife were having trouble conceiving and best friend Joey steps in to be a donor. Then he stays with them as uncle Joey for 8 years because at the end of the day it's still his own biological children even if Danny is their father.
watch my newest video for a free car
Or maybe they're  A C T O R S  and this show  I S N ' T  R E A L  L I F E
Sounds like an episode from cheaters.
Maybe Joey just needed a place to crash.

I dont wan to be next t her in the mornings fake women
8:56 -\nTaylor: okay guys it's now 4:11 \niPhone: 4:31 \n😂😂😂
You should review the L'oreal LUMI foundation!
Omg Taylor you made the trending page!
You should try more Korean Beauty Products, some of them are really good and inexpensive. (A few recommendations would be Etude House Long Lasting Foundation, Etude House AC Clinic cushion, Innisfree No Sebum Mineral Powder, they are pretty good. )\nAnd thank you for uploading great videos each week~~~❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gtfo if you don't fuck with fenty
This is my first video but it's cute how all the comments are people being just really happy about your videos.
After being spoiled for 15 days straight with a new video every day I feel so empty inside, I need my daily dose
Could you do a video on the Too Faced Hangover RX Primer? I'm curious how it works for textured skin
I've tried a chapstick and some skin care from Burt's bees, but I hate smell of their stuff. I hate the scent of honey and a lot of their products smell like vomit to me😝
You look like snow white 😍😍
Sometimes I love drugstore products more than high end. Great review boo😘
15 on trending? jEEZ i'm so so proud of you i love this series and you so much 💕
Loved this series I immediately had to subscribe thank you for doing these and being so honest!!!! You're beautiful and extremely talented. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Hey I'm new lol
Burts Bees wasn't cruelty free but they became CF recently :)\n\nAnd awesome review! I really like your swatch comparisons because they help me figure out what shade will work for other brands as well
Hey girl... I'm a newbie! YOU are stunning!
To comment on her saying that Burt's Bees is cruelty free: \nWhile Burt's Bees is technically cruelty free, they are owned by the Clorox company, who is definitely not cruelty free at all. So they trick you into buying their products, while your money actually goes into the hands of people who test on animals. Just some food for thought🐝
Not new, but I did find you through a foundation video! (Not part of this series!)
It also oxidized quite a bit
I really wish she did the comparing swatches with some drugstore foundations as well because I don't have any foundations over $15
Thanks for all your great videos! I was wondering what your favorite eyeshadow pallette is. I love the red and burnt orange colors on your eyes and my eyes are close to your color. Dying to find a pallet like that! Thanks so much!
This was mostly high end, but you mostly hated them lol. Soooo whatever people.
I was lookin at some of your old videos and saw your drugstore makeup starter kit ones...how about an update one? Always nice to hear your opinions and advice, especially when it comes to foundation/bb cream. Btw, have u used the lumene bb cream at all since ur...2015? Video? :)
I looked and I don't think you have tried the original loreal infallible foundation. It comes in a bottle and has a red pump. It's one of my favorites.
Does anyone came here today just hoping some extra vid will pop out?  Ha hahahahaha I did 😢
looking forward to a UK make up haul. No7, Iconic London, Barry M, Sleek, maybe even  Illamaqua.\nAlso dying for a full face of K-beauty skincare&makeup :)))
I love making videos. Any small youtubers wanna support eachother!
Love the lip color!!
I know you have done a video of when you got your eyelash extensions, and how they wore after some time. Idk if you have done a video on how you take care of them though, and I would LOVE to see a video on the way you care for them. I get eyelash extensions but mine seem to fall off quicker. Maybe I just overly comb thru or use too much cleaner when I watch, I'm not sure. But, yeah please do a video on how you care for your lash extensions!!
BURTS BEES IS NOT CRUELTY FREE! THEY SELL IN CHINA! http://www.crueltyfreekitty.com/news/burts-bees-no-longer-cruelty-free/
You should try the clarisns everlasting foundation, I havent found a review on it
I just recently started watching your videos and I just wanted to say you are beautiful! I just recently started getting bad acne again because I stopped taking birth control, so see what works for you really helps!
Super sad this is over...(I'm watching whilst on holiday in Egypt 😂) please please please do a 'best of the best' from all of the 15 days of foundation 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Can you try the 200$ foundation not sure what thr brand name is
It's on trending ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I hate seeing the finished product at the beginning of the video it ruins it for me 😭 I always try to fast forward it to the part where you have no makeup on before I see the finished product at the beginning
Girl I'm so sorry but u look like a ghost vampire in that shade
Yay!! You made on the trending list!!
I appreciate you reviewing. Many youtubers have perfect skin and it's not realistic for all viewers who need a recommendation. Keep it up bae ❤️
You're on the trending page!! So happy for you!!
Thank you for this series! I've enjoyed following along for #15daysoffoundation !
Burst bees was sold off to a huge company.Theyre pretty crappy now, low quality and questionable practices now. The hippies that started the company sold out. \nThe lip balm taste like elmers glue and asprin. It's gross af.
Omg it's over!! This is my 3rd live 15 DoF! It always goes by so quick!
So happy you've been trending!
Maybe it's different lighting, but it almost seems like the color changed by the end of the night as well.
Taylor, I gotta say, your videos this series have been part of my happiness in getting through my first weeks of college! always such an good way to end my day :)
You are amazing! Have a wonderful trip! I hope you feel 100% the whole time, you deserve it!
Discovered your channel thru this series & this is def one of my new fav channels. Love how honest and just real you are. So glad I found your channel !💙
New #baerrito here! This was my first live season and I'm committed! You're the only YouTuber whose skin is very similar to mine (considering shade, texture and acne). 🖤 luv ya!
This is probably the first time i see a foundation sits like a mask on you. Did you notice that by the third check in your foundation had a green tint to it?
Heyyyyy I joined you on your 4th day and now I tried some foundations you found too :) thank you!!
Omg you didn't put foundation on the one side of your nose. 😭
Wait did anyone notice we're number 10 on trending?
New to your channel but I love this series! Do you do a wrap-up at the end of the 15 days? Rating the foundations or letting us know your top picks
Nooooo this series went to fast!  Mmm I think you only have like 3 foundation that looks gorgeous and other maybe and a lot of nono.  But beside that all the looks on your eyes and lipstick choice are amazing.
This was my first 15 days! Loved it and how honest you are :)
New here! Found you threw the 15 days of foundation
What is your skin type?
Can you do a full foundation collection hits or misses and top 10 foundations.
Awe :( I wanted this foundation to be good. Guess it was too good to be true.
you look like snow white girly, I don't watch ur vids but you were in the trending I just had to say that!!

I was in Paris last week!!!!
What target audience  is your book geared towards . Looks beautiful there . What desserts r popular ? I say it again I love those yellow tight . I been inspired to find them here in Nashville . 💞😘
You should do a pub crawl in Ireland, and eat and drink and go through rules for tourists going to a bar (the dos and don't)!
you're the only person that's able to eat a peach and not look like a mess after 🙏🏼 love ya💗\nand nutella is italian i guess
I loved this and i really want to go to Paris!
Oh my god Melanie was literally talking about Dan Browns book and I was freaking out didn't know you like it Mel! I love it!! Ohh I am so excited rn😂
Aww I live in Paris, always have! You made me want to go back out there and explore with my tourist glasses on <3
My absolute favourite video of yours! The music, the filming, it was magical Melanie 💚
loving the stromae covers in this!! #toutlememe
all the french music i loveee it, also gonna go watch the hunchback of the Notre Damme now
Your outfit in this and hair remind me of Amelie !
I love that you used Lindsey Stirling in this. 😊
I feel so relaxed happy and also sad and rested but also feeling a calm restlessness. Beautiful vlog. There are many Pari vlogs, but this one is so different from those. Music helped the vlog a lot. Melanie you went up a notch with this one👌👌👌
Only 3 minutes in and this vlog is perfect
I can't wait until I get to move there 😢😢
Its been so many years since i was in paris. Would love to go back!
Paris looks gorgeous!! <3 & loved the red dress Melanie!\nIn case no one mentioned it yet, the first fruit you pointed out were prickly pears :D we get them lots in Malta!
I would love to go to Paris with you  next time 😁 And pls come to Norway and make a food vlog  😊
Your fringe looks like a lot like Amelie's when you were at the Café des 2 moulins... omg I really want to go there 😍
I got way too excited when you showed the Two Windmills. Amelie is my favorite movie.
Love all your dresses! I am so ready for that shape to come back into style cos my thighs aren't having this bodycon shit!
Such a nice video. I love France!
This gave me major Paris blues. It's my favourite place in the entire world! <3. I would love for you to do a food diary in Krakow, Poland xx
I love that Melanie says a little espresso, it's very cute. But actually that's the real size of an espresso in Italy, it's how it is supposed to be! Btw Nutella is Italian too.
This video gave me butterflies in my stomach! I loved everything about it and you make me feel so calm and happy! Love you! xxxx
You're so fit 😍 Wanna see you with black hair again.
Isn't it fun getting to the point where you can eat in moderation and have a good time!!!! 💘
What a great video! We got to see Paris with a Melanie voiceover. :)  Nice. BTW, the red dress looks great on you IMHO.
That was a freaking joy to watch!!! Thank you for that wonderful morning boost Melanie. I loved your editing too btw with the beautiful French music, and beautiful choices too, it was so well done!! :D xx
I just died at 13:01. You are so great xD
Ethical omnivorism:):):):) yet...you have no idea where your salmon etc came from! LOVE IT !!!! You're so logical and smart Melanie!!!!!
Loved this video!!! Made me want to go to Paris so bad, especially with someone as lovely as you Mel :)
The Hunchback of Notre Dame is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Disney movie, and it is CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED!  THANK YOU for loving it too!  I'm glad you had such a fun time!
Hehehe, I joined in with your devious laugh at 6:46. You did a wonderful job putting this vlog together! The music, food, and everything else just complimented it so well. I also want to add that you looked unbelievably gorgeous in each dress. Seems like you had a great time!
Being a giant Les mis fan the music made this video so great!!! Loved it Mel, great video!!:) 😘
Melanie, where is your coat from??! 💚
Have you heard the original of Tous les memes by Stromae? It's the best!!
OMG. When you laugh at the bread penis!! You are so cute hahahah! And the mini mini banane ^^
I love this vlog ! Paris is so lovely ! I appreciate so much your good taste in french music in this video ! 😊😊😊
Currently eating a giant package of crisps...
Those weird fruit look like Tunas, we have them here in Chile, don't know if the ones in Paris are the same, but if they are, try them, they're DELICIOUS and juicy, perfect for summer!
Wonderful video!!!! (As always) 😊 also where are your boots from? I'm on the look out for a pair for the wintery months and your ones are perfect!
Where is that stripey red/pink and white shirt from?
Noooo, Nutella is an Italian product ❤ It was created by the Ferrero family, who lives in Alba, Piedmont (northern Italy). You should definitely come and visit this beautiful city, where you can find scrumptious food as well as fine wine 😉 By the way, love your channel ❤
i LOVE DaVinci Code! Also, would you belive ive Never tried nutella before? not sure why.
really really really enjoyed this video much love :)
Aaaaaw i have missed the fdf!!! Love love love it.❤️\nWould you ever Concider doing Daily vlogs once in awhile? That would be amazing, you are simply an incredible inspiration!\nHuuuuuge respect!\nLove💚
I'm so happy you enjoyed your stay! The weather was absolute crap this past week, but the food sure makes up for it :) Please do come back, we always welcome beautiful mademoiselle in the ville des lumières <3
Hi Melanie!! Loved the vlog, you should go to Italy next time for a food diary and ps. Your dad is hilarious, he should be more in the vlogs!!
You saying wow like owen wilson killed me 😂
OH MY GOD Melanie it feels so weird that you were in my city!! My favorite place is Beaubourg (you're there at 2:49)! Such a shame I had classes these days we could have crossed paths<3
I loved this <3 The music was so perfect for this vlog too! xxx
omg where did you get your yellow coat from?? it's gorg!!
glad you enjoyed paris, but i was visiting dublin while you were away, which sucks thought i might bump into you!! saw your book in stores for the first time and was v proud <33
I miss Paris so much 😭😭
Love your new hairstyle..especially your fringe :)..btw nutella is actually Italian :)
Loved the style of this vlog so much, Mel! Very raw and artistic... Also, loved seeing u in Paris, you look like Amelie so much with your new fringe, I could totally see you living in a cute apartment in Montmartre, wearing those dresses! All the beige food ahhh, I swear I could live off baguettes in Paris! 💛
ugh this makes me want to go to Paris and eat and drink everything!
this is great please do more food diaries!! any country would be cool, i love seeing food from around the world
Nooooo, you were there and I didn't know ! You were soooo close to me when you were at hôtel de ville, notre dame, le gay choc and le Louvre . Maybe next time if you need some advise 🤷🏾‍♀️.
Such an enchanting little film of Paris! <3 xx
I'm so jealous!! Paris is my absolute dream 😍 What's it like being an English speaking tourist there? I've been learning French the past two years, but I still barely understand it lol. But I want to go soon!!
I am going to be in paris as well in 2 days 😊 maybe i will see you there :)) are the People nice there ?
You look so happy in this video ❤ And you made me hungry again...
You might think of me as an ungrateful idiot but I live just outside of Paris and work in the center Paris but I don't like Paris. I have many reasons but the main one is that I was born and grew up in the French countryside, the seaside specifically and I miss it so very much. Anyway, I'm glad you enjoyed your stay so much that you want to come back, it's true that the city has a lot to offer and I liked it for visit but living here is definitely not for me. Maybe I'll see you around when/if you come back :)
It is SO refreshing to watch someone enjoying food actually, not restricting ❤️✨
Gahhhhh this makes me miss Paris so much.
mel - you look gorgeous! Love your outfit x
So so happy to see the return of Food Diary Fridays!!!!!!!!!! 💖
OmGOD you're acutally such a great vlogger!!! i really enjoyed this one <33 you can film a food diary in Amsterdam lots of love
I loved this so much. I had such stronge waves of wonderlust throughout the entire video. 💛💛
Aaah what a beautiful video! You have me dreaming of travel 💕
This gave me all the feels, Mel! I've dreamed about going to Paris since I was little girl. And yes I can relate as a disney fan I mean are you kidding meee. x
I'm on my period too...😂..you look wonderful and happy😍i love your food vlogs and videos with your family❤💋❤💋❤i think nutella is from switserland
That Fruit 6.13 in France really wowww cool yumm, prickly pears are my fav, use to pick em' on cousins property, never see em' in stores where i live - yay France is Cool! Naww Amelie gotta dig it out of the cupboard haven't seen in too long! And don't get me started on Disney aww it's simply love. Your outfits were on point, cute dresses, that coat yess ftw
i feel so at home whenever i watch any of melanie's videos that's the only way i can describe it
Hi Mel! In fact, Nutella is Italian! It was invented by Ferrero during the war as a surrogate food, then they improved the recipe and it became the actual Nutella that everyone knows :) Btw I've just ordered your book on Amazon ;)
Nutella was made in Italy :)
🎶🌹💗
Nutella is Italian!!!!
You look a bit like Amelie in that red dress you bought. Glad you enjoyed the day in Paris. I wish I could go back so much. To add to your francophone music musings look up the artist Zaz. I feel like you'd like her style and would match the soundtrack of this vlog a bit.

Ahhh, beautiful France!!
Love dis 👌🏻
Penis Pastry 😂
That red dress 😍
ugh you're so lovely
Nutella is Italiaaaan!
This movie better be good. I want to see Kevin Spacey in only good movies from here on.
No director holds a candle to Ridley
why does every trailer have a 3-second pre-trailer now? fucking stupid
Subscribe to us for a subscribe back!💖
wow FINALLY 1 high budget film I will pay theater price to go see :-D WTH has happen in Hollywood lately there is not crap out now>? My lands how I miss the Forrest Gump and Titanic and Blockbuster days of new awesome rentals of which is all gone now. Hmm who funded this film? China?
Hah, I actually heard about this story years ago. Which I guess spoils the movie, but I'll just say the story is interesting.
Is this based on a true story
Michelle is playing 50 year old mothers now? Oh Hollywood
December can't come soon enough.
To be honest, I agree with Mr Getty and disagree with the bitches who want to pay the ransom.  The main problem is that kidnapping has become a lucrative business when people will pay them well.  Paying the ransom would be supporting terrorism.  In addition, there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will be rewarded with his release.
can we please stop having a trailer before the trailer
I though I've seen this with Mel Gibson and RENEE Ruso.
Way to capitalize on peoples frustration with the shrinking of our middle class
Moral of the story:\nDon't neglect instilling common sense in to your daughter.
I almost didn't recognize Michelle Williams. She changed up her voice. Looks like a great performance🍿🤗📽
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's a Getty
*sees Mark*\nYeah I'm watching that
What's the name of the song?
Here's the twist: Mr. Getting has hired a trained militia to recover his grandson in secret.
Willie D brought me here
1:55 you can see the camera guy in gettys sunglasses
Whats the song playing in the backround
If I see Marky Mark, I click.
Is that Oscar bait I smell
I like money and I approve this movie
FACT:  THIS MOVIE IS 100% PROOF THAT THE 1 % ELITE ARE THE TOXIC SCUM OF THE WORLD!  THEY WON'T EVEN PAY A PENNY TO SAVE THIER OWN GENES!  EVERYTHING AROUND THEM IS DISPOSABLE!  THEY ARE LITERALLY DEMONS WALKING ON EARTH!   (one day 9 billion souls will ERADICATE their gene pools)!
Cashless society money don't mean anything...
👁
Ridley Scott is amazing.
Wahlberg is so boring.
Opulence, I has it.
Is this about Roclefeller ?
Cliche
Wow
Finally, Mark Whalberg is going for the serious and true acting roles.
Negotiating is very easy if you know how
he's a savage.
Mark Wahlberg is a terrible non comedy actor.
I'd like to have money but, not that much. To be born a Getty would suck, you'd be so spoiled, you'd never know or experience what it's like to be a real human being. Your life would be fake.
What's the song
When the night... has come....dun dun dun...and the land is dark
Mansa Musa was the richest man ever documented
seems like there are only 5 actors in the world.....i can act but not lucky, rich, or lucky, or rich, or lucky. oh and three of the 5 actors are samuel l jackson.
So glad to see Michelle Williams get another lead role. She takes on such emotionally difficult roles and plays them all so brilliantly.
lies i tell you... not the richest man ever. That would be Mansa Musa!
I won't remember this by December
I remember reading that the kid that gets kidnapped never recovered from this traumatic experience. I'm very much interested in seeing this film after seeing this trailer.
So this is a prequel to It.
The richest man in history was king mansa musa though lol
I smell an Oscar! The statue. Not the Muppet from... nvm.
Isn't Gigi Gorgeous dating someone from that family?
I can't even see a Kevin Soacey under those prosthetics after the trailer told me it's him.
My old barber who passed away once got a ride from him on the way to school when Paul lived in the Tulsa Area.
Riches man in history was mansa musa of Mali
Ridley Scott sure snaps back from being the one of the worst director today to one of the best quickly
Has to be a Rothschild movie..
Great song choice for this trailer
John D Rockefeller was 50x richer than this guy.
What's with the Spa-Getty jokes? Lmao
Spacey’s character did the right thing, at least in the trailer. It’s his money, and he has no obligation to pay the ransom for one of his many grandchildren. Had he payed the ransom, there would have been guarantee that the grandchild would have returned unharmed or even alive. Also, the kidnappers would have been emboldened and they or some other group would have kidnapped others from his family and bled him dry.
Is this a true story
Oh HELL yes- first of all, RIDLEY SCOTT. Second, Mark Wahlberg. Third. Kevin Spacey NOT being Kevin Spacey but actually being BETTER than Kevin Spacey could BE Kevin Spacey. Fourth, that was a prettyyyyy, pretttyyy, pretty good trailer.
I love the recontextualization/use of the Time of the Season.
Wait... That's Kevin Spacey?!
Man I love Mark!
THAT CASTING TWIST AT THE END WOW
They should call this movie *The Rothchilds*
Im a simple man i see something good i watch
Reminds me of my grandfather .. lol he’s dead now
I don't know why, But I like it.
Ok that's it. I wanna watch this movie.
For a second I thought it wasn't going to be an action movie but of fucking course..
Props to the people who made the trailer.
Why all of Sony movies visually  dark toned ? I like it but they need to create a war movie in this dark tone even a futuristic thriller with robots goin bad. The dark tone for a futuristic happy setting will be something never seen like the way Sony could do it
Our society needs to stop worshipping wealthy people. It's just sad.
Lol.  I thought Getty was being played by Robert Duval
Wow, this trailer is so well put together and the song choice is on point!
JULIAN MOORE JACKING OFF GUY
Name of song?
Darude - Sandstorm
Mark wahlburg?? Automatically a hit movie
We want 17 million dollars!!!\nNo problem, here you go...
interesting..
1:12 Roll credits.
The emoji movie was better
Smithers, release the hounds.
Rothschild
Rhyme Or Reason 😂😂
Getty images?
sooo they just gone forget Mansa Musa...
Richer than me?\n\n-Rothschild
Whats the song?
Kill the rich.
Future Oscar nominee 👏🏻
Wow
Rorthchild?
8خان
https://youtu.be/K3r7rjGVdfo
Lemme guess this movie is another action movie with nothing but sex, violence, and gore. It does look like has a good message though.
A movie about Mansa Musa would be interesting. The real richest man in the world
Congrats! Looking as beautiful as ever!
Love it ♥️
Everyone is Aus absolutely rave about Bonds wondersuits!
You look so lovely! :)
Such a cute bump!
I've had my belly button pierced for about five years and I'm currently 28 weeks pregnant. I've taken my belly button bar out months ago and the hole is still open so I wouldn't worry about it closing up. From what my friends have said (they had their belly buttons pierced also and since have had children) it's personal preference based on what your belly will look like after you've had the baby for you to decide if you want to put it back in. I've got friends who's bellies have gone back to their pre-pregnancy state , and some who's belly buttons have been extremely stretched and covered in stretch marks. So just see what you feel like after 😘 all the best to your little family , you're looking lovely 🌸💕 xxx
fleur bonds zippies are amazing! both my babes lived in then x
You look absolutely AMAZING!!!!!! Be proud of that cute baby bump, of course your body is going to change and you are going to put on some weight in places you ordinarily wouldn't, but ultimately it will all be worth it when you hold your baby girl in your arms. It is then you realize how insignificant body change is  lol Enjoy being pregnant and continue to be the inspiring, joyful soul your are. 👍
Hi 😁 I had my little girl in Dec, I took mine out around 20 weeks. The little bit of skin stretched in the middle of the bars stretched when i was bigger but it all went back to normal a few months later. I did jam it back thru the hole a few months ago... so it closed over and I have had my for 15 years without any issues until now. Iv just left it out now and it seems to be closing over. I was scared carrying a baby around and lifting prams etc it would get stuck an rip out or something. Anyway good luck I hope that helps 😁😁😁
You look fabulous, Fleur!  XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA
I took my belly bar out and never put it back in as my tummy wasn't the same .-(
You can get maternity belly rings. They make them soft as well so you won't have any chafing problems. You can find them on Amazon.
I took out my belly button piercing and didn't put it back in. Felt it was more comfortable like that. I don't think u need to worry about the hole closing as it took mine a while before it did that.
I ♥️ squidge and trekle they are so cute and want your attention so badly 💔 great video though 👍🏼
I had a piercing with my first pregnancy and bought a flexible bar for the later stages but I found it too uncomfortable when my bump got bigger so I decided to take it out completely. I just didn't bother putting it back in afterwards, that was just my personal choice, but could have if I'd wanted to. I've been left with a slightly stretched piercing hole, which looks like a scar. Not that horrendous to look at really but that said I do regret not putting it back in afterwards.
I absolutely love these pregnancy updates! I especially love how chilled and honest they seem. I'm not a mum and don't plan on becoming one for a fair few years, but I find these videos so entertaining and nice to watch. I love your normal content and I really love theses videos!! So happy all has gone well so far, I hope your good luck continues through your entire pregnancy! So nice to see that the baby and mum are both healthy and happy!
I have had 2 babies and my belly button piercing never closed up. I think you will be fine to just take it out and put it back in once she's born.
I love the Pregnancy updates! <3 stay healthy
Your happiness is palpable! Thanks for sharing this with everyone!
Hello Fleur :) Regarding the piercing, I haven't been pregnant, nor do I have a piercing myself but I recently talked to a gynecologist about it an he said to take it out as soon as the belly grows and put in a little plastic spacer... This spacer is flexible and basically looks like a plain piercing and it  prevents the piercing to heal up! And when you've had your little one you can put your piercing back in. \nAnd I guess you can get the spacer at a piercing shop? Dunno. \nHope this helped you :) Good luck with your piercing and enjoy your pregnancy as long as you can! You look absolutely stunning!
Fleur, I love your baby updates, keep them coming.
You're looking amazing! Love watching your updates 💕 I had my belly pierced prior to having my son and took it out when it got uncomfortable. I didn't use any of the flexible retainers and had no issue putting it back in afterwards (I personally decided I no longer wanted to wear it but could still easily put one  to this day and my sons 9).
My niece is nine months now and I can tell you with them living with us you are in for the best time. We have two dogs that absolutely adore her an become her protectors when she sleeps and her playmates when awake. Congratulations on everything and you look beautiful!!
I know that Missy Lanning of DailyBumps has a pierced belly button, she definitely took the piercing out but I'm not sure if she put it back in.
You look so gorgeous! All the cute baby stuff is adorable!
Your looking amazing! Definitely have that pregnancy glow x
If that beautiful rocker has a matching ottoman... you MUST get it. It will make you so comfy during those long sleepless nights of nursing and comforting. Promise!!
What a lovely video! Where did you get the rugs from?
Talk to her, sing to her, play her music and read to her!! All as much as possible. Mike too! She will know your voices the moment she arrives. xxx
As usual, you look glowing! Such a yummy mummy 😍 the puppies are gonna love their little sister
You look stunning. My daughter has just entered 16 weeks. I'm so happy for you both. Red looks great on you.  You're such a sweetie. My daughter is a very high risk pregnancy.  She's miscarriage twice. So I'm really praying for her and baby. She's had lots of mornibg sickness.  She's having a boy. He's lazy too. When I was pregnant  with my daughter I used to talk with her all the time. I used to read with her too I had her listen to music. lol
bonds are THE baby go to stuff here in Australia! the wondersuits are what you will have baby in most for first 3 months. Its just easier and dressing 0-3 mnth old babies can be a bit extraneous. you'll see!
You are the cutest mom to be.  So happy for you and Mike.  Love the nursery.
There's belly button retainers made especially for pregnancy!!! They're long clear ones! Just search for pregnancy belly rings, wear it until it's not comfortable anymore, it might close otherwise :) btw your skin is glowing!
That pink jumper is so stunning on you! Never fear on showing off your bump; if you want to, do it, if it makes you uncomfortable, you don't have to! I'm sure most of us here would rather you feel comfortable and confident than you do something you don't want to just for the views. Not surprised Squige loves that carpet tho. I could have a roll around on it too!

You look great! You put up whatever content you want. I don't understand why people get upset about you vlogging about your pregnancy. People should just pretend like they are watching TV, if you don't like what your watching, just change the channel!! Thx & see ya!!! : )
You look beautiful! Love, love your bump videos 😄\n\nI did have my piercing whilst pregnant and HIGHLY recommend taking it out. The area around the belly button scars so easily, and some women even get a herniated belly button. I have a pretty massive scar from when it tore during pushing. Contractions and particularly pushing cause the belly and skin to be very tight. Also if you need a c-section or fetal monitoring, they will need it out in a hurry. Best to take it out now, and let it heal properly.\n\nHope that helps! So excited for you!
My baby is 6 months old and your pregnancy vlogs are so refreshing to see now that I am 'on the other side'. You look amazing and glad to hear you are loving the 2nd trimester energy :) xoxo
I think the dogs sense you're pregnant, they look very protective of you - so cute
Love the video. The baby clothes are simply gorgeous and your baby bump is delicious. Please don't worry about how it or the rest of your body looks....it looks beautiful you are glowing...and that is all anybody sees...so enjoy it xxx
Watch supermaryface's pregnancy vlogs she wears a belly ring and got a flexi bar so maybe some of your questions will be answered there
I'm well past having babies but am loving the videos and feeling like I'm sharing this with you.  My girls are 28 and 23. You're beautiful and you should enjoy this time as it goes by so quickly. I'm going to second a previous comment on not getting too many things in newborn size as they grow out of it so quickly. Also be careful about buying things for specific seasons because you'll find by the time the season comes around the baby has outgrown the outfit.
Q. I'm pregnant and don't want to take out my belly ring. Are there pregnancy belly rings available?\nA. Absolutely! As detailed more completely in our Pregnant & Pierced article, your growing baby bump doesn't have to mean the end of your belly button piercing. If you want to keep your piercing, you have a couple options. One option is to purchase several steel or titanium bent barbell shafts in different lengths and swap in progressively longer barbells as your belly grows. That way you can turn your favorite belly rings into pregnancy belly rings rather than buying special pregnancy belly rings. (See our How to Modify Your Belly Ring article with video tutorials and written instructions detailing how to change your barbell shaft.)\n\nAnother option is to purchase a pregnancy belly ring made from flexible PTFE/BioPlast that you can cut to the perfect length based on the current size of your baby bump. (Tip: Leave it long initially so you don't have to buy additional lengths of PTFE later, when your belly's at it's biggest.) PTFE Flexible Pregnancy Belly RingsThe great thing about pregnancy belly rings is that you can keep using them even after your tummy goes back to its normal size post-baby. Just cut the PTFE shaft down a bit more and keep wearing it!\n\nhttps://info.painfulpleasures.com/help-center/piercing-information/belly-button-piercing-faqs
I actually said omg you look beautiful Fleur out loud when you showed your baby bump 😍 Everyone in my office just looked at me like I was weird for talking to my phone screen 😔😂 lol
Everything WILL be fine Fleur. Much love to you and Mike and the puppies. xxx
Take it out. Depends on what your skin is like afterwards....I had mine pierced 8 years. Fore getting pregnant and it was only in a year but now after a baby it looks silly. But again you could be lucky and it could just snap back. You look lovely btw and very jealous of your honeymoon period. I was feeling sick till six months and then I had pelvic girdle pain from 12 weeks that got gradually worse. It was miserable lol. Make the most of it time with you and mike!! Xxxxxx
Love the bump updates!! I'm 22 and definitely don't want kids any time soon, but these videos are so gorgeous they make me feel like I want a baby 😂 lots of love 😘
The clothes you've picked out are too cute!!
ive seen belly button rings that are like a flexible plastic material that you can use during pregnancy
Hi Fleur , first off all you look radiant ❤️ my son is 11 weeks old and around 20 weeks I ended up just taking my belly ring out because it started to bother me (I barely had a bump till around 22 weeks). Further along in my pregnancy I did get like a little X shaped stretch mark where my piercing was and it stayed like that. I think it's inevitable to get the little stretched out belly button skin thing that every girl gets after having a baby and having a belly piercing. I just left it out though.
You look beautiful and so happy Fleur! The nursery and the little baby clothes are so cute! and watching these updates has been lovely :) wishing you all the best Fleur, lots of love <3
Lovely colours in the nursery
you can get a special pregnancy piercing for your belly button :)
With the piercing if in doubt talk to a body piercer they are generally the best people to get advice from. I know some people use bioflex(plastic) bars that are slightly longer than standard bars which bend with the bump and don't cause issues if the hole stretches. It's worth looking into and I think they are reasonably cheap from proper body piercing companies. One based local to me that delivers is www.urbanpiercingshop.co.uk and I know they do pregnancy bars. Hope it helps!
I took my piercing (a hoop) out at about 23 weeks when I was mahoosive and it never went back in, I ended up having such a massive bump and stretched skin that I never did put it back! Glad you are so well with your pregnancy!
I love the throw!
You are gorgeous!!!!!
You look soo beautiful :))
How nice that you don't have to worry about buying a single baby item, you just gladly accept free stuff from every single company. So ridiculous. You can VERY easily pay for these things yourself
😷
What a beautiful video, I feel so excited for you and Mike!! You look so radiant Fleur, can't wait for the next update!!!! xxxxx
Your smile is so refreshing. Thanks for sharing your bump. It's beautiful.
I can completely relate with the, feeling sick but not actually being sick, morning sickness in the first trimester. I would hit 5pm, get in from work, and would crawl into bed and just try to sleep it off. The second trimester was like dream and so was my third. \n\nLove the cybex carrier, I've never seen it but I do have the cybex cloud q car seat for my little boy who is 4 months now and me and my husband absolutely love it. It reclines back when used on a pram which has brilliant benefits for baby. The other item o would definitely recommend which I think you've already shown from a vlog in the sleepy head. It's brilliant for taking to parents houses if you are going for the day and want baby to sleep while you are there. \n\nGood luck with the rest of your pregnancy and just enjoy it. I know it's easier send then done but try and put the weight gain to the back of your mind you look great and you're growing a little person, that's bloody hard work. \n\nTake care and I look forward to watching further blogs, hauls and updates. Xx
Fleur...\nI know you won't read this. But I've watched your videos for a long long long loooong time. Since your very early days on YouTube! I very rarely comment but I always like and watch. I just want to say, I am so happy for you. Its so strange as I know that you don't know me. But after all these years of watching all your videos and all your vlogs and following you through good and bad times I just feel almost proud of you and Mike whilst watching you grow in life together :) congratulations again, Fleur and Mike. I've loved watching your journey xxx
I love the colorway you got going on for the nursery, with the blue mustard and pink tones! Absolutely love it! :)
Fleur, we are almost the same term right now! It's always so exciting to watch the videos!!! ❤
I've only been watching you for a little while, but I really enjoy your content and these baby videos are so handy for me, being 18 weeks pregnant myself! So I thank you hugely! 😄 \nP.S. your babys nursery is the cutest! ✨
Fleur have you wondering how the dogs will act around the newborn? My friend was in touch with a dog couch during her pregnancy in case of dogs will be jealouse etc....
hi fleur. in regards to the belly piercing, I've had 3 children and the hole is still open. my advice would be once it gets too uncomfortable take it out and once baby is born just pop it right back in. it shouldn't be a problem with closing up. I've had mine out for 4 years since I had my first and the hole is still open. I do have stretch mark scars on my belly button but that wasn't from the piercing it was just from normal stretching. hope that helps!
I'm struggling so much with body issues. I'm 22 weeks and I feel so huge and uncomfortable. If I eat anything remotely unhealthy I feel like making myself sick. I've had issues in the past and only usually struggle when I'm going through a testy patch in life. I'm managing to keep myself from making myself sick but I feel like the bigger I get the worse I'll be. I'm scared I'll end up starving my baby if I get to that again. Is there anyone who's experienced this before and knows any ways of coping?
All looks amazing and beautiful. Congratulations to you both 🎀
I love the color of your sweater it's amazing
My mum never took out her belly button piercing while pregnant, but my aunt did. I think you should just see how you feel and leave it in as long as you can! ☺️
Hi Fleur, I am pregnancy Pilates teacher, and of course a follower :) you might want to consider working with a qualified antenatal Pilates teacher to help you strengthen your core and help with your posture, which will  definitely help with your pelvic pain and back pain. I am based in SE London, I am sure I am not in your area, but will be happy to advise when needed!  My website is www.re-Pilates.co.uk. All the best with the rest of your pregnancy! Gina xxx
My sister has a lilac velvet 3 piece in her front room that has been ruined by baby vom and breast milk and drool! Be very careful with hat velvet chair! It's so hard to clean!
In my experience, I really needed to take the belly bar out in the last few weeks because skin so stretched. Went back in fine after first baby but healed up after second 😞. Looking lovely Fleur xx
Hi 👋🏼 Fleur, I took my belly bar out and never put it back in because my husband said I was too old for a belly piercing 😂 (I'm 30) I know how rude!!  Xx
I took mine out with both pregnancies and it went back in fine.
You can get belly button piercings for pregnancy, I struggled with mine on my first pregnancy as it wouldn't go back in after 👍🏻
You have such a lovely bump really excited for you and I have just got married and look forward to this chapter in the future. xx
What a fab video! My baby is now nearly 14 years old so to watch these type of videos is so lovely! You also look fab xxx
Fleur your hair looks incredible and i know it's probably pregnancy hormones but what are you washing it with? Gorg!!xx
I didn't take my belly piercing out until the thirst trimester when it got uncomfortable. I never put it back in because my belly went back the same. I don't really show my belly anymore so I don't miss the piercing.
I'm LOVING watching you through this journey! I'm 10 weeks now, and seeing what's coming up is wonderful. Ahh--So excited for you! ❤️❤️❤️
Take your belly bar out, I didn't when I was pregnant with my first and I couldn't ever use it again. It stretches the skin which will never go back :/
The nursery is beautiful! Can't wait to see the full tour! You look gorgeous, best wishes for the baby ♥️
You look amazing Fleur! Glad to hear you and baby are doing just fine :)
You look great.  Congrats to you and Mike.  I am so excited for you, being a mother is one of the most wonderful things in the world.  I know it's the best thing I ever did, and the most important job I will ever have.  <3
You are so cute I can't stand it! I wish I looked that cute when I was pregnant with my little one.
You are waaay too concerned about how you look!   For Gawd sakes your pregnant.......talk about body image issues!\nAlso you can afford to spend BIG bucks on the baby clothes when your getting sent everything so you can shill it to us on your videos!
Why not put a thread though it? Like, 'back in the day' after getting your ears pierced? ...I might be dating myself. I don't know if they do that anymore or if even they stopped for health reasons, but that might be worth looking into? 🤷🏻‍♀️
I noticed your voice going softer when you speak about her :) can't wait to meet her!
Great video. So nice to see how you are getting on with your pregnancy. Love watching these. So happy for you and mike x
Dear Fleur, You filled this video with SO much love and happiness. Thank you for sharing. I loved seeing the baby clothes. I especially loved the tops from Bonpoint. <3
Fleur you are just radiating happiness and joy. You look beautiful and you are going to be such a wonderful mom! Thank you for letting us see your journey. Have you and Mike been thinking about names? I'm dying to know what Baby de Force will be called. Can't wait for the next update 😄
So happy for you, Fleur!
Fleur I suffered from pelvic pain with two pregnancies. I started taking magnesium when it happened with my second and it cured it! Try that :)
It is so nice to see you so happy❤️you look amazing,and baby scan pictures are so cute!Loved this video!!
You can get maternity belly bars for your piercing! They're a longer, pliable material so it can stretch, I know a friend who had one and it meant she could keep her piercing during and after pregnancy!
Well I'm guessing there killing vampires as the last of a dying breed
* A SPAGHETTI CAT PRODUCTION *\n* I'M PRETTY SURE THIS ISN'T HOW THE STORY ENDS *\n\nwow these credits are rad
The lyrics are in the description.\n\n\nYou have no excuse to not know all the words.
This song is good af but I think it's only made because young and menace and champion tanked. Almost like selling out wasn't smart
And I thought save rock and roll was always gonna be my favorite fob album....😂
K back to good music I was on autoplay and it went to Jacob Sartorius I came to calm down\n*_Oh burning mother of llamas_* THANKS\n I think
This is perfection FOB All the way
A spaghetti cat production\nIm pretty sure this isn't how the story ends
I got a Fall Out Boy vevo ad before this...
I'm obsessed with this song .
Better than YAM and Champion. This is a little bit of the real FOB
I think this might be the best FOB song since save rock and roll😊
i absolutely love this song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS SONG HAS AN AMAZING BEAT\nSO I'M LISTENING TO IT ON REPEAT
love the track, always will be listening too : )
The last of a dying breed, is this about the emo subculture dying out? There's only like twelve big-name emos left?
So Young and Menace and The Last of The Real Ones  are basically just same story, does anyone Agree?
Young and Menace and Champion are dope, but lyrically, this might be the best so far
I stabbed him 37 times! CAAARRRL!!! That kills people!
Omg the credits😂😂\nPete Wentz as pete wentz\nLlamas as llamas \nFor some odd reason I fond it funny 😂
If there's purple confetti in every concert I wanna snort it just as some people did to tour de Columbus red confetti
I don't understand why llamas, but they look cool xd
OKAY THIS IS BETTER THAN Y&M AND CHAMPION I'M ADDICTED
i wonder if your therapist knows everything about me is my sexuality
The llama suits made me so uncomfortable
fall out boy one of the few bands i still fuck with since early 2000s
The video...Flashing lights - Kanye West
I'm in love with this song. I play it at least twice a day
OMFG!!! I AM SO HAPPY NOW!!!!!! HELL YES!!!
This is what I expected from FOB! This is what FOB should sounds like! 👏👏👍
Why didn't anyone notice it's ripoff of Kanyes video Flashing lights?
yo i got a soul voice
Straight up the Kanye West 'Flashing Lights' video with llamas instead of a chick, nice reference lol :)
ohhh hohoo!!! fall out boy is f*cking great!!! love you guys!!!
This is absolutely amazing. Great job!
Are they just fucking with us now? Just 3 minutes of creepy-ass Llamas walking slow. Oh wait here, have 30 seconds of slow mo implied graphic murder at the end! Thanks for watching! But not really, cuz you people will watch LITERALLY anything!!
got to be honest and say i judged them too fast after i heard young and menace. this song is  fucking dope. can't wait for mania.
It's an amazing song!! 🤘🤘🤘🤘 Fall out boy you Rocks!!! 🤘🤘
THIS IS SO AMAZING\n\nHOLY LLAMAS
God damn I'm late again but those credits though like ok I got you there
I liked before listening to this bc i knew i should love it and also i love the credits
i swear, all of these songs are freaking conected. M A N I A i'm waiting for you
*No Llamas were burned in this VIDEO*
It's weird because i don't remember taking acid before i watched this
What the hell is up with the llamas?!
I think this is a perfect example to don't judge albums too soon. When young and menace came put I was shocked bc I don't like it Idk it's just not the type of music I enjoy. But then champion came out and I loved it and now this song. It's my favorite so far. Looking forward to hear every song on M A N I A
I just realized this was uploaded on my birthday😱😱BEST. BIRTHDAY. GIFT. EVER.💜
Did I just witness a lama straight up murder someone with a shovel? 😂
shit i love it
This is sounding amazing.....never lost faith in FOB and never will
Not bad not bad so much better than young and menace

Where's the old fob? This is pop music not rock:(
This song is my new jam!😎
I'M SO PSYCHED FOR THE NEW ALBUM / ERA
-this shit real a now what it means-
Love this song, but I think it's a parody of Kanye wests flashing lights from the beginning warning sign, the car, the lighter and then end with the shovel. Love you FOB
This song needs to chart.
what's up with these furries
Cool llamas don't look at explosions.
I clicked on this and the song is the shit but  now I have to wait I am so mad
You are the sun and I am just the planets\nSpinning around you\n\nAND I'LL SPIN FOR YOU LIKE YOUR FAVORITE RECORDS USED TOO
This music video reminds me of the music video for Kanye West's Flashing Lights
Omg
❤
flashing lights vibes
my favorite so far ^^
These Llamas still creep me out omg

I gotta say, the song is cool, but it reminds me more a pop style, like Maroon V or one of those bands, it doesn't remind me fall out boy :'v. Just an opinion guys don't kill me
I like the song but I don't understand the music video???
I GOT AN AD FOR FALL OUT BOY ON THIS VIDEO. the only ad I actually ever paid attention to
I GOT A FALL OUT BOY AD FOR FALL OUT BOY
Thus makes me real sad because based off of the lyrics of the previous mania songs released (along with other factors) it kindnof alludes to them breaking up

SOOO OVERRATED!!!!! How can you be so hyped about a samsung wannabe with a mimic talking tom cat emoji app that was cool 5 years ago? They could have added that to any old phone it doesnt take a new device for this silly shit. I dont get it litterly anything apple does people are like sheep and are sold before it even comes out.

All these tech reviewers know all these technologies already from other phones yet they act so surprised. We the normal people are not impressed. Talk about the display, fast charging, faceID, and so on ....... the overpriced phone with tech that's not new.
That place is awesome! Thank you for doing all that for us Justine. You are the best!
The feelings are just incredible trough the camera so I can`t even imagine being there and goooood I love Ellen and for some reason just on the moment that the boy said what he does it reminded me her because she usually does this type of things with kids that are a little genius. LOVE U!! Kisses from Argentina!!

If she thinks the iphones are cool, I've got something that will blow her mind!  Six inches of pure heaven.
Apple is built in child labor camps in commie society

Fascinating!!!!!! Though Iphone aged 10 years, but you didn't, you look the same , I wish I could be your friend  ;)
I'm sorry you had to take out a mortgage to probably just look at that overrated piece of trash
Apple fans are even dumber than religious people. Apple has screwed over their fans by doing thing like removing the headphone jack. Now they over charge for a garbage device which stole most of its ideas and design from Samsung. Andriod gives more choice and freedom it also costs less.

I rarely comment on these social media 'super stars' (blabber mouths)\nListening and watching this idiot makes me want to either hurt myself or shit on her.\nHowever, watching her also makes me understand why some guys go gay.
The FaceID's failure is official now. Craig Federighi admitted in the interview. I will wait until the technology matures. Until then, TouchID all the way!!!
Still missing on the iphone\nHeadphone jack\nfront facing stereo speakers\nusb-c\nand a great DAC
It's funny that they don't have windows in there \n\n\n\nGot it??? Windows?

So where's the X phone? Had to watch to the end and no phone?
0:56 . Ah, the years of innocence
Ask Siri what half and half is. ;)
I wonder if she got dicked by any of the other youtubers after the event
Same phone, higher price. Feels good not being young and stupid.
@7:50 'looks like X but it's a 10. That's brilliant' \n\nAnd there you have every fanboy tosser in one sentence. Wow Apple invented Roman numerals now.
For me, S8 plus, Note 8 and V30 is looks premium and better features than the iphone X and iphone 8 plus

For everyone asking what happened to iPhone 9, it's obvious that 7 eight 9...

Am I the only one who noticed the death stare from that girl at 3:44 LOL
Watching this on my OP5 :p
Hello, i'm new subscribers :)
I'm getting iPhone 8+ I don't like the iPhone x
I have enough money to buy the IPhone X 245 GB omg!!!!
Samsung phone costs $960 and they started the price war. iPhone X is a higher-end phone not meant for everyone. It may be ideal for professionals such as YouTubers, bloggers, etc. similar to iPad Pro. I don't need iPhone X (happy with 6s) but would definitely buy the iPad Pro 10.5. If someone doesn't like the price, go for iPhone 8 or 8+. Simple.
going not gong
Play rocksmith again
Are the fronts of both iPhone X's black? Only the backs are different?
Great video, really enjoyed it 👍🏻👍🏻\nI want that Apple park t-shirt, looked really cool 🤓
Back when 8 gigs was so much in a phone , it seems crazy wasn't it? , now 32 gigs ain't much
Looking so hot baby 👶
I got tired of being confused so i left before the end.  too many confusions with not enough explanations.  I feel like I've lost both my money and my time.  Fairly great acting, but to me both the writer(s) and director of this movie must've been high before and after making this movie decision.
This movie was next level bonkers.  It genuinely made me angry at times but it really did challenge me which isn't something I have experienced in a while.  \n\nThis was a film my friends and I immediately went to a diner afterwards to sit and discuss about for at least an hour.  What it meant, the pros and cons because it's most definitely a polarizing film.  Some of my friends really were into it while others hated it.  Me, I love the film because it was the first time since I don't remember where we all felt the to talk about it right after watching it.  It's been so long since I've watched something like that!
Just left the movie theater. Waste of time and money. Sick. No subject. Worse moviei have ever seen. My husbnd got a headache.
I don't even know what the movie is about
Man that Nightcrawler tid bit really got me... Jake needs an Oscar now that Leo has one. Jake should have been nominated for Nightcrawler AND Nocturnal Animals. But he will probably win for something like Stronger which I think does not showcase his talent.
Went and saw it because literally nothing else had tickets. WASTE OF MONEY.  Terrible acting terrible primace and Literal baby eating.  They actually ate a baby
I honestly think Nightcrawler is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Oh well...
Arguably one off the greatest movies ever made.
Michelle Pfeiffer is still fine as hell
I knew it looked like Trash
Love the review. Fuck! The trailer had me going. Don't know whether to see this movie or not.
The movie was so bad, don't waste your money. It was good acting but man the movie dragged
Just saw it today. I was waiting for the reveal almost the entire time; I kept saying to myself Come ! Come on! - although I wanted to shout it out. It never came. A total piece of shit/waste of time and money. Nothing supernatural or evil; really just like a drug-induced nightmare (which I think was the intent). Look elsewhere. Waste of talent.
Kind of a Spoiler!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hate that I know the movie is a metaphor for mother earth. People are throwing that around in the comment section  like it's nothing. I now will never know if I could have found that out myself or not... god
One of the few reviews of this movie I find myself agreeing with _(and this coming from someone who despised your Dunkirk review)._ 👍 Thank you for not shitting all over it. Now off to your Spoiler Talk.
Watching Requiem for a dream ended in frustration. So I guess this movie is definitely not for me. Thanks for saving my time..
My family has a saying for movies like this: delightful and disturbing. This one was no delightful; just disturbing.
That movie poster is a straight homage or rip-off of Neon Genesis Evangelion's.
It was horrible. Think the part in Requim for a Dream where the tv breaks open and there is loud music, lights everywhere, what the hell is going on type for an hour. No film critic wants to give it bad reviews because they are hoping they missed the point.
I cannot stand horror but feel like I'm missing out on so many great films because of it (eg IT). Glad to hear that this isn't entirely horror/haunted house and theres more depth. It's releasing on October 13th here in India..because Friday the 13th -_- Can't wait though!
I sh*t you not.  It leads up to a new born (representing Jesus) getting it's neck broke and it being carved up and eaten by a mob.  Think about it.  BABY EATING!  Come on.  When does this sh*t finially piss you off?
Forget Jennifer Lawrence. Overrated actress!\nWould give my two cents to sit through her crap movies!
Aronofsky is hands down my favorite director and this my well be his best film yet. I avoided trailers and went to this on my love for his films alone, with high expectations and was still blown away. The movie did get brutal, but honestly I think it was on target. I don't think he went to far. This film is brilliant
So I guess the only question to ask  is with knowing everything works in cycles and God will create again should we just say fuck it and not work on coming together and suffer the backlash of our lack of givin a shit. What will our story be? Apocalypse? Or Star Trek!
mother? you should have used mine for that movie. if you can find her. I can't.
Wasn't my cup of tea really, from a completely personal perspective was really slow paced first 2/3 and then last 1/3 was warp speed. Like they had to squash the end into a limited time frame. The protagonist acting was really good though.
Your review was more painful than  the movie.
I like this game's presentation MUCH better. Something that's actually interesting appears to be happening.
This Movie is just a WTF Movie!
i haven't seen him for 3 years
IT SUCKED AND YOUR REVIEW IS JUST A PROMOTION AD
I hope there's a fucking dimension where Jeremy says ebb and flow.  Shit threw me off.
if someone wants to join BITCONNECT  im offering 50/50 share from a  referral bonus (for example u do X amount of loan $ and referral bonus is 10$ from that loan we share it 5/5$ i will send u those 5$ back in BCC \nif u are interested write here or contact me on FV Zokito Ogata same Avatar like here (cant put links)
Anti-Christian Propaganda Piece. Will bomb at the box office..
And the father is reviewing it.
I think it's the most amazing movie I saw this year (with Get Out! and The Lost City of Z) and you reviewed it very well without spoiling it, congrats.\n\nYes the ending is brutal but it's definitely worth a watch, even if you later wish you could get a few images out of your head. A masterpiece from a unique and fascinating director.
Up next\nAUTOPLAY\n\n9:17\nMother! - Movie Review\nChris Stuckmann\nGot what i wanted. No need to get stuckminized.
I'm definitely not seeing a movie that got an F rating
This movie was marketed as a Rosemary's Baby do over.
I have JLaw fatigue because she runs her fat mouth and helped break up chris Pratt and Ana Faris oh and she attacks fans in foreign countries and brags about it.
I wonder if this movie has anything to do with Jewish/Gnostic myths. Been reading a bunch of Gnostic literature lately. That combined with Chris Stuckmann's blurb at the end of his review (and your Know yourself line) has me leaning in the direction of this movie being some kind of allegory.
Did no one else think it was Jeffery Dean Morgan that was in this?
mother! had me thinking about it for days. And requiem for a dream is the most frightening movie I've ever seen. (especially since I watched it days after having a bad acid trip) big props to Darren Aronofsky
Anyone else feel like Jeremy Jahns has gotten better with his reviews?  I know he's always meant to be like a casual movie goer talking about a film. But lately he's also felt more professional.
Worst film I have ever seen. Avoid if you can.
lmao I was so disappointed with the trailer. I thought it would be boring. Instead I was treated to the same intensity of Requiem for a Dream where love and life are the true drugs. Total mind-fuck.
THE MOVIE WAS FUCKING CRAZY  but I loved it so much it was just great
Denny how could you do this to izzy only  greys anatomy fans will understand
Just read the plot on wikipedia and now I wish I hadn't because it sounds really good but also blasphemous in a way even though the entire thing is a metaphor.
Ugh another pretentious pile of shit that's pretending to be something more than it is........
Watching the trailer had me thinking it was a remake of rosemary's baby
Metaphors don't substitute for good storytelling, unfortunately.
Are you gonna see Logan Lucky?
With reviews like this Jeremy really exposes himself as knowing very little about film, not as in you sit and watch it as an audience member, any idiot can do that, but a good critic has to be able to see a film as more than a piece of entertainment and coherently express their opinion. The moment when he said Darren Aronofsky in that cheesy way sums up exactly what he got from the film. Nothing. From this review I gather he had no thoughts beyond this is weird and therefore not for everyone which I can agree with to an extent, but to be a critic you need more substance.
To sum up the whole video, he basically said Jennifer Lawrence is really stupid and fat. Your welcome
It was awesome and done right
except the movie isnt secretive at all. i saw the movie with my 60 year old, doesnt know shit about movies mom, and before we even walked out of the theater she said was he god or something. understand that my mom doesnt know shit about movies or film analysis. and she got it. not to mention the director himself went up onstage and explained the movie at its TIFF premier so so much for the secret. This movies problem is its metaphors are like massive boxer fists punching you in the nose. think about the shining for example it had a surface level story allowing you to dig into the deeper meanings. this movie has no surface level story so it therefore cant be deep even if its meaning would otherwise be deep if told through a regular surface level story. spoilers the movie is the book of genesis from the bible.
Some people are creating a narrative about J Lawrence because pf her political stances against Trump and white supremacist after Charlottesville. That is why you see many people online now going after her. She is no more or less shoe in now in movies than the Rock, Emma stone, Ryan Gosling, or Gal Gabot now who appears in every other movie.
It was interesting but nit something I want to see more than once.
I felt like this movie sucked the soul right out of me..
jennifer lawrence getting beat up was too much lol
Rosemary's baby remake is what I gout out of the preview
Sorry Jeremy, I saw this last night and it was the worst film I have seen this year.  And I liked Black Swan a lot.  1/10.
0:37-0:39 I need a 10 hour version of this lmao
Wow. This review told me nothing 😩
Awww thought he was going to give it a tour de force raiting. Haven't seen one of those in a while
Wow really thought it was a horror movie that sucks
I said as we walked out of the theater that was allegorical and there  were several examples of foreshadowing the Michelle pfeiffer character's son death foreshadows the death of the baby. Also the religious imagery was consistent with the Mary Joseph and baby Jesus as Lawrence suckled her newborn. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Most people won't bother watching it. There were less than six people in the theater last night. And I think that's how it should be.
Jeremy I cannot find your Arrow Season 4 review.
Yes! I'm going to a matinee Monday for every reason to see this movie that you mentioned and Stuckmann.\nI think Mother is going to wrinkle my brain, and I don't feel like there hasn't been anything in the theatres that's made me curious for awhile.\nI've also been binge watching Hannibal this week so you could say I have an appetite for this kind of movie right now ha ha  ha(sorry, too easy).\nI'm excited for something different that doesn't fit neatly in a little box!
I agree that I am over her. I am over her just playing herself and clearly being checked out. ooooor just playing her self to a hyperbolic effect with a lot of screaming. which is why I have not seen this...yet I might see it now.
1:43 ooh yes, she sucks and gets stuff big and stuff all over her face
movie isn't telling shit! by this logic you can take any occupation/situation and pretend it means something specific even though no one could ever guess the meaning.
JJ, normally I watch your review and get a strong understanding of the movie and is it worth my time attending. Honestly in my three years of watching your channel I only disagreed with you one time (looper it sucked). But I had to watch your spoiler review of mother just to get the gist of the movie. I am excited to go and see it.
Yo mama so fat that when people run around her it's like running a marathon!!!
It's Muslim propaganda
It's jennifer's social media that has worn people out on her / also her **** aren't A list.
PASS I'm going to see the movie It
I'm confused as fuck but I'm intrigued
What the fuck are you talking about
Yo Jeremy could my vibe be changed when I go see this? Cause you said it wasn't anything like it was advertised so if I still view it like it was advertised would you say that like even though it's not what I was expecting it to be I would still really dig it?
dude, you're trending number 27. congrats.
Hmm mm jenny tit

This movie sucked ass
I wanna see
Great review.
NIghtcrawler :'( amazing film and performance
so its an aligory
This video was stoopid.
It was excellent.
Mother!fucker
So is it like Donnie Darko or something?
Jake Gyllenhaal totally deserved an Oscar nod for Nightcrawler. I think he's pretty underrated and doesn't get enough credit. The dude has talent. I think he could do a great Joker.
Jennifer Lawerence is the BEST ACTRESS in the history of the movie industry.
Is this movie is like Animal Farm story of George Orwell?
You're in trending!
HELLO FRIENDS!! i dove back into the sea of ~wish~ once more to see what all this free stuff was about... are there any other strange websites you would like me to try?
Www.ioffer.com \n\nDo a make up video. Order replicas and  compare to the original. See how they wear
I just got an ad about Wish...
See, I bought those pants you hate and I got a really good quality pair that are made of very sturdy fabric. I think it's a random draw with the quality sometimes on wish.
DO ONE  WHEN YOU BUY ALL VERIFIED ITEMS ( LIKE THIS)‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
You are one of my favorite creators. Smart, pretty, humorous in a way that isn't insulting, therefore very entertaining. Plus, you have a really cute boyfriend. That always helps.\nI would like to see you tryout AliExpress and compare it to Wish. It seems to be more popular than wish and its cohorts(cute, home, geek-have you tried any of those? They are very interesting too. I'd especially like to see how their home decor items measure up)\nBtw. My cat looks exactly like an elderly, chubby version of yours. But mine fits Phobe's version Smelly Cat. You maybe to young for the reference, except for Google, which levels most playing fields. I honestly don't know how I got by without it. Instead I had a wall full of out-of-date encyclopedias and dictionaries.(I looked a little silly trying to carry those to parties, but at I was a conversation starter, at least with the kids from the chess club🤓)\nBlessings❣💋
They start giving you free things when you stop buying things and many times the price it is originally will be the shipping price
I'm the phone case was probably verified because people were getting burnt from glitter cases!
You used the song!! Hahaha
I wish you'd stfu up
I guess you can say its free dollars
I keep on seeing the website SHEIN pop up everywhere.
You should do a Pinterest one!!
You should try buying a full face of make up on Wish
I do not associate with Nygaards
I love that you used the fiver intro song! 😂
 here I am ..and here's my shoulder  tbh the way she said that made me laugh so hard 😂
You should do buying really cheap wedding dresses online and trying them on that would be so entertaining
@Safiya Nygaard, I literally almost pissed myself! I just can't control my laughter lol\n4:00 minutes in:  ...I guess they hook you with the free, but it's actually free ninety nine ,,,  LOL
Can you pleas do a having a gay bestie for a week and choose me plz k thanks bai
*_MY SON REALLY LIKES IT_*
I told my mom not to get anything from wish but nope. She didn't buy much though, just a big scarf thing idk.nothing too bad
I have all of those waches on the list and they are so good
Do more wish videosss! I love them <3
Hahah sofee shorts. I use to love those babies. I dont think kids wearing them anymore lolz..
THIS INTRO IS THE BEST
I would but a free case... uh ya it's free😂
Youre a mirror image of my ex. The funny thing is, you're the second person I've seen that looks like her. You have 2 dopplegangers. The more you know, huh?
I had a wish ad before this video😂😂😂
Taobao/aliexpress titles. used to them
I literally had a Wish ad before this, what a coincidence
Can you try ordering something from DHgate
wow new intro i saw the vid and it is cool
Why are all the great YouTube ideas performed by such cringy people?
you should order suggest items from Amazon next :D
She's so close to 3 million subscribers
Ohh you thought this was free?? No honey.. never judge a book by its cover
There's free stuff in wish ?
you have a great voice.
The way she dances as she reads the long names
I love your videos! But I'll say my experience w Wish was: I ordered a larger size as recommended. Got it, way too small. Tried to return or exchange? No, they were to return my money. Never received.  So I'm just not sure I'll ever order from them again but it is worth a shot!
The little black bralet is cute.
For your next wish video you should do a full face using only wish makeup 😂that would be so interesting! Love you and your ideas 😘😂😀😊
When Safiya brought up Sophie shorts I looked at my closet and realized Wow I'm a living breathing dead trend
I feel sad watching this like the items on the WISH website are being made by kids in a sweatshop. All the pictures on their site are probably from other clothing sites and individuals Instagram photos - which are poorly photo-shopped to show other colours. :( :( :( :(
lol your expression on 14:42 was hilarious😂👌
i saw a wish ad right before this video lmao
Safiya!\nYou should do a video purchasing only wish verified items! That'd be really interesting!
Could you review the sea sponge tampon?
I just watched this whole video. What is wrong with me?
Omg when I saw the shorts I thought the same about the Michael cera in Juno reference lmao, now you're my favorite YouTuber
the holosexual is showing through
uh i would buy i medium orange
i just dont like you saying the entire long name. thats annoying.
Had to like the video because of that chain hang low reference 😂
PLEASE do a haul from romwe! I need to know if it's reliable.
No one ever buys shoes in these types of videos and I really want to know what cheap wish/amazon/eBay shoes are like
pls do a makeup haul from wish
You may want to be careful with that cover, have read stories about glitter phone cases melting cuz of the phone's heat & messing folks clothes bags & stuff
1:39 the top comment for a bra says my son really liked it
I feel like she should be on buzz feed idek why
Wish is a terrible company they charge you more for shipping than items. Not just free items there is no customer service and they returned my order for my unborn baby for no reason. I hate that company
You should do a full face of makeup from wish
Am I the only one who kinda whats a part 2?
Anything that says free just raised the shipping. If you look more youll see the item for the same cost for the item+shipping.
at 0:45 what lipstick is that
Net time can you do more than 5 like 10 or 7
Why have you never actually gotten colors?
The first few seconds of the video and I'm cracking up laughing 😂 I think that's a first
WANT free things like makeup, electronics, baby stuff and more, download VeryDice it's 100% free no visa card needed I've been using this for about about 3 weeks and got a couple of things already like bts album (kpop) and some makeup use my code 966409 for 50 free rolls! Comment if you have questions💕😊 use mine and I'll use yours
Shopping made fun? Isn't shopping already fun?
I got a wish ad before the video
Five things from Wish?! That must have taken half a year to arrive.
I love how the ad that came before this video was an ad by wish 😂 (at least for me)
i just saw the watch on wish and it was 1 dollar
Try stuff from Mercari next!!! I wanna know if it's legit…

Rest in peace Harry Dean Stanton.
Just heard he passed, this was the first film I ever saw him in and he introduced me to this amazing song, travel well brother x
I remember a couple of years ago rewinding this part over a few times because he sang this so sweet. You could tell he'd lived some life. RIP.
Now you're there buddy, now you're there.
Rest now. You're in the grace of glory forever more. R.I.P Harry Dean Stanton. 1926-2017
Rest in peace and with the lord near
Harry Dean Stanton is the best - under appreciated actor of all time! Hands down, unless you count 'leading' actors.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P., HDS.
Stanton died today. 15 September, 2017.
RIP Harry Dean
do u kiddies even realize how big a legend this movie and HDS is????
Just a closer walk with thee, Mr Stanton,- rest in peace.
RIP...Ah was just watching Partly Fiction last night and remarked- There's the Last of a Certain Breed of Men.......Probably the last Hollywood veteran of WWII.
this is so saf
Harry Dean Stanton passed away today. The last movie I remember him in was The Last Stand with Arnold Schwarzenegger. We have a countless number of films he played in to remember him by. Christine, Repo Man,  Paris Texas, Dillenger, Two Lane Blacktop, Fire Down Below, and the list goes on and on. R.I.P. Mr. Stanton. You will be missed.
If I fall dear lord who cares?
Safe travels Harry.
RIP Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Rip
R.I.P. Harry!
RIP Harry.
He performs it, just like the old blues legends, very great !
I was watching youtube videos the other night, and got caught in the mode where you keep getting suggested videos to watch. I passed on most, but wound up watching this, as Cool Hand Luke is one of my all time favorite movies, and I've always loved Harry Dean Stanton. Kind of surreal to me that the next day after watching this, he had passed on. If you've ever compiled a list of your favorite top 10 or 20 movies, there's a pretty good chance Harry acted in one or more of those movies.
A solid actor. Multitalented. Unforgetable in any scene. Job well done Sir.

That Paul Newman didn't win the Academy Award for best actor in this movie is a joke. Paul Scofield, A Man for All Seasons was great, but Luke is an iconic film character creation.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton. Just saw him in the new Twin Peaks
Watching Cool Hand Luke now and I thought that was him.  RIP Harry.
Rest In Peace Mr Stanton.
:'(   Rest in Peace Harry. You will be sorely missed buddy   :'(
May God grant him eternal peace. We'll miss you, Harry!
Rest in Peace Mr. Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Thank you for this, sir.😥
great actor!!  last time I saw him was in a Two and a Half Men episode.  Cameo w/ Chris Penn and Elvis Costello, sittin' around talkin' in Charlie's living room.    FUNNY!    REPO MAN WAS SOO AWESOME,  I BOUGHT THE LP.  first punk lp.  I ever owned.   REST IN PEACE HARRY.  beautiful life and career.
Rip Mr. Stanton
Rest in peace good sir
Rest in peace, Harry.
Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info
I love this man. RIP\nHarry Dean.  When I\nfeel real down, this tune sung\nand strummed by him always \nsoothes me.
Rest in peace Harry one of my heroes . Thank you
This movie was like Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea. Both protagonists and stories seem like everyday scenes, the everyman trying to resist and overcome far greater and malevolent forces. Then you realise these are spiritual works of art. It isn't by chance that HDS is playing spirituals while they are trying to break Luke's spirit out there by the ditch, or here, saying goodbye to his mother. Quite a sad scene!
Such a great movie
RIP
R.I.P.
Peace HDS..\n.you will be missed..
We will miss him dearly. RIP
RIP Harry Dean
His latest performances on showtime Sundays at 9:00 p.m.,on the return of Twin  Peaks He plays the guitar there once or twice as well
RIP Harry
Rest In Peace

The best version of this song I ever heard is by the chambers bros.i,ve heard hundreds of versions.the bros do a fantastic job.great !!!!!!
Memorable song,  part of such a great movie, as its my personal favorite and quite possibly Newman's finest hour and his personal choice i do believe ? Harry Dean Stanton and his contribution is to his credit, RIP Harry
he croaked today, rip!
Why isn't this song part of the soundtrack? did mr.stanton ever record this song?
It just creeps up on you, powerful.
I wish Harry had recorded a full version of this.
Damn that is so great.
That brother is feeling it.  I can't sing or even listen to this tune without feeling it.
Harry's version is definitely best - wish he'd done the whole thing. Try Judith Durham - seekers for one that comes close.
Man.......this movie. I think Paul Newmans best......ever. And he made so many that were over the top.
pure class, from writing to music to acting, simple yet so deep
The closest to this I can find is by Judith Durham - wish Harry had done a full version but Judith's is excellent.
:(. ..
Comes a time the bitch don't recognize the pups no more...  -Harold Dean Stanton,... Last one standing might be appropriate after witnessing the sendoff they gave Dennis. Tough Motherfuckers to be sure. I met Harry Dean in '89 at the original Hollywood Billiards-(the brick building that fell in during the Northridge quake). I'd met some people already and was on the move in L.A. Some friends that ran the original Zero Club-(Wayzatta Cameroon-Mark Boyd and brother Scotty Boyd-great man/guitarista). We showed up to HB and walking in found Harold Dean holding court in a booth and completely lit, and blathering coherently. I was introduced and realized that this was the wrong time for such 'protocol'. He said-Nice to meet you Dave and that was my first big movie star encounter in Los Angeles. You would have had to have been there. series of true and actual events in the City of Angels. This being one of the least of them. Great singer, and pure American talent-\nHarry Dean Stanton. Not since that dog put his tongue on the butter. -Greatest role ever- Missouri Breaks.
now get ain't no grave...
I cant believe how expensive this collection is,i mean its nice but nothing life changing
Why does it have to be SO EXPENSIVE 😭😭
The prices are rediculous
I'd love for you to do a No7 Makeup tutorial/review! I don't see those very often and I think there are some decent thing within the brand for less bank breaking prices.
Lovely review, have you stopped using your lilash serum? Could you do update review on it x
It sounds weird but I love that greasy eyelid look. Do these transfer during the day?
I'd love to see a Clarins makeup tutorial!
I'd love to see a video using Tarte products! I try to use natural makeup brands when I can, and I think Tarte does that really well.

I can't deny that the packaging is beautiful, but the size of those eye shadows?  that's ridiculous.  They could have been a bit bigger to at least fill the compact.  I'm going to pass.  Although that eye foil looks great.  It looks like you're doing the glossy eye trend without the gloss.
Love Victoria Beckham's clothes, I was looking forward to seeing reviews on the cosmetics. Glad I waited because I am surprisingly not going to buy some of the items I originally had on my list! Love the Modern Mercury (I have the original one STILL), love the setting powder, and love the mascara! Thanks for the great review. Can't wait for the next ones!
Really love this type of video-very informative and helpful. Thanks Nic, brilliant job 😊
Loved the reviewtorial thought the end result was very much a Brooke Shields look. They do look like very luxurious products and you can see the quality in your results. Thanks for sharing
Yes Fenty beauty please!! OMG VB products are expensive!! She may be pricing herself out of the market! Pass
Dolce & Gabanna, please. Those are only available online and I'd like to see them tried out before I go and purchase them. Thank you!
You're so adorable!!! I love your makeup tutorials!!
please do a few looks with Natasha denona Lila palette! if you and your sister each did a look together from one palette, it would be like two looks in one video! genius! esp since you're both so talented and not just for ND but any brand and palette, that would be a cool video to see from you two
I really enjoy your videos....Could you review makeup revolution... thanks
Shit shit shit I really am trying to curb my spending on makeup. This doesn't help.
I recently bought some makeup from W7, I'd love to see you do a review of them! It's insanely affordable. Their Glowcomotion highlighter/eyeshadow is gorgeous. I also got their matte eyeshadow palette and all the shades are very wearable.
I would like to see the normal Estée Lauder range, especially the Double Wear Foundations and their differences!
Lovely video. Super informative and honest opinions. Look forward to more of this style of video. X
There's not a product that you used that doesn't look wonderful & flattering on you! I was wondering though, what color/brand did you use on your hair? I really like it
As much as I like Estée Lauder products I just can't get on board with this it's like taking out a bank loan to buy a bronzer, products look gorgeous on you though nic!
When is the defining crease brush out? Only shade set in the brushes info ☹️
Baby hairs- put hairspray on a toothbrush and comb through! :)
Will you please do an Avon makeup review! Thank you :)
Hello can you feature hourglass & Laura mercier. I love watching your videos ☺️
Stunning as always but the makeup looked a bit doll like for me...maybe it was the skin. I know a lot of people love the perfect look but I love to see your amazing skin a little more natural xx
I'd like to see Jouer!
Tooth brush and spray it with hair spray
I would like to see some older brands which aren't so mainstream but have stood the test of time! Elizabeth Arden, Guerlain, Givenchy! Don't tend so see these products in videos!
Love the make up tutorial. Can you please do a review on Fenty beauty? I would an honest review. Thaaaanks x
besides makeup, you girl have a lovely nail color, i love it, show it often
Can you do a fenty makeup review
Could you do some more affordable brands like collection or maybelline x
Is flower beauty widely available there? It would be nice to see a brand review of that brand. Thanks! Still loved the end look even if you just wanted to try the products. :) great as usual.
Is this only colour of foil in the collection? Gorgeous makeup as always xx
If you can do Dior that would be great!! Thank you! Love love love your videos.
What show was she on. I recognise her just not sure what she was from??? X
You did a great job nic!
Could you try the new too faced kandee collection? \nWould be good to see an actual make up artist use it rather than just youtubers who dont have the same level of knowledge or experience xxx
Gorgeous!  I'd like to see beauty pie or kat von.d x
Nic, I think it would be hilarious to see you and Sam do a full face using homemade products based on jail makeup.  I love the vids where you guys  work together on a silly task like the waterproof mascara challenge you did.  \n\nI'm also dying to see you and Sam do looks from American Horror Story, especially Lady Gage's looks in the Hotel season.\n\nJust some ideas! Love to you all!!
...why do these celebrities think they are so above reasonable pricing?! absurd!!! please don't pay this for products when equally good or better products exist for less!! great review, nic and the look you created is stunning, as always....thanks for your down to earth honesty xoxo
I know it not fashionable but I would love to see a MAC review from their permanent line. You usually only see the LE collections.
I can still hear this creeking/grinding noise in the videos! What is this???
Will the real techniques powder bleu brushes come to ulta?
That lip liner color looks fucking good on you.
62 pounds for translucent powder?! Which you are probably paying for the name instead of the quality, you would probably find the same if not better quality product at a drug store.
Once upon a time Victoria Beckham was putting her name to cheese and onion crisps. Now look at her collabs.. those prices!
Your skin is to die for!
So beautiful
Fenty Beauty pleaseeeeee
Review FentyBeauty, please! Hii from Brazil!
Great review, thank you 😊
Review Fenty Beauty Please
To help with the whispy hairs: use hair gel on a toothbrush (of course a new one you only use for this purpose) and whisk them back. Stays in place all day.
How much is the foundation primer (Victoria Beckham) x
Why do you consider yourself lucky to interview VB?She is launching an exceedingly expensive makeup line. It's not as if she had you for tea.
Can you do a review of Anastasia Beverly Hills products ?
You should sell your brushes individually because there are Real Techniques brushes that I want to buy but don't get because they only come in sets that have brushes I'm not interested in. I'm not going to pay for an entire set when I only want one or two brushes. Just a thought!
Review Chanel Makeup. I havent heard a lot from Chanel makeup products on youtube.
Please do a review on fenty beauty...
your skin is sooooooooooooooooo amazing!!! would you make a video telling us your skin care journey, PLEASEEE
Please could you or Sam do a Fenty Beauty video? :-*
Fab, honest review.  Really interesting.  Please don't do CT - I pass that every day on my walk into work.  I've spent enough there recently!!!
You are so pretty ❤️
✨❣️Awesome Review/Demo..👏🏻.. Love the Look You Created with VB..😍.. Would love to See you Review the Denessa Myricks range, She's created some Amazing products that are so versatile for every Skin Tone/Color!!❣️✨
Beautiful look Nic 😍 But the prices are ridiculous. No thanks 😁
Since your a very well known make up artist and interviewed VB I feel it's hard to be subjective. From other reviews I've seen this products are extremely overpriced. The products aren't bad but $60 dollars for a eye shadow quad where the pans are small and has two colors that don't go together at all. But I get it it's VB.
what i didnt know the pencil/kajal difference, thanks for teaching!
VB can do no wrong. Her collection of make up looks stunning. Maybe ideas for Christmas lists for people?
Can you do the new bare minerals barepro liquid foundation??
Estee Lauder have cut back training so much it's mainly on counter training from a little pack, not great x
The foundation blends perfectly in with your skin tone! It looks gorgeous! <3
Use a toothbrush with hairspray on to help with the wispy hairs it works really well with your parting when your hair is down too 😀
When you said you couldn't find the pencil, I immediately thought check to see if Edie has it! Lol!!  Did you ever find it?
Laura Mercier, please!
Beautiful makeup
Fenty Beauty please?
Makeup revolution?
Please could you review Jane Iredale makeup🤞🏻
Could you please test Fenty Beauty !!!!!
Fenty plz
Wrong celebrity love
Bumble and Bumble Sumo Wax for whispy hair. XOXO!
Hate estee lauder. Bad eyeshadow. Hate the lip stick too.
Great video. Dior, please! :D
Too much
Hourglass!
Gorg! ByTerry review :)
You're iconic!
Adore the eyes!
So spendy!
Please do Fenty Beauty!
Bobbi Brown please do
Nic!  Did you quit using LiLash?  Your eyelashes always look gorgeous, but I noticed they are no longer like they were in your LiLash video.  Just wondering whether it stops working because I've been using it based on your suggestion.
Hi Nic....i Love ur Videos but these reviews would be even better when u could do a weartest and show how the Products lasted on  ur  face after  6-12 hours. Much love from Germany
I feel bad thinking this but I really wonder how you would've felt about these products had you not known they were vb?\nI've watched this channel for years and I respect you both a ton and such is the reason why I don't want to doubt you.
Its cause they use recycled paper to pretend to be environmentally concious. Every fucking hotel does it.
As a Melbournian I sincerely apologise. Clearly we are a little behind in toilet paper sophistication.
Us Australians are normal. You're just being a softcock
If you come back, check out the toilet paper in the supermarkets - they tell you the price per 100 sheets. And buy Quilton. It's good toilet paper.
Dude, I would probably have had a colostomy by now if I had not stopped using toilet paper and started using flushable wet wipes.  Back then, there was only one brand for adults [Charmin', I think].  Now there are many brands, including some he-manly ones called Dude Wipes [which I have not tried...I'm not nearly butch enough] and some relatively inexpensive generic ones that work just fine.  Several manufacturers also make various travel or carry-along versions, some of which even fit neatly in the back pocket of jeans.  [The trouble with the portable ones are that they can be hard to find [Walmart! has been a reliable source], so buy a bunch when you find them. For years, I never left home without them.  Now, I seem to have cured my IBD with a fiber regimen, but that is for a rant of another day.  So, just stop the madness, ditch the TP and get some good soothing wipes.  It is the conservative thing to do - taking responsibility for yourself.  And I am not a paid spokesperson for anything or anyone...though it might be nice if I were.  Oh, and don't fall for the just use one hype, 'cause it's hype.
I just have to say that I totally agree with all of this. Also, why are those bears associated with soft toilet paper I just don't know but they get me every time. How do they do it?
That song was... Weird.
+vlogbrothers Hank what happened to Bellingham, WA? Please don't cancel if that's what's happening. Please...
I love everything about this
As someone who has butt problems... thank you!!! Hate that squeezing every cent of profit at the expense of people is pretty much the only thing that matters to most businesses in our overtly-Capitalistic world. Profit over actual real human necessity is what will doom our species.
You definitely had a booger in your left nostril toward the end of the vid.
You have a bathtub and a shower in your hotel room... use them! I don't get those who just uses toilet paper to clean after pooping. #firstworldproblem
Australian supermarket toilet paper price tags show the 'price per 100 sheets' which is SUPER HELPFUL \nDon't have to do the math myself yay
I'm showing everyone this video 😂😂😂
We can all agree hygienic paper should be regarded as an investment and not as a cost
as a country we suffer from ibs so we dont need to wipe
Is this the guy from that science show i used to watch at school???
Actually the cheapest toilet paper is the best toilet paper in our country.
this video speaks to me
I love this somehow.
Glad you love us in Oz. We love you too. Hotels..  we know the secret.  Baby wipes in the backpack.  Shh....
I was already thinking, This is such a Hank video and then there was that music break...A+.
Okay. It's been a while since I have laughed out loud until I cried, but the countdown starts anew today
Subscribe to us for a subscribe back!💖
try to use water instead of toilte paper
I figure this is what hank is like when he is drunk
We need abrasive toilet paper Down Under to discourage the snakes from coming up the pipes to bite us when we're most vulnerable. If you start flushing the good stuff, they get too comfortable and choose your toilet over someone else's...
A&D ointment for butt problems as mentioned in this video. Or aquaphore, basically heavy petroleum jelly for protection from friction. I guess you kinda said that.
Hank, I loved everything about this video!
we use water after toilet paper .\nits realy helpful
Fun fact, satin is a weave not a fiber content. Satin can also be cotton but it's usually called sateen (I don't know why).
Bidets! I actually installed one in my apartment (I'm in IL) last week that I bought from Tushy and it is AMAZING!
I've always said that toilet paper should be sold not by linear foot, sheets, or square yards, but rather by weight. Because that's how you use it. If it's thin, then you're going to pull more footage off the roll until it feels right. And then you're going to scrape it across your bloody 'rhoids. But that's a different problem.
Once, on a missions trip to Arizona, we had to make I supply run and, knowing our funds were limited, I grabbed the cheapest pack of toilet paper I could find. But before I could place it in our cart one of our team leaders stopped and sagely informed me that there's some things you just don't chince on. Almost twenty years later it remains one of the most important lessons of my life and a rule I always live by. NEVER chince on toilet paper. (Also I hardcore judge any establishment by the cleanliness of their bathroom and the quality of their toilet paper)
Thank you for being so candid about a sensitive topic. My sister in law complained about Aussie TP back in the 1980s, and I found no improvement in 2004. Even here in the states I carry my own supply with me at all times.
I just noticed Hank doesn't look at the camera lens while speaking. Very strange for such an otherwise very professional YouTuber.
Mate I have given up on toilet paper. I don't know if they have this in America (I'm Australian) but there are these things called Sorbent Flushable Wipes (there are other brands, they're good too but I prefer the Sorbent ones) I call them Butt Wipes (but then I'm weird so....). They are like those alcohol wipes you get from takeaway places, except soft and kind to your cheeks and the brown eye therein and they are made to be flushed.\n\nI've taken to carrying a pack with me where ever I go. I keep a pack in my work bag. Cos you never know when you're gonna need to go, and paper just plays havoc with my dot. :)\n\nWow! This is not a subject I expected to comment about on YouTube today. Or any day for that matter. Nice to know I'm not the only one though. :)
Hank could start an NGO that will provide decent toilet paper to all who cannot afford or access it. Of course the advertisement would feature the butt song.
This was not the content I was expecting when I clicked on this video............but I am here for it
Hank as a melbournian most trendy hotels here use recycled toilet paper, the focus is on environmentally friendly over super soft
THIS MIGHT BE THE GREATEST VLOGBROTHERS VIDEO IN A LONG TIME. CLASSIC. AMAZING. LOVE JOHN. GO BUTTCHEEKS.
Gimme some + if you'd purchase a full length 2:21 These Are Your Butt Cheeks song. Or ringtone? Let us buy it Hank! But confuse us first, as Step 2 demands.
On behalf of my country, we're sorry we tortured you. I buy the nicest stuff too. Life is too short for that kind of misery.
2:21 for people who want to do an instant replay of that
This is what jet leg does to you
I'm with ya, bro. My hemorrhoid (Hector) and I splurge on the TP. Did you know there is a brand that has lotion embedded in it?????
Didn't realise that you can be delirious from jetlag. You learn something new everyday.
Looks like he found some shrooms down under 😆
I have butt problems on occasion and generally I've found that the cheapest single ply septic-safe generic brand stuff actually feels the best if I take the time to properly fold it prior to application; 5 sheets for the first wipe, 4 sheets for the subsequent 2 wipes that follow.
What I do in those hotels is to wipe my ass with Kleenex, they always put Kleenex
This was a good video 👍
You guys going to have to get some salve for that burn...which you will charge yourselves way too much for!
We've normally got nice toilet 🚽 paper in non-public toilets here in Australia. But yeah, I think some hotels skimp out on it and that's shitty of them (couldn't resist the pun).
is this really ALL you have to talk about after traveling to the other side of the world? :|
Also I really thought you were going to say something about the plebiscite and homophobia but no ok. Butt rants. We can deal with our own shit it's cool.
Our Hank is best Hank.
By 2015 we'll have flying cars\n2017: My Butt Has Some Complaints About Austraila
Cottonelle is the best toilet paper on the planet. Effective for cleanliness and comfort.
I am so glad this video is so high in trending. This makes me so so happy.
We have amazing toilet paper too... I'm sorry that your very nice hotel didn't splurge on the toilet paper.
I know plenty of people have had the same problem in nice hotels in Melbourne, but (heh) oddly not in other cities. Is it a Melbourne specific thing? Is it because Melbourne has a CostCo???
Just to let everyone know 2:20 is when the best 20 seconds of Hanks musical career starts
In Europe, they got bidets for days  hahaha, that was amzing
Can I use those answers for cards against humanity ?
How many channels is this guy on ???
Excuse me? The hotel had no bidet? You JUST said the bathroom had a bath tub AND a shower. I'm just saying anything is a bidet if you're brave enough.
Thank you for speaking on behalf of people with butt problems! The struggle is real!
While not at all gross, I felt weird about eating while watching this
Be -day. Fairly equal stress and no soft i.
The toilets in australia use like no water  so I assumed the shitty (haha) tp was because fancy stuff wouldn't flush well.
Wait, butt why did you make a video about this
Hank, go back to bed. You're tired.
Hank, just so you are aware, I'm pretty sure the price in the colored square (orange?) at grocery stores on toilet paper is price per 100 sheets or squares or some comparable cost metric between brands.
So much fun :) I love you Hank :)
Are red lines cancelled or sold out? I was so excited ya'll were coming to Bellingham. Guess I'm going to Portland!
+vlogbrothers Satin is a kind of weave - you could investigate it in your textile microscopy lab!
Ouch. I feel your pain and apologise on behalf of all Australians. We do have soft toilet paper here. The Pan Pacific should be ashamed.
I thought this would be about same sex marriage in Australia; Disappointed.
your son will be looking through those videos one day 😂😂😂😂i can't wait for the reaction
Why you don't use water rather than piper? Does it cost high to use it in bathroom?
#pantareaunpleasantness

1.youre a beta male simp\n2. austrailia is falling apart like sweden coz they gave women power and the right to vote for open borders and feminism the west is done you libtards need to face reality
You should get edge control to really get your hair to match, it'll look neater. Why Yana ain't taught you that yet?
WE MISS JASON!!!! i miss him cooking, and talking , and living. come back!!
Jason kinda dancing behind you in the background made my day 😂
okay a lot of you must not pay attention to her videos she's answered so many questions like more than once before... love ya sammi and also just chill about jason we only see a snippet of sam's life
Natural hair, short hair, long hair, dyed hair, hubby in video or out of video.. who cares all theses yrs of great content 👌🏾keep it up, your a stunner & your family is lush, stay blessed 🙏🏽
I've recently switched to decaf and it's done wonders for my stress/anxiety levels. Good luck!
Am I the only one who thinks Jason has the same voice as Jon Snow???!!! Lol... lucky you, love you Sam 😘
Fenty Beauty is making everyone so damn flawless, I literally have to get it when I get payed, gorg sammi!
U are really queen of the vlogs!! Moment with pink converse on escalators or girl eating from the box while she was waiting on metro...perfect moments;)
When you said I can't be bothered to do it about your hair, it reminded me of the Spice Girls movie when they showed the future scene of them all with children and I forget which girl said it but it reminded me of that scene!! Love you Sam <3
Jason reminds me so much of Kit Harrington!
Your family is adorable, really enjoying these vlogs - love seeing Jason in the vlogs too! 💖
Jason and you are so adorable together 😍❤️ I hope to find somebody who makes me laugh like he does with you Sammy ✨
I cut out coffee from time to time and it helps me with my anxiety. So it most definitely could be a link. Maybe switch to decaf if you need your fix. It does help...do try it lovely xxx
Definitely think about cutting back on the coffee. I've had to do the same because as much as i love coffee it just isn't loving me back
YOUR SUCH A GREAT MOM BE BLESSED!!!
Jason really needs to blog more 😫
nearly died when i saw u mention barbara love love love when u support other women!
Your vlogs are so relaxing! I've watched this like 4 times, lol
Hi Sammi, I'm sure you probably won't see this as I'm late to watch your vlog but I just wanted to thank you. I lost my baby a few days ago but while I was pregnant watching your videos and hearing you be so honest about the raw emotions you went through in pregnancy and still go through now in motherhood has been really refreshing and helpful for me as I suffered from depression and anxiety most my adult life, but you helped. So yeah.
We have not seen the banana bread
Is almost every comment a girl plz don't hate me if u offended
I've kinda missed Jason. Why isnt he in the vlogs anymore?
I can't wait to see the bag!!!!
Aww Sam you're a great mom \nLove your little family
Be careful out there Sammi! I always think of you anytime I hear about the awful events in London, especially in the subways 💜
That salad actually looks and sounds amazing to me!!
Does anybody know where Sammi's pink jumper is from? Not too sure if she mentioned it or not...? xxx
I would 100% recommend quitting coffee. I had really bad anxiety for years and was advised to give up and now my anxiety is so rare I can't even remember the last time I felt anxious. I know it's  brutal having  a baby with no coffee but I will take exhaustion over anxiety mixed with caffeine and exhaustion any day! hope it helps xxx
Honestly Sammi, I find it all the time that I have a bit more coffee than usual or than I need and bam... my anxiety hits me like a ton of bricks. Just the wrong amount of it builds it up so much for me, so cutting down will hopefully help any anxiety you have!
I gave up reg coffee years ago cuz I got bad anxiety. I drink decaf when I do drink coffee and I like it! Doesn't make me anxious. Also I looooove this tea by celestial it's called TENSION TEA. I'm not sure if they sell it in the UK but if they do it helps loads! It's for headaches but it's so calming. When I'm feeling anxious it calms me down. It's a life saver! I even keep a few in a ziplock bag in my purse in case I'm out and about and I feel anxious.
I think that people would like to see u editing/working/filming etc. because thats motivate us to work and set our goals hahahahah  ❤️  We like see your normal part of the day doing boring stuff and in this way I don't feel depressed for my everyday boring life too hahah
Hmm I think your jumper was upside down 🤔😂
i laughed out loud. thanks for sharing your personality with us -- it's really a joy.
Where is that pink chunky sweater that you were wearing in the beginning of this vlog from? The one that people were saying you were wearing inside out..
Coffee defiantly personally does effect my anxiety I'm not a very anxious person or one that has trouble with anxiety regularly but it kind of just comes in waves and coffee kinda helps it come up personally
Sam ❤❤❤❤ you're the sweetest we could gush on here for ages 😂 let's make the meet up happen xxx
How do you cook with nice clothes on? I would get 10 stains by just walking in the kitchen.
Jumpers on backwards in the dining room clip 😂
Love your outfit for the dinner! Your hair pulled back looks so nice!
Is that the Skip Hop high chair? Do you recommend it?
I also realized that cofee make me anxious
So cool seeing you as a mom and wife. You make it look easy💕💕
Coffee definitely makes my anxiety worse I cut out all caffeine for a while and it made a massive difference :)
Great video as always. Yours are my favourite to watch. I love Jason's dancing at 5:25 😂
inspired to bake! also love the BTS of you filming. such a pretty makeup look :) \nyou're totally right about how exercise like filming! just gotta do it and you never regret it
Your living room is a dream come true.
Where are your curtains from the pink ones ? 😍😍😍❤️
I had the same reaction with coffee, I started drinking it everyday in college and my anxiety was horrible. I thought it was stress from school that was making me feel not like myself but after I stopped caffeine I felt much better. Also it stains teeth and gives you heartburn lol
Where is the rug in your office from? Been looking for one just like that for ages! Xxx
you and barbara should totally do a collab! i've been waiting for a video of you two together for years! ♥
nice one with the banana bread :D
well I'm even more of a coffee addict than you and I've noticed that even when I have minimal amounts I still feel very ancious and drained. So I guess it depends
I also think that coffee makes anxiety worse because it releases adrenalin in your body so you're going to feel even more nervous... I'm currently cutting it down also, and drinking green tea instead which makes the transition soooo much easier
Didi anyone else at the beginning of the video hear It's cheeseday? :'D
I just love your vlogs. I don't even mind watching you make a salad. Indie is such a playful & intelligent baby. I love her smile, one can tell that she is loved very much! I can't wait until she starts talking. Thanks Sam for showing us more of your life. Yes, caffeine is very bad for anxiety. I've had years of struggle with anxiety. I also believe that making sure we eat enough and not skip meals is important too. Do they have decaffeinated coffee in England? We have it here in the States & it helps me to drink that. There still is a tiny amount of caffeine in decaffeinated coffee but, it's very low. You look so happy! \nLove,\nDebbie 💋
I need to make that banana bread sounds really good <3  Hope all is well lovely - really enjoy these vids I watch the while my little one naps and they always chill me out :) xx
This was the best vlog so far :D Keep it going girl :*
Hi Samantha, is your Missoma initial necklace the small one? And did you go with the Missoma chain?
... And I thought that I was crazy because coffee makes me feel anxious too 😳
I don't know why but I love seeing you tubers make coffee. I like to see what different kinds of ideas they have. So I love coffee talk!
As soon as I watched this I made vegan banana bread haha! Thanks for the suggestion xx
Now I can't wait to see that Maje bag😍
You looked so gorgeous with your hair pulled back and with the red lipstick <3
Sam: Please excuse my appearance  but she looks gorgeous😩❤️😍😍😍😍
I have a spot on my nose too, I feel your pain 😭😂😘
Less coffee more MAGNESIUM. Best thing for anxiety EVERRR
Can you do a full house tour?
Are you renting or did you buy your house? Love the vlogs as always! xx
Hello beautiful!  Just wanted to say that I absolutely love the table and chairs and my goodness, that solarium area just outside the dining room is absolutely to die for.  How lovely and relaxing it must be to just chill out there if you ever get the chance to as a new mum. 😘
I got the answer to my own question after watching your wedding video. Hannah looked beautiful. But she didn't outshine you. You looked absolutely, stunningly gorgeous.😃
the face indie did wenn she found you behind the sofa 😍
I am always really loving your videos. It's as if ur my friend or something and you give positive energy. Love that! And btw, the house is looking awesome!
Am I the only one who thinks Jason sounds and looks slightly like Jon Snow King in the North? Also he would make a good actor in GOT...
Just have to say.... ur the only person I watch that is real!! Who doesnt come across as self obsessed like so many others!! Just normal!! So funny and naturally pretty! Definitely my number 1 to watch!! 😘😘😘😘
Hey Sam I became a Barista about two years ago and started drink loads of coffee and with time noticed how it changed my mood so much started giving me anxiety and mind you your personality is just like mine so bubbly, fun, always smiling and after drinking so much coffee I noticed I always felt so down. So I cut down a lot I'll have one once a week and I feel so normal again it's hard to explain but definitely try it. And I know at times I'm like what is life without coffee lol but you'll be find love you Sam!!!
btw i started watching the handmaid's tale on your recommendation and omg it was so good!! haven't been that into a series in quite a while. thank you!!
Loved this vlog and loved seeing the family together, it's a shame people keeping being so rude to Jason in the comments. Let the man live people
Try decafe coffee just as nice☕️☕️
Barbaraaa 💘
Vegan, yes!
Lovely table!
<3
i love love loveeee your tattooed arm !!! it looks so freaking cool , cool mummy
❤️❤️❤️
Jason reminds me of Kit Harrington lol.
Love watching Indie.. she is adorable😘
I miss Jason in the vlogs! Came back to us Jason :P
Jason !!!! Thank you so much for saying hi to us. Do you know we all missed your chats in Sam's video.  Good to hear and see your dancing behind the scene. Sam nothing is boring...daily videos are my fav and i enjoy very much...heee..yea cant wait to see the make up video and the items you bought. Falling in love with Indie everytime we watch her growing....she is the center of attraction. Will love a home tour video when you are ready....😊
Always love seeing Jason! And I've been wanting to make banana bread for ages!!! Think I'm gonna do it tomorrow...
Jason has to be the worst youtube husband ever. Doesn't seem supportive at all. A smile would suffice? These vlogs are part of Sammi's livelihood and unfortunately for Jason he is going to be filmed sometimes.
Jason having a moan about Sam's mum being late 🙄🙄🙄 Here's an idea - look after your own kid you slack shit, since you do nothing all day???!
where are all you friends you used to be so social in your old videos before you got with jason and now you do everything on your own
I know you're probably super busy already but if you could put links to outfits in vlogs i would love you forever! i need me that blush jumper in the beginning girl! Aside from that thanks for always being entertaining.. your family makes my heart happy <3 x
Just love your fenty make up it looks so glowy and natural love you!!
You always look so amazing!
Why does Jason act dickish in the vlogs?
Is her fenty beauty vid up yet xx
i wish jason would talk more on the vlogs :( why not make it a family vlog channel?
Jason 😍 Loving vlogtember Sammi 😘

WHY IS HE SUCH A SNACK OMFG
I don't even like horror movies, yet this remake is one of my favorite movies ever.
He was good in hemlock
He sounds just like Alex!
Looks more like Brock Pierce I thought that was his brother..
That's a funny story mark
I thought this one was the youngest... just how many ARE there?!?!
That bottom lip was the scariest thing about the whole movie 🤡
Why is he.. so hot.
I look stupid trying to do this 😂

Hey people, I'm doing a video for my channel so send in your weird confessions
Yes, but does he know about the gazebos?
Omg! Just realized it. I thought the smile was a CGI manipulation, but it's real? Wow..
That's the face a make when I'm about to eat a whole bag of flaming hot cheetos.
The thumbnail creeped me out more than the movie -.-
i see why they had him play ..it, he is so f,ing ugly.
lol he doesn't like the kind that make that deep voice pennywise made. looking at him, i can't believe he played pennywise
Bill Skarsgård needs to play the Joker in a Batman movie. I believe he would be amazing at it.
😂😂😂 This is gold. The part you're looking for is 0:50! 😂😂😂
He could also be Ryuk from death note.
i love jared leto but i wouldn't mind bill being the next joker woooo
Take me now. Please.
It was that smile, that damned smile
I dont think its a demonic smile. I think its the smile of a creeper who stalks hot girls
Hey guys do you think you could check out my channel
He should be the Grinch even though Jim Carey is always #1
Harsh man.... like plastic surgery on drugs man.
Who else knows him only as Roman Godfrey?
It's the eyes man
Am I the only one that doesn't get phased by clowns
I love Bill S. hes a legend
I wish I could learn to smile like that 😂
like the earth is between its 2 poles! And we between 2 temples! if u dig deep! U will find treasures of gold and a fire burning within? there's a holy war within! And It comes with a born again sting! just ask your self why and there's a truth you can't deny! About the spirit of truth and the shadow of darkness within!
such a God'less, Jesus hating world... nobody talks about Jesus.. nobody cares.. there is none righteous, no, not onewait till you see the ruler that is coming. He will be worse than \nall rulers.. escape him now! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WttHEoX3ZoI
He can be Oona Laurence's father 😳
He doesn't need makeup to look like a low life clown
Why do people think he's hot...
<3 why is he soo..!!!!!   ill let him eat my arm any day ;)

If Nightmare Before Christmas had a live action adaptation, he would fit Jack Skellington perfectly.
HE IS SO CUTE WTF .
great genes
Damn fangirls
IT 😨
Nice video
the movie is lame, like a three out of 10 compared to original.  this guy is not scary but not hs fault...he tried his best.  i gave up on the move 3/4 into it.
Are we just gonna ignore De Bruyne's pass at the end of the game???
Early days but I think an english team could win it this year. Best bunch of teams we've had in the champions league for quite a lot of years now
They were the easiest goals I have ever seen\nWhat a Feyenoord doing
Man City look like a different class at the moment. They ripped Liverpool apart the other day😪 And destroyed Feynoord today⚽️
Media always pay to much attention to opposition teams playing badly vs City and never give City credit.
Feyenoord got hit with two stones
Second game in a row we've smashed a team that sing YNWA
Feyenoord so bad lol
De bryune is amazing his passing is filth
did anyone notice de bruyne's reaction at 0:31?? hahaha
KDB is absolutely insane! He has something special that no other football players have! He has such vision and control and plays intelligently! He is so accurate! 🤘🏻👑
arsenal will win champions league
Gabriel Jesus > Rashford
I am a man u fan but Mendy was worth the amount city payed 4 him
Best team ever. Come at me haters! 🖕🏿
Kevin d...was that a shot or a pass jks
Manchester city look strong this year .
Ok then well done bt
Kun Aguero, their greatest ever European scorer \n\nLast Time I checked Argentina was in South America...
MUST SEE!!! https://youtu.be/ZFAz2QKcOTA

Easy
When did feyenord sign Odell Beckham jr
.
Poor Feynoord
*Jesus* ftw
T
Feyenoord did well! Lol
Ayy
City have just smashed arguably the best side in Europe atm 4-0. There's no reason why we can't go on and win it now! #FeyenoordWho?
And to think Man City were gonna swap aguero for Sanchez aguero the far superior player.
Let's play a game. Which UCL game was Arsenal fans & players watching?
KDB better then kroos and modric, kroos and Modric are called the best because they are at real madrid
This is what happens when Brad Jones plays in goals...
lol  😂😂😂
I hope Man City lose their next game
Come On guys let's get BT to 400k subscribers
First one is an own goal. Comes off one leg which is going wide and then the other knocks it back on goal.
BT Only said that Feyenoord played bad.\nNever said we were good. City bashers all over
Anyone else hear that metal gear solid sound or am i bugging out
City might have the cash but can never buy history
i'm scared to watch spurs against city this year... city look solid
Arab FC.
Aguero being their greatest scorer in Europe isn't so impressive when the only time they have been to the Champions league is the past 6 years.
0:56\nEuropean? Someone needs a geography lesson...
Title is wrong says 3-0 to feyenoord
So you pay cash for Videos?
Never seen so many white people in London in my life.
Thats what you call support
Where are the fights?\nA handfull of idiots misbehave and you cunt jump on the bandwaggon and call the whole fan crowd shit.\nOur fans tried to hold them back, but you cant stop them.
cash 4 videos?  i have a video of me masturbating in stockings while looking at xhamster.... how much do i get for that?
We get it you pay cash for videos
I wish every club has fans like them who support the club where ever they go or however to do
Brilliant. That is proper support! Get to England no matter what and enjoy it. Fair play why are people moaning!
I wonder if they pay cash for videos...
And they sing in the hosting countries language... well done ;-D
it makes me feel good to see grand kids of nazis coming together for a common cause :)

Where do you see thousands fighting? It was maybe 20-50 idiots. And the police was not prepared....
I hope you didn't pay more than £2 for that non story
So where is the cologne? I was hoping a try some new ones.
3-1 you cunts.. delaying a game by an hour because you're all poor
Hitler is proud.
looks to me like a load of Krauts having a row with a few railings ..ffs..
The fuhrer finally took over london
All of this over a shitty game called football...
maybe insted of caring about shitty fooball so much they should march on the fuckin muslims.
maybe this will make you realise how plastic your fans and league really are
very embarrassing for Arsenal......totally taken.  UP THE CLARETS   BFC
So do you pay cash for videos?
Makes me wonder... where all these men are while Muslim immigrants were raping there women and beating people up on the streets in Germany on a regular basis.
Something about 3-1
Football fans r so obnoxious
What atmosphere!!! I love football with piece!!!!!
So the arsenal ultras are pussies? They lost their home stadium what a disgrace.
The Gestapo barmy army!!!
Hitler reincarnation !!!  german always superior , look at those pussy  englishman !!!
3:57 unnecessary stupid act. which fight?
Als hamburger ihr koelner jung macht mich stolz

Nice corteo respect from ultras malaya Malaysia english are pussy.
The germans...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXV2Y7Hvx4I
its easy 4 german fans to come to england we Serbians dont have money
DEUTSCHLAND ÜBER ALLES.
They are politically right or left?
I first thought Kolasniac's goal was the more difficult one but the Alex goal was just freaking ridiculous
Juergen Klopp at 6:21 ? 😭
English football hooligans are none existent nowadays.
Filthy Germans go kill some jews and allow some more paedophile Muslims to rape your kids.
Why would you waste your money on getting on a plane to get to a game but have no tickets are they that retarded
Very good support!!! Its normal for germany! \nWhere the arsenal supporters????\nBest greets to wilde horde &  northside do
Go German masterrace TAKE BACK THE CAPITAL OF THE GREAT BRITAIN MY FRIENDS. SEIG HEIL
Fuck me this brings back memories of 80's.... good and bad... apparently Arsenal knew they were coming Arsenal fans sold tickets on black market. BUT WORSE THAN THAT ARSENAL ALLOWED COLOGNE FANS TO BUY MEMBERSHIP FROM ARSENAL FC (TYPICAL GOONERS) COULDN'T ORGANISE A PISS UP IN A BREWERY. CRYING  BECAUSE REAL REAL FANS COME TO YOUR GROUND. YOU SHOULD HAVE OUT SUNG THEM INSTEAD OF WINGING ON SOCIAL MEDIA THERE WERE ONLY 5 ARRESTS PROBABLY THE AS MOST MATCH DAYS.... YO UNITED YO UNITED
Wenger out brigade's​ looking stronger and stronger by the day
Germans just taking over London like the should have during WW2 long live the Fatherland 88 Forever 🇮🇪
Take over London ? They lost and are bottom of the Bundersleague !
Come to Belgrade nazi scum!
FORZA GERMAN ULTRAS
So why dont they buy tickets?
Firstly I'm not your mate. They do need to advertise. There all over there country. You been to Germany recently? They've got big problems. But your right there far better ignoring it. Marching through the streets of London causing mayhem for a football match.
They won't try this in italy
WHAT IS UEFA GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS
FCP dragons piss on these nazi cunts

Korean folding tables
Was wondering if you had seen the new Mulberry mini trunk bag! They're sooo cute! xo
Hi Victoria, you can buy a Turkish style little round table with folding legs. This table is low and you sit on the floor. They come in different sizes. You can bring it out when u want and fold the legs and put behind a sofa when u'r done. You might find it online or if u can get u'rself to the Harringay area of london, green lanes, there are lots of Turkish shops there. U'll definitely find one there. Maybe an idea. Xx
We use the small white square table from ikea (can't think of the name but they're £5/7) easy to pop in the corner and use to display bits but light enough to move to the sofa to eat at! My son also uses it for activities.
What a fun time!! Would definitely love a closet tour! Xoxo, Caylie
I love your makeup look for your night out in New York 👌
Another fab video ❤️ would love to see s closer tour x
Yes closet tour!!!!😘 love you victoria
a closet tour would be very cool
What about a TV tray? I don't know if that's what it's called in England. It's a personal sized table that you unfold and use for food while sitting in the couch!
How about a fold away bistro table and chairs?
Yasssss closet tour pleaseeee 😁😁
closet tour please...loved this vlog❤❤❤
closet tour please 😍
Closet tour.... YES PLEASE!!💗😘
I WANT TO SEE A CLOSET TOUR <3 p.s. those manolos!!
Honestly can't wait for you to have your own house because I already know how amazing your walk in closet is gonna be! xx
Yes please to the closet tour! \nA possible idea for dining in a flat - an outdoor bistro style set with a small table and two chairs that all fold up. We've got a set in mint green and bring it inside for extra seating when we need it and it looks really cute! But of course, you'd still need somewhere to keep them whilst folded - behind the settee, behind a door, under the bed?!
You say Lykke the same way you say Hygge just with  an L and a K :) Closet tour...hell yeah! xx
The Kurt Gieger boots are so beaut it hurts!! 😍😍😍 I'll have to save up for them 💛💛💛
I love how Alex is smiling at you while you were unpacking your little bag at the end...it's so sweet to see how much he loves to see you getting exited ☺️❤️
I really want to try the balmain lipsticks. I saw the advert which is amazing, the colours are insane. Yes please can we have a wardrobe tour. It may need to be two videos lol. Some fab products to try and some much in one video you busy bee. Xx
I love the new shoes from Manolo, especially the second pair!  You lucky girl!
Love all the vlogs, such an amazing chance to see you in your day-to-day life! A closet tour would be absolutely fab! A totally unrelated question: where do you do your brows? They are always on fleek! (and I keep wondering for the past 5 videos I think)
You should buy some folding TV trays to eat on.
We use the oblong trays that have a cushion on the underneath for eating our meals without a diningroom table, the cushion makes it comfy and so it doesnt slide off your knees.
use a TV tray. they're individual trays on a stand you can put in front of a chair or couch. and they fold up really small. it's probably easier than sitting on the floor. but probably not super sturdy or for fancy dining. good\nluck~
I'd love to see a make up collection video 💕
Alex' look at 16:36 😂 he knows how crazy Victoria is about make up 😂 so cute
Please do a closet tour!!
You could always get little tray tables so you can sit on the couch and eat? A little like a TV dinner 😂 but they work and can be stored easily!
Big 👍👍👍👍👍for the video and for a future closet tour!! Secondly Welcome to the U.S. I hope that you thoroughly enjoy yourselves here! Please stay and be safe!!
Also - I have a coffee table that lifts up to dining room table height. Love it!
Yes Victoria, we would love to see a closet tour!! can''t wait to see you at fashion week!!! Loved your watch at the end of the vlog.
You can get some cushioned lap trays. They will suffice until you get a better table solution. Great for dining and easy to store. x
So excited for you always!please do a tour please😘
Hello Victoria, thank you for a very lovely video :-) I would much appreciate a closet tour, thanks for suggesting :-) Greetings from a rainy Paris <3
Would love to see a closet tour please! Can't wait to see your vlogs from NYFW😍
Yes for a closet tour !!! You have the best fashion style of any You Tuber I know !!🙌🙌
In my apartment we use this :\nhttps://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/tbl-oregon-high-top-set?category=furniture&color=010\nThe stools stack and fit right under the table :)
You need a drop-leaf table. I have one that acts as a console while not being used for dining. They come in every shape and size. Love you're vlogs, they always make me smile.
aaah a closet tour *.* your style really inspires me , when i do shopping and i find something similar to your style i say to mom well that s like victoria , and i m being more brave to try and find out new things that i figure out i really like :D  , PS : those ankle boots thoe *o*
In my friends tiny apartment she had a long lounge area. She put two stools against the wall a small bar in front and couch in front of that. It worked well. Would love to see a closet tour!!
I was super excited for you when you was opening  the VB bag! \n😆❤️ It was OmG omG!
I've got the same table situation as you, and my flat is even smaller than yours. The Suki table from Habitat is amazing as it looks stylish and can fold three ways: really small and flat against a wall, pulled out as a half moon to seat two people (which is how I keep mine all the time and it takes up hardly any room in the lounge), or you can fold it out fully to seat four people. It comes in white or black. I also got the airo metal table from Habitat for when I'm on my own and just want to eat in front of the TV. It's also handy for working on laptop in the lounge, and folds down flat to store under the bed. For the Suki table we just got the metal Macadam chairs from Habitat as they come in cute colours and only cost £12 each. It meant we could get four for when we have friends over for dinner, and store two of them under the bed. Some things are on the Habitat site, and some are on Argos' Habitat section (Argos do same day delivery!).
Love your vlogs babe! Hope you had fun in NYC!! We use these trays!!! it has a cushion underneath so it's so comfy to eat with it in your lap!!!!!  http://www.dunelm.com/product/beautiful-birds-lap-tray-1000069617 xxxx
Victoria can I just say how much I love your vlogs?! Been watching you since you started your channel and absolutely love getting ready in the morning (like now) and watching these xx
Hope we will be getting 'what I wore for FWNY' video with Instagram inserts like last fashion week(s) and get to hear ur process of putting outfits together, instead of solely seeing new gifted & purchased pieces.\n\nAnd for gen content I would love to see a video about multiple ways to wear one statement designer piece? Maybe starting with all the ways you wear your statement white blouses? Or maybe just choose one pair of shoes to base a look book around?! Xxxxx\n\nTweeted u about beanbag dinner trays
Alex smiling in the background as you squealed over the makeup was so cute
OMG YOU'RE#7 TRENDING IN THE UK
Cant wait for outfit post from you for this fashion week! Soo curious to see what you have chosen to wear for it :)) Those heels reminds me of something a barbie doll would wear lol so cute though :p
You're definitely my favourite now. Really enjoy your videos and look forward to the next one. I'm probably older than your usual demographic but I don't care 😀
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\nFashion Video with 40,000 Views in 24 Hours = 16 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
OMG, I'm in love with your living room carpet! Where did you buy it? xoxo
I have some friends who have a small apartment in NYC and they bought a kitchen table and cut it in half and used brackets to attach it to the wall, almost like a breakfast bar. It looks super cute and quirky!
What a question.  Oh course you need to do a huge Closet Tour 😍😍😍
where is the white band you wear around your head when you do your make up from?
Victoria I want ask you about your mascara ???
Lol .. ours is tv breakfast tv lunch and TV dinner 😂😂😂😂
I can't believe you got thousands worth of dream products and just rattled it off like a Tesco order! So jealous!!
You really have opening products with your left hand down pat.  Victoria Beckham - how wonderful.  Alex is really cute and patient half watching you on the bed lol.
creased when alex was watching what you got gifted then realised it was make up and lost interest 😂
I don't know hoe big the livingroom is but maybe smering like a walltable with some low barchairs?
what is name of your favorite ray bane sunglasses ? i cant remember .... :/ also it is soooo sweet to see how you shine when you are with your boyfriend
i was expecting a video and got a vlog😤
Victoria, you really shouldn't hang your knitwear, it's going to ruin it in the long run (I've learned it the hard way!)
We used to live in a small flat in London and had a table similar to this. It can go from a normal height coffee table to a fold out dining table. It's kind of two sides of a table on top of each other which swivel and fold outwards. Or you can keep it smaller and just raise the height. It was honestly perfect! I think the brand was Callagaris we bought it from a furniture shop in spitalfields \n\nhttps://www.heals.com/magic-j-table.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6YXbsY2n1gIVQr7tCh2g3A7TEAQYFyABEgJJlvD_BwE\n\nI can't find the calligaris one we had but it was more like this https://www.styleourhome.com/mascotte-wenge-multi-purpose-table.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsdDaiJGn1gIVZ7vtCh1ZlASaEAQYCCABEgJl6_D_BwE\n\nWe used it for 7 years and my bro now has it in his flat another 7 yes on and the mechanism still works perfectly xx
your skin looks beautiful!
I dont care much for shoes, but those you got are sooo beautiful! Hope you keep getting all these wonderful things. Cause you really know how to show them. Love!
Hey vic, mind to let us know what nail colour you wore in this video?? It's amazing😍
From this valley they say you are leaving\nWe shall miss your bright eyes and sweet smile\nFor you take with you all of the sunshine\nThat has brightened our pathway a while\n\nRIP good sir
Seeing him play this made me deeply happy. I think he's one of the finest actors around.
RIP dear Harry (Carl) :(

My favourite classic country song.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. One of the great character actors who's been in so many great movies.
is it just me or is the sound a little weird?  low volume and 'wavey'.
please let's get this on the series soundtrack!
Right
Rest in peace Harry.  You were fucking awesome.
Rest in Peace Harry

RIP HARRY & THANKS 4 THE MEMORIES MAN 💖 ✌ X X X
Thank you for all you gave us through the years. Rest in Peace and God's love.
Fifty years ago I went to the pictures to watch Cool Hand Luke  and I enjoyed him singing Just a Closer Walk With Thee which was brilliantly evocative, and very apropos. I think that was the first time I'd ever heard a religious song that wasn't dull. This clip is good, VG considering his age and the effects age has upon the vocal chords.\nHe should have sung more during his career.
He was great in Repo Man.
Rest in peace Mr. Stanton, and condolences to those he leaves behind.
:-( Rest in peace sir. You helped to make my movie going experience memorable.
Awsome actor love his movie pretty in pink... RIP dear Dean💗
I never knew you Harry but I Loved You.
RIP Harry Dean! God bless you!! Thanks for all your movies and songs!
It's all a game. It's just a movie. Enjoyed your talent, Harry. RIP
Rest In Peace Harry Stanton.
Always enjoyed his acting. Such a talented man. :-( R.I.P. Harry
Rest In Peace, Harry.   You will be missed.
RIP You left a mark.
Rest in Peace Harry, you deserve it.
One of the best actors, and...dammit, I can't do too much more of this timeline.
Fuck the people who hit dislike on this video.
RIP, My favorite man of all time. 💔
I just found out he passed. So touching...
Simply touching. RIP, Sir.
Rest in Peace, Harry

Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\n\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\n\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \nSee here; \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\n\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\n\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\n\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\n\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\n\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\n\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\n\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \n\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\n\nMuch Love to You\n\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\n\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info

LOVE THOSE ⭐️HEELS 😍
I absolutely love the silver shoes!!
Keep the shoes! End of discussion. :D
It doesn't really do anything. It just smells nice I swear they're gonna put that on my gravestone lol
I would not keep them, they're gorgeous, but so specific I wouldn't wear them over and over... I don't know, you go to much more events than I do hahahaha
Keep the star shoes. They're gorgeous! On the other hand, those Balenciaga boots look really pointy and weird, I feel like you could invest your money on something better😊
I always feel rude when I'm doing anything and they are working on my hair. I won't even touch my phone. And I feel like I have to make small talk with them. Thus I dread going to hairdresser! I actually hate it. I wish I could just cut my own hair if I could. But u seem to love it! So that's great!
KEEP THEM! xx

KEEP THE STAR SHOES!!
The shaft/upper of the boots is so  flattering and hugs your legs, but I question why the toe box is so super pointy, but you wear many skirts and I could see you getting use/many wears out of them in especially fall/winter!
I loved this vlog ❤️ You're so natural in front of the camera!

Where is Natasha moving to?
The shoes with the stars are amazing
when you're not a 100% sure and think about it too much - you know it has to go ! hahaha - But on the other hand those shoes were lovely.
Hello dear, looking amazing as usual..I love your watch can you tell me where you got it please? Thank you :) keep shining
OMG the thumbnail for this video had your hair looking that grey color so many are going and I was worried cause you are too warm for that.
I need to start wearing skirts more often gosh!!!
This was one of my favourite vlogs!!!
Loved,loved your vlog 😍😍and please do a house tour of your friends apartment. It looks like every girls dream. I am always confused of your house,do you have two kitchens?
The skirt is amazing! I love your hair too
I feel like the star shoes will be perfect for xmas events

Love the hair colour and length on you 😍
Keep the silver shoes! They are so gorgeous! Not such a fan of the sock boots though...
You make me wanna dye my hair💗💗
JonTron Video with 300,000 Views in 50 Minutes = Nowhere on the Trending Page\n50,000 Views in 2 Day = 17 On the Trending Page\n\nOut of curiosity, how much *does* is cost to bribe YouTube to be on the Trending Page?
I think we all need a Bathroom Cabinet video featuring your mothers bathroom cabinet haha! But honestly I remember that one video we got a sneak peak and it was so cool!
Loving the Givenchy bag!! House tour please✋👌✋👌✋👌✋
Aww! Best wishes to Natasha!! She is always so sweet in your vlogs, over the years!! Xoxoxo 🙏🏼☺️🙌🏼💙
Your look so beautiful in this vlog, love your new hair, eye makeup without wing liner and that skirt, so pretty!
I love that depiboo took your hair darker for fall.... autumn?.... fall. Fall sounds better 😂 It looks incredible anyway, as does the tan skirt. The knife boots make me think of Devil Wears Prada and those star shoes though 😍😍😍
any small YouTubers want to be friends ?❤️❤️
Love you Amelia ;) Always great to see you sweet heart 💕And Loooove your new hair xxx
Love the shoes, dislike the boots. Your mom's so sweet.
I thought I spotted some pastel pink! Looks very beautiful!!
Okra and eggplant tray bake. Snap off the tips of okra, slice eggplant in half, brush with oil and bake! (Or roast, whatever)
Keep the star shoes!!!!!!
Oribe = Oar-bae  :)  According to my hairdresser when I pronounced it Oh-reeb.  I do wish you would feature your mother more.  She is more my demographic and I would to hear her beauty and hair tips.  I may have to start a letter writing campaign for her to start her own channel.
If you just put the okura in the boiling hot water to cook, it takes no time at all to prepare it. Dip them in soy sauce to eat. Really simple!
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE! Keep them! ✨
You are so beautiful Amelia !! JUST stunning 😍😍😍😍
Yes to to the shoes! New Years!
You so need those star shoes in your life Amelia! Your hair is amazing! xo
Hi Amelia,\n\nObsessed with Phillipa's pad! I am moving in a month, I wish you could do a tour soon... But I'll be happy if you at least tell me what kind of curtains those are (like the specific curtain slang for it) Living for that wallpaper btw gonna ask my landlord if I can wallpaper the loo lol!
I feel like buying stuff online with the mindset of just being able to return isn't v considerate of yer carbon footprint and the environment. Just something to consider if you care!
Can't wait for Philippa's house tour! 😍😍😍
So relatable
So relatable 😂😩
this was too relatable woahh 😂😂😂
Achuly achuly achuly love love love love ur ur ur hoodie!!!!!!!! Need
We still use that shitty mats
the fucking projectors!
Legit all those things u ticked r still my skl nowwwww
CAN RELATE SOOOO MUCHHHH😂😂❤️❤️
We had to get changed on the class room all of us til year five 😑 and in year 6 all the boys went round the corner to get changed and we had a male PE teacher who stayed in the class room 😑😑😑😑
School is definitely not different now 😂😂😂😂
My high school that im in now is all those things. Its 60 years old!!
Yhhh same year 3&4&5 had to get changed in classrooms
I'm 15 and almost all of the things he was saying that we wouldn't understand I had going through primary school and intermediate... Is NZ really that out of date?
We had to get changed in the classroom up to year 6 I think 😂
Most of them were relatable especially in primary school and I'm 13 lol my primary school is so much better now though
Yup, you still change behind tables till year 4 and never shower. Now I'm in year 7. #GOALS
Schools are still like this now, I'm in year 9
I GOT CAUGHT FOR THROWING WET TOILET PAPAER ON THE ROOF!!
when the teacher used the smart board as a white background for the projector ahaha ahh technology
Im still in school and its exactly like that tbh
my school was the exactly the same
I can't relate to any of that🙊😂 and I'm sure that it is because I'm from Uruguay 😂😂
Omg I’m actually watching this instead of doing my Flow of Energy project 😂
I live in America but most of this stuff was relatable for me in elementary school!! I'm in high school now but public school still sucks
I'm a sophomore now and most of this was when I was in elementary. Except the uniform stuff.
I'm 15 and from Midwest but my public school is like that for he most part. Except instead of taking trips for urban planning we took field trips to farms. I reckon I have taken about 20 trips to farms. But rest of US probably isn't like this they probably are more urban and newer.
WE STILL HAVE TO CHANGE BEHIND THE TABLES I CANNOT WAIT FOR YEAR SEVEN
No lol! im in y6 and we do it ( thats because i have a poor small school)
I loved this because I was I started getting all the new electronics in secondary school so throughout primary it was all like this, how did we survive
That happened to me too Marcus. We stood behind our chairs and would change with the opposite gender
In French last year there were dicks in the French dictionary's
Omg pretty much everything there was relatable to me!! I remember all the stuff, especially when I was in Junior school! And we still have the blue gym mats in my high school!
It's crazy how most of these people are in secondary and there's me in uni man I feel old 😂
lliterally can relate to all those things lol
My school is so shit it is legit exactly like that 😂😂😩
What's sad is I remembered all of this !!!! THAT WAS ONLY 3 years of school
This video is so relatable
We had to change in the classroom up to year 6😂😂😂
They still get  changed all in the same class room girls and boys at r school it was till year 5 I thought it was weird as well 😂😂
swear down i left primsry school 2 years ago and its the exact same as everything in this video. And there was aso weird handprints everywhere and before it was a school it was a massive tip where everyone put there shit so rumours went around that it was haunted looool
i'm in high school now and it's exactly like that ahha
THIS IS MY SCHOOL RIGHT NOW😂😂
Some of them remind me of primary school but honestly both my schools seem like fancy afffff compared to these like 😂😂 we have heated floors and designer settees in our sixth from area 😂🙅🏽
Pahahaha this is so relatable. We had to change in the class room as well until like yr 4
I like how Marcus is saying school has probably changed now but I can relate to more of these then he did and I've just left school
I'm in year 11 and this still sums up my life
I'm just going to say this now. School hasn't changed lmao
omg!! im 14 and my primary school and secondary school are/was exactly like that!!!
Im in year 8 and they still have over half this stuff in 2017😂😂
that describes my primary school perfectly.
Everything in my school is still like that haha x
When I was in primary we had to change in the classsroom it didn't seem weird at the time but now I look back I think it's weird af
A lot of schools are still like that now😂
this is literally my school now lol
I'm 14 and started school 10 years ago and my school was as shit as his!!😅
Does the work exposing really have to be in the title? It could have just been what my school was like
Yeessss, we used to changed under the tables in our class room until form 4, my school doesn't look like that but there was a lot there I could relate to !
literally the most relatable thing, i m in year 10 now but i remember those radiators in like year 4 lol
Most of those things relate to my school and I'm still in school
Not a lot has changed. xD
He didn't click show my results ?
is it weird that I'm twelve and this perfectly describes my old primary school so I guess schools haven't changed that much
My school is still the same😂😂😂😂😂😂
I feel like all state schools in the UK are the same no matter where you live 😂😂
Those projectors were the worst. You could never read it properly and it would always be wonky. And the writing on the little laminated sheets would always show up blurry. I can relate so much !
I just finished primary school this year and everything is so relatable except for a few things but still relatable
No 1000% agree with the fact that getting changed in a classroom with all the others was wierd
ikr we get changed for P.E and like its weird
Welsh schools are exactly the same English are but better
yess we had to get changed in the classrooms behind our tables up to year 4 lmao
Yeah our primary school did that too, until year 5 and 6 where girls changed in the cloakroom/corridor and boys in the class, the gym had no changing rooms but the pool did
that was so relatable- i went to school in the uk and my primary school had everything from the blue paper towels to the hard p.e mats
so much i can relate to a lot of this. when i was in year 6 my form room was a portable cabin but it was only for half of the year as they had finished building the new school one which the new school is 10 years old this year it crazy. what i dint get was we had showers in the changing rooms but wee were not allowed to use them.
I relate to every single one of these
OH MY GOD I RELATE TO SO MUCH OF THIS !!!!
In year 11 and everything is still the same
I'm now in year 10 but my primary school stilll has loads of theses things 😂😂😂😂😂😂
There all relative to me and I'm 12
omg sooo relatable and I'm in year 11 and primary school especially was very relatable
Literllay 90% of this was readable and I am on my last year of high school down in America
In year 12 right now and this couldn't be more true
Literally don't think schools have changed one bit, that was the most relatable quiz ever
Honestly im not even 20 and these all relate to me sooo much
I'm 14 and this vid is still so relatable
I'm 14 but this is literally my primary school 😹
For my school, we all got changed In a classroom behind our tables (boys and girls) up to year 5 and then when we got to year 6 boys and girls changed in different rooms. Thinking back to it now I find it weird
i swear to god im only in bloody year ten and litteraly everything on that is true and also in primary the boys and girls got changed in the classroom together up until we left coz we didnt hav changing rooms but some of us would just get ready in the loos lmao
i'm in year 11 currently and all of this is literally my primary school 😂😂
I'm only in year 9 and I can relate to loads lol 😂👌
I'm 15 and my primary was legit the same
I'm about 10 years younger then Marcus and that is my school I would have ticked everything off
I'm in year 8 and most those things I relate to also at 3:05 that's literally my school until year 4 girls and boys would change together in the classroom and I remember in year 2 this boy showed me his Fucking dick
I'm in school now and soooo much of it is the same except from the projected and the tv 😂😂
Only in year 11 but I can relate to so many of these from primary😂
I am older than Marcus and from a shittier country but our school was a lot better than this.
can someone send me the link to this quiz i cant find it
I related to pretty much everythinggggg haha x
I left school just over two years ago and I can relate to every single thing you ticked😂
This is exactly what my school was like 😂 I do wonder how different school in other places such as the states are 🤔
The music ruined the video
Six and the City 👍
5-0 4-0 6-0 ... RIP Palace next week
Pep bringing la liga scorelines to the epl
easy
again not good enough #pepout #Cityincrisis
Take note all you bitch ass City haters, we're on a man hunt and hungrier than ever !!!
Crystal Palace next LOL!
C'MON CITY
Heavy breather
You city fans should appreciate every day this guy is your manager. Coming from a Bayern Munich fan. After he leaves you will miss this astonishing performances believe me. No matter who comes next
*Where's all the City haters saying Pep is a fraud now? That was an absolute slaughter & so was Liv'pool 5-0. As a Chelsea supporter I fear City this season.*
Looking real good for Guardiola...Jesus has forced Aguero to step up his work rate and now Aguero has the ability to become golden boot
EPL welcome to total football, watch and enjoy, just starting #takenoprisoners
Best bald manager in the world.😁😂😂
Aguero golden boot>>>>>
im the best thanks for the upload, beany!
I'm a city fan but let's not get carried away. Let's not trash talk or be cocky yet. Injuries and complacency can happen at any time. Plus we got chelsea at the end of this month and still yet to play top 6 sides.\n\nI really hope we defend against the top sides and not commit the fullbacks too much forward against them.
best manager in the world okay city come on pep come on city...
*_Great win for City_*
Are United still the favorites???!???!?? 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 Top of the league from here on out
aguero  fanstastic
Big sigh, wish he was at Arsenal!
!´m so so happy!
Why are people not commenting fraud
How awesome was that performance? That was total and complete football...\nIf only PEP wasn't a fraud? We'd be even better, if Pep was a decent manager.... But apparently he's a fraud according to some football geniuses.
When Real and Barcelona win 6-0 English fans ARE TOLD BY THE ENGLISH MEDIA that the Primera is an easy league and the Premier League is the tough League where the big teams die to win!! when City win 5-0 against Liverpool and 6-0 against Watford what happens to the tough Premier League?!! WAKE UP ENGLISH FANS....ITS ALL PART OF MARKETING...
I'am Man.United fan but i admitted the football from City just amazing to watch.\nAttacking Football that he brings to City simply magnificent.\nAs a lover of attacking football i admire his philosophy.
even we didn't play our best xl so don't take it easy united dogs
WHERE ARE ALL THE PEPS A FRAUD TROLL'S NOW. YOU ARE NOT, YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE JEALOUSY IS A SILENT M*THER F#CKER INNIT .GORD CTID. OOWHHH MAN CITY.....THE ONLY FOOTBALL TEAM TO COME FROM MANCHESTER®
The pep haters are low in numbers on the comment section. I wonder why!
Bald fraud
Money talks
MCFC!
Guardiola the team that played the last 20 minutes is  amazimg use them offten. And we fans Will watch beutifull football.
beautiful
IN PEP WE TRUST 100%
Pep is a fraud. Spent £1 billion and can't score 10 goals against Watford
BEST FRAUD IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!
Don't let this romp fool you ,Citeh will collapse either midseason or late season like they always do.
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
Can not say he is the best till he bring city the champ of epl...
Faggot
fraud! city will bottle it towards the end of the season
Still gonna fail in the Champions League😂\nPARIS EST MAGIQUE!
This isn't a auction! 😂
I love danger noodles Also that boa is beautiful
So you put a Boa CONSTRICTOR in a tank where only Link's face and NECK are exposed. Sometimes I find it amazing that one of you hasn't died yet.
I talk to myself all the time in parseltongue
Haha yes that's funny
Wow I didn't think that would work but it worked realy well
Be your Mythical Best Serpent King!
Interesting experiment but dislike because it could be potentially life-threatening. Don't do this for greater views and fame, guys. You already got plenty...think of your family for god's sake.
This eerily reminded me of when Ramsey Bolton tortured Theon in game of thrones
but... that snake isn't dangerous to humans, at least not anything larger than a baby.  And of all the germ things they did, the only one that actually involved germs was the cough/nose blow. ???
You can do it Serpent King!
CLARKSVILLE TN IS WHERE I LIVE
#QTMBA: Seeing that gravity is what keeps our atmosphere here, I imagine my first course of action would be dying of asphyxiation.
Poor Link. He's so scared! 😓
Link wasnt talking to himself in third person he was just referring to himself in third person
The Rick Astley intro music made my day
I died when Link said - Bad words coming to mind..
Is dat erika and megan...how do u invite them in the vid
I don't get why people are afraid of snakes or spiders?
If gravity suddenly falls... Huh... That sound familiar
You can see how *excited* Link is when he says, Let's talk about that.
*link can breathe through his a n u s*
I wonder how many times they said link 😂
Mythical beasts, help us go viral to pay for Hurricane damage https://youtu.be/uc6MMTuMeac
I like how Link was scared of Rhett's hand 😂
I talk to myself A LOT and im also a very stressful person, so everything makes sense now. 
Clarksville, TN?\nThis city is so small, how have I not met these people or at least seen them?
my snakes name is jade lol
Would Howie Mandel survive in that box with the germaphobe one?  Bc he only gives fist Bumps, but- one Americas got talent he held the guys phone with no problem. Like... a cell phone is one of the dirtiest things. Way worse than shaking someone's hand
Seems like such a technique would work because it almost encourages a dissociative state that could become a disorder for some people. Seems dangerous, if undeniably effective.
The word link sounds weird now.  Lol
Make a challenge where Rhett loses he has to shave his beard
Your heart rate drops when you talk period because you are temporarily holding your breathe. You don't have to refer to yourself in third-person you just have to talk and your heart rate will drop until you stop talking to yourself and start breathing normally again.
My current heart rate is 63bpm
Link sounds like Dobby when Dobby talks about Dobby's love for Harry Potter
😂 the intros on these are so weird I LOVE THEM
What was in that diaper
I feel like it works just because it would be a good distraction. And the talking could help regulate your breathing better.
I used this technique at school the other day, it really does work wonders. :)
I HAVENT BEEN WATCHING SO LONNGGGGGGG, IVE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR 2 YEARS!!!!!! D,: missed you guys so much!!
this is not a valid experiment, where is the control group?
Who else loves snakes and would love to be where link is
Link became not a name anymore during the snake one.
Why do we torture link for views 😂
They made Stevie throw in something disgusting so no-one would make sexual joked about it.\n\nDon't think we don't know these things.
It's reallllly helpful if you have mental illness. I and others have learned about this is counseling and ptsd groups. It works for me, but some people are too afraid to do it because people will think they're crazy. If you think that, you are stupid. It's just like if someone else is saying things that make you feel better. I have a panic disorder and it helps lower my anxiety talking to myself. Except I say positive things, like you are safe, you're okay.
when I'm stressed out I talk to myself and I don't even notice. My friends get very annoyed
The People at *ichigan probably had low iQs if they talk in third person. Can anybody tell? OHIO STATE BUCKEYES FAN!!!!!!!!!!
explore the world's look for super power
My name is Jade O-o
7:00 a new meme was born
These Chuck E. Cheese commercials are getting seriously annoying
Part 2? Is there a part 1?
I think this is what's called thinking objectively (Link is...) vs subjectively (I am...). Loved the episode and aftershow! <3
Rhett thinks Link is going to be choked
It looked like period blood on that diaper 😦
Link no longer sounds like a name
I LOVE THE NEW INTRO!!!!!!!
WILL IT HAT!😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🎩🎩🎩
Omg, that intro😂
link did it\ngratz buddy
Cute little danger noodle😊
I laughed so hard

Nice Rick Ashley remix
Also from Clarksville!!
Eating pianus can be stressful y'all
I dunt even knuw wut link is anymure
That cute little expression 4:30
Hahaha! Rhett loves when Link is uncomfortable.
Peainus
So cool😒
7:00
*Snaps* *Nasally voice* Actually, you used CORN snakes. Geez, get it right Rhett.
Snakes are so cute!
Seeing that Link were about to cry made me cry a little for myself..
😕🙁☹️🐍
When Link looked up at Rhett and said he thinks pigs can breath through their anus he reminded me of Doby
merch in bio
That's a happy danger noodle
I'm definitely gonna try this 💙💚
How do they get insurance for these shows lol
I always knew Link was the Serpent King
Remembering part 1 of this Luke you can do it serpent king
🎵Let's get Link's heart beating faster faster🎵
Ice bear talks in *third person*
I've always talked to myself ever since I started to talk and still do, honestly I can't really think well if I don't say something lol
I talk to myself, but not in third person...
YOU CAN DO IT SERPENT KING
I felt so sorry for Link. He looked like he was gonna cry.
Link doesn't understand the difference between talking TO yourself and ABOUT yourself.
*PLEASE* do an Ear Biscuit featuring Amelia Gething.
the Socks stank soo much i cri everytim
Hail the Serpent King
cool nerds I'm literally offended.... just bcz they're hard workers doesn't give u the right to call them so... and btw u think you're funny?? well u are sooo lame my bird committed suicide.... unsubscribing.. oh i wasnt even subscribed in the first place.
I want one of those heart rate monitors just to see mine!
Link talking to himself reminds me of elmo 😂 Elmo is scared 😂
No wonder Elmo is so happy all the time XD
He's been hitting the gym big time 👏👏
nick: *is cleaning the pastry*\nme: I'd eat that
nick jonas spat on it , i'll eat it anyways #NotAshemed
He's so hot n buffed 😍
Is that how he spits shawn's asshole?
The things I want to do to him are too rude for a YouTube comment
This was really bad.
¿why my husband Nick Jonas are giving you a message?..
There is no need to worry, for God loves you all\nThursday, 8 May 2014 @ 23:30\nMessage 1120\nMy dearly beloved daughter, look around you and you will see many people living carefree lives.\nYou will see laughter, joy and great comradeship and you will know that only this can come from God.\nMany people, once they know the truth, will embrace me with open and grateful hearts and then we will be one.\nMy plan is to gather all and flood them with great love, joy and happiness.\nI will delight in my new Kingdom and there will be much laughter, joy and beauty, as well as eternal life.\nLove will exude from every single creature; every single soul and life will be perfect.\nWhen you worry about the future of the world, remember what I have told you.\nAll will be well, once I come to gather you, into the new world, without end.\nThere is no need to worry, for God loves you all.\nAs for souls who live a deprived and sorrowful life, they will be gathered first, if they accept who I am.\nThose who are in terrible darkness will be given \nextraordinary graces to cleanse their souls, so that I can loosen the \ngrip of the evil one over them and take them into the safety of My \nMercy.\nThis is a battle and it will be hard fought, but the \npower of the Most Holy Trinity will be exerted and \n                 souls will be \nenlightened, so that they will not perish.\nI will raise important leaders amongst you and with an\n army spread in every nation, you will swell and take with you most of \nGod’s children, into the New Paradise.\nLook to me with trust and do not fear My Love, for you\n must know that I would never willingly frighten you, because when I \nmake my presence known, it will fill you with great wonder and joy.\nI assure you, there is no need for fear, for I am love, itself.\nLove will soothe you and when you face me, Your Jesus,\n you will be struck with a sense of instant familiarity, which is only \npresent when your heart becomes entwined with mine.\nHow I love you all and how I yearn for your souls.\nYour Jesus\n\nShare this:
His so Freaking YummY :)
Wish I could change places with the host!!!, minus the audience  :-)
Why do they always do that weird thing at the start when there like yeah hi but I'm not going to saying anything funny until everyone is quite.......
Things you gotta do to promote your SONG!!
is he playing in a movie or does he just want to get huge ?
Nick Jonas stole my heart when I was only 14 and still does the same <3 :)
Saw him live last year...it was amazing!
The way he cleaned that pastry...
he's hot but I miss the slimmer version of him, beautifully perfect now he's a bit chunky... well hot anyways
The great guitar master xD
Oh how I wish he was an intern at my firm...
The reason he's so damn buff is probably because he played an MMA fighter in the TV show Kingdom. He's seriously ripped in the show. Its actually a decent show-turns out the kid can act and very well actually. Unfortunately it only has 3 seasons but its still worth watching.
He's so hot ugh
Is it me it or does his voice sound different?
The only guy that i think is the most humble person ever.
Happy birthday Nick Jonas. YOU'RE SO HOT. Ok bye.
between 1d and nick jonas james is living every girl's dream. \nmaybe not every girl but sure as hell mine!
OMG Nick Jonas is such a hunk...like I can't lol
nick looking like a SNACK
Nick seni yerim kfmfkd
Could you please send me his curriculum? 😂
The way the shirt wrapped around Nicks muscles...  Oh child 🙌
IF NICK JONAS GAVE ME TAT PASTERY I WILL LOVE TO EAT IT HAHAHAH
I wish Nick would rub me like that 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I would eat the pastry he spat on with pleasure while looking at him in the eye
so many hoes in this comment section .
Being a host is such a great job
don't skip leg day kids
I cannot stop staring at his arms!
i'd eat that pastry just saying
He is just air and water. Withour shirt he have any muscle
I've never been more jealous of James as I an right now
i want him do the thing for me too
BUFF!!!!
He can do the thing with me.
This wasn't something I ever asked for but am weirdly content with having
DAMN!!!! When did Nick get so duff???
Is this Nick Jonas I know from Disney Channel? wtf look at his arms jeezus
Everyone's here for Nick's arms but I'm just here because of my hopeless romance for James. ❤
I'm definitely gonna eat it more.
When did this kid get so huge?\nMirin
holy shit the last time i saw him he was a slim dude, now he's jacked af wtf is he on steroid or some other shit?
Am I the only one who thinks Nick Jonas looks like a sexier Josh Groban?
Nick Jonas is bae... love him 😍😍😍
GOD DAMN, LOOK AT ALL THE GIRLS HERE with wet panties, touching themselves over jick nonas.\nThey all want to become pregnant by him.

When u think yourself as a gymnast then u see Nile 😂  \nNile is my fav youtuber
Will you actually just go out with me?
these videos bring back so many memories of my younger days when i did some gymnastics. mostly what i remember though, is that the gym always smelled like ass....lol
shoula put your balls in his hands
Have you taken ballet?  You might investigate it, if not.  Bram Verhofstad moves like one, seems to actually slow time when he moves, it's thrilling to watch.  Somewhat like football player Lynn Swann, who was also a ballet student.  Your talent is so amazing, but it doesn't draw the eye in the same way.  Your movement could be not just thrilling, but breath-catchingly beautiful.
There's a pic of u in my gymnastics hall
Why the fuck is this always on trending ?
Nice fun and games but when it's on its on, keep rocking you guys great channel !
You guys are so lucky, I have always loved gymnastics but for the past couple of years I haven't been able to do any because the nearest gym with a men's team is several hours away, and the closest gym is an all girls one that I could walk to if I wanted. The pain is real
U even a champion?
Any small youtubers wanna support each other
I do gymnastics and you and the British team are such an inspiration to me
i train at this training centre it's so cool knowing that you go there too!!💗🤸🏼‍♀️🤸🏼‍♀️
I'm in love with the new editing
Why is it every video is on trending but you haven't got at least 1M subscribers?
i love this style of editing, good job! @00:54
It is great to see that you are well Nile and training hard for the competition, I'm sure this effort will be rewarded. Hugs man
We LOVE you here in Atlanta, Nile. You're infectiously chiper and lovable. congrats on the champiionship and good luck in Canada.
loved this vid mate!! Keep up the good grind boy 😎💖💯
Wilson is literally the best gymnastics male human being 👏👏👏
Anyone else just on here to look at fit men in shorts 😂
You're nipples are so small it's cute.
Trying to study Pharmacology and end here... XD \nLove you Nile!
I love u soooo much do u like Chris brown cause I loveee himmmm
I like how they play around and prank each other without being mean about it, like they stopped Nile from actually licking the lotion they put on his hand lol. They seem like nice friends.
Every video this guy uploads goes on trending page
Are you all picking on our Scottish commonwealth champion there? Just as well my mum doesn't watch you tube! She loves both Daniels!!
Be blindfolded and go through a obstacle course
Who here just to see his abs.No homo.
If I would have know that gymnastics is a bunch of hot-shirtless guys goofing off with one another, I would have joined when I was a kid.  To be young again!  You guys really seem to have fun.  Alright, I would not be piercing my ears, but the other stuff was great.\nbye\nBrennan
All of their accents XD
I should be doing my homework right now, but here I am.
Did anyone see his coaches smile get a little bigger when he started talking about the competition ❤️
In the challenge video you did with people on squad you never explained what the meaning of spinal and schmeagle was...?
jajajaja minute 0:37 jajaja wow sexy and hot and minute 2:01 his scream of very very woman jajaja
I love watching your videos and your edits are lit 🔥🔥😍😍
He's blowing up!!! One day I will get 100 subs and then blow up and laugh at myself
why is Nile single...well in his own words I can't find the hole  ;)  Great Video!
My mum said I went there and I came first in that competition like you did and got a big gold medal to
Your edits are definitely getting better!
Boo.  I really wanted to see them try to flip around blind folded...
Nile there's a picture on the wall at my school
And I know James hall he used to be my coach !!!!
Hi nile I am coming to lilishore or how ever you spell it with my coach because he is in a gym corse to the home of British gymnastics and I can't wait it's a corse or double backs have any pointers I hope you reply xox
I really like how your hair looks not styled like in the beginning of the video, not that I don't love it styled but I think you should leave it natural sometimes!!
hey nile i absolutely love yor videos i do gymnastics myself but you inspire me and i just want to say thank you you are just awesome
Love ur videos mate! Keep up the great work!

WOOOOW :0
You are perfect!!!!
hey nile do you think it's too late to start gymnastics at the age of nearly 15??\n\nEDIT: DAYUM 28 ON TRENDING LETS GO
I really want to do gymnastics but I have never done it before. I'm nearly 18 and feel like I won't be good enough to start gymnastics now. I'm not in the best of shape either. I know they do adult gymnastics by me at lillenshall but I feel like I won't be good enough or fit enough. Do yo have any advice or should I think Of something else to do.
That redhaired gymnast is FINE!\nI hope he didn't hurt his foot...
R u going to the next commonwealth games If so I might see u there cause I'm going there great vid!!!
Nile , is there any way you could make a video giving advice to gymnasts like me who are finding it hard to resist quitting gymnastics and can't find much of a reason to stay in the sport :// I love the sport and couldn't imagine my life without it but I don't know wether to quit
How tall are you? Nile
why not do the safer things with the blindfold. like handstand. swinging on the bar/rings with the foam blocks under it. or a blindfolded handstand walk race. with things on the side so you know you are going the right way.
ETA on restocking train smart t shirt?
Is coach Dave any good at gymnastics? You should do a video of you putting him through his paces 😁
Loving your video's Nile! They inspire me and put a smile on my face :) Was just wondering when the men's train smart, keep it real t-shirts will be back in stock? X
Have you ever tried the carmona on rings?
Hi Nile, I did gymnastics when I was younger but i was never flexible enough to advance to a higher level. It got to the point where my coach told my parents that they would have better luck spending their money elsewhere. I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?
Hey do you twist both ways in training or competitions? Im really only able to twist one way, kind of frustrating id like to see your take on it
sorry thumbs down cuz clickbait\nand not going through with it
Is he Scottish?
Nile do you ever go to tramp parks or are they too dangerous (or you don't have time)for a professional athlete? You guys could literally bounce off the walls there!
Were you using a cup as a blindfold???
You know what I'm so done with.. YouTube  clickbait
People are so hurt that a Muslim is trending lmao \nPoor snowflakes

Click bait
Wonder why this is trending... hmmm

Does Sid speak Punjabi or Urdu?

why the fuck are you watching this... go outside and live your life
Yo why are you wearing a hood?
Nice,  promoting a symbol of oppression for the whole world to see.

Can you vlog your next terrorist attack? Fucking Muslim
Why does she have a curtain wrapped around her head?!
You're that far up your own arse your turning brown......
And this is trending?Yawn.
Why am I here? Why is this trending?
Muslims are not British simple.
Your allah doesn't and has never existed, and your precious prophet muhammad (*piss be upon him*), held up by islam as a shining example of a perfect human being that all should aspire to emulate, was in reality an *illiterate, warmongering pedophile* that has left the world with a legacy of *systematic genocide, generational incest and atrocious intolerance towards other cultures,* now fallaciously described by so many today as a religion of peace.
Oh god a muslim no thank s
Your bomb didnt work properly, stop trying to kill my people please.
Are you the one who put that bomb on the tube in London?
Why are you wearing a form of oppression on your head

RIP Harry Dean Stanton, One of the best actors ever.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton! \nOne of the best :(
Just saw this movie for the first time. If I knew how good it was, I would've watched it a long time ago.
A character actor who often outshined the star actors. Without Harry Dean Stanton Repo Man wouldn't be as memorable. RIP
Rest in peace, Harry Dean Stanton!
I was in college saw this movie almost every day \nHDS-RIP
0:16  My drive to work
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Harry Dean Stanton was one badass actor!  Godspeed brother!
later days harry.......
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
Just adding my remembrance of Harry Dean Stanton in this essential clip for him from the movie we should thank him most for making, the most GenX cult film, one of the most essential films of the 1980s, and one of the best cinematic depictions of LA ever.\n\nAlways in small roles in so many '80s films that I enjoyed or remembered when I was young. Always added to those films in some way, as the late Roger Ebert noted, even if there wasn't much to add to.\n\nI was pleased to read that he actually kept at it until his death ... I hadn't seen anything with him in it since Anger Management and almost didn't recognize him there because of the makeup (but his voice was one of a kind).\n\nIf you want to see him in a more central role, to see him really show his range, I heartily recommend Paris, Texas. Long but good, from an actor's standpoint.
Damn a lot of comments. Shame people have to die for their work to be recognized......
Cool Hand Luke  Kellys Heros any movie Harry was in was better for havin him in it . .  .RIP Harry
When I was a kid--- AKA adolescent punk wannabe in the '80s--- I wanted to be the old guy.\nI'm middle-aged now (a bad look for a punk), and I still do.\nNo character actor ever OWNED a movie like Harry Dean Stanton. Rest in peace, hangdog; see ya in the Big Parking Lot in the Sky....
RIP Harry Dean\nyou made this movie so great
Harry Dean Stanton, genius character actor who broke through to the lead role in Paris Texas
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. You attained Legend Status. Good on you.
Rest in Peace, Mr. Stanton.  :*(
RIP Harry Dean Stanton. Life of a repo man is always intense.
1:07 code , 1:43 tense situations ,
RIP Harry!
Only an a$$hole gets killed for a car
Rip Mr Stanton
RIP Harry Dean Stanton
RIP HDS
RIP, Harry Dean.
RIP HDS
RIP Harry.  Your greatest role ever IMHO
RIP HDS
RIP BUD!
R.I.P. Bud
RIP HARRY.
RIP Harry Dean Stanton \n\nProper legend
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton.
R.I.P. Harry Dean Stanton...
Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate 'em.
RIP  Harry Dean Stanton
Saint Harry
RIP Harry Dean Stanton.
Yet, despite his disheveled appearance, you get the sense that Bud has a compassionate side to him and, deep-down, he wants to do something meaningful with his life. So he tries teaching Otto all about the repo man trade as fast as possible and, later, dies while trying to get the box. And even Otto comes around to feeling a kinship with Bud at the end by pleading with him, Only an asshole gets killed for a car! This is what makes 'Repo Man' such a great movie--the characters are interesting and you care what happens to them.
love this film, every teen should see it
1:34 Hey. Look at that. Look at those assholes over there. Ordinary fuckin' people. I hate'm.
Harry Dean Rulz
Suddenly, Auto gets interested when his mentor mentions the consumption of speed as one of the perks to his new job!
Have a nice day\nNight\nNight, day, it doesn't mean shit to me
Come on dickhead!
this film is incredible!  it's a monster mix of laughs and humor
Now humans do not have to snort the powder, they only need prescriptions from the medical industries.
Otto.. he seems to rise above his friends, who are going in the other direction, committing acts of armed robbery.. Repoman, has a code.
I could go for a couple cans of drink right about now.
Harry is such a machine.  Repo Man is a cult classic and that is great dialouge but his delivery makes it even better.
1:35 Ordinary People.....
Speed huh??
Ordinary fuckin' people - I hate 'em.
'movieclips' just for when you thought life had ripped you off enough
this movie is about farting in a market
Tense situations, kid....
The subtitles on your clips are extremely annoying.
THats asimov
It's a child. There is no place for hatred here.\n\n\nYou people are disgusting.
Too bad the baby's half a nigger
Who was clicking like it was Snapchat
Such a great video!!
I loved where you guys put Grand Slam Titles: 1! Congratulations to both of you! She is absolutely beautiful! 💖
Wow, these people are really full of themselves.
Fun fact: people in the comments being edgy fools, saying stuff like the n word or don't race mix. You should mind your own business and not comment on things. Because at the end of the day you just look like a needy child.
So beautiful just like her mum

Beautiful. \nDon't let the racists get to you. We all know there's a lot of adults out there that still have some growing up to do.
What's the problem with race mixing? Like any of us are a 100 percent one race anyway. Just do a simple ancestry DNA test, and your results might surprise you. All the racists in the comments could be 20% of the race the they hate, and they'd never know 🤷🏾‍♀️
I don't consider myself politically correct, but even I can see this planet has reached a sick, sick state when even a newborn baby can't be protected from racism. I feel so helpless that I can't stop these goddam hate comments. I hope she never sees them one day.
Congrats to you and your family new member 😍😂😎😇👶
I don't understand why there is hate because of a baby being born. So what if two different races want to have a child I mean it's not your child so screw off with your opinions and nonsense. Congrats by the way.
Hahahahaha men can't have babies!! Lying to the world. Salvation is coming, he's the only one who gives children and I bet he didn't give you any! Liars and their moon bumps hahahahaha
100 % fake. Sir Rena is a man.
I'm surprised it didn't come out with a penis considering how much anabolics the momma monkey does.
Aww... this is a really sweet video. Congrats.
Awww....I'm so happy for them!!!
I bet $20 that is is just some type of 4chan raid.
While playing the videos YouTube is not working\nGive me any suggestions
This is such a cute video :)
The white race slowly disappearing....\nGood....goooood....\nAll according to plan

Aww she's adorable!!!😱Welcome to the world little Alexis!❤️
What a beautiful understated video of your memories, thank you for sharing it is lovely to watch someone as awesome as you and your partner take delight in same simple things every parent does ie dad always takes credit for building cot lol....after the mum has put it on his list and yep we have all practiced swaddling dog/cat at least yours was size appropriate mine was a Lassie sized dog, a bed sheet did the job. I can guarantee you will look at it over years and all emotions will hit you and tears will flow in a good way. Congratulations only advice sleep when baby sleeps and if someone offers to watch/hold her when at home take chance to get bath/shower in peace and it is guests job to make tea/coffee not yours. Enjoy as time will fly past :) x
the vertical video gave me cancer
Congratulatiobs guys on your new born baby.
Welcome to this world Alexis! We share the same birthday! ❤️
Why do Italians put they're trash in clear trash bags?\n\n\nSo Puerto Rican's can go window shopping.
most beautiful couple and baby i cry. i cryin
So you call them your name? Really? That's almost a disgrace.
As someone who is mixed I am actually shocked some people in the comments can be this ignorent
Can someone please tell me why this video has so many views?
If she is a feminist...
I'm just gonna watch it again
There is officially more comments saying stop being racist than ones that are racist
Before you go down the comments any further I just want you to know that there's a lot of good white people in this world just like there's good blacks Mexicans and etc don't let these people ruin your image on the white race
This isn't my fucking bag Get the fuck out of here
Olympia? Arnold? Ronnie?
Dirty fucking race mixer
Grossssssssssss

Lmao the reddit cuck image for this video.

What a beautiful newborn! Good bless ❤️
Beautiful family! Congrats!!

Based Race Mixing
I Love this love

Omg shes perfect 😍😍😍
Ok?
Catergory: Science and Technology
Hi
Irma gerd.
Congratulations!
Why is this trending?
This is fucking beautiful life being created, happiness existing, but why do y'all got to be so damn fucking aggressive damn like is there any actual reason to hate besides the fact that you want attention, or to troll, or because you were raised to see this as wrong, every one dislikes something but there's no need to be aggressive about it and blowing up the comment section doesn't help when the comment you make has been stated fifteen times already
Ew, race mixing.
N I G G E R
Omg idk you guys but this is the sweetest video ever. You can see the love between them. Happy for them❣️ what a beautiful couple💗💗
Congratulations Serena and Alexis on your bundle of joy.. She is beautiful.. Can't wait to see your wedding
White and blacks can have kids together. What's up with that? It's not wrong
Mixed breed, I suggest you take it out and kill it.
This had thumbnail of reddit...has nothing to do with reddit *DISLIKES*
Cuck
Well..the baby has 2 dads
Race mixing propaganda
I'm seeing a bunch of comments about racist comments but I'm not seeing any racist comments rn
Darkness everywhere...
Nigger
Is that Serena Williams?
One question.........Who are these people? (No offense i don't have socail media)
How could you make a baby with her? I mean, she is famous yes, but ugly af.
Race mixed
Why tf does the thumbnail have Reddit people on it
I'm not getting what the big deal is here.  Are not 95% of couples equally ecstatic about their pregnancy?  Are either of these parents-to-be celebrities?  If so, how?  What exactly is the hullabaloo about this couple?
For Christmas what should I get this or the Death Star
Most will buy and never open it, investment
I'd just like to say I noticed and appreciated the camera motion during the time lapse
As a guy who's not into Lego, but really into the falcon, I can say that the old one has a much better shape. The new one is way too flat and the cockpit and radar dish look too small.\n\n\nNow Adam, it is time to build and review the bandai perfect grade falcon!!!!
Wow, great video!  Any estimates on how long it would take one or two people to build this?
800 smackers. might take a month to build so it's great intertainment.  Sucks you can't pick it up
Adam shouldn't throw the box and stickers around like they're worthless
Where would you even put something like that? its too big for a shelf
Death to Chihuahua’s!!!
These are over $1000 on Ebay Australia lol. At first I was like looks meh as I'm not a huge fan of Lego but this was pretty amazing. What really stands out to me is how stringent Lego's quality control must be to get every single piece into this set (maybe they ship spare pieces in it?). But damn that was crazy!
Why are you wearing a hat indoors?

When he said tons of minifigs 😂
Lego produced 20,000 sets, twice as many as 10179's 10,000. 75192 has sold out Lego's entire worldwide stock on 14th September's first day of launch just to VIP members only😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
the guy in the pong shirt. i swear, he looks like Alex Lifeson
The old one is better.\nThey just want to sell lego
Just wait for Lepin to make their knockoff and get it for $200 instead lol
So, it's was a 12 hour build. \nBut with the variable number of builders, how many man-hours were spent?
So ladies....are these guys making you hot and horny!!!
wasnt the original one 400 hundred dollars?
I got the $120 Falcon.😐
WOW! Simply INSANE but I LOVE IT! Thank you so much for this video! Well done! Again, WOW!

The sad part about this set is that it's $800! Gotta start saving
I love this channel so much.
Ordered this and Slave 1
I can't wait to modify this one! \nFinish the interior.
i can do it in less then  10 hours
Great now I have to sell my car to be able to afford it
Ugh...why did they decorate the white boxes? I'm going to have to hold on to those too...
WOW <3
neat : )
eight.... hundred.... ....dollars.
Tons of minifigs
Jordan Schlansky
Happy knolling.
Bought my LEGO Falcon yesterday🙌
Congrats on trending
No swooshing around? Fuck that
Magic video!
You guys deserve more subscribers
this or iphone X
12:55 it’s “Tom Sawyered” smh
Nice
CHALLENGE!
Simply because all the bends and wrinkles you put on the box and manual
If only I had the money to buy it..
I'm not marmalade but I sure am jelly. Such an epic set.
Now wait for the UCS Star Destroyer (On the Falcon box a silhouette of a Star Destroyer, on last years Death Star it had a silhouette of the Falcon)
Anyone know the name of that art style on the small poster on the right wall? It reminds me of Habbo!
Due to it being a 1:1 scale to minifig, I'm curious how big would the Star Destroyer be? Or the Death star?
I want one so bad now!
Now that's what I call Lego! ^^ The whole squad has formed for this special moment.
10 professional model builders 12 hours, that's 120 hours. I wonder how long it would take for one nonprofessional to it?
shame they did a time lapse i would've watched the whole thing
Anyone else thinking, in the early moments, protect the sticker sheet, protect the sticker sheet !
concentrate all fire on the millenium falcon !
I'm still sitting waiting here for the UCS venator class star destroyer
I think the 1999 Millennium Falcon (which I own) is the real holy grain of Falcons, even the UCS ones
You can get for a cheap price of $800!
A huge box of SNOT...
But.. can you put your thermal coupler in the hyperdrive
came here to see the lego millennium falcon and fell into nerdtopia/ nerdvanna. some people are in geekstacy over this. 4 pairs of horned rimmed glasses and not one with a taped up bridge. deep nerdalysis of legos. okay time for a soda and ramen noodles. have you seen my pen caddy and compass? ...................................have a nice day!
I wish I had an income that would let me buy this set :(
Glad i have the old one..sort of
I made a dildo out of legos and a washable lego condom
I cant wait for JangBricks to get his hands on this
I build a MOC of the LEGO Store Millennium Falcon Presale :)
That wasn't a review
its the team that built the millenium falcon in less than 12 hours
For a cheap price of 850€ in the Euro area!
DAMN I wish that I was one of them
what is adam savage's hat?
The millennium falcon is just a cash grab
Never knew lego's would be on trending
They'll have to build the Bandai perfect grade falcon now
need a new show:smash my lego. after they build it they need to take it to the roof and drop it
Soo wish I could have, and build that, and that last part of the time lapse where you put the top on was just so gorgeous.
I built this when I was younger, took me a couple months. Had to sell it and my whole collection when I enlisted, cool to see other people appreciate t
I'd love to see a video on how you guys got those amazing time lapse tracking shots. What kind of rig did you use for that?
NOPE! I cant watch this!!!! my kryptonite!  I must be responsible with my money!!!!
All nerds of the universe. UNITE!!
I low key like the old
Just imagine if they both fell over and the pieces got mixed up...
Awesome build
Loving your lego builds, keep them coming ;)
Wows Is can'ts imagines hows muchs moneys alls thoses LEGOS ares goings tos costs ... 😕
What a dream!
800$ :(
$800
have ya seen this 11k piece moc? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5XcVgqoUbM
$900 Woooow.
Y'all (naysayers in the comments) always complain about VR being expensive,  but you are impressed by this $800 thing that just sits there?
We have no idea what's in the box.\nEnds up looking almost exactly the same.
is that adam from myth busters
No square radar dish.  Controversial?
I can buy iphone x with this -_-
Sad. Men?
norm is a lego weapon

E-6LUtmwymo,6:30 who else straight away starting singing mercy in their heads 😂 whenever he sings it that's all I'll think of now 😂"
OML he's to cute😭❤️😍
Sjsjs Johnny Orlando
The reason why I started guitar was because of there's nothing holdin me back and when I heard he started because of ed sheeran I screamed lmao
I'm wondering how long he can stay this humble.
I think he was talking about Johnny Orlando😂
I feel like the dude who has 80 million views for a parody of stitches might be Bart Baker....
I love Shawn so much😍😍😘😘❤❤
No one is better looking than Shawn Mendes. Also can we talk about how adorable he is when he tells stories? 💘
my poor baby 😭😂😂 i’m so proud of you babe! 💗
We love a successful bottom.
I'm smiling from ear to ear, he's so cute!
Did anyone else see his new tattoo on his finger. It's an elephant and his mom has the same one. I love it :) ❤
The comment section is full of whaaaamen, and I came to get me some  😏
The video of the kid who reenacted stitches is Johnny Orlando
the sound effect he made when he jerked his arm 😂😂😂
who's the guy who did that cover thingy
I went to his Portland concert and he was AMAZING!!!! I even made a video about my experience. Y'all should check it out 😊.
bring rich chigga to the show
I'm simple,. I see shawn , I clicked.
I was at the show in Brooklyn. If you want to see the video press my picture
the first song I learnt  on guitar was I know what you did last summer
For the first time in a long time it seems to me that Jimmy is actually really into the person he's interviewing, usually he seems like he's just doing the job he's supposed to do so he can get it over with and move on but with Shawn he seems legit interested in who he is and what he's doing.. anybody else got this feeling? :D
I'm not even a fan of his and while listening to him speak it took me a while to realize I was subtly smiling at my screen like an idiot
I love how he determinedly pretends Magcon never happened
Johnny Orlando
Power bottom vibes 😩😩
Jesus loves you
Aweee poor Shawn
Bless him😂😭
That's my boyyyyy
Shawn mendes is daddy
HEY SHAWN PLEASE COME TO MALAYSIA ANG I WANNA SEE YOU LIVE HERE>>>>>I LOVE YOU BABY<<<<<
if you look very closely you can see his new tattoo of an elephant on his left hand middle finger 😍
He talked about Johnnnn... I'm a proud fan.👍🤘❤️
It's so amazing that although Shawn is popular he is still simple #1fan
The kid that reenacted the stitches music video was Johnny Orlando 😂
2:22 johnny my baby
Shawn is the most generous person! I love him so much. ❤️ Thank you Jimmy for having him at the show :)
Shout out to Drake's Security Guard :)
That's my boy ♥️
I was dying of laughter
Now I want Shawn and Ed Collab to Happen 😭❤
At the moment I clicked ok this video TNHMB started playing on the radio
Hmm he is almost as pale as me
I don't understand, so who is the one who covered stitches?
Did anyone else katch that part where he said drake should of remembered him by the person experiments with him like twice? Meaning drake did some gay shit to Mendez everyone 😂😂
HAHAH HE IS SO CUTE AND FUNNY AND PERFECT AND I JUST LOVE HIM SO MUCH
He's such a babe😍
he's so handsome and adorable, i love him. <3
This guy is a grade A creep. Hes all like a farty man and stuff pooping around all the places. Poo poo pee pee. I mean am i right or am i riiiiiiiiigghgghhhhttttt!
If you're here for the title it's at 5:30
Even his voice when he's just talking is perfect.
he's so humble omg i love him so much (':
Was he talking about johnny orlando 😂
he's so hot
this guy must really have a tough job.. looks like hes forcing it too much to look like hes enjoying talking to this guy
ugh he is so cute. That story made me love him even more
Can you bring Rihanna on the show? She has had a career for over 10 years +++ and hasn´t been on yet!!
With the Boy who did stiches better
How did he not know it was Shawn tho 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Which video is he talking about ?
he's so beautiful 😩💜
The moral lesson in that is Don't expect everybody to know who you are. Hahahaha cutiee
Come on Shawn you know what you could've done\n\nPlease have mercy on meee
When Shawn said he did something in Brooklyn, and I live there, and I WASNT THERE😂😂😂
So proud of Shawn ❤️
He's so chill he's awesome
Mendes Army?? 💙

The 203 dislikes are all people who are scared of clowns.
LOVE IT totally doing this
Hey mykie you should do the old Taylor swift zombie and the new Taylor swift for Halloween! 👻 idk just a suggestion! Love this it glammed up penny wise!
I saw the movie a few days ago... it's sooooo good!!!!
5:19. Is that a threat.
Shouldn't be watching this at 2 am
Omg I love this!!! I'm dying for a full tutorial with prosthetics and his giant teeth!! Girl if anybody can do it glam and gore can! Only trust you lol
i am Stephen king obviously.
Hi glam and Gore can you do dove Cameron style
I just love her, I wish there were more of her in the world
She DID that!  She made it look like she put so little effort into it (we know better). And,  she was having fun while applying the makeup. She made me laugh kinda loud. Frigging awesome! 😂
Duuude IT is my favorite movie of all time now not even joking
Laughed so hard at Alexa being nosy \nGonna try this for a Halloween club party!!
Doing this for Halloween super excited!!
Holy shit this was amazing🎈👌🏼
Who was like ok the movie was ok but it wasn't AMAZING
can you do some twists on urban legends for this halloween?? i think that'd be pretty cool just sayin..
I have a fear of clown and I was made to go to the theatre to see it :/
I want to do this for Halloween
You look like a really really twisted Cheryl Blossom....\nJust saying, but it's awesome ❤❤
What mix is your dog?
I literally turn my phone all the way off once she said glitter but it was red instead of green thank god but im still scared🤤🤤🤤😨😨😨😱 you still look fabulous as always YASSSS SLAY MYKIE 😍😍😍
A channel named Nikolas avacado or something has a sloth btw
You look so much like Dove Cameron btw great tutorial 🎈💋👑
LOVE IT! HEHEHE 💄🤡😍🎈 You are so makeup amazing!!!
'The original tv mini series' 😰 aka book
OMMMG I SWEAR TO GOD SHE WAS THE COSTUME CREATOR OF PENNYWISE!
I just went to see it today and it was more funny than scary
so cool like all of your vidios
I absolutely adore these more extreme makeup looks! I think you would do a really amazing job at doing ghoul makeup from the Fallout games!!
+Glam&Gore I already wear corrective contacts will my natural color work fine
I just saw IT lol
I need those teeth where do I get them
I know what I'm gonna be wearing next time I go clubbing...
Who cares if a million other people do it we want YOUR VERSION of it !!! We love you ❤️❤️❤️
Do the phantom of the opera
Do mileena from mortal combat and kitana and jade in one totural
you know Mykie i love ya and your channel, but no i dont do clowns....lol
I didn't see it in the description box, but Mykie, Where did you get that ginger wig!!?? I need that in my life.
I was at a pride festival and someone lost there balloon. It was red. XD
what kind of pupper is that?
You should use your sfx genius to turn yourself into ripely so you two can be glamorous twins
Can you please do a tutorial of a gypsy makeup with the same technique as your master max tutorial?
I love watching your videos and think you should do a dead hogwarts student (Harry Potter) with a wand through their head or a quidditch player with a broom stuck in them or half a golden snitch in the head ( I love Harry Potter and you and your videos and think 'IT' would be a great combo) \n\nP.S: I love watching you all the time and 'IT' would be awesome if you did my suggestions and if you commented back.\n\nLove,\nYour zombæ ❤️xxx
You could float to
Yayaya I'm be this it fits perfect cos I'm a ginger
Hey mykie where did you get the contacts
Hi Mykie! You probably don't watch the 100, but could you do an Octavia Blake costume and Makeup tutorial? Specifically her war makeup. Thank you!
I was very happy with the movie. Also this would be so cute for Halloween because it's simple but also glam and gore at the same time so it's the best of both worlds
Now THIS is the quality shit I subscribed for
I've watched the new IT twice now just to try and make myself less scared by it
TV mini series? I thought there was just the movie from 1990
I now know what I'm gonna be for Halloween!! 😄😂
I thought the scary clown thing was over.\n\n\nOh well.\n\n\nIt's awesome anyway.
Will you do a makeup tutorial for Caveira from Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege please??
This is epic. And it was an epic film.
I LOVE YOU
I love you
Loved this shit!
did i hear Mykie curse oOoooOh
Aaaaaah no! No glitter!
This is amazing
This is great

It would be cool if mykie did a Catwoman tutorial
Can you please continue your princess series your last video was a year ago :(( btw this look was so good i enjoyed it
I have been waiting for this for such a long time --- I love this and HIGHKEY cannot wait for Halloween fun time
Sorry, but the only one who's done IT is the Babadook
I just saw IT yesterday, it was such a good movie, I was blown away!!
We all float down here
I was about to click on it and I was like I bet she's going to jump scare me *clicks on video * 0:03 OH SHIT!
I don't understand how she still looks adorable.
With your regular blue hair and the clown makeup you looked like Evan Peters' character from AHS
Where did she get the teeth?
Please do a ghost rider victim makeup tutorial! I commented on one of your older vids but this is a great idea! Like the victim after the Penace Stare. Or do ghost rider. OR BOTH!!! ❤️❤️ @Glam&Gore
Mikey should do a DreamWorks series and do Jack Frost as a girl and he froze half of his face
I look forward for Halloween because I know that's mykies time to SHINE✨
I don't mind a blow job
I saw this yesterday
Intros always give me friggin nightmares
NO BLOOPERS???
I LOVE YOURE DOG!!!!!

I'm honestly starting to think this was just a bunch of kids lighting shit on fire on the train.
I don't think the main objective of the  bomb was to hurt people if they wanted to they could have done it way better
This is some Blacklist type shit
Why is it happening to us Brits?  What did the world do to make it un safe for innocent people to get to work/other places and get attacked?
Terrorist attack? Time for the left to blame trump for ALL of his tweets.
so many alleged terrorist attacks and none is solved. That shows how fragile The U.K. is. This looks like fire drill emergency response exercise.
Just resign Theresa May you make your country worst stupid PM
Fear-mongering and it's part of living in a big city. Can you guest the idiots whom said this?\nHint: Ones a over used tea bag
*Look out dudes! Religion of blast you to pieces.....i mean, very very peaceful, coming through!*
What's to investigate? It's the damn muslims once again. The Religion of pieces.
All in the name of acceptance and equality
Colonial rule.
Magic video!
How do we know they are Muslim?
Where was David Duke? \n\n🤔
They will magically find a passport or know where he is hiding
This alleged terror attack is a FAKE STAGED HOAX DRILL committed by the Government & reported by the corrupt complicit mainstream media as a real event. Crisis actors used as victims & eye witnesses. ALL terror attacks in UK have been staged by the UK Government, used to implement new laws to remove your freedom & privacy, to instill fear, divide people & now they're going after free speech via censorship of the internet. Government trying to shut up anyone that goes against their bullshit lies & actions. The Government are the terrorist using psychological terrorism against it's own people.
I'm all for a safe homeland, but what a crock of shit from the parliament/media. This is probably one of the laziest attempts I've ever seen. That being said I'm glad everyone is okay.
No life threatening injuries just like your natural disasters blueye british pigs. Is it the snap crackle pop navy or is it in concert with the USA military?
No worries, only liberal loving Brits hurt, you know the ones that love the terrorists to death and want more in. Just do the usual candle vigils, holding signs of peace, toleranance, and hug it out like usual and move on already. We're just waiting for the next one to happen as usual. Like having a bad cold and wondering why it isn't being cured because you keep taking in antibiotics.
Kick them all out!!!! How many more?!
I am hoping that the world will come to realize that Islam is not a religion but a Demonic Cult of War, Conquest and Deceit. Islam and Muslims need to be kicked out of Europe AGAIN.
EVERY sharia-law-lover is a soon to be terrorist. KILL them all.
Let me help you guys solving this case. Whoever did this was not a Boy Scout, nor a Japanese tourist, nor a Buddhist monk, nor a polish immigrant, nor a born again Christian, nor a vegetarian... I hope I have helped some.
According to liberals: There are no terrorist...
Sadik Kahn orders you to get used to it!\nYou deserve such a mayor!
Damn London is way to dangerous
Officials will wring their hands and write a sternly worded email  to ISIS.  Instead they should pull the hate spewing imams out of the mosques by their scraggly beards and deport!!!
Why are these attacks happening? The UK did not abduct Muslims into the UK, as Americans did to Africans. Muslims themselves wanted to live in the UK, probably because they thought the UK was a better place to live than their Muslim country, and the UK welcomed them and provided them place to live.\n\nShouldn't the UK be their second motherland, if not the first? Why attack the nation that helped them? If they want the UK to become more like their original Muslim country, why not go back there? Then, they can have the strict Muslim way of living without terrorism.
need more migrants to England. this is god's way of punishing England for the many sins of the Beattles !   gods wrath us upon England for the Beattles satanic music clearly heard , satan is god  when played backwards at 45 rpm !!!!
These goat fuckers can't even create a proper bomb 😂
I live in the uk and its so sad how people find out the news and just say aw its just another terror attack like its normal
Calling any Muslim Muslim is too flattering for that word means to submit to God. That's an insult to God himself. I prefer to call them Mohammedan.
the bomb might just be a lure.. and the person who made the bomb built it to not fully explode,to fail.
It was the British government that supported the terrorists in Syria ... This is the result of their support😡😡😡😡
Lol police won't investigate anything, because this whole hoax was staged with their complacency.
It's a gallon bucket and a tiny fire, fucking incompetent terrorist but how were people even injured? Either way the device seems more or less intact so good for forensics.
Kick all the brown people out of Britain. Or kill them.
Another terrorist attack the world is going to forget within 48h. A world ran by retards.
You know the smell of burning *FLESH*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe police are coming so I have to go now 3:42
Radical islamic terrorism a culture in UK
According to Sadiq Khan, Muslim mayor of London, this is just everyday life in a big city. True. A big city in some Islamic shithole country teeming with subhuman, stinking, violent Muslims. I remember a family vacation to London in the early 1970s. Then it was actually full of courteous, civilized white Britons. I was there a second time again early this summer, and large parts of it are so rancid and violent with Muslims those areas should be leveled, the Muslims repatriated to whatever Islamic death cult cesspool they crawled out of, and the areas vacated populated by white Britons once again.
Europe & UK government just don't understand this is just the beginning so why don't y'all bring in more unvetted immigrants !!!
i can't believe josh johnson bombed the subway!
Just shows the stupidity of modern day humans. Yeah lets go up and stare through the window at the flaming improvised explosive.
Ohhh, that woman's legs are burned so badly 😣. She must be in so much pain, her skin is just peeling off completely 😟. I hope that she and all others injured are able to recover okay.
Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslim.
Women need to be taken out of politics
God, how terrible, when will this insanity end??\nIt would seem that no one is safe, anywhere. No words. Thank God no lives were lost...
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
Part & parcel, y'all. Just part & parcel
Okay abc news since cnn is not reporting YOU'RE taking the hit. Now US military blow up civilians overseas but is not reported. There are numerous REAL terrorist attacks that go unreported. Sheeple claim they need evidence to prove that these are psyops but I need evidence to prove that it was real other than reporters saying so fake witnesses and police and emts everywhere. Now you can fool millions but I know that this is another psyop to invoke fear and control. I don't care about responses because this message is for abc.
In my opinion every available resource on earth should be used to exterminate all radical Muslim terrorists.
Since the beginning of Islam everywhere in the world that Muslims have stepped foot on they have caused destruction
Fucking greenscreen on george. Hes not in london...
BRITAIN BELONGS TO WHITE PEOPLE.
Death to Chocolate Pudding faced people !
this is what happens when you disarm your citizens they dont pull these pussy attacks in the states every other week
Why was George Stephanopoulos in london?
GAS CHAMBERS TO ALL MUSLIMS!
Here we go again.
so.....how is that open door policy for Muslims working out...?
A BUCKET BOMB? WTF!
Fuvking Pakistani fucks wreaking havoc against fucking civilians again
Another day in Londondistan
Damn Buddhists - again!
I just can *not* wait to dive in to all the delightful comments! Yay, I get to learn 42 new cuss words! Oh! Is that hate on Muslims? Terrific!
Hope they are alright..
Glad no one lost lifes
Did isis  did this
nh
lol
Liberalism KILLS.\n\nFind a cure!
Was it Buddhist?
Forget about banning the burqa. Ban Islam.
OUR SPECIES ARE GETTING AWFUL EVERYDAY
Damn white Christians
Hahaha everyone talk about Muslims 😂😂😂 lool
The Muslim phobic comments are awful. How do you even know who did this? Even if it was a Muslim the majority are not like you think
Wow George got there fast
Know Muslims, No Peace.\nNo Muslims, Know Peace.
Wow in Islamic State of London? It's not Great Britain no more. Well it's ur government that allowed this.  Attacks will be imminent. Idiots.
If there was an explosion then how was the bag and bucket it was in almost fully intact and barely on fire? And why was George Stephanopoulos in London? Was he there to cover another story or did he just happen to be there today? Hmm...
White people are the real terrorists
It's the religion of peace, nothing new....
ALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR\nALAHU AKBAR
All this crap since we were dragged into a phoney war with Iraq based on Lies lies and more lies.
I doubt... it sounds like same terrorist attack like 9/11 ( INTERNAL JOB)...
Religion of peace strikes again
jewish made sunni-radical terrorism again deport all jews and sunnis now!!!
Religion of peace strikes again
The Mighty Lion of Juda...Will Eradicate Islam Forever
This comment is a controversial opinion and will start a reply war.
Your video shows picture of a plastic pale with flames burning inside but the plastic pale is intact, didn't know plastic was explosion proof. Something not quite right here.
TOTAL FUCKING ZIONIST HOAX SET UP AGAIN!
If you don't address that attacks like this are created by the whites behind the curtain, you will never ever be able to solve the issue. Addressing the root cause is the key.
Islam is to blame. If you're a Muslim and you can't recognize how false and violent your religion is, I don't want you in my country! Get out right now. We are going to start making it uncomfortable for you otherwise.
What if it was actually the kim regime???

Um. Wondering if she should be in bigger bed. Her little head seems cramped in there for fresh air. And breathing in general. Just a thought.
in most families the mother does all of this whilst the father goes to work...... you get the pleasure of being at home with your children more than most......
You should make an animation of the great catnap book on friendliest friends!
Alessia looks so much like Jonathan's family! Wow
Love you all
1:35 aahhhhh cute Alessia
Hey Jonathan! My family has a Toyota Prado and it also has a remote key. One time my boyfriend and I went to run some errands, so I put the key in my purse. He went and dropped me off at the supermarket, and left to run another errand about 40 min away. When he's on his way he calls me and tells me the car is beeping because it says there is a missing key! (I then realize I have my purse, so the key is with me! 🆘) He was way too far from me by this point, so he decides to keep going. He couldn't turn off the car when he got to his destination 😂 because with no key he wouldn't have been able to turn it back on! He then came back to pick me up, so we were good, but it was stressful! Hahahaha So basically I think it is a problem, but you can operate it 👌🏻
Why don't you have Anna pick up Eduardo with Alessia. That way you have a bigger chunk of time to do work with no distractions.
Anna´s eyebrows are wayyyyyyyyy to red 😷
Jonathan is such a great dad.❤😍
OMG the Bingo run 😂😂 and Eduardo asking for food 💗
100% guarantee all these people who are complaining of Anna doing nothing have never had a baby before 🙄
The kids are soooooo cute and I am seeing u at the tour so excited
If you drive without the keys the car starts beeping and having a breakdown! You can only drive a certain distance away from the keys as well
😂😂😂😂 seems you should have brought some food to keep Eduardo occupied! Laughed so much when he said there was food missing from the picnic! That boy loves his food!
I accidentally drove my keyless car to the supermarket. I could open the door and start the engine because the car was in such close proximity to the keys sitting on the side inside the house, and (from my experience) the car allows you drive as long as the whole time your engine is running, but the second you turn the engine off you can't restart it! I had to be rescued from the car park by my Dad with the keys haha. I wouldn't try it!
My husband always has his car keys in his pocket when we're in the car, even if I'm driving. If I'm dropping him off somewhere he often gets out of the car with the keys & I get an ignition error message on the dash & can't go anywhere! 🙄
That´s what I´m really scared of having kids, they say its amazing having kids but all of those people saying that also say they have no time for them, and I´m kind of a loner I love to step time by myself and having my own space, I am not sure if people like me were meant o have kids. I know I will regret it if I have kids at the moment, but I know I will regret it in a few years (when I´m done with myself haha) if I don´t. That´s stress for me right now!
Guys for the tour tickets does each adult an kid need one? It says under 14s must be accompanied does this mean i need to buy ticket for child?
My mum once forgot her keys Jonathan! She got stuck when she parked and the car turned off haha my dad had to pick her up
eduardo and his dad have got such a good father son relationship 😊
Eduardo is me with the picnic!! You can’t promise me a picnic and not take food 😂
What's the lipstick you put on in the beginning of this video? I like it very much!Thank you ..
This has been my favourite vlog in a long long time. It was real and sincere there was no trying it was just a good old fashioned vlog
I can imagine Jonathan to be super busy \nBut how stressful must be the life of parents who can't work from home....
Alessia's eye contact with the camera all the time is literally the cutest thing love it
I'm so in love with this family
i love you guys and your  banter
How do I make your channel not pop up.
Wouldn´t it be easier, if Anna stayed in the house on the morning school-runs and take care of the things that need to be done and than later on pick the kids from school and try to help Jonathan save some time to get his stuff done? That is no hate or anything at all, i´m just wondering, why they don´t handle it that way. Love the Saccone Jolys :)
Jonathan wait till they start joining more after school activities
cute photo of the kids. You guys make beautiful babies
this is the cutest thing <33\n\ncan you please make a christmas calender this year too? i loved the one last year, it really made it easier to wait for christmas <3
The kids are so cute!
Jonathan: what is missing ? Eduardo: food 😂😂
A lovely video I really enjoyed watching it :):) :):) Emilia, Eduardo and alessia are so cute Emilia was so adorable when she said  we have to run after Eduardo and when she got some mints out to eat 😀🐶❤️ Eduardo was so sweet when he said look grandma a lol doll and alessia looked so cute when she was smiling and looking at the camera :):) :):) \n\nAnna what you could do is give alessia a dummy for comfort x \n\nI can't wait for the calendar to come out x
the urge to have kids when i watch your videos jonathan....
that happened to my nana my granda opened the car and she drove away them when she turn the engine of she notice she didn't have the key 💗😂xxxxxx
Eduardo taking after his dad Good Morning my Friendliest Friend PRICELESS!!!
imagine if they gave Emilia the SacconeJoly yt account- Eduardo Anna’s and Alessia jonathan’s JSKDKSKSK
Can't wait to get my hands on the calendar! x
Eduardo singing to Alessia is just precious 💕💕 and a happy belated birthday to Emilia 😊😘
Love Eduardo's response to his Dad. Jonathan says What's missing to our picnic ?  Eduardo says  Food. Such a typical lovely boy.  :)
Why do you bathe Alessia every day? Her skin is going to get so dried out!
Wait. I'm sorry - Eduardo singing Good Morning Again... to Alessia JUST MADE MY OVARIES SKIP A BEAT whyyyy are your kiddos so flipping adorable 😭😭😭
I would have if I was Jonathon if I had to go through all these hurtful and bitter comments on here. Some of you people are so judgemental and nasty.
The car wont start without the keys in the car Jonathan (:
Anna you look unreal! Alessia is the cutest 😍
Whats missing? Food. \nThis is the best thing I've heard today.
What would Anna do if you had a 40 hour week 🎀job?
My mam managed to drive my dad's car without the key as she dropped him off at work and he forgot to give her the key. Luckily she remembered before switching off the engine so she managed to get back to him to collect the key!
You shouldn't let Eduardo hit you like that. Even if it's playing it's not the best idea to teach him that it's ok to play that rough. That's just my opinion as a case manager who works with kids. I have to teach sooooo many parents to stop playing that rough with kids because they do it at school since they don't understand the difference between playing at home and at school.
Jonathan: What's missing?\nEduardo: Food.\n\nLITTLE BOY KNOWS WHAT'S UP 👏😂😂😂
@sacconejolys when are you moving house?!?
When the key gets to far the car wont run, my dad will drive and sometimes drop my mom off places and the keys are still in her purse so he cant drive away
Going on the bingo run 😂😂
Can not wait for the 2018 calendar my mom and I have gotten one for each of us both past years  💗 now we get one with Alessia 💗
I have driven my car without having my keys. My husband started my car to warm up a bit (winter time) and he didn't leave the keys in the car. Then once I arrived at my destination I realized I didn't have my key to lock the doors. So he had to drive to me with my keys 😳🙄🤣😂
Jonathan you do an awesome job vlogging every day and make the vlogs funnier as you can get them!!!!...I reallly appreciate you for letting us come into your home!!!....Thank You Guys!!!!!!
Can't wait for the bingo runs lol 😂
Jonathan the car won't start if the key isn't in it - like somewhere in the car
go to mummy and flick her ear!!...... goes to mum and hugs her! GAWD EDUARDO IS SO CUTE <3
Jonathan knows the lyrics to California Love better than I do. And I live in California and love Tupac. Lol. Go Jonathan
Anyone know when they are coming to Ireland for a meet up x
Eduardo is a crazy lil kid haha throwing the blanket he was sitting on a minute ago
Completely agreed with what you were saying at the beginning Anna! LOVE vlogging and having things like my 21st birthday on YT so I can watch them back in the future!! 💕
Hi Jonathan, the key thing happened to me😩 I left the keys in house and drove the car 10 miles away and then when I tried to restart the car that's when I realised and my partner had to drive with my keys to give me power. It's a thing, it happens.. to many times for me unfortunately 😂
Jonathan!!! I wondered if you and Anna had seen this. I thought after you telling us about your very busy days this would make you both giggle....DISCLAIMER dont watch around kids.\nWatch Go the f**k to sleep, read by Samuel L Jackson on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/Udj-o2m39NA
Totally can relate. I have. 6 /4/2 and a 8mths old Between drop off pick ups in between errand after school clubs. I sometimes feel like a robot with the same schedule and no human time
Yes that has happened to my grandma! My grandpa had the keys in his pocket as they were saying goodbye and she drove away while the keys were still in his pocket! She drove all the way to the store but couldn't start the car to get home! It was hilarious
I love this family from the bottom of my heart !
Some people need to take a chill pill. Anna and Jonathan have their own way of parenting and raising their children. Stop telling them what they should or shouldn't do. Also, stop being rude to Anna. Anna is an amazing mother and she doesn't deserve any of these mean comments. That's my rant for the night. Bye!
Alessia is growing so fast.think it's time she went into a cot as she's to big for the Moses basket...wow Emilia 5already ,I swear it was yesterday she was born lol.little Eduardo has come into his own and quite a handsome little boy xx
Whats missing...FOOD..jonathan!!its supposed to be a teddy bear picnic...too cute..eduardo bless you boy 😘😘😘
Super sweet hearing Eduardo singing good morning again to Alessia.
alessias wee face in the camera when anna was opening the stair gate melted my heart!

For me this one is the best song she has put out in the last few years, so in love with it, somehow she always manages to keep her classic-vintagy-melancholic-vibe without sounding repetitive. \n I   A D O R E
Lana is the only artist I know that gets snubbed by radio but still does just as good or better!
Oh God, I adore this song and clip
great song and that 🎷vintage felling.
Class, as ever! Your vocals just get better and better. I never in a million years thought that my Rock and hard Techno loving head would ever get back into ballads and powerful love songs, but here we are. ;) Keep smashing it, lady!

All I can ever be to you\nIs a darkness that we know\nAnd this regret I've got accustomed to\nOnce it was so right\nWhen we were at our height\nWaiting for you in the hotel at night\nI knew I hadn't met my match\nBut every moment we could snatch\nI don't know why I got so attached\nIt's my responsibility\nAnd you don't owe nothing to me\nBut to walk away I have no capacity\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nI don't understand\nWhy do I stress the man\nWhen there's so many bigger things at hand\nWe could a never had it all\nWe had to hit a wall\nSo this is inevitable withdrawal\nEven if I stop wanting you\nA perspective pushes through\nI'll be some next man's other woman soon\nI can not play myself again\nI should just be my own best friend\nNot fuck myself in the head with stupid men\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nSo we are history\nYour shadow covers me\nThe sky above ablaze\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, in this blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nI wish I could say no regrets\nAnd no emotional debts\nCause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets\nSo we are history\nThe shadow covers me\nThe sky above ablaze that only lovers see\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, ma blue shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, my deep shade\nMy tears dry on their own\nHe walks away\nThe sun goes down\nHe takes the day but I'm grown\nAnd in your way, my deep shade\nMy tears dry on their own
When Dua hit that second verse, I start bawling. God bless you Amy Winehouse. Look at what your art did? 💖💗
WHAT. A. DUO. \nThey both have amazing vocals and together they sound even better! Loved this performance of them
Just don't understand why they still want to use a fake music back when it comes to make hits....these instruments are so good to listen to with their voices on them!
More of duets by the both of u pls!!!
👏👏👏👏👏 What a great collaboration!
This is a match made in heaven.........LOVE Gallant he is a genius!xoxox
this is music to my eyes in every sense of the saying
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how good dua sounds? 😍\nLove her and her music!
Gallants talking voice is WILD! HIS RANGE IS AMAZING!

It's like listening to a Dreamgirls (musicale) duet. Sooooo lovely!!😍😍
She needs to record this and release as a tribute
This is truly beautiful. So much talent, and such a beautiful tribute.
Their voices!! I'm blessed
Amazing song and Amazing dueee. His Voice is so 😍😍😍 and a bout her nothing tô tell . In loveeee

2017 and male singers still change the lyrics so they can feel straight enough
I need this song on Spotify!!! Please please please
she checks out the lyrics often but that does not distract her from singing beautifully and so effortlessly she truly is a great artist
THIS IS SO GOOD, AMY MUST  BE SMILING IN HEAVEN
dua needs to record a soul album, ASAP
there is nothing wrong with this 😍😪💫
The Voice of Amy OMG 👏😱😱 Love Dua Lipa

Roses are red🌷\nViolets are blue👀\nDua Lipa I'm here for you❤ \nAnd only you👍
I love both of them. But I would not have predicted this duet. IM SHOOK AND AMAZED.
Now I can die in peace, I always wanted to hear Dua covering Amy Winehouse, RIP beautiful soul she would've been 34 years by now, gone too soon!
THIS IS LITERALLY MY FAVORITE AMY SONG OMFG

all I can think of is the fans who wished to listen to Dua covering an Amy Winehouse song one day
I like this song better than the original. Doesn't mean the original is bad tho. but I love dua lipa's husky voice, she should do this kind of song in the future
dua is one of the best singers ever
Never expected this. I love both of their voices so much 💞
Não conhecia Dua Lipa, mas gente, eles não conseguem errar mesmo. Que vozes!
2:50 tell dua i'm pregnant
The amount of talent in this video is overwhelming. Props to the audio the quality is dope. Dua needs to be more famous and so is Gallant

Top!
I really liked Book of Life, this one looks promising as well!
The next level of book of life movie
Can't wait to see COCO😂😀 n hey. Whatch out for the chancla😂😁😘😘
The kid probably is gonna be transgender 🙄
I just want to know what song is playing in the background of this trailer. I feel like I know it / recognize it, but I can't put my finger on it.
My god Pixar, I mean this is gorgeous. Every Pixar film is amazing or at least decent (Accept Cars 2) but my god this takes animation to a whole new level I'm mostly excited for Pixars coco there first musical.
I'm excited to watch the movie
Wasn't the main character from book of life also not allowed to play music even though he wanted to?
My Sunday school teacher is an animator for Pixar and has been working on this movie. I can't wait to see it.
Marco is that you?
Looks an awful lot like Book of Life. Like, a LOT. I seriously doubt Pixar are not aware of this.
Looks like a great movie!  Can't wait to see it!  I just hope Disney doesn't turn it into a ride, because it will probably make a horrible ride.
This looks really good. Buuuut it also looks really similar to the Book of Life so yeah. I think the only way I can feel confident in judging if it's copying that one is if I watch them both, so I'll definitely be watching this movie.
Can you have camila cabello singing a song
I see Pixar\nMy heart fills with happiness
there should be cholos in this movie
I AM H Y P E ABOUT THIS LATINO/A REPRESENTATION
But like...\nWhy do disney mkvies stick to the formula of a young character wanting to be/do something and then having their parents stop that goal in the first act, but are then redeemed in the second or third act; where the parents reveal thry do it out of love? Moana did this with her not being allowed to explore, brave did this with merida wantibg to not be a princess, mulan the same thing, nemo wanting to explore ect. I like how this has a spirited away thing going on (though not wholly otiginal either (corpse bride))
Visually this movie looks beautiful. I might go see it.
Pixar's First Movie Musical. Can't wait!!!
Looks like a beautiful movie
I hope they make bendy and the ink machine the movie
Two movies take place in Japan\n*People say nothing*\n\nTwo place take place in Mexico\n*IT'S JUST LIKE BOOK OF LIFE!!!*
Sooo if you disappear once no one remembers you, does that mean Hitler would live forever? Because he's going to be in history books for a long time....
I only hope this lives up to its predecessor: The Book of Life
The first time I've seen a xoloitzcuintli in a movie
Finally a Coco comment section that ISN'T full of BoL fans calling it a ripoff.\nEdit:  nvm apparently people still think it's a ripoff
That dog makes me lose my bejeezers
When does this take place?
Damn the book of life 2 looks
It seems that they changed the music to appeal to American audiences. The previous trailers had Mariachi music and now this one has The Vervepipe. More people should learn to appreciate music from different cultures.
Cool! Just come to the US legally and we will have no problem whatsoever :)
Is this book of life 2? Lol
Also is that an alibreje creature? Awesome just like in Legend quest
I see a strange similarity between this movie and The Book Of Life.
Oh god another musical... Thank god I don't have kids so I won't be forced to watch this.
It has uncanny resemblance with The Book of Life.
Amazing, just amazing. Pixar always does a great job. This ain't an exception.
This film is definitely going to win an oscar next year
Book of life was a good movie. And they know that.
Now Disney will get rich off Mexican culture
wow I love the book of life
Will they be taking part in the Skeleton War?
What's the name of the song
*Comment complaining about a comment that doesn't exist*
What a nice advertisement for the book of life!!
Can I just say I am grateful my mother hasn't hit me with a chancla yet, she has about five pairs sitting on a rack...
Can't wait for book of life 2, though..This one has a lot less style. Hmm..
This looks really cute, but the storyline is cliche. Some kid wants to follow his forbidden dream, goes on a journey, proves to his family that his dream is actually good, etc. etc.
The book of life?
OMG I'M SO HYPED TO SEE THAT WINGED JAGUAR THING IT LOOKS SO SICK!!!
They keep doing a good job
THEY EVEN ADDED THE PAN DULCE!!!!!!! I'm excited to see what other not so obvious Latin culture will  be shown.
when bittersweet symphony started playing it got to me lol
It's a bittersweet symphony
Stop showing the whole movie
Is this supposed to be a Disney/Pixar Book of Life version kinda thing
I AGREE WITH THE YOUTUBE-LIKERS, I WANT TO SEE THAT MOVIE CALLED: DISNEY PIXAR COCO THE 2017 COMEDY MOVIE TOO!!!!!!!    :-D
Don't mind me. I'm just waiting for The Incredibles 2 trailer to drop. :)
#waw
Iamaginagooooooooo
As a mexican i have to say \nThis is mexican fan service
Three words... WHAT A FAGGOT
DAY OF DEATH :)
Wheres incredibles 2 at tho
This remind anyone else of Kubo.
Fear the chancla, niños!
AAAAAAAAAA IM SO HYPED
Happy Hispanic Heritage Month chicos!
Pedro Infante
coco karol sevilla
*cough cough book of Life cough cough*
Grim fandango
Big like
1:00
Conan for Life.
So basically poco from brawl stars 😂
But why?
looking good
Looks weird
this looks great
lol la chancla
The abuelita whipping around  chanclas like nunchucks is my fave part.
I love Coco
2004: NO CAPES\n2017: NO MUSIC
That esculated quickly
This looks good
VIVA LATINOAMERICA CARAJO
We can have more than one dia de los muertos movie
oh look the book of life had a baby
So how will this sit into the pixar theory.
Mijo, so thees ees the plot of the entire movie! Bad press made Peexar very nervous, and still thees looks like Book of Life, si?
Isn't it pretty much a copy of the book of life but in more modern times
Does Disney do any films about black people?
Jesus loves you so much and that love he has for you is overwhelming and is like your the only person in all existence that he loves. I'm taking prayer request and if you have questions about God I'm here. I know this video isn't about God but I wrote this in the hope I'll help someone. I'm not trying to push or force my faith on anyone, It's just a friendly offering. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless you and have a great rest of your year!:)
Cuando se estrenará?
What's the title for the background music?
Book of life 2 looks great
Basic Ly th same thing as 2015s book of life
Oh look it's the book of life
Я один русский?
Do Wish next!
Congrats your trending !! :)
that's cancelled hahaha :-)
Video starts @ 2:43
U look like Meghan reiks
Why is this trending
literally thought that was madewell too lol
http://formoneyonly.com/?refer=74572
They're all scams.
There is a site where everything is 5.99..you should try that..I found some good stuff
you are very cute.
I gotta get a card with a alias.. Can't trust the internet..
you look like my g ma
I can''t stand the one size fits all concept. Its incredibly misleading and its encouraging to see influencers who also don't see the point of it!
I'm out here thinking it's that lady from Scubs
Love these haul/testing videos!! <33 It would mean so much to me if you watched one of my videos!
You have such a calming presence. Can you just hug me all day?
Please try Zaful next! It's a similar website but delivery takes about 1.5 to 2 weeks so not as bad!
Yay!!!!  Leighann trending!!  Y'all need in on this!!  Subscribe!!
I love the smell of paint, maybe not toxic but yeah
Am I the only one who gets irked by her complaints when she looks perfect and super fit in every single thing? Like I get it, I don't like alot of clothes either but that's because I'm pudgy and muffin tops happen no matter what
Inu inu is a scam lol the material is so low quality
You should do Cupshe. I see a lot of cute stuff on there but am too scared and picky to try it. I loved the rainbow dress on you! Too bad it was see through.
leighann you *are* a lady <3
Before I buy anything online I check if you did a Try-On.\nLove Your Videos!!
Her looking like a mess is better than myself after getting ready for two hours lmao
Wtf do u buy gucci? That stuff is good.
Any other small YouTube channels out there?
I've been successful with some bathing suit purchases from Shein. Their high waisted bikinis are so cute.
Those pjs look so cute! I want them ❤️
You should really keep the orange striped one it looked really pretty on you
I ordered from Shein once and would never do it again. I knew Shein from a fashion blogger name Jessica (hapatime). Their materials are terrible. I believe Shein is located in Asia (Singapore, as I remember). I didn't even bother to return the clothes but gave away to my friends. Just don't even bother to order from this site. Boohoo or Lulus have better quality
That blue dress at the end reminded me a little bit of a black blouse you used to have wayyyyyyyyyy back when that I loveddd. It had kindofa detail like that in the front too
You should try Fairy Season!
I thought she put Shein for Scam, she in
Shein, romwe, zaful, etc., are in no way a scam. They just have generic clothes in low quality material. If u mostly shop on these site then u either have a bad sense of fashion or ur just broke. I used to have 10 items from Shein n only 1 that i like. The rest r in the local goodwill.
Great video! Just bought from them, hopefully it'll be okay
I laughed thru this whole video you are hilarious 😂. And I was on break at work watching it and I was late going back oops! ❤️❤️
I love your channel and think you're so sweet but I really hate these kinds of videos. You should provide more research into where these clothes come from, why their so cheap, not just are they O.K. quality. To think about the sweatshops and chemicals that these cheap clothes all come from is appalling and you should cover those bases before promoting the clothes, because that's the true price tag (although the hidden one) that should be more considered. Love your channel, again, just wish you could consider that or talk about it.
YOU'RE ON TRENDING WOW. SO PROUD OF YOU, B. 👏💛💛💛💛
I noticed that you wore your hair the same in the other two hauls you mentioned!! Haha. How funny is that!
I LOVE SHEINS T SHIRTS, THOSE ARE BOMB.
I feel like a block when I watch her try on videos. But at least I can be a cute block. 👌
With your body everything is going to look good on you. I just don't like that rainbow dress just because of the color.
Yeah ...I was confused too when I saw so many clothing items one size ...nothing actually fitted 😂
All I can say is gawd that bawd!
More try on hauls from scammy sites please!
Currently watching off my\nPhone I live in Florida and I am on day #6 of no power, your video gave me a little normalcy for today thbak you
If you keep the shorts, turn them inside out and pop them in a lingerie bag when you wash them to protect the applique from 'fuzzing'. And dry on low if it's cotton applique since it would shrink - probably poly, tho.
Loving that you're trending but not digging the negative comments from people who obviously don't normally watch your videos. 🙄
Unrelated but can you do a workout routine video?
Girlfriend! #22 on trending! Go Leighann! 😄
The rainbow dresss!!!!
Rosegal
KEEP THE PIRATE PANTS! Soooo cute 😍
I love these scan site videos and all try on videos please do more!❤️
Do they ship directly from china ?
Are these all made in sweatshops like shein romwe zaful?
Leighann, Your body is sick. You could put on a potato sack and look great. I would have kept most of those clothes because you looked so hot in most of them.
Watching from the UK and I love your videos, you are so funny.  I love your bangs we call it a 'fringe' in the UK.  That white dress is lovely such a  shame about the hole though! x
Wow! Everything looks so good on you what??
I think you can still wear all of these! I live in south Texas as well and I feel we don't get to enjoy fall weather and fall fashion till after Halloween! Texas girl problems 💕
I  like those kind of pajamas, and indeed like the one you have. But that's pretty much what I spend on them anyway. Love your personaility!
The short blue dress I'd use for Halloween if I dressed like a toddler With pigtails, short socks, Mary Jane shoes and freckles on my face!
It never even occurred to me that this might be a scam. I've almost ordered from there several times, but the one size fits all thing turned me off of it.
The clothes are so cute
That bag looks like it has a purse version of truck nuts. Lol. Sorry.
That medium rainbow dress actually looked like it fit you! 😂
Can you try dresslily I've been curious about their clothes
You're on the trending page!!! I feel like a proud mom ❤❤ also,  I have the target pajamas you were talking about and I call them my domestic pjs cause they make me feel like a sophisticated mom hahaha
Pajamas remind me of Blanche's bedspread and wallpaper ... Yes, I have golden girls on the brain 🤣
You should try fairy season 🤔
I got bangs around the time you did and started growing them out before you did and let me tell you... My bangs never looked this cute at any of the stages of growth.
One size fits all is someone's lazy way of not doing their job. And then there's always the one size fits most. That's just a step up from that one size fits all.
Dress Lily seems like one of those companies, it's always showing up n my FB feed...curious!
The crinkly sound that last dress makes as you're showing it 😂
Love the pirate pants and the luck shirt tied up
Im so sad about the lady dress! It looks so cute on you, maybe exchange? The kindergarten teacher dress sounded like a parachute in audio? Glad you got some wins in this haul. 😁
I typically hate hauls but for whatever reason, I enjoy watching yours. The format just makes it seem like I'm talking to a friend about what she got while shopping and I love it!
You can literally hear the last dress as you were moving it around. What is that material? Lol
But you look fabulous I don't even look this good on my best day with a miracles help.
Promptly bought that pj set and will have no shame wearing the top in public.
is everything made of polyester from this place? thats why its all so crap lol
That white and red shirt would look so cute with high waisted bell bottoms!!!
do you mean Tweed?! :) Love this video! I got some things from SheIn years ago and lucked out- even though the material was super cheapy, the clothes were cute and fit! But needless to say, I never shopped there again :) XO Great video!
I have always wanted to be one of those people who dresses in the wrong time period. Me too! I wish I would dress vintage sometimes :)
Why aren't you a model?
Well I ordered from Shein and my order arrived  in 6 days...I live in Spain.\nAlso the things you said were too big; you could have easily tailored them yourself
Greta video..:) you are so adorable. SHEIN has been sending me clothes for a few years now and I can almost  tell what is going to be quality....but I am an older woman...LOL....I am going for those maxi dreamy dresses and they are nice :) Happy weekend!!! Susan
You should do more tall girl section hauls. I love those videos.
Pump and dump
Your trending gurl!! 💗💗👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Bone her kiss kiss
So happy this is trending!
Who do you work for ?
You could just fix it yourself? Needle and thread?
I feel like she made a big deal about it. Like some stuff really were like off, but sein rlly does have sometimes good things, but I would not risk buying pants or dresses but she makes a big deal about some things that don't look that bad.
thank God u are not a kindergarten teacher cuz you are a bimbo!!!! so annoying!!!!
Incredibly disingenuous when this chick looks like she spent no less than 45 minutes on hair and make up and then says it looks like crap. Girlll you full of it. Buuuuut I'm stay watch and see what you're about
Fake fans must think this song is new.
The song is too much 😭😭😻🎵🎵🎵🎵
His voice is everything  😄😄😍😍😍 holy cuctus

A little different from his usual but still killing it!!!! MGK 4 life

Dope.....hes got all kinds of talent. .....
Dope, love the change of pace
wow never expected mgk to b out of rap even in 1 song...

this is the funniest thing ive seen in 1 year
Damn... This was somehow a parody + a heartwarming trailer... *_*
I want this movie - now! LOL!
Never really thought love have much of a point. But I was wrong, it has a thousand points. Wow, that's actually quite beautiful.
Where's watch out ronaldo song we need it
LOL I will never be able to see Narcos the same way ever again.
Can someone please make this into a real movie?
Mama need'a hit that
Jelly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI like it.
Now I am going to be disappointed when the story doesn't flow like this, you guys did a good job I want to see THIS movie.
This is really good LOL
Way better than the original show.
Why do I want to see this movie? Lol
‘Narcos’ locations manager shot dead while scouting in Mexico \n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/narcos-locations-manager-killed-scouting-mexico-article-1.3500168
This type of movie needs to be made. It's amazing.
Man this is amazing.. this plays like a really long trailer to a heart-warming family comedy. One I would watch
That would be such a great Movie ;)
One of my favorites to date 😂
Anyone know the song that starts at 5:58. Also this is the most amazing trailer I've ever seen.
yombah
PLEASE DO CAMP ROCK PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Im from Pensacola LMAO!!
OH HEY MEXICAN FOOD!
amazing
This is probably the best BLR yet.
Is “Soy Pablo” becomes a real show, I would definitely watch it. Netflix, pick this up!!
Song at the end?
Dang I looked at the camera. \n\nFourth wall is nonexistent
This idea would actually make a great movie! Remember those silly comedies like Top Secret and Hot Shots, etc.? Something like that combined with a film like Dave or Moon Over Parador -- that's what this could be for real.\nI love how BLR is getting more sophisticated and creating whole stories.
Is that the trailer cause I'm going to begin whatching it
I actually thought this was a real episode xD
I would much rather watch that storyline than the one in the trailer for the real Narcos I just watched.
I want to watch this entire show in BLR
An indy feel good movie for sure.
😁😁 I would watch this movie 😂😂😂😂😂
After watching the trailer of Narcos I must say this story looks much more engaging!
I'd watch this if it were a mini series lol
BLR's finest work and that is saying something. I would pay filthy to watch the feature length Soy Pablo at the theater, make it happen :)
Feel good hit of Summer 2018
Would actually be a good premise for a movie
I would totally watch this show
I'd watch this
Put the gun down! They call me “Suave” cause I’m really suave…\nLook listen to suave and put the gun down… or else I’m gonna poke ur nuts XD IM DEAD!!
I'd pay like $20 a pop to see this.
I can’t find the real video
Oh my gosh I watched narcos. It's so good but please have like some sequel to this just anything
I want this to be a real movie now LOL
Mamma need to hit that
No lie, I would legit watch this show. This was almost heartwarming.
Pablo escobar was never real, and neither was Chapo Guzman just lies
I'd watch the crap out of this show
Best independent film of 2017
Holy shit! I would totally watch the comedy version of this show!
Man if this was a movie I would watch it
The I only date women with little tiny fingers scene was funny af and the momma needa hit that scene were comedy 😂😂😂
omg i wish this was real XD\ni would binge watch this😂
This plot is actually really good
Idk anything about the real series but I would totally watch this one. Superb job, BLR!
This could actually work as a movie
I'd still watch it
You guys should do an NBA bad lip reading
*Still one of the best channels on Youtube. No gimmicks needed.*
Wish this was real ):
Call me el Guapo. That was an amazing video, definitely one of your best
Did I really just enjoy an 8 minute trailer
You wanna see how low I can talk?
Very well executed, brilliant and funny
I would watch this for real.
Kind of a sad ending, lol.
I LIKE THIS TRAILER MORE 😂😂😂
Nigga wassup u gonna go live on me like that nigga. U a bitch ass snitch. U a cop.
Once again they come out with gold
What?!?! How can there be almost 1K dislikes?? HATERS GONNA HATE!! How do you not laugh at this?? It's time to go, but they love me, I know... This was freaking great!! How much thought and examination went to this and actually making a story out of it? Soo much talent, gj.
only question is.. why did it take you guys this long!!!??? this was amazing hahahaha :)
Wow...it's kinda dead here. 🎵 it just so happens I like to boogie I like to hip hop all day.. 😂

#48 ON TRENDING how the fuck?
If you're wondering why people would think YouTube has an agenda, this is a pretty good example
Huckabee-Sanders - a Goebellesque mannequin.
Definitely mike huckabees daughter. Family of deplorable cunts.
I'm here
12th trending 3 comments 3k views....\nRlly now you're not every trying to hide it anymore YouTube
View botters
How is there only 2comments
This has been view botted
Stop normalizing these liars and crooks.  Spicer stood in front of the world at had no problem lying through his teeth.  The damage they are doing is real.  Normalizing deplorable behavior is how Trump got elected.
Fuggg Spicy..\nHe should go into hiding along with his\n  Alternative Facts \n          ...LLS..
is he looking at jail time?
currently, we've saved the invisible hamster 9.7 million times
Still a slimy little weasel - my apologies to the real weasels which are actually pretty cute.
I believe the bottom line was he had a job, and he had to do what was necessary to keep it. But someone can only lie for so long about eating the chocolate cake when is in between the teeth and the fingernails
It's pretty cool that Sean Spicer decided to go on Kimmel's show! He had nothing to gain here, and he handled it great.
He's alot more likeable as regular Sean Spicer, he seems happy!
Why is he on this ?????
So many new words!
Service to the country? I think he did the country a disservice. Lying to the people. Misguiding the public. I can't watch this. I'm out guys.
Oh America , this political lacing of all things TV is the end of you all . Try talking instead of labelling .
There goes America again blurring the lines again and making a celebrity out of a liar!
He survived one of the worst jobs ever. ... but I thought he was fired tho... 🤔
He helped spread the obvious lies of Trump and deceive the american people, he should be in prison and sentenced for life, not applauded when walking in to a talk show.
1+1=2 You can't disagree with FACTS.
those of us who worked hard to get him elected  Doesn't that sentence says a lot....? Trump didn't win because he was the best candidate but because people choose the lesser of 2 evil.\nI have ZERO respect for this man and all the others in the WH. They are all in there for their own GREED and corruption
Spicer seems like a good humble nice dude I give em two 👍🏼and a Victoria six pack of 🍻 spicee come watch the fight with us canelo putos!!!
its easy to sit here and scold spicer for sacrificing his integrity and spine the fact is, the situation is a lot more convoluted than that. Spicer took the job to further his political career; nobody could've predicted the SCOPE of the madness that the Trump presidency entailed. I don't think Spicer is AS despicable as Trump and most of his administration.
how ironic when spicer said he was honest with the american people and then said he would say whatever the liar and chief told him to, spicer is nothing but an empty suit who will do or say anything to get a big pay check.
Trump is such a blatant liar. I don't know how Spicer can sleep at night.
Sean is very diplomatic but he's still full of sh.....t!
Poor spicey  I have so much more respect for him now. I bet he's so relieved he out of there now!!
Feel bad for him
Spicey has a funny laugh
Candid interview thank you!
Still dodging ...
GREAT!
Love My President!
He looks so haunted
Holy moly he got old
He is still shitty!
this man is boring af
He needs to distance himself and call out the orange baboon if he wants to cleanse his soul and further his career prospects
Hi Jimmy!\nIf the crowd size was indeed sparse,\nIT'S BECAUSE POOR PEOPLE VOTED HIM IN AND POOR PEOPLE CANNOT AFORD TO MAKE ENDS MEET IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES, LET ALONE HAVE ENOUGH TO TRAVEL TO D.C.\nAnd U, Jimmy, damn-well KNOW that TRUMP Is DAN, so how about getting Urself & The Rest Of The Late Night Hosts/ess (Samantha Bee) to START ACKNOWLEDGING THAT ELEPHANT-IN-THE-ROOM F_A_C_T.\n@PATRICIA_EROZ on Twitter
Don't you just miss the spicer lies
Jimmy should join the Skaggs from the View.
Jesus that suit is tight
I like Spicer he seems nice and genuine. He doesn't take it too seriously and can laugh about it
He was only in that position for a matter of weeks. Why are some acting like he had been in it for years? 😂😂😂
We all have free will...in the end.  Spicer sold his soul and is now trying to play the sympathy card.  You chose your path, Spicy.
It's good to see Sean Spicer smiling. I'm a democrat, but man I felt bad for him while he worked for Trump.
IM NOT AN REPUBLICAN OR CONSTERVIE BUT I THINK SEAN SPICER HAD THE WORST JOB EVER THANK FOR SERVING COUNRTY
So spicy what your saying is, when the orange baboon tells a lie it's your job to perpetuate that lie. Not a very honorable job to have.
He's gathering materials for a book, alright.
The joke is on us with this type of character.
Stop making assholes like this seem normal and nice.
The fact he got roasted as his intro... wow lol
I was hopeful at the beginning of this interview that we'd see the real Spicer but It's like the truth is still being held hostage inside Sean's body, and  it's desperately banging on the doors for help.
Sometimes you have to disagree with facts  How does one disagree with facts??
Ass clown.  Sorry, disagree with the facts? Size of the inauguration is in dispute?
Let's face it, SPICY is not going to say anything really bad about ol' Scrotum neck till he's out of office.\nTHAT is when we'll get the juicy info & what Spicy REALLY thought of the current Groper in chief.
He seems like a decent person outside of the White House
Facts are facts and aren't up for opinion or perspective. A blue sky is a blue sky. Saying it's red because that's your perspective means you're color blind, or just  lying.
Good job Spicer. Jimmy doesn't know. His feelings are intact.
Don't know how that jerk sleeps at night.
I don't think they allowed him to leave soo easily.
It *was* his job...
His Inauguration crowd was huge and a lot was blocked by protesters too, it wasn't easy to get in when it was really early.
You ALWAYS have a choice of WHAT to say. The ''im supposed to voice what the president thinks'' argument is BS.
Suddenly alternative facts doesn't sound like an oxymoron because it's a matter of how you interpret something.
wait what ? so american WH speaker is a position to lie in behalf of the president ?i though he represented the nation........no wonder america is like that
Man, i feel sorry for him.. He seems like nice guy if you look at him now
Would I have love to be a fly on that wall watching Donald Trump correct Sean Spicer on how to articulate a sentence
He is such a pleasant guy! Never knew he had such great smile. We should love one another, beyond politics!
Poor sean.... he had to do what he got to do to keep his job.  Now he's like a floating cloud ☁️ never seen him smile that much, what a change!
😂😂😂😂 I kinda feel sorry for this cracker
Jajajaja jajajaja!!!!! He looks much better he's off the job
I always knew Spicer was a good guy, he is free from the grasp of the devil now.
I want him in SNL
I think he is a good guy and loyal to his boss. He is just doing his job. And no i'm not a Trump supporter. My jaw dropped as well when Spicey announced the inauguration crowd size and end it with 'period'.
I'm a progressive but I appreciate Spicer's service.  It's my understanding that he's also a military reservist. Thank you Sean for your service.
Damn he is actually a fun person
He looks more human now.
jimmy shouldve had him WITH melissa mccarthy.
Spicer seems so nervous. He's like not breathing properly. It's the same way he talks when he's being grilled by reporters. Kinda feel bad for the guy.
At least he can laugh at himself.
some people feel bad for this guy and other people who resigned or was fired  from the administration, but honestly imagine how little dignity one would have to have to work for the Trump Administration.
Love spicers upbeat attitude on the situation but that interview said alot about trumps crazy ways
That frame rate though.
jimmy was just roasting him lol
Awkward AF 😂
Nothing's changed
Scummy clown.
Spicer is still....Spicer. Ugh
Spicer is funny AF 😂
this poor guy...
Yayyy! Spicey!
sad
No shame
He talks and laughs like Guiemo
He´s the president, so he´s allowed to lie.
Awww look at how cute and cuddly this professional liar and psychopath enabler is now that he's left his post. Let's all chuckle and give him a round of applause.
Never seen Spicy smile before. Working for Trump can't make smiling easy.
Lies=Alternative Facts; welcome to the Trump world!
Jimmy Kimmel is an idiot.  His bias is showing. Yes we all know he is an anti-Trump.
Can we disagree with the facts? Says the liberal. Jesus that's ironic.
Wow Jimmy getting all worked up and upset about Trump made me cringe so bad. How can a guy who starred on The man show be so sensitive. I guess he is so close to getting cancelled he has to be a PC zombie or he will be replaced by someone who will.
Spiceman is still full of SH!T!
WOW! Melissa McCarthy really let herself go. Is she pregnant?
You guys should add The Black Label Shit the Bed hot sauce to the roster
DO ONE WITH LEBRON JAMES
This is the best show on YouTube; fuck Vlogs \nCouldn't agree more Dillon
Get Jack black on!
Hey Sean. Does scoville increase with portion size? Obviously you guys add more on the last dab and im just wondering does that last dab increase the intensity/level of scoville ingested, or does it just increase the portion of scoville you have eaten?
Err he is soo boring and lame especially a perdon that's in edm...
Im a Grain of sand on YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a desert
By far the best guest yet and I don't know who he is! Thanks for that interview Sean Evans! Hot Ones has my wife and I tuning in every week for more! Congrats on the success my friend. Much Love
i'm not from that generation...but you are?
are you really doing hot ones without gabriel iglesias?
Found a new Hot Sauce for you guys to try out! It's called Shit the Bed from Australia :D https://www.bunstersworldwide.com/products/bunsters-shit-the-bed-hot-sauce-12-10-heat
I don't know who Dillon Francis is
I feel like this is a start of a friendship, this was a great interview!
Who is the dj that he say at 9:50m
I just realized this is in 1440p
complaining about how easy youtube is while hosting a wing eating show on youtube lawl
Wtf you pushing your own product on the Last Dab?  Do you not understand the branding of the Last Dab?  Y'all straight jumped the shark.  I know what your hottest sauces are.  I get that you'd advertise them, but you ruin your credibility when you say lol THIs is the hottest wing *wink wink*  There's no neutrality.  Come on.
Get Louis C.K., actually never mind my asking won't work so never-freaking-mind!!!
He's pretty cool
That color collection hurt my eyes
I'm not even a fan of EDM and have never heard of this dude, but he seems cool as fuck and good attitude.
Where is the  aggressive brand name?
Sean Evans... is your mouth perpetually fire?  Just asking for a friend...
respect to the White Sox Throwback Sean!
PLEASE GET YELLOW CLAW ON THE SHOW
I just need Gordon Ramsay. Please
I work in a butchers. I need to get a box of chicken wings and a few bottles of hot sauce. Just as good as beer. Even better with beer.
Sean as a fan of the hip hop scene and hot wings all things hot, this show really needs some dong lover, aka Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino.
pauses and goes and watches Pursuit for the million time
this dude was like, hey, maybe you really can fight fire with fire.
11:17 I miss the old [enter artist] Every Skrillex fan ever

Get Kevin smith on this!
Love the Sox Jersey
Alton brown needs to get on this show
Is it me, or are you guys taking it easy on the guests these past couple of seasons? There aren't that many crazy reactions to the sauces any more. T.J. Miller and most of the first season comes to mind.
YO!! Y'all GOTTA get Gary Vaynerchuk on this shit!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
you should definitely get bill skarsgard on here
Get the rock on this bitch
I think now is as good a wing as ever.  -Sean Evans
Ok now im 100% sure this guy edits everyone in the video saying that the hot ones sauce is good. Before the show he is like, Hey man, could you do me a solid and just say the hot ones sauce is good after you take a bite. That would be tight bro.  Nothing bad just an observation.
new song with yung pinch bout to be lit
get Mac miller he would be funny
I miss the old dillon francis
Not watching the video because I refuse to sit through a forced 30 seconds of a Cher and Future ad. What. The. Fuck.
Can you do the fire noodels
Get Bill Burr and Louis CK

BUT BUT BUT! you havent made something like without you... ?

Omg u need tyler, the creator in this show
Taking fighting 🔥 with 🔥 too far
Next season let's see Blair's ultra death sauce with jersey 🔥. Love the show it would be awesome to eat wings with you.
Don't get me wrong, I give props to anyone brave enough to eat anything hot. But eating the pepper itself is Always hotter.
There's a lot of good in YouTube that just didn't get the recognition they deserve.
My dad eats the last one
how do you apply the hot sauce on the wings?
Get gordon ramsay on the show
This was the best Hot Ones yet!\nProperly enjoyable :)

Proud of your success. We need to have a meeting with Mr Musk, I am heading up a United States crew to head into the Congo to negotiate ways to extract more blue gold without using child labor. It will be a win win for both the United States and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We have to help the nation and they help us in return, some very simple reasonable methods. Get at me sir after you filter through all your comments. Peace.
I been here since 70k

the clone looks like the kid with the bike from coraline. Jonathon?
the outro's gonna give me nightmares
I love how the WHOLE eyeball is green :D
Welp this is going to hunt me in my nightmares
okay but why has he made 2012 harry styles?
Could you unlock an iPhone X with that?
Help! I gave my clone sentience by mistake!
this is such an abomination; I am afraid
_Oh dear god_\nPJ\nI have a fear of creepy mannequin-like faces\n*This is the motherload of creepy mannequin-like faces*
add some green for a perfect skin tone! (it's true, and it's the craziest thing I've learned)
Is that fucking goebbels from one of pewds' vids? Cause he looks so.
If this doesn't end with an evil clone twist I'll be very suprised
Those star transitions really convinced me
wow definitely a professional, just look at that star transition.
I'm preparing for nightmares!
well.... that was.......\n\n\n\nPERFECT
Me: *looks at the title* Clone?\n        *looks at the thumbnail* FINALLY. TWO OF PJ
I wonder if he scripts these or just ad libs coz it feels very ad libbed <3
Your glasses are my goals in life. To look that cool and professional.
Peej I gotta say sometimes I get a little concerned about you/whatever is going on in your head
Even if it does look a bit like Harry Styles
You know what Peej? I think you accomplished that resolution to make creepier videos. Yeah. I think so.
HE'S WEARING GLASSES AGAIN YES PJ THANK YOU\nedit: you just never know how much weirder it'll get when it comes to pj
Don't touch the clones. Let the clones touch you. Quote PJ 2017
wait... which one was the real PJ?
Weirdest channel to watch when you're drunk 😅
So for the skin tone, a touch of blue and diluting it with white would have made it match better. It was too warm  to match him
Am I the only one who wanted another Wiggles the Clown video especially after IT was released?
I absolutely love the way people with a British accent say the way perfect. So thank you for this video lol
DOn'T ToUCH THe CLoNES, LET ThE CLOnES tOUCH YoU
Isn't it a bit early for Halloween?
i already have an identical twin so i won`t be needing a clone, sorry
I made a clone, it worked...Til tonight...i saw him kill my entire family. Wot do?
this is what nightmares are made of
Is this a cry for help pj¿
Was that Dan at the end saying those words? XD JK I know it's PJ
I honestly live for the little comments that PJ says after he realises what he said\nI also think that the clone looks a little like michael jackson
I don't understand. The guy I took the face from kept cursing and trying to beat me. What did I do wrong? ;-;
Look at that man who was worried about having glasses now :V lookimg a little too good if you ask me, I understand why he would want to avoid anybody seeing him on that level of attractiveness
Why does PJ need a perfect clone when he has a realistic hologram???
I can get used to PJ with glasses
How to make 2,000,000 in a week:\n1:browse a online store of stuff you can't afford\n2:cry in the corner\n3:eat a whole tub of ice cream\n4:realize you have set an ice cream-eating record\n5:call Guinness World Records to clarify\n6:make money off of merch\n7:rinse and repeat\n\nIf your'e in the U.K\n1:do the steps above\n2:fly to the U.S where one pound costs 1.86% more\n3:almost double your money
5:09 that hair actually looks like yours, bravo!!\n\nalso kinda looks like harry styles like you mentioned at the end lol
PJ WHAT IS THIS
I love every music on your videos 🎶
With every video I am astounded by how wonderfully odd you are...
I'm gonna make a perfect clone now!
In the beginning, I said he looked like Harry Styles a little bit and then he said the clone looked more like Harry Styles.... Coincidence? I THINK NOT
kickthepj: for the weird and wonderful
The hair is #goals
I think I love you
PJ, just a painting tip! Add a little blue to your light orange paint to neutralize it and create the perfect caucasian skin tone :)
pj: leans in to kiss the foam ball\n\nme: KICKTHESTICKZ FLASHBACK HELP LIFE ALERT YES IVE FALLEN AND I CANT GET UP
1:54 how girls at school put on their makeup
Are you like me and don't wanna get out of bed and face the day? He says as I watch this to avoid doing just that
The clone reminds me of the boy from Coraline
We had picture day yesterday and all the photographer wanted to do was talking to me and I said ok take the frikien picture so I can leave thank you
Just recently subscribed and I love your videos. They're hilarious. I love your personality and creativity!
stole a face you say? sounds like PJ IS the DARK LORD OF MIITOPIA
Currently watching Orphan Black so cloning make sense to me
My picture day was Thursday and I had a dog bite on my face. I wish I had a clone then
PJ is the Dark Lord from Miitopia, who else could steal faces like that?
Why is he so cute?
I love the inconspicuous lullaby cube in the background.
Is it bad I used that exact mask to create shrek masks
I gotta make a perfect clone for twin's day at school when that roles round! I gotta be original ya know!? XD
One day you'll have an argument over who the original is...
it's gonna get weird... every KickThePj video ever (in a great way :P )
The hair is perfect! Also: why didn't you just use a mannequin head instead of... whatever this is
anyone know what song he uses in the background ?
Right so I went to the doctors and got a prosthetic cock but now whenever I bust a nut, a nut pops out so now I have to hold my balls when I nut.
more videos like this please
wtf did i just watch. also pj looks so good in his recent few videos
These star wipes have traumatised me
those glasses look gr9
GAMERANX MUSIC
3:35-3:42 My favorite line ever??
peej's transitions tho
♥️♥️♥️
Background music?
It kinda looks like lorde
I Just adore your glasses!
so many nightvale-esque moments here

I want to see what criteria the use to say their have only been 6 left terror attacks I guess antifa doesn't count cause I personally can name more than 6 also didn't a left wing nut job just shoot a bunch of Republicans was that 1 of the 6
Where is the documentation, proof, studies, polls, records, etc... that white supremacist groups are the most violent? Have you ever heard of Islam, Antifa, BLM... Both sides have done horrible atrocities but to constantly blame white people is not factual.

keep punching nazis
Magic video!
I just can't like this girl....
Why aren't whites allowed to be proud of who we are? Every race has and had bad people, why does every white person have to be held accountable for it?
So 2900 americans dead 9 11 by muslims dont count?
When you feel more self-confident there's no one to blame anymore. Such a true and great quote which is the solution to envy and jealousy, I seriously needed that to start my day.
What about the violent leftists terrorists at Berkeley? Didn't one just stab a woman in the neck because they disagreed with her? You know, the left that's been rioting and sending death threats to a Jew......acting like nazis.
...So out of touch. ...So smug and self-satisfied... *_I don't understand why Hillary lost_*
ANTIFA?
Boycott Samantha bee. She's a vile screeching cow who blatantly lies and has been coughs lying in almost every episode. Do not trust her for any entertainment or news.
More dislikes than comments.. and this is considered trending?
I truly pity anyone that regularly watches Samatha Bee. You cant be saved at this point.
But where are these terrorists attacks? Where are the reports? Deaths? Injuries? There are constant reports of attacks from leftwing radicals, constant reports of attacks from radical islamists, constant reports of attacks in places like the Philippines from religious radicals.
The Nazis of the past were definitely a threat. The Nazis of today, not so much.. They can't even bring proper torches out for a mob, which says a lot about how defanged they are.\n\nThat being said, punching them isn't gonna accomplish nothing. Remember the words of Dr. King Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. For all of you advocating for punching Nazis, I a black man ask you this, has that made less riots and civil disturbances occur less across the nation? Have you truly succeed?
The left IS racist AND fascist. They think other races NEED white people to SAVE them and want to control them to submit like pets. The left is racist and fascist!
samanthabee.com/lifeafterhate  - link at the end of the episode.
Just had a terrorist attack, but WHITE SUPWEMACISTSSTST!
love cannot exist without hate and hate cannot exist without love
I'm glad to see a beautiful African american woman fight white supremacy
I'm sure the 1k dislikes didn't watch the show😐\n #LifeAfterHate 😁
most of the facts she pulls from are just provably wrong so I cant even begin to criticize the points shes making
I support the goals of Life After Hate, but the white guilt in this video is kind of nauseating.
that's insane they gutted funding wow
Im a great comedian that has gotten millions of views and thought about suicide i was thinking about drowning myself so many times if you all wanna save me please DM me on instagram @comedian_thefreshman they all say I might be better than Kevin Hart
The dreamers & Medicare for all please watch https://youtu.be/XRnOdnWtQbc
I would love to meet former white supremacists. I mean that very genuinely. I just want to sit and have a conversation.
Lack of love distorts people, and love is the cure for all evil.
There are black racists, BLM, and white racists, Neos, and brown racists, La Raza.  There will be hate groups...best to join Christians United and promote love.
Camilo sesto
Good going sam!
:)
Useful stuff. \nHonestly I've got mixed feelings on the issue, I think groups like Life After Hate are incredibly useful and important and good. \nAt the same time, plenty of bigots are incredibly violent and dangerous and many have gotten into positions of power and will use that to hurt people, so people do, I feel, have to be willing to rebel or fight back against violence and injustice as well. \nThere's no single perfect solution sadly.
I'll stop punching nazis when they stop threatening me with death.
The terror statistic is BS
This is the 1000th comment!! :-)
Wait, you all caught that part about Trump eliminating the funding for anti-hate groups like this, right?
Deport the nazis to europe ~ 😛
So this actual passes for comedy now days?
But how does the hug disengage them from the Nazis? Like... If they stay Nazis to get hugs...
You have a nasty attitude. I can't wait until you ruin your own career. \n\nAnd Trump WON!!!!!
Don't you have some cancer patient to mock?
Hate towards cancer patients 🤔
troubled waif......a worrying woman's woman.
She has awesome hand movements.
#Hillaryforprison
Great interviews Sam.
join interracially against racism on facebook
Sam is so awesome
LOVE!
Samantha Bee for president!
Classic racist garbage. Thanks for nothin Samantha Bee. Talk about both sides. AKA BLM. -I hate white supremacists, I hate black supremacists.
What an evil hag. Why does she get a show?
The propaganda is real.
🏳☮🏳 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLQ_h2kdt0U    PEACE SONG PROJECT, YOU ALSO WATCH AND SHARE, DO SOMETHİNG FOR PEACE... 🏳☮🏳
I'm proud to be white.
Yeah I too dislike those terrorists that dress all black and destroy Berkley... oh wait
Of course YouTube trends more leftist propaganda, you're not even trying anymore Sam, you're just making entire segments out of Salon and HuffPost articles, but your viewers have such cognitive dissonance they don't even care! They're worse than 45 supporters.
Why won't she ever bring up statistics in her propaganda ? Come on Samantha you are on the right side of history. Just talk about the statistics lol. \n\n\n\n\nOh wait. She literally can't.
I love all the links to the studys shes getting all of the numbers from
Hey it's not racist if your black and hate white people, it's only white people who are even capable of racism.\n\nHerrrrrr durrrrr...
What about the terrorists on the left beating people and damaging property.
Nice! Now call out the BLM supramicists and Communist Antifa...oh wait..
It's embarrassing that YouTube puts this as trending with barely 200k views.
Choke on a bowl of dicks.
What's wrong with you people? All Samantha spews is hate!
I really hate this woman... white pride is fabricated... I'm white and know white people and don't hear anything about racist thoughts...the terrorists are the left fuckwads that attack people randomly
unfunny
Pure propaganda. Sad faggots who watch this
Marxist authoritarian trash.
Samantha, now do you see why Trump is POTUS?\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFUIVfKTeVg&list=PLrEnWoR732-BHrPp_Pm8_VleD68f9s14-&index=1
1k dislikes?.. Keep going with this stuff Sam clearly we still have a problem..
Am I supposed to give her my movie ticket?
It is Antifa that's instigating violence across America. That is what the statistics say. So why is this disinformation here?
I wish Samantha would get lost and stumble onto a busy freeway 👍🏽
Thank you Sam for pointing out the blatantly obvious to anyone who can do a google search on terrorism in the USA. People should already know this, but we have to be led by a comedian to actually look at the facts and statistics.
95% blacks are Savage animals deserve to be put in zoos They ruin schools communities raping pillaging and murdering  basically a walking talking disease like cancer
Trump is a white supremacist racist, just like his white hooded daddy.  End of story.
Youtuber trying to reach 13k subscribers. I make natural hair/fashion videos and would love if anyone subscribed if they like what they see ❤️❤️❤️
More Alt-Left propaganda... 👎🏿
Hahahahahahaha \nFakenews \nAmericans are not nearly as racist as we are portrayed by fakenews.
The title should be changed to Life after Modern-Day Liberals. It's essentially the same thing.
White supremacy isn't a problem here in America and if you think it is you're lagging behind the rest of us
You know how to not solve the problem people? By alienating white males... It's not like they are the one group you need to be working with to come together. It's only going to fuel more racism but keep it up guys let's drag everyone back 60 years to make yourselves feel better about Trump being president. We need to stop awarding people for playing victim or else why would anyone want to change (Hollywood).
You know if someone wold say the mojordy of the tarist are black it's racist then if you say the same about white people it's not then oh wait that means ur still racist to White people wich we come to the hidden Truth this Sam is racist.
I wish BLM supporters would start coming out of the hate closet too.
Talking about brainwashed america liberals have destroyed this world
I think we can all agree that Oregon is a terrible place where you can't even pump your own gas.
Genuinely curious if Samantha has done a show on brown nationalism or Islamic supremacy? If one attack in America killing a white person can spark this kind of content then hundreds of attacks by one group, there has to be at least one video. If there is let me know I'd love to watch it and see if I can donate to ending hate towards whites.
*THIS IS ALT-LEFT PROPAGANDA*
Meanwhile in Europe...
You are intellectually dishonest
Thanks Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.:)
Oy vey goyim support non-whites  and have  multiracial children.
Those pesky christians blowing people up
Samantha i pray everyday that you get cancer
No, you should definitely punch Nazis. That's what our grandpas did in Europe and that's what we should do here.
OBSESSED WITH YOUR HAIRRRR!😍😍🙌🏽🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
you are GLOWING!💫
Looks lovely Fleur
Always reliable reviews! Thanks Fleur! That lip gloss looks amazing.
Brill video! What nail polish have you got on here Fleur? I love the colour! 💜 xxx
Hi! What nail polish are you wearing? I love it!!!
Love the stripes and dungarees combo ❤
I loved how chill this video was! And your review was soooo helpful - I was also hesitant to spring for another celeb range but now I totally want to try out a few pieces!
LOVED the casual setup! :)
Love your videos 😘
love it
You are my favorite You Tuber!!! ❤️❤️❤️🤗🤗
Love your nail color
£6&10 p&p !!!
I'm not camera ready......looks flippin gorgeous!
Loved the video!!
The Estée Lauder cushion what shade did you use please...it looked gorgeous -\nAs are you!!\nThanks for this,found it really helpful.
It wasn't Rihanna fans rushing to the stores to get some, it's the POC finally having their shades.
I know the foundation wasn't the right shade for you, but kinda wish you had kept it on! I've heard the sticks don't pair particularly well with the foundation formula and wanted to hear your thoughts on it aside from color match!
HI Fleur you look lovely!  Sprinklyofglitter tagged you in a baby name tag can you do it? Would love to hear your answers xo C
I definitely have my eye on a few of these products after watching this! Loved the set up of this video, Fleur!
I love the highlighter duo too. Not a big fan of cream products, but might give the cream blusher/highlighter and cream contour a go.
Iv been watching your videos for yours and i really love the old way of reviewing you have bought back, its felt more natural and like heres the products lets talk! Really enjoyed this video , hope you do many more like this!
you are literally glowing throughout your pregnancy!! <3
Rihanna did go an awesome job she SLAYED her products
Did you put blotting sheets in the wrong way around??
Love videos like this! Feels so down to earth and you look stunning!
Great review. I really enjoyed your thoughts and the makeup looked beautiful.
LOVE this more casual chatty video!! xx
Love the set up for this video! So 'at home'. Thanks for your review :)
Actual product review begins at 11:07. You're welcome. GEEZ! SMH
You look stunning!!! Natural beauty+pregnancy glow= beyond words beauty! Fleur you look lovely, and by far the best/most honest reviwe I've seen so far! Lots of love! Xx Tatty
Hi Fleur do you think the Fenty primer is better then the Two Faced Hangover one?
I love this sort of video! You're so gorgeous but I must say, I'm still not excited by this brand. It seems expensive but cheap...
I always trust your reviews... I tried the gloss on my hand at Sephora , the smell is amazing! It's so pretty.
This is my favourite video of yours in ages. It was a really professional review, IMO. I really like how you gave candid first impressions of the good and bad of each product, whether or not you ended up liking or disliking them. I feel like it was really honest and helpful! I agree with the others, as well: I'm not sure if you've changed your lighting or hair colour, but you're looking extra stunning in yourself here, too. Keep it up!
Great video! The casual vibe, the fact that you paid for the products, watching you apply it like in the old days, all of it! Loved it!
Honestly i loved this style of video!
I don't know if this is true but I have heard that the foundation oxidises to a few shades darker x
Hey Fleur! There have been too many beauty videos lately... At least for me... How about some bags? Shoes? Thanks!
Really love this review, very genuine.....more less planned videos in the future 👍👌
Your pregnancy really suits you! You're stunning! <3
Great video, I fully expected to hear you hating the products because I tend to associate you with higher end brands and products. I really love that you got excited as a consumer and I agree that your video seems to be the most unbiased so far! Love the laid back feel too! Xx
The blotting paper looks like rizla skins and a rolling machine for joints 😂😂😂😂
1) your excitement is contagious, 2) your make up afterwards looks BEAUT, 3) girl, that t-shirt and dungarees are a LOOK
dont think u knew how to pull the blotting paper out because ive seen others do it just fine ..
Where are your dungarees from? x
Loved this video. Loved how long it was and informal. Just chilling it with a friend style.
you literally have a holiday glow with this ! <3
great review. really thorough and well-explained. your word choice is so specific and accurate. keep it up!
I really liked this old style video with a classic review and try on. Looks great and now I would love to go out and pick up that lipgloss! :)
I realize this video was a little on the spontaneous side; that being said, I REALLY enjoyed it. It felt very authentic and had a nice, relaxing vibe. This video was a great example of how you don't need to go all out to make quality content. If the enthusiasm is there, the rest will follow. \nOn a slightly unrelated note, I don't know what it is about this particular video, but you really looked like Hannah in some parts of it. I've never really thought that before. Obviously, I've noticed the familial similarities, but I've never looked at the both of you together and thought, twin moment. For the record, that was meant to be a compliment. You both are beautiful gals!
Really love this style of video, Fleur! Please do more first impression/live haul type videos. xx
Loved this video Fleur! I find that I prefer videos like this (you called it raw). I like it without a studio or studio lighting etc. It feels more natural and less produced and therefore more real. I hope more youtubers go back to this style of video. I want to feel like a friend is telling me about products, not selling me some on HSN. Great job and you look fab!
Fleur, do you still have the London apartment?
LOVE this style of video! You're glowing and look absolutely stunning!!!
I don't think I'm going to indulge in this line myself, but it does look lovely. And I loved the more relaxed, hands-on review style -- both informative and casual, like a (circumstantially one-sided) conversation with a friend!
Might have to get the lip gloss!!
What's your nail color? It's so pretty!
Love this - you should do more first impression videos!
Totally random, but what colour / brand nail polish are you wearing??? Its gorgeous!! x
please do more first impressions just like this! casual, honest, no big production required, just a good solid chat... loved it!
Your skin looks incredible!! Please please do a cushion foundation best and worst! X
The contour colour looks amazing on you!
I'm glad u gave it a good review! I wasn't hyped about the line either BUT once I found out what was in the range, my interest was peaked! I only purchased the lippie and primer. They were out of my foundation and I can't buy anymore highlighters until I've used up what I have. Seriously, how many do u actually need?!?! Ultimately, I'm pleased to see that u liked it bcuz as a black woman, the range of foundations for us is  UNHEARD OF. We still don't have a STRONG market catering to us and our beauty with ALL its many shades. So, I think THAT is really what the hype was about. Black women/girls felt like, FINALLY, someone thought exclusively about US! It's not so much about Riyanna (did I spell that right?) and if my Caucasian, and Asian sisters don't understand that, then you've missed the whole point. #bravo Fleur!
Loved the style of this vid xx
I feel like you match exactly my colouring! Hope you get to try the foundation in the right shade one day
Loved the style of this video, very natural X x
Tear the blotting paper against the blade from one side to the other instead of ripping it :)
Love this video Fleur! So different for you, in a good way 😊 you also look absolutely beautiful! X
Are you going to get a foundation that matches for a second review?
Oh my goodness I love love loved this video! I enjoyed the more relaxed vibe you had going on and you are looking so beautiful. Love to you, Mike & all your fur children! Xx
I hope your read this, but I'm in love with your tragus piercing. Would you mind sharing where you got it? It's so cute!
Your skin looks amazing 😍 pregnancy is really working for you! Are you going to try another shade of foundation? Would be good to hear your opinion of your shade, also love the casualness to the video xxx
I wish you used the white because I haven't seen a review with it yet
very nice video, good review :)
your skin looks amazing in this Fleur! <3
You should never buy makeup online , you should always try it first on your face (physically go to the shop)  , because when you buy online it always ends up being lighter or darker in real life.
I really appreciate your review and POV!
I have never been drawn to packaging. I don't get that. When shopping for make-up I don't look at packaging at all. Coz what does it help when the product itself is sh**?
Loved this video!! I would have thought, though, that this brand was made by the same guys who did Kim K's line!  I dunno if I'm too sold on many of the products -- I might try the highlighter!
Love the autheticity, you are for sure the best looking wife doing stuff around the house 😉 love your videos and I love the pregnany content and home vlogs/weekend vlogs with mike the most 😊 👫🐕💖
I love how realistic you are in the video & review
Fleur, I love how your initial fail of not attending the party is turning out. This video with you all excited about trying new products is lovely to watch, you look absolutely stunning, and your review is the one I'll trust on this range. Sending love ♥
do you put on liquid foundation before putting on the Estée Lauder powder? And is it the Estée Lauder double wear cushion bb you used? X
Finally someone who doesn't like trophy wife! Looks like a sparkly golden shower on people's face
Yeah! Everything in focus! Please always film this way. Brilliant x
Thats it.. I'm buying me some Fenty Beauty!! lol
You're so pretty💕
the blotting paper packaging is such a cool idea! i just wish it worked! great video! xo from my channel to your’s <3
The products are interesting but that blotting of paper would probably be a no go for me! ❤️\nYou definitely have that pregnancy glow! 😃
I wanted to say thank you for doing this!  A lot of vloggers who are not women of color are turning their noses up at this. Thank you for doing this for your colorful audience!
what shade are you in estee lauder double wear cushion?
Which colour you have in the Estee lauder cushion foundation .😄
i've missed the tutorials ! :)
Really REALLY loved this style of video, including the natural looking lighting. It seemed very spare of the moment and I got the feeling you weren't planning on putting the makeup on to start with. Something about it just seems so natural and friendly (not saying you aren't always friendly 😁) keep them coming and I hope you are keeping well xxx
Fleur's reviews are the best reviews 💕

Burrowing sea urchins don't bite they can only chew Thrue Rock and hard surfaces and there bites feels like it tickles
Coyote is so cute I love him😍💜
In Cuba their are a lot
Kind words of the day:  \nI hope you don't have a crab in your butt, buddy. -Coyote Peterson
he was sticking his middle finger xD
The shrimp looks like the shrimp guy that cleans everything from Nemo
I didn't see a crab
5:17 he sounds like pleakley from Lilo and stitch when his voice changed lool 😆😆\n\nBut interesting video tho 👌🏽 Hawaii is such a beautiful place i wanna go so bad!
4:35 Id laugh if that wasn't a black sea cucumber
the phrase sea urchin heaven reminds me of a trip to Costa Rica. We went to a black sand beach that I assume was once part of a lava flow. The entire sea floor off the beach was solid black lava rock. Thank goodness I was snorkeling on the surface and not stepping on the rocks because every ~2 inches there was a sea urchin. The entire sea floor was covered in bore pockets with a black/deep purple urchin in every one. It was so awesome to see and I wanted to share this because I think that beach was the best place to call a sea urchin heaven
If I got stung by a sea urchin or a bee or ANYTHING I would screech until my lungs shrivel up and shatter
i saw a little tiny fish blending in with the rocks in the middle of the two borrowing urchins at 12:41 to 12:43 under the rocks
I have tried sea erchin and it tastes so strange. It tastes very fishy and a bit salty
the shots throughout the video were beautiful
it is a kind of camaflosh shrimd
omg he was so lit ab that shrimp
The largest island ever is called Frasers island located in Australia. I think. And is about 600 or something kilometres wide.
Been here before 1M. Love you bro!!!!💯💯💯
0:30 no I think of the kpop group winner
you should do a video on nedles plant sting.
I'm gonna keep it partially in the water \n*several feet out of the water*
I like your videos
Coyote: amazed by a shrimp\nMe: munching on them while i watch him\nCoyote: i wonder what species it is\nMe: i wonder if its edible
Ive been stung by Vana (sea urchin) a lot, especially around 6 or 7. I love when the Vana just crawls around my hand it tickles
Wow that is hard
You have been through so much pain and finnaly 8MIL congratiolations (sorry if i spelled it wrong)
The Hawaiian name for sea urchin is wana (pronounced va-na)
I appreciate the captions, it's extremely rare that people take the time to caption their videos!

5:27 for a clear picture of shrimp
You should feature mantis shrimp in a future video! They're my favorite sea animals
Banded Coral Shrimp was the first time Mark got something right that Coyote didn't.

Can't wait untill you get the diamond play button!!
This is what I wonder why does he bring jeans and good shirts and sweaters if he knows he is going to get all wet
I love looking for animales
Why does he still not have a T.V channel?
Where can I find that joke about the body
I'm so glad you uploaded this. Norm is one of my favorite comedians. I think his work, though underrated, is genius.
Love norm, like your vids, felt this was a weak one as i didnt really learn how/why norm is a genius past He's brilliant because he's smart. Just felt like a lot was left on the table. Maybe ill like it more when I come across it again in a year or two :)
Similar commitment to their own personal comedy: John Roderick and Merlin Mann
This guy sounds just like Lagos Cargo
Maybe I'm one of the people who doesn't find him funny. Where's the joke
Could you do a video on howard stern?
I instantly recognized that the outtro music was a remix of mozarts requiem (lacrimosa) ^^
Wow. He just seems like an asshole
Wow. I went through that video for 7 minutes listening with mild amusement and thinking He really does sound like a comic genius, but one that isn't quite my taste. Then that last punchline hit me. It's taken me 10 minutes to stop laughing long enough to write this comment.
I like listen to you advertize to me sooooo much more than that Karly Kloss chick who uses WIX....and its easy to use and blah blah blah. Nerdwriter!
I _knew_ about Norm Macdonald but honestly had never seen his comedy. Thank you, again, Nerdwriter, for bringing something new (a perspective, an interest) into my life. I really like Norm's sense of humor, so now I've got to check out more. Where should I start - some comedy special, perhaps? I think I heard he has a podcast and I listen to podcasts daily so that might be an easy introduction.
Ah, the moth joke...one of my favorites.
RIP Norm. One of the greats.
I discovered that we don't have a similar sense of humour...
Norm is just ok. This video proved that.
I would love to hear your thoughts on Stewart Lee
Well... as a non american I didn't get any of his humour  :/
I know I dont like his style, because I didnt laugh at one thing in this video.
Why am I watching a video on Norm Macdonald when I can watch brokeback mountain and watch a cock slip into some guys hot beautiful asshole
Thank you! Norm's comedy is so smart it gives me chills. Great video.
I wonder where he got the idea to intersperse the moth joke throughout the whole video
Thanks for highlighting his talent. I always wondered about him. Never understood why he was in films and tv shows.
Thank you for this nerdwriter. Excellent analysis. Norm is one of the greats.
Not even being funny here but Norm MacDonald saved my life.  Read my heart-felt open thank you letter to him on twitter @bonkers_doozy
I'm so glad I found this video. I didn't know norm. Now I love him
Norm MacDonald is like cringe comedy without comedy. Just cringe
I guess I have a different sense of humor cause I didn't even giggle at this guys jokes. To each their own
Learned nothing apart from the fact that Norm MacDonald exists
My coworkers brother worked for snl and said that norm had a habit of pissing in empty beer bottles around his apartment. It was common knowledge that if you were at norms apartment you should never put your beer down.
Norm is a genius.  Well made.
Not once did I laugh. Not sure if it's me or the comedian.
Norm is one of those comics whose jokes you remember, but not the kind of comic whose jokes smart people try to repeat to other people, rather you take them and show them Norm telling that joke.
You should do a video on Stewart Lee, he's probably the king of intellectual comedians.
This video should be titled, In Defense of Dad Jokes
Look at this delusional poster trying to sell Alex Jones as a comic genius. No, Hicks is a very talented voice actor, but he had to mimic standups like George Carlin and Sam Kinnison. Now he mimics Rush Limbaugh. He was a nobody before his CIA handler Frank Gannon took him to England to bash America (like Rich Hall later did). All this Hicks was a legend stuff started after his conversion to Alex Jones was exposed.
My gosh, He sounds like Colonel Sanders. The best actor to portray him, without a doubt. He personified him so well.
Great vid - great timing. I just watched his new special. He really comes out swinging. Loved the kind of cold open he did. Original. \n\nListen, have you seen Legion yet?  It will inspire you to write. The point of view study, the production design, the lighting! It is so up your alley -or so it seems to me. I really don't know you all that well.\n\nHere's to inspiration! Huzzah.
It's great to see this appreciation of Norm's comedy.  In my opinion, Norm is the greatest living comedian.  Thanks so much for this.
You must make a video talking about Memento!!
I'm going to force my sister and brother-in-law to sit down and watch this with me. I have a hard time convincing certain people that Norm MacDonald is the funniest person who has ever existed.
Hey man! Something about The Sopranos or Gandolfini would be much appreciated.
Funniest man on earth. My hero!!!
you don't consider Bill Burr a famous comedian !
I don't see a sophisticated joke, I see a guy just having a kinda funny dad joke punchline, and then just making up a bunch of shit in the middle. Pretty fucking awful
Norm you know damn well you don't belong on the trending page in 2018...but damn it you're my favorite anyway...enjoy your has browns hank chuckowksi...
Interesting style (the handwritten thing)
I heard he's a real jerk!
Thank god for the hatchery.
WOW...this was not a paid advertisement at all!
he's the funniest man of all time
Please add subtitles to your videos, my english lessining is not so good. \nHello from Brazil!
First vhs I ever purchased was dirty work
Thank God for the Hatchery!
You can't talk me into thinking someone is funny. Patrice O'Neal, now he was Funny! Maybe even an actual comedic genius.
I have never thought he was funny but that moth joke was! \nEveryone, please watch my tiny nature videos. There is no talking in them. Shhh!
Fantastic video! Produced exceptionally well. And, about one of my favorite comics. 5/5
why don't just suck norm macdonalds dick already
I'm so fucking fed up of being mediocre.
So Norm is basically a french canadian comedian...good to know :)
Norm and Prestige are my two favourite things of all time. I approve this channel - subscribing now.
You've become quite adept at exposing the nuances of comedians jokes; how long before you start revealing magicians tricks?\nAlso, congratulations on how professionally formulaic your pauses and emotional cues are.
PLEASE WATCH MY VIDEOS . ILL BE CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST SOON AND WOULD APPRECIATE SOME SUB SCRIBERS to join me onmy trip through nepaul
It's true he despises meta-comedy or anti-comedy but he still dabbles on occasion. I remember on the Sports Show he had he told one of the best meta jokes I've ever heard (and I'm no fan of the genre myself either) when he said: the producers tell me I have to tell more meta jokes, so... there ya go. after that one, which is pretty much perfect, I knew I never needed to hear a meta joke again because that's got to be as good as they can get.
i don't think he's kidding about the murders
I read this title and thought to myself You're goddamn right he is
Jesus christ the last thing i wanna hear is someone try to explain why something is funny:(
Rolling Stone did an article somewhat recently ranking every SNL cast member in history, and Norm ended up near the bottom of the list. That was the last Rolling Stone article I ever read.
My favorite Norm joke is actually when Olympic snowboarder Gretchen Bleiler was on Conan (Nov. 25th, 2009) setting up a clip of a *very difficult* trick she was attempting to do. Conan played the clip and it showed a huge wipeout. When the clip ended and the camera came back to the guests, Norm said: That actually looked kinda easy. I haven't stopped laughing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akslq2T7Kfg
Norm is the funniest man alive and  quite likely who ever lived.
i dont understand why people need a whole video analyzing why something is good
Norm is comedy's mad god.
Using the moth joke on Conan was great. It was the joke that made me love him and look forward to everything he did on Conan.
I've never been so excited to click a Nerdwriter video, and to have my all-time favorite joke, Norm's telling of The Moth Joke featured throughout, I'm ecstatic.
The 12 minute joke is basically British stand up format
What's the music at the end???
Dang you already got 257,000 views. Norm is timeless! This is by far the best analysis of Norm Macdonald's comedy.
No mention of Norm's comedic timing? His timing is ridiculously spot on.
Hate channels like this. Go make something yourself. Stop piggybacking on greatness
Thank you for making this.
I met this man In a 5 star hotel lounge in Zurich
Thanks to you, I'll give this dude another try
good video but the moth joke is completely lost when it's cut it into several 20-second segments
He reminds me of Stewart Lee. Everyone give him a YouTube. He's very clever.
Norm Macdonald is one of the funniest people I know. Discover one of his finest moments of genius, and watch him purposely bomb using pre world war II jokes on the Bob Saget roast while all the other comedians are completely losing it.
OK, I have to admit. I watch your video and think Well? Why I will like if I didn`t know or like this Norm-guy? Beside, you didn`t defend him very well, look like he is bad comic  guy that you like and want to justify that to someone. So. I go watch some think of this fellow and, man... Hilarious. Then, I return to like your video. Thanks.
If I was a girl,  I would flash him at his stand up shows.
Isn't Mike Tyson's Mystery Tea a shaggy dog story
Monty Python next?
Ugh. Norm MacDonald sucks.
It's weird to know that he voices a talking pigeon on the Mike Tyson Mysteries show. Then again, it totally makes sense.
Hiii ! It's Veronika! 🌻
norm is god.
Norm: 9/11 HAHAHAHA
this is pretty pretentious
Normie Normie Normie..
Norm McNaldo
He's disturbing
Normies McDonald's
DO George Carlin!!!!!!
Love that an unassuming Brit who looks like the only party he ever attended was at a chemistry frat cant stop marveling us with the most beautiful electronic music on the planet.
Finally! Best part of his Boiler Room Reykjavik set in my opinion
The xx - On Hold (Lit Version)

beware of the church of scientology, it is an evil cult who want to ruin your life and steal your money, your life is at risk if you involve yourself with this organisation\nwatch this film for the truth about scientology\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6oYaMtJln0&t=73s
Reminiscent of The Mackenzie feat. Jessy - Innocence. But I don't expect Jamie to be aware of 90's Belgian dance music.
my type of music
Just when i was losing hope on modern mainstream dance music this banger pops up (Jamie XX LAD)
wow ! jamie you are so ...
Aaaaah ❤
when is this going to be on spotify? :'(
With the new release of their new album and their Glastonbury set this year. The XX have been the soundtrack to my summer.
You're the fucking man Jamie.
Hmmmm damn this tracks pure bliss. The XX and Jamie haven't made a single bad song or track 🤗👐👐
Don't mind me, just here before this explodes! 😅
I love how basically all he did was use the ambience and bass of the original and its still sick
Thank you Jamie for all the music you make it honestly makes my day 100x better! I love you Jamie, Romy, And Oliver you guys are the best!
Listened to this during his boiler set, truly stunning! Check it out if you haven't already
Where does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\n\nDare me to, dare me to\n\nWhere does it stop, where does it stop\nWhere do you dare me to (draw the line)?\nYou've got the body, you've got the body\nYou've got the body, you've got the body
just realised the logo for the XX is the same as the symbol for nihilism.  gj XX if it was ur intention.
The video is as good as the music
Shit sold out already??? Please make more, the world needs more of this
Can't say I thought I would see dabbing in an xx video 😅

Best song in his reykjavik boiler room set...
If i get it right a clip by Alasdair McLellan is young and beautiful people kissing each other all day long... all the time ? And partying on this one
I've been listening to you guys from the beginning and knew you'd blow up one day!!!! I love and adore your music! It's gotten me through dark times and made the bright times seem infinite! THANK YOU AND NEVER STOP, PLEEEASE!!!!
my head is about to explode from this perfect masterpiece, Jamie xx I fucking love you

Jamie xx can make the already good songs sounds even better. Such a genius!
It shouldn't never end...

Jamie XX - On Hold (Jamie XX Remix)
STOP BEING SO GODDAMN FUNNY YOU DELIGHTFUL HUMAN BEING!!!
I don't wanna do this one
I'm tired but nice vid make more plz thx
i know she's joking around but she actually looks great! ❤
I think Ima wear the 5th one \nI think it will fit me well
You could definitely be a model you're gorgeous and you looked great in every one of the outfits 👑
Grace we get it you look cute in everything
I DIED AT CASUAL FRIDAY😭😭😭😭😭❤️
You're not a doctor
Grace I luv ya but ya forty as fuck.\nFor sure let's let the kids handle 1st period issues. Jk jk
Grace's legs on the Rock Princess look!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO GOOD
Chester see, come back and get yo pants
Real talk where was the skirt from in the 3rd outfit I love it
I actually like the outfits... well done Grace. I flipping love you.🙌🏼
these are all cute as hell but like I can't wear any of them other than the pant suit because of damn dress code smh
Please do more of these!! In any way shape or form, I love your fashion videos
The you're not a doctor part made me bust up laughing😂😂😂😂
The green one had a Riddler vibe lol
I'm home-schooled so pajamas everyday!\n(Also, that green pants suit is giving me INSANE Onceler vibes.)
To make the androgynous look complete, you should wear either a knit stocking cap or a baseball cap with your hair stuffed up inside it. Or cut it short like Ellen (or shave your head completely, if you *really* want to commit to the look).   ;-)
Grace legit looks amazing in all of these 😂❤️
to be serious for a second, what is this back to school outfit thing about? I mean why don't you  wear the same shit you wore in summer? and if the first day of school is a little colder then wear something warmer than last week.
What about kids who go to school who have to wear uniform?
WOULD 100% WEAR EACH OF THOSE OUTFITS DO MORE OF THESE
2:05 SHE'S WEARING KRISTEN'S MERCH!!!!😱😱😍😂 AND GRACE IS ONE OF KRISTEN'S FAV YOUTUBERS!!
outfit 4 brings out the gay in me
DRESS CODE
these videos are ok
Quit because miniskirt feeling bad
😂
what an icon
Uncensored Version Plz!
11/10
:v I have uniforms...
leprechaun professional
Lol so good.
this is me leaving a comment down below
He Never Came Back should be the title of your next book.
this was by far top 5 itsgrace videos I've ever seen lmao
I get the comedic sense of this video, but in all seriousness... you'd make a great fashion blogger. I was expecting parody outfits, but these actually look great!\nPS. Someone get this girl a Dior ad so she can rock a pantsuit in next month's Vogue!
Only one of those outfits was appropriate dress for my school
Grace is literally such a catch
but for real she looked hot af as a rock princess
I love how she's making fun of all the serious back to school videos on youtube 😂😂
With the way schools have been lately, the outfit with the skirt or the long shirt will not fly. I have no problems with it, but again some schools are ran by sexist dicks and those outfits would get a young lady kicked out.
Can I be fashionably awkward like you?
Omg number five I can't💀
I can't wear any of these at my school
You are aging so GRACEfully
The slow angles and up do! DANG!
I was wearing my Friday casual as well, so I totally had to change. I was going to be popular this year. You ruined my Friday and my life ...... Bitch!!\n\nOh by the way, that outfit makes you look fat
How did you make this funny and ironic and inspirational at the same time? \nI love you Grace <3
Saw his reflection in the glass door and I have to ask, was he filming this wearing nothing but his boxers?
why are these all outfits i would wear tho omg
Green pantsuit is like a combo of Hillary Clinton and heather duke hhhahaha
love the I feel weird shirt
Why isn't grace a model !!!!
She is as hip as I want my aunt to be
I love how the guy's face just keeps zooming in.
Why is no one talking about outfit #4? GRACE LOOKS BOMB i love it and I might try it for school actually 💯💯
How did grace pull off all of these outfits???😵
Yaaas grace you should wear that green suit to a red carpet or something
1. Please do a part two\n2. Brooks' comments are everything\n3. Grace is hot... like really hot
Grace you are honestly the funniest 😂
He never came back.
You are so darn beautiful
Less than 100k views in 24 hrs? Uh-oh Grace 😕
That first outfit tho.  Damn Grace, stop being so damn cute.
the most horrible outfits I have ever seen. the best one was the one she was wearing for the introduction and the conclusion of the video
I lik\ne it, please do more
I'm really ill and laughing hurts but I laughed at this. Couldn't hold it back.
The outfits are like actually really cute though
Great video! Also, can your next video be about Halloween costume ideas for your dog? And then put Goose in those Halloween costumes? I really just want to see Goose wearing different outfits. Please feature Goose more in your videos 🤷🏻‍♀️🐶
I think you'd make an awesome found footage horror/comedy movie.
I liked this video.
I love this video!!
Sexy Leprechaun was a good look.
Am I the only one who was focusing on the fact that the green outfit is the only one that would pass dress code?
where is the 3rd skirt from
It looks like you have 2 Doritos sticking out of shirt 😂
You look very Claire Dunphy in that green suit 🙃
My back to school look was sweat pants and a sweatshirt, the exact thing I wear all year
I met Grace at Vidcon in Australia and SHE WAS SO NICE AND AMAZING AND SHE SIGNED HER BOOK THAT I BOUGHT UPSIDE DOWN 😂😂😂
2:02\nI love that Grace keeps her board games in the fire place. I don't know why but that just feels very on-brand for Grace.
Yes helbig get it
True fashion icon.

Your hair is so beautiful just the way it is.  Don't dye it blue or any other color.  It is so beautiful just like it is.
I really love your makeup colors! So pretty!
now that she and her boothang are broken up she will change up her hair... lol when two videos ago she said she loveeesss her hair lol its just something i noticed, not that theres something wong its her hair.
Omg BRUSHES! I barely have any and that box was a dream of them lol.
When Carli fed the deer 🦌 I instantly thought of Snow White lol ❤️
Yes do the blue !!!!
Happy you're back. Special request PLEASE Birthday looks. #libra #oct4

Try a wig before committing! I mean you are gorgeous regardless but why go through the process if you don't like it. I love love love you! Positive vibes sent your way❤️
I love your cats!! Have you ever thought of doing a house tour?
Don't do blue when it fades it looks greenish. Do purple. I like the N Rage plum purple. It's a demi and already has the developer included. My hair turned out dark purple and it looks beautiful in the sun. It has now faded to a medium purple 😁. The one n only brand is also good. In pure purple
This is cute i miss my bestie😣
The deer and kitties were my fav....too cute
Love that she buys normal items and not only designer! Real down to earth girl
She likes tomatoes idk why that made me laugh so much 😂😭😭
thumbs up if you would like to see a video on Carli's filming/beauty room?!
Can you do a fenty make up review pls
What! I thought you had lipstick in the first clip 🙈 you are sooo beautiful! ♥️
I'm so sad.. You can hear sadness in her voice... 💔💔
I love Carli so much bc she always wears her shirts down to do her makeup but always makes sure we know i'm wearing a shirt by the way she's adorable 💖
Yes do the blue/black hair!!
Go blue!! Arctic fox is by far the best colouring product to use
Hope whatever you are going through gets better! Love you Carli! Stay strong 💕 btw it took me a while to realize that at the beginning of the video you are wearing a headband, lol I thought they were space buns 😂
Go navy blue!  Yay omggg

Please watch the documentary True cost it is eye opening about the disagerous effects of fast fashion. Fast fashion is an exploitative industry that involves Slave child labour- not to mention the negative environmental impact. I love you Carli and know you're an intelligent human being becoming a vegan. Please research this topic because I think it will be eye opening.
Keep your chin up, we all love you and your videos legit make my day!
Hiiii you look absolutely amazing in this vid! Beautiful! Your make up is absolutely flawlesssssss! ❤️❤️ Xx

When white girls drink alcohol and turn black 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢

YES GIRL BLUE
I need that limo playlist omg
Yes navy hair!!
Boobs 😎😎😎😎😎
I guess this is typical for many Americans... so many clothes and awesome things, all stacked in massive, entire-floor closets, all that for wearing sweats and gym-wear everyday... Like why do you buy so much of this stuff if you don't go anywhere, and when you do, you end up in a hoodie, like i so don't get it :\
Im actually crying ive watched her since day one and im scared something is up between her and brett and that would break my heart 😞 i saw his vlog too and they both look heartbroken 😞
I don't think you should die your hair but why don't you cut it? It is so long and beautiful but you would look so good with shorter hair!
I cant wait for the maverick play button
I think u and Lydia should do the eat it or wear it challenge x
I'm proud to say that I'm one of the Logangs who subscribed to Logan's channel
my birthday was the same day that you were celebrating your 1 year of vlogging and I thought it was so cool that it was the same day. it made me really happy because I love you and the logang and mavericks :) <3
Except the latch was clearly opened, and you clearly closed it right in front of the camera.
I am sure you won't reach 50 million sub so congrats on last gift from YouTube.

Obviously you hit 10million in a short time . Half if us are probably watching cause your name is in the title .  I mean your Logan Paul.
You didn't change shit.
Hey I'm Morgan, I'm in my 1st year of middle school. I'm really short and I get bullied over it. And I need some advice. Because  it is really starting to bother me. So can you help me???

Yaya you got the golden play butten
The whole time I was thinking Logan was going to smash the play button like a plate.
Logan i love your content been fan for 323 days been counting! 365
Make a merch of color changing when you roll it down it will be maverick and when you roll it up it will say logang\nLike if you agree😊
The title is pretty arrogant
As he is filming it's not 365 days yet
Hey Logan I just wanted to say congratulations for hitting ten mil also if been a subscriber since 250k
logan i love you more that my famili
You, and your faggot ass brother turned YouTube into cancer.
Even is like my friend lee
When it's Evans big day you should do the same thing to him!
I gate logab Paul iwisg he never existed.hope u die soon
Logan: I wanna open this box if it's the last thing I do. \n\n\nEvan: ......Not if you die first\n\n\nLogan: you gud bro?
congrats Logan, good luck on 50 million you can do it
My goal is to hit 50 mill subs in two years😂😂
HOW LOGAN PAUL CHANGED YOUTUBE FOREVER! How narcissistic can someone be?
I would've hid it in one of the backpacks
When he gets to 50, he getting a Maverick play button
Dude, as of today(9/16/2017) you have more subscribers than there are _PEOPLE_ in 44 out of 50 states in the country. Only 6(California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania) have more, and once you reach 13 million you will have more than Pennsylvania and Illinois as well. That's freaking crazy.
You used to have meaningful content. I used to watch you when you bearly started your vlogs on youtube. Now its all just breaking things and stupid drama. Why did you take the easy route and started making content for 12 year olds just for views?
Don't let Evan use a axe ever again
Best way to pen a diamond  play button
I wish all had 3 xl shirt for big people
IISuperwomanII better step it up because Logan is on his way to 12 milli
I saw beer in his fridge.
I couldn't get the murch i was busy getting hit by hurricane irma
What's the difference between Logan Paul and Hitler \n\n\nHitler know when to kill himself
Logan is a misgendered queer that deserves to die and sent to the eternal abyss along with his mindless pre pubescent brain dead teenager fans
YASSS logan 11mill piss  of Evan \n\n\n\nNO hate to logan or Evan
You should sub to me :)
Vlogang where you at\nGet it
It took Logan less than a year to hit 10 mill and it took jake like about 3 or 4 years to hit 10 mill
great job of get your diamond play button
Congrats on 11,000,000 million subscribes and 365 is SAVAGE LOGANG 4 LIFE!!!!!

The end got me 😂
thank you for this. i needed a good laugh. so happy I'm an android user.
#2NewColorsYou Can't, and Afford It
Got an apple ad before this
Did Sony get a iPhone X early to make the emoji movie?
I would rather buy the whole Jake Paul mercy than buy the iPhone X 👀
Why did I get a notification for this today?
I was looking forward to this!!!
I like on the xbox one x is cheaper than the emoji machine.. i said xbox one x cuz it has x like iphone x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKill me plz
Can't wait for this. I want to die. SUCK MY SOUL BE WITCHED PHO E (get it? Hoe pho e?)
Apple has been behind the game for years people are so excited about this new this the iPhone does then I sit there and go I've had that for years
There has not been any true innovation at apple since Steve passed away.  I am keeping my iPhone 7 for an another year maybe two.
the new Iphone X ! everything that samgsung already had (but the emoji thing.... EMOJIS ARE DUMB)
great Jobs, Apple. Keep up the good work.\nMini iPad Mini: thanks for the shout out Reese I appreciate it
The iPhone x comes in 2 colors\n\nYou can't\nAnd \nafford it\n\ntrue colors
Thank you for your life juice
It comes in two colors, breakable glass and more breakable glass
I love the Afford It color
Just take my money Apple!!!
thank for your life juice lol
Let's make a joke\n\n\n\n\n\niPhone X
This phone is too fucking expensive and Steve Jobs is a retarded asshole
There's a new emoji on the iPhone X, a fedora emoji. It's gonna be featured in the emoji movie 2. Em'oji Movie
Who just got a notification for this just now

I thought Apple just puts U2 in your phone without consent. Right?!
You see now it's $800
WHY ISN'T THIS VIRAL YET
They are gonna remove the buttons and the speaker. The tapic engine 3 will be the new speaker
you forgot to add that theres no more basic bitch color
What you think Steve Jobs will do after seeing the new iPhones ?
iPhones are for girls and faggots as fashion accessories and for stupid people who know nothing about technology.
Beacuse of you Jack I'm gonna go up to the I phone store and ask for my very own I Phone X. 😶😯😐😘😂😄☺😘😉😵+📱=☺📱☺📱
The best paraody I have seen so far on the iPhone X!!!! Great Job!!!
Yep,sums it up about right!
The real question is, where is the 9?
Still going to buy it
Great video! Apple really fucking piss me off because they bring these new phones out, within a 6 month period before the previous one,  which have no fucking differences between them whatsoever, except maybe a couple more pixels for $100 more.
They get more and more gimmick
Y they make this?
My two favorite colors; you can't + afford it. Will be buying two of each.
The X is for Xpensive
I guess Tim OVER COOKED IT
Apple is a joke
And guess who is going to buy it anyway...
Welcome to apple - We just make bigger phones with different software
I didn't know this was jack but I thought it sounded like him then I looked at the channel and it was him 😂😂
Previous iPhones - fingerprint\niPhone X - face scan\niPhone (2018) - ass scan
One more thing....
I can't stop fucking laughing bro in dying
When you said that part about the switch I was so happy
The 1st iPhone Made More Sense Than The iPhone X
Deserves to be #1 on trending
iPhone X No Home Button who needs it anyways?! \nIPhone XX No turn off button who needs to turn off there phone? \nIPhone XXX No Charger hole who needs to charge their phone? \nIPhone XXXX No Apps just call and message\niPhone XXXXX No volume button just look at the phone \niPhone XXXXXX No screen \nBuy it here on Amazon or eBay 😁
iphone users be salty lol
So lame
facial recognition got a hit
Last sentence is tru sentence
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 BRAVO!! BRAVO!
So accurate, seriously that explanation of the iPhone 8 is perfect.
Apple died. Now they just make over priced slabs of glass that basically do the exact same thing the older models do. So what's the point of wasting 1k when you can get an older model for less than half the price that basically does the same thing without all the extra stuff?
😂😂😂 No but Seriously... the 8, (7S), will most likely be my Last iPhone. It was a good run, but forget Face ID. A prosecutor would  need a Warrant for the information we voluntarily give our phones.
 You can't and Afford it \n😂😂😂
I am buying iphone x in about a month so beaaaach
At least we know theres not gonna be a nine...\n\n\n\n\nBecause 7 ate 9 😉
You can't, and afford it. I'm crying
the next iPhone will be 1,000,000 and will be implemented into your fucking brain
I own Apple products but got damn Apple do something new! This parody is so true.
In Canada the iPhone is usually 1000
I like the afford it color better
Comes in two colors you can't and afford it 😂😂 you got me FU
The iPhone 8 should of been called iPhone 7S and replace IPhone X with IPhone 8
Samsung removed the home button aswell but kept it inside of the phone touch home button and iris/face unlock.
Little gifts for your friends, family or for yourself at www.thelogicase.com
the iphone xD\nnow with even more funny random xD content.
I would pay $1000 for a version that doesn't support emojis
This is funny, but I will still be getting the X
Steve - Respect. Hope in that insane society we live have the wisdom to keep myself healthy & in shape like you did.
The chest cam looks really good!
Brutal stage! I was absolutely knackered last time I rode the black, blowing out my arse haha. 😂
Damn Steve has some good lines
Sick trail🤘
Oi Steve 👌
awesome👏👌
Cool vid Ben. Fun to watch and makes me want to go back to Laggan. :-)
Damn Cathro, nice preview.  I feel like you filled the time really well man, only thing I didn't like was you worrying about what you were talking about cus it was solid.
What's the best way to get sponsored or interest from a company?
Dropper cable lose on the bars?
Steves dam quick how the hell do you manage to speak that blacks sick satchet of carp lol wtf
that's going to be a quagmire if you are near the end of the que
Short?  We need a full length film of this !!!
This is one of those few times where I happily exclaim, Make it 4hours long, Make it a series, Make it a Mini-Series!!  This collaboration of Blade Runner and Shinichiro Watanabe is just too perfect to simply condense it into a short film...
ｍｏｒｅ　ｈｕｍａｎ　ｔｈａｎ　ｈｕｍａｎ
See you space blade runner...
By Shinichiro Watanabe! Holy shit fuck the new movie i want the anime version :D
this is probably gonna turn out better then the new movie
Anime, cyberpunk and FlyLo, as if that isn't the best combination
This looks pretty awesome, and is immediately on top of my must-watch list.
I hope it's longer than 5 minutes.
I'm glad they put subtitles on, because I don't know Japanese...
Also, is it just me, or doesn't those animation sheets look pretty massive in physical scale compared with most other standard animation paper? Or is it to accomodate more detailed drawings for theatrical cinemascope animations?
I never asked for this...but I'm glad.
I need a background of the girl at 1:01
I'm freaking stoked about this. This is going to be amazing.
Good to see the world of BR coming back to life again.
hopefully this gets Subbed and sony doesn't fuck over everyone who doesn't know japanese who wants to watch it.
They could expand this into a 26 episode series, it'd definitely find a market.
OH WOW! Something decent will come out of this sh*t movie sequel.
how long will this be?
QUERO
This looks like Under the Dog but good.
This is the best news I've heard in a while
Warner Bros USA olease put the anime in the home video release
idk if the anime short version are good or bad, but if is good, i hope they make it into featrue film.
Been waiting for this since 1984 when I first got into anime, and Shinichirō Watanabe is directing! ^_^
Holy shit this is perfect. I really hope we get to see more stories from this world in different formats.
I love anything Watanabe related, it's gonna be amazing <3
impresionante
POPOLA CONFIRMED\nhttps://youtu.be/924olvhb2pU?t=61
Deckard and Roy, Eiffel tower, NOW!
¡Bravo, bravo! ¡Qué ganas de verlo! Muero de felicidad.
YES\nYES\nYES PLEASE
This is awesome news.
see you space cowboy...
Oh yes
nice
製作時間…。_ﾛ(･ω･=) ｹｼｹｼ
渡辺監督なら観ないと！
WOW
ほほう
I wished we can Kickstart this for a whole mini-series.
I came. I saw. I came. What a lovely year for cyberpunk!
Hope the movie does well so hopefully we get a full blade runner universe with books, games and other media.
why dont make an anime series with this quality????? WHY WHY!!! ;)
Coming soon... How soon is soon? And when it arrives, HOW DO WE WATCH IT?! ... legally, that is...  I have gotten to the point where I refuse to pirate stuff...  :D
私の中で神格化された作品だけに、その続編というのは複雑な心境だ。コケるくらいなら最初から作らないでほしいという気持ちもある。果たして上手くいくかどうか・・・頼むぜ。
Looks like another Ghost in the Shell movie. Look i like Anime, but Blade Runner shouldnt turn into Anime. The *Live* action movie is a Masterpiece, turning this into Anime is really mediocre, maybe the style and Visuals will be pretty and awesome, like Akira. But where does the Lore fit? They also ruined Godzilla with the mediocre, bad Cgi Grootzilla movie...
So a black dude and a fucking chick, just LIKE everything else these days... PASS!
The freaking prices are absolutely ridiculous
Tati for President!!
🤔🤔🤔
You look stunning 💕💕💕💕💕
The foil eye shadow looks chunky, patchy an drying on you Tati.
SMASHING VIDEO!!!!!
Four eyeshadows palette is 75 not 95 on Sephora FYI
Regulate telescope account awgqw expect scary establishment faint.
And everyone complains about Natasha Denona palette prices. Holy hell!
Your eyes look INSANE today
U look gorgious ❤
any of you want to support each other and sub to each others channels? I sub back! plz let me know :))
I love this review Tati. I just got the powder, quad, foil, bronzer, highlighter and the black and cream duo. The quality is amazing! Can you do a tutorial with this eye? It is stunning!
I find it weird how you say its up there in price but dont you use the Sisley primer and other products that are way more than this??
I spend a lot of money on makeup, but never in my life would i ever spend $95 on an eyeshadow quad lol this collection is way too expensive
Tati. I would love to see you do more off brands like juvias place and other brands like that. Or like the glitters/shimmer from smolder cosmetics!!! Pleaseeee
I hate this eye makeup. The glitter looks so childish and messy
ok i was plucking my eyebrows while watching this and when you said that the burgundy quad was $95 i almost poked my eye out
the eye shadow quad is 75.  Which bronzer were you holding, java sun or saffron sun?
I like see you using the products, not just talking about them!❤
Love the eye look!!
Wow $95 for 4 friggin eyeshadows!!??? If I'm gonna spend that I rather spend a little more & get a Natasha D pallete!
Your eye look does look beautiful! But I would never purchase those 2 colors together for that price.
I want that freaking foil but not for 40😑
I hope you at least get some free cosmetic bag or something...I love you TATI.
Not hot at all 😪😡
Tati you have to tell us where you get your hand mirrors from....!!!!
Hi :) , could you do a video on the uk skincare brand Simple, I would love to know what you like and don't.\n\nLike this if you want this video and so she can see. \n\nLove your videos Tati, you're the best at reviewing 💜✨
I'm probably wrong but watching this video it looks like you're having a bad day and can't wait to be done with filming 😔 I so hope I'm wrong. Lots of ❤❤
Meh, wouldn't buy anything associated with that miserable mare (VB not Tati!!) and don't get me started on the, frankly, obscene pricing 😡😡
Hi Tati,  Can you please do a Hot or Not for Lashed cosmetics and Flirt cosmetics???
Thanks Tati. I like you more when you are like this, honest but not over dramatic.
Does that bronzer only come in 1 shade..... lol
Hi Tati, PLEASE could you do a Hot Or Not video about inglot products🙏🏻 I've just started to use some of the pigment shadows and OMG! I now you would love them (especial the purples!!🤣) \n,!!!PLEASE EVERYBODY LIKE THIS, FOR TATI TO MAYBE READ!!!!
What is that other compact in the picture of this video with the 6 shadows that look like foiled shadows???
I always enjoy how you edit these hot or not videos. It's pretty damn near perfect. ✨ \n\nI really like the colours they chose for everything. Even the blue in that duo. 😜 I have a feeling this collection's highlight is going to give me another oh my goood whyyyy moment. 😅 The one they came out with last year was sooo beautiful. But I can't justify spending that much money on makeup. I'm happy for all the people that can afford it!
Love the eye look
No way in hell would I buy those eyeshadows. That's over priced and a rip off
Loving the eye look tati!!
I love your makeup look. Tutorial please ??????? 😊
My lil Posh went to heaven last week ... guess who I named her after LOL ... I love VB too ... but Tati you look SO beautiful in this vid OMG!
Just watching this to calm me down while sitting in the hospital 💕
For once, I'm glad a high end line completely forgot about deep skin tones. I can save money. 😊
If people wouldn't pay these ridiculous prices, they wouldn't charge them. If every single 1 of them just sat on the shelf, and people weren't dumb enough to pay this, they would be forced to drop the prices to a realistic price. I guess some people just have more money than they know what to do with.
Your not paying for the make up your paying for the name only.
Can you please do a video for the Chanel Soleil tan cream bronzer please? I've heard bad things and good things about it and thinking of buying, also I love your videos so much. 💕
tati can you plsss try storybook cosmetics?
Nice collection
Omg that eye look has me shook 😍
That liner game 😍👏👌
75 goes TO Vicky!
Beautiful eye look
That eyeshadow quad is actually $75. I bought it realized it wasn't worth it and sent it back. Your eye makeup today is stunning!!!
Ordered a few of these products the other day and only just watched your review... So relieved I made the right choices! Thank you for such an in-depth video. Can't wait to try these beautiful pieces x
Thanks for the review! May I ask how does the bronzer compare to Charlotte Tilbury's bronzer in the Filmstar Bronze and Glow?
Hi Tati, thanks for the review, helped me a lot! Could you please also test and review the new Dior liquid metall shadows? Thanks!
Not going to pay $95 for spice girl eye shadow, sorry , not sorry.  Thx for honest review.
What is Estee Lauded thinking?! Its just stupid to put that price tag on duo eyeshadows that aren't even beautiful colors to make great looks!!!!!
Hi Tati! Just wanted to thank you for your videos! I have learnt so much and even apply my everyday tinted moisturiser with a brush now. You are really fun to watch and I live vicariously through your expensive makeup vids. Keep on being amazing!
Yeah nook Estee Lauder yah tried it with some of those price tags..i don't like posh spice that much to spend all that bc her name attached..
Are the compacts refillable?
I would love to have this collection, to bad I am poor.  Tati, your makeup looks amazing!
Hi Tati, the bronzer you used is it in the shade Saffron Sun or Java Sun? Looks great! thanks
The eye foil looked goopy and gross
Which bronzer did you use? There are two colors and the one you're wearing is super pretty! Which one is it??
you look super snatched in this video Tati, and your eye makeup is everythinggggg
The prices are ridiculous! & The shades are not favorited by most makeup lovers. Great packaging, but geez Louise. Talk about dollar signs.
Does she not have a foundation in her collection???
$40 for one foiled shadow. Lemme go buy a 12-15 shade NICE palette from Sephora for that price. Smh 🙄 \n\nTati you know I love you, and I like watching you review higher end brands but DAMN these prices are just killing me lol
I spare no expense when it comes to makeup and skincare. The most I've ever spent on eye shadow was the Natasha Denona palettes and her single shadow is less expensive than the Victoria Beckham. The packaging is lovely but overall not worth it. If I have to spend more at Estee Lauder than I do at Chanel or Tom Ford, something is wrong. The bright blue shades mixed with nuetrals seem to be the thing this fall. Chanel has a beautiful palette for fall. It has antique gold, navy, bright aqua blue and a matte taupe.
The black liner in the lower waterline is SLAYING MY SOUL OMG
The eyeshadow duo is pricey for sure. Your make up is gorgeous. I wouldn't pay that price as I have a heck of a time with my hooded eyes
That earring!  Very beautiful!  What is the brand?
Can you make your own makeup line already?!? Please please please??? 😭😍 I love you!!!! 💕
Although I like other youtubers, when it comes to recommendations, you Tati are the one I turn to. I love your honesty and the fact that you don't let brands buy a positive review. I hope you never loose this trait and keep doin you girl
Im more interested in knowing where you got that beautiful ring on your right hand!!!??? PLEASE
Please do a tutorial on this eye look rn please!!! Soooooo gorgeous!! 😍
60.00 for two eyeshadows that look like mini versions of a full size...pass🤚🏽 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
Not worth the price
Tati I love you makeup, please make a tutorial out of it
Wow, love your tan. These colours go well with it.
Ok tati, stop drooling over Victoria Beckham!!!. As far as that 40$+ eye foil, I have discovered one here in The Netherlands that costs about 6$ that is exactly if not better as beautiful as VB's one, and it comes in a gold and rose gold, silver, and see through black like the universe with stars, so thanks but no thanks***I'll stick to my HEMA ones...xo
Your eye make-up is phenomenal today! I haven't watched the whole video, so i don't know if there is a tutorial. If there's not, please do one. Gorgeous!
I saw the video of Victoria B doing a smokey eye on the Estee Lauder channel and figured the smudgy matte eyeliner is like using an eyeshadow to smudge your lower lashline and I had a similar magnetic brow powder applicator which worked just as fine. :)
I can afford all the line but i still would purchase wisely to a single item i would really love. I think its over priced for what it is. BTW i admire Victoria  Beckham. This was an accurate over view!
I do you film so far away? I just can't see anything :)) if you don't do a close up on the make up this is just a conversation.
I love you tati! Youre the best makeup artist/youtuber
Do a review for fenty beauty !!
I *need* a dupe for that burgundy quad. Tell me it exists...
No No No...that's waaay to expensive!
My mum and I went out and bought the eye foil this morning after seeing your look. It's so much cheaper in the UK because it's not imported, which is why it's so expensive for you!
Can you try and re-create Victoria's London eye??
i can't stop looking at tati's nails omg
I gotta be honest Victoria Beckham isn't Tom Ford the prices for these are ridiculous love her but no.
My guess is the extra cost is for paying Victoria Beckham for her name. It's a pass for me. Loved seeing the collection though!
This eye makeup is stunning! 😍
Well technically with Too Faced you don't take the brand out of the equation. NO HATE. Just curious why you won't review their products if brand and collaborations aren't a factor to you?
You look sooooo beautiful!!! Loving the hair
Can you do a tutorial on that eye look. It makes your eyes look beautiful !!
If you have to kiss someones ass and lie to your following because you want to met a celebrity, they're not worth meeting anyway. Love you babe
Would've preferred a video for 'Like a star' but okay lets go
So what happened to one night?
One of lil boats better songs in my opinion
Garbage. Lyrics by a 5 year old
Why does it seem like he sold out and changed his rap style from before he blew up, don't get me wrong I don't blame him and it's a good song.
An African in his natural habitat.
Idk, I think this song could've been better.
Why do they have to show women with almost nothing on\nCan't they have something decent for a change
This goes!!!!! On me
I'm curious what his voice is like without auto-tunes in full effect.
This song is like some drake shit tf
The fuck where stef fob at? Not s vocal in the tune fam

Visca Barça 🔴🔵⚽ paulinho tapando bocas
柴崎岳！！！
Shibasaki is the best
El gol de Debía Suárez lo mete Asensio y ya están pidiendo el balón de oro para él jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja
Paulinho>>> Casemiro
Paulinho played 32 mins to score a goal... not bad...
¿Por qué da la impresión de que los goles del Barcelona se han celebrado lo mismo que el del Getafe?
Me encantan los resúmenes cada vez de mayor calidad y sonido un 10 laligayoutube buen canal
Wonderful match!!\nThank you!!
Gaku cambiándose el nombre a Goku ssj. Golazo

Obrigado paulinho...
Sufrelo MADRIDISTA concha tu madre
Thank you Paulinho 🔵🔴
Bisca el Barcelona grande pauliñho
Paulinho 💪🏼
Gol Getafe 0:20\nPrimer gol Barca 0:46\nSegundo gol Barca 1:16
Poco se habla de lo que ha robado el Barça, en la primera jugada del vídeo es mano de Gerard Piqué, por lo que sería penalti y su segunda amarilla (el árbitro no pita nada). En el primer gol del Barça viene precedido de una falta a Atunes (no pita nada y es gol).\nEn el segundo gol del Barcelona, Paulinho le da un codazo a Djené (no pita nada y es gol).\nVeo que el Barça no se cansa de robar, la Liga no toma medidas, aún así, ellos siguen llorando.\n#ForzaGeta

YOUR BACKGROUND IS EVERYTHING!!😩🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
You look beautiful as always 😍
I love how you always try something new Sammi, you always give me some inspiration and not to stick to my comfort zone! Also, your hair looks incred! I absoluuuuutely love it! xxx
Can you tell me where you got your mirror from? I love the way you styled your office! Thank you :)
The black denim skirt looked gorgeous on you!!
Sam I love your style!🙌🏼
Sammy,  if you're not sure about the Addidas joggers then check out these trousers from Pull & Bear. It's got Addidas kinda vibe, but really smart and casual at the same time. It's only £19.99, I have been wearing it legit every day since I got them. Loved it so much that I bought it in diff colors. Here's the link https://www.pullandbear.com/gb/woman/clothing/trousers/tailored-jogging-trousers-with-side-stripe-c29021p500356645.html#800
I'd say return the adidas trousers xxx
Autumn/ Winter trends video......YES!  I would keep the Adidas pants! They look awesome!
absolutely keep the addidas pants that outfir you showed was a ten!
Love to new filming space 😍
I really want that dungaree dress but I can't find it :(
I would love to see a autumn/winter how to video! you're so inspiring and I feel like I can relate with your style!
your style keeps getting better and better!! Loved the skirt dungarees!
Love these new pieces! Can't wait to see a 'how to wear' video :) \nYour videos always brighten my day - do keep them up! x
I desperately need the A/W trends video, haha ♥
Also agree with people complaining about the wrinkled shirt...yikes....
Keep the Adidas ones and return the & Other Stories pair. I really wish you would've shown the chain on your bag. Maybe include that in another video or an Instagram post if possible. Always love your styling videos.
I agree on Realisation Par.  That site is like crack in dress form.
keep the adidas pants! and YES to an autumn trend video! also- love when you show us your shopping process- what you pick up, try on, say no to, etc!
please do a autumn/winter how to wear vid, it would be so helpful!!!
I like the add addidas ones so much on you! I think take the other ones back! X
your style is absolutely stunning. You're totally top three of my favourite bloggers when It comes to style. I love you so much
Love your style sam !! \nMay I ask where the white chunky heels are from please ?!
Canne believe this shite trends  nowadays when back in the day a dog humping a fat burd was the video to be seen......how the bar has fallen
Some of my favorite videos from you Sammy ❤️
Lol why was this recommended?
You say 'Adidas' so differently lol. Here in Canada, we say A-Dee-Das
I cannot wait for your winter vlogs in London. Specially Christmas /festive season! Yass
Anyone know where she got her leggings?
I probably wouldn't keep the adidas trousers since you already got the other ones!!
What size did you get the adidas joggers in? I'm usually the same as you but everyones saying they come up small ahhh
I adore hearing you talk about clothing, it's so soothing in a way
Keep the Adidas! You have a great taste when it comes to fashion /styling <3 Kisses from Greece!
Love your Videos and also your Vlogs!!! ❤️❤️❤️ and Yes yes yes autumn/winter trends how to style \nGreetings from Germany 🙂
I've been looking for nice vinyl pants like yours but I couldn't finde any I liked... could you tell me you you got yours from?\n\nBtw love the contrast and the adidas look ;)
Why does Youtube promote your channel so heavily?
Keep Adidas pants! They both are cute💅🏾
Autumn/winter fashion is definitely my favorite too! The colors and layers loooove it so much :) Loove your fashion sense I always get a lot of inspiration from it xx
i've not seen dungarees lately at all
Can you do a haul of clothes cheaper but still a good style like yours like classy vintage?
Omg keep the adidas bottoms!! That outfit is 💣 xxx
keep the adidas! suits you way better!
also, this is one of my fav hauls you've done! and i've been watching since the  very beginning :)
where are your black leggins from :O they look awesome on you!
Thanks for the video Sam. I liked everything you picked. The only piece that I thought was a bit iffy. It's the red polka dot dress. I would be very incomplete wearing it with that very high wrap in front looks like you could have a wardrobe malfunction at any second. I would even be uncomfortable if I saw someone else wearing it bc you just know her pants will get flashed. I especially loved the jumpsuit and the stripped trousers. 🙂
Sometimes in your hauls you pull a clothing piece out and I'm thinking, idk about that item. But then you show a snippet of the item styled and I'm like, ok, yeah that looks awesome. And it always looks so good on you. You are really good at styling. And you make me want to buy pieces I would never buy. Haha. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is, I really love your styling videos and your hauls so keep 'em comin'.
That red polka dot dress is stunning😍😍😍😍
Love you gorgeous girl! ❤️ Your sense of style is spot on!
I can't even tell you how much I love you with curly hair!!!!! It looks so great on you, and that Realization Par dupe is so spot on 👀
YAAS, do that trends-video please!😍 can you do more lookbooks as well? I miss them🙂
I love the black denim skirt. Looks SUPERB on you. I also LOVE the blouse you are wearing. It's crazy to me how much H&M have stepped up their game as of late. Just a year ago there was NOTHING I wanted to buy from them. 
I really like the Adidas bottoms over the AOS stories ones, however you'll prob get more wear out of those ones as the joggers look beat with heels.. & who wears heels that often (not this mama anyway lol)
I love how you make trends completely 'yours'. Everything looks completely different on you, in the best way possible. I love and admire that! :)xX
I love your fashion videos so much aand how u always share your honest thoughts on pieces. Please make more autumn/winter videos. I moved from Greece to Sweden and i'm really not used to dressing for this weather, so some advice on how not to look like a potato bag would be much appreciated! Looking great as always Sammi xX
keep the adidas! It looks great on you
Where is ur black leather jacket from which u tried on with those adidas track pants?!? I luv it soo much!! I luv ur style ur stunning:) xxxx
love the red polka dot but its a bit short
This is my favourite Sammi! :D I know it sounds weird AF but I mean in clothing... I feel like a/w season always boosts your confidence in clothing and I ADORE IT. Keep all the pieces, they look fab on you. xo
I always get a WOW moment when I see you with large earrings haha just because I'm not used to it. So gorgeous
okay here's what I think: keep the Adidas trousers. I'd even suggest returning the AOS trousers but I feel like you like them too much to do that hhaha. Adidas is good quality, it's the original brand so it always looks good, it's stylish (but be careful with the adidas/heels trend! better wear them with the classic black high heels!) and you can wear them at the gym as well if need be!!! other than that, the polkadot jumpsuit is gorgeous on you!! xx
Sam I'm more of a midi skirts and dresses kinda wearer, if that's a word 😂 and I'm wondering you could do a video of how to style skirts and dresses. I know it's not a common thing, especially living in LA, but it's very hard to find a flattering way to style them. Please consider 😁
Hi Sam <3 i totally imagine you wearing that red boohoo dress with some tights and some thigh highs just in case it got colder.
I love your style! Now I want to go shopping :)
Kinda random but I love your arm chair in your try on shots. WHere is it from????
Yes please give us autumn 🍂 winter ❄️ trends.
the adidas pants looked amazing on you! Kinda liked them more than the other! :)
Always giving out the best haul ever
Literally liked this video 5 seconds in because I know your vids are always fabuloussssss! LOOL xxx
I love it when you have curly hair! I also love it when you have curly hair with some curly bangs! so pretty <3
Why don't you keep the adidas pants to wear casually like when youre going to run errands or walking your dog or something...i always thought those adidas pants were for days when you want to be casual but cool.
I'm not one for trends but I love athleisure. I've been obsessed with an entire Nike, Adidas, etc. outfit with trainers. I feel stylish but super comfy at the same time.
definitely keep adidas trackies sam! so versatile - good for lounging round house, w heels as you've styled and w trainers and crop top on a night out! SUCH a staple. sport luxe is here to stay xxxx
Yaaasss! Sammi! Amazing looks! You're the queen of fall winter fashion.
That red dress tho. And the styling was unexpected and amazing!
First pair of pants 😍😍😍 and you should keep the adidas pants and the denim skirt, both fit you very well.
Your style is incredible ♡
sees a haul, sets credit card next to computer haha
loved the video Sam :) Do you happen to know what kind of plant is on your desk? I love it so much!
adidas pants is a keeper
Sammi, for me You are IT GIRL
You're soooo beautiful ❤
Those &otherstories contrast pants are gorgeous!
Keep the Adidas trousers!!!!!!
KEEP!!!
yeees, the trends video would be awesome! ;)
Great picks!
Too cute.
Keep the Adidas
keep the Adidas bottom.
Keep the adidas!!!!! They look gorgeous:)))
KEEP THOSE ADIDAS PANTS!! 😍😍
FILM TUBE 💋💋💋
definitely want the trend Vedio!!
Keep the Adidas so cute.
Deffo keep the joggers! X
i loove the adidas pants
sammi loves polka dots since forever. so classic
How much does this bitch pay YouTube to be featured every week when she barely scrapes 80k views and only has like 300 comments?
I LOOOOVE AND LIIIIVE FOR YOUR STYLE, DAMN!! Like every outfit I want and get inspiration from, always on point <3
Taika Octavius Kwan is a dope ass name. Congrats guys 👏🏾🎉🎉
Geo looks so pretty even right after giving birth
I've been working so much that I missed it😔😔😔 congratulations mama and papa bear❤️❤️❤️👶🏽
What Bart's mom was telling baby Taika was sooo beautiful! The cutest granny 💕
David took so many pics
Man you can see down Tiffany's  shirt Geo.. as she swaddled baby boy
Dang it Tiff! Your reaction made me wanna cry😭😍
You know what this means now...David can make fun of Geo again😂😂😂😂 Anyways CONGRATS ON TAIKA!!!!!!!💓💓💓💓💓💓💓can't wait to see him grow up😭😭😭😭💕
Taika has so much hair I was bald headed when I was born
Congrats, guys. Glad to be able to welcome Taika into the world.
Taika is not Hawaiian...there is no T in the Hawaiian alphabet. Ikaika in Hawaiian means strength.
Boy gonna grow up speaking three languages!!
he used to look like Barts dad but i think hes looking more like momma Geo.
Seems like his poop doesn't smell like Bart's fart.
AWWWW HE SO CUTE!!! Omg I'm so late
Tiffs Spanish is beautiful. I felt comforted. And Barts mom help progress society
Wow my baby sister Jaidyne Marie was litterally born 5 days after Takia Kwan was!
omg so cute love you bart and geo you guys are going to be great parents!!!!!!!!!
Stop putting the phone near Taika. His DNA structure is being influenced by the electromagnetic radiation
Barts mom is so energetic love it!
So cute!!! Congratulations!!! Such a cute little baby. :)
should let baby kwan wear the baby bear blanket that tiff got u guys! :)
omg Bart is so cute good boi good boi the whole time and at the end filming geo eat like I'm so happy for you 😂😂😍 so cute

now joe needs to have a baby so taika and joes baby can become best friends haha.
I've waited so long for this
congratulations on the birth of baby TAIKA. Mexasian baby will be somebody when he grows up.
He will be speaking 3 languages in no time. My sis-in-law's sister is Dutch/Indonesian, her man is Venezuelan and they often speak English to each other because that's easier. The kids speak Dutch, Spanish and English and the youngest is 3. They pick that shit up in no time.
Tiffany is such a beautiful being.<3
David says the most hilarious but random stuff, Fool look like he smoking a blunt 😂
I want a man that will look me the way Geo looks at sushi 😍 😍
Taika in lithuanian is peace
omg I hope the best for the kid and congrats. I'm so happy for you guys !!!!!!!!!!

How old is Bart and Geo?
Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉 He's so beautiful
Congrats guys you will make great parents :)
You know the baby is going to speak three languages when his family talked to him i three languages in one day
Omg Taika has so much hair! I was born completely bald. I look like a bald old man-baby in my pics. XD
Who the heck hated this? Bring their heads to me!
I'm crying!!!!! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS
I can't wait for David to have a kid because his reaction to seeing Taika is amazing. I can only imagine how he'd react to his own baby.
Seeing Geo eat sushi makes me so happy
David's face made me she off laughter when he came on to camera with such a huge grin congrats on the new edition
from meet my boyfriend/girlfriend video to the wedding video and now this. wow. god bless you two..three
I learned this in child pscychology, the more love they get, the bigger brain they develop. True.  At this time of his development, he cannot get enough love. I  am  sure that won't be a problem. also,  play classical music, it also is good for his cognitive development.  It is beautiful to see all the love in that room. Bart and Geo are good parents. Congrats.
Im so proud of you guys....😌 May his first words be PineApple Pen🍍🖊 .................... YALL KNOOOOOOOOOW that'd be the cutest thing ever 😂

Congratulations, Bart and Geo! You both did amazing. Great job, y'all.

Taika is going to be trilingual just you waitm
Congratulations, Geo & Bart!! He can totally be trilingual. Look up Maddox’s world- he’s Spanish, Chinese & white and can speak all 3 fluently b/c of his abuleas as well as being in an elementary school which had Chinese & Spanish in Seattle. Besos todos!!
WHEN BART STARTED TO RUB HIS FOREHEAD WHEN HE WAS CRYING AND HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THATS SO CUTE
Congrats you guys!! :)\nMay you all be very healthy and happy!\n\nP.S I'm still counting down the weeks until I get my portion of sushi... it will be soon enough and I'm sure it's well worth the wait.\nGeo you are a superstar! <3

Seeing everyone hold the baby I can definitely see joe as a dad
I didn’t watch you guys for 9 months and this is what happens while I’m gone?

iPhone 8\niPhone X\niPhone XI\niPhone 1100\niPhone 2x-5=21\niPhone sqrt(12.25*16)\niPhone X + 1/2(iPhone X)\niPhone $16k price tag\niPhone 7th prime number\niPhone product of the numbers we skipped\niPhone Footlong\niPhone whoops we made it too big it's just an iPad now
How do you bring up search on iPhone X? That's how I open apps at present
The iPhone X has a face recognition so these girls aren't gunna be able to unlock their phone's when they take their makeup off.😇🙊
had my mouth open the whole time!  phone 4 1000 bux nooooooooooo waaaaaaaaaayyy!!!!
how many times did the commentor say great and gorgeous? obviously paid by apple to promote this crap!
i don't care if it expensive, ill get it. The only thing that bad about this is, samsung, LG, pixel etc phone companies took risks to experiment with features and designs. Apple get to enjoy the results
No,Thanks.I'm sticking with my Iphone 7+
Think of all the cavemen who will still use their thumbs to unlock their phones. I can think of no better way to spend £1000.
LOL now if you crack that screen.... You done for
im in isis and we came out with this 3 years ago... you're late af honey
Iphone 11 will need your DNA to unlock.. then they will have completed their mission to acquire all users finger prints, mug shots and DNA. Well done you all just sold your souls to apple. Edit ( and to whomever they choose to sell that info to.)
It's funcionality matches its design. Horrible
Oh so it's a slab of metal with a built in Snapchat?
It looks almost like a galaxy s8
Kinda looks like a copy of Samsung Galaxy s8 they need to stop with the iPhones
Since Samsung switched to the design of the s8 , asus decided to steal samsungs old design. Go check it out the zenfone is an exact replica of the s7
Hey everybody it's the iPhone Verge lol.
I rather have a home screen... ;-;
where is the idab
theres actually nothing new to the iphone x.. it has no home button and uses the swipe gesture was on the blackberry 10 series as far back as 2011. the face id was on the sony andriod phones also 2011
So what happens when I am Asian?
Definitely getting the 8 plus. The X just seems like too much compromise for very little return.
The phone is harder to control than keeping  my math grades up...
So if it's dark I can't unlock my phone?
IPhone No digital Buttons Built Into Lower Screen Like Android. iphone X Screw Older People.  My parents have always gone with Apple but I can assure you they will never buy IPhone X because it's so obviously targeted at Millennials and not 50+ year old. Just why,  Apple,  WHY?
More like the iPhone 8+ Will wait 3 more generations and stick to my 5 works just fine.
Isn't apple known for their home button? Good thing I got my iPhone 7. That's just crazy.
Bruh what if u wore makeup then took ur makeup off and tried it and it don't work 😂
You know your second when you have to go to your competition to stay relevant.
Super glarey
10 dollars 990 to go
https://youtu.be/axYKPbr9_MA
All nonsense.
Best Samsung note 7 upgrade
Its actually ugly.
What about the iPhome 9?
I'm not paying 1000$ for camera upgrade and charger upgrade!!\n\n\nIf there's anybody looking for property in Costa Rica go to.\nCosta Rica Taylor Made Real estate on Facebook.
I prefer the Note 8 It's much sexy , powerful and cheaper
The charging port is still in the iPhone X
Who thinks it's useless?
Honestly im happily contented with my Iphone 5s ...it still works freaking well.. I thank so much steve jobs for this phone... I think THIS IS THE BEST PHONE THAT APPLE HAS MADE...\n\nI wish steve jobs is still alive and will wreck the face of the dumb creator of Iphone X..\n\nSTEVE JOBS IS A LEGEND
So.. I can call people with it, right?
Does the face ID work underwater? Just wonderin lol
Why do we even need credit cards anymore, we can just use our face
Eh I'm just gonna keep my iPhone 7\n\nEdit: RIP Home button
But I like the home button. Either way, it's basically the same phone with a few minor and, relatively unimportant, changes. I don't see why people would really care about it.
Oh i still love my Lumia! Its still looks better!
Who else is watching this full screen on the samsung galaxy s8
Oh sick, they re-released the iPhone 4s for $999
What if we, keep one eye closed?
not trolling by any way, but doesn't' the samsung 7 edge have face eye recognition, close enough right?
Tell me this doesn't look like an android
Samsung, time to step up your game. I'm sorry but this is cool.
We all joked about this. We all said lol I bet on the iPhone 8 they're gonna remove the home button.\n\n\n\n\n*_WE WEREN'T SERIOUS APPLE_*
Costs $999, NOT INCLUDING A FAST CHARGER, got to get those separately for $75
I rather have I phone 6
I'd prefer a phone with a home button.
I will call it iPhone X instead of 10 like people who say gif as either gif or jif and niche as either nitch or neesh. X sounds cooler than 10.\n\nXpensive\nXclusive \nXtraordinary\nXcited\nXcellent\nX-Men\nXcuse, me? $1000!?\nX marks your g-spot ;)\nXpialidocious!\n\nHigh demand, limited quantities. Buy it for $1000, sell it for $2000 ASAP. Do the math, kids. Duh!\n\nCost about $412 to manufacture. It's the special 10th anniversary iPhone. Has A11 Bionic chip that outperforms every mobile SoC out there and a MacBook Pro at double the price. And still expensive? Okay. \n\n$🖕, 000, haters.
what if the owner is sleeping and i just put their phone in front of their face and lift up their eyelids considering they are in deep sleep
Face id defeats the purpose of just simply unlocking your phone you still have to swipe up to unlock your phone smh.  has been getting dumb and dumber.
iPhone X vs iPhone 8/8 Plus - Which Should You Buy?
It is not starting at 1000$. It starting at 999$.
I don't know know, I rather keep my Gemini Ulefone. Lmao.
Could you hold a picture of your friend to their x and unlock it
It doesn't matter what apple does with the iPhones there are always suckers who think the iPhones are the most beautiful looking phone even when they sometimes HONESTLY aren't. Apple can do no wrong in those eyes.
Wow samsung is gooood
Guys,do you now where i can sell my kidneygreat phone. btw,Guys do you know where i can sell my kidney?!L.O.L
1000$ i can buy a pc with that and do way more
Where is I phone 9? Love Microsoft much?
After my death who would unlock my phone?
Girls don't buy the I phone X. Because when you take off your makeup you can't unlock the phone. It won't recognize it's actually you 😂😂🔫
Ok great but still no headphone jack so f*** off.
So if you get jumped and mess up your face, you can't call the cops.
they stole the swipe up thing from blackberry lol
Joke of the daySituation - In a room light goes off...people open their mobile torch by their normal handsets...Guy with an iPhone X - Please someone show light on my face so that I can unlock my phone
it's ugly. Too glossy and they really did a mess with home button. not worth even 600 bucks
How to open siri
Iphone 10? What happend to 9?
Most ugly
Whos read X with 'eks' not 'ten'? 😂😜
1:12

It looks like cheap HTC phone.
Wait does it allow passcode?

how about twin ?
What about siri
back side is soooooooo ungly
https://youtu.be/gGRULiZFk6I\n\n\nfull iphone x review
Watching this on iPhone 29
This is a hard choice I currently have iPhone 7+ I'm thinking it will feel weird in the hand seems small.
What was wrong with having a home button? Now what if you're playing a game and you swipe and accidentally close out of it?
Awesome Price DEAL on the IPhone X!\nNow with 4K recoding, you may better get the 256GB model for $1149 + $79 for the 87W Fast Wired Charger (so you can benefits from fast charging) + $25 for the Lighting to USB-C cable +$199 Applecare for iphoneX for around $1,492 plus taxes, that's a great deal!
Does the Face camera read your face 2d or 3d? what if you just hold a pic of the owners face in front of there phone?
Nah, I'm good with my Android. I just need it for music, calling, and texting
I want the home button back....
Looks like any high end Chinese phone.  Lol the Verge idiots are corporate apple shills
Everyone here saying stuff about FaceID not working.. the problem I think is maybe it works TOO well. Like what if you just want to show your friend something, forgot its on the lock screen, and your friends face locks you out of your phone. or what if you want to see your lock screen notifications but you can't because it always unlocks...

The Weeknd -Curve ft. Gucci Mane
konena
First of. Im going to be that asshole. But being close or near to that laval as in the video. They should be burning and sweating
Yo i dont have a lighter to spark my joint\nHomie: its cool the floors mad of lava
Lava floor vid in 2017 kinda late to the party RJ.
It is all because of cracks
And thats why you have carpets.
5:15 to 6:10 thank me later
Back when this channel was still freddiew...
Next time on The: floor is lava two roommates Climb an attic\n\n\n\n\n Oh wait...
looking at the window I Thought My Dather Is Here Already And Get me somthing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy no one get me?
That guy at the end looked like this extremely funny yet racist kid on my school bus
4:16 that face though XD also how is he floating?
the brett part was too funny
That part was funny when he fell
What if the floor is water
Looks like a copy from smosh
Omg man this is so cool i love it
Ahhh a deleted scene from volcano :). Seriously though guys awesome video you got a new subscriber 
I subscribed because of this video
3:17 to 3:22 well he tried
This was trippy. lol i like to have friends like these.
Stick a pillow to your feet!
Bro I thought that was real lava you guys all did good
When the lava is hot enough to fry a smore but not hot enough to burn you yet melt human skin.
I love this if there is a movie that can create floor is lava
The ending was hilarious 😂
When you take the floor is lava too serious...
Next try the The Air is Lava challenge.
This trend ended since when
This is why I never let people in my imagination
Wpuldnt the house be on fire???? ...
Im watching this at exactly 2:19 AM :00 \nSomehow creepy
the Top Is Lava Much Bettter 😬😂
It seems that everyone was scared in the world except for moms who do laundry, they seem to be not effected
Lots of problems with this, but still pretty well done.
This is what youtube is made for
I almost cried until the ending
Weirdly accurate physics having a body float on lava, unlike how movies always get it wrong and have people sink below it. Lava, being basically molten rocks, is going to be denser than people.
Was waiting for another good video. Was wirth it though and through
4:12 he's feet move

Let's hope they gave Mina, Sana & Momo more lines than usual (otherwise J-line fans will riot lol). TWICE wa sugoi desu!
0:15 Who love her?😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Should've took the stairs
it should be titled Lyft, because this reminds me of that, driving for that
This happens to me all the time.
I'm high af and I swear this song amplified it by like 10 times
Americans, lift is also an elevator
The beginning of this sounds like Pavement.
Damm I try to listen with 1.25*/1.5* speed it wasn't bad tho.
i love this video and song so much
for some reason i imagine this as an animation.
I once banged a chick in a elevator.. dman that was good
I miss this Radiohead, with guitars and less electronic, i mean, it's great all their music, i just miss this...
This sounds like old Radiohead T_T
PLEASE, COME TO BRAZIL, WE LOVE YOU.
man, I love you Radiohead. you're the best walk by myself.
What I would give to be in an elevator with Thom Yorke…
So is this a song about being stuck in a elevator???
why do i feel that i lived all my life in just 4 minutes and 7 seconds?
Thanks god for giving us Radiohead
this brings me back :')
Hearing these old fan favourites with new life put into them is great and nostalgic, but it kinda makes me sad too because I haven't yet been able to see radiohead live and it seems like they are wrapping things up. I really hope this isn't true. I need to see my all time favourite band before it's too late.
I changed my way of life and cancelled the credit card. Fuck, I need to purchase the boxed edition of OKNOTOK. Help please.
That's a big fucking elevator
To me, this song is related to letting bad things go and finally being free from your sadness and pain. Realizing you can do better and finally opening yourself to the things yet to come. Radiohead songs always touch me.
1:41 those bald heads are brighter than my future.................I see eggs tho?
i love radiohead but there last 2 albums have not connected with me.sorry to say.king of limbs had one good song.morning mr magpie and a moon shaped pool had ful stop.a part from them two tracks i wasn't into these albums at all.i have to be honest.I've loved all there other albums but i think my favourite is in rainbows.but only just as all the albums apart from there last 2  have been master peaces..just my 2 pennys worth on radiohead.
This reminds me of the elevator at school only it's smaller.
660  people who have shit taste
Ahhhh...yes.... bliss. We love RADIOHEAD. Thank you boys.
strangely i like being sad .Radiohead does something to me.
Imagine being so creatively fertile that you could leave this off of OK Computer. This song is immense.
the track written in 1999 ))):  https://soundcloud.com/auxsoundsystem/the-lift
Feel like I am back to early 2000's/ late 1990's again
Why is he always there? Where has he to go? \nWhy all those businessmen are bald?\nWhy doesn't he hold the door for the old man?\nWhy do I love Radiohead so much?
The radio still on my head
2 sad this already sounds like winter, I want more summeeeer
So this is what Thoros of Myr is doing nowadays...
Radiohead supports the illegal occupation of Israel.
This makes me want to cry. Something powerful in the voice tpwards the middle of the song. It's beautiful.
Private fears in public places
India's first bullet train just watch it \nhttps://youtu.be/x1VrXStIzvA

What did they really mean by this?
I think Thom Yorke is pissed at being old.
I think the video so funny . 😄😂😂 . I like it 😄😄❤❤
Oh my, this is so good!!
We mirror the people we don't know.

I love it old school Radiohead sound
i got so happy when i saw this in my recommended. i'm so happy thom and the band are still going at it. my mum saw you when you were just an opening band and now you're everything i love.
Thom as a Beer belly underneath that rain coat haha.
Hi, you're on an elevator going through floors, pretty cool huh?
This is the place\nSit down, you’re safe now\nYou’ve been stuck in a lift\nWe’ve been trying to reach you, Thom\nThis is the place\nIt won’t hurt ever again\n\nThe smell of air conditioning\nThe fish are belly up\nEmpty all your pockets\nBecause it’s time to come home\n\nThis is the place\nRemember me? I’m the face you always see\nYou’ve been stuck in a lift\nIn the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean\n\nThe smell of air conditioning\nThe fish are belly up\nEmpty all your pockets\nBecause it’s time to come home\nThe smell of air conditioning\nThe fish are belly up\nAh, let it go\n\nToday is the first day\nOf the rest of your days\nSo lighten up, squirt
The most beautiful song ever
Genius! ✨🌍✨

Dear BBC could you reveal the air date asap thanks! Can't wait to watch it
benedryl cucumberpatch is BBC's ultimate clickbait.
Yeees Benedict! Whatever he does, its just the best! <3 Cant wait to watch this. Its going to be beautiful and emotional just like his movie Third Star. It made me cry alot.
I'm gonna cry a lot.
Υesss, Benedict!
omg..! after The Current War and then The Child in Time trailer.. i'm ready for this.. can't wait! XD
I see Benedict Cumberbatch. I watch. He's just so irresistible (I'm not gay).
Sees Ben Cumberbatch, yep I'm totally watching this.
Heavy Rain by BBC One
sooooohot...just sayin.
Can time heal?\nNo but Doctor strange can.
He needs to be used for another Sherlock series never mind this
I guess this will have to make up for the Sherlock withdrawals.
The Child In Time airs on Sunday September 24 at 9pm on BBC One.
I love you,benny
Press x to scream KATE!!!!
This looks good
Don't worry this is Sherlock Holmes he will find her this finna be be a breeze.
Jesus 10 years after I had to read this shite in AS English they're making a show of it.  Worst crap I've ever read, and I've read Dan Brown.
Omg iv read the book ik what happens can't wait to watch this 😆😆😆😆
2 Best things in it.\n1) BENEDICT\n2) MUSIC
Oh look... The McCann's need more money... So another kidnap series... Notice the girl's name is KATE
Where can I see it(I haven't got television)?
Is this gonna be a tv series or movie?
Looks so good
Ben and the little girl playing - fills my heart up
I thought this was a Wholock episode because of the title
Christ that looks depressing just what we all need. Why can't they do a drama about losing a fiver, or drinking an unexpectedly cold cup of tea, or perhaps a smoking tiger with anger issues and a love for left socks. Off to GPs for some anti depressants tomorrow, thanks.
I swear they could have just used cctv?
This looks like it's going to be great! Can't wait to see it!
The role looks perfect for Benedit Cumberbatch and I already can't wait for it! Its going to be something without a doubt!
He lost his kid in the supermarket lol what a dumbass
I can`t wait. Ah, my love Benedict!
A couple of days ago a couple of dudes drove up to a High School near Rubery in Birmingham, trying to lure a child around 12 to get in their car because they knew her mom. \nI really wish a channel would commission To Catch A Predictor UK. It'd be so popular, plus it'd strike fear into the nonces, knowing they could be exposed to the nation on TV. Please, please, please, please
Shame he doesn't have the TIME STONE
I Wonder, do you think that Kate is a Time Lady? I'm just curious.
This is going to be available in America right
As soon as I saw cumberbatch, CLICK
Oh mah gah I am HYPED FOR THIS! LOVE YOU BUMBLEBEE CUCUMBERPATCH!
I'M intrigued it sounds so good and i like Benedict's performance
I have been waiting for this since that summer 2017 trailer for BBC Drama. Love it so much.
IM HERE BEFORE THIS GOES VIRAL AND MAY I JUST SAY\n\n\n\nthERe gOEs mY hEArT
Sherlock has a child 😉👍🏻
This is the one case Sherlock can't solve
So ... he's not a time traveling alien?

Book of the week, A bad storm by Theresa Down....................
No Benedict, you are SHERLOCK, you can Find her.
when does it come on ??
Meh, doesn't look as good as The Missing
'The child in time' seems like a good title for a Dr Who episode. The return of the Drs Daughter?
HE WOULD BE SUCH A GOOD DAD IM SO OVERJOYED
Omg yuuuus back at BBC, love a good BBC series especially with benedict
Why not make another season of Sherlock if you had time for this :////
Benefit cucumbrhatch
Anyone with just an ounce of empathy cannot but be gripped by the power of Cumberbatch in this trailer. My heart and stomach are tight from it.
Just use your deduction skills, Sherlock!
Waaalt!
every film : ben running
Benedict? Okay Im watching this
Se Inscreva Se No Meu Canal
#we_need_Sherlock_Holmes

What the fuck
Doctor Strange looks fucked
What will happen to Sherlock? Thats it?
I feel like there is going to be a twist...that she has actually died and they are in denial
Oh my god benedict as a dad
No effects but it looks like it has not done any editing
Shit
Looks crap
Looks stupid
Cher Is QUEEN!! ❤️
Cher kinda thick
LEGENDS
Cher went off!
WTF💀
This is so fucking cringey.
Cher plz record this song!!!!
Who allowed this?
aaaahhhhh too much autotune.....it hurts my ears!!
Zaytoven 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
bad
Awesome
I was here.
This really is cringe worthy. Future sounds extra robotic singing next to Cher 😨 It just does not sound right!!
Yikes. That did not work. Like, at all.
I LOVE THIS...CHER IS SUCH A COOL BEAN...AWESOME💋❤
Hey the King and Queen of Auto-Tune lol....
They look way too good for this Gap commercial. But I love Cher and Future
God please see it I never see but most importantly never to hear that noise ever again. Start to finish all wrong and why you thought you wanna pan in closer to a 70+ is beyond forgivable.
CHER IS SO AMAZING. 71 😍 and 🔥
Sweat shop manufacturing trying to clean up its image with a woman that's got more stitches than a pair of jeans. Oh, this world is so predictable. Sell out celebs
Zaytoven, I see you, bruh!
This is such a weird combination but I absolutely love it. Thank you, Gap!
Cher's face doesn't move from all the plastic surgery. What an ugly freak.
Still looking for talent in this video
love it.
Dunno whats more fake, chers face or futures voice...
Reaction video uploading !
I hate this.
my ears are shitting blood
LMAO WTF IS THIS
Cringe af
ummmm......why does this sound like siri and cortana had a duet
Yes, that is Cher's🍑in the beginning. I loved this. Cher and Future!!🙌👏
I really wish this beat had an instrumental.
Wow!😐 but I ❤ it
A recap for context: I caught this as a Spotify commercial, and it was so disruptive I put on my todo list find the Gap on YouTube to tell them to stop it.\nPlease, never do this again.\nPlease...
Zaytoven
For a little french like me ... very ivonic, supernatural. A : this is america video ^^
Who saw this as an ad but searched for it to cringe again
the hell is this
they would make a fire tune
By the way Paula Deen Baby You have me hooked on Evine my kitchen is all you SWEETIE THANKS FOR THE GREAT Cooking ITEMS. LOVE YOU TOO 😉😘💞 Brian
WHO OK'D THIS?
This was definitely produced by Zaytoven
O my Cher
I love this!
YESSS. BANG BANG!!! LOVE THE DUET.
Iconic or ironic two pop legends
Most random pairing.
WTF
SENSATIONAL
Yasss hubby 😍
Awesome
This really fye af 😍😍😍
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OG auto-tune with new school auto-tune. love it
this is actually a great idea for the gap especially since the gap was always supposed to represent the bridging of two generations. that's why they sell seemingly regular clothing that elders wear but often have a young flare to them
I'm here for this song tho ❤
the 90's called they want their commercial back
Drop the full thing
I love it!!! I give it a 4.8/5\nShould've been @ least 60 seconds
LMAO THIS WAS A AD AND I WAS LIKE WTF THATS CHERS VOICE WITH A RAP BEAT
Can you make this into a full some or have them do a collaboration!! I love this!!
This is f'king stupid
future didnt seem like her had much to do
Wow this was a random collabo lol would be cool to a see a song from the two of them
I used to rock Gap but not no more even tho I still have the jeans
Quavo reminds me of the guy in the group project who doesn't do anything, but gets credit for the final mark lmao
Love the resonance in her voice.
Cher!!!! 💜🇷🇺
Cher meet the future? But she is still looking like in the 90s 😍, Fucking love u Goddess ❤️
The end was fye
That company be putting a GAP in my wallet!
u know future had to get that boi zay on the keys 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What I particularly like is how natural and at ease they seem with each other.
As usual... Cher performs at the highest level. Great beat and wonderful vocals.
They're both much more talented than what is displayed here. Wish they would've put more into the production
Most people complaining are\nWhites because A black guy like future is featured with Cher\n\nHad this been A light Skin white friendly like drake with Cher \nThis video would have no complaints
What did I just watch....?
Come home from school to see this and all I get is a smack from my mother :O
...was he trying to say meet me in the gap at the end of just having a small stroke?
this fuckin sucks
Too much trap and auto-tune. 😒
What the hell is this trash?! I find this to be a very strong disrespect to Sly and the Family Stone, to good music as a whole, and to humanity! Nobody asked for this mess smh.\n\nIf you think you wanna improve on a classic, this is just not the way. \n\n#Trash #Disgusted #Insulted
Too much auto tune
uh... wtf
Horrible! Who is that dumb guy that tried to sing? Lol
Sounds like two fuckin' robots singing over one another. Trash.
Is Cher a man??
I've been reading a lot about how this song is ... insert negative comments about Future, Cher's looks, the use of the song. You get my drift.\n\nI am very much behind the intent of this campaign and I enjoy its imperfections. It's about everyday people. Look beyond the capitalism and think - with all the ugly in the world. It's nice to see old and new come together and just be people.\n\nFor those who would criticize the use of a Sly and the Family Stone song. When are y'all going to understand how public domain is supposed to work? Wow thanks Walt Disney, the world doesn't understand how we as a community, a culture, as people evolve.
Classic meets Current.  And Classic IS current!  Cher forever.  Love Future, too.
YOUNG PEOPLE NEEDS MORE CHER 😇 THANKS GAP
Amazing!!!! She looks amazing and  is a major player in music history. But with this ad, she is ensuring her stamp on pop culture remains in people's radar today and in the future.
I love Cher!
Too much autotune in 30 secs
IVE NEVER WANTED A COLLAB SO MUCH MORE IN MY LIFE XD
Honestly one of the best ads I've seen in a while
Guys please if everyone donates something we can get him off the street. I dont have much myself and know how its like. go to his go fund me\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/helpanthonyoffthestreet
I came here to dislike the video.\nHave a nice day.
You can grab a piece and go The fact that you guys think I wont eat the entire thing in one go is adorable. Misguided, but adorable.
Anyone else catch the: Berry (Barry) Bark and then Barry goes woof?
I'm berry pleased about this recipe.
Berry bark.\nWoof.\n\nI am DEAD, you guys are so awesome.
I am very confused about the schedule of this channel now
Who cares about the food. I'm wondering where Barry's jacket is from
Pineapple, coconut water and a little lime zest! Put in a tropical twist!
Not sure if they have them in Britain, but my favorite ice lolly is the orange creamsicle.
em-BARRY-sing
This looks like a winner!
Yay, I got featured in a video ^_^
Bung some bacon in it.
u could make a nutella frozen bark.. just  blend nutella yogurt and frozen banana with a bit of vanilla...!! perfect for a chocoholic ♥__♥
Great timing - now summer is over! ;)
Would this use with a coconut or soy yoghurt instead? :)
Oo you could do coconut yoghurt, with mango pieces and lime zest 👌🏼
I really wanted to try this recipe but I am allergic to lavender. Is there an alternative
Look awesome guys!!! But I wonder if we can do it with lime and mint? I love the sour taste and if it won't work just add some rum and booomm we just created a freaking mojito ice cream!!! :))
Ok but Barry looks like a Matalan model. I'm not complaining!
Now I know how else I can use my frozen berries I bought sometime back. THANK YOU
Lower in fat; lower in sugar; delicious. You're contradicting yourself when you say that.
Why Greek yogurt? I hate Greek yogurt. It tastes of cream cheese. Would a different yogurt work for this?
given that your carbonara took me 45 minutes to make, this seems right up my alley. :)
Hi I'm a long time lover of your channel and I'm going off to uni on Sunday, it would be kinda cool if you did some budget friendly, student friendly dishes
How long can these last in the freezer? Thanks!
Wow I think I wanna give this a go!
*Does SortedFood consciously have Barry in your berry-related videos?*
so simple, but looks so good!  would goat's milk yogurt work instead of regular (cow)??
literally about to go make this right now
LAVENDER? Who are you and what did you do with Ben's mint?
in love with Barry's hair😍
I don't know if I keep missing the videos or have they stopped announcing what the next week's theme is? I haven't seen the mystery box in a while and you guys haven't been directing us to the website for a sneak peak on next week's theme as far as I know? Are they announcing all of their stuff on other social media now?\nI'm so confused >.<\n\nAlso I know this is an ad and is likely unrelated to what you guys are doing this week.
man this looks sooo good 😭 once i get discharged from the hospital, i am so making this!!
YUM!
Ben can't replace mint with lavender. What has the world come to?
it's so fast it's almost emBERRYssing
Berry's poor heart shattered faster then the bark did as Ben destroyed it😂
So I've made this before and my problem with it is that it's too cold to bite into, but when it is warm enough to bite into it makes a huge mess all over your fingers. Does anyone else have this problem and any solutions?
Can you use any replacements for the lavender?
After seeing the headline, I was sure you were going to finish the video by stuffing frozen yogurt and tree bark down Barry's pants. And I'm kind of disappointed it didn't happen.
Ouch.. I'm wearing headphones so my shoulders jumped when Ben forcefully dropped the slab on the counter lol
How can I get rid of the ice crystals? I had problems finding a large tray so it became a bit thicker than I wanted it to be... Will it have a smoother texture if I make it thinner or is there any trick for it?
Em(berry)sing to call a recipe
looks so good this guys, whats the texture like?
Calm down Ben! Just coz it's easy doesn't mean it's embarrassing as a recipe.  You're embarrassing. As a snob. 😑
My father has been making this homemade ice cream for years and years. It's the easiest thing ever and it's so good, only ever eaten it as soft serve
3:46 *woah*
I'm so jealous of Barry's eyebrows
Forgot to call it an #ad.
Soooo....can I do it with cheese and bacon?
What is a lollie?  I'm from Canada 🇨🇦. \n\nThis looks awesome! Way to go! Also love the humour.
Ben, you are the star of this show...you could have your own channel.
any video that involves berries *has* to have Barry in it. this is a rule
Where can you get a packet of Lavender in herb form?
I have the same blender...can recommend if anyone is intersted.
I am sad cz i can't have these 😯
Here's a recipe that I've always been curious to try but never have cuz I never found a recipe: *Lavender Ice Cream*\nI saw the ice cream in the movie It's Complicated and I've always wondered how you put lavender in ice cream.\nMight I request this recipe from you guys at SORTED Food?
This is a quick to make, quick to eat recipe. You literally have to eat it quick, otherwise you get froyo fingers 😃 I would try it though, if it wasn't 16 degrees outside... 🤒
I knew barry's actual bark was coming but i still laughed really hard
You could add some cocoa and make something like a black forest bark :)
Very up-town.  Can also be done with bananas and chocolate if berries aren't your thing and chocolate is..
nice! will make that
The two best things in life have come together.\n\nI've always love white chocolate bark, and frozen yoghurt. THE DREAMS ARE ALIVE.
Can you just use citrus fruits for this
Can you guys make some salty pastry? Salt and sweet combination. Plssssss:-(
Twister lolly is my fave the strawberry and lemonade ones
i was wondering if you could make this with pumpkin and ginger snaps for a autumn style?
This is doing to be a healthy snack😍
Definitely going to try this one! Not sure about grab and go, maybe grab shove in my face before it melts all over my hand
I have a bunch of kiwis that I want to try this with. Might do kiwi + orange zest
Please do the video with pink chocolate
yessss more of this easy no bake receipes please!
You didn't listen did you. 😂😂😂😂
I will skip lavender.
Please some more healthy frozen foods pls
Ohhhh sassy Ben You didn't listen, did you?
Ok this, but mint choc chip orrrrrrrr, who knows, endless choices.
Nom
Ice lollys is a dumb name for a popsicle.  Lollipop + Icicle is better than Ice + Lollipop.  Wait.  Hmmmmm....
Cherry brandy was my fav
FAB ICE LOLLIES!!!!!!!
Ben marry me 😘
It looks so yummy 😋
Zaps were the best!!
Genius!😍
Berries too tangy? This goes perfectly with frozen ripe bananas.
B4nny would be proud
hi
😍 I wish I weren't on a diet
You guys dont know how much i love yogurt, in fact i have eaten 3 tabs tonight. I love it sooo much!
What about adding some mint to the mix, just to give it that kick? Mint and berries are great together! (Plus, it would make Ben happy😂)
looks shit
I don't like yogurt. Could you do this with ice cream?
That is GORGEOUS!! 😍
I can't even stand the smell of lavander, i will never understand why people eat it !
Mini Milks for the Win!! I loved them as a kid too! The vanilla or chocolate were the best \n\n(That's the milk lolly Ben is talking about at the beginning)
Seems delicious, but with the cold and (kind of) stormy weather I would much rather have something warm or comforting. Any chance you guys will make some autumny recipes?
Looks lovely and will be making it with my grandchildren but does it not melt fast?
Can anyone explain to me what lavender would taste like? Besides lavender of course... Whenever I hear of adding a flavor like rose or lavender I get this vision of eating soap or perfume.
I'd eat the full slab in one go
She's a bloody national treasure....
Judy Dench - not sure if that's her real name or her rap name
Victoria and Abdul looking a bit different.
Hahaha how did this even come about?
What a legend 😍😍😍she's so cute bless her
She's so cool.
Best thing ever
We need more people like her in the world of today.
Ju to the di aka jizzle POW
Brilliant. Put a smile on my dial and a chuckle in my belly! Love Judi. Legend!
Dame Judy is a legend!! Loving that we have 2 Queen Victoria / grime connections this week. First this, then this!! Bus scene is hilarious. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_RMMIdfE4
Can she adopt me
Magnificent Judi.💕 👏 😂👍.Thanks very much for Uploading this.💗

Absolutely love this! 😂😂😂💖
Loving this
Lethal who?
Judi rocking that cap!!
Utterly gorgeous!
She is so cool.
That ending tho 😂
First
Kill me.
Amazing!
Lol.
This is dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hate this kind of music.
Haha. Stupid music, but fair play to her
Cringe
Better than all  these mumble rappers tbh😋
I think baby pentland will be called Lucy Xx Mine is Honey Xx❤️
OMG just thought of a name as I was watching this! How cute is the name Dottie
Appreciate the mention Louise! Don't worry it's not my favourite name either xx
I have a cousin named Nicole that we nickname Coco. Also, predicting that the baby's name will be Lucy 😊
Are you naming your baby Lucy? You mentuoned it alot but not in your too 3. If so, super cute!!! Its number 1 on my list for baby number 2
I'm actually so happy that Louise didn't reveal her child's name, I think it would be really cool if she reveals the name once her baby is born
Loved this! I named my second daughter Aubrey! At that time I had only known of one other baby named Aubrey and it seemed like in the first few years after I had Aubrey, everyone was naming their daughter Aubrey. My Aubrey is now 14.
Name your baby girl Nova! As is Supernova! You mentioned you like space-themed names, so here you go!
Can't wait to meet your little baby peanut!
I completely forgot about Moondreamers! I watched this show all of the time!!! So magical! 💜🌙💫☁️💜
A Idea For A Beautiful Baby Girl Name:\nCarmensita ❤
I feel like the baby's name could be Lucy or Delilah
I love the name Percy. I also love Greek god or just old names like Odysseus and Ptolemy or Raphael or Artemis  . They just sound really cool. My name is cool too it's Veronica.
HOLY SHIT I USED TO LISTEN TO THE MOON DREAMERS ON TAPE ON MY WALKMAN. You literally just transformed a 23 year old, lying in the bath on her phone, into a little girl again!!!  Hahaha wow.
Ngl, I was ber gassed when she said DINA TOKIO omg both of my faves !!!!! love u Louise, also cute baby names!!!!!
This seems like such a fun tag for once! 🙌🏼
She looks like Alfred E Newman
Some one please explain to me why her hair is now pink
What about harmony like if u like
In Poland <ko-ko> is a sound that chicken makes, so if i met a grown up woman who would introduce herself as Mrs.Coco it would take me a lot not to laugh
I think Ava and Sophia are really pretty names
Pay to be on trending
This has given me such a feeling that you're going to call this baby Daisy! 😍

Managed to get my hands on your book last week and i just finished it! 💕
Give the unborn person a gender neutral name like Skyler. Then when the person reaches a mature age they can choose their own gender.
Yeah the moondreamers ❤ i still have a cassette from moondreamers
Hunter is my niece's name. Such a good name.
I love the name Daniel 😍 Can't wait to hear what you're gonna name Baby Pentland!
I love darcy she is a angle

MOON DREAMERS omg!  I had the little toys, one of Celeste among them, but even still I could find no other evidence that this show ever existed... no one else remembers!  Now my soul can rest easy, I'm not insane, thank you Louise!
I know where the actress who plays lavender in Matilda works
Not street like street worker 😂😂 I love your awkwardness Louise! #relatable lol
I think the baby's name is Lucy or something along the lines
Love this video! I'm currently bored in hospital being induced because my soon to arrive son has been playing silly games with me! I'm 37+3 At the moment and we chose his name quite early. A lot of my friends didn't like it, but no one has changed my mind. Can't wait to actually officially announce it now :)
My daughter is named Lavender (Lola for short)
If I had twin girls, I would name them Luna and Estela 😭😭😭🌕🌝🌜🌙💫⭐️🌟✨
I never watched the Moon Dreamers but I know exactly what it is !

My favourite girl's names are Nora, Amy, Erika, Florence and Katherine. My favourite boy's names are Joshua, Theodore, Caspar, Joseph and Harrison.
I love Delilah for the babies name , it's unique but so so pretty ❣️
my best friend is called violet and we do call her violent violet!!! it all started when she once accidentally knocked a starbucks out of her brother's hand and it escalated from there...
I did this video too!!
I love having the name lacey because it is quite unusual so for you to say it's one of your favourites makes me so happy ☺️❤

Gotta admit i'm not a fan in louise's baby name style slightly too middle class for me
Lol my name is Violet and yes sometimes they call me violent violet but I've embraced it! Hahaha
If I ever have children my little boys name will be Alyster Matthew and my little girl will be Dylan Irene ☺️
My son's name is Landon. 😭 Lol Don't worry, I'm not offended. Maybe it's just a more popular name here in America. ☺️ Enjoyed hearing your list of names! Can't wait to see your little bundle! 💕
I find it quite funny that Aubrey has become a trendy girls' name.  My 82 year old grandad is called Aubrey 😂
I have my gender scan on Monday and if it's a boy it's going to be called hunter. Not many people like it but I love it😍
My baby cousin is called Coco Riley 😽😽
I love the name Lea (pronounced Lee) for a girl, and I really want to name my daughter that (whenever I have one); I also love the names Lily, Luna, & Artemis
I think the babies name is Florence. I would guess Delilah or Lucy but I think you've already said its not a D name or L in case Darcy feels the odd one out. I can't wait to find out though, I love names haha! xx
So your telling me....if you would've had a boy....it could've been called Daniel...AND THEN DANIEL HOWELL COULD MEET DANIEL PENTLANT?!??lol I'm glad your having a girl tho! XD CONGRATS AGAIN LOUISE!!!💕
Ohhhhh one of my favourite names is Coco as well. My bub is due in mid December and we have picked a name that we are HOPING will stick with the nickname Coco (if we have a girl that is!) ❤❤
I love the name Aubrey but for a boy?
Celeste!! That's me name 😂
I have a feeling baby Pentland is going to be called Lyla! Otherwise I feel like Lyla would have been on Louise's top 3 favourite girls names list 🤔🤔🤔
Ive just posted my first ever video... please can someone watch it and let me know what you think? i was very nervous doing it haha#
I have a lovely little red head crazy girl child called Luna. \nI didn't realise it was such a popular name for pets though 🙈😩.
I think the baby's name could be Lucy. She said if she had two girls they would be Lila and Lucy, and then if it was boy/girl it would be Percy and Lucy, so clearly she likes Lucy more than Lila. And Percy is very similar sounding to darcy, and she said she liked the way they sound together 😀
*_See the video to write this type of comments_* \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbNVxS5Wumo
My 14 month old nephews name is Hunter and he is just the most gorgeous  \nthing in my life.
OMG AUBREY AND HUNTER ARE MY FAVORITE BABY NAMES EVER!! ❤️
I am sooooooooo curious as to the babies name bc there is such a wide range of names you like 🤔😊
My guess is your Baby's name will be Lucy, or maybe Delilah.
my name is celeste!
I love Louise
Darcy and Daisy sound nice
Yah choose Lucy!!

Hi lovely my name is Maryam I did your nails in Brighton, you are such nice person in real life as well x
Idk if Mike's running problem is what I think... Lol. But cyclists use a cream called chamois cream. Maybe that would help? Why am I typing this on the internet lol 😂😂😂
Fleur don't be so self conscious you look beautiful! The dungarees look is so cute on you 💕
Nike sells running shorts with built in undies. A lot of college cross country athletes wear them. But they are very short!!!
Fleur looks effin gorgeous!
You look great!! Pregnancy wears well on you 😍😍
Loved the vlog, as usual! If Mike's problem is chafing then the Nike Pro shorts are really good, and also an anti-chafing roll on called Body Glide. My husband runs a lot and started experiencing this problem but the above solutions fixed it!
I find it so sweet when u say how rude at something naughty lol xo
It makes me so happy to see you this happy! 😍
It's so weird seeing Mike and Mark in the same video :P
You look stunning!😍😍😍😍
Brighton is awesome
Love the vlog.  Thanks, Fleur.
18 miles way yo go!!!
omg, piggy and the bump put the biggest smile on my face, sooooo cuuuute!!!
FOOD LOOKS SO GOOD😍😍
Aww Mike needs those finger puppets
Yay a vlog !! ❤️❤️ sending you love
Those games are always rigged lol
Fleur you are glowing GORGEOUS 💕❤️
should've come into Photomatic
Favourite vlog ever 😂💕
Yay, love your vlogs xx
My miniature dachshund Chester would love piglet soooo much 😍💗
Cutest couple ever 👫💖
You are glowing 😍
You look lovely Fleur, and rocking those dungarees!
You two just so special and so precious! No YouTuber makes me so happy as you Fleur! You are just a Light that brightens up our lives! <3
Remember to take your little lady back to the arcades when she is old enough 😁
Speaking over Mike has gotten worse. Poor Mike, can't get a word in edgewise ever.
What´s with all the spam, cut it people!
I love your blogs so much, so relaxing to watch ! xxx
Haha. Having his golf clubs stolen is also my bf's worst nightmare! 😂
Not sure if u see all these comments,but just wanna say I think u and Mike are such a lovely couple. So happy,joking and generally smiling all the time. Nice to see.xx
I was in Brighton that weekend too! 😃 xx
any small YouTubers want to be friends ?❤️❤️
Hi  guys love this vlog on Brighton.  Sooo pretty. Cary Grant  I believe was from Brighton.  If you don't know Cary Grant,  ask your parents. We think you look good Fleur.  Love Piglet,  Squidge and Tregal too,  soo sweet!  Fleur  love your vlogs, always do a good job. Love seeing you and Mike. We are waiting for Mike to dance like Fred Astaire.  Fun Joan and Keith Bates
Love Under Armor compressions for 🏃 running!!!
.....Fleur you look bloomin  gorgeous in this video......
Love your vlogs Fleur, you look gorgeous ❤️where are your little hoops from??
Thank you for this lovely video, it is really nice to play like a child made me laugh.\nYou look amazing
You two are SO cute. PS--Loved Mike's ice cream! <3
Well, one thing for sure, you look absolutely adorable pregnant!  Too cute!
Mike just wears a black shirt and black pants like a regular guy. Simple no need any introduction.
We stayed at the Artist Residence my blog post went live today and my vlog went live a few weeks ago from it you should check it out we also went to Red Roaster for brunch!! :)
your tummy!!!!!! I'm in love!!!!!! xxxxx
Awww I had my masters in Sussex Uni in Brighton 3 years ago, your vlog brings so much memories back to me! And as always you and Mike always make me laugh, definite couple goals!!
Aw Mike go back and get they toys for the baby so cute xxx
I think the old Taylor is alive, too. Fleur you're amazing! I am looking up to you😉
I absolutely love these vlogs! Almost typed dogs instead of vlogs because they're also adorable !
Yikes, Mike I hurt just watching you walk....pain..guy be careful!
Fluer! You crack me up. Its never to early to baby toys or older stages of clothing. They will need them before you know it. It moves fast! :)
Ooooh can't believe I didn't see you! You were right by my flat!
I got way too invested in you guys trying to get the unicorn pug, the disappointment I felt when you didn't get one was real hahahaha
Fleur, have you heard of a dad shirt? it's made by Lalabu.
I've had a claw machine pick up the toy and then release it before going back to the hole. They are rigged! It didn't slip out it opened up and dropped it 😩
You guys are awesome!! Hope your enjoying your week!  X
Fun vlog!  I am glad you and Mike stand up to each other!  Hahaaaa!
Pregnant little Fleur is so adorable! You're the cutest pregnant person!
Nike pro undershorts will solve the problem! My husband runs 22 miles plus often and swears by them xx
FYI- if Mike is having aches and pains from running, swimming is supposed to be great for those muscles, but also for joints and your spine!
Bill Gates must drink himself a cup of quarters before going to bed. You guys reminded me of the Claw from Toy Story. Did you get a toy in the end? The baby will be crazy about it. No! Don't infect the baby with all that Taylor Swift shit! Let it listen to Whiplash by Metallica since Mike is such a fan! I know that it has two f-words in it but still. LOL! I'm sorry if that was insensitive. Anyway, congrats, you guys! Happy for both you. BTW, Fleur, you're already a mother of three as far as l'm concerned. You've done good job taking care of the poopies and Piggy wiggy, so you're already halfway there.
why are the dogs on a ball ban , lol
Fleur did you end up getting the pug??
You looked cute in the dungarees!  Aww, I want one of those pugs dressed like a unicorn 🦄 and Piglet is so adorable when she rubs her face with her paws 😍
What nail polish are you wearing? I love that shade.
What a coincidence! In case anyone wants to be undie twins with Mike AND wants a bargain, Luxury Travel Diary is holding an auction for £100 Runderwear voucher. Current bid is only at £7! https://www.luxurytraveldiary.com/auction/?ult_auc_id=39037 (Auction ends in a month though)
yay for vlogs! so wonderful to see you again!
Oh Fleur you always make me laugh. ...Thursday ha ha.
I missed ur vlogs so happy to see ur blog today! The baby bump is so darn cute. I have two kids and I miss feeling the baby in the belly my boys r 8 and 14.
you look the CUTEST in your dungarees and metallic shoes <3
Mike should check bike shops for his rounderwear. His issue is a biking issue as well so they may have something 😊
Tell Mike to buy Bamboo underwear - Amazon - that is what my husband uses and he loves them!
Mike needs to get a pair of triathlon shorts  for that problem
omg I love the new taylor swift song, especially that chorus
aww Mike, when we're doing story time
You have git the preggo walk going on haha so cute!
Love that you were in Brighton and recognised everywhere you walked from my first visit in June! Can't wait to go back love it!
Always wanted to go to Brighton! Such a cute town! Btw, you totally rocked the overalls! :) Your baby bump is starting to show! :D
Love the little hand puppets for story telling, Mike you're going to make such a good daddy! Love your videos Fleur and thanks for showing us your bump! ;)
So nice to have an update! You guys are so cute!
OMG the f'n claw!!! LOLOL Was laughing so hard with that. So addicting!! You guys are adorable.
Hahaha I absolutely loved this vlog you guys made me laugh so hard  😂
You 2, I mean 3 are adorable!!!  XOXO from Eagle Rock, CA
Ahhh love your vlogs! I'm subscribed now. Keep up the great videos.
I think overalls and long dresses look so good on pregnant woman! You need the tshirt that says, Don't eat watermelon seeds 💕
You and your dumb are so gorgeous... Mike is pretty handsome too xx
I'm trying to get pregnant... just started.  You are 100% my style icon!!!💙💙💙
You seem so happy in the video. What a fun weekend!
You guys always put a smile on my face! I hope Mike got his special pants to protect the Jewels DeForce! LOL :-)
Brighton looks lovely! I will definitely add them to our must see list. What is the name of the last restaurant you were at? I think I missed it. Piggles looks completely ok with the wood floors now. Glad you had a good trip! Hugs, Summer xo
On Thursday! Oh Fleur! ;)\nYou're too funny hahaha
I love that your daughter will be able to watch these videos of you and her dad : )
PLEASE LET MIKE SPEEEEEEAK

Come on, look at her and Mike's faces. The baby would look like an angel.

If you are reading this, then you are wasting precious time reading the comments. You will probably comment or like this, but you will waste more time. You are now thinking what I am on about, probably thinking that I am on something. However you are just wasting more time reading my comment. I have just wasted precious moments of your life that you could have spent sleeping or smoking weed. If you just realised, I have wasted more time explaining that I have wasted time. For this reason you might as well like this comment, as you might as well waste more time. Thank you for your wasted time.

Reagan made the mistake of amnesty first with security to follow (it didn’t).dem subsidy payments to insurance companies that inflate outrageous prices under Obamacare using daca/dapa to abuse citizens

Why does this guy sound like Bob Belcher from Bobs Burgers???
You're quickly becoming a legend
I heard my local fire station tried this juicy chicken recipe (specifically the mustard one). Right as they finished, the fire engine caught aflame and they actually put it out with the juice from this chicken. It's that good. Tragically their chicken was dry after the effort and they had to make a new batch.
how tf do you only have 800k subs? Youre a fucking God

Fucking hanzo mains
These are some serious Hanzo mains...
I have your merch
Christensen played last season with Thorgan Hazard and this season with Eden and Kylian Hazard 😱
5:21 Your hair Lolllllll troll hzarad
christensen get some fat and he will become super defender with age 21
Eden Hazard doesn't play FUT... He put his overall below his Flag, Club, and position while David Luiz and Andreas Christensen got it right. 😂
Crazy how Hazard has the best dribble and chance creation stats in europe with a 76% success rate but has a lower dribble rating than Messi and Neymar. and whats crazier is Ronaldo is only 2 behind him on 90 with only 25 successful dribbles last season
Do man united next
David Luis is fantastic character. I love Rio. What a legend though I'm not even Man united fan.
Guys please if everyone donates something we can get him off the street. I dont have much myself and know how its like. go to his go fund me\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/helpanthonyoffthestreet
Imagine Leicester city players growing from 70 to 80+ from FIFA 16 to 17😂
2:09\nLooks like they're pointing guns at them to make them talk
Am I the only one who would've kept David Luiz's card as he predicted it? I mean sure, he'd be a CB Ruud Gullit with not as good dribbling but it's true that his shooting and pace should be higher.
Where's batshuayi i \nwanted to see his reaction to his stats XD
Really no respect for david and christensen
The shooting and passing should be more than 64 and 74 WTF?!
Wtf .. David luiz shooting should have been much higher
I love the background music !! On all videos! It's just so classy.
I hate how fifa has a preset of player ratings based on their position, like assuming that defenders have a passing and dribbling between 50-60 rated, thats not fair. \n(IMO: they should do the ratings based on the season stats/numbers of the player)
This was hilarious, thoroughly entertained, more of this please :)))
this is soooo cringy, cuz players dont care about their stats on a videogame...
Luiz has a better shot than strikers, and he's right, his left foot is mad.\n\nShould be 5* weak foot\n84 shot
My friend  everytime says Liverpool is better than Man Utd and the only thing am telling   is 26 years :D
dont you just love Luiz's personality??
FIFA need to improve David shoting it least but it 70
What's the song
What is the song ?
Damn it five INVEST IN YOUR FUCKIN SOUND RECORDING JEEEZZUZZZZ u want it to be top notch but the sounds is fuckin balls...
Rio: anything you're not happy with\nEden: Your hair
That Christiansen sounds bare English
Poor Christensen he looks so disappointed 😟 He deserves more. Even Rio admitted how good his passing is 😡😡
No respect-hazard 😂
Am I the only one who was waiting for to say You just got marked at the end
FIFA gives the defenders no respect tbh,shooting and pace could be improved to almost all defenders
These two are really funny man . Damn !
David and hazard seems like they are very good friends:)
The shot rating of defenders are actually a joke just because they are defenders it doesnt mean they cant shoot
How come Rio looks tiny next to David Luiz? I thought they were supposed to be the same height.
rio says one and only hazard yet he has like 10 brothers and luiz and christensen are the truly one and only \n#clownseverywhere
loved how rio and eden called out fifa for just taking the piss
What about David's Hair rating\n\n\n99 LONGNESS     99 CURL\n\n99 BRAZILIAN      99 SWAG\n\n99 DAVID              99 LUIZ
I'm subscribing to anyone who likes this comment and subscribers to me. Just comment done✓ so i can know
66 physical for Hazard is joke. The only way people can get him off the ball is by fouling him. He's not a tall or physically imposing player, but he doesn't get pushed off the ball easily.
COME ON PREM TEAMS IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SHOW THEM HOW YOU CAN PLAY LIKE IN PREMIERSHIP. (COME ON!)
The is the thing that slows David Luis is his Afro(keep the Afro David Luis 
I love how close hazard and luiz are
I want more of this pls, show me ronaldo, i wana see his first when he hears he is not the number one rated player on fifa lol
I'm sure hazard already googled his
whats the music at 5:17
ngl i love it when Hazard says because it's true man! to david luiz aha
What did ea take?\nAndreas christensen was in the top 20 fastest players in bl last season and you give him 64 pace??\nAt least 75
pause the video at 4:25 😂😂😂
One and only mate
Surprised Luiz didnt make all his stats 99. \nBut Christensen has a good rating with quite poor main stats.
I'm in the gym everyday man. Lol this was gold!
My right ear enjoyed this..
Luiz has an Amazing shot . Especially on dead balls are Fifa drunk?!
Good funny video, David luiz is really funny.  Eden- shooting, Luiz where is this shooting, i never seen this before cx
''I know me ,man''
damn even luiz knew his pace should be higher lol
As a Chelsea fan i just want to that Chelsea looks like the best club to play for, nice players and staff. GREAT TEAM! CHAMPIONEEEE💙💙💙💙💙💙
You go gym everyday I died 😂😂😂
It would be so cool next too the du ballon do'r every year they do this every September live with all the players of the top clubs of Europe....\nFifa stats rate your own card?
I nvr knew rio has his own u tube channel.. Subscribed 
Rio please can i have the David Luiz or Hazard signed Fifa card?
Funny lads
Mane'-99
Lmao hazard put 5 for his defending lololol
Song Name please
wow... posh accent from Christensen, amazing...
someone finnaly got there ratng right
Nice more pls

Eden is too jokes.
Edens banter is top notch
Christensen sounds like hes from London
Hazard ❤❤❤
Fedt at se en dansker i stort rampe lys🇩🇰
London is RED#ARSENAL
Hazard better than Sanchez?? hahaha what a joke!!
In the Premier league there is no player better in individual ability and talent than Eden Hazard.
OMG IT'S REMAKE IT'S A FREAKING REMAKE!!!11\n\nLove you Nintendo (=^w^=)
Did they really just bring back the worst mario party 9 minigame ever to exist
I like the collection of marip party 5 mini games. The best mario party!
I would be interested if there were any boards you know the things that things that gave  the minigames purpose but nope just updated looks with nothing beside it i mean clearly minigames can't hold thier own game  remember the new super Mario bros for the og Nintendo ds
Really sad this isn't on the Switch.
_MY BODY IS READY_
No online? What's even the point of buying it?
How can they have 100 of the best minigames and it not just be Paddle Battle 100 times?
The only Mario Party I truly adored was 8 without a doubt.
im so excited i love these mini games and boards have been announced!!!
I'm surprised that they didn't just replace Daisy with Rosalina
Oh my god THAT FLAG GAME AND CHAIN CHOMP WASH ARE BACK FROM MARIO PARTY 8. Let's pray that shake it up returns too
I hope that return move your music from mario party 2
Why Can't This be on the switch
this is a great idea...cant wait
This is the first time I've seen Nintendo actually give waluigi and wario some appreciation
great. why not just fight for the death to win??!!
Might get this. Right now my games to buy are Metroid tomorrow and Ultra Sun.
those are cool, a switch one could have another 100 or something\nas well as some of the mini games of the parties
You dun goofed Nintendo, just give me an HD Mario Party 1,2 or 3 on the switch\nEdit: also I noticed tug of war from MP1, how is that gonna work without destroying your stick on your 3DS?
Man, this game\n\n\nComes out after Miiverse shuts down.\n\nNo posting silly memes about it T_T
This game would have been better on the Switch.
Oh no that fishing game's back
Please put this on the switch not just the 3DS otherwise I love this idea. Though I would love just to have access to all the old Mario partys on my switch.
Rosalina has been confirmed for this game. Why?! I hate this character!
I actually was thinking that they should do this for a while. This is a great idea!
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
I want to see more playable characters as well as returnable characters like Koopa kid, boo, birdo, dry bones, hammer bro, and blooper please.
BUT WHERE'S GRAB BAG AND PADDLE BATTLE?
Where are the game boards?
Are they talking about there is coming every mario party minigames from previously consoles?!?
Does it have any maps, or is it literally just the mini games?
Mario party for switch who agrees
Mario party 8 mini game! I love this one 0:40
WHY NOT SWITCH UGH NO ONE PLAYS MARIO PARTY ON A DS
That Mario beside the logo was snapshotted in Mario Odyssey
Could have a switch version !!
Yes, they brought the Flag pole mini game from Mario Party 8 back! Now how about some DS Mario Party mini games?
I guess it's time to revisit the mini games from MP8, A.K.A one part of my childhood.
this is great and all, but don't you think online would be great for something like this please nintendo PLEASE
I can't wait to watch the top 100 ways Luigi win can win at Mario Party by doing absolutely nothing
Ever since Hudson Soft ended their partnership with Nintendo, there haven't been any good Mario party games since 2007!! So this is a smart decision on Nintendo's part.
I have so much nostalgia seeing the Mario party 4 minigames
If they bring back the Going Somewhere from MP2, my heart will break ❤
>top 100 minigames\n>including at least one of the ones from the original game that was a joystick rotator\n\nYou must have a different definition of top 100.
This is the game I'm going to get when it releases.
This game will be the best Mario Party in a long time.
What would make this game even better  is if they also included 5-6 of the best party boards and if it was for the Switch.
People think that since the switch came out then the 3ds just is obsolete
Why is Waluigi running like that?
Great idea, but should of been made for the switch
I really hope this also have classic mario party board part too and not be just minigame collection.
I'm going to get this to game
this is acatually a very neat idea since prettu much mario party was all about the mini games, \nstill i would prefer that they put like a complete Mario Party game (with some old and nostalgic boards) mix it up witht the 100 mini games, but i really don't mind much if we are gona have a ton of mini games to play with =)
this would've been a good idea...\n\n...if it was an actual mario party game with boards from previous titles and it was on the switch\n\nim not paying for a mini-game compilation on the 3DS, even if some of the games are so nostalgic
If Toad is not a playable character, I'm going to be pissed.
So like... is there a board? Orrrr?
Why is the luck based mp9 fishing game there though?
I wish they would do this for the Switch!
If they return classic boards from the he first installments of the series of original music I'll be happy
I don't have a 3DS D: ...I would definitely buy this on Switch.
I hope Dungeon Duos is in there
Nobody going to talk about Morphie's Law? It looks pretty fun
Please Nintendo, please bring it on the Switch too.
Mario party 1-7 were great games (My favorite being 5). 8 was mediocre, it was fun but lacked good mini games and items were bland. Everything after that was bad in my opinion. 9 was experimental so it passes on the bad idea ,BUT THE FACT THE BROUGHT THE BAD IDEA BACK  FOR 10 WAS JUST A HORRIBLE MISTAKE! I'm so glad we can finally play the good old mini games again. And maybe they add some of the old boards (although this only looks like it only going to be mini games I'm still fine with that)
Mario party for switch anyone?
Why Nintendo you don't put it on the Nintendo switch
PLEASE IF YOU'RE STILL SELLING 3DS NINTENDO I NEED A MARIO PARTY THE TOP 100
wish Story mode will come back like in mario party ds...😞
This is Mario Party's Sonic Mania
THIS IS MY 90S CHILDHOOD!! aaahhh!!\nBut, I really hope there's board games with it. I miss the classic Mario Party so much! IMO Mario Parties up to 4 were the best. Then Mario DS too was fun. I love the stars, the coins, hidden blocks...the classic items too. Man! I need to get my N64 games back.
EVERYONE BUY EIGHT COPIES SO NINTENDO NOTICES AND THEY'LL MAKE A SEQUAL ON SWITCH!!!!!!!
Why isn't this on switch?
Should have added the best board from each Mario party as well
i dont need it... i don't need it...\nI NEED IT
Very good
NO ONLINE?
more..friendships..will be ..ruined
Sooo glad this is happening :D
hoop we get    skiynig mini game and hoxgon heat and plutfrom plaer
Rosalina ....OWWWWWWWWWWWWOWWWWW
Dry Bones playable or riot
3ds? Reaally?
Online play?
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAME!!!!!!!!!!
Minigames remaining I hope to see\n1. Crazy cutter,Skateboard scamper,Platform peril,Bobsled run\n2. Day at the races or bowser's big blast,Lights out,Filet relay(remove honeycomb havoc and Mecha marathon)\n4. Dungeon duos\n5. Panic pinball or Mario mechs(remove heat stroke)\n6. Memory lane,Any mic game,Burnstile,What goes up,Insectride,Wrasslin rapids\n7. Ice moves(bonus)\n8. Shane it up,Speedy graffiti,Saucer swarm,Mosh pit playroom,Boo-ting gallery,Grabby gridiron,Cardiators\n9.Pizza me Mario(remove bumper bubbles)\n10. Watermelon whaling,Fruit scoot scurry,Beeline shrine,Bouncy brawl,Ice slide you slide,Cheep cheep leap,Fuzzy fliers
Mario Party Unlimited
Why is this on the 3DS and not the switch? Local multiplayer is the game's main focus
thank you nintendo
WHERES MARIO PARTY DS!!!!!
Its eatsa pizza
Kommt kein Mario Party für die Switch?😔
0:29 WTF BOOM!
SO, MUCH, NOSTALGIA
*VINNY WAS RIGHT*
Now they should remaster 1-8 for the Switch, just with a few tweaks, like re-animating and re-rendering the characters, boards, and other actions from the older games, retaining the old music and/or re-orchestrating it, removing the mini-games involving the painful control stick spinning or tweaking the controls, and retaining the old SFX from the respective games.
Should be on the Switch. Actually, all 3DS should be on the Switch, tbh
HD Switch version pls Nintendo
we all know the 3ds is at the end of it's life..Pokemon's next game after Utra is a switch Fire emblem is moving to the switch...WHy keep making things for 3ds?
This is the biggest step in the right direction. All we need is a game with great maps, and the same playstyle of the old school mail party games (cough cough, no more having every character be lumped together on some cart or something on the map) to surround these mini games, and we have ourselves a much, much needed reboot to what had originally been a fantastic gaming experience with your friends and family during most of our childhoods.

Lyrics \n\n[Verse 1]\nI wonder, maybe they'd never find me\nI've been waitin' such a long, long, long time to feel it\nSwallowed by the waters around me\nThough I took so many wrong, wrong, wrong turns to see it, woah\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I dance through the blisters at night\nAnd I laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nAnd I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'\n'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah\nI'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more\n\n[Chorus]\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah\nUntil the sun goes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd the dark is gone\nWe made it to the dawn\nAnd I don't miss you anymore\nWhen the sun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again\n \n\n[Verse 2]\nIt wasn't easy tryin' to run with these handcuffs\nI had to sleep through such a cold, cold, cold night to see it\nGreen flashes hit me right where I'm standing\nSunlight cut into your bones, bones, bones, started to heal it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I dance through the blisters at night\nAnd I laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nAnd I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'\n'Til I know I'm alive, alive, yeah\nI'll sit 'til I can't hear words no more\n\n[Chorus]\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love floodin' back again, yeah\nUntil the sun goes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd the dark is gone\nWe made it to the dawn\nAnd I don't miss you anymore\nWhen the sun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again\n \n\n[Bridge]\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nWon't you give it\nGive a little love back\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nWon't you give it\nTurn your light on me\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nGive a little, to get a little love\nGive a little light\nTo get a little love back\nTo get a little love back\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDance through the blisters at night\nI laughed 'til I cried and cried and\nI ran 'til my feet couldn't run no more (no more, no more)\nAnd I sat 'til my lungs were burnin'\nI'm alive, alive\nI can't hear words no more\n \n\n[Chorus]\nSuddenly the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love\nSun comes up again, my love\nUntil the sun comes up\nAnd I feel my love comin' up again\nI can feel my love, I can feel my love\n\n[Outro]\nSun comes up\nI can feel my love comin' back again
the song is pure art and the official video is too , legendary

Why is everyone seeing UB Assembly as a Wall?\nHe looks like a bloody Tower
Nilhilego with hands and legs
UB Assembly adds a whole new meaning to 'Wall'. Things gonna have over 200 Defense and maybe even Special Defense.
Does this mean Togedemauro and Mimikyu also get a Z Move
I feel like my dude Assembly is gonna right Guzzlord's wrongs.
Probably 75 percent of people in the comments about UB Assembly being Trump's wall.
Here’s everyone’s Dawn Lycanro.......\n\n\n\n\nNever mind
Burst is my favorite ultra beast now
Ultra Burst is cool
23rd m8 but 8n't no 1 care. Dont like this comment
Hey we can SOS hunt Mienfoo in Pokémon USUM cool
0:29 looks like we might be able to catch mienfoo in Ultra SM
Ok..... well I did not think we would see more ultra beasts but ok.... loving the necrozma fusions though
What's happening to Pokemon
UB assembly and Gumshoos are going to be gooood friends
Yessss we finally get the game on the same day as everyone else 😁
Who is looking at this comment?
Am I the only one who sees UB Assembly and thinks It's the.... UNKNOWN
I think I've seen these ultra beasts before I think I had desia vu
Is it just me, or does anyone get some Shadow of the Colossus vibes from UB Assembly?
Here before this goes viral!
Assembly will probably have OP defense
Hey Ultra Moon future byuers, you will get yourselves a Guardian of Breathe of the Wild as a slave while us will have It
omg 😱 i cant wait to capture the ultra beast so psyched
Lego for the win 🔥
IT HAD A ZMOVE THIS WHOLE TIME
Don't care about UBs or Necrozma. Give me an offensively built alolan Lapras, possibly with a brand new pre evolution for it, maybe even just do a Gardevoir and Gallade style evolution wherein a male Lapras is a new pokemon entirely.\nGive me a way to get Dusk Lycanroc using my own rockruff so I can breed it it with a good movepool, nature and stats, rather then some randomised one off Rockruff.\nAdd some 6vs6 random battles to the online- 3vs3 can be a 'quick battle' side option so that those who like 3vs3 over 6vs6 arent left out.\nNew Eeveelutions for my boy Eevee! Including a normal type evolution because base eevee- even with a z-move, just aint the same. We need a ghost, rock, ground, bug, flying, fighting, dragon, steel and poison types! Why you slacking Gamefreak?!? You started this thing, and even gave fairy a eeveelution- finish it.\n\nAfter those 4 simple things, you can work on re-balancing the older pokemon or giving them new evo's. Many first and second gen mons havent aged well compared to the pokemon released after abilities and natures were introduced. I hope the plan is for all gen 1 to eventually have 'alolan forms' since those forms are stat and typing re-balances. I mean without changes, mons like mr.mime, jynx, pidgeot, Fearow, butterfree, beedrill, arbok, wigglytuff, parasect, venomoth, golduck, primeape, hitmonchan, hitmonlee, seaking, pinsir, tauros, lapras and many more will never be as great as they were originally when there were still so few pokemon to compete against. Some pokemon like Rhydon, Magmar ect got some love with new evolutions, pre-evolutions, mega evolutions, slight stat increases, alolan forms and whatever else, but theres still so many who havent recieved much love as time has passed.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA I'M SO HYPED! IDC IF YOU GUYS DISAGREE THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
ALL I WANT IS ALOLAN PARASECT PLEASE
Just saw the trailer omg great thing are gonna happen in USUM
Do UB Leviathan! Thats my...idea..well
WHERE'S MY ZMOVE
So scary eye wall, and...firework jester? ....hm....ok! :D
Honestly I hate these ultra beasts
ad revenue
EARLY
UB assembly lol inside is donald trump
Pokemon ultra moon: ASSEMBLY REQUIRED
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
YO
The clown looks so cooooll!!!!!!!
Still nothing about pokewalk :(
Omg I'm dying
Hyped!
The character just smiles while doing z moves Oh I just love destroying innocent pokemon
So Sick!
Alolan Muk bred with Niheligo to create UB Burst
this actually looks DOOOPE
New Ultra Beasts like UB assembly *trump breathes heavily*
Christ!
UB burst is a clown disco ball.
The new Ultra Beasts look amazing!!!
Were going to build a wall and were going to make those ludicolos pay for it-Donald trump
omg i want this so bad!!!!!1!!11!
Holy moly, I would like to have UB Burst
Poe town has a wall around it there is a wall ultra beast now and gumshoos is trump\nGUMSHOOS FOR PRESIDENT 2021
So hyped can't wait😆
😍😜😘😝😀😁😂
burst is cool
I love the new ultra beast. Burst is weird, assembly isn't.
Please extend the Rockruff event because I am getting the game for my birthday and it's in December.
Honestly that clown ultra beast may be my new favourite Pokemon
UB ASSEMBLY is a Minecraft Ultra Beast we are going to THE END confirmed in USUM\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Joke btw
Pokemon Sun 2 and Moon 2.
I'm naming UB-Burst Jester
I need more information about how to evolve rockruff into Dusk form
Assembly is rock-ghost
You need to give lucario a z move plszzzssszzzzzzz😭😭
New Pokemon:\nA square\nNihilego's creepy brother
Yo, but is that UB Burst a disco ball?
I WAS the 2nd viewer
and first to thumbs up
This is weird, but I love how the text doesn't just appear on screen. Also does purchasing early mean preordering or getting it as soon as it comes out?
So we got Trump's Wall and a cake pop
hating these ultra beasts already...
40th
Omg !!!
7th
13th
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
YAS QUEEN UB Burst is fabulous!\n\nCalling Bug/Psychic on it.
Everyone's on about the UBs, but Splintered Stormshards.
Do people still think this game is going to be bad?
Hope UB:assembly can learn fissure
UB Burst looks like something made in freakin' Paint but gets an exclusive something?\n#stopdisscriminatingwalls
3rd
The move UB assembly uses at 1:41 is iron defence. Not any exclusive move or anything.
Digimon Ripoff!!!!
I came from verlisfy stream like if u did too
So... Are Pokemon gonna follow you or nah
It's alright for Juncker. He's an old man! He can create this shit for a considerable percentage of the world's population, take the money and enjoy it for his last remaining few years. Everybody else is screwed! Why would ANY country want ANY of that shit!?
6k views... how is this trending?
I love Brexiting, I am delighted to be getting away from this horrible shower of Cunts.\nThe pain and unhappyness that has been caused to Remoaners, has also been of great delight to me.
Saying it as it is !!
LOL he is right though, i wish we just did a hard brexit and pay no divorce fee at all, screw them we can trade with every were else.
Brexit has been a disaster.
Juncker, the drunk junkie, wants all the toys. So he can break them, when he feels like it.
Thankfully soon we will no longer have to listen to him.
Comparing the EU to Eastern Europe under the Soviets is actually disgusting. People were massacred in their droves, Matyas Rakosi, the first Communist Leader of Hungary is known as the Bald Butcher. People were starving while grain was being sent to the USSR. The cunt needs to get his head out his arse and not chat complete shit. Imagine if he'd said the same thing about Germany but comparing their current economic status with what they had under Fascism?
If you had given Cameron concessions, the brexit vote would never ever have happened Or if David Cameron weren't a self interested twat lmao
Well said Farage 👍
We need other countries in Europe who want to leave the EU to stand up, and take action!\n\nBe proud of your unique history, and its culture.
They are utter fanatical maniacs.\n\nI think a spirit of delusion has entered them.\n\nThey remind my of the verse\n\nThen entered Satan into Judas, and from that time he sought an occasion to betray Jesus.
A little history lesson for you the majority of the British government never wanted to be part of the EU in the first place it was the conservatives who wanted it and went out of their way to invest money into the EU project. the conservatives were voted out and labor stepped in wanting to back away but because we had already invested so much into the EU we were to prideful to just walk away partly due to the money and partly because of the absolutely disgusting (and very typical) attitude of the french towards us at the time an attitude which has never changed. We stayed with the eu despite this but made referendums to our membership one thing that was universally agreed on was the retention of the pound sterling as throwing everything into the euro wold have been stupid, this later turned out to be accurate. anyhooo timeline\n\nThe United Kingdom made its first application to join in 1961. It was quickly apparent that there was a danger of political isolation within Western Europe, Commonwealth states were rushing to do deals with the new bloc, and it had American support. This application was vetoed by the French Government in 1963 with a second application vetoed by the French again in 1967. It was only in 1969 that the green light was given to negotiations for British membership. The United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community (as it then was) on 1 January 1973 with Denmark and Ireland. This proved controversial at the time. The Labour party initially sought renegotiation of membership. This was toned down to requiring a referendum on whether the United Kingdom should remain part of the Community. This referendum was duly held in 1975 with a 67% vote in favour of continued membership.
pure scum talking rubbish! which school he attended this cunt?
Any guesses when the next EU bailout will be?\n\nWill it be Greece or Italy?
What an hypocrite, he acts as he cares of East Europeans, after his Brexit polish & East Eu were first to be attacked by him Nigel farrage Brexiteers supporters, and now most polish and east Eu are preparing to leave as there no promise for them of staying except fake sweet promises
Hey I hope you enjoy this new video! Some 370 of you got to see this early as I accidentally pressed the button that I didn't mean to press so the video was live for about a minute this morning, but here's the real version!\n\nMake sure to check out Squarespace because this video *literally* would not have happened without their support.
Great video! Very informative, very interesting
I'm a simple man. I see wendover prod plane video I click like.
The video seems focused only on Boeing. What about Airbus, Bombardier
Can't we all agree that we all want the same thing out of an aircraft?... NO MIDDLE SEAT!
I love your channel too much that I have seen every single of your video. Twice. Hahaha. Such a powerful information! Very well done!!!#aviation #avgeek x
I see wendover's plane fetish is back.
Yeah i don't think hyperloop is going to be a threat to the air line industry.
That Airbus deal was pure politics.
dude oil prices arnt going to go up that much and they can still make engines more efficient than there current destine by at least 20% more than what the current new  engines destines are. we are still real far off from any electric plans made for travel
Oh hey, its Chinese Sellout Productions in my Feed! Just asking, whens the video on the awesome working conditions in glorious north korea coming out?
Hydrogen fuel cell planes or electric planes that don't depend on the shitty batteries the cars use.
don't planes generally fly over clouds, and in the daytime. put solar on electric planes and extend there travel time
I hope they use electric planes as soon as possible. Using alle the oil until its get expensive as hell, they can go away from oil and let it people who don't have the money to change (heating with oil as example). Sure the big step is to produce a battery that is lighter than a li-ion. There is a video on YouTube that explain the physics of a battery and which elements future batteries can use to get lighter and can use for batteries. As example: helium and hydrogen are both the lights elements (even air is heavier) but you can't use it for batteries.\n\nWhen they start early, this is a right sing. I don't know if it worth putting solar panels on a plane but when, it is worth a try for longer routes. When the government fund these type of planes and makes flying on this planes cheaper. When people don't care if they need 2 hours (or even longer) longer across the Atlantic but they can save money, they will use it. They can use these planes until better batteries are on the market. When the hyperloop comes, planes can lose a lot of passangers. Sure transatlantic routes will take a lot of time until it's build and consumes a lot of money and probably will never come.
Batteries have nowhere near the energy density of jet fuel (nearly 60 times less) and weight is the limiting factor in aircraft performance and efficiency.  Add in the fact that conventional aircraft get more efficient as fuel is burned off while electric aircraft have to lug around dead weight in the form of expended batteries, and I don't see how electric aircraft can ever compete, even on short flights.  Maybe we'll see the electric aircraft of the future dropping AA's via parachute as it uses them up, then at least it might have a chance.
Hi Wendover, one thing you didn't address in this video is the additional strain that large numbers of regional electric plane routes would put on existing airports. For example, Heathrow runs at almost full capacity right now, so if the trains from Edinburgh were replaced by electric planes, where would they land? And what effect would this have on price, efficiency, etc? Thanks
I've still never flew on a plane before :(
today the biggest time and comfort consumer isn't the plane, it's getting to and from the plane. i'd like to hear your analysis and suggestions for what to do about airports. the airport is not even sort of close to where we live nor the place we want to get to which means long drives or train hops. we also spend more time waiting than actually flying. waiting for bag scanning, waiting for check in, waiting to get through security, waiting at customs, waiting in the lounge while other board, waiting in the queue to take off, then again at the other end.\nwhy aren't there more airports and better designed? multiple security checkpoints spread throughout rather than just one you have to walk to, wait at, then walk again all the way to your gate. why is there only one boarding bridge? planes have plenty of doors, why don't we board from at least 4 doors at once? and so on. some of it is costs, but then just sitting at the airport is also very expensive, and airport size could be reduced by half if passenger throughput was increased by reducing waiting time by half - if people need to spend 2 hours at an airport rather than 1 hour, there will be twice as many people and planes at the airport.
blah blah blah double amount of oil price, blah.\nThis is way too general, you cannot even draw the right route across the arctic from london to L.A.
I wouldn't call electric engines weak. Quite the opposite really.
If the 797 has as many problems as the 787 did when if first came out then I don't think it'll do as good as if airbus were to make a new medium range aircraft
hey one question: the 767 or the a330 could replace the 757 or is there something wrong how i think ? or are they too similar to the larger, more long-haul flying planes like 350 or 787 ?
also I think airport taxes are the number 1 cost
or just make a teleporter!!!!
Should share this with bombardier, haha
We went from the Concorde to this ...
Now we need real life lore to make “What’s the future of Toyota Corollas”
6:31 in a video where you calculated all the costs that go into an airplane ticket you stated otherwise...
So electric planes... Does that also mean we get propellors back?? Those were the most beautiful...
If the designer and manufacturer knew it was going to be flown to Birmingham it would have stop production immediately. God knows what happened to him probably killed himself.
This is now officially an aviation channel.
What's actually the plane of the future? The plane of the future hasn't been designed yet. When it is, it will be the plane of the present, and then someone will make another YouTube video asking What exactly is the plane of the future?
first of all. Oil will not double in price unless there is a catastrophic event like World War 3 or a huge continental disaster.
lithium batteries have about 1/100th the energy density of jet fuel. Lithium batteries don't get lighter as you discharge them. A major technological breakthrough will be needed before electric aircraft become practical.
I could see Boeing and Tesla collaborating for electric planes ✈️
This is crap... We'll be using free energy planes
Disagree space right vessel holy highlight candidate accuracy
Oops , ao airbus soes not exist, oh, of course this from the u.s.a. nothing exists outside of the u.s.a.      thanks
Don't expect revolution in comfort from Boeing. The company is only interested in making ever narrower jet that seats the same number of passenger
boeing have been developing an electric aircraft called the sugervolt
The future of aviation is high speed rail.
Electric motors. Technically, engines chemically changes the input to produce motion, whereas motors do not. Hence, fuel engines, electric motors.
I was on the airbus secondary school experience
The train from Edinburgh to London costs about 5000 pounds, great video but its cheaper to fly than take the train in the UK/Ireland
A world without oil. We will never run out.
How about remake the 757
The only thing we need for better electric vehicles is a better battery technology.
Well I dont really fly anywhere so why am I here?
On a science channel, I would have expected at least a little bit about how airlines actually have to start getting away from kerosine much earlier than when oil is used up - given that humans can't quite live on a planet with that climate any longer.\nThis also plays into potential political factors: as soon as more countries start taking action on climate change, the earlier electric aircrafts will rise, just out of necessity. I would have liked to hear sth from that angle, too.
Do you have sources for those oil prices claims? just want to read more about that.\n\nGreat video as always btw
Transatlantic flights are right now a real important thing in the aviation industry, but as the cost of flying goes down and the development of India and especially China picks up pace should'nt Asia become a focus for upcoming plane designs? Just wondering
I was an aerospace students in UK and I got a project from Airbus of developing a plane to replace 757, so they also know that, I just don't know if they are looking into it seriously. Plus, you have no idea how expensive is train in Britain, I took plane from London to Edinburgh instead of train
The 797 look just the same as the 787.
what if Piper is making a large long range jet?
I don't like change
Its great and all,but it would be better if u dont just focus on american planes and american airlines
Could you dive more into the asian air route rather than the us uk route you keep using your arguments on.
you had me until you said, electric is the answer.
You sure love talking about trains and planes Wendover!
Hyperloop is bullshit the math doesn't add up its fake news
Wendover, why doesn't boeing bring back the 757 with more modern features? Why go to a completely new platform with the 797?
I just flew JFK to Dublin on a 757. Super bummer.
What the fuck is up with all of these I'm sure you will appreciate this.. Whoever is doing that please kill yourself
Question: Airbus is working on which plane? There will NEVER/(in current feeling) be a 797, (7E7 became 787 for the asian market, 9's aren't lucky). Boeing bet on smaller airport to smaller airport direct efficient plane, Airbus went for hub to hub flights with transfers/layovers (for efficiency). 747's matched with the 8 series (in capacity), while Airbus had to catch up to the 787. \n\nAirbus is making statements on an E-aircraft, but when the A-380 was announced Boeing had a sonic cruiser in development. Distraction/competition is the name of the game. We are building a plane 10 times better, if you just hold out for 3 more years... or We are about to make a technology leap that renders all current planes obsolete in speed, while lowering cost.\n\nThe name of the game is beat the competition, and in a 2 party (mostly) market, what one will lose the other can gain, and increase the overall market... I don't think anyone expects plane travel to fall in demand, but I think they expect overall comfort to fall in need.
Hyperloop? Really?\n\nNow, on short routes you can't compete with trains. Trains are electric and damn right efficient. A plane won't be able to compete.\n\nThere was project Yellowstone 1 that was meant to replace both Boeing 737 and 757. I wonder if this (797) is it.
???? there will never be an electric long range or even short  range aircraft.. youre silly..\n2ndly.. the 737 has been manufactured 30 years.. the 757 will be upgraded to a 757 long range before a 797 is ever produced..
The 757 is the sexiest
Airbus masterrace
unsuscribed at 6:28
This is not 797
You could make a second channel for aircraft. Call it Wendover Airlines.
Airbus > Boeing any day
Elon fix plz
BOEING = AIRBUS
Fuck Airbus
What about Lapcat?
3:54 WHAT A SHOT!!
Great concept!
Stop copying cold fusion hodts accent
>Hyperloop\nSomeone get thunderf00t in here
797
Love me that 787
Airbus is sooo much better
Another plane video!
Y u focus on frickin boieng u sponsored?
Competition from the hyper-loop? Face-palm.
797! 797! 797!
Hyperloop is Bullshit
And airplanes again
We had a plane of the futute. It was called the Concorde - and the Americans ruined it. Wouldnt be the first thing they ruined.
Way too focused on Boeing
I'm sorry but this video was rather inaccurate and you give Airbus way too less credit! It is actually Boeing who does nothing, they haven't even started development and will lose the MoM race.\n\nThe Airbus 321LR is a suitable replacement for the B757 with 4000NM and 200+ PAX.\n\nAmerican and Delta have quite huge outstanding order of A321, it is very likely that they will convert some of them into LR orders or even order additional batches.
Does the 767 not fit this spot?
The 767 can be flown from NY to Buenos Aires 11 hour flight. No need for this upgrade to a 797.
a 797 won't be popular, just like the A318, as it's body is too wide for it's length, but the same passenger capacity Embraer 190/195 is very popular, becaus of it's thin body, it's way more economical, so a stretched A321 like an A322 will be the best solution as the A321 is almost identical to the 757-200 in terms of specs like MTOW and PAX, just Airbus needs to understand that, the NEO series would have been the perfect opportunity for that, slightly more powerful engines, twin axle main landing gear, as they offered sometimes for markets like India, for landing on bad runways and improved wings.
The 3 times that I've flown on Air Canada in the past 3 years, it's been on an Airbus A310
We're decades away from electric planes.
Bombardier new CS100 series aims at that market i think , and the plane is already starting its service.
You seem to like Boeing like Verge loves Apple products.
Mid-air fucking refueling. How hard is it.
All to well is the best ts song
I love how Andy keeps trying to stir the pot regarding T Swift and not one of these older celebrities gives a shit
its i left my scarf there at your sister house and you still got it in your drawer even now
Olivia B is a legend for asking that question haha! Especially if that's a false name to honour Taylor's cat!
Maggie looks like she's an aristocrat from the 1930's.
all too well is not just A song is THE song
In a song?? All Too Well is #That song
left my scarf there, at your sister's house, and YOU still got it IN YOUR DRAWER even now.
All too well is such a masterpiece
THE SCARF IS CLEARLY IN HIS DRAWR, EVEN NOW
wow people actually ask Maggie about the scarf? lol, it's jake you need to ask!
Lol Maggie doesn't care
Wait a minute... what happened to but you keep my old scarf from that very first week, cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me?  \nI thought she was talking about him not his sister.. i mean yes, she left it at his sister's house at one point but then he got it and kept it to himself
it might not have been about jake?
Jake has the scarf. He keeps it in his drawer, even now.
'All Too Well' is Taylor's Top 5 best songs. PERIOD. That is a fantastic song, I want her and Jake to get back together and break up so she can write a sequel.
All Too Well is the best song to ever exist *period*
Rachel Dawes is Jakes brother?! Small world
If she does have the scarf, please God make her cover up that butter face.
im sure Taylor has many more missing scarves
00:40 is that guy 50 cent???
I feel like she should have Kristen scalls voice
Obviously the scarf is Taylor Swift's innocence (virginity). She left it at his sister's house. Swift's Red is actually her best lyrically with metaphors. Her songwriting skills during Red was even compared to that of Leonard Cohen.\n\n\n\nOh, and the album's title is Red. RED!!!!
All to well is the best ts song...https://goo.gl/czCVJA
All Too Well is her best song
Imagine what'll happen if Taylor releases that 8 minutes version...
NO he still has it! in his drawer, even now
Texas underground artist, trying to better myself and get my family out of the streets, help me get heard, share, follow, repost, thanks 🙏 https://soundcloud.com/legit-tim \nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/open_graph/artist/2950553
Taylors saying I fucked jake at your sisters house
She been looking grandmothery for the last ten years...she just has one of those grandmother faces
inquiring minds want to know. god I'm going to retch.
white women going extinct when white men invent the ai and the artificial wombs deus vult white men already invented a robot that cooks a full meal coming out in 2018 artificial wombs soon will be out \n4-5 years (lets hope) ai females that can talk and have secs alrdy out today and will be more realistic each year / month ..... think about it why do we suffer for white women they only ruin our rep and our white might to virtue signal to the leftist elite and the monky negros\ntech will save the white man
Maggie G. looks like Sloth from The Goonies.
DAFUQ she has on, an aluminum foil dress?
I love Maggie's ring!
Maybe someone can use that scarf and silence Taylor swift.
រឿងសិច
Shes aging quickly
Find in Maggie
Give it back!
Why does she look 90?
*Give it back!*
Secret: Andy Cohen is really......Alex Trebec....
Its my grandma!
50 s laugh...contagious 😂😂😂😂
Taylor's too ugly for jake anyways... Cringy piece of shit.
Her face reminds me of that old episode of the Twilight Zone, when the old man that was dying made his relatives wear masks to recieve their inheritance. js
well said Maggie who cares, swiftards should get over it, Taylor's  BS is exhausting
Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina 😊 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg
She's ugly.
All too well is the best song that Taylor has ever written. Yes, the equivalent to ATW in her other albums are 'back to December', 'clean' etc... but it's by far the most beautiful she has ever composed. It's her 'case of you' know whattamean.
Damn how desperate for 'drama' is he to ask a irrelevent stupid question!!Never mind the person making a career out of bashing old partners/friends..
I think everyone agrees she's one of the ugliest actresses ever 💯😎
She might not have that scarf but she sure has the face of a hound dog ...😕😕😕😕
Maggie Gyllenhaal is one of Hollywoods ugliest celebrities.  Proof that you don't need talent or good looks to become famous, just Jewish connections.
WHY DON'T YOU AFRICAN FOLKS GET BACK TO AFRICA AND SPEAK YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES AND LIVE WHERE YOU BELONG AND LEAVE US CAUCASIAN PEOPLE AND OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE ALONE AND GO FUCK YOURSELVES! GO MIND YOUR OWN AFRICAN BUSINESS IN AFRICA LIKE THE ASIANS MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS IN ASIA LEAVE CAUCASIAN WHITE PEOPLES ALONE. GO HOME. GO MAKE SOME POP AND RAP MUSIC IN YOUR OWN AFRICAN LANGUAGES IN AFRICA YOU MUDDAFUCKAS!
Anyone else really pumped to see Wilshere back? I'm sick of the sight of Ramsey.\nHaving sweet flashbacks of Wilshere goal vs Norwich and his classy performance against Barcelona in 2011.
Can't believe Wenger not starting wilshere, and picking Niles ahead of Nelson, Niles proved In Australia he is not good enough yet , He needs to go out on loan
Debuchy should be commanded in right-back because Niles isn't a right-back
Like the formation and team but think holding may start as Chambord had a thigh strain
Robbie, I really like that. As you say we're really using our squad here. AW should be worried.
It's time for the SHIT show!!!!!!
Still they persist with Jack Wilshite, when will gooners realise that the lad is a waste of time?\nI'm convinced this lot would give Ian Huntley several chances at minding your kids 😂
No disrespect robby but this why arsenal we never go foward look at how chelsea played yesterday against a team called Qarabag they used theyre starting xi because they dont want to risk so why is lacazette not playing and the others
such a bad team as a arsenal fan
Gotta admit rob i hate that defence lol. Like the rest of the team
That team will lose lol. the centre midfield is so so so weak. not a talented selection.
Happy with your starting 11. I would also like to mention, you can add Chuba Akpom on the Subs section, as a backup for any of the 3 forwards
Hey Robbie, I like your formation and line up choices but this is how I would line them up. 3-4-2-1 with Ospina in goal. Chambers - Per - Holding\nAinsley - El neny - Wilshere - Iwobi\nNelson - Adelaide\nGiroud\n\nPlenty of youth, creativity and they have played together at a lower level giving them that air of familiarity with each other. A good solid spine filled with experience. Also, with Wenger coming out and saying that he isn't really prioritizing the cup, I'd like to see him use the cup to unleash the next generation.
I thought Maitland Niles was a midfielder
NO NO NO PLAY 2 UPFRONT\n  STAY 3 AT THE BACK
Well thought out...but Wenger will not revert to a back 4....because he's stubborn like that.
Arsenal have the player's, look what they did to Chelsea twice at Wembley, after having a bad season still win trophy,when they get it right ,can beat anyone , haven't  found that balance yet this season
Wouldn't Start Giroud. Need pace through the middle
I miss u,jack!!!😀😀
Say what you want about Wenger, but I can't help but be impressed that this will be the first season in my lifetime that Arsenal are in the Europa League. Might be time for a change, but it was really weird to realize this.
One of the interviewed Koln supporters pessimistically predicted 5-0 to Koln ? And the rest.
I need Iwobi to stay healthy and become a force in the team.
set iwobi in elneny's positions or maybe stoper!!!!!!   mertesaker have more tecnique than him!
Bar Monreal, there is no regular starter in that team. Normally I'd disagree since I'd want a few more starters and to prioritise the cup a bit more, but it's the first Europa league game so I'm not too worried. The Chelsea game worries me and I'd want our players at their absolute best. I'd take a loss at FC Koln if it means we beat Chelsea.
switch chambers and bfg just to allow an experience player next to a young player
How can I get that jacket please I need the link 😩
well said robbie, put a b team out, and finger's crossed if/when we reah the quarter's, then we can put out a strengthen team.
He's coming for Wengers job!
Arsenal will not win the league. Premier or Europa. Arsenal will not finish in the top four. Get used to the Europa, Arsenal. No more Champions for you. After Sanchez leaves next year you will be a mid table team. No quality player will be caught dead at Arsenal. As a fan of AFTV this is good news for me. More losing means more ranting.😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Great start 11. I agree with the selection and formation. It’s time to start playing 4 at the back again
Play Chambers as a right back. Not a centre back.
Poor Arsenal fans still hoping that Wilshere comes good one day.
Ha.You nearly as mad as Wenger in your selection. .Interesting.
Niles is shit at RB did u watch the chelsea game in pre season, cmon  robbie mate
Why not play Debuchy at RB? Dude is still a decent RB, how about we play him since we are already paying him???
Get used to it arseholes.😂😂😂😂
Debuchy at RB, Maitland-Niles is not a right-back. Had enough punishment and embarrassment playing that position during pre-season..\n\nEdit: Reiss Nelson isn't a left-sided winger by the way.
I not a gambler, but I must admit, an Arsenal win at 4/9  is pretty good while it available. Lets blood a few  young guns, and obliterate Cologne in the process with a dazzling display off football, and a hatful off goals to boot. Jack has to feature  as he has good visual awareness, and brilliant technical ability, a 4 nil drubbing be good, , ha ha,  COYG...
Totally agree with this starting 11
Why hasnt sanchez signed a new contract .................oh wait 😂
Hey Robbie, I agree with this starting 11 if we are playing a back 4. If not, then I think Nelson should be the RWB -or- on the left side of the attacking 3 with Walcott on the right and Giroud in the middle.\n\nEither way, I think this would be a strong enough squad to get past Koln fairly comfortably.\n\nCOYG!!!
if wenger plays that team, put all your money on koln!!
Maitland-niles isn't a RB. He's a CM.
Great starting 11. Wouldn't go exactly with that but I would be take that team sheet and I would be happy!!
I would make two changes to your squad Robbie, Sanchez for nelson and debuchy for Niles, we need them fix debuchy needs to be ready in case anything happens to bell he's big n strong n we need that.
We've got a quality striker in the under 21s called edditth or something like that he should start
Please dub in the sound effect of a needle scatching across an LP after the words Europa League\nI am going to enrol on ANY course on Thursday evenings just to retain my sanity......I might take further French and see if it is possible to understand Wenger LOL
Lets be honest, this team would lose
Guys, I  need a reliable link to watch the game
Really good team apart from id give debuchy a game
We need to win it. We're not getting into top 4 this season! Worked for Man U!
Robbie I agree that we should rotate between 4-3-3 and 3-4-1-2 but realistically thats not going to happen so Robbie I would like you to have realism in these videos.
It's official... Robbie is smoking crack...
Why is Iwobi a pivot man like Jack? Isn't Iwobi a forward? Elneny should play alongside Jack. As far as I know Iwobi doesn't have any proven distribution skills like Elneny? Why not play a 4-2-3-1 with Giroud up front and Iwobi right behind Giroud as the center forward? That way we shift Iwobi up to the front line and still have two midfield defenders in Elneny/Wilshere with Jack being the deep-lying play-maker and Elneny sliding behind as a sweeper/extra defender if needed? \n\nI'm not against playing a 4-3-3 Robbie but the guys are very familiar with the 4-2-3-1. It really comes down to what Wenger has been practicing and drilling them for. We could see 3-4-2-1 also. It's tough to say until we see the lineup and know what formation Wenger will use. I'm also wondering what subs are going to be available?
Ospina Holding mertesacker chambersNelson elneny wilshere debuchy Iwobi walcott Giroud
Robbie sets up the team to boost AFTV ratings after the game.
Stop bitching ur now in a comp u have a chance of winning at least no hammering from Bayrn munich this year
Robbie why don't you do a starting 11 with a 3-4-3 formation as well?
Feel like watching a tutorial
YO ROBBIE, WAGWAN FAM??? \n\nLISTEN, MAN TINKS ARSENAL SHUD TAKE DA EUROPA LEAGUE SERIOUSLY BRUV, JUST LIKE HOW MAN UNITED DID LAST SEASON, YA GET ME FAM?! \n\nMAN TINKS IT WOULD BE A GREAT STEP FOR ARSENAL TO WIN DA EUROPA LEAGUE! \n\nF THEM OTHER BLUD CLART HATER33 ALLL DEY DO IS HATE ON ARSENAL. I JUST HOPE WE CUD SHOW DEM MANDEMS WAGWAN INNIT!
Arsenal have a total of 0 European trophies (and don't count the one inter fairs cup which was more a marketing tool than a genuine competition). They have an opportunity for a very winnable European cup that has a fantastic prize. A cup that is highly respected across Europe and certainly better than any domestic cup. And what's arsenal's attitude? Let's sack it off and put the kids n reserves in smh try n win it n earn some respect back across Europe..  Maybe player would actually wanna sign then
I think Debuchy can get a chance. I don't know whether he is fully fit or not.
that look good.... I would repalce maintland niles for chambers and put holding in defence. I love the wilsh/lson idea... pleaed in under 21 alreadhy together
this Is why your not a manager Robbie, putting iwobi in cm lmfao
Do anything but play walcott
Back 4 is the best...u gat it robbie.
Id go with 4-2-3-1\nOspina\nMaitland-niles\nPer\nChambers\nMonreal\nElneny\nWilshere\nWalcott\nIwobi\nNelson\nGiroud
Decent Starting 11 👌👊
. . . . . . . . . . . . Ospina........ Chambers. . . . . . . Mertesacker. . . . . .holding \nNelson. . . . . . Wilshere. . . .. Elneny. . Monreal\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Walcott. . . . . Iwobi. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Giroud \n3-4-2-1 perfect mixture of both experienced and youthful players.
Robbie not too sure  \n\nOspina\n\nNilles\nBig\nMustaphi\nthe beast kolasinac \n\nElneny\nJack\nWalcott\nIwobi\n\nLacazet Giroud
Maitland-Niles is no good.
Swap maitland-niles with Debuchy.
I think it will be: opsina \n       Chambers BFG holding \n     Niles jack elneny monreal \n         Iwobi giroud sanchez \nSubs theo nelson kolasanic beilke welbz macey
Chamber and holding cb partnership👀👀
Great pick #CrucialRobbieIn
2 nil big dreams
Oliv-yay not Olivia
not bad
Good 11
Damn Robbie a better manager than Arsene
opsina \nNiles chambers holding monreal\nelneny wilshere Rambo \nwalcott giroud. iwobi
Robbie should be tutoring Wenger
Wilshere the white Diaby
Giroud\n                  Sanchez               Nelson\n\nMonreal     Wilshere       Elneny   Maitland Niles\n         \n             Holding Mertesacker Chambers\n\n                               Ospina\n\nMaitland Niles better at wing back then full back, Sanchez and Walcott interchangeable. Looking at our midfield options how did we not sign a DM this summer
Your forgetting reainy Adelaide
wenger will probably play 3 in defense : bfg, holding monreal. He will play sanchez and giroud thats fa sure. Wilshere sub.
#RobbieSellout
What about akpom?
Team is trash
Maitland  miles 😂
very good 11 robbie
Reiss Nelson must start
My team line up is \nOspina\nDebuchy\nChambers\nMertasacker\nMonreal\nElneny\nXhaka\nWilshire\nIwobi \nPerez \nNelson
Ospina\nChambers      BFG       Holding\nNiles      Elneny      Wilshire      Iwobi\nNelson            Giroud            Sanchez
Ospina\nChambers BFG & Holding Monreal\n                 Elneny Jack\nTheo           Iwobi          sanchez\n                      Gioud \n\nTake out sanchez around 60' and then put nelson.
Tottenham 3 Dortmund 1
oh fc köln erster fc köln su bist mein verein ich liebe dich :):):):)
My team for tomorrow :\n                               Ospina\n\n         Chambers   Mertesacker   Holding \n\nDebuchy           Elneny       Wilshere      Monreal \n\n         Walcott                                  Welbeck \n                                 Giroud
Arsenal is such a joke now...
Offload jack wilshere
Has that under the dome feel
Well there's gotta be some kind of a bad guy or a horrible conflict to overcome lol... Or just all rainbows and unicorns? 😍🤗🐣
I think Hank Pym can solve that resizing issue can't he?
After reading Michael Crichton's posthumous novel Micro, there's no way in Hell I'd trade my rung on the food chain ladder and be at the mercy of centerpedes, spiders, ants, etc. The levels of voracious savagery present within the smaller world makes a pride of lions tearing apart a baby zebra, alive, look like a tea party. \nNo thanks. \nI probably will go see the movie though.
Honey, I Shrunk the Kids meets The Truman Show; looks like a winner!
Wait a second did Hollywood actually just pull a new concept for movie out of their bag of sequels and remakes I'm shocked
Does this movie have actually any plot?
lmao this trailer suprised me. I thought it was going to be bullshit but this looks so interesting
Dear Hollywood. Yes!!! WE LIKE ORIGINAL SCREENPLAYS!!!!!!!!!!!!  NOT OVER DONE SPECIAL EFFECTS SJW BS.
So to grow back again do they set the small ray to wambo?
1:36 love that part... he check his thing first.. looks like things i would have done too
Why do I feel this is going to take a REALLY ugly turn somehow.
So I guess the giant insects start to attack.
When Hank Pym accidentally leaks the Pym Particle to the public.\n\nOr maybe it was Scott.
It's cool till a bird or raccoon or something comes into the town and destroys the town and eats everyone
I love this concept
Yea but then a falcon swoops in and the next thing you know, you're inside the stomach of a bird.
I have a feeling that everyone is going to begin turning small and the $50,000 which turned into 12 mil, will turn back to $50,000....because people are greedy and stuff. Also, probably going to be some size racism.
Let's get small...Steve Martin
I have so many questions!
Geez and I thought by the end of this trailer that Matt Damon was going to be a super soldier that summons ants to his aid😕
water would kill you if you are that small. You'd touch a single drop of water, and it would swallow you, and wouldn't be able to break the surface tension from the inside... and you'd drown. I hope i havn't ruined the movie though :D
Am I the only one kinda creeped out by this?
This is the most ridiculous trailer I have ever seen. But Christoph Waltz is in it so it must be good.
Totally want to see this!!!
Then a hurricane hits and floods the area they all die
Enjoy fighting bugs to death with armys.
what happens if someone farts on their house ?
0:32 is my school's cafeteria
This could so easily turn into a horror movie...
Humanity wants to grow in evolution and wealth, intelligence not downsizing so the politicians can press them with their foots as they were ants... Hollywood is a great tool to make peopled obey to educate their subconscious minds negatively.
Matt Damon looks like Kane in the thumbnail
Plot twist will be that when you are Downsized you live a shorter life unless you are given some sort of chemical to pro-long your life and this is how the world is going about minimizing the population.
Doraemon fans gets to line up.
I'm digging this
This is so strange and I love it
I'm just waiting for Jimmy Kimmel now, to comment on this and bring the feud live again! That'd be something!
Jesus there's so many scammers in this comment section
Reducing our ecological footprint by reducing our physical one...and disregarding the land mammals and birds that would kill us if we ever did this. Makes sense?
I'M TINY RICKKK
Honey I shrunk the kids!!!
Until it rains..
What a genius premise!
Um..... Yes
Tiny house movement.
But im already short
Honey, I shrunk Jason Bourne!
Looks dumb.
Well this would make abductions soooo much easier for the aliens... 👽 lol!
I will go and see this. Very interesting.
Now this looks interesting
That moment when they shot a scene at your high school for this movie and waited over a year to see the trailer and when you finally do see it then you notice that they put green screens everywhere so you probably won't even recognize your school when the movie comes out and your left disappointed..........still a great trailer though.
Similar 'Plan 1/8 from UltraQ' in Japan 50years ago.
In before all the gtsfags/Vorefags/insertionfags
American Dad literally did this whole movie in one episode.  It ended with ants of course, and Roger flooding tiny town with a tiny dam.\n\nDam you to hell you dike!
Cringey music. Cringey story. Cringey actors. Cringey comments. Welp, Matt Damon is officially on my ignore list.
this looks like so much funsounds like an actual real world solution too
When you spot that danish acting at the beginning
This is cool stuff . Cant wait anymore....
I'm was waiting to see someone get step on and die. Still waiting for it.
And the giants rule the world once more
I really hope this trailer is a bait and switch. This whole film is being presented as an almost sickly sweet utopia that will overlook the actual problems the film touches upon.
only Hollywood can attempt to execute such subjects.. 👏👍
waiting till you are the last big 'one' .. KING of the world !!!.. just sex will be a disappointment.. =p
WOW! As a youngster in the 60's I was fascinated by the city in a bottle from Superman comics. It was Kandor --the capital of Krypton-- that was shrunk before the demise of Krypton (Superman's home planet, of course). Brainiac stole the city of 6 million, but Superman got it back and kept it in his Fortress of Solitude... This movie is going to be BIG! WOW!
It looks interesting but I'm wondering what the ending will be like
What about insects?? That things gonna be huge when you got small!
It's a small world after all.
Was that Desna from claws??
Go to google and simply type: *gexxguides* You'll get the only working clash of clans 100% working secret by 2017
I mean.. what could possibly go wrong right?
NPH
Actually really excited about this, can't beat a world builder movie!
I would crawl into someone's vagina then once i have had fun i would get some realsize weed
This is gonna make microphiles and macrophiles very happy
una pelicula que esta a un hormiguero de trasformar una comedia en una pelicula gore
This just looks dumb.
hmmm weird
Nope
Looks amazing
0:11 DENMARK/DANISH GUY ( Søren ( His name )
Damn wtf this looks fuking amazing
Spoiler:\n\n\n\n\n\nKristen Wiig die
No pets? No thanks.
Double toasted brought me here
Looks pretty interesting.
Søren Pilmark... wtf!!!
must see
🙄
Honey! I shrunk Matt Damon!
Looks dumb
脅威となるものがいない
0:10 Søren Pilmark from Denmark.
Yeah fuck that...I don't want giant spiders...
wau..
Jesus Christ ..
اللي جاي من فيلم جامد ؟؟؟
Give me brain cancer before you turn me into some shrinky-dink project where 99% of the worlds organisms can make me their bitch...
I can't tell if this is a light-hearted sci fi comedy... or a sci fi horror film we're being lulled into a false sense of security about. I was waiting for there to be something wrong with down-sizing.
another solution might be habituating hearth water and sea.

does anyone know who brian is??
This true. Watching stuff on my phone to calm down the anxiety caused by waking up for work, forcing myself for a major work that i need to complete, before making  stressful decisions etc. And afterwards, when i get home, i eat to feel the comfort again. Only a thought self therapy can help to reevaluate things and assure myself that these things that cause stress are just everyday tasks like getting dressed.
I don't own a smart phone. I do have a desktop PC through which I access the Internet, though. One of the old, big tower kind. It's distraction enough. :)
No I strongly dislike my phone. I'm paranoid that I might lose it or that it will die because people expect that if they send me a message, that I have been made aware of it's contents.
I try to forget my phone at home once in a while. Very nice message.
because our phones, we can watch videos that tell us to stop using our phones...
Social media is a damn joke.
omg i could listen to him talking about anything and still be interesting
The irony of watching this on a smartphone xD
i am guilty, but at least i was smart enough to realize it rather that denying it.
They're also slowly giving us tumours
Like the idea behind the video, but some premise is worrisome: Yes, we can and must compare the brilliance of our phone with the past. Why? Because our phones are not just devices of despair as some citizen of some first world country would think. They're also the opportunity for most of humanity to catch up, to have access to almost every knowledge of the world, to educate and be better people. It's also gives you the possibility to communicate and not just posting selfies in snapchat, it also gives you the possibility to call your grandma or just to be in touch with people you may not see at any time, because you're poor and you live far.\n\nOf course, there are downsides, but we need to adress them as failure to solve in our long, and continuos (at least for some centuries) technological progress.
The visuals made it unpleasant to watch.
Ha I thought this video was gonna be about like if there was something wrong with phones physically not like this leave a like if you did too😂\n\nAlso sub please I'm trying to win a bet where you get the most subs without making videos I'm doing the bet with my brother but if you don't want to that's totally fine
Ok, now that you unveiled our problem what is your solution? Or idea for improvement?
I should've seen this vid two days ago so I didn't bring my phone to school that day & maybe it could've been saved from school confiscation damnit how can I survive a month without a phone...\np.s. im using my laptop but its not the sameee
The momentary mock that the comment section is filled with who's watching on the phone? I'm watching on my laptop/PC/tablet etc take away the intention of such an awakening video.
what's that Latin quote about Dust.
Did he mention that they are spying devices for intelligence agencies?  They can hear through the mic and view through the video screens at any time, even when your phone is turned off.  Don't be naive.
This is an asmr voice if I ever heard one
What do I do when I am sad?I watch a youtube video...on my phone.
Start from unsubscribe and stop watching YouTube
Wow! That video was pretty intense! The addiction to phones is definitely self-avoidence for most people... \nMakes me want to go back to 3310 again! :)
I use my phone to watch your vids,which help my self exploration,then contemplate what I learn.\n\nPs. Keep the good work up
Amazing clip. Reminds me of the movie Fight Club what you own ends up owning you.
The funny thing is, my phone has a bed time. By 10pm its away from me! I dont usually sleep till 11pm so for 1 hour I am just in bed being tortured by my own thoughts. The best thing is, I realize what and needs to be done.
Wow. So damn true. May god help us
it look like i am the only person who don't really care about his phone, \nbecause it has no chance to receive any call/message :'(
Ha ha ha I got an add for the Samsung galaxy S just before that
I gave up my phone for 8 hours....When I'm asleep..
If you were a loser without a phone you will be a loser with one.
The irony when i'm watching this on my phone
This may be true for some people but you can not fit this on everyone as you do in this video.
These arent even real phone problems. Ive got a cracked screen. Thats more of an issue than all of this rubbish. My mum cant hear when a text comes through. Thats another real phone problem. This stuff is all just made up waffle. Bet the person who made this video has never had a cracked screen.
Could you an episode on What is Bohemianizm pls...
I don't even know where my phone is right now. Most days, it's like this; sometimes I even forget to grab it before I leave the house. It's not a smartphone, nor a dumbphone; it has some of the capabilities of a smartphone, but it's so slow and old that I don't even have the patience to try using them much. I hardly get notifications because the thing can only hold like two apps. If you don't use a smartphone, the sorts of problems mentioned in the video aren't really there anymore. Just my two cents.
Ive ditched my Phone for that reason. I didnt Connect to myself anymore cause i didnt have time alone
La weá black mirror\n
I might write a paper on how advocating for mental health is generally linked with media pessimism. I know it might sound redundant to hear this, but humans are complex and the way they use their phones can be both destructive AND benefitial to their health, but for different reasons.
Meanwhile in the real world,the populace is enchanted by the latest iPhone X
Even this video is being watched on the phone by millions
I watched this on my iPhone.
Television .... newspapers.... knowledge.... humans have a constant desire for it.  There ya go! Have a nice day !
I'm in Florida and just had hurricane Irma pass over us. I been without internet for about 4 to 5 days and it has been of my worst days in many recent years. I've come to realize how much I'm attached to this device.
I think you have something of a point here, but it doesn't apply universally. I sit with my thoughts alone all the time and yet I also use my phone a lot. I'm constantly self-reflecting and this isn't impaired by my phone usage.
This is why i don't use a smartphone ...
We deserve pity for having been born in such primitive times...
Our phones and immediate connection to all those around us have revolutionized our culture. Granted, this myopic generalized self commentary on how you perceive people is well done and calming but it's redundant and ironic. The fact that I can stay connected to everyone I know albeit through a device is extremely comforting. Of course we're isolated in our worlds, that's always been the case, but imagine how isolating it would be if you couldn't contact someone when you needed to?  \nKeep making videos guys!
The people's heads look like golf clubs. I don't like that.
Right on time of the X.
When you look back in your life and remember the happiest moments, do they all have something in common? I thought that probably for most of us,  those were the moments where we felt totally absorbed in something we loved to do, to a point where we forgot about time and about ourselves and everything around ..Like when you get lost in a book, in a piece of music you play or when you feel one with the nature. Or when you get into a deep conversation with a friend, watch a great movie or  a concert...  You get into a kind of flow. \n\nI don't have a smart phone, because I thought it would constantly bring me back to the surface.  And surface is absolutely the place where you suffer the most! Imagine all the situations I described above: A phone that makes strange noises at any unexpected moment would ruin it all. \n\nWell I don't mean to offend anyone, this is just a personal thing and I confess that I have a total  obsession with silence and my phone is turned off 99 percent of the time. \n\nBut here is a quote by Nietzsche that is worth keeping ALWAYS  in mind: \n\nThe greatest events  of our lives - they are not our loudest but our stillest hours”\n\n Imagine that you have your favourite cake in front of you. But if you get lost in some thoughts while eating it, you may suddenly realise that the cake is gone!  You just ate it without even noticing it! ( It happened to me more than once with all sorts of muffins! :- ) \n\n If we spend our counted days on earth with constant distraction, in the end,  we may feel this way about our lives  ... We won't know where it  has gone...\n\nAs T. S. Eliot said: \n\nWe get  distracted from distraction by distraction. \n\nThat's the greatest danger.\n\nI don't mean to sound too dark though. Of course you can have the latest smart phone, in case you REALLY need it, and if you know exactly what you want from it, you can use it properly.\n\nFor friends who want to think more on this issue here is a little list: \n\n1. There is a TED Talk by Adam Alter called: \n\n Why our screens make us less happy. \n\n He is a psychologist and professor at NYU and he says that he himself was \naddicted to his phone and to gaming. Imagine! :- ) That motivated him to write the following book: \n\n Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and The Business of \nKeeping Us Hooked. \n\n2. There is a very interesting  Note to Self podcast episode called: \n\n What is our attention actually worth \n\nIt can be helpful if you want to re-think your relationship with your phone. \n\n3. There is a TED Talk by the  ethical design thinker Tristan Harris called: \n\nHow better tech could protect us from distraction\n\n4.  I haven't read this one but Shery Turkle from MIT has a book on the issue called:\n\n Alone Together, Why we expect more from Techonology and Less From Each Other. \n\nYou can also watch her TED talk:\n\n Connected, but alone ?\n\nThanks for this wonderful lesson and for the amazing animation!
My phone broke for about three days recently and it was bliss without it, I was actually a little sad when my Dad fixed it for me
FINALLY: please, listen what a philosopher said to us!!!!! NOW
0:40 That's what I do.

Everything has their own negative sides, even love. But its not their fault that they have those things, its your fault for not thinking outside of the box.
I've never owned a smartphone and I regularly abandon my dumbphone for weeks when I don't need it at work
Finaly you stoped talking about love and relationships, i was tired of those topics.....sorry for my awful English.
This was a beautiful video. Honestly, the animations and the writing are both brilliant in their own ways. I feel like the animator and writer/speaker are two (or three!) different people, because there is a different voice to each of them. Does that make sense?
The Phone and new tech destroyed my generation
I like the example this video sets for us. Because it is not the object which is the villain nor the hero, but it is rather a constant reminder that our life is full of choices that we should always reflect on to determine how much to invest in something for there will be either a return or a loss for all of our investments. It is not recommended that we just go with the flow, for then how would we know if we are going in the right direction in the first place if we had only reflected on what was to come of it all.
This is actually very true.\nI use my smartphone constantly, when alone, avoiding my own thoughts. Perhaps missing out on moments of enlightening reflection and creative thoughts.
i love how people need to blame something for their inherent shortcomings. its not the phones fault you do stupid things, its your fault for being controlled by it. seems like people who blame guns for killing people instead of blaming people for killing people were the brains behind the concept of this video.
a hundred years from now they will say how asinine
Im not addicted to games, i just want to forget about the painful past
Used my phone to watch this video for entertainment at work
Im not that enchanted by smartphones, it's a luxury of a minority who thinks they are the majority, like internet users.
If you're going to argue that phones are bad, at least provide cited facts rather than observations and anecdotes. There's no shortage of studies observing negative consequences of cell phones (difficulty sleeping, attention, etc). But the way this video presents the argument, it just comes across as pompous. If YouTube were around 150 years ago you would be making a video on how the radio distracts us from our own death. 300 years ago, the newspaper, etc.
truly amazing content!!  keep up the good work.  such a good reminder of what really matters.
Nice story, far from reality.
Even the comments are foolish for such an amazing video. Idiots
I don't personally feel addicted to my phone and will happily walk home on an evening and just enjoy the scenery and my own thoughts, HOWEVER, when I think about something I admit that I DO whip my phone out and look up the questions I'm thinking about.
415 people are unable to accept the truth of their reality.
You're pathetic if u can't go a few days w/o a phone
I don't use my phone to run away from myself, I use it so I don't have to interact with others lol
Very nice message & some awesome animation & narration to go a long with it. Yeah this is a topic I think about a lot. In fact I made a little satire series called Strange Stories to kind of poke fun at how we function with all this advanced technology now.
Thumbs up If you're going to watch porn now
Deep philosophy. I love how this video gives people the perspective they need
It is all a matter of how we deal with our phones. We should choose to check our phones and not feel compelled to do it.

Came here to hate on it but I can't. Sounds really good.
Great music and great singer as well.
I can't believe how hard this guy works in his performances and how seriously he takes his songs and how much he loves music, it's so near to perfection. I usually skip every video even the bands i really like, but it's like the 15th or 20th time i watch this incredible performance. I'ts absolutely rad, love the vibe, the musicians are so stoked about what they're playing, love everything. Thanks mr Styles.
Guitar out of tune a touch
Another great piece - well done, Harry.

he is so hot & sexy without trying
nah ... the original was already crap no need to make it more
I fuckin love Fleetwood Mac and Harry Styles this is insane
Limitless talent with this one! This guy could sing the phone book and have a hit\n\nThis is one kickass band and love the look on his face at the end. He was so accomplished looking
God such FUCKING TALENT I can't even fathom it anymore
when a one directioner plays a song you hate I hope keep this kind of rock and role up
i love him so much
This is fucking amazing. Sorry Florence + Machine. R.I.P Mitch's hair & where is Alex? 😢
I'm stuck between him and Zayn over who had the best vocals in 1D
Guardians of the galaxy vol.2 XD...
He looks alittle nervous to start,than he does a totally AWESOME job!! Great song to cover!
Fuck, Harry what are you doing to me
TÁ M A R A V I L H O S O
Seems like they should be a couple full steps down for his range but still a good cover. lead guitar work pretty meh.
He is so incredibly talented. Oml. I love him so much ❤❤
Oh my goodness 😭😭 I love you so much Harry Edwards Styles❤❤❤😻😻😻👌👌 you are just... ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AND BEAUTIFUL ! 😍😍😍 #hazzaforever
Their voices have the perfect range for this song.
I liked the video before even watching it
I just got an ad for dusk til dawn im not ok
This was a pretty good cover!
Did anyone ever in Love with clap? \nHmm I Just did 😂\nLook at How Harry claping I'm in Love ...Always slay it babe.x
I mean can we talk about how sick everyone in his band is! Like... damn. Drums, bass, guitar, piano, backup vocals. Everything's perfect 💯
I love the shape of Harry's mouth when he says, shadows at 3:27!
Two of my favorite things. The Rumours album and Harry Styles
i love this cover so much oh my god how many times will i rewatch this
He makes younger generations like rock music...including me lol
And Harry's band, darn! Guys are smashing!
Somebody was asking what shirt Harry is wearing.  A fan tracked it down. It's a vintage shirt - a Vivienne Westwood star print shirt.
He actually sounds close to Lindsey Buckingham, I like Harry better out of 1D.
Bass line at 2:45 is why we are here. Well done, thank you, and good night.
now i'm bald
OMG he is amazing I love his type of voice it's pleasant to the ear❤❤
can we all take a moment to appreciate fleetwood mac
I don't think there is a song that he couldn't rock.
I'm in love, bye
Y'all now that I noticed it. Do y'all see those sold men in the background losing their shit during the climax of this cover. That is evidence my friends that they like it. 😭😂
i think stevie would very much approve
The Chain is my favourite song ever, I'm not really a fan of Harry but with this cover he did a reeeally good job!
pure talented man！！  goosebumps
❤
😍😍😍

He literally looks like he needs to shit here
im in fucking love with this holy shit
THE CLAPPING
Drums are absolute pleasure !
glad harry is reviving 60s-70s era rock
this is probably the most viewed video of this channel
Me before: fuck harry styles you better mess up my favorite song \nMe now: huh he's pretty good
So impressed
FUCKKKKK
Goosebumps...this is so bautiful
WOW, JUST WOW!!!👏👏👏
Changed my life

hot drummer!
Really nice
This is incredible.
That was fucking awesome.
GOTG2
I had never listened to him ever before and I have to say I was surprised by his deep and good voice!
harry styles is 40 not 23 he's too old school rock for me sorry just my opinion he's got an old soul something I'm just not feeling for his age. l like Liam and niall music best 🙄
He's ruined the song.
this is my favorite song ever. his voice is so good. but not enough emotions as original song. :/
his band is so cool. he should totally call himself harry styles and the (insert band name here) to at least acknowledge them because whew that drummer is on fire
This dude is getting quite impressive! I'm happy he's branched out of easy pop to showcase his true style and talent. And the musicians are just killing it!!!! What's the name of the drummer?
has anybody here even heard the original song before he covered it lol
Original is better.
Watch the 1997 performance of this to see how hollow this performance is. No soul.
OMFG I CAN'T EVEN EXPRESS HOW HAPPY I AM THAT HE COVERED FLEETWOOD MAC !!! WE ARE SOULMATES!
Kill yourself. Adam Gontier's cover was so much better.
Fair play, easiest cover anyone couldnt sound shit on but good on him 😊😊😊😊😚😚
THIS GUY HAS A BONER FOR ADAM GONTIER. NAMES SIGN OF THE TIMES AFTER A 3DG SONG AND NOW COVERS A SONG 3DG ALSO COVERED
Enjoyed this much more than the interview from way back. Dude seemed to be more into it.
I subbed to this channel solely for Sean Evans. Dude is able to hang with even the weirdest cats on these shows and come out without it being awkward. And it seems like a lot of the dudes he cooks with, even pretty blunt dudes like Action or Matty seem to really respect him. Props to Sean!
I don't even know where the fuck to get the cheese
I love this trio!
How do you spell that cheese.. i need that in my life. sorry like i got everything else.. maybe i am just a little to blazed.
It's not challah bread. It's just challah. With salami and mayo???!!!! Goyim. Not a clue.
Sean has manage to get into that very small group of people, that are energetic and action actually likes.
Action is a great guy
that is great entertainment.
The way he presented his decision at the end was nice,Bronson thought he was beat
I love how AB acts around some of these big name chefs, you can tell he really looked up to them.
I'M DOIN SO GOOD
Wtf he has a bunch of bomb ingredients...uses plain white bread -_-
Damn Bronson actually made a real sandwitch instead of last time when he made that nasty ass shit.
Both made by Bronson. Wins either way.
Dem cross sections tho...
9:21-9:26 My ni#ga
I am HUNGRY!
Primanti Brother them all!
Bronson lookin thin good on em
sean with the emerald timex tho
yo im frum new yowak
Action Bronson & DJ Khaled competing in the most over rated migraine inducing Olympics. Remind me of the kids in high school that would wear two different outfits all year with matching hats and didn't bathe regularly. Rant over.
action is my dude. get ripped and make love. i work part time at a market and my family always get to enjoy the new stuff we get before everyone in town even knows it exists and then i can refer things to people everyday so they can expand their horizons and give tips and techniques that can help them make unbelievable cuisine they never thought they could do.
That foam is not bread. You would have made some of the most amazing sandwiches if it weren't for that shitty excuse of a bread.
 the blue berries remind me of my child hood  MEMBER BERRIES
How Action would describe a shower to this Therpist-\n\n Therpist : Explain what happened? \n\nAction :The sun , when hottest in the day only after I had a scrumptious cup of herbal tea grounded by a hundred men. I felt the tears of an angel form on my fucking silky smooth skin, the knobs I turn to the perfect temperature, the water dances on the skin like a baby girl getting powered by her beautiful mother . Hours go by but time does not ,I could here birds making nest in hundred year old oak trees with a breeze from the mountains where no man has climbed before ..\n\nTherpist : ......
Crazy to hear Bronson knows what Primanti's Bros is
That beat at 6:20 is fire
Action needs to start doing audio books.
The judge ate the fuck out of Action Bronson's sandwich hahaha 8:25
Every time Mario curses it reminds me of when my square bear uncles cut loose and say fuck like it was the first time they had said it that year.
Mario is a SAVAGE !
Wow!  They both looked awesome, and I love that Mario went all in!
So regional and seasonal. The Alice Waters of large rappers that are white!\n😂😂😂\nGotta love Chef Mario Batali
Should of put coleslaw on Sean's.
action's sandwich had my mouth watering till i saw the bread
I haven't put too much effort into lunch recently, that might need to change.  I might pick up a copy of Action's book too.
Need a recurring Sean & Action show pls.
You can see in Action's eyes that he knew he lost lol...I love all three of these dudes tho. Keep doing your thing Sean, you're the best interviewer out there.
I could watch Sean and Action Bronson every week. Mario Batali was a welcomed guest, they all had great chemistry on this episode. More of these 3 in future episodes hopefully.
nobody is in house youre outside you fucking nerd
Amazing. I love that it's not just a showcase of making amazing food, but directs the audience on how to learn to make amazing food in their own kitchens - bravo!
Can't believe what I'm seeing. heart-attack in a bun basically, and when Mario Batalli launches himself into it, it's like seeing the alien dislodge its jaw and suck the life out of its victim.
that cheese in Bronson's made me nut
Bronson ALWAYS over compensates by throwing together fancy ingredients. Action, you're trying too hard!
wow they got Mario on this shit! Daam Sean doing big things in the food world!
We want more action Bronson one of my favorite rappers
The amount of respect in Bronson's voice to Batali is heartwarming and shows his passion for cooking goes beyond doing it for fun.
Mario is like you combines both of them lol
Action Bronson is such a sweetheart.
Those berries and jalapeno on fresh side pork has to be fantastic.
I think this is my favorite YouTube video of all time
action bronson looks like a t h i c c   bearded sean evans
Mario Batali is slowly turning into former Microsoft CEO, Steve Ballmer.
Action kinda seemed like a dick on the last episode he was on with Sean, but looks like they were best buds in this one, good shit. Also, I would devour both of those sandwiches lol
In Pittsburgh or Pixburgh we pronounce it permanees... I'll let yinz pass n at
I didn't even like ab before this show. I'm coming around.
had a great time watching, thank you.
Mario Batali looks like if Sean and Action had a baby
Wow i learned lots from mario its nice to see him getting some street credit.
I would love to see Mario Batali on Hot Ones
Holy fuck, those are the types of fries I fuck with, look at that sexy ass salt just hugging the fuck outta it! I'll eat that sandwich, well both of them in one sitting!
Jesus christ sean is so fucking smooth
F*ck that's delicious. I've had that shit on pre-order since I knew it was coming out. Sits on my shelf next to Julia Child, Kent Rollins.
I feel like if he never had that orange beard it wouldn’t make him as unique.
to everyone who called action an arrogant dick when he did the hot ones spicy wing challenge... where y'all at now
I hope action bronson dies from being hit by a meteor.. a bus wouldn't do it
Much love for the channel guys. Ive said it before i'll say it again. Hot Ones is the best, but Sean in the wild is a close 2nd ---- Plus I think its a secret way to get Sean out of his element, also know as weening him out of his hoodies!
BamBam didn't put the jalapeños in the sauce, y'all. That's why they put in the 'ends'. Still, though, I'd have picked his hands down. Yum!
Damn Mario Batali just made me think of a naked Action Bronson, why tf did he have to say that I was enjoying the sandwich eating
The best part is when action has a heart attack and dies.
I like my sandwiches how I like my women thick and juicy
When action bronson blew dab smoke in his face 😂
Tbh I love the idea of only toasting the inside of the bread, it would be softer on the soft tissue in your mouth, my gums and palate, but you'd still get that crunch
Warning!!! Only watch this when you're full. Don't do the same mistake I did by watching this when you're starving😭😭
Sean looks like Dana White's little brother
*PRIMANTI'S style. Someone loves PGH <3
Fuck you Epilepsy, fuck you Ketogenic diet! Fuck that looks delicious!
Mario lowkey gay
I enjoy watching action Bronson cooking 😂
Chicharon. Damn, that's Dominican
Action Bronson is beyond morbidly obese, he looks like a redhead DJ Khaled, another clogged idiot.
Ew
Viva Colombia y viva el chicharrón! Aguante Action Bronson papaa!
What a COLLAB

Hes the shit
Love action Bronson...love his viceland show
My nigga got small
damn action got phat stacks!
How could you not fuck with action Bronson he'll smoke you out and cook a bomb ass meal!!!! IT DONT GET MORE 🔥 THAN THAT!!!
Enzo amore took it far he is so annoying!!!
I don't care if Enzo loss he still got the say what he wanted so to me and enzo one that match
WWE gets ridiculous with superstars backstage sometimes. What's up with all of this heat on so many wrestlers? And what's with that joke Enzo said about Maryse's child?
Wait cruiserweight division is 205 and less right?\nHow come finn is on raw when he is less than 200lbs
HES NOT DOIN TOO GOOD
Why Anzo wins this match??? Miz is better
job without investment.need active member . anyone interested drop me a text on my whatsapp=01623552051
I went here
The question who's your daddy is the right question u know😂😂😂😂
This reminds of when the elite was  talking on the Mic during the match
run enzo if u can 😂😂
Gotta admit Enzo has mic skills;I'm not surprise if he became a future Announcer/Commentator
The Miz is getting old and boring.
2:20 what did the crowd chant
So This Is What Happens When U Have Backstage Heat Good To Know
NEW STORYLINE: THE DAD OF THE CHILD IS ACTUALLY ENZO!
He's not doing to good - Random Guy
only vincemcmahon can tell us..... who is ur daddy?? lol...
The running commentary in that match had me about to BOL!
Who's your daddy 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅 Roll over the floor laughing
Enzo sells like he's dead
Question you need to be asking that baby who's your daddy 😂😂😂😂
Miz acting like DJ Khaled at one point
wow dis is the first time i likke the miz #awesome
Make Enzo as the manager of Shinsuke Nakamura....\nBoth can make a lot of money together!
Knowing WWE,Maryse gonna be revealed to be the surrogate mother of the lovechild of Bo Dallas and Stephanie McMahon.😂
WHO'S YOUR DADDY?!
The face of Maryse in the final is like, Enzo is right, Miz is not the Daddy
Hope the story doesn't turn out to be like the one with Kane,  lita and snitcky or how ever you say that guy's name
Enzo is good on the mic but can't hold a candle to The Miz.
Miz is one of the most entertaining wrestlers out there, I swear
3:07 look at the ref trying to count but realized it was a DQ
You know the roast is real when your own wife laughs at you
The miztourage has nothing to do with it wth
Wrestling and trash talking at the same time?\nThis was seriously interesting which to see more of it, something like a trash talk/wrestling match would be awesome.
Welcome to the no pressure zone
I actually freakin like the idea of letting wrestlers do the talking right during the match. Do it more, WWE.
I call this one talk trash match.
1:13 \nThe miz: hey Enzo how you doin\nRandom guy ( I think grim): he is not doing that good
I never liked enzo... really he is james elseworth in raw... I agree with cory graves
Ladies and Gentlemen your winners by Disqualification Enzo Amore
I think horn swoggle might be the daddy (:
Who's your daddy shirts will be coming soon
the question you should of be asking is how you doing the question you should be asking that baby is who's your daddy
*Who's* *Your* *Daddy*
1:10 how you doin! He's not doin too good😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm crying
Dude, I can already tell, Enzo's Charisma is going to change the WWE. No matter what the WWE do, if the WWE doesn't understand the potential character Enzo brings to the WWE universe, and get like minded guys like him, dishing it out in all weight classes, the WWE is going to stay stagnant forever, and eventually boring. Enzo in my opinion is the leader in recreating the next gen. Attitude era.
1:53 were they actually fighting 😲😰
Did Enzo just beat the IC champion?
This is ridiculous , why is Enzo getting so much air time on the main roster when he is already on 205 Live and he's the least talented overall there ? Seriously it just makes the roster look bad
Yo the Miz is so week in some of them
How come enzo can fight the main roster but not aries
Enzo is all talk he couldn't hit a egg 😂😂
Enzo is on a win streak
I thought enzo was in the cruiserweights
wow miz u dam sure couldn't do that to the others without help
1:56 if this doesn't win a slammy, I don't know what to say
I know this was scripted but it was real. Look how fast Miz got up after Enzo asked, Who's your daddy?. Enzo was buried alive by Miz. Both in the promo and in the match.
What kind of match is this
Who's your daddy
The Miz is love.... The Miz is life
You know, i really like the Miz as a heel but now for some weird reason I want him to become a face. Even though he is an awesome heel.
Hey Enzo you don't look like a human who's your mommy
The miz and enzo should have an promo match
miz the man
oat
Who's your daaaadddyyyy

Miz's worst combacks 2017compilation
omygawd, it's like Phil pulled a Benedict Cumberbatch from Sherlock ^~^ The speed he talks, his thinking look, the complex and quick analysis of the little details and knowing what she did...like Sherlock with his clients... \nAnd this:\n---Sherlock---\nCumberbatch: *thinking* Everybody shut up! ... I'm trying to think. Anderson, face the other way, you're putting me off. *thinking* \n---What Do You Want to Eat?!---\nPhil: *thinking* Not now Steve! *thinking*\nAnyone see the resemblance a bit?
Poor Chris 😢 lol  this video is accurate AF.  Wongfu 4lyfe!!!
Just go to a buffet...
Simple. You buy a shit ton of groceries and have her cook her own shit. XD
That was pretty funny , thanks.
How come there are only 2 fortune cookies? Shouldn't Joanna have 2 unless Phil doesn't want any cookies
That weird moment when you notice that the iPhone's lock screen says September 13 and the video was uploaded September 12.
Dinner is serious business like y'all don't even know.
Ryan higa video in a different form
I almost thought I was watching a nigahiga video😂
Is this like nigahiga's videos where he has these crazy ideas and at the end his answers don't even make sense?
I'm always like Phil (in this vid). If I have to think very deep, I always scream 'Not now blabla' (I should use the name Steve next time. Everyone would be so surprised :D)
Choosing a place to eat: Level Asian\n\nXD lol
i can so relateee! i'm totally the guy lol
Now I want honey walnut shrimp so bad!!!!
Who else knows the answer to the Hamburger question? Hehhehe
Why does this remind me so much of nigahiga🤔
omg i thought victoria justice was in this video becuase of the thumbnail but it's definitely not her😂
Poor Steve got rejected...*TWICE*\nDiscrimination I say
lol true story you could do something I saw an instagram where I guy put the names of restaurants on a see n say kids toy so that they wouldn't have to decide where to eat lol
Special Offer: Free Iphone. Claim & Win 100 % free iPhone 7. To successfully enroll and receive a FREE iphone go to the google search and type: *givefonesaway*
he knows her better than she knows herself
That creative and funny! I was, also, impressed by how many lines Philip had to memorize!
She can eat me.
they shouldve hired ryan higa to play the main character this is so something he would do
You know how bad my memory is
Do people actually think this is funny?
What's with these Asian women dating white men? Disgusting
Omg I really love the style of this Video! It's so different from your other productions! 😍 it's awesome to see you guys improve even after ten years! ( also picking the right food in japan is very easy, it's always good!! - No struggle here for me :D)
I want PE but it's midnight 😭😭😭😭😤😤
Not now Steve\nIt's Chris \n\nPoor thing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is like if Sherlock had to decide where to eat.
lmao Loved this! Very reminiscent of Ryan Higa's style of videos. Also, poor Steve!
FML. WHY DID I CLICK THIS VIDEO. I HAVEN'T HAD PANDA EXPRESS SINCE AUGUST 5. WongFu, bring that orange chicken here at the Philippines!!!!
I like your new hairstyle.
I didn'tt even realize that this was sponsored until the very end. GGWP Wongfu, ggwp
this guy knows his girl so much hahaha. lovin it 💗
An egg carton on top of more egg cartons.. maybe there were eggs in one of those :p\nIt's something to think about haha
This style of editing reminds me so much of Scott Pilgrim. And Edgar Wright in general
makes me miss Micheal from @tasted's Why Would You Eat That? food rants
Did anyone else cringe when he started walking towards her at 1:23? Cliche and a bit cringy
Wong Fu, Joanna, Chris, or should I say everything a video needs to be purrfect
Literally the ONLY thing me and my girlfriend argue about lmao
You're being so rude to Steve!\n\n\n\nI mean Chris. 😂😂😂
Someone's been watching Sherlock
It was a good video but it seemed a little long.
don't think honey walnut is Asian cooking...
My favorite part was Natalie Tran's voice being used for the nature documentary
It's so difficult to decide what to eat because we bend over backwards for our significant others, treat them as if they were the only person on the planet. Because we are spoiled and gluttonous narcissistic, instant-gratification seeking bastards that don't think it's cool to have a decent home cooked meal anymore. Because we have lost our ability to understand that life isn't about food and instant satisfaction. Because we can't sit at table anymore without some anti-social device, taking pictures for nobodies and looking at pics and reviews from people we never even met. We have quite simply become a miserable, loathing society trying to find the juice from the corner dumpsters in the dark alleyways of our empty souls.
Bs! 12 years and counting with my gf and she is still undecided were to eat, always! I'll give her a week in advance, still undecided!
Oh, God.\nI seriously wanna slap his face at 6:41.\nI'm starving already, SHUT UP!!\n😂😂😂😂😂😂
Darn, now I want Chinese food. 😓
This gave me stress for her
Use the 5-2-1 technique: You pick 5 places, of those, she picks 2 and you pick one of the 2 she picked.
poor steve all he wanted to do was talk
Make your favorite dinner, dish, and Google it or check with YouTube.\nUse what you have to make what you can make.\nI would, to show what I can do with leftovers.
Because in America you can eat everything from every country. Here where i live you can eat potatoes every day
never lnew ricegum had a second channel
Happen to me all the time these past months. Well, can't blame him since he just recently moved to my town and don't familiar with any place yet hahaha
why does this remind me of NigaHiga? omg this is like Ryan Higa's conspiracy videos, did anyone notice? is it just me, or -  \nFUCK'S SAKE, OF COURSE IT'S SIMILAR. it's called creative influence. they know nigahiga, they've watched his videos jfc
This reminded me so much of Ryan Higa's conspiracy theories :D
Isn't this like niga higa
Longest Panda Express commercial ever.
this gives off nigahiga vibes
Wong fu + Panda Express? Genius brand integration!
Some Ryan Higa stuff
Basically Ryan Higa without the puns XD
Like an old nigahiga video
i'm getting ryan higa vibes
Awww, Steve ):
Pandex ed basically >.< getting my crave now!
Omg get her the freakin food

JOANNA! Forever the best Emma Woodhouse <3
Steve/Chris needs a hug.
that was really enjoyable
Loed it
Copying nigahiga i see
pandas r not soft
Imagine if this was in Malaysia 😝😝😝
Could have and should have been at least 4-0 UTB!!
Give us the league title now
Lunstram should have scored but all in all UTB
Come on you blades !!!
1:38 Next free kick on the edge of the box might go under the wall. Look out lads.
Hey Bruce Arena you watching?
Blades to get 8th imo
Playing well. Should definitely avoid relegation.
Goal at 0:54
@GalaxyMatcha I agree to disagree! It is luck... There are a lot of people skilled enough to be in front of a camera but have other responsibilities or haven't gotten the exposure! I'm sure it is hard work but any job has hardships! YouTube jobs I'm sure can take up a lot of hours but in no way do you work longer/ harder hours than traditional jobs! I am not bashing her but like any job you can't take off because you are feeling uninspired! Sorry!
COME TO SF <3
👌👏😘❤😘❤
Don't worry. Everyone needs a break.
Love you Estée! I love this idea of rebranding yourself! Straying away from beauty and talking about things that are happening in the world is very important. \n\nI love SF! If you end up going, you have to go to the Palace of Fine Arts. You will leave in awe.
Big changes? Celebration dinner... are you engaged my dear?
I've missed you Estee! You're a little ray of sunshine on YT and I've gone my entire 20s watching your videos. Very excited to see what's up your sleeve, I'm not much into the makeup anyways.
The mind really needs to wander.
If you haven't been, Tayyabs in Whitechapel. Awesome Punjabi food, the lamb chops are SO good!
Love that your back in action, missed your videos but happy for you that you had a break. If you come to SF, I really hope you do a meet up, because I have been watching your videos for years now and would absolutely love to meet you! ❤️
Go fuck yourselves!
sweet sweater, cozy surroundings & pretty Estée!! :)
forever loving you💕💕💕
You didint you uploaded this.
<3
Uninspired? Your monthly fav videos are bombzzzzzzz pls dont stop!
lazy cunt bag
I love you Estee  Lalonde
Cuba is amazing. I'd recommend going asap before the US fuck it all up. LOL
Is it just me, or is she pregnant?
I kind of understand, that a few people do not like that she said Africa when being asked what country she wants to visit. But on the other hand, how many (mostly americans) just say all the time they just want to visit Europe. I do not feel hurt by that, Europe aswell is a place with a lot of different countries and cultures! I guess that is just what you say sometimes and that is totally okay ;)
I so miss your makeup videos. I loved when you were a beauty Youtuber and sometimes still passes by this channel just to see if there should be a very rare makeup related video. I know you were never really doing hauls and tutorials and that sort of thing but once in a blue moon when you did do a rare haul, that was amazing.
そだよね、7年位続けてきたもん休憩は必要さ！おしゃれですきよ
love it!
I didnt even notice you stopped uploading!
Wow! no one fucking cares.
SAME OMG UGH. ;____; supporting you <3
Looks like Alissa violet
Good to have you back!
Shes stressed out how does a normal person with 9-5 for 40 years is suppose to be not stressed.
any small YouTubers want to be friends ?❤️❤️
Definitely don't miss you
I love you so much hahaha
i've been following you for quiteee a while now, probably almost 4 years now, but i've got to say, i wasn't keen when you said you were doing a podcast. i was just thinking .. oh just another youtuber doing a podcast.. but then i listened to it. i was wrong. i freaking LOVED it!!! please please please release another episode, where is it??!!
I have grown up with you!! I have been here since I was 13 when you started at 19...I remember watching your videos and thinking what a nice young lady you seemed like and It was a great as a role model. I'm 21 years old now and am SOOOO happy with the directions you are going. It is such a refreshing and productive place to take your channel. I love the artsy direction you take things!\n You are a icon to me!....a down to earth Icon that I can totally still relate to. I'm not able to watch every week - but I always revisit your channel. Love you!!
Breaks are healthy! It's your channel and you can do with it whatever you want! ♡
I don't care what you post as long as I see plants and Reggie. 😂🐅
I miss when you would sit in your living room and do your empties sitting on the floor. Those were the good ol' days
Come to San Francisco! I've got so many recommendations for you! Such a city with tons to eat + see.
SFFFFFFF Just moved here from NYC six months and will give you all of the recommendations :D
Estée, you should write feat. The Doorbell at the end of every video title 😁
Oohhh im going on a flight to new york..ohhhh my life is in an existential crisis
Lol it was funny when you said maybe you didn't notice because I totally didn't ONLY BECAUSE I watch you and aslan on insta every day 🤣
I'm glad you took that break. You really deserve it💛
Giiiiiirl! Come to SF! We are every country in one place! You and the fam will love it!
Glad that you love the food of my hometown Oaxaca, Love Estée, hope u are good and happy, love from México <3
So sad you didn't make it to BC this summer! When you do end up coming you should do a meet up in Vancouver for all your BC subscribers! :)
I loved the pilot episode of your podcast!
I love you and your videos!!! You are so witty, funny, and kind :-) also FIVE GUYS yessss... sometimes super greasy but yah gotta love it!
Come to San Francisco!!! ❤️❤️❤️
It's so interesting how much your office has evolved since you first started Youtube! Looks awesome now  :)
Estee, I am so happy to you enjoying your break from YouTube. I watch your videos 6~7ish years ago when you still in Canada and later on you moved to UK. Look forward to listening your podcast. BTW, have you ever watched Lanvendaire's video? I got lots of inspirations from her. Recommend
omg Five Guys. Where my heart is forever. ❤️🍔🍟🇺🇸
loved this video, but the audio is not too good :(
I'm in the middle of a little break, too. I just went through a break up and haven't felt up to sitting down with a fake smile on my face.
I support your break because you are not working in the office so that's how you get your holiday!  :) I'm happy you came back I missed you so much
You are such an inspiration and thank you for being so honest!
Who else is hoping we will get to see her with Clair in NY?
i faithfully watched your insta stories so i didn't even notice WHOOPS! but glad you're back!!!!!
Esteé when will we see more Femme Talk videos?? I really appreciated those!
I can't wait for all the upcoming content you'll be sharing, sooo excited to see you back!! 🌿
girl if sam smith can do it you can too. good for you!! excited to hear more about this podcast..
Loved it! Missed seeing your videos on my feed. keep doing what your doing and maybe expanding your videos like you said. i've been watching you for 2 or 3 years and i am now a freshman in high school!
Love your personality estee. You're just being real. The commitments grow. Our focus may changes from time to time. All the best for everything estee!
Estée, come to Brazil! I think you'd love it. Also I'd like do say that you're so adorable. 😄😄😄
Estee, let me know if you guys are coming back to Japan! Would love to give you tips if you need some inspiration. I live in Hokkaido and I've recently started @talesofhokkaido instagram page to share more stories of this hugely underrated northern island in Japan ;)
I still remember your blog with Aslan! Button & Goose??!! :D
YOU DIDN'T MENTION WAGAMAMA'S OMG HAHHAHA YOU WERE SO ADDICTED TO IT BEFORE!
I LOVE FIVE GUYS TOO
Do you watch Ru Paul's Drag Race? I haven't heard you mention it & I'm sure you would LOVE it.
Ahhhhh I'm so excited for everything! Love how we all kind of get to grow up together and see you evolving on this channel. I so enjoyed your political videos with Aslan, what a smart way to use your platform for. Interests really do expand while growing up, so I love how your're also incorporating these topics on your channel. xx
You'd love San Francisco, although the recent gentrification is quickly wiping out some of the heart and soul of the city. I recommend you come visit sooner than later 😉 Oh, and we have the best Japantown! 🍲🍱🎏
I can really notice a different in you estee, you seem more..sombre and serious. Not necessarily in a bad way but obviously you have matured and things are a bit less care free. Love whatever you do :) X
I'm so glad that you are back on youtube!
at 8:40 I legit died from laughing ...a whole series of comical essie <3 love you
The concept of paying the food that you have by its weight is something SUPER common in Brazil!!! :)
I've been watching your videos since I was in high school as well and I'm just about to graduate from university. I really feel like I have grown up with you and I'm excited for whatever videos you are going to upload in the future :)
Great to hear someone knows when to take a break! Sometimes life can be really stressful,and both your body and mind just needs some peace and quiet. In this community there is this filter where everyone gotta seem perfect,but that is just fake. Life isnt like that! Appreciate your honesty Estée :) Glad you are back :D
Why did I want to cry seeing this? Love u so much Button!
I've been watching your videos for years and absolutely adore your channel. Can't wait to see what's coming up 😊
You are hands down the most genuine, down-to-earth and hilarious 'creator' on this damn website so PLEASE just keep doing you xxx
Girl I'm so happy for you that you're a resident of the UK and that u got to take a mental break! Describing it as needing mental space makes perfect sense to me!!
Estee! I love your channel! When you get the chance to go on safari, NomadHill is an awesome outfitter to book your trip through! Beautiful trips and experiences!
5 Guys is all over Canada too AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. It's absolutely worth every calorie.
I'd like to give u a creampie
I love how you use your platform Estee, I don't watch youtube anywhere near as much as I used to but I always make time for your videos because your content is insightful and you're clearly an intelligent and genuine person. I particularly like the new more politically engaged videos you've been creating. Also I love the airtime Reggie receives.
You're just naturally cool in my opinion, that's why I enjoy watching your videos. Besides, I appreciate that you continue to evolve and explore new contents and point of interest.  I'm excited to see what's next!
Hi Estée! I had downloaded your postcad like one month ago and I didn't listen it till now, oh my god! How amazing is to find people that think and use their brains and it's alive inside, sometimes I feel weird and alone for think and use the brain, I just want to say thank you for make us think, feel alive and feel human, thanks for share your thoughts with us and please keep doing it, much love ❤️Maria.
I missed you but it's so important to take a break. Power to you! 💪👊🏽😘
OMG, paying by the weight.....I would get ruined loooooool
I've been a fan of yours since 2012 in your essiebutton days and love how your style has developed and evolved over the years. Feel like I have grown up with you and gained self-acceptance by growing with you and being inspired to let my inner self out so THANK YOU! Watching your videos etc now is like chatting and hanging out with a BFF for a heart to heart chat with a nice cup of tea - wish we were friends IRL. Personally, I loved your old style and your new one so just keep being yourself - you do you girl! :D
Why are you willing to loose your virginity???\nFucking American pussies...😂😂😂
First, so good to see you & second, OMG, SWEATER TWINSIES! We are already like little old ladies who dress alike & need many naps, I love it! \n\nI'm just so proud of you & the choices you are making. Not everyone who is given a platform uses it in a way to positively impact others. Like I've told you before, go with your gut because it knows exactly what to do. You have something special within you Estée! Thank you for always taking the opportunities you have to learn & grow & shed light on important matters.\n\nI've been taking a break too & it has been fucking amazing. The space it has given me to heal & work on things that matter to the core of who I am, it really is priceless. Maybe these things I'm working on will even make me worthy on being on your future incredible, award winning podcast someday... So much love to you guys!
I follow you from the beginning and I absolutely noticed your absence! Glad you're back, but I don't want you to get a burnout, so take your time, I went through a burnout, that's not good, not good. Take care!
money.
You are no longer genuine.  Having watched your videos for years, I find this most disappointing.  Unsubscribing.
I didn't notice that she took a break. It didn't seem that she was really present in videos over the last year.
I've watched Estee since the beginning and I am so happy to see her become successful and have a platform that she can use for good because we definitely need that. But the issue that I find is that Estee comes across as trying to present herself as this down to earth and normal , relatable you-tuber (which is good!) however at the same time she lives in a luxurious flat, in a super expensive city, travels all over, and wears pretty much exclusively only designer things, and PUSHES designer products and goods. I think it would be different if she was also regularly including things that were reasonably priced. \n\nI'm perfectly fine with you-tubers reviewing fancy things, but I think they need to acknowledge that a there will always be a substantial portion of their audience that cannot afford to just go out and buy $35+ dollar lipsticks when there is the same nude shade that a company like Mabelline would sell. It's unreasonable to assume that everyone can just continuously buy $100+ shoes or sunglasses all the time. When you will always have viewers that cannot afford to do that (even if they have a steady job), it marginalizes people even if you don't intend to. \n\nI'm not saying Ugh, Estee's older video's were better, shes changed and that sucks, in fact I think change is great and I still love Estee! All I'm saying is I think there should be a healthy mix of the two especially given how large her audience is and considering that her older videos DID have that balance. And lately it feels like it has been exclusively high end. You-tubers like Estee have the capability to promote a message that while having nice expensive things is great, less expensive things can be just as good and you can make them work for you as well. Idk, that's just my two cents.
Click here to view a video I just uploaded about why I've stopped uploading videos.
I wish I could block you. Annoying scammer you are.
Very excited for Odyssey! And definitely prefer this subtitled version to the American voice-over version of the video; it's nice to have Koizumi-san telling me about his game (nice suit, by the way)
I would say GOTY 2017 but Zelda...
Damn I'm gonna have to get a switch just for this, looks amazing!
2:14 including tropical islands\n\nOh man please be Isle Delfino
Who else clicked on this in 0.00000000001 seconds?
The hype is over 9000!!
It wouldn't really be a 3D Mario game without a gorgeous beach level.
Is there anything this game can't do?😂😂\n\nCan't wait, totally gonna collect everything 100% the 1st time playing this
This game got even better! Thank you Nintendo!
tiara xd
Yeah !
Who else noticed Jeffy's name at 4:04?\nSuperMarioLogan, get on this!
GOTY
Awesome!!!
Ooohhh, so tiara is cappy's sister that makes sense
6:03 nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, eh, Luigi?
Donate and help out by visiting https://handinhand2017.com/
I live in Florida and I had to evacuate, over 6 million people evacuated the roads were insane. I slept two days in my car on an area rest because there was no hotels available, and took shelter in a church. Im trying to vlog all of this but I don't have how to upload it now. Im currently on my way back to Florida, I don't know what to expect. I tried to contact neighbors to see what's going on in my region but had no luck reaching them. Im scared of going back to a completely destroyed home. Not to mention that power is still off for millions of people. If you have a chance please pray for Texas and everyone that was affected by Irma. This is truly a very scary and sad situation.
this seem so fake to me
Diddy ugly ass worth over 500 million and he's out here asking all you broke people to donate what little you have!😂😂😂
Does anyone realise that that room is worth billions? Raising 14 million dollars sound like a joke to me(considering having them all there). And Apple donated 5 mil of it. I know they have a good purpose. I can appreciate that. But that could be much more if these filthy rich people weren't this stingy. I feel bad for the world but today I especially feel bad for those victims. God bless them and protect them.
We're the actors really talking to people or is that more used as a visual representation of people giving to make other people give?
I am sorry but I do not have a red or grey hand so I feel your logo is just not reaching me.
We can do it together and I hope that all this money does good to all the people who need it
justinnnnnn!!!!! i love you, i hope you get a lot of money to help them
Was I the only one who watched vic mensa's ig livestream
i wonder why they don't invite rappers to rap up in that bitch? lol
We all better get right and repent!
White black brown live together all over the United States. Liberal racists just don't like white people. Back fired when we voted trump in
Hurricane Harvey - I Won't Be Afraid By Goldy Locks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgRXYRlQ1is\n:-)  :-)  :-)

you want us to donate money to rich people living in exotic locations who are too stupid to get insurance? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA !  HELL NO !!!

This is sad they asking us for money knowing we struggling helping each other as it is now, they rich they need to give some money, we need all we got.
17:18 : is that David Copperfield in the back seat ? Couldn't he use some of his magic (dollars) to speed\n things up a lilbit?
Figures MTV(masonic television)would use the masters handshake for their symbol.
**CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX. 97% AGREE WITH THAT CONSENSUS**
As of 9/13/17 @6pm EDT, despite being on more than 12 broadcast and cable TV networks and other media outlets on the web - this telethon hosted by 125 multi-millionaires drew only 16 MILLION viewers and pledges/donations of $44 MILLION.  All totals are not in yet.   http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/hand-in-hand-hurricane-telethon-ratings-1202556721/
is this a break from the usual race baiting and division from MTV and now they want to pretend they can do a come together benefit?
NICOLE KIDMAN GIVE MONEY TO THE PEOPLE WE KNOW ANTONY KIDMAN WAS A PEDOPHILE. #PizzagateIsReal 🍕🍕🍕🍕
Could have been a great thing. Unfortunately some ot these idiots had to prove that their ego is bigger than their heart and start the political attacks.  Shame on those that did and for those who were there for the right reason, I commend you.  I personally donated through the fund set up by the 5 former presidents.
So stupid, you assholes drink the globl warming coolade. Ever woulder how the ice got there.
they all can do it themselves. they are all rich right there. why are they asking money from us.  if your going to donate, go yourself over or do it  thru  someone u trust#jesus loves#jesus saves
Was this logo designed by a communist?
Might want to change the 1984 victory logo of the event
Weird, I remember Beyonce's Formation video showing an officer drowning in hurricane Katrina clean up.  She is scum
This is only #21 on trending? It oughtta be #1!!!
I live in Florida born and raised and haven't seen any relief money will we the ppl really be helped??
The sad thing is that it takes something like this for us to help each other. That's the problem.
Fakest people on planet earth under one roof.
What if you physically don't have another hand to give.
Well put together, Aloha from Honolulu Hawaii

beyonce said everything i am thinking ❤️💙👏🏼all my love and prayers are with those hurting
We need you to donate all your money while we get more money from this event than you have in your entire life!\n\nShut up and take my money.
The comment section is frustrating...
I bet they had a really good time and they partied just inflating their egos these celebrity dirtbags
Nice, but you celebs are idiots! If you each give 1m, so much will be done! I'm never buying a ticket to a concert seeing that these celebs can't truly give back after earning so much from us. Just ridiculous!
Ah MTV. When we aren't busy ruining the very fabric of your family by corrupting your kids with immoral values and depravity, we like to all hold hands and take one day out of the year to give back ;)
Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues.
don't donate to them because most of the money goes to making this video ads etc.
Those celebrities were all paid to answer the phones on tv.... from donations. And many were seen joking around. The rich don't care. Ever seen a celebrity actually volunteer .... by doing manual labor for more than a few minutes??
GLOBAL WARNING IS A FRAUD....!!!!!!!    BUT YOU ARE SO NAIVE YOU    BE LIE VE      THEIR LIES....!!!
this event is filled with so many secret transgenders, it's a hoot
The Globe is warming soooooo fast, that our Antarctic ice caps are refreezing at the most rapid pace in recent history! I never knew how such hot temperatures could freeze water so fast!
CAME HERE FOR TORI\nI LOVE U TORI\n\nBTW ISN'T IT IRONIC THE RICHEST CELEBRITIES ARE BEGGING FOR PEOPLE TO DONATE? DON'T THINK THEY DONATED A FRACTION OF WHAT THEY HAVE
Cam den, here is the answer: These Entertainment People have been playing a big role in bringing these disasters upon us, like hurricanes, tornados, floods, fires, and so on. These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites. This is the only message could save you, otherwise you are only going to suffer before our Land Lord Creator evict you from His temporary dwelling.
I like how they talked about Aric playing piano but the video of him playing was muted
why cant all these celebs donate among themselves instead of asking us for dough. Its a joke.... when will the sheeple wake the f___ up....
This would be a beautiful thing if the money actually went to the people who need it. Yes the real America helped each other and showed their compassion, but all of you celebrities are doing nothing more than what you get paid to do, and that is act.
JJ watt collected 31 million real dollars compared to your 14 million fake pledge dollars and he was at ground zero passing out food and water Hollywood calling the working man a racist and a nazi than begs him for money so hmmmm give u greedy fucktards money or jj watt i went with jj i encourage the rest of hard working Americans to do the same

These intense storms were NOT due to Global Warming.\n\n*** They were due to Solar Flares from our Sun. Perfectly normal and healthy. ***\n\nPlease attribute things properly with accurate education \n\nI am profoundly grateful to see so many came together and raise 44+ million. <3 <3 <3
These celebrities don't disappoint, do they? They really know how to make it about them. I've already donated to legitimate relief funds that didn't wait for a televised spot on all 4 major networks.
Four feet of water in my home in Meyerland. These bastards can go to hell! We as Houstonians did just fine without their look at me act like an ass benefit.
Oh wow so much hate in the comments. No wonder America is going to the dogs. I do pray for the victims of Irma and Harvey and I appreciate the work the heroes, celebs and communities are doing to help them. For all those haters out there who think its silly for rich celebs to ask others for money, clearly you don't get how it works. Billions of dollars in damages is what people are facing. You seriously expect the celebs to all empty their accounts. No. They will give what they can: probably a million or two but even more because of who they are they can raise so much more. How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could. So get over the hate, hold someone's hand and help how you can. If you can't do that well God help you.
A disturbing number of people (kids?) commenting here seem to have a massive hard on for these elitist celebrities and have no problem elevating them to near god-like status. I guess should expect as much from your run-of-the-mill MTV audience. I hope that one day many of you will wake up and come to the realization that the elites don't give a shit about you.
They couldve gave themselves as well this is crazy
14:29 too much surgery lool
JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE 😍

Very low views because a sermon from the left bashing the Right
This fund raiser would not have happened if The Donald had not out up a mil. this is not an honest fund raiser its a feel good leftie back rub for their own strike at Trump
19:54 😭
Stealing money!
...IN JESUS NAME, I/WE PRAY, AMEN.
48:22 who is he?!
Hahahaha I don't know which is funnier:\n*The fact that these wealthy celebrities are asking the broke public to donate, the fact that these donations are going to be pocketed or the fact that they're all acting like they're answering calls...*
I like that they used unlikely duos.
Hey MTV, why not show the full clip of Stevie Wonder in the beginning?  Not only his out of place, badly timed ad hominum toward those who might donate, but his insensitive Xian prayer that he sneaked into his speech.
Justin is the cutest❤️
More left-wing propagandists making money off of a disaster.  I have to wonder what percentage will ever make it to the people who need it.  Good Lord, these hateful, left-wing hypocrites make me want to puke.  So full of themselves.
These damn celebrities good give a rat's ass about the common people! They live in their own fantasy world with selfies! Bunch of hypocritical morons that are out of touch with the common people!!
Money  raised by a bunch of liberals, only a fraction of the money will go for helping those in need, the rest will go in their pockets, Please give to another organization, these folks already have to much money,
Dont there just going to take them money and run like the rich always do I am taking them a truck load of fresh water next week help how you can
Selena literally didnt shed one tear

29:06 DAVE Matthews!!!
Red Cross caught throwing away donations https://youtu.be/P1ChQxiltBI
it is so nice to see how everyone joins to help their country no matter who they are.                  the president was not invited xD
I wish all of you who are complaining have already donated. Y'all just complain. At least these celebrities are doing something.

Dammit Rhi Rhi, why do you have me on the way to the store to buy your products
You look amazing, with and without it! I'm super happy Rihanna has launched this product! I have never worn foundation because I never felt like my pale olive skin had a place in the makeup industry..lol. glad this foundation worked for you. Such a beautiful woman you are :) thanks for this review

Makeup or no makeup YOU ARE FREAKING GORGEOUS.
I actually loved the way skin appeared before foundation was applied... after foundation is applied I find skin turning very oily in dis video clip ...sorry frank opinion
Girl...you don't EVEN need Fenty!  Your natural skin is gorgeous.  On a side note, I'm glad you liked their product but please make sure you are properly compensated for plugging them.
Girl you don't even need foundation your face look flawless 😍😍😍😍
I'm sorry but you don't need make up you are so beautiful already 😍🍫
I was thinking about you the ever since it launched. All I could think about is, will it range to Nyma's skin color though or even deeper. It looks amazing on you though, your skin is absolutely flawless

Turtorial on the hair!
Clear mascara and sea breeze!
I seriously love your positive  vibes!!! 💖💋
It's Veranica Soyer's scrunchie
Those sassy buns are on POINT today! 💕
<3
I had it😂
my fav 90s accessory was my pampers
I have the same one!! My best friend calls it my barbie case. 😍
Bunny! What eyeshadow and highlighter are you wearing??? That purple is to die for!!
My brother took a bite out of my lip smackers when he was like 1 lol.
Hard candy was not out in the nineties I believe it was Bonnebell nail polish!
I just bought a the same caboodle at target😍. It didn't come with cool stuff inside though😣
Love your hair. Love your makeup. Love the skull necklace.  Love the skull ring. Love the 90s. Born 92!
your makeup is so good please drop products
I was born in 2003 but supprisingly I have some of these things and I have the exact same box😱😖
Make-up you are wearing looks AMAZING! So pretty!!
I ate lipsmackers all the time as a lil kid
Teen spirit Strawberry was my life
I have that deodorant  I got it from the dollar tree
My favorite was the little mini nail polishes. I think they were called Bon Bons. In junior high, I used to paint my nails to match my outfit the next day. I love your top by the way. It reminds me so much of a shirt I used to wear at the end of the 90's/early 2000's.
LOVE this! Remember Lisa Frank? I loved the stationary. I also still own a scrunch, LOL. 90's was the best 😃
Gurl. What is your purple eyeshadow? I'm loving it so much.
Aww, I used to love those clips! I used to do that hairstyle that almost everyone had where you twist the front of your hair and put butterfly clips on the end, haha. I always wanted a Hard Candy nail polish, but I don't think they sold them at the time in England. I was born in '88. This was really nostalgic. :)
I didn't wear make up in the 90's , I was born in 91 but I sooo remember caboodles and the hair thingies! And my bubblegum scented sandals LOL
Have you heard of bless box?
Buy the Logo game!!! so many of the questions have to do with remembering slogans for the companies!!
Girl, I had a pastel pink 80's Caboodle! But please tell me how you get that hair!! (Pleaaase! Lol)
Remember when silver polish was a big thing in the 90s? I litterly had 5 bottled off solver polish!
There is a game  on that
I actually have a vintage board game about commercials and slogans. It's actually pretty fun.
They left out the Wet N Wild 666 lip liner with the Mocha Ice lipstick!! haha!! The 90's were so cool.
I used orchard blossom (apple scented) Teen Spirit until it was discontinued. So then I loved the strawberry one until I couldn't find it anymore in 2012. =[[ I miss it even as an adult.
i actually use that deodorant
Dude, I LITERALLY STILL HAVE the exact same caboodle, and I got Pink Crush around the same time. XDDD I still have a ton of hair stuff in my caboodle. I'm currently only 16, but I grew up with a lot of rather 90's things, including shows and cartoons. Greatly enjoyed my childhood.
You look amazing!!! I need your whole ensemble.
I breaded my hair like that too!!! I love to take it out in the morning to see how it turned out! 😍👌💚
Not sure if it was mentioned... Facebook did not exist in the 90's... you can totally register your caboodle!!  And yes, I was the one that had my hair in the butterfly clips holding back little twists.... LOL
The 90s quiz on Google play store
There's literally a board game called Slogans.
Those caboodles are at walmart. Definately not vintage. So im sure you could probably still get a nameplate. I have one lol i had to buy it.
you should do a how to for this hair style!!!! love it
U know that that thing in the thumbnail is actually at walmart
I have the same deodorant
Take a shot everytime she says authentic
Hoooooow did you do your hair?!
that magazineswas published on my bday
I also have the teen spirit deodorant it's just a new label look
You're always gorgeous but this video...GIRL😍 your makeup and hair is on point!!!!!!
I got that little pink box for my birthday like 2 or 3 years ago...😂
Since when is 90s vintage? I had my best looks in the 90s I was in high school then omg I'm not that old. Love the goodies you showed us
I WAS SO EXCITED FOR LIP SMACKERS. NOT THE 90S WITHOUT LIP SMACKERS DR PEPPER
I have a caboodle, and I did not know that they from the 90's! I have the same one as bunny!
My mom still has one of these
Teen spirit was legit my first deodorant to use when I little. And pretty sure it was that exact scent. Lol.
i have the same exact caboodle as you c:
Omg I have one of those boxes!!
No no had to be either rainbow or a black plastic chokers.. you know the ones. And cargo pants. Pogs
I loved this video i would like to see the 90s makeup
I still have a caboodle and I was born in the early 2000s
You have the prettiest eyes on earth 😍💙💙
I HAVE THE SAME CABOODLE
Just go buy stuff at the dollar store. ... flower hair clips.. mood rings. ...sparkly lip balm, scrunchies etc.
I no joke have the same caboodle and I just bought it at Walmart lol. I store my makeup in it
Loved it! I would love to see more stuff from the 90s and 80s great times great memories. 😊
Most these items are found at dollar General for a dollar so maybe this is a little pricey for what ya get...
The coadle paper is not 25 years old because it had the Facebook simble on the paper
can you please do a tutorial for this makeup?? <3
I think i am going to send you a box of 90's things!
I had one similar to that and it came with Jane makeup trial sized samples. I loved it so much and the Jane foundation and lipstick became my go to fav products in middle school. Lol.
I have that I got it for my 8th bday
Bunny, where is your skull necklace from?
I need that highlight y'all
Omg i used those butterfly and flower clips!!
Omg when I was a kid I knew a girl who would sit in church and consume an entire lip smacker tube during each service, I guess I'm not surprised to hear that other kids did that but even still just ?????
Yes they still make those ittybitty hair clips my mom done my hair with them a couple of years ago
I loved my caboodle! I loved lip smackers too. I did try my root beer flavored one but did not enjoy the bite of it! My favorite flavor back in the day was bubblegum!
I was born in 2000 but I have a purple box like that. I still have all of the old hair ties and clips
Can you PLEASE do a hair tutorial for those cute buns!? 🥐🥐
can you do a hair tutorial on this bun look ya got goin on!?
i had those flower clips! those butterfly clips!
Loved those Hard Candy nail polish with the ring & the Dr. Pepper Lip Balm. I still use it!
Omg love your hair and makeup in this video 😍😍😍 looks so mature and clean
Loved my caboodle.  Can't find one like it anymore.  Need one for my kid.  No one tell her its vintage now.
Is it weird that I actually have the same caboodle and I was born in 2004
First thought when the video started: she looks like a low lvl undead
how is the 90s vintage? 😬 vintage would be like the 30s, 40s, or 50s...
0:12. I have the same thing lol
Remember in 99 the moveable butterfly clips were all the rage? omg 90s I love you.
My 12 year old sister just got that box at Walmart a week ago
I had that deodorant and I am 10
I have this it is awesome
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! No fucking way... How?! I mean... HOW?!
If Bethesda wants to gain popularity from nintendo fans...\n\n\n\n\n....they're succeeding.
This is massive.\n\nBethesda putting other 3rd parties on notice! Lol
And Bethesda again shows itself to be better than E.A
Wow Nintendo nice call
I have the weirdest Boner right now
Hell yeah, thank you id software and Nintendo.
Bethesda is one of the best allies helping   the Switch if other game developer give it more of a chance Switch will be way more successful. (Now here come the hate comments).
Holy shit, this is big, this is fucking Huge!!!
first time i saw this in direct\n\n\nme:WAIT WHAT
Holy shit Nintendo is back, now if they could bring The Witcher 3 for Nintendo Switch, then there will be a excuse for me to buy a Nintendo Switch. Something tells me SONY is watching and saying holy shit is time to bring PS4 Portable.
haill to bethesda now wee need fallout 4
Amazing move from Nintendo!!!!
Never expected this
Can we collect amiibos instead of the pop vinyls in doom for the switch?
Vulkan API Boyz!!!!
Fuck playing Doom and Wolfenstein on the go will be so sick
I guess Doom CAN run on anything...huh..
Where did this boner come from
My PC can max out these games but I want the portability, so I'll be buying them for Switch.
Now we're talking!
Did they hire that guy from Polygon to play this build too?
Fucking Doom wasn't expecting that, will buy
Now if only we could get Deus Ex Human Revolution on this thing. Don't feel like getting a Wii U to play that version of the game.\nEDIT: NVM, I take it back, I just remembered the Switch doesn't have Dual Screen functionality.
Switch underpowered umm nope...
The haters are going rage hater mode with this
look like it's time to kill demons and Nazi on the go!!!
Wait, what?
and fifa switch is a fifa 18 ps3 port...
Kinda bummed that the Switch version of Doom won't be getting Snapmap. I'm probably one of those weirdos who really loved the idea of map building on the go.
If we get the next elder scrolls for switch, I would fucking bend the knee to Bethesda
Instead of porting old good games, nintendo is going to burn it self with new games that would barely run on it.\nIf Switch could run CS:GO and BF BC 2 on it with a decent multiplayer, their sells would be sky rocketing.
it's gonna be a weird feeling when the kkk and nazi's are on my switch.
I hope that the scenes they showed are switch footage (but it's probably not)
Time for me to cancel my Wolfenstein PS4 pre-order...
Looks like it's time to buy a lot more memory cards since the Switch has the same hard drive space as a Gameboy
Playing proper Doom while on a bus... that sounds fucking good.
I am not at all trying to sound greedy because this is freaking insane, CAN WE PLEASE GET DISHONORED 2 ON SWITCH?!?!?!
Swastika in a Nintendo Direct? *TRIGGERED*\n\nAll seriousness,  I'm glad Nintendo grew up.
Lets just wait and see if the game actually runs on anything higher than 480p 25fps before we collectively suck Nintendos dick!!!
Yay I can play the games I can never play cause I didn't have the right console
If switch gets doom\n\nOverwatch is a must now.
Is it just me or this smells like fucking downgrade?
looks blurry af tho :/ hope it will be 60fps at least
I can play Doom sitting on the toilet, in my bed, on the bus, in the sewers, on a tree, chilling in a hot bath,
Nice, but it won't sell well. Nintendo needs 3rd party games released on their system either exclusively or at the very least on the same day as the other platforms.
I wonder if doom will run at 60fps. Because the game was designed to run at a solid 60fps and anything less just won't work in my opinion
teh switch has no hardcor gamsssss\nit babby consollllll\nit needs more schuuuut\n*wish gets granted, haters have nothing to complain about*\n....... the gaphics still sux\n*points out it runs on a handheld system*\n*hater cries*\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
XBOX IN 3RD PLACE NOW FOR SURE! SERVES THEM RIGHT THO HAHAHA
I hope people support this, I have DOOM for the PC and it was an incredible experience.  And now that Wolfenstein 2 is coming to the Switch, I might pick it up for that instead of the PC.  Nice one Nintendo!
Gey fucking in there... never got the chance to play doom
I'm cool with some DooM on the go.
I'm glad i didn't buy doom last year. now ill be able to play the best version of the game and I'm really excited to buy and play this.
If you don't have a true understanding of the switches power. Just save your ignorant comments. The switch is slot stronger than alot of you realize.
I never thought Id hear this guy say Nazi
I could get the graphically superior versions on PS4 but I'm getting both of these on Switch.  Portability > Graphics
will those two games be running on 20 fps?
Can you run doom on a machine equal to a xbox 360/ps3??????(the switch)....can it even properly run it with frame rate problems???? And a 32 gb harddrive????? No, you can't....iphones even have 64/128 gb....32 is it????? Thats it????
Watch cod 2018 be on switch.  I'm calling it
Nice announcement ! one thing i noticed is that the downgrade is huge, if they keep the 60 fps stable it will still be a blast to play regardless of the visual quality.
Did honestly never see this comming.\nI think i just came a little bit...
OMG YES! DOOM ON THE SWITCH!
Yay, Doom on low settings and 30 FPS.
Nazis?  In my Nintendo?
This is really a surprise, i don't know how a system wich can't run Overcooked at 30fps will be able to run DOOM on the go... Maybe it's a custom built, or those Switch are gonna melt for sure
Delet this
YYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS
yoooo
wow, megaton announcement :o speaking of which....  fallout 3 plx?
damn the resolution looks sub 720p...
🎶bandz make Nintendo dance baybeeee🎶
Iconic:v
Damn
Holy shit man!!!
WHOO!!! 🤘😆
Fuckin hell yeah
NAAAAAAAANIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Thats incredible
OMG WTF DUDE THIS SHIT IS DOPE !
Noice
me Sorprende que lo pueda correr en la Nintendo switch
Well look at that. Nintendo says the word Nazi and shows the Swastika and the world didn't end. Man fuck these developers and their infantile pandering to the dumbest people on Earth.
low settings 720p 60fps im fine with it just 60fps pleaseeeeee
It the switch can run it, I'd like to see it for Android/iOS soon too
bad quality for nintendo switch\npd: better in pas4 and xbox one\npd: much better in PC Master Race
Older nvidia shield tablet which is less powerfull(half the ram etc) can run crysis 3 on android so surely switch can run about anything on a fixed platform. Super exited gonna buy both! Allready played doom on powerfull pc but gameplay over the graphics and take it on the go muchnwow!1
Doom's online mode is dead : /
Bruh, First Skyrim , then Doom and Wolfenstein, now I belive anything is possible. What's next? Fallout 4?!
Can doom even run 60 fps on the switch?
Yeah, because the Switch can totally run these.\nGuys I was joking, please stop replying !
30fps lol
xbox crossplay, please
AND THEY'VE LISTENED! DECENT THIRD PARTY SUPPORT! THANK FUCK! Took their time since the SNES era though!
So we can expect to run like shit in that shitty console, so why are the nintytards excited?
Nice now I can play the games I already owned at 240p and 15 fps.
Because of the unskippable 30 second ads, I didn't even watch the video.
Love every time they talk about this man on the podcast.
You kayaked passed the booie where you're supposed to kayak ... and you thought he was trying to kill you... lol

ayy number 10 on the trending page well done guys
Brandon is the less interesting person in the world
What is more likely? A relatively small group of eco activists are using their limited funds in a massive global conspiracy involving 97% of climate scientists to damage the economy in order to do something OR oil companies and such are using their obscene profits to bribe whoever they can in an attempt to avoid responsibility for any consequences their environmental activities will have?
Wow, what a worldly definition of love. Pure evil. Soli Deo Gloria!
The sky is falling!!The sky is falling!!!! @James Brown INCREASE in storms...Not so http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user230519/imageroot/2017/09/12/2017.09.12%20-%20Hurricanes.jpg there was more hurricanes and tropical storms in the 1800's!
Climate change deniers are either blind or ignorant So Stevie is admitting to being a climate change denier?
and when did Stevie see the data?
If you don't believe in climate change you must be blind or unintelligent...\n\nI guess Stevie isn't a believer!
Another brainwashed liberal trying to brainwash others about his global warming cult. \nThe very fact that recent tree ring data erroneously suggests cooling in the last 50 years, when in fact there has been warming, should be a warning flag about using tree ring data for figuring out how warm it was 1,000 years ago. - Dr Roy Spencer, Ph D, former NASA scientist
Yeah, Stevie, you were always blind, seeming pretty unintelligent yourself right now insulting people that don't have your liberal, muh feelin's views. Yet another platform for all of us to hear celebrity politics that don't matter right now. Watch Jerry Lewis years of telethons to raise money, and see how it's done. Just shut up and sing.
Ok, stevie wonder calling out global warming is like Marlee Matlin calling out noise pollution....REALLY? great musician, but drank the liberal cool aid...you moron! Stick to music or give a sollution!...does ANYONE have a sollution for global warming while these celebs' are flying around in their carbon emitting private jets, heating their multi-million dollar mansions and driving around in carbon dioxide spewing limos...oohh the hypocrocy! At least these idiots are good for a laugh... No wonder President Trump will win in 2020, these idiot celebrities are chasing people into his arms...MAGA!
WHAT STEVIE IS TRYING TO SAY IS HE DOESNT BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING
So Stevie Wonder said that blind people don't believe in climate change because the blind and unintelligent can't see it. Oh well Stevie why are you talking.
The hypocrisy is almost sickening. I'm sure Stevie enjoyed his plane ride home on his private jet. It seems this global warming thing only applies to us little people.
What a cringe fest! Nothing but a gigantic photo op for these self indulgent, sanctimonious assholes. The country will do just fine without your cringy mugs all over our tv screens. Keep your worthless talents and stay out of our homes. You degenerate scumbags wouldn't know charity if it kicked you in the ass.
It's a charity event, not a political rally. He was out of line.  At the very least, if you're trying to raise money, you don't insult those who MIGHT donate, duh!   Yes, I think climate change deniers are unintelligent, I agree w/ Stevie, but I certainly wouldn't say that if I was trying to raise money for a cause.  And on a tangent, his little Xian prayer could be seen as insensitive to non Xians and Nones.  He's a hypocrite.
LOL I did think it was funny and ironic... of course Stevie was trying to tell people that HE don't believe in Climate Change lol\nREPLY
Aw man...  I used to have so much love for Stevie until I saw this speech... Blind and unintelligent.
Praise the Prius! Halleluyah! Repent, you heretics who do not believe in the Doctrine of Man Caused Global Warming! The End is Near!
Stevie has never seen a Republican that he didn't hate.
Only an idiot would believe celebrity propaganda.
I love the scroll America's Got Talent will air immediately after this program. Especially during Stevie Wonder and Beyonce's rant. ROTFLMAO
stevie is so in your face! bless you man ! i applaud Stevie with his message here's a disciple of Mr. Wonder tribute to this genius Cause we've ended as lovers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h12kms2ceRo
I totally agree Stevie! So global warming isn't a thing? Well keep doing what your doing dont change and then dont complain when we see more hurricanes or worse! Then we will have another benefit concert for maybe you or a family member or friend of yours hat was effected by it. Thats right .. Just keep doing what your doing. Stay ignorant. But at the end of the day we get what we deserve with how we treat each other and our planet
global warming is a farce made up by politicians and celebrities who are brainwashed by paychecks when told to promote it.
That's why I'm donating directly to charities.
DJ KHALED ALERT!!!!!!!!!!\nAs I was watching this telethon last night the camera man showed DJ KHALED multiples of times with that red jacket on looking like THE KOOL-AID MAN and each time he was taking a phone call.  For some reason I had a vision for a minute of DJ KHALED saying \n PLEASE CALL 1-800-258-6000 BECAUSE WE THE BEST HAND IN HAND TELETHON \n(laughing) I bet he would have said that shit right then and there!!!
The group with the largest carbon footprint in the Universe is lecturing us on denial.
Hey celebrity assholes, what's your carbon foot print?
Let Stevie Wonder be an inspiration to us all, by stopping his touring and private jets, and huge resource sucking homes.
I want to know how much each of these super rich Hollywood libturds are giving to the hurricane victims.
Preaches love and then spews hate. Has been trying to hold on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gRAMAU7swM&t=16s
I believe in channel change
All you climate change deniers are Stupid FOOLS!
love you stevie wonder!!!  TY for standing up for scientific studies of climate change & pollution. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=global+warming+hurricanes&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C22&as_vis=1&as_ylo=2012&as_yhi=\n\nAmerican Meteorological Society: Climate Change: An Information Statement of the American Meteorological Society\n\nIt is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.” (August 2012)\n\nAmerican Physical Society: Statement on Earth’s Changing Climate:\n\nWhile natural sources of climate variability are significant, multiple lines of evidence indicate that human influences have had an increasingly dominant effect on global climate warming observed since the mid-twentieth century. Although the magnitudes of future effects are uncertain, human influences on the climate are growing. (November 2015)\n\nAmerican Geophysical Union: Statement on climate: “Human-induced climate change requires urgent action.”\n\nExtensive, independent observations confirm the reality of global warming. These observations show large-scale increases in air and sea temperatures, sea level, and atmospheric water vapor; they document decreases in the extent of mountain glaciers, snow cover, permafrost, and Arctic sea ice. These changes are broadly consistent with long-understood physics and predictions of how the climate system is expected to respond to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases. The changes are inconsistent with explanations of climate change that rely on known natural influences.”\n\n (Adopted December 2003, Revised and Reaffirmed December 2007, February 2012, August 2013)\n\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science: AAAS Board Statement on Climate Change\n\nThe vast preponderance of evidence, based on years of research conducted by a wide array of different investigators at many institutions, clearly indicates that global climate change is real, it is caused largely by human activities, and the need to take action is urgent. (December 2006, Reaffirmed December 2009)\n\nGeological Society of America: Position statement on climate change\n\nScientific advances have greatly reduced previous uncertainties about recent global warming. Ground-station measurements have shown a warming trend of ~0.85 °C since 1880, a trend consistent with (1) retreat of northern hemisphere snow and Arctic sea ice; (2) greater heat storage in the ocean; (3) retreat of most mountain glaciers; (4) an ongoing rise in global sea level; and (5) proxy reconstructions of temperature change over past centuries from archives that include ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, boreholes, cave deposits, and corals. (October 2006; revised April 2010, March 2013, April 2015).\n\nAmerican Chemical Society: Statement on Global Climate Change\n\nThere is now general agreement among scientific experts that the recent warming trend is real (and particularly strong within the past 20 years), that most of the observed warming is likely due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and that climate change could have serious adverse effects by the end of this century. (July 2004)\n\nU.S. National Academy of Sciences: Understanding and Responding to Climate Change \n\nThe scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to begin taking steps to prepare for climate change and to slow it. (2008)\n\nInternational academies: Joint science academies’ statement: Global response to climate change\n\nClimate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However, there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. (2005, 11 national academies of science)\n\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2014.  Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers\n\n“Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of green-house gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.”\n\n“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.”\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program, 2014. Highlights of Climate Change Impacts in the United States: The Third National Climate Assessment.\n\n“Over recent decades, climate science has advanced significantly. Increased scrutiny has led to increased certainty that we are now seeing impacts associated with human-induced climate change. With each passing year, the accumulating evidence further expands our understanding and extends the record of observed trends in temperature, precipitation, sea level, ice mass, and many other variables recorded by a variety of measuring systems and analyzed by independent research groups from around the world.” (thanks @pixilateddream for this!)
University of Miami President Julio Frenk, when speaking on the 8.1 earthquake in Mexico, tied it into climate change. When we deny climate change and all of that, and refuse to take action, we are affecting these poor people, he said, referring to the victims in Mexico.\n\nClearly climate change, the evidence is undebatable! — survivor of 8.5-9.0 quake (estimate) that destroyed Lisbon in 1755.
Guess I'm not listening to Stevie anymore. Brainwashed imbecile. Stick to music.
just sing Stevie.  What an opportunist to come out and say people are unintelligent if they don't agree with you….
What a joke! How about a debate instead of demonizing people! These celebrities no nothing and they're all hypocrites!\nhttps://youtu.be/TCy_UOjEir0
#truth
He is blinded by ignorance.
He's not mocking anyone. His words are crystal clear.
I loved Stevie Wonder but not anymore. I guess he has been recruited.
This was the saddest sight I've ever heard .
Just described himself blind and stupid
We're gathered here today to raise money for the Clinton global initiative to which will pay off the Haiti ponzi scheme
poor Stevie, everytime he opens his mouth to tell everyone to open their hearts and eyes, he gets into trouble. i hear even some pastor is after his neck. sounds familiar? the last time a popular man opened his mouth to tell us things we didn't want to hear, he got crucified ;)
Global warming...is a political persuasion. I'm not ignorant. God warns of judgement. This is just another money maker for democrats...just like abortion.
blessed are the blind who still can see !
this jerk is one wonder of a left wing stooge
He gets to try to shame people who are not drinking the communist koolaid!
Did he say they must be blind or unintelligent?! Oh mine!!!! Really!!!???!!!?
Global Warming is FAKE NEWS,    Climate change is FAKE NEWS.    Pollution and moving off of fossil fuels that's real news . . .    But people who actually believe we humans are the cause, well that's the definition of a Liberal.    A person who knows sooo much that just is not true
Blind in more ways than one.
Stevie Wonder must be blind if he believes in man made global warming.Oh yeah,he is.
That's nice Stevie, now go back into your bottle of formadahyde
Have you ever seen Stevie wonder wife? \n\n\n\n\n\nIf you you haven't either has Stevie wonder seen her.
You must be blind to say dumb shit like that, stick with your music dummy !
Well, little Stevie I must be blind and dumb then. So I'm gonna trot right down and sign up for me some disability checks. Fuck this working 50 or 60 hours a week just to pay too much in taxes.
Blind or unintelligent? When's the last time this guy looked into the mirror? Oops!
All combined, these celebs put more up their nose each month than they raised with this telethon.
Way to go Stevie... Everyone knows that the BEST way to maximize donations coming in to your little fund raiser is to call a majority of would be donors stupid.... I guess he can't SEE the irony....
These fucking ELITES don't give a fuck about the people of Harvey and Irma, they're raising money for the DNC!!!
Another dirtbag liberal running to have a benefit si they can spew their leftist politics. Shove your benefit up your ass turd mongers
I believe in climate change. I believe it's been around for billions of years, and not just the last 20.
Hey celebrity assholes, did you give a million dollars like Trump?
Someone tell that dumb nigger there were more hurricanes in 1988 even one that was bigger than Irma....dont take cheap shots at the president steve
If he wasn't blinded by stupidity he'd open his eyes and see that weather happens.
This scare has just about run it's course.
Your a fool that cant see the truth and you have the audacity to lecture others who can, pity on you
geo engineering !!! NOT climate change you idiots. \nwatch - O.D.D. Watching Geongineering ~ Worldwide Ground Based (WSAC) Weather Makers
Okay snow flakes.  Try and get a grip on reality.  These were just run of the mill hurricanes.
Another Liberal Loon
Liberal sodomite scumbag will burn in hell
thank you marytyhitvan
Stay blind you blind bastard
The people in this country that sit back and roll their eyes at scientist telling them that Climate change is real and don't believe them scare me. Yes Irma was not the strongest Hurricane and She may not even be a product of Climate Change, but Climate change IS real and the fact that you refuse to do anything about it and vote for people who also refuse to do anything about it is why we'll all get to say TOLD YOU SO when it all hits the fan in 50 years. Besides that, I seriously don't understand why it matters? Why if you don't believe in climate change would you not want to just say Hey, this is probably not true, but we only get one planet to live on so maybe we should try to take care of it, You know...JUST IN CASE!
so we are supposed to listen to a blind nigger fuck you O YA he can't read this lol hahhhhhhhhhhaaaa
Love, love, love, but hey, fuck Trump
Anyone who thinks a hurricane is climate must be blind or unintelligent.
Stevie Wonder revealed that he is part of the antichrist new world order and the last stand of rebellious man against a holy, Almighty God! Their end is eternal damnation. Read Revelation 19:11-16; 21:8, 27; 22:14-15 etc. Ready or not - Jesus is coming. safeguardyoursoul.com

Hi Sammi. I'm sure you'll never read this but I just wanted to say - you are doing such a good job being a mum! It is the hardest but most rewarding job in the world! My little boy was born about a month before Indie - it is so difficult! Don't beat yourself up about the little things. Xxx
Hey Sammi I really recommend you watching Alissa Ashleys video about fenty beauty <3\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shzzQxD53Tk
please do a tutorial! Hope you're doing well and Indie is getting so big already awww
The mould on your plant just means that it's been overwatered.
Fenty Beauty is a very good brand :)
Even if you were jumping on the gender roles bandwagon its a positive bandwagon, one we should all jump on!
Honestly, read the Handmaid's Tale the book is even better than the series x
what's wrong with your lashes? :DD so pointy on one spot :D
You look soo pretty in this Zara dress! xoxo
I'd just like to say, i love watching your vlogs you settle in as such a real and positive person, very familiar!
Sammie's so down to earth, literally the most down to earth YouTuber. I just get a good vibe from her and she's really real. I really want to be more like this, just wanted to say you are doing so great! x
“Basically if you're not white you kinda had a struggle with make up.“ Sure Sammi, as a ginger girl that got called “ghost“ I can tell you that there is something like too white too
yesss to the makeup videos!! i love all your videos anyways lol. Also, i cant believe indie is getting so big!! <3<3
Read All Souls Trilogy by Deborah Harkness-they are starting the filming of the series. \nAlso Outlander by Diana Gabaldon book series is a awesome television series.
Your mom seems amazing! Raising you and your siblings to be open minded and so kind :) Thats how I was raised as well. You are not superior to anyone. We are all equal. We are all humans! The gender roles things is so stupid. It is just a color. It is just a toy. One thing is not fit to one gender,and not the other. Anyways hope you are well,and loving these vlogs by the way xx
Hi sam! Loving your vlogs and baby. Just curious. Will you ever change your hair look? Like longer with big curls maybe? Im sure ull look lovely. Just a suggestion..
People should just get a life and being so judgy. Just do u Sam!
Btw, the only thing that matters is that you're educating Indie with LOVE and we all can see that in your vlogs. Doesn't matter what colours she wears.
I am white and very pale and I never find the perfect shade either, all of them are too pink or too orage on me, so it's not only a problem for darker skin, it's a problem of the brands not being realistic while producing a foundation.
i don't know where you are in The Handmaids Tale  but OMG! \nepisode 3? Nick the driver? ( faints)\ni've watched the entire season 3 \ntimes. \nthe series was updated quite a bit from the book, but Margaret Atwood was part of the re-write.\nshe even makes a cameo. \n\ntell us what you thought of the entire season when you're done...\nif you want.🙂
First time watching ur channel but you are honestly the most genuine and positive person! xxx
If you like oryx and crake read the heart goes last and the edible woman as well! The heart goes last is so interesting xx
You and Jason are the perfect parents for Indie ♥\nShe´s your child and you make the best decisions for her. \nYou guys know your child better than anyone else.\nDont give a damn about anyone elses critic over your parenting.
Oryx and Crake is a great book - I can't wait to see how they adapt it, especially after how good a job they've done on the Handmaid's tale!
Sammi you're seriously so pretty!! And sometimes I see indie and I wonder how drop dead gorgeous she will be when she's older, in a non creepy way ahaha she's just sooo cute! God bless her with her teeth coming in all at once must be so hard to handle for you both! All the best darling! So much love from Canada xoxo
Trust me: being very very pale is also foundation-hell. So either way, you're screwed.
The handmaid's tale is amazing!! I didn't think I would like that much, but the story and characters are so good. I have cried so many times watching it, it is really a dramatic and scary era... Can't wait for season 2!
OMG HANDMAIDS TALE🙌🏼🙌🏼 I watched the whole season in a week. I found it all very interesting and captivating. Not too sure what part you're at so I will refrain from any accidental spoilers. Enjoy!
I love your makeup tutorials because you are very minimal like me so its gona be exciting to see what you do with the fenty makeup. Ive seen so many reviews already but they really caked it on. Thats fine i and i like the way it looks just not on me so this will be great! Love from America
Haven't watched in a while. So happy for you.💕💕💕
You should read the Handmaid's Tale!! So good!
Indie literally has the most beautiful eyes. I'm SOOO JEALOUS
how old is your daughter?
Yas girl, you're on trending! You're so humble, I always enjoy watching your videos 😊
Was it a layer of white fungus along the top? If so- likely mycelium, which doesn't harm your plant. Rather, fungi help the plant to take up nutrients from the soil more efficiently. It will grow when the soil stays wet for a prolonged period of time. Plant should have been salvageable- can always repot in new soil or clean up the fungal bits by hand :)
Indie is so cute she should be in ads 😍❤️❤️
The Handmaid's Tale is soooooo good. I read the book more than 10 years ago and loved it. The show is equaly amazing. Watched season 1 in 3 days. Just couldn't stop 😊
I love the way you do your eyeliner, so if you could add that to your tutorial 👌🏾😉
I'm probably the whitest person i know and i still to this day have a struggle finding the right shade foundation. There's a lot of light shades for white peeps out there but from my experience the undertones are too pink, yellow or literally white that it just looks weird on my face and compared to my body. I feel like people forget that white people don't all have the same skincolor or the same undertones. And if i do find the perfect shade by some miracle it freaking oxidises. Sooo now i just use concealers for foundation.
I watched the promo for the handmaidens tale and boy I really want to watch it, looks so scary
feeling exactly the same about going back to gym after a long time
Does Indie watch tele every time she's home👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Another Margaret Atwood adaptation is coming out on netflix called Alias Grace, definitely worth a read xx
0:14 I can't cope she's too adorable xxx
The Handmaids Tale book is amazing :D there's so many hidden messages xxx
Some white people struggle as well, majority of the time I have to add a white foundation to everything x
Wow!! Great video.. I love mine https://youtu.be/7b4mMV7ahpk
I am very pale and also always struggle to find the right shade!
I had to read The Handmaids Tale for a class. The book was so good and I have to get around to watching it to see any differences. I totally recommend that you still get around to reading it. 💛
Sammi you're doing a great job, I love how real you are. You're super hardworking and please know that the ones criticising you are in the minority. Why they're even on your channel I don't know?!
Please do a chatty fenty haul! Also, I had to take breaks watching the handmaiden's tail, it can get to you!
Sammi could you do a video of what you do at the gym like workout routine..by the way love your videos and FAM!!❤❤❤❤
Growing up I was never able to get a light enough shade of foundation or concealer :( now it's a bit easier
Pleaseee where is your living room art prints from 😩😩💓 xx
It's not that you bought pink it's that it was in same video, I totally agree about bringing up your child to know about gender but that it doesn't limit you in what you want to do or achieve, my daughter had a little tikes garage and cars, toys should be universal and it's where people take gender roles too far either way thats a problem, being aware and wanting to make a difference for your child regardless of their gender is a powerful and important thing to do, xx
Pls dont do a voice over in the makeup tutorial :p
How can you avoid buying pink when most clothes for girls are pink? Of course, not all but most. If you see a nice pink dress, you can afford it, it's her size..., YOU BUY IT. If you see a nice blue shirt, you can afford it, it's her size...., buy it. GOD. Why are people complaining? lol (I believe I'm getting my POV out there)
You always look so stunning sam! ❤
Handmaid's Tale is sooo good, I watched it a couple of weeks ago. Can't wait for the next season
You have what it seems quite a fair complexion so I didn't think you found it hard to find foundation shades.
Hey sammi where's your gold necklace from? You've probably mentioned before but obviously I didn't get it 🙈🙈 xxx
I loved the handmaids tale at the beginning but towards the end I was keen x
Where's your phone case form?! I love it!
Gym struggle is real! I procrastinated an 8 minute ab workout for hours yesterday and I constantly do this thing where i go back for the first time in ages, then I rest the next day cause I'm sore then I never go back 😂
I watched that serie and i was in shock by the main idea of the serie and all the things happens to her 😱😱😱, but people need to watch it.\n❤️ u from Spain! 😘😘
You dont need to explain yourself when it comes to what color clothes you buy for your daughter, people need to fucking relax and worry about their own damn lives. You're a great mom.
You are right. Trying to raise your child without gender id limitations doesn't mean you have to ignore her gender. I just means you don't push her into a traditional model of gender roles. I think you're doing a great job.
The new couch with the plant looks so nice together. Glad you've got a new friend in the mix! It's so hard to meet good people.. meh - thanks for sharing Sam! xx
lol that shoddy Ocean Bells place is in Watford xD
I'm so excited to see your video on Fenty! My shopping cart looks JUST like yours lol! I got a sample of the foundation and I love it. I picked up the lip gloss and it's my most favorite ever, so comfy to wear and flattering.
OH MY GOD INDIE IS SO BLOODY CUTE
The Handmaid's Tale is the best TV I've seen since Mad Men! A very important piece of work. They have a great instagram page, handmaidsonhulu xx
Love  we watch almost the same shows.
Hi Sammi! I'm not sure if you'll see this but I'm about 4 months postpartum with my second and with my first I had a lot of postpartum depression and anxiety so I was determined to handle it better the next time around. I've been taking Evening Primrose Oil supplement (it's suppose to help regulate hormones) as well as a vitamin B complex supplement with my multivitamin and it has really helped me out. Also if it's a cloudy day and I can't get out in the sun I take a Vitamin D3 supplement. I hope this helps in any way. I know postpartum issues can be so debilitating and then having your life public for criticism must not make it any easier 😕 but I love your videos and have always admired your honestly!
Yes to makeup tutorials always love you doing them! And people need to calm down your human xx
I still love your beauty tutorials! I don't need you to be the best at makeup because I'm not the best either. I just love seeing you doing something creative and talking about how the products work for you. That trophy wife shade in the highlighter looks amazing on everyone of EVERY skin tone. It's so incredible!
Just watchin your video and thinking about your TATTOOS: how do you feel now about them (as a parent, adult etc)? Does your mind changed? Do you still want to add more on your body? How your point of view about your tattoos and tattoos in general has involved trought years? This is a video i would love to see on your channel! :) \n(sorry for english mistakes i am french) Have a nice day! Take care!
I love you girl ! Don't feel you need to explain yourself. Just let the people who want to pick everything you say proceed. You do you xxxxx
Yaaaayyy love your videos so so much! Always make a coffee for myself and enjoying:) by the way I'm soooo in love with your family and London ❤️🎉💋 have a nice day beautiful mamma
You hit the nail on the head with the whole gender neutral topic! As always Sammi rise above what others have to say, but you already know that 💕
8:40 was that alt j for a second? love them
You shouldn't make political comments if you are going to take offense at your viewers reactions. Seems to me like it's an easy stance to take and a rather old one at that. I'd like to think we are past the point of girls wear pink, boys wear blue, yada yada... Don't understand why you have even brought that up, like it was a thing.
I think the plant needs more air circulating around it to stop the moisture in the air from making it mouldy. Maybe put it near an open window sometimes. Ah lame comment
HERE ARE MY THOUGHTS!\n1. in response to what you said earlier: i fully trust you, your opinion on makeup and your makeup skills! i adore your tutorials and often finish watching the video having learnt something!\n2. Sam, I'm white myself and still unable to find the right shade LMAO\n3. i HAVE to start working out again, having graduated hs i have no excuses...\n4. FUN FACT: PINK used to represent the boys a couple centuries ago because it is stronger as a colour than blue!! And now it's a girl's colour... hell yeah.\n5. it annoys me how there are some people in our small community that always take your words out of proportion and assume whatever. you're always so clear with your opinions, what''s needed by us the viewers is sth as simple as logic. guess not everyone has that....\n6. I'M LOVING VLOGTEMBER!!!!! kisses xx
How is this on trending?
All this gender rubbish is getting completely out of hand now. As a mother of a child who cannot yet make her own decisions you havr every right to dress her however you see fit. I'm a few years older and i cannot remember this ever being an issue when i was a kid. Parents dressed their kids in whatever they felt like. I had a Thomas the tank engine cardigan and postman pat jumper that i would happily wear when i was wearing a pretty frock. Many friends and relatives would have hand me down toys and clothes that weren't necessarily the 'right' gender for them. But they didn't care. Why? Because they were a damn kid and stuff like that didn't matter. If you're trying to force a teenage boy to wear a dress then that's another story. Sometimes things like clothes and toys are gendered. Get over it. Buy what you feel like.
I loved the The Handmaid's Tale too!
Indy is Adorable such a beautiful baby, I think she looks so much like your mum ❤️
That pink dress tho!!
Your brows are looking great!
Your beautiful
i love jenny!!!

YAASS ROBYN IS THE QUEEEEEN
Indie's tiny ponytails are SO CUTE
You say how difficult it is for Asian/tan/black girls to find their perfect shade and make it seem easy for white girls to get the perfect shade. I agree to an extent but as a Scottish pale skinned girl (super pale I may add) I've never found my perfect shade. I'm still having to mix two foundations to get a decent colour that somewhat matches me because I find everything is either too pink or yellow toned. It's wonderful that Fenty has created so many shades so that all of us can find something that is hopefully perfect. I shall definitely try it out!
Handmaids Tale was boring, I found
Sammi's vlogs are always trending!!
YOUR EYES!😍😍🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
It really annoys me how as soon as any woc talks about struggling with foundation shades, all these pale white girls come out of the woodwork saying how tough it is for them to find the right shade..
pew die pie lost 6k subs only vid about pewdiepie last 2 says have over 12million views so no one cares what he say pewdiepie is  the best as i say always if you touch him deal with me
Considering he is streaming for tens of thousands of viewers at my moment of writing this, it doesn`t look that way. But then again, that wouldn`t be gossip for you to post would it?
This is literally why YouTube is Cancer, like if he ends up getting taken down that's fucking handicapped because there's like a bunch of other super popular youtubers that free flow the word nigger on a daily.
Poor little youtubers losing their whore money. I really couldn't care less.
You're a bottom feeder man...
Still dont understand why white people are so offended when the word doesnt affect them at all... Stop excusing pewds for using the most racial slur you could call a black person. He isnt racist but it should be swepted under the rug
He used the word in a context witch was referring to a black male.
i feel bad for pewds. i know i've said stupid shit without meaning it in the spur of the moment. i've been lucky and not had a camera on me.
I made a video about the pewdiepie situation plz check out
honestly I don't even watch pewdiepies video's I never have but all you faggets out there making video's saying hes a racist are no better, everyone has said things they don't mean, everyone makes mistake and one last thing the developer who made firewatch and is saying hes going to take down pewdiepies video's is a ungrateful piece of shit and he should be ashamed of him self.\nAlso when people are mad they say shit they don't mean, it happens there is no need to bitch about it about it\nEdit: If your a youtuber bitching about how your not going to make as much money now fuck off money isn't everything and if your that concerned go get a real fucking job
Stfu in the context he said it was absolutely not meant to be offensive if words hurt you in that kind of context you're fucked and life's gonna feel very tough you bunch of niggers
Come on just because he said one fucking word.......ONE WORD....
I thought this guy was dead
It's just only words huh? That's the stupid shit a racist would say. Good riddance if you ask me... I guess t.v and the radio mold it in your mind that's it's ok to say it...
Hey what's up guys, it's scarce here
PewDiePie does profit from the gameplay. No gameplay no PewDiePie, but I see where your coming from as well. PewDiePie plays a game people do buy it. But I can't defend PewDiePie.
Everyone complaining about it can't seem to use proper grammar...
So the firewatch developer is a hypocrite?
You said with a hard R however it wasn't he said it out of context. There was nothing directed towards racism
A word can make a huge impact on you. #TodayPeople
Ahh ksi pissed smh to me he ain't black little UK pussy for some reason when he says nigga it makes me uncomfortable
this is all stupid everybody says nigger online like wtf look i just said it and im not trying to be racist.
FUCK OFF WITH THE NIGGER !!!! We can say Whatever We want !!! Negro is black in Spanish
Who the fuck cares if someone says nigger today? There is so much bigger problems today than saying a word. There is terrorism, poor people, shitty beliefs, kidnapping, suicide and much more.
Yeah, there is no excuse but there is still context to be considered. Pewdiepie is a gamer, he is constantly in that gaming atmosphere. And if anyone games regularly you will know already why Pewdiepie did it. Using the hard R is so common in the gaming world. Especially in games like PUBG, Rust, and especially CS:GO. The hard R has almost lost its sense of meaning in the gaming world. I was strongly disgusted with the use when I started gaming a year ago. Sadly, over the past year I have seen this used SO much that I have become numb to the use. And yes, this is sad and disappointing, but it's hard when you go into games and constantly hear this. Even from good people. Pewdiepie has fallen to the norm. He has been influenced by the community he is supposed to be influencing himself. Firewatch is such a hypocrite to do this. They give people the rights to stream and do videos on their content and then attack Pewdiepie? They don't control their content themselves. Pewdiepie may be used as an example now but there is such toxicity in every game and the game creators are doing nothing to actual impact the quality. Game bans are a joke and that's only IF that even happens. Which is rare. I agree the gaming community needs so much work, children are a heavy impact on this. I noticed from PS4 to PC, the PS4 gaming atmosphere was more mature and less infected by the hard R. It's still exists, but not nearly this bad. And coincidentally, there are less children under the age of 16 using mic on PS4. I believe the core issue is gaming devs. They need to make more effort to clean their community of toxic players. I'm sick of going into game lobby's with children using the hard R and degrading people. I'm tired of the porn avatars and the disgusting attitude towards race and even gender. Woman are giving little to no respect in games, just as the hard R is not respected. Don't even get me started on the Russian/American drama as well. Pewdiepie is not to blame here... he is just another person that fell to the toxic community, and that falls on all of us. We ALL need to change this and take responsibility.
this is why the damned parent block is on youtube. turn it on if you dont want to be offended, as eminem once said, STIFIN UP THAT UPPER LIP
baww pewdiepie is lowering my income congrats on not having a real job and being affected by people saying nigger online
If you are pissed off about standing up for injustice, you are against justice. Racists MUST B STOPPED AT ALL COSTS!
Don't know if you've had a plastic bouncy water bottle thrown at you before, but it dosn't hurt as much as you seem to think. \nNot that i condone throwing anything at someone. :P
fuck off scarce nobody likes you go back to your tree.
People gotta chill its just a word, that some guy said on the internet...lmfao
for fuck sake, everybody needs to stop making this word so much of a big deal to say. Who cares about it?  its a word! words do not hurt you or cause you harm.  Anybody who is offended by this word needs to grow up, get a life and get thicker skin because it sounds like you are all pussies.
Scarce fuck your opinion stop telling us no one cares just report the news
Assault with a deadly water
Why is this with Pewdiepie a big deal, I know it's a really bad word but he's only a guy, sometimes he can't help it sometimes- it may have been that he kept teasing it but he immediately apollogised, showing he didn't mean it. There are so many other problems in the world and it makes me so disappointed that because of one word, Pewds may have actual life absolutely destroyed, not many in the meadia realizes that he can lose his home and have to find another to fucking have just enough to eat and survive and barely feedhis pets too.
People need something to complain about.
Listen, I'm black myself i have a lot of friends who say the hard r and honestly it was surprising to hear pewdiepie say it. he's not some evil guy now or anything he made a mistake. a lot of people don't even care and he's not some racist all of a sudden. that word holds a lot of sensitivity to it and it's not fair. saying it doesn't make you racist if it's not the way it's intended. if he had used a different racial slur i'm sure this wouldn't even be as close to as big as it is. people need to let go of the hate these words hold if they're not used as intended. just because he's a big youtuber doesn't mean it's anymore important that he said it than other people.
KSI say the N Bomb too
Don't give a shit \nLike Ksi\nLike pewdiepie \nThat it
Give me a sex
Check my boy out 😂 he reacts to a lot of things and his funny !\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/#/channel/UCzPnLnnAkedHhK2xA94Pwqw
So the media blows up when pewdiepie says the N word once, but when idubbbz says it they don't get a fuck.
Why does this matter judge me i dont care but just because you say something that WAS a really bad thing still is but doesn't mean you copywrite them,so thud is stupid and you all need to grow a pair or grow up
Like if pewdiepie has the nigga pass...
But why can idubbbz say it and pewdiepie can't? It was an accident by him and he didn't mean it, just because he said a word once doesn't mean he is destroying the community while there are other channels that are actually run by racists and constantly spew their racist ideas. He didn't say it referring to a black person and ITS JUST A WORD. People need to realize that words shouldn't mean or do anything to anybody, stop being so goddamn sensitive. Also why does sky Williams ALWAYS get involved in shit that he has no part in?
OMFG people say nigger so much its not even bad anymore
This is not a huge deal.
Shut the fuck up, it is not a big deal! Fucking bullshit people go fuck yourself. Go cry QQ
Man fuck this shii, I give pewdiepie the nigga pass, also ya some soft ass bitches for this shit
I have never heard of PewDiePie until today I watch you too all the time it's just crazy but I will say that words do matter the race issues very sensitive in this country right now because of our commander in chief for him to drop that words so casually he said it before let me just say this it's clearly obvious to me that white people don't understand what racism is if you can say that word so casually and as derogatory as he said it bottom line he's a racist I don't care how you try to make it fix it it is what it is I hope they take all his channels down everything is done
Fuck you your just making worse because nobody even cares tjat he said that
There is alot of pain and hate behind that word and it shouldn't be used by ANYONE  even if your joking around.
*Idubbbz says the n word*\nEveryone: lmao much comedy\n*Pewdiepie says the n word* \nEveryone: I'M WHITE AND SHOULDN'T BE OFFENDED BUT OMG HE'S SO RACIST
I don't get why it's such a big deal, if he said any other racial slur it wouldn't have been this big of a deal..
every white guy on earth defending pew die pie, everyone else knows saying the n word is bad. and the fact that saying it as an insult to someone is wow..fuck the community. i cant wait for youtube to start regulating this hateful bullshit.
Pewds is a cunt tho he's not even funny I have no idea whhy pewds has so many subscribers they must be retarded
Jesus christ people, iDubbbzTV says the n word all the time and no one cares, I dont care either but then pewdiepie says it by accident and then he gets in all of this trouble, just leave him alone, he's human too, he makes mistakes just like you and I.
Who is he damaging saying the n word? Its just a word sensitive sjw's...
guys leave pewds alone he clearly dint mean to say it I mean I have done the same thing I get mad and I don't relize what I sayed
What makes it even worse worse about saying the N word is that the majority of his followers are kids so hes setting a bad example
Idubbbz: Ni**er \nPeople: meh\nPewDiePie: Ni**er \nPeople: WHAT THE FUCK GUYS IT'S THE END OF YOUTUBE TAKE DOWN HIS CHANNEL NOW.
Ok, I'm kinda gonna rant a bit here; why did every one get pissed at pewds? Almost every other person on the internet is throwing that word around like candy at a parade, and he said it ONCE. By ACCIDENT. Now I'm not a pewdiepie fan or anything, I actually think he's kinda been getting annoying as hell, and yeah, it's not ok to say stuff like that, but still, ONCE, when other people just throw it out. I don't care if he's bigger and more influential, he's still just a regular guy, he makes mistakes, we all do! Everyone's just blowing this waaaaay outta proportion
U called that game is quite popular and then indirectly said pewdipie helped make the game popular
I find it funny that most the people complaining prolly say the n every day lol and why are white people complaining??
who cares if he said nigga no one
FUCK KSI AND FUCK ALL THE HATERS THAT ARE BEING LITTLE BITCHES OVER THIS SHIT😂😂😂💀💀💀PUSSIES!
Black people get so emotional when you be racist to them. Everyone else doesn't ... as much.
Who the fuck cares if he says the n word, idubbtz said and many people have said it\nGET THE FUCK OVER IT!
DUDE ,at least wipe the damn tear off your right eye if you put contact lenses before making a video  , it doesn't let me focus on the video content...
It could of been accident, I don't hate gays but I almost said the word faggot by accident after getting gang rape in wow battle ground, I wish luck that pewdiepie on issue
*Nigger* oh my god i just had a fucking seizure \n*Sarcasm*
Are you serious Scarce he said nigger who cares it doesn't affect anyone!
That's stupid, he shouldn't get taken down over a word.
A lot of people say the N word, just cause they are black it does not make it okay to say.!
just stop...
Hi guys scarceeeeeee hereeeeee u know your a fucking meme dude lol

Yall are stupid. Not being such pooseys

Who cares
Nigger?
yu suk scars, suk dic whor/ Max ö0beruhgunu\nuh8
who fucking cares
Sky was obviously joking...
shits wack unsubbed from pewds.
I love how she was asking if the host's dad is ok after the cancer. Shows she really cares about people even interviewers and not just focusing on talking about herself! :)
What's really respectable is she only talked about rejecting her writing credit for one of her biggest hits (My Life Would Suck) because she was directly asked about it, she wasn't trying to brag or show off but just bring light to an issue that is very important and relevant in the music world.
Kellegendary Clarkslay. Classy woman. So sincere. I love that she answered the Dr. Luke question, most people would've dodged it.
Kelly Clarkson didn't want her name near Dr. Luke. So she lost out on thousands maybe even millions for her writing credit. That speaks volumes!👌🏼
9:10 Dr. Luke's part
Amazing woman! Her ideals are really strong.
I love you Kelly.
Whoah! I'm too early!\nFirst comment? LOL\n\nKelly though...this was a fun interview and I love Kelly so much!
Yasss miss kelly we stan
kelly is a motherfucking womam!!!
She is such an amazing person. My favorite singer EVER!
I have always liked her
Mad respect for her.
Love her!

Why is Christian in swimming trunks? He should at most be in a Speedo! They are in Nice after all... XD
Wait... I felt like the 2nd one just came out
It's true that if this man wasn't rich, no girl would allow this unless they have incredibly low self esteem
Why is she still with him?
men watch this for sex scenes.. women watch this for the drama and the hopes that a billionaire guy would randomly take her and make her as his wife, in short women's fantasy .. :D
Why am I here cause this movie is shit u know what lemme get outta here
These two actors will not be able to have a successful career once this Grey series are done. Sadly, they've pigeon holed themselves by signing up for these franchise.
oh great, another movie where a slut fucks a dude with a big dick what a surprise.
No one is gonna watch the movie for the story itself everyone came for the sex
Just a big budget Audi commercial that will be less interesting than an actual Audi commercial. Unless of course you are a  40 to 60 year old woman who hasn't had sex in 10 years. Just makes me mad that actual good filmmaking gets passed over for trash like this.
face it we all already know what she looks like underneath so whats really the appeal to watch this moive???

Can i build brown bricks on this version?
I want to see all minecraft kid beg their mother to buy the 3ds for playing minecraft
so many people thought the 3ds couldn't handle it
Well....look like I'm not going to get the 3DS Edition
If my 12 year old self saw this bricks would have been shited
This is what the Wii u edition should have been
I have tried it and to be fair it's not that bad.
Bull fucking shit. GAME ONLY PLAYABLE ON NEW 3DS!?!?!?!?? NO OLD 3DS!?!!?!!?!??!!??!!?!??!!!?!?!?!?!?
Who would want this when you have the Switch version?
Ummmm I already have it on PE Switch Ps Vita and Xbox
Aw Man I Have A Old 3ds Not A New One...
Wow 2 years late
This crap is.... Wut
The minecraft plague get another victim
Omg
ok, uhm, how do i change between touch and button controls tho?
I remember buying this on Wii U expecting it to keep me occupied for a long time. Nope. Boring as hell.
would be cool if this could have the mario mashup. and if it would *actually come out in europe I've been waiting for like over half a minute why's it not out yet*
They already have a Minecraft like game on 3ds what's the point of this there's no multiplayer and it's already on Switch
Take A Deep Breath:\nMinecraft exclusively on:\nWii U, NEW3DS, Xbox360, Xbox One, Xbox One X, Xbox One S, PS3, PS4, PS4SLIM, PS4PRO, Reapberry PI, PC, Mac, Linux, IOS, Android, FireOS, \n\n\n\nDid I Mention It's On Switch?
This is honestly just to cash in on the fake Minecraft knockoffs on the 3DS
Gotta remember that Minecraft is marketed towards the kids, so don't be surprised Nintendo wants to milk it to death.
man they are just milking minecraft at this point l
It did come hmm cool
It's too late..
Im get a circle pad pro for this because I only have the old 3ds
People also said that this would be impossible, lol. This is great!
Can't wait for the refrigerator tv edition
So will this get the better together update?  Lol
I've actually really wanted this a few years ago, now not so much but it's still pretty cool
NO LOVE FOR ORIGINAL 3DS USERS lol jk i don't play Minecraft
The graphics are garbage
Thought about buying terraria for 3ds but this comes out, sorry terraria
I have to say it to the world,the PSVita is way much better than this New 3/2ds version (cause as you know Nintendo let die the old 3/2ds models)
Looks like a potato, but you still need a new 3ds system, it’s too late
WHERE CAN I BUY IT?!😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
It looks like something from 2012. And abit late dont you think Nintendo? If this came out a few years people would be more excited but in 2017 really? And why Minecraft New Nintendo 3DS Edition and not Minecraft 3DS edition. Is it really not coming out for the old 3DS. I cant imagine playing Minecraft with that little c-stick lol.
I don't see why they released this now. I always thought it would be cool if the 3ds could have it and now that dream is a reality. Problem is the switch performance is much better and it's going to have cross platform. I would have bought this if it was out 2-3 years ago but no I wouldn't.
THIS is how the Wii U version should have been.
If Minecraft Wii Edition existed, I would be quite surprised.
Will it have local or online multiplayer?
how can i get the cia?
Oh so this is 4K minecraft...
I'm not a fan of Minecraft, but damn this is actually pretty fucking cool.
It wont work on my galaxy
This version is not developed by 4J, Mojang, or Microsoft, its developed by Ocean Interactive but it is based on the pocket edition
only on NEW NINTENDO 3DS*  Why!!!!!!!
Sucks that it's New 3DS exclusive.
Oh Lord, they finally did it
My reaction: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02J5Q4L8WQE
So, basically a stripped down version of the main game, similar to the 3DS port of Super Mario Maker. Considering all children these days have smartphones, if not an untethered one or tablet, it would be way easier to just play the Pocket Edition. More content, worse controls, but still superior.
You have to add multiplayer !!!
Oh good! This basically means I don't have to buy the Nintendo Switch version since I currently have the Wii U version. It may be a little late to release this game now, but for New Nintendo 3DS and Wii U owners this is an absolute steal.
i didnt find it on the eshop😕
From Minecrafts own page here https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-new-3ds \nWe want to stress that the game is only on the New Nintendo 3DS series, and we've used all the technical might of the dual-screened wonder machine to give you world sizes of 2016x2016 and 128 blocks high! Multiplayer won't be available at launch but we'll have more to share on the feature later. This edition's closest equivalent is 0.15.4 of Minecraft: Pocket Edition, and we'll be continuing to update from there!\nSo, $30 for the $7 mobile game, but NO multiplayer.
What I want to know is: will it support the stereoscopic 3D? If it does then it's grrrrrrreat and I'll probably pick it up. :)
F**K Nintendo and Mojang for not making a  Normal 3DS port that will have only touch controls!!!!
Well time to upgrade to a new 3DS
So i will be able to play 30-40 hours Minecraft on my New 3DS? Oh yes...that´s a sure buy...Also it´s better than on WiiU thanks to using Fixed Shaders & not shitty AMD/Nvidia-shaders that means 2016x2016 big worlds...(Bigger worlds, even bigger than on Switch)... So yeah. If it has that Mario MashUp-Pack & DLCs, i will get it finally.\n\nFuck the Switch-version (which is only 2 hours on the go xD). Hahahahah- every smartphone`s battery dies in just 2-3 hours...i will play right next to them in a few months- 10x longer easily and laugh about them Oh wait, your battery has just run out? That´s too bad. Mine has just started to warm up...xD ;)
MFW i have a normal XL and not a new one
I already feel the 20 fps, loads of paid content and 4 chunks render distance. Beautiful console.
Notch was right years ago.
I swear this fucking game is out for every system now
Remember when everyone was faking this game for the 3DS? \n\nAnd now, after many years, we get our game.
How many times was this re-released?
Umm. Its been 8 hours and still no UK release.
Ok since the minecraft 3ds edition come out now we will wait for the psp version....
This is awesome i haven't played minecraft yet so im excited!
This would have been an amazing 3ds launch title. Now i don't really care.
I have a bad feeling about this one...
I'm so hyped even tho I got minecraft on everything
Game of the fucking year
No way
More consoles = More money
PC>>>>>>>XBX1X>>>>>>>PS4 PRO>>>>>>PS4>>>>>>>XBOX1>>>>>>>>Switch>>>>>>>>>>>ios>>>>>>>Android>>>>>>>>>Vita>>>>>>>>>3ds
3ds\n*shows 2ds*
Damn no standard 3ds version.
Brown Bricks on 3ds
Why tho
That's nice
2 years late
what? why
Graphics looks awful hahahaha
Is it online?
Wat
HOLY CRAPPPP
Cool
Cool
the fuck.
fINALLY YES
Really and 2ds normal???
BWAHAHAHAHA
Too little, too late. Period
well i called this... 5 years ago...
but like any smartphone can run the game 100x better than 240p at like 2 chunks
Why not for original 2Ds tho? You'd probably get even more copies sold if u gave it for the original handhelds
With homebrew they can fix and add mods
It would be depressingly funny if they launched a miiverse community for this version.
Who asked for this?
Can someone tell me what she has achieved in life
Honestly don't know why we still have fashion shows
she is paid millions to just walk YET she falls or almost falls or loses her shoe !\nbut when it comes to her dumb one lazy face or fake smile selfie no one can beat her on it well expect #kendull and #kylips
She kept it professional☺☺🙄
Ugly people of the world unite. It's like u r instantly ugly for showing up here.
I'd let her walk all over me shoes on or off
Y'all don't care yet you still had time to write a comment about it? Most models must face strict diets and such, and they are just showing how well models could pull off something when other people couldn't. You might as well just watch the video and keep the comments to yourself instead, stop showing hate and sarcasm.
I am supposed to be impressed because some hypocritical Muslim cunt can walk?
Because...when you get paid $10k a show, you'd better be fucking creative.
She gets paid an amount of whole the commentsection combined. She better walk it off
why the FUCK is this trending
What a big deal, right?
all this means is that she watched a lot of antm back in the day
No one gives a fook
What if her chonis came off ? Lol!
BRUH THEY WERE PLAYING THE BEATLES!
Walk doesn't go with the song, sloppy.
KIM, there are people dying.
Hey guys!! I can balance a spoon on my nose, I bet she can’t do that 😎😎
I died when he zoomed onto the shoes in the corner and the music so depressing
All of the models do it!
Models have been doing this for decades. Karolina Kurkova had it happen live at the Victoria's Secret fashion show in 2005.
Ya.  That's cool\n she very pro.  But... Racists\nShe very beautiful , have 2 big eyes. But. Racists\nShe very talent. But racists
Damn people will shit on gigi no matter what the fuck she does  😓
Boring ! \nNext time Post a video of the bitch falling... or something like that \nThis video was really unnecessary 👎👎👎🙄😒
She is a person.
So?! what other woman who hasn't?
I'm bout to order some hot wings. Like if you eat wings.
My LT in Afghanistan stepped on a mine and blew his foot off. He didn't even bat an eye or make a noise. But this high heel is trending.
i'm just here because i like her tbh
FILM TUBE new Channel Frequency 💋💋❥❥❥👫💘😻💋💋
thanks for sharing her story she's so brave <3
YAAAAS QUEEN SLAAAY! Look at how well she does her job which is merely walking!
OMGGGG!!! the reaction of the crowd to this fiasco.
She didn't let it faze her
Can't believe my video 10 Kittens 1st Day Outside has over 2 million views now! \nGo check it out and hit that subscribe button!  xoxo Sarina 😊 \n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcJk32AJckg
Why is this news?
Ohh look its a representation of the hunger games.People that think this shit is important have to have serious mental issues.we are so fucked
the DJ needs to be fired for that wack music.
Why are they playing LSD.
Why tf is this on trending.
Who else skips all TMZ YT ADS? They deserve no money. If you are on traditional pc use adblock for TMZ. Always downvote every TMZ video
Hey l would appreciate if you followed my account if you are interested in minimalistic and aesthetics fotos💖💖💖❤️@z.e.serin
Okay seriously people? All the hate just because she has a different job. I'm a legitimate physicist (Doing my masters so that counts right? :D ) and I don't think it is necessary to belittle her for doing something that is physically impressive. She made that look real and I for one know I couldn't do that even if I wanted to.
Such a hero...she should get a statue instead of Robert E. Lee.
wow, such talent. What a pro. She walked like she had been doing it most of her life.
Wow this is the dumbest profession I've ever seen.
Now that's a model
*Instead of spending money on these Pointless shows why can't these sponsors use that money to help hurricane hit  people/families.*
The courage this woman has, I'm so inspired.
She has to go to upper class .

People act like she's the only model to ever lose her shoe at a Victorias secret show a few years back a models shoe went through the stage and she walked it off like nothing happened

Losing her shoe made her walk no better soooooooo 🤷🏿
You go Gigi walk it off like a real man! Oh wait..
I must return the slipper to the princess at once. like cindereller.
That's professionalism for yo ass!
YouTube said it was recommended I wanted to know why
Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds!
Baller... that's commitment to the craft!
This has more views than the death toll of ten in Irma video. Holy shit.
Wow the tmz voice guy at the end.... his voice is the impediment of cancer
Who gives a shit about Gigi hadid?
Why is this still trending after so long and barely views
Quick guys let's forget all about the post hurricane carnage by showing this bullshit
That’s cause she is a pro
Ppl lose their homes from hurricanes...and her shoe is important.😤
That was good
Pfff
queens only.
Big fucking deal...
OH THE HUMANITY..........

I should say your lucky to have alodia gve you more strength
Ever since this video was uploaded, this is probably my 15th time watching this. I genuinely love Wil and Alodia ❤ Get well soon WilBorg 🙏
Wil has to spend more time with Alodia and not have someone in the middle. like his Mom because that just prevent both from building a strong relationship. Alodia reminds me of my wife, tho I was a bum she believed in me and supports me not caring about money or anything else until I was able to get our house and start a business.  I was able to get her because I offered her my full undivided attention, understanding (being a good listener is important), my dream and trust. I used to ask my self why she chose me over her handsome suitor and the rich dumb guy always lingering around her. her answers were simple. She did not like the rich guy coz money is liquid and cannot be contained, one mistake he will end up broke or just cheat coz he is used to getting what he wants and only wants me for my looks and status. the handsome guy is ok but looks fade. but you give my life excitement, trust, understanding, always staying beside me and backing me up, true to your words and live by them and my life is meaningful when I am with you. so guys, don't think that looks or riches are the most important thing to get your dream girl. my wife was willing enough to gamble her cozy life for me for one main thing and that is my good Character. Wil do not miss this chance for a girl who is willing to go out of her way to be with you coz those types are hard to come by and I know it's hard to be mature overnight so my only advice and guide for you are to stay the same, listen, be understanding and know that you are not the only person who have feelings, admit mistakes and make up for it, never try to be perfect  and let her love the real you, stay true to your word and always appreciate everything about her. good luck has fun and never give up!.  :)

she honestly does not need that much foundation on my phone it looks really thick too me , shes so beautiful thoug mashallah bas a7la heek natural 😍
for me when i'm blend with a brush it so heavy and patchy on the skin. but highlighter so goood!
thank you for not using the blurring effect it made me feel better about my skin
Oh, my heavens! I loved this! Most fun I've had watching a review since rock of ages was a pebble!
This is my first time on your channel and you're adorable but the up and Down level of your voice is giving me such a headache
 that's not normal 😂
Dina I love you but I feel like as a devoted fan I have the right to criticize -that collar thang is not a look plz girl too much blue 😵
I love you You'er sooo goals 😂i wanna be just like u in the future 😂your'er so pretty and funny😂😂
DAMN RiRi..... Trophy wife ain't nothing to freakin play with 👍🏾☕️
Hi. What brush did you use? I love that it's double ended
LOL I LOVE YOUR LIL HEAD SCARF AND NECK THINGY
Dina you really should've gone in store the next day to get your exact shade, would've saved you money. I'd say go in and exchange the other 210 foundation you bought for your actual shade because let's face it, your face looked orange lol. You're so funny though, your sense of humour makes me laugh a lot 😂
She looked more beautiful without whatever itwas she put on her face
Perfect but the match stick trio highlighter shouldn't have been worn as a concealer. It just looked too shiny but I guess you didn't realise it's more of a highlighter
U want to see a negative review? Watch huda beauty 😂
why the fuck do u wear hijab and then stick your hair out?
I want it all!
Sephora says the foundation turns darker when applied so if your stuck between two shades go lighter it's not really oxidisation just the formula x
This was a great video. You're beautiful
Your new veneers do look very odd in this video.
hey have u had your teeth done? they look alot bigger and brighter kinda like vaneers
The foundation shade was fine, I bet it's Asian lasses commenting on how yellow/dark it is because they love to look extra White lmao. If she wore a foundation matching her tone she would look pasty.
dina what have you done to your teeth? they look different. not bad though. x
can you do a video about: how to protect my hair under hijab ?
NOO!!! she didn't just lick the primer bottle😁😁
I love the way you do your hijab 👌🏼. And you're so funny, love you 😘!
 I DONT NEEDD TO CATCH THE LIGHT ! IT IS CATCHING IT FOR ME!! LOLOL 
has she got her face done?? she looks so different
Tip - for Contour Stick apply product directly onto brush  much easier to blend onto face and use less product!
she's soooo  cute hahaha
You're aweeeeesomely craaazy
almost like she created light LOL, awesome
This video deserves a trophy lmao
you're amazing!
It doesn't look beep beep caked
The beginning🤢
I honestly thought you'd be about my shade, I'm shade 260 😱😂
You're so vulgar.........I fuck with it\nSubscribed 🙌🏻🤓
Haven't seen Dina THIS  exited in a laaaaauuuung time
She made you look like Jennifer Lopez lmbo
Thanks for the informative review and the great laughs!! You crack me up!

Love your eyebrows, where'd of you get them
What brush are you using to apply the foundation and concealer
From where I am sitting it looks too yellow.
So....Dina is no longer a hijabi I see
Can someone count how many times Dina said bruh/bro 😂
Her hair is showing more and more 😂
I still dont get why you're showing your hair
Hunny alot  of your hair is out!!  so why bothering !!!\nI don't see a reason to wear hijab 🙄\n#just_saying!!!
Please avoid doing an American accent! You can't!
Wts the point of wearing hijab then
My sister dina, may god guide you to the right path again  :(

WHAT SHE DONE TO HER TEETHS
Have you done something to your teeth?
I miss her old teeth i feel like it looks a bit too fake! I am talkin Authenticity wise 😞
OK, so on the Marvel one they don't really have it right in terms of the Avengers Initiative being based solely on Iron Man and the whispers of a giant green guy hiding out in Brazil. While not DIRECTLY canon, the Ang Lee Hulk movie is a spiritual successor and the Hulk was involved in issues with the Military and if that were the case, SHEILD would have those files. And in the Avengers they make it very clear that they (SHEILD) knew exactly where he was at all times. Probably accurate to say the same at the beginning of the Hulk with Ed Norton. AND there have been many other enhanced people, so who knew who else was on their radar. SHEILD and Nick Fury left it very open and purposefully vague. \n\nand i need a life.
I am very confused with this episode
That 127 --> I have one too, Se7en segue is not getting nearly the credit it deserves.
Didn't Dan once try to hit on Star?  Why's she taking the time to put them back in order instead of just throwing them out?
Regading the Se7en theory . Decapitating someone is at most a 15 minute afair . you won't have to skip breakfast .
5:03 File that under who gives a ****.
Could y'all do one an episode on eyes wide shut ?  Perhaps all Kubrick movies but mainly on eyes wide shut. Love what y'all do.
Do a Rick and Morty one
yeah the old crew is back!
who's the waitress?
Do I just miss sourcefed or was that Star?
The answer to all your questions; It's just a movie
With te Marvel thing don't forget that Matt and Foggy first met in 2010 but also party crashed together ten years prior to season 2 (2005/06).
Is Friday the 13th really any more ridiculous than most of the other franchise properties we tend to discuss and celebrate?  If the writers were trying to feel out whether or not the viewers have an interest in that kind of property, then HECK YES!
The thing from Se7en bothered me too
I don't think the Avengers we know are the first ones. But the most recent good guy heroes.\nIf SHIELD Heroes are Avengers, then this is already proven.With Captain America The First Avenger and then Hank Pym being in SHIELD. Then Fury wasn't creating the Avengers, but re-creating them.\nAs for everything involving timelines, think of it like this: some people sitting around making things up, then making up more things to justify those things. It's called 'creativity' or 'bullshiting'. It can only work so far.
this was super great
Mmhhmm, a cat-culator - also known as the only tool capable of of preventing a cat-astrophy from o-purring in the first meownth of the year. (Go ahead and slap me)
Wait hold on....in the episode where they talk about scary stories she brings up Jason takes Manhattan, but Daniel has to correct her because she hasn't actual seen it.......wait........ does this add to the messed up timeline
With the mcu time line there is a theory that Nick Fury is a clairvoyant so it would make sense that he knew all about Thor, The Hulk, and the New York attack so that's why he recuited Iron Man before any of that happened.
Wtf is this shit? Lmao \nThis acting corny af! Like watching a group of retards act
Oh god. Thanks be to putting the originals back on. Gooooood job
Fury is not crazy:There were not just reports of The Hulk, the US military fought him and then he fought Abomination downtown. He already had Natasha and Clint on his payroll. All that was missing was Thor.Besides SHIELD probably knew about many others. Even so, the World Council knew about this, which would make them crazy too.
Is no one going to mention the fact that Hawkeye, Black Widow, Ironman, Ant-Man, Technically captain marvel because her movie is set to be in the (90s or 80s), and presumably the hulk, is still an amazingly good team for the avengers initiative.
I'm so glad she brought up the Friday the 13th timeline. I've always tried to pinpoint the years that are supposed to have passed between each film. Also, when she mentions the Evil Dead being part of the shared Universe, it should be noted that a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason was drafted that had Ash from Evil Dead fighting them both.
I thought of the same thing Daniel did and asked the same thing. Fury wants to establish a response team to supernormal threats, but who is on his list? Romanov and Barton? 2 human SHIELD agents? Plus, he didn't even want Stark. He wanted Iron Man. So who is actually part of the Avengers Initiative?
Did you just say that the first Iron Man took place before World War II?
Did they meen army of darkness not evil dead
thank the mighty buddha it's not the other four
ya the A team is back!!!
Wait.\nThe incredible hulk movie enstablished that hulk ALREADY exists in the mcu, is not an origin story.
These are all consecutive nights? I always thought that they were weekly gettogethers.
Friday the 13th < Nightmare on Elm Street
Nothing like the originals!
Wonder how many movie timelines do add up?
Katie is a Friday the 13th fanatic? If I wasn't married I'd be proposing right now
Man...I need to go watch Seven...
you're not supposed to think about these things!!! jeez!
Thank fuck it was the A team, am I right?
i think these all line up perfectly. so therefore. i win
The marvel one isn't valid. Fury new about the existence of Iron Man, Hulk, Ant Man, and potentially Captain America. Its also possible he knew about Black Panther (as seen how Wakanda is a highlighted region on Shield's map in Iron man 2). Apparently, he also new about Captain Marvel, which takes place in the 90s. \n\nThe point is he knew there were other super heroes in the world besides Iron Man and was likely planning to recruit any that he  could to be on the avengers.
never leave again bitches. i almost said goodbye to afterhours
Ya sorry as much as I wish I liked the new crew the original 4 are just so much better
Have y'all got star doing the drawings now?
I have a whole seven page timeline on Friday the 13th.
Katie is a boss. Finally a proper break down of my other favorite Friday film series. Wait what if Debo is Jason??? :O
I should not have laughed so hard at that last cat joke...
Ah, the reason I subscribed. Before the SJW preaching videos appeared and made me wanna puke. Good times.
After Watching: 300 Viewers Who Don't Care
So... are we all cats then?
Please please please oh please just stick with these four
Im pointing out that back in season 2 I would say episode 7 Katie says she has never seen Jason takes Manhattan but now flash forward a few seasons she suddenly knows EVERYTHING about The Jason series like okay it's been a few years about there is no way that she could watch all the Jason movies and enough to connect the dots between two different horror movies and now so much about these films off hand like excuse me no I couldn't tell you what movies I watched 3 years ago hell I couldn't tell you what movies I have watched last year
I feel like I want to pull up a chair at the table and join in!
Not funny at all..complete garbage know thinking animations or jokes
Bleh, the timelines totally add up, but, ok. Not a very funny group of people either. I suppose this channel is just not for me.
This is the first Cracked video I've 'liked' in years.
I'm disappointed that at no point do they mention the Corey Feldman video...
Why Voldemort was secretly Gandalf is a topic I really want to hear...
If Kevin Spacey had a business account with the courier company he could've just arranged on their website for them to come pick the box up from his place. He could've left it behind a pot plant or something. Just sayin. He didn't necessarily have to go in. Would've saved a lot of time.
I hate to say this, but four minutes in, my mind is actually getting dumber from listening to the Friday the 13th 'mythos'.
Starline in the background makes me happy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for someone finally bringing light to the screwed up timeline from Friday The 13Th
DANIEL O'BRIEN STOLE MY IDEA! What he said its exactly what I posted on several videos with the Nick Fury after credits scene a very long while ago, seriusly look it up.\nNot mad at all, actually kind of the opossite, its really bizarre to see my ideas coming out of his mouth, its almost line by line. What an honour...\nJust asking for a shout out!
S.H.I.E.L.D is dealing with super human threats even without Captain America ever since Agent Carter and Howard Star started it. And Hank Pym was around for a long time even after WWII. You failed the Antman movie, After Hours team. The Avengers are just a scouted new superhero generation.
Did you see that katy? I diagreed! Kek.
NO Nick Fury ,, fought off Skrull off before he even meet Tony ,, this alll will be reviled in Captain Marvel  that would be a time based movie set in the pass before Iron man and Hulk and Avengers
If that theory about Gandalf secretly being Voldermort is a real theory, I'd love a video about that
Michael, why/how are you in the audience of the Dave Chappelle Netflix special?
Catculator... that got me way too good
Your Marvel theory lacks X-Men. The Avengers are only separate in the movie universe because of the studio rights. Nick Fury knew there were super dudes and many x-men were avengers in the comics but can't be tied again due to rights. So realistically, just as in Deadpool where other x-men were referenced but not show because they couldn't afford rights for any major characters, there were plenty Superheroes in the world to justify the creation of the Avengers.... just not enough studio cooperation to do so lol
You forgot the best Friday the 13th film- Jason X
I love that Daniel pronounces Voldemort in that annoyingly correct way, instead of how the say it in the movies.
What's in the box?
Best friends are back!!! More funny people please and thank you
the Fast and the Furious has a fuck up timeline it somewhat made since and then the 8 movie came out and blew it to hell. Dom and Elena baby is a few months old that child could not been conceived no later then the beginning scene in Fast 6 FF3 take place after 6 and before 7 and while we don't know how long FF3 happen after 6 but it seem like the movie FF3 was over a few months with the main character Sean and Han had was in Tokyo way longer then that. Now we know the 7th movie take place right after the 3rd movie hell the timeline over lap between the 3rd and the 7th because Hobbs has a fight with Deckard Shaw that how he get the info on Dom team and while he killing Han he called Dom while Dom house explode, but while he having the fight with Hobbs in the beginning you also see Elena in that scene and she is no pregnant and her and Hobbs fall out the window.  That baby should be way older then it is.
You forgot that john doe also had to take the time to carve the skin off his fingertips...
So the 1st episode of After Hours takes place in 2010 cause in the curses episode they showed a clip from the 1st episode with a title revealing it took place 7 Years Earlier. Then they didn't do another one until 2017 cause they been going to that dinner for  79-80 consecutive days, and Katie mentioned the new Friday the 13th game that was released in 2017.
The Friday the 13th timeline math doesn't work. If Tommy Jarvis is 12 in 1984, then he's 17 in 1989. And if Tina Shepard is 7 in 1989, then she's 16 in 1998.\n\nEven if Tina is actually 7 in 1990, then she's 16 only in 1999. Neither 1998 nor 1999 are 2001
actually their marvel theory won't work after the captain marvel movie when her and a young nick fury face the skrull
Captain Marvel is said to happen before Iron Man 1. So he has her. But we gotta wait for her movie to see why she ain't there.
Thumbs up just for the old cast!
uh, Jason isn't 50 or immortal. he's undead from 6 on. I don't think the undead celebrate birthdays.
9:07 There was alot more crap going on then just that. Besides the fact that they were planning ahead, super-powered and freaky things had been going on since WWII. Nothing about inviting Tony to the Avengers was at all reliant on Cap turning up, or Thor existing. And they already knew about Hulk.
Did he just break the 4th wall at the end😲😲😲😲
What's the film after Friday The 13th that they discuss?
Damn the replaced the fine ass dread head in the back
SWAIM!!!!! 😂😂
Cat-culator!
Michael Swaim is my idol
Finally, REAL after hours.
Wait... is that place Poquito Mas?
Cat-culator! Lol
Yay for After Hours!!!
F the cards Dan!
love this team
Star!
Not sponsored by Coca Cola..
BRING BACK DOES NOT COMPUTE!!!!!!!
Katie's hair looks fucking amazing
You need a Cat-culater!
Media trying to make Jim Carrey out to be a psycho, fuck that! The man is spiritually woke and has brought so much laughter, joy and entertainment to millions of people that grew up watching and will grow old watching his work. Fuck off and let the guy live.
Never thought I'd  see that, but he's  right. It's all absolutely meaningless.  \n\nYou go Jimbo.  That rhymed.
He sayed that he is an icon on the right foot. Meaning that hes goofing around because hes bored of an interwiev. He is not crazzy. Hes smart
Jim put it out there.Of course they r gonna say he is crazy and he has lost it and they will blackball him.Actually that had already started.
Fire Marshall Bill keeping it real
He is speaking from nonduality
Sounds like Jim is a fan of the matrix theory.
I want to find the most meaningless thing that i can find and come to, and join. And here i am. \nthis line crack me up lol
I feel sorry for him cause he's telling the absolute truth and no one acc saying anything about it
With all the shit going on in the world right now, I don't blame him for not seeing a point to anything. And that reporter pisses me off so much
now there's a man the world should learn from
He is expressing the mindframe of an athiest. Without God there is no purpose to him or anything.
Why she's dressed like a hoe?
This woman seems like a cunt
One hell of an honest person
Maybe he's got cancer...
it's just LA people flirting and being fabulous. You could claim Carrey is an MK Ultra Drone going through some type of battery recharge or just a celeb saying goofy stuff to get attention. You choose the bottle. You pick your poison. You drink from the pop culture cup. Repeat.
Ever since he became antivaxxer he has been a target, like Deniro, Rob Schneider, Jenny McCarthy, Kelly Preston, etc! He is awake!!
Didn't Jim's significant other (I don't know what to call her) die recently? I hope he keeps his EYES WIDE OPEN.
omg this man is woke af holy crap, i wonder what is on his mind right now
They are about to take Jim Carrey out
He's not off, she was being a dick.
LOL he tried to play a skit on her she didnt catch on, shmart!
Reporter acting like life is all about fashion and showing off to what you stand for by dressing yourself up. Reporter should time travel back to the stone ages, classical ages, the medieval ages, and the 16-19th century and interview all the most famous caveman/people and their extravagant display of feathers. Then come back and tell me with a straight face that we're not repeating this meaningless part of history over and over again like like a bunch of insane people without anything better to do in life.
that fucking tango double spin he did was hilarious & graceful at the same time 😭😭
True, fashion week = completely meaningless. But he's just read a bit too much Eckhart Tolle
It is staged, both of them are playing a great role here. It is not spontaneous trust me. I would love to see it was real but sadly it is not people....
Sounds ON! forever a hero
i knew that he is a bit...but,.. wow!
Sad thing this is so true. We focus on stupid shit.
Now I dunno about anyone else but I don't think any of this matters or is even real
Jim Carey can see binary code now. He knows we are in a simulation.
Why are a bunch of retards claiming that this brilliant man is w o k e????? I have not even had a proper English language education , but I am pretty sure It is AWAKE...
Who is the reporter lol
Aggghhh he's just trying to be relevant. Apart from the 1st pet detective which was ssssssssmmmmoking (sorry wrong movie) he's fairly irrelevant. No?
This is what mental illness looks like.
I LOVE THIS MAN
Jimmy don't give a FOOK
literally a dumb bitch who can't think outside of what she's told to think
Uhmm is this a precursor for another, He was my favorite actor, why didn't we see the signs???
She did fine. Jim was rude AF. He knows her job and made it awkward as fuck and spit nonsense. He contradicts most things he says just by the roles he takes. SMD
Fashion week probably is truly the most egotistical, narcisitic,  materialistic, gathering of a bunch of people who get wealthy by others watching them, showing off their glam to those who still watch them. Ive no idea who is appealed by fashion week other than clothing designers and other celebritys. Even the backwall for his interview is nothing but advertisements from companys at which you need a moderate amount of money to purchase. What normal person is truly intrigued by what celebritys wear? Not trying to be mean or make fun of anyone who enjoys fashion week but seriously think about it for a while what your accually watching. Thank you jim carrey for bringing realness and exposing fashion week for the muck of sickening egotism that it is.
Wow Jim is getting old
This is absolute magic.
She said Is it true you're wandering the streets you need a date...  jim lost his girlfriend how could she say those things. He has every right to trolling this interview.
Guys, honest question: What do you think he meant by saying it's not OUR world and that we don't matter at the end? Please! I'm dying to hear some opinions and thoughts!
What episode of Rick and Morty is this?
I understand him. An ageing man realise after mid-life crisis that after 10 years of denying of mortality, he is really going to age and die, and it can happen any day now. Cancer, heart attack, stroke or whatever else.\nYou can be rich, famous or in power, it doesn't matter. You die and no one gives shit about it when it happens. If you are lucky and famous enough then you have your tribute news around the globe which gives people to talk about it for 10 minutes at family's dinner or at coffee break at their work place. And yes it scares lots of us. The meaningless of the life after all, doesn't matter what you did, what you are, how many children you had. You disappear and people, even your family can get over it by time without a problem.
First, she makes the mistake of trying to be funny with this comic genius. Then she has the audacity to act as if SHE was the sane one.
Hahaha. How quickly did she regret talking to him?
The most real I have seen him since the early days at the Comedy Store.
Her faces is making her look so unprofessional.
From the beginning he is not with her bullshit lol. She wants to walk behind him and he like bitch what
I think Jim is great. He is deep and she is superficial. She doesn't get him, but we do!! 😁
Presenter had no clue to end interview professionally. Fire her
good man Jim one of the many awakened.
He grew up as a poet, artist, and comedian. Then did all genres of movies, don't fuck with that man. He is THE MindFucker
I! Love! This! Man! Come back Jim Carrey. My tetrahedron's and electrons need the comfort of your squishy-face-charm.
Harry, I took care of it.
I could fill my gas tank by wringing out her pillow
Although she's dumb as fuck, I would do her!
He's just the fuckin best.
Sounds like Clinton's going to pay him a visit before he says too much.
looks like ole jim has been doing a little too much ayahuasca
She is not a good interviewer. Her first question was Is it true you are wondering in the streets and Do you need a date to the party? Really!!...He is dealing with  depression becase his girfriend died. Of course he will react and treat you like that. Wrong way to approach someone. Also, her questions and her expressions are not proffesional. Just saying
Jim Carrey sounds like a 17 year old undergraduate student that just discovered existentialism and that he's suddenly so much deeper than anyone else and that his words are so profound. Give me a fucking break.  Shouldn't he be somewhere pushing another young woman to committing suicide?  All of the sudden he's an artist and a profound thinker?? Get the fuck outta here.
Everyone idiot. I am idiot. Even God is idiot.\nGurdjieff.
I love Jim Carrey haha. I hope he's legit going crazy
The demons are leaving his body lets hope they leave soon
He's not really exposing anything lol, it's just common knowledge that hopefully people can learn to understand in their own life.
His suite is fucking amazing. Last statement is the best in my opinion hes so right
He's not off. He's right on.\nI love you Jim.
Poor girl doesn't know how to roll with unconventional answers, the avant-garde. I doubt she'll be doing too many more of these if she is incapable of not making stupid asf faces into the camera when she is confused by genius in her presence.
Well... To normal sheep they might just say: Guess Jim Carrey finannly lost is mind after so many roles of playing crazy people\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut we know whats up... we know.... we just have to stop being afraid
Me after I take one psychology class
Maybe we are living in a simulation
That's what you get for bothering Jim Carrey
Yer a good man Jim, you see through nonsense, but eat some good grub. Love ya Brother!
why the fuck she all up in her feelings
Fuckin savage
Stops video to Google tetrahedrons
Tetrahedrons indeed. Listen
My Jimmy Boi Is Woke AF 👍
Jim Carrey Sage mode
Legend
#WOKE 🙏
HE TOOOO DAM WOKE
same jim
This is fucking briliant
We are Awake.
Interview with a Nihilist NYFW 2017
truly-open-minded-m8
Definitely high...
Jim Carey WOKE!
YOU GO CARREY!!!!!
Fuck her interviewing skills
**douche chills**
That mullet tho..
Jim Przechuj Carrey ;-)
Mas bien parece que estuviera decepcionado con esta sociedad...
To see more of Aaron Carter's interview, visit http://bit.ly/2h1UADj.
Omg i hope he gets better
I'm glad he's being open and honest with everyone and himself about what's going on. He's a brave man.
hang in there, Aaron...keep reaching out for help, cuz we want you well <3
i still love you aaron
All I gotta say is that we need more celebs like him how much I can admit to say that he's probably on my next list on looking him up more often expected
He's fake.  There's always an excuse. He's addicted to pain pills. Point blank period. He's an entertainer and everything out of his mouth is for popularity. He lies about his sexuality to put him out there in the limelight.  He lied when he said he had battled this his white life.  He wasn't like this before, he wasn't a stick figure.  It's so sad that this has happened to him but he needs to go to rehab.  There's a reason why his family wants nothing to do with him.  He's an addict, I have a family member who is also addicted to pain pills. It's rough.
This is heartbreaking...I hope he gets all the help he needs and makes a full recovery..
the guy is clearly still in the 'lime life' life style he says all the right things but its like... PR PR PR kinda things, hope he gets better. God Bless him
Many people go through this. The greatest battle we have is within ourselves. Having a strong connection to Allah, will help alot.
well for those who say he does drugs he admitted it right there that he will go and obtain these prescription pills off the street. so yes he does legal drugs in an illegal way and needs help. Many people have been there
He's an addict and doesn't have a solution other than the medication his doctors give him to make money.
HE IS ADDICTED TO PENISES
What the heck did Travis put in his face?  He looks like a 40 year old woman!!!
He's a full on junkie.
I really hope he ends up going to rehab. it's so scary.
Lol this loser is high right now off of Oxy.
he's not on a good path...i don't think this show is at all going to help him change. he seems like he's going on a downward spiral
isn't that the book Kevin gave to Nick?
I wish his problem was the pills but it's not. The pills don't make you skinny. He's doing heroin and if he wants to get clean from heroin he needs 1 or 2 years in rehab.Real rehab  not the expensive resorts in L.A. that want to call themselves rehab centers.
If you ever knew a junkie than you know 100% if his lips are moving he's lying. I wish him the best.
Seems as though anyone hanging out with Michael Jackson as a kid or tween, always end up fucked up. Aaron Carter, Mukauley Kulken, Corey Feldman.... I think there might be a link...
This dude needs actual rehab not a TV show. He's just playing to the audience and reading some of these comments people are actually believing this bull. The way he cuts them off to praise them for helping him is such an addict move. He knows what to say and do to pretend to get help shy of actually doing it. Keep patting him on the back for nothing and he'll OD
Aaron Carter man up. Sorry for you but your not ready to help your self.
Why are doctors always so damn self righteous when it comes to prescription drugs for anxiety and depression? These drugs were created for a reason! They actually help people! Some people will always have chronic anxiety and depression just as someone who has chronic backpain or arthritis. Give them the drugs they need or shut the fuck up!
Thanks! (I WILL)! ...
he looks like a fucking meth dealer
He's an addict telling people what they want to hear, pure and simple, he may not be addicted to cocaine or meth, but he is addicted to benzos, and to be honest,  he needs to come out of the closet fully, i bet thats the reason this is going on.
Unfortunately he didn't disclose that he's addicted to Whip-it's (Duster Aersol Cans)
Man if y'all don't give my mans some of that blue dream and let him chill while off the pack he'll be alright
not to interupt you ???? LOL yeah ok
He's so mentally ill, it baffles me how he has not been committed yet. I don't believe a word that leaves his mouth he is so delusional , child stardom ruins you . \nI would be surprised if this guy makes it to his 40th birthday
Oxy is an appetite suppressant.
Ah fuck off.   He's such a clown
he went to an amusement park with Micheal Jackson at age 13? you can't write this stuff
Please pray for him everyone! It's Satan that is trying to make him crazy and he is under spiritual warfare.
Man white people like to cry about stupid stuff
Smoke a bell SIMPLE
Smoke a blunt
*Hes lying about sept 11*
To this day, I still dream about Sydney Fish Market and am so excited to go back! (beware those darn ibises though.. Aussies know what I'm talking about) Stay tuned for parts 2 & 3 of Worth It Oz - what country should we visit next? \n\n#BuzzFeedWorthIt
leave a like for adam:)
Does anyone here still not get what Andrew meant by 'pelic-in'.
andrew's hair keeps falling off :( please don't!! he will be bold in 3years T..T
Andrew says Brisbane and Melbourne wrong.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the next time you'll see us we'll be....BALD!!!!
I only come here for Adam.
The Camara man is so funny
Adam is cute. Adam is adorable. Be like Adam. He's also kind of hot.
PLEASE WATCH MY VIDEOS . ILL BE CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST SOON AND WOULD APPRECIATE SOME SUB SCRIBERS
Love raw oysters, but you need lemon, garlic, and cocktail sauce. Had some gigantic ones in New Orleans. They were basically life altering.
YKNOW WHAT REALLY RATTLES MY ROLLS? AMERICAN PRONUNCIATION OF MELBOURNE. ITS FREAKIN PRONOUNCED MEL-BIN NOT MEL-BORN!!!!! \n\nbut thanks for visiting, hope you enjoyed your time here :)
*crying bcs i was at sydney last month*
U guys r so close to Indonesia... Why don't you try to visit Indonesia, we have lots of tasty and unique food (:
Come Singapore and try our chicken rice at different price point!
I love this, although I kinda wish they'd just gone to a local shop and got some fish and chips
Where can I buy the Adam tshirt?
Australia has the best seafood in the world
I liked the video cause he called the oysters snot rocks
Thanks for coming to my country and my city of Melbourne, worlds most liveable city. I hope you liked it
Im wondering if theres an episode where you just hated the food or were totally grossed out??
I love seeing Andrew and Steven's relationship blossom!
Adam''s lack of reactions or emotion is truly what makes these great.
I bloody live there and I didn't even notice that they were literally less than 10km away :,(
your handsome come see me
Everytime they said Melbourne wrong, i cringed a little.
Out of the whole of Sydney you picked to go the fish markets seriously. But the other places are pretty decent.
Why don't you guys give us some? You guys are soo shellfish
Trying wine eh? you guys better try the JAPANESE WHISKEY
Nice to see they let Adam off the leash at the end to roam around a while :)
I like their photo at the end of their videos
As an Australian this made me so excited xD
THEY WERE IN MELBOURNE!!!!! THEY WERE IN MY CITY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That scuba diver part was pretty funny his face  was priceless lol
Snot rods. I couldn't say it better.
Please come to Singapore!!!
LIVE!!! What the hell...
I always laugh when Americans try to pronounce Brisbane and Melbourne...they end in the bin sound if you're Aussie!
THATS FOR ADAM\nWE CAN GET HIM HIS OWN lmao oh my god
The way they pronounce Melbourne is so annoying
Listening to you guys try and pronounce Melbourne is honestly so funny😂
I love seafood, I wish I could travel to Australia and eat a whole bunch of seafood!
i eat albalone all th time during lunar new year \ni love it and the inside of the shell is SO PRETTY
Do a worth it episode on chicken 😍😍👌
You guys should take atripnto Jamaica  and try food there
Am I the only one hysterically laughing at Andrew's scuba diver description?! 😂
I've had seafood from the east coast of the state, I've had seafood from Hawaii, I've had seafood from Malaysia, and I've had seafood from Singapore. THE best seafood I've had was from Australia.
every time they pronounce melbourne I giggle a bit? sounds a bit like mel-burn, whereas most aussies pronounce it mel-ben?
DO A EPISODE ABOUT THE BEST CHICKEN FRIED STEAK
Y'all should try Seattle and Bay Area seafood 😋
OMG If you can add subs why the heck you never make subs fork Steven?!
No animal was hurt during the making of this episode.
no lemon ? no salt ? no hot sauce? do you not season your steak ?
And btw we do not say g'day mate just mate sometimes
It's kind of cruel to cut the poor thing in half and it still be alive while you season it. Read Wallace's Consider the Lobster and if you have any moral sense about you you're option will change a little on how seafood is cooked.
do WORTH IT marijuanna edition
YESSSS MELBOURNE 😂 Australia welcomes you to our food🍤🦐❤️
Key to eating oysters is to put hot sauce n Lemon juice you'll fall in love
New Zealand. The Bluff oyster is the most sought after in the world.
You guys went to wrong country for seafood.  My best lobster pasta was in Nettuno Italy and I think we paid only just over 100 Euros for our dinner for two.
GOD ..Steven looks like an angel
Oysters, clams and cockles!
UP THE BOYZZZ!!!!! #straya
Come to Brisbane!
Abalone is legally expensive.
the ending. tho ahahahwine
Shoutout to nature

7 : 12 - 7: 18 \n  UNFRIENDED
yall don't need anymore gold-embellished food for this series because just seeing adam's reaction while he eats is pure gold 😂
Aussies make some noise
This is triggering me a little bit, nobody pronounces it Mel-boorn
Do a fried chicken worth it and bring Keith in!!
I like how Adam has a bigger part now.
These get me so jealous
Go to Italy w Mario Batali. He already offered to take u guys!
I hate it when the animal is alive and they kill it
I really wish foreigners would learn how to at least, and I mean this, at the very least learn to pronounce our city names. Especially Melbourne ffs, it's so easy!
Why are your fat heads STILL presenting? Please pass the torch to better talent. No longer entertained my you 2. Camera operator is more fun and cooler.
Y'all to sensitive😭😂
Adam is still the best part. I mean I love them all but Adam is so understated and precious
Cameraman Adam should host one of your episodes!!!!
You can't.. eat different seafood.. if you're gonna do a different price seafood. Like I hate lobster, but I love crab
Finally \nI requested this
Why did you go to Australia to eat Chinese food?
Never actually confirmed or denied anything,,,, I wonder why .....
Sarah Sanders is one classy woman. If I were in her shoes, I'd tear these propagandist a new one, ever single day. I'd come to the podium with stats against their reporting, their networks, their failing railings, their full politi-fact write up, and a record of their continual obsession with false narratives.\n\nEvery sensible person out there who opposed the former president probably wishes they were more vocal about their distain, when they chose to remain respectfully silent (many for the fear of being labeled a racist).\n\nHowever, this past election sounded off to the effect of a nuclear bomb, and somehow, these morons stand around in embarrassment, pretending like they never heard it. That's ok, keep it up! Please, do continue to double down on this failing propaganda tactic...I mean, wonderfully true and reasonable line of logic; I'm sure everyone around the globe agrees.

Dear YouTube: Please stop suggesting stuff from Fox News to me. I think you should check to see if right-wing nutjobs have hacked your stuff.
That's a woman lol she looka like aman
looking at them ghost skin disease people mad lol
My comment would be,  you can't fix stupidity, especially when poor people are offered a million to be stupid
I thought this administration was a big defender of freedom of speech?  I thought it was only liberals hurt by offensive remarks?  I thought conservatives hate PC culture?\n\nApparently the right is just a bunch of babies who are happy to point out when the left overreacts, but also hate when people point out that they overreact.\n\nI'm sick of all the hypocrisy

This is America world, please read the comments, hypocrisy at its best. The land of the free and the home of the brave🤔. Freedom of speech🤔.
These people see racism everywhere. Nobody but the progdroids listen to them anymore. Very sad.
OMG! Imgine if Jamele had falsely claimed Trump was not born in the U.S!!!
a question that hasn't come out yet.  When did racism or being racist ever become solely and diversely linked to only African American ridicule?  Isn't racism everywhere or better yet, isn't racism conveyed both ways?  Maybe the white majority is too obvious but there a just as many other cultures that frequently hate on another group fueled by international and/or domestic history.  ...
Put your hand upon my hip...when I (Sergio) Dipp you Dipp we Dipp
She is ignorant and was NOT raised properly!  - THAT much is obvious!! She has even spoken about her AWFUL relationship with her mother and Lord knows where her daddy was.
The world is in turmoil and people are losing their lives left and right but I'm a little shithead who only cares about my ratings so I'm asking stupid questions.
I don't like Jemele Hill. I find her frankly annoying. But asking someone to get fired because of a statement is just stupid.
media instigating a race war again
The Huckabee gene is STRONG! Mongoloid-like and STRONG.
You want to hear more outrageous crap? Look up Sarah's father.
Honestly she's right this time.
If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck.
She got the peoples eyebrow down to the T. The rock would be proud.
In my Katt Williams voice what the fuck is a Huckabee?!😣
The huckabee family protects child molesters and dog killers. Look it up.
Well so what's the problem? Trump is really a racist, and have a lot of racist friends and supporter's. If you support him you may be a racist or a racist sympathizer.
Wow there's so many people in the comments saying she's so ugly and black  isn't there a word for judge a person solely for their appearance or skin color ... O yeah Progressive
This bitch eyes bothers me. Is one offset from the other? Is it a lazy eye? Too much makeup?
This broad needs to get laid
When will she stop with all the lying?
Why is she so Fat. She looks like that muppets pig
It's only going to get worse. Blacks want everything given to them and get upset when they aren't treated like kangz. Whites need to have each others back and get over any differences they may have. Whites need to stop worrying about being called a racist as it's a hollow attack. Whites need to forget about white guilt - whites built this nation and have given more to minorities than any other race. These people don't want peace, they want everything and they want whites to suffer. Organize. Share the truth and fight back! Be proud of who you are. Get active creating the change you want to see.
She acts as if she doesn't even wanna be there like leave bitch if you don't wanna do your job. Such a cunt.
Lets not forget espn fired rob parker for calling robert griffin a cornball seems to me espb are double standard company
Jemele Hill has been part of what... 3-4 canceled shows?
White peoples response to blacks 10 demands ... FUCK YOU LAZY leech ... X 10
Lol...she has the same look on her face that Spicer had, just before HE GOT LET GO. HA HA
STOP these outrageous and utterly false liberal statements. The left's abject hatred is dividing the country and causing irreparable harm.
She's a cunt
Oh look, Trump supporters asking why a video is trending in the comment section again ._. 110k views so far, still not sure why it’s trending
If I asked one in a hundred people who watch Jemele hills show I'm sure it would either be 0 to 1 people
nobody even knew who she was, until now. ESPN messed up!
All the make up in the world . Still lopsided
Why is this being made important?!
why her eyebrows look like they are trying to fly away
Wow ESPN is now a valid source for politics, the guy had to make sure he mentioned African American. Identity politics at it's finest
The Russians now he is a white supremacist soon it will be he is a reincarnated hitler robot alien \nLol wtf
One mental weakness conservatives have is that they believe there is a giant invisible man in the sky.
No offense, but was she born a man?
I wonder how bad spicer would have fumbled that, she did pretty bad already.
Sarah are you a white supremacist?
oh the irony that you saying that this is a fireable offense is in fact a fireable offense
Knowi that Trump being a white supremacist is a matter of not being asleep for the last 70 years.
She's hard to look at.
Influential African American figures?  Influential?  Nobody working for ESPN is influential anymore.  Nobody.
Who is Jemima Hill? Does she make pancakes at the plantation kitchen, or just another braindead ape.
They ESPN needs to bring back Curt Schilling #doublestandards
Demon-Rats have been controlling minorities for 100 years but when Republican Abe Lincoln defeated them they Adapted from Physical Enslavement to Mental & Fake News CNN & Company is helping them Remember LBJ : I'll have those N*****s Voting Democrat for the next 200 years.
Pretty soon they're going to start calling M&Ms racist
Why does the news  reporter in the crowd keep saying influential ?
Why is this on trending no one cares
Whaittt powaaaa!!!
Black Privilege
she just told that dumbass
subcribe to my channel
Sarah Huckabee should be fired.
This admin sucks ass
What a dumb bitch
Trump is a white supremecist
White Trash Cunt House.
dump her like spicer. shes a fucking cunt
SNOWFLAKE. LOL! Triggered ugly bitch.
Liberals Snowflakes ❄️ are TRIGGERED.
Fuck this dumb Bitch and trump
Jemele hill is trash
Jemele Hill is a racist
Sarah owned this stupid MSM fool!
Jamele is a black supremacist
Who the f*ck is Jemele whatever?  Trump making another person famous. She sounds like a black racist.
Some of you are acting sick. This is a human being you're calling names and demeaning. You can disagree with her, disagree with the people she represents, but at the end of the day, we're all human beings with unique thoughts and opinions. And how long is it gonna take before we understand that again?
I don't watch ESPN anymore because since when is a sports network political TALK ABOUT SPORTS THATS WHAT YOUR THERE FOR like how stupid is ESPN they recently fired a guy for having the last name lee and it was apparently bad bc there was a confederate Robert E lee who was white and the lee on ESPN who was fired was Asian like he should sue ESPN for discrimination over a fucking last name he had no power in picking this is why America is so apart it's bc the liberals purposely do it and then blame us educated people and trump which btw isn't a racist all people who think he is need to get their heads out of there ass bc everything that the liberals use saying he is a racist is so out of context and misleading
Say what you will but shes an excellent press secretary
Jamel hill is a racist no talent hack.
ONLY TROLLS, BELOW, ARE ON  THIS COMMENT PAGE.
I wish she would have just said how about espn sucks our fucking dicks, they are lying scum.
I love how he said the ESPN sportscaster was respected lmao. She was given her latest position because of race and to try to be overly diverse instead of hiring upon talent. She's a low life scum just like the other liberal cry baby's
Is it any wonder why ESPN's ratings are failing? FOX and NBC sports channels are quickly closing the gap.
Search donald trump jesse jackson to see what a racist white supremacist he is.
How does anyone think Trump is competent?
All these snowflakes are triggered by a black woman speaking the truth. Do you all need a safe space? I thought you guys hated PC culture, she's not being PC here. \n\nAlso what she says is facts. I don't necessarily think that Trump is a white supremacist, but the ignorant idiot did in fact surround himself with white supremacist;  Bannon, Gorka, Miller. Being a white nationalist is just a synonym for white supremacist. Wake up and smell the coffee, snowflakes.
Fuck you, youtube!
https://www.gofundme.com/4esiwu8
Espn is disgusting
Look at her lipstick on her lips obvious lmao
*YOU'RE FIRED*
Boycott ESPN
Trump and trump supporters are offended. Fuckinng SNOWFLAKES
TRUMP 2017 MURICAAAA

지금 까지 여친노래 다믹스해논건가?
확실히 컴백을 빨리해서 그런지 안무가 기존곡들보다는 덜 힘들어보이네요..그래도 몸관리 잘하세요ㅠㅠ팬들입장에선 컴백보다 건강이 더 소중해요
저 여자친구 신비 팬인데...  요즘  신비가 샌터를 잘 안 스네요ㅠ
타팬인데 쏘스 뮤직 여자친구분들 컴백 너무 자주 시키네요 무리해서 사고 발생하는 일 없었으면
여름이 지난지가 언젠데ㅠㅠ\n계절이 맞지않아ㅠㅠㅜ
좋은 뮤직.   에너지가  좀 부족한 게 아쉬움. 요즘 kpop에는 어두움이 숨어있음.   현재 한국 상황 반영??
C'mon buddy Summer Rain will be promotes only 2 weeks, help GFRIEND to win please 😭 stream stream...
Now that I think about it, i think summer rain sounds similar to love whisper because it has a similar melody but its in minor key..?

IT SOUND LIKE LOVE WHISPER 😂
Duh,. baca komen kebanyakan komplain krn lagu 'summer rain' mirip dg lagu love whisper, rough, bla.. bla.. bla..\n\nhello..Lagu gfriend ciri khas nya ya kayak gini. klo lo buddy lo pasti tau, justru lagu2 kayak gini yg bikin buddy bangga akan adanya  gfriend.  Gw sendiri jatuh cinta ama lagu2 gfriend krn easy listening, musical yg oke, vocal yg so talented, koreo yg keren&unik. Dan yang terpenting ga bikin telinga gw sakit.. 😁\n\nSemua lagu kpop punya ciri khas masing2. No problem juga klo  gfriend lagu nya gitu2 aja (menurut gw malah komposer lagu2 gfriend keren banget.. super talented malah. Hampir smua genre Pop Rock, R&B, classic, Ballad dimainin). \n\nYa ini lah ciri khas mereka. klo lo ngaku2 buddy tapi ga mendukung lagu2 mereka, ya ga usahlah jadi buddy. \n\nTtg mereka comeback terlalu cepat setelah comeback sebelumnya, atau ttg award yg mereka dapet ga sebanyak di thn sebelumnya krn alasan lagu ga bagus atau bla.. bla.. bla.., gw rasa soumu dan member gfriend ga terlalu mikirin hal itu.\nYang terpenting buat mereka, mereka berusaha menyuguhkan para penikmat musik dg lagu -lagu, vocal dan koreo yg indah, unik dan elegan. Award bagi mereka itu semacem bonus atas perjuangan dan kerja keras mereka. \n\nDan coba lo dengerin lagu summer rain dan kalo emang ga ngerti bahasa korea, ada translate english nya. lo pahamin kata2nya.. Member Gfriend bilang klo liriknya juga pesen tersirat buat para buddy dari mereka.. (jangan nangis klo abis lo pahamin lirik nya, krn gw abis pahamin liriknya langsung nyesssss... ).\n\nSummer rain masih 1 album repackage dg love whisper di album parallel. jadi mirip2 dikit ya wajarlah. Di lagu mereka itu juga ada kisah/teori, bukan asal bikin lagu dan nyanyi2 doank.. \n\nini teori yg gw dapet dari lagu2 mereka di album sebelumnya:\n\n1. glass bead (kisah perjuangan awal debut mereka, awal masuk high school dan awal persahabatan mereka)\n\n2. Me Gustas Tu (kisah persahabatan mereka di tahun ke 2 high school)\n\n3. Rough (kisah saat mereka di tahun ke 3 high school dan kesedihan yg mereka rasain saat kelulusan krn mereka sadar akan berpisah dan ga bisa lupain kenangan2 saat mereka masih sekolah).\n\nnext.. kayanya di summer rain ini cerita ttg  mereka udh terpisah jauh masing2, kangen2an, tapi sulit utk ketemu..makanya mereka sedih bgt. tapi masih penasaran sangkut paut antara lagu navillera-fingertip-love whisper. \n\nok buddy.. smart buddy always support gfriend, no matter what happened and keep spread the love to everyone, like they did.. 💜
수련회갔다 이제 왔다......여름비 노래 넘 좋음..
주간아이돌 나오기 위해 발표한 노래 ㅎㅎ 농담이고 신카이 마코토 느낌이 물씬 나네
Son tan lindas, cuanto talento son geniales, las mejores :)
Omg are you guys even here???! what are you doing buddy? running away?
3,629,126 ❤ come on buddies keep streaming for gfriend 💕 once here trying to help as much as once can.
*Vote Summer Rain on M! COUNTDOWN*\nGo to mwave.interest.me/mcountdown/vote/PreVote
OMG, REALLY DISSAPOINT OF WHAT I'VE WATCHED😔😣 Gfriend released a new song SUMMER RAIN which is really same to their last comeback LOVE WHISPER. This song is really same to Love Whisper, that's why this song not too hot😭😤🔥
이거귀를기우리면이랑비슷함
From the lyrics we can say that summer rain is the continuation from love whisper, indeed soumu.\nNo need to complain about the same melody/ beat of the 2 songs. How do you think they made it so obvious even for us non music experts? Because they want us to notice the continuous story,which is not finished yet.
as g-amigas nunca decepcionam
DAMN THE VIEWS STUCK AGAIN
Biasa aja MVnya . Pantesan Viewnya Makin Merosot, Eh🙊
the university of ... they're here...
Noooooo ! I want last week to be forever. I just started watching these :(  cruel.
No, Jesus found you
Cool now we have a preview of The Complete History of Me (3/3)
do the podcast and then maybe keep doing last week sketches??
Podcasting would be great but i feel as if monthly vlogging would be better but with more effort. i like both really but your content is your content. you can do what you want
how did you get that teddy bear? and why is it in almost every episode of eddsworld
I really enjoy the vlogs so I'd be happy with a monthly vlog or something similar 😊
Just do some funny sketches
I would enjoy a last week podcast.
Twas preeetty gud. On a side note i think squidge may like elliot more than you
8:32 there is a man drinking directly from the bottle not giving a shut while Tom is walking
Tom we still have ice cream tacos in the US. I feel like you've missed a lot of opportunities for that
hey tom i like ur stuff and everytime im sad i watch ur stuff\n\njus wanted u to know this\n\nok bye
8:50\n\nI need that shirt.\n\nWhere can I get it?! I need that shirt!!!
holy shit you should so  a sitcom!!!
Definitely a podcast anyway, its pretty much the perfect thing to fill the void and (depending on how you do it, for example audio only) that would fix that subsection of the comments that obsess over your weight. \n\nIf you wanted to do something scripted you could even just release the weekly sketches from reddit on occasion. It could even solidify this channel as the personal with the fans one, in a way, and it would be super entertaining as it's own thing too
Last week...TOM WENT SWIMMING AND MADE GOAT NOISES THE END
every month you could release a vlog for the month. except each day only has one minute. could be in the style of 8:27 to 8:38 sometimes\n\nedit: and 13:42 to 13:58
And where did you found him?????
They call him Matthew Christ 8:05
Holy shit I am the exact same build as Tomska 😂😂
4:20... Fav moment... and Fav Time Card... (I Rounded it Down to make this comment funny... My *Actual* Fav moment is at closer to 4:21)
I'd love a podcast, just dont have a completely scripted one.  Just talk about whatever you guys like, same as in the vlogs
Why don't you have weekly videos of you opening mail and the submitted sketches, you can spend way more time on it
Wow. Someone who hates Jesus more than Jehovah's Witnesses do
Are your parents back together?
I'm really sorry about this but you use to be so skinny man...
Just do Last Week. You lazy ************* ;)
I'm sick of watching and listening to privileged cunts
this is my first time watching your videos, you come across as like a really nice down to earth guy. I kinda like these simple/quick kinda vlogs
Originally, I was on board with the podcast idea, but, after reflecting on what I personally like about Last Week, I found that I most enjoy the quick succession of entertaining cuts to random events or comments that happen throughout the day. A podcast would have its moments, but I feel that the entertainment value of the visual jokes and the (probably previously-thought-out) cuts to Tom & Co.'s random quips every now and then give Last Week a unique, funny feel, that I don't personally find in many other vlog series, wouldn't be there in a podcast. Personally, I think, as a replacement for Last Week, you should do a bi-weekly or monthly vlog series. I don't want to lose that feel I get from this series or the excitement I have when I see a new upload that just won't be present with a static, talky podcast.\n\nI commend you for making it to the end of this wall of text, and I hope others agree with me. Thanks, Tom, (& friends) for making a super entertaining, awesome series that is definitely one of the highlights of my week.
Tbh, I would love to see more you improving skits in public
13:20 When two of my 'soul type' get together it pretty much is a simplified enactment of weirdmageddon, were it is just a feed back loop of weirdness and slightly creepy laughter that takes over any space its in and it just becomes a cacophony of the unusual, and unstable.
podcast is fun, but you need to have guests to come on, like charlie or sammy. cause I watch this to see how your week was and I love the cameos of your friends.
Is ave maria just the theme song of Italy or something?
Go to Romania it's a good country
i would be super interested in a pms!
Please dont end last week i super enjoy it and love it
Winner Tacos were my favourite growing up too! People always thought I was insane when I described it amd kept on claiming that I was just misremembering Maxibons.
I want spammers to reply to this so that I can report them easier.
Tom! You look identical my maths teacher and my maths teacher is even named Thomas.
I like podcasts, but it's gonna be a lot different regardless of what you do, gonna miss seeing all these people every week.
I really enjoy vlogs so itd b cool to have a monthly one
Dats vewy nice\nTitle: Last Week #76: Dive Stunt Kills Tom (Not Clickbait) a.k.a. Last Week The Ridgewells goes to Italy featuring Charlie Belle Shaw
Well that mantis is dead now
Genuine idea: the seven adventures of Squidge the puggo.... One every week or 2 where Tom takes Squidge out for an adventure
hay tom, just thought id tell you about a product called Klondike choco taco.
Tom is the epitome of lovable\n manchild
it would be nice if you could still somehow incorporate the user submitted sketches for your next show
13:37 all is so artsy then... guy hits a tree
nooooooooooooo not the end of lastweek
2:10 Are you a goat?! 0-0 XD
I like the idea of a no script (lightly scripted) podcast! Make the Last - 'Last Week' go out with a bang!
I can tell by the thumbnail and title you are drunk no hate!!! Your cool
I reckon team up with Dan and the rest of the lincoln lads and bring back the man time podcast
when he says he went to every European country\n\n\n\n\n*F I N L A N D?*
I like your scripted stuff more so do dat
lol i live 20 mins away from pisa's airport
I like the idea of a podcast
This video is brilliant for the Owen Wilson impression alone
I think you should just start uploading compilations of tom at famous landmarks. It's obvious that he has a knack for that kind of thing
Definitely do a podcast please, but monthly vlogs would be awesome too, whatever you're comfortable with
oh no your beautiful Italian shoes they're dirty
I'm sad last week is ending, I never thought I'd like it this much. I really hope you still throw in random vlogs here and there.\nHonestly I don't think I'd listen to a podcast as I'm not a huge podcast fan- I know my opinion doesn't matter, but I thought I'd throw it in anyway \n💖💖
I like the podcast idea but like seeing the vlogs so also monthly vlog lol!
That scream Tom made when it when deeper into the pool.... I FREAKING LOST IT 😂Love it
did his mum actually remember which ice cram he meant just by him saying it was his childhood favourite because if so that is damn impressive
Don't end last week
You seemed rather confident showing your body off on the camera, as you should anyway (because you're handsome). Hope that means you're feeling a bit more comfortable.
that sketch killed me.\ndas sum gud stuff right there
Wow that building in florance looks much bigger than I remember.\nFrom when I played Assassin's Creed
What about a more behind the scenes look of how a sketch/anything you make evolves from start to finish? (including the many creative breaks you, Elliot and Eddie take) :D
I lost it at 14:15 😂😂😂😂
The podcast idea sounds like it would be good, but whatever you choose to do, Tom, I and many other fans probably, implore you to not replace it with something scripted. The insight of naturality of your life that Last Week gives can't even hope to be replaced with anything less than your reality.
Charlie is so beautiful x
Pretentious Monthly Scrapbook or weekly 30min-1hour podcast.\nI'd say Podcast is best. You, Eddie, Elliot (possibly Charlie) can host and just bring friends like Chloe, Sammy or Jack Howard in to guest. Talk about a certain topic or just about anything that's new for you all. It could be a chance to promote your friends upcoming work too!
What happened to last week I fled the country

Make a dancing naked-elliot show. This is not even about what to substitue last week with.and also, because i'm italian and this is about italy, fai uno spettacolo con elliot nudo che balla.
Tom to miss edd gloud :c
Are these the drugs turning the frickin frogs gay?!
He's been sniffing a long time.  You know what Pastor Manning is saying about him
If someone is able to drug Trump, they would simply poison him on the spot.
Woah, you people are unbelievable morons and a I love it. Keep the comedy up!
umb trump supporters. They in such a bad shape that they need an stupid conspiracy theory to explain the retarded president they elected.
I don't know about the President being drugged but Alex is definitely on meth.
Anybody who believes anything this lunatic says should be locked in the looney bin along with him.
I think he got  his sources wrong. Trump's incoherent rambling isn't the result of him drinking coke, it's the result of him doing coke.
Oh.... well ... lucky for us we have a drugged puppet for president .. TRUMP IS A PUTIN CUCK... BANNON IS A WORTHLESS ALCOHOLIC... ALEX YOUR A NUTBAG OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT COLOR... THIS IS A FAKE NEWS CHANNEL... DUMP TRUMP 2020... INFO WHORES IS A FUCKING JOKE...
Alex you are the biggest idiot in the world.  But only if you dismiss the idiots that listen to you.
Alex, my asshole give birth to an alien thing, you should interview it!
03:24 Clooney gets his boner shined and polished daily by the hottest model in Europe, then he has lunch on the shores of Lake Como. What a fucking loser. Who's coming over for bonghits? Brad Pitt? Yeah tell Brad Pitt he's going to visit a loser.
If your aware that this happened at all I believe our President would be making arrests as this is direct threat to him, his family and our country.
I do not doubt that is going on. Trump needs to go on offensive and fire all the POS's around him.
put him in an institution allready
OK what proof is there?
Trump is not capable of purging the white house and the rest of the government.
Ok, even for Alex this is just bat shit crazy. You mind telling us about those people who tell you these things? Because this is ridiculess even for you right now Alex
Alex has lost it long ago..  Most presidents get drugged.  wtf?
AJ...  Did you not know that there are 2  Trumps???    One in the red tie and one in the blue....    Hint...On the night of the Election...that man who was with the Trump Family was not the real one....   wink wink.....
Okay lets follow this logic.... if presidents are being drugged then why did Obama's mind stay so sharp? Oh that's right because you're full of it and America's presidents follow a pendulum from term to term, smart to simple, smart to simple....
This kind of crap is why I prefer to watch Brain Fight with Tuck Buckford
You've talked to people who have talked right to him. Yeah okay buddy lmao this guy really is fkin nuts. I could get killed, I wanna let this out before they shut the show off. Totally insane
Click Bait Asshole
Where is the followup show with the big reveal??
Everyone, here is a link to all our reps in D.C. Contact them and tell them to shut down israeli atrocities.\nhttps://www.house.gov/representatives/find
The enemy, like a crack cocaine fiend, seeks povver by Any Means Necessary.  If Trump comes in and cuts off the enemy's access to control, and he has in many vvays, they vvill do vvhatever it takes to put an end to him.     Even if these brazen demons aren't drugging Trump novv, it's just a matter of time until they try.  Fidel Castro, love him or hate him, survived many attempts on his life,  Jesus Christ, believe in Him or not, had many conspiracies to imprison and kill him before they finally got to him..  only tofind out that you can't kill the truth.    There has alvvays been human beings acting like Snakes in The Grass.. Satan, take it as truth or fiction or metaphor, vvas the original Snake in the grass...and there vvill be many more snakes in the grass to come..     Distrust and caution are the parents of security.  Benjamin Franklin.    Be vigilant my fellovv Americans, The snakes are here.. lying in the shadovvs vvaiting to strike...  and they are poised against you because you are Righteous.  Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
People need to realise that this is the political commentary version of WWE. Once you understand this, you'll really enjoy it more. It really is fantastic! Thanks for another great show.
isn't this technically slander? I mean it's nuts for sure but isn't it legally slander?
I am worried because these are bad people that killed Chris Cornell and are paying Antifa and other groups to make blacks and whites to fight with each other while I want blacks and whites to unite in peace with each other.
Trump needs to never touch diet pop. Even pregnsnt women are told stay away from aspartame. Maybe he is allergic to aspartame. I know Trump watches u so lets make sure he opens his drinks himself and cleans the lid off
We need to get Jesse Ventura involved.....Alex keep the faith man.....we will prevail
I'm sure this guy is a plant this kind of thing discredits all the work intelligent people have done. Oh a don't forget to buy the crap that makes you more manly at the end🤡
lmfao and you people try to claim that mainstream media is fake
Jesus? Is America THAT twisted? WOW!
What's next? An assasination attempt?
So Alex, you got what you wished for. You wanted Reince Priebus out and now that he is gone look at where things are. You wanted President Trump to stop getting advice from Jarred and Ivanka, now they don't get to see President Trump. Are you happy you got what you wanted Alex?

This i dont belive, how would you know from a source , why xoesnt the source tell trump
Trump should drink Alexapure, to purify the body of the poison
>People like Clooney who has everything because of his billionaire parents\n\nLike Trump and his parents?\n\n>People are soo sick of empty low IQ who can't read of a prompter\n\n\nLike Trump and his inability to give the coherent speech they put on the prompter?
The best reason yet to impeach Trump, he is letting people drug him, and he is too stupid to notice, right!!!!
What a load of Bullshit
Alex & Roger what can we do, and how can I help. We can not let this happen to our President. I'm got a pit in my stomach and sick to my stomach.
need start showing us hard evidence, a lot of crazy talk . For years !! Seeing is believing
Oh Alex, is this your excuse for when Trump actually got into office he started to behave just like all the other (s)elected US presidents? Are you saying that all his backtracks on foreign policy are because he's being drugged through his favorite beverages? \n\nCause it must be some powerful stuff if it makes you sell arms to brutal regimes, illegally bomb nations and generally do a 180 on all the promises made in the run up to the election. \n\nAlex you are controlled opposition; maybe not always but somewhere down the line they turned you and this has been painfully evident in the recent months.
Have to say the thing about W is very interesting. I saw an pre election debate with he and gore and he was sharp as a razor, this is W I'm taking about. He tore gore up. I was used to the bumbling dumb ass one from years later, you know fool me once W.
I thought he was just fucking stupid ???? Drugs are you sure I think he's just thick !!!
this is 100% true i've been saying the same thing for years now
Hilarious. Keep up the good work Alex!
? fake news ? how is it that you know, but our president doesn't ? Hard to believe that the president is unaware.  If this is happening then do something about it - why tell us, take action.
At least drugs would explain some of the fucked up shit he says
I checked that CNN analyst, just to see if he really was stupid enough to brag about government officials in the USA plotting to assassinate our POTUS....and he really did! Tapper tries to sweep his threats under the carpet, but the analyst is so cocky about POTUS Trump being killed, he goes on to explain why the US government officials WILL assassinate the POTUS: because Trump hurt their feelings! Time to start locking people up on treason and conspiracy to commit murder charges!
Or, maybe it is an intense job, he is old and thus, is getting tired? Just a thought!
How long did Alex train to get his WWE voice?
Alex is right.  They have been doing this to celebrities and politicians for a long time now.  It's no secret.
😂😂😂more excuses for when he fires Mueller and gets impeached
This fucking guy
Diet Coke contains Aspartame, a known brain toxin.
Side shows...
Alex knows so much about drugs. Unhinged freak.
1.6 billion jobs wtf
You Americans are fucking idiots. \nThe whole world is laughing at you.
AJ stop with the fake news
slurred? How about cocaine Trump sniffs in white house?
He's on drugs anyway.  Doesn't need topping up.
This is a tipping point for Infowars.\nAlex IS his own worst enemy.\nFrom gaining CRED, trashing the media darling, having Trump's ear to this TMZ level garbage.
Then why aren't you letting the president know so  that he won't drink anything from them anymore.
Oh I see now,that's the reason trump is a total& utter TWAT.....its the drugs...Again!
Ok so is this 4th hr on YouTube?
You chickened back in December with the Podestas and, now, you are chickening again!
They didn't need to spend resources on drugs for BHO.
Actually...this might be truth, especially if J. Kushner is a Mossad mole. Inteligence agencies have 'truth drugs' that affect free will and people decision making and notice of the opportunity do to this or that, that leave not other noticeable side effcets. Even Robert David Steale mentioned this possibility in a interview he gave. How else can you explain why Trump seems to be reverting everything he promised. Folks your POTUS needs PRAYERS.
TRUMP SHOULD TAKE CARE AND SCREEN HIS FOOD AND BEVERAGES !  I WANT TRUMP 100 % INTACT !!
Britta everyone... Britta - problem solved.
15:05
Alex u sexy motherfucker
Does he mean Mao Zedong?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ya its called caffine
diet coke + slurred speech = wiskey poison
😂😂😂 you paranoid idiot
Info Wars on YouTube trending??
https://www.yahoo.com/news/don-apos-t-loud-trump-154400140.html ?
loosing credibility....
lmao this is comedy gold
FAT SPANKY ALL GROWN UP
This is trending in the U.K., I'm dead 😂
Is this a joke? I'm not american this video seems insane to me
STOP boning your daughter Mr President! Lose weight Alex lol! Both of you, GROW BRAINS!!!!
I'm done laughing at this man's insanity...
Guy looks like he should be on the Diet Coke, he's certainly got the drugs part sorted as he's definitely high the garbage he talking. George Clooney is a loser ha ha ha I stopped at that. Wacko. Then he said  they put a light on me at nbc ha ha ha prob right on his bald fat  head
I really hope Trumps sees this and acts to save his own life.
You know I have had it with the stupid shit
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH. THIS IS HILARIOUS. HE'S BEING DRUGGED? BY FUCKING WHO? Conspiracy levels are waaaaaaaaay too high. HE LOVED WORKING 16 HOURS A DAY? WHEN? HAHAHA.
Globalist internet sockpuppets attacking infowars on every video, they even impersonate to make Infowars / Trump supporters look bad, paid protestors for the internet. Read the internet sockpuppet wiki page. Though there are some genuine oblivious, pretentious, deceived, naive, idiot leftists / anti-Trumpers.
Mental.
Get this disgusting lying sack of screaming lard of the trending page. Wtf
I'm sorry, but if you believe this crazy jackass you're simply fucking retarded. I really do feel sorry for you brain dead assholes.
Where is the proof????
What color are the looters? Almost always  black...hmmm\nNo matter if it is USA, Haiti, South Africa or UK.....says something about set of mind.
They're actually repossessing what's theirs rightfully theirs from multi million dollar corporations.
Why are they all blacks
Do not comdemn the whole of the race. AS LONG AS THERE IS ONE PERSON DOING THE RIGHT THING YOU CANNOT CONDEMN THE WHOLE RACE. (most of these  comments are people saying racist shit and they have the audacity to not act like this off their keyboard) fuck outta here. Think for me - would you say this shit in front of a black person in real life? No? Thought so.
Looting in a time of crisis is low, real low but looting for sneakers...pmsl. whats the world coming to? Ice cube said it best.... blacks will always sing the blues...cuz all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes
Hood Rats stealing sneakers during a hurricane.  That's not what I would want to be know for doing during a hurricane. Once a Hood rat always a Hood Rat. When the end comes the only place to hide will be Hell for you all.
Was this filmed with a FLIR camera ?
No offence but why are they all black? Just saying i am sorry for offending u in anyway if i did
The irony of the British media catching looters..when All the world knows the biggest thug and theif is the united kingdom!!
That's why I always say black life matters
Before u judge u should know they needed those Adidas to survive.
PewDiePie must not comment on this video.
They saved limited edition Jourdans from flood damage, we should be applauding their bravery
Wow \nYou could fry an egg off the heat in this comment section.
idiots.they'll still be arrested afterwards!
They dindu nuffin, criminally taking advantage of a natural disaster is just part of their nature.
The video must be racist, they are ALL black. Thanks BBC for showing us what we already know.
Im not racist but ummmmm well video explains itself
Blacks taking something that doesn't belong to them? I never.
Where the hell are they going to put all this shit while there house is more then likely blown half way across the state? I hope they are at least going to sell them to help rebuild their house or to give to people who have lost everything. I highly doubt it tho.
Honestly the black community has a real problem with stealing, better parenting is needed
Oh look at that blacks stealing shit that ain't theirs..... now that's something you don't see everyday....
Now that's something I would not do... BUT if there was a nice looking 75 inch 4k TV just sitting nicely on display!! Cough cough..
Maybe you could also report this....White Looters, absolutely sickening the bias reporting, yet again\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48dF7nv_rC8
I could understand if it was food, but trainers and TVs?
Every single one is black....shocker
I like how you White People are now generalising a WHOLE RACE based on the activities of some people in America. You guys are truly Close minded idiots as they say.
I'd probably loot as well ngl
Why is everyone so quick to say black people. Don't brand us all. They are few in a crowd of many.
Terrible, at times like this we need to come together not steal
This is what they meant by the storms take everything away, it doesn't actually take it, it manipulated the darkness to do its bidding
Black people would steel dead people if they where getting money for them. now I'm not saying all black people but in over all black people are the lowest form of people around the world
Is there anyone else that is just bored with race and racism altogether? whenever I see anything to do with race and racism I just sigh and move on. \n\n Derogatory words are B O R I N G. Black lives matter and other race movements are B O R I N G. White supremacy is B O R I N G. Unoriginal stereotypes and prejudices are B O R I N G. Blah blah blah.\nSeriously the racists need to smarten up and stop being so stupid, and then, the annoying ass sjws and protestors can fuck off as well! Then we can live in a slightly less shitty world, where perceptions and discussions of race arent shoved down every hole in our bodies.
STOP, please stop with all the racism,these people were actually saving businesses,from the wrath of Irma,look at At the shoes they saved,they should have been on CNN heroes,I mean come on Would you have bought wet shoes from those Foot Lockers?These people risk there lives to save those businesses,while the Whites, Hispanics,and Asians were to scared to save those businesses,they were  hunkered down in there homes👍👍👍
There all black. Not being racist.
Shit ton of racists in the comments.
Not all blacks commit crimes but for those that do, you let yourselves and your people down by being awful ambassadors. Understand that when Whites commit crimes, they don't get tarnished because they control and manipulate the media to their liking and bias. Your people don't have that luxury so you have to be better than whites. Look at the Asian and Indian Americans as example.
You call it looting, i call it rescuing
Its always the black people. I am not rasict but like 90% are black...
When you gotta grab dem fresh j's
How do you know that the blacks don't have bread in those shoe boxes
This is racist showing black people taking advantage of a natural disater too steal......
This is sad af
There was a hurricane..they better stole food instead of shoes
Fake news! This is clearly a bunch of kids trying to save the shops from  approaching flood water
why are they all black...
What absolute scum. When they are traced, caught and dealt with I hope they are made an example of.
This is ALL the evil white man's fault.
They're all black huh...
It is just sad what their values are.  I'd like to know what kind of house each one of these people live in.  I'd like to know what they drive.  I'd like to know how deep they are in debt.  I'd like to know if they have jobs, checking account or savings.  I'd like to know if they are on welfare and their level of education.  Their values are so different from the majority of the people in the US.  They are 200 years behind.
People trolling and making racist comments have no life lmao
The land of freedom and human rights. What a disgrace!!
It's every day bro
I would actually do the same  thing but do it in walmart and get as many cereal boxes as I can.....oh and potatoes.
Notice how they are black
How pathetic. In times like this the community should come together and be at its closest.\n\nBut instead , a few idiots, decide to go stealing. SMH .
Scum! Hope they get a sensible punishment
Funny that JewBC allows bashing comments about blacks stealing but when it comes to comments about Israel murdering children they delete them and disable comments LOL\nJewBC at it again.
Why white people don't participate? This is so Racist.
Black kid: Daddy, daddy. We have no food or water, help us\nFather: Fuck that, I'm gettin my self some Jordans\n\nEhh.. Who am I kidding, black kids don't have fathers
They are not black people looting they are idiot criminals, no matter what race they are, white people steal too.
Not surprised it's a bunch of black people 😂😂😂 I'm black my self so stfu
Is this the leaked planet of the apes 2018???
When black Friday hits early
All fuckin blacks too, what a disgusting mess. Fuckin monkeys 🐒
Pricks
Oh look, black people stealing.
Oh look all niggerz
Typical
ofcourse they're black
#blacklivesmatter

#Blacklootersmatter

THERE ALL BLACK . . .
Black lives matter...
Black Looters Matter!
Dis iz ovviusly white peepul folt wake up peepul! They dindu nuffin
Lol
TriHard Mine now TriHard
All black arses as usual
Black lives matter.
https://youtu.be/aX86l4sXGWI
Dindu's
Why is it always black people? Why are there no WHITE/BROWN people looting?
Look at all those evil white looters...
And blacks wonder why they live in segregated areas like apartheid South Africa. You have to live apart from these animals and have loaded guns at all times if you do live in black areas. I had a cousin that lived in a black neighborhood and was burglarized 3 times in one year, and all 3 times the blacks broke in while they were asleep./
So White people as always trying to pin the blame on black people, or should I say white men trying to pin the blame it is so obvious that white men don't want to lose their wealth and power so they make the hurricane happen to make black people look bad.
Stop generalising a whole race for what they are doing ,I read about a white man who  raped a chihuahua, you don't see me telling everyone to hide dogs from white people or literally hating on their whole race
I'd love be there and just shoot the thieves,it would be such fun
Forget the racist BLM !! What a shining example to society these black people are. Whilst everyone is huddled in schools and basements, scared of being killed by this hurricane, these brave black people are putting their lives on the line to save their local shops stock from the hurricane, so they can buy things with their hard earned money from their 50hr a week jobs, once the hurricane has passed. Noticed, even when the police turned up, they didn't even stop for the police to give them a standing ovation for their bravery, they carried on running in and out of shops saving tv's/trainers the LOT !!
Its a fact that blacks commit about 50% of the crime yet they're only about 13% of the population.
All Black people, Then they ask why... come on on black people defend you're self against video evidence and show how stupid you are buy saying things like... \n\n1. Maybe you're lacking intelligence but most black people live normal lives and this video only shows a few black people. Don't condemn the whole race for a few people.\n\n2.Plenty of white people been doing this too, but when they do it they're scavenging for supplies.\n\n Oh yeah sure.... bla bla bla... people are losing there life and you just want to get them adidas trainers.\nDon't matter what you say, it can't beat video evidence.\nShould be ashamed of them self's.
Funny how you barely see one white person stealing the shit
Look at all those white ppl stealing...
Racists crying over some shoes meanwhile a white savage teens just tried to lynch an 8 year old for being half black in new hampshire. Smh
This is Satan,who brain washed them otherwise they are innocent souls...
Im not racist. Were are the white looters.

I wonder if Tommy noticed that James was makin fun of him in this? it feels like it.
I am dying at the fact James is talking like Tommy and they're all acting like that's normal
Does James Franco actually speak like that or is he having a trouble coming out of the tommy speech pattern lmao
How high is James :D
I'm not sure if Tommy is acting still or this is how he actually is
You can tell James is still kinda stuck in the role by how he talks to Tommy lmao
They should have added Tommy in a cameo
I really love this because they don't make fun of Tommy. Because as much of a disaster The Room was, it was earnest and made by someone. It's easy to mock (and it's fun) but James Franco just saw someone who wanted to make things and that's more than can be said about 99% of us YouTube commenters.
Tommy seems like a genuinely nice guy
this dude Tommy on drugs man?
the premise is like Tropic Thunder but in real life.
His American accent has gotten better at least.
I feel like i'm the only one who disagrees - from what i've seen James does a pretty awful Tommy Wiseau impression, that and him and Seth Rogen lied about their fandom of the movie. I would guarantee they only saw it in the past year or 2.
I think Dave Franco is a bit miscast. Other than that the movie looks great.
Oh hai James, how is your sex life
It's hilarious how James Franco actually removes words from sentences while talking to Wiseau - almost as if he's speaking with him in his own language. 'Wiseauish'
The three of them on the left look exactly the same
Dude is not from Louisiana
tommy, you will never admit it, but you made a bad movie, but it worked out, embrace it.
I don't love Johnny anymore and I don't want to talk about it anymore
So is the dog going to get Nominated too? For best dog on a movie? (Hai Doggie!)
This interview is really fun and ....... Oh hi Mark!
oh god its amazing how 1 Franco naturally looks like Tommy and the other looks like Greg
Does anyone notice, James Franco can't stop doing Tommy when talking to Tommy
Legend has it that Tommy always looks whet because he's drenched in pussy juice.
Greg Sestero's book is one of the greatest things I've ever read.\n\nThat said, I definitely recommend getting the audiobook version, since you really need Sestero's dead-on impression of Tommy throughout to really get the best out of it.
The video I didn't know I needed to watch.
So is james franco an example of buzzfeed's man spreading video?
Beautiful on so many levels... Heartfelt stories like this deserve to be at the Oscars & I've never heard anyone publicly compliment James on Sonny as he so well deserves! XD So interesting that it was Tommy.
So why couldn't greg sestero just play himself? I mean he still  looks young and dave doesn't really look like him
it's strange how similar these brothers are to the actual actors, from hair color to cheekbones and everything
It's so cute, James is trying very hard not to comment on Wiseau's greasy (salivated?) chin in front of the camera.
I love tommy and james...they have an amazing chemistry❤
It's amazing how being next to Tommy makes James Franco seem like a normal, well-adjusted person.
So how's your sex life
To BEEEE or not to BE. THAT is the QUesTIon!
Who's that guy in the leather mask and goggles?
i love that whenever James and Tommy would talk, James would just automatically start talking in his Tommy Wiseau accent
Sounds like James Franco was mocking Tommy a little bit during the interview. 😁
why do I feel like Dax Shepard would have been a better mark
Wow he has that stupid duchebag haircut and sweater and is one too. Reminds of this asshole from work. Should have given Tommy a throne to sit in. Not all cramped up.
If James sat like a human Tommy could actually sit comfortably.
James Franco clearly really has a fondness for Tommy it's nice to see
Lol idk if it was intentional but James puts on a Tommy accent at 1:10 you're looking at yursaal for first time\n\nedit - definitely intentional lol he keeps doing it
Tommy hasn't aged in almost two decades.
I enjoy watching them interact with the OG creators. Really cool
I hope the film will be as respectful as Ed Wood has been, but I doubt it and think it will go for the easy laughs. :/
So Tommy don't notice that James talk bad like him on purpose?
poor tommy has no space to sit. james manspreading him out haha
James Franco is completely manspreading Tommy during the entire interview. Unacceptable...
Tommy Wiseau makes James Franco look like a completely sane person.
Tomy is such a good sport
This is so amazing
I love how James is talking to tommy in tommys accent lol
tommy wears those glasses because his future is too bright
There's a clear difference between the Franco brothers here. Dave is much more polite while James takes up leg space so tommy looks left out. He mocks him in his accent. Little things but still.
Why is Tommy's chin all wet?
3:50 : So hilarious when James nodded (closing his eyes even, like it's dead serious and true) when Tommy was maybe seriously (because who knows, it'll remain a mystery) telling him about how The Room has also many details. Quoting the man himself : The Room, people laughing, this laughing, that, we have also detail detail dit.
They are so annoyed with him ( Tommy )
You think Tommy ever gets sick of everyone's shit as they constantly impersonate him? Like I know they're not being dicks but like imagine philip seymour hoffman speaking like droopy the dog while doing promotion for capote.\n\nexcept capote was dead for the release of his biopic.\n\nand hoffman's dead too now.\n\nwhere am i
I liked the camera movement in the pool scene....there was no camera movement in that scene loool😂😂
Shoulda got a smaller couch 😂🤦‍♂️
After The Room came out, Greg Sestero looks upset all the time although he smiles. His friendship with tommy is strange. I feel for both of these 2 despite how much I like The Room.
Why is Tommy's chin so wet?
James sounds like he's still in character.
smh at all of James Franco's manspreading, squeezing everyone else XD
I like how when James talks to Tommy, he skips articles in his grammar like Tommy does lol.
What a load of bullshit
Franco looks like he wants Wiseau's kids......
Greg talks a lot doesn't he?
What the fuck Greg doesn't say one thing
James Franco awkwardly staring at the sweat on Wiseau's chin 😂😂😂
Worst actor in the world gets this much notoriety?? only in hollyweird!
Franco takes 1/3 of that couch. Close thoses legs, man. So impolite.
Can't wait for this movie to come out!!!
Wiseau has a fucking gaming channel on Youtube
Does James know he's still using Tommy-esque mannerisms.. it's kinda freaky in his regular voice
Tommy is loving this.
james is still talking in tommys accent even during normal conversation lol
note to self: watch this film high
Oh hey mark
Redbox instant classic
Iwaslauhkyaeughiknaughh hahah
'
Akward hand shake
dinner with schmucks
Praise Wiseau
You're tearing me apart Franco!!!
James Franco's ego lol
This is fucking amazing
Greg looks umcomfortable/bored
Oh Hai mark
'Hows your sex life?'
Hi doggy
Wiseau>Brando
Huge shadow ì hate 2 havr james as abro
Sestero gets brushed off at 4:25.
James Franco? More like James MANSPREADING\n\nHUGH MUNGUS HWAT
has tommy been drooling?
Why is he wearing sunglasses? Is he actually a vampire?
It's so great that you are opening a bank account for Ayla. I really wished my parents did that for me at some point when I was younger (but its only a false wish since my parents were immigrants and didnt know a lot about how a lot of things worked...)
Bubz, I love your vlogs. it brings me joy seeing you guys. ^^\n\nbtw, I noticed that there were spams of nasty comments and inappropriate links. So please report it when you guys see it. I've tried to report as many as i can. I don't want the kids on youtube who watches bubz's videos to see it. So horrible..
I realize, my parents may have taken a more extreme route for me because my first concert was the KISS reunion tour in 2000. I was five years old XD
Where the fuck was Ayla?.... good video tho lol
Ahhh Paw Patrol!! My younger brother is like 9 months older than Isaac and LOVES Paw Patrol. He has so many books and he makes me read them every day.
BUBZ WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A NEW INTRO FOR YOUR VIDEOS
My wee sister loved paw patrol live. My mum's sister talked mum into taking my sister and our cousin. It cost them an arm and a leg.
That is the same living room where you used to make those funny comedies
Remember seeing busted at the odyssey too 😂
Aw, this reminded me of when I was 4 and my mom was SO excited to take me to a LIVE Barney show. But she accidently took me the weekend after it happened, so I never got to see it :( At least she tried!
TIME FOR A NEW INTRO
Enjoyed Tim doing a bit of vlogging~
I was watching some of your old vlogs and I remembered how Tim was really fond of Despicable Me! Think it would be a good idea if you let Isaac watch it, I'm sure he will enjoy it ☺️👍🏻
Omg! Issac is talking a lot lately!!! He is so adorable <3
Even though paw patrol was... *cough* shit..😂😂😂
Tim watching paw patrol is how I feel when I am at school.
Judging by Isaac's reaction (or lack thereof) I'd say no it wasnt worth it.
almost 1 mil bubz! I've been here for years and still going on strong!
Are you going to create a new intro to your videos ? 🙂❤
The things we do for kids! :D Should have just bought a dvd LOL
Tim actually hit one of the markers
Damn, what a bad turn out o.O \n\nWe had booked to take my nephew to see that in August at Manchester Arena and due to the closure of the arena a new venue was found but it was a month earlier and original tickets weren't valid for the new venue so we just got the refund and saved ourselves the hassle of rearranging days off.
'If u smile I'll give you popcorn'Hey u cant bribe me like that >:3
I love your vlogs big much!! ❤️
Wasn't full price about £65 each regardless of age? We almost gifted our nephew but decided the money could go further!
Lindsy well done you are 18 on trending and I just wanted to say I love watching Isaac grow up it is so cute and thank you for posting about your life!
Ricky !!!! Omg, now im gonna go see what he's been up to on he's channel lol . I MISSED him ! I knew my eyes weren't playing tricks on me haha .
lol Issac and Tim have the same expression when watching the paw patrol show, like father like son. It always fun watching you guys!!! Love you guys!! <3
Hi Bubz! I have watched you since before you were married and I am basically committed to watching your videos still, I love it so much! I'm sure you guys know what you're doing but due to my own past experiences i sort of became worried for Lala because my mom tried her best not to neglect my older brother and instead she neglected me. even giving me to my grandma really did some damage to me because i didn't know what a mother's love was supposed to be like growing up. Again, i think you guys know what you're doing and i only see glimpses of what goes on, through your videos. But please don't let ayla be removed from your presence for too long or she could feel disconnected with you, as to this day (been praying for God to restore my family) i have felt disconnected with my own family. please do keep me in prayer as well as you can see i need it, haha. anyway, it was a small worry, but i'm sure you guys know what you're doing, and i'm sorry if this came off the wrong way. God bless you and your beautiful family!!! Love youuu!! <3
lol! Isaac was obviously unimpressed throughout the Paw Patrol show. haha...
You guys made my day 💝 may I know what's in your lips at 2:24? It's looks so natural and fresh. You are glowing from deep within 😘. Lot's of love from the Arab Emirates 💐💐💐
The most beautiful family in the globe!
Bubz I think you've scarred Issac 😂 paw pawtrol will never be the same
Hey Bubz, what color of lip tint from Em Cosmetics did you use? Love you and Ng fam!
Issac is talking so much now!!! LOVE YOUR FAMILY!!!
Isaac makes me smile Big Much! 😀😀😀♥♥
I've been hearing people say Paw Patrol for so long and just realized that it isn't Papa Troll.
Such a sweet family
Wow you live in NI? I realised your accent. I'm Cantonese and Vietnamese. Usually go to the arena for the Belfast Giants Games. Your kid is so cute. Great to see locals 😊
That moment when he says...on tv\nLol
Worth paying double full price for paw patrol for Isaac to see it!
Wow bubz you're sooo close to 1 mill subscribers! Seems like you'll get there by your next video!! Yaayy!!
When are you guys going to do a new intro with Ayla? ☺
aww bubz, i am so tired with my pregnancy, i am 3 months with my first born and thank god i have been watching you since your pregnancy with isaac. I suffered hyperemesis for 2 months and rejected taking Plasil. i lost a lot of weight and i am so concerned with my baby. but the doc says its healthy. i am just concern my weight is still dropping i still cannot eat. i am very much dehydrated my lips were chapped and dry. water didnt taste good so i sometimes drink electrolyte water to replenish me. but with all these struggles i am looking forward to finally meet my firstborn! godbless and love much mommah bubz!
Issac means laughter. May he grow full of joy and laughter.
Was it worth it? Lemme work it. I put my thang down flip it and reverse it
I love your shooting stance, it's very serious. 🤣
Isaac looks like ricky.
Rickhe with the violin dancing was the best belly laugh I've had all day lol
Isaac is so big now! I guess It's been a while since I last saw a vlog of you. The way he puts on his cap is so cute!!! 😍
Isaac is growing up so fast! ☺️
Isaac has gotten really good with his speaking, I'm happy to see his improvement. (^-^)
I know now not to take my kid to see Paw Patrol when I have one haha XD
aw! Isaac is so sweet hi mommy ... miss Ayla on this blog : |
You guys are one of my most favorite family in Youtube. You guys are so genuine, humble & did not change despite having many followers. Wishing your family all the happiness & good health!
He is getting so big
Issac is such a sweet boy!! I enjoyed your vlog as always thanks!!
oh my god the last shot where his eyes roll
Isaac is getting so big now woah!
I thought you were saying papa troll. I was like what is papa troll.... Lol
if you've gone through all the paw patrol episodes you should watch rescue bots. It's my nephew's new obsession after paw patrol.
now I want to try that shooting toy XD
Hahaha Isaac's facial expressions at the end😂
it's amazing to see how far Isaac's speech has come along, i'm so proud of him ❤️ you're such a beautiful family
So nice seeing how Isaac has grown! My nephew loves Paw Patrol too. And you have a baby girl! God bless your family Bubz
I feel so sad that those people have to perform in a nearly empty room :(
Bubz you seemed more excited than isaac to see paw patrol :D
My boyfriend's little brother LOVES paw patrol. He talks about it and makes me watch it with him a lot. It's so cuteee watching him get so excited about paw patrol.
I haven't seen your videos in a little while and it's amazing how much Issac has grown
Isaac and Tim's faces at 5:43 HAHA
I've been missing Ricky so much! So nice to see him again
My son says he loves me ''big ever'' alot and forever
I love your vlogs because you inspire me to be kind and a happy person in life. Thank you bubbi. <3
OK I WAS LIKE WHO'S BEAVER HAHAHAHAH
Awww I was watching your vlog when my nephew runs over and starts waving at the screen and saying hi to Isaac! He runs back later saying I wanna say hi to baby! Even though they're like the same age haha
Just thought I'd say you can really hear the Irish accent in Isaacs voice now! Too cute!
My cat got terrified from that weird instrument (i think it was a violin) sound lol
No Lala? :(
Ive never seen a cuter smile in my life
Lmao Tim's face had me cracking up 😂😂😂
Your brother is always such a laugh xD
Tim's face is priceless !! 😂😂😂

I have loads of palettes and I think this is hands down the most versatile I have now.  I don't think there's a look I like that I can't create with it.  About to go on holiday and I've been debating which of my palettes to take and honestly now I just need this one.  AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!

I'd love to get both of these because they are so pretty 😍😍  (and they hella cheap) but shipping is 31 dollars to New Zealand which is basically the same price as the both of the products ;(
I just bought both of the palletes ahhhhhh I'm so excited 😝😝😝

AMAZING PALLETS! 😍 also loving the no bs approach as a lot of youtubers don't actually give the real info! Love this and love you! Can't wait to buy it 💖
Congratulations on your make up!! I'll be purchasing asap xxx
I hope you could do a contour palette for pasty faces like me and like you say PUG would be the perfect natural contour shade!!!!!

Congrats!!! Both palettes look so gorgeous and I'm defiantly going to get them❤️
Are they a permanent collection soph please say yes!!😬
I love you and your channel so much soph, I'm so happy you got to do this and bet you'll get more come out. Can't wait to get my hands on that x
Are there any cool toned colours? I was too tired to watch through your whole 25+ minutes announcement video to check. I have more of a blueish undertone to my skin, which is why pink toned and yellowed toned stuff often doesn't work well with my skin tone. Also, I wear mostly cool toned clothes, so... yeah.
Dude. I had no idea who you were until literally 5 seconds ago. I saw your palette and I was like; Whaaaaaat?! This girl has good taste?! Why haven't i heard of her?? Anyway, I have green eyes so this palette is totally my colour scheme. Thank you for having purple, copper, and cranberry, red and pinks all in the same palette.  A+ job. Subscribed.
How do you remember the shades and if you brought it out. How would we know?
Will this be sold at ULTA ?
I'm so proud of you Soph, beth palettes are stunning!! Pleasantly surprised to discover both are vegan and cruelty free- even better 💚💚
😭😭😭 they are amazing! But i can't buy it😭😭😭😭 the shipping for my home is 29$ and I just want to cry! When I finally find an economic and beautifull palette the shipping get her out of my budget😭.\nBut they look amazing! Congrats! 💖\nBtw' hey from Puerto Rico Soph!
I have just bought the pallet today and will be doing a testing video soon when it comes
I have to say I'm a little surprised you put purples in the palette, as only a few days ago you mentioned you weren't going to purchase the desert dusk palette because there are too many purple shades. No hate, I do enjoy the pops of color. There is a wonderful variety of color and it is a beautiful palette at a great price point! I just wish the shipping to the US was more like $5 instead of $10....almost the same price of the palette lol. Cant wait to see what other looks you come up with & congratulations!!! :)
What I love is that she still tells the truth about her pallet but still I'm going buy it cause it's bloody amazing well done
OH MY GODNESS, LOOK AT HOW IS GORGEOUS YOUR MAKEUP, I LOVE IT
my mum just bought me these for my birthday cannot wait to use them! ✨❤️
These palettes look amazing, Soph! I am so happy for you! :D <3 I do have a massive request and I hope you're going to see this. Since you're working with Makeup Revolution it would be the most amazing thing if you could ask them to get logicalharmony.net approved. It's an amazing source for all of us who want to use true and researched cruelty free brands. I'm not saying Makeup Revolution is not cruelty free but they are on the grey area list and I would love to see them on the 100% cruelty free list. And that would mean I (we) could buy your palettes and I would love to support you! You're such an inspiration, thank you! :) <3
Congratulations Soph, I can't wait to get your highlighter palette it looks insanely gorgeous!
I ordered mine and I absolutely can't wait for them to come in!!
Just ordered both palettes!! So excited to get them. Congrats!!!🍾
Oh Sophie, you did an AMAZING JOB with both PALETTES!  I'm so proud of you! 🖒😍😙  I'm running to get my credit card because I am in love with both of them.  I really like that you did cream packaging, and those shades are absolutely gorgeous.  Adam did good by adding you to the team. xx 💖
Ordered it and im soo excited to test it outt  all the way from texas much love 😍💖 ...

Are your lips actually that colour naturally or have you had them coloured? Suuuuper jealous!😱

I just ordered both!!!❤ can't wait to use that highlight! been saving up for the naked heat palette but that is sooooo expensive and doesn't have highlighters! so I thought wth?! 💖💖💖💖
One of the two finest and best comedy shows of all time. Of course the other one is Seinfeld.\nCannot wait to watch the new season. \n\nBig fan from Saudi Arabia.
I was in a hot dog eating contest..and I was constipated...and I fucking won!
I hope he keeps doing this for years, it's just going to get funnier the older he gets.
This is a blessing(and a paycheck) Larry. Look at it this way, nobody stays up and watches SNL any more so it's just a wasted cameo. And at CYE, nobody ask if you are a Racist, NAZI or Klansman, at least not to your face. And Baldwin is on a losing streak and needs the money to keep his wife's tennis coach employed. But if it means that much to you, Bernie might run again in 2020 but of course we know Hillary will be running so it will be another short run for Bernie and you'd be out on the street again. At least at CYE you've got a check.
the change in camera quality is throwing me off
hopefully more political incorrectness and less sjw pandering.
Sanders/David 2020
117 people don't respect wood.
Anyone know how I can watch this in the UK without waiting for bloody ages?
YOU GOT LONG BALLS LARRY
The world is in the death knell of a nuclear circle firing squad and this guy steps into the center to do his haha schtick ?

Thank the Gods. The Golden God. Larry has returned to us like the crashing of a thousand waves.
Larry David is so fucking funny!!
subscribe and view my videos !!!! :) <3
If I see u on my bus again...
anyone seen the leaked episodes from this season and how were they compared to the older seasons? don't think i wanna spoil it as there only seems to be the second, third and fourth ones available..
The best comedy show ever...pretty pretty pretty awesome 😂
God knows how long I have been waiting for this. Just air them already!
They're all really showing their ages now.
17 years since the show premiered and we still can't watch re-runs on TV.   A-holes.
I've never seen this show but if this means more memes yeah
Seriously, I thought most of these people had died already.
I'm allowed to be happy for this, but not in front of Larry! And only mild laughter.
NOTICE LARRY IS GETTING ANGRIER AND ANGRIER AS THE YEARS GO BYE, JUST LIKE ME
1:08\n\nWas that a shit bow?
nick-picky observation I know, but I saw the mattress/airbed he landed on at 1:09
His shit is kind of getting old and worn out.
You know what was great about this trailer? It hyped me up for the show without giving away any spoilers, a basic promotional technique that most trailers today have forgotten how to use.
i've never seen this show but just from this trailer it looks pretty damn funny
...do you like a chip and a dip?
I am so excite for your returning, Lawrence!! I hope to perhaps edit this New Season and sneak my Face and Torso inside it!!
Larry David is up there with Sigmund Freud ,Einstein, Nabakov and Jesus in my best Jews ever list. Last time I was this pleased with developments my wife told me she was pregnant. Fucking Marvellous.
Huge fan of LD we both share the same bday July 2nd plus his show funny af😂😂😂😂😂can't wait
I came for the curb and left
If the previous seasons were even a bit scripted, this one is alltogether... And I doubt the previous ones werent
Mankind's greatest creation is Larry David.
you're allowed to be happy but uh... not infront of me...
Omg, I love this show! can't wait. I desperately need to laugh!
What kind of stain was it?  True comedy is back!!!!
If Larry shaved his head he'd look like Patrick Stewart.
Omg cant wait! Its finally here!! I've waited so long for this
Return of the high-functioning sociopath - makes a nice change from the low-functioning one in The White House.

Funny show. But undoubtedly neo-liberal propaganda.
I have bought HBO every year for many many years now I am done with you liberal pieces of shit fuck you and fuck your network and fuck all you America haters not buying another fucking product from Hollywood. I'll guarantee you're going to lose so much fucking money and you assholes will never win another election trust me
Weak meme
Unlike Seinfeld, this has gone on a lot longer than should have. Should've ended it season 5
lol snoop says teams need someone like Kap that will help you win right now.. Kap's had a losing record the last two years in a row, he's a trash qb and too much of a liability
Magic: he stood up... LMAO
lol man makes a point that this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave ......until i blieve it is the land of the free and home of the brave will i not stand for teh natl anthem.......lmfao. IM sorry which triggered bitches on which sides of the spectrum want to make more of it lmfao...........pls project all problems in life into the issue as apparently there is more to look into.....oh people that have the right to pass on this guy did......and now its coming into question???????????really in question? or the issue of indifference and  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave that is really being brought up again due to it selling quite well in our climate........its ok im sure colin is the only one that believes  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave triggered salt bitches come here to shit on him as a safe space i guess........bc  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave is apparently a view only held buy 1 guy enough to equate to 1/2 the country hating him.........for some reason bc  this isnt the land of the free and home of the brave is only a thought held by 1 american apparently  lmfao. meanwhile i await the signs of a one world govt/globalized army etc....that is free to commit world wide atrocity with little to no opposition taxing and enslaving the world on a global scale yeah w.e. Hegemons got a far wider scope than the typical laymen looking at the world through a straw while breathing through the same straw. lmfao keep projecting that its colin thats the problem and in reality this 50% thats not exactly or literally 50% of our population but the deplorables that projects their hatered to the remaining population onto colin lmfao.....and every other object that the hegemons put in front of you to scare you into your next panicked act or impulse.....lmfao you fools cant even choose your own choices or decide or rationalize anything you merely look to your decision makers to do as the hegmonds intend for the proletariat god damn
It's all the backlash and constant questions the team would get if he was picked up by a team. That and they would lose a little money. That's from the fans not understanding and/or not caring about what's going on with the uncalled for killings and brutality from police against blacks and no consequences for it. Too hard to see through the lens of another person and being closed minded. For some it's just racism. Teams don't want to take the chance of sacrificing their comfort zone or likelihood of the franchise. So for those who say why then just move? Shouldn't have to, he was born here and ancestors had a BIG stake in building this country for shit. He opted out but he's good enough to be at least a backup somewhere.
An AIDS infected Male slut, and a Pot head druggy that promotes Black youth to drugs and a life of crime! Yeah, we want their advice! Lol! On a racist Black loser QB that hates Blacks as much the KKK does! 😂! \n\nNot one of the three live in a black neighborhood!!!\n\nThis is hilarious!! You can't write this type or ignorance!! I love it! Daytime drama! As The Race Card Turns!!!!
Season already kicked off and still no Colin lol
Are y'all blind. He  got benched as a back up quarterback way BEFORE he starting kneeling. Why don't anyone remember this? He underperformed during practices WAY BEFORE he starting kneeling during  the anthem. So please.....lets cut the BULL CRAP AND THE FAKE HYSTERIA.
probably the first time, I heard snoop talk without saying bitches and hoes..
Only difference is backup QB's are not asking for millions of dollars. Fuck Kap, He's trash and needs to just focus on his black panther bullshit..Lol
Same happened to Mahmoud Abdul Rauf in the NBA
a black athlete that kids might look up to is in the media for standing up for social issues and using his own money and time to help others!?!?!?!?! GOD FORBID
Kap is getting what he deserves the NFL is doing the right thing
I'm done with ESPN. Its become too political for my liking. Having Snoop Dogg on the panel is not appropriate. Goodbye
It's crazy looking at snoop now compared to the death row days 😂
Snoop look like he got stone 3-5 hours before he got on the show...
snoop and magic, I don't think they're could possibly be a cooler panel
Kap should do like Terelle Pryor and switch to wide receiver
Help a team win????? Hello helped the niners win one game out of eleven with his 1-10 record last year.
We have a pussy grabbing lying racist as president, but Kaep is being vilified for protesting.
For fucking Christ's sake, COLIN HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING BUT WEAR A FUCKING TSHIRT, AN AFRO, AND TAKE A KNEE!!!! It's not like he is out brandishing a weapon at civilians! What is so wrong behind that?
Kaepernick will not buck dance ok back down. I support Kaepernick 100 %
Why doesn't he just go to the CFL then?? LOL
Conservatives get black balled in Hollywood all the time for their beliefs. So whats so special about Kaepernick getting black balled in the NFL? ESPN employs BLM activists instead of sportcasters to pump out white hate and Kaepernick supports that. Let him go work at ESPN and join the club.\nJust because you can throw a ball does not mean your owed a job in the NFL. You think Kaepernick is the only one who has more skill then some in the NFL? If you apply at my work and I don't like you, I should still be forced to hire you? F that.
What happened to the very next comment, made by Max Kellerman, ESPN? Didn't want anyone to hear that again, huh?
Love these guys (except for max) but talking aboit bads schools and bools being torn. Magic has clearly never been a teacher. The kids r awful, they r the ones tearing the books.
Snoop probably went to ESPN high af😂😂
That's y we NEED MORE BLACK OWNERS!
Yea this is what we needed,nigga that has aids to talk about black problems...whats next??Magic johnson faggot tranny son will come to the show to speak  about tranny lives? Snoop Dog like 60 year old stil reps crip gang and killed innocent men and they not put him in jail...yeah these are the voices black peoples needs to listen...some aids dude that has tranny son,and some 60 year old nigga still acting like he gangbanger
Snoop needs to be a regular on this show. I'd rather have his real opinions on things than hear Will Cain try to analytically dissect and disagree with everything SAS and Max say. Would put a real positive spin on this show, which sometimes tends to devolve into bickering and arguing over abstract points and ideologies.
Is Colin Kaepernick going to take the Colts to the playoffs? Nope. The jets? Nope. The jags? Nope. He's not some transcendent player who is going to make your team great so don't try to tell me that if they cared about winning they'd sign Kaepernick. Oh by the way it is a good move for owners to not sign him because there are lots of people protesting the NFL over these guys kneeling for the anthem so regardless of how Stephen A feels, Kaepernick did offend a good portion of the audience.
Come subscribe to my channel! The top 100 subs will be entered in a giveaway!!!
why does she talk wtf. just sit there and look hot. women shouldnt be analysts
CAN WE PLEASE FUCKING STICK TO SPORTS!!!!
but who wants him ?
Oh and by the way.... hard drug use in america has increased again in america as if its the 80s......  and guess what culture is the most followed/popular with the new generation?.....     I know people are still too primitive to understand this but racism in America is not your number 1 problem black ppl..........    never has been.   Who lives freer than black males in america?  Watch your television
That's true snoop dog!! But them folks ain't trying hear that.. it is what it is..
Snoop Dog is actually better than Will Clown
It's not football something u u use your hands dumb Americans
Stephen A. Smith and snoop hit me up guys, I got some doctors that could fix those hairlines that go all the way back to segregation.
Kap is going to be recognized as one of the greatest humanitarians of all time, keep it up white America.
Lost all respect for snoop' s heroin smoking ass after the Floyd and Connor fight
Hey I don't turn on ESPN for politics now I got to stop watching ESPN because it a Biased Network come on freaking racecards going to now be in sports give me a freaking break... Why don't you just go on strike and not even have the football season just because of one jerk
Snoop the sell out,  SAS is more gangsta
Magic Johnson and Snoop Dogg. Thats a lotta greatness right there
Maybe he's too much of an off field distraction that hasn't produced enough on the field to be on a team. 85% of the league is black. Shut up with this racist bs.
Stoop dog on the set
Colin wasn't helping my niners win the last season he was there. He had a hot couple of years. He's not an elite passer. The other stuff just the icing on the cake.
so, Pac wasn't cool with Snoop Dogg?
why does it seem everyone that is backin colin now was quiet as shit at the time of his protests?
Trust, if you can ball or be top 10-12 at your position you ALWAYS get a second shot in the NFL. But if you are just ON THE TEAM you become a distraction and not a team enhancement. PERIOD.\n\nSo there are 12 QB's as a GM i would take over Kaep, easily. And my NFL team building strategy at the QB position changes drastically if my QB choice is under top 12-15. I move the time and dollar resources to full other needs on the team until my QB options improve. But to offer you a second chance you can just be a guy on the team.
thought magic had dreads in the thumbnail lol
Steven A. 100% right when he said, the NFL owners feel it will effect their bottom line, it sounds good to me. It is a business after all. And with 70% of the NFL player being black it's obvious this has nothing to do with racism. Blacks will still try to interject race into the reason, but they always do that all the time.
The man went to the Superbowl, and the following year, went to the NFC championship game. He can ball-out with the best of em.
UNTIL HE'S BACK HIRED THE NFL IS FIRED IN MY HOUSE
White supremacy is the conscious or unconscious belief or the investment in the inherent superiority of some, while others are believed to be innately inferior. And it doesn't demand the individual participation of the singular bigot. It is a machine operating in perpetuity, because it doesn't demand that somebody be in place driving.\nMichael Eric Dyson\nIt doesn't exist!
Naw answer his question. What did he do that was so bad?
LMFAO!\nThey are asking the opinion of snoop lion, snoop dog or whatever his name is.  This guy made a living by rapping about violence and fucking hos. I guess they have to get the opinion of the average black man.
Good thing Colin had some skills because he's about the ugliest MF in football.
If us working people brought our politics  into work and cost the boss MONEY  we'd be out on my ass real quick
The NFL will be just fine without Colin Kaepernick.
People seem to forget that Colin Kaepernick grew up in a white family and a town that is basically all white in Turlock California. Why isn't anybody talking about that. And I live 20 minutes north of Turlock and I used to work there and I can tell you in equivocal that town is very Prejudice towards so-called minorities. I was working at a grocery store called Save Mart back in 2005 just helping out for 2 months because I worked in Modesto and these people acting like that never seen a black guy before I felt like I stepped into the sixties..
cilon krapdick is a nigger and so is poop dog
CHARLOTTVILLE ? REALLY SNOOP ...WHAT ABOUT MISSOURI or EVEN MIAMI 🤔😏\n#GTFOH
I'm good on football, I'll just catch the Raider highlights
well since you all backing up mr colin kaepernick...let me ask you all the same question...why kaepernick didn't do this kneeling shit when barack obama was in office for 8 fucking years?
It was peaceful that's why
This is a stupid question of Kaepernick not being on a roster. Just say, Listen, we want to test you to see whether or not we conform you to our opinion on issues so you can keep your money. It doesn't matter, it's not an issue, and both Snoop and Magic should just say, I'm making money and making moves and I'll hire Kaep and he doesn't need to risk CTE or ridicule. It's a stupid set-up question and I can't give you guys all this money without making you think like me. Here's the money, say what I tell you to say. Yeah, we are going to pretend like this is a casual conversation... HAHAHAHA!!!
Most all Protest by BLM is not peaceful. So what is your point Snoop? Looting, Vandalism, murder, and so on should be overlooked for a righteous cause. Uh, No!
I personally don't agree with his kneel during the anthem but the fact that he exercised the 1st amendment is what I respect. That takes real courage and especially since he's a good quarterback, he should be on an NFL team. Plus I can name players off the top of my head that have done far worse things and violent things as opposed to a completely peaceful protest so that's inexcusable for the NFL.
ESPN is a fucking disgrace u have a scumbag like snoop who make a video about killing Donald Trump and people should take he's black ass seriously fuck out of here.
Tom Savage lasted two quarters before getting pulled. \nMatt Moore didn't even get a chance to be the starter when Tennehill went down.\nMark Sanchez  is the third string QB on the bears.\nGeno Smith broke his jaw on his team-mate's fist but is good enough to backup Eli.\nBut Kaep can't even get an interview. The NFL is just 32 billionaires making money on the backs of people willing to destroy their bodies. There are 30 players in the NBA with guaranteed contracts of more than $100m. There are zero in the NFL.
the moral of the story here is snoop dog set up and got 2pac murdered in Las Vegas 1996 and got away with murder twice.
All this because of some fat, overweight, ugly, donut sucking white assholes
The problem is that he isn't good enough to be worth the distractions he will bring. If he was a Tom Brady or an Aaron Rogers, teams would sign his ass in a heartbeat.
He's not on a team because he's not worth the distraction he'll bring. Blaine Gabbert was starting over this dude
Stick to sports espn
Msespn at it again
When did ESPN become SJWN?
Snoop almost Snitched! :-)
Craig Hodges
Racist people hate kap #FUCKracistPatriots
Kaepernick gon end up broke.
White Supremacy is Americas TRUE Tradition.
Colts, Jets, Broncos, Jaguars, etc need him asap
Snoop and MJ = racists
echo chamber
Colin sucks
Liberal espn, colin is a scrub.
Magic sound out of touch asf.
Collin kaepernick has the right to protest. With that said, these owners have the right not to sign his ass if they don't want him. No matter what you believe or what you do, actions have consequences. You don't have to like it but that's just the way it is.
Whats up with Snoops face???? ive never seen him with that much makeup on
LOL the retards in commenting are being so dishonest. None of these guys know shit about football.\nKaepernick is a backup, or a starter on a bottom 5 team at best. Once you look at all the negative publicity he brings with him it's no surprise whatsoever no team wants him. Miami would've signed him, but wait huge Cuban population who hate Kaepernick because of his Castro support ( pretty disgusting, I mean the guy was a genocidal dictator ). Also, the Ravens were set to sign him, and his gf sends out a racist as f tweet that ruined the deal, as Ray Lewis has been attesting to.\nThere are studies that have been done showing the NFL's loss in viewership was directly tied to these anthem protests, so if a player is already bad and does this shit, none of you can act shocked or disgusted when they get cut.\nThe owners have a vested interest in keeping viewership up. Capitalism only cares about making money, it doesn't care about your skin color or your sexuality morons
What these rich bozos don't understand is that the middle class OVERWHELMINGLY disagrees with Kaepernick's tactics. They see it as disrespect toward our military. So regardless of the truth in his protest, MOST, and yes, MOST, sports fans see it as disrespectful. Stop trying to twist it into a race thing because it ain't.
We all know what's up by now right? Let those in this country continue to hide their racism and bigotry behind false beliefs, and let's continue to call them out and expose them for what they truly are. Make America great, this time!
Colin is a fkn bullshitter. He wanted attention. Once he needed a contract he stands up fkn sell out
Kap = trash!!\n\n#FuckBlackLivesMatter!!!
Colin kap is trash and cant lead a decent offense. Hes a distraction disrepcting our anthem and flag. Fuck that wanna be hood rat. Dude is whiter than micheal rappaport under that little tan of his.
Something isn't right here Snoop Dogg clean cut and not high the world is going to hell
Kaepernick doing it just to impress his pretty girlfriend from ISIS
When will the race baitors of ESPN realize Kap is a garbage QB? Sure some QBs in the league are trash; replacing trash with trash just leaves you with the same old trash
Is chicken not a normal chip flavour for some countries? Mind blown. Also, it's crinkle cut not ruffles 😚😚
I'm not used to Ketchup being a weird flavour of chip!
I saw one that's called... lists half the flavors lololol
when you live near Bega lolol its pronounce BEE-GA
My favourite is sweet chilli and sour cream! Red rock deli for life
That's funny lol grace didn't like the chilli chips
So I'm Australian and I've forever thought that bega cheese was pronounced beqa, I thought the G was a Q. At first I thought 'silly Americans mispronouncing our cheese' but then I googled it and my life has been built on a lie
Brooks! I only like plain potato chips, but I'd be willing to try weird flavors for him.
I really want some fucking chips now...
her voice cracks are so cUTE
The most surprising part was that you guys didn't know what Peri Peri is!!!!
Now I have all these chips, these treasures I died at that part 😂 This was honesty one of my favorite videos and made me laugh when I needed too. So thank you Grace! ❤️ Also I'm not going to lie your scratchy voice sounded so cute (sorry if that sounds weird) And your hair looks amazing and you are just gorgeous. Sending all my love xoxo
YEEEEEESSSS BEGA FLAVOUR IS BACK?!?!?!?! FUCK YEEEEESSSSSSS!
Eeahahaha Brooks
Oh a ruffle. so casual lolol
Did anyone else die laughing at the pronunciation of Bega?? Australia represent
You missed the classic addictive original Pringle
Mine are honey soy chicken (red rock deli), they are bloody amaaaazinggggg! Glad you enjoyed Melbourne darl x
Ketchup chips taste like dirt to me :/ Cheese and onion forever :) Red rock deli is fab too
drunk me *loves* those lime and black pepper chips.
I WAS IN THE CROWD AND I CAN SEE MYSELF
Bega is pronounced like it's spelt, with an E not an A. You said it like Baga ahaha
i love how she called the powerade/gatorade blue juice kasdfljlsdfjk
If you're still in Melbourne go to Pelligrini's it is THE best italian restaurant and the best coffee in Melbourne please enjoy <3\n(if you go do a video or something I will figuratively die)
hey he was on snl
You guys don't have chicken chips??? Wtf it's like a staple in nz
It's beqa with a q. I'm Australian clearly 😂😂
do you not have nandos in the US?
Normally Nz and Ozzie food is the same but these chips are all unknown to me except lime and black pepper
this just made me really feel like chips tbh hahaha
Woah I never realised other countries didn't have honey soy chicken chips!!!! There like a classic here
Us Australians  need to make Vegemite chips
Its actually pronounced Bekah (its a q not g) and its a brand of cheese here in Australia
as a korean i really need soy sauce flavored crisps in my life
HAHAHAHA I'm from Aus and it's beqa
I miss all of those flavours! Canada's chip game is weak in comparison. Those Kettle chilli chips are the king of chips! Did you try Light & Tangy Lays chips? They are also really good.
What the F is going on in the mirror behind you?!
Lol I hope you actually liked it here in Australia
Ohhh cheese and onion is the besssst
Omg it's bee-gah (bega!). And pls try the correct brand of honey soy 😂
You didn't get the good Honey Soy!
I love all of these chips !!\nOh and it's oi not oy
bega is a brand of cheese so it was cheese flavoured
I lost my shit when I realised mature cheddar cheese and chive literally is just sour cream and onion 😂😂
I live in Australia. I love ur vids btw 💞💞💞💞❤️
Honey soy chicken is my go to drunk chip packet!!!!!
The Beqa one is cheese. Beqa is a brand of cheese.
Mine are barbecue, cheese & onion and light & tangy, but i can't get with those regular cheddar flavours. \nAnd chicken I can't stand, it really tastes nothing like it. It just tastes like bad memories...
the way brooks says bega though  😂 😂
But what flavours are in the USA?????
It's pronounced Bega as In beeegaaaah like a bumble bee
Aww, you guys didn't get the right Honey Soy Chicken chips. Red Rock Deli is to die forrrrrrrr
Interesting that she things all our chips are super sweet when that's usually what people say about American food... I wanna try American chips now.
please do more of this grace until food network gives you your own show 😂😂 😍😘
I CANNOT believe you didn't like the lemon pepper chips! They're literally the best thing i've ever put it my mouth
I'm Aussie and it's so weird watching this coz all the flavours are just normal to me
I wish they tried light and tangy cause honestly what is that but its so good
we have all those flavours in England too!! they're all too nice!! you have to try a nandos- to die for!
the slow roasted onion and mustard is goood. also it's beqa with a Q and it's a brand of cheese
Mate , if you are going to eat honey soy chicken ships you HAVE to get the red rock deli brand, all the others cannot be compared lol
Americans don't know what peri peri is? it's so common in the Uk 😂
Why does this make me want to devour 20 bags of chips??
What's on fire in the mirror?
My name being peri was very confusing in this video... was I named after a flavor ??
We have pizza too 🤦🏽‍♂️\nPaprika was my favourite ridiculous Canadian chip flavour 🇨🇦
Thought it was Hulk Hogan in the thumbnail.
I've been to the US and you guys have way more chips than us Aussies do. Shit like BBQ Chicken Fairy Floss Hubba Bubba Mint Chocolate Oreo Red Pepper Sriracha Gun Powder Cheetos
Us Aussies live off our chicken salt (no it doesn't actually taste like chicken just like... a lot... of salt)
Yo where in the fuck was thins light & tangy tho?
As an Aussie I laughed my ass off at this.
I am a little mad she copied liza koshys 2nd chanle video😒but what ever she is used to doing that anyway😐
perth?
We normally call ketchup tomato sauce.
Bega is an actual town in NSW (New South Wales) Australia, but its known for its CCCHHHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSEEEEE. The actual cheese is real good, not sure about the chips though. Half of them I haven't actually seen before but I am a very antisocial person...... and also, peri peri is like chilli sauce sorta... yea. \n\n\nMy personal fav is honey soy chicken by red rock deli.
Omg Bega cheese 🤣 haha I use to go to the factory as a kid and pat & cuddle the cows 🐮
gotta cleanse my pallet *sips a power aid*
Ita kicking my tongue with flavor
Where'd ya get that squirrel ring??
In Japan there's a salad flavor that tastes nothing like salad, but I actually really like it.
I'm from Bega (pronounced BEE-GA) and Bega cheese is massive in Australia. My boyfriend works at the cheese factory and makes the cheese. So surreal to see my tiny town on your YouTube channel!!!
Mama Mia got me EVERY time
I just came here to say Fuck Meghan Rienks and Grace Helbig;) I didn't watch the video;)
You should've been more Australian and done flavour of shapes or Tim tams
(347) 563-4092 this is graces number you are all welcome call her a lot so she can make a video on it
I am so shook. I had no idea that all those flavours were not totally normal.....
Show lots of feet plsss.make my day amazing again
These are pretty much regular flavours in Canada
You don't have cheese and onion crisps in the US?!?!
Good vídeo.
Bega is pronounced 'Beega'
Smiths, you know you love em
It's pronounced bee-ga btw :P
Moshroom
red rock deli honey soy chicken is my fave

great job monster!! you protected your mother..
Please do a over-the-knee boots styling video please! Absolutely love your style :)
Your jumper is SO cute!!😍😍
Amelia, you are always so well put together and stylish but I feel like during the Fall/Autumn season your style is especially stunning and elevates to a whole new level. I love that you still incorporate dresses/skirts (my fave) and do looks that are outside of the typical jeans and leather jacket. Always look forward to your fall/winter lookbooks.
Duke is a naughty bunny-humping monkey!!!! \nAlso, love your jumper & your hair is lovely. 😊
I freakin love Amelia!!
Duke stole the show!LOL!

Yay more vids
Yassss! Haul time! ❤
You look gorgeous!

Where are ur earrings from?
Love you
Haha Duke is amazing 😂
I don't like sweater shedding on the winter coat. It is so hard to clean. I also did a fall haul on my channel. Check it out if interested. :)
That was hilarious!!! Duke👌🏻👌🏻
Duke had me laughing out loud! So cute!!
OMG Duke humping the bunny! I laughed so much and had to show my BF.
I need that scarf. Scroll down quick quick👍
Do you wear heels on a daily basis? Like just going to meetings and stuff like that? :)
Duke was the star of the show!! Lol,love your videos/vlods,thanks
Duke hahaha oh my he is too cute! 💕I love your looks so much! Over the knee boots are beautiful!
That tularosa jumper! Do you find is soft and warm enough? I'm considering buying it but I'm afraid it would be itchy aswell.
In love with her dog!! 😍😍
I levee the look with the over the knee boots !!!😍✨
Lmao the bunny, is getting violated! Great video
Love the red scalloped button down skirt you paired with the cream jumper? May I know where it's from?
Your vlogs are my favourite ones on YouTube, please do more
Great haul, I have been looking for a high waisted skirt to wear with thigh high boots and after seeing you in these I think I definitely must have one in my life!!! You looked amazing xx
Where's the bunny from?
Gorgeous as always! May I ask what is the nail polish u are wearing in the talking part of the video? I am obsessed!!
your makeup looks SO GOOD!! The colors in your jumper compliment your face beautifully
FYI, dogs can do that when they are feeling stressed.
Dog humping, for the win
ohh Amelia, just let Duke have some fun....he is totally adorable!!!! gold love him :)
I love those hoop earrings. Do you mind telling me where you got them? Love your style. 😘💖
Could you do an accessories video
Wow fabulous haul. Some really stunning pieces. Can't wait to see some of these in the flesh.
Any haul that includes cute snuggly jumpers is just the best 🙌🏻
Amelia you are my favorite xoxo such a good job
You have great style
I love that orange lip. You look great in it. Super for fall. I don't think I've ever seen you in a color like that. You wear it well esp. with your hair color and colors of your ward robe. I really love it! \nPoor Duke. No more bunny for him......
Amelia... That lace skirt thooooooooo!!! That gave me sooooo MUCH life!!!! Lovely, lovely haul, but that was my fav. That Chloe bag also- so chic and the details are just perfect!!! Gracias :-)
Love this video! And your channel!! 😍 Wouldn't normally do this but I'm new here and would love for people to subscribe ☺️ Xx
This was such a good haul! Could you do a fall look book and include the high waisted skirts with sweaters? I think that look is so cute and would love your ideas! Your style is so cute, love your videos! :)
Oh I love that Revolve Jumper - that colours! The only thing I don't get ist the price for Acryl/Polyester/Nylon. Pfffff....it'ts H&M Quality overprized. But yeah, I would probably still buy it
You have the best Style! You look pretty in all Outfits! Love from Germany
Duke = the cutest guest star ever!💗🐶💗
Loved everything but I totally need that\n self-portrait skirt in my life!!
You're one of my favourite YouTubers, I loved this video so much!!
Oh how i miss this haul&try on video from you ! Beautiful as always , amelia. Love ❤️
does anyone know where the top she wore at the outro is from? :)
How do you buy Tularosa in the UK? Do you just pay customs?
Amelia, can you please do a hair routine video or blog post. From wet hair to styling. I would really like to learn how you take care and style of your beautiful hair
what lipstick are you wearing at the end?! :o its beautiful xxx
Your hair is so pretty 😍
Hey Amelia! Do you spray your suede boots with water resistant spray?? 💋
just cant deal with how pretty you are xx love your videos especially the vlogs xx
Duke is adorable! My pomeranian Sebastian humps his toys as well 🙈🙄 Love your choices for fall! Would love to know where you got that frilly dress from that was not a part of the haul! 😘💕
What's your watch? I'm obsessed
Omg I missed you so much I didn't even realise
Where is your sweater from?
Long live Chloe Paddington bag!
I'd give anything to be able to afford your style. I love it and u
Duke was such a Highlight in this Video! Also thanks for adding the sizes, I feel like we are kind of similar shapes and I can't wait for more videos 😍😍
Your voice is so annoying!
Duke needs  a girlfriend
More money than sense. The dog was very funny though!
I have been wanting to ask you this for so long.... where can I find your glasses?! I want them!
The jumper is so adorable where is it from 😍😍
Where is your turquoise bangle that you always wear from? It is honestly so stunning 😍💠
Could anyone help me and tell me how much custom and duties I can expect to pay on a revolve order to Europe (Belgium)?? Thanks!

This is the last of the three trial Basics videos! This pushed my quick-explanation skills to the limit, but I figure that slow down the video and replay if necessary is better than let people get bored...
I thought it was: take the most common words, assign a brand new character to each of them, and insert whenever that character comes up.
@0:52 haha send the wrong worms? nice one!
Really amazing video quality. Something very different this time. I love your channel...
What is the work joke? I don't get it
... send the wrong worms. Ha! I see what you did there!
0:54 Worms ahahahah I see what you did there
Hi Tom, thanks for these! We spoke a while back about doing some videos like this for GCSE Computer Science students, this is perfect. Hope the trial goes well and you fancy doing some more :-)
haHA!!! Worms. I don't get it?
Love it when a youtube video makes me feell like I lerned something. Tbank you, Tom
sending the wrong WORMS  haha , I see what you dis there !
great video!  I have been wondering this for quite a while (but been too lasy to look it up ...)
Hoffman ripped off Euclid but a search tree is a elemtry algorithm
The lossy compression bit was brilliant. Making it look compressed at the right time.
I, too, hate it when I end up sending the wrong worms.
No need to make Unicode seem more complex than it is. The ascii characters have the same code points in Unicode. Unicode just gives you more including characters for other languages. Could just say they are stored as extended sequences which in UTF-8, they are.
I've always wondered how this works, this is amazing!
this feels like something quantum computers could speed up, i dont know though it just seems like it
That's a numberwang!.. Oh wait, nice explanation.
Useful information. I definitely learned something today. Thanks!
i expected better research from this channel. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is Will Smith's magnum opus.
Why no advanced videos on Computers?  I already read about all this stuff.
WE WANT MORE!! doesnt have to be basic but just MOOORRRREE
I'm sorry, but Wild Wild West is not Will Smith's Magnum Opus. Everyone knows that's Summertime.
What do you have against Will Smith?
So cool! Would love to see one with a breakdown about zip files.
This was so interesting and good. Wanted it to keep going!
And I can apply Huffman to save the Huffman tree, and the Huffman code, or again. So actually  we are just trading space for work, right? Or storing information into work? That's cool. Maybe it's what the universe is doing right now, unveiling its stored  Huffman code through chemical reactions.
Yeah, cool stuff. I'll just keep using my golang gzip/(whatever your preference is) library since I'm trusting scientists to do this for me. Seriously, I'm too busy actually building things irl to re-invent the wheel just for fun.
I wrote a full on huffman compressor for fun once. I was disappointed that it only yielded about, like you see here, 30% compression (leaving 70% the original size.) I figured I did something wrong.
I read the thumbnail as “How Computers Computers Text”
As usual, darned fascinating! Please continue with the series. I know _some_ stuff but I'm learning lots!
Always wanted to say that I love your voice, Tom. This is actually the reason why I subbed.
Can we please get into foreign characters?
You should keep doing this kind of videos, it was enjoyable and really informative - don't get me wrong I always learn something from your vids, but this was one of a kind-
I love this channel so much
Tom, thank you for reminding mr how good Youtube can be.
Cnt u leve out ltrs nd jst hve a way to ad thm in at th end? So long as ech wrd is uniq or has cntxt clus?
Wow I can hear the buzz from the old monitors that's funny
This guy is vsauce IT edition
Now i understand why windows have 64 bits and 32 bits.. \nwow thanks sir!! :D\nEdit: by that i mean\n64^64 or 32^32 bits \nRight? :)
where did you get two working BBC model B computers? - haven't see one for a couple of decades
I love you and your vimeos.
xz -9ev some_huge_file.txt  (now let's wait a few days)
0:50 Otherwise you wind up sending the wrong worms\nI see whatcha did thar...
Next vid will be intermediate and cover zip files.\n\nThe way you explain things makes everything easy to understand!
So you're telling me Will Smith *wasn't* rapping about the Wild Wild West wiki I'm sure exists about that movie?
This one of only two things I remember from my programming module - the other is a habit of typing both the open and close brackets at the same time.
i think i understood that...
I like the series
If you break in to house and steal cold cuts out of fridge are you then a hamburglar
You missed range and arithmetic encoding :-)
Nice job with this...
Tom! This video leaves me wanting for so much more!!
now do GZIP/7z/RAR... jpg/png/bmp... mp3/wav/ogg... i gots to know
what ya gonna do when you hit 1mill subs?\nPS really love the series
Can't wait for the video on zip files :)
Or as it's known today; Huffcod.
I feel like an expert
I hate it when I send the wrong worms
I love this series. If you decide to continue, I would be very much for it!
These series are great, Tom. You have a knack for explaining complicated concepts intuitively without losing what's important. Do you use any unconventional techniques for understanding the concepts deeply enough to capture the gist of them like this? My current strategy is reading and trying to incorporate the concept in my current knowledge base, but it usually takes 2-3 readings to do.
I know about this stuff already but still watch it because Tom Scott is a good lad
This is magic. I've just finished my text compression algorithm in C++ the day before yesterday, and this video was uploaded. I feel I'm being observed.
cool story bro, gotta split mid video to go watch the will smith music video
Ha! a love the send the wrong worms :-)
Awesome presentation....inspired by you...I am an IT engineer...:wanna start my tech channel too after viewing your video and fan base....wish me good luck ☺️☺️☺️
Belatedly: That was really clear and comprehensible! It didn't feel too quick at all to me - it was all straightforward and easy (for me) to understand. Good job!
One shot, no jumpcut, that's amazing.
0:54\n\ndid he just say the wrong worms instead of the wrong words?
A note about image/video compression at 0:45 : there are a lot of lossless compression methods, especially for images. You don't typically deal with uncompressed lossless files (e.g. bmp, the netpbm formats, raw images), but rather png (more or less row by row zip compression), gif (lossless if you fit the 256 color palette) or other lossless images.
This guy's content is just as good if not better than Thoughty2 so how come that bloke has more than twice the subscribers?
Whoever did your makeup did a terrible job.
0:53 idk whether its intentional or not, or maybe i heard him wrong, Tom said the worng worms instead of the worng words i thiing its intentional, and it makes me like Tom even more. keep up the great vids!
the Huffman coding was one of the questions in algorithm test last semester and everybody got a different answer at the end. it seems easy but the calculations are a bit confusing especially if you're not allowed to use calculators.
I had to write this algorithm for one of my CS classes...using ADA.
That was very interesting...the more you know eh?
0:54 I see what you did there :D
0:50 ...sending the wrong *worms*  I see what you did there =D
Why can't I give you 5 likes for this video :-(
THANK YOU TOM SCOTT!! I have wondered how compression like this worked for the better part of a decade, and I've even put a decent amount of time into researching it, but it never clicked until this video.  You have the best content on this entire platform, both in subject matter and quality.
Can you please do videos based on computer science 2210 whole theory syllabus? I really need help with my exams which are on October. I hope you see this message. Please like this so he can see. I never comment on YouTube videos. And I really want to get good results on this exam. My computer teacher sucks. I'm desperate.😭
The only thing better than being the best is mathematically proving you are the best.
sending the wrong worm haha
Wah Huffman Coding is so clever...
3:30 – *Finally* , after three and a half minute of blah, blah, blah!! Now, *TELL IT!!!!*
'worms' see what you did there
So is the tree itself somehow stored in the file? What's the syntax of that?
That's a great idea!
Loved this. I was wondering where the other 2 episodes were but turns out I've accidentally already seen them. Love you Tom! Keep up the good stuff x
great series Tom. keep them coming !!!
.otherwise you end up sending the wrong worms... haha very good.
A basics video with two machines who you programmed in 'basic'. Brilliant.
the wrong worms 😂
Damn Tom, number 23 on trending. Grats!!
Please Remove Background Noise
Op nj a senf wreng worms
Did he just?
I want more
Nobody seems to be addressing the elephant 🐘: how is the tree stored and how is it read?
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD KEEP MY HAIR THIS DARK AHH! What do yous reckon!? Also once again THANK YOU for getting my book to number 2 in the bestsellers chart for non-fiction, mind blown :) Free worldwide shipping on it here if you're interested: https://www.bookdepository.com/Fully-Functioning-Human-Almost-Melanie-Murphy/9781473639164
I love your hair it's gorgeous❤️❤️
I kinda have a crush on you
You're trying to be cool,stylish and edgy...but you ended up looking like a cast of Dumb and Dumber.
I LOVE the dark hair and the shorter bangs
Loving the hair! Suits you so much 💚
I LOVE your hair, Melanie!
Your hair looks incredible!!!! Wash in cold water and try not to wash every day for color preservation. Also, a color saving shampoo. :) Omg. It looks great!
Do you live in Ireland
I absolutely love the hair! It works really well on you!
omg your hair is soooo beautifull!!!! i had the same a few weeks ago :-D xxxx
I just finished reading your book, it's very useful ! I'm from France I met you last sunday in belfast, I told you I'm preparing an English exam,, and your book helped me a lot  to improve my English ! If you're still in Paris enjoy french food 💚  ( sorry for my English)
I love your hair! I may be bias as I generally prefer women with darker hair...But it really suits you.\nAlso I hope you & your family have a fantastic holiday.
LOOK DEAR, ISS LIKE THIS.... IT'S NOT FAVOURITE, IT'S FAVORITE. NOT ONLY THAT BUT AUTMUN SOUNDS TOTALLY MEDIEVAL , THE WERD YER LOOKIN' FER IS FALL.\n\nYOU IRISH REALLY GOTTA STOP TALKIN' LIKE LIMEYS (LOLOLOLOL).
Hi sweet melanie😍i'm so happy that you're in love again😙good luck and have fun in paris💖
Only good Irish youtuber along with dramatic mac tbh 😹👌
immediately thought of Louisa when I saw the tights! that movie is such a favorite of mine, and so is this channel. feels so cosy watching your videos ♡ so happy for all of the sucess that your book has had and really hope you get to number one! loads of love from Algeria, and by the way your hair is definitely unique I like the change xoxo ♡
Melanie, your new hair cut looks amazing! I wish I could pull this off!
You are so incredibly beaut!! ❤❤❤ is the natural cycles app a one of payment of £50 for the whole year? Paranoid I'll be getting that out my account every month :p xxx
People give Conor McGregor so much shit but look where he's come in the space of 5 or so years. His growth mind set is amazing and as Irish people i think we need to embrace confidence and growth :)
My initial honest thought is that I thought you suited your older hair better. Yet saying that you still look fabulous with the new hair, you seem to so easily pull off different shades of brown and black
I love ur hair!! It really suits you 😍😍
Your hair looks very attractive! Red rocks! :-)
keep the color. Your hair looks Fuller and healthier 😍
Your new hair is INSANE, wish I had the confidence to pull that off, really suits you <3
Mustard clothing are my favourite! Especially my mustard tights they are beautiful. makes me giggle that my blanket on my sofa match my legs when I wear them. ^_^
I wondered if you've read up on PMDD? It's similar to PMS but with more severe psychologic symptoms, it's something I've been researching and I've realised it's what I suffer from. As a person who also has anxiety and gets panic attacks it was quite difficult to make the link as I thought all of my symptoms were a combination of PMS and anxiety but through reading into it, it's obvious to me that that is what I have. Would love to see a video on how PMS makes you feel, more tips on how you deal with it and have us all have a chat about it in the comments because whether it be PMS or PMDD it can be very negative and lonely going through it. Ps, I love the new hair x
I just adore you-- so raw and so friendly. Watching your videos is like sitting down with a friend!
I LOVE THE HAIR!!!! red suits you so much <3
LOVE the hair the dark roots and the red are awesome love love it 💚💚💚💚💚
love your hair colour soooooo much! please do makeup favorite, it's been a while and i'd like to know makeup products u use nowadays... please do... please do... please doooo~\n\nlove you,\nXOXO
The red hair + green eyes -- heart throb! I'm dead, you're so gorgeous
Wish the Natural Cycles app was actually free 😕. I've been on my period for over two months now because I'm coming off my Chemotherapy and thought it would be nice after. Oh well!
Definitely think you should ride this hair color and cut out; it looks fantastic on you. I'm also slightly biased because I have done autumn colors in my very dark hair too. haha. Also looking forward to reading your book.
Please keep your hair it's beautiful !!! 😍😭 the dark mixed with red is so beautiful and suits you so much you look like a babe 🌹
My favorites this month is definitely you hair, it looks super amazing and you look super gorgeous with it 😍
I'd advise you to keep your colour, you look great in that red! Will your book be available in itunes at some point?
I giggled at strap on and it made me so happy when you did too :P
You are literally my dream girl and you look beautiful with dark or light hair. You look amazing. :)
Love your hair ah so amazing !!! Enjoy a different  Styles  girls go for it!
I'm kind of sad/confused because I saw a bunch of stuff about McGregor being really racist, and I would be sad to think that Mel supports that. Obviously I'm assuming you/Melanie didn't know about it because everything I've watched from her has led me to see her as a beautiful, accepting, hilarious, intelligent and talented individual. I was just really loving this video (and for quite a while her whole channel as well) up to that point, so seeing her give him a shoutout kind of caught me off guard. Maybe I'm getting biased info, but from what I''ve read he's a bigot... or at least not the man he appears to be from her description ... I hate that this is the first comment I've made on one of her videos, but I thought it was important. Side note: Please know that I love Melanie and all of her videos/work.
I'm getting your book for my birthday
I love your hair Melanie :D xxx
It's nice to have a way that genuinely tells you when you're fertile or not. I hate the blanket just always wear a condom or sustain shite, when I know that I'm not fertile for majority of the time and I have sex almost every day with the same person.
It's GROWING on you - hehe, I see what you did there (also it looks awesome, reminds me of Betty Page)
Wow!! You look great. I love your hair.
Love the hair, and love you!
Your hair is very pretty :)
Finally figured out one of the person you reminded me of. It’s Rachel Weisz in The Mummy.
that shorter fringe is bomb 👌 suits you so well
to please your loved one???
I just got the same camera because I'm going to Harry Potter world at universal studios

I bloody love your hair!!!😍👌🏻
loving the hair, it brings out your beautiful eyes <3
I love the red on you but I think all one colour is always better, I don't love ombré ! You're bloody stunning either way though x
You should try full red hair 💗 omg you would look soooo beautiful
I'm so excited for my birthday on Sunday for the soul reason that I'm going to be getting your book and Neil Hilbourns book 😍 I can't wait
MEL I just really want to be your friend ❤️ you look fab btw

:(((( not even rage just a big sigh
in real life, nobody walks in front of a guy aiming a gun\nin a video game, the rules of common sense change...
Legend has it he's still exhaling
A siege video is trending? Boys, *We. Have. Made. It.*
Thats kind of satisfying
The amout of bots in this comment section is retarded
Why is this fucking recommended to me, fuck everything about YouTube and it's cunts
Jesus christ the porn bots here... Save us! Someone!
I laughed more at the sigh😂😂😂
This must happen a lot in this game 😂 I love how casual he is about it like  Just shot my team mate in the head.... No problem let me just get this peeker. Welp thats a double kill TEAM KILLING OFFENSE  Yeah yeah whatever just start the ban
omg this is hilarious thank you for posting
oh man ahahhaha the motion of the hands when they die. made me laugh in real life ahha
You poor soul, I don't even play this shitty game and I pity you lol
Were they the enemies body guards or something? Who watches their team mate get killed then decides do the same thing.
I don't get it.
Good thing this was cas.
not only one runs by but two.......TWOOOOOOO
Anyone else think this is the dumbest thing to happen in existence?
Heros die everyday and there was no Mercy here to save this mans soul
That would make me so fucking pissed
Welcome to rainbow 6 siege where your teammates are your worst enemies.

This video is funny as hell, you earned a sub 😊😊

Dear people! take your time to check out my latest video WASTED! on my channel. The video features continuous remix personally created by myself, and it's comprised of 16 high-quality tracks. The pop/trance hybrid mix will can give you both chill and blast on Friday nights! Please share and like, and thank you for your support!
When you say I'm going to get the ace😂😂😂
I keep on rewatching over and over. This is art.
what game is this
4 people on team 2 die 1 kicked. Other team celebrating. While the last person is like wtf just happened
Just imagine being on the other team and seeing that, no point shooting at them, they already took themselves out
2 shots, 2 kills, aimbot confirmed, instant vac-ban
XD
BEGONE THOTS
Lol
Awww u mofo
and then queue the space jam music
HACKER!!! lol   as you always read in the comments while playing... no one likes a good shot. no one....
See someone aiming... Proceeds to walk in front. Clever.
Well then...
Trash
Ah, the joys of a FPS...
This video makes my life. This is my 13th reason why
this was funny but at the same time unfortunate... :/
I love this. I have it on loop.
This is why I don't play online anymore
What game is this?
This is my new favourite video of all times .
My gosh. I feel your pain man.
Accidentally kill his own teammates. If I get kill by someone who is trying to kill a enemy then accidentally kills me I'll know it was a accident.
Quietly laughing in my bed , watching this. I can relate so much.
and this is why you don't wander into peoples line of fire
When the anti-spawn killer becomes the spawn killer.
That's just funny as shit
That sigh had me choking on air.
Ahhhhhhhhh \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is painful to watch
Uh..... rainbow in the trending? That new... I guess they had to cover up the pewdiepie video 💁🏻‍♂️
Who is here from reddit?
Guys, watch me take out this broad side of a barn\n\n*Kills all of his teammates 5 times each*
Lol someone made a meme about this😂😂😂

Make Cake AVENGERS !!!
Zappacosta looks like zlatan lol
Epic goal from zappacosta
Come on Chelsea let's go on and win the champions league!!!!\nRight attitude 💕💕💕💕👏👏
Pedro doesn't score tap ins,only bangers
This new content is good man. Keep up the good work the team behind this official chelsea channel. \n\nProof that you guys do listen to fans and keep on improving!!!
I was there tonight, zappacosta goal was awesome in person 😏
Zappacosta looks like Bonucci & Chiellini 😁
Best club for ever! 💗🙏
Nice win, hope we can carry that form on in the champions league
PLS do funnel cams. And I was disappointed musanda was not playing or even on bench. Christiansen need to be starting 11 he was fantastic today. His better than cahill that the thing I don't like about antonio. BUT great win for us. zappacosta you absolute beauty. ARSENAL ARE YOU READY FOR US😛😛😂😂
Personally think Zappa is going for goal. That ball was too fast for a pass, not to mention the technique he used when kicking the ball, it was meant to be powerful.
what a goal from zlatan ibrah... i mean zappacosta😂
Oi Chelsea will win the champions league trust me I now
Zappacosta's adventure on Chelsea now BEGINS! 👏👏👏
Great win, but we played a club from Azerbaijan. No offense to any Qarabag fans.
black or white tweet 👍
Quem é brasileiro da up 👍
Zappacosta more like Zlatancosta!
Zappacosta is a best he's what we needed a proper LB
England is 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵 and Europe will soon be too!! COYB
I'm so christernson started
Zappacosta's goal was a terrible cross
Great work guys very entertains summary of this game. hopefully we will win it this year. come on Chelsea KTBFFH
thanks for the vids and do this more so i can watch highlight in official accounts! #COYB
Esse é o único canal de time que não mostras Bastidores nem nada, aff
Zappa 🔥😍
common chelsea 👏👏👏👏
legenda em português
Epic goal from Zlatan!
Yeaa cmon CHELSEA ✌✌✌🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎
Great win. But I just hope Cahill is on the bench for ALL big games in this season. Batshuayi too.
Only here to see the one day Chelsea fans that would say zappacosta should be starting ahead of Moses.
Zappacosta looks like the new Alonso! Now we just need a left wing back to compete with Alonso & a back up striker if Batman doesn't improve.
we need more goals against Roma and Atletico de madrid
Chelsea are firing on all cylinders.
Take us to Kiev!
See , Conte proved the world wrong by signing players that everyone thought would flop .When Bakayoko I thought he was gonna be benched but WOW .Then we have King ZAPACOSTA !
The content has improved loads! keep up the good work
Zappacosta's goal should be a contender for the puskas award.
Legend in a making
1unlike from fans other club?😁
There last night Shed End.. amazing night boys. Just got my tickets for the Roma game next month. Let's do this
CMON YOU BLUES!!! BEST LADS IN THE CL
THANK YOU CHELSEA FOR LISTENING TO US AND BRINGING US WORLD CLASS CONTENT.\n\nSOON TO BE THE BEST FOOTBALL CLUB ON YOUTUBE!!!!
Like if u believe Chelsea will win the champions league
YESSSSS now we're showing game footage instead of just audios and pics!
If Morata played he can score two goals or a hatrick
Why I always wanted zappacosta to join Chelsea
Really good performance from the new players 👍
Thank you Chelsea for the great win. Keep up the good work. Is there a new song about Zappacosta yet? Something to do with goal of the season, please.
i thought it was supposed to b a cross??
What a glorious goal by zappacostaaaaa !!!
I think the manager is doing great and am very happy. Since I am celebrating 22yrs of supporting the blue's
What's the name of the Background song?  Love it!!!
Cant wait to see Chelsea get tested against a real team. We look very good rn
what a goal from zap
hope we can beat AS Roma and Atletico with the same score 😎😎😎 c'mon CHELSEA!!! #ktbffh
Amazing performance by the BLUES!! thanks!  Come on #CHELSEA #CFC
Chelsea Is the best #Blues
Come on #Chelsea
Cahill looks like busquets lol
Zappacosta next ivanovic
Zappacosta was brilliant
Zappa Zappa Costa Zappa Costa costaaaaaaaaa
Start him over moses.
Why are we showing some of the goals, but others we have no clips for?
name of song?
classic zappacosta
Zappacosta scored a beauty!
Brilliant start for Chelsea 🔥 Zappacosta is amazing 🔥 💪 😁
zappacosta.. panic buy.. alonso, panic buy.. luiz panic buy.. i wonder how drinkwater performance.. haha
вперед Челси
Come on Chelsea 💙
One dislike, from Qarabag's goalkeeper
CHELSEA CHELSEA CHELSEA
merci conte .et merci le nouveau Costa
up chelsea
Increase the difficulty!
BAKA
zappacosta nice goal..wow
great video
Decent vid 👍💙
Zap ⚡️
We love chelsea😍
It was a great goal by Zappacosta, but I got a feeling it was unintentional. I think he was going for a cross.  lol
that 6-0 prediction
GOOOOL ZAPPACOSTA
C'mon blues
First
zappacosta better than moses
Hope you being A.Cole 2.0 :)
Good win lads but don't get too happy , we have arsenal next. Hoping for the win
Great win boys. A few things i saw that need change. 1st cahill needs to.be benched in the 15th min he made another red card tackle. He is past it bench and sell in january. 2nd moses to the bench zappacosta is better imo. 3rd michyi isnt a good backup he did nothing until he scored. He doesnt read the plays that willian and pedro run at all. All in all good win. I saw keep back 3 same as last 3 pl games bench moses and start hazard vs arsenal. KTBFFH
Chelsea fc cmon
WHO the hell is Qarabag??
Rudiger not that good when he play on right side of cb position.
What's the song the girl sang at 6:46 ?
Am I the only pentaholic who was triggered at 6:13 ?? I mean ugh... they put the Pentatonix I stead of Pentatonix
I would of walked out right when she said Portia. LMAO
I hope these cuties start a band together oh my lord <3
Pan sexual is just bi... you like both genders ?? No??
they are so compatible omg 😭😭 they laugh with each other and get along so well!! i need a friend like that
These 2 seem like they're ment for each other
Does anyone know her Facebook or IG? 😍
My God she's beautiful, interesting and intelligent
I can't express how amazing it was to hear another person talk about being demisexual
She looks like Ariana Grande on black verson🙄
you see
They are sooo cute
yEAS PENTATONIX
Who are these beautiful people😍😍
God she's so beautiful.
I thought they were gonna date
he's such a cutie and seems so innocent!
He's a cute gay guy
I love friendship like these 🙌🏻😊
He seems like such a good guy awh
The girl is so stunning omg
I would date them BOTH ! lool they both look gorgeous
Strange feeling, I thought they would date each other! Didn't understood why not?!
This was my favorite one so far
These two guys should be couples
Missed connection:\nMe, a 21 yo Female art student who identifies as pansexual and asexual\nYou, a 25 yo demisexual I saw in a soulpancake video \nHi how do i meet you 🙃
I had such a good cry after watching this video. I love that there are more and more black folks coming out as queer. I hope the older generations of black folks look at videos like these and see that we all want the same things; to love and be loved.
She kinda looks like a black Emma Watson
He isn't a woman so how does he know what woman need to be attracted to a guy 🙄
I don't see them together romantically but definitely as GOOOD friends
Was anyone else really happy they clicked really well??!
She is amazing and beautiful, so is he.
Snap judgement: She's so cute...I wanna be her friend.  The gay vibes are very strong with him.
Does Portia have a public insta? She's such a light!
She looks like Rihanna and they both saying no literally broke my heart
That man is sexy!!!
Can we please have an updateee ?
I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU TWO DONT BECOME BESTFRIENDS IMA FIND YALL
i totally ship them i wish they would date
What is up with all these 500 different sexual orientations tf
She is so beautiful!!
I need this man in my life
I laughed when they sing the Reba Theme Sing Survivorrrrr
*For those who are unaware. Pansexual means you are strictly attracted to Pan's.*
The woman is beautiful af
If Janelle Monae and Rihanna had a baby, she would be that offspring...
11:15 😂 ha, love that definition of demi-sexual \nshe's funny
I love her!  I want to be friends with her! 😂
I love these two people.
Someone find her IG PLEASE
He has a great voice !!!!
Go get married. They remind me of my Ma and pa
okay he mentioned PTX and I freaked out !!!
I love them So much!! I really like them as friends!!!
I want to do this
Well I consider myself a pizza. Beat that.
IDC THEY NEED TO GET MARRIED BYE
They were meant to be ❤️❤️
she is so beautiful
Why did I fall in love with Portia though. Like woah
I ship them so hard wtf im mad as hell. Hell no. No. This is not okay.
This made me so happy. Both of them seemed so nice
she really takes after Whitney Houston
gay guy or dates just non black chicks... sorry
They should have skipped all the questions and talk about what they would name their kids because they are soulmates 😂
Pentatonix is my fave group besides tøp but oml I love them too.
PLOT TWIST!!!
she needs a strong black woman and he needs a white gay community leader who wants to build a family.
I think I just realized my sexuality..thank you 👍😂 I like the mind to
Pansexual is just a fancy way of saying you're bi, lol what is with these tumblr made up sexuals
He's a living breathing human zombie!!!😂😂 he is attracted to your BRAIN!!!
You are not Native American LMAO . You're black be proud of that. That's like when white people say they're Native American when they look straight from Britain lmao
Omg this was so misleading. I was %100 sure they were going to make a match, I mean look at them sing in the beginning.
love them. their harmonies sound great
his voice is beautiful
they are so cute
They actually sounded good singing together
shes a perfect mix of Rihanna and Janelle Monáe
HES SOOOOOO PERFECT 😻😻
They harmonize SO well 😍
She looks like Rhianna
Are you nervous?\nHella\nMEEEE
6:38 dannnnggggggg
The Pentatonix 
This episode was slightly cringe
I love Pentatonix 😍
Love her hair
Love these guys
😂
OMG DATE U PERFECT HUMAN BEINGS
THAT WAS SO CUTE AWWWW
Yassss reba
YES OMG WHEN HE SAID PENTATONIX I SCREAMED YAS QUEEENNNNNNNN
Damn. So cute!
Only atracted to demi Lovato😂
I love them!
That skin 😍
CUTEST and FUNNIEST one yet!! 😍😂😍😂
The Pentatonix THE CRINGE
I don't consider this a celebrity makeup line. I consider it a legit makeup line that happened to be created by a celebrity.
Fenty beauty really hit the mark with being inclusive with this line. I love seeing super pale and super deep girls getting excited about a line that's catered to them. The gloss I think is my fav, I love universal colours that look amazing on everyone!
Girlllll the gloss and highlight!! 😍😍
I feel like this was a pretty good review. Like I didnt get that kiss-ass- vibe. Seemed genuine. Thank you.
how does your self tanner look so good????? could you do a video girl
its very drying ... you look beautiful
Please do a tutorial on how u color your hair.
when you use your EOS program... do you notice how in your computer when looking at yourself everything looks mirrored? (Example: Touch your right eye in person it looks like you are touching your left eye on the computer) do you know how to fix that ??
You motivated me to start my own makeup channel ILY ! Keep it up love 😍🎥💕
I can't barely remember my phone number and you remembered like 7 different brands foundation shades of yours 😂😂
Omg what lashes is she wearing??? 😍
perfect foundation shade yasss
Love your channel ❤️❤️
Fenty Beauty looked gorgeous on you!
The gloss....so good
Girl you're trending
her eyes... wow
Your skin is flawless 😍
Hey babe, You're Trending!!
It looks good 😊
17:15
What shade should i get if i'm around NC20? :)
You are sooo stunning Amy 😍
favorite review by far! ❤️❤️
😍😍😍😍
I sware your like the other me . Love this video so much Amy 💗
I just got the gloss in yesterday, it's absolutely the most perfect color, super glossy and not goopy. You can wear it alone or top it off on any of your fav lippies.
Try 280 love!
3 AM in the morning is a little redundant. lol
I guess were watchin diff reviews cause ive heard the foundation blows lol theres gonna be an army of cake facers walkin around lol
When you're outside do you have a filter on your camera?
I love the trending tab all makeup and celebs \n\n\n\nnot gaming or comedy
I just ordered this foundation for myself from all the reviews of fenty beauty foundations this foundation looks like it was made just for me, the most perfect one. I'm so excited to receive it.
Can you do a video of your favorite brushes for foundation, eyes etc? I'm trying to find a great foundation brush that doesn't leave texture/print on the skin after blending. Thanks!
We are the same shades! Get 240 :)
I just realized we use the same shade in Estee Lauder Double Wear! I knew it was Shell Beige but not the number of it. This is going to help me so much with your foundation reviews. I believe you're the only youtuber that matches me! Thanks girl!❤️❤️
hello anybody want to fry some eggs I am so dead Amy!!!
You should definitely buy the brushes their amazing!
Like hello anyone wanna get some eggs 😂
What's the brush you used to highlight?
i love love ur review thank u for sharing with us ❤
I also got shade 300 but i wanted a shade darker than myself (tanner), not too much that it looks weird though, anyways I feel like it looks a little orange on me so maybe I should go to 290 instead! On you it looks orange too I wouldn't say its darker so maybe we both should get shade 290! But I should say it is also the lighting where you filmed because when you were outside it looked just fine! \nps. I'm so happy I finally found someone who is the same shade as me haha :)
Tbh I think this foundation is AMAZING !!! I personally love it cuz I have supper oily skin and it held up for me all day.. I loveee how it looks on you. looks sooooo flawless <3 nice review overall tho ! would love to see a follow up with your shade
The gloss looks too sticky... i've noticed that on so many other people's videos as well like you can see the stringy-ness when opening and pressing your lips together to speak. That's the only thing from this collection i wouldn't purchase just because of that
Thank you! I can always count on u for foundation color since we're litterally the same foundation color in almost every product. And when I heard 300 I said yep that's what I was gnna get
What's on your nails???? Love it
I think Trophy Wife highlighter would've looked really nice on you.
OMH, literally every check in your skin looked AIRBRUSHED! SO amazing! I need this foundation in my life.
Is anybody an NC20 in Mac that can give me there shade in the fenty beauty foundation??
Idk if it's just me but it looks like the side you used Rihanna's sponge on, the foundation appeared a little lighter while the other side looked a little darker. But when you used the beauty blender on both sides, it looked good lol. The foundation looks great on you though.
Your video is on the TRENDING PAGE!!!! 🤙💋
This looks like a great video, but after you are done would you be kind enough to check out my new YouTube channel and give me some feedback? Maybe even subscribing? ;) https://youtu.be/BhQob6WW-TQ
Stunning like always ! Thank you for this really informative review !
You're one of my favorite YouTubers 😍❤️
The filter you used at the end was crazy
I just want to take this moment to tell you that you are so beautiful and articulate. I love how in depth you get on products. You're such a great YouTube. I love how down to earth and humble you are. Also your bare skin looks really good.
Not usually a commenter however I noticed on the last first impressions for foundation you did, people's in the comments kept saying how they wished you applied a lighter layer first and did a wear test. \nThough I don't agree, cause I'm all about that cake too girl! I think that you doing both of those things in the video just once again proves why you're videos are the best. Really listening to your viewers and giving us what we ask for. Reinforces that you're the most trust worthy guru <3
Thanks so much for sharing your shades in different brands. Really helps a lot!!!
It looked so smooth on your skin 😍😍😍😍
Am I crazy or did this fenty sponge eat half of your foundation? 😄
Now I have to buy the lipgloss🤣😍
I feel like you applied the contour/bronzer a lot better than most reviews I watched. Loved the idea of rubbing it on the brush first :) Since it does tug a bit on the face because of the waxy texture.
Maybe its drying dark because u added a second layer
She does not even need makeup
You look orange you need a way lighter color!
Will you just get on with it
I like your vlog style check ins ❤️
Everything looks so stunning on you, you're making me want to put on a full face of Fenty Beauty again!
what shade would you reccomand if your golden sand in the loral true match?
So is the foundation worth it? I always wear estee lauder double wear but looking for something new to try.. what's the next best thing???? Hahaha
Even tho the shade dried darker your skin look FLAWLESS, girl!!! You just made Sephora take all my money 😩😩 love love love
THAT CREAM BRONZER LOOKS SOOO GOOD ON YOU! I kinda wanna try it now! I've never done cream bronzer.. hmmm
love your videos amy, as always ♥️♥️
I went to Sephora to mainly get the Fenty foundation,  but they're sold out of the 3 colors I could wear.  It was like Black Friday in there, crazy!  So I got the lipgloss and the \nhighlighter duo in Ginger Binge & Moscow Mule. I will eventually get the foundation
I bought the universal gloss bomb this past Saturday and I wear it every single day lol. It smells like watermelon jolly ranchers. That's the scent you were looking for lol. I applied it on my channel too. I love the shade on my lips so much ❤
Rihanna murdered that other brand!!! Seriously, they knew idiots will go out and spend anyways. who puts 0.9g in a tube and sell it for $30.
I'm so glad you did a review.  I was hoping you would.  I've seen several others,  but you are certainly my go to. My make up collection is what it is because of your input. So thank you!
Loved your video. What brand eye lashes do you wear my daughter would love these.
Maybe your is shade 290, more neutral with a mix of olive tones. I had to go to Sephora to get color matched because what I thought was my shade was a hot mess when I tried it in store. Lol
Did you end up finding the right foundation colour?
Did you set your face with anything?
the foundation matched the rest of your body, and the fenty blender application was so flawless...
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE GONNA TRY TROPHY WIFE 😭... PLEASE TRY IT
THANK YOU for saying your foundation shades in SO many foundations!!!! Biggest pet peeve is when youtubers don't mention the shade they buy in a foundation
I love u Amy but make ur videos shorter they r way too long babe 😘🙏🏼
The fenty sponge worked better...I noticed a difference in the application
We're about the same shade in MAC (I'm a NC35) and I wear a 250 in the foundation
Love the collection, and the blotting powder; hopefully if she grows the collection she will do various shades of a setting powder. \nThanks for the review love!
The egg part 😂\nLove love love your videos🙌🏼💖\nEverything looks super good on you!!!
Yes please do a shade update!! I wear Too Faced Born this Way in Sand 😊 300 looked a lil too dark 😕
Here's a close up of the foundation. *still waiting*
Omg when you went to finish your make up your make up looks so good with the lashes. Looking bomb!
Why have not ever subscribed to you, its a crime that i'm this late, you did a fantastic job.  I loved all the information you gave, I loved how you showed how to fix the problem.  You are very good at what you do.  Plus you are stunning with or without makeup.
WHAT LASHES IS SHE WEARING
what brush did you use to highlight ???
How many times can one person say the word Smooth!!!!!!
No hate, just seems that this makeup makes you look splotchy and dirty?  Anyone?
i'm a nc24 in mac what shade should i get ?
Your foundation looks a bit oompa-loompa-ish
It looks so pretty on you.
He's a clown
All I know is that Pennywise is such an awesome band.
To be fair to everyone complaining about the whole Pennywise can't catch kids lol in the book it's explained this is his MO since the more afraid they are the better they taste so the longer he can draw out their fear of him via multiple encounters the better. However, neither movie really communicated this well so yeah... Both movies are kind of bad
This is an exaggerated truth, but boarder-line fact. Like he would never just straight up eat someone, he had to like fill someone up with pure fear for like 5 minutes before he eats them, giving space for ex machinas to take place and stuff. Which I guess makes sense if you want the tastiest meal possible... but if you need to feed so badly then u might as well do it while you're ahead pennywise, it's only for the best.
I don't think you read the books...
I get what you're saying but Pennywise was honestly a really fun character. Also is he basically a boggart?
...It, an eternal, shapeshifting being that feeds off fear.   IT'S A BOGGART.
Can you pls have your parents in one of your videos soon ? Love your room btw 👍🏻
While I saw this in the theatre's throughout the film I kept thinking about your Creepy Pasta Video. Although wonderfully nostalgic , didnt think he was all that frightening. For me the scariest parts were,  Lady in the Painting, Pedo Pharmaist and Beverly's Dad.
I cant even...what? Is this a satire attempt?
...and Pennywise has only ONE weakness: physical trauma. This was the best line.
I believe he turned the kid to go after the others as a defensive mechanism. For the first time, he has something hunting him down. If he fears that they might no longer fear him, then he may want or need outside intervention.
Physical trauma is a weakness of mine, too.
damn, lady! you look hot in this vid <3 <3 <3
I think he manipulates people into killing because a murderer on the loose is freaky, and he might feed off of any fear, not just the fear of him.
I gave Jenny a thumbs up for the massive list of credits at the end, amazing :)  Your humor is top notch
I love you Jenny
penny wise & pound foolish. no one needs to know this tripe. learn to read a real book like The Way of All Flesh.
Funny how? Like I'm a clown, I amuse you? They shoulda gotten Joe Pesci to play Pennywise. They coulda had him beat some kid to death with a shinebox.
I wish she could make a movie, so I can try really, really hard to make a sarcastic video about it......
Ok, this is my favorite Jenny video by a wide margin. Her, I guess you'd call it trademark almost bored tone made describing a killer clown the funniest thing I'm likely to watch today. It's 7am and I've already hit my funny peak.
I will always upvote a Jenny video.
BEEP! BEEP! Jenny
From this movie, I learned that Pennywise was an actual clown that died in a previous Derry incident. \nIT probably just finds this form more universally fear inducing than the other forms he uses. \nI expect when he lets people get away it's because he wants to let the fear simmer for a bit. \nAlso the key to defeating him is friendship, like most of life's problems. \nhttps://pics.me.me/doubt-2-youre-right-i-cant-do-it-you-cant-20047874.png\nStephen King's IT: Friendship is Magic.
Is clown college still a thing? \n\nCLM
It was more of a comedy then a horror movie honestly
When the patreon credits came up.... WHOA!  O_O
IT and a Turtle are Mortal Enemies.
This video was ripe for clown-nose wearing potential.  Wasted.
what the hell was that the vietnam wall memorial for the ending ?\nwtf was that x)
What are you afraid of Jenny?
I heard this theory that he’s a clown because “pennywise” the identity, is of a serial killer like John Wayne gasey in that universe. Because all of the forms he takes are of preexisting entities, like Beverly’s Dad or the lumberjack statue or the flute painting or Georgie
Where is the giant porg!?
What if he went across monkey bars whilst upside down... like all gravity defying like?
So, like a crocodile, Pennywise is an ambush predator. ;)
You're very pretty in glasses
You're so pretty.
Just admit to us that you like being a clown haha, I can imagine him sitting there with a sad clown face when they say that to him.
My goodness you are attractive
as glad as i was when you went over to screen junkies just in hopes you'd make some money off your work, these are by far you best videos.  millennial falcon is great but i'm interested in hearing what you have to say on more than the one topic.
3:13 He can dance if he wants to.  He can leave his friends behind.  Because his friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, then they're no friends of mine.\n\n*safety dances out of the comment section*
I am so glad you did a video about the film! I saw it opening day and enjoyed so much more than I expected so I've wanted to talk about it a lot more, and you talking about it makes it feel like a conversation with a good friend ^_^\nAfter thinking about it, I theorize that Pennywise is either unable to hurt/kill a child unless they are afraid (or maybe they're just tastier when he's built up fear in them, like fear is the marinade and the longer they soak in it, the more satisfying, because I mean, he attacked Georgie no problem, but maybe he was like ehhh needs more fear) oooorrrr he's just a total egomaniac like most villains and decides that his prey must acknowledge how frightening he is to boost his self esteem or idk, maybe he wasn't hugged enough as a wee alien monster clownie.
You know nothing of It beep beep Richie is what they say to Richie to shut up. He feeds on fear. And he likes scared children he says they taste better scared. He wants to scare them to eat them but he made a mistake of letting them live longer he thaught he could eat scare them more so that they would taste better
I never cared for Pennywise the band
With the final confrontation with Pennywise they should have played a song from Queen.
I've always felt that the deadites from the Evil Dead franchise feed off of fear as well, that to them it's a kind of art. Sometimes killing people is necessary for creating that fear, but if you watch enough Evil Dead stuff you start to realize that they take relatively few opportunities to actually kill.\n\nOff-topic, but whatever. I'm drunk.
Mostly true lol, but for the first one he wasn't trying to catch him, he was trying to scare him because to him the more afraid they are the better they taste. That's also why he takes his time since hes trying to build up how scared they are. Funny video though
You're braver than I. I was not going to watch a killer clown movie.
Hey. Jenny. You. Are. Beautiful. And. Clever. :)
4:10 o my goodness i didnt even think in that scene that way, now thats the only way ill think of it now. I HATE U FOR THIS
The clown, not the punk rock band
A big spider huh....thats an interesting notion ;]
Why is that porg so tiny?!
Nah, penny wise says beep beep to Richie as a reference to the book. The kids used beep beep as an indicator for Richie to stop running his mouth yeah?
I'm sorry—that was a great video—but the camera wasn't set right.
Jennys hair looks like she got shes all that-ed right before she started shooting where she took off her glasses and shook down her hair in slowmo....but then couldnt see so she had to put the glasses back on
i always figured that the more fear a kid experiences the more the fear flavor builds inside them. Like how adrenaline makes animals taste gamey.
I was just picturing Pennywise telling the Crimson King he was going to take the form of a Clown.
Do more stars wars erotica fan fiction.
Ok well now I feel like a total idiot for liking the movie. Thanks Jenny.
I was with It, more or less, right up to the point where the kids locate the house and decide to wander in and tackle the supernatural killer monster with, uh... friendship? Stern disapproval? I guess they thought they'd prove it was real by having it tear them all to shreds. I found it tough to y'know, BUY IN after that point. Not to go all in the book, but in the book they plan the EFF out of their first assault on it. With weapons, even!
it was said in an effort to let richie know that he went too far. As far as the origin of it, at the time that part of the novel was set, shows featuring comedians and variety shows were very poular. At the end of the comedian's jokes, they would beep a horn, similar to the 'drumroll' that we associate with the end of jokes on modern stand up comedy routines. So the beep beep richie part was basically saying, Ok richie, joke's over!
I love your analyses, but damnit don't ruin IT for me with your logic lol
In the book, the whole point of Pennywise in his clown guise was to lure kids in by appearing harmless fun and goofy. The first part of the novel takes place in 1957, decades before the whole ironic creepy clown trope was a thing. Although creepy clowns have always been around, it wasn't as prevelant back then. A clown was still a credible disguise. \nBy moving the setting up 30 years, you make Pennywise's modus operendi rather dubious. Not to mention the fact that Bill Skarsgard didn't even try to appear anything other than a creepy monster.
There really was no rhyme or reason to his tactics. The only consistency was him ending a scene as a clown.
YES Jenny I'm so glad you made a video about this
I don't think it was pennywise but the actor who had never seen or heard of clowns before accepting the role. Thanks in part to the 1990s big tobacco cases that banned phillip morris from promoting clowns to children and the truth about clowns campaign.
Never trust a man with large shoes.. \n\n\n.. my dad put on his size 11's and walked out on us
Hey! This was fun. I'm curious, did you enjoy the movie?
Just watched the 90s version.  The talking head in the fridge, shaking and yelling WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE! was a reoccurring thing in my childhood nightmares.  Looking forward to the new film.
The only real plot hole that bothered me was: how the hell did Bill melt that wax for the boat at the beginning??
You did a really fantastic job with this one. I especially like the part about how his friends would judge him and the twisty slide bit. That's good stuff. Word painting. Nice.
Just admit it Pennywise! Just admit that you like being a clown! I would be that monster friend.
Sadly, they didn't really explain Beep beep, Richie in the movie.\n\nIt was actually what the Losers Club said to stop him when he ran off at the mouth too much, which happened a lot.
my god what happened to your porg! it shrunk!
i see you washed that porg and it shrunk down to a managable size.
So everything from this point back is Pre-Porg. You can tell by the hollow and soulless look in her eyes.
I know nothing about any sci-fi but i find her delivery so funny that she is one of 5 youtube subscriptions i have.
Oh how I wish, not for the first time, that I hadn't read the godawful Youtube comments.
Honestly, if I hadn't read the book and had only seen the movie, I wouldn't give a shit about who the kids were and what happened to them. Like the movie was 2 hours long and we barely learned anything about our main characters.
Pennywise likes play with his food. There, 65% of the plot holes are covered.
Yummy.
I adore your sarcasm
Pennywise likes floating.
You are gorgeous
Stop trying to make Twisty Slides happen Pennywise!
Marry me
Ok
Hahah
Great stuff as usual... :)
Jenny is Pennywise, but occasionally she is Porg foolish.
Jennywise!
Long time watcher, first time commenter. Your awesome. That is allz
For once, I completely agree with this lady. Pennywise was not scary, and IT was very disappointing.
The sausagefest that is your patreon account is always the best piece of comedy in your videos
😃 That was... funny? I didn't laugh, but I'm pretty sure this was funny.
holy fuck was she bit in the face by a dog when she was a kid or something?
Look, someone who didn't read the book. How could this very simple concept of a movie elude you? My 9 year old kept up, I thought you were intelligent... Or is that just what you keep wanting us to think that? Also, 42 percent of people are afraid of clowns. And pennywise got greedy and wanted all those kids and he built up their fear for too long. Clearly to his down fall... Do you even pay attention to the movies you watch or just pick up shit you wanna bitch about to be a hipster?
You're beautiful and a nerd.  <3
shut up
Starting sixth form this year. Once that's done, defiantly following this advice.
Why does he sound like he's Holden Caufield
I go to an online uni. Thank the Lord I don't have to socialize with humans. Just stay locked in my room with my Doritos and Pepsi.
Class started like a week ago when you uploaded this lol
Dan has really nice eyes in this video?
IM BARELY 14 AND YOU'VE  ALREADY GIVEN ME ANXIETY FOR THE NEAR TO IMPENDING DEATH OF UNIVERSITY DANIEL😱
I love this video. It is so damn freaking relatable. Flashback to college.... thanks Dan 🙈
I'm in uni now and so far things have been pretty great.\n\nA week in and I already got into legal trouble, whoops.\n\nThis is my third week and life is just amazing.
I think some people get confused about British education so here it is \n*British school set out*\nAge 3-4 is nursery.\nThen at age 4-5 you start primary school and primary school carries on until you are 11.\nAt age 11-12 you start high school and then this carries on until you are 16.\nBefore leaving high school you will take extremely important exams called GCSE's.\nYou will then go to college at aged 16-17 and you will study three- four courses that you will take exams in at age 18 called A levels.\nAfter your A levels you will be free of education as you no longer legally have to be in education and college will be over.\nUniversity is like American college, you can choose to go to it and get a degree to get a job.
my best friend once set fire to microwaveable mac and cheese cuz she forgot to add water ♥️♥️♥️
I'm going to uni in 2 weeks FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I AM SCARED
dan traveling all the way across the city to use the washing machine in phil's apartment...why am i not surprised
College advice from someone who's been here for about a month: \n1. Don't freak out if you don't make 500 friends the 1st day. If you are taking classes you love you'll eventually run in to people who love the same things you do.\n2. If you don't want to go to parties and get drunk, that's fine. Stay home, make some microwave mac and cheese, and watch glee. If you want to go, that's fine too. Go with a friend and make sure you watch out for each other.\n3. Go to class and do the reading. Seriously, just do.\n4. If you're anything like me you will probably have about 10 mental breakdowns in the first week because everything is new and scary and your mom isn't there. It's ok, everyone else is doing it, and it will take a little time to adjust. For some people that's 3 hours, for some it's 3 weeks. Just remember that it's normal, but if it gets really bad there are people on your campus you can talk to, you just have to go find them.\n5. Finally, don't stress so much. I know it's fucking terrifying but it's also really exciting and you're going to have a great time (:

I haven't been to uni in years away but one of my sisters did her and when she got back she had told me whenever she had to do an assay or something she would allow herself chocolates and when she finished she ate them all, this I can also use for secondary or high school depending where u live
The board in the background omg \n'Full time internet hobo'
Random question... are you going to see Frank Iero in London??
As the weirdo who learned how to cook by age eight and was completely self reliant by twelve, start small with cookbooks and really simple shit, then work up to anything requiring improv. Breakfast is easier to cook than dinner, meat is scary, but easier than it looks, and properly made one pot pasta is impressive looking and near impossible to fuck up. Now go. Go and be self reliant as the pioneer in the Prairie. \n\n(because the advice of someone who was making their own meals in elementary school is exactly what you need in this situation)
My cousin has a friend whos parents know you apparently.He said you met in Manchester
That last frame looks like dan is about to swallow my replay button.
Does the sign say Full time internet hobo?
I live in Bangkok where it's summer everyday of the year
FAVVV💜
'Cheeky vimtos'
nice screen saver Phil with cereal okay.
just thinking about socializing gives me anxiety Im fucked
Facepalming at the pasta moment.
relatable
You should do a video on job interviews
I'm surprised Dan wouldn't do a physiology course at university.
Dan: self-deprecating jokes and sad times\nAlso Dan: some actual, legit advice\nAnd also Dan: still phil trash #1
I'm never gonna go to uni tbh, It just isn't for me
You... Set fire...to pasta... Because you didn't know...to put water in it...\nDan, child, I love you. But really?
Last and most important (especially for my American college kids), if you can avoid it, DO NOT TAKE AN 8AM CLASS. I know it seems fine since high school started at 7am, but unless you are very, VERY much of a morning person, you will not want to get up. TRUST ME
Dan I have been subscribed since butterfingers
My first week of college was hell. I was mostly alone the entire time and my roommate decided to turn the girls next door against me. This meant i honestly had 3 girls all telling me I ruined everything....but still not sure what everything was? Anywho, I moved into a different room and I eventually met my first very real best friend. I love her to the moon and back and my life would suck ass without her. Did I mention she also gave me TABINOF because she knows Dan and Phil are the only people that can make my shitty life bearable besides her? Yeah. In all seriousness, college is the best thing that had ever happened to me. Was the best year of my entire life and I didn't drink during any of it *cough* DANIEL.
I set fire to ramen dan that's not very reassuring in summary I'm going to be majorly violated in every aspect of life Kool mateeee
While I don't enjoy Dan's content, I respect how he has found a way to monetise his despair.
I microwaved food with foil wrapping and the whole thing was on fire, like proper flames, and I ran away. Until this day no one knows it was me.
Well you know what Daniel,\nOnce I burned cookies in an oven that wasn't on.\n\nDon't ask, I don't know
This is literally a video of Dan telling us how he just gave up
I didnt skip an ad for you; now you are a millionaire. Worship me.
so I'm a senior in college and I think the biggest regret that I have had in the four years would be that it's online. I'm a people person and it is easier to learn and keep track of assignments while in a classroom full of peers that keep you accountable (is that actually a thing in college?) versus going to school online where the perk is that it's on my own time, but you have one week to learn each topic instead of like three or four weeks. The most fun that I've had whilst in college would be my Math class. Now, this class was designed specifically for Liberal Arts Students so there was never any wrong answers. But have you ever had to write a ten page paper on a specific mathematical subject before? WEIRDEST. THING. EVER. I am currently taking Biology and learning about just how weird I am (all my allergies) and I cannot wait for senior year to be over.
I go to a music uni, so everyone is kinda weird to some degree. Tho the weirdest thing I ever heard was a rumor that a teacher didn't have a piano at home because he would do nothing but play it. Like not eating, not working, just to play the piano. Then I'm friend with a guy who goes around singing Gregorian chant out loud but that's kinda the usual
When you're a student recruiter for the rowing team...
Canadian here. Dan, College and University are different things 😂
the whole time that i was watching this i kept saying he's so pretty and crying look at him
Is it just me or was that actually helpful 😂😁
I'm going next week and I feel like I'm going to die
How many wigs do they own and why
Is no one gonna talk about how he got a cab all the way to the other side of town to do his laundry at Phil's place…?
ok like i'm sorry but who doesn't set their pasta on fire? it's even better if you run through the 3rd floor corridors screaming with the pot of flaming pasta!! seriously, if it's not on fire and you don't inadvertently blow up 3 microwaves you're doing it wrong
When he talked about that girl who winked at him I just thought SAME
I'm in my schools art program (it's a thingy for good artrs I guess) I'm new and didn't go to the meet and greet thing I'm scared to death of the other kids that will be in it and having to talk to them
i ''only'' have 2 semesters left of uni but ooooooh my god i cant take it anymore
Playing Halo on a Playstation controller? Right...
Im in my first year of college and im so lost and dead inside halp
C O L L E G E
I'll cook for you, Dan. I'll also do your laundry anyday. 😉 \nLolol. I mean I can, but you probably would find this very creepy. Love you Dan! 😂❤❤
I can't get over merican
Preparing for university 6 years early by watching a guy who dropped out give advice.\n\nNice.
I started college two weeks ago. A fitting video. :)
My friend watched your video and today I sent her screenshots from when you were impersonating the Scottish dude rowing and she thought that that was from the dancing with the couch part 😂😂😂

I had a roommate from Japan freshman year and i lived with four people. Same situation, they never talked or anything, but one day I walked into the room and they were holding a sword and screaming very loud at my one roommate. They were like swinging this metal gas station sword on the dresser next to the roommate to the point it was splintering and pieces were flying off. My other roommate just sat on their bed and curled up too scared to try and leave to get help. \nAnyways they disappeared and I didn't seem em again until my junior year when I was getting on a campus bus and they walked on, saw me, flipped me off, and got off again.
I bet the weird Chinese guy was a group hallucination
i know youve had the new end screen for a while now, but i wanted to comment that i really like it, because i cant remember if ive said that already. i think its really cool
And noped the hell back to my room is officially my new favorite saying.
8 years until I start university.
I dropped out but now I have no future. Oops. What do
I'm at the open university so I basically do my course from my bedroom and it's great bc all my lectures are online, tutor meetings are via Skype or email and I do my assignments while in my pjs wrapped in my blanket... so basically I'm getting a degree while I stay in bed 24/7😂\nI have social anxiety and depression so it helps me not have panic attacks and embarrassing breakdowns everyday
SET FIRE TO PASTA\n\n\nHOW TF DID YOU DO THAT ITS ALREADY IN WATER EHAGSJDBDB\n\nYOU NOOT.
Why does it look like Dan is wearing gold eyeshadow in this video? I mean I can't help it it really does and it's bothering me now Lol! 😂
The first day I went into my new school someone said I could sit with them and then this dude walked up to our table and literally the next thing I hear was 'I don't think it's normal to be able to fit a fist in your vagina' (like they were all having a conversation about this) meanwhile I legit just sat there in silence, stood up and left :) happy days
I set my toaster on fire when I used that grilled cheese life hack :/
Dan, I also just recently started uni after working hard for 3,5 years. I had the worst two weeks but it's better now, everything is interesting and you get to be a nerd without judgement. University is nice man.
I'm a freshman, but imma go to school during the summer so that in 1 1/2 years i can leave, and as much as I want to get the hell out of school, college terrifies me.
'What not to do at University' uhhh drop out
thanks Daniel, i'm going to college next week and i'll be staying in a dorm (': i'm so thrilled (not)
HE DIDN'T PUT WATER WITH PASTA PFF

He was my favourite. RIP Bruce
He was brilliant and I love how the dancers did his signature move in the end
He's my favourite.
I don't usually watch Strictly but only because of Bruce I watched this tribute and even now I can't help but having a little cry as I loved watching him as a kid and teenager. Bruce always made laugh and was the first person I saw on a Saturday night and he'll always be my favourite entertainer. Just sad I never got to see him live. Goodbye Bruce R.I.P to a legend. Keep making us laugh in heaven
That Alesha/Bruce moment at 4:39: EPIC! Both had a lot of chemistry during that duet.
What an absolute legend !!!!\nHe could sing, dance, play the piano,\ntell jokes etc.  In fact he was an all \nround entertainer.\nR.I.P. Sir Bruce.
RIP THE LEGEND! We will miss you!
Bruce died on my birthday, I grew up watching him and loved him to bits. So devastated.
Didnt like strictly but you cant deny the fact that he was a legend.
So sad, may he RIP :(
amazing person, one of my favourites like robin Williams. big loss
i live in the US, but i remember Sir Bruce Forsyth's Hot Streak game show, will always love It's nice to see you, to see you...(claps hands, throws hands out) NICE!  RIP Sir Bruce

Brought tears to my eyes.  Sad to lose another one of our greats.
He was born in London.  He was a wonderful man.
Thanks to the BBC, I'm going to give it a year or two before deciding my emotions on Brucie are worth holding.
Bruce Forsyth singlehandedly makes me proud to be British.
I've watched strictly for years and years Sir Bruse was and will always me a LEGEND in everything he has done and no one will ever top him... rest in peace you brilliant man xx
RIP Brucie, they don't make them like you anymore :( <3

Bruce keep dancing in heaven you will be greatly missed
I was in Cardiff when i heard the news. Very sad but he had a fabulous life! Keep dancing Bruce!
Still hard to believe end of an era
Is it just me who thinks Brucey looked like Basil Brush?
If only there was a love button to this video and not just a like button ...
Thos was just a perfect way to pay tribute to the amazing Brucie.
I am gonna miss Sir Bruce Forsyth
Weres it's nice to meet you to meet you nice

Wow, I didn't expect to cry watching this. RIP to a true legend.
I held it together until Tess's voice broke. What a beautiful dedication. I know he'll be missed by many
So sad theses old school entertainers who were such pros at their job now disappearing off our stages.\nHe was so good at what he did,he was a natural.\nRIP Brucie. Thanks for your dedication  for all of thoses years.
Sir Bruce was special, he was an ICON!
I was really upset to hear old Brucie died a peaceful death. I would have preferred a slow painful agonizing one.
I have been watching this my whole life. When I was told this I felt a lump in my throat. Can't believe he is gone. He was so amazing 😥😥😥
wasnt he a dirty pervert like the rest of them .??
When did this MF die?
Amazing, talented and will be greatly missed.  From the early days at the Palledium an all round professional.
did bruce forsyth have any comments about skinheads?
It was nice to see you Brucie to see you nice for the last time RIP
What an amazing man.. he will be missed 😢❤️
Miss brucey so much such an amazing man\nRest in peace
Out with his version of frank Sinatra, lovely tribute
Watching this in Mexico as missed the show & cant get it on iPlayer & have tears 😭 in eyes.Felt so sorry for Tess,& Claudia did well for her.Anton & the rest of the dancers 💃 what a superb tribute. Thanks Brucie for the memories.
How can anybody dislike this video?!
I remember watching strictly every Saturday night when I was a child \nMemories 🙌🏽
What a lovely tribute to him. *tears* He really is a tv legend never to be forgotten :')
Another BME Broadcasting Production - where are the gay couples; where are the Muslim women wearing a niqab; where are the disabled people, do they not have a right to participate?  This is outrageous from a publicly funded State TV broadcaster!?
I thought he died years ago. Shame
What a legend.....You will truly be missed 😢
Ukrainian Dancing with the Stars seems to me much better. But it's cool too.
Another pointless reality show.. No disrespect to Sir Bruce
Nice to of seen you too of seen you....
fuck off

Great and funny video like always
Too bad I wasn't there with my Gascoigne outfit. Though I wouldn't be able to clash swords with you as my saw cleaver is made of foam board. Might wanna take it easy on the hitting random people with the sword. Might be asking for trouble these days. At least make sure they acknowledge you are there before swatting. Just for your sake.

Who was this Aristotle guy, who had the audacity to criticize those strong, independent womyn? Such blatant misogyny, thanks for defending their honor, good sir. Also, my wife's son loves your channel, he has learned so much, like we need immigration and diversity to avoid the fate of Sparta. Truly educational.
God damn, that was a good video.
SPARTANS!WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION?\n\nAAAAAOUOUOUOUOOUUOU      AAAAAAAAAOUOUOUOUOU       AAAAAAAAOUOUOUOUOU\n\nWhat kind of profession is that?\n\nIt sounds like(Americans) reacting to a slight injury.
20:32 there is some eye illusion going on with the boxes if you look closely. i  saw illusive circles in between boxes.\n\nNeverthless damn i enjoyed this video. Am getting homo on historia civils.
I think I know what happened to Sparta in terms of population decline. When a population has reached an economic comfort, they start producing less babies. In fact, they stop functioning efficiently after a while as a society as only seniors overtook the nation. The factors of the slaves population too may have factored in this.\n\nJust look at modern Europe, and njpw so many nations are now in population decline. There are towns and villages in Portugal that had han't had a newborn child in 30 years. Italy has been dealing with a population crises for decades despite being a relatively wealthy european country.  \n\nAnother angle might be what was seen in an experiment dealing with mice populations. It's rather jarring how the population of happily well fed mice suddenly imploded and how it had developed two distinct population types. \nhttp://io9.gizmodo.com/how-rats-turned-their-private-paradise-into-a-terrifyin-1687584457
for a bunch of tyrants the spartans were remarkably democratic.
major loss of respect for the Spartans. A gynocentric society is a doomed society.
I'm a big consumer of videos from CGP Grey, Brady Haran's channels, and Tom Scott. But this is possibly the most interesting YouTube video I've ever seen.\n\nSo nice to see a more substantive explanation of Sparta than Warrior societies be crazy, yo.
If you can accept a permanent class of F'd people, Sparta had the greatest government ever known.
Sounds like the demise of the Spartans held the same fate of Egyptian rulers. They only could create a family of their heritage. There was no immigration. It could have been... well... the genetic defects that occur due to generations of family blood not diverse enough to create a healthy offspring. So inbreeding... Life spans could have dwindled lower and lower until the genes were too common the children could have effected the estimated maximum lifespan...
It's weird that The men sacrificed their lives to sustain Sparta and yet it usually ended up being Daughters and Wives who reaped the benefits. It's also probable that these wealthy women didn't need to remarry and so they lived a life of luxury while their state crumbled around them and their population decreased. Welp that sounds just like Murica.
Dickhead.  The  oricals were basically an ancient cia agency
Thank you so much. Your videos are always a pleasure to watch.
Sparta had a system where the power was always compounded into richer families on the matralinial side, creating a decay of private land and an overriding and hindering political force  in the Garusia (SP). The idea is that if you were a male and lived long enough to be in the Garusia, you probably married with a very rich Heiresses just by a sheer process of elimination or politicking.  This leaves the defacto power in the hands of those marriages where land, wealth, and political power are all in the same place. Those in power in this system wouldn't want reforms that would curtail their power despite it being necessary to maintain a citizen army and uphold mandates stated in their constitution. The disparity of wealth and resources between poorer and wealthy land/slave owning spartan citizens would only grow. We see a society of equals within the same class with vastly disproportionate resources.\n\nThere is no reason not to suggest that at some point this system failed to institute a very popular (or necessary) reform and a citizenry (trained as warriors) took action either to change or defend the status quo. This is just a theory, but a number of civil wars in Sparta would likely have a whole lot of casualties. The forces would likely line up as: many Common Spartans amassing against a larger slave army corralled by the upper class Spartans and their allies. Not only would many die in this event, but the kind of animosity that would grow between families and classes would ultimately create a disillusionment with the whole system thereby only wearing down greater authority.  \n\nEventually, lands and settlements would begin to just opt out of the system, perhaps holding their land by force or attaining foreign allies. We would see lands once controlled by Spartans begin to forge their own independent identity away from the city-state. Without the functioning society, those who held the power through these times would essentially just be left with whatever land they held on to nearer to the city and spread over larger land meaning less people in their control. \n\nThis theory does not mean things like disease and natural disasters could not have contributed to it, but it was much more likely the governing body no longer served the majority of people, and would likely have done the opposite, creating animosity among a large number of people who were trained to make war from birth.  Its a powder keg waiting to happen.
I do not believe any form of reform would've saved Sparta. Towns, nations and people die. Sparta didn't die because it didn't let people in. By that logic any human settlement left alone should die out yet native tribes lived in isolation without reform for millennia. Sparta died a demographic death. Caused by something but not it's demographics. Demographics reflect the society. While immigration could've kept the area inhabited it would no longer be Sparta merely whatever new culture arose. Sparta lived as Sparta and died as Sparta. It was slowly taken out by the tides of history. Immigration or demographic changes unless ones that improve native Spartans births would've killed Sparta either way.
Love that theme music!
So women are the 1 %?
There is a saying in my country 'Better a grave than a slave', the Spartan society is a great reminder of that.
As usual very good and informative video. Suggestions for future videos:\n\nI would suggest cutting down on the colorful outburst, like weird or super weird when describing something that isn't understood. Also suggest cutting down on the judgement of what what was clever management 2400 years ago, or elevating it with more clever perspectives. \n\nDescribing matters in these terms, as done in this video makes the maker of the video seem slightly naive, thus lowering the level of this otherwise somewhat academic channel. It is simply unnecessary and doesn't add to the video. Other that this I really enjoy your videos and the graphics. I've seen many of them several times. Cool style. Hope you understand I mean well and wish for you to gain more academic recognition.
Some of the virtue signalling posts in this comment section are...
>Let more imigrants\nI see what you did there, Goldberg
hahaha that green square at 5:40 casually throwing gold at the peasants as she passes on by
women being greedy even in Sparta? I'm shocked!...smh
Finally got my internet on after hurricane Irma, this is the first thing I go to haha. Yay Historia Civilis!!!
what's ommited from this video is the brutality of the educational system for the young, the abuse that women had to endure - including those that were able to accumulate wealth, and the constant state of fear that prevaded the life of the state. read plutarch if you want to know more
You sir just earned a sub! Great video.
They declined in the later years because they got wiped out in all the wars.
The Fers... Sounds appropriate for a group of politicians.
Should be a giant slab of stone with FUCK. EAT. DESTROY. Written on it
Who is zenofon?? It's called Xenophon. X like ks not like z. If they wanted to call him zenofon they would use z not x. They use x so it should sound like x.
Thank you for the video.  Could you do one concerning money in ancient Greece, Italy and poss Persia? What kind existed? Who controlled it, and do on.
Unsurprising then that they too got undone.\n\nAristotle was perfectly right. The women this produced were factually incapable of being mothers. A broken system that died by not being capable to produce what made it great:\nelite warriors.
The Spartans are group of people that we're kinda fucked up, but still i'm in awe.
I believe the State was in charge of Spartan war orphans, so they could have added the strong babies from slaves to this group and educate both from scratch to Spartan culture. Then add them all to the citizens to stabilise population decline. If they were caught the babies could have always been a product of a Spartan citizen with a slave, obtaining some legitimacy.
You forgot a 4. point about the Ephores and significant changes to legislation. Because its a small community and every man voted and (could)serve(d), change mayhaps happend gradually over a period of year. So one group started it with a small change and the following continued it (or put it on hold) until it was done. No hurry, we will finally get to the point. \n\nOr it really never happend and that would be truely incredible because its so unlike humans behave.
The way you bring those little squares and rectangles alive is amazing, feels like the history channel on a budget and with a narrator who feels personal. Thanks for the content!
It seemed like an ideal system except for the Gerousia.
Wow great video I was always curious to how mighty Sparta fell but it didn't it just withered away
15:00 Hmm... Wonder if that kind of tendencies have been observed in members of other strict societies while abroad?
I once called my teacher a helot. She took it to heart and went back to college and get a degree in business.
I remember my History Professor that a Spartan mother would rather want his son to die in war than go home alive where they lost the battle. After watching this video, I think they just want the wealth for themselves. Girls will be girls.
Ancient Sparta sounds like it has many similarities to modern day Israel and American Jews.
1. Kill or be killed\n2. Memorise that law well.
did they eat the sacrificed animals?
The Gerousia essentially ran Sparta. They decided what laws were passed, if the Kings had broken any laws,  and what laws were even considered to be voted upon. These Gerousia being divided up between the Royal Houses just goes to prove that Sparta was not even remotely close to a Democracy, or at least a good one, even despite voting.
So in a nutshell sparta was an oligarchy
Where did you get all of this information? Xenophon's book?\nI checked for it and it was at least $160 U.S and at most $210
Wasn't defeated by Helot Up Rising or a bunch of Angry Greeks? Come on man. By the time of the Romans, the Spartans were nothing because THEY WERE DEFEATED by Helots and Greeks. The lives lost during the Peloponnesian war and during the Thebes War had the spartans crushed, reducing their population. Then the helots rebelled and reduced their land in half. That was literally why the Spartans lost. Sure reform would be nice but they were THE super power in greece for hundreds of years. By the time the Romans came, that was hundreds of years later. Sparta would have been better if they didn't pursue the vacuum of power that Athens left. They should have stuck to their isolationist foreign policy that they always had and slowly expand like they always had.
Has there always been this many channers on this side of YT?
Did you really propose immigration as a solution to Spartan problems? No sir. Immigration was the cause of demise to all ancient governments including the Romans.\n\nOne thing you forget to mention about the Spartan society is how obssesed they were with economic disparity. To force sobriety they would accuse one another of undeclared wealth which would force them to pay for the city's infrastructure and reforms. They wasted tons of money trying to hide it so they weren't particularly keen to the rigurous system, but it was their city so while this was true they didn't care. The Spartans had an excelent system but it was too expensive.\n\nTheir problem was like any other greek kingdom. Economics. The  fall of the Delian League left the Spartans with too much land to rule under a centurial system concieved for just the Peloponnese. This created political instability, poor quality foreign governments and eventually famine, with the exception of Macedon, Greece became a shadow of its former self.\n\nSurrounded by a cilmate of dire economic conditions the Spartans unable to support the growing inflation suddenly percieved the life outside of the strict highly expenssive Spartan society was increasingly more appealing, and began to leave the city for a live of carelessness who gets it keeps it free for all, until eventually were but some few thousand men inside Sparta to keep it safe.
lol Spartans should've had immigration. lmao\n\nstfu\n\nLast thing you need is immigration.
The end of this video had me like... haha fuck those Spartan savages!\nROMA INVICTA!
You left out the Theban invasion, which helped many helots break free
The giant red block at the end is so emblematic of the Romans
How many Spartans does it take to change a lightbulb?\n800. One to force a Perioeci to change it, and 799 to prevent a Helot uprising.
You have just earned a sub. Good work.
love the channel thanks :D
I thought Athens was more important?
Massive wealth disparity is still uncool, even when it is in the name of female empowerment.
A very nice video. It would have been interesting if you went into the Periokoi as well, and the Spartans without citizenship. As a Spartan had to fullfill certain requirements to be a citizen and the inheritance system meant fewer and fewer citizens could exist as more and more land went to a few people. Also I think a distinction should be made between Laconian Helots and Messenian Helots, the former were always more loyal as Sparta was their state. Tough laws against Helots also seem to have only appeared after several Messenian Helot revolts and were probably not part of the original constitution.
This was very very interesting
Seems like a whole lot of work put in place so that nothing gets done, being a Spartan must have been frustrating!
I like the little pauses. Really allows a moment to reflect on the different possibilities.
The Spartans recruited from the Helots at least once if my memory serves me right. I suppose they could not get enough children to keep the population at acceptable levels.
For a much better analysis of Sparta, read Friedrich Schiller's essay Lycurgus and Solon and the comparison of their ways of the Athenian and Spartan government and culture. A major mistake in the early part of the video is about children which upon birth became property of the state.
Does the term Xeno come fround Xenophon being an outsider in Sparta?
Too stable???????\nBitch, Sparta existed as a stable Polis untill the Roman Conquest. That means like 500 years. Name any other city with this record.\n\nUnkown reasons????????????\nNo man, the reasons are known. The Thebans anihilated the spartan male army and decimated the female army with their recently invented sarissa strategy. This is why, one generation later, Philip and Alexander could easily subdue the spartans. It's simply a matter of population decline.\nReformations? As in Athens? The city that fell and rose every fifty years? You crazy man?\n\nSorry, but the ending deserves a thumbs down. Can't believe you try to pass political propaganda as History, nevertheless the ignorance of the Theban-Spartan War.
*Rome came in* The fuck is this?.... eh whatever, mine now
I read the title and I dropped everything I was doing to fully enjoy this.\n\nI don''t care how barbaric it turns out to be the idea of a spartan constitution, idk it just sounds fucking epic.
I absolutely love your videos. It's just a shame you haven't noticed governments are not here to solve problmems, but they're the very cause of them. Take your time to read some authors like Mises, Hayek and Rothbard. You'll notice that it isn't a matter of willingness to make people's life better, but rather a matter of logic. \nGreetings from Brazil!
Very informative!!! Ive read about Spartan law and ive came away with more watching this.. hopefully next youll do some about spartan kings and there stories
Am i the only one thats seeing black spots inbetween the square people 15:15
Friggin' A, I love these videos
This system of government is so insanely bad and vulnerable to abuse that it is a miracle that this state lasted so long....
We Spartans are the strongest!!!\n\nAnd then the Roman Legions arrived. xD
not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \n\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \n\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame.
All of these optical illusions with the bunched up squares
You make such great videos!
to me [degeneracy] sounds like they were just having a good time\nAnd that is why the West is dying. History tells some hard truths that we refuse to aknowledge because we are too weak willed to  offend someone, or take initiative.
Men with balls of steel.
this is the greatest history channel on youtube!
Dude plz make lots of videos.
this is really interesting. before this video i did not have the slightest idea about how the spartan state operated
how dare you call Aristotle lame...
BCE??? Befor christ, not this antihistorical communist BCE.
Just sayin', it's xenophon, not zhenophon.
5:40 corruption drive-by xD
A new historia civilis video?  OHBOY OHBOY OHBOY
Mother-Ephors!
Still pretty good constitution.
Ma guy! Fuckin love these vids.

Edifying as always
Absolutely amazing video, thanks!
5:54 Historia Civilis is SJW confirm?
to bad he gave travis the throne
the greatest album ever
Do a video on different beat producers love for Chrono Trigger samples. I hear it everywhere in rap.
that shit is classic!
Graduation is my favorite album by Kanye west
KANYE NARCISSIST WEST D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E-D his mom by what he said vs. what he became...a MONSTER at approx. 5:00 mark #Disgrace
his best album hands down
kanye is the most consistent rapper ever , release one track , instant classic.
I miss the old Kanye
Am i the only one who likes drunk and hot girls? 🤔
when vox already covered this about 2 weeks ago...
College dropout is his best album doe... graduation is cool... but it's not college dropout. The production alone makes it a classic.... one of my top 3 albums ever
My Favourite hip hop album of all time
I adore Kanye, but I recently discovered his developed style was just birthed from copying Kid Cudi lol. Was sort of disappointing.\nGraduation was the last original thing Kanye made, even though Dark Fantasy is his best work.
You know you're a legend when your arguably worst album is a calssic !
I'm still listening to graduation 💯💯💯
50 told me go ahead switch your style up, and if they hate then let em hate and watch the money pile up.
I could guess that 80% of people who own yeezys don't even know graduation. Really sad to think
2007 me: there's no way Kanye can do better than this \n2010: Jesus fucking Christ
did he say dived instead of dove?
I miss the old Kanye...
How many people were singing and dancing the whole time this video was on? 😂😂
As much as I loved Graduation I really think you should have done a video of how 808s changed music instead.
Wishing kanye releases more music soon! Heard his new album might be called turbo graphx 16?
Kanye is ahead of time
wasn't better than Curtis
What does the one person in the audience yell at 4:08?
Graduation is like 2-3 but MBDTF is just the best album of all time 🤙🏾
Good Morning is the best song on the album IMO
I'm a god
Flashing lights, can't tell me nothing, Stronger best songs on the album
*i was still changing my diapers*
Graduation & 808s and Heartbreaks are my favorites 💙
4:20 it's almost sad to see how much better albums sold back then.
Could somebody please ID the font at 0:00 for me?
jeez i stay bumping this album its just soo good even till this day💯
This album was lowkey trash. Lack luster, watered down information
Do a video about what hip hop talked about throughout the years.
Anyone slightly perturbed by the 'blocky' m's n's and u's  ?
Kanye was the first guy to show me that you didn't need to be a gangsta rapper to become the King of Hip Hop.
No lie. Music has never been the same since this album.
coincidence everyday struggle just had a kayne discussion about this exact topic not to long ago?
its sad cuz Now he can't top any of his older albums
Kanye is one of the best Rapper of all time...for Real!
a lot of graduation songs make me tear up (i'm gay)
Gangsta rap took a Major hit when Graduation dropped and never recovered damn Kanye really changed the culture
His best album !!! So much love for him
...but on graduation he dived into more electronic depths *plays drunk and hot girls* sampling Can now thats very electronic. who edits these LOL
Kanye West best album by far
Yeah changed for the worst.. thank God for Future and 808 mafia
I love kanye's music but Watch the Throne was so mediocre.
My favorite Kanye album of all time💯💯
kanye changed hip hop and this album screamed i'm not going anywhere.
Bruh a live synthesizer is a type of live instrument
He didnt change music. He doesnt create music  he creates trash. That's what changed. A generation mentally and morally destroyed because music has been destroyed.
I wonder and flashing lights is my shit
The greatest of all time
This is beautifully compiled. Thank you Vox!
The funny thing about this album, it's not his best one but still a classic.
I'm anticipating his new Album bet its gonna be dope!
GOAT!!!!!!!
Great video my friend
I liked Drunken Hot Girls.
The only Kanye album i actually went and bought.. I love that album... Yeesus was shit
Graduation is easily my favorite album from Ye
No, 808's & Heartbreak took Kanye to his apex
I have this album in the top 5 hip-hop albums of all time
Drunk and Hot Girls is Kanyes only bad song
Going to listen to Graduation right after this.
yep Good beats , catchy hooks, expensive videos but his lyricism just kept getting shit from here. compare him to any other great rapper and you'd realise that as a rapper he's always been somewhat 'meh'

every album he does changes hip-hop.
call me a oldhead....but this is my fav Kanye album. period
I love graduation but it has too many skippable tracks for me I still think it's a classic just not as good as his first two or mbdtf. Drunk and hot girls, goodnight, Barry bonds are all some of kanyes worst songs in my opinion.
The video is called How Kanye West’s ‘Graduation’ Changed Music and yet didn't really say much about the impact the album had on music in general. Like yes, it did change mainstream hip hop from a gangsta sound to a more anthemic sound, but did it change rock? Jazz? Blues? Indie? Metal? Reggae? Electronic music? Even if it did, this video still has a really misleading title.
I can't believe this album is 10 years ago!!
Good Morning - Get your thoughts together, a slow startChampion - Brightens your moodStronger - Pumps you upI Wonder - Sets emotion, dreamGood Life - Achieve your dreamsCant Tell Me Nothing - Peak, prob one of the most motivating songs for me!!Barry Bonds - In your face kinda feelsDrunk and Hot Girls - sry but prob the worst song on this albumFlashing Lights - One of the best songs on this album (w/ I Wonder, CTMN and The Glory)Everything I Am - Self reflection, slow beatThe Glory - I fucking DID ITHomecoming - Remember your rootsBig Brother - and the people that brought you upGood Night - Just live your life cuz life is short\nOne of the greatest albums ever! I love every song!!! I really wish Kanye will release a project of this caliber once again!
Say what you want about him but you cant say he aint passionate bout this shit
damn this video made me want more from kanye more thn i already did 😩 can't wait for his fucking album now
I still listen to this album.
4:48 jovs rich ass wearing crooks instead of real Versace lol
MBDTF tops Graduation.
KANYE IS THE FUCKING GOAT DONT YOU FUCKERS FORGET #freeye
Can we pls get cruel winter already
Imo the greatest rapper ever
808s more influential than graduation
Kid cudi helped influence his sound too
Then Kanye starts bashing Taylor 😂😂😂
Love this album
This fucking masterpiece ❤️ , Flashing Lights 🔥
that was dope.
http://MoneyComeFirst.com/?ref=2635
PROUD KANYE FAN 😎
Kanye copied cudi
Favorite Kanye album
Jacques look like a bisexual Taye Diggs! 😂😂😂
0:17 musically is death 💀☠🔫
MBDTF>Graduation
KANYE IS GREATNESS.
It's not rly that original it's heavily inspired by kid cudi
I bought this from Macy's (and got the free gift with purchase!) and I'm so excited to try it. I have dry skin so a lot of foundations do not work for me, I'm hoping this one does!
Last video with the lip ring! Hope the new Daith piercing helps with the migraines! Love the nose piercing! 😍
I'm so curious how many sephora points you have 😩 lol
💕
by saying to give this video a thumbs up at the beginning, you get more thumbs up from me, than other youtubers that wait until the last few seconds of their video. Savvy!   I was thinking the eyes were nice.  I like when you do bolder looks (said the woman 7 shades of eyeshadow, no 8 shades, today).
You should try to mix this one with the original double wear!!! Give you a fuller coverage with a less cakey finish
Hi, is there any small youtubers want to support each other?
Your face looks so pretty
I love this new ELDW foundation the finish is so pretty!!
I'm so excited for you that youre finally going on accutane, you deserve your clear skin and i cant wait for your transformation 💙💙💙
Awesome review!  I think I'm gonna give the Estee lauder foundation a try. ❤ Love this series of videos.
I love me some emo.
how often do you do the 15 Days of Foundation?
I bought that Lottie London foundation stick when I was just starting my make up phase. It nearly put me off for life!! It's soooooo bad!
Can you do a top 5 fav foundations of all time?
Nufe\nNude
This shade looks almost like your skin tone!
You're my hero
This foundation made your skin look flawless and so healthy! This one is a keeper
I can't wrap my head around the fact that such high price foundation doesn't have a pump. For that money you should definitely get a pump!
Day 11 already! Love your videos.
The liquid Lottie London foundation I heard is much better!
I would love to see you review the Dior Forever foundation. I think since you have issues with longevity.. this one could work for you :)
I have been on acutaine for a few months now and I went from having extremely oily skin with cystic acne to a few regular blemishes here and there (still not done with taking the pills) but my face is so dry now! I can't use any of my matte foundations anymore and I basically have to switch up my entire routine. I would say it is still worth it though!
FILM TUBE new Channel Frequency 💋💋❥❥❥👫💘😻💋💋
I think this might be one of my favorites in 15 days of foundation 🙌🏼✨
Are you gonna do a video on fenty beauty foundation? I wanna know what shade you are
You're literally trending rn I love it
#25 trending when I came here to watch!
Girl! You're trending #25\nAlso that Estee Lauder foundation looks great!.
This foundation looked so pretty on you!! I gotta try it!!
love how that foundation looks on your skin 💓 I want to purchase it now 😭
Why does it have to end!?!? 😭 #snapchatfam
The way you felt about that stick foundation is how I feel about the Fit Me stick foundation. Does everything you just described.
Wonderful review! The new Estee Lauder foundation looks beautiful! I liked the suttle shade difference too (for fair skin)! I'm definitely going to check it out. Thank you! 💛
I love Double Wear. It's my holy grail. I definitely want to try this out. What was going on with the Lottie London one☹️
One of the best shade matches ever!!
Your videos are often the best part of my day! So glad that even though your audience grows and you are so busy outside youtube, your spark, humor and dedication to making quality content never fade <3
You are very honest and I love that about your channel. Keepem comin
I loveee how much work you put into your channel 🙌🏻💖
The face you make when you get trolled 14:54
I was so excited to see this idea up early!
I kinda like the way you look better with medium coverage. It makes your skin look more natural I think.
the stick foundation looked drier than the sahara desert. wow.
That's so weird (the Lottie foundation) cause I have both of there's. The stick foundation is one of my favourite foundations plus it covers a lot! \n\nThough I do have fairly unblemished skin.
Really hope you'll be reviewing the new peach foundation from Too Faced!
is it sad I won't watch anyone else's review on the fenty foundation until I see Taylor's on day 13 cause her opinion's the only one I really care about😂
Yes on Trending!!!!! That's great Taylor! 💗💗
I am so ready for the fenty review!!! I know just about everyone I watch has enjoyed it but I'm still not sure if I wanna purchase it until I see the review here! If I can trust anyone's review 100% is from the baerrito fam.
Please review the new FENTY foundation!!!!
You should try out the nars velvet matte skin tint!!!!!
You can apply the Estée Lauder nude with ur finger tips
Thataylaa, try using a thin layer of the original DW. After, apply DW Nude. You will get beautiful coverage and proper hydration!!! Although you go through a crap ton of the DW nude, at least it builds without caking if used alone. Tell me what you think off the combo of original and nude!!!
You need to post the Fenty Beauty foundation review NOW you're number 21 on trending now, and you could get even more views and subscribers that you honestly deserve. The fenty beauty reviews are hyped right now and highly viewed.
Literally just got my sister addicted to 15DoF and she's not currently in bed at 1am watching your videos from January she's went that far back😂 #newbaerittos X love u girl xx
@thataylaa your eye twitches because of a lack of zinc. If you take a daily vitamin that says it has zinc in it and he still twitch then you need more zinc than that. Just wanted a while not every day.
Oooh I like this one - the ELDWN not the LL!.  Is it my imagination or did the swatch of this look really similar to the swatch of the Dermacol 208?  Since that's my perfect shade, this cool bone one might be as well (at least in this formula anyway).  The same colour in the other formula being so different - I wonder if there was some sort of a mix-up and it was mislabeled since it looked so different (it actually looked way to yellow to be called cool anything).
How do you keep your teeth so white AND still drink coffee?! Taylor teach me your Taylaa ways!!!
I'm newer here. Does anyone know if she has her eyebrows microbladed? Even before make up they looked very dark and filled in. Just curious 😊
Curious, but does make up make ppl break out easier?
Your trending girl! Thats pretty awsome, also thanks for trying out another foundation instead of making this a short fail vid. Your hard work is def. Appreciated and acknowledged!!
Does anyone know if Taylor has tried the Double Wear Light? \nSharon Farrell here on YouTube says it's her favorite. She's lighter complected and has oily skin. Thinking Taylor might like it also...?\nBtw if you don't know Sharon, go check her out. She's a awesome! Does amazing vlogs too. I feel like a lot of Taylor's subscribers would like Sharon. Good for the smart, more mature audience.
i thought this was jaclyn hill in the thumbnail

Hi Taylor love your channel watch your videos daily! :) I must say the first foundation was crap , but I have to say am I the only one who didn't like the Estee foundation on her ??? I thought it showed off her texture way too much and her skin looked uneven in color and it also made her pores show so much more with this foundation. I've seen plenty other foundations you tried look absolutely beautiful.on your skin but this one for me didn't do it for you .
EW ! This is why I have trust issues 😣
Your skin looks bad. I would NOT put ANYTHING on it. Eat pineapple and get some SUN! It will help kill the the acne causing bacteria and smooth your skin out. Fresh cut pineapple every other day for two weeks. And no makeup for two weeks.\n\nStart with that and you will need a lot less foundation!!
honestly, that lottie linda foundation was trash... kinda like my ex. 🤷🏻‍♀️😂 but you honestly looked sick, but by the end of the video you looked fabulous!! 😍 i’m so sad this season of 15 DOF is almost over 😭
Sub to my channel trying to reach 1 sub
Slag
You're trending! So happy to see more people watching you! You deserve it 💁🏻💁🏻
Goddd I love your videosss!!!
We needed this in our lives
Let's hope Nintendo doesn't knock it down.
Even though I still have my 64 and the original game, I still wish this was for Mac as well so I can play on the go 😭
(Gets taken down by Nintendo)
How long until Miyamoto opens up your butt with Mario's nose to remove this from the Internet? Ya' can't infringe on to that copyright, bro. Or else you'll have to take 'shrooms.
Is this a rom or executable?
It won't be long until nintendo shuts this one down...
Now I know how to join the server \n\n\nI had to enter my real ip address and find my port number\n\nThats why I couldn't join
i give up this doesnt work if been trying for hours watching different videos on how to do this and they all dont work i cant get project 64 to work at all and yes im on windows i have the files and im using them right according to all the videos and i was really excited to play this game but to it doesnt work too freaking good to be true
Does this work on Mac, and if so, can I play with my PC bors?
*I have not been this aroused, since I learned from Isaac Newton - that putting all the colors of a light prism together; makes white.*
And its me WA HA HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!
Idk why but when i try to open the SM64O tool nothing happens...
Will more characters be added in the future?
Eat that, IGN and Nintendo.
This truly is fun!
Where did you get this version of the theme song? It's so good!
I'm still here.
I made a script that loads the emulator with the rom and loads SM64O so enjoy noobies https://mega.nz/#!sAw0gBAI!3U2lS5XbcSMiQXZwDea47O5tKYaz5iJyq2Dr8H9lXsU
This mod proces that L is real.
Can't wait to try it out. I bet an online multiplayer Jet Force Gemini Tower Defense or Zombie Defense game would be dope too. or Mario Party Online.
Is it possible to play on LAN?
I miss this game so much wish they have these on samsung phones ipad or iPhones.
Sadly I cant find a copy of the original rom everything I can find has about 4 PUP add ons nor can anyone post it for me ALAS.
Will this give me a virus?
The game have a coop mode?
screw all these features, i get to play as WALUIIIIGI AND WAAAARIO
It's like a weird episode of SMG4
wheres the download to the online tool?
so many errors on the website
Can someone try explaining how I can download and play this?
May as well turn a bad acclaim game into a online game like wwf warzone or ecw
Nice Way of IGN Stealing your vids to make $$..
it works on mac with WINE, and PJ 64/
holy fuck this is amazing
Cease and desist in T minus 10... 9... 8...
I have this on ds
I don't think the collaboration thing is gonna work out as well is expected.
Why do I keep getting kicked out of the discord.. I'm not doing anything wrong.. just asking for help so I can get in Mario 64 online and so.i can make a vid on it.....
I need it so bad
Aaaarggh!!!!! I can't connect to a server no matter what i try, and for some reason i can't join the discord to get help!!
0:20 A good summary of every single Mario Co-op session I've had with friends
man, that sucks that its not on mac.
having some issues (with gameplay, not installation.) related to the wing cap\n\nluigi and peach both fly way too low. and it's impossible to get the wing cap star with them, from what i can notice.\n\nIs there a bug report page?
how i create the ip
Where do we get this
how do i get this for my Mac?
When I connect to a server it does not say im logged in
I believe the SM64O website and Discord are down. I don't have a good feeling about this. I haven't been on much today, but if Nintendo really pulled this project the day of their Direct then I'm honestly pretty disappointed.
Discord Is Down For SM64O, SO anyone? We correctly port forwarded on our router and everyone at the house can log in to SM64O On Our Server but my friend who lives in another state cannot? Any one encounter this as well? Solutions
i thought this video was taken down by Nintendo?
322 braindamaged downvoted this video
Yeah Boiiii!!!
Headass
YOURE A LEGEND
Whoever disliked, has no PC.
YEAAA BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Good work ! my friend :D
Xbox 360 controller support?
Never leave us.
In freaking sane.
Absolutely necessary 👍
Sucks ign stole this
Now I wanna see SM64O speedruns :D
You sir, are fucking awesome!
Kaze Emanuar...stop making my dick hard.

Wait....Is this real!?
Daisy doesn't even get a look in in a fan mod ;;
In the credits in the tool it says to find the Easter egg. Has anyone found it? Maybe try putting in 2401 as the port
Is it possible Mario Kart 64 could play Online?
Is this supported on Nintendont?
Kaze Emanuar you really revive the old game! You Awesome if u weren't there the game would never be alive again. We all love you ;)
What's sad is that this gonna be DMCA'd by nintendo
Does this give credit to the old projects like this? Because this really isn't new, besides the characters.
Nintendo's lawyers are gonna have fun with this one.
Can u play as bowser?
This is a countdown until nintendo ruins this
Nintendo will do anything they can to have the download taken down, but its been up for at least 3 days now so its not going away for long when they do
Enjoy the fuck out of it before Nintendo shuts that shit down
I have 2 questions \n1. Does it have malware\n2. Do you need an N64 Emulator?
is is for Mac OS X
I would drag my balls through 5 miles of broken glass, while watching all every Amy Schumer comedy performance whilst reciting the alphabet backwards just to have unprotected aid sex with your third grade teacher in a airport Dennys bathroom just for you to consider subscribing to me.
DMCA Takedown in 3....2....1....\n\n\n\n\nhopefully not, this looks fantastic.
Pc right? Like I'm on my phone rn so I haven't opened the links. YOU SHOULD DO THIS WITH THE ORIGINAL CONKERS BAD FURDAY. OMG THAT WOULD BE AN AMAZING MULITPLAYER
Does anyone know if there are any licensing issues to deal with?
Great!! Now please do Mario party and conkers bad fur day!!!!
I can't find how to download the game. The link isn't working for me
This is fake
Make on for Chrono Trigger, Mega Man X, or Legend of Zelda Orcana of Time?
Wait, this is legit?
Fuck this therapist seems like an incredible person.
Coming from someone involved in Psychology. This is beautifully described 😍 I love this! Katie you have a follower!
So apt that the advert that popped up is that movie downsizing, as when i go into DP/DR limbo, i get this weird feeling of altered perception of size and spacial \n\nP.s, intregued to see how cbt goes for you on the disassociative front, as i dont feel it'd help me, but could maybe take inspiration if it helped someone else 👍🏽
Wow, this was pretty eye opening. I always thought the therapist I had went to when I was younger was doing a weird type of CBT which had stopped me from seeking help again in the future cause I hated it so much, but I think it was EMDR instead. Something in your video just clicked and made me look it up and holy shit this changes things. I have been avoiding going to therapy again cause my previous one made me feel like I had to say something after each section and that I was somehow failing it. I might go back now...
DODIE WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR GLASSES PLEASE
I think I have derealisation and I think I have for alot of my life. For me because of this school can make me quite anxious and to hide how I'm feeling I just tend to act up around my friends and be confident and obnoxious and be a goof because then I don't have to deal with it. I definitely don't have a full blown anxiety disorder though. I think because i feel like I'm always dreaming, I get anxious that I'm going to bump into to someone or say the wrong thing. That sort of thing. And to ground me, I always have my gryffindor  scarf as being a huge potter head (and proud) Having a harry potter item helps me to ground and focus.
I was really stressed in the past week and I felt really tired even though I was sleeping really well. I got this notification and didn't want to watch it, I was really sad I just wanted to sleep. So I finally watch and realised how helpful this is. Thank you.
I have depersonalisation and take 175 mg sertraline
Hey dodie my advise from a tall guy from Luxembourg. MORE ASMR all the time 24/7 :D
Dear Dodie, \nyou two are true angels and just saved my day. I had really bad anxiety and epsiodes of DR and DP within the last weeks. I suffer from this for about a year now. Even though it is better now than when it first started, my life has changed for the worse ever since I collapsed on the grass in a park last summer (first severe panic attack out of nowhere).\nNormally I'm not that sentimental but this video made me cry because I feel so understood from both of you! \nI try to explain it to my friends and they are wonderful and listen but they don't understand what it means to not live in reality and to not feel your own body from time to time. It is a struggle and it is very real..\nDodie I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for bringing awareness to this mostly unknown condition. It means so much to all of us that suffer!\n\nThank you and keep going strong. We know how hard it is. You can do it. We can do it! ❤
does anyone else feel 'numbness' in yr arms or whatever like it not there BUT it is there? idk some1
So I think I have this?? I don't really know, I want to talk to my mom but sometimes she´s like you are just finding out diseases that you see on the internet or stuff like that and this really sucks because I can't enjoy my life when I'm spaced out and I really hate it.\nThank you so much for doing this video, I'm going to show this to my mom and ask her for help<3
For the first time I dissociated an event this last week. A friend was in a car accident and i witnessed it all in my rearview. It was terrifying- I thought he was dead. I vividly remember detail and images, but throughout the experience never felt present. Even now a week later It doesn't feel like an even that happened. I wonder if derealisation is something that ive had, and this event only magnified it. For some time now I feel somewhat absent minded, and can't remember most of my day or week. Only more recently have I looked into it more but I dont know where I am as far as set label i guess.
I don't know what I have like I always have time slip through my one ear and the other like I can't remember simple things like conversations I had today and when I look in the mirror for to long I look different, like not myself. Does anyone know what I have?
This is very helpful!! I have a dissociative disorder (including derealization/depersonalization) and it's very nice that you opened up about it!! DR/DP is very scary to experience sometimes and it's great that you're spreading knowledge.
@doddleoddle Derealization is talked about in the song Anziety by Logic, if you haven't heard it. Thank you for making this video <3
This was so informative and helpful. That shattered marble like clicks perfectly to what sets me off sometimes. I hope that I can find a group near me to just feel the same around and talk about it.
this was a really helpful video!!! thank u dodie
This is a strange state to be in. I feel dead inside..like I'm in a sort of purgatory...just observing unable to participate..for me it started out very vibrant, clairvoyant and i was full of life (for the first time) for about 2 months..then it cascaded into this place of isolation and disconnectedness. Calling it depression isn't quite right...because that would be a sensory experience.
THIS WAS EXCELLENT IM DEFINITELY SUBBING HER
I immediately recognised Kati from that one Always open episode that I put in my then-newly-established Important things playlist. So now I have a ton of collab videos in my watch later playlist... Time to get to watching ~
one of the first medications I tried was Zoloft, and it didn't work for me at all. I've been on medication since I was about 13 or 14, and I didn't find (what I think is) the right medication until I was about 16, and even now, my doctor checks with my medication and considers changing my cocktail of meds! :) i'm afraid of therapies like TCMS because I'm not really familiar with it and I'm afraid that it will be dangerous! I've only tried CBT, and I didn't feel like it worked for me. I am trying a new therapist at the end of the month, though, so we'll see how that goes!
thank you for making me be more aware. thank you for making me research and learn. i love you. thank you.
My doctor prescribed me 50mg Sertraline for anxiety, taking that tablet was one of the worst experiences ive ever had. It was horrendous. The side effects are not worth it.
this is so helpful, thank u so much~ glad i'm not the only one feeling this way.
I just cannot be really really happy when I should. Like, even if something amazing happens I just cannot feel the happiness, even if everyone around me is happy. It's weird, and partially sad, but I often have mood swings switching between super-happy and the can I just shut down my self-sabotaging brain mood.
Well..... I've learnt a lot... HeLpMe
I'm pretty darn sure I don't have any of these but I still experience this stuff on occasion. Is that normal? Just like sudden moments of self-awareness like I am a human I could be seeing colors that are not anyone else's colors what does water taste like and weird stuff like that, but not very often.
i had a panic attack today in class and i didnt know what was going on but now i know it was dissociation
i remember seeing a post on tumblr of the behaviors of depersonalization and it hit me that this could be what was wrong with me. i researched it for like a week and saw myself in almost all of the signs. i brought it up to my mom and she didn't even ask why i thought i felt this way. all she said was you can't believe everything you see on the internet i'm still very sure i suffer from this. i don't even recognize myself in the mirror or pictures anymore. i almost caught myself asking my friend who this strange girl was in our group photo. i'm so so tired. and i don't know what to do.
when Kati said mindfulness, it made me wonder ... have you tried/considered trying meditation?
Wow this explains so much for me. I've struggled with all of these due to mental illness and trauma since I was a child. Thank you for this video.
When my derealization gets really bad I become paranoid about if my reality is real and feel like I'm trapped in a dream and I'm on the brink of lucidity in the dream, just not quite there. I focus on specific things happening in the environment and with my body and tell myself these are the things I will remember from the dream when I wake up (but I am awake, so when I'm asleep). As a writer, most of the stories I write involve parallel/multi-layered realities, so I've labeled my derealization as moments of inspiration because I'm in the head space of the stories I write.
i think i have this ??? a few days ago after an assembly at school i got up and went to class but as soon as i started writing everything seemed so blurry and i couldn't get my brain to process that everything was real and i felt like i was in a dream. ppl's voices seemed far away and i felt like i couldn't move but when i did it hurt really bad. and after the bad part stopped i  just felt so empty ?? i didn't feel like i could really fEEEL my emotions the whole day + everything that had happened didn't feel real and it made me feel so empty and disconnected for the rest of the day. + it's been happening quite often since then. welp that's enough of dec ranting bye ✨💖🌙
i am soooooo happy that dodie talks about this. this helps me soooo much. just the fact you can recognize these things and not feeling alone! im soo happy with this! there are no words for the gratefullness i feel right now. i love you for that
i have derealisation/depersonalisation and i've heard from so many different places that the best thing to do is to talk to someone, but i don't have anyone to talk to. i feel like none of my friends would take me seriously, or even think i made this up for attention. what should i do?
I do this, I didn't know it was a thing! I used to do it subconsciously, zone out when I got stressed, but I've trained myself to do it manually.
Thank you so much for explaining, now i understand it better and i dont feel like a drama queen or something anymore
Fastest 10.5 minutes of my life
been a waitin for this
She is so incredibly interesting! I could listen to her for hours. and this video kinda explains what I've been feeling for a while. ❤️
i get something familiar sometimes. i sometimes feel like i've gone numb and i feel slightly 'spaced out'. it's confusing :/
Thank you so much, Dodie. I have been struggling with this for so long and it comforts me to know that I'm not the only one out there.
This was really helpful, thank you!
I have a few kinda medium-sized rather recent traumas, and my therapist did this emdr-esque thing with me when I was having like, constant derealization and flashbacks multiple times a day for weeks where we'd talk about it and then when I'd get too deep and start not to be there she'd stop me and we'd talk about something that gives me comfort in really vivid detail. It was incredibly helpful and my flashbacks basically stopped after that, even though the stimulus that was causing them got worse.
EMDR is so frigging strange. I did it and it worked but man, that was a weird experience.
Hi Dodie, do you think you would be able to keep the text on the screen for a little longer if possible? I never have time to read it all! 🙈 love your videos and thank you for posting stuff like this. I don't suffer from any mental health disorders, but I always find it so interesting hearing about it from a first hand experience!
I took Zoloft a few years ago and it made me way worse. I've tried a few other medications over the years that have really helped and made a huge difference, so I really hope you find a good fit for you! <3
I love you both ! Great video !
THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO
It''s so wonderful to hear anyone talking about derealization on such a big platform, thank you so much.
I just realized I must have something like this. Omg.
wow that was useful. whenever i had dissociation, i would call it dreamscape because everything felt floaty and dreamy but in a bad way.
I have derealization all the time as well and it is so comforting to know I'm not the only one thank you.
YAY KATI!!!! I can't believe you two collabed!!! This made me so happy when I saw this video in my sub box
Awwe I'm so proud of Dodie. She has learned to talk about mental health without over sharing.
I have derealization and depersonalization and it's really hard but your videos help me.
I think beginning to try and get out of your state ( whatever your problem is, wether it's depersonalisation/realisation or anxiety ) is the first step and maybe hardest, for some people, towards healing...
loved the description of the childhood little Ts as i've never really thought about it in that way before!
I have the same glasses, but in pink :))
I don't have depersonalisation or derealisation but watching this was really interesting and really quite soothing. I feel like when I come to a mental block I can use some of these tips so thank you :-)
Isn't it annoying when you have to go back and pause the writing that's on the screen for 2 seconds for comic effect
holy shit. I think i have derealization. i always feel like i'm not actually 'there' like it was all a dream. i thought it wasn't a mental illness i always thought that it's just me being weird? but i didn't have any traumatic past though. i'm really scared.
thank you. i really needed to hear this today, knowing that im not alone and that what i feel is valid <3
This video was VERY helpful for me to explain the differences between the 3 words. I have disassociation every single day, as other things happening in my body adds to this part of me going: ah, shit! Panic! Let's get out of this body quickly! It can show on me in many ways- feel like I'm floating being tied to a balloon so there's still this level of groundedness, or I have moments, especially when I'm not on my anxiety meds, where I just feel loony and I cannot connect what I am seeing to me, as if I am in a video game or I'm always strapped into a VR headset, it's terrifying and no one I've said about it so far really thinks this is real or it's not all in my head, so I just wanted to say thank you Dodie and her Therapist friend hehe ❤️❤️
When I get really depressed I don't recognise myself. Like I'll know I'm the one moving my body but it doesn't feel like me and when I look into a mirror I know it's my face because I know I'm looking into a mirror but I don't recognise it.\nThe longest that it has happened for one time was about a week\n\n*edit* When you were talking about small childhood issues that weren't that big but seemed worse at the time. At one stage the back of my hands were hit with a wooden spoon until my knuckels were bleeding, things like that still dont seem like a small issue
I finally know what to call this feeling;;;
this was super interesting to hear about, my knowledge of mental illnesses was super limited up until recently and i find learning new things like this, thought it is sad its kinda at your expense...
I'm really reluctant to say that anything's wrong with me given that I'm so young, I've never had anything traumatic happen to me and I generally have a good memory, but I looked up a list of dissociation symptoms on a very reliable health website and I related to 8 out of 10 of them.
Katiiii! I love this woman. Her videos saved my life, particularly her video on intrusive thoughts. I have severe OCD and I had a random spike in 2015 and I was very close to ending my life when I came across Kati's videos. If you're reading this Kati I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart for saving my life. 💕
i don't know why i'm crying halfway through but thank you for this. <3
So informative and helpful thanks lovely girls x
As someone who also suffers from derealisation and depersonalisation and is constantly told by therapists, I don't know what's wrong with you, or I don't know how to help you, this video was endlessly helpful for me. Thank you ❤️
When I got trama last year in my freshmen year and my way to cope was talking to myself which then turned into a imaginary friend. This friend then began becoming abusive (since they were my own thoughts) and kept me up at night. I haven't talked about it with anyone cause I'm 15 and I feel like they'll think I've gone mad...
This is super interesting and it actually helped me understand a few things about myself.
I've had derealisation since I was really young but I never knew what was really happening. Lately I've just started to think it was something related to my anxiety. Thank you so much for making this video and explaining all of this it really helped.
This was so interesting!
Even if I don't have derealisation or depersonalisation I have that kind of thoughts sometimes and I had anxiety and depression all this year and all your videos helped me so much. You talking about all this things makes me feel good because I found someone who knows what I went through all this months because even though there are a lot about mental illness in pages, there are not many people who actually suffers it and talks openly about it. Thank you so much Dodie. I know you're going to get out of this and that you're going to be able to feel yourself again.
Thanks for this fantastic video! During my worst stages of anxiety I experienced depersonalisation and derealisation for 3 months straight. Luckily through coping techniques and talking through my trauma I overcame it and haven't felt this way in years. You got this Dodie! ❤
Hi Dodie! \n\nLet me first say that I love your music and your videos! They make my day better :)\n\nSecondly, I would like to say that I'm a 20 year old Music Education student and I was wondering if music therapy could be an option that you've considered for derealization/depersonalization. I'm not a doctor, but I do strongly believe in the results that music therapy can bring. I'd like to maybe know your thoughts about it too :) Does Britain have any programs like this (I'm from Canada and I do know it's becoming more popular here)? Could this be another helpful thing for people with this disorder?\n\nI don't want to seem bossy or anything; I'm just curious about what you think and I'd like to help in any way that I can haha. \n\nKeep making videos Dodie and keep being an inspiration because you are doing amazing things :) Thanks :)
thank you dodie for uploading this video. I understand more about derealisation and know there are other mental diseases out in the world noticed. Maybe I do have something or maybe I don't. Overall, you made my eyes open and make me feel real for just at least some minutes.
This comforted me I haven't recover since something that happened 2 years ago and to bring my brain back too! ❤️ \nI get headaches and anxiety too! And I fiddle so much and fidgeting since recovering from my trauma but I also might have ADHD too and still have derealisation too but I'm not diagonised but I know I have been going through depersonalisation for 2 years
I feel like I have dissociation, but it's not during moments of stress or trauma. It's mainly brought on by being awake in the middle of the night. Could being awake really late cause a trigger in my brain?
she shares a resemblance to  chloë sevigny in looks and in the way she speaks aswell as her tone of voice, great vid dods
I think one of the most difficult things for me to understand with my own dp/dr is that you need other people. You cannot solve disconnection through isolation.\nAlso, YES. If a friend puts their hand on my back or an arm around my shoulder or something like that...it's so grounding that I almost immediately want to burst into tears. Very powerful.
Thank you so much for talking about this so openly. It has made me realise a lot about myself and my own mental health issues. I didn't realise that a lot of stuff that goes on in my head is actually derealisation and a lot of my stuff is anxiety related but you being so open has really helped me, so thank you. Sending lots of love. Xxxx
Dodie i add spanish translation for this video.....plz give them a look.
It's weird because everything spoken about in this video is how I feel 24/7 but I ain't gonna self diagnose. I mean yes, I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety but I dunno, I'm on meds and they help alot, with some stuff but I dunno :| at least I guess I'm not alone?
I almost started crying while watching this video because I felt so relieved to have someone clearly explain what I have been feeling for over a year now. I never fully understand why I felt so drawn to Dodie but I think it's because I related to her so much and this further proves that. Thank you for putting yourself out there and talking about something that society has deemed inappropriate to mention in public.
this is so helpful!! thank you
I have dissociation and derealization all the time. I don't remember the first half of my life because of it... it feels like you're super drunk and you can only recall small snippets of the night while forgetting other parts because you've blacked out.
It's the first time I'm hearing about the term derealisation and I realised that this could be the word for those weird moments where everything felt like a dream. I do not experience such moments very often, but there were a few situations in my childhood and also at two parties when I was a bit drunk. Those moments which felt like a dream always happened at night when it was dark outside and when there were many people around me. I hate it when this happens, but thankfully it only happened about 7 times in my life. This seems so strange to me, because what could be the reason for those moments of derealisation?
I've experienced that a couple of years ago, and it was just terrifying. I had no idea of what was going on and I thought I was about to lose my mind. Now I see I'm not alone. Thank you for sharing that.
Welp I relate
I rarely comment on videos when on YouTube as I have a lot of anxiety surrounding interaction with people at any level, online or in person but I wanted to share this poem I wrote some time ago, and this community always seems so nice. I think it describes some of the feelings I was going through at one time in my life and watching your videos has made me think I may have been experiencing some form of depersonalization....\n\nIs this face mine?\nIt blinks in time with I\nWhen blue it too sinks, to a sadly painted hue\nIn its cheeks\n\nAnd as I, walk and talk my way through time\nIt too ages with the mind\nforming every crease and every line\nI question still:\nI may be real but is this face mine?\nOr is it merely borrowed to one day be returned?\nTo trade in all that I have loved and all that I have learned\nFor another soul to grow old,\nOnly to ask a question asked through time\nIs this face truly mine?
I'm always so confused how you can like “test“ if you have depersonalisation or derealisation because how can I know that I feel spaced out? Like sometimes I feel like in a dream but then I'm like: “ah no it's real“ and that's it idk it's weird
I think my worst problem with experiencing derealisation(other than ya know, dissociating for weeks at a time) is that I know exactly what triggered it but it wasn't traumatizing in any way. It was like a switch in my brain which caused panic attacks that lasted so long that I numbed my emotions into derealisation and it's just confusing.
My brother has depersonalization from autism so he likes the therapy tools that have texture or squish. His nerves can be kinda disconnected so he scratches himself to the point of bleeding and won't feel it. And he works himself up into nervous rashes because he doesn't know better (he's a 4 year old level). He doesn't sleep fevers off he just cries. And he can't talk (no language) so he can't tell us if he's feeling sick we just have to know. He refuses to go to hospitals. And sometimes he refuses water. We tend (me and my family) care to him 24/7 someone *always* has to be in the room with him we can only leave him alone a few minutes and he gets sucked into his own world. We're basically his caregivers. He's my disabled little brother ❤ luv him always. He also likes music I don't know if this helps with depersonalization though? Happy this video made me think about things more in depth. Look from a bigger perspective (autism, depression all those issues). I don't have depression so I can't say anything about that.
I couldn't stop staring at Kati. She has something mesmerizing, I don't know if it's the way she talks, acts, her mimics... is that weird ? XD
Really enjoyed watching this video. I don't have depersonalisation or anything but hearing kati talk about some of those things were so interesting and make me really want to study psychology. I went through and read to comments and so many people are saying they're struggling. I know this won't help or do anything but I'm so sorry you're having a hard time <3 I hope you get the help you need and I do believe that everything will turn out okay <3 xxx
SHOUT OUT TO DJ TIM COOK
How much did DJ Tim Cook pay you to release this sponsored message ? ;)

This song is like Mancunians' National Anthem
Noel and Liam are both brilliant, we've gotta appreciate them both as singers and songwriters.
people saying there are 'better' versions, or taking the opportunity to argue about which brother is the best, are really missing the point here.
OASIS would be the biggest Band in the World if Noel and Liam would get along again. These two fuckheads have no idea that they are only one handshake away to rule the world.
Dolly Parton
Gem fucking Archer!
Awesome, thanks for this man
Biblical
Dear deary me Noel was playing at a benefit gig for We are Manchester and some people are going on about fake tears ,Liam's version is better ,as you were blah blah blah ....you people need to give your self a shake and think about what this concert was for instead of all the snide comments you should be ashamed
No ones arsed if there's better version, this version means the most
Prefer it when he plays it properly. Sounds a bit poncey this version.
Why can't Noel and Liam work it out!!
All I see here is weakness.
Instantly I become 15yrs old again when I hear this 🙌🏻
I envy the people that can move on and Don't look back in anger. I can't! Some rat walked into our City venue and blew up men, women and even children. I can only look back in anger as I feel we did nothing about this issue once again. Not having a go, it's just how I feel. I personally would not have been able to walk through that foyet. It's too much a case that the blood has been swept away let's carry on. Carrying on is why this continues. If people stayed away from public venues for a while then yes the terrorist win but not for long as our Govt would act once it hit their pocket. For me, going to the Arena last night would have been disrespect. I am only speaking for me! ✌
He's not crying. Liam is right!
Dylanified Noel is boring
Great Noel!
More brainwashing, you should look back in anger as it will only get worse
Come on Noel, you could have invited Liam here
There's a 100 versions better than this to be honest.
Thlip inthide the eye of your mind
To all you good people out there.................I do look back in anger & I don't want hug anybody.........Amen
Our kids getting blown up is something we SHOULD be angry about. These fucking hippy cucks do nothing but make it easier to kill them. Disgrace the lot of them.
let the man who wrote the fucking song sing it without the whole liam sings it better shit, and remember why he is singing it
Was there right at the front.It was a great evening and a little emotional at times......
I just don't get people who don't like Noel - I know he's not the politest person but he's so incredibly talented and people shouldn't judge his music through his personality.
Liams this year was better
Manchester, what a fucking city.
Well done to all involved heartbreaking but Manchester is united
Imagine if somehow they did reunite Liam's and noels vocals would be amazing now
What about the lisp? Noel never had it before. So strange.
Who's this potato?
All the scummy rag heads who shit where they stand will be laughing at this.Cunts
Please don't put your life in the hands of a rock'n'roll band...
I actually prefer the Coldplay version from the other Manchester charity concert for some reason
Noel a Genie Liam is an idiot on twitter
Appears to be playing a different guitar here than in his 'crying' photos - https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4432333/liam-gallagher-blasts-his-brother-noel-for-crying-during-we-are-manchester-gig-and-tells-fans-not-to-fall-for-his-pr-stunt/
Can we all just chill out and do some class A drugs like
Yes dont get angry European people, just sit back and keeping taking all those terror attacks, because diversity and multiculturalism is our strength, right?
Is that Gem playing with him?
Noel seems to force a bit his voice. He in 2009 was perfect.
Anyone heard that the Manchester Arena has reopened after a bomber killed 22 innocent people?
I prefer Liam singing don't look back in Anger much better voice AS YOU WERE
What a legend 💎love you Manchester
Why is this 18 on trending its got 450 like ffs
Noel can sing live very well
There're both tribute for people who get in trouble; and you guys just talking about who better than who and this is 2017.. FUCK OFF YOU'RE MOTHERFUCKERS. YOU'RE FUCKING RETARD.
I loved Oasis until they expolitied terrorism and dead children. People will do ANYTHING for publicity!!!!
belive you and me he a wanker liam the lad.
Bonehead plays lead on this.noel sings it, an Liam sits down and fucks around for a bit. That's my memories. Top tune. Cum on lads,let's do it properly before we fade away away away away.
So many fuck heads commenting on this! The man sings his songs however he chooses, he wrote them and can do with em what he likes. Fake tears and poncey? He's the only one who's never been fake cos he's never needed to be and what's wrong with showing some emotion? Bore off and get back to your Leo Sayer LP's
About time he gave back to Manchester
Your little girl got her brains blew out by a psycho muslim terrorist and nothing was done about it, but don't look back in anger!
Wtf is Noels accent ?!
Magistral, extraordinario, simplemente asombroso...
Blur > Oasis
Oasis are overrated.
DON'T LOOK BACK AT ARSEN WENGER
So dead little girls are now the price we must pay for our 'tolerance'?
totally flat vocals,  manchester deserved better...
Amazing atmosphere
Noel is a chump
Anthem 🙌
Beautiful...Follow That Liam ignorant little rat.

Just amazing Noely G x
💛
As if singing songs is going to stop these muslims from killing. Britian is weak now and is just full of feminine men that wear tight clothing and have gayish haircuts  that are too scared to fight. Yeah lets forget the kids that were blown up and also the families that dont have a kid anymore. Mark my words the way corbyn,the Jews and the globalists are letting more muslims into europe there will be more attacks on our streets in the future. It wont stop until you stop muslims from coming in and tighten up the boarders.
Shit version of a good song, someone get Liam on
No pudieron dejar su puto orgullo ni para una buena causa :(
Just proves how Great Noel is. Think it shut a few Liam lovers up for good.
Liams version at the last benefit was much,  MUCH better.
I love Noel but definitely crocodile tears
NOEL GALLACHER JUST BACK FROM HIS HOLIDAY, DECIDES TO GRACE US WITH HIS PRESENCE,..... HE WAS QUOTED AS SAYING, AND I QUOTE?!!??..., FUCK ME AND ME MISSUS HAD TOO LEAVE A PROPER HALF ,A DEL BOY,.....(MANC SLANG FOR BIG LOVELY COCKTAIL ) AT THE BAR ,BEFORE WE HOPPED ABOARD A PLANE TOO PUT ON SOME OF THE MOST FAKE TEARS YOU,VE EVER SEEN IN CONCERT,...TELLING YOU ,MAN AFTER THAT IGNORANT STINT, I,LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER HIGH FLYING BIRDS CD OR CONCERT TICKET AGAIN ,YOURS SINCERELY, ...NO CONCIOUS REQUIRED!
This is unnecessarily trending. A different YouTuber can get that same amount of likes in the same amount of time and still not be in TrenDUNG.
Well done Manchester folks. Don't let the bastards get u down. Lot's of love from some random scouser on the interwebs xxx
Liams voice is embarrassing. Noels voice has improved year on year while his brother sounds like a karaoke singer
the whole Manchester thing is getting Abit old
Don't enter the comment section, it's full of uneducated Liam Gallagher wannabes and fake musicians slating the song, when they can't write any themselves. I love people but god damn there are some cunts in this world. All arguing about irrelevant shit whilst completely ignoring the fact this gig was held in memorial for innocent human beings, many of which were children, whom were killed in a brutal act of terror and violence. I was there Noel and you sounded amazing, the version you played was perfect for the occasion and the 15,000 voices singing in unison was a sight to behold. God bless our angels, they'll never be forgotten...
Liam absolutely failed on this song.
As ace as it was, Courteeners were better on the night.
Yayyyy, look where winning!!!, instead of jailing and deporting the 2000 Muslims on the uk watch terrorist list, shutting down mosques that are proved to be preaching hate speech, stopping the influx of Muslim rapefugees, let's just forget that young children, men and women died in this place and have another music concert. Is this what winning looks like? English people are some of the weakest snowflakes in the world. (Am British born and bred) and am ashamed.
Better singer than Liam ever was tbh
What a fine sight !! Noel playing to the people of Manchester - his HOME city. Welcomed back with open arms - and a LOT of love. Peace. Rx
Still playing this shitty tune after all these years...
The killers never fail to amaze me. Thanks for uploading!!
they are going to get sued by ripping Pesonal Jesus from Depeche Mode
Thank you so much for uploading. This one was my fave of the night

Now this makes me want to start wearing dark coloured lipstick but it ain't autumn yet! 😩 but it feels like it though!\nSLAY Casey SLAY❤️
LOVE this look!!!!! And that liiiip!!
Hey Casey! I know you've always had to take into consideration your rosacia and texture when it comes to foundations, and I don't know how you feel on whether or not you want to help soothe it, but I have a family friend who works with a brand that's helped absolutely clear hers up. Her rosacia was more intense than yours, so if you'd want to try it out I'll add the link to this comment. I hope that this doesn't come across as rude, I just wanted to offer another option if you were interested in trying to clear up your texture and rosacia. If not, you can totally ignore this comment! :) Here's the link! http://www.tropicskincare.com/ This could maybe be used in a video too since they have makeup as well! Anyways, I'm a HUGE fan of everything that you do! xx <3
Probably my favorite video you have ever done!
Girl these lashes compliment the look sooooo well! i need to start wearing lashes for sure lol

Can you do a cream contour video !! Would love to see how you contoured with the studio skin foundation like you talked about !
Fall is my fave too for makeup, clothes, weather, everything. Love the look, especially the eyes :)
Thank you I just found my fall go to look. Your the best!!!
Will you do a review on the new found brand by Maybelline. I seen the brand the other day in Walmart! So it's drug store.
Casey i'm so sorry that your beautiful video was spammed with disgusting links... I had them reported. \nLove you! Stay beautiful!
Please continue to do videos like this! All of the beauty gurus are so focused on posting videos of reviews on products that they don't even make tutorials anymore and it's discouraging to those of us who want to learn how to create certain looks or recreate them out of inspiration from you guys. You're by far my favorite YouTuber so I'd love to see more!
You should try lash magnetics!!! They're magnetic fake eyelashes
Stop this YouTube channel please it so bad 🦑🦑
omg a fall decor vlog 😍😍 i can't be the only one that's obsessed with home decor and i loveeee seeing other decor videos... ESPECIALLY fall ones 😍😍😍
Hi Casey! Ive been subscribed for a while now and you have become one of my top YT's to watch, i love your personality and how genuine you are ! Keep it girl 🤗😉😚
Maybe you could just use a putty knife?  you really think you look good at the end of the video? NOT. Too bad for you that they closed down the biggest circus around, their goes your future!!!
Can you do a video on the technique you used to cream contour with the Smashbox foundation?
I LOVE THIS LOOK!!!
Have you done Fenty Beauty?  Please a review of those products.  Thanks for this video.
I love love love your fall makeup looks! Fall is my favorite! I would love if you did a fall look with the Kylie Burgundy palette. I just got it and want to try new fall looks with it!
Girl you look bad with make-up But with out it you look beautiful.
I'm loving this eye look!! What do u think is a good drug store switch for eye shadow pallete?
Casey! Have your tried The Balm Schwing Liquid eyeliner? I am in love with it! It has a felt tip, but is firm enough to give good control and dries down matte which I know you love! <3 You gotta try it!
did no one see the mountain of product come off of here brush when she did her highlight
Casey, are you going to try the Fenty Beauty line? I can't wait to see you do it!! Especially the foundation!
The lip color made it look like your teeth would glow in the dark :)
Casey can you block these sex channels that are commenting? Remember there are young girls watching your channel. :(
Honestly, now that you've moved the mic so it doesn't pick up with clicking noise of the camera focusing... I kinda miss the clicks 😂😂
I have just discovered your videos and I love them! Have you ever tried limelight by Alcone foundation?? So many people trying it on my Facebook feed.....but they're some just trying to sell it....so I was just curious!
i love it when u said that you're either full glam or bare faced, i'm like that too lmao
Can you tell us if the eyeliner you used in your water line did bleed?
Im 11, i dont do my makeup, and im not into beauty videos but the makeup looked cute in the thumbnail 😌
You have to be my favorite to watch 😘😍
You should your favorite perfumes and not so favorites!!!
I love the eyebrows lately. I think using pencils makes them look much more natural
I hate when I can't skip the ad, especially when it's 3 mins(!!!) long. How can I avoid this torture???
Its 99 degrees out but I'm about to go rock a dark lip because Casey is :-D
Bring on the fall looks girl! Love love love
@caseyholmes did u know nyx is in walgreens!? And/or your local drug store
Absolutely love this look and YOU LOOKED 10 YEARS YOUNGER with your hair down!!!!❤️❤️
you look so good
Talking to Davis about your little diy fix cracked me up. I know that face, I've made it many times lol. When they see something you've fixed haha. I just love you even though I shop after each one of your videos 😶
yeiiiii!!!! loooove love how the look turn out!... im a fall makeup person sooooo this makes me happy
Gorgeous! Can you do a Fenty Beauty video?
Was not ready for fall, but then saw your thumbnail and Ughhhhh so ready to dive right into the pumpkin spice abyss lol!!
I love 💄 it looks great on you Love your video
You should do a video on how to use darker foundations to contour! :)
GURL. Do me a favor. Please do an in depth bridal tutorial cause honey this SC humidity has got me worrying for my wedding next month 😣😭
Finally got power and wifi back due to hurricane Irma... what do I do? Rush onto YouTube and watch ur channel to make sure I didn't miss anything! 😂😂 I got priorities 🙌🏼
You look very pretty with this look 😍,if any body here speaks Spanish stop by my channel 👏🏼👋🏼😊❤️💋
reasons guys have trust issues
My boyfriend and I have a 10 week old Mastiff, and he loves the sound of people over the phone or computer.  I went out of the room quickly and left your video on and I came back and he was staring at the screen tilting his head lol so interested!
He can aim like a god in ow but can't put pepper in a fkn bowl lmao
Episode 2 : Mickie Pad Thai
He is a cook!
More of this omfg yes!
If we use your recipe will we all become grandmaster?
That where you should use salt
what the fuck is that tv in the background? THIS IS 2017!
the views on this type of videos
*watches in Swedish* those are to big! But damn do I want that sauce!
can effect make a kimchi?
next is micky cook thai food, please.
I don't know why this is a thing but give me more of it.
oh my god
Infinite Pma and knowledge.
Ack!  Curl your fingers when you are chopping ... last thing you need is a missing digit bro!
I'm crying like when I play overwatch RIP
If you cook this your aim will increase by 69%.
No offense, but the recipe could use some tweaking.  You should add 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to the meat mix and sear it first so it has a good crust and develops flavor. Then bake it.
I use the same salt as you does this mean I'm good as you in ow
Looking forward to more videos, Teach these Gamers how to cook :)
i wanna see reactions from when the rest of the team eat it
I'm from Sweden and I take offends to this way of cooking meatballs.\n\nKappa.
I love Taimou and I love NV this is so great
Those captions tho \n\nSeriously though top notch work NV can't wait for episode 2
Why the fuck did I watch this? XD
PMA is giving this man so much success. InFiNiTe KnOwLeDgE
I swear i love the team envy channel😂❤
If you tear up from onions then that means your knife isnt sharp enough
WHY DO I WATCH THIS? ? ?
lmao who does expected such video came out
Shank mince
Great  content! The scream at end make me smile, great attitude and seems like a chill dude. #mcm
next time make the other teammates try pls!
WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE?!
Taimou the GOAT  of everything !
I want to see any of the CS squad making baguettes
The way he saws the onion with the knife was cringy. Just slice through it, Taimou. :)
I got stoned last night and dreamt you made me these Timo.
I love how EnvyUs does these non-gaming videos to let us get to know the players even more! Can we get Mickie to cook some Pad Thai next lol?
How did Taimou knows that burned heavy cream taste like ass?Maybe he has ate someone ass before.
keep those fingertips curled back. Don't overwork the meat either or it makes it tough
wow taimou is so talented\nnot only is he #1 mercy NA he's also #1 chef NA
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen
2:36 i guess you can say he's beating the meat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI guess I'll see my way out then.
Music needs to be down to at least half volume.....otherwise, funny watch.
Things like this are the reason this team is my favorite.
Gordon Ramsey's onion cut technique
When taimou wants to do angry meatballs he slams the meat to the bowl
that knife positioning is wrong thumb should be behind your hand, to reduce the chance of cutting yourself.
I ask to soon the secret rogue crepes recipe and he answer me to ask to taimou
He cook, he eat, but most of all he dont retreat.
That's one real finn😂😂👌 \nIf he wouldn't be a gamer he would be a cook
i like this, pls more
Timo make a small slice through the outer layer of the onion and it all peels off at once
Tbh this channel should just turn into a reality show, showing the daily lives of the team members.
Now we need the cocco lasagna
Hahahahah wtf is this
Eat my balls.
taimous the best xd

Needs more salt
Did a good job didn't you 😘
Your audio is still really low
I adore your style in your flat. So many people do all neutral, which while pretty, is not me. I love that you infuse color, textures, unique art pieces into your space-imaginative, personal, creative, and warm!! Perfect!!
That Astro little combo is so freaking cute!
that smeg coffee maker is cuter than me
Astro + Rocket = <3
Really like the style you are putting together for your home. Love the missoni blanket, but if you want a more affordable one that you aren't scared to use the The Tartan Blanket Co in Edinburgh is great. Beautiful woollen blankets at a great price. I have a multi coloured one on my bed. 👌🏻
your videos can never be too long. The more Victoria, the better 🤗
That fireplace is so beautiful!!!! 😍
Vic, everything is so pretty! I cannot wait to see more. xxx
That book title that's behind your head 😂😂😂😂😂
Looove homeware hauls! I am such an interior fanatic haha :) The prints are stunning and love your personal touches with the spaceship and all :))
👍👍👍❤
Your make up in this video is gorgeous 😍
Absolutely love the watercolor plates and bowls!
Amazing 😉
LOVE THESE VIDEOS!!😍😍😍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Love this home haul👍👍👍💋
AMAZING PIECES! <3
Love every piece
Astro❤
Love your style!!!!!
Love it!
Your homeware haul is amazing! ❤️❤️ Xx
Those watercolor plates are BEAUTIFUL!
Hi! Beauty! Do vlog about your books! What Kind of books do you have? From? ❤️ your flat is so clean and it looks like fresh also
Iloveyou 😘
So cute!
Absolutely love how you've decorated your new flat! I don't think there was one thing in this haul I didn't loove lol
Love how colourful and bold you've been with decorating your new place Victoria, and really bringing both yours and Alex's personality through in everything you've bought! Love love love all the gorgeous pieces. Beautiful as always, thanks for sharing, xxx❤💛💙💚💜😙
some very nice stuff you got there :)
Your videos make me happy 😊 can't wait to see the house tour x
Everything looks so so nice the way you have set it all up
I would love to see a video talking about your favorite fashion books! I am a personal stylist and am always looking for more info/inspiration from books and other sources!
The Behaga line from IKEA is very similar to your new table wear... probably not as nice though. Anyway justa heads up if someone is interested 😊
Bloody love your new place!!
You're always such a ray of sunshine!! 🌞 Congratulations on moving!! The place looks gorg, you guys did great. 💖
perfect timing as i also tried to redecorate my flat i already have enough inspiration where to look and what there is on the market 😍
Victoria belle i see u always at my tv but cannot give likes there. You are amaizing thanks for yr cool lov.videos👉👏💖👌chic😇 xo
looks amaaazing! we have also just moved -  so i love the home vlogs! was wondering, did the flat come with hooks/holes to hang pictures?
Vic, I truly love how you remained authentic and true to your own aesthetic by including quirky pieces that don't just fit into to the typical blogger home decor style! Those atypical pieces are the ones I'm favoring.
Omg that fireplace is to die! 😍😍 love the old charm
some really cute stuff. Already checked them through your blog...to bad they're mainly UK based. #Canadian
Your makeup on this video is on point! You are glowing😍
Your homeware and the aesthetic are goals. The plates and bowls are my favorite thing ever, because I love kitchenware above everything else. Luckily and unluckily for me, I moved and really had to narrow down everything, so I'm not looking to buy anything else right now (emphasis on the right now). Also, the couch! I can't wait to see the couch!
£374 for a throw makes me wana cry a little
Absolutely love the artwork! What size did you get the japan print in? was thinking about getting some for my uni room
What is that lip color? love!
can't wait for the flat tour i love everything you've bought and the colour schemes! ❤️
Love this love your style vic 😍
Love all the items😍
I can only  imagine how happy I would be to live in such a beautiful apartment as yours !❤️❤️ Absolutely stunning 😍
Just moved into a new house so this is perfect timing 😊🙌🏼
Your flat is my ultimate homeware inspo! The first thing that drew me to your channel years ago was your love of bright colour (I am also an avid lover of turquoise) and in a sea of bloggers going for monochromatic everything with a 60% black you are such a breath of fresh air! My boyfriend and I are also moving this week and I'm pretty sure he's gonna love that steampunk lamp!
Oh my goooodness! Amazing bits, I loved it. Spending my evening daydreaming looking at graduate schemes and flats in London now so I can shop homeware haha!💞💞
You look so beautiful..I love the home library behind you..makes the house look warm and comfortable 👍🏽
Where did you get your beautiful pink velour chair, love love love that chair, I need one in my life. Love your videos x 😊
I say that's the best when i see that video caption in my sub box! Victoria making homeware haul, yaaas 😍
babe! you need to do a tutorial on this makeup look!!!! soooo glowy! amazing! what foundation, highlight and lip is it!? xx
Victoria. I love yours (and Alex's) taste in furniture and homewear! Your new flat is looking amazing. Interior goals right there aha
LOVE the lighting and background setup
Thanks the video so helpful.  lOVE U
I love it how the background book is saying f you just next to your beautiful, cheery face :'D hilarious!
Love your style, so glad you love your new flat. Seems like more of a home! X
I can't wait to move into my own place and be able to decorate 💁🏼
You look beautiful and happy in your new home!!!🌷🎀💕Love your videos!
You've got a lot going for you babe✨✨✨
Everything you have chosen is just perfect for you and  Alex in your new flat. Great style.
I really love all the things in this haul! I think you have a great taste and it's really similar to my style. I just bought a flat and I really want to start decorating it but I'm going to rent it out first so I can't do it yet 😩 I really want to see a flat tour!
in love with all the pieces !!! looking forward to see the fourniture too xx
I want to move and decorate now!!! 😀😀😀😀 I love your new place 😍😍😍
Great stuff but the real question is whaaaat is on your lips?? 😍  So pretty!
OBSESSED with the dinnerware !!
Loove this video 😍
Had to pause the video to say how much I love the Art Deco tiles around the fireplace!
You should design a collection of home wear! I got two cats who destroy nice things in my place but I'll buy ur collection in a heartbeat.
You have such an amazing homeware taste! Thank you so much for recording this. My bank account isn't so thankful though.
You're such a pleasure to listen to!
i love your new flat and how you are decorating it!! btw, don't put your parfums on the window, it's not good! :) x
Subscribedddd xx Your makeup looks so glowy and i luv ur lipstick xx What lipstick is it? :)
Definitely just added the Edison bulb light to my list of Christmas ideas for my boyfriend. He would LOVE that!
Don't keep your perfumes in front of the window.. they'll lose their intensity
I love how it says F*CK Y*U in the background LOL
Love it. Also the naughty book behind you made me laugh 😂
im so obsessed with this new set up. its like the perfect combination of colorful and clean. its so lovely to look at while you talk! haha (also love the little f*ck Y*u easter egg in the background! hahaha)
You did a very good job!! I loved it all!!
Hi Victoria! I'd love to see you do a video on your coffee table book collection. I couldn't help but notice them behind you! I'd love to hear which are your favourites and worth investing in since they tend to be quite expensive. \n\nAnyways, as always thank you for the great QUALITY content you give us on all your platforms ♡ \n\nLots of love \nxoxo
That astronaut has to be the coolest piece of homeware I've ever seen!
Love all the pops of color and the personality in everything you have bought. Looks like such a warm home!
Loving the 'F*CK Y*U' book in the background 😂
Love all of these pieces😍\nAlso what foundation do you have on? You're skin looks amazing!
your new background is so cute!!
Your new flat is lovely! Do you think you'll stay in London long term? X
Super cute stuff ! I moved in March and all I got so far are canvases for the walls and some plants .  Hahaha ! I'm not lazy, I just don't have the eye or the skill for decorating.  Wish i did !
You can buy fake versions of those flowers from Home sense if you have it near you
Loved this haul! So relaxed and enjoyable to watch ✨ aha yes and I also bought that mirror after seeing suzie get it, such a beautiful style and the size works perfectly for our big lounge 😍
For prints  you should try desenio!!! X
Snap 🙋🏼 I'm just about to edit a homeware haul xxx
Hi Victoria !!! Congratulations for meeting (x2) VB in NYC :-) I love the rocket and the astronaut thing ! Fun fact, I wanted to be an astronaut when I was younger lol I was wondering if you will do a roomtour or appartment tour ? xxx from Paris :)

OMG I LUV DA OPENING♡👍
Omggggg.................... love the intro❤️❤️❤️❤️
BEFORE I GET A MILLION COMMENTS ABOUT IT, YES I KNOW THE FOUNDATION DOESN'T MATCH! It looked really great in the beginning but obviously oxidized to be WAYYYY to dark by the end of the video. In front of all of my studio lights I couldn't tell but it's very obvious on camera. I love the foundation but will definitely be picking up a lighter shade!
I love you, but boo that ain't your shade and you're fucking forehead makes me cringe
The one thing I don't like is the packaging of the highlighter. I legit made a dent in my highlighter. A part of me died when I dented it lol
Flashback Marry: aww darn, this was supposed to be my big return!
APPLYING WITH A BEAUTY BLENDER WILL GIVE YOU THE SHEEREST COVERAGE.
y'all bitches telling james to blend out his forehead: did you not watch the video? he said that the contour was really hard to blend in and had basically already dried down before he could blend it in
i just noticed how fast he talks ! I was like woah lol
the makeup blends better w her makeup brushes, the beauty blenders soak it up
U talk too much
sis i thought you were  quiting/taking a break from you tube.. \n\nAre you mad because you weren't invited to the launch party?  I believe you're a great and unique beauty influencer and they should have invited you. Shame on them but thanks for your review and you hair looks great sis.
the race war has begun.
This was  a great review! It's important to provide the positives and negatives of the brand. If the consumer base doesn't provide feedback, the company won't know which products they should improve and the ones they should expand on. You did great!
You calling everything sister makes you sound like a nun or something
The foundation wasnt that bad, people need to chill.
I love that he was being so nice to people of color
idk how James deals with the hate whatever he does he is always judge..not saying his perfect but why come to his videos just to hate?? i dont watch youtubers I dont like smh
Omfg why does he look so beautiful with and without fucking makeup can u please teach me ur sercret love u james charles and
I feel like he would have liked the foundation more if he used to the brush instead of the sponge
14:46 peep his makeup like behind his ear oh my god.
he said that at the speed of light lol 19:55
You're perfect James! Doesn't listen to the haters babe! 😍🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I don't see what the big deal is. Charles did not give a bad review. He gave his opinion and last I checked we live in a democracy. We don't need to read him to filth.
First time watching you and I love you. You same very fair and sweet. Keep up the amazing work.
trying to copy graveyard girl much?
Sis I just want to say that the foundation is supposed to be medium to low coverage so it makes sense that you would have to pump about 10 times to give you full coverage.
Dark beautys I love that
i couldn't stop laughing at this part 3:16-3:20
Should've used the brush to get full coverage since it doesn't soak up the product like the sponge does. Smh
Omg you bring life to anything...love your honest review
ive watched other reviews and it seems like all the olive toned foundations oxidize orange a no for me too overpriced for the name
read the package on the sponge!  it says only to dampen for medium coverage, dry for full
I just find it funny that his review is so different compared to most of all the other fenty reviews🤔🤔
1. this sucks 2. watch the end  in 0.5x lmao
Lmao my dumbass was wondering why it looked like there was no coverage on the foundation when he was actually putting on primer....
lol I wonder why you wasn't invited HMMMM💀💀
im gonna buy the foundation and see what else i like
the whole line is so orange
Wait... what number foundation is he?
I watched other beauty gurus try this and there reaction was priceless. I think even though u use a beauty blender more, u should have tried large brushes cause I heard there good and i wanna see u try it out, I think the crème products would blend well with the largest brushes as well. U should try all the hylighters :D
If you use a brush you wont have to use as much foundation!!!!! I use the Fenty beauty brush and I only use 2 pumps
**this is just a question this is not hate**I believe that the sponge box said that you should use it dry for a full coverage look
Yellow/orange clothes look so good on you, James!
Come onnnn i think we can all admit he looks so adorable in this video XD
love you but ur talking very fast lol
this makeup looks so messy i don’t know 🤷🏽‍♀️💀😂
The foundation and sponge said if you want full coverage use the sponge dry, and for medium coverage use it damp. I was trying to find a comment to see if someone mentioned it. I'm not being negative. Just thought you should know 🤷🏻‍♀️
WOW 😱😱great look, can't wait to get my Fenty products...thanx for sharing
OMG I DIDNT KNOW JAMES CHARLES WAS FRIENDS WITH TATI = my life complete
I shat myself when I saw Tati I wasn't expecting that
YASSS SISTERRR !! im so proud of you , and honestly fuck all the hate , drown out the negativity with positivity love 💓💓💓
I had to put the damn video speed to 0.50, is need my inhaler if I spoke that DAMN FAST
Why pay for the darkest shade of you're going to just swatch on someone else anyway? You said yourself that it didn't make sense to do it on yourself
Is he religious or why the heck does he keep saying sisters it's annoying
Omg you are the real ken😍😍
Let's go ahead and remove the CARTIER bracelet down can you be anymore Humble!! Damn I mean flaunt whatever you want, flaunt the things you earned for working hard but..... I feel like that came out very conceited, like everyone knows it's Cartier calm down with all that!!
If you guys want to watch a good review of the Fenty Beauty line, go watch Jeffree's. He follow the directions
hater gona hate. potatoes gona potate!!
Cc
Weren't you leaving YouTube ?
Wow you are so unreal!
Damn, James doing straight up blackface.
Dude ... U talk too fast 😲😲😲
slow. down.
OPEN YOUR EYES
-PIGMENTED- lmao
17:10-17:21 I laughed so hard
Your eyes 😍😍
Hello world
FLASHBACK MARY\n\n\n\n\nAAHHHHHHHHHHHH😵
anyone else notice the orange forhead
Kylie is shook
9:06 James:This looks REALLY good\n\nManny:Yea like REALLY
Yesssss you slayyyyyy
His blue eyesssssss 😍
That orange forehead though...
i like your videos but can you talk slower, please?
why is everyone so annoyed with the way he talks? good lord if you don't like it just watch someone else 🙄
why do you talk so fucking fast
I literally have to slow it down to 0.75 ahhaha
Why does he sound he has a cold all the time 😂
This review is amazing. Love ya! ❤
you speaking way to fast
All of his fast movements with his hands are making everything dizzy
hes doesnt mean harm but in reality aint no person of color watching foundation reviews by him if they want something helpful, meaning you shouldnt feel like you have to post about dark shades at all :)
I’m not having a very day but watching James with his bubbly personality makes me smile☺️😔❤️
The fact that Rihanna worked onto this line for almost two years for you to come an tell I'm not really loving it at every product. It's fcking annoying dude.
He looks amazinggggggg!!!!!!!!!! I don't know why but I live his eyes!
The brush is better than the sponge. The sponge soaks up the product because it's liquidy but the brush doesn't and you don't need as much product. The sponge is $16 but the brush is the same price
BITCHHHH who cares if his foundation a different color JAMES YOU STILL GONE LOOK BOMB .
I don't get why everyone is stressing about how fast he is speaking... English  isn't even my first language & I still get every word he's saying, sooo...
Okay. If people are going to complain about him speaking fast then either get used to it, slow down the video if it's giving your ass 'anxiety' or just fuck up and go to another channel. I also speak fast and it's hard to just slow down / take a breath like Bitch we are breathing, its just how we talk. It's not something that he is doing purposely, its just natural for some people and they can't exactly slow down and FOR MANY OTHERS ITS ALSO NATURAL. We genuinely can't just slow down because if we do then we'll get self-conscious about speaking and then speak incredibly slow to the point people would think we're drugged. Just understand that it's natural and you'll just have to deal with it or you can fucking leave. Kay kay.
I feel like that yellowish highlight looks great on brown and dark skintones, it's gorgeous
Do you have a blocked nose?
I don't know why everyone is complaining abt the speed he's speaking like you can slow it down if you need. I don't have to have it on 1.25x for once.
I MADE A VIDEO ON WHY FENTY BEAUTY ENDED KYLIE COSMETICS YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT:)
I love the range but I ain't paying $32 for something you can't even see 😂😂
Dayummmmm I want the whole Fenty line
your hoodie is orange not yellow wtf
Sllllow downnn your talking way too fast oml😂
Your eyes are gorgeous ❤
What an amazing film 😎😮😵
jesus its been out like a week
After 0:05 (5seconds into the video), I couldn't find Sonic. Too fast!
You are my hero don't ever let me down\nYou are my hero don't let me see you frown\nIt's only a mountain you can climb that high\nNo that's not a teardrop there's something in your eye\nI know you can do it I know you'll come through\nAnd if I will follow I'll be a hero too\n[ sax ]\nYou are my hero I know that you can win\nYou are my hero my hero and my friend\nYou know if you take it one step at a time\nYou can climb that mountain hero friend of mine\nI know you can make it there's little you can't do\nAnd if I will follow I'll be a hero too\n[ sax ]\nYou are my hero there never was a doubt\nYou are my hero it makes me want to shout\nI know you can get there a winner by a mile\nWhen I think about it makes me want to smile\nYou know where you're going you know what to do\nAnd if I should follow I'll be a hero too\nA hero just like you
how does the boost at 0:03 work? When I try it I usually end up dying to the badnik
Nice! \o/
At 0:19, after picking up the speed shoes, do you release input to hit the jump on the platform or do you continue to hold forward. It seems like Sonic is considered air born for all but a frame, if you keep holding forward, and won't take any jump inputs. Thanks in advanced!
That was fuckin awesome!
I  thought it was impossible to save more time using the same moves, you are insane! Try walking as close as possible to the board racing before start, I think that way you can achieve more speed. Do a roll jump into the looping, u'll get faster as well. These 2 new tricks can save up to 30 centiseconds!
Love that Zara floral number!!
Aritizia here in Canada is over hyped AND overpriced imo. Not to mention the salespeople are not helpful if you don't shop there all the time.
I love you but I wish you didn't use products that pay to test on animals :/
I liked the red sweater and the big gray turtleneck sweater!<3
Old school vibes !!!! Yes Ingrid yes !!!!! Ahhhh and a target bag so I know it's gonna be good
does anyone know which lipstick/color she is wearing? thanks!
$40 dollars for a black t-shirt?? Pass
Ingrid I Love your haircut so much can you please tell me how to describe it to my hair dresser besides an angled lob?
all            the           pauses                between                each                      word.  I cant!
Wow it's been a while since I've watched, but your style has changed a lot since I watched you last
Hey Ingrid! What ever happened to Taco Tuesgays? I was so pumped for that and it's been a while since you posted a video. 😭
i love your channel!
Can someone please let me know why I am not able to view Ingrid's previously live videos? My notification said she had a live unboxing today yet her channel doesn't show me the live videos. I am able to see other youtuber's previously live shows though...anyone?
Where is the thermal turtleneck from??!!
faded black do you mean grey? 😂
ulta has the batiste xxl powder!!! http://www.ulta.com/xxl-plumping-powder?productId=xlsImpprod6380141
Haters don't know what to comment after this drugstore haul ;)
It's so weird seeing aritzia in LA hauls now Bc for the longest time it's been just a Canadian thing :O
Ingird, can you do an updated room tour ? Thanks!
Tutorial on this makeup look??
Does anyone else get reminded of the Saw movies when they see Target's logo? ☹️
Ingrid I love you!!! Pls pls make more videos 😊😊
You are welcome US for finally getting Aritzia, from Canada, with love ❤  Aritzia is a danger zone store for me!
Does anyone know what lipstick she's wearing??
Do you have issues with getting small holes in your t shirts? I don't know if it's just because I purchase cheap shirts, but I'm hesitant to splurge because I'm afraid it may happen anyways
This video gave me life.😭❤️
the similar Aritzia zipper body suit you have in the description looks like nothing like your vid.
Ingrid, the Aveda shampure dry shampoo is a dry shampoo powder! It's my HG! I think the scent of it is right up your alley!!
Aritzia always has the cutest things. Great video Ingrid.💕💕💕
Please do a closet tour
I still remember when you used to wear that panda sweater 🐼
Her style is soo modern and plain...not my favorite haul
I love Lauren Conrad and Lucy Hale. my two favorites for makeup/hair/style inspiration. =D
why is she losing subscribers she is amazing!
Lol Ingrid if you like Aritzia then you would probably love their annual warehouse sales in Vancouver!
Yes!!! I am the exact same way about my t shirts!! The sleeves have to be longer and the fit has to be right...it is SO hard to find them haha so thank you for the recommendations, I will have to go get me some!!
Where did you get the faded black shirt? @IngridNilsen
Omg I like my t-shirts the same way you described yours!
Hi Ingrid! I really loved your make-up in this video! Could you please teach us? Thanks!
Ingrid!!! I love your shoes! What brand are they? 😍😍😍 #havetohave
Eyebrows look funky for some reason...it's either too far apart or too square. My opinion....
Ingrid, what is the lipstick you're wearing in the video? I've been trying to find a shade like that for ages and it's been a trial and error kind of thing because, as you pointed out, you can't try drugstore makeup out before buying it so I've been getting these shades and have been really disappointed. Also, is that lipstick you have something you would recommend?
Wait I thought she lived in NYC did she move back to LA?
Omg I recently just got the Wilfred Free tshirt in the nude color too! BEST tshirt ever 💕💕
you are gorgeous without (and with) makeup !! <3
What camera lens and settings are you using? It looks amazing!
You should check out a brand called everlane 💕
FYI that Aritzia thermal stretches out quite a bit so I size down!
omg I am obsessed with that red sweater!!
omg please let us know your review on kristin ess products because i've been wanting to try them for a bit
I love these types of videos! I hope we get an update video soon!
Love your current hairlength! Great video Ingrid :-) lovely greetings from Austria
how old is she?
I'm pretty sure I've seen the batiste xxl powder at ulta
this is literally my perfect closet, simplicity in details. I LOVE YOU! <3
Am I the only one sad that aritzia is becoming basic more than outside of Canada😂
I love your videos 😍❤❤
Stop being so cuteeeee i can't handle your cuteness
Love the black body suit with the zipper and the printed pants!
target has some really cute fall clothes and shoes right now! xo from my channel to your’s <3
I love Ingrid but I think it's missing a little floral dress, like that :\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syofDm2KhW8
Crying because Ingrid looks amazing in this video!
Will you update us on the hair products once you've used them up a bit?
High rise, button-fly tapered jeans. Yep, the 90's are definitely baaaaaack! 😱
Love the longer hair
i absolutely love aritzia! for some reason the store on 5th ave in NYC feels quite intimidating though, wishing it was more like the LA store!
Better wear the two floreal pieces not together else they look like a fancy pajama XD
Ingrid are you still focusing on ethical/sustainable fashion? or are you going to revert back to fast fashion?
Omg you finally look like your old self!!!
Ingrid, I really think you should read up on Zara and it's production chain. They're truly not a company worth buying and supporting. I hope you look it up! <3
Sending love your way ❤️ Great video!
The clothes look cute tbh, but sucks I can't afford it :(
So close to 4 million!!! Congrats :)
I miss Vlogmas
Hehe I work at Aritzia :)
Everlane has great tshirts!
does anyone know what lipstick shes wearing?!
Yaaaayyy love your longer hair:)
that red oversized sweater from zara looks gorgeous ahhh that color!!! 😻
So glad you included affordable options!
Ulta carries the Batiste XXL powder.
You look so pretty
OMG YES
Always love your fashion hauls! 🌻

You still wear the camo leggings from HPE?
Ingrid! Please do more of your 'fashion foreplay'!! Would love to see your outfits for fall this year:)
Awesome! I LOVEEE LUCY HALE, and Lauren Conrad so I'm sooo buying those products by Kristen. I had no idea that was even at target; thankful you mentioned it. \n\nI wear my hair naturally which is pretty much beach waves almost daily. Super excited to try it! 😬
i am obsessed with the dry shampoo!
This makeup looks dirty :/
Loved this vid Ingrid! Thanks for sharing your haul. Your basics style is super inspiring! I love the palette of tshirts you have and that floral pant/long jacket set was gorgeous xxxx
I don't trust any products she recommends anymore because half the time I don't know if its a secret ad or if she actually uses them
MOOOOOSIEBEAR!!!! he's so excited that he got to be the star of this video (clearly LOL) follow him on insta!! @moosetheminibully and go tell him that he should still love me even if i put him into a rainbow onesie HAHAH

Hey Nick I like your macaron videos! Do you use aged eggs for the meringue?
I'm just wondering what is the specific reason we make a hole or well in the dry ingredients and then pour the liquids in the middle?
Who else thinks of something else when nick says Add some DABS of merengue mixture?
So this is on trending but h3h3 we one the lawsuit isnt
Who thought of Austin Powers Gold Member??? Lmao because same 🙋🏽
Its so cute how you painted all the outsides of each one by hand xD i'd assumed you had sprayed them. That's dedication!
The scran line, you inspire me alot. Im currently in college getting my associates degree in baking and pastry and i just wanted to say i love what you do and youre amazing.
What kind of cream do you use ?
I wish I could play in your sandbox!  Gorgeous Nick!
Wow they are so gold and look amazing! I really need to give my cupcakes a break and try macaroons :D
Hey nick what do you have to do with your extra batter if it doesn't all fit on the bakingtray. Do you have to put it in the fridge or just leave it out?
Beautiful!

Hey nick 2 question really quick where did you get your gray cake stand and also I was wondering if you could do a cracker jack themed cupcake, cake, or macaron.
SO PRETTY! 😍😍😍😍
Looks amaaaazing! <3
Why do you put food color on the macaron if you re going to paint them??🤔
My son is 2 and loves watching your videos. He hates when i turn it off.
Perfect timing, I've been looking for a gold theme dessert to make for a childhood cancer awareness event! Great channel too!
Giveaway who's with me
Aren't these macaroons and macarons are those coconut treats?

Beyoncé inspired recipes are always the best! 🙌🏽 This looks amazing, perfect video to wake up to today. 👏🏽
that's not how you do french macaron
Please tell me you used an airbrush for the rest of the macarons and that you didn't hand paint each individual one 😵
How about a banoffee macaron? Great video Nick!
im vegan and i left every non-plant based item out. it tasted awesome! thanks

Ha Simon doesn't even react to bend the new cuz ksi said don't FUCKIN react to it
Why does he do the click click 💥
I'm personally annoyed that almost everybody believes that all these accusations of Adam are 100% fact. They aren't, please do some research, and look from both sides before making a biased opinion. Alesa has cheated on Adam, and lied, and manipulated Adam's friends into thinking he's abusive, and mentally unstable. Alesa has kept his son away from him, even though Adam had a custody plan for them to work on. Adam is completely destroyed by not being able to see his son. Mason doesn't even recognize him anymore. Adam is not perfect, neither is KSI, or Alesa, but next time try seeing both sides before making a judgement.
Ksi:these n*ggas ain't ready\nSimon:I mean I am that's why I'm reacting to it\nMe:When the fuck did Simon turn black?
I am not british or American....I understand everything
wheres the other reaction for net nobody's, ksi got destroyed
The fact that your promoting KSI's bullshit, makes me mad :I
Remember when ksi said he doesn't make fun of depression well he made fun of NetNobody cutting himself that was when he was struck with hard depression
I understood the click click line. In America, especially in the South, where I'm from. That is the sound of gun fire, which is heard every night. 
You're gonna have to watch Bend the Knee though, Adam played KSI so hard tbh
4:15 4:19 is just so cringe Im not gonna lie
Bend the knee reaction where u at?
You are literally the best❤️
React to netnobodys new diss ksi gets played the fuck out
2:40 love how simon's face goes blank
Here's the problem: NetNobody wasn't even trying.
Nobody reacts to NetNobody's song because it's fire
mini react to bend the knee
Rract to net nobody dumbass and youll find the meaning. Your just sucking off on jj
yo, he has a point about deji's slow ass rapping
you have to watch netnobodys response
Dude alessa just wants fame that's why she's there
Its over\nSorry Simon, but you were wrong
Bro what do you mean Americans won't get it?
I mean I know he's your friend and all but do you have to lie about the song being good? The disses were tough but the song was dead. JJ lacks the skill to rap

Tom: check out my book club!\nme: YES\nTom: check out my book club!\nme: YES\nTom: my children's book club!\nme: o
The most creative way to release book club soooo good
Wow, it was amazing to announce this in a musical style which was entertaining throughout (with some badass moments from you) :D. Doing a book club is a great cause too, encouraging others to read. Please do more announcement videos like this more often :D
Hell I would like to read those books and I'm over twenty
Also well done Dave, yet another awesome video
deeply enjoying hearing a new song from you Tom! :)
Beleza, mas e o album 6?
More of things like that on youtube please !! 😍😍
Why does this have such a Christmassy feel to it? 😆
Bloody hell man could you BE any more of a creative genius caring baddass?!? This is the best thing I've listened to musicality wise in weeks, and this book club/ book is going to be so amazing that I can't even be angry that you're not in the studio creating more insane music.
Determined to learn all the words to this 😂 amazing as always Tom you never fail to amaze me with your songwriting skills! I'm sure this book club will be a HUGE success! X
I went round humming this all day and sometimes saying the words people thought I was insane wondering around singing book club
This is a wonderful idea for kids! Tom, I am so, so, so proud of you. I've been a fan of yours for years -- since I was a kid, really -- and I've seen you grow so much as an artist, businessperson, and person in general haha. You create such light and positivity with your endeavors. Even though I only know this tiny part of you from your public persona, I know in my heart that you and Giovanna are such wonderful people, inside and out. Thank you for all that you do. I will always here to support you. <3
This is brilliant!\n\nCould anyone please suggest songs like this? i mean fun similar genre like this, i barely know about music btw but i enjoy this so much. thank you!
This was great... Tom, when are you bringing out a musical? Everyone will agree it needs to happen.
Man, I miss tom fletcher sing a new song. hope McFly will release the 6th album.
This Mr Magorium vibe kills me:in a good way.
Absolutely awesome , never disappointed with anything he does he's amazing
Fantastic video Tom - I shall never look at Watford WH Smith in the same way - good luck with your Book Club! x
Wait, I love this???
Channeling your inner doctor a little here Tom?
That was such an amazing announcement video! I loved Clarice Bean as a kid :)
Everyone thinking damn, I wish I was a child again
Why are you so perfect?
Tom that VOICE! When are you gonna be in the West End?? (In your copious spare time, of course)
You're awesome, Tom. It's pretty cool that in every thing you do, I can see plenty of love, care and fun! It's amazing when I have a new notification of a new video of yours. Any of them. It's impossible not to have fun. Congrats, man! The video/song/books are impressive. I admire you the most ♥
I so wanna be like 8
You're set to take over Christmas Panto, check. Musical airwaves, sorted, High profile in kids book world, trending, and what is next? Stay tuned for the next exciting episode.
The best musical... of the world
Quite confused why a 30 something is picking books for kids.......I don’t get it
so that's what you've been busy with, Tom. ;)
This is abs brilliant, well done Tom, amazeballs!!!
sometimes i forget how much i love you but then you do something this extra and i remember
Willy Wonka is to chocolate as Tom Fletcher is to children's books.
Tom you just single handedly won the hearts of the UK nation yet again! Such a brilliant campaign & launch video ACE #TomsBookClub inspiration! 🙌🏻 Can't wait to look at your book list for gift ideas for my God daughter and family/ friends you're so awesome!!
Fantastic, my nephew and I will love these. He gets stuck reading the same series and I'm always suggesting new ideas.
Most underestimated human of our generation!! Tom Fletcher you're my hero
As I don't knows any kids old enough for these books I might have to be a part of it myself, we'll just pretend I'm not 18 because this looks absolutely amazing. Well done Tom
If he announces anything in the future without a musical bonanza I'm going to be very disappointed.
Are we just going to ignore the world's worst security guard there?
This is why I love Tom and Mcfly Xxx
This is filmed at my WHSmith 🙋🏼🙋🏼❤🎉🎉
Am I the only one who needs this song on Spotify and iTunes ? Hehe amazing tom can't wait to go and have a look 🎹🎧🎤🎸💞👓👓👓👓👓👓👓
Please say we can buy this song on iTunes?
This was so entertaining!
I wish I could be part of your book club Tom!! It looks so fun! 😂
OH MY Thomas Fletcher you were born to this THANK YOU for this INCREDIBLE PIECE OF ART OMG I'M SO EXCITEDDDD wish I was a kid again to be part of it, can I ?? hahahahahahahahaha\n\nDon't know what else to say. I love you, love you sense of humour, love all your abilities, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU. Thank you for inspiring me everyday. 💜
Love it! Uah! :) this is great even for me when i want books for my kids on kindergarten!
I have no words for this, oh my God!!!!! hahahahahah
Amazing and funny video and proud of you
This is absolutely amazing
You are brilliant Tom Fletcher!!! :)
What a cool way to announce it!
Now I wish I was a kid to join the book club!!! Great job Tom!!!
this was AMAZING!! I love how creative you are with everything.
This was amazing. I want to read those and I'm 20
Does anyone know the name of the guy playing the security guard?
Fab video and song ...you need to make an album please!!
This gave me all the christmassy feels 😂
Always doing great announcement video.
I'd listen to an album of fun children's songs. Haha. This is brilliant! I know it's just an ad song but oh well
If this doesn't get parents and kids reading nothing will, it is awesome!!!!
LOVED THIS ON SO MANY LEVELS !!!
I've literally come back here multiple times to watch it because the song is so catchy.
I'm 15 but this book club sounds amazing
wasn't expecting to see my local WH SMith's in this video :')
When we asked for new music, this wasn't what we meant
Is there anything you can't do Tom? Absolutely love this! In fact I've just watched on repeat 4 times 😂 Brilliant! X
He's sold it for me. And I don't even have kids
That worker was far too calm walking back into store and finding its been left like that.\n\nI'm actually pretty hyped for this campaign, as someone who works for the company I think it'll be a really great way to get kids to read more.
I see the red glasses are here again 👌
i love that Tom goes all out for his announcements!
I'm 19 and I honestly can't wait!
King of announcements
this is phenomenal\n!!
Excellent video Tom👏🏻

Was a privilege to be there
FC Barcelona is the best!
I am a Messi fan, but that first goal was lazy and pathetic from Messi and also, it was OFFSIDE!

Levante real 1 1 😁😁😁
Grandísimo Messi
Acostumbraos a jugar entre los dos siempre jajajajajaja
Eso se lo han inventado
Deberian subir este video a pornhub.com
Ni el Barça era tan malo por perder la Supercopa ni son los putos amos ahora por meterle 5 al Espanyol. Seamos serios.
Zidane dice voy a ganar la champions sin cristiano ronaldo a ver amigo mío que si hace eso Messi ya te clavo 7 goles y encima empatan contra levante definición de esto: Zidane es decerebrado
Todo mundo ignorable primer gol que es fuera de lugar pero cuando robaldo lo have todos critican jaja
https://m.facebook.com/laalternativa.wasy/photos/a.1667842573435609.1073741828.1658787754341091/1975834385969758/?type=3 \nHola💁🏻Podrias darle mg a esta foto por favor😁? Es para un concurso que hay en mi pueblo, la foto que mas mg tenga se lleva 200€ \nGracias🌟🌟
Muchos golitos a equipos humildes pero partidos importantes desaparecidos
Sin duda, messi el mejor del mundo <3
siempre que oigo al campo gritar el gol me dan escalofrios
Deberían ser conscientes de que leo messi se ha convertido en el típico jugador que rinde en Europa pero con su selección es como un cualquier jugador convocable. Una lástima.
Me parece de tontos enseñar que el 1r gol es en fuera de juego, os estais dejando mal a vosotros mismos que no lo pitasteis
Tres jornadas y messi tres palos y 5 goles, y van a tener la poca vergüenza de darle el balón de oro al empujarbitros
Cristiano que pasa mes si es el Puto amo y ahora te enteras jajjaj😂😂😂😄😄
Busquets, Iniesta, Umtiti, Ter Stegen, Jordi Alba, Messi, Dembelé, André Gomez, Paulinho, Semedo, Rakitic, Deulofeu, Suárez y Piqué... Todos estuvieron muy bien; gran juego del Barcelona, con uno que otro pequeño error, pero en general qué buen espectáculo. Este equipo no tiene nada que envidiarle a ningún otro.
Meses de no ver un partido del Barça; regresar y verlos jugar así da placer. Nelson, Ivan, y Lionel en la derecha es excelso.
Y después de la Supercopa de España todos decían que el Madrid iba a arrasar en la Liga.... quién hubiese dicho que en la 3era jornada ya el Barça le sacaría 4 puntos JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA PRAAAAAAAAAAWWW
*Gracias amigo!!*\n#Love from india Barcelona Forever!!!! ⚽⚽
EL ESPANYOL A SEGUNDA OE, A SEGUNDA OE, A SEGUNDA OE, A SEGUNDA E O E...
Beautiful sensational it was a fantastic game especially having the French guy in made it more sensational go barca team go
Views plz
Unga unga
En que Pais se jugo este partido?
Seems like Messi is playing in the 'no offside' era
Haters Will said Messi was offside 
Primer gol en claro fuera de juego... El farza robando?, Nada nuevo... Sigue todo como siempre,
Grande esa msd
LaLiga is shit
First goal offside
Mànita de hostias a los pericos !!!
Enfermeras, enfermeeeeeerrasssss, enfermeras 😭 donde están bebés?
Por eso messi no quiere salir del Barcelona. Aquí decimos: el que es buen gallo donde quiera canta. Y messi canta muy jodido cuando esta fuera del barza.
Fc barcelona vs Espanyol\nMessi goals 3👏\nFc barcelon 5-0 Espanyol\n
MESIS EL MEJOR DEL MUNDO😄😄😄😄
Messi messi es cojonudo cómo messi no hay ninguno!
EL REINO DE LOS CIELOS SE HA ACERCADO, NUESTRO REY Y SEÑOR JESUS CRISTO REGRESA, ARREPIENTANSE DEL PECADO Y CAMBIEN DE DIRECCIÓN SUS VIDAS\nTHE KINGDOM OF HEAVENS IS CLOSER, OUR KING AND LORD JESUS CHRIST RETURNS, REPENT OF SIN AND CHANGE YOUR WAY OF LIVING.......,,,
No voy a comentar el arbitraje porque quien vio el partido sabe que para nada fue justo... Pero estoy muy hasta los cojones de los errores en el arbitraje cuando juegas contra los grandes. Esto hace mucho que dejó de ser la mejor liga del mundo para ser simplemente un show que sólo ganan farsa y mandril, ayudados siempre por el jugador número 12.
There's like 3 actual good clubs in La liga, this score line is not worth celebrating
refalona
Have they signed any defense btw
your lovely chatty style, all of the lovely soft pillows in the background, make me feel just like i'm relaxing talking to a friend :)
Random but... As much as I like the channel name does anyone else think Carrie Hope Fletcher would be a better fit now? Feel like Carrie's grown past her channel name, in a good way.
Hello everyone!  I'm looking for online friends that have personal blogs..I'm trying to start one and I'd love any tips or help!  I'm not going to post the link here because I'm honestly not trying to promote it I just want some advice, and I for some reason decided to ask around here because out of all the Youtubers I keep up with Carrie's audience is always the most lovely and someone once told me you should surround yourself with people who lift you up and I think the sentiment of the Hopefuls as a whole really captures that for me...so anyway, if anyone is down to help a gal out, let me know! :)
I saw Adams family last night and really enjoyed it, you were so amazing!
You at the end is currently me with everything now, I just got my WiFi connected to my flat after two weeks ahahaha
I love how greatful you are for everything. It is so so important and lovely♡♡ you deserve everything you get xxx
How much I love your tour video's I've really missed your non stop rambling about anything an nothing. Welcome home, I hope you enjoy every second of it! ❤️
I started following Megan, she's amazing. I've had a few years of not liking what I see in the mirror.. no more. Love to you Carrie.xx.
Carrie I want your top!!  And btw I kept being called Wednesday Addams today because I put my hair in two plates!
There should be a cast recording for the uk cast of addams family!! so many people would buy it!
Yes Megan I love her instagram!!!
after Carrie went on about Megan I paused it and got lost in Megan's Insta...#notevensorry
And we loved they you could be there :) LOOOVE YOOOOOOOOU!
What happened to Pete? I feel like I have been missing the fact that they split up for ages!! 😯
I know your instagram isn't a body positivity page but I do exactly what you do with Megan and go to yours as you are so comfortable in your own skin and i identify with you and your body type a lot... YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL thank you <3
Your eyebrows have got so good I am shook
The whole body positive movement is just an excuse for unhealthy habits
How to be happy sounds so good but it doesn't come out until march I want to cry
I have the same t-shirt!
Ah yes the body positivity movement, the only movement that requires no movement.
I'm all for not hating your body but if your heart can't take it then you have a problem. There are no 80-year-old large ladies or gents.
It's somewhat important to remember that sending people free stuff is advertising just as much as starting a campaign with commercials and ads and such; and paying people to share your product just by giving it to them can be both _much_ cheaper _and_ more effective than the more traditional techniques. (Even without expectation that you'll tell anyone you got it, the simple fact that people have a natural/social impetus to say thank you for a gift means that shotgunning a bunch of these out to people with audiences, it's probably well worth it to the brand.)\n\nI've encountered concern about the ethics of this sort of advertising--when brand deals, which pay _much_ more, are also a thing, this technique starts to seem pretty dodgy. Especially since it's an appeal to the brand's supposed generosity (which I suppose isn't always fake--you may well simply have a fan at Google who added you to that list, for example); or, more to the point, it's an appeal to the idea that the brand has done _you_ , the creator whom we love, a favor, and thus we should consider supporting them in return: an idea which can be very dishonest when we consider the opportunity cost to a professional content creator of accepting this sort of advertising.\n\nSORRY FOR THE DEPRESSING ECONOMICS DISCUSSION I just feel this is something more people should be aware of, whatever their conclusions about it. :S
Just saw you on the tube! Now kicking myself that I didn't say Hi. I didn't want u to think I was weird jumping to say hello as soon as I got on the train! :( maybe next time I'll have the courage!
So glad you're happy to be home, and that you're happy in yourself. You reminded me so much of your brother throughout that though, I must say. Which isn't a bad thing? I'm just saying. :) xxx
You deserve all the best. I love you're videos.
The body positive movement and Megan literally changed my life. There really aren't words are there?
With you amazing voice I have to make my request. Can you do Ave Maria? I can't get enough of all the songs you do but something touching but sad like that or Bottom of the River is what my soul needs. You voice is hauntinly beauitufl so please consider it!
Carrie! I'm so glad you shared this. Her Instagram feed is honestly so inspiring! I'm so glad to have that in my life now. Those books sound wonderful (and you nailed the pronunciation of Como the first time you said it!) - you're 100% deserving of receiving it all!
In love with Carrie's makeup and figure lately. She looks so mature yet graceful. Feel like I've watched you grow up from your old videos with Dan and Phil and the Vamps to now lol. Always be one of my YouTube faves🤗
Home is fab. Glad you get to chillax at home for abit.
Going to see you tomorrow 😊😊😊😊
Hahaha. The last clip was just too adorable. Thank you for making the best videos. 💗
How to be happy really sounds like the plot of the game The Cat Lady. Beautiful game, you should all check it out!
Are you high because where is your energy coming from?
WTF Carrie? Why do you have body image issues? Your body is amazing. You're so thick, and proportionate, and have curves in all the right places. I know naturally thick girls who managed to make themselves skinny that don't look nearly as good that way. Why not just look as good as you can for your body type? I mean, your body type is pretty awesome.
I started crying at the end when you started talking about home because I've only just left home for the first time to start college across the country. Everything's wonderful except my brother and dad and mum and old friends are missing. There's nowhere like home.\nSaw you in Dublin a few weeks ago by the way - you were sensational, as per usual
See you in Belfast in October!
The first Disney song would be 'Under the Sea' because The Little Mermaid is the best!! :D <3
I like your vlogs a lot, but I LOVE these sitdown videos. Happy you made one!
The Google bit at the end was so cute. Lol.
I've miss your chatty videos and your sofa! Welcome back Carrie
Adore how excited you got by the speaker at the end😂
I'd laugh so hard if you received some Coca Cola through the PO box from Oliver XD
You seem so happy and excited to be home and that instantly makes me feel happy just from the vibes you give off, you're amazing 💜💜💜
I want that speaker! Omg omg it's brilliant!
does anyone else think that's the Wednesday lipstick ? xxx
Don't take home for granted is something I've come to realise in the past few weeks. I've been working all over central and Southern Scotland and though I've seen cool places, I find myself craving the little corner of the world I call home and am always super happy to be back 🏠
Carrie kinda speaks and has the vibe of my history teacher! She is so passionate about things
This video really made me smile. I just noticed it when the video was over. It must have been you ;)
So good to see you home Carrie! <3 Missed that big ole purple sofa!
Welcome Home - I don't know how you could be away for so long!  I'd miss my bed too much.  And excellent choice for Google Home to play :)
I just started reading your new book and I CANT WAIT!!
Carrie you are basically my favourite human being and youtuber and my awesome honorary big sister and never let anyone tell you anything mean. Thanks so much for my manual for growing up, All I know now. Keep smiling and keep being......EPIC!!!!!
Why is How to be Happy by Eva Woods not being published till august of next year :,( It sounds so FANTASTIC
How Carrie feels for megan is how I feel for Carrie
The end of this video made me smile so hard 😁
I love my google home!!!!! They are so good!
I love that you mentioned Jonny and Lucy's wedding. Lucy works for Rock Choir which i go to and currently am working towards myself and so i knew Lucy but had no idea she was engaged to Jonny until I saw Gary's photo on Instagram! Such a small world, hope you had a lovely day <3
For a second I thought Carrie had used a green screen because she missed her flat so much.
Carrie, your glasses are SO cute! Sorry if you've answered this before, but where did you get them / what brand /style are they? (Or does anyone else in the comments know? I'm in the market for cuter glasses!)
I just sent a letter in the post to you today! Hope you like it! 😋
I love your t shirt
I don't know what it is but something tells me that Carrie is happy to be home. ;-)
thank you carrie for introducin me to megan jayne crabbe, i'm in tears scrolling through her instagram <3!!!!
I'm sure hundreds of people have already asked this, but what lipstick are you wearing -I need it?! Love the video and I will never take home for granted xx
My hubby got me an Alexa for my birthday back in April. I think he had more fun playing with it than I necessarily did but it's handy for things like setting a timer from the naughty step for my 3 year old lol. Random things I have to do each day lol. Oh that How To Be Happy book sounds kind of sad but that one and the Body Positive ones are going on my Wishlist. Possible purchase once I get through my Book Club book - oh my days it's hard work!
Interesting I have a arc of the same book but it is called Something Like Happy, instead of How to be Happy, weird. I guess in the States and Canada the name is different.
Really loving that lipstick colour. What colour is it? Happy that you get to spend some time at home and I hope you feel better after a sleep in you own bed.
Carrie, just as you feel at home and relieved to be home in the purple flat, watching your videos makes me so much happier. Your videos make me so relaxed and happy and just thank you so so much, love you honorary big sister ❤
Home Is Where The Heart Is
I just came home to my flat after about 2 weeks.. and even though this isn't as long as you've been away from your flat, I can 100% relate to you right now! This is the first video I've watched since I arrived here and it filled me with even more joy about being home :D\nEnjoy this feeling, because I most certainly will!\n\nHave a nice day, Carrie :)\nLots of Love from Munich!
I love homey, comforting videos like this ❤ I can't imagine how nice it would feel to finally be home after so long!
Hi Carrie & all of her lovely followers! I just started a podcast with my best friend called Shipwrecked all about fictional relationships & the fandoms that inspire them! I would love for you to check it out. We have episodes on Sanvers, Bughead, Ezria, Disney, and Dandy so far! Our next episode comes out October 3 all about Ron and Hermione (proud Hufflepuff here!). Anyways, here's the link if you'd like to check us out :) https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/shipwrecked/id1228774307?mt=2
the slight aggression when telling us to follow megan was just great ++ megan is a queen
You're a youtuber Carrie! Youtube is owned by Google that's why!!! lol So cool!
Thank you for the suggestion! I just ordered Megan's book on amazon, should be in tomorrow ;)
Carrie your face when e speaker plays little mermaid is pure joy :) nice to see you home, and as someone else has said you deserve everything as you are the busiest woman I know and I'm a mum to a 3 year old hahahaha. Keep smiling x
Absolutely love your blogs, your performing and your books, girl! And you're a Gryffindor, like me! I wish I could have a voice like yours one day 💖
Carrie!! It's fantastic to see that you're home sweet home.. but I'm also panicking a little as I am coming to watch the Addams Family on Sat and have been really looking forward to seeing you perform. Please please please tell me you'll be back with the cast by then?! Glad you're getting a well earned rest and home visit though, you certainly deserve it xxx 💜 xxx
Welcome home, Carrie! All of these books sound great. I want to read them all.
Ah, I've missed seeing your pretty purple flat! 💜
Book openings are great videos!! As are all of yours xxx
The sheer joy of that speaker when under the sea comes on 😂😂 love this!!!
I was just thinking the other day of how I hoped you'd do another bookish post soon, and here we are! I would gladly watch you talk about books for ages. Definitely ordering the Body Positivity book and How to be Happy. Enjoy your time at home! ♥
I literally react the EXACT same way about Megan, I actually cannot find the words to describe how much of an impact she has had on my life and well being like holy crap, what a fucking incredible human being. I've followed her for just over a year and honestly, she means the world for me. You and Megan are honestly my idols in life, you have both had such a wonderful and incredible impact on my life in SO many ways I will never ever be able to find the words to thank you both.
Home doesn't feel so good when had to give your kitchen to a massive spider and it's not possible anymore to get food from your own fridge.😭
Hi Carrie\n\nI recently watched you in Manchester for the Addams Family U.K. Tour, and I just wanted to say how amazing you were and how much I enjoyed it. Also meeting you after the show made my whole year. You are such an amazing role model and have inspired me so much.\n💜🖤💜🖤💜
Luuuuuv you

This rules. Could we feature this on our show Highlight Reel? We link out/credit.
Hi BeeJayTV, can we feature this clip in our next GTA Fails & Wins compilation? with credit to you of course :)
Trump is a nazi.
It is confirmed. Melania is a reptilian from the TV series V.
God bless the USA. God bless President Trump.
Dident Trump reduce FEMA when it was needed the most?\nIdiot.
66. Thats the combined IQ of that orange ape and that east european whore.
Mrs Trump Looks like the Alien woman from V-The Visitors.
Donald Trump is trying so hard to do the right thing and do what's right for America and Americans and all Liberals are doing is trying to shit on him at every turn. I can't wait until 2020 when America rally's behind Trump and liberals are scurrying away like the filthy cockroaches they are. God bless Donald Trump and got a bless the United States of America.
he IS our president now.  so let's give him some time on this.
14 - 09- 2017 AD From the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad possessor of the Book’s knowledge to the American President Donald Trump, a fact that I do not speak of Allah except the Truth ۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞\n\n From the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad possessor of the Book’s knowledge to the American President Donald Trump, a fact that I do not speak of Allah except the Truth\n\n In the name of the Greatest Bliss that is greater than the bliss of gardens of bliss that is the Bliss of Allah’s goodly-pleasure over His servants which you hate — O community of human satans — O you who hated Allah’s Book the grand Quran and hated what Allah sent therein of Truth but you hate the Truth and you want to extinguish Allah’s light for the worlds that is the grand Quran, in spite that you believe in it, and you are of the witnesses.. \n\n O the American President Donald Trump, you have instigated Allah’s wrath over His Book the grand Quran because of you decision and your determination on fighting Allah’s Book the grand Quran, and you want to extinguish Allah’s light that Allah sent it down as mercy for the worlds, the grand Quran Allah’s light to the entire people, and you are of the witnesses upon this — O the American President Donald Trump to the fact you are not of those who gone astray; in fact you are of those upon whom the wrath is brought down. And I announce to you and your loyal-friends wholeheartedly inside and out — the grievous chastisement, and I hope from Allah to take it away from your loyal-friends whom they seek protection from the evil of Trump; in fact I announce to your loyal-friends whom are of your ilk from the human satans whom they hated Allah’s goodly-pleasure so He made their deeds null (fruitless), so listen to what I say — O the American President of Jewish origin — what I will say purifying it with the vow by Allah the Great Who gives life to bones:\n Indeed, what afflicted you from hurricanes of the swelling sea it is from the intensity of Allah’s wrath against you (as consequent from) your turn away from believing the Awaited Mahdi in of dialogue before the appearing, and Allah would never afflict you with a sign from the consecutive signs of chastisement except it is greater than its sister so be of the witnesses upon that until comes Allah’s command then your necks would remain subdued and you would testify that there is no God except Allah, and Mohammad is messenger of Allah, then your necks would bend in obedience to Allah and His khalifa in the earth and His servant the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni, and you announce the repentance and ask forgiveness from Allah my Lord and your Lord, and if you refuse then I announce to you a chastisement of Allah the strongest in punishment at nine O'clock exactly in some day at night or in a daylight, and it might be soon, so flee from Allah to Him, and serve Him Alone, no partner for Him, and do not say that Allah is third of three, desist is better for you — O community of Christians; in fact He is One God glory be to Him above what they associate (with Him), and we worship Him, we do not make distinction between anyone of His messengers, and we are Muslim-submitter to Him. o our Allah, I have delivered the message. O our Allah, bear witness. So if you turn away then wait surely I am too with you of those who wait. \n ..And peace be upon the sent ones, and praise be to Allah Lord of the worlds .Allah's khalifa and His servant; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni\n ____________\n ۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞ ═۞www.the-greatnews.com/showthread.php?32400-
President Trump please end the epidemic of fatherless kids in USA. Obama supported welfare states/foodstamps & deadbeat parents' amnesty.
I thought Michael Jackson was dead ????he's with trump !!!!
They don't even talk to each other - but I hear they have great sex- \nMelania  “That’s true, we have a great, great time.”
Grats on your retard Pissident
Melania is like the female Terminator, Badass.:)
Has Science have discovered God?\n\nBased on the Harvey and the Irma hurricanes destructive effect on the state of Texas and the state of Florida plus the raging fires of California we could say that God is real and whenever man says that his laws, here in the United States of America, should be above the laws of God then we all get into big, big trouble.\nFor instance, according to the Bible, God made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day (Exodus 20:11). Therefore, God’s authority of how things should be done on earth is much higher than the authority of President Trump, the United States Congress and the United States Supreme Court of Justice and above the authority of all American voters put together. When non-believers in God, as described by the Bible, atheists, secularists and evolutionists take the Bible out of the public square and out of public teaching the influence of God’s Holy Spirit is greatly diminished within the American population and the United States, like other nations where God’s Ten Commandments are ignored and violated generates many assassins, rapists, thieves and people making false accusations against others.\nFor instance, places where we have people with widespread lack of knowledge of who Jesus and His Apostles were plus their specific teachings such as in the Key West, Florida, the crime index measures the rate of crimes in any area on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the safest areas. This area earns a two on that scale. In other words, 98 percent of areas in United States of America are safer than this one, making it the most dangerous area in Key West and one of the most dangerous in the nation. Moreover, places where Jesus’ teachings are widely ignored such as in Houston Texas, we will find out that Houston’s murder numbers are posted for 2016 and they remain at a five-year high. Records show 302 people were killed 2015, leaving behind families who were ripped apart. You'll find that the occurrence of violent crime in Houston, TX is 135% higher than the average rate of crime in Texas and 159% higher than the rest of the nation. Those crimes are committed because God’s authority is diminished in the hearts and minds of people that are highly unfamiliar with God’s Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3-17 and the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the New Testament in the Bible
We need to build a wall.
*IMPEACH THIS MIDDLE EAST KILLER OF MUSLIMS WAR CRIMINAL TRUMP!*
Did the Russians write it for him
First glance I thought Melania had nipple slats on her top, realised she didn't, stopped watching
At last something really big mr Trump, it's called; Due to Global warming. !,
For those going on about how he is worried about lives...this man is a climate change denier. If he was really worried he wouldn't have left  the Paris agreement. Hurricanes will only get stronger according to the scientists... so I really don't see how he is worried about lives more than money.
God bless President Trump and God bless America!  MAGA!
I love our first family!!!  President Trump is so wonderful and he really gives hope and Melania is just wonderful also!  What a beautiful woman and so humble !  I dont like the Michael Jackson shirt though to he honest but if she likes it, that's all that matters!
Lives not money \nTell that to the people that can't afford healthcare.
Fema and their Walmart shelters are are rumoured to be concentration camps what **** is he talking about?????
This is could be a comic sketch. Right Melania go for distraught and sad! Er um pout pout, i haven't mastered distraught yet, er will this do pout pout. Wild desperate eyes behind glasses rolling around in their sockets. Living the dream darling!?  Most dysfunctional couple ever to set foot in the white house.
Harvey and Irma Hurricanes have taken away  all the Bad News Media about the  Things Happening to Trump.
Coast guard..if you talk about branding ?  no brand has improved more than the Coast guard ..BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA..yeah i think they've done well since ..1792.LOL  as Bugs puts it..what a maroon.
Thank God we have a President who really cares and wants to save lives. Not playing  golf like...
Melania never has anything to say. Does Donald ever let her speak? She just follows along like a stepford robot. Hides behind those glasses looking uncomfortable. ????
the brainless loony trolls are out today... guess soros is paying them to act like goons online too. BAHAHAHA sorry you lil pussies need to realize President Trump is gonna president for 8yrs whether you throw you temper tantrums and wet your panties.\n\nSTOP BEING SORE LOSERS but then again, when you don't have any accomplishments in life and nothing to look forward to, I guess being a SORE LOSER is the only thing that keeps you going! \n\nmust suck to look in the mirror everyday and see nothing but a pure Grade A loser staring back and hating your own existence! your daddys must not have weened ya off the peet because ya actin like a bunch of whiny pussies who need to go suckle on it!
Lives not money. Glad to have a president that really means that when he says it, unlike the ones before.
Like how he ended it but I'm not a trump supporter, trump was not a dick rare
haha he waits until he gets a bad question then he's fed up.
i CAN'T END MY DAY WITHOUT COMMENDING MRS TRUMP.. MELANIA TRUMP HAS BECOME SOMEONE I SO GREATLY ADMIRE.  OUTWARDLY SHE HOLDS THE CARDS ON BEAUTY...BUT THE LADY IS JUST SO ENDEARING... VERY MUCH I RESPECT HER.
The President is always on the Job !!   First time in the last 29 years !!       *M.A.G.A. !!*
Damn she is super cute. Trump should hold her hand and be more romantic in public.
I like Trump BUT he fuckin needs to learn how to god damn talk better than a todler. JESUS man its so bad i wanna cry
Please , Melania ! Take OFF SUNGLASSES .!!!!!!!!! I've been seen you most of time wearing sunglasses \n Do you have a EYE problems ??
Trump should have gone onstage and said 9/11 was an inside job
Humble suggestion: Hurricanes will cease if we follow the teachings of love of Jesus Christ with undocumented and dreamers.  Apply now.
Love this conservative president, much better than the liberal Hollywood puppet.
He's got a lot of class
Melanie you looking awesome in RED shirt with pockets.........Really smart and gorgeous First Lady
Happy that he can go golfing.
Obama didn't allow Jesus to send bad hurricanes to the United States when he was president.  Trump can't even make deals with his lard and slavior, Jesus fucking Christ.
the coast guard is a brand?
So nice to have a first lady that has nice ass, follows her husband and just shut up
For a moment I thought Melania Trump was going to ask: Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie???
Quit with the great shit...he don't know words ...What a dope.
hurricane trump is a bad path to be in.....fake response to fake storm. fake news, fake president, climate change is fake.
nothing like a good shower for these american pigs to clean up their racism. hope many of you die bastards.
Why did Trump have to create this hurricane?  He is so hateful...
LMAO!!!   Geeeeez!!  This Clown ALWAYS opens his mouth and says absolutely nothing!!!!  Yuh... we're coordinated.  The Coast Guard is incredible.  We're having meetings.  People should get out of its way   WHAT AN IDIOT!!!!   Specifically what coordination is being done?  Specifically where can victims go for help and specifically what is available to them?  Specifically what messages does FEMA have for the residents?   This total joke of a president is the most clueless person who has ever walked the face of the earth!!!!!
We're worried about lives not money - then walks away like a BOSS!
Reporters stupid question  : HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST  ?  Trumps perfect answer : We are not worried about money but about lives !\n\n\n\nstupid questions needs my stupid answer as well : Yeah it is gonna cost a lot of billions , let's sit down now and discuss the numbers please, thank you for asking. Let me kick your fucking ass first , \nYOU ARE FIRED you stupid fuck
Coast guardsmen along with lawenforement are taking weapons from house to house at gun point. Should remind everyone that the United States Corporation  is just that, a psychopathic, parasitic Dead Entity Corporation that is commiting War Crimes against Men and Women suffering the effects of these storms. \n\nCriminal as it gets. Fired!!!
It's not just trump\n\nThe Republican Party is a Weapon of Mass Destruction\n\nhttp://washingtonmonthly.com/2017/07/29/the-republican-party-is-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/
President Trump, why are you exaggerating about the storm.  I trusted you to be honest.  Please tell the truth about this 9-11 storm
Bingo Trump (as he is known by other diplomats in Europe)  has freakishly tiny hands.
Wow, this comment section is filled with anti-trump bots.
GOD BLESS  all in the path of the Hurricane!!!
Bush - as un-statesman like as he was, relatively speaking, at least made an effort to be empathetic, clumsily so. This orange jerk thinks empathy is a building where foreign diplomats live - oh shit; get it? That just came to me while doing my daily dose of bashing The Idiot Trump. Pretty good, huh? Empathy/Embassy.....I humbly crack myself up sometimes - but it's a discrete, quick-witted humor...don't y'all think... blah blah blah...lol.
What i find discusting is that while people have no power shelter or food due to hirricanes the markets reaction is to scream higher! Proof that human life has no bearing on profit. Do people in miami really want the dow hitting new highes or do they need help.
Did I hear DACA?, the liberals are back! Send them to the path of IRMA😄👍
LOVE MY PRESIDENT AND FLOTUS!! PRAYING FOR THEM EVERYDAY!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸👏🏾👏🏾
Melania is so hot! He could be golfing and enjoying life on a yacht with helicopters and college girls in bikinis but he chose to work for us, the American people for free.  We have not been this lucky since 1776 when the billionaires of the day decided to give up personal pursuits, putting their lives at risk, for us the american people.
Lying racist Trump uses the vocabulary of a 5th grader. This unpresidential orange man never seems to have the slightest clue what he is talking about. Trump is a con man, a total FRAUD, he takes credit for Obamas achievements and distorts the facts or completely lies about a lot of topics. He is unstable and unfit to lead this country. Trump harms the USA and should be impeached immediately. WORST PRESIDENT EVER.
0:55\nto mar a lago, to pocket even more taxpayer dollars
That's my President 😉👍  and look at his fine looking wife too!!!😉👍
We are with you Mr Trump
Good job Trump. Now build the damn wall.
MSM & Hollywood hates him but (at least half) the American people love him. I find that so fascinating to watch that dynamic every day. I'm not American so I don't have a horse in this race but for about 2 years now its been riveting. Thank you USA for proving that reality is more interesting than fiction. But, unlike fiction, it doesn't have to make sense.
We're worried about Life's not cost See this is a real president Donald J trump God Bless him and his family .Our 1st lady is beautiful as always God-bless her to And the people of Florida
Fuck donald Trump
Trump 2020
Those pockets look like tiits
What an idiot.
good video
Cobrarme vergaze.
Call it Imer again dumb fuck
Like a boss\nTrump 2020
greatest president ever!
Hi Melania..love your outfit!! God Bless..
NICE SHADES MELANIA IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL FLOTUS
Trumps the best!
Trump!!!  2017  From Canada!!!
what a f***ing moron
First lady looks unusually fine!!
Trump is a goat abortion of a human being. What a turd
Haha Melania doesin't want to even speak to the media. But I mean look at the way they treat her! Good job!
Trump supporters are the least educated people I've ever encountered. You believe in every conspiracy theory you've ever read but yet you refuse to acknowledge facts
Americans whinge a lot. You have a great President.
North Korean video shows death notice of US President Donald Trump\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMvToVx1gNE
I'm afraid liberals are going to  get their wish. Trump already looks bad. That is an indication he cares about the people of this country. If you have a conscience, and you are the President of The United States, and you care about the people of this country, when you leave office, you will have visible signs of aging all over your face. Trump is already there. Slick Willie and Barack Hussein Hitler Anti-Christ Obumma didn't seem to have been bothered by a conscience at all.
Melania   is  kreativeti & beauty🌷
Trump is amazing!  The Democratic party is crumbling.
Trump just makes shit up on the spot. Hilarious
I'm printing out this page of comments to take to my English class; the teacher is going to have such a laugh at this bunch of grammar fuck-wits.
Trump looks bit like Boris Johnson!
Beautiful speech by a genuine man. Tears are in my eyes. God, I love this country.
What an amazing speech!  What amazing people on flight 93 that day!  They saved so many lives by being brave, and courageous.  I love Vice President Mike Pence.  He shows our country, and all Americans honor, and love for our country.  I'm glad he was spared that day.  Who knows maybe after 2 terms of President Donald J. Trump, he might become our next president.  I sure do hope so!  Thank God for all of the hero's that day on 9/11.  They made all Americans proud to be Americans.  Thank you, Vice President Mike Pence!
WHAT A GREAT MAN OF GOD MIKE PENCE IS...WHAT A MOVING TRIBUTE FROM A MAN WHO LOVES THE LORD
Thank You Mr Vice President!!!!!!!!!! You are the best Vice President Ever. I'm thankful for you and President Trump. God Bless you both and God Bless America
Very moving speech from this administration-finally. Good man. Those aboard Had The Right Stuff. God Bless Them All.
God Bless!
They prayed the Lord's prayer .. HALLELUJAH !!!
Best speech ever by our amazing Vice President Mike Pence!!
As a Pennsylvania resident I have visited the sacred ground at Shanksville several times on the anniversary of 9/11. My last visit was with my father six years ago. I think I will always regret that I wasn't there again today to have had the privilege to have personally experienced such a heartfelt speech... so beautifully delivered. Thank you Mr Vice President!
He will be President one day!
Innocent blood cries to Almighty God Yahweh, and He always answers. We will defeat the camouflaged evil no matter which name is applied.
Wonder speech by our Vice President!!
One of the most riveting and heartfelt speeches I've ever herd.  Thank you God for such a great man on earth to lead us.
Thank you sir
I love this guy.
Almighty God knew the future of this country and His plans for you  (Jeremiah 29:11)  that you would become this countries 45th    Vice President of the United States even 16 years into the future the Lord has and will continue to protect you and your family (Psalms 91)Thank God you are our Vice President Mike Pence!!!\nREPLY
Beautiful speech.
God saved the life of Mike Pence 16 years ago because He was preparing him for the Vice Presidency.
Wow! Previous administration didn't seem to care about 911 victims. MAGA
I admire such a great man! I too hope he has a chance at Presidency some day
Trump/Pence 2020  🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Great, heartfelt speech
Beautiful
THANKYOU VP Pence. My dad and granddad came from Pennsylvania. Bless you for sharing the heartfelt tribute to the brave men and women who sacrificed to save people in Washington DC.
dislike = islam = teroris
Those passangers were more braver than well ever be.
I'm sorry guys but This dude's a complete whacko. You know why he's The vice president? Because this guy is a complete head case, people will be less likely to wanna impeach Trump.
mike is such a compassionate and caring man. the usa is blessed that they have him as vicepresident..\nhe is alsoloyal and true. i love you, mike
my boys will NEVER serve in the military because our military boys are being sent to slaughter for financial gain for politicians and evil doers. Its unfortunate that our military isn't being used for what it is intended. God Bless our military that sacrifice their lives for what they believe in.....we live in a sad world....
At 6:28 , whose the disrespectful person looking at his phone?
He sure is more eloquent than the Pres!
If he is so great,why does he not DEMAND a NEW INVESTIGATION? He is a puppet just like the rest of them...
He spoke that speech from the bottom of his heart. Beautiful said. I can't stop crying.
I challenge  all of you, dare you to access this link and see what the truth is: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Pence+is+a+Pedophile and this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LakXx6A72g   This whistle blower is now dead, another hero destroyed:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl3Q2vKiOzE  The is shyt it real, it could happened to you or I and it is a bi-partisan evil, Evidence pence is a pedophile and possible child murderer and flint knows it and has a list. pence latest: a striver for an academy award,  apparently...  > : (   pure evil
He was shook up on that day, September 11, 2001.  We all were.  \nWe remember\nHe remembers\nWe all remember.\nMay they all rest in peace. \nAnd may we all live in peace.  \nAnd may America Bless God, again!
Pence, the biggest lying hypocrite of our times. This man is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The two of them are the biggest con artists we will ever see.... wake up you idiots who drank the kool-aid.....

where was the plane, just a hole in the ground.
That is one of the greatest speeches I've ever heard in my life. Very moving.
with respect , sir, yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me is from the 23rd Psalm, not the Lord's Prayer.   Great speech otherwise. May we never forget or discredit the events of  9/11.
This is leadership unlike the terrorist lover Obama and his evil team. America we must not allow the Demoncrats to have the keys to this nation again, if we do this country will be ran by terrorist supporters, look who now march with the Demoncrats groups Muslim terroist using racist against Americans to force us to back up and allow them to take control. The demons on the left has many things in common with the terrorist. Hate for America and it's values.
i love Mike Pence, he should be our President today!
What a beautiful tribute from Vice President Pence. God bless him and God bless President Donald Trump.
MIKE PENCE IS A SATAN WORSHIPPING FAGGOT PEDOPHILE. MIKE PENCE YOU WILL BURN.
Pence is such a stately and stoic historical figure. Should something unforeseen and bad happen to Trump (God forbid), he might be an awesome President for America. He is the quiet yet strong support behind Trump Americans don't always appreciate enough. Blessings to a great country, prayers to the families of all 9/11 heroes.
Pence is just unbelievable when he speaks, he has no presence or character, just like Trump.  If he is so upset about all those who died in 9/11 perhaps he should seek out the truth about exactly what really occurred that day and bring those involved to face justice.  No plane hit the Pentagon and nothing but explosives brought down the other Tower at ground zero (Building 6  I believe), evidence of thermite in the rubble and pouring out the towers before collapse.  Its all a big conspiracy to justify global war for those who would benefit from it.  Justice will never be found for this until there is a President who firmly believes in bringing everyone to account regardless of whom they may be, Rich or Famous.   Until then, every year will result in this nonsense.  The only thing it does is provide a time for reflection for those who were lost, these are the innocent pawns in the USA elite agenda.
what a liar -  no airplane crashed at  Shanksville, pa   0n 9/11/2001  -  the coroner who was  called to the scene that\nday said he found no  body parts,no blood,  no  airplane parts  -  just scrap metal that had been dumped into the hole that was\nalready  in the ground before 9/11/2001 -  because no airplane had crashed at that site  (later this coroner was threatened\nand initimidated into  silence)  -  the US   government is still lying to American citizens  about what happened on 9/11 - it\nwas an inside job by the US  government who murdered 3000 innocent Americans --  and the  families of the victims\nhave no answers and no justice.
WOW THE LYING CREEP PENCE CAN READ A TELEPROMPTER, HE  IS A MINDLESS DRONE, THE PERFECT PUPPET FOR THE CONSERVATIVES
Good speech. One small thing - though I walk through the shadow of death is Psalms 22, not the Lord's prayer. God bless the heros of flight 93 and their families.
Bless them all why to go vies president pence
yes I agree  he is good but still I wonder if we will ever be able to know the through about what happened   many still doubt .Bush was lying, ,I just don't know  god bless all who lost the lives and the families whos lost the loved once
Pence is a tool and 9-11 was an inside job. The dude is a liar and somebody's bitch.
let them go let them go thats what they did..and you didnt care!  http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/23/inv.investigation.terrorism/    A knowledgeable source said two small knives were found on a Delta flight that was supposed to depart Boston, and a box cutter was found on an Atlanta-to-Brussels Delta flight. These planes didn't take off since all flights were grounded after the hijackings. The tools were found when the planes were searched.\n\nInvestigators say they aren't sure whether the tools found were intended for some sort of innocent use or whether their owners may have had malicious intent. But they say the two planes' passenger manifests have been checked. And investigators increasingly believe that the weapons may have been prepositioned by accomplices for use by others. As one U.S. official told Time magazine, These look like inside jobs.    Following their deportation, both men were charged in India with passport violations.[9] According to the Times of India, the men were accused of obtaining fake passports from a corrupt passport agent, and Khan's true name was Gul Mohammed Shah, and Azmath had listed his age as 50 rather than 30. The Times reported that Azmath's wife, Tasleem Murad, had told them that he was not the first person to misstate his age to obtain a visa and He did not have any evil intentions and he has paid for it already.[10] An additional issue was that Azmath's wife, being Pakistani, did not have Indian citizenship.[9]\nThe 2002 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting[11] was awarded to a September 29 article in the Washington Post by Dan Eggen and Bob Woodward, which mentioned the detention of Khan and Azmath and reported that an anonymous source said that Both men had flight training.[12]\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_of_Ayub_Ali_Khan_and_Mohammed_Jaweed_Azmath
His speech truly from the Heart
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck0sF5wnH4Q\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32qB7On8ngM\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdlEcFfYZ2\nJesse Ventura claims gov’t involved in 9/11   Mar. 8, 2010 at 1:36 PM TODAY books\nIn his new book, “American Conspiracies: Lies, Lies, and More Dirty Lies That the Government Tells Us,” former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura begins an investigative journey to prove that there is more to our national history than the government wants us to know. In this excerpt, he writes about an alleged 9/11 cover-up.Chapter 12: What really happened on September 11?The incident: On September 11, 2001, four airplanes were hijacked on American soil and crashed into the Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania.  official word: The 19 hijackers were all fanatic Muslim terrorists linked to al-Qaeda and its ringleader, Osama bin Laden. My take: Our government engaged in a massive cover-up of what really happened, including its own ties to the hijackers. Unanswered questions remain about how the towers were brought down, and whether a plane really struck the Pentagon. The Bush Administration either knew about the plan and allowed it to proceed, or they had a hand in it themselves.I was in my third year as Minnesota’s governor on September 11, 2001. After the devastation of the Pentagon being hit and the Twin Towers falling, I put the National Guard on alert and secured some of our public buildings. The following Sunday morning, we were the first state to hold a memorial for the nearly 3,000 victims. More than 40,000 people showed up on the front lawn of the State Capitol, while a steady rain fell. I’ll never forget Native American shamans beating drums alongside honor guards who represented the police and firefighters and military. It still chokes me up to think about it. Looking out on hundreds of flags fluttering in the breeze, I remember saying at the end of two hours: “We will promote good against evil. And finally, we will together restore our sense of freedom by conquering this enemy!”I never wanted to believe anything different than what our government told us about that tragic day. But here is what John Farmer, a Senior Counsel for the 9/11 Commission who drafted the original report, has to say in a new book: “At some level of the government, at some point in time ... there was an agreement not to tell the truth about what happened.”What more do we need? Are we willing to live with another lie to go with the Warren Report, the Iran-Contra cover-up, and many other “official” stories?
I was a 911 baby, joined the Marines that December and spent 13 weeks on a Paris Island. What brought down WTCbuilding 7? Was it TNT? Was it all a lie, is Trump going to get to the bottom of this?
this is a great speech by Mike Pence about Flight 93 ... now as go back and visit what happened that day, I have one question.... where's the plane?
Same bullshit brought to you by the next set of liars, If you think 911 was done by 19 Muslim High Jackers\nYou still believe you live on a Pear Shaped Oblate Spheroid Spinning in Space as your leading astrophysicist \nNeil Disgraced Tyson describes it. 911 was done by the same evil group that defends this 500 year deception \nJudaism & Freemasonry. #Globexit.  Peace on the Plane to all Sentient Beings coming to your neighborhood soon
this whole phone call story is BS. Never happened. No plane, no crash.  The supposed phone call was still going on after the plane supposedly crashed. The timeline of the calls is the proof of this story being untrue. I think Pence just does not know.
Lies. more LIES, more and more LIES,  still more stinking LIES and DECEPTION, then more and more stinking and rotting LIES, then more fake emotion to spew more fetid LIES.  WHAT A DISGRACE!!!!
A beautiful homage to our heroes by a beautiful man.
What a great speech for true heroes god bless them and their families
CANADIANS STAND UNITED WITH AMERICA. ....
BULLSHIT, There were no planes on 9/11, more fake news!
Bless the people that lost someone that day..  The masterminds behind this terrible act of domestic terrorism need to be brought to justice, the Saudi guys were just scapegoats to take the blame..
Wow!  It was a very awesome, loving tribute to the fallen men and women (and even an unborn baby) who were on the flight that was headed to destroy the Capitol.  It moved my heart very deeply with renewed grief of what happened on that fateful day.  God bless you, VP Pence!
Working and listen to the radio on my earphones.That was the worse day.I was in shock and so was everybody I seen.RIP.😢#Heros#GodBlessAmerica#Alwaysremember#PittsburghPA.
Mike deus volt pence, mike fry away your inner gay pence, mike electroshock your love of cock pence, mike homocaust pence, mike Like it in the crapper? You get the zapper pence, mike feel the itch? Flip the switch pence, mike curing queers with amperes pence, mike ignite the sodomite pence\n\nWho knows more nicknames?
What about the plane that hit building #7?
Nice speech but evidence strongly suggests that the flight 93 story as told to the American people is a myth, but hey it plays to the official narrative.  VP Pence seems to say all the  things  Americans love to hear, but I don't trust him, and wont, until and unless he gets real with us about who was really behind  9-11.   I'm no lover of Islam but 19 Muslim terrorists with box cutters did not do 9-11.  Interestingly the vice president refers to the LORD's prayer but quotes the 23rd Psalm.  Perhaps not the Bible scholar he's reported to be.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N-ktM9rGFY
All I can say is thank you for this moment.
Thank you for posting this video. \n\nThe speech was moving.
Yes we are in a war of good and evil and it has to be won in the heavenlies 1st
use dont honor nobody use murdering bastards . 9/11 inside job...wankers
Kid Rock for senate 2018, kidrockforsenate.com
FLIGHT 93. LET'S ROLL....
beautiful speech President Pence!!!!!!!!!!!!
PENCE FOR PREZ!!! NO DOUBT
I personally do not like trump or pence however this speech is truly inspiring and amazing
9/11 was an inside job
Got to love this man. Thank you Vice President Pence. TRUMP PENCE 2020 2024 2028 2032 USA USA USA
wake up dear american fellows, he is lying and sure he knows it. the usa system destroys us all.
When will all citizens realize we live in the most free country in the world why don't we cherish and be humbled by the millions that died knowing it to the point of dying fighting for it.\nWake up before it is to late. PLEASE
I wish he was President instead of Trump.
Israel and US agents wired WTC with thermite/explosives.  Planes were allowed to hit those buildings and then those explosives were detonated.\n\nA cruise missile bit the Pentagon.  The missile was shrouded as a small version of a passenger plane.  This plane was remotely flown into the Pentagon.  This explains why the debris field didn't exist at the Pentagon.  Also the reason why the damage to the Pentagon was so small compared to the WTC. Even though the same type of plane supposedly hit the 3 buildings.  \n\nFlight 93 was shot down by military aircraft. \n\nWTC 7 was wired to be brought down.  7 held tons of info on this plan (money, who's involved, etc.)  All evidence was in 7.
i will sell you some snake oil if you believe that lying son of a b nothing but a liar. I hope he go and sat his lying ass down somewhere, yes they were heroes not you.
Pence is a political hack, God help us from politicians like him.
I have been to Shanksville right after it happened, during construction and after. It's enormous. It's very beautiful, and again, just massive. After time passed, you cannot see where it happened, so there is a giant boulder to represent the area. A beautiful wooden gate on the pathway. It's very surreal. There is a loooong road to get in, one would think you were in a highway, lost. The tower of voices sounds amazing!! It will one of the most incredible monuments once finished. Feds took thousands of acres for it. Pence gave a beautiful, respectful, strong, patriotic and sincere speech. 9/11 still feels like yesterday, and I believe it always will. Thank you Mr. Pence.
Mike Pence is such an honorable man.  Wow.  He brought me to tears with is speech.   PRAISE GOD HE IS OUR VP!!!
This is a good, kind and humble man; a true leader and demanding of respect.  This speech moved me deeply. Thank you Mr. Vice President.
Pissy Pants Pence crying crocodile tears repeating the tired old lies he calls a triumph of freedom to begin the neo-con endless wars that accomplish nothing good only murder and endless bloodshed, what good has come from any of these wars only death, destruction, destroyed nations, long lines of crazed killers invading the West. Pissy Pants sounds like he's just loving his boo hoo hoo propaganda crap for the idiocracy idiots in America hooray hooray more wars, more death, power to the corporate globalists death to me, and my family destruction to all I hold dear.
A plane crashed in Shanksville? Can we see? Donald Rumsfeld said it himself, a plane was shot down. America, WAKE UP
9-11 was an inside job and people of all walks are waking up to these lies!!!!! Will pray for all the innocent lives killed for greed and corruption!!!!!!     We are in new times, let's not forget  the government's deep states evil ways, but support our President and Vice President and hope they make better and more honest decisions to protect their own people!!!!!!
R U a shill Rshill7?
Can you handle the truth? \nGoogle: America: Freedom to Fascism ( Note where Rockefeller says, On 9/11, there is going to be an event.)\nGoogle: Ex CIA Agent Risks All to Expose the Deep State - Kevin Shipp
Never forget 911 ; On 911 Israel Killed 3000 Americans
Great speech, still doesn't change my opinion about them.
These are for me manmade hurricanes as a result of the extreme climate warming. And President Trump even stopped to protect the climate. Trump makes America poor again. It is a horrible manmade worst scenario. (I have studied climatology at one of the best universities of Europe)
Thank you for calling the Hurricane tech support my name is John Smith,  how may i help you today 
Am I late?
So it's coming back to Florida
Yhdjrg
Fake news just sat it out on my back porch north Tampa lots of wind some rain maybe a category 1
JESUS LOVES YOU.  HE is the ONLY and LIVING GOD. He Wants to help you. He is your Savior. If you are tired of everything, pray to Him. He will hear and answer you. HE IS YOUR FATHER....
9/11 it's a cursed day.

Just what Florida/Tampa needs. Hope everyone finds a safe place to stay while Irma passes.
the reason they hype this up is so the people in Florida would take it serious and evacuate if needed. Better safe than sorry
The worst hurricane in history, who supports UP ➡ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvxaPViT1AY
Category 3 horrible right......Look at him no rain coat short sleeves no water on him anywhere....
It's so wired to wear two watches
What if the storm is alive and knows where to go.
Im not trying to make fun of the victims of the hurricane but i just reallllllyyyy wanted him to say good afternoon al roker here and i am here to tell you that the sharknado storm is goin into a category 4
Did you see the cover pic? It was Hurricane Irma Fetus.
Someone tell me why this boy has two watches
A hurricane has never hit the mainland of the US and then proceeded to get stronger. They're blowing this whole thing out of proportion, nothing to totally freak out about
Dose anyone know if it will hit Atlanta?
It's not slowing down because it hit Cuba. Our desk fans are actually blowing the hurricane with enough force to push it :)
why is this considered my hw if i live in ny.....
And I'm dying cuz of how hot it is here in Arizona..
Why are y'all depending on me and my son? I can't stop these hurricanes because it's the act of mother nature, not me. I don't control the weather, the weather controls itself.
i just hope nobody passes away, animals and people, otherwise i don't care it all about this ;)

@BenMC -  This is bull crap - Maybe in the islands but not in Florida. My kid is in Naples getting hit hard right this minute but no deaths have been reported except before the storm in the US he fell off a ladder... So where did all these people die at and did they drown or get hurt. I don't want to see your video because it is a bunch of lies if you claim that 1,000's of people died in Florida - THAT IS A LIE - TOTAL LIE - 1000's are not dead!

Yo sólo recuerdo que cuando Ney llegó no era la gran estrella, botaba los balones y luego lo fueron puliendo. espero que Dembelé tenga mucho éxito en el barça
Creo que cuando tenga la edad de Neymar va a ser mas que el

Soy del Madrid pero sinceramente habéis hecho un gran fichaje. Aunque el precio esta muy desorbitado, pero tengo la sensación de que tenéis jugador para muchos años (hasta que venga el PSG con el money XD)
Apuesto lo que les de suuu puta regalada gana que no miraron la MADRE oh Monja...ni los del dia despues
Neymar le an comido la cabeza el jeque y su padre con los millones y el balon de oro.. pero cuando se de cuenta que solo se acuerdan de el 4 o 5  partidos en Europa  despertara y vera el grave error que ha cometido y en ese momento ya no sera nadie.. ronaldiño 2 ..
Yo soy el auténtico Juan García :)
Que le valla muy bien por el bien del fútbol 💪🏻
Estadio lleno lo impresiona? Jajaja el viene del BVB  respeten! La hinchada del BVB siempre va a estar por encima de todas!

Neymar tenia esa calidad que tal y cual ... pero este xaval puede dar algoal barca que no tenia y es volver a hacer contras dolorosas
Apunta maneras este chaval, nos va a dar mas de un disgusto a los madridistas jaja
estoy feliz por el, lo sigo desde el borussia y es un gran jugador, habilidoso con las 2 piernas.
0:10 la primera vez que veo a dembele sonreir
Valverde habla mejor ingles que Gerrard jajaja
Ilusiona bastante este tio, y con solo 20 años... Se esperan grandes cosas de el.
El día que se vaya la luz cuando estén en el hotel se le va a ver solo los dientes xd
Parece majillo el chaval, y humilde. A ver si no sale muy cani, aunque siendo negro complicado no serlo.
Nigga rules
*Dempelé!*
por favor Qué ha dicho valverde a dembele en el minuto 1:22 ?
Mandriles Esta temporada se la van a chupar a dembele Ya veran.
Suarez porque no abraza a Evra asi?
I love the idea that he has been having all of these adventures.. with his shoes untied.
You're starting to grow man. Been here since Dolan Dark memed your swimming video.
I think it would be amazing if the duct taped shoes remained in continuity that way for the entirety of the rest of the videos.
HowToBasic meets AlanTutorial
I am VERY ANGRY. This channel PISSES ME OFF!!\n\n\nWhy the hell doesn't this guy have more subscribers?! Seriously! This shit is amazing!
IDEA: ironing my clothes, shirt, trousesrs etc.
You idiot you dropped your plant
Same problem solving skills as Donald Duck in the old Disney cartoons. I love it!
The grunts this guy makes though
Added you guys to our sub box. Content is too good not to support. Cheers fam.
Best ad 2017 by far. Not even mad.
That's one way to input an ad without pissing people off
Awwww it was good but it was to short
This was nothing short of amazing.
My roommate walked in on me duct taping my shoes today, it was very awkward...
i liked your other videos but not this one
I love how you take the most mundane things and turn them into something fun.
You're like the guy from the infomercials who fails the easiest tasks: Are you tired of struggling with <easy thing>?. Great videos dude.
Not sure if you've heard of it, but there's this video site called YouTube, where you can probably look up how to tie your shoes. It'll\nshow you step by step. Get it? Step? Shoes? I'll go home.
best integration on an add I've seen on YouTube thus far
I hope you do more something goes wrong soon instead of you getting really weird with how you do X, I miss mishaps like when you tried learning to swim or played with a frisbee
This was the best integration of a SquareSpace sponsored video ever!!!!!
I watch you since your first video on your channel - since you had no more than 10 subs - I hope I can be with your journey for a longer time and see how your channel grows :3
I was expecting the shoes to explode or something, but alright he nailed it.
He caught the run-away plant!
This is the first person view of Mr. Bean.
You are the GOD of crazy
this channel is Similar to how to basic channel but way better and less Disgusting
He really dedicates a lot of time/money for these videos. Bought a plant and broke it immediately in his house and had to clean it up. Then he completely ruined 2 pairs of shoes and wasted tape. (I mean wasting tape isn't that serious but still) Definitely a great channel and I'm glad that I found you. Keep up the great work! :)
He's overrated. Don't deny this- you know it's true.
This is probably the happiest ending I've seen in one of his videos so far.
I have a strong hung this guy's April Fools video will be Making Scrambled Eggs and will be a completely normal video of him making eggs.
016 everyone did that at one point
He made ads entertaining...\n\nLet me repeat that\n\n\n\n*HE MADE ADS ENTERTAINING*
I like The Effort Keep up the Videos man
I knew it. I absolutely knew tying his shoes would become a subject at one point. Just surprised he didn't injure himself worse yet.
Wait, hold on. Are those Air Force 1s? I didn't know they still made those. I wore them in the 5th grade. Damn.
Did you try turning your shoes on and off first?
You can't tie a shoe but you can tie the string to the needle lol
Was expecting a dark twist...
I love how the website at the end looks like something from 15 years ago. I guess it's a shity website maker.
I found this one a bit lacking, There aren't any effects.
That's the most elegant ad that I've ever seen.
Make a short about traveling back in time, but constantly going to the wrong dates, like around dinosaurs and such.
Making a Face reveal video, but you can't turn around the gopro or camera. (Lenny)
You clearly have internet access because we see you using Squarespace, so why don't you just Google it?
Stop sounding like how to basics....good content...could be more original grunting!? :/
I like that you are willing to make such a mess in your house for the sake of your videos.
Or, you could just not wear your shoes indoors haha
I love your channel!!!!! 😀😀👍🏻
Keep on dude, I f* love your stuff, and clever way to add the advertisement ;D \nLike it <3
I love that you put content into the sponsor too!
No, no, man. You're doing it all wrong.\n\nYou do a loop-de-loop and pull, then your shoes are lookin' cool!
I expected him to go for a walk after putting duct tape on his legs, and walk into a building with a no shoes sign!😂
We need more creative and original creators like you. Wish you were more well known 😊
HA YOU CANT TIE YOUR SHOES THAT MEANS YOU'RE STUPID HA HA
For those who don't know, the website at the end is real. It's whatishappeningtome.com .
Idk whats more impressive, the fact he cant tie shoes, or the knots he makes when he messed up
While still good, I think episodes are getting more lame on the way. If you have to take more time for original ideas, please do. Twice a month is fine as well. Good luck on your endeavors :)
Wait. He couldn't just slip on the already-tied green shoes? xD
I legit thought of you making a video on this topic on Thursday XD

dude this guy is my favorite youtuber
I'm sorry for saying this, but the obvious sponsor plugs are too much in this one. I love your work, and you do a great job, but just because you have a sponsor doesn't mean you have to compromise your idea... I have told a lot of people about your videos, and hope you get the recognition you deserve, but if this is the route that it is going I feel like I've also let a lot of folks down. Just saying, obviously.
Didn't actually expect whatishappeningtome.com to be real, it is.
A while back I saw this on creators on the rise, I watched one video and couldn't stop. This is great channel. If you dont reach 100k or even a million, its just because people don't know about ur channel. Imma spread your channel around YouTube. I hope you have a great day :D
Im a 23 year old human male, yet I still dont know how to tie my shoes. (While I did learned how to, after a year after graduating High School I pretty much forgot how to)
Your videos are amazing, but too infrequent to become popular. Start a 4/5 days a week schedule and you'll be golden.
this video was nearly 50% ad, do not go down that road please
fuck squarespace
I love how in the song she says us as if Kirstie's with us in these situations 😊☺️😌
The like, last two scenes with the final text and the empty swing really hurt me for some reason
This is amazing and I'm absolutely astonished!\nAmazing voice, deep message, it can't get anymore impressive.
I like how it showed a man being abused by a woman. It shows men can be hurt too, and not just women.
SHE IS SO UNDERRATED. I CAN'T
_i cried until the end of the video. I cry at how she's a queen. I cry at how she's a goddess. I cry at how beautiful she sounds when she sings. I cry at everything she does amazingly--_
Kirstin is a real life goddess
SHE IS SO GORGEOUS OMG CAN I BE HER
Now we need a mv for Something Real pleeeaaase
this song reminds me of the pain, the insults, and the racial slurs i've overcome for the past five years
[Verse 1]\nI see my name has been in your mouth\nWell, spit it out\nAnd in a conversation, don't you wanna say\nWhat you think about it?\nI love when I hear something new about me\nOoh, I never knew about me, like they do\nI wonder if another storm is gonna wash me out\nBut now I'm drowning in the news, in the news\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, they're so cold\nAnd they don't need a cause\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nOh, I can't fit their mold\nNo, we can't take on that walk\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nWe are not at all\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou're another disaster, just another one spinning out\nIsn't that some shit?\nAnd isn't it convenient, whenever you wanna say something\nThey wanna listen now\nBut won't ever repeat or ever tell how they found out?\n[Chorus]\nYeah, they're so cold\nAnd they don't need a cause\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nOh, I can't fit their mold\nNo, we can't take on that walk\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nWe are or not at all, are or not at all, are or not at all\n\n[Verse 3]\nKnow that I'd be lying\nIf I said it didn't get to me\nThe way they keep me victim of their rudimentary convo\nOh, they talk so much\nAnd I wish I could run away but maybe there's no escaping\nAll their silver tongues\nShoot the shit, tie the noose, hang the noose\nMake sure I don't tell no one\n\n[Chorus]\nYeah, they're so cold\nAnd they don't need a cause\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nOh, it's all my business\nThere's nothing we control\n'Cause they'll talk about us\nLike we're bad weather\nWe are or not at all, are or not at all, are or not at all, oh\nWe are or not, we are, we are or not at all
This video is so relatable and beautiful. I love it! Kirstin has grown so independent and has sprouted into a strong fabulous flower. I nearly cried while watching this.
love the song, love Kirstin Maldonado & love the beat and the lyrics.. well done girlfriend once again you nailed it. love the message in this song this did make me cry though cause I can relate and others too getting called names and such things like that. We don't deserve it at all and that's the truth but Kirstin wow you did so good and I am proud of you girly so proud of you and how far you had came. Your slaying girl
I can relate to this video so much 😭😭😭😭 I'm getting bullied rn, both cyber & physical 😭
its humanly impossible to be as amazing as kirstin is.
Now I want the fine brothers to do a lyrics breakdown video of this, I'd love that

What happened at 3:25 ?
what is that weird instrument in the background? It sounds like a machine gun.
okAY QUEEN?! COME THE FUCK THROUGH?!
Want to cry now. Thank you. It's lovely.
Really surprised her PR team didn't advise her to wait at least a week or so to release this...a song called bad weather with lyrics of being washed away by a flood right after two record-setting hurricanes? That's...pretty tacky.
This is amazing but I gotta say I don't get why she's on a swing. There's gotta be a deeper meaning that I'm just not getting there.
OMG I loved that so much incredible job :)
Kirstin has the voice of an angel!!
Shes SOO beautiful...........I love her and her music SOOO much
wowwwwww an actual work of art
I love this song and now im in love with the video plus she is so cute/sexy
kirstIN NEEDS TO MAKE A YOUTUBE CHANNEL HOLY CRAP
You make me feel so happy,you inspire me,and if you ever doubt yourself don't you are perfect in every way and if you see a flaw all I see is flawlessness
Yass Queen Love you Kirstie that was dramatic  I love how you focused on real issues suicide bullying etc This was amazing can't wait to see what's next
I'm personally not a huge fan of Kirstie's solo stuff, but this video is GORGEOUS and the lyrics are really beautiful / important. Ily Kirstie, keep slaying, queeeen <3
Holy hell, my girl in dat dress. I forgot she was ever in a group, slayin the game all by herself. Gorgeous!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is beautiful i got chills at the end
YO HER VOCALIZATIONS IN THIS THOUGH. And these lyrics man. This is so good. I feel blessd
the world has to see this.
Wow SHE DID THAT
Fckkkk mannnn! All her videos make me want to always rub one out! Damn she is super sexy! Those boobs tho! 😍😘🌹
OMG! I can't deal. This is so empowering, this whole music video breathed life to the message of anti-bullying and standing up for yourself, and it really tugged at my heartstrings, so... Thank you so much for being an inspiration to all of us, Kirstin! This is phenomenal.
Love me from Iraqi
How can someone call kirstie a slut when she's that flawless (yes I know it's for the video)
The empty swing at the end sends a really powerful message, please watch what you say, others people words do not define you, you define yourself !!
This song has such a powerful message!!! Amazing!!!
I FUCKING LOVE IT !
Waited all day just to see this video and it was honestly so powerful and worth the wait ❤️
This song brought me to tears! Absolutely love it and the message behind it!

I'm sobbing lmao
I'm OBSESSED
Omfg
This is amazing 😖
Damn bae this fire 🔥🔥
The music is too loud and you can't actually understand half of what she's singing... :( Bring back the crisper clearer Kirstin. Beautiful video though!
I'm crying cause she's so pretty but her music video shattered my heart cause I've been there before and trust it's hard but if no one loves you, the only person that loves you is yourself.
is she some sort of pop star?
I was wondering how good your solo music would be... this is so meaningful <3
I really like this song - by far her best solo song IMO - but I don't like how she acts as 'kirstin'. Before with PTX she was cute and fun and smiling, now she seems like a pouting, wannabe sex kitten. Her other songs were way overproduced too and the TM thing strikes me as hella pretentious.  (Not hating, I'm a big PTX fan and always liked K and still appreciate her talent as a vocalist.  I'm just sad about how she's changed.)
Oh wow...this is intense.
Your videos are always entertaining and educational. Good work dude.
I dont remember a single thing he said
I feel like lottery winners go broke quick unless they are smart about it
I haven't watched him in years but the first thing I noticed is that he grew his beard out... that out of everything else
Uh oh Keem star beard is building\n\n\n\n\nMay God save us from the keemledge whale
Come back to channel after ages, beard is looking ThICC man <3
I love your videos, but I do have a correction for this one (just because I know you love these facts and I'm sure you pride yourself on getting as much information as you can).\nThe Inca were not around 6000 years ago (they existed from about the 13th century until they were conquered in 1572); their ancestors (of which there were many tribes ethnically and culturally different than the Inca) would have first domesticated alpaca
I can't wait until number 100! Your the best
You butchered the word Thames lol good video though.
As always you make me laugh . Your videos are so entertaining, the information as well as your charisma and your playfull way to do it. Thanks again Matthew.
if your life revolves around your job, you need a real life\nhand soap is a waste of time and money
Bonus Fact: The has now told 4,400 facts!
Great Video!!!But that's nothing new
I started watching this channel when there were only 19 50 amazing facts.
Just realized why I zone out on all these facts videos. That back ground music is distracting.
Hey Man , you're such a genuine and legit guy and you're my inspiration, thanks for making such awesome and enjoyable videos 😊
450k views in two days with 5 mill subs.  Ohhhhhh dear
Nice to see Matthe still does original content that no other YouTube channels do 😂

I'm an American and a germophobe I knew I couldn't trust those around me to be clean.
really Mat? you could have just said a wine barrel can hold 60 gals equivalent to 300 bottles.
Only a slave mentality individual would continue working after a lotto win.

Matt, your videos have helped me learn so much, they are very educational. Thank you for doing these videos, you are an awesome person, I feel like you are a friend! Your videos get me through a lot of sleepless nights too! ❤️😊👍🏻
These videos must be so hard to make wonder how long he can keep it up
Thanks for the video :)
No idea how La La Land wo so many awards. The movie was so shitty
Fact number one: what a sad life....
On behalf of Norway, thanks for shedding more and more light on us, so the world knows we're not dull xD

La La Land won all seven nomination of Golden Globe Awards and yet Moonlight manage to take away Oscar
Hi Matt, so I watched someone react to your abuse story since I couldn't find it from your main channel. And I want to say I am so sorry for what you have experienced. I haven't been in that problematic situation, but I can tell from your voice and the way you acted that it was really bad. And I want to say you have a lot of guts to go out and tell your story. You are a legend, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
SUPRESSORS NOT SILENCERS you literally said it's not possible to silence a gun
Still copying the lists I see
La La Land. Was just Hollywood licking it's own balls.
That cows day is on my birthday
Hey, Matt.  I've been watching this channel ever since your 6th 50 Amazing Facts video.  I love tuning in because not only do I learn something new every time I watch, but I can always get a good laugh out of it, too.  Keep it up.
#48 Bilingual study done in Montreal finds that it's better to be bilingual, shocker... :P
we Indians also used to make mud balls in our childhood !
If you did not know, many other european contries were actually way ahead of Norway to use digital radio, but they never turned off the FM. And than stopped ising digital radio, to go back to only rely on FM radio
How do spell the mud ball thing? I want to look it up
Human body is 37 degrees celsius....so no milk coming out of a cow(also a living thing for those of you who didn't know) being 37.8 is normal and also not crazy hot or whatever.
Also, in Moffat, Scotland you'll find the world's skinniest hotel. Or, we like to think that anyway.
At the moment you've blown our minds 4.400 times
I know someone who has gorgeous green eyes and their Asian
The first one about the lottery is because us Americans are brainwashed at very young ages to believe in The American Dream, which is bullshit. I believe the vast majority of Americans work hard as fuck and still struggle to pay our bills, like me.
I have 1 fact ... my balls touch my legs
It's pronounced tems river :p
This channel fell off
Matthew you didn't add your most recent videos at the end
Looking good with that California tan lol
Matt you should make a top 10 worst medieval times torture devices

when hoddle starts to talk about consistency, owen face turned pale lol
Rio talks sense. England kid with two golden boots. 50 goals in two years before turning 20. Owen would be neymar level in term of money right now. The fact he's English slaps on another 50mil. At that age, you could not see past him as the next up and coming player. But what happened he got pushed too much too early and could have had a brilliant career that lasted long. Instead it finished up short. Keep young players ticking slowly. Let them develop. Then make him into the player you need
Rooney's been a great player but there's no question that if Michael Owen hadn't been unlucky with injuries throughout his career, he'd currently be way out in front as England's all time leading goal scorer.
Why is Woodburn even being mentioned. He scored 1 good goal and suddenly the British media are wanking over him shock horror.
I agree completely but you've got to remember Woodburn and Rashford aren't getting the game time that Owen was. Yes Rashford is playing a lot but now he's adapting his game to convert to a winger whereas Owen was a striker and woodburn just straight up is getting no game time. Imo Woodburn should go to Swansea or somewhere on loan and he could flourish.
As a united fan I know Owen played for us but he's a LFC boy through and through and I have to admit early 2000s no better striker than owen this day and age he'd be worth easily 100mil
The best teenage strikers in the 90s were:\n1. Ronaldo \n2. Robbie Fowler\n3. Michael Owen\n4. Raul\n5. Nicholas Anelka
At 18 and 19 all the way to 24, just before he went to Madrid, Owen was averaging 18 premier league goals a season, and thats before we factor in cup and european goals...... Football has changed, thats all
Owen had scored 40 PL goals before he turned 20, Rashford isn't on his level and Woodburn lol he's done nothing yet.
Michael Owen- great player to traitor to shit pundit
That means Rashford and Woodburn is not better than me. - M.Owen
'There & Back' - A Solar Project For UNICEF would be much more entertaining!
Owen was given a chance at a very young age. We don't have that in the game anymore. Players normally make their breakthrough in their early 20s. Money has fucked everything
Rio always talks straight. These kids got a long way to go before reaching Owens sensational form as a youngster
Judge them at the end of there career
Fair statements Rio.. Owen on his prime ( 19 years old ) was way too better than rashford,  woodburn, kane combined..!!!
Rio is a genius!!! This is exactly what there has been complaints about English Media hyping the youngsters even before they even reach their potential.\nThey need to be tested against time as how consistent they are atleast for 2-3 years to be called anything close to prodigy.
This game was in our hands but useless defence cost us
Up the potters
Rio is right. Owen was a world class finisher even in his teens. He had an instinctive, almost preternatural ability to find the back of net. Romario had that too. Mbappe has shown glimpses of that but he needs to do it over the course of a season or two. Rashford is rather different. He's more of a support striker than a poacher number 9.
Up d flats
Owen was sick
English fans and media overhyping youngsters. What's new?
rashford has been poor so far this season he's been having episodes of poor games but the English media will try a defend him until he's 24 and done nothing and it will be on to the next  teenager. We should look at how the French bring their young players they don't buss ppl ear with their names. They let talent speak for itself. Personally I don't see the hype in rashford at part from the fact that  the British media are saying his name every week. This is pathetic.
Rio dont even mention Mbappe in this context mbappe has proven his worth in the UCL the biggest competition out there...
Owen was a phenomenal player as a young talent but injuries made him an average player and for me didn't deserve that ballon D'or he won
Rashford is better than Owen or at least he's gonna be.Owen was done by 25 lol
look at these old guys trying to cling on to their past status. haha .... Owen is dogshite compared to the players of today... Rio just bitter because he was always a liability, not as good as a defender like a Pique, luiz or a Terry who are also better then all those past overrated defenders too  (Adams, Campbell, Moore, Cannavaro, Nesta, Hiero, etc ...are all  below their level!)\n\nLuke Shaw is twice the player Maldini ever was (in fact he is better then carlos and maldini combined)\nwhy would you want a dirt player like cafu when you can play a great like Alvares?!?!?!\n\nWho would play overrated rubbish like a Scholes... a Keane... a Viera... < all crap players compared to todays (Hhahahah)\nEven Zidane is looked all rose tinted on... he was also rubbish... players like Coutinho are already better then players like him.\n\nAnd forwards and wingers... the past like to say so called greats like Maradona (the druggie)... Pele (the pervert)... R9.... (the fattie)... Best (the drunk)... Cruyff (the clown).... are better then the grerats cr7 and Messi and Neymar and Mbappe... hahahahaha\n\nIf old players that do punditry like Rio, Owen, Henry, Neville (etc) want to still get involved they can become todays boot cleaners because they were all rubbish and overrated
Who is Owen loool yeah a name in England but nothing in football world get over yourself, England produce Owen and Brazil produce Ronaldo
The way he was slamming it around scratching that table was making me loose my mind.
and thats my boring video of the day\n\n#42 on trending, grats
When a car is hit from behind (a rear end collision), anything sitting on the dash, or a dash compartment, becomes a missile and flies rapidly toward anyone sitting behind it.  My guess is that the little latch isn't designed to be triggered by gravity, but instead it will be triggered by the force of a rear end collision, and prevent any contents from shooting into the face of somebody sitting in the center of the back seat.
Do you reckon you made enough fucking noise with that thing
it's for when you accelerate....so shit doesn't shoot out the door. all that fwd Honda civic G force you get on the launch
Thats actually a really cool little feature. If you had something with some weight in there, like a phone, a sock full of coins, or a lead pig. They'd probably overcome the spring-loaded door and slide out under heavy acceleration (especially up a hill).\nCheers for sharing your find, man.
I don't understand how this works because you didn't bang it and fumble it enough.
RIP table
Can you stop fucking shaking the fucking thing around holy shit, you fat handed son of a bitch slamming shit around
This is for when the car accelerates.  Have you ever had something on your dash and started out real fast, everything gets dumped on the floor.  This weight when the car accelerates quickly will cause the door to be held shut preventing everything inside from coming out.
It's for when you have something with a bit of weight to it stored in there (mobile phone, etc), so it wont come flying out on steep hills, accelerating, etc.
Then you park on a hill and realise you cant get your smokes out...
LMFAO... and when you stick your cigarettes and wallet in that box then park on a hill...LOL  yes this did happen. 1995 Rodeo.  I removed the door FOREVER...
That was actually brilliant.
700 people cannot hide their drugs in there anymore.
Can't fit your hand in there because it is made to hold CD cases, not 'stuff'.  Don't you hate when the quarter you just really need is sitting back there and you can't get it out? [Insert dropping and smashing sounds here...]
i wish they would have done somthing like this mirrior under the sun visor. the dam lid would fall down. eventually got pissed amd ripped it off ass a cop was parked next to me.
Just think of the engineer, or team there of, that is soaking up a free paycheck to overthink simple problems. Why simply use a stronger spring that holds the door closed when you can spend hours making a stupid fail safe for a junk compartment!
and if you park uphill you can't  access whats inside?!
Here's to engineers
You're a nerd.
So if the cars upside down....it shuts the box?
I'll bet it's super annoying to have it lock up in San Francisco.
When going up a hill, that locks the door and stops anything that may slide inside from sliding out and flying across the car. So in essence, that is a time saver, because it saves you the time you'd have taken to clean that mess up.
If you are getting towed the guy can't steal your spare credit cards and cash etc....
People in San Fran be like duh.
Could you stop hitting the thing on the table. I don't know if it's on purpose but man is it annoying.
Ok this is cool but what's the code for my fuckin radio?  It just decided I need a code so now no music.
552k views. Not even 200 subscribers. What
It's on the Suburu Baja as well....actually, it's probably on all Suburus
How many times can he drop it shake and drop it again, I thought he was showing a video on how durable it was.
You should notice a small, useful device called a tripod.
It's probably a part of the safety features for accidents. Whatever is in the compartment during a crash would overcome the spring loaded door and become a lethal projectile. The weight would lock the door during an impact. Just a guess
When your laptop is worth more than your car
It so when you have heavy stuff in it and you floor it, the thing doesn't dump all your crap out. Not for hills. It's a honda, not a Jeep genius.
That's so rice
It doesn't keep the door from opening on its own. It keeps YOU from opening the door. Certainly not a feature I'd like to discover when I really need to get into the cubby.
Japanese engineering. The best in the world
I'd find that really frustrating if I lived on a hill and that damn lock kept making getting my stuff out after I parked difficult to get out.
its to hold your stuff in in case of an accident. that way there is not shit flying around your car when you are rolling down a hill because you were drunk texting your ex when driving home after a night of drinking alone in the high school football stadium parking lot. because that's what i assume people with early to mid 00s civics do.
It's actually for when you stomp on the accelerator so your belongings don't fly out
So the annoying thing about that would be when you finally find a parking place facing up a hill and go to grab your wallet out of the compartment and the door is locked because of the hill...
Until it locks up or rusts and you need to break your fucking car at the McDonald's drive-through just to pay for your Happy Meal.
It's intended for the effects of acceleration.
obviously that had issues when trouble shooting the car and added that feature no one knows about.
This video is worth 1 quarter upvote
very likely fucking problem hence engineers who give a fucking shit
Better remove your stuff from it before parking up a steep hill.
So the door is spring loaded and wont open when the car driving up a steep grade? Then why have the weight and locking mechanism?\n\nHey bill you have your compass ready for the half mountain hike? Oh yeah I put it in the dash cubby with my phone let me grab it... god dammit the door wont open! Hang on I need to turn my car around to open this compartment.
be me, own POS 2003 CIVIC hand-me-down. Always have to park on uphill slope when I get home from minimum wage job....can't open goddamn storage unit if I'm not level, so needless to say I often have to leave valuables behind until the next day to retrieve.   One day I leave my prized anime cards behind after forgetting to open latch during a level straight away.  Park near studio apartment.  Storage unit is rendered useless.   Cards are in the car overnight.   That night there is a BLM protest on my block.  Car gets set ablaze.  Cards are gone forever.   \nGet on youtubes to find solace, comfort and maybe some seductively soothing ASMR.....instead find a fidgety dork honoring the Honda engineers for this this blatant quality control oversight.   \nDecide to take pills and wait for the sweet release of death.  This will be my final post.   RIP in peace, me.
What if you park up hill and you want to get your shit out of there but you cant cuz it locked it self? Does now seem very ingenious now lol
OY VEY HE FOUND OUT THE SECRET\n\nSHUT IT DOWN
That's the thing about good engineering; When it's done right, nobody will ever notice to appreciate it.
This is a time when Honda's priority was engineering.
Unlikely problem? Have you been to San Francisco? If you ever seen those hills, you'd know you would definitely use this feature all the time.
If you think about it, when whoever was creating that little door, they probably did not have that mechanism inside. Then while testing in a car, they find that the door opens on hills and fast accelerations. So they came up with a little solution. Still genius, but not impossible to imagine  how they came to adding that feature.
That shows engineers and designers do think about a lot of stuff people dont know about.
Wow, they don't make 'em like they used to applies to this. :)
You would be mind blown by how BMW has been designing cars for decades. Repair costs aside they make honda look like they have fallen asleep for years .. and I drive one.
But... what if you needed to open it on while stuck on an incline?
mmm, neat.
were you masterbating with your other hand? Also, stop blowing lines of coke before you make tech videos. Your shaky fucking hands are horrible.

WOAHHH !BRO WHATS YOUR FAVORITE STRAIN ?
jesus fuck, just buy a tripod if you're that retarded
Just put it down on the table you ham-handed twat.
what if you are parked on a hill and want your shit out.
Could you please toss some more things around, stumble through your narrative, and become even more awkward?  Well prepared presentations are soooo yesterday.  I think we all prefer the any idiot can get on YouTube video style instead.
What an utterly pointless video. This deserved some recognition?
K WE GOT IT IN 20 SC. NO NEED TO GO ON.
Hey genius, it's to prevent stuff from flying out when you ACCELERATE.\n\nYou really think they would put a locking mechanism for when the car is tilted backwards??
this would have been a good video except your camera work. Please put your phone on a tripod next time you want to make a boring video of the day. \nShaky video is worse than Portrait video
the guy holding a camera acts like retard, so annoying
STOP moving the camera around so much, you idiot fuckstick.
Are you really this stupid?
When your boring video of the get becomes trending
Wow, worst camera work ever. I've know squirrels with near fatal meth addictions that had a steadier hand with the camera. This was impossible to watch after about 7 seconds in.
Mine got stuck yesterday morning and I can't get my fucking keys out !!! Without pulling out the dash!!!! WTF!!! Had to Uber to school!!!!
cool..ya coulda made this video about a minute and a half shorter tho just sayin
You are shit at filming man.
you should click clack drop and bang that thing around a few more times in your next video
That's retarded. No shit.
please beat yourself with a wrench dipped in glass before u make another vide-ho. thank you.

Do you have fucking Parkinsons?
Not deduct; you deduce.
Holy shit! thats
this vid makes me angry for some reason ..
My understanding of IT taking the form of Pennywise, at least based on the Tim Curry adaptation, was because typically Clowns were enjoyed. So IT would use the clown to get close and entice people to let their guard down. Which is kind of what happened in the first film adaptation where the little girl hears Pennywise laugh and she even smiles. It's not that people feared clowns so much as it was easier to set them up before knocking them down as a clown rather than say... the creature from the Black Lagoon.
pennywise amusement park was in the dark tower movie, so I think he's one of the evils that escaped when the dark tower was attacked.
I don't know how others feel, but I'm not really down for the idea of Amy Adams playing in the sequel...
If It turned into a Donald Trump that somehow became president, I think I couldn't handle that reality any longer.
in my elementary there was a rock war we all threw rocks at each other it fucking hurt like hell but we survived XD damn fifht graders
The kiss awakening Beverly makes sense, as does Pennywise putting her in a trance. One of the scenes that took place in her room earlier in the movie showed a copy of The Princess and The Frog. Not to mention the many references they do back to the play in which she kissed Bill. It all foreshadowed what was going to happen to her albeit pretty subtly
I completely agree with you about those fucking rocks.
Pennywise would turn into a moth for me lol
Who was the kid with the big ass glasses?...Ok we were watching the movie threw Richies eyes!. He was there thee entire time he was afraid of clowns. Think about It at the end he said you dragged me threw the sewers, punched me in the face, almost got me killed, etc now i gotta kill this clown. That's what the audience went threw all that. Billie was sooo persistent with his search for georgie and the story kept beating us over the head with it that he LITERALLY punched Richie in the Head. I mean they all start to see Pennywise cause their confidence was shot they all felt like losers. Ones fat and likes new kids on the block, one has a bad stutter, one cant man up and do his share on the farm, one has paralyzing odc about cleanliness, one got bullied and was on her period and more than likely molested, etc. Also they all felt like LOSERS after every encounter with Pennywise. And what do we call losers? CLOWNS!! look at this clown! the Bully started to see pennywise after his dad made him feel like a bitch. That's why the word loser was shown and said sooo much. Then eventually became the word lover. When there confidence rose threw out the movie but the glasses kid reminded us that they were losers thee entire time. So that's why they all can see him😇
4:30 not the seen where the young child gets his arm ripped off and tries to crawl away unsuccessfully? lol
Bill Hader he's going to be Richie
What I loved is that it terrorizes the kids during the day. It's scary because it can scare you at any time of day
Oh Jeremy is gonna love the reveal of what Pennywise actually is.
For me, IT would B just hundreds of pares of eyes that never look away from me, no matter how much I beg.
This movie made me feel lonely because my own losers club from middle school and high school are all away at college now (I'm still at home because my school doesn't start until next week) so I had to watch this movie alone 😢
Well IT is a spider...i know im sorry
Oh my good I was so worried about the rock fight 2!!! That was the most intense moment for me lol
If IT wanted to really freak me out, it would transform into Monstro the Whale from Pinocchio. He scared the hell out of me when I was a kid. Submerge me in water, chase me as Monstro, forget about it. I'm dead.
IT would turn into a mass of snake-like gelatinous horror, slowly writhing towards me. I think that would do it for me. Love the video as always. Thanks for the content.
richie reminds me of me so much
I'm terrified of locis the bug let's see IT turn into one of them
insider.finimize.com/?kid=H6R3T\n\nCheck out Finimize! It's a great newsletter that gives you the 2 main financial news stories of the day; and only takes a few minutes to read!
IT would turn into the Green Lantern movie for me.
What I really loved about this movie the most was the visual direction it had, the atmosphere and tone gave me a silent hill or the evil within vibe and I think if they keep it up for the next movie then we should expect some PT quality scenes. Just my opinion!
Jeremy, the person killed by the Black Lagoon monster isn't the bully, it's the missing boy Billy Corcoran
IT would look like me letting my parents down.
That is an awesomtacular shirt, dude! I have one just like it. \m/
I hate your rating system. A grading letter scale is easier to understand. Is awesometacular a B-? So vague
I'm afraid of heights sooo...
Jeremy Jahns I was curious to know if u would do a review of the book since I myself have started reading it as well.  I just would want to know ur input on it
I once said I didn't anything, till I dreamt about it, imagine a being of human bodyparts sprouting from the head, an amorphous being composed mainly of human limbs.\n\nfew years later, I found a Manga displaying this very same monster, this manga is called Gantz.\n\nweirdest Manga out there and it holds the shit that I fear the most.\nmay I add that that thing, ate me whole and chewed my body like a motherfucker.\n\nYeah that shit scared the shit outta me.
It would turn into my student loans
i'm surprised nobody is talking about all the winks and nods to a nightmare on elm street in this film.
I'm scared of jellyfish lol I wonder how he would use that against me
What if they wait 27 years to make part 2 with the same actors
It would probably turn into a gcse paper
I'm scared of a dark abyss like a deep ocean and then something huge swimming from the bottom and swallowing me whole
if IT was after me he'd turn into Caitlyn Jenner
Clown, the clown scares the shit out of me, or coincidentally... I giant fucking spider!
It actually has a reason for being a clown. This is BOOK spoilers so dont read if you want to learn it from the book. . . it. . .\n\n\nHe seasons his victims with Fear. Fear makes them taste better, essentially. IT likes to hunt children because children have very basic fears which he can easily manipulate. He takes the form of a clown because, to the child, it's easy for him to get close to said children, so he can use his abilities to scare them more, like with Georgie.
You are not going to enjoy the ending.
At this point having seen the OG mini series, read the book and seen the new movie. I'm pretty damn sure that It would just stay as Pennywise for me.
Can virgins only see this shit?
I think it'd show up as Hannibal lecter for me then.
is there a lot of gore in it
this movie was crafted badly. the sex milf jokes were the only good thing. cgi was weak, it could have been better. sexualized a teen girl. it was just disturbing, creepy, funny, and not in a good way.
My personal IT sequel adult cast hopefuls\n\nBill- Tobey Maguire\nBen- Chris Pratt\nMike- Anthony Mackie\nRichie- Danny McBride\nEddie- Paul Rudd\nStan- Casey Affleck\nBeverley- Rachel McAdams\n\nThey are all around the exact age the kids should be 27 years later (Paul Rudd is somewhat older) and I think it's easy to believe the kids would look like them grown up, not to mention they're all great actors.
ha i remeber my fear isnt spiders it's my dad, oh but then pennywise would have to run away too.
IT would turn into a underaged girl
Shitty review, also this faggot is so annoying!
gonna get a lot of flack for this but IT for me would probably look like white michael jackson. nothing against him, i love his music but he's scared me since I was a kid
Does failure count...what is the embodiment of failure...me 45 years from now having failed and completely given up.
I think it wouldnt turn into anything for me he would drop me in the ocean untill im scared shitless then he eats me as a sea creature or something but can he do that idk
Fat kid Snow White that Bitch in the sewer, he still doesn't get the fucking girl, I'm just like wtf this kid has the deepest bond with the girl,  none of the bonds were that deep but the fat kid had the deepest
I didn't think the kiss was too cheesy since I saw it coming. In Bev's room, there are a few fairytale storybooks laying around. I think it was supposed foreshadow that she longed for a happy ending. It also shows how her father controlled and tried to see her as a his little girl ...
Either a xenomorph from alien, or the creeper from jeepers creepers.
Beverly's dad - he was telling Beverly you are my ____? What is the blank??
The answer is cocaine man the answer is cocaine
A giant spider. Just like the end of the miniseries. Freaked me the fuck out. Clown. Spider. Yep. I was, like, 10 I first some bits of that movie. Haha.
I can't wait for the sequel in which of bunch of kids are afraid of their iPhones breaking. That is the epitome of fear if that happened to a kid today.
I think a punch from Jeremy Jahns would scare me the most...\nThat guy got some serious practice.
Of course Demonic Hauntings are real...the Fan4stic movie
Hope they get seth green in the second one
I, too, subscribe to the fear makes them taste better theory thus far.
It would probably turn into commitment somehow
Movie was fine, not as good as I think everyone was making it out to be. I was expecting something on the level of The Conjuring but got something on the level of Mama, the director's previous film.\n\nThe biggest problem was too many underdeveloped characters. You could take Mike, Stanley, and Ritchie out of the film and it would have changed absolutely nothing to the story. Also the added conflict with Henry at the end literally went nowhere and added nothing to the plot.\n\nThey should've spent more time developing the characters and showing us how their fear relates to their characters, such as Bill being afraid that Georgie is dead, rather than having a spooky scene with Pennywise every five minutes so the audience doesn't get bored!! Stanley being chased by a painting or Ben chased by a headless person could have been taken out to actually give us more about their characters so we feel for them when Pennywise does attack them. \n\n7.5/10.
welcome to the loser club motherfucker!
If pennywise wanted to scare me he'd looked like like the people from Strangers holding a knife :(
It would turn into me.
they should make the new it when the actors are 27 years older
You should make a podcast of you just talking about movies
After the scene in the garage I heard someone in the theater start crying, it was hilarious
Kind of imagine a spider but i have made some good headway on that particular fear.
What am I scared off most? Clowns that commit suicide man that freaks me out.
I wonder how many would be afraid of like trypophobia, Imagine that nightmare.
I think Christina Hendricks should be adult Beverly. That'd be cool.
It would probably turn into a giant spider or a blank tombstone. I don't like spiders and I genuinely fear being forgotten after I die. Irrational I know, but there it is.
My fear is penny wise to be honest holy shit lol
The scariest part for me was the part where Patrick is in the sewer before he dies, the way penny eats says thank god you found us, is completely terrifying.
Just out of curiosity, if IT needs his victims to fear him/her/whatever politically correct term describes the orange celestial lights in order for IT to have ability to harm them, How was IT able to harm Georgie when he clearly wasn't afraid to reach into a sewer to take his boat back from a creepy clown in a storm drain?
do a brief review of the book compared to the movie when you finish the book, please
Can we just wait 27 years for the sequel and cast the same actors but older?
Wait if I fear abandonment does he just... go away?
...An 80 foot, pissed-off,  rampaging and finger-pointing Hillary beast with a head of steam heading to the east coast for revenge would scare the fuck out of me.
T rex
snakes
Donald Trump
So basically batman can beat pennywise
Read that damn book Jeremy 😂😂😂😂
my student loans
A doll/Annebale
Spider. Id be so scared
Spiders
Woohoo! IT GOT AWESOMETACULAR!!! ^•^
My mom's sandal

It sounds like Jeepers Creepers
State puff marshmallow man.....
A giant spider
Adblock FTW
This guy surprises me every time \nHe sings with so much emotion \nHis songs always tell my story
This song is really awesome!!! 👌👌👏👏
Is it just me, or is the chord progression at the start the same one Christina Grimmie plays in her cover of counting stars?
who Hurt him, But im kinda happy because if they didnt hurt him, he wouldn't be making this good touching song. but still Who hurt him.
I love this song
precisely the song of my last almost-boyfriend...
White people shit fuck that retreat

Oooh Sam Smith you sure know how to make a tough nut lose its shell
Every time you walk out \nThe less I love you \nSadly is exactly how it goes.
I'm never gonna let you close to me, even though you mean the most to me. This line hurts so much when you've been hurt before 😭

Very deep and relative (comprende) \n:Mike Mad GA
Gald to hear you again been missing that voice
Every sam smith song makes me.cry why are they so damn relatable. I'm glad he's back!!
Hello everyone! I love singing too. I need my covers on YouTube to spread. Sorry if I put it out like that, I just need things to turn around, but I can't do it on my own. One view can seriously make a difference. I wanted to thank all the constructive criticism I've been getting. I always appreciate support, in all its forms. Thank you!
Can I give it a million thumbs ups?!!!
I miss his old self. I didn't even recognize him. I found this song on the radio and looked him up. I was like what the heck who is this. I wish he never lose the weight he doesn't look the same. #MissingYou!!!
I miss him he speaks about my non existent love life.
love this song since i listened. i'd to say woow!
Cool! Subscribe to my page just songs I recorded on my iPhone nothing serious my listen I just posted some I did today  :)) follow me on instagram @pauly.riley

This song is me all over. Whenever I meet someone new, no matter the situation, I'll play them this.

This is the song version of what my relationship is with my family. The song itself is really amazing but the words get into the emotions which is so hard that I like to listen to!
